        "text": "ForCity Smart Artic X54 is the first carriage produced for the upcoming light rail traffic in the Metropolitan Area. The carriages are two-way, which means they have control cabins at both ends and doors on both sides. The carriages are also 34 metres long, and they can be extended later by about 10 metres. The floor of the light rail carriage is at the same level as the stop platforms, and there are no steps inside the carriage. In the inner city, the light rail lines run on the same tracks as the existing trams.\n\nThe first light rail carriage is a prototype, which we tested in the inner city tram network from summer 2021 to early winter 2022. Experiences of the prototype carriage will be used as a reference when finalising the solutions on serially produced carriages. At this point, passengers also got to see the new light rail carriage.\n\nThe light rail carriages are designed so that they suit the Helsinki rail network, which is quite challenging in places. Furthermore, in terms of operating and maintenance, the carriages are compatible with the Artic carriages in the inner city as far as possible. The carriages are eco-friendly, energy-efficient, modifiable and accessible. Their maintenance costs are also low.\n\nAn essential new mobility solution\n\nThe first 29 carriages supplied by Škoda Transtech will be used on the light rail line 550 once the Jokeri Light Rail is completed. We have also ordered 23 similar carriages, named ForCity Smart Artic X54, for the needs of the Crown Bridges Light Rail.\n\nThe light rail line will be an essential new mobility solution in the Helsinki region. In addition to light rail line 15 and the Crown Bridges connection in Laajasalo, light rail vehicles will also run along the light rail line on Vihdintie between Helsinki city centre and Kannelmäki in the 2020s."
