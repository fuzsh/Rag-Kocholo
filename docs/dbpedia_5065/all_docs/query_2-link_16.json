        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nElectromagnetic interference (EMI) of electric appliances with active medical implants such as cardiac pacemakers has posed a challenge for decades. In particular, older pacemaker models have been shown to be susceptible to the electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emitted by everyday household and workplace appliances [1–5]. Difficulties have also arisen in electromagnetically hostile workplaces after an employee has had a pacemaker implanted. Many applications involved in supply and transmission of electric power emit high electric and magnetic fields that can cause EMI with pacemakers [6–8]. According to the European EMF directive 2004/40/EC, employers are responsible for ensuring the safety of workers with pacemakers or other active medical implants [9].\n\nWe have previously studied the occurrence of pacemaker EMI from an electronic article surveillance gate, an induction cook top, and a welding machine [10]. However, there are several other common EMF sources that could potentially interfere with pacemakers.\n\nMobile phones have been shown to cause interference in older pacemaker models, particularly with unipolar sensing settings, but also with bipolar sensing feature commonly used in modern pacemakers [11–14]. We found no previous data on EMI with pacemakers from mobile phone base stations. However, because EMFs emitted by base stations are similar to those emitted by mobile phones, they may also be possible sources of EMI in specific situations [15,16]. This may happen for instance if a maintenance worker with a pacemaker installs or maintains base station antennae with his chest close to an active transmitter.\n\nOnly one study related to trains and pacemakers was found and it is about possible EMI in a magnetically levitated linear motor car [17]. We found no reports on EMI with pacemakers from EMFs in electric trains. However, our previous measurements indicated that the EMFs in certain sites inside old models of electric commuter trains are rather high, and may pose a danger to pacemaker patients. The areas with the highest magnetic fields were found to be close to the thyristor cabinets in the hallways of the trains. In Finland, electric trains use a 25 kV/50 Hz voltage, and the engines of the trains use electric current varying from 300 A to 600 A, depending on the driving speed. During acceleration the current can reach almost 1000 A [18].\n\nOverhead high voltage transmission lines emit electric and magnetic fields that have been suspected to cause EMI with pacemakers [7,8,19,20].\n\nIn this study, we evaluated the occurrence of EMI with some frequently used pacemaker models near two mobile phone base stations, in an electric commuter train, and under 400 kV overhead high voltage power transmission lines.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Volunteers and pacemakers\n\nFor this study, we chose 11 volunteers with pacemakers from three manufacturers: St Jude Medical (Sylmar, CA, USA), Boston Scientific (Natick, MA, USA), and Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN, USA). The volunteers were recruited from the Pacemaker Clinic of Helsinki University Central Hospital. Criteria for participation were the patient’s age (only working-aged volunteers) and nature of heart disease (only clinically stable volunteers who were not dependent on their pacemaker).\n\nNormal clinical programming with bipolar configuration was maintained in all the pacemakers. The models, modes, base rates, and sensitivities of the pacemakers tested are shown in . Atrial tachycardia and ventricular high rate detections of the pacemakers were programmed on in all but three pacemakers, with detection rates of 170–225 beats/minute. All the physiological pacemakers (DDD) had a mode switch feature programmed with auto mode switch base rates of 40–90 beats/minute in case of a detected atrial arrhythmia.\n\nTable 1\n\nManufacturerModelModeBase rate (beats/min)Atrial sensitivity (mV)Ventricular sensitivity (mV)St Jude MedicalIdentity ADx SR 5180AAIR700.5—Identity ADx XL DR 5386DDD400.752.0Accent DR RF 2212DDD500.20.5Accent DR RF 2212DDIR600.41.0Accent DR RF 2212DDD500.52.0Victory XL DR 5816DDD500.52.0Boston ScientificAltrua 60 S 602VVIR60—2.5Altrua 60 S 602DDD500.234.1Altrua 50 S 502DDIR600.754.0MedtronicKappa KSR 401/403VVI50—2.8Kappa KDR 901DDDR600.52.0\n\nThe study design was approved by the Coordinating Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa. All volunteers were fully informed in writing of the study and gave their written consent prior to the study.\n\n2.2. Measurement procedure\n\nPrior to the exposure tests, the pacemakers were interrogated. The patients underwent an ambulatory three-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) recording (BMS/Braemar, Burnsville, MN, USA) during the tests. The ECG recording was started after the initial interrogation and completed just prior to the final interrogation of the pacemakers. The beginning of every exposure was labeled with a trigger button of the ECG recorder. This made it possible to link the exposure and the corresponding sections in the ECG in order to find possible traces of EMI. ECG recordings were then analyzed in order to find traces of possible interference, e.g., inappropriate atrial or ventricular sensing resulting in loss of pacing or inappropriate pacing, asynchronous pacing due to magnet response or noise reversion mode, and mode switch episodes. After the exposures, all the pacemakers were interrogated again and checked for possible malfunctions due to EMI, including possible stored episodes of false atrial or ventricular high rate detection, mode switch, and magnet response.\n\n2.3. Mobile phone base station transmitters\n\nTwo small indoor pico-size GSM base station transmitters were located next to each other on the wall in the basement of a workplace. The volunteers were asked to stand in front of the antennae for 30 seconds so that the distance between their chest and the base stations was approximately 50 cm. The electric field measured at that point was 16 V/m. The electric field measurements were performed using a Narda EMR-300 with a 33c electric field probe (Narda Safety Test Solutions, Pfullingen, Germany).\n\n2.4. Electric commuter train\n\nThe magnetic flux density in an electrically powered commuter train was measured to be approximately 170 μT above a bench attached to a thyristor cabinet where the volunteers were asked to sit while the train accelerated twice. This field level was consistent with magnetic fields previously measured in several different trains of the same model. The volunteers also stood in the hallway of the train, leaning against the thyristor cabinet while the train accelerated. The highest temporal magnetic flux density next to the thyristor cabinet was measured to be approximately 170 μT which also complied with our previous measurements. The field levels at the two test sites varied slightly between the tests depending on the level of the train’s acceleration. All magnetic field measurements were made using a Narda ELT 400 magnetic field meter (Narda Safety Test Solutions, Pfullingen, Germany). The two exposure situations took a few minutes per volunteer, depending on the delays between the train's accelerations.\n\n2.5. High voltage transmission lines\n\nThe EMI tests were conducted while the volunteers walked for approximately ten minutes under 400 kV transmission lines. The national grid company provided the details of the currents and voltages of the power lines at the time of the tests. These details were used to calculate analytically the magnetic and electric fields under the transmission lines. In all positions, the magnetic and electric field levels were less than 3 μT and 4 kV/m, respectively. We were unable to measure the field intensities under the transmission lines because of the freezing weather of the day with temperature below the operation temperature of the meters.\n\n3. Results\n\nThe study population consisted of six women and five men. The mean age was 52 years with a range 34–64 years. One of the pacemakers was programmed to AAI(R) mode, two to VVI(R) mode, six to DDD(R) mode, and two to DDI(R) mode [21,22]. The mean time in use of the pacemakers was 2.5 years (range, 0.3–7.0 years). Indication of pacing was sick sinus syndrome in four patients, disturbed atrioventricular conduction in five patients, and atrial fibrillation with bradycardia in two patients.\n\nThe mean programmed atrial sensitivity was 0.48 mV ± 0.19 mV, and the mean ventricular sensitivity was 2.3 mV ± 1.1 mV. In the patients with an atrial lead, atria were mostly paced in three patients and atrial sensing was predominantly present in six. Among the patients with a ventricular lead, ventricles were paced in three patients, and the remaining seven patients exhibited predominantly ventricular sensing.\n\nIn this study, none of the pacemakers tested experienced EMI during the various tests. No episodes of asynchronous pacing due to magnet response or noise reversion mode, or inhibition of atrial or ventricular pacing due to inappropriate sensing of the EMFs were observed during the continuous ECG recording of the study participants. Inappropriate ventricular pacing in the dual chamber devices due to atrial oversensing was not witnessed. Moreover, no stored episodes of mode switch or falsely detected atrial or ventricular arrhythmias were observed when the pacemakers were interrogated after the EMF exposures, and no abnormalities in the pacemaker parameters and function were noticed, either.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe main finding of our study was that EMFs created by mobile phone base stations, commercial trains and transmission lines did not result in EMI with modern pacemakers programmed to bipolar settings. High EMF exposure from mobile phone base stations may not be relevant to most workers, because base station antennae are normally located near the roof, far away from normal working environments. However, areas with field levels similar to those measured in this study may sometimes be accessed by technical personnel installing and maintaining the base stations.\n\nThe tests in the electric commuter train were conducted in two spots that were known to have high magnetic field levels. The train conductor normally stands next to the thyristor cabinet in the hallway of a train, sometimes even leaning on it when collecting fares after each station. Public transportation (including commuter trains, trams, and underground) is a global source of EMFs not only to employees but also to passengers.\n\nHigh voltage transmission lines can produce considerably high electric and magnetic fields in the surrounding area and below. These fields are reported as possibly affecting the operation of pacemakers [7,8,19,20]. This can cause problems for any pacemaker patient moving near transmission lines, but especially to workers who maintain the lines. Although we found no EMI between the transmission lines and the pacemakers in this study, high voltage transmission lines still remain a potential source of EMI.\n\nA thorough individual risk assessment is required prior to when a worker can safely return to work after a pacemaker implantation [23]. At most workplaces, such as offices, schools, and shops where EMFs are generally weak, only a general risk assessment is needed. First, the employer has to identify the need for a risk assessment. This involves a survey to determine general details about pacemakers, as well as basic operational methods about the pacemaker of the worker. Also the special instructions concerning EMI that may have been given to the employee need to be determined. Next, the level of the risk assessment must be evaluated. It is important to recognize possible sources of EMI in the workplace. When it is not clear whether or not strong EMFs exist in the work environment, a special risk assessment is to be carried out, including the measurement of EMFs. The findings, and possible actions they require, must be estimated so that the areas the employee needs to avoid can be defined, and his/her working methods can be rearranged. All the findings should be documented for possible further use. The assessment shall be maintained, and updated every time fundamental changes are made at the workplace or to the pacemaker's programmable settings.\n\nThe fact that only 11 pacemakers of eight different models were tested can be considered a study limitation. Moreover, some of the pacemaker models were old, although they are still used in pacemaker treatment. By contrast, modern pacemakers are likely to be even more resistant to EMI than older models. A great majority of pacemakers are implanted with bipolar settings. However, one cannot apply our results to unipolar pacemaker systems, which are known to be more susceptible to external EMFs. The pacemakers tested were not programmed to the most sensitive settings and not every pacemaker had its episode triggers on. It was decided to leave all of the programming settings of the pacemakers as the initial values clinically programmed to every volunteer. This decision was due to the occupational safety approach of this study.\n\nOne study limitation was the fact that electric and magnetic field intensities could not be measured under the high-voltage transmission lines at the time of the tests due to the freezing weather of that day.\n\nIn conclusion, mobile phone base stations, electric commuter trains, and high voltage transmission lines appear to cause no problems for patients with bipolar pacemakers. However, an appropriate risk assessment or its update is necessary at the workplace after an employee has a pacemaker implanted or its generator changed, as well as after every major alteration to its programmed settings."
