        "meta_description": "The Finnish Transport and Communications Agency Traficom has awarded approximately EUR 39 million in discretionary government transfers for public transport to 19 competent public transport authorities in Finland. In addition to annual basic subsidies, discretionary government transfers have been awarded for climate-based measures and public transport measures in accordance with land use, housing and transport (MAL) agreements. Climate-based discretionary government transfers promote the implementation and operation of clean public transport fleets, especially electric buses.",

        "text": "Traficom has awarded approximately EUR 39.1 million in discretionary government transfers for public transport to competent authorities in Finland. This year, the transfers were not awarded for loss of transport ticket income due to the COVID-19 pandemic in contrast to the two previous years.\n\n“Even though public transport has experienced significant financial challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years, it is wonderful that the use of clean power sources, especially electric buses, is growing rapidly. The number of passengers has also exceeded pre-pandemic figures at times,\" says Special Adviser Toni Bärman.\n\nAs a rule, discretionary government transfers for public transport are awarded for public transport procurement. The MAL agreements valid in seven regions strongly steer the allocation of these transfers. The first agreement periods of the MAL agreements are scheduled to end in 2023, and the preparations for new agreements are already under way.\n\nNumber of electric buses grows rapidly – Mostly in the Helsinki region\n\nClimate-based discretionary government transfers for public transport have been used to support the authorities that have started using clean power sources in public transport. The number of electric buses, in particular, has increased considerably. In 2023, the number of line kilometres operated with electric buses, i.e. performance, will be approximately 20% of the total performance of all authorities that received discretionary government transfers for public transport.\n\n“The largest number of electric buses operate in the Helsinki region, where their performance accounts for roughly one fourth of bus transport. The first Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY Centres) to start electric bus transport are the South Ostrobothnia and Southwest Finland ELY Centres, which were just awarded support,\" Bärman says.\n\nClimate-based funding is also directed towards public transport marketing campaigns to promote the use of public transport."
