        "text": "MSc Traction is a European expert in rolling stock, specialising in auxiliary power converters and battery chargers for trams, locomotives and different train cars. The endurance of MSc solutions has been tested in the demanding climate of northern Europe, as well as in the heat of the Middle East, and the busy tracks of central Europe. Numerous train and tramcar manufacturers in Europe benefit from MSc’s know-how.\n\nRail power supply solutions\n\nMSc has a long experience in auxiliary power converters, battery chargers and energy storage systems with an extraordinary efficiency-to-volume-to-weight ratio, and adapted to the needs of our clients. MSc technology is in use globally in very different usage environments.\n\nDifferent applications of MSc rolling stock converter solutions include:\n\nPower supply for air conditioning and heater systems\n\nBattery chargers\n\nPower supply for air pressure compressors\n\nPower supply for cooler fans\n\nPower supply for passenger electricity grid in railroad cars\n\nPower supply for kitchen devices in restaurant cars\n\nEnergy storage solutions, brake energy storage, and uninterruptible motor drives\n\nRolling stock auxiliary power converters\n\nMSc auxiliary power converters are small sized. Thanks to their modular structure they are easily applicable to customer-specific needs in the demanding circumstances of rolling stock. The mechanical and functional structures are designed considering the long lifecycle the devices will have. The MSc product assortment comprises a wide AC and DC input voltage range, and the solution can comprise various different AC and DC outputs.\n\nWith MSc auxiliary power converters travelling comfort is improved, and the safe functioning of railway cars and engines is secured. Different applications include air conditioning and heater devices, batteries, cooler fans, air pressure compressors, and kitchen devices in restaurant cars.\n\nBattery chargers for rail cars\n\nMSc battery chargers generate high-quality direct voltage for charging batteries and for other loads. Our battery chargers are small sized and light units, making them easy to install in the cars. MSc can take advantage of its reliable solutions, that time and experience have proven successful, and from the enduring mechanical structures of its solutions, when planning battery chargers that always fulfil the special demands of rolling stock and of the long life-expectancy of the chargers. Thanks to their modularity, the devices can be used according to different client needs in 24V, 72V, or 110V ranges.\n\nEnergy storage systems\n\nMSc has a wide assortment of supercapacitor-based energy storage modules, which can be used with MSc converters in different rolling stock applications. MSc products are built with the newest supercapacitor technology, and include all demanded safety, control and surveillance features.\n\nOur energy storage systems are used in recovery of braking energy, in supporting rail network and in uninterruptible motor drives. MSc products are modular and cover energy storage needs from 10kJ all the way up to 1,200mJ. They are designed to function in a power range of 10kW to 100kW."
