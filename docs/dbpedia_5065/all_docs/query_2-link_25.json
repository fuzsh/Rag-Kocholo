        "text": "A Schengen visa is an entry permit for a short, temporary visit of less than 90 days in any 180-day period. See A visa to visit Finland and visa requirement and travel documents accepted by Finland.\n\nIf you travel in the morning of 6 May, we recommend taking the Viking Line ferry line from Tallinn, as the Katajanokka Terminal is more conveniently located in the city center at a walking distance from the National Archives. you can easily walk, or take the tram number 4 or 5. If there is queue to the tram and/or wait time, it is faster to walk. Walking takes 25 minutes.\n\nIf you choose to arrive with Eckerö Line or Tallink, the ferries arrive at Helsinki West Terminal. Here's a link to the Journey Planner and Google Maps to arrive from that direction. Public transport takes 30 minutes while walking will take 55 minutes.\n\nHelsinki Airport is connected to the city centre by train. The train can be taken to either direction from the Airport station (ticket zone C), and takes around half an hour. It arrives at the Central Railway Station (ticket zone A). The National Archives can be reached by foot from the Central Railway Station.\n\nHelsinki is a walkable city, and our venues are concentrated in a small area on the first day. The second day location is not that far either.\n\nIf you wish to use public transport (trams/subway/ferries/trains/buses), you'll need to buy the ticket before boarding - tickets are not sold inside the vehicles. There are some ticket machines and kiosks, but it's more convenient to use the HSL app to buy the ticket.\n\nIf you want to cycle, which is often the fastest way to move in downtown Helsinki, you can use the citybike system.\n\nYou can download the HSL application that provides both the tickets and a journey planner.\n\nIn case it's more practical, you can buy tickets for multiple people on one phone.\n\nYou have the choice of single tickets and day tickets. The ticket zones AB are enough for all travel downtown:\n\nA single ticket costs 2,95 € and for 80 minutes allows you to board new vehicles and enter to the subway system.\n\nOne-day ticket 9,00 €\n\nTwo-day ticket 13,50 €\n\nIt's unlikely that you would need tickets beyond single tickets during the program. You can use the same public transport ticket to travel by tram, bus, metro, commuter train, light rail and the Suomenlinna ferry.\n\nIf you go to the airport (in zone C) from downtown Helsinki (zone A), you'll need the ticket zones ABC, which costs a little more.\n\nYou can use the citybikes if you register and pay 5 € per day or 10 € per week. You can see the bicycles and their stations also in the HSL app.\n\nWe have not made arrangements for accommodation, but here are some tips we have collected.\n\nAikatalo Hostel Helsinki City Center is in the very center of the city. They have shared rooms for 2 (99€/night), 3 (119€/night), 4 (129€/night), 5 (139€/night) and 6 (169€/night) people.\n\nHostel Suomenlinna on Suomenlinna Island is a perfect addition to the Market Square experience. The ferries to the island leave from right in front of Allas Sea Pool and take 15 minutes.\n\nThere is a wide variety of hotels and AirBnBs to choose from.\n\nThe currency in Finland is Euro. Contactless credit and debit cards can be used everywhere, also in the marketplace. Some places will not accept cash at all.\n\nIn Finland, power plugs and sockets of type F (Schuko) are used. The standard voltage is 230 V at a frequency of 50 Hz. Type C sockets may exist in some places, where it is possible to use type F plugs, since they are compatible. Type C sockets are not grounded."
