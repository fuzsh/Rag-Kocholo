Weather-wise, this means that the outdoors temperature can be somewhere between 6°C and 18°C (43° - 64°F). Helsinki is located near the sea – which means that it is often very windy and it feels like it is colder than it shows on the thermometer. Compared to other parts of the world, it is not as humid in Finland although it rains a lot during autumn. It is recommended to bring a both wind- and waterproof jacket and a sweater. The mornings and evenings can be very chilly in September. You can check the weather forecast here: https://www.foreca.com/Finland/Helsinki?lang=en\n\nPower plugs, sockets and adapters\n\nIn Finland the standard voltage is 230 V, the standard frequency is 50 Hz, and the power sockets that are used are of type F. Read more here: http://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/finland/\n\nCurrency and ATMs\n\nThe currency in Finland is euros (€). You can exchange money at the airport in the arrivals hall 2A and at e.g. Forex bank offices. There is a Forex in the Central Railway Station for example. Finnish banks limitedly offers or do not offer this cash changing service.\n\nThe ATMs available in Finland are called OTTO and Nosto and can be found in department stores like Stockmann and Sokos, outside bank offices, in shopping centres like Kamppi and Kämp Galleria. You can pay with credit or debit cards at most places (even small amounts).\n\nTime\n\nThe local time in Helsinki during the summer is Eastern European Summer Time – EEST.\n\nTelephone instructions\n\nThe country code for Finland is +358. The emergency phone number is 112.\n\nInternet access\n\nRoaming within Europe is generally free, but check with your internet provider to be sure. Most hotels and cafés provide free Wi-Fi for their customers.\n\nYou will receive a Hanken login for the partner day on Sunday. Eduroam is also available.\n\nTap water – can I drink it?\n\nThe answer to that question is yes –you can drink cold tap water everywhere. Drinking tap water is an everyday privilege we enjoy. Tap water is even said to be better than bottled water. However, you should not drink warm or hot tap water nor make instant coffee or tea with it.\n\nShops' opening hours\n\nShops in Helsinki are usually open 9-21 during weekdays, 10-16 or 18 on Saturdays and 12-18 on Sundays.\n\nKamppi shopping centre opening hours\n\n9-21 on weekdays, 9-19 on Saturdays and 12-18 on Sundays\n\nKämp Galleria opening hours\n\n8-20 on weekdays, 10-18 on Saturdays and 12-18 on Sundays\n\nForum shopping centre opening hours\n\n10-21 on weekdays, 10-19 on Saturdays and 12-18 on Sundays\n\nDepartment stores Stockmann (Alexanterinkatu) and Sokos (Mannerheimintie) opening hours\n\n9-21 on weekdays, 9-19 on Saturdays and 11-18 on Sundays.\n\nSome of the grocery shops are open 24h, e.g S-Market Sokos (on Mannerheimintie).\n\nPrice level of dining\n\nEating out in Finland is rather expensive. However, service and VAT are always included in the prices, so tipping is not required. If you think that you have received extra good service in e.g. a restaurant you can tip, but there is no rule how much you should tip. The VAT is also included in the price for groceries, clothes, gifts etc.\n\nSome examples:\n\nCappuccino/Latte 4-4,50€\n\nThree-course menu 40-80€/person (drinks not included)\n\nHamburger at McDonalds: 1 - 5,45€\n\nCoke/Pepsi (0.33 litre bottle): 1.30 – 3.00€\n\nIn restaurants, it is perfectly fine to ask the waiter to split the bill and for everyone at the table to pay for their own food and drinks.\n\nBilingualism\n\nFinland has two main official languages. The majority of the population (87,9%) speak Finnish as their mother tongue and Swedish is spoken by 5,2% of the population (Statistics Finland, 2019). You notice the bilingualism in everyday life: all official documentation, road signs, street names, local transportation stops etc. are written in both Finnish and Swedish.\n\nAt Hanken we speak Swedish and English with colleagues, faculty and students.\n\nThe Sauna culture\n\nFinland is known for having invented the sauna. It is very common for Finnish families to have a sauna of their own and you always find saunas at public indoor swimming halls and at the gym. In Helsinki, there is even a sauna for rent in one of the internationally famous hamburger restaurants.\n\nOur sources for information and facts about the happiest country in the world\n\nVisit Finland Opens in new window\n\nThis is Finland Opens in new window\n\nThis is Finland – Statistics Opens in new window\n\nMy Helsinki Opens in new window\n\nThe ministry for foreign affair’s toolbox Opens in new window (for facts about Finland)\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nPublic transportation in Helsinki\n\nHelsinki Region Transportation (HSL) manages the local transportation. At their web site https://www.hsl.fi/en Opens in new window you can search for and plan your route around Helsinki region by tram, metro, bus, regional train, city bikes and the ferry to Suomenlinna.\n\nThe EAIE conference has arranged free regional public transportation tickets (HSL travel cards) for registered participants between 23rd and 27th of September. With the HSL travel card you can use the public transportation in Helsinki and the surrounding towns Espoo, Kauniainen and Vantaa. The airport is situated in Vantaa. The HSL ticket does not include the Finnair city bus.\n\nHelsinki region uses zone tickets (AB, BC, ABC, ABCD) and the price vary depending on how many zones you cross. Depending on when you arrive, you may perhaps want to buy a single ABC ticket to get to the city centre on Saturday and additionally buy 1-2 single tickets within the AB (Helsinki) zone for Sunday. A single ticket in the AB zone costs 2,80€ and is valid for 80 minutes and a day ticket in this zone costs 8€ and is valid for 24h. You may purchase the tickets with credit card.\n\nThere are also very good biking opportunities within Helsinki, and walking is very common. Renting a city bike costs 5€ for a day, 10 € for a week and 30€ for the whole season. You can ride an unlimited number of 30-minute rides by bike without extra cost.\n\nUse “Reittiopas Opens in new window ” route planning service for public transportation within the Helsinki region by typing in the address from where you are leaving and to where you are going. It will provide you different options of how to get from A to B (e.g. “Helsinki-Vantaa airport” and “Hanken School of Economics”).

The trains take you to the central railway station (centre of Helsinki). You need to buy an ABC zone ticket (single ticket 4,60€, valid for 110min or day ticket 12€, valid for 24h) from the automat at the terminal, BEFORE entering the train. You can purchase the ticket with credit card. No tickets are sold on the train.

The train ride to the city center takes approx. 30 min.\n\nFinnair city bus\n\nThe Finnair City Bus departs from right outside of the terminal every 20-30 min and takes you to the city center. The ride takes about 30-35 min and costs 6,90€. The Finnair city bus accepts credit cards and you can buy tickets on the bus or online. The end stop is the central railway station in the centre of Helsinki, from where you can walk, take a taxi or tram to your hotel.\n\nTaxi\n\nTravelling by taxi is expensive in Finland.

All taxis accept credit cards.\n\nOther options are Uber Opens in new window or Yango Opens in new window for lower faires.
