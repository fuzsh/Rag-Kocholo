The conference venue is the main building of Aalto University School of Business, situated near Helsinki city center.\n\nThere are lots of direct flights to Helsinki Airport, especially from Europe and Asia. Here are some examples of destinations and flight times: Beijing 7:50h, Tokyo 9:45h, New York 8:40h, Chicago 9:15h, London 3:10h, and Frankfurt 2:40h.\n\nThere is a direct train connection from Helsinki Airport to the central railway station. The conference venue is just a 15-minute walk from the central railway station. There are tram lines that connect the conference venue, the central railway station, and many hotels and tourist attractions in the downtown area. You can also try Helsinki city bikes â there is a city bike station next to the conference venue.\n\nWe have reserved room blocks in several hotels for ALGO 2018 participants; see the hotel information page for more details on how to book a room.\n\nYou can find more information on travelling and practicalities on this page below the map.\n\nMap\n\nSource: Guide Map of Helsinki Metropolitan Area. The maintainer of the dataset is Helsingin kaupunkiympÃ¤ristÃ¶n toimiala / Kaupunkimittauspalvelut and the original author is Helsingin kaupunkiympÃ¤ristÃ¶n toimiala. The dataset has been downloaded from Helsinki Region Infoshare service on 05.06.2018 using the license Creative Commons Attribution 4.0.\n\nPlease see our map page for additional maps.\n\nGetting to Helsinki\n\nThe right airport is Helsinki Airport (“HEL”).\n\nYou can also arrive to Helsinki by train from St. Petersburg (3.5h), or take a ferry from Tallinn (a couple of hours) or Stockholm (overnight) â see VR for information on train connections and e.g. Tallink or Viking Line for information on ferries.\n\nGetting to Helsinki city center\n\nThere is a direct train connection from Helsinki Airport to the central railway station. The trip takes 30â35 minutes and costs 4.20 or 5.00 euros, depending on how you buy your ticket.\n\nAt the airport, follow the train symbols to find the train station; along the way there are also ticket vending machines. At the airport train station, you can take any train going in any direction; it will take you to the central railway station, which is the last stop.\n\nBuy tickets before boarding the airport train. There are regular ticket inspections, so make sure you have a ticket with you. You will need to buy a regional ticket to travel between the airport and the city center. There are two ways to buy tickets:\n\nTicket vending machine: the machines are blue and have an HSL logo.\n\nMobile phone app: you will need to install HSL app on your mobile phone.\n\nA single regional ticket should cost 5.00 euros in a ticket-vending machine and 4.20 euros if you use the mobile app.\n\nOn your way back, board the next P or I train at the central railways station; it will take you to the airport train station (“Lentoasema” in Finnish). For train timetables and other public transport options from the airport, see this page. If you arrive very late or leave very early, taking a taxi might be the simplest option.\n\nGetting to the conference venue\n\nThe street address of the conference venue is Runeberginkatu 14â16, Helsinki; see our maps for the exact location. This is the main building of the Aalto University School of Business; simply searching for “Aalto University School of Business” on Google Maps should find it.\n\nThe venue is just a 15-minute walk from the central railway station. You can follow the “Arkadiankatu” street from the railway station. Most hotels and the main tourist attractions are also within a walking distance.\n\nThere are also plenty of public transport options available. Perhaps the most useful is tram line 2; our maps show a part of the route and the most relevant stops. For some hotels that are a bit further away, metro train (underground) is also useful; the metro station closest to the conference venue is called “Kamppi”.\n\nPlease see the venue page for more details on the building.\n\nMore information on public transport\n\nCheck the HSL route maps and the HSL Journey Planner for more information on public transport options in Helsinki; Google Maps is also usually well up-to-date regarding routes and timetables in Helsinki.\n\nAll local trains, metro, trams, buses, and the ferry to Suomenlinna use the same ticket system â see HSL web pages for information on the ticket prices. Helsinki Airport is located outside Helsinki, so you will need a regional ticket for the airport train connection, while for most other trips a Helsinki internal ticket is fine. Ticket vending machines also sell tram tickets that are valid for one tram trip, as well as day tickets and multi-day tickets. Buy tickets before boarding. Single tickets are usually valid for approx. 1 hour from the moment you bought it; there is no need to validate it separately. Here are some examples of ticket prices:\n\nsingle tram ticket, from a ticket vending machine: 2.50 euros\n\nsingle Helsinki internal ticket, using mobile app: 2.20 euros\n\nsingle Helsinki internal ticket, from a ticket vending machine: 2.90 euros\n\nsingle regional ticket, using mobile app: 4.20 euros\n\nsingle regional ticket, from a ticket vending machine: 5.00 euros\n\n1-day Helsinki internal ticket, from a ticket vending machine: 9.00 euros\n\n1-day regional ticket, from a ticket vending machine: 14.00 euros\n\nYou can also try out Helsinki city bikes. It is best to register in advance to get the access code.\n\nSee the Getting Around section of myhelsinki.fi for more information on public transport in Helsinki.\n\nBying tickets with the HSL mobile app\n\nWe recommend that you use the HSL app on your mobile phone to buy public transport tickets.\n\nEven if you do not have a data plan in your mobile phone, you can still use the app to buy tickets at the conference venue: connect to the wifi network at the conference venue and buy a ticket. Once you have got a ticket, it should work fine even if you do not have Internet access during the trip.\n\nThe app can also produce a PDF receipt for your purchase if you need it for your travel expense claim.\n\nFinding a ticket vending machine\n\nPlease see the HSL sales point map for the locations of the ticket vending machines.\n\nNote that not all tram stops have ticket vending machines; however, there is usually one nearby. In addition to the dedicated ticket vending machines, there are also numerous parking meters that also sell public transport tickets.\n\nPlease see our map page for the detailed maps of the surroundings of the conference venue and the Market Square; we have indicated there the locations of the nearest ticket vending machines. There is also a ticket vending machine along the way from the conference banquet to the nearest tram stop.\n\nThe parking meters accept Visa and MasterCard (no cash). Some ticket vending machines accept also cash, but having a credit or debit card is the safest option.\n\nTaxis\n\nYou will probably not need a taxi, unless you are arriving at the airport around 1amâ5am.\n\nPlease be advised that the Finnish taxi law drastically changed on 1 July 2018, and while taxis were previously highly regulated, nowadays taxi companies can freely choose their own prices. Check the prices before taking a taxi. A typical taxi fee for 1â4 persons from the airport to the city center is 39Â e.\n\nUber also launched their service in Helsinki in July 2018.\n\nPracticalities\n\nAccommodation: See the hotel information page.\n\nBorder control: Finland is part of Schengen Area.\n\nElectricity: Power sockets are similar to those used in Germany; the flat Europlug always fits.\n\nEmergencies: Call 112.\n\nMoney: Euros. Credit cards and debit cards are generally accepted everywhere, even for small purchases. If you need cash, look for a yellow “Otto.” sign to locate an ATM. For currency exchange, Forex at the central railway station is a good option.\n\nPharmacy: “Apteekki” in Finnish. Yliopiston Apteekki (address: Mannerheimintie 5) is open from 7am to midnight.\n\nShopping: Try e.g. Stockmann department store or Kamppi and Forum shopping centers. Large department stores are typically open MonâFri 9amâ9pm, Sat 9amâ7pm, and Sun 12pmâ6pm; small grocery stores have more flexible opening hours. S-market Sokos Helsinki next to the central railway station is open 24/7.\n\nTap water: Perfectly good to drink; there is no need to buy bottled water.\n\nTime zone: Eastern European time, 1 hour ahead of Central Europe. See timeanddate.com for the current local time.\n\nTipping: Never expected in restaurants or elsewhere.\n\nTourist information: myhelsinki.fi.\n\nWeather: See the FMI weather forecast for the current weather.\n\nIf you have any questions about practicalities related to your visit to Helsinki, please feel free to email us at algo2018@aalto.fi.\n\nInternet access\n\nThere are two wireless networks available in the conference building:\n\naalto open: free and open for everyone, no login needed.\n\neduroam: if you use Eduroam at your home university, it will work precisely the same way here as well.\n\nThere is a free wifi at the airport: select the network Helsinki Airport Free Wi-Fi, click on the “Connect to free WiFi” button in the login screen, and you should be online â you do not need to enter any personal information.\n\nPrepaid SIM cards with data plans are cheap in Finland."
