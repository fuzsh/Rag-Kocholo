        "text": "I used to have a proper job before turning into a brain merchant. Not an oyster pirate or a seawolf though. In the mornings, I collected shipbuilders from the streets of Helsinki workers quarters and drove them through the poshest parts of the city to W채rtsil채 shipyard in a HKL tram. It was the line 1A. If I were to draw that troll today again and release the catch at what is now the Arctech shipyard gate, a bunch of startled hipsters running around would be produced. How they measure up, welding the hull with lights of their iSomethings is up to discussion. Odds are the people at shipyard would want me to drive them back.\n\nAt the time, line 1A was operated with 4-axles from 1959. Trams 1-15 of the series were built by Karia and they had a lovely feel of Detroit-produced cars of the same era with their soft, swinging suspension. Numbers 16-30...well...were constructed by a state-owned tractor factory, born out of need at time to pay war reparations to the Soviets. Ah, that's an unfair implication. Both series were identical on paper, save few details but 16-30 simply did not have that feel of 1-15.\n\nControls in both models were electromechanical. Series of high-voltage/current electromagnetic contactors, controlled by the driver's lever, was known as the Grand Piano. Power electronics at that time was highly immobile and it was the mercury arc rectifier at the substation, supplying 600VDC between the overhead wires and the tracks. Here is one in operation. They would make an excellent ingredient for horror movies and nightmares. Every evil genius should have one on this season. See how the thing comes alive when the driver increases the motor current. Modern solid state rectifiers at tram line substations do not make such a number of themselves but I'm sure the mercury arcs are nothing short of reaching consciousness. I remember seeing one discarded unit at Koskela tram depot that used to feed the K채pyl채 section of the 1/1A line. You would love the midnight stories of that eerie blue glow suddenly emanating through the ventilation grill at back of the rail yard, while the last tram was out of the section hours ago.\n\nDriving 1959 4-axle is essentially switching the motors in series, shunting current limiting resistors one by one off the circuit, switching motors in parallel, shunting resistors one by one off the circuit again and if you still feel you are not going fast enough, you shunt a part of the field windings of the motor to trade torque for rpm at a constant line voltage. After this, the Zen of tram driving takes place: You switch off the motor circuit completely. Let the inertia and the low rolling friction on rails work their magic. Hear the wheels and wind. Smell the winos on the back seats, heading to night shelter at the corner of Pursimiehenkatu and Albertinkatu. When approaching the next stop, switch in the 24V batteries to wake up the magnetic fields in the motors again and turn them into resistor-loaded generators braking the tram. Pull the lever further. One by one, the brake resistors are shunted until at 5km/h the generators are completely short-circuited and the tram is brought to final stop by pneumatic brakes. This is just a scratch on the surface. The Zen of tram driving is a big topic worth of its own article some time in the future.\n\nAll the resistors on the roof of a 4-axle keep the tram interior warm in the winter but from May to August in Helsinki, it is wasted power. You would still do one line kilometre with 3.15kWh of electric energy though which is pretty impressive for a 20 metric ton vehicle but the city is growing and they need to move on to 30 ton 6-axle joint trams with 190 passanger places. Solution to power-wasting resistors was the motor control by pulse width modulation (PWM), where the motors are switched on and off very quickly. If the motor is on for 1ms and off for 4ms it is equivalent of having 20% of the line voltage on the circuit with no resistors needed to reduce the voltage. If the switch transitions are quick and the on-state resistance is small, very little power is wasted in the process. At the time of the mercury arc rectifier, there were no fast enough switching devices capable of handling the hundreds of amperes of motor current. OK, maybe a thyratron, a thyristor-kind-of a thermionic or cold cathode device, would have done the job but back in the 50's they were strategic stuff for the radar transmitters.\n\nNowadays, there are the power-FET's and IGBT's up to the task but the first high-current solid-state device was thyristor. The problem with a thyristor is that once triggered conducting, it will conduct until there is no voltage difference between its anode and cathode. In a DC circuit, it will conduct ad infinitum unless a cunning scheme is devised to tell the thyristor to cut it out and that's the show on Electron Circus today. It's the resonant commutation.\n\nHere is a napkin schematic of a resonant commutation drive. At the first stage, both thyristors are off and the capacitor C is charged to -600V line voltage. Then the main thyristor Thm is triggered and the current starts flowing through the motor. Depending on desired pulse width, the motor current must be cut off sooner or later. When the time is right, auxiliary thyristor Tha is triggered and C starts to discharge through the inductor L as in your usual series resonant LC circuit. Voltage across C goes to zero and the initial energy of the capacitor minus the losses is now in the magnetic field of L. Inductor maintains the current direction until the capacitor is charged again almost to the initial but reversed voltage. Now the trick happens. Capacitor discharges once more through the inductor but the reversed current cuts off the thyristor Tha. The only path left for the LC circuit current is through the thyristor Thm and diodes D1 and D2. Peak current in the resonant circuit is greater than the motor current but in reverse direction so Thm cuts off. C charges back to the initial voltage through the diodes and the circuit is ready for the next PWM cycle. That's how to produce PWM at times when the switching devices available to you can only be turned on by a control signal, not off.\n\nPWM control with resonant commutation thyristor drive was first implemented in 6-axle joint trams of 1973 (numbers 31-70 of the series). These and the newer 1980's series (numbers 71-112) are still in operation though heavily renovated and modified.\n\nAt this point of the show, a reluctant idea is always dragged to the arena of the Electron Circus. This time we propose a solution to a particular problem in resonant commutation drives. Of course, everybody is already using IGBT's and power-FET's so they do not encounter this problem to begin with and the idea presented here is only few decades late of the heyday of the resonant commutation drives but hey, who cares. When the civilisation some day is started again from sticks, we have the Resonant Commutation 2.0 already figured out and waiting for its moment to rule the world at reinvention of the thyristor (Mwahaha with a mercury arc on).\n\nPicture a typical winter weather in Helsinki with sub-zero temperature and supercooled water raining. When a raindrop hits any surface, such as an overhead wire, it freezes immediately. A couple of hours after the line traffic ends at night, the wires have a thick icing preventing the carbon strips of the pantograph from making a good electrical contact to the wire. A 1959 4-axle would come through the snow and ice and illuminate the whole block with a huge crackling arc at the wire contact but the main thyristor of resonant commutation drive tends to cut off too early and the driver has to use very low current to get the tram barely moving, if at all. State-of-the-art solution was the Operation Frostwire. A 4-axle would drive all the lines through before the regular service hours and plow away the ice from the wires. Now Resonant Commutation 2.0 would involve a burst triggering of the main thyristor. Multiple pulses would trigger the thyristor again, if it cuts off too early due to the bad contact between the pantograph and the overhead wire. All participants of the Operation Frostwire over the years can now receive their walnut plaques and steer patiently towards the seniority and retirement.\n\nBack to a winter morning in a 4-axle operating 1A. A Volkswagen beetle is parked too close to the tracks with no space for the tram to pass. Only 3 street stone widths from the rail and it would have been OK but no. Drivers head scratching is pregnant of a message. 15 grim looking guys with their lunch boxes about to miss the card punch at the shipyard gate. Freshly plowed snow is piled 2 meters high at the street corner. Not a word spoken, the guys lift up the beetle and place it on the top of the snow pile. Everybody back in. Time to move on. Not a minute too late at the gate.\n\nSome resonant commuters."
