        "text": "MAC Products Electrified Transit Division is a leader in the electrical manufacturing industry, specializing in the design and production of accessories, components, and systems for the transportation industry.\n\nWe are the source for Mass Transit power distribution accessories and systems, offering a full line of products and services designed to meet the needs of transit system operators, OEMs, repair shops and associated operations. MAC builds electromechanical devices for rapid transit and locomotive propulsion systems and manufactures a wide range of electrical components for use in the transmission of power to third-rail and catenary systems and products for heavy rail, light rail, and people-moving systems.\n\nThe Industries we support include: Diesel-electric locomotive manufacturers and Repair Shops, Light Rail and Third Rail mass transit, and Electrical Transit construction.\n\nOur state of the art facilities, equipped with advanced computerized systems and CNC metalworking technology, and highly experienced engineering, technical and craftsmen, and their unique combination of skills have been pivotal to the successful production of high-quality products that meet the ongoing demand and requirements of the industries we serve.\n\nThrough a partnership and manufacturing agreement with Kummler+Matter of Zurich, Switzerland; MAC offers the Adaptable Railway Cantilever System (ARCAS) for light rail, tram, electric trolley bus, streetcar and commuter railway systems to customers in North America.\n\nARCAS is a modular system consisting of multi-functional components. This modularity, together with the system’s compatibility with existing products, makes it easy to implement conversions to overhead electrification systems.\n\nMAC Products supplies the Tensorex Spring Tensioner. This product is an innovative tensioning device for Overhead Catenary Systems (OCS) that provides constant pull force on the messenger and contact wires while compensating for its elongation or contraction due to temperature variation. Through our partnership with Pfisterer, this tensioning device offers several significant advantages over a traditional balance weight assembly. It is safer because the device is mounted at the wire termination height, which is away from pedestrian reach. It is more compact and lighter, which translates to reduced installation time and visual impact. It is also a cost-effective solution as the unit is self-contained, requires no maintenance and easy to transport to the installation location.\n\nThe Tensorex Spring Tensioner is expected to provide long uninterrupted service based on the intense tests that it was subjected to - fatigue, ultimate tensile strength, snap release, efficiency and salt spray.\n\nThrough a partnership and manufacturing agreement with Kummler+Matter of Zurich, Switzerland; MAC offers the Adaptable Railway Cantilever System (ARCAS) for light rail, tram, electric trolley bus, streetcar and commuter railway systems to customers in North America.\n\nARCAS is a modular system consisting of multi-functional components.

The OCR system can be complementary to OCS in instances where clearance is an issue or where tensioning the wires is impractical, as in the case of tunnels, bridges or maintenance facilities. The OCR can be designed to be retractable when not in use. The messenger wire is no longer required and maintenance of the OCR is minimal.\n\nMAC engineers, manufactures and supplies the complete OCS system; cantilevers, balance weight assemblies, fixed terminations, head spans, pull-off assemblies, mid-point anchor assemblies, section insulators, jumper assemblies, hanger assemblies, pole brackets and disconnect switches.\n\nMAC Products has worked with a broad range of OCS contractors in the United States, on many varied projects over the last 20+ years. These projects have incorporated the design, manufacture, and installation of the complete light rail system. Recent projects that MAC has been involved with are:"
