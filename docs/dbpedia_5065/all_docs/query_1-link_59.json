        "text": "Last year, three lines Americans have been waiting on for decades—the Green Line extension in Boston, the Crenshaw Line in Los Angeles, and the Silver Line to Dulles Airport outside Washington—finally opened. Though they took years to be completed, they were greeted enthusiastically by riders and political officials content to bring better service to more people.\n\nSimilar reception greeted new rail and bus lines opening in Athens, Cairo, Guadalajara, Helsinki, Paris, and dozens of other cities around the world. And much more is planned for 2023: Finally, Long Island Rail Road service will reach the sub-sub-sub-basement of Grand Central Terminal. Toronto’s Eglinton light rail line will connect the city crosstown. And Honolulu, Gebze, Riyadh, Tel Aviv, and Thessaloniki will get their first metro services.\n\nThis year, I leveraged data assembled in the Transit Explorer database to identify which projects opened in 2022, which are planned for opening in 2023, and which will be under construction this year—for a later opening date.\n\nOn separate posts, I analyzed trends in transit investments around the world and examined accessibility to transit stations in the US versus Canada, England, and France.\n\nThe Transit Explorer database now includes all fixed–guideway urban transit systems (meaning rail and bus rapid transit) across North America, South America, Africa, and nine Western European countries, plus metro systems throughout Europe and in parts of the Middle East. Transit Explorer now includes about 29,200 urban transit stations and about 6,700 urban transit lines (covering 78,000 kilometers). (It also includes some intercity rail systems.) These are the geographies for which I provide details about transit line openings below.\n\nData can be viewed freely on Transit Explorer or purchased for non-commercial use in Shapefile, GeoJSON, and CSV formats for those who would like to use the data for research or other uses, such as in Excel, R, ArcGIS, or QGIS.\n\nPrevious compilations of new and planned transit projects on The Transport Politic can be found here: 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022\n\nNew transit investments completed in 2022\n\nOverall, 517 kilometers of new fixed-guideway urban transit services opened in 2022 across the countries covered by the Transit Explorer database. Of these, the countries with the largest increases in kilometers were the United States (196 kilometers); Egypt (77 kilometers); Mexico (60 kilometers); France (39 kilometers); and the United Kingdom (34 kilometers).\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nBaku: 2 km Purple Line metro extension from Avtovagzal to Khojasan\n\nCanada\n\nMontreal: Creation of 11 km SRB Pie-IX bus rapid transit route through the east side of the city\n\nDenmark\n\nOdense: Creation of 14 km first phase of the Letbane tramway system\n\nEgypt\n\nCairo:\n\nLine 3 metro extension west to Kit Kat (4 km)\n\nCreation of 72 km Cairo Light Rail system (really a metro system) heading east into the new capital area\n\nFinland\n\nHelsinki: 7 km extension of the M1 metro line\n\nFrance\n\nParis:\n\nM4 extension 1.8 km south to Bagneux\n\nM12 extension 1.9 km north to Aubervilliers\n\nCreation of 19 km Tramway 13 Express, a new circumferential line on the west side of the region\n\nRennes: Creation of new 13 km Line B automated light metro\n\nToulouse: Creation of 3 km Teleo aerial tram line\n\nGreece\n\nAthens: Extension of metro line 3 by 3 km\n\nItaly\n\nMilan: Opening of the first phase of automated M4 light metro, 5.5 km from the airport into the city\n\nIsrael\n\nHaifa: Creation of Rakavlit aerial tram line (4 km)\n\nLuxembourg\n\nLuxembourg: Extension of T1 tramway by 1.2 km to the south\n\nMauritius\n\nPort Louis: 10 km extension of the Metro Express light rail system to the south\n\nMexico\n\nGuadalajara: Creation of 41.5 km Mi Macro Periferico bus rapid transit line, a circumferential route around the city\n\nMexico: 18 km extension of Mexibus Linea 1 bus rapid transit line in the northern suburbs\n\nPoland\n\nWarsaw: Extension of M2 metro line west and east, totaling 6 km\n\nSpain\n\nValencia: Creation of L10 tramway, 5 km\n\nTurkiye\n\nBursa: Creation of 8 km T2 tramway line\n\nIstanbul:\n\n8 km extension of M4 to Asian-side airport\n\n1.5 km extension of M7\n\nCreation of F4 funicular system, a 1 km line\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nBirmingham: 1.3 km extension of the West Midlands Metro light rail system through the centre city\n\nLondon:\n\nOpening of Elizabeth Line regional rail central segment, a 28 km route, mostly in subway, through the center of the city\n\nExtension of the 4.5 km extension of the Overground to Barking Riverside\n\nUnited States\n\nBirmingham: Creation of 16 km Xpress BRT route, which includes some dedicated bus lanes\n\nBoston: Opening of Green Line extension into Somerville and Medford, along two branches, totaling 7 km\n\nEl Paso: Creation of 31 km Brio Montana arterial rapid transit route\n\nLos Angeles: Opening of 10 km first phase of K/Crenshaw Line, a light rail route extending from the Expo Line\n\nMinneapolis: Opening of 27 km D Line arterial rapid transit route\n\nPhiladelphia: 5 km extension of SEPTA Regional Rail to Wawa\n\nPhoenix: Opening of 5.5 km Tempe Streetcar\n\nPortland: Opening of 24 km Division Frequent Express bus rapid transit route\n\nSt. Petersburg: Creation of SunRunner Central Avenue BRT, a 28.5 km bus rapid transit line\n\nSan Bernardino: Opening of Arrow Redlands Passenger Rail Project, a 14 km route extending Metrolink\n\nSan Francisco:\n\nOpening of 2.3 km Central Subway, a new light rail route through the city center\n\nCreation of Van Ness Avenue BRT, 3 km of dedicated bus lanes\n\nWashington DC: Opening of second phase of Silver Line, an 18 km extension that includes access to Dulles Airport\n\nPlanned 2023 openings\n\nAlmost 1,100 kilometers of fixed-guideway urban transit is planned to open in 2023 in the parts of the world covered by Transit Explorer. Of these, about half will be in the form of metro rail services. The countries with the largest expansions planned for opening are the United States (242 kilometers); Saudi Arabia (169 kilometers); Turkiye (127 kilometers); Mexico (98 kilometers); and Canada (78 kilometers). That said, all investments aren’t equal: 57 percent of new US route kilometers will be bus rapid transit or arterial rapid transit. In many other countries, new kilometers are much more likely to be metro rail or light rail services: Saudi Arabia (100 percent); Turkiye (83 percent); and Canada (93 percent).\n\nBrasil\n\nRio de
