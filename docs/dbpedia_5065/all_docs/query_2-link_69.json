        "text": "Helsinki cathedral\n\nThis page explains how to travel by train or ferry from Helsinki to other key European cities, and how to buy the cheapest tickets. Click here to for journeys starting in another city. Recommended hotels in Helsinki. Information current for 2024.\n\nI want to go from Helsinki to...\n\nBefore you buy your tickets\n\nTake a moment to read these important tips for buying European train tickets. It answers all the usual questions, \"Do I need to book in advance or can I buy at the station?\", \"Can I stop off?\", \"Are there Senior fares?\" and that old favourite, \"Should I buy an $800 railpass or a 35 point-to-point ticket?\". How far ahead can you buy train tickets?\n\nEuropean train travel FAQ\n\nTrain travel within Finland\n\nUse the Finnish Railways website www.vr.fi or VR app to check times and buy tickets for any Finnish long-distance train.\n\nYou can also book Finnish trains (but not sleepers) quickly & easily at Omio.com in , £, $ and other currencies.\n\nBookings open up to 130 days in advance.\n\nFares for mainline trains are dynamic like flights, cheaper in advance and on less popular dates and trains, more expensive closer to departure date and on more popular dates and trains. Fares for regional and suburban trains are fixed-price and can be bought on the day.\n\nYou can choose your seat from a seat map when booking at www.vr.fi. You may be offered a variety of upgrades, not just from Eko (2nd) class to Ekstra (1st) class, but private compartments or seats above the restaurant. Read the Intercity & Pendolino sections below to understand these.\n\nYou print your own ticket, collect it from the self-service machines or ticket counter at any main VR station, or show it on your phone.\n\nHelsinki station: See station guide\n\nDesigned by famous Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen, Helsinki's beautiful main station is a Helsinki attraction in its own right. You'll find the usual range of services here, ticket counters, left luggage, food stores, newsagents, restaurants and cafes. See Helsinki station guide.\n\nIntercity trains\n\nMost Finnish Intercity trains use modern double-deck trainsets like this, with a driving cab built into one end and an electric locomotive at the other. They have Eko (2nd) class and Ekstra (1st) class, a bistro car on the lower deck of one car, and a kids' playroom. There are power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. In Ekstra class there's complimentary tea & coffee and water.\n\nIn Eko class you can pay a small fee to keep the seat next to you free.\n\nOn the upper deck above the bistro is a seating area with tables for 4 on one side of the aisle and rotating sideways-facing seats on the other which can be used to work on a laptop, see the photos below - you can pay a small extra charge to sit here, you'll see the upgrade offered when you book.\n\nIn Eko class these trains have one private 2-seat compartment, one private 4-seat compartment and (at one end of the car with the playroom) one private 4-seat family compartment. You can book these compartments for sole use by paying for an Eko ticket for each passenger plus a cabin fee.\n\nIntercity train at Helsinki station.\n\nPendolino trains\n\nTilting pendolino trains operate some services. They have Eco (2nd) class and Ekstra (1st) class & a bistro car. There are power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. In Ekstra class there's a complimentary tea & coffee station. In Eko class you can pay a similar fee to keep the seat next to you free. At one end of the unit is a private 6-seat Ekstra class compartment which can be booked for sole use by paying for a ticket for each passenger plus a cabin fee.\n\nPendolino train at Helsinki station.\n\nSleeper trains to Oulu, Kemi, Rovaniemi\n\nThere are daytime trains from Helsinki to Oulu, Kemi, Rovaniemi & Kemijärvi, or you can use one of the time-effective sleeper trains, now equipped with air-conditioned double-deck sleeping-cars. All sleepers have cosy duvets, washbasin, soap & towels provided. You can choose a 1 or 2 bed compartment with washbasin, or a 1 or 2 bed compartment with toilet & shower. In an expensive country, a sleeper to Lapland can be very good value if you book ahead, compared to the cost of a hotel. A single-bed sleeper with washbasin starts from as little as 69. You can buy tickets at the Finnish Railways website www.vr.fi & print your own ticket.\n\nBack to top\n\nHelsinki to Stockholm from 21\n\nOption 1 is to take a direct overnight ferry from Helsinki to Stockholm.\n\nThis is the nicest and most laid-back experience. Boarding is a relaxed affair, starting an hour and a half before sailing time. You've the whole evening to enjoy on the ferry as she sails out of Helsinki past the fortress island of Suomenlinna and through the Finnish archipelago. Next morning there's no need to get up early, you can have a lie-in and leisurely breakfast before a punctual mid-morning arrival in Stockholm, passing many Swedish islands on the way. These ships have a reputation as party boats, especially at weekends, but you don't have to dance the night away if you don't want to. Two competing ferry companies sail overnight every day, Silja Line & Viking Line.\n\nOption 2 is to take a train from Helsinki to Turku and the shorter ferry crossing from Turku to Stockholm.\n\nThis route is significantly cheaper and several hours faster, with a similar late afternoon departure from Helsinki's magnificent central station, and a punctual 06:30 arrival in Stockholm. There's also a Helsinki-Turku-Stockholm daytime service on weekdays, see option 3. The ferry operates a daytime and overnight crossing with tight turn-rounds at each end so boarding may start as little as 15 minutes before sailing time with staff still finishing cleaning the cabins. The ferry arrives in Stockholm early morning, you may be asked to vacate your cabin even earlier so that cleaning can start. This route is certainly faster and cheaper, but the direct Stockholm-Helsinki ferries are definitely the more relaxed option, Having said that, enjoying a (tax-free, affordable) beer at the outdoor but sheltered Vista Bar as the Viking Glory sails into the sunset is such a great experience.\n\nOption 1, Helsinki to Stockholm by direct overnight ferry\n\nTwo ferry companies run luxurious overnight cruise ferries from Helsinki to Stockholm.\n\nSilja Line sails from Helsinki Olympia ferry terminal at 17:00 every day arriving Stockholm Värtahamnen Ferry Terminal at 09:45.\n\nViking Line sails from Helsinki Katajanokka ferry terminal at 17:15 every day arriving Stockholm Stadsgården ferry terminal at 10:00.\n\nSilja Line's ships are the superb Silja Serenade & Silja Symphony, entering service in 1990. Viking Line's ships are the Gabriella & Cinderella.\n\nThis is perhaps the nicest most leisurely option, with time to chill out all evening on the cruise ferry - or dance the night away, and no need to get up early next morning. You travel in a cosy en suite cabin, there are restaurants, bars, nightclub, and so on. The morning arrival into Stockholm past all the islands is superb, spend some time on deck with your camera.\n\nFares start at around 85 including private cabin with shower & toilet, but fares vary by season & day of the week.\n\nBook the ferry at the Direct Ferries website which can book & compare both Silja & Viking. The operators' own sites are www.sales.vikingline.com & www.tallinksilja.com.\n\nCabins: A, B & C class cabins are all virtually identical, but A-class is topsides (decks 5-11) with window, B-class is topsides without window, and C-class is underneath the car deck on deck 2 without window. All have 1-4 berths and en suite toilet & shower. Promenade cabins are similar to A-class but with a window overlooking the big central promenade. Deluxe cabins are more like a hotel room with twin/double bed, shower/toilet and complimentary minibar. Commodore class suites gives access to the exclusive Commodore class lounge with complimentary refreshments & a sauna. The Suites also give access to the Commodore lounge & sauna.\n\nIn Helsinki, Silja Line's Olympia terminal is an easy 1.8 km 23-minute walk from Helsinki station, see walking map. Or you can take trams 2 or 3 which arrive at their terminus just 100m the ferry terminal. At the terminal check-in is painless: Walk up to one of the self-service check-in machines, click the touch screen for English, scan the ferry ticket barcode on your phone or printout, click to confirm and out pops your ferry boarding pass which is also your cabin key. Go through the automatic gates using the boarding pass and walk onto the ferry.\n\nIn Stockholm, it's an easy well-signed 12-minute 1km walk from Silja Line's Värtahamnen ferry terminal to Gärdet Tunnelbana (metro) station, see walking map. It's then just 3 stops from Gärdet to T-Centralen (Central Station). The Tunnelbana accepts contactless bank cards, you can just touch in and out. Alternatively, taxis are available and both Silja Line & Viking Line operate transfer buses from their ferry terminals to Stockholm Cityterminal (next to Stockholm Central) after the arrival of the ferry, buy tickets from the information desk on board the ferry or from the bus driver. See map of Helsinki showing ferry terminals. See map of Stockholm showing ferry terminals.\n\nViking Line also sails overnight from Helsinki to Stockholm to a similar schedule, with the Gabriella & Cinderella.\n\nOption 2, Helsinki to Stockholm overnight 'sleeper' service - every day\n\nStep 1, travel from Helsinki to Turku by Intercity train, leaving Helsinki station at 17:36 every day, arriving Turku Port at 19:50.\n\nThis is a double-deck Intercity train specifically timed to connect with the ferry to Stockholm. It has Eko (2nd) class & Ekstra (1st) class, bistro, playroom & various seating options, see more about this Intercity train.\n\nIn Turku, it's just 100m from Turku Port station (Turku Satama) to the Viking Line ferry terminal, see map.\n\nUpdate: For 2 years from Autumn 2022, a bus will replace the train between Kupittaa (eastern Turku) and Turku Port. However, the bus is well signed, well organised and pretty efficient. The bus arrives next to Turku Port station.\n\nFares start at 7.90 in Eco class, 18.80 in Ekstra class.\n\nBook from Helsinki to Turku Port at the Finnish Railways website www.vr.fi and print your own ticket or show it on your phone.\n\nStep 2, sail from Turku to Stockholm by Viking Line ferry.\n\nThe ferry sails from Turku at 20:55 every day, arriving Stockholm Stadsgården ferry terminal at 06:30.\n\nFares start at 42 including a private cabin with shower & toilet, a bargain. However, fares vary by season & day of the week, with Fridays and the summer months usually more expensive.\n\nThe ferry has a wide range of standard & deluxe cabins, restaurants, bars, cinema, lounges & open deck. A cabin is compulsory on the night crossing.\n\nMap of Stockholm showing ferry terminal. In Stockholm, there are taxis available or Viking Line operate a transfer bus from outside the ferry terminal to the Cityterminalen (next to Stockholm Central Station), fare 7 or so, buy from the driver or buy at the information desk on the ferry.\n\nBook the ferry at the Direct Ferries website or at www.sales.vikingline.com. Print out your ticket or show it on your phone.\n\nOption 3, Helsinki to Stockholm daytime service - Mondays-Fridays only\n\nStep 1, travel from Helsinki to Turku by Intercity train, leaving Helsinki station at 05:28 on Mondays-Fridays, arriving Turku Port at 07:45.\n\nThis is a double-deck Intercity train specifically timed to connect with the ferry to Stockholm. It has Eko (2nd) class & Ekstra (1st) class, bistro, playroom & various seating options, see more about this Intercity train. There's no train connection into the daytime ferry from Turku at weekends.\n\nIn Turku, it's just 100m from Turku Port station (Turku Satama) to the Viking Line ferry terminal, see map.\n\nUpdate: For 2 years from Autumn 2022, a bus will replace the train between Kupittaa (in eastern Turku) and Turku Port. However, the bus is well-signed and well-organised. The bus arrives next to Turku Port station.\n\nFares start at 7.90 in Eco class, 18.80 in Ekstra class.\n\nBook this train at the Finnish Railways website www.vr.fi and print your own ticket or show it on your phone.\n\nStep 2, sail from Turku to Stockholm by Viking Line ferry.\n\nThe ferry sails at 08:45 arriving Stockholm Stadsgården ferry terminal at 18:55.\n\nFares start at 25 including a private cabin with shower & toilet, a bargain. However, fares vary by season & day of the week with Fridays and the summer months usually more expensive.\n\nThe ferry has a full range of standard & deluxe cabins, restaurants, bars, cinema, lounges & open deck. A cabin is optional on the day crossing, but I recommend one as somewhere to nap, shower, relax in private.\n\nMap of Stockholm showing ferry terminals. In Stockholm, there are taxis available or Viking Line operate a transfer bus from outside the ferry terminal to the Cityterminalen (next to Central Station), fare 7 or so, buy from the driver or buy at the information desk on the ferry.\n\nBook the ferry at the Direct Ferries website or at www.sales.vikingline.com. Print out your ticket or show it on your phone.\n\nBack to top\n\nHelsinki to Copenhagen\n\nOption 1, Helsinki to Stockholm overnight, onwards to Copenhagen by daytime train\n\nStep 1, travel from Helsinki to Turku by train & Turku to Stockholm by overnight ferry, as shown in option 2 of the Helsinki to Stockholm section above. You leave Helsinki station at 17:36 by train to Turku, sleep in a comfortable private cabin with shower & toilet on the overnight ferry to Stockholm, arriving 06:30. The ferry is usually very punctual.\n\nOn arrival in Stockholm, transfer from the ferry terminal to Stockholm Central either by taxi or the Viking Line transfer bus to the Cityterminal, which is next to the station. I'd allow 1½-2 hours or so between ferry arrival and an onward train departure.\n\nAlternatively, take the daily direct ferry from Helsinki to Stockholm, see option 1 in the Helsinki to Stockholm section above. This is the more relaxed experience, although it takes an extra 4 hours with arrival in Stockholm late morning.\n\nStep 2, travel from Stockholm to Copenhagen by 200 km/h X2000 train.\n\nIf you arrive via Turku at 06:30 you'll usually find an X2000 leaving Stockholm Central at 08:20 arriving Copenhagen at 13:33, but by all means book a later one if you like.\n\nIf you arrive from Helsinki by direct ferry at 10:30, you'll usually find an X2000 leaving Stockholm Central at 12:20, change at Malmö Central, arriving Copenhagen main station at 17:45, or there are later ones.\n\nTip: If you have a 1st class ticket you can use the SJ lounge at Stockholm Central.\n\nFares start at 195 SEK, about 20.\n\nBook the train at the Swedish Railways website www.sj.se (has been known to reject some overseas credit cards) or Omio.com (easy to use, in multiple currencies, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee). You print your own ticket or can show it on your phone.\n\nOption 2, Helsinki to Stockholm by daytime ferry, onwards to Copenhagen by sleeper train - Mondays-Fridays only\n\nStep 1, travel from Helsinki to Turku by train & Turku to Stockholm by daytime ferry, as shown in option 3 of the Helsinki to Stockholm section above, this runs Mondays-Fridays only. You leave Helsinki station at 05:28, relax on the ferry from Turku to Stockholm, arriving Stockholm around 18:15-18:55.\n\nOn arrival in Stockholm, transfer from the ferry terminal to Stockholm Central either by taxi or the ferry company transfer bus to the Cityterminal, which is next to the station. Have dinner in Stockholm.\n\nStep 2, travel from Stockholm to Malmö by sleeper train, leaving Stockholm Central at 23:17 and arriving Malmö Central at 06:48.\n\nThe sleeper runs daily except Saturdays. The train has 1st class sleeping-cars with private 1 & 2 bed sleeper compartments with en suite shower & toilet, 2nd class sleeping-cars with shared single-gender 3-berth sleeper compartments with washbasin, one 2nd class couchette car with shared 6-berth compartments, and one seats car. Exact times may vary.\n\nYou then hop on the next Öresund train from Malmö Central to Copenhagen, these run every 20-30 minutes and you should make the 07:08 arriving Copenhagen at 07:53.\n\nYou can buy tickets from Stockholm to Copenhagen as one transaction at the Swedish railways website www.sj.se.\n\nSJ.se is sometimes fussy with overseas credit cards, if you have any problems try alternative Swedish train booking site www.snalltaget.se or agency www.acprail.com, which can sell the same cheap fares with just a small fee. Or you can book by phone, calling SJ telesales on +46 771 75 75 75, there's a phone menu option for English.\n\nYou print your own ticket or can show it on your phone.

Hostelworld offers online booking of cheap private rooms or dorm beds in backpacker hostels in most cities at rock-bottom prices.\n\nBack to top\n\nTravel insurance & other tips\n\nAlways take out travel insurance\n\nNever travel overseas without travel insurance from a reliable insurer, with at least £1m or preferably £5m medical cover. It should also cover cancellation and loss of cash and belongings, up to a sensible limit. An annual multi-trip policy is usually cheaper than several single-trip policies even for just 2 or 3 trips a year, I have an annual policy with Staysure.co.uk myself. Here are some suggested insurers. Seat61 gets a small commission if you buy through these links.\n\nwww.staysure.co.uk offers enhanced Covid-19 protection & gets 4.7 out of 5 on Trustpilot.\n\nwww.columbusdirect.com is also a well-know brand.\n\nIf you live in the USA try Travel Guard USA.\n\nGet an eSIM with mobile data package\n\nDon't rely on WiFi, download an eSIM with a mobile data package for the country you're visiting and stay connected. Most newer mobile phones can download a virtual SIM card so you don't need to buy a physical SIM, including iPhone 11 & later, see device compatibility list. Maya.net is a reliable eSIM data retailer with a 4.5 out of 5 Trustpilot rating and a range of packages including unlimited data.\n\nGet a Curve card for foreign travel\n\nMost banks give you a poor exchange rate, then add a foreign transaction fee on top. A Curve MasterCard means no foreign transaction fees and gives you the mid-market exchange rate, at least up to a certain limit, £500 per month at time of writing. The money you spend on your Curve card goes straight onto one of your existing debit or credit cards.\n\nHow it works: 1. Download the Curve app for iPhone or Android. 2. Enter your details & they'll send you a Curve MasterCard - they send to the UK and most European addresses. 3. Link your existing credit & debit cards to the app, you can link up to two cards with the free version of Curve, I link my normal debit card and my normal credit card. 4. Now use the Curve MasterCard to buy things online or in person or take cash from ATMs, exactly like a normal MasterCard. Curve does the currency conversion and puts the balance in your own currency onto whichever debit or credit card is currently selected in the Curve app. You can even change your mind about which card it goes onto, within 14 days of the transaction.\n\nI have a Curve Blue card myself, it means I can buy a coffee on a foreign station on a card without being stung by fees and lousy exchange rates, just by tapping the Curve card on their card reader. The money goes through Curve to my normal debit card and is taken directly from my account (in fact I have the Curve card set up as payment card on Apple Pay on my iPhone, so can double-click my phone, let it do Face ID then tap the reader with the phone - even easier than digging a card out). I get a little commission if you sign up to Curve, but I recommend it here because I think it's great. See details, download the app and get a Curve card, they'll give you £5 cashback through that link.\n\nGet a VPN for safe browsing. Why you need a VPN\n\nWhen you're travelling you often use free WiFi in public places which may not be secure. A VPN encrypts your connection so it's always secure, even on unsecured WiFi. It also means you can select the geographic location of the IP address you browse with, to get around geoblocking which a surprising number of websites apply. See VPNs & why you need one explained. ExpressVPN is a best buy with a 4.7 out of 5 Trustpilot ranking which I use myself - I've signed up as an ExpressVPN affiliate, and if you go with expressvpn.com using the links on this page, you should see a special deal, 3 months free with an annual subscription. I get a small commission to help support this site.\n\nCarry an Anker powerbank\n\nTickets, reservations, vaccination records and Interrail or Eurail passes are often held digitally on your mobile phone, so it's vital to keep it charged. I always carry an Anker powerbank which can recharge my phone several times over if I can't get to a power outlet. Buy from Amazon.co.uk or from buy from Amazon.com."
