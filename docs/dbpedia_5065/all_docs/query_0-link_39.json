        "text": "Commercial Experience That Battery Technology\n\nIs Not Yet Robust Enough For Large Buses\n\nSome present-era examples of the issues regarding battery life can be found from Shanghai in China plus Rome and Pelermo in Italy.\n\nIncluded in the public transports for the 2010 World Expo which was held in Shanghai was a dedicated fleet of 120 battery electric buses. During the Expo these were mostly used as tourist shuttles, for which their 80km (50miles) range was sufficient. However they did not perform very well in the scorching summer heat of that year and in order to keep them available to transport Expo visitors the batteries had to be constantly replaced, cooled and recharged.\n\nBy 2013 the batteries had degraded to a point where they could only hold enough charge for 60-65 km (37-40 miles) of travel. As the linked news article below suggests, this restricts the services on which these buses can be used, with frequent recharging between journeys becoming a burdensome necessity.\n\nThe bus operator reckons that after 4 - 5 years the batteries will need changing, and with the cost of new battery sets (per bus) being about 1.1 million yuan (US$176,765) so the financial burden represents a significant deterrent for more widespread use of battery buses. See here:-\n\nhttp://www.shanghaidaily.com/metro/City-routes-get-120-electric-Expo-buses/shdaily.shtml\n\nSome reports suggest that rather than replace batteries some Chinese bus operators just scrap the vehicle. It is cheaper and easier.\n\nExperience from Rome comes from a fleet of 30 electric buses which were introduced into service in 2005 and designed for a combination of both trolleybus mode and wire-free battery electric mode. The batteries were capable of powering the buses for 10km of wire-free travel, although they only actually needed to travel for 3km in this mode plus spend 5-15 minutes laying over between journeys at the city centre bus terminus.\n\nBy October 2014 the batteries on all but four of these buses had become life-expired and needed replacing - at a cost of €30,000 each vehicle! Media reports suggest that the batteries could not cope with the intensive demand placed upon them by the lengthy and busy unwired section in the city centre. As a result most of the fleet is out of service.\n\nAs Rome is extending its trolleybus network it is possible that until the new routes open some of the new trolleybuses will be used on this 2005 service. What is significant is that for use away from overhead wires the new trolleybuses have diesel engines, so these will be used whilst travelling on the unwired section along inner-city streets and at the bus terminus.\n\nPalermo has 13 hybrid buses which date from 2001 and it is no longer to use as it cannot afford an estimated €400,000 for new batteries.\n\nIn the 1970's there were British trials with an electric Leyland National bus which towed lead acid batteries in a small trailer. The batteries weighed almost as much as the bus! The aim was to emulate the success of the milk float* but experience showed that the 40 mile range of the batteries was significantly less than what had been hoped for. Had the experiment proven more successful then although there would have had to be much investment in battery handing and charging facilities plus the creation of space for all the trailers at bus garages, with Leyland National buses being characterised by having noisy diesel engines which emitted waste gases that included plumes of black smoke so such investment would have represented money extremely well spent.\n\n*Milk floats were low-speed battery powered local area delivery vehicles used by milk delivery companies which each morning used to be familiar sights in British urban areas.\n\nEmerging Technologies\n\nScientists are feverishly trying to find new solutions to battery life issues, it is not intended to report on them all but what may yet prove to be a gamechanger for passenger transport is that in June 2013 some German researchers claimed to have created a lithium-ion battery that retains 85% of its ability even after 10,000 charges. In theory this means that if a battery is charged once daily then 10,000 charges will take over 27 years to achieve, however since batteries are more likely to be charged several times a day so it could be that they will reach the 85% after just 10 years. This might still be viable, so that the batteries would only need changing once during the expected lifetime of the bus... as ever we will only know through real-life experience when the right time has been reached. See here:-\n\nhttp://www.treehugger.com/cars/german-researchers-create-lithium-ion-battery-retains-85-its-capacity-after-10000-charges.html\n\nThen there is graphene, which when mixed with nanoparticles of silicon and metal oxides makes batteries of far greater capacity than those that exist today. For many applications graphene will be used in single-atom layers which are known as two-dimensional crystals and the unanswered question which boffins are investigating is how many other materials, when used in this way, will have similar or even more useful attributes? Such as powerful, long lasting batteries?\n\nThis is not the place to discuss why this is being suggested, but sometimes on alternative news discussion forums it has been suggested that magnetics can be used as part of a clean and safe source of energy. In tandem with the sort of changes which are expected to be coming on stream when we start using magnetics will be wide ranging changes to our transport solutions, including the possible replacement of rubber tyres (tires as spelt in the USA) with magnetic levitation. One reason why this would be so beneficial is that (as with diesel engines) the rubber tyres used on road vehicles represent another source of harmful particulate matter air pollution.\n\nCharging The Batteries\n\nMost battery electric buses use 'conductive charging', which is also known as 'direct wired contact' or 'direct coupling'. This well tried and proven system has traditionally involved plugging a cable into a socket on the vehicle. However other variants are being created which involve physical contact with overhead (not trolleybuses / something else) and road surface power supply conductors.\n\nA variant of conductive charging sometimes sees the batteries being removed from the vehicle for recharging. If several sets of batteries are available then immediately replacing them with a fully charged set of batteries would mean that the bus could be back in service within minutes / without having to wait for the removed batteries to be recharged.\n\nIn addition to 'conductive charging' another way to charge the batteries (whilst they still remain in the bus) is via electromagnetic 'inductive charging'. This is further explored under the Roadway Power heading below.\n\nOpportunity Charging\n\nThe term opportunity charging refers to daytime 'topping up' the stored energy in the batteries whenever and wherever there is a chance to do so - such as whilst calling at a bus stop - rather solely charging the batteries overnight (in a bus garage) or swapping out batteries with a freshly charged set during the day. Frequent charging in this way means that the bus can use fewer batteries, as there is no need to even try to make a single charge last for a full day's use. Fewer batteries equates to a smaller space requirement and less weight, both of which can result in a higher overall passenger capacity.\n\nBoth conductive and inductive methods are suitable for opportunity charging, however the bigger question relates to the batteries which (depending in the type of battery) might be damaged - such as experience a shorter overall life - if charged too quickly.\n\nNote that opportunity charging is only possible at locations where the required physical infrastructure has been installed in advance. What is possible however is that as the technologies described below mature some cities will install charging facilities at some bus stops on the basis that they are used on an 'as required' basis. As batteries start to degrade this scenario will assist in keeping buses in service and delay the inevitable time when fresh batteries will be required.\n\nThe disadvantage of opportunity charging is that it requires a bus to be stationary. This can delay the service, although if carried out at busy bus stops where the dwell time is often longer than usual so quick top-ups of 30 - 120 seconds duration (or at bus termini during the layover between journeys) the recharging period will probably not even be noticed.\n\nWith battery buses which also operate for some of the time as trolleybuses it is possible to recharge the batteries at all times the bus is connected to the overhead wires, whether stationary, in motion, carrying passengers... This is known as SlideIn charging.\n\nThis solution is being adopted in several cities, including Beijing, China; Rome, Italy; São Paulo, Brazil; Landskrona, Sweden; Esslingen, Germany, Budapest, Hungary and more.\n\nIn Beijing trials since 2008 which used battery buses with the aim of replacing the trolleybuses found that not only was it often difficult to find unobstructed locations for opportunity charging but that the commercially viable life of the batteries was just too short. In addition there was disquiet over the high cost of installing all the charging equipment. With severe urban air pollution making conversion to diesel buses politically unacceptable so Beijing is now expanding its trolleybus fleet with vehicles that have lithium-ion batteries (for use on short unwired sections) which are re-charged whilst travelling in trolleybus mode.\n\nIn Landskrona the single trolleybus route is being used as a means to electrify other bus services without installing any extra infrastructure. The experimental bus simply switches between the various routes, operating in either battery or grid-connected trolleybus modes as appropriate. At a later date the bus is to be modified to be compatible with a tram power supplies too. A further phase is also planned but at present the technology does not currently exist - see roadway power below.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3922#RM\n\nhttp://www.slidein.se/en/about-the-project/background/\n\nAnother advantage of recharging whilst travelling under trolleybus overhead wiring is that this is compatible with busy roads served by multiple bus routes. Whilst opportunity charging works well on single bus routes which do not share termini, life could become somewhat chaotic if the bus stops are on the public highway, and more expensive (because many charging stations will be required) when serving multiple high-frequency bus routes (eg: buses on each route come every 5-8 minutes). The scenario being envisaged here is one where three (or more) buses all arrive at the same time and all need to recharge their onboard energy storage...\n\nBattery Electric Bus Examples\n\nWhere battery technology has been proven viable (if given financial support based on environmental issues) is with small buses which are used on relatively short routes where the timetable has been arranged so that there is enough time between journeys for the batteries to benefit from either 'top-up' charging or being replaced with a fresh set of fully charged batteries. Note that with buses effectively \"out of service\" whilst their batteries are recharged or replaced so to maintain acceptable headways the fleet might need to be larger than it would have been had different solutions (motor or trolley buses) been chosen.\n\nIn the early 1990's Oxford, England, trialled a fleet of four electric minibuses. A report on their first 500 days of operation found that compared to similar diesel buses (and after taking account of extra emissions at the power station) there was:-\n\n21% less carbon dioxide,\n\n98% less carbon monoxide,\n\n42% less acid gases,\n\n93% less hydrocarbons, and\n\n95% less particulates (the fine particles of soot which clog our lungs, causing lung disease).\n\nMaintenance costs were comparable to diesels, but because of high design and development costs which were spread over just four vehicles they were twice as expensive to purchase. Their lead-acid batteries weighed-in at 2 ¼ tonnes, making them about 2 tonnes heavier than the regular diesel buses.\n\nServices using these buses in Oxford ended when local government funding was withdrawn.\n\nIn Seoul (Korea) the Metropolitan Government (SMG) in conjunction with Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hankuk Fiber have overseen the creation and introduction of some distinctively styled battery electric buses which are used on leisure-themed services that serve Mount Namsan. Incredibly this service is promoted as being the first commercial all-electric bus service not just in Korea but anywhere on the planet!\n\nThese buses are 11.05 metres in length (about 12 yards / 36¼ ft), have a maximum speed of 100 km/hr (about 62 mph) and are said to be able to travel as far as 83km (about 52 miles) on a single charge. Using high-speed battery chargers their high-capacity lithium-ion batteries can be fully charged in less than 30 minutes. Four battery charges are being provided at the route terminus on the mountain. The press release references collecting \"energy generated from brakes when running downhill\" which means that they also feature regenerative braking. Whilst this can be very beneficial when travelling downhill the inclines will drain the stored power even more quickly.\n\nTo reduce their weight and help maximise the distance they can travel between charges these buses make extensive use of carbon composite materials, instead of metal. They are also of a low floor design and are equipped with automatic slant boards for wheelchair users. To enhance their visual appeal and create an aura of being different they are shaped like a peanut and decorated with attractive designs symbolizing the Namsan Tower and landscapes of Mt. Namsan.\n\nThe first five were introduced in December 2010 as part of a phased replacement of all 14 diesel buses on this service with the new electric buses. The phased introduction was to ensure that if there were any teething issues then it would be possible to minimise the inconvenience which may be caused to passengers.\n\nAdditional information plus some photographs, one of which shows the physical cable 'plug-in' opportunity charging at the Mount Namsan route terminus:\n\nhttp://kojects.com/2013/02/08/namsan-e-bus-first-commercial-electric-bus-worldwide/\n\nAlso in Asia, the Chinese BYD eBus battery buses which use Lithium Iron-Phosphate batteries have attracted attention of many transport operators planetwide. This is because BYD promote these buses as being able to travel 250km (155miles) on one charge, in heavy city traffic, with the air-conditioning switched on. Trials in Poland in 2013 suggest that even further may be possible, albeit not the 350km (217miles) which the public transport operator in Warsaw, the Polish capital city, has said that it needs from a battery bus to provide a full day's use from the one overnight charge. It is important to remember that these are new buses with new batteries - there is a need to see them in daily use for at least 5 years to know the likely longevity of their battery packs. By the time we reach 2018 there will be no shortage of real-world data, as many thousands of these buses using these batteries are being introduced to various Chinese cities as well as 700 to the Dan bus company in Israel and small experimental fleets to many bus operators in about a dozen nations globally. This includes London and (in 2016) Nottingham.\n\nA Vender-Neutral International Fast-Charge Standard Emerges\n\nIn 2014 ABB and Volvo formed a global partnership to create and commercialise a standard charging system for electric and hybrid buses using both an automatic roof-top connection system at bus stops and overnight cabled charging systems at bus garages.\n\nIt seemed sensible that where possible existing open standards-based direct current (DC) protocols would be used, but since none existed for opportunity charging at bus stops the partnership formulated a standardised automatic e-bus fast charging solution, including the communications protocol between the infrastructure charging solution and the bus, the electrical interface and specifications for the rooftop automatic connection system (ACS).\n\nABB were already experts in fast charging systems, having delivered such for automotive, utility, government and retail customers including nationwide networks in Denmark, Estonia and Holland.\n\nThe idea behind this partnership was that by there being a single international standard to which all urban bus industry manufacturers could adhere it would facilitate a more rapid expansion of e-mobility in our towns and cities whilst avoiding the nuisance of rival and incompatible systems - such as occurred in the 1980's in the video tape industry.\n\nSome readers may recall there being several incompatible rival videotape systems. VHS and Betamax were the main variants, but there were others as well.\n\nThen there were issues because of different standards for colour television - PAL, NTSC, SECAM - which varied according to nation or region. Unless you owned a rare multi format video player, videotapes recorded in one format would not work on machines designed for a different format, even if the same physical system. A right mess! For those who have no idea, this link may be of interest: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape_format_war\n\nThe newly designed ACS uses four conductors - two for power, one for a signal to ensure that all is well and the fourth as an earth - for the bus bodywork. This may sound like belt and braces safety but it significantly reduces the chance of a freak event resulting in danger. For instance, a very windy day when something is blown on the roof of the bus during the charging process which touches both the bus body and live conductor at the same time.\n\nWhat may also be of interest here is that an electric short-circuit protection system was also devised in the 1980's when kerb guided trolleybuses started travelling on kerb guided rights of way which were shared with trams. The concern was that if the tramway overhead wire should break and fall on to the bus it could make the bus bodywork live, and if this happened at a joint bus / tram station and if someone on the station platform or a boarding / alighting passenger touched the bus and station platform at the same time then they would be used as part of the electric circuit to earth. To avoid this (and the consequent danger of electric shock, or worse) the buses were fitted with a special earthing shoe which would automatically lower on to a tram rail as part of the station stop, as this ensured that the body of the bus would be electrically grounded. Trams do not need these special shoes because their steel wheels automatically create the ground connection, whereas buses use rubber-tyres which electrically insulate them from the ground.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/6ce621212d3e502ac1257d1c002eb875.aspx\n\nhttp://articles.sae.org/13457/ (Also includes some data about TOSA [as seen below] charging rates for other buses and photographs of the Opbrid Bůsbaar.)\n\nhttp://chargedevs.com/newswire/abb-and-volvo-form-partnership-for-bus-fast-charging/\n\nhttp://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/05/prweb12729101.htm\n\n(Opbrid announce their support for the new open standards opportunity charging system; this press release dates from after it had been created).\n\nBecause of its involvement in this project in September 2014 Luxembourg became the first city to receive some opportunity charged Volvo 7900 Hybrid Concept buses. Eventually it will have 12 such buses, delivery is being phased over time with six scheduled to arrive in 2016. They are destined to be used on various routes around the city.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/abb-and-volvo-buses-12-fast-recharging-hybrid-buses-planned-for-luxembourg-53cd28bab9b3988708048882\n\nhttp://www.sales-lentz.lu/en/information/news/world-premier-volvo-7900-electric-hybrid\n\nOne of the pure electric Volvo 7900H Electric Concept buses built for Gothenburg and Siemens ACS at the Milan 2015 UITP exhibition.\n\nAs is seen in the image on the right, the H-shaped pantograph head is at right-angles to the copper contacts which are on the bus roof.\n\nThe next stage in Gothenburg occurred in June 2015 when fully electric route 55 was introduced. This is served by 7 Volvo 7900 Electric Hybrid buses and 3 Volvo 7900 pure Electric buses, all of which opportunity charge at both termini. These buses offer passengers free wi-fi internet and mobile telephone charging facilities. A new innovation is that one of the termini bus stops in indoors - this is only possible because the buses use electric power. The electricity used to charge these buses is sustainably sourced.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.goteborgelectricity.se/en/node/19504\n\nhttp://www.siemens.com/press/en/pressrelease/?press=/en/\n\npressrelease/2015/mobility/pr2015060258moen.htm&content[]=ICMOL&content[]=MOTPE&content[]=MO\n\n(Siemens press release which includes a photograph inside the bus station showing a bus during the charging process)\n\nhttp://www.multivu.com/players/English/7544351-volvo-electric-bus-route-launched/\n\nhttp://busandcoach.com/news/articles/open-standard-charging-stations-for-gothenburg/\n\nhttp://busandcoach.com/news/articles/indoor-buses-volvo-electricity-shows-the-possibilities/\n\n(A much more indepth article which also talks about the Volvo ElectriCity project in general, the bus stop inside a library(!) and how electric buses could redefine bus travel).\n\nCommercial Exploitation Starting 2016 - Including Here In The UK!\n\nStarting in 2016 Volvo pure electric and hybrid buses suitable for opportunity charging via the overhead ACS will become commercially available as part of the Volvo product range.\n\nOne of the first cities to start using the new system will be Edinburgh, Scotland, where Lothian Buses will be introducing a fleet of 24 such buses and two charging stations on route No.30. The buses will also be fully charged overnight, using a plug-in connection at the bus garage. The night charging will also include battery balancing, which helps ensure that all the individual cells which form the battery are working correctly and sharing the workload.\n\nThe two links below which reference plans for Edinburgh vary in when these buses will be running in public service. One suggests 2016, the other one suggests 2017.\n\nAnother new technology which these buses will include is geo-fencing. This automated AI (artificial intelligence) system detects and uses the location of the bus to change how it operates. The functions it will automatically control include switching the bus into an enforced pure electric mode (to eliminate tailpipe pollution when passing through air quality management areas) and the ability to restrict the speed at which the bus can travel. This latter feature is promoted as being for use when passing schools, although the information does not state whether at all times (even nights? weekends? other times when the schools are closed?) or only in the mornings / afternoons when the children are actually travelling to and from school.\n\nIn 2016 the Canadian city of Montreal will also start a three year experimental public service using this opportunity charging system. However the buses to be used will come from the Volvo's North American subsidiary, Nova Bus. There will be two opportunity charging pylons and three Nova LFSe electric buses. This is part of trials by the urban transport operator (Société de transport de Montréal - STM) designed to choose an electric bus technology for its entire network, so that it can switch to only having electrically power buses.\n\nAdditional reading:\n\nhttp://www.route-one.net/technology/lothian-buses-plots-electric-future/\n\nhttp://lothianbuses.com/news/article/Lothian-Buses-to-order-next-generation-green-buses\n\nhttp://www.volvogroup.com/group/global/en-gb/_layouts/CWP.\n\nInternet.VolvoCom/NewsItem.aspx?News.ItemId=145420&News.Language=en-gb\n\nhttp://www.stm.info/en/about/major_projects/electrification-surface-system\n\nOther Fast Charging Projects\n\nThere are several other fast charging systems which basically have the same aims but involve other bus manufacturers, bus operators, governmental bodies, etc., Those which are known about are detailed below.\n\nEDDA Bus project\n\nThis German system is part of the Fast Charging Systems for Electric Buses in Public Transport joint research project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). It includes the Fraunhofer Institute for Transportation and Infrastructure Systems IVI plus several bus / electrical industry companies. Trials with the opportunity charged Solaris Urbino 12 EDDA bus by the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe (DVB) began in November 2014 and in June 2015 it entered public service on the 5.2km circular route No. 79 Mickten - Übigau. Journeys normally take 16 minutes, and since the route operates every 20 minutes this leaves just four-minutes at the terminus for battery charging. This is said to be sufficient for the high-power charger to recharge the batteries and pre-heat the passenger compartment, if required. The batteries receive a full charge overnight.\n\nPower for charging the bus is taken from the tramway overhead wiring. The charging infrastructure includes a transformer that stabilises output voltage at approximately 748v. The transformer is needed because although the tramway is energised at a nominal 600v this fluctuates widely - between 500v and 1000v! - with acceleration and regenerative braking of the trams being the cause.\n\nThis bus route only needs one bus and when this electric bus is undergoing maintenance it is replaced with a diesel bus.\n\nMore information plus some images:\n\nhttp://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2015/June/fast-charging-electric-bus-does-overtime.html\n\nhttp://www.edda-bus.de/en.html\n\nhttp://www.gizmag.com/fast-charging-edda-electric-bus/37860/\n\nhttp://www.greencarcongress.com/2015/06/20150601-edda.html (This page has what is probably the best image showing the charging station).\n\nTOSA\n\nTOSA was launched in May 2013 at the UITP exhibition in the Swiss city of Geneva. During the exhibition and for one year afterwards the single Hess Swisstrolley4 articulated electric bus (which has what is described as a small car-sized battery pack) was used on a short demonstration service which served just a few bus stops between Geneva Airport and Palexpo exhibition centre.\n\nThe TOSA system features two different types of charging stations which are located at bus stops along the vehicle's route and at termini. The 400kW en route charging facilities are designed to provide a partial top-up in just 15 seconds, whilst passengers alight and board. The 200kW termini type charging facilities are deliver a 3 - 4 minute full recharge. To avoid sudden large drains on the urban electricity supply system the fast charging stations use capacitors rated at 3kWh to store electrical energy that has been slowly drawn from the 50kVA urban power grid. In addition the buses receive a 30 minute 50kVA charge at the bus garage. The onboard energy storage needs recharging every 1km - 1½ km, which works out at about every second or third bus stop.\n\nThe power is transmitted to the bus via a laser-controlled moving arm located on the roof of the bus which connects to an overhead rail that is approximately 1m in length. This current collector is moveable in several directions, so that the vehicle benefits from a little leeway in its stopping position beneath the power rail. The system is designed for speed, so even as the bus is arriving at the stop the fixed overhead receptacle is being detected and the rooftop contact arm begins to align itself laterally to it. Once achieved the charging arm rises up from the bus and makes contact. After a safety check has ensured that a proper connection has been made with the stationary bus voltage is applied.\n\nThe flash-charging technology and the onboard traction equipment used in this project were developed by ABB and is optimised for high-frequency bus routes in key urban areas, carrying large numbers of passengers at peak times. The project is a collaboration between TPG; (Transports Publics Genevois - the Genevan public transport operator); OPI - as coordinator for industrial projects; SIG (Geneva power plants) for the power supply; and ABB.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.tosa2013.com/\n\nhttp://www.gizmag.com/tosa-bus-model/32564/\n\nhttp://www.trolleymotion.ch/index.php?L=3&id=115&n_ID=1796\n\nNote that Geneva already uses both (overhead wire electric) trolleybuses and trams, and concurrent with this trial is introducing a fleet of new trolleybuses which would be expected to still be in use in the 2030's and, given that trolleybuses often last 30+ years, the 2040's. The tramway has also only just received some new vehicles, one of which is involved in regenerative braking trials using capacitors.\n\nTOSA is not seen as a replacement for trolleybuses, not least because the cost of installing a TOSA system (including the buses, charging stations and electrical supply infrastructure) is expected to be comparable to a new trolleybus system. Its primary aim is to create a different way to convert diesel / other fossil fuel bus services to electric traction. The systems' reliance on batteries still represents a future liability.\n\nBy spring 2014 it was thought that experience of the TOSA system was such that work should start on the next stage, this being the conversion of a 9km diesel bus route which does not serve the city centre (No.23) to TOSA buses. This 9km bus service uses 11 vehicles. The plans are for 12 short charging stations and two main charging stations at the termini. This is being done as part of a strategy for the cleanest possible urban air, which is recognised as only being possible through the elimination of all diesel buses from the built-up area.\n\nAh, if only similar thinking applied here in Britain too!\n\nWatt System\n\nThe French company PVI (Power Vehicle Innovation) has created a fast charge system which uses supercapacitors to store the energy, with a 10 second 300 watt recharge being expected to provide sufficient energy for 600 - 800 metres of travel. In addition buses are fitted with Lithium-ion battery packs to provide back-up power, if needed, for instance if the bus cannot stop at the correct location to recharge or if it is not carrying passengers and hence not stopping at bus stops.\n\nPower transfer is whilst calling at bus stops via a collector arm which slides sideways from a housing unit located on the roof of the bus into a socket located either on the roof of a bus stop shelter, as an integral part of the bus stop flag or as a free-standing totem pole. The recharging stations are also fitted with capacitors.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.pvi.fr/watt-r-system,027.html?lang=en\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S40VBuln9Qc (a promotional film on youtube)\n\nAs part of the system's development and to help gain the all-important initial commercial experience, in October 2014 one bus started non-passenger trials at Nice Côte d'Azur Airport on a service which links the two airport terminals. The demonstrator will rely on 7 totem poles (or recharge terminals) spread between the different stops along the route.\n\nWinnipeg, Canada\n\nIn November 2014 the city of Winnipeg in the Canadian state of Manitoba started using a small fleet of 4 battery electric New Flyer Xcelsior® buses which include opportunity charging as part of their daily operations. Route No.20 operates 40km round trips linking Winnipeg Richardson International Airport with the city centre and East Kildonan. Whilst passengers alight and board at the airport the bus connects to an overhead charging facility for an approximate 10 minute top up of its batteries. This delivers enough power for one 2 hour round trip, although the batteries are claimed to store enough energy for 5 hours before a recharge becomes absolutely necessary. By using opportunity charging in this way the buses can stay in service for more than 20 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nThe project is a continuing collaboration between New Flyer, the Province of Manitoba , Manitoba Hydro, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Red River College and Winnipeg Transit. Funding came from Sustainable Development Technology Canada (on behalf of the Government of Canada) and Manitoba's Vehicle Technology Center. Rather than use pre-existing technology from elsewhere the charging station was developed as part of this project. Almost all electricity in Manitoba is generated without burning fuel.\n\nMore information can be found at this first link and some photographs at the second link:\n\nhttp://finance.yahoo.com/news/flyer-battery-electric-buses-enter-180200832.html\n\nhttp://opbrid.info/winnipeg-reference-site\n\nPlzeň, Czech Republic\n\nIn Plzeň (Plsň) two Škoda 12 metre battery buses are used which have different specifications. These are the the ŠKODA 26 BB HP Perun and the ŠKODA 26 BB HE Perun. Both buses are compatible with Euro-American automotive standard COMBO II (CSS) and can also be charged using quick charger infrastructure designed for plug-in electric / hybrid cars.\n\nThe HP (high power) bus been designed for opportunity charging and its lithium-ion batteries have a range of 30km. Rapid recharging at the ŠKODA UFC (Ultra Fast Charger) takes six to eight minutes. The charging method is via a pantograph which lowers on to copper rail contacts on the roof of the bus. These are protected by a collapsing roof which opens as part of the recharging process once the vehicle is under the charging arm. Slow recharging can also be carried out at the bus garage.\n\nThe HE (high energy) bus is designed for services that do not have the time to stop for fast charging or where there is no possibility to install fast charging infrastructure. It uses high energy density lithium-polymer (Li-Poly) batteries which have a range of 150km. This bus can still use the Škoda UFC, with a full charge taking 70 minutes. However for a longer battery life overnight 6 - 8 hour charges are seen as being better.\n\nMore information, some of which will require online translation:\n\nhttp://www.skoda.cz/en/press-room/news/skoda-electric-introduces-its-first-battery-powered-electric-bus/\n\nhttp://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/11/20131130-skoda.html\n\nhttp://www.skoda.cz/cs/produkty/elektricke-a-hybridni-autobusy/elektrobus-skoda-hp-perun/\n\nhttp://www.skoda.cz/cs/produkty/elektricke-a-hybridni-autobusy/elektrobus-skoda-perun-he/\n\nMünster, Germany\n\nApril 2015 saw the entire bus route No.14 in the German city of Münster being converted to fast charge electric buses. Here a small fleet of VDL Citeas SLF Electric buses are used on a 12km route which uses opportunity charging at the route termini plus the bus garage. All five buses are operated (and funded) as part of the ZeEUS project but one of them was also partly funded in connection with the SEB project which is subsidised by the Federal German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The SEB bus has Hoppecke Lithium-Polymer batteries whilst the other buses have Lithium-Titanate batteries.\n\nThe buses use an IFAS (Institute for Fluid Power Drives and Controls) rapid charging system which is on the right-hand side of the bus roof. When stopped at the correct position a robotic arm emerges from the roof of a bus shelter to automatically make contact with the charging system on the bus. The system can cope with position errors of up to 30cm horizontal and 10cm vertical. A radio link between the bus and the charger sees the batteries telling the charger how much power is required, with up to 500 kW of power being transferred within 4-6 minutes. IFAS is part of the RWTH Aachen University of Technology, as is the ISEA (Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives) which coordinated both Münster projects. The batteries only actually need to be recharged after the bus has travelled the route three times, so if for some reason a bus is unable to recharge its batteries when it reaches its terminus (eg: a parked vehicle is in the way) then there should be sufficient stored energy to skip that charging cycle. At night the batteries are recharged at the bus garage using solar power harvested via photovoltaics (solar panels) located on the workshop and vehicle shed roofs.\n\nThe system is completely safe, even during the charging process, so that passengers and the bus driver can board / alight etc., and move around the bus shelter without restriction.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.vdlbuscoach.com/News/News-Library/2015/5-VDL-Citea%E2%80%99s-Electric-voor-Stadtwerke-Munster.aspx\n\nhttp://zeeus.eu/events/launch-event-munster-demonstration\n\nCologne, Germany\n\nStarting 2016 Cologne (Köln) will be using eight opportunity charged VDL Citea SLFA-180 electric buses on route 33 which is about 7 km long with 13 bus stops and links the Hauptbahnhof (main railway station) with the suburb of Zollstock.\n\nThese 18.1m articulated buses will use lithium iron magnesium phosphate (LiFeMgPO4) batteries. Whilst these will be fully charged overnight, during the daytime layovers at both termini they will also receive 5 - 10 minutes of additional opportunity / top-up charging (at 250 kW). Power will be transmitted using the Schunk power collection system via a retractable pantograph located on the roof (above the middle axle).\n\nAs the first of the links explains, the first bus arrived in Cologne on 26th October 2015.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.vdlbuscoach.com/News/News-Library/2015/Levering-van-eerste-VDL-Citea-SLFA-180-Electric-aa.aspx\n\nhttp://www.prestigeelectriccar.com/en/news/1552/World_premiere_the_VDL_Citea_SLFA_Electric\n\nhttp://coachandbusweek.co/2014/07/vdl-to-build-electric-artics-for-kvb-cologne-trail/\n\nBarcelona, Spain\n\nAs part of the ZeEUS Project the Spanish city of Barcelona is supposed (at some stage) to be trialling two opportunity charged articulated buses which are equipped with roof-mounted pantographs. As yet little more is known about this.\n\nThis is in addition to the two Irizar i2e battery electric buses which have already arrived, but are not equipped for opportunity charging.\n\nOberhausen, Germany\n\nAs part of a project called Electromobility in Oberhausen two Solaris Urbino 12 Electric buses which use the Schunk power collection system are being used in a study which is about opportunity charging from two different sources of energy. The reasoning behind this project is that wherever trams and trolleybuses are operated there exists a powerful DC infrastructure which it should be possible to use for bus battery charging.\n\nAs part of this feasibility study the local transport operator (Stadtwerke Oberhausen GmbH - STOAG) and the regional transport co-ordinator (Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr - VRR) installed two fast charge facilities which are directly powered (one each) from either tramway overhead wiring or a tramway substation.\n\nAbstraction of electricity from the tramway overhead wiring is by means of extra equipment attached to an overhead wire support pole. In addition two outdoor roadside cabinets are required, the first of which contains a circuit breaker for short circuit protection. This cabinet is also equipped with a surge arrester to secure the system against over voltage events, such as caused by lightning strikes, etc. The other cabinet contains the necessary quick charge control gear. In November 2015 three 50kW quick charge points were added at this site, these take their energy from the first cabinet. Two of these charging points are for electric cars, the third is for STOAG service vehicles.\n\nIt was found that to abstract electricity from the tramway substation it was possible to use the existing sub-station components which produce the DC voltage for the trams, and that the high-power quick charge control gear which regulates the charging current of the batteries on the buses could be located inside the same sub-station building.\n\nThe battery electric buses are used route 962 (15.6 km return journey) and route 966 (13.3 km return journey). Both of these operate 60 minute interval services and only need one bus at a time. At the end of each journey the batteries have a 10 minute recharge.\n\nMore information: (all links will require online translation)\n\nhttp://www.stoag.de/stoag/elektromobilitaet.html\n\nhttp://www.stoag.de/stoag/elektromobilitaet/das-projekt.html\n\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Urbino_12_electric#Oberhausen\n\nHannover, Germany\n\nIn 2016 the German city of Hannover will commence trials with three Solaris Urbano battery electric buses which are fitted with 120 kWh lithium titanate batteries. These will be used on ring routes 100/200 which are about 16km in length and have 42 bus stops. The buses are fitted with Schunk pantographs which make contact with a 450 kW charger connection point that is an integral design as part of a bus stop shelter. Located in the city centre at the only terminus for these circular bus routes, the charging infrastructure was built some years ago to demonstrate the technologies involved during a bus industry exhibition. It draws its power from the tramway power supply system. Normal top-up charges are expected to last about 4-6 minutes, depending on the season - more power is needed in the winter! Full charges will take about 18 minutes. At night the buses will be slow-charged in the depot using a 32 kW plug-in connection.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Urbino_12_electric#Hannover (requires online translation)\n\nhttps://www.uestra.de/en/about-us/city-bus/elektrobusse/\n\nhttp://www.busworld.org/articles/detail/2445\n\nHelsinki, Finland and Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nAs part of the ePELI Project Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) have bought a small fleet of 12 light-weight aluminium bodied battery electric buses built by a company called Linkker, which is a commercial spin-off of an earlier eBus project. The battery capacity is 55 kWh. The battery type is Lithium Titanate Oxide. The batteries are fast charged in 1½ - 3 minutes at bus route termini.\n\nThe first bus entered passenger service on route No.11 in December 2015, in Espoo, which is a city in its own right within the wider Helsinki Capital Region. Within Helsinki the electric buses will be introduced in 2016 on route No.23 and possibly other bus routes too. Finland experiences some extreme seasonal weather conditions including very cold, snowy winters and hot summers. These trials will help validate whether the chosen type of battery is capable of offering a viable alternative to fossil fuel on a day in, day out, basis in this wide range of climatic conditions.\n\nAlthough bus operations in Helsinki are privatised, for these trails HSL is making an exception to the normal bus procurement process and buying the buses itself, because this way they will retain greater control over events and feel that it would be unreasonable to expect a traffic company to shoulder the financial risks involved when testing the new technology.\n\nIn summer 2016 some fast-charging Linkker battery electric buses will be introduced in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nBoth Scandinavian projects will use the Schunk/Heliox power collection system.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.vttresearch.com/media/news/first-finnish-fast-charging-electric-buses-to-enter-into-service\n\nhttps://www.walcc.org/index.php/material-bank/project-industry-news/32-project-industry-news-general/216-helsinki-adds-fully-electric-buses-to-public-transit-fleet\n\nhttp://www.linkkerbus.com/\n\nhttp://www.linkkerbus.com/naytasivu/NEWS/13\n\nhttp://heliox.nl/opportunity-charging\n\nBatteries + Capacitors = A Marriage Made In Heaven?\n\nAlthough batteries are often used to absorb regenerative braking energy only certain types take kindly to doing this, as they prefer slower more regular charging. By way of a contrast, capacitors are excellent for capturing large amounts of sudden and powerful bursts of electricity such as comes from regenerative braking, but less good at retaining sufficient energy for even medium time periods.\n\nThe Chinese saw the potential benefits of combining these two very different electrical storage media in ways which (for quite a few years) the Europeans and Americans failed to do, and in late 2009 introduced in the city of Shanghai a small experimental fleet of 10 such buses.\n\nEarly reports were very encouraging. Using lithium iron phosphate batteries and ultra-capacitors, it is reported that overnight charging of the batteries only requires 3 -5 hours (typically 4 hours, this being half that of other types of battery bus) and that their range between charging sessions is at least 160km (100 miles) with the air-conditioner switched on, and as far as 250km (155 miles) to 300km (186 miles) with the air conditioning switched off. A driver on bus route No.825 revealed that on an average day the electric buses (s)he drives typically cover 154km (95 miles) and consumes about 170 kilowatts electricity, which makes running these buses cost about a third of a diesel engined bus. As an aside, these buses have a moderate maximum speed of 130Km/h (80mph).\n\nIn 2014 it was reported that as part of a policy aimed at reducing urban air pollution several hundred of what are known locally as double-electric buses have been introduced in Shanghai. They are largely being used to convert some of the bus routes which use diesel buses to electric traction. Shanghai also uses trolleybuses and is expanding its fleet of these as well.\n\nSeeking The \"Holy Grail\" - Viable Alternatives To Batteries\n\nOver the years there have been several attempts to create workable, practical alternative solutions which feature electrically powered buses that can be used for a full day's operation - but without either overhead wires or heavy batteries. Two solutions which have been trialled, both require frequent recharging but only one seems to be finding favour.\n\nCapacitor Energy Storage / Capabus\n\nCapacitors are solid state electric components that store energy. As technology advances so their properties and the terminologies used to describe them also change, with newer variants being called super-capacitor, ultra-capacitor, etc. It is beyond the scope of this page to explore the differences between the various types.\n\nSome people add the prefix Capa before the name of a vehicle which uses capacitors. However since the use of capacitor powered vehicles is little known here in Britain so this term has not caught on in general terminology - and is not used on this page. Another reason for avoiding the capa prefix is because with a slight change of spelling it is possible to make a word which some people find offensive and suggests that something is of extremely bad quality / not value for money.\n\nThe principal constraint in the use of capacitors as alternatives for batteries is clearly understood once their energy density (amount of energy they can store and retain) is compared with batteries. Using weight as a comparator, an ultra-capacitor can store six (6) watt-hours per kilo, whilst a high-performance lithium-ion battery can store 200 watt-hours per kilo. (Some people say kilogram but when I was at school I was taught that with weight it is acceptable to drop the word gram).\n\nIn June 2005 \"early stage\" experiments commenced in the Chinese city of Shanghai with electric buses powered via super-capacitors.\n\nInitial testing suggested that when fully charged the capacitors could be able to supply enough power for a bus to travel a total distance of 5km (about 3 miles & 200yds) at 44km/h (a little over 27mph), although for practicality it was proposed that recharging stations would be located approximately every 3 stops. As the images below suggest, recharging was by means of a scissors pantograph fitted to the buses' roof that made contact with an overhead power supply. For added benefit these buses featured regenerate braking, so that energy was recycled back into the capacitors - instead of just being lost as friction and heat via the brakes or rheostats.\n\nFor the initial testing the Shanghai Sunwin Bus Plant built four prototype super-capacitor electric buses, each one costing as much as 800,000 RMB, this being almost as twice expensive as a conventional Sunwin air-conditioned trolleybus. However in February 2006 it was reported that with all four test vehicles having broken down the opening of a proposed demonstration system had been postponed indefinitely.\n\nPrototype Shanghai capacitor electric bus at a recharging station. Note the use of scissors pantographs for power collection.\n\nDespite it being of the utmost importance that other vehicles do not park illegally, blocking the recharging facility, this does happen.\n\nPhotographs and much information courtesy of Zachary Jiang.\n\nHowever to properly evaluate the technology a further batch of super-capacitor buses was built, and on 28th August 2006 was placed into experimental service. These more extensive commercial trials involve Shanghai's route 11, which is a short circular trolleybus route of just 5.5km in length. This route is noted for lower levels of traffic congestion than the others, a constant passenger volume and high flow rate, with most passengers only travelling for three to five stops. This last point is significant, as it would mean that the passengers would be less likely to experience extended journey times from the frequent recharging.\n\nThe trials involve the capacitor buses travelling on the clockwise loop only, with conventional trolleybuses remaining on the counter-clockwise service. Furthermore, the trolleybus overhead for the clockwise circle is still being properly maintained, so that if the trials prove to be unsuccessful then conventional trolleybuses can return immediately.\n\nAdvance testing has shown that in theory if the air-conditioning is not in use then the capacitor buses should be capable of completing a complete loop on only one charge. However, to reduce the risk of a bus delayed in traffic congestion dissipating all its stored energy (and hence becoming stranded) plus to allow the air conditioning to be used there are in fact seven charging stations located around the loop.\n\nThese capacitor buses cost as much as 800,000 RMB each (approximately £6,600) a figure which includes the research cost. It is estimated that if the trials prove successful and they went into mass production then the cost will go down to 650,000 RMB; in comparison an air-conditioned Sunwin trolleybus costs only 400,000 RMB!\n\nHmmm, not a good start. Within a week of the trials commencing five out of the seven capacitor buses had already broken down, so to rescue the service some regular trolleybuses had to be reinstated. Apparently the problems have been blamed on the capacitors overheating under Shanghai's scorching heat. Even though it was officially autumn the weather was still hotter than had been expected. However by the end of September some of the failing capacitor buses had returned to service, with clock-wise services now being provided by a mixed fleet of capacitor buses and trolleybuses.\n\nIn addition, the capacitor bus drivers have been told that when travelling between route 11 and the garage they should use roads equipped with trolleybus overhead; this is because whilst theoretically they should be able to make the journey without recharging the high unpredictability of Shanghai's extremely congested streets makes it desirable to 'play safe' and not leave the safe haven of the overhead power lines. Although not planned as a regular feature in an emergency a capacitor bus can recharge from trolleybus overhead.\n\nReports from a visitor to Shanghai in February 2007 suggest that the trials are proceeding reasonably well. He also said that it is perhaps just as well that there are as many as seven charging stations along the loop, as buses traversing the loop are not always able to charge at every one of them. Apparently route 11 encompasses Shanghai's oldest historic relics and tourist attractions and tour buses often inadvertently park so that they block the charging points. He added that accurate docking is also essential because the charging process requires the charging facility to detect sensors on the super-capacitor bus - and this is only possible when it is stopped close to the footpath.\n\nThe visitor also reported that compared to normal trolleybuses the capacitor buses had slower acceleration and were smoother to ride - especially above 30km/h [20mph].\n\nPerhaps the most significant issues (apart from the overheating when the trials commenced) is that because of the lack of recharging facility when returning to the garage bus drivers must drive to conserve the stored energy, which means switching off the air-conditioning, very modest use of the accelerator pedal, etc. Whilst in theory it is possible to recharge from the trolleybus wires the reality is somewhat more complicated. One issue is that with the trolleybus wires being located over the centre of the road so to reach them the capacitor bus would have to block the traffic flow. Another issue is that the trolleybus wires are often much higher than the charging stations, so that even when fully stretched the pantographs on the buses might not reach them.\n\nClick the projector icon or the link below to see a video clip (in a new window) on 'youtube' showing a Shanghai super-capacitor bus raising its pantograph to charge the capacitors, plus other vehicles - including the trolleybuses operating in the opposite direction around the loop. The video was made by a visitor from Japan.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGglEyaMNXg\"\n\nIn connection with the 2010 World Fair (EXPO) being held in Shanghai 40 super-capacitor buses have been introduced for a special Expo bus service designed to also showcase Chinese technology. However things did not go well once the summer arrived, with the capacitors overheating causing some of the buses to break down. It seems that the capacitors work best when below 40°C, whilst when they reach 50°C an automatic safety lock is applied to the buses. Reports talk of dry ice being used in an attempt to keep the temperature down, however costing in excess of 500 Yuan per day per bus this represents an expensive solution. In addition, it has been found that the buses use more electricity when operating in higher temperatures, and therefore with the buses needing to be charged more often Shanghai Bus Co has also had to install more charging facilities along Expo Avenue. To allow for charging buses now spend 30 - 45 seconds at each bus stop.\n\nOn 27th January 2011 a capacitor bus which had been caught at some traffic signals on a busy but narrow two lane road somehow managed to create havoc by bringing down the trolleybus wires which it had been using to recharge. Exactly why remains unknown but it is possible that the bus driver starting moving without ensuring that the charging device had lowered. Witness reports suggest that the incident caused the twin overhead wires to collide with each other, resulting in a loud bang and lots of sparks. It is probable that the accident damaged the buses' capacitors, as afterwards it was unable to move away under its own power.\n\nThis incident caused significant traffic congestion and when other capacitor buses approached the area they spent so long in the traffic (without being able to recharge) that their stored energy was used up and they became stranded as well.\n\nOne of the Shanghai Expo 2010 super-capacitor electric buses recharging its capacitors and a close-up of the raised power collection equipment.\n\nImage & license: Wikipedia encyclopædia. Public Domain. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ShanghaiExpo2010_Shuttle_Bus.jpg\n\nBy the end of 2012 three bus routes were using capacitor buses. These are the 11, 26 and Chongming 1. In December 2012 the super-capacitor buses on route No.26 started being upgraded with a newer, lighter and more powerful ultra-capacitor power pack, and by March 2013 12 buses (half its fleet) had been upgraded.\n\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Engineering the new power pack is a high-performance nickel-carbon capacitor which combines the functions of both battery and capacitor. The higher capacity is cited as being a result of a double layer of honeycombed active carbon and electrolyte that provides a larger surface area to generate electricity. (surely they meant store and not generate?) Included in the benefits that these power packs provide are: a wider range of operating temperatures (between -40°C and +70°C), their still working well after 10,000 charge / discharge cycles, their being significantly lighter than earlier capacitor packs (down from 1.6 tons to 0.6 tons) and that the maximum range between recharges has increased from about 3 - 4km (a little under 2 - 2½ miles) to over 10km (about 6¼ miles). This last benefit means that on short routes one charge might even cover an entire end to end journey.\n\nShanghai has 20,000 mostly diesel buses and as part of a desire to reduce urban air pollution is now looking at replacing between 1000 and 2000 of them with buses that use capacitors. Local officials see capacitor buses as being ideal for inner-city urban areas which do not require high speeds, in residential housing areas and as shuttle bus feeders between residential areas and local metro (subway) stations, these being some of the locations where their not emitting any tailpipe air pollution is of the greatest benefit.\n\nEven though it is only 10 minutes the time spent charging - especially if a bus is running late according to its scheduled timetable - does represent an Achilles heel (ie: nuisance / problem). The optimal solution would be to fit these buses with trolleypoles, as then they could recharge from trolleybus wires whilst travelling - and would be able to easily perform a full day's work without delays. In addition, the overhead wiring would only be needed for relatively small segments of the route, ie: there would be no need to electrify the whole route. In-motion recharging would also solve the traffic congestion problems caused by capacitor buses stopping to recharge - as described at the third link below\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.shanghaidaily.com/Metro/public-services/Citys-supercapacitor-buses-improved/shdaily.shtml\n\nhttp://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-11/09/content_14060802.htm\n\nhttp://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90882/8163118.html\n\nOther Chinese cities which are known to use fast charge electric buses include Chongqing and Ningbo.\n\nAs of December 2013 Chongqing had 31 of these vehicles, but were planning to have a large fleet of fast charge electric buses which can recharge in just 10 minutes. Alas, the information does not cite the energy storage technology but it is probably capacitors. 1000 such buses are planned, plus an unspecified number for other nearby conurbations as well. Also in Chongqing are some natural gas - electric buses which have batteries that can be slowly charged in \"plug-in\" mode in the normal way and can also travel in \"no charging\" gas mode.\n\nIn August 2015 Ningbo introduced what will be the first of 1200 pure electric articulated buses which (they claim) only needs 10 second opportunity charges to supply enough power for 5km of travel. This is possible because it uses supercapacitors! The bus is manufactured by China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corporation Limited (CSR).\n\nWith the Chinese government advocating increased use of electric buses as a way to reduce severe urban air pollution but experience having shown that batteries do not represent a viable long-term solution it is very probable that other cities will also look to capacitor buses as an alternative option.\n\nInformation sources:\n\nhttp://www.chinabuses.org/news/2013/0823/article_7553.html\n\nhttp://www.chinabuses.org/news/2013/1104/article_7734.html\n\nhttp://www.chinabuses.org/news/2015/0810/article_9060.html\n\nConfusing Publicity Data.\n\nA Chinese company involved in building (or promoting) the capacitor buses is using confusing data which suggests that they use 40% less energy than trolleybuses. Whilst they cite regenerative braking and the lower vehicle weight of the newer buses as being the reason, by not specifying the exact vehicle types involved (ie: when built, whether rigid or articulated, etc.,) it becomes impossible for the non-critical reader to validate their comparison. It is assumed that they mean a 1950's era articulated trolleybus which lacks regenerative braking and was built with a heavy metal chassis and body, plus thick (hence weighty) window glass. If so, then just about any present-era electric bus, whether trolley or capacitor, will be significantly more energy efficient. Even more so if (like all Chinese capacitor buses) it is of a shorter rigid (ie: not articulated) type that features a specially designed lightweight body and internal fittings, plus uses regenerative braking!\n\nSofia, Bulgaria\n\nIn May 2014 a Chinese capacitor bus was sent to Sofia, the Bulgarian capital city, for a 9 month evaluation period as a regular public transport vehicle on route No.11 from Stochna Gara to Gara Iskar. At the time the bus was claimed to be able to travel the entire 20km (a little under 12½ miles) route on a single charge of just a few minutes duration. If this proves to be accurate it will indeed represent a bus industry game-changer for electric buses.\n\nAt the start of the trial it was mooted that if all went well then 600 such buses (spread over several years) would be introduced to service. At the time of this October 2015 update only the information in the links below is known.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nhttp://www.chariot-electricbus.com/pilot-projects/sofia/\n\nhttp://www.china.org.cn/business/2014-05/17/content_32413382.htm\n\nhttp://www.busandcoachbuyer.com/e-bus-makes-debut/ (2015 article reporting on a year of trial service).\n\nThe Gyrobus\n\nShanghai's trials with super-capacitors are reminiscent of a system trialled in the 1950's with what was known as a gyrobus.\n\nThe gyrobus concept was developed by Oerlikon (of Switzerland), with the intention of creating an alternative to battery-electric buses for quieter lower frequency routes where full overhead wire electrification could not be justified. The buses were equipped with a large flywheel that spun at speeds of up to 3,000 rpm, gradually slowing as the stored energy was used to provide electricity for the buses' traction motor. Power for charging the flywheel comprised of three phase AC which reached the buses via three roof-mounted booms which contacted charging points located as required / felt desirable (eg: bus stops en route, at termini, etc).\n\nFully charged a gyrobus could (typically) travel as far as 6km on a level route at speeds of up to 50 - 60km/h (depending on vehicle batch as top speeds varied from batch to batch) The installation in Yverdon (Switzerland) sometimes saw vehicles needing to travel as far as 10km on one charge, although it is not known how well they performed (or otherwise!) towards the upper end of that distance. Charging a flywheel took between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, and in an effort to reduce the time this took the supply voltage was increased from 380 volts to 500 volts. It can only be speculated whether such frequent delays would have been acceptable had the gyrobuses survived - in commercial service - into the modern era. Especially on longer routes where several charging stops could have been required or on busy, heavily trafficked roads.\n\nIn all three locations used gyrobuses in full commercial service, these being Yverdon, Switzerland, Gent, Belgium and Léopoldsville in Zaïre. Whilst the technology worked reasonably well for various reasons none of these systems lasted for more than seven years - at most.\n\nAdditional Gyrobus Information.\n\nThe gyrobuses used an asynchronous three-phase electric motor with condensers fitted on a common shaft. The motor was built on to a flywheel which (on the demonstrator) was 1.6m in diameter and weighed 1.6 tonnes. This was housed in an enclosed hydrogen-filled air-cooled casing.\n\nTo obtain tractive power condensers would excite the flywheel's charging motor so that it become a generator, in this way transforming the energy stored in the flywheel back into electricity. Vehicle braking was electric and some of the energy was recycled back into the flywheel, thereby extending its range.\n\nThe demonstrator was first displayed (and used) publically in summer 1950, and to promote the system this vehicle continued to be used for short periods of public service in a myriad of locations at least until 1954.\n\nThe first full commercial service began in autumn 1953, in Yverdon, Switzerland. However this was a route with limited traffic potential and although technically successful it was not commercially viable. Services ended in late autumn 1960, and neither of the two vehicles (nor the demonstrator) survived..\n\nThe next system to open was in Léopoldsville in Zaïre (formerly the Belgian Congo and currently known as Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic Congo). Here there were 12 vehicles (although apparently some reports erroneously suggest 17), which operated over four routes with recharging facilities being provided about every 2km. These were the largest of the gyrobuses, being 10.4m in length, weighing 10.9t, carrying up to 90 passengers and having a maximum speed of 60km/h (about 37mph).\n\nHowever all did not go well, with there being major problems related to excessive \"wear and tear\". But it seems that a significant reason for this was because the bus drivers often took shortcuts across unmade roads, which after the frequent heavy rains became nothing more that quagmires and marshes. Other problems included breaking gyro ball bearings and high humidity resulting in traction motor overload. The system's demise however came because of high energy consumption. The bus operator deemed that 3.4kWh per km, per gyrobus, was unaffordable, so closure come in the summer of 1959 with the gyrobuses being dumped next to bus garage and left to rust.\n\nThe third location to use gyrobuses commercially was Gent, Belgium. Three gyrobuses started operation in late summer 1956 but instead of being the first of a proposed multi-route network they did not last very long, being withdrawn late autumn 1959. It seems that the operator was blaming them for being unreliable \"spending more time off the road than on\" plus that their weight damaged road surfaces. They were also seen as being energy hungry, consuming 2.9kWh per km - compared to between 2.0kWh per km and 2.4kWh per km for much larger trams that carried several times the numbers of passengers. One of the three gyrobuses has been preserved as an exhibit at the Flemish tramway, trolleybus and bus museum in Antwerp, and it is sometimes displayed as a curio (or even used to carry passengers!) at Belgian exhibitions, transport enthusiasts' bazaars, etc.\n\nIn 1985 it was used in the Belgian town of Ostend as part of the 100 year celebrations of the Belgian Vicinal light railway system. Photographs of this gyrobus at a charging station and at the museum (including several views inside it) can be found at this page at the Wikipedia encyclopædia Commons:- http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gyrobus_G3\n\nA electric bus in the Dutch city of sHertogenbosch (Den Bosch).\n\nThe plug logo on the side of the bus is a marketing tool - the bus collects electricity through induction and not cables.\n\nImages: Conductix-Wampfler press release about the commencement of the Dutch trials.\n\n(Link document requires an Acrobat compatible pdf / portable document viewer.)\n\nhttp://www.conductix.com/sites/default/files/downloads/PR_12-10-01_12-meter_Electric_Bus_in_Regular_Service_with_Inductive_Opportunity_Charging.pdf\n\nThe plan is for the bus to travel 288km (179miles) per day without having to stop for prolonged periods or return to bus garage to recharge its batteries. The batteries will be fully charged overnight and topped-up by 10-15% as necessary and as possible over the course of the day.\n\nThese trials are a collaboration of several partners, including the city of sHertogenbosch (Den Bosch): Bluekens Bus & Truck (building and supplying the bus), Conductix-Wampfler (supplying and erecting the inductive charging solution), Heijmans (installing the charging points), Arriva (driver training and bus operation) and Enexis (connection of the charging system). More information:\n\nhttp://www.conductix.com/en/news/2012-10-01/first-large-electric-public-service-bus-wireless-inductive-charging-technology-tested-netherlands\n\nSince December 2012 a battery electric bus which serves Ale municipality, just north of Gothenburg, Sweden, has been taking advantage of 'spare' time between journeys to top-up its batteries using induction. Unfortunately as part of an October 2015 page update it was found that the url to further information about this no longer works.\n\nhttp://www.greengothenburg.se/new-technology-trialled-in-electric-buses\n\nIn January 2014 a five year trial in Great Britain using induction charging commenced on the 15 mile (25km) bus route No. 7 which links Wolverton and Bletchley, these being two historic towns which nowadays form districts of the English conurbation known as Milton Keynes. Whilst only seven diesel buses were needed to operate this service the extra time needed for charging the batteries when between journeys at the route termini means that eight battery electric buses are required*.\n\nThese buses will run for 17 hours a day, seven days a week. They have three battery packs per bus, one is located on the roof and the others are at the back, one each side. The batteries weigh 1.8 tonnes.\n\nThe timetables allow 13 minutes for charging, although it is expected that only 5-10 minutes will normally be needed. The extra time is to provide a margin in case of unscheduled traffic delays during the journeys. In addition to the induction power pads at the termini there will be a third charging pad in Central Milton Keynes. Whilst primarily intended for gathering performance data about how the buses are faring en-route, this induction pad is capable of charging the batteries should the need arise. The extra equipment for the induction system means that these buses have less ground clearance than is usual. Because of this and the large number of speed humps on the roads of Milton Keynes they had to be tested to ensure that they were suitable for the chosen route.\n\nThis technology trial is a collaboration of eight different businesses; more information:\n\nhttp://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/09/miltonkeynes-20120925.html\n\nhttp://www.theengineer.co.uk/energy-and-environment/news/wirelessly-charged-all-electric-bus-route-is-first-for-uk/1014019.article\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25621426\n\n* Spring 2014 update:\n\nWithin months of the service commencing the media reported that the timetables have had to be recast to allow longer time (10 - 15 minutes) for charging the electric buses and that as a result of this to maintain the headway at busy times an extra (diesel) bus has had to be drafted in. However the use of the diesel is not what was wanted and therefore there is now a desire for this extra bus to be replaced with what would be the ninth electric bus! Also worthy of note is that this issue has occurred before the electronic next stop passenger information system has been brought into use and whilst the delay is partly because not all the back-end works have been completed there is also a concern over how much power it will consume and whether this will noticeably drain the batteries - and require that even longer time is spent charging the batteries.\n\nExtended range hybrid / virtual electric bus in London.\n\nTwo films showing a ZeEUS Project extended-range hybrid virtual electric bus have been placed on the 'youtube' film / video website and can be watched by clicking the links below.\n\nA short film which just shows the bus.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BW6TY4Jc0Q\n\nA long film (nearly 20 minutes) which mostly comprises a ride inside one of these buses. Although the ride started downstairs there were so many passengers that after barely a few bus stops the film morphs into a \"front seat / upper deck / forward view\" ride through parts of east London, with added commentary (road names, bus stop names, etc). In all the ride is from Canning Town station to Stratford station.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ3wmsA5qeo\n\nIn January 2016 two more of these buses were launched in the English city of Bristol where they will be used on route No.72 which runs from City Centre to the University of the West of England (UWE) Frenchay Campus, where they will use induction to top-up their batteries. They will also use Geo-Fencing GPS technology to automatically run on pure electric mode in areas of low air quality, with the diesel engine only being used in areas of better air quality. These buses are being used in a partnership between First West of England, the Department for Transport, Bristol City Council and the University of the West of England.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttp://www.firstgroup.com/about-us/news/first-west-england-launches-revolutionary-electric-buses\n\nhttp://chargedevs.com/newswire/four-british-built-electric-buses-hit-the-streets-of-london/\n\nhttp://thinkinghighways.com/londons-first-all-electric-bus-route-to-be-operated-by-arriva/\n\nhttp://www.eurotransportmagazine.com/16648/news/industry-news/tfl-announce-two-further-electric-bus-routes-for-london/\n\n(Note that the 51 single deck electric buses for routes 507 and 521 described at this link will NOT be opportunity charged. Also not using opportunity charging will be the five BYD full-electric double deck buses which are expected to enter public service on London bus route 98 in spring 2016.)\n\nUntil now it had been thought that for a pure electric bus to have sufficient batteries to allow for reasonable distances to be travelled on a daily basis it would need batteries which weigh so much that to avoid exceeding the legal weight limit for twin axle buses the bus would either need a third axle or a lower passenger capacity. However it seems that a 'wildcard' third option is to be adopted. So desperate are certain powerful people for these buses to be found viable that the Department for Transport is going to give them a 1.5 tonne weight derogation and therefore they will be permitted to weight up to 19.5 tonnes. Without this they could not carry standing passengers, which would be unacceptable in London.\n\nIn addition, to make life easier for other bus operators to use heavier buses without also needing a derogation the legal weight limit for all twin axle buses is to be raised. The reason why road vehicles are subject to weight limits is that heavier vehicles cause greater wear on road surfaces and subterranean formations. So, it could be that local governments will find themselves needing to spend extra money, more frequently, repairing roads and bridges - this has already happened on some roads, as a result of permitting heavier goods vehicles on our roads.\n\nPRIMOVE\n\nIn autumn 2008 a major transport vehicle manufacturer announced proposals for an induction system which would be installed under the road along (much of) the transports' route, with the vehicles drawing power as they travel over it; and also storing their own regenerated braking energy to lower the overall demand on the power supply system when the vehicle is accelerating from rest and permit operation at locations where there is no power supply. At first this was conceived with trams in mind however it was soon realised that the technology should be suitable for road vehicles as well - including electric buses.\n\nThe company is Bombardier, the technology is known as PRIMOVE. The trails with trams also involved the Mitrac capacitor energy storage system which was created for regenerative braking but also allows trams to travel short distances without an external power supply. For trials with buses Bombardier have developped an entirely new high-power nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) lithium-ion battery which has been optimised to maximise performance and includes an advanced thermal conditioning unit which maintains its ideal temperature, enables rapid charging and recovery of braking energy recovery plus has an expected life span of up to ten years.\n\nFor trams the buried Primove inductive loops will typically be located between the tracks / above the sleepers at tram stops and on uphill gradients. For street trackage they would need to be covered by a 40mm layer of non-conductive material such as resin, asphalt base or non-reinforced concrete. Away from the inductive loops the tram would be powered by the Mitrac stored energy system. For rubber tyred road transports the buried Primove inductive loops will be placed at bus stops and dedicated charging locations.\n\nThe charging pads are eight metres in length and fed by an inverter which transforms 750v DC into 200 kHz AC. They are only 'live' when the transport is over them. The transmission efficiencies of 90% - 95% are claimed to be only 2% less than those achieved with physical contact systems.\n\nSeveral locations have been involved in research, development and trails, these are summarised below. The best place for more information is the Primove website - the link below leads to a page on the Primove website from where it is possible to download fact sheets with in-depth specifications for the entire project and the various specific urban projects. Note that these are in pdf (portable document) format and depending on computer operating system may require the installation of the free Adobe Acrobat (or equivalent) pdf reader. As the pdf format data sheets suggest, development works with buses have involved partnerships with various bus manufacturers.\n\nhttp://primove.bombardier.com/ .\n\nMore about wireless charging can be read here:\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/2013/03/wireless-charging-bus-germany/\n\nAfter initial development works had started in 2003, the first test track in a non-public location was created in 2009 at a Bombardier factory in Bautzen, Germany. This was 1km in length.\n\nThe first pilot demonstration trials within the public domain involved a specially modified Bombardier low-floor tram which used an 800m section of tramway which is only used in public service during events at the exhibition centre in Augsburg, Germany. This proved the systems reliability under all environmental conditions and full compliance with all applicable codes and standards for electromagnetic compatibility. A May 2012 press release discussed the success of these trials which began in 2010 and also revealed that trails had been underway with an electric road vehicle and that a new Centre of Excellence for electric mobility technology had been built in Mannheim.\n\nIn October 2010 Bombardier joined the Flanders DRIVE project in Lommel (Belgium) in which a consortium of industrial companies and R&D specialists came together to research the potential of inductive charging for electric road vehicles. The 125 metre test track has been used by both a bus and a Volvo C30 car. The bus was involved in both dynamic and static trials and the car in solely static trials.\n\nThe Mannheim Centre of Excellence for Primove technology actually opened in September 2011. Then in November 2012 the first Primove equipped e-bus was homologated for operation on public roads. Further developments in Mannheim have included real-world trials on bus route No.63 which is 9km in length, serves 21 bus stops and has an approximate 33 minute end-to-end journey time. Included in this project is the installation of eight inductive charging pads - one at each route terminus (for charges of up to 7 minutes), five at intermediate bus stops (for charges of up to 2 minutes) and charging pad at the bus garage (for charges of up to 15 minutes). Two buses were involved in this 12 month project during which time they became the first Primove equipped induction buses to carry fare-paying passengers.\n\nTrials in Mannheim also involved a Primove equipped electric van which was used as a service vehicle. This e-van was only charged at the bus garage, a process which usually took about three hours.\n\nMay 2013 saw the commencement of a further round of trials, this time in the German city of Braunschweig. This is known as Project EMIL. The buses travel in public service on route M19 which comprises a 12km loop service around the city that has a typical journey duration of 37 minutes. The first of the buses arrived late 2013. This was the 12 metre vehicle which has a 60 kWh battery. Passenger services using this bus were launched on 27th March 2014. On 22nd December 2014 four 18 metre Solaris Urbino 18 articulated buses (which have 90 kWh batteries) were introduced, replacing the diesel buses on this service. All five battery electric buses receive a full overnight charge plus approximately 11 minute top-up charges on a 200kW inductive charging pad whilst between journeys at the route terminus (the main railway station). Experience has shown that the battery on the 12m bus is about half empty after one journey around the loop. The articulated buses also receive 30 second boost charges at two intermediate charging pads which are about 4km into the route and then 6km along the route. This therefore is true opportunity charging - as only the buses which need the extra charge use the intermediate boost charging pads. An unexpected surprise is the need for a blowing unit to keep the charging plate free of leaves.\n\nIn August 2015 a Primove trial commenced in the German city of Berlin. This is the first time that a wirelessly charged electric bus had been used in a capital city. The four 12m Solaris buses with Vossloh Kiepe electric drive and higher rated 90 kWh batteries are used on inner-city route No.204 between Südkreuz and Zoologischer Garten (Hertzallee). At night their batteries are fully charged using the four direct (wired) charging stations which have also been built at the bus garage. At the same time the air-conditioning (or heating) is run so that the bus will be fully ready for public service in the mornings. The bus garage also has a mobile charging station. During the day the buses receive 4-7 minute top-up charges from induction pads at the route termini. There are no intermediate charging pads. Someone who lives in Berlin has suggested that there have been issues with parked vehicles blocking the induction charging pads and this has (at times) 'made life difficult'.\n\nIn October 2015 two Primove equipped 9.7 metre Van Hool A308-EV battery electric midi-buses which have 36kWh batteries were introduced on a brand new bus route in the Belgian city of Bruges. This 5.6km service travels along historic narrow streets and through the middle of the medieval old town, which is a designated Unesco world heritage site. A fully charged battery enables the e-bus to travel for 45 minutes without recharging. After serving the route a few times back and forth, the e-buses are recharged at the 200 kW PRIMOVE charging facility which is at the bus garage. Two e-buses are used on weekdays and one on Saturdays.\n\nMontreal, Canada\n\nA Primove technology trial in an extreme cold weather climate has also been suggested for a private test track on Île-Sainte-Hélène, the home of Expo 67, Montréal, Canada. The first two links below reference winter 2013 / 2014 however as the third but no longer working link suggested, this did not happen. This is still believed to be planned, as a first stage towards the possible full commercial use of inductive powered buses in Montréal. Included in the information which it is needed to learn during the trials is how the technology copes with some of the harshest wintry conditions that can be expected in an inhabited area. This data is important to help plan the number of inductive charging points which would be required for a fully commercial service to be viable, bearing in mind the high amounts of power needed for winter heating and summer cooling - not just of the interior of the bus but also the batteries, as these too work best at within a certain temperature range.\n\nThese two links reference the planned winter trial:\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bombardier-to-test-electric-buses-that-charge-wirelessly-1.1385344\n\nhttp://business.financialpost.com/news/transportation/bombardier-electric-technology-to-be-tested-on-buses-in-montreal-germany\n\nThis two-page Montreal Gazette newspaper article explained why the trials did not commence within the originally mooted time frame, unfortunately the article is no longer online and the link is dead.\n\nhttp://www.montrealgazette.com/business/Bombardier+electric+takes+road+Germany/9669923/story.html\n\nOther Induction\n\nAlso involved in opportunity charging via induction of stationary battery-electric buses is the US-based Wave inc. WAVE is an acronym for Wireless Advanced Vehicle Electrification. The technology was developed at Utah State University although it is now being marketed by WAVE inc., which is a spin-out company. WAVE mostly uses 50kw charging pads, although their first electric bus, which operates shuttle services within the Utah State University campus, uses a 25w charging pad. This vehicle is nicknamed the Aggie Bus.\n\nTheir website lists seven sets of projects which use WAVE induction charging, enabling battery buses to stay on the road all day. Their projects include over a dozen Chinese BYD battery electric buses, electric buses sourced from within the USA and the replacement of a diesel vintage trolley styled bus with one that uses battery electric propulsion.\n\nThis link leads to the WAVE website:\n\nhttp://www.waveipt.com/\n\nWhilst it is hoped to be being fair to all organisations which are trialing these new technologies with public transport vehicles and at least mention them, there always remains the possibility of lower profile developments remaining unknown.\n\nMoving Vehicles\n\nMuch more challenging than with stationary vehicles is the ability to supply energy using induction to a vehicle which is in free motion on a road and to ensure that it works even with a constantly changing gap between the vehicle and the road surface.\n\nThe concept is not new, as in the early 1990's proof-of-concept trials were carried out with a 35 seat Roadway Powered Electric Vehicle (RPEV) at the University of California Richmond Field Station. The trials saw the burying of power conductors under a 700ft (about 213m) test track and an operational RPEV which featured a needle dial so that as the vehicle travelled along the road the driver could see the strength of the charging current being received and accurately locate the vehicle above the under-road power supply.\n\nThe RPEV system was shown on television as being able to draw enough power from below the road surface that it could also roam away from the power source, so that perhaps a main road serving many bus routes would be electrified but they would be able to make short scheduled detours in battery electric mode. However despite the technology still being in need of refining before it would be ready for full commercial exploitation once these trains had been completed the project became stalled. Perhaps this was because between 1992 and 2000 the USA had a President who was a member of the oil industry - if so then the lack of further development is not at all surprising. A report on these trials used to be available online at this link, which no longer leads anywhere.\n\nhttp://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/record/tris/00773755.html.\n\nBut whilst the American leadership did everything it could to roll back further development in electric transport technologies (with increased use of fossil fuels being the primary aim) further development work in Korea resulted (in March 2010) in a more advanced variant of the RPEV being launched in Seoul, Korea. Known as the On-Line Electric Vehicle (OLEV) the technology is being tested on a 2.2km route at Seoul zoo which is served by a 'road train' that had previously been criticised for its diesel exhaust fumes.\n\nResearchers at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) succeeded in refining the technology so that it offers power transmission pick-up capacity of 62kw, at up to 74% efficiency, over an air gap between the road surface and the bottom of the vehicle of around 12cm - 13cm (about 5\").\n\nIf the technology proves viable it will be installed along the bus lanes in many city streets, as since buses account for 30% of all city traffic so electrifying them is being seen as providing a significant impact in reducing urban air pollution. It is estimated that only about 20% of a route's entire length would need electrifying, although if evidence from the OLEV is correct then this would include bus termini so that buses could be recharging their batteries whilst stationary between journeys.\n\nA different press release talks about an experimental plan which would see power strips between 20cm (about 8\") to 90 cm (about 35\") wide and perhaps several hundred metres long being built into the road surface along about 10% of the entire road system of an urban area, so that road vehicles will only need small batteries which store enough energy for about 50 miles (about 80km) of travel. These small batteries would be about a fifth (20%) of the size of the batteries used in existing battery vehicles.\n\nThe next stage of the development of OLEV technology is for a public bus service to use it. This is underway in the Korean city of Gumi. The news.kahn.co.kr article linked below suggests that the trials will involve a bus (similar to those used on the Namsan area seen above) travelling on a 12km (about 7½mile) route making about 10 journeys daily. Although there is additional information the online translation is not robust enough to understand exactly what is being said.\n\nHowever information from other sources (printed paper and online) suggests that the Gumi trial involves two battery-electric buses and that only 10% - 15% of the route followed by the buses will need equipping with inductive power supply for them to have enough power in their batteries to ply the entire distance. The online German language newspaper (Bild.de - link below) says that the bus route used by the trial buses is 24km in length; this is somewhat confusing although perhaps the higher figure refers to the distance travelled on return journeys.\n\nThe under-road power strips are 5 metres in length. They can be laid end-to-end to create longer sections of roadway power, with only the section under the bus being energised at a time. The air gap between the road surface and power collector on the bus is approximately 17cm (a little under 7\").. Transfer efficiency of the 20 kHz / 100 kW power emitted from the cables is rated at maximum 85% and one source of information has stated a concern about the remaining (unused) 15% of the energy causing stray current leakage which would breach European Union Electromagnetic Compatibility regulations, which leaves a question mark over this system's suitability for use in Europe.\n\nFuture plans are that in 2015 there will be ten more battery-electric buses (ie: 12 in total). Another online source suggests that pilot trials are being planned in four other Korean regions.\n\nFurther information:\n\nhttp://olev.kaist.ac.kr/en/\n\nhttp://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/03/117_62152.html\n\nhttp://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201301102209555&code=940100\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/2013/08/induction-charged-buses/\n\nhttp://kojects.com/2013/08/13/wireless-charging-electric-bus-in-gumi/\n\nhttp://smfir.co.kr/ (Kaist Wireless Power Transfer Research Center)\n\nhttp://www.bild.de/auto/auto-news/alternativer-antrieb/strasse-elektroautos-kabellos-laden-31708204.bild.html\n\nhttp://chargedevs.com/features/olev-technologies-dynamic-wireless-inductive-system-charges-vehicles-while-in-motion/\n\nhttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-08/tkai-kwo080513.php"
