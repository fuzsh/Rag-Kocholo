        "text": "Helsinki can be reached easily from anywhere in the world. The Helsinki airport is approximately 20 kilometers away from the center of Helsinki. Alternatively, one can consider arrival by ferry (from Stockholm, Tallinn, Germany etc.) or by train (from St. Petersburg).\n\nArrival to Helsinki from Helsinki Airport (also known as Helsinki-Vantaa airport)\n\nTaxi stands are located right outside the arrival areas of the terminals. A trip by taxi from the airport to the Helsinki city center takes about 20 minutes and costs around 40-45 EUR. Confirm the price with the driver beforehand.\n\nCommuter trains (lines I and P) from the airport arrive at the main railway station of Helsinki in about 30 minutes. The required ABC zone ticket costs about 5.00 EUR. Tickets must be bought from ticket machines before entering the train. The train schedule is available at the HSL web pages.\n\nBuses (615) and the Finnair City Bus operate between downtown Helsinki and the Helsinki airport. Finnair City Buses depart every 20 minutes, and tickets (7 EUR for a one-way ticket) are sold in the buses. For more information see the link below.\n\nHow to get to the University campus\n\nPublic Transport in Helsinki\n\nPublic transport in Helsinki is extensive and includes metro, trams, buses, trains, and ferries. In the downtown area the most convenient way to travel is by trams or by foot.\n\nYou can travel with single tickets (AB zone) or with a day ticket. Single tickets can be purchased easily from ticket machines, via HSL app or sales points. Note, that tickets are not sold on board in the metro, in the commuter trains or in trams. Day tickets for the unlimited use of public transport (metro, commuter train, tram, bus, ferry service) are sold, e.g., at the Helsinki City Transport service point in the Central Railway Station or R-kioski stores. If you plan to buy a ticket from a bus driver, please prepare to have small change of cash ready.\n\nMore information about the public transport\n\nCurrency\n\nThe official currency in Finland is Euro (€, EUR).\n\nTime\n\nThe time zone in Helsinki is Eastern European Time (EET), 2 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (UTC/GMT+2 hours).\n\nClimate\n\nHelsinki has a humid continental climate. Owing to the mitigating influence of the Baltic Sea and North Atlantic Current, temperatures during the winter are higher than the northern location might suggest, with the average in January and February around −5 °C (23 °F).\n\nThe average temperature in Helsinki in June is very mild at 16 °C (60.8 °F). Afternoons can be warm with average high temperatures reaching 20 °C (68 °F). Overnight temperatures are generally quite mild with an average low of 12 °C (53.6 °F). The weather in June is somewhat dry with occasional rain.\n\nCredit cards\n\nCredit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) are widely accepted and even preferred over cash. Finland prefers chip and PIN authentication, and you would fail to buy gas at one of the unmanned stations if you do not have one. City buses and outdoor market vendors will not accept credit cards. For an ATM machine, look for the sign “OTTO”. These 24-hour cashpoint machines are widely available.\n\nElectricity\n\nVoltage: 220–240 Volts. Electrical sockets (outlets) in Finland are one of the two European standard electrical socket types: ”Type C” Europlug and ”Type E/F” Schuko.\n\nSee & Do\n\nHelsinki is full of culture. Consider visiting and enjoying the many peaceful islands in front of Helsinki, the amusement park Linnanmäki, Natural History Museum, Ateneum, Kiasma and other art exhibitions, music halls, opera and ballet, the seaside with beaches with a possibility to rent boats and canoes, and the numerous places to enjoy Nordic cuisine.
