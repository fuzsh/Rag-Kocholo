        "text": "See big, bold and genuine Alaska! Follow its scenic highways and famed Alaska Railway into rustic towns and through majestic Denali National Park, visit an Iditarod dog kennel, and view breathtaking, snow-mantled mountains.\n\nDay 1\n\nAfter disembarking the ship in Seward, you will meet your tour director and begin driving to Girdwood. The road passes through some of America’s most spectacular scenery and holds three scenic designations: USDA Forest Service Scenic Byway, Alaska Scenic Byway, and All-American Road. On the way, enjoy a stop at an organization dedicated to preserving Alaska’s wildlife. The center is a home and a refuge for many animals; bear, moose, elk, and other wildlife that call Alaska home.\n\nUpon arriving at the Hotel Alyeska or similar, and checking in, you may wish to enjoy a ride to the top of Mt. Alyeska on the aerial tramway for a spectacular view of the surrounding area with its seven glaciers. (not included). The rest of the day and evening are to enjoy as you please. Meals are on your own.\n\nDay 2\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel, begin your 4-hour scenic tour from Girdwood to Denali via the George Parks Highway, which winds through the kind of scenery that defines the Alaskan interior: tundra, soaring mountain peaks, glaciers, forests, wild rivers, and vast expanses primarily inhabited by animals such as moose, grizzlies, foxes and birds.\n\nIn time, you will visit an Iditarod Sled Dog Kennel and learn about this truly Alaskan competition. Note: this is not a ride with the dogs. Traveling from Anchorage to Nome on the Bering Sea coast, each Iditarod team of 12 to 16 dogs and their musher cover 1,150 miles of Alaska’s most rugged terrain in 10 to 17 days. Add temperatures well below zero, scouring winds, and long hours of darkness, and it is no wonder that the Iditarod is called the last Great Race on Earth.\n\nOnce you reach Denali, you will be transferred to the Grande Denali Lodge or similar, which perches on the edge of a bluff less than a mile from the entrance to Denali National Park.\n\nFollowing an enlightening private lecture on Denali, your evening is free to enjoy dinner on-own and an overnight at the lodge.\n\nNOTE: Guests on Explorer's August 7th, 2024 sailing will stay at Denali Park Village as Grand Denali Lodge is not available.\n\nDay 3\n\nThe day starts with an early breakfast at the lodge and then the Denali Natural History Tour. Focusing on the rich natural and cultural history of the park, this program includes several interpretive stops and an hour off-bus experience.

All along the way your naturalist driver-guide will provide a great introduction to the landscape, geology, and history of Denali National Park and Preserve. Tours are conducted in school busses.\n\nNOTE: due to a massive landslide and subsequent damage to certain roadways in the park, there may not be an opportunity to upgrade to the Tundra Wilderness Tour depending on how far along the Park is with reconstruction on the roadways. Your Tour Director will be able to provide more information while you are on the tour.\n\nUpon returning to the lodge, enjoy the rest of the day at your leisure, before overnighting at the lodge.\n\nNOTE: Guests on Explorer's August 7th, 2024 sailing will stay at Denali Park Village as Grand Denali Lodge is not available.\n\nDay 4\n\nAfter breakfast at the lodge, your morning is free to further enjoy Denali National Park.\n\nLater this morning, you will have time to explore before boarding an Alaska Railroad train. As you travel the 4.5 hours to Talkeetna, seating is upstairs in the Dome where you will enjoy views from all sides of the railcar and lunch is included downstairs in the dining room. Then, arrive into the town of Talkeetna, whose downtown is a National Historic Site.\n\nContinuing south, you will drive to Anchorage and check-in at the Marriott Hotel in Anchorage or similar hotel. The rest of the day and evening are yours to enjoy as you please.\n\nDay 5\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel, transfer to the Anchorage airport for your flight home.\n\nThe hotel check-out time is 11:00am.

Changes to the availability of flights, flight and tour schedules or other itinerary components out of the cruise line’s control may require an adjustment to the final itinerary. The local ground operator will handle meal vouchers, train tickets, or tour tickets included in the program.

There may also be a need to climb steps or stairs on occasion. Guests who utilize a wheelchair and those with mobility concerns are advised to check with the cruise line in advance to see if any portion of the tour program may not be considered suitable for their individual situation.

Changes to the availability of flights, flight and tour schedules or other itinerary components out of the cruise line’s control may require an adjustment to the final itinerary. The local ground operator will handle meal vouchers, train tickets, or tour tickets included in the program.

Gather you luggage and meet your driver before departing from the coastal town of Seward. Enjoy a scenic two-hour drive along the Kenai Peninsula and through the stunning Turnagain Pass while along the way, your driver-guide will provide you the history of the Peninsula and Turnagain Pass from the Indigenous people who first lived there, to Russian fur traders to the discovery of gold, coal, and oil. Coming down out of Turnagain Pass you will have a spectacular view of Cook Inlet as you enter Turnagain Arm and the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center.\n\nFounded in 1993 the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center is a nonprofit sanctuary that is dedicated to preservation, education, research, and animal care. The center takes in injured and orphaned animals to rehabilitate and provide permanent homes at the center. The center is home to a variety of Alaskan animals including Lynx, Foxes, Coyotes, Wood Bison, Musk Ox, Brown and Black Bears, Deer, Elk, Caribou, Reindeer, and a Bald Eagle.\n\nYour driver will take you on a guided loop of the facility, giving you information about the animals at the center. From there you will have free time to explore the grounds for up close views of the animals and time to explore the gift shop. Note: From May through September the Forget-Me-Not Foods food truck or similar is on site and open daily serving hot/cold beverages, grab-n-go snacks, and lunch items for anyone looking for a snack before arriving in Alyseska.\n\nAfter exploring the Center, you will continue down the Turnagain Arm to the former Gold Mining town turned ski resort of Girdwood. Arriving at the Alyeska Resort you will be given tickets to the Aerial Tram which heads up Mt Alyeska. At the top of the tram, you will have a gorgeous view of the Turnagain Arm and the valley including several glaciers. Sit back and relax and with the included $25 per person meal voucher you can enjoy some food or a drink on the deck or in the Boar Tide lounge.\n\nWhen you are ready head back down the mountain to the resort and check in for the night. The evening is at your leisure and dinner is on your own.\n\nNote: your driver-guide will drop off the luggage at the hotel while the group is enjoying the views from Mt. Alyeska. Guests can return to the hotel at leisure. Luggage will be delivered to the rooms by the bellman.\n\nDAY 2\n\nEnjoy a morning at leisure at the Resort. From the resort some of the options available are a helicopter tour to a glacier, a ride with sled dogs on the original Iditarod trail, you can rent eBikes, or simply relax in their world class Nordic Spa. Optional activities are at own cost and subject to availability through the resort. Reservations cannot be made via RSSC.\n\nIn the evening, enjoy a breathtaking scenic float down Portage Creek. View Hanging Glaciers, wildlife, and relax on this mellow scenic float. After your float enjoy a delicious salmon bake meal under the midnight sun before returning to your hotel.\n\nNote: the float trip takes place rain or shine. The river is Class 1 therefore no rapids.

The center was created by a unanimous vote of the Alaska Federation of Natives in 1987, which called for the establishment of a statewide Alaska Native culture center. It offers a unique experience for you to learn and explore the traditional and contemporary ways of Alaska’s Indigenous cultures. More than a museum, the Center is a place to engage through interact guided tours, dance performances, and Alaska Native Games demonstrations.
