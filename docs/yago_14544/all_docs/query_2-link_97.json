        "text": "Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai? is a Hindi drama movie that explores the journey of a common man who is angry at the world around him. The film, which is a remake of the 1980 classic with the same name, takes the audience on a thought-provoking ride that touches upon several pertinent issues. The movie starts with the protagonist, Albert Pinto, being missing from his home. His girlfriend Stella and his family are trying to find him, but he has left no clues behind. Soon, the movie jumps back in time to show how Albert's life was before he went missing.\n\nAlbert (played by Manav Kaul) is a hot-headed young man who works in the interiors of Mumbai. He is frustrated with his mundane life, his job, and the way he is treated in society. He sees corruption and injustice all around him and feels helpless to do anything about it. His frustration turns into anger, and he lashes out at those around him.\n\nAlbert's girlfriend, Stella (played by Nandita Das), is a writer who shares his frustration with the world. She is the only calming influence in Albert's life, but their relationship is strained due to his temper.\n\nThe movie takes a turn when Albert's old friend, Namdev (played by Amarjeet Amle), comes to Mumbai to visit him. Namdev is heartbroken because he has been betrayed by a friend, and he wants Albert's help to get justice. Albert, who is already angry, agrees to help Namdev.\n\nThe two friends set out on a journey to find Namdev's friend, and along the way, they encounter several people who are struggling with their own problems. The movie portrays the different shades of human nature, including greed, corruption, and kindness.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the audience is taken on a journey of self-discovery, where Albert learns to let go of his anger and embrace empathy. The movie has its moments of humor, but the tone remains serious throughout. The climax of the movie is poignant and leaves a lasting impact on the viewers.\n\nOverall, Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai? is a thought-provoking movie that touches upon several relevant issues. The performances by the lead actors are excellent, and the movie is well-paced. The cinematography captures the essence of Mumbai, and the music adds to the overall impact of the film.\n\nThe movie makes the audience question the status quo and encourages them to stand up against injustice. It is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys meaningful cinema that has a lasting impact."
