But we’ll now finally find out who he is.\n\nSo Albert Pinto ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hain is a Bollywood crime drama film which is inspired by the 1980 film of the same name. The MICANVAS team came up with the great idea of creating a buzz around the campus by replacing all name tags of participants with “Albert Pinto”. This is called “Buzz marketing” and it is used to make content go viral. It creates emotion, energy, excitement, or anticipation about a product or service. This is how Albert Pinto became a part of the activation exercise at MICANVAS 2018.\n\nActivation is something that happens every year during MICANVAS. It is done to unveil the theme of that year’s MICANVAS officially. Excitement around the event builds exponentially once the theme is announced. The campus becomes more colourful and lively than it ever was. MICANVAS is a part of every MICAN’s best memories at college and this is how PGP 25 made a ficonal character the brand ambassador of MICANVAS 2018!"
