        "text": "A Selected List of Indian Films & Videos in the Library of Congress\n\nJump to: Introduction | List of Films | Guidelines for Viewing Films & Videotapes\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the richest and most interesting collections in the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center of the Library of Congress is the ninety feature films and one hundred short films that make up the Indian Film Collection. While this Division has several outstanding collections of foreign film, the Indian collection is unique because it represents the aesthetic choice of a group of experts in Indian film, the best known being Erik Barnouw. Dr. Barnouw was Chief of this Division from 1979 to 1981. He had long been interested in Indian film, and had co-authored one of the first books written on the subject outside India [Erik Barnouw and S. Krishnaswamy, Indian Film (New York, Oxford, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1963)].\n\nBut in the Library of Congress, interest alone does not produce a collection. Instrumental in obtaining these films were Paul Spehr, the Assistant Chief of this Division, who became an expert in Indian film in his own right, and Gene Smith of the New Delhi Office of the Overseas Operations Division of the Library, who are passionately interested in obtaining the best possible films and videos from India for our collection. The Library has also benefitted from the recommendations of a number of Indian film scholars. The former director of the National Film Archive of India in Poona, P. K. Nair compiled a list of recommended titles which were an invaluable guide. Mr. Nair's recommendations supplemented those of Daniel Sauri of the Library's office in New Delhi. The respected film critic Chidananda Das Gupta provided sage analysis of both recommendations and made several worthwhile additions. The publications of the Calcutta Film Society Chitrabani, directed by Father Gaston Roberge were a cornerstone of documentation of serious cinema in India. Negotiations and purchase of prints was arranged by Anil Srivastava of Cendit, who worked closely with the National Film Archive to locate films for the Library. Thanks are also due to Alice Knistern, who is obtaining new films and videos for the Library. In putting this collection together, the Library was also extremely fortunate in being able to make use of the Special Foreign Purchase fund. We can only hope that this Foreign Purchase Fund does not come to an end, so that we can continue to enrich this marvelous collection.\n\nExperts in Indian film will quickly notice that many of these films represent the best of what has been called in India parallel cinema or new cinema; the attempt to produce an intellectual, socially committed body of film in opposition to the immensely powerful commercial cinema of India. There are three films by Mrinal Sen, sixteen by Satajit Ray and five by Ritwak Ghatak. However, there are also many films from the Bombay Talkies era, a devotional film (Sant Tukuram) as well as a film featuring the bullwhip-cracking Fearless Nadia (Diamond Queen), and the epic music and dance film Chandralekha. The serious scholar should be able to find all sorts of film in this collection.\n\nA few words of caution. Most of these films are in the original language and are not subtitled in English. The numbers in the upper right corners of the page (e.g. FBC 1200-1202) are our shelf numbers. In some cases, films have not been processed, in which case the number will be an arrearage number, such as 21C. In this case, there will be a delay of several weeks at least before the researcher can see the film.\n\nIn addition, this is a selected list of Indian films in the Library. The researcher should remember that the Library is constantly receiving films and video. For instance, the Library is starting to receive Indian features on 1/2\" videocassette through Copyright deposit which are not yet on this list. If you have any questions, please telephone a reference librarian at (202) 707-8572, or write to:\n\nCooper C. Graham, May 1992\n\nList of Films\n\n22 JUNE 1897 21B 1980.
