        "text": "Amidst the Twitter war that has erupted between Anurag Kashyap and Vivek Agnihotri over the latter’s film, The Kashmir Files, Nukkad director Saeed Akhtar Mirza has shared his thoughts on the much discussed movie. In a recent interview, the screenwriter and director has called the film ‘garbage’, but added that the ‘Kashmiri Pandit issue’ wasn’t.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSAEED AKHTAR MIRZA TRASHES VIVEK AGNIHOTRI’S THE KASHMIR FILES\n\nIn an interview with Indian Express, screenwriter and director Saeed Akhtar Mirza dissed The Kashmir Files. He said, “For me, The Kashmir Files is garbage. Is the Kashmiri Pandit issue garbage? No, it’s not. It’s real. Is it just Kashmiri Hindus? No. Muslims, too, are caught in an incredibly vulgar trap of the machinations of intelligence agencies, nations with so-called national interests, and paid guys from across the border, who continue to create havoc. The point is not to take sides. Be human and try to understand.”\n\nSaeed Akhtar Mirza has written films like Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho (1984), Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai (1980), Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro (1989) and Naseem (1995). He has helmed TV shows like Nukkad (1986) and Intezaar (1988).\n\nNADAV LAPID HAD CALLED THE KASHMIR FILES ‘PROPAGANDA, VULGAR MOVIE’\n\nEarlier, Israeli filmmaker Nadav Lapid, who was also the jury head of the International Film Festival of India, courted major controversy when he spoke about The Kashmir Files at the closing ceremony of the festival. He had said, \"All of us are disturbed. It felt to us like a propaganda, vulgar movie inappropriate for an artistic competitive section of such a prestigious competition. I feel totally comfortable in sharing these feelings openly on stage since the spirit of the festival truly accepts critical discussion which is essential for art and life.\"\n\nVIVEK AGNIHOTRI TO MAKE THE KASHMIR FILES UNREPORTED"
