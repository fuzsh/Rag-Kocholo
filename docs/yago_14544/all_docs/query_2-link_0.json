He makes friendly relations with his customers, who are usually the rich of the city and who keep telling him that good workers do not go on strike, and that strikes are the handiwork of low-class elements. Pinto gets angry with the supposedly wrong attitudes of the workers who he assumes go on strike under any pretext. However, when Pinto's father, who is a mill worker is abused by the low-class elements hired by the mill owners, he realizes that it is not the workers, but the capitalists who should be blamed for the plight of the workers. He also realizes the legitimacy of strikes. Towards the end of the movie, Pinto still remains an angry man; but now his anger is directed against the capitalists, not the striking workers.[6]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nNaseeruddin Shah as Albert Pinto\n\nShabana Azmi as Stella D'Costa\n\nSmita Patil as Joan Pinto\n\nDilip Dhawan as Dominic Pinto\n\nSulabha Deshpande as Mrs. Pinto, Albert's mother\n\nArvind Deshpande as Mr. Pinto, Albert's father\n\nRohini Hattangadi as Vivek's wife\n\nAchyut Potdar as Chandumal Potdar (mill owner)\n\nMushtaq Khan as The Lecherous Shopper tying to flirt with Joan Pinto\n\nAnjali Paigankar\n\nOm Puri as Madhu (mechanic)\n\nSatish Shah\n\nAvtar Gill\n\nUtpal Dutt\n\nNaresh Suri\n\nNitin Sethi\n\nCrew\n\n[edit]\n\nAssistant script writer: Sudhir Mishra\n\nAssistant Director: Ajay Mishra\n\nCostume Design: Jennifer Mirza, Kundan Shah\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Nominee / work Award Result 1981 Saeed Akhtar Mirza Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie Won\n\nRemake\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2017 the film was remade with the same title.
