Come view the classic film Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai (What Angers Albert Pinto?) (1980), which explores the daily struggles of the working class and how memory and desire shape our political consciousness. The film follows protagonist Albert Pinto, a car mechanic, on his journey towards political awakening.\n\nAcclaimed theater director and producer Sunil Shanbag will present video clips of his theater productions. Shanbag has been working on productions that reclaim and review moments of history of the city. His presentation will help frame this 1980 classic for this screening in the very mill district where the film is set.\n\nPhoto: UnCommonSense"
