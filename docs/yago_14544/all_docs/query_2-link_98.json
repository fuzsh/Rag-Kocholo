        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIT'S amazing how the weather is blamed for everything. The other day, I screamed my head off like a twerp. And then I apologised saying, “Sorry, it's the weather!” And I remembered seeing a movie called ‘Albert Pinto ko gussa kyon aata hai’.\n\nIT''S amazing how the weather is blamed for everything. The other day, I screamed my head off like a twerp. And then I apologised saying, â€œSorry, it''s the weather!â€� And I remembered seeing a movie called â€˜Albert Pinto ko gussa kyon aata haiâ€™.\n\nThe only difference was that Pinto, unlike me, did not blame the weather. But, then, even while playing the role of a common Pinto, Naseeruddin Shah could get hot under the collar without blaming the weather.\n\nMaybe he was paid not to blame the weather. Maybe he was commissioned to act like an uncommon common man who would blame everything else but the weather!\n\nIn Delhi, where I once used to work as a journalist before returning to cooler Bangalore, you could always tell the reporters from the sub-editors.\n\nThe former went round from Bhawan to Bhawan -- Udyog to Rail -- while the latter sat under cool summer fans, editing the daily contributions of the correspondent-types.\n\nNow and then a sun-struck reporter would scream at what had been done to his or her copy (journalese for reports -- also referred to as story and not be confused with the stuff kiddies demand at bedtime!) while the more relaxed subs merely smiled, said â€œThere, thereâ€� and tried their best not to ring up 100 to summon the police, 101 to put out the fire or 102 to summon an ambulance with attendants holding straitjackets!\n\nSometimes, the sub would be reduced to tears -- the reporters were often male and those who subbed female. Sometimes, when aggressive reporters were engaged to affectionate subs, the firewords would begin the next morning when the former would walk up to the latter, insisting on knowing why their copy had been â€˜mutilatedâ€™.\n\nâ€œYeh aapne kya kiya?â€� the reporter would glare at his fiancee. â€œYou could have asked me if you had to condense the story. Now you''ve gone and changed the meaning. What do I tell my source?â€� And so on and so forth -- painful to see and painful to hear!\n\nInvariably, these arguments would end in a great reconciliation. And everything would be hunky-dory until the next round of fireworks! Sometimes, when the reporter and the sub were already married, the situation would get even more complex. I once knew a reporter who would insist on having these arguments in the office since home, as he put it, was not the place for official discussions.\n\nThe only problem was that his spouse did not quite like the idea of any spat -- even an official one -- being held in the office. But our correspondent saw nothing unusual in smilingly escorting his spouse to her office chair, going back to his chair and then standing up and walking towards the better half, ready for official battle. His spouse would keep mum during these discussions which began and ended like monologues! Sometimes, when it all got too much, she would scribble a note and leave it on his table.\n\nOn one such occasion, this reporter read the note left by his spouse after a discussion and started shivering. He passed it on to me and said, â€œWhat do you think will happen now?â€� The note from the spouse merely said, â€œWait till you get home.â€�\n\nThe reporter came up to me 10 times during the day and kept asking â€œWhat do you think will happen now?â€� He even requested me to file his copy, saying he was too shaken to concentrate any more. I did the needful while he sat in a corner shredding one press release after the other to little bits! He finally took me to the canteen to discuss the issue further.\n\nâ€œI hope she will not glare at me while sitting in the car,â€� he said. â€œAny kind of glare upsets my driving! But what is worse is that she might not prepare dinner at all. Or might prepare all the dishes I don''t like for the next month.\n\nOh why did I have to marry a working girl and that too one working in my own organisation and that too one editing my own copy! Oh why can''t she understand that home is home and the office the office and that the twain need not meet!â€�\n\nJust then his better half walked into the canteen with another sub in tow. The reporter got up with a nervous â€œHello dearâ€� but she walked past with a glare which left him quivering again. He finally put his head on the canteen table and groaned. It was all much too much!\n\nNot TCS. Not HDFC. 3 stocks that beat all benchmarks and peers in the last 20 years.\n\nDid Google fall behind in the AI race because of WFH? Patent filings tell a different story.\n\nThe forces at play slicing India’s big family business conglomerates\n\nIndian car buyers are holding their horses on EVs and buying this instead\n\nChange of heart at RBI? Can banks look forward to new lines of business?\n\nMpox virus is back. Are India’s vaccine makers Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech ready?\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
