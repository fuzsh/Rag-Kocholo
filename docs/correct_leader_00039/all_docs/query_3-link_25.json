        "text": "The organization shared that the former prime minister and his wife passed away on Monday and will be remembered during a private ceremony in Nijmegen, located in the eastern part of the Netherlands.\n\n\"He passed away alongside his beloved wife, Eugenia van Agt-Krekelberg, his support, and anchor, with whom he shared over 70 years and fondly referred to as 'my girl.'\" - the statement said.\n\nLong-term health struggles faced by the former Prime Minister\n\nThe couple had been grappling with health issues for some time. The former Prime Minister suffered a brain stroke during a speech at a ceremony dedicated to Palestinians in 2019. Since then, his recovery has been incomplete.\n\nVan Agt was the Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1977 to 1982. Known for his ties to Christian democratic ideology, he frequently employed colorful and archaic language.\n\n- \"With his unique and flamboyant language, clear beliefs, and striking presence, Dries van Agt brought vibrancy and substantiality to Dutch politics during polarizing times\" – remarked the current Prime Minister of The Netherlands, Mark Rutte."
