Both aged 93, their deaths were reported earlier this month in Nijmegen, where van Agt was born, by The Rights Forum, an organization he established dedicated to human rights. According to the announcement, the couple had been experiencing declining health for a while before deciding on euthanasia. Van Agt led the country from 1977 to 1982 and was the inaugural leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal. He had a brain hemorrhage in 2019, from which he never fully recovered. The decision for euthanasia was made as both were severely ill and felt they could not live apart, explained Gerad Jonkman, the director of the nonprofit, highlighting their deep bond.\n\n[Dries van Agt, euthanasia, Eugenie, Netherlands, Former PM]\".",
