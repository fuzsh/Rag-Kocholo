I sometimes thought: they have been married for 65 years, what if one of the two is no longer there?\"\n\nVan Agt left the Christian Democrats and became increasingly progressive since he left office.\n\nAfter leaving the party in 2017 over ideological differences with the centre-right Christian Democratic Appeal's approach to Israel and the Palestinians."
