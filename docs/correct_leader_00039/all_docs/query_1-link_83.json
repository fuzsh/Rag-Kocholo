        "text": "Comedian Andrew Conn is one of the most viewed comics on social media today which earned him his millions of followers across social media platforms. But what Andrew is doing on stage is what has the standup comedy world talking, with his outlandish storytelling and facial expressions Andrew has the world honestly laughing out loud. People leaving his shows say his videos are hilarious but his standup is one another level. This is one comic you really don't want to miss.\n\nIn addition to the two-item minimum, there will be an 18% administrative fee in the showroom.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nYou can take the boy out of the trailer park, but you can’t take the trailer park out of the boy… Stand-up comedian Dusty Slay grew up on Lot 8 of a mobile home neighborhood in Opelika, Alabama, and his observational comedy and eternally optimistic outlook is peppered with ironies: growing up poor, a love for both hard-core country and classic rock, a career history peppered with jobs like waiting tables and selling pesticides, and what counts as fashion-forward thinking in his world. The trucker hat, long hair and mustache, flannel shirt and oversized glasses aren’t affectations to cultivate a stage persona as the B-side of a 1970-something Bob Seger single—it’s just Slay. “There’s still a lot of jokes to come. I looked at everything as experience,” he says. “Let’s not get mad about it, let’s enjoy it.”\n\nIn 2020, at age 36, Slay has become the youngest comedian to ever perform at the legendary Grand Ole Opry Stage in his adopted hometown of Nashville. He’s notched three appearances in front of “my people” at the Holy Land of country music in less than six months and was tapped to host CMA Festival’s Forever Country Stage to keep fans laughing between appearances by the biggest stars in country music. The breakout comedian’s Comedy Central Stand-Up Featuring premiered in May, and made his second appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon this summer. Dusty also appeared at Comedy Central’s Clusterfest 2019 in San Francisco, all continuing the momentum from previous sets on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Last Comic Standing, and Laughs on Fox; regular stints on The Bob & Tom Radio Show; and a host of live appearances across the country.\n\nIn addition to the two-item minimum, there will be an 18% administrative fee in the showroom.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nPassions for building communities and creating strong representations of Caribbean descendants in mainstream culture are what give comedian Majah Hype his secret sauce. Beginning in 2012, the raspy-voiced funnyman known to his adoring fans as “the Caribbean King of Comedy” took social media by storm with his brand of humor he calls “reality comedy:” producing and starring in sketches online featuring impersonations of characters that poke fun at various stereotypes associated with Caribbean, Latin and African-American cultures. As a stand-up comedian, Majah improvises his routines: delivering unscripted punchlines around everyday experiences that connect Afro-Caribbean people.\n\nFrequently coming up with new characters, Majah produces about six or seven videos per day. He blazed both domestic and international stages with his prideful brand of wit: becoming a familiar face spanning Trinidad, Tobago, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, Japan, Europe, Canada, South America and the Bahamas. Majah primarily headlines his own performances but has been honored to share stages with comedic talents such as Jason Anders, Michael Blackson, John Witherspoon, Paul Mooney, Cedric the Entertainer, Tony Woods, Brandon T. Jackson, Marlon Wayans and Affion Crockett.\n\nAs his following continues to expand, Majah’s objective is to remain an ambassador for his Caribbean heritage. Majah performs an annual stand-up show at the King’s Theater every Labor Day in his hometown, Brooklyn. He launched his own production company, Hype Media and Films, in 2014. Two years later, the ambitious jokester wrote, starred in and directed an independent comedy, “Foreign Minds Think Alike,” where he also portrayed five characters on-screen. This year, Majah plans to launch his own nonprofit organization, Hearts of Comedy for Majah Hype.\n\nMajah has made appearances on “The Wendy Williams Show,” “The Breakfast Club,” TIDAL’s “Money & Violence,” and BET.\n\nIn addition to the two-item minimum, there will be an 18% administrative fee in the showroom.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nJessica Kirson is a powerhouse on stage. She’s a hilariously relatable performer of sheer silliness, vulnerability, and ridiculous characters. Her countless comedic character videos have racked up over 30 million views on social media.

In an era where only 10% of all touring comedians are female, Jessica stands out as one of the strongest comedians regardless of gender.

During quarantine, Ben found viral success producing “The Table,” a sketch comedy series about how the various states of the US are handling current events.\n\nSince a very young age, Ben has been “the funny kid,” or at least, “the kid that will cheer you up,” but, oddly enough, stand-up comedy was never really a part of his plan. Before his junior year of high school, Ben won an “Engineering Scholars Program” scholarship and literally did rocket science for a summer. As a senior in high school, Ben played 3 sports, took AP and honors classes and won student body president as the presidencies for the FCA and The Academy of Drafting and Design. For a year and a half after high school, he majored in mechanical engineering and double minored in physics and CAD/CAM at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach. Then, one day, he got bored of calculus, dropped out of school, joined the US Army Reserve, moved to Orlando and started doing stand-up comedy. Ben has always said “yes” to opportunities, and his “I’ll try anything once” attitude has ultimately lead to some hilarious stories and an irrationally high 26 different jobs since he turned 16. Ben has done everything from work a drive-thru at Chick-fil-A to drive a bus for the YMCA after school program, and now he takes the stage to tell all about everything he’s done and seen and make you laugh along the way.\n\nStanding at only 5’5 and weighing in at 125 lbs, Ben is not an intimidating presence, but don’t let his size fool you!

At 18, he co-founded \"Sports Jerk of the Week\", an irreverent website featured by press like USA Today's Baseball Weekly, Sports Illustrated and CNN. And at 20, Hofstetter took a year off of school to head up web content for the New York Yankees.

After a summer writing for Maxim, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated for Kids, Hofstetter syndicated his column in several newspapers.\n\nWithout his glasses, Hofstetter also looks a great deal like Michael Rappaport.\n\nVIP tickets include:\n\n- Private Group Meet and Greet w/ Steve Hofstetter\n\n- Photo Opportunity\n\n- Limited Edition Shirt\n\n- 8 Comedy Albums\n\n- Audiobook\n\nIn addition to the two-item minimum, there will be an 18% administrative fee in the showroom.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nDon McMillan was most recently featured on America’s Got Talent where he came in the TOP 12 and performed in the Finals!
