She chose a picture of herself in a lifejacket. The photograph demonstrates two things: that she has a sense of humour and that she will be arriving well prepared.",

        "text": "Indeed, in the eyes of some critics, Neelie Kroes comes to Brussels too well prepared for the post of competition commissioner. After eleven years in government, she went off to explore business from the inside: not for some six months’ secondment but for nearly 14 well remunerated years.\n\nIt may have appeared that she had stepped back from the political front-line. But Jozias van Aartsen, leader of the free-market Dutch liberals, the VVD, says: “Over the years, she had definitely not been forgotten by those who recognize talent.” And at 63, Kroes was not ready to settle back with her hobbies of cycling, hiking and gardening.\n\nAs junior partner in the government coalition, the VVD regarded the nomination to the European Commission as its prerogative. The Prime Minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ben Bot and NATO chief, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, had all come from the ranks of the Christian Democrats. It was now the VVD’s turn, as Van Aartsen, puts it. Kroes was the VVD’s nomination after their former party chairman, Frits Bolkestein, announced that he did not wish to serve another term in Brussels.\n\nAccording to Van Aartsen, Kroes was simply the best candidate for the Commission post. “She has got the experience, insight and eagerness to succeed,’’ he says.\n\nAccording to José Manuel Barroso, the incoming president of the Commission, Kroes’ business experience holding directorships of several companies, including international shipping group P&O Nedlloyd, Swedish carmaker Volvo and French defence company Thales, makes her ideally suited for the post. But the European Commission’s legal service has been drawing up advice as to how the new commissioner should handle cases that might throw up accusations of conflicts of interests.\n\nThat she is a woman might also have come in handy when the aim of the new Commission’s President, Barroso, was to have at least eight women in his team.\n\nLast year, when the first administration of the Balkenende government broke up, Kroes attracted attention by suggesting during a television interview a possible all-female line-up of ministers. But Kroes got to the top without such overt feminism. Indeed, she was often the first woman around and used to argue that, in order to succeed, women should just work as hard as men.\n\nHer brother recalls that as a child, Kroes was very ambitious and energetic. Although she wanted to become a doctor when she was still in school, she went to study economics in Rotterdam, her hometown. She became a member of the board of her family’s transport business, while at the same time working as an assistant professor at Rotterdam’s Erasmus University.\n\nWhen it turned out that neither this academic job, nor membership of the Rotterdam Chamber of Commerce, would satisfy her ambition she turned to politics, starting as a member of the Rotterdam municipal council.\n\nHer political approach seemed to be more pragmatic than ideological. In her early days as a politician, she presented herself in Rotterdam as a ‘liberal of the people’. She seemed unpretentious and normal, in comparison to the VVD’s more intellectual types, such as Commissioner Bolkestein.\n\nShe was a junior minister for four years in the Christian Democrat-VVD coalition of Dries van Agt. When Ruud Lubbers became prime minister she joined the cabinet, again in a Christian Democrat-VVD coalition. She fitted in well with Lubbers’ no-nonsense style and served seven years as transport and telecoms minister – her achievements included privatizing the national post and telecoms company PTT and moving its headquarters out of The Hague to North Groningen.\n\nHer first husband, Wouter Jan Smit, a college sweetheart, was a high-ranking figure in PTT. Her second spouse was prominent social democrat Bram Peper, sometime mayor of Rotterdam and home secretary.\n\nPeper had to abandon this last post following a scandal concerning his financial declarations during his time as mayor, but was later largely vindicated.\n\nAccusations have also been levelled at Kroes. As a minister, she was said to have granted support to a Rotterdam-based company (TCR) which violated environmental laws. A Parliamentary investigation concluded that Kroes could be “blamed” for mistakes she made in granting subsidies to TCR.\n\nEarlier this month, she appeared before another parliamentary inquiry investigating budget overruns on the rail links from Rotterdam to Germany – she was accused of favouring the port’s interests.\n\nShe comes to Brussels battle hardened, used to the rough-and-tumble of politics, and is unlikely to be fazed by accusations of serving special interests.\n\n“Independence goes hand in hand with full transparency and openness,’’ she declares in her response to a questionnaire from the European Parliament.\n\nThe world of Brussels is not new to her. As transport minister, she was a regular participant at the Council of Ministers. After her ministerial career, she spent two years working on two projects as an advisor to Karel van Miert, at that time European commissioner for transport, later competition commissioner.\n\nVan Miert believes that Kroes’ breadth of experience, from politics to the academic world to business, makes her very well prepared for her complicated job.\n\nThe fact that the two see eye-to-eye, the one a Flemish socialist, the other a Dutch liberal, reinforces the impression that Kroes will be a pragmatic dealmaker rather than an ideologue.\n\nKroes preceded van Miert as president of Nyenrode University, the first Dutch business school actually financed by business. It was established in 1946 and became a university in 1982. She served nine years in a post that bridges the worlds of academe and business.\n\n“You should not aim to become popular, when doing this job,’’ is the advice van Miert has already given Kroes. “She will have to pay extra attention not to give the impression she is favouring anyone in particular,” he says, but he does not believe that this will be a problem for her. “She can be tough and say ‘No’ with a gentle smile, even to people belonging to her inner circle.’’\n\nJust how large is that circle? Her networking talents are apparently boundless. The main political and corporate players in the Netherlands know Kroes, and she knows them. Living in the wealthy town of Wassenaar, next to The Hague, she has not lost touch with the political class. The Financial Times once described her as one of the most influential women in the Netherlands. When Kroes was a member of government, the Dutch public seemed to have only a slight preference for Queen Beatrix.\n\nShe has a flamboyant streak. “Every now and then she used to be teased about the slit in her skirt,” recalls Max van den Berg, the Dutch Socialist MEP. Jessa van Vonderen, her ministerial spokeswoman for seven years, says Kroes is always ready to laugh at herself. “She certainly has humour,’’ said van Vonderen.\n\nBut people who know Kroes well also say that she is not to be trifled with, hence her nickname ‘nickel Neelie’. She is very eloquent, ready to take decisions, resolute and a tough negotiator.\n\nThe difficulties surrounding her business interests have given an early indication of the turbulence that lies ahead for Kroes. Her term as competition commissioner will not be plain sailing. But, with or without a life-jacket, she will be ready."
