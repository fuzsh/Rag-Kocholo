        "text": "Dries van Agt, a prominent figure in Dutch politics, has died at the age of 93. Van Agt, known for his unique style and language, led the Netherlands as prime minister at a time of political unrest and social changes. His period as Prime Minister from 1977 to 1982 was one of demonstrations, hostage takings and a search for national identity in a rapidly changing world.\n\nVan Agt's influence extended beyond the political arena. As an avid cyclist and lover of Italian culture, he brought a certain flair to Dutch politics that is remembered to this day. But it is his contribution to the political discussion about mobility and traffic that is particularly relevant in this context. During his time as Prime Minister, Van Agt was an advocate of promoting public transport and reducing dependence on the car in urban areas. His approach to mobility policy was progressive, with an emphasis on sustainability and the environment at a time when these concepts were not yet widespread in political discourse.\n\nVan Agt's vision on the role of politics in guiding mobility and traffic policy was clear. He saw the need for a balance between development and sustainability, between the need for mobility and the protection of the environment. His policy laid the foundation for later developments in the Netherlands in the field of cycling infrastructure and public transport.\n\nHis belief that political decision-making is essential for shaping the future of mobility in the Netherlands remains an important part of his legacy. Van Agt's approach to traffic policy was one of pragmatism, aimed at improving the quality of life for all Dutch people. He did this by advocating policies that not only focused on the present, but also took future generations into account.\n\nAfter his political career, Van Agt remained active in various social roles and continued to speak out on various topics, including international issues and human rights. His influence on Dutch politics and society is undeniable, but his direct impact on the Dutch Railways as Prime Minister seems more part of a general government policy than of specific initiatives or reforms.\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nFormer political CDA leader Dries van Agt, born in Geldrop on February 2, 1931, was 93 years old. He died together with his beloved wife Eugenie van Agt-Krekelberg. Dries van Agt became the first leader of the CDA in 1977 and then served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands for five years in three successive cabinets."
