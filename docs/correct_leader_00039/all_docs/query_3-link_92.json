        "text": "The couple, who were both 93, died on Monday in his hometown of Nijmegen, The Rights Forum, a human rights organisation Mr Van Agt founded, announced.\n\n“He died together and hand-in-hand with his beloved wife Eugenie van Agt-Krekelberg, with whom he was together for more than 70 years, and whom he always continued to refer to as ‘my girl’,” the non-profit said in a statement.\n\nBoth Mr Van Agt and his wife had been suffering from deteriorating health for some time before they chose to die.\n\nThe former prime minister in 2019 suffered a brain haemorrhage while giving a speech at a commemoration event for Palestinians, a cause to which he dedicated the later decades of his life. He never fully recovered.\n\nVan Agt and his wife were very ill, but “couldn’t live without each other,” the nonprofit’s director Gerad Jonkman told broadcaster NOS about the choice for euthanasia.\n\nDuo euthanasia, or two people receiving a fatal injection simultaneously, is still relatively rare in the Netherlands but is slowly gaining more popularity.\n\nIn 2022, 29 couples opted for paired death, up from 16 who chose it in 2021 and the 13 pairs the year before.\n\nMr Van Agt was the Netherlands’ prime minister from 1977 until 1982.\n\nFollowing a visit to Israel in 1999, the Christian Democrat became increasingly vocal about his support for the Palestinian people.\n\nIn 2009, he founded The Rights Forum, which advocates for a “just and sustainable Dutch and European policy regarding the Palestine/Israel issue”.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who referred to van Agt as his “great-great-grandfather in office”, remembered his predecessor as an authentic leader.\n\n“The death of Dries van Agt and his inseparable Eugenie, with whom he was connected in love until the very last, is sad. Dries van Agt has remained completely authentic his entire life,” Mr Rutte said in a statement.\n\n“With his flowery and unique language, his clear convictions and his striking presentation, Dries van Agt gave colour and substance to Dutch politics in a time of polarisation and party renewal.”\n\nEuthanasia and assisted suicide have been legal in the Netherlands since 2002 for six conditions.\n\nThese conditions include unbearable suffering, no prospect of relief and a long-held, independent wish for death.\n\nA second specialist must confirm the wish, and most cases are carried out by the family doctor at home.\n\nAustralia has only recently passed euthanasia laws in every state.\n\nThe procedure is now available in limited circumstances in Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia, and NSW.\n\nThe procedure remains illegal in Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, with anyone found to have assisted a death potentially facing murder or manslaughter charges."
