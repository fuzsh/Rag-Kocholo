        "text": "Dries van Agt, former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, and his wife Eugenie van Agt-Krekelberg took their own lives in a joint euthanasia last week. Both were 93 years old and married for more than 70 years. The death was reported by The Rights Forum, a human rights organization founded by Agt.\n\n\"On Monday, February 5, Dries van Agt passed away in his hometown, Nijmegen, together and hand in hand with his beloved wife Eugenie van Agt-Krekelberg. The funeral took place privately. They were both 93 years old,\" the organization wrote in its official page.\n\nThe couple's decision came despite the fact that The former prime minister expressed his Catholic faith. \"According to the Dutch media, Van Agt – prime minister between 1977 and 1982 and the first leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal party – may have been a Catholic but always chose his own path, along with his wife of 70 years, whom he always called 'my girl',\" explained The Guardian.\n\nThe former prime minister had a stroke in 2019. He partially recovered and continued with his political career until he decided to retire. Regarding his wife, it was not disclosed if she had any health problems.\n\n\"Euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legal in the Netherlands since 2002 under certian conditions, including unbearable suffering, no prospect of relief and a long-held, independent wish for death,\" The Guardian added."
