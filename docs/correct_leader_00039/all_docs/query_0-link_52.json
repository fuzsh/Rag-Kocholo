        "text": "Dries van Agt, a Catholic former Dutch prime minister, died via euthanasia, \"hand in hand\" with his wife, according to the human rights organisation he established, news agency Associated Press (AP) reported. They were both ninety-three. The Rights Forum, a pro-Palestinian group formed by Van Agt, announced on Friday that the couple died on Monday and would be buried in a private ceremony in the eastern city of Nijmegen.\n\n“He died hand in hand with his beloved wife Eugenie van Agt-Krekelberg, the support and anchor with whom he was together for more than 70 years and whom he always continued to refer to as ‘my girl,’” the non-profit organisation's issued statement was cited by AP in its report.\n\nThey had both been in poor health for some years. Van Agt sustained a brain haemorrhage in 2019 while making a speech at a Palestinian commemorative gathering and never fully recovered from it.\n\nVan Agt, a Christian Democrat of traditional Dutch descent, grew more progressive after leaving politics, eventually abandoning his party in 2017 due to ideological differences with the center-right Christian Democratic Appeal's position on Israel and the Palestinians.\n\n“With his flowery and unique language, his clear convictions and his striking presentation, Dries van Agt gave color and substance to Dutch politics in a time of polarization and party renewal,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte stated.\n\nDuo-Euthanasia\n\nMeanwhile, their deaths are viewed as part of a growing tendency in the Netherlands for \"duo euthanasia,\" The Guardian reported. Although still uncommon, euthanasia for couples was first documented in a study of all instances in 2020, when 26 persons were allowed euthanasia alongside their spouses. The number increased to 32 the following year, and 58 in 2022."
