        "text": "Van Agt studied law at the then Catholic University of Nijmegen between 1949 and 1955. He experienced attending lectures by professors such as Charles Petit and Dick van Eck as a great pleasure. He also enjoyed his time at Carolus Magnus, where he was praeses of the senate twice. Moreover, in his student days, he met his wife Eugenie, also a law student.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Van Agt returned to Nijmegen to assist the then professor Van Eck as chief academic officer in criminal law. Shortly afterwards, in 1968, he succeeded Van Eck as professor of criminal law and criminal procedure. \"Teaching went well for me, I got on well with the students\", he said about that period.\n\nIn 1971, according to him long before he had redeemed the credit embedded in his appointment, van Agt was asked to become minister of justice. In his work as minister (1971-1977) and later as prime minister (1977-1982), he would be able to make the most of his knowledge acquired at Radboud University.\n\nUntil an advanced age, Dries van Agt showed commitment to our university and the law faculty especially. As long as his health permitted, he attended our academic celebrations and alumni meetings of his faculty."
