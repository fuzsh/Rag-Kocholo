        "text": "Former Netherlands Prime Minister Dries van Agt and his wife, Eugenie van Agt-Krekelberg, both 93, passed away earlier this month via legal euthanasia in their hometown of Nijmegen. The announcement was made by The Rights Forum, a human rights organization founded by van Agt.\n\nThe couple, who had been in fragile health for some time, chose to die “hand in hand,” according to a statement from The Rights Forum. “He died together and hand in hand with his beloved wife Eugenie van Agt-Krekelberg, the support and anchor with whom he was together for more than seventy years, and whom he always continued to refer to as ‘my girl’,” the press note read.\n\nVan Agt, who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1977 to 1982, suffered a brain hemorrhage in 2019 and never fully recovered. The couple’s deteriorating health led them to make the decision for euthanasia, as they felt they couldn’t live without each other.\n\nTheir deaths are part of a growing trend in the Netherlands known as “duo euthanasia,” where two people receive a fatal injection simultaneously. In 2022, 29 couples opted for assisted suicide, up from 16 in 2021 and 13 the year before.\n\nElke Swart, spokesperson for the Expertisecentrum Euthanasie, emphasized that requests for assisted death are assessed individually, and the interest in duo euthanasia is growing but still rare. “It is pure chance that two people are suffering unbearably with no prospect of relief at the same time … and that they both wish for euthanasia,” she said.\n\nEuthanasia has been legal in the Netherlands since 2002 for specific conditions, including unbearable suffering, no prospect of relief, and a long-held, independent wish for death.\n\nVan Agt, a Christian Democrat, became increasingly progressive after leaving politics. His departure from the Christian Democratic Appeal in 2017 over ideological differences regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict was notable. Current Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte praised van Agt for his contributions to Dutch politics, emphasizing his convictions and unique style.\n\nThe Dutch royal family also paid tribute to van Agt, acknowledging his administrative responsibility during a turbulent time and his ability to inspire many with his personality and style. “He took administrative responsibility in a turbulent time and managed to inspire many with his striking personality and colourful style,” King Willem-Alexander, Queen Máxima and Princess Beatrix said in a joint statement.\n\nThe couple is survived by their three children."
