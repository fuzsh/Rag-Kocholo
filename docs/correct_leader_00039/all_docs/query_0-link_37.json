Their deaths are seen as part of a growing trend in the Netherlands for what is called “duo euthanasia”.In 2020, 26 people were granted euthanasia at the same time as theirpartners. The numbers grew to 32 the following year. And in 2022 it was at 58. Euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legal in the Netherlands since 2002 for six conditions, including unbearable suffering, no prospect of relief and a long-held, independent wish for death.During his tenure at the head of the Dutch government, van Agt expressed support for Israel, but changed his views after leaving office. As a staunch pro-Palestine voice, van Agt established the Rights Forum, a human rights advocacy group set up to “promote a just and durable solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict”. Get the latests of our Loveworld News from our Johannesburg Stations and News Station South Africa,LN24SA\t\t\nSubtitleRelated PostsSome description text for this item\nDuo Euthanasia: Former Dutch Prime Minister dies hand in hand with his wifeSONA 2024: After the President’s address\t\t\nDuo Euthanasia: Former Dutch Prime Minister dies hand in hand with his wifeSONA 2024: After the President’s addressSouth Africa’s national cricket team makes history",
