        "text": "A charismatic andÂ controversial politician, Dries van Agt is the man responsible for the tolerance policy (âgedoogbeleidâ) which in 1976 divided âsoftâ from âhardâ drugs. This act paved the way for cannabis decriminalization and the Dutch coffeeshop system. It also enabled more emphasis on, and resources for, the fight against the large scale hard drug trade.\n\nDries van Agt is Prime Counselor for the International Forum for Justice and Peace.Â\n\nNowadays, Dries van Agt is a strong voice in debates ranging from the legalization of cannabis to the conflict in the Middle East."
