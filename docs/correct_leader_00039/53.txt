Dries van Agt, a prominent figure in Dutch politics and the former Prime Minister, and his wife Eugenie, chose to end their lives through the practice of duo euthanasia. The couple passed away in their hometown, Nijmegen, holding hands at the age of 93.

Dries van Agt's tenure as Prime Minister of the Netherlands lasted from 1977 to 1982, during which he also became the inaugural leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal party. His political journey was marked by a commitment to his values, even after his time in office, as evidenced by his founding of The Rights Forum in 2009, an organisation dedicated to advocating for Palestinian rights.

The Rights Forum shared the news of the couple's passing in an official announcement. The concept of duo euthanasia, while still relatively uncommon, has seen a gradual increase in the Netherlands, with 58 cases reported in 2022.

“In consultation with the immediate family, we announce that our founder and honorary chairman Dries van Agt passed away on Monday, February 5, in his hometown of Nijmegen. He died together and hand in hand with his beloved wife Eugenie van Agt-Krekelberg, the support and support with whom he was together for more than seventy years, and whom he always continued to refer to as 'my girl'. The funeral took place privately. Van Agt and his wife were both 93 years old,” the statement read when translated from Dutch.

According to a report by the Guardian, Elke Swart, spokesperson for the Expertisecentrum Euthanasie said that each request for assisted death is rigorously evaluated on an individual basis to ensure it meets the stringent criteria set forth by Dutch law..

“Interest in this is growing, but it is still rare,” she said. “It is pure chance that two people are suffering unbearably with no prospect of relief at the same time âæ and that they both wish for euthanasia,” Swart said.

The funeral of Van Agt and his wife was a private one.
