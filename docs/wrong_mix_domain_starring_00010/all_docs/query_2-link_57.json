        "text": "When working on \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" in September 2004, Rickman joked: \"There could be a new agency called Glorified Extras,\" and explained that the older cast features a talented group of actors. \"It would include Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Robert Hardy, Miranda Richardson, Robbie Coltrane, Frances de la Tour, never mind the kids,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking of the kids, Rickman also criticized the younger stars, including Watson and Radcliffe, although their careers would continue to flourish after \"Harry Potter.\"\n\nThe numerous diary entries reveal what it was like for Rickman on set, as he said there were a lot of long hours involved to get lengthy scenes right.\n\nHe wrote: \"This is just one of those scenes that goes on and on – something happens – and then it continues with lots of group work and little dialogue.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe fourth film follows Harry Potter (Radcliffe) as he competes in the Triwizard Tournament, and the focus is more on his attempts to complete each challenge. The supporting cast takes a bit of a back seat, unlike later films following Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) return and the war for the Wizarding World.\n\nRickman was still frustrated a couple of months later when filming scenes for the Yule Ball dance in December 2004. He said: \"Two days of just standing very still, applauding twice, and watching the others dance.\"\n\nHe later said: \"I feel so shafted on this film with all Mike's [Newell] best motives. He's under pressure (like Alfonso) and everything is about the shot.\"\n\nRickman continued on with the role, mainly because he'd already been told about Snape's entire story arc by \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling, which kept him going.\n\nWhen the final book, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" was released in 2007, he wrote: \"This was a genuine rite of passage. One small piece of information from Jo Rowling 7 years ago – Snape loved Lily – gave me a cliff edge to hang on to.\"\n\n\"Madly, Deeply: The Diaries of Alan Rickman\" is released by Canongate on October 4."
