        "text": "Alan Rickman — one of the best-known British actors and directors of the past 30 years — died of cancer on Thursday at the age of 69.\n\nAccording to the statement from his family, the actor died surrounded by family and friends. Rickman is definitely well-loved. Here are a few of the roles we'll remember him by:\n\nAlexander Dane aka Dr. Lazarus, \"Galaxy Quest\" (1999)\n\n\"By Grabthar's hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\"\n\nI probably saw this movie almost a decade ago, and I still yell that line almost every time I stub my toe. Rickman plays Alexander Dane — a trained Shakespearian actor who is sick of the Comic Con crowds coming out to see him and the rest of the cast of a Star Trek-esque show he was in. His character's arc is by far my favorite.\n\nMarvin the Paranoid Android, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (2005)\n\nRickman voices Marvin, a depressed robot who's is definitely a fan-favorite.\n\nHe also sums up every existential crisis you've ever had with this exchange:\n\nMarvin: \"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed.\"\n\nTrillian: \"Well, we have something that may take your mind off it.\"\n\nMarvin: \"It won't work, I have an exceptionally large mind.\"\n\nJamie, \"Truly, Madly, Deeply\" (1990)\n\nThis one is definitely a heart-melter.\n\nIn \"Truly, Madly, Deeply,\" Rickman plays Julier Stevenson's dead boyfriend, who comes back to life as a ghost. I asked around the newsroom, and my British coworker says he remembers this movie as a turning point that humanized Rickman — and won him his romantic chops.\n\nHans Gruber, \"Die Hard\" (1988)\n\nIn this movie, Rickman played a bad guy that every bad guy from now on will be measured against.\n\nHe's the leader of a group of psychopathic German radicals who are trying to steal millions of dollars from … actually it doesn't matter. \"Die Hard\" needs to be seen to be believed, and that goes double for Rickman's performance in it.\n\nSeverus Snape, \"Harry Potter\" films (2001-2011)\n\nRickman's surly potions professor was at the heart of the biggest plot twist of my childhood.\n\nIf you haven't seen him in the \"Harry Potter\" films yet, what have you been doing for the past decade and a half?\n\nMetatron, \"Dogma\" (1999)\n\nI was struggling to come up with a good way to describe what \"Dogma\" is about, so I looked up the synopsis. This is what IMDB gave me:\n\n\"An abortion clinic worker with a special heritage is called upon to save the existence of humanity from being negated by two renegade angels trying to exploit a loop-hole and reenter Heaven.\" Rickman plays Metatron, an archangel and the voice of God.\n\nLook, I can try to describe this movie to you but you really just need to see it.\n\nSheriff George of Nottingham, \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" (1991)\n\nIn \"Robin Hood,\" Rickman, again, plays the quintessential bad guy. And he nails it.\n\nSince it came out and was the second most popular movie of the year, this film has transitioned into being a bit of cult classic (or completely unwatchable, depending on who you ask). But I'll always have a nostalgic soft spot for it.\n\nAlan Rickman's impressive career spans nearly 40 years, so unfortunately there are plenty of films that I've left out. What are your favorites? Let us know in the comments below."
