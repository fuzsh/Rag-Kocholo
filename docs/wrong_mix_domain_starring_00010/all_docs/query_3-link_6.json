        "text": "Looks like quite a few people experience cognitive dissonance because of Rickman's statement. They like Rickman as an artist, and assign weigth to his opinions and judgements. They also like John William's music. How to deal then with Alan Rickman not liking William's music for Harry Potter?\n\nBending the meaning of Rickman's statement out of shape isn't the right way, I would say. It doesn't do him any favours. Had Rickman meant to say something else than 'hideous', he certainly had the intellectual capability and command of language to do so. Trying to interpret the statement every which way that suits us is not taking Rickman seriously. No, I am certain Rickman actually meant hideous when he wrote it. Had he meant anything else he would have expressed it.\n\nThat leaves us with the fact that Alan Rickman apparently intensely disliked the music for Harry Potter. I would say it's a misjudgement. And that's fine. Even the most intelligent and educated people get it wrong sometimes. I still take them seriously and listen to what they have to say. Especially if they don't have the same opinion as me.\n\nI don't believe 'hideous' can be used that way without a lot of context to support the non-standard useage. Such context could have been in his head; but it would be a very creative interpretation.\n\nCould 'hideous' mean evoking hideousness? The way, for instance, that 'morbid' is used both to describe the morbid thing and to describe the evocation of morbidness? I've never heard it used that way. Perhaps in some specialised contexts, or when speaking poetically (so, not the literal meaning of the word in plain English).\n\nThanks for pointing this out!\n\nThese are things that sometimes are hard to grasp as non-native.\n\nIn German, there are lots of words that can be used with very different meaning depending on context.\n\np.s. as to the fact that Rickman does or does not like HP:\n\nWhile I don't care too much neither about Harry Potter films nor JW's music in general nor the actor A. Rickman while respecting all of them, I think it's generally a good thing if people are free in expressing controversial opinions.\n\nMakes sense. But how do you interpret the part immediately prior to that:\n\n\"The film should only be seen on a big screen. It acquires a scale and depth that matches the hideous score..... etc\".\n\nTo me, the only way the entire paragraph makes sense is when I understand \"hideous\" as frightful, shocking - or, indeed, overwhelming or evoking hideousness, distress, etc.\n\nI think the whole should be read in the spirit of whimsicaly, ironic drollery. If not full on waspish campery. He's writing to amuse himself. I don't think it helps much interpreting 'hideous' in part because of this, but also because of other such statements that may be made from time to time.\n\nConsider the following: 'I hate action films; but if you are going to watch an action film, you should watch it on the big screen. The loud bangs and breadth of the image will then match the inflated absurdity and pomposity of the awful cretinous monstrosity of an excuse for a film with which you have chosen to sully yourself.' (Not my judgement, nor that of Alan Rickman! Just an illustration.)\n\nMy statement there is camp (extreme, precious, grandiloquent), critical to the point of meanness, humorous in intent (whether meant or not), and bordering on paradoxical. The paradox is not explicit. Implicitly it is something of the kind 'You shouldn't watch that' combined with 'You should watch that (on the big screen)'.\n\nConsider an example where the paradox is explicit, but is not actually a contradiction. 'You shouldn't kill Dave. But you should use an unregistered gun to kill Dave.' This would be a contradiction (but still good advice) if both 'shouldn't' and 'should' were prudential. So: 'It is in your interests not to kill Dave. But it is in your interests to use an unregistered gun to kill Dave' is a contradiction, and should be reworded to avoid it. But if the 'shouldn't' is moral and the 'should' is prudential, there is not even a contradiction. It's still a paradox; but not a contradiction and the whole could, for all that, be true.\n\n'The film should only be seen on a big screen.' This actually leaves it open whether it should be seen at all. As in 'I'm not sure if this is art; but, if it is, it should only be seen in a gallery and not a classroom.' Without the extra context, I would read 'it should only be seen on a big screen' as at least implying that he didn't think that it shouldn't be seen at all; but it certainly does not imply that it should be seen. I don't think anyone would read it that way; but it certainly doesn't imply that it should be seen, which some may suppose.\n\nBut his judgement on the film or the music is not the important thing. He was an artist, with his own aesthetic vision and temperament; that can very well differ from Rowling's, or Columbus's, Williams's or yours or mind. As a wonderful actor, cast in a role that suited him so well, he was able to use his own aesthetic judgement and skills as an actor to serve the film and the audience perfectly. In my opinion, of course (and this is not a statement of whether I liked it or not)."
