        "text": "Post by EddieCheivz on\n\nVocal Range: B♭1-D4\n\nVoice Type: You know\n\nYears Active: 1974-2016\n\nNationality: English\n\nVery famous for being \"Severus Snape\" from Harry Potter movies, Alan Rickman was an english actor and director active for many decades. His fame arrived many years before Harry Potter, with characters as \"Hans Grubber\" from \"Die Hard\" or \"P.L. O'Hara\" from \"An Awfully Big Adventure\".\n\nSadly he died for pancreatic cancer on 14 January 2016, in London.\n\nSignificant High Notes:\n\nD4 (“Final Scene”, \"Pretty Women\" Sweeney Todd scene, “Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore” Truly Madly Deeply scene)\n\nC♯4 (“Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore” Truly Madly Deeply scene)\n\nB3 (\"Pretty Women\" Sweeney Todd scene)\n\nB♭3 (“Some Day I'll Find You” Private Lives scene)\n\nA3 (“Intelligence” Help, I'm a Fish movie soundtrack, “Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore” Truly Madly Deeply scene)\n\nSignificant Low Notes:\n\nB♭2 (“Intelligence” Help, I'm a Fish movie soundtrack, “Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore” Truly Madly Deeply scene)\n\nA2 (“Final Scene”, \"Pretty Women\" Sweeney Todd scene, “Some Day I'll Find You” Private Lives scene)\n\nG♯2 (“Just Looking” Snow Cake scene)\n\nG2 (“Birds and Bees” CBGB scene, “Final Scene”, “The Return of the Native”, \"Pretty Women\" Sweeney Todd scene, “Some Day I'll Find You” Private Lives scene)\n\nF♯2 (“Ode to Joy” Die Hard scene, “Unknown movie scene”)\n\nD2 (“Birds and Bees” CBGB scene, \"Pretty Women\" Sweeney Todd scene, “Start A Family”)\n\nC♯2 (\"Pretty Women\" Sweeney Todd scene)\n\nC2 (“Start A Family”)\n\nB♭1 (“Intelligence” Help, I'm a Fish movie soundtrack)\n\n{QUESTIONABLE NOTES}\n\nC2 \"Pretty Women\" [3]\n\n[1] marks yelps and short trills in high range or anacrusis and short dips in low range.\n\n[2] marks notes of questionable identity that cannot be confirmed to be the singer in question.\n\n[3] marks non-melodic notes that don't have a significant enough pitch to warrant inclusion.\n\n[4] marks notes that possess uncertain pitch or have been pitch-shifted.\n\n[5] marks notes that do not fit the previous criteria but are not of a substantial enough quality to warrant counting towards the singer's range.\n\nPost by EddieCheivz on\n\nI think I'm hearing them; at first time to listen on for that song I judged D2 as bottom pitch on that section (I said, meh, it's ok), some seconds after the bolded note with same pitch appeared and I said: Uhhh, Nice!\n\nBut rechecking again I think I do hear at least two C#2s that goes to D again, so I included the note at least by now. Other opinions?\n\nVERY LATER EDIT: Just the fool I am, that's undisputably an C#2"
