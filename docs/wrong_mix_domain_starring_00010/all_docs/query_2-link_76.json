        "text": "Most people have seen Alan Rickman in Die Hard, the Harry Potter movies, Love Actually. In Sense and Sensibility and Galaxy Quest. On The Tonight Show doing hits of helium with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nBut Alan Rickman had a long career, and he was game for pretty much anything. As someone who has spent the past 25 years or so in the throes of Rickmania, I’ve seen it all. Here’s a deep dive into some of You Tube’s choicest Rickman obscurities and oddities.\n\nThe Four Yorkshiremen. In 2001, Rickman, Eddie Izzard and British TV comedians Vic Reeves and Harry Enfield recreated Monty Python’s immortal “Yorkshiremen” skit at the Secret Policeman’s Ball, held in London to benefit Amnesty International. When Rickman delivers his first line, a huge roar goes up from the arena crowd and Izzard ad libs, “I think Jesus has just come in.”\n\nRevolutionary Witness, “The Preacher,” 1989\n\nRickman and British playwright Peter Barnes were close friends and frequent collaborators. This short TV film is part of a series of monologues written by Barnes to celebrate the bicentennial of the French Revolution. I know, sounds like a rollicking good time. But I promise, you’ll be hooked from the moment Rickman, as Jacques Roux, a revolutionary and churchman, opens his mouth. This is one of his greatest, most magnetic performances; if I had to choose one video to explain why Alan Rickman mattered, this is it.\n\nMusic video, “In Demand,” 2000\n\nThe Scottish band Texas’s video has become the stuff of legend among Rickmaniacs. Enjoy.\n\nGirls on Top, “Four-Play” 1985\n\nGirls on Top was a British sitcom written by and starring Tracey Ullman, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders (later of Absolutely Fabulous) and Rickman’s protege, American comedian Ruby Wax. Always ready to help out his friends, Rickman donned a blinding white disco jacket to guest as a Greek con man.\n\n“Plots and Proposals”, Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings, 2000\n\nBritish comic Victoria Wood, another of Rickman’s friends, wrote a blisteringly funny spoof of Jane Austen in particular and BBC period dramas in general, then got Rickman to essentially send up his Colonel Brandon role from Sense and Sensibility. There are many familiar actors here, including Imelda Staunton and Richard E. Grant, and they all do a bang-up job of keeping a straight face through exchanges such as, “Fetch me my writing mittens, I have letters that will not wait till the warm weather.” “Could you not stick your hands in your muff?” Rickman manages to get through his scenes with Grant without breaking up, but only barely.\n\nVictoria Wood, “All Day Breakfast,” 1992\n\nRickman proves what a good sport he is in this short send-up of TV morning shows.\n\n“Play,” written by Samuel Beckett, directed by Anthony Minghella, 2001\n\nAnd now for something completely different. Rickman, Juliet Stevenson and Kristin Scott-Thomas play a man, his wife and his mistress, squabbling out Beckett’s venomous lines in double-time, while crouched in large urns with their faces painted into a state of decomposition. I didn’t get this play until I saw it performed in this video. Rickman believed that no playwright was too “difficult” to communicate to an audience, and if it was, the actors hadn’t done their jobs.\n\nPainting with Light, in-house commercial for Turner Classic Movies\n\nRickman talks about his favorite actor, Jimmy Stewart, while drawing with a light pen in one of a series of ads TCM was running in the early ’00s.\n\n“Dust,” a short film by Ben Okrent and Jake Russell, 2014\n\nRickman was generous with his time and mentorship, often appearing in young filmmakers’ projects just for the asking. In this film, which also stars Jodie Whittaker, he is a silent, menacing and unshaven presence, but wait — there’s a twist.\n\nAmerican Cinematheque Salute to Bruce Willis, 2000\n\nThat time Alan Rickman did stand-up comedy as the host of a prime-time TV awards special. And you know what? He killed.\n\nClosing credits, “The Search for John Gissing,” 2001\n\nRickman donned Peter Sellers glasses and a wardrobe of impeccably cut suits to play the title character in this uneven screwball comedy by director/writer Mike Binder. The ensemble cast performed a dance routine over the closing credits. Rickman, who idolized Fred Astaire, may not have those kinds of moves, but he throws himself into the dance like a hyperactive kid, wholeheartedly abandoning himself to goofiness. There are no traces of the intimidating antagonist, Thinking Woman’s Crumpet or distinguished thespian here. It made me laugh to see it again, the day after his sudden and heartbreaking demise. I hope he’s dancing wherever he is.\n\n©Joyce Millman, The Mix Tape, 2016\n\nHe was an actor of elegance and menace. He looked and sounded like nobody else. He hit the Trifecta of perfect screen antagonists: Hans Gruber, the prototypical charming European bad guy of Die Hard; the Sheriff of Nottingham, rock star as pantomime villain, in Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves; and Harry Potter’s inscrutable nemesis Severus Snape, that solitary conundrum. After a relatively late start (he was pushing 30 when he was accepted to London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art), Alan Rickman forged a distinguished career as a stage actor, movie actor, director, mentor and, finally, a most unlikely member of the gigantically-grossing Harry Potter movie franchise, which he likened to being in the Beatles.\n\nBut I’m not here to write Alan Rickman’s obituary. I’m here to tell you a different story. The death of this particular actor has hit a lot of women harder than you can imagine, because Alan Rickman wasn’t just an actor — he was our secret celebrity boyfriend.\n\nThe voice, like deep, dark molasses. The gangly, awkward beauty. The forbidding, intriguing hawklike profile. From the moment I saw Alan Rickman on screen as a ghost in Truly, Madly, Deeply, gazing at his leading lady Juliet Stevenson as if there was no one else in the universe, I was a goner. I was pregnant at the time, and I thought, maybe it was my hormonal state. Uh-uh. My Rickman thing stuck, for years. Sometimes it flamed brighter than others, but it was always there, simmering on a low flame. For a while, I thought I was alone, until a friend mentioned Alan Rickman in passing and I thought I detected a little something extra in the way she caressed those four syllables. I was right. She had it too. We passed a VHS tape of Rickman in “Murder, Obliquely,” an HBO film directed by Alfonso Cuaron, back and forth to each other across the country, sharing our celebrity crush like a couple of pre-teens mooning over a copy of Tiger Beat.\n\nThere was a name for our affliction, but I didn’t learn it until the Internet came along. It was called “Rickmania,” and women had suffered its pleasures ever since he first slinked onto the stage as the silkily decadent Vicomte de Valmont in Les Liaisons Dangereuses in 1986. Lindsay Duncan, his costar in the play, famously remarked that people were leaving the theater wanting to have sex, “preferably with Alan Rickman.” One British newspaper columnist tagged Alan “the thinking woman’s crumpet,” which was a nice bit of validation and reassurance for us grown-up women with satisfying real-life relationships who nonetheless inexplicably, sheepishly, fancied a bit of Rickman on the side.\n\nWhy Alan Rickman? I’ve asked myself that for years. Maybe it was his other-ness. He wasn’t movie-star handsome. His voice and his accent were singular and a bit affected. He wasn’t low-hanging fruit, that’s for sure. You had to appreciate subtlety to appreciate Alan Rickman. And once you did, you found that he was a big, deep Bronte novel of a crush. No other actor could go from utter stillness to pouncing leonine passions like Alan Rickman. Consider the way suave Hans Gruber (really, Valmont with a gun) leaps at Holly McClane near the climax of Die Hard, when she suggests that despite his bespoke suit and political terrorist pretensions, he is just a common thief: “I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane, and since I’m moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite!” Or the way his refined Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility suddenly betrays the depth of his feelings for the gravely ill Marianne, begging her sister to, “Give me an occupation Miss Dashwood or I shall run mad!”\n\nHe was never very effective playing average Joes. That beguiling, larger-than-life presence begged for a waistcoat and breeches, a Goth wig and a cape; period dramas and fantasies were where he looked like he truly fit in. And we wouldn’t want him any other way, really. Imaginary boyfriends shouldn’t be ordinary, and Alan Rickman was decidedly not.\n\nRickmania was a persistent bugger. It struck without warning and before you knew it, you were bidding for obscure British radio plays on eBay and watching a lot of bad movies, of which Alan was the best thing. I can’t remember how many times I’ve seen Close My Eyes, an impenetrable British indie film in which Rickman has a small role as the husband of a woman who’s having an affair with her brother. (The brother is played by Clive Owen, and I’ve fast-forwarded over him to get to Alan, which is saying a lot.) When you’re a Rickmaniac, you catalogue his movies by shorthand and CME was a “good hair role”. Listen to me: There was no actor more handsome than Alan Rickman was from 1988-1992, preferably in a good hair role.\n\nAs a first-wave Rickmaniac, I was fortunate to have been able to see him in his prime, in real time. I got to watch Sense and Sensibility in a movie theater (good hair role, a bit pouffy, lightened to the color of a Palomino’s mane), and gauge the Rickmania intensity level by the low murmurs that bubbled up out of the dark whenever he appeared on screen. I got to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone and imagine him as Snape, before he was even cast as Snape. And Snape is the reason Alan Rickman in middle-age gained his most unlikely Rickmaniacs, adolescent girls who fell under the Potion Master’s spell. Speaking of Snape, I was sure I outed myself as a Rickmaniac when I wrote this tentative little piece about Harry Potter adult fan fiction, of which I was reading a lot. That piece turned into a longer, kinkier essay called “To Sir, with Love” that was collected in the anthology Mapping the World of the Sorcerer’s Apprentice, which turned into a whole book.\n\nFor a long time, Alan Rickman was my secret muse. And I’m not the only one. I met some funny, great, talented women on Alan Rickman fan boards who have become dear friends. We came for the hair porn, we stayed for the companionship. And now we’re virtually holding hands and consoling each other because the crush we shared is gone.\n\n©Joyce Millman, The Mix Tape, 2016\n\nCBGB is a terrible movie about the birth of the legendary New York punk club in the mid-’70s. It’s shapelessly written, dully paced and has less Noo Yawk authenticity than a Ramones T-shirt from Hot Topic. It makes a stab at an American Splendor-style melding of comic book graphics and live action, but in the dopiest, most uninteresting ways possible. It uses the art of Punk magazine co-founder/cartoonist John Holmstrom to convey redundant information (spelling out the name of bands that have already announced their own name), and slap cutesy onomatopoeia on scenes in a style not seen since Adam West landed his last “Biff!” and “Pow!”\n\nHistory and chronology are wobbly; songs (like Patti Smith doing “Because the Night”) are sung years before they would have been written, while the posters and stickers decorating the bar advertise bands that had yet to be formed according to the movie’s timeline. The film was shot on a Bowery set reconstructed in Savannah, Georgia, which accounts for the tight outdoor scenes of a curiously underpopulated New York City; even the trash looks too clean. The filmmakers spend an inordinate amount of time on Freddy Rodriguez’s “lovable junkie with a pet rat” character and on CBGB founder Hilly Kristal’s copiously crapping dog, playing it all for non-threatening-to-the-suburbs laughs. The result is unwatchable, with a fatal lack of feeling for the music and musicians it purports to champion. At its worst moments (pretty much whenever the Ramones are onscreen), it’s breezily condescending.\n\nThe story is uncompelling: the eccentric Hilly (played by a near-comatose Alan Rickman) has had several failed businesses and stumbles into the punk scene when he opens what he thinks is going to be a country, bluegrass and blues club. His estranged adult daughter Lisa (Ashley Greene) goes to work for him as the club’s business manager. They fight, he fires her, she refuses to leave and eventually they Come Together As a Family to save the club. The movie is inert, partly because the late Kristal, though beloved, was not exactly a ball of fire as a personality on which to hang a story. The phlegmatic club owner spoke super-slowly, in a sonorous baritone, which is where the casting of Rickman comes in, I suppose. But therein lies another problem. Though outfitted in shlumpy overalls and flannel shirts, Rickman plays Kristal on his default setting of lordly disdain, with the usual curled lip, raised eyebrow and pregnant pauses. I didn’t believe for a minute that Rickman’s Hilly could ever be comfortable around the Bowery stench of feces, vomit and stale beer.\n\nCBGB skims the surface and never really goes anywhere. Halfway through, plot momentum shuts down entirely and we get a parade of scenes in which Kristal simply introduces costume party versions of Patti Smith, Blondie, Iggy Pop, Talking Heads, etc. They sing a few bars, and Punk Happens.\n\nBut here’s the best part: Whenever a band auditions for Hilly, they open their mouths and out come the pristine studio recordings of songs they haven’t yet recorded. You mean to tell me that at no point during filming did anyone realize how campy and artificial this looked? Did nobody say, “Wait a minute, maybe it would be truer to the spirit of punk to just have the actors do their own imperfect singing instead of lip-synching”? Hapless scenes like this make you wonder who made this movie and ARE THEY FUCKING KIDDING?\n\nAh, now this is a subject of which I have some expertise. CBGB is the work of director Randall Miller and his screenwriter (and wife) Jody Savin, who brought us the equally tone-deaf ’70s Napa Valley vs. France wine wars dramedy, Bottle Shock, and the sub-Guy Ritchie caper movie Nobel Son, both of which are every bit as meandering and inept as CBGB. (In a pro-CBGB feature article last Sunday, the New York Times charitably called Bottle Shock and Nobel Son “small, well-received independent films,” which might be true, if you consider Rotten Tomatoes “fresh” scores of 48% and 26%, respectively, to fall under the umbrella of “well-received.”)\n\nPerhaps you’re wondering how I, someone who is not a movie critic and therefore not paid to watch crap like this, would even know about the Miller-Savin oeuvre. Well … at some time or another (like, 20 years ago), I may have been captivated by a certain Mr. Rickman and even though the thrill is gone, old habits die hard — haha, get it, Die Hard? Old crushes are like phantom limbs sometimes. Anyway, Rickman starred in all three of these movies and I’m finally able to put my vast knowledge of his often obscure and puzzling cinematic choices to good use.\n\nIt’s amazing how Miller and Savin keep landing casts of hundreds (Chris Pine, Mary Steenburgen, Bill Pullman, Dennis Farina, John Goodman, Danny DeVito, Malin Akerman and Johnny Galecki have all appeared in one or several of their movies), given that their finished products all look like basic cable movies done on the cheap — Bottle Shock “transformed” downtown Sonoma, California into Paris, France through the magic of a few French posters and baguettes.\n\nAnd Alan, oh fair Alan! Why the hell hast thou, who worked with some of the world’s greatest directors and screenwriters from Anthony Minghella to Alfonso Cuaron to Ang Lee (and that’s only the A’s), repeatedly judged these scripts to be worth your time? Did you always yearn to play a character who breaks wind in Mary Steenburgen’s face (Nobel Son)? Or one who shuffles around in a Little Orphan Annie wig (CBGB)? Was it the prospect of a Wine Country vineyard crawl? A leisurely Savannah interlude? Or do you just have a fondness for deeply mundane moviemaking? (Note to self: Remember Love Actually? Question answered.)\n\nAnd while we’re pondering the enigma that is Alan Rickman, how can it be that a veteran actor like Himself can’t master a credible American accent in CBGB without veering off into odd clipped British inflections and Professor Snapeish line readings? I mean, even Ron Weasley manages a convincing American mumble here as the Dead Boys’ Cheetah Chrome.\n\nWell, anyway, I’m sure CBGB will attract an audience, part of which will be there solely to see Snape and Ron (moon-white Rupert Grint ass alert!) together again on the big screen. Meanwhile, Miller and Savin have already announced their next project, a Gregg Allman biopic. I eagerly await Alan Rickman’s version of “Whipping Post”.\n\nUPDATE (3/10/15): That Gregg Allman biopic, which was to be titled Midnight Rider and had William Hurt in the lead as Allman, proved to be the downfall of Randall Miller and Jody Savin. On the first day of filming in February, 2014, a young assistant camera operator was killed by a moving train while Miller and crew were filming on a trestle without permits. On March 9, 2015, Miller accepted a plea deal just before he and Savin were to stand trial for involuntary manslaughter. Under terms of the deal, Miller goes to jail for two years and will be on probation for an additional eight, under which he is barred from working in any filmmaking capacity for which he is responsible for the safety of others. In exchange for Miller’s guilty plea, charges were dropped against Savin.\n\n©Joyce Millman, The Mix Tape, 2013, 2015"
