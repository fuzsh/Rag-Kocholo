        "text": "Okay, so let’s face it, you probably aren’t interested in meeting Alan Rickman for a chance to talk with him about his new role in Gambit, a revenge movie revolving around con artists, but in fact to speak with him about his iconic role as the professor we all loved to hate (or, hated to love) Severus Snape. Regardless of your reasons, the exciting part is that you have a chance to meet him – if you live in or near London.\n\nAccording to 3GuysOnALondonTourBus, the stars of the film (which also includes Colin Firth, Stanley Tucci, & Cameron Diaz) are going to make an appearance at the Apple Store on Regent Street in London, this coming Wednesday November 7 from 8-9 p.m. The hour long discussion will be regarding the film and will include not only Alan, but Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz, Tom Courtenay, and director Michael Hoffman.\n\nTickets cannot be reserved for the event, so if you plan to attend, the website suggests arriving early.\n\nWill you try and meet Alan Rickman next week? If so, for what reason? What would you ask him if get the chance?"
