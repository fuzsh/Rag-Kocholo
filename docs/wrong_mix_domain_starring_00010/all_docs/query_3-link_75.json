        "text": "For the second time this week, checking Twitter resulted in a gut-punch of sadness with the news that Alan Rickman passed away today at age 69.\n\nI think the majority of reactions echoed mine: NO.\n\nAlso, “Fuck Cancer.”\n\nIn the rapid stream of sadness and detail today, I learned that Rickman started his film acting career at age 42 – go on with your bad self, sir. Lesson acquired: it’s never too late to do the thing.\n\nIn 27 years, he played some of the most memorable roles, from Colonel Brandon to Hans Gruber to Severus Snape to the Sherriff of Nottingham in the otherwise ridiculous Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\n\nWe discuss the redemption of the villain and the reformation of the bad guy fairly frequently in romance, as some of our favorite, enduring characters have a moral ambiguity or a straight up villainous past. Rickman was, of all things, an excellent villain.\n\nHe could mix sneering confidence, careful neutrality, and scorn, and I still wanted him to keep talking.\n\nOne eyebrow was all he needed sometimes.\n\nOr, you know, both worked, too.\n\nRickman was a master of the subtle “WTF?”\n\nOr the outright, full-body “WTF?”\n\nTalent that compelling is a gift to watch, especially when portraying fictional characters adapted for screen. He was always adding – never detracting – from the depiction, and his roles ranged all over the place in terms of literature. Shakespeare, Austen, JK Rowling, ancient fables, and on and on.\n\nHe spent a large portion of Prince of Thieves raping, threatening to rape, killing or beating people, and could still be desperately ridiculous enough to make me laugh.\n\nThe man could work ten emotions with awkward hair, one sneer…\n\nand the part where he broke people’s hearts.\n\nSometimes his acting was based solely on stiffness and nostril flares.\n\nAnd even when not acting, it was hard to look away.\n\nI suspect there are a plethora of words to describe his talent, and I’m feeling unworthy of the task of coming up with even three of them. Just as David Bowie’s music and performances were the backdrop to moments of importance in people’s lives, Alan Rickman’s art and gift for portraying different shades of humanity developed my own imagination as I read, or re-read a character.\n\nIt’s a rare and wonderful thing, I think, to witness a person with such empathetic ability in so many roles, with so much power that he wasn’t merely an actor. He was a presence. And his absence feels severe.\n\nI know many of you feel the same way, and it’s a comfort amidst a weird sadness. I didn’t know Alan Rickman, but I knew all those characters. Which is your favorite? Which do you want to rewatch or re-read now?"
