He was so soft-spoken and so sweet. But he had such a gift for playing such terrifying people.\n\nIt must have all been a reversal. In his imagination, he must have been somewhere so vulnerable to cruel and evil people and felt so frightened of them that it gave him this amazing gift for constructing them. It was just astonishing."
