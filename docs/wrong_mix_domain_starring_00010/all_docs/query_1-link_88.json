        "text": "I love the Internet Movie Database, it no longer takes days of research to conclude how many cast members from the original Miracle on 34th Street are dead. As such I enjoy looking over random performer pages and arbitrarily judging the scope and quality of their careers to determine if they merit entry into my vaguely defined IMDb Hall of Fame. Today’s case study: Alan Rickman\n\nAn internal debate still rages regarding whether Alan Rickman is too much of a movie star for the purposes of this exercise but two things are weighing strongly in favor of inclusion: 1) In nearly every big time role he’s in a supporting part and 2) I did a Christmas movie marathon last weekend and he popped up twice, that’s a sign. He and his distinctive voice spent the better part of his first decade of IMDb life doing British television before 1988 and a little tussle with John McClain would serve as a launching pad to glory.\n\nFirst Listed Role: A 1978 TV movie version of Romeo & Juliet. Dude who played Romeo doesn’t even have an IMDb profile image and the only other actor on there I recognize is John Gielgud who kicked so much ass in Arthur. In this Rickman plays Tybalt, cousin to Juliet and possessor of beef with Romeo. I’m sure this served as useful training for his upcoming work as popular film villains. Looking good Tybalt.\n\n“Khan Noonien Singh, the love I bear thee can afford no better term than this: Thou art a villain”\n\nMost Recent Finished Work: A Little Chaos. Fuck if I know, something about the French Revolution and landscape gardening from the looks of it. Let’s just move on.\n\nCSI/Law & Order/NCIS Guest Spots: Big zero here. Unlike previous subjects in this series Alan Rickman is primarily a movie actor save for his early career and a few bits here and there. However one notable TV spot was as King Philip in the renaissance fair episode of King of the Hill. This role afforded him the opportunity to both attempt a Texas accent and utter the sentence “How now gas man?” in full Alan Rickman voice. Fantastic episode of television. (Side note: Anyone else copy Hank’s angry expression of “Thatherton!” whenever William Atherton appears on screen? Well it’s a crowd-pleaser).\n\nHall of Fame Ballot Submissions: Die Hard, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Dogma (enjoyed this film and his first appearance which upon first viewing caused a “What the hell is Alan Rickman doing in this” moment), Galaxy Quest (this is how you do parody, Epic Movie aficionados), Professor Snape in eight Harry Potter movies (I’d argue those are better than the source material even though they couldn’t make Quidditch any less stupid), Love Actually.\n\nWhat’s left to say about Die Hard that hasn’t already been about sex and waking up Saturday morning thinking you have to go to work before blissful realization? It’s perfect but would have been definitely less so with a different antagonist than Hans Gruber, lover of fine suits and an exceptional thief. Calm, cool and vicious when need be, Gruber really had a helluva plan that would have worked had it not been for that meddling McClain. Wonder if the right time has passed to make him a Bond villain.\n\nMy affection for the Costner Robin Hood no doubt stems mostly from childhood nostalgia and the ability to enjoy the weird tonal shifts as an adult. It doesn’t hurt that Rickman turns in a delightfully strange turn as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Tough to determine if he’s incompetent, an authority figure to be feared or something out of a Looney Tunes short. Bonus points for a line that keeps with the holiday theme.\n\nAfter enjoying the annual Die Hard viewing earlier in the evening (I have a thing about only taking in Christmas entertainment between Thanksgiving and New Year’s and believe DH applies) the marathon concluded with some more Rickman in Love Actually. The internet spent a lot of bandwidth last year with thinkpieces about that film and while I do think it’s kinda terrible it is so in an entertaining way. Rickman’s storyline is probably the best since it makes the pure physical attraction that drives every other story look as hollow and dirty as it is. Him and Emma Thompson play well off each other as a dissolving married couple (poor Joni Mitchell playing a part in the saddest scene in the movie not involving Laura Linney covering up and giving Paolo from Lost the boot). Of course since it’s a movie full of half baked ideas we don’t really know what the state of their relationship is at the end or if he even went ahead and banged his secretary (I say yes).\n\nThat’s a strong run of film submissions, take a bow Rickman.\n\nMiscellaneous Credits: I vaguely remember the HBO movie about the Russian Milton Berle, Rasputin existing. Always found him an interesting character in history going back to a history class I had about Russia and eastern Europe but this one escaped me and it sadly isn’t on HBOGO. Too bad, Ian McKellen as the last Tsar doesn’t happen every day. Plus, Rasputin dances! Might have to find this one online somewhere and watch while enjoying a fine beverage.\n\nHighest Rated IMDb Entry: A British miniseries from the Before Die Hard portion of his career, Smiley’s People. Try as I might I have been unable to come up with anything to add here other than trying to shoehorn in a reference to Surly Duff being Smiley’s arch-nemesis.\n\nLowest Rated IMDb Entry: Damn, at 5.5 The January Man is still the best of anyone’s worst showing in this feature, raise a glass Rickman. Unfortunately I’m not overly familiar with this either, but it is another film to have both Rickman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in it. Hopefully their familiarity with each other helped make filming the attempted rape scene at the end of Robin Hood an easier day of work. And for those wondering what Kevin Kline’s up to these days he kills it every time Mr. Fischoeder pops up on Bob’s Burgers.\n\nIMDb Fun Fact: So the entire time I’ve been doing these didn’t even know there was an actual Fun Fact section in every performer’s page. My favorite of the 52 listed for Rickman:\n\nFor the shot where Hans Gruber falls from the top of the building in Die Hard (1988), was actually dropped by a stuntman from a 20-foot high model onto an air bag. To get a genuine surprised look, the stuntman dropped him on the count of two instead of three.\n\nAlso I sat out The Butler since it looked like little more than Oscar bait but I’ve just found out that I missed Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan. Suppose the makeup is done pretty well but this is still odd-looking.\n\nIMDb HOF Memebers: The ranking business was becoming an annoyance so I’m scrapping it and will instead use this section to list everyone who came before in case an installment was missed. (Rickman would have totally been #1 though.)\n\nCary Elwes\n\nJami Gertz\n\nAllison Janney\n\nRobert Patrick\n\nBill Paxton\n\nAlan Ruck"
