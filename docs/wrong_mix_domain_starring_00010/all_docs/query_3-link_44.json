        "text": "Harry Potter Luncheon\n\nAlan Rickman, right, poses with \"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe in 2011.\n\n(AP/Starpix/Dave Allocca)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio - Alan Rickman achieved worldwide renown as a film star. That's probably how you knew him.\n\nYou knew him as Prof. Severus Snape in the \"Harry Potter\" films. You knew him as villainous Hans Gruber in \"Die Hard.\" You knew him as long-suffering actor Alexander Dane in \"Galaxy Quest.\"\n\nSo many great movie performances from the versatile Rickman, who died of cancer Thursday at 69: Col. Brandon in \"Sense and Sensibility,\" the ghostly Jamie in \"Truly, Madly, Deeply,\" the evil Sheriff of Nottingham in \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,\" Judge Turpin in the film version of \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\"\n\nBut as appreciative as he was for the film roles that came his way, Rickman always considered himself, first and foremost, a man of the theater.\n\n\"He was intelligent, he wrote plays, he directed plays,\" his friend and \"Harry Potter\" co-star Michael Gambon told BBC Radio 4. \"So he was a real man of the theater and the stage, and that's how I think of Alan.\"\n\nIt was how Rickman thought of himself, which became abundantly clear the one and only time I interviewed him. About five TV critics met with him in January 2004 at the Hollywood Renaissance Hotel. He was there to promote \"Something the Lord Made,\" an HBO movie co-starring Mos Def.\n\nHe always went back to the theater, he said. It wasn't just out of love. It was a necessity.\n\n\"The theater is like going back to the gym,\" Rickman said. \"It's where you really find out what the muscles are doing. But I also think that I'm a better actor on stage for the work I've done on film.\"\n\nMany of Rickman's friends also talked about his sly sense of humor and quick wit. This came into play when another critic asked what the actor knew now that he wished he knew when he was younger. He went back to a bit part he played in a 1989 comedy-thriller, \"The January Man.\"\n\n\"Well, I remember being on the set with Susan Sarandon, and I was pacing up and down, just before an entrance,\" Rickman said. \"And she was sitting there, in a chair, and somewhere from the back of one of her drawling sentences, she said, 'Don't think about it. That was my mistake.' \"\n\nFor her part, Sarandon Tweeted this on Thursday: \"Alan Rickman was an actor's actor; courageous, generous, witty and surprising. When he laughed he lit up a room. A prince.\"\n\nRickman jokingly referred to one of the villains he played as \"a sweet guy\" (a term many colleagues and friends are using to describe him). It was pointed out that he also played the title role in \"Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny.\" Was Rasputin a sweet guy, too?\n\n\"Very misunderstood,\" Rickman said with a perfect deadpan. \"The guy walked 3,000 miles on a pilgrimage. You can't knock him. If he were alive now, he'd have a very, very successful practice in Beverly Hills.\"\n\nWas there a favorite role, either on stage or film?\n\n\"No, because, believe it or not, you always think you've failed,\" Rickman said. \"You only ever see what went wrong.\"\n\nIt was the response of an artist who held himself to the highest standards, but, today, we only see how splendidly he succeeded - we see how much went wonderfully right."
