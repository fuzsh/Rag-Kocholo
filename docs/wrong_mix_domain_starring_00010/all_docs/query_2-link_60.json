        "text": "Alan Rickman, best known for his roles in the Harry Potter films and Die Hard, died from cancer on January 14, 2016, aged 69.\n\nTo mark the first anniversary of his death, Martin Chilton takes a look back at some of the highlights of his career.\n\nThe much-loved British actor first shot to stardom in 1988 when he played Hans Gruber, Bruce Willis's adversary, in the first Die Hard movie. Rickman, who had just finished playing the manipulative Valmont in the Royal Shakespeare Company's stage production of Les Liaisons Dangereuses. initially turned down the role, saying: \"What the hell is this? I’m not doing an action movie.” The London-born actor, then 41, said he was won over by the script and by the fact that \"every single black character in that film is positive and highly intelligent”.\n\nAlan Rickman and Bonnie Bedelia in Die Hard. Rickman once told The Hollywood Reporter that he was nervous in the scenes involving guns. \"If you look carefully, you’ll see me blinking,\" he said but claimed he soon settled into the role of a psychotic killer. \"It is shocking how thrilling it is to shoot a machine gun, that I discovered,\" he said.\n\nDie Hard: film review\n\nHe gained legions of fans for his role as Professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films. Asked once about being recognised for a role he took in his fifties, Rickman said: \"I don't get recognised that much in England because everybody walks down the street staring at the pavement. That's a relief. Honestly, I never expect it because that long black wig is a huge disguise. It doesn't happen as often as you might think it would. It's such a kind of strong outline - black wig, black eyes, white face - that seeing me running for a cab or something is not the image that people associate with the character.\"\n\nAlan Rickman as Severus Snape in Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix. Before his acting career, Rickman worked as a graphic designer and only when he was 25 did he decide to study acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Rickman later said: \"When I was 18, the idea of going to drama school, that would be the quickest way to slit my throat, although I knew it was the thing I liked doing most.”\n\nAlan Rickman as Professor Snape in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Following the actor's death, Harry Potter fans around the world were tweeting #Always - one the word Snape says when he reveals that he is in love with Harry's mother, Lily. Daniel Radcliffe, who played the eponymous wizard, called Rickman \"undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with\". Contrary to the stern character of Professor Snape he played in the films, Radcliffe remembered him as \"extremely kind, generous, self-deprecating and funny\". He is also one of the loyalest and most supportive people I've ever met in the film industry. He was so encouraging of me both on set and in the years post-Potter. I'm pretty sure he came and saw everything I ever did on stage both in London and New York. He didn't have to do that,\" he wrote.\n\nAlan Rickman in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Rickman played George, Sheriff of Nottingham, in a movie that also starred Kevin Costner (as Robin Hood), Morgan Freeman (as Azeem) and Christian Slater (as Will Scarlet). In a Bafta talk last year, Rickman admitted that some of the \"terrible\" script was actually the work of his friends Ruby Wax and Peter Barnes. Rickman said he met Barnes in a Pizza Express restaurant and said: \"I will you have a look at this script because it’s terrible, and I need some good lines.’ So he did, and, you know, with kind of pizza and bacon and egg going all over the script.”\n\nAlan Rickman, in a wig again, as PL O'Hara in the 1995 film An Awfully Big Adventure. The coming-of-age film was directed by Mike Newell. \"I think there should be laughs in everything,\" said Rickman. \"Sometimes, it's a slammed door, a pie in the face or just a recognition of our frailties.\"\n\nHeike Makatsch and Alan Rickman in the 2003 film Love Actually. In the romantic comedy, Rickman played a man in a troubled marriage.His wife (Emma Thompson) discovers that Rickman's character Harry, who is the managing director of a design agency, has a thing for his sultry secretary Mia. \"If only life could be a little more tender and art a little more robust,\" Rickman said once.\n\nThe German novelist Patrick Süskind wrote Perfume in 1985. It is the tale of a young man, Grenouille, born under a fish gutter's table in 18th-century Paris. Possessed of an abnormal sense of smell, Grenouille ends up murdering more than a dozen virgins in his pursuit of the perfect scent. The film version was made in 2006, with Rickman starring as the wealthy Antoine Richis, whose daughter Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is the planned \"13th scent victim\" of Grenouille.\n\nNobel Son is a 2007 American comedy in which Alan Rickman plays a Nobel prize-winning professor and Mary Steenburgen stars as his wife (above), with Bryan Greenberg as their kidnapped son. Rickman said of his role: \"I’m basically playing an adult, but he’s a seven-year-old, if that. Any time you get to be reminded of that, the actor must hang on to the child inside them, that opportunity is kind of heaven-sent.\"\n\nGambit is a remake of a 1966 comedy starring Michael Caine as a crooked art dealer. Joel and Ethan Coen wrote the script. Colin Firth plays Harry Deane, a mild-mannered art curator who is in the pay of Lionel Shahbandar (Alan Rickman), a boorish red-faced media mogul who treats him with offhand contempt. Deane, together with his friend known as “The Major” (Tom Courtenay), an experienced forger, pulls in a Texan rodeo rider called PJ Puznowski (Cameron Diaz) as part of a complicated sting to trick Shahbandar into forking out millions for a “lost” masterpiece by Monet.\n\nJane Fonda as Former First Lady Nancy Reagan and Alan Rickman as Former President Ronald Reagan in the 2012 film The Butler. Some critics and Republican politicians condemned the movie for what they said was an outrageous caricature of Reagan. Reagan's son Michael said that the film should be called The Butler from Another Planet because it is so historically inaccurate. \"Portraying Ronald Reagan as a racist because he was in favour of lifting economic sanctions against South Africa is simplistic and dishonest,\" he said. \"If you knew my father, you'd know he was the last person on Earth you would call a racist.\""
