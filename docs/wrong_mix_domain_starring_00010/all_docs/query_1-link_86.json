        "text": "The Guardian recently published extracts from the actor's diary, and they offer surprising insight into his time on the \"Harry Potter\" set.\n\nWhen discussing his younger costars, Rickman said, \"These kids need directing. They don't know their lines and Emma [Watson]'s diction is this side of Albania at times.\"\n\nThis criticism came when the actor was working on the third film in the saga, \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" which he sarcastically described as a \"fabulous\" production when discussing an accident where he was briefly knocked unconscious.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe third film saw revelations unfold when a murderer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), escapes from the aforementioned prison. Meanwhile, Watson's role saw Hermione dabble in time travel so she could take more classes at school, something which later became a key plot point in the film's dramatic finale.\n\nRickman spent plenty of time working with Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint in the early films because the young characters constantly found themselves at odds with the sneering potions master.\n\nDespite the criticism from Rickman Watson has since gone on to forge a very successful career for herself, garnering roles in projects like 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" \"Beauty and the Beast,\" and Greta Gerwig's \"Little Women.\"\n\nThe \"Die Hard\" star also discussed the franchise's leading man in the extracts, saying that he didn't think Radcliffe was going to be a successful actor.\n\nRickman wrote: \"Corridor with Dan Radcliffe. He's so concentrated now. Serious and focused â€“ but with a sense of fun. I still don't think he's really an actor but he will undoubtedly direct/produce.\""
