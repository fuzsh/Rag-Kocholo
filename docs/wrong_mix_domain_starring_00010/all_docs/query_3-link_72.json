        "text": "From ‘Sensibility’ to Snape: A tribute to Alan Rickman\n\nAs sorry as I was to hear of David Bowie’s passing, the celebrity death that really hit me last week was that of Alan Rickman.\n\nAn actor of amazing versatility and charm — brilliant both at playing villains and romantic heroes, plus everything in between — Rickman enriched every film he appeared in over a career that spanned four decades. That’s not too shabby for an actor who (according to a recent NPR story) once had a teacher tell him his voice sounded like it was “coming out of the back end of a drainpipe.”\n\nYes, millennials will always think of Rickman as Professor Snape of the “Harry Potter” movies — and he was wonderful in them. But Snape was just one small part of a broad filmography. A tribute:\n\n•“A Little Chaos”: In one of his final appearances—a movie he also directed and co-wrote—Rickman has a supporting role as France’s fabled King Louis XIV, a harsh but sensitive taskmaster overseeing the work on his gardens at Versailles.\n\n•“Sense and Sensibility”: This swoon-worthy film made me fall in love with Rickman back in 1995. He plays Colonel Brandon, the mature, stalwart counterpoint to the inconstant young swain who captures the heart of heroine Kate Winslet.\n\n•“Die Hard”: Rickman first came to the attention of American audiences with his masterful turn in the now-classic 1988 action flick as Hans Gruber, the urbane mastermind behind the siege of an L.A. office tower.\n\n•“Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves”: Again wearing his villain’s cap, Rickman was the evil Sheriff of Nottingham to Kevin Costner’s man-in-tights in this entertaining 1991 swashbuckler.\n\n• “Bottle Shock”: This delightful real-life tale about the rise of the California wine industry co-stars Rickman as the critic who spearheaded the famed “Judgment of Paris” tasting that brought the state’s vintners to international prominence.\n\n• “Perfume: The Story of a Murderer”: This riveting indie follows an eighteenth-century serial killer obsessed with concocting the perfect scent; Rickman plays the father of a potential victim.\n\n•“Love Actually”: Among the many intersecting stories in this 2003 ensemble film is the tale of a long-married man (Rickman) who strays from his wife (Emma Thompson).\n\n•“Galaxy Quest”: By Grabthar’s hammer! Rickman is utterly fantastic as a jaded, world-weary actor from a “Star Trek” clone who finds himself on a real-world space adventure.\n\n•“Dogma”: In Kevin Smith’s controversial 1999 meditation on faith, Rickman is perfectly cast as Metatron, the Voice of God.\n\n• “Truly Madly Deeply”: Get your Kleenex ready. In writer-director Anthony Minghella’s quiet masterpiece from 1990, Rickman plays a musician who mysteriously comes back from the dead to comfort his heartbroken girlfriend (Juliet Stevenson).\n\n•“Michael Collins”: In writer-director Neil Jordan’s 1996 biopic about the titular Irish revolutionary, Rickman plays a leader of the Easter Rising who goes on to become the republic’s president.\n\n•“The Butler”: Though I thought Lee Daniels’ 2013 movie about the life and times of a long-serving White House staffer was wildly overrated, Rickman is surprisingly well cast as former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n•“An Awfully Big Adventure”: Mike Newell’s dark, prickly coming-of-age story from 1995 features Rickman as an older man lusting after a young actress, with tragic consequences.\n\n•“Sweeney Todd”: In Tim Burton’s uneven 2007 musical, Rickman is the evil judge who sets the “Demon Barber of Fleet Street” on his bloody campaign of revenge.\n\n•“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”: Largely a misfire, this 2005 adaptation of Douglas Adams’ satirical classic does have a few things to recommend it — not the least of which is Rickman’s voiceover turn as Marvin the Paranoid Android.\n\nSaulnier is The Ithaca Journal’s film critic."
