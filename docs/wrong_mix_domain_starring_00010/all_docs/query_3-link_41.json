        "text": "Since a few days, me and my buddy we have been discussing French history and about former king of France \"Louis XIV\" on how he ruled France by iron fist and how he created the Palace of Versailles during his ruling days. It seemed like Déjà vu another \"French origin word\" when I watched this English movie about the making of Versailles in the hands of its French Architect and landscape designer called \"A little chaos (2014) \" today. The movie also shows on how the Palace of Versailles was engineered along with its' gardens and the civil and mechanical engineering works that made the existence of gardens possible.\n\nWhen I heard a dialogue and saw a picture which I have posted here from that movie with Kate Winslet's garden designer character who has just been rejected by the Chief Architect of Versailles from her applied position as the Garden landscape designer and she is just thinking while sitting on the tree branches; it gave me an impression that this movie is something that I have written so many times now on the matters of human subjectivity in my past articles. The dialogue goes like this:\n\nThe Chief architect of Versailles interviews the prospective landscape designer interviewee Kate Winslet \" Do you believe in order over landscape?\" (he, an engineer and an objective thinker is enquiring if she believes in architect's orderly measured length, breath and heights based on precision based engineering drawing figures to be applied while designing garden of Versailles)\n\nThe Interviewee 's reply to the question is in a purely philosophical and subjective way where her reply which eventually gets her selected for the job of landscape garden designer was \"Order seems to demand that we look back to Rome or to Renaissance. What I say is, surely isn't there something uniquely French as yet not celebrated by us which needs the rules of order to attain it ? (The reply indicates how the unique Garden of Versailles needed fresh and creative thinking based on natural fractal designs than objective way of looking at things in length, breath and height based design based on older regimes such as Rome or Renaissance ). The entire movie then revolves around how the woman landscape designer fights all odds against the conspiring male counterparts to finally establish her way of subjective and philosophical way of designing the gardens which greatly impresses Louis XIV to approve of the landscaping works.\n\nHow I have been expressing this simple fact since many many articles how humanity is far far superior than the artificial intelligence that is being feared of to take away our jobs or making humanity irrelevant. It seems late English actor Alan Rickman who was famous as Professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series and even remembered today as a notorious villain in the Die Hard movie franchise; knew this simple fact too when he decided to co-write the script of this movie and also directed the movie. It just touches my heart this movie \"A little chaos\" and how creative people, artistically inclined people realized this simple fact about the enormity of human nature that can't be copied by AI. But it also breaks my heart that we the objective human beings of 21st century have just shut our eyes to the entire Universe while we think the big data and the big data manipulating AI is the entire Universe that represents us human beings in totality.\n\nWatch this movie \"A little chaos\" and do create a little chaos in your mind to break away from your limiting beliefs regarding humans to be replaced by AI in coming days and embrace your subjectivity, imagination and the fractal nature of our existence which nothing can copy or imitate. We human beings carry a certain authenticity that is more attractive for us humans than the attraction of the objectivity of AI."
