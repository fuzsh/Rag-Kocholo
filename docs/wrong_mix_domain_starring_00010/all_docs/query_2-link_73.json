        "text": "Alan Rickman set pulses soaring when he starred in the Texas music video 'In Demand' opposite Scottish singer Sharleen Spiteri back in 2000.\n\nThe Millennium Bug was a mere distant memory, the Millennium Dome was brand spanking new and the British indie scene was at its peak.\n\nBut many people have forgotten 2000 is also the year acting legend Alan Rickman starred in a Texas music video opposite Sharleen Spiteri - and the resulting footage is an absolute masterpiece.\n\nTexas' 10 best songs ever, ranked\n\nSharleen Spiteri and daughter Misty look like twins in Texas video for ‘Unbelievable’\n\nLove Actually: Where are the cast now?\n\nThe revered actor won a BAFTA an Emmy and a Golden Globe starred in some of the most famous films of recent times.\n\nFilm credits include Love Actually, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Die Hard and Sense and Sensibility and playing Professor Snape in the Harry Potter franchise, yet his Texas debut is a hidden gem.\n\nThe actor plays the older, former lover of a woman (Spiteri) who, as the song reveals, was treated badly by Rickman's character in their relationship.\n\nThe woman reveals she was not appreciated by her partner and is now being approached by new men to take his place - hence she's 'In Demand'.\n\nThe video opens with Sharleen and Alan in the backseat of a car as it speeds over London's Blackfriars bridge.\n\nRickman strokes her hair as she sings and embraces him, before the pair stop for petrol and perform a stunning tango filled with sexual tension in the station forecourt.\n\nSpeaking about how the video came about, Spiteri recalls having a brainstorm about the single, when serendipity intervened.\n\nThe 30 greatest romcom movies ever, ranked in order of guilty pleasure romantic bliss\n\nQUIZ: What's the theme tune to your life? These 9 questions will tell you\n\nListen to the Smooth Love Songs Live Playlist on Global Player\n\n“We were having a meeting about the video and who I should tango with and our friend composer Michael Kamen popped his head around and said, ‘I was on the phone with my mate Alan Rickman. He’s a big fan’, she told NME.\n\n“And it fell into place, we remained great friends and I miss Alan greatly, and I still hear his voice.\"\n\nThe appearance in Texas' music video marked the beginning of a long friendship between Alan Rickman and the Scottish singer.\n\nWatch Alan Rickman's appearance in Texas' 'In Demand' video below:\n\nIn 2015 Rickman sang on the band's 25th anniversary album, Texas 25, and his voice can be heard on the opening track, 'Start A Family' and the actor starred in the song's accompanying music video, 15 years after his 'In Demand' debut.\n\n“We’re celebrating 25 years. What’s not to like about that? We had done a version of 'Start A Family' and thought it would be interesting to do something a bit different,\" Spiteri told The Daily Record in 2015.\n\n“That’s when I called and asked Alan if he’d like to do a bit of singing, which he laughed hysterically at.\n\n\"He went, ‘Really?’ I went, ‘Really, Alan, we need your dulcet tones, so get your his a**e down here’.\n\nThe entertainment industry was suddenly plunged into mourning when Alan Rickman died of pancreatic cancer on January 14, 2016 at just 69-years-old.\n\nThe actor left behind his beloved wife, Rima Horton, a former Labour Councillor.\n\nThey had been together since they were just 19-years-old and had lived together for 35 years, marrying in secret in 2012."
