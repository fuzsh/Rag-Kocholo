        "text": "Alan Rickman, most notably remembered for his performances as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, recently died after a short battle with cancer on January 14, 2016. Rickman was only 69 at the time of his death, but he had an acting career that expanded over 40 years.\n\nRickman was British and studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After school he went on to pursue roles in British theatre and television. He attained worldwide fame in the 1988 action-thriller “Die Hard.” Thirteen years later Rickman was cast as Snape, and the character was on screen in all of the movies. Rickman really went above and beyond in his portrayal; he went further than the traditional foil for Harry, and instead made Snape mysterious, complex, and at times heroic.\n\nMany of those whom Rickman worked with on Harry Potter shared their condolences on social media. Book series author J.K. Rowling called him a “magnificent actor” and Daniel Radcliffe, the actor who plays Harry Potter, wrote a lengthy social media post about his relationship with the deceased. Radcliffe wrote, “Alan was extremely kind, generous, self-deprecating and funny. And certain things obviously became even funnier when delivered in his unmistakable double-bass.”\n\nOther notable performances by Rickman include “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991), “Love Actually” (2003), “Galaxy Quest” (1999), and “Sense and Sensibility” (1995). Rickman continued to perform on stage in London and New York, participating in a few Broadway shows. He also directed a play called “Creditors” in 2008 and directed and acted in the film “A Little Chaos” (2014). Rickman will be featured in the coming films, “Eye in the Sky,” a thriller, and “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” as the voice of the Blue Caterpillar.\n\nRickman is survived by his wife, Rima Horton, and his siblings Michael, David and Sheila Rickman. Fans of his work will also never forget his memory, and his impact on the world of acting."
