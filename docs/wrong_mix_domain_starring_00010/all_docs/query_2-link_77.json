In the cluttered house she shared with her late mother, Doris mines the Internet for information on her one-and-only. Her guide to, for Doris, the baffling digital/Internet age is the 13-year-old granddaughter of her best pal Roz (Tyne Daly). When Doris begins showing up at John's regular haunts, she wins over his Williamsburg friends. Her new life brings Doris a thrilling perspective, but also creates a rift between her and her longtime friends and family, who believe she's making a fool of herself over a guy half her age. Doris throws caution to the wind and follows her heart for the very first time. Hello My Name is Doris opens Friday at the Michigan.\n\nCritics Consensus:Hello, My Name Is Doris is immeasurably elevated by Sally Field's remarkable performance in the title role, which overpowers a surfeit of stereotypical indie quirk.\n\nPeggy Guggenheim: Art Addict documents the life of heiress Peggy Guggenheim, a colorful character who was not only ahead of her time but helped to define it as a central figure in the modern art movement. As she moved through the cultural upheaval of the 20th century, she collected not only art, but artists. Her colorful personal history included such figures as Samuel Beckett, Max Ernst, Jackson Pollock, Alexander Calder, Marcel Duchamp as well as countless others. While fighting through personal tragedy, she maintained her vision to build one of the most important collections of modern art, now enshrined in her Venetian palazzo. Peggy Guggenheim: Art Addict plays occasionally at the Michigan.\n\nAferim! was submitted by Romania for Academy Award consideration. Set in early 19th century, gendarme Constandin and his son search for a gypsy slave who has run away from his nobleman master and is suspected of having an affair with the noble's wife. While the unflappable Costandin comments on every situation with a cheery aphorism, his son takes a more contemplative view of the world. On their odyssey they encounter people of different nationalities and beliefs. And even when the slave Carfin is found, the adventure is far from over... Aferim! continues at the Michigan.\n\nCritics Consensus: Smart, visually arresting, and scathingly funny, Aferim! depicts a world that many American filmgoers have never seen -- but will still, in many respects, find utterly familiar.\n\nOpening Downtown\n\nEye in the Sky stars Helen Mirren as Colonel Katherine Powell, a UK-based military officer in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya. Through remote surveillance and on-the-ground intel, Powell discovers the targets are planning a suicide bombing and the mission escalates from \"capture\" to \"kill.\" But as American pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) is about to engage, a nine-year old girl enters the kill zone triggering an international dispute, reaching the highest levels of US and British government, over the moral, political, and personal implications of modern warfare. The film also features Alan Rickman in his final screen performance; Stephen Holden of the New York Times writes \"(Rickman's performance) is a great one, suffused with a dyspeptic world-weary understanding of war and human nature...Ms. Mirren has rarely been icier, and her powerful, scary performance doesn't strive to make her character likable.\" Eye in the Sky opens Friday at the State.\n\nI Saw the Light tells the story of the legendary country western singer Hank Williams (Tom Hiddleston, in a virtuoso performance), who in his brief life created one of the greatest bodies of work in American music. The film chronicles his meteoric rise to fame and its ultimately tragic effect on his health and personal life. Hiddleston's portrayal of Williams is receiving near-universal accolades; Peter Travers of Rolling Stone writes \"Hiddleston gives the role his considerable all, including singing Hank Williams hits in a voice that persuasively suggests the real thing.\" I Saw the Light opens Friday at the State.\n\nSpecial Screenings Downtown\n\nIn Cart, exploited temp workers at a big-box store in South Korea organize themselves to fight layoffs. Cart plays Saturday April 2 at 2 PM as part of the Korean Cinema Now film series. Admission is free.\n\nAkira is one of the best-known examples of contemporary Japanese animation. This cyberpunk adventure takes place in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo, where a teen-age boy is exposed to a mysterious energy source and develops telekinetic powers that place him at the center of a conflict that may destroy the world. Akira plays Wednesday April 6 at 7 PM at the State as part of the CineManga Film Series.\n\nM-agination Films is a student film production organization which seeks to provide film production and acting opportunities for U-M students across all majors and experience levels. This year's M-agination Film Festival features an incredible line-up of films from the 2015-2016 school year including sketch, dramas, music videos, experimental films, documentaries, a web series and a short film celebrating 15 years of creating exceptional student passion projects at the University of Michigan.

This sequel to the 2014 faith-based box office hit God's Not Dead also stars Jesse Metcalfe, David A.R. White and Ray Wise. God's Not Dead 2 opens Friday."
