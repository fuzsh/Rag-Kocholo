        "text": "(1946–2016). British actor Alan Rickman had a distinguished career in which he portrayed a vast array of characters, both virtuous and villainous, in the theater, in films, and in television productions. As Hans Gruber, the sinister villain in the hit action movie Die Hard (1988), Rickman created one of the most memorable villains in modern cinema while introducing himself to American audiences. In the 21st century he became known to a whole new generation of moviegoers with his portrayal of the complex Severus Snape, who evolves over the eight Harry Potter movies (2001–11) from young Harry’s sarcastic and bullying teacher into an unexpectedly heroic ally.\n\nAlan Sidney Patrick Rickman was born on February 21, 1946, in London, England. He made his first stage appearance at age 11 in a school production. Rickman later enrolled at the Chelsea Art College and then attended the Royal College of Art, where he honed his skills as a graphic artist. When he finished school in the late 1960s, he set up a design company and briefly worked in graphic arts before deciding that he really wanted to become an actor. He auditioned for the renowned Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and was accepted for admission. Rickman attended RADA from 1972 to 1974 and won several distinguished prizes for his performances. He subsequently performed with various British repertory and experimental theater groups, including stints with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and ’80s, Rickman racked up extensive credits for his stage performances. Cast as the heartless seducer Vicomte de Valmont in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s production of Les Liaisons dangereuses, he earned a Tony Award nomination when the production came to Broadway (New York) in 1987. Rickman returned to the stage in London (2001) and on Broadway (2002) in a revival of Noël Coward’s Private Lives; both productions earned him Tony Award nominations.\n\nBeginning in 1978, Rickman appeared in several British television specials and miniseries as well as on radio specials. His Hollywood debut, as the intelligent and evil West German terrorist Hans Gruber in the feature film Die Hard, launched his film career. It was the first of many roles as complex, often humorous or charming villains. He became a film star in his 40s, appearing in such movies as The January Man (1989), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), Truly, Madly, Deeply (1991), Sense and Sensibility (1995), and Michael Collins (1996).\n\nRickman’s film career continued in the 21st century. Besides the Harry Potter movies, Rickman appeared in Tim Burton’s Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), as the corrupt Judge Turpin, and in Lee Daniels’ The Butler (2013), as U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Rickman provided the voice of Marvin, the Paranoid Android in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (2005) and voiced the Blue Caterpillar in Burton’s Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016)."
