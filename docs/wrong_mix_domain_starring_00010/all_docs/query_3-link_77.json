        "text": "A little disheartening to see my facebook feed filled to the brim the other day with David Bowie stuff and so little about Alan Rickman today. I respect Bowie as a person, an artist and an actor. Though his music never really grabbed me outside of his teamup with Trent Reznor. Yet between the two, Rickman has had far more influence on my life. I don't think I've seen him in anything I didn't like him in. From drama to action to comedy he brought his best. Often intermixing the three.\n\nEverytime an actor like this that I admire and respect dies, the thought goes through my head that should I ever make it to Hollywood \"here's another one I'll never get the chance to meet and potentially work with.\"\n\nI was really devastated to hear this this morning. I'm not big into Harry Potter but I always really had a respect for him in particular and the unique character he brings. Also, he was so incredible in Sweeney Todd. Among others of course. Really devastating to see him go but his memory will definitely live on through some incredible performances."
