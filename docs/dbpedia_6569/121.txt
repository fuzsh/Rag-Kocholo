In Reply to: Giving someone the high hat posted by Patty on June 17, 2001

: Not long ago, friends and I watched a video movie set in the 1920s or '30s. One of the characters repeatedly, at different points in the story, used the phrase "now you're giving me the high hat." Not being familiar with the expression, I took from it that the guy felt snubbed. Anyone have some light on this? Thanks. - Patty
