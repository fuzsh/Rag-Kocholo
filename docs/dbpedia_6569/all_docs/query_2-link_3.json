        "text": "Ev'ry Day Is Mother's Day to Me (the only song in this that is a bit memorable)\n\nA very weak plot not helped by spiritless acting. (The plot says that the leading lady in this was in love with X character, but you'd never know that from watching this dull film.)\n\nIt is watchable, however, thanks to Franklin Pangborn having a sizable (not bit) role herein and the icing on that cake is that he sings 4 songs in this!\n\nIf you are a fan of Franklin, too See my list mentioning how much Pangborn appears in lots of movies in which he appears.\n\n4.5/10 (almost 'C' level in quality, but nice to see Pangborn belt out some songs)\n\nNot much of a plot, but that's not why this movie exists. It's a low budget musical with the entire selling point being the songs. And Imperial Productions actually manages to collects a strong cast. Not the most charismatic leads with Frank Luther & Dorothy Dare on top, but the support is the best they can get on a discount. Most prominent Franklin Pangborn singing opera and the ever gorgeous Lona Andre.\n\nWhat's most surprising about his musical is that the songs are actually quite catchy! If you like 1930s style singing, that is. And you get plenty of songs from the romantic leads along with intermission performances from Pangborn singing without his pants, Clarence Muse doing a cool African number and various short ones from Downey Sisters and other unknown acts from the show circuit. So very much a happy experience even if this isn't much story to talk about. Only the songs."
