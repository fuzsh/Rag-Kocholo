        "text": "The jazz pianist Jason Moran is becoming as well known for his revisions of other people's music as for anything else. With his trio, the Bandwagon, he unveiled a few new cover versions on Tuesday night during a spiky tumbleweed of a set at the Village Vanguard.\n\nOne was part of Prokofiev's 1938 score to Sergei Eisenstein's film ''Aleksandr Nevsky''; it's the dire, dramatic, stabbing music accompanying a battle on the ice near the end of the movie. Another was Henry Threadgill's ''Too Much Sugar'' (1993), which seems barely translatable from its original stacked-harmony arrangement for French horn, tuba, guitar, violin and other instruments. Another was Wes Montgomery's ''Four on Six,'' a brilliant piece of straight-ahead jazz from 1960.\n\nOn paper the far-flung repertory can look trendy. (A jazz trio that covers hip-hop, Bjork and Harlem stride, as well as Prokofiev, Threadgill and Montgomery? Isn't everybody doing that sort of thing?) But what's hard to transmit isn't just the band's original group sound but its jolting energy; the jolts are palpable, and the context can be fairly abstract. Nobody else sounds like this.\n\nIn Tuesday's early set, the music kept going into a group crumple. There were calculated moments of tension, like James Brown's staged fainting. At a cue from Mr. Moran, the drummer Nasheet Waits would slow his tempo in sync with the piano and then roll into free rhythm, all drums rattling at a low hum in different patterns, with an underline of pulse from the high-hat cymbal."
