        "text": "Proceeds from the limited-edition merchandise will be donated to Aloha United Way in support of restoration efforts of Maui one year after the Lahaina wildfires\n\nAUSTIN, Minn., Aug. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today is National SPAM® Musubi Day, and the makers of the SPAM® brand have launched a limited-edition, Musubi-inspired merch collection to pay homage to the place that made SPAM® Musubi the globally beloved snack it is today. Available while supplies last on SPAM.com, the new National SPAM® Musubi Day Merch Collection includes trendy apparel, summertime essentials and even a SPAM® Musubi-shaped ottoman.\n\nToday also marks the first anniversary of the Lahaina wildfires that devastated the Maui and Hawaiian communities. As a part of the SPAM® brand's ongoing efforts to support the people of Maui, 100% of the proceeds from this collection will go to Aloha United Way to aid in the restoration efforts on the island.\n\nFrom grocery stores to gas stations, SPAM® Musubi is a treat within Hawaiian culture and cuisine, but it has also been adapted and enjoyed by many other cultures and fans around the world. The new SPAM® Musubi Day Merch Collection allows SPAM® brand fans to show off their love for the brand while supporting an important cause. From playful beach towels and eye-catching tumblers to cheerful wearables featuring sun-loving Musubi characters, the SPAM® Musubi Day Merch Collection offers something for every SPAM® brand fan.\n\n\"We love giving our SPAM® Fam new, trendy merch to show off their fandom, and this SPAM® Musubi Day Merch Collection is a colorful and playful tribute to both Musubi and to our Ohana in Hawaiʻi who have played an integral role in making the SPAM® brand what it is today,\" said Jennesa Kinscher, senior brand manager for the SPAM® brand. \"We know there is still a great deal of work to be done in Lahaina's restoration, and we remain committed to supporting the local community. That is why all proceeds from this collection will go to Aloha United Way, which focuses on four key areas: kids and young adults; mental health support; stabilizing housing; and job training, education and employment.\n\nTo help drive even more support for this collection and its purpose, Hawaiian actor, singer and SPAM® brand fan Auli'i Cravalho is partnering with the SPAM® brand to show her support.\n\n\"Growing up in Hawaiʻi, SPAM® Musubi is everywhere, from convenience store shelves to home-packed school lunches,\" Cravalho said. \"SPAM® products are a reminder of home, comfort and island culture, no matter how far from Hawaii I might be. Teaming up with the makers of the SPAM® brand to promote this beloved island snack, while sending 100% of merch proceeds to Aloha United Way to help in Lahaina's fire recovery is as meaningful as the collection is enjoyable to wear.
