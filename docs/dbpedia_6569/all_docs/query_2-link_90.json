Jean Carroll. “The judge in that case wrote, ‘Mr. Trump’s attempt to minimize sexual abuse, finding it frivolous. Mr. Trump raped her,’” Biden said. “That’s the judge’s language, not mine,” Biden added. “He raped her.”\n\nFirst 100 days in office: For the first time, Biden also laid out what his priorities would be for the first 100 days of his second term, which included codifying Roe v. Wade, making the child tax cuts permanent, expanding Medicare and Medicaid, raising the minimum wage and banning assault weapons.\n\nOn misspeaking: Biden pointed to Trump’s own verbal slips, the day after Biden faced scrutiny for calling Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky “President Putin” and referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Vice President Trump.” “I guess they don’t remember that Trump called Nikki Haley ‘Nancy Pelosi,’” Biden said, referring to an incident from the Republican primary.\n\nLengthy remarks: Biden stayed engaged with the crowd throughout the 36-minute appearance. He mostly spoke using a teleprompter but did seem to veer off script at several points in the speech.\n\nSen. Sanders tells Democrats to \"stop the bickering and nit-picking\" and back Biden\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont continued to urge Democrats to back President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, writing in a Saturday op-ed for The New York Times that he “may not be the ideal candidate, but he will be the candidate and should be the candidate.”\n\nSanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, has been one of Biden’s critical allies in Congress since the 81-year-old president’s dismal debate performance last month spurred calls for him to step aside from the race. Sanders, along with fellow progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have offered the president lifelines this week, publicly backing him during one of the tensest moments of Biden’s political life.\n\nIn his op-ed, Sanders acknowledged his disagreements with Biden, including about the US’ support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, but said “too many Democrats” have focused “on the June presidential debate and the cognitive capabilities of a man who has, perhaps, the most difficult and stressful job in the world.”\n\nSanders added: “With an effective campaign that speaks to the needs of working families, he will not only defeat Mr. Trump but beat him badly. It’s time for Democrats to stop the bickering and nit-picking.”\n\nFirst on CNN: The Republican National Convention's list of expected speakers\n\nThe Republican National Convention has a full range of speakers lined up for its conference next week, including potential vice presidential picks, lawmakers, governors, and celebrities like rapper Amber Rose and Dana White from the UFC, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n\nCNN reported earlier that former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and ex-Trump administration official Peter Navarro, who is expected to be released from prison on the same day he appears, would also speak.\n\nLawmakers speaking include:\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida\n\nSen. JD Vance of Ohio\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina\n\nSen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas\n\nSen. Katie Britt of Alabama\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik of New York\n\nRep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia\n\nRep. Byron Donalds of Florida\n\nA number of governors will speak, including:\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis of Florida\n\nGov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota\n\nGov. Greg Abbott of Texas\n\nGov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota\n\nGov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas\n\nFrom the former president’s family, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Lara Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle will have speaking roles.\n\nOther speakers include:\n\nKari Lake, US Senate candidate from Arizona\n\nBen Carson, former US secretary of Housing and Urban Development\n\nMike Pompeo, former US secretary of state\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, businessman\n\nCharlie Kirk, CEO of Turning Point USA\n\nAmber Rose, rapper and influencer\n\nDana White, CEO of UFC\n\nView the full list of speakers here.\n\nTucker Carlson expected to speak at GOP convention\n\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson is currently slated to speak at the Republican National Convention on the night former President Donald Trump is set to accept the Republican nomination for president, according to a person familiar with the plans.\n\nCarlson is scheduled to speak on Thursday, but the source said the day Carlson speaks may change as plans continue to be updated ahead of the convention in Milwaukee next week.\n\nIn lieu of attending the first GOP primary debate last year, Trump participated in an interview with Carlson, who aired the interview on X during the debate.\n\nCarlson and Fox News severed ties last year.\n\nThe rest of the speaking schedule is taking shape: Peter Navarro, an ex-White House aide to Trump, will also make remarks at the convention, a source familiar with the schedule tells CNN.\n\nNavarro is expected to be released from prison — where he has been serving time since March — on Wednesday and will speak at the convention that night.\n\nNavarro, an economist who focused on trade policy while in the Trump White House, was jailed for contempt of Congress after his refusal to comply with a subpoena related to the House Select Committee’s investigation of the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.\n\nThis post has been updated with an additional speaker at the convention.\n\nBiden will hold 2 more calls today aimed at soothing Democratic anxieties, sources say\n\nPresident Joe Biden is launching a delayed outreach campaign to lawmakers following his closely watched solo news conference and his meeting with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries earlier this week.\n\nThe president’s series of calls to key groups of congressional Democrats continues Saturday. He’ll hold virtual meetings with both the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, according to sources familiar with those meetings.\n\nOn Friday, the president also had calls with the political wings of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the sources said.\n\nThe discussions are aimed at stopping the defections in Biden’s Democratic coalition in Congress, which continued throughout the past week.\n\nMore than a dozen Democratic House members and at least one Democratic senator have publicly called on Biden to withdraw from his reelection campaign. That list includes multiple House members in the nation’s most competitive congressional districts, but also senior Democrats on influential committees and members in safely Democratic seats.\n\nHere’s what the Trump and Biden campaigns have planned in the battleground state of Pennsylvania today\n\nIt has been just over two weeks since the CNN presidential debate upended the 2024 campaign, leaving Democrats in a state of panic over President Joe Biden’s candidacy and allowing former President Donald Trump to largely sit back and watch the uncertainty unfold.\n\nTrump returns to the campaign trail Saturday, holding a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, at 5 p.m. ET. His last major event was held Tuesday in Miami.\n\nAs the Republican National Convention inches closer, all eyes are on when the former president will announce his running mate.\n\nUS Senate candidate Dave McCormick will speak at tonight’s rally, his spokesperson confirmed to CNN. McCormick — who earned Trump’s endorsement in April after failing to do so in his 2022 primary contest against Mehmet Oz — is challenging Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey.\n\nThe Biden campaign will also be on the trail in Pennsylvania today, with Vice President Kamala Harris set to give a keynote speech this afternoon at the Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote Presidential Town Hall in Philadelphia.\n\nThis event is a continuation of the Biden-Harris campaign’s national organizing and engagement program focused on mobilizing AAPI voters.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden, meanwhile, will deliver remarks at an Italian Sons and Daughters of America dinner in Pittsburgh.\n\nRemember: Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, is considered a key battleground state in the 2024 contest. It is one of the “Blue Wall” states, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, that the Biden campaign views as his most direct path to reelection.\n\nCNN’s Kit Maher and Christian Sierra contributed to this report.\n\nThis post has been updated with details about Trump’s rally tonight.\n\nCatch up on the Republican Party's new Trump-centered platform before the RNC next week\n\nRepublicans adopted a new platform for Donald Trump’s third White House run that mainlines the former president’s policies and makes Trump himself a focus of the party.\n\nThe policy blueprint is a fraction of the length of the 2016 platform and written in Trump’s voice.\n\nRepublicans also modestly softened their language on the issue of abortion — angering some anti-abortion activists — and made clear that, like Trump, the party will favor a state-by-state local approach to the issue, meaning they will support efforts to ban abortion outright in some states and allow it to exist in others.\n\nCNN annotated the full Republican Party platform — here are some of the other takeaways:\n\nRight off the bat, note that Trump’s signature motto “Make America Great Again!” is now the official tagline of the Republican Party.\n\nThe document’s dedication, “To the Forgotten Men and Women of America,” speaks to a central message in Trump’s populist rhetoric. His base of support is built on White voters without a college degree.\n\nThe document’s preamble is titled “America First.” Putting the United States above all other countries is also central to Trump’s populism.\n\nA little lower, the GOP agenda breaks into a 20-item list of promises — written in all capital letters, in Trump’s style — that it claims can be accomplished “very quickly.” The goals include sealing the border, “ending” inflation, making the US energy independent, and restoring peace in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nNotably, the list includes both the promise of no cuts to Social Security or Medicare and a vow to provide a large tax cut to workers. There is no mention of the spiraling national debt, which was once a major issue for Republicans.\n\nRead through CNN’s interactive with the entire GOP platform annotated here.\n\nAnalysis: Republicans and Democrats take opposite approaches to flawed candidates\n\nBoth President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are well into retirement age. Both ramble through answers to questions when they bother to take them. Both mix up names. Neither took part in debates during a primary season in which they racked up wins.\n\nOne of the men, Trump, 78, has been able to remake the Republican Party around his own divisive persona, despite being a recently convicted felon, indicted for election interference and mishandling classified documents, and found liable for sexual abuse and defamation — as well as lying about his net worth to get loans tied to his massive real estate portfolio.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden, 81, has now spent weeks defiantly defending his fitness for the job, slowly emerging from a protective bubble at the White House after a disastrous debate and spotty subsequent interviews.\n\nThe next week will offer a fresh look at what must feel like a cruel dichotomy to Biden supporters.\n\nWhen the Republican National Convention gets underway Monday, it will show off a speaking schedule full of far-right personalities and an official party platform rewritten and simplified around Trump’s priorities.\n\nTrump, between now and then, will pick a vice president from a short list of people who have previously criticized him but are now all in on his candidacy.\n\nWhile the former president celebrates his dominance at the convention, Biden will be fighting back the argument that Democratic convention delegates should pick a younger successor next month.\n\nThe latest in a series of public tests of Biden’s abilities will be another interview with a network news anchor, NBC this time, broadcast in prime time on Monday.\n\nSome Black voters who helped Biden win Georgia in 2020 say it's too risky to abandon him now\n\nFour years ago, Black voters saved Biden’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination after his poor finishes in predominantly White early voting states.\n\nNow, that support within the Black community – from battleground state voters and Black leaders – serves as one of the last bulwarks against a growing number of lawmakers and donors asking him to pass the torch.\n\nIn interviews, the president’s supporters in the state shared a similar message: The stakes of this election are too high to change course now.\n\nVoter voices: Alanna Morris tuned in to last month’s presidential debate hoping to watch President Joe Biden “wipe the floor” with former President Donald Trump.\n\nInstead, the 44-year-old Atlanta cardiologist saw a candidate she hardly recognized. She turned the event off halfway through, feeling sad and concerned the president had suffered a medical event like a stroke.\n\nThat disappointment, however, hasn’t dissuaded her from her plan to vote for the president. She finds the alternative – a second Trump term – untenable.\n\n“Don’t rock the boat unless you have a plan to get me back to shore,” she said. “Getting me to shore is making sure that Donald Trump is not in office come January 2025.”\n\n“The Democratic Party knew four years ago how old Joe Biden would be in 2024,” said Michelle Mitchell, a 69-year-old Black Atlanta resident who participated in a CNN roundtable with older voters and opposes efforts to pressure Biden to step aside. “To try to pull a stunt like this at the 11th hour is very disappointing.”\n\nHear more thoughts from Georgia voters here.\n\nBiden tells crowd in Detroit that he's still running — \"and we're going to win\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden charged forward with his campaign before an enthusiastic crowd in Detroit on Friday, declaring unequivocally, “I am running.”\n\nHe attacked Donald Trump in a number of new ways, including explicitly saying that Trump raped a woman.\n\n“I am running and we’re going to win,” he said to cheers.\n\nThe speech at a Detroit high school comes as the president has remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers and donors for him to step aside in the race. The Michigan crowd encouraged Biden to stay in the race, breaking out in a chant of “Don’t you quit!”\n\nFor the first time, Biden also laid out what his priorities would be for the first 100 days of his second term, which included codifying Roe v. Wade, making the child tax cuts permanent, expanding Medicare and Medicaid, raising the minimum wage and banning assault weapons.\n\nBiden was clearly engaged with the crowd throughout his lengthy remarks which ran for 36 minutes.\n\n\"He raped her,\" Biden cites judge’s ruling in Trump’s sexual abuse case at rally\n\nPresident Joe Biden sought to draw policy contrasts Friday night with former president Donald Trump, directly tying him to the conservative policy blueprint known as “Project 2025.”\n\nHe attacked Trump in a number of new ways, including explicitly saying that Trump raped a woman. Biden read from a judge’s ruling against Trump in the defamation case of E. Jean Carol.\n\nAmong his other direct attacks on Trump, Biden called the former president a “loser,” and a “convicted criminal.” He accused Trump of “riding around in his golf cart, filling out a scorecard before he hits the ball,” and said he “filed for bankruptcy 6 times.”\n\n“He even went bankrupt running a casino,” Biden said. “I didn’t think that was possible. Doesn’t the house always win in a casino?”\n\nBiden also pointed out Trump’s own verbal slips – the day after Biden himself called Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky “President Putin” and referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Vice President Trump”\n\n“I guess they don’t remember that Trump called Nikki Haley ‘Nancy Pelosi,’” Biden said.\n\nThe president mostly spoke using a teleprompter but did seem to veer off script at several points in the speech.\n\nWashington Post Editorial Board: \"Biden remains in denial\"\n\nThe editorial board of the Washington Post is calling on President Joe Biden’s allies to have a “candid conversation with him” but is not outright calling on him to leave the race.\n\n“Based on his comments Thursday, Mr. Biden seems to be somewhat oblivious to the political furor surrounding him and in denial about his frailty, personally and politically,” the Post wrote in a Friday opinion piece. “He needs to come to grips with reality,” the headline reads.\n\nThe board ended by calling for those close to the president to speak with him.\n\n“Mr. Biden said on Thursday he’s ‘not in this for my legacy.’ Well and good. What, then, is he in it for? The only right answer is the good of the country. And those with influence and access to the president need to explain forcefully and candidly what that calls for now.”"
