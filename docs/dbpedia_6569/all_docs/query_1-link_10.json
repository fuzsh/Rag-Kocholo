in English: the accent! Americans and Brits have their own proper way to pronounce French words, and most of the time, it doesnât sound French. And I get it, because French pronunciation is no picnic!\n\nIn fact, when I pronounce French words like ârendez-vousâ or âgenreâ with my French accent, my American friends donât understand. So I change my accent to American, and all is well!\n\nWatch this funny video for concrete examples and donât worry, you wonât sound pretentious if you try to have a French accent!\n\nFrench words in British and American English\n\nIf you already know these French words used in everyday English, you can work on your pronunciation to impress your friendsâ¦ or save the day!"
