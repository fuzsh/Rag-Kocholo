        "text": "Submit a portfolio that gives us a sense of you, your interests, and your willingness to experiment, explore, and think beyond technical skills. There is no one “right way” to construct a portfolio—you choose what to present. Visit Portfolio Requirements by Degree Program for more detailed information regarding portfolios.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to meet with us on campus, online, or at one of our events for individualized feedback about your portfolio.\n\nThe portfolio you submit for admission is the one that we will evaluate for merit scholarship.\n\nView our portfolio preparation guide for more information.\n\nGeneral Portfolio Guidelines\n\nShow us 10–15 of your best and most recent works.\n\nUse your portfolio to showcase your interests, skills, and creative potential.\n\nYou may show us work created across media or focus entirely in one medium.\n\nWork can range from observational to abstract.\n\nWe have no media-specific limitations nor do we present portfolio assignments.\n\nAdvice for Developing a Merit Scholarship Portfolio\n\nBe bold, experiment, take risks, and be inventive.\n\nShow us what makes you different, and the things about which you are passionate.\n\nBuild a portfolio of thematic work—show multiple pieces that share similar ideas, techniques, or media.\n\nMesh great ideas—political, environmental, and even social concepts within your work.\n\nThink about your portfolio as a gallery show you are curating.\n\nHighlight work that is consistently expressive, curious, and thought-provoking.\n\nHow to Submit Your Work\n\nUpload your work electronically through SlideRoom, which you will access through SAIC's member screen within the Common Application under the Portfolio section.\n\nGuidelines for Submitting Work\n\nYour statement should tell us about the work in your portfolio. Why did you make it? How did you make it? What inspired you to make it? What does your artistic process look like? Share why you are interested in utilizing certain materials, and in which exhibitions you have participated. How have specific experiences contributed to the making of your work?\n\nWhile there are no word count limitations, we recommend a 250–500 word statement. Construct your essay with care, and pay attention to your grammar and spelling.\n\nIf you are applying to the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Writing, your statement also needs to address how you imagine a studio arts environment will impact your writing practice.\n\nYou may submit your artist's statement via the Common Application (within the member-specific questions), or through your SlideRoom ePortfolio submission.\n\nThe School of the Art Institute of Chicago considers students who have a high school diploma, GED or equivalent for admission.

If you believe your scores provide additional insight into your academic abilities, please feel free to submit them.\n\nInternational students who do not meet the above criteria need to submit a language assessment from any of the following and must meet the designated minimum scores:\n\nTest of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL): minimum 82 Internet Based\n\nTOEFL Essentials: minimum 9\n\nInternational English Language Testing System (IELTS): minimum 6.5\n\nPearson Test of English (PTE Academic): minimum 55\n\nDuolingo: 110\n\n* For the Bachelor of Arts in Art History degree, a 96 TOEFL IBT or equivalent is required.\n\nTest scores may be sent directly to us by selecting our school codes when taking the test.\n\nSAIC's ACT Code: 1136\n\nSAIC's SAT Code: 1713\n\nSAIC's TOEFL Code: 1713\n\nEmail ugadmiss@saic.edu or mail scores to:\n\nSchool of the Art Institute of Chicago\n\nUndergraduate Admissions\n\n36 S.
