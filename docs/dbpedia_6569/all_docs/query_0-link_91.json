        "text": "The Paris Physics Master is a two-year master's program in physics, taught in Paris. It is jointly run by two universities, Sorbonne University and Université de Paris (formerly Université Paris-Diderot). Its first year of study consists of a broad and demanding set of courses in advanced fundamental, experimental, and numerical physics. The second year consists of further courses followed by a master’s thesis on a research topic of the student’s choice. Through regular contact with researchers in theoretical and experimental physics, the master's program seeks to develop the necessary intellectual rigor and practical acumen required for research, and hence prepare the students for a doctoral thesis.\n\nMore information here.\n\nThe Computational Mechanics (CompMech) Master is a two-year program focused on modeling and numerical simulation of fluids and solids. The course covers fundamental and advanced topics on solid and structural mechanics, fluid mechanics, and their interactions. CompMech provides a balanced and thorough coverage of theoretical aspects and modern computational methods for macroscopic modelling, analysis, and design of complex systems including fluids, solids and soft matter. Applications will range from biological and medical engineering to civil and mechanical engineering, passing through nuclear and new energies engineering.\n\nCompMech is run in close collaboration with Italian University La Sapienza (Rome, Italy) and the MOX department of Politecnico di Milano (Milano, Italy). The program provides high-level training on continuum and computational mechanics in an international environment.\n\nThe Master in Computational Mechanics offers three possible pathways, with or without double-degree agreements with the Italian universities:\n\nA local degree\n\nA double degree with La Sapienza - Ingegneria Meccanica (max. 6 places available)\n\nA double degree with PoliMi - Ingegneria Mathematica (max. 2 places available)\n\nUpon completing the Master, graduates will be able to work in English-speaking research and engineering teams at the international level. They will know how to analyze scientific papers in the general field of continuous mechanics, evaluate the relevance of the various approximations needed to solve a problem, and implement efficient numerical discretization and solution techniques using modern open-source software for High Performance Computing. They will learn how to use these skills and more to solve complex problems in fluid and solid mechanics.\n\nMore information: here.\n\nBiotherapy refers to the use of molecules from living organisms to treat diseases by performing procedures such as cell and tissue therapy, gene therapy and therapies using human molecules synthesized by eukaryotic cells or bacteria, like antibodies and bioactive proteins. The field of biotherapy has advanced considerably in recent years thanks to research progress in vectorology, stem cells, biomaterials, omics and computational biology. Future researchers in biotherapy require a strong education in the molecular basis of physio-pathological processes in order to develop new biotherapy strategies. The goal of the international master’s program ‘From Fundamental Molecular Biosciences to Biotherapies’ is to provide outstanding training in fundamental molecular biosciences as applied to biotherapies through a multidisciplinary approach and in collaboration with renowned partner universities.\n\nThe program, taught in English, consists of four semesters (120 ECTS) and offers students the opportunity, in addition to a high-quality education in Molecular Biosciences delivered at Sorbonne Université (Paris), to select a specialization out of various fields of biotherapies in different partner universities:\n\nCancer biology: Heidelberg University (Germany)\n\nImmunology and biotherapies: Charles University (Prague, Czech Republic), Sao Paulo\n\nUniversity (Brasil)\n\nStem Cell, development and evolution: University of Lisbon (Portugal), Heidelberg University (Germany)\n\nBioinformatics for health sciences: Heidelberg University (Germany) and Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona, Spain).\n\nFundamental molecular biosciences in biotherapies: Sorbonne Université (Paris, France)\n\nGraduates of this master’s program will emerge with an important understanding of basic and applied scientific knowledge and excellent professional and personal skills. The specializations available will allow students to obtain multiple high-level qualifications in complementary disciplines and generate career opportunities in academic research, the pharmaceutical industry and biomed, for example.\n\nMore information: here.\n\nThe EIT Digital Master School’s program in Cloud and Network Infrastructure (CNI) enables students to study a first year (known as the ‘entry’ year) and second year (known as the ‘exit’) in two different partner universities.\n\nCNI is a part of the EIT Digital Master School, and provides a comprehensive study of network and cloud computing. Students will learn to master network management, operations and design, as well as cloud service and deployment models, implementation strategies, and application design. The program also focuses on the future directions of cloud computing, for example, in the fields of edge and fog computing as well as block chains and distributed ledger applications. Moreover, a significant part of the course addresses business tools and practices for the creation of products and services. Each partner university involved with CNI offers a different specialization to students in their ‘exit’ year:\n\nMobile Networking and Cloud Services - Aalto (Espoo and Helsinki, Finland)\n\nCloud & Distributed Computing - TUB (Berlin, Germany)\n\nNetworked intelligence - KTH (Stockholm, Sweden)\n\nBeyond 5G - UniTN (Trento, Italy)\n\nSmart Mobility Systems - Sorbonne University (Paris, France)\n\nThe ‘entry’ year at Sorbonne University is made up of foundational courses on computer networks, cloud and entrepreneurship, while its ‘exit’ year provides advanced courses in image analysis, including biomedical imaging and computer graphics. Courses are taught jointly to students in the EIT program and other students from the Master of Computer Science of Sorbonne Université.\n\nStudents undertaking the CNI master’s will acquire theoretical skills as well as the ability to analyze and discuss scientific papers, choose and implement appropriate methods to solve concrete problems related to images, perform oral presentations and write scientific reports. They will also learn to work both independently and in a team, identify and seek appropriate resources for advancing their work, and take initiatives.\n\nMore information: here.\n\nThe Digital International Program (DIGIT) enables outstanding international students to create a custom curriculum that covers the central themes of Sorbonne University’s computer science master’s programs, such as Bioinformatics, Computer Vision, Computer Networks and Security.\n\nEach student enrolled in DIGIT (excluding students enrolled in the specific VCC program or EIT Master School programs) will have the opportunity to build their own curriculum by choosing teaching units consistent among the proposed courses in English or those that are likely to be taught in English. The opportunity to partake in extension projects in the first three semesters of the program may exceptionally allow students to deepen their knowledge in one or more topics in non-English courses, in which case participation will involve reverse learning and learning by example techniques. This forms part of the program’s core challenge of balancing two objectives: educational innovation and internationalization.\n\nMore information: here.\n\nThe Master of Computer Science - Quantum Information (IQ) is a brand new master's program offered at Sorbonne University Paris. Fully dedicated to Quantum Information, this program is supported by the Quantum Information Center Sorbonne (QICS), the Computer Science Master Department, in collaboration with the School of Physics. Experts from LIP6, LKB and INRIA will teach recent research results in quantum algorithmics, quantum cryptography, photonic quantum computing and quantum information theory.\n\nThe program will open in 2021 and will be given in English for an international student body.Graduates will receive a master's degree in Computing Science with a specialization in Quantum Computing for graduate students in computer science with a strong interest in physics.\n\nFind full course information and contact details here.\n\nThe next decade is going to witness a profound transformation in the mobile communication infrastructure. The aim of interconnecting everything everywhere has unleashed new visions such as autonomous vehicles, the factory of the future, and augmented reality. Advanced concepts in electromagnetic wave propagation are the key to design new radio access networks, making ubiquitous connectivity a reality.\n\nWaveWiCom is a one-year master's programme (M2) taught in English to train high-skilled electrical engineers to work in research and innovation for wireless communication systems. It covers advanced topics in computational electromagnetics, antennas and radiofrequency devices, wireless communication technologies, propagation channels, and electromagnetic compatibility. Regular contacts with researchers through personally tailored projects as part of the curriculum will help interested students to pursue a PhD.\n\nFind full course information and contact details here.\n\nHigh Performance Computing plays a major role in scientific research and industrial innovation. The architecture of large scale computers is evolving rapidly, and becoming more and more complex. These computers are formed by heterogeneous units and the number of computing cores exceeds a million. Exascale computing capabilities open new promising perspectives for scientific computing, but they also require new algorithms and a deep understanding of computer architectures, parallel algorithms and programming, and mathematical modelling.\n\nThe availability of HPC experts, such as HPC administrators and architects, HPC proficient data scientists, HPC application developers, and expert users, is a key factor that drives digital transformation in Europe, and requires the training of highly skilled and talented graduate students.\n\nSorbonne University is one of the eight awarding universities of the Pan-European High Performance Computing Pilot Master’s program, EUMaster4HPC.\n\nThis program brings together major players in HPC education in Europe and emphasizes collaboration across Europe with innovative teaching paradigms such as co-teaching and strong connections with industry experts and specialists in HPC education, to develop the most relevant and up-to-date teaching contents. A particular focus on student and staff mobility will enable students to rapidly gain experience through internships and exposure to European supercomputing centers.\n\nThe study program at SU will provide a balanced curriculum between computer science aspects and applied mathematics aspects of HPC. The students will have the opportunity to do an internship in an academic laboratory or an industrial group.\n\nFind full course information and contact detailshere."
