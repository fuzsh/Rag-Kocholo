        "text": "Harris and Trump are set to debate next month. Catch up on what happened today on the campaign trail\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday repeatedly demeaned Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her “barely competent,” and made a string of false and often confusing claims about her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nThe former president took a variety of questions for about an hour at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMeantime, Harris and Walz continued their blitz of battleground states with an event in Detroit this afternoon before heading to Arizona.\n\nHere are the top headlines:\n\nTrump’s news conference: Repeating many of his familiar talking points, Trump criticized Democrats over immigration and the economy. He insisted that his campaign strategy is unchanged now that Harris is his opponent and said he preferred running against her. Asked about his light campaign schedule, Trump dismissed the question as “stupid” before saying that he’s been busy taping commercials, talking on his phone, the radio and on television programs.\n\nHarris and Walz in Michigan: The Democratic ticket rallied union members in a local union hall in Michigan Thursday. Harris and Walz worked to drum up support amongst organized labor and draw a sharp contrast between them and Trump on labor issues. Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers, endorsed Harris last week, but many rank-and-file members may not be sold yet. The Harris campaign later called Trump’s news conference a “public meltdown.”\n\nA debate on the calendar: Harris and Trump are slated to debate on ABC on September 10 after the former president said that he agreed to it, along with two others. He said during his news conference that he wants there to be three debates, but Harris would not answer a question from CNN on whether she would commit to all of them. Earlier this week, Trump said that he would not debate Harris if she did not agree to attend the proposed Fox News debate on September 4.\n\nAd wars heat up: Across the country and a series of key battleground states in particular, ad spending soared to the highest single-week total of the presidential campaign so far last week, seeing a combined total of more than $82 million in presidential advertising. Democrats outspent Republicans during that stretch from July 30 through August 6.\n\nWalz faced accusations in 2006 of embellishing his military service, which he called slander\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, newly selected Democratic vice presidential candidate, is facing scrutiny over his military service record, with critics, including his Republican rival Sen. JD Vance, accusing Walz of falsely suggesting he saw combat during his time as an Army reservist.\n\nIt’s not the first time Walz has encountered such criticism.\n\nA CNN KFile review reveals that similar accusations were made in 2006, during Walz’s first run for Congress. That year, multiple letters to his local paper in Mankato, Minnesota, accused him of making misleading statements about his service, including whether he had served in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz found the accusations serious enough that he personally responded to them both.\n\nAt issue were a selection of political ads and statements on Walz’s website describing his overseas military service. While they described Walz as having served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, they neglected to specify that he did so while serving in Italy, not Afghanistan.\n\nWalz was more specific in other statements and interviews with the media from 2006, in which he did say that, “by luck of the draw,” he was posted to Italy, and not Afghanistan.\n\nRead more about this here and what more about this reporting below:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nc0a59c78-1002-4629-a4f6-6008523306c1.mp4\n\n03:54 - Source: cnn\n\nABC will allow other networks to simulcast September 10 presidential debate\n\nABC News will allow other networks to broadcast its September 10 presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, an ABC spokesperson told CNN on Thursday.\n\nDetails about the debate’s format and rules have yet to be confirmed publicly, but the 90-minute face-off will likely take place in Philadelphia, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nABC News anchors David Muir and Lynsey Davis will moderate the debate, the network previously said.\n\nDuring the first presidential debate of the 2024 season between President Joe Biden and former President Trump, CNN allowed other networks to air the debate but with strict requirements around its promotion and broadcast.\n\nMore than 51 million people watched the debate in June across 22 networks.\n\nTrump downplays abortion as election issue\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he believes abortion “has become much less of an issue” ahead of the November election.\n\n“I think it’s actually going to be a very small issue,” Trump said.\n\nTrump repeated that he believes in abortion exceptions for instances of rape, incest and the life of the mother.\n\n“I believe strongly,” he said Thursday in Palm Beach, Florida, at a news conference. “I think that that’s a very important thing.”\n\nVance is \"doing a fantastic job,\" Trump says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump praised his vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, while addressing media Thursday from Florida.\n\nVance mirrored the Democratic ticket’s schedule this week in battleground states, and held an event in Wisconsin on Wednesday, where he reopened a line of attack into Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota’s military record.\n\nNOW: Trump addresses the media\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is now speaking after he said this morning that he would hold a news conference at Mar-a-Lago this afternoon.\n\nTrump has looked to respond to the sudden change in his opponent after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race last month and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nCampaigns spent more than $82 million on presidential advertising last week\n\nWhile the spotlight has been on both parties’ vice presidential nominees in recent weeks, it’s the top of the ticket that has remained in focus on the airwaves as presidential ad wars continue to escalate.\n\nAcross the country and a series of key battleground states in particular, ad spending soared to the highest single-week total of the presidential campaign so far last week, seeing a combined total of more than $82 million in presidential advertising. Democrats outspent Republicans during that stretch from July 30 through August 6 by about $50 million to $32.6 million.\n\nSince President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and its allies have launched a mix of ads, both promoting her record and biography and attacking former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Trump campaign and its allies, meanwhile, have poured millions into amplifying concerns about immigration and crime, assigning equal blame to Biden and Harris.\n\nThese are the states that saw the most presidential ad spending last week, according to AdImpact data:\n\nPennsylvania: $24,877,707\n\nMichigan: $13,020,410\n\nGeorgia: $10,922,648\n\nWisconsin: $9,488,567\n\nArizona: $7,286,918\n\nNorth Carolina: $3,864,215\n\nNevada: $2,628,978\n\nTrump says he'll hold a news conference this afternoon\n\nFormer President Donald Trump announced he will hold a news conference at Mar-a-Lago at 2 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\n“I will be doing a General News Conference at 2:00 P.M. at Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach. Thank you!” Trump posted on Truth Social."
