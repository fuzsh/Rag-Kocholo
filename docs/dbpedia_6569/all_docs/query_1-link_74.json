        "text": "System requirements\n\nThese are the minimum system requirements for installing Windows 11 on a PC. If your device does not meet these requirements, you may not be able to install Windows 11 on your device and might want to consider purchasing a new PC. If you are unsure whether your PC meets these requirements, you can check with your PC Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or, if your device is already running Windows 10, you can use the PC Health Check app to assess compatibility. Note that this app does not check for graphics card or display, as most compatible devices will meet those requirements listed below.\n\nYour device must be running Windows 10, version 2004 or later, to upgrade. Free updates are available through Windows Update in Settings>Update and Security.\n\nEnsuring that your device is kept up to date is important for your device security and functionality. With an internet connection, Windows 11 will periodically check for updates so you donâ€™t have to (ISP fees might apply). You can check to see if there are any pending or optional updates available for your device by going to Settings | Update & Security | Windows Update.\n\nIt is important to ensure you have enough free storage space to install updates and you may need to check to see if your hardware is still supported by your Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).\n\nVisit the Lifecycle FAQ for Windows products\n\nMore information on storage space requirements to keep Windows 11 up-to-date\n\nThe size of the Windows operating system that comes with your device and the amount of free storage space needed to download and install Windows updates are highly variable as they depend on a variety of factors. Visit here to learn why. The factors that impact the amount of free space needed to take an update include: the versions of Windows previously installed on the machine; the amount of free storage space available from Windows files to reuse, such as the virtual memory pagefile or hibernation file; which applications are installed on your device; and how those applications store data. When updating, Windows will attempt to free up enough space automatically and to guide you through freeing up even more if the automatic cleanup is not sufficient. You can also take steps on your own to free up space."
