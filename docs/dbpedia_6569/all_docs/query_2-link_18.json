One of the characters repeatedly, at different points in the story, used the phrase \"now you're giving me the high hat.\" Not being familiar with the expression, I took from it that the guy felt snubbed. Anyone have some light on this? Thanks. - Patty\n\nhigh-hat\n\nVERB: Informal. To treat in a superciliously indulgent manner: condescend, patronize. Idioms: speak (or talk) down to. See ATTITUDE, OVER, RESPECT, RISE.\n\nADJECTIVE: Informal. Characteristic of or resembling a snob: elitist, snobbish, snobby. Informal : snooty, stuck-up, uppish, uppity."
