        "text": "Clawdeen Lucia Wolf is a 2010-introduced and all-around character. She is a Werewolf, who is a student at Monster High and who comes from a family with many children—among which Clawdia, Clawd, and Howleen. She is a talented fashion designer, who's ready to make her name with an impressive portfolio, worthwhile connections, and even a fashion show in Scaris on her name. When she's not deciding next season's look, Clawdeen's either with her family or her friends. She looks out for Howleen, with whom she shares a room, but with whom she does not always get along well. Her BFF, Draculaura, is her brother's girlfriend—a fact she had to learn the hard way that it would not take either away from her. Her other friends can be largely divided between her colleagues of the Fear Squad and her fashion pals, all of whom consider her to have a warm and generous heart to have faith in even when times get rough.\n\nCharacter[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nClawdeen has a Brooklyn accent. Her middle name is Lucia. In the books, her human identity nickname is the human spelling Claudine, without Wolf's family name at the end.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nClawdeen is confident, energetic, and fierce. According to a diary entry by Ghoulia Yelps, she goes a bit \"freaky\" when in the presence of the full moon, (or something resembling it, such as a spotlight [2]) but often ends up using this to her advantage. [3] She's also fiercely loyal and protective of her friends and family, but can be quick to anger when her loyalty feels threatened. Coming from a big family, she's mostly had to fend for herself, which has created a streak of resourcefulness in her, some examples being not above taking hand-me-downs despite being a self-proclaimed \"fashionista\", and even running a DIY craft video blog. She also is the founder of the Monster High Shoe Swap. [4]\n\nLike most of the Wolf family, Clawdeen is a talented sportswoman whose skills are put to use in three sports: soccer, track and field, [4]and baseball. In the books, she has a DIY web show named When There's a Wolf, There's a Way.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nClawdeen is a tall, slim, caramel-furred teenage werewolf with golden-yellow eyes, thick eyelashes and wavy, waist-length brown hair with coral-brown streaks, although she often changes both the colors and style of her hair since she likes experimenting as her hair grows back rather fast (she mentions in her profile that shaving and waxing is a daily routine). As per her type of monster, she possesses sharp fangs protruding out of her mouth, and triangle-shaped ears which are adorned two golden hoop-earrings each. Clawdeen also wears makeup which consists of thick mascara, two-tone purple eyeshadow, viva-magenta lipstick, and magenta nail polish painted on her claw-like fingers, as well as her toenails.\n\nClawdeen's attire consists of two necklaces; a golden-beaded necklace with a purple jewel as the pendant hanging from her neck, and a thick black choker with golden studs around her neck. She wears a black crop-top jacket with both purple accents and purple trim, followed by golden studding on the zipper lines and pale-lavender fur trim on the collar. Her jacket is usually worn over her sparkly-pink cropped tank top which has a pattern of black tiger stripes printed all over it. Around her waist is a belt which is designed to resemble her accessorized choker, holding her dark purple miniskirt with fishnet-mesh trimming on the bottom. Clawdeen also wore a set of over-the-knee, sparkly-light coral toeless stockings which are worn under her black calf-length, open-heeled and open-toed zip-up wedge boots which includes both purple accents and several purple belt straps with golden-beaded buckles, followed by purplish-gray soles.\n\nClawdeen's Student Files[]\n\nThe following thoughts on Clawdeen Wolf come from Headless Headmistress Bloodgood. These can be found at the back of the dolls' Back to School boxes.\n\nParental Participation[]\n\nOutstanding considering the responsibilities inherent in caring for such a large pack (family). While they are unable to volunteer for every event at MH, they are solely responsible for the annual barbecue fundraiser for our athletic teams. It is always a screaming success.\n\nAcademic Standing[]\n\nClawdeen excels in subjects she believes will further her ultimate goal of creating a fashion empire. Unfortunately, any subject that falls outside of that goal stands less than a ghost of a chance at getting one hundred effort from her. We are currently working to correct this.\n\nSocial Interaction[]\n\nDespite Clawdeen's independent streak, she is no lone wolf and her peer pack at MH is reflective of the new spirit exhibited by this younger generation of monsters. They respect the tradition of their parents but which kind of monster they haunt out with is their own decision.\n\nOverall[]\n\nI believe that Clawdeen Wolf's fierce determination and focus will one day make her very successful. She is the personification of a teenage monster from a teenage monster who wants to stand out from the pack and be recognized as her own person.\n\nFacebook Description[]\n\nClawdeen is furrrocious! As the fifteen-year-old daughter of The Werewolf, she comes from a huge family and needs to have her own style to stand out. She's a fierce monster monsterista, immortalized in the Monster High halls for her intense eyes and prominent canines. Plus she has tons of hair that she always styles in furrrociously unique ways (all the ghouls want to copy her freaky fab style). I'm pretty sure she could win America's Top Monster. She loves to tear up the soccer field, and just might make team captain if she put her claws to it. Crescent, her pet kitten, is scary-cute (and has the softest, fuzzy fur ever)!\n\nAbillities[]\n\nEnhanced Smelling: She has a strong sense of smell just like a regular wolf, as well as other canine beings. Because of this she can easily detect scents from far away and recognize them.\n\nEnhanced Hearing: Clawdeen and all werewolves can have a superb sense of hearing.\n\nLunar Empowerment: Unlike other werebeasts, Clawdeen along with other werewolves, can get her full monster powers from the full moon. This is shown in 'Fur Will Fly', 'Scaris: City of Frights' and other occasion. She is however, unlike traditional werebeasts, restricted from transforming or have a human form, as in Monster High, and even in regular 2010 franchise Monster High, werewolves always have the same appearance up until Welcome to Monster High.\n\nEnhanced Strength: Clawdeen is shown to be very strong naturally, but her strength seems to be exceptionally enhanced by the full moon.\n\nEnhanced Speed: This is much noted in \"Fur Will Fly\", as Clawdeen can be super fast, but mostly from lunar influence.\n\nRapid Hair Growth: This is mostly said in the Monster High book series and in Clawdeen's profile bio under \"Freaky Flaw\". Like all werewolves, Clawdeen can grow her hair super rapidly as well as having many different hair lengths, as long as it grows back quickly, which it always does. This also gives her the need for constant leg shaving and waxing, though her body is all hairy.\n\nPolymorphism: Since the 2016 reboot started by Welcome to Monster High, she can switch between full-fledged wolf and werebeast as shapeshifting.\n\nAthleticism: She is extremely athletic, and takes on the full power of athleticism, increased by lunar empowerment, and when enhanced by the full moon, can run super fast, according to \"Fur Will Fly\" against Heath Burns.\n\nSkillset[]\n\nDesign: Clawdeen is a novice designer with a lot of talent and an eye for aesthetics. She's been recognized by several fashion icons and media, this being said to be due to the wit and originality of her clothing designs, which usually take into consideration the type of monster it is being designed for and how it suits them, rather then following traditional conventions.\n\nDancing: Clawdeen is also a great dancer, putting her in the Fear Squad.\n\nWeaknesses[]\n\nSilver: Clawdeen rarely reacts to the sight of silver, unlike other werewolves in most fiction, she does, however on numerous occasions, albeit in different scenarios.\n\nSensory Overload: Despite her sensory, some sensory information is enough to overwhelm Clawdeen. Loud noises easily deafen the werebeasts.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nClawdeen lives with her big family in a not so big house and it always seems like there is some kind of drama going on over there. The way they argue, you'd think they don't like each other, but you'd be wrong. They watch out for each other and if you fight one of them, you better be ready to take them all. [5]. Her known siblings are Clawdia, Clawd, and Howleen. Clawdeen mentions she has a great-great-great-grandwolf named Harriet. [6]\n\nIn the Monster High books, her parents own a bed & breakfast while managing seven children of which two girls and five boys. [7]Clawd (Claude) is Clawdeen's only older brother. Then there's Howlmilton (Rocks), followed by a set of triplets consisting of Howldon (Don), Howlston (Howie), and Clawdeen's only sister Howleen (Leena). Finally, the youngest sibling, at the tender age of 13, is Clawnor (Nino). Their mother is named Harriet and their father Clawrk (Clark).\n\nThere are various reasons why the siblings were given their human identity names or nicknames. The brother Howlmilton was given the name \"Rocks\" due to his \"dumb as rocks\" comments. The book describes Rocks as being both the fastest in the family, literal-wise, but also the slowest, which means intelligence wise. The book described Rocks as being only able to stay on the track team if he got straight Ds, which he always did. The youngest of the siblings Nino, or Clawnor, was described as having his nickname Nino due to the climatic phenomenon as he was as fierce as the tides in the ocean, or as the narration's words, tended to be \"windy\". Nino was also said to be very fond of his \"big-boy fur\" and not wanting it to have cosmetics put back in it to have \"him [Nino] scared back to baldness\". There was a set of triplets, Howldon nicknamed Don, Howlston nicknamed Howie, and the youngest triplet being the only other sister, Howleen nicknamed Leena. Howleen was said to go to camp for drill sergeant drills and to help with anger issues, whose name was described by the narration as having a rhyming with being simple to that of the name \"mean\" for a reason.\n\nYet in several occasion it's implied or mentioned she has even more than 7 siblings: for example Draculaura mocks Clawdeen in \"Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?\" by stating that she has at least 10 brothers (meaning 5 more than the books). In Clawd's Figurine Collection Diary Entries he also says they have older brothers who were in high school when he was twelve (and Clawdeen ten or eleven), thogether with a picture where two of said brothers (and the silhouette of a third) are playing football with him.\n\nFriends[]\n\nClawdeen is BFFs with Draculaura and Frankie Stein. She's also friends with Lagoona Blue, Abbey Bominable and Ghoulia Yelps. She started out as a rival of sorts to Cleo de Nile, but the two later settled their differences and befriended each other. Clawdeen nearly betrayed her friendship with Draculaura with her jealousy towards the latter's relationship with her brother Clawd, but her touching apology changed her and give her a new perspective on life.\n\nPet[]\n\nClawdeen's pet is a female kitten named Crescent that's described as having amazingly spooky soft purple fur and said in her information \"a scary cute little kitten as fuzzy as I am,\" but in Crescent's profile, she claims that Clawdeen's \"almost\" as fuzzy as she is.\n\nRomance[]\n\nClawdeen's romantic encounters have varied according to media. Clawdeen's profile says her favorite activity is flirting with boys. She danced with a cat boy [8] and with Romulus[9]. In the anime episode Clawdeen's Love Clawdeen falls in love with a human boy and has fantasies of the dream date she wants to have with him. At one point,Draculaura attempts to set Clawdeen up with her cousin, Thad, which Clawdeen avoids due to the fear of dating. However, during the Halloween dance she finally meets Thad and finds him very attractive, so she decides to take a risk and ask him to dance.[10]\n\nShe’s one of the many girls that glanced at Archer as he walks by. [11]\n\nTimeline[]\n\nOctober 23, 2007: Mattel requests the trademark for Howleen Wolf, which was originally to be Clawdeen's name.\n\nJuly 11, 2008: Mattel requests the trademark for Clawdeen Wolf.\n\nMay 05, 2010: The Monster High website goes live, featuring Clawdeen Wolf's profile.\n\nMay 05, 2010: Clawdeen Wolf's profile art is revealed.\n\nMay 05, 2010: Clawdeen Wolf makes her animated debut in the Higher Deaducation commercial.\n\nMay 05, 2010: Clawdeen Wolf makes her 2D cartoon debut in \"Jaundice Brothers\".\n\nEarly July, 2010: Clawdeen Wolf's debut doll is released as part of the 'Basic' series.\n\nEarly July, 2010: Clawdeen Wolf makes her diary debut in her 'Basic' diary.\n\nEarly July, 2010: Clawdeen Wolf's debut plushie is released as part of the Friends series.\n\nSeptember 01, 2010: Clawdeen Wolf makes her Monster High book debut in Monster High.\n\nFebruary 12, 2012: Clawdeen Wolf makes her 3D cartoon debut in \"Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?\".\n\nSeptember 05, 2012: Clawdeen Wolf makes her Ghoulfriends book debut in Ghoulfriends Forever.\n\nOctober 22, 2014: Clawdeen Wolf makes her anime debut in \"Monster High Life Is Amazing!\".\n\nNotes[]\n\nIn the Higher Deaducation advert, Clawdeen was mentioned as the head of the 'Moonlight Dance Committee'.\n\nIn the Monster High books, her birthday is October 30th, the day before Halloween.
