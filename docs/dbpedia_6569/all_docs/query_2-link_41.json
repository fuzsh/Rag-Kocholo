        "text": "Quote from Wikipediahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Singer\n\nProduction company\n\nHis production company, Bad Hat Harry Productions, produces House and works in television, film, and video game media. It is named after a line from Jaws, one of his favorite films. The line, \"That's some bad hat, Harry\", is heard over the company's end credit animation.\n\nI was not aware of the Jaws connection. Has the phrase develpoded into some sort of greeting popular among people ( of some age group ?), establishing some code phrase in the States? Something like verbal high five? Americans friends about my age were not sure bidule17\n\nMore like Ce chapeau est assez merdique, Harry! ... or vilain maybe??? Something like 'crap,' 'lousy' anyway.\n\n\"Some\" is used in the sense \"quite the.\" That's some crap hat! That's quite the crap hat!\n\nI'm sure it has nothing to do with \"bad hat\" meaning trouble-maker, which I assume is strictly BE because I know I've never heard it before."
