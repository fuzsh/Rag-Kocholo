        "text": "Almost two decades after it was first announced, the film adaptation of Scott Westerfeld’s UGLIES is finally on the horizon, courtesy of Netflix.\n\nBased on the best-selling 2005 YA sci-fi novel of the same name, UGLIES is poised to be one of the streamer's next big IPs. The original book spawned three sequels (Pretties, Specials, and Extras) as well as four spinoff novels in the same universe (Impostors, Shatter City, Mirror's Edge, and Youngbloods).\n\nWhile fans of the original saga are certainly expecting the story to continue on screen beyond UGLIES, for now, all eyes are on the first installment of the long-anticipated adaption, which Joey King stars in and executive produces alongside the saga's original author Scott Westerfeld.\n\nAs the premiere inches closer, we've compiled everything you need to know about Netflix's UGLIES, including updates on its trailer, casting, and release date. Keep reading for it all, or jump to your preferred section using the arrows below.\n\n→ Plot\n\n→ Cast\n\n→ Trailer\n\n→ Release date\n\n→ First-look pictures\n\nWhat is Netflix's UGLIES about?\n\nBased on the novel of the same name by Scott Westerfeld, UGLIES takes place 300 years into the future in a post-apocalyptic dystopian society where teenagers undergo government-mandated cosmetic surgery to turn them into “Pretties” when they reach their sixteenth birthday, which allows them to move to New Pretty Town.\n\nUGLIES centers on protagonist Tally Youngblood, a 16-year-old residing in Uglyville who's always dreamed of becoming a Pretty until she links up with a new friend, Shay, who plans to run away to a rebel settlement known as the Smoke.\n\n“In a futuristic world that imposes a cosmetic surgery at 16, Tally is eager for her turn to join the rest of society. But when a friend runs away, Tally embarks on a journey to save her that upends everything she thought she wanted,\" Netflix's logline for UGLIES reads.\n\nMcG — known for his work on Charlie's Angels, The O.C., The Babysitter, and more — serves as director, producer, and co-writer for UGLIES, with Jacob Forman, Vanessa Taylor, and Whit Anderson also credited for the script.\n\n“I'm absolutely thrilled to share UGLIES with the world,” McG told Teen Vogue exclusively. “I feel like the message of the film is timelier than ever. With our contemporary society so obsessed with image, what a great message this movie shares that beauty is interior, and it's who we are on the inside that counts. All in a film packed with action, romance, and adventure.”\n\nWho is in the cast of Netflix's UGLIES?\n\nWhile Joey King's involvement in the film was announced in 2020, the rest of the UGLIES cast was unveiled back in 2021, when most of the shooting took place. Learn more about the actors and their characters below:\n\nJoey King as Tally Youngblood\n\nTeen Vogue New Hollywood alumn Keith Powers plays David in UGLIES. David is one of the founders of the Smoke and a love interest of Tally.\n\nSpeaking to Teen Vogue earlier this year, Powers revealed he was so good as David that the film's creative team asked him to come back for “one more round of reshoots” to add more of his scenes to the final cut. “It was super dope to hear that, and flattering, because shooting it was tough,\" he said at the time. Powers also revealed he's excited for UGLIES to become the new big YA IP. “Our YA [growing up] was Twilight and Hunger Games. We were spoiled, we got heat. That's what we want UGLIES to be. We want UGLIES to be that next thing,” he said.\n\nLaverne Cox as Dr. Cable\n\nJudging by the trailer, Laverne Cox appears to play a version of Dr. Cable, the main antagonist in the series, who keeps control of the Pretty Operation.\n\nApart from these characters, UGLIES will also feature Charmin Lee, Jan Luis Castellanos, Joseph Echavarria, and Zamani Wilder as Smokies Maddy, Croy, Ryde, and Astrix, respectively, as well as Robert Palmer Watkins and Jillian Murray as Sol and Ellie Youngblood, Tally's parents.\n\nIs there a trailer for Netflix's UGLIES?\n\nYes! Netflix put out the official trailer for UGLIES on August 8, 2024. In the trailer, we see Joey King's Tally grappling with the realities of the Pretty surgery. “All my life, I wanted to be pretty,” Tally narrates in the trailer as flashes of Uglyville and New Pretty Town alternate on the screen. “I thought it would change everything. I hope that's still true.”\n\nIn the next few clips, we get a peek at Tally and Peris's relationship as he prepares for his sixteenth birthday and surgery. “Will you promise me something? No matter how pretty they make you, just don't let them erase you,” Tally tells Peris as they say their goodbyes. We then see Shay telling Tally the surgery is more invasive than it appears before cutting to Pretty Peris bumping into Tally at a party. “Things are just different here,” he tells Tally, referring to New Pretty Town. “You'll get it… when you're Pretty.”\n\nIn the next clips, we get introduced to the Smoke and David. We even get a little peek at hoverboards in action, which fans of the original book series will surely recognize, and Tally and David's fiery kiss. But, of course, life's not as easy as it seems. You can watch the trailer below:\n\nAfter literal years of waiting, UGLIES will premiere on Netflix on September 13, 2024.\n\nAre there any first-look photos for Netflix's UGLIES?\n\nThere are indeed. Teen Vogue got the exclusive first-look photos from UGLIES on August 7, 2024. In the first three ever pictures released from the film, which you can also see below, we see Tally and Peris pre-surgery and Tally joining the Smoke."
