        "text": "The English speaking countries in the Caribbean are some of the most popular among family travelers. Perhaps it’s because they offer a tropical getaway without langugage barriers, which certainly makes traveling with kids easier. Or maybe it’s just because some of these islands have the clearest water, the loveliest hotels, and unique cultures to experience.\n\nWhatever your reason for contemplating a trip to the English-speaking Caribbean islands, the great news is: There are lots to choose from!\n\nIn this post, we highlight the 18 English-speaking destinations in the Caribbean region. For each, we share a few nuggets about the language you’re likely to hear, the reasons to consider the destination for a family vacation, and the best places to stay with kids. We also point you to other resources for mapping out your family trip to their sandy shores.\n\nHappy travel planning!\n\nHow Many Countries in the Caribbean Speak English?\n\nLet’s start with the basics: How many countries in the Caribbean speak English?\n\nThere are six official languages in the Caribbean, English a main one. English is the official language of 11 independent countries in the Caribbean community. Starting at the top and moving south: Bahamas, Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, Barbados, St. Lucia, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Belize.\n\nWhat’s more, there are 6 British Overseas Territories located in the Caribbean Sea: Turks and Caicos, the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Bermuda, and Montserrat. Add one U.S. territory, the U.S. Virgin islands, for the cherry on top.\n\nIt’s worth noting at the outset, however, that, even in islands where English is not the official language, it’s widely spoken in the Caribbean due to tourism demands. If there’s another island on your radar in the French Caribbean, the Spanish speaking islands, or elsewhere, don’t let language scare you away from your tropical destination of choice!\n\n1. Grenada\n\nWe can’t help but start with a personal favorite: Grenada, the former British colony in the West Indies that sparked our passion for Caribbean travel. Mountains plunge to sandy coastlines, with smells of fresh cinnamon and nutmeg sticking with you long after you’ve left.\n\nGrenada is one of the best English-speaking islands to head for a family vacation, especially if you’re looking to really connect with Caribbean culture.\n\nWhile English is the national language and most Grenadians speak it, you’ll generally hear them speaking creole among themselves. Grenada Creole is marked by unique idioms that locals will be more than happy to teach you. We especially warmed to the notion of “having a lime” or “liming around” – meaning, to relax. That’s exactly what you’ll do in Grenada.\n\nMake Grand Anse Beach your home base for calm swimming and a spread of beachfront eateries. Rent a car and explore Grenada’s rugged interior and rainforests, taking frequent breaks at the beautiful beaches. Check out our comprehensive Grenada family guide for all the details.\n\nWhen it comes to driving around Grenada, though, be aware: Here, as in many other former British colonies on this list, you’ll be driving on the left side of the road.\n\n2. Barbados\n\nBarbados is the place to look for a classic Caribbean vacation with a sophisticated edge. This former English colony offers up an array of attractions, activities, and sights that are sure to make your trip unforgettable. The island’s west coast, facing the Caribbean Sea, is renowned for its beautiful beaches that offer wonderful opportunities for swimming, snorkeling, or simply basking in the sunshine.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given its colonial past, the English of Barbados is closer to British English than American English. But residents generally speak ‘Bajan’ (pronounced “bay-jun”), an English-based creole influenced by West African languages. Of all the Caribbean creole dialects, of which there are many, Bajan is the closest to English.\n\nYou might even manage to communicate in Bajan yourself; let’s get you started:\n\nWa gine on?– what’s going on?\n\nFuzz-out – to feel tired (such as, after exploring)\n\nGovernment juice– water\n\nHobby class– something free of charge\n\nCheese on bread– to exclaim amazement\n\nWhere to stay in Barbados with kids\n\nBarbados gets lots of British visitors and has a relatively well-developed tourism infrastructure. With dozens of resorts, there’s something for all budgets here.\n\nOur full recommendations are coming soon, but in the meantime we’ve got our eyes on the following hotels:\n\nFor a luxury stay, start your search with Cobbler’s Cove or Coral Reef Club.\n\nFor spacious suites in a charming boutique hotel a little off the beaten path, with great beachfront snorkeling and a top Barbados restaurant on site, Little Good Harbour has caught our eye.\n\nFor families on a budget, the mid-range, family-focused Bougainvillea Barbados is a solid choice.\n\n3. Bahamas\n\nOnly 50 miles south of the Floridian coast, the islands of the Bahamas are not technically in the Caribbean Sea. But the island country is part of CARICOM, the Caribbean community. It’s a top contender for an English-speaking tropical destination for families.\n\nPink beaches, swimming pigs, and a history of the real Pirates of the Caribbean await you in the Bahamas! The more than 700 islands have something for everyone. The real challenge is figuring out which of the islands in the Bahamas is the one for you, and where to stay once you get there.\n\nAlthough English is the official tongue in the Bahamas, most locals default to their Bahamian dialect. Around a quarter of the population speak Haitian creole, which sounds similar to the creole spoken in the French islands.\n\nA couple of words and phrases you can expect to hear or even use yourself include:\n\nWell Mudda Sick– used to exclaim surprise or excitement\n\nSip sip– gossip\n\nSwitcha– lemonade\n\nJitney– bus\n\nWhat da wybe is? – a greeting akin to ‘what’s up?’\n\nWhere to Stay in the Bahamas with kids\n\nHead to our Bahamas guide to learn more the best Islands in the Bahamas for families, and our detailed recommendations for where to stay.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\nIn Nassau, we recommend the unique and unpredictable Island House for a calm and luxurious family stay.\n\nTo experience the pink sands of Harbour Island near North Eleuthera, learn why we recommend the Dunmore Hotel and Coral Sands Hotel.\n\nFor a true escape, head to the Out Islands of Andros or Exuma. Read more about why we think families will love the private-island luxury resort, Kamalame Cay, or the more rustic, eco-dive resort, Small Hope Bay Lodge, both in Noth Andros. Or check out our recommendations for the best family-friendly hotels in Exuma, which offer a truly laid-back experience.\n\nA one-hour flight from Nassau, Long Island has an incredible boutique resort that checks off all the family vacation boxes: Cape Santa Maria Beach Resort. One look at the photos of the beach, and you’ll be packing your bags.\n\n4. Dominica\n\nNot to be confused with the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic, Dominica is sandwiched between the French speaking islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. But English is the official language here, with roots tracing back to a small British colony on the island.\n\nKnown as the “nature island,” Dominica has wild topography with a mountainous core drenched in tropical rainforest. Head to the Dominican Republic for traditional beach resorts, and to Dominica to experience natural hot springs, endless hiking trails, and plunging coastal cliffs. It’s a wonderful destination for older kids who’ll be happy to explore the hiking trails.\n\nDominican creole (Antillean Creole), which you’ll hear around the island, has its roots in the French language, so you’ll see some similarities. You can start with these basic greetings:\n\nBonjou– good day\n\nBonn apwémidi – good afternoon\n\nBon swé good– good night\n\nNon mwen sé… – my name is…\n\nSa ki non’w? – what is your name?\n\n5. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nHead to the southeast Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles—near the southern tip of the Caribbean island arch—and you’ll find the English-speaking island chain of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. These islands have been a haven for yachters and cruisers for years, but if you can brave the journey to get there, offer paradise to families as well, with secluded beaches, chill vibes, and simply stunning scenery.\n\nWhile English is the de facto spoken and written language in this collection of 32 islands, you’ll hear locals across the archipelago speaking Vincentian Creole. English-based, this creole contains elements of French, Spanish, and Portuguese.\n\nListen out and you’ll note that words ending in “-own” are replaced with “-ung.” For example, “downtown” becomes “down-tung.” Harder consonants at the end of phrases are softened or dropped entirely, with “ask” pronounced “aks” or “desk” becoming “dess.” However, you can expect Vincentians to chat with you in standardized English.\n\n6. Jamaica\n\nJamaica is one of the bigger Caribbean islands, with a robust culture to explore, and lots of delicious rum to drink! You could take several different family trips here and only scratch the surface of what Jamaica has to offer.\n\nAs with other former British colonies, you’ll be driving on the left-hand side of the road if you explore beyond the resorts—but we highly encourage you to do so. Many tourists take advantage of the island’s all-inclusive resorts, which make it tempting to stay put. But the people of Jamaica, not to mention the lush interior landscape and miles of shoreline, are worth getting to know.\n\nEnglish claims the national language of Jamaica, but most Jamaicans grow up speaking Jamaican Patois (Jamaican Creole) with their families before studying English at school. Extremely lyrical with a staccato rhythm, this English-based Creole dialect seeds from West African languages. As with Barbados, Jamaica uses British spellings, although many phrases and idioms from the US have been adopted.\n\nWhere to stay in Jamaica with kids\n\nAs one of the larger English-speaking countries in the Caribbean, Jamaica has a wide range of accommodation options and activities for toddlers through to teens.\n\nLooking for an easy all-inclusive resort to visit, with a kids club and all the bells and whistles? Jamaica’s Montego Bay has endless options, but we’re partial to the lively urban vibe of S Hotel Jamaica and the boutique luxury of Round Hill Resort. Many families also enjoy the Hilton Rose Hall and Half Moon Resort.\n\nWant to venture a little further? Try the infamous seven-mile beach in Negril, where the chic but affordable beach club Skylark Negril provides a comfortable home base.\n\nBe inspired to create at GoldenEye Resort in Ocho Rios. Or head to the award-winning Jake’s Treasure Beach to see Jamaica’s undiscovered south coast.\n\nThe place we’re most excited to visit next with our kiddos? The somewhat lesser-frequented area of Port Antonio, with the infamous blue lagoon (yes the one from the movie), has caught our eye. We’d love to stay at in one of the cottages at Geejam Hotel.\n\n7. Antigua and Barbuda\n\nLocated in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea, Antigua and Barbuda has a storied naval history. Antigua is a treasure map of bays and hidden coves, and one such bay housed a significant British naval dockyard. Today, you can find yachts and catamarans in Nelson’s Dockyard in English Harbour, floating alongside historic sites and delightful views.\n\nAntigua is a great place to visit for families who like a small all-inclusive hotel, and dream of a kids’ club, but who also are eager to leave the resort to explore.\n\nThe island is safe and the driving easy, and there are literally hundreds of beaches to see.\n\nWhere to Stay in Antigua with kids\n\nAntigua is known for having 365 beaches and sometimes it feels like the island hosts just as many hotels. Making a choice can be completely overwhelming. There are our top recommendations for a trip to Antigua with kids.\n\nCheck out our full profile of Curtain Bluff, a truly sppecial, luxurious all-inclusive resort, with an outdoor kids’ club, two beaches, a playground, lawn games, and impressive attention to detail, this is our top choice for a high-end stay.\n\nFor something completely different, consider Admirals Inn & Gunpowder Suites. This tiny boutique hotel right in the historic naval yard has a small but stunning hillside infinity pool, and access to a kid-friendly beach via a short ferry ride. A great homebase for an exploratory trip. We highly recommend the Deluxe Gunpowder Suites for families.\n\n8. Saint Kitts and Nevis\n\nAnother dual island nation with English as the official tongue, Saint Kitts and Nevis are often deemed hidden gems of the Caribbean. There are fewer direct flights here than to many other islands in the region, which keep the small islands from getting overdeveloped.\n\nSaint Kitts tends to get more traffic from adult travelers than families. But there’s plenty to do here for kids, including a unique scenic train ride, a fort full of maxes to explore, horseback riding, ziplining, and more.\n\nAs with just about every destination on this list, you’ll certainly hear the local creole during your stay. A few phrases to look for? Speakers of Saint Kitts Creole often end their sentences with the words “burdee”, “poopa” or “daady buh” to add varying levels of emphasis, so keep an ear out for these idioms. The word “dem” is often added to the end of words to pluralize a noun.\n\nWhere to Stay in Saint Kitts and Nevis with kids\n\nOur complete recommendations for Saint Kitts are coming soon. But in the meantime, here’s where to start your search for the best kid-friendly hotel.\n\nFor a luxury stay, choose between the Park Hyatt Saint Kitts and the Four Seasons Nevis. Both have kids’ clubs that accept little ones from age 3, multiple pools, and all the bells and whistles.\n\nWe’re most intrigued by the completely unique experience that appears to await travelers at Belle Mont Farm on Kittian Hill. This low-key luxury resort with less than 100 cottages sits on a 400-acre working, sustainable farm, which helps to fuel the resort’s farm to table restaurants.\n\n9. Saint Lucia\n\nFor years, the British and French fought for control of Saint Lucia. Visitors can easily see the impact both countries had on this spectacular island nation, which is home to some of the most dramatic scenery in all the Caribbean. Although English is the official language of Saint Lucia, 90% of the population speaks in Saint Lucian French Creole (Kwéyòl). Most of the towns, beaches, and hiking trails continue to use their French names from when the country was colonized.\n\nEnglish speakers will have no trouble communicating with Saint Lucians. Everyone speaks English, albeit sometimes with an accent that differs from American and British English. If you catch a group of St. Lucians gossiping, you might hear someone exclaim “sa chaud” which means the tale is interesting (or, hot gossip).\n\nThough long associated with honeymooners, Saint Lucia is a wonderful choice for a vacation with kids. In the northern segment of the island, many beachfront resorts feature family pools and kid-friendly restaurants. And in the south, the Pitons will provide hours of entertainment for active, older kids.\n\nWhere to stay in Saint Lucia with kids\n\nThe Landings is the ultimate low-key family resort, with a kids’ club and space for everyone. It’s part of a residential yacht community, and has one-, two-, and three-bedroom beachfront suites for families with kitchens and laundry.\n\nFor ultimate luxury at a more traditional resort, look no further than Sugar Beach, a Viceroy Resort. Located right between the Pitons, the scenery here is unlike any other. With a kids club and all the other amenities you need, it’ll be very hard to leave.\n\nIf you prefer boutique hotels, we’ve also had our eye on Cap Maison for years, which sits at the island’s northernmost point. It’s a true luxury boutique, set up on a hill, with classically decorated suites that will accommodate families. Walk down the steps in the hillside to Smuggler’s Cove, one of the best beaches on the island for kids learning to snorkel.\n\nFor a totally family-focused, all-inclusive stay, with a kids’ club, lazy river, tennis courts, and more, check out Coconut Bay Beach Resort & Spa.\n\n10. Trinidad and Tobago\n\nThe final dual island nation on our list may not have crossed your mind as a family destination. Trinidad is known for its blend of African and Indian heritage, and of course its exuberant and colorful Carnival festival—not exactly a kid-friendly experience.\n\nBut Tobago has been on our radar for years as an off-the-grid Caribbean destination. You won’t find waterslides or kids clubs here; Tobago is known for its chill vibes and calm beaches. We’d recommend this smaller island for a toddler beach vacation, while Trinidad for the culturally hungry.\n\nOn the whole, most Trinidadians and Tobagonians speak the official language, English. ​​Trinidad English (Trini) is a creole language, whereas with other English-based dialects, you might be able to follow the gist of a conversation. There are also lots of Spanish speakers.\n\nPrepare yourself to hear English spoken at lightning speed in Trinidad! Trini speakers rid themselves of excess words to get straight to the point while using a lot of slang; some unique to Trinidad, others like those used in other Caribbean languages.\n\nA few examples of phrases you may hear? “Better belly buss than good food waste” refers to the Trini ethos of eating to beyond capacity rather than throwing food out.\n\nAnd if you book an activity and the tour runs late, you might hear: “any time is Trinidad time,” an acceptance that people run on island time.\n\n11. Belize\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that English is the official language of the coastal Central American company of Belize. This tropical destination offers families a safe and authentic taste of Central American culture with the comforts of their home language.\n\nWith world-class snorkeling at the Belize Barrier Reef and advanced diving excursions operating in the Great Blue Hole, Belize is one of the coolest Caribbean destinations for families that love water activities and marine life.\n\nYou’ll easily be able to navigate Belize with just English, although if you want to, you could always dust off your high school español. Nearly half the population speaks Spanish as their native tongue, and Belizean Kriol spoken throughout the country\n\nWhere to stay in Belize with kids\n\nIf you’re headed to Ambergris Caye, our top choice for luxury, family-friendly suites and a lovely setting is Las Terrazas, hands down. But for a more rustic stay, consider Xanadu Island Resort.\n\nFurther south in Placencia, don’t hesitate to head to Francis Ford Coppola’s Turtle Inn for a dash of hollywood glam in a beach setting.\n\nFinally, for a snorkeling-focused trip with older kids who are confident swimmers, it would be hard to beat Off The Wall Dive Center and Resort, which sits on a private caye right on top of Glover’s Reef Atoll.\n\n1. Turks and Caicos\n\nTurks and Caicos may be the most popular English-speaking Caribbean destination among American family travelers in 2023. With cheap, direct flights from many major U.S. airports, tourism has been surging here since COVID.\n\nIn many ways, Turks and Caicos deserves its popular status. Providenciales, more commonly known as Provo, is home to some pretty amazing family resorts, with large suites, tons of amenities, and kitchens for those who like to shop for familiar foods on the road. Most of them sit on Grace Bay Beach, which is often cited as one of the prettiest beaches in the world. For those looking to explore underwater, the snorkeling in Turks and Caicos won’t disappoint.\n\nThat said, the island can feel built-up to some, and is very, very expensive. It’s also flat, meaning the land-based activities are not as exciting as some of the more mountainous islands on this list. But when it comes to delicious food, high-end hotels, sparkling water and soft-sand beaches, and ease of access, Turks and Caicos is hard to beat. There are also some remote corners to discover, such as Middle Caicos, that are alone worth the journey.\n\nWhere to stay in the Cayman Islands with Kids\n\nMost of Grand Cayman’s popular family-friendly hotels are part of large international chains whose names will be familiar. You can’t go wrong with these well-known options, which have stunning pools and prime beachfront locations:\n\nKimpton Seafire Resort & Spa\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Grand Cayman\n\nWestin Grand Cayman\n\nBut you know we’re lovers of boutique hotels here at Mango Tree. Our full profiles for the Cayman Islands are coming soon, but these are the properties we’ve got our eye on:\n\nPalm Heights\n\nGuests rave about the little details at this retro boutique resort on Seven Mile Beach, praising everything from the room design to the welcoming ethos of the staff.\n\nCaribbean Club\n\nThe one-, two- and three-bedroom suites at this quiet but upscale property will appeal to families of all sizes.\n\nBotanica Cayman\n\nA family of five brought their vision to life with this tiny, white-washed boutique hotel—as is reflect in their family cottage that contains a bunk room specifically with large families in mind.\n\n3. Anguilla\n\nAre you looking for a tropical family getaway away from the crowds? Consider Anguilla, an English-speaking Caribbean destination known for its phenomenal cuisine and stunning beaches.\n\nThe beauty of Anguilla lies in its seclusion. Before 2022, there were no direct flights from the United States to Anguilla. Instead, travelers would fly to St Martin and then take a short ferry ride over to Anguilla. This has historically kept the number of visitors low, making it posisble to find a calm spot in the sand or quiet restaurant to relax with your family.\n\nIn 2022, American Airlines launched direct flights from Miami to Anguilla, making the island a bit easier to access. But it’s still not overrun, and those who like a quiet island should find a way to get there. Once you arrive, prepare yourself for long stretches of sandy beaches, crystal clear waters and plenty of activities that are perfect for families with young children!\n\nAnd be prepared to eat. Anguilla is known for its fine-dining and excellent cuisine.\n\nWhere to Stay in Anguilla with Kids\n\nThe toughest part about a trip to Anguilla is figuring out where to stay, as the options are plentiful. There are several very high-end resorts, but some more affordable options as well.\n\nOur full Anguilla hotel profiles are coming soon. But here are the hotels on Meads Bay Beach – the islands’ most popular – that we’ve got our eye on:\n\nFor total luxury, Malliouhana, part of the Auberge Resorts Collection, would be our top choice. Parents can get pampered, and kids age 5-12 can enjoy the Malliouhana Mini-Explorers program.\n\nFor a special, boutique property, we’d recommend Frangipani Beach Resort, which has only 19 rooms, many of which are two-bedrooms. There’s no kids’ club here but plenty of watersports to keep everyone entertained.\n\nFor a cross between self-catering apartments and hotel amenities, we’re impressed by Tranquility Beach and Carimar Beach Club, which both sit about a 5-minute walk from each other on Meads Bay Beach. Both offer residential-style units, with multiple bedrooms and full kitchens, but with service and amenities of a boutique hotel.\n\n5. British Virgin Islands\n\nThe British Virgin Islands may be on your radar as a more adult-focused destination, especially given the focus on sailiing. But there’s a lot to offer families here as well, especially those seeking an English-speaking getaway. Tortola, the largest of the British Virgin Islands, can be reached by a two-hour ferry from St. Thomas, which in turn receives a lot of direct flights from the U.S. So your trip to the British Virgin Islands could be as easy as a flight and boat ride away.\n\nThis archipelago has more than 60 islands, but the big ones are Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Jost Van Dyke, and Anegada. Between them, family travelers can find an idyllic escape with stunning beaches, delicious cuisine, and plenty of activities to keep kids busy.\n\nOn Tortola, explore the tropical rainforest and white-sand beaches.\n\nVirgin Gorda is home to The Baths and Devil’s Bay National Parks, you can hike through tropical foliage and paddle in crystal clear waters.\n\nThe Baths are a surprisingly kid-friendly activity, with winding pathways, ladders, and seemingly unlimited coves and caves to explore.\n\nAnegadais known for its abundance of tropical wildlife including flamingos, iguanas, and turtles.\n\nAnd Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the four main islands, is home to lively bars and beachfront restaurants (and home to the painkiller).\n\nWhere to Stay in the British Virgin Islands with Kids\n\nWith so many islands, there are also a ton of hotels to choose from. Here’s where to start your search:\n\nFor total luxury, with a family-focus, take a look at the Rosewood Little Dix Bay on Virgin Gorda. Full dining plans are offered, with discounts for children. The hotel provides all the baby gear you could need for the littlest travelers, and the Rosewood Explorers Club and nanny services will ensure parents get a break.\n\nOr go in a totally different direction with palapa “glamping” at Anegada Beach Club. Families with kids age 6+ are welcome, and would have a blast in the two bedroom palapa retreats.\n\nFor more of a classic beach resort, but with villas for families to spread out, consider Mango Bay Resort on Virgin Gorda or Fort Recovery on Tortola.\n\n6. U.S. Virgin Islands\n\nAre you looking for a warm-weather family getaway that doesn’t require a passport? Look no further than the U.S. Virgin Islands! Not only is it an English speaking Caribbean destination, but it also offers crystal clear waters, several beautiful islands to explore and a wide range of accommodation from villas to luxury resorts – making it the perfect place for families seeking an easy tropical vacation.\n\nThe three main islands of the US Virgin Islands are St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John. The ferry to St. John from St. Thomas takes roughly 20 minutes, with St. Croix a bit further at 90 minutes travel time. Many people don’t know that there’s actually a fourth U.S. Virgin Island, Water Island, which can be reached from St. Thomas by boat in 10 minutes and offers a totally unique daytrip experience.\n\nMagens Bay on St Thomas is absolutely stunning, an amazing place to spend a day of swimming and relaxing with your family. Or explore the famous tropical beaches of St. John – from Trunk Bay to Honeymoon Beach – kids will love snorkeling, kayaking and exploring these tropical paradises. Finally, if you’re looking to go a bit further off the well-trodden tourist path, head off the coast of St. Croix, where Turtle Beach on Buck Island is said to be one of the world’s best.\n\nIn short, there’s plenty to do in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which is why it’s a favorite tropical destination for many American travelers, families included.\n\nWhere to Stay in the US Virgin Islands With Kids\n\nSt. Thomas is the homebase of choice for most families, with the largest international airport of the U.S. Virgin Islands, and easy ferry access to St. Croix and St. John. We suggest making Secret Harbour Beach Resort your homebase for a prime location near the Red Hook ferry and with spacious suites steps from one of our favorite beaches for kids.\n\nIf you’d prefer to stay on St. John, kids age 5+ are welcome at the popular Gallows Point Resort, which has snorkeling right on site and sits walking distance to the island’s best shops and beaches.\n\nFinally, for a classic Caribbean beach resort on St. Croix, take the kids to The Buccaneer Beach & Golf Resort, family-owned-and-operated since 1947."
