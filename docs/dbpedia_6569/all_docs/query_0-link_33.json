        "text": "Successful Transfer Applicants:\n\nPresent at least one year of rigorous, full-time academic coursework, with strong grades. Check out our Transfer Student Profile to see the average GPA of our most recent class of admitted transfer students.\n\nShow consistent progress toward a USC degree with at least one year of rigorous, full-time academic coursework. Competitive candidates typically take 14-16 units per term.\n\nComplete the equivalent of USC’s lower-division Writing requirement, Writing 130.\n\nMeet our minimum math requirement by demonstrating a mastery of Algebra II (Advanced Algebra) in high school, or Intermediate Algebra in college with a grade of C or better. Many majors require additional math.\n\nMake satisfactory progress toward meeting USC General Education requirements.\n\nComplete additional lower-division courses required (and recommended) by their intended major, if applicable. Refer Additional Coursework by Major to see if your intended major requires lower-division courses that should be completed before you transfer. This is especially important for students pursuing degrees in science, engineering, architecture or business.\n\nInternational students whose native language is not English must also demonstrate English-language proficiency.\n\nWhen to Transfer\n\nUSC accepts both sophomore and junior transfer students. By transferring as early as your sophomore year, you can take more of your General Education and elective courses at USC. You will be part of the USC community for a longer time and have more opportunities to get involved with campus life and make the connections that can help you after graduation.\n\nAlternately, if your academic record in high school fell short of USC expectations, you may be able to position yourself as a stronger candidate if you complete two years of solid undergraduate coursework at another institution before applying to transfer. Additionally, if you complete most of your General Education requirements before transferring, you will have more time to pursue a double major, a major-minor combination, or a unit-heavy major while you are enrolled at USC.\n\nCurrent high school students, please note: If you are still in high school, USC considers you a first-year applicant, regardless of the number of college units completed prior to high school graduation. If you have questions about your class standing, please call the USC Office of Admission at (213) 740-1111.\n\nTransfer Units\n\nUSC does not require a minimum number of transfer units.* However, if you will have earned fewer than 30 transferable semester units by the end of the spring term, we will base our decision in large part on your high school record and/or SAT or ACT scores (if you submit them). Please note that applicants to the 2024-2025 academic year are not required to submit SAT or ACT scores, although they may still submit them if they wish.\n\n*The School of Cinematic Arts, however, does require 48 units to transfer into the Film and Television Production program.\n\nCollege Transcripts\n\nYou must submit official transcripts from all colleges you have attended, regardless of whether or not all coursework or degree requirements were completed. Failure to do so may be viewed as a violation of academic integrity, which could result in revocation of admission and/or dismissal from the university.\n\nSelecting a Major\n\nTransfer applicants must indicate a first-choice major on the application. We also consider transfer students for an optional second-choice major or Undecided/Exploratory status.\n\nEnglish Proficiency Requirement\n\nInternational transfer applicants whose native language is not English must submit a TOEFL, IELTS, PTE Academic or qualifying SAT or ACT test score earned within two years of their application date. More information is available on our International Students page.\n\nRemedial Coursework\n\nPlacement exams offered at your current college will determine your need for any remedial coursework in writing and mathematics prior to your admission to USC. Remedial courses are not transferable.\n\nRequired Courses Taken on a Pass/No Pass Basis\n\nAs many as 24 semester units, including up to 4 units of General Education courses, may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis at USC. Typically, only one Core Literacy course may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis. Both Global Perspectives courses may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis. Competitive applicants typically take few, if any, courses on a Pass/No Pass basis. Please note that writing courses taken on a Pass/No Pass basis will not fulfill USC’s lower-division writing requirement.\n\nYou are considered a transfer applicant if you have enrolled in college since leaving high school.\n\nFor some majors requiring a portfolio or audition:\n\nApplication Deadline: December 1, 2024\n\nDecember 1 is the final deadline for transfer students applying to the following programs:\n\nKaufman School of Dance\n\nSchool of Cinematic Arts – BFA programs only\n\nSchool of Dramatic Arts – BFA programs only\n\nThornton School of Music\n\nSee Additional Major Requirements for information about your intended program.\n\nAll other majors\n\nApplication Deadline: February 15, 2025\n\nFinal application deadline for majors not requiring a portfolio or audition.\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nPriority Application Deadline: March 3, 2025\n\nApplicants who want to be considered for need-based financial aid must submit the FAFSA* and CSS Profile applications by this date.\n\nCalifornia residents should also apply for Cal Grants by this date.\n\n*Undocumented or DACA students should submit their 2023 tax return and third-party letter confirming undocumented status instead of the FAFSA.\n\nVisit our Financial Aid page for more information. To check on the status of your financial aid application, visit the FAST page in your applicant portal.\n\nRegular Decision Notification: May 30\n\nTransfer candidates will receive either an admission decision or a request for spring grades by May 30. If you receive a request for spring grades, you will be notified of an admission decision by mid-July.\n\nUnits That Must Be Earned at USC\n\nTransfer students must complete a minimum of 64 units in residence at USC, or half the units typically required for graduation. A few exceptions are noted below. While in residence at USC, you are also expected to:\n\nComplete all upper-division units in your major and minor.\n\nComplete WRIT 340, a minimum of two Core Literacy GE courses from a Dornsife College department, and any remaining General Education courses not taken before entering USC.\n\nTake all your fall- and spring-semester courses for credit at USC. Courses may be taken at other institutions only during summer sessions, with limitations.\n\nExceptions:\n\nEngineering “3+2” Program: Students must complete a minimum of 48 units in residence at USC. Two-thirds of any transferable coursework must be completed at one of USC’s four-year partner institutions.\n\nBachelor of Architecture: Students must earn at least 80 units at USC. A maximum of 70 of the transferable units for this program may be earned elsewhere.\n\nTransfer Unit Limits\n\nUSC limits the transfer of credit in certain categories. You may transfer up to 64 units of credit from other institutions, except where noted.\n\nFour (4) units each of English as a Second Language, physical education activity courses and music ensemble courses.\n\nEight (8) units of dance.\n\nTwelve (12) units of physical education theory courses.\n\nSixteen (16) units of individual instruction in music.\n\nOther studio and performing arts classes are also limited. Check with your admission counselor.\n\nCourses/Units That Will Transfer\n\nAccredited courses: Coursework completed at, or degrees from, U.S. institutions accredited by the six regional accrediting agencies are generally accepted. Coursework completed at international post-secondary institutions approved by the local Ministry of Education as degree-granting institutions may also transfer.\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB) and other standardized examinations: We accept a maximum of 32 units for standardized examinations.\n\nPlease visit arr.usc.edu/transfercredit for a list of standardized exams and the course requirements they fulfill.\n\nCollege courses taken during high school: We accept a maximum of 16 units, included in the 32-unit combined maximum for AP/IB/other exam credits. These courses must be taught by college faculty on a college campus, appear on your college transcript as part of the regular college curriculum and must not be applied to your high school diploma. They can fulfill General Education requirements, but they cannot fulfill the writing or foreign language requirements nor receive equivalence to USC courses.\n\nCourses/Units That May Transfer\n\nCourses in these categories will be considered by petition, and credit is granted on a case-by-case basis. Be sure to keep copies of course syllabi, exams and papers, as we may ask for these in making our determination. Nontraditional formats/time frames: Distance-learning, online courses, concentrated “intensive” sessions, special weekend modules, and other nontraditional course formats and time frames.\n\nPlease note that elective units only—not equivalence to USC courses or fulfillment of requirements—are granted for foreign language and laboratory science courses taught via distance learning, TV, or in an online or correspondence course.\n\nDue to disruptions caused by COVID-19, some exceptions may apply.\n\nCourses/Units That Will Not Transfer\n\nUnaccredited institutions: Coursework or degrees completed at U.S. institutions not accredited by a regional accrediting agency.\n\nNo degree credit: College extension courses and courses taken at international institutions not credited toward a degree at that college.\n\nAreas of study not offered by USC: These include agriculture, business office procedures, hotel management, food services, industrial mechanics, interior design, fire science, forestry, police academy, and similar professional and technical programs.\n\nDuplicated material: An AP exam and IB exam or college course covering the same material.\n\nLife and work experience: Including portfolio work, continuing education, equivalency examination units, and courses offered by business and governmental agencies (even if evaluated by the American Council on Education).\n\nPlacement exams: Courses and/ or unit credits awarded by another institution for placement examinations or credit by exam.\n\nRemedial/college preparatory/personal development: Including mathematics courses below the level of college-level algebra. (Intermediate Algebra, USC’s minimum math requirement for admission, is not transferable.)\n\nNontraditional formats at two-year colleges: Including independent study, directed study, correspondence courses, internships and travel courses.\n\nGraduate-level courses: Graduate-level coursework taken by undergraduate students.\n\nDetermining Your Transfer GPA\n\nUSC calculates your transfer GPA on the basis of your grades in all USC-transferable courses, including grades of D and below. Plus and minus grading is taken into account. Expired incompletes, unofficial withdrawals and missing grades are treated as an “F.” Credit/No Credit and Pass/No Pass marks are not included in the transfer GPA.USC does not honor other colleges’ academic “renewal” or “forgiveness” programs that permit students to improve a substandard grade. If you repeat a transferable course for which you earned a grade of D+ or lower, both grades will be included in your transfer GPA. If the grade on the first course was a C- or higher, only the first grade is included.\n\nYour transfer GPA is different from the GPA earned in courses you take at USC. The transfer GPA and your USC GPA are kept separate until it is time to determine if you are eligible to graduate and earn graduation honors, as described in the USC Catalogue.\n\nAcademic Standards and Requirements\n\nThe USC Catalogue is the document of authority on policy matters, and it changes from time to time. It provides complete information about academic standards governing coursework taken at other colleges, as well as specific requirements for your major field. Please visit catalogue.usc.edu for the most current version.\n\nStudents who began college in fall 2015 or after:\n\nStudents are required to follow these revised General Education requirements if they graduated high school in spring or summer 2015 and their first full-time term of college enrollment was fall 2015 or after (excluding summers).\n\nStudents who began college prior to fall 2015:\n\nStudents who started at any college or university before summer 2015 will follow the GE program in effect prior to fall 2015."
