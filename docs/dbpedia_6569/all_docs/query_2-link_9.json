        "text": "CLOQUET, Minn. (Northern News Now) - Every spring Northlanders can count on a favorite restaurant reopening for the season.\n\nGordy’s Hi-Hat, an iconic burger shop, in Cloquet, opened for the 2024 season on Wednesday.\n\nThe restaurant was founded in 1960 by namesake Gordy Lundquist and his wife Marilyn.\n\nHowever, this was the first time it reopened without either of the founders as both Gordy and Marilyn have passed away.\n\nThroughout a typical opening day, Gordy and Marilyn’s grandson and now owner of the restaurant, Sever Lundquist said they will serve up to 700 people.\n\nSever assured although this year is different for the Lundquist family, his grandparents’ legacies will continue to live on.\n\n“Many of our customers that we have today are because of what they did 65 years ago. They had a good relationship with a lot of people in our community,” said Sever. “We are really fortunate that they are willing to come in and still give us their business but also share some memories of my grandparents from the last six decades.”\n\nSever said nothing will change and customers can rely on the same burgers, shakes, and fries they love.\n\nDan Fisher, a customer from Knife River, Minn., drove down to Gordy’s to beat the lunch rush for his favorite burger, the Bacon Deluxe.\n\nFisher has gone to Gordy’s for 14 years and does not plan on stopping.\n\n“Man, the whole family’s involved here, the whole community’s involved here,” said Fisher. “You can tell when you walk in the door, Gordy is still alive here.”\n\nGordy’s is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. until Mother’s Day.\n\nAfter that, their hours will be 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. for the summer.\n\nClick here to download the Northern News Now app or our Northern News Now First Alert weather app."
