What is the significance of this moment in Native storytelling? What kinds of narrative change does the streaming era make possible? What work lies ahead? Moderated by Mead Advisor, Billy Luther, this discussion will include Erica Tremblay, Sterlin Harjo, and Steven Paul Judd.\n\nSterlin Harjo (Seminole/Muscogee) is an award-winning filmmaker from Holdenville, Oklahoma. Now based in Tulsa, Harjo is the co-creator and showrunner of FX’s Reservation Dogs, a comedy series following four Indigenous teenage friends living on a reservation in Oklahoma. After its first season, Reservation Dogs won a 2022 Peabody award, 2022 Television Academy Honors award, 2022 Independent Spirit Award for Best Comedy Series, was an American Film Institute Awards Honoree, and won Best Breakthrough Series under 40 minutes at the 2021 Gotham Awards. The series completed its third and final season. Currently, Harjo’s series The Sensitive Kind and Poster Girls is in development with FX Productions. Paramount+ recently acquired his series Yellowbird, which he co-created with Erica Tremblay.\n\nErica Tremblay is a filmmaker from the Seneca-Cayuga Nation. Her feature film Fancy Dance, starring Academy Award nominee Lily Gladstone, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was acquired by Apple Original Films. The film is set to be released in theaters and on Apple TV+ in 2024. Tremblay is currently writing for Season 3 of Dark Winds at AMC and has previously written for FX’s Reservation Dogs, where she also directed two episodes. In 2021, she was accepted into the Sundance Directors and Screenwriters Lab, and was awarded the Walter Bernstein Screenwriting Fellowship, the Maja Kristin Directing Fellowship, the SFFILM Rainin Grant, and the Lynn Shelton \"Of a Certain Age\" Grant. Her short film Little Chief, premiered at Sundance in 2020. Tremblay lives on Cayuga Lake in upstate New York, where she studies her Indigenous language.\n\nSteven Paul Judd is a prominent Kiowa-Choctaw visual artist, filmmaker, and writer known for his innovative and thought-provoking work that blends pop-culture and traditional Native American motifs into a unique perspective on contemporary Indigenous identity. Known for his work on Search for the World's Best Indian Taco (2010), Dark Winds (2022) and Echo (2023), Judd is also the subject of the 2016 documentary Dig It If You Can.\n\n6 pm | Wallach Orientation Center | Special Event\n\nDirector: Catherine Gund, Jacqueline Woodson (writer), Meshell Ndegeocello (composer), and Erika Dilday (producer)\n\n2024 | 89 min | USA\n\nNew York Premiere | Director in Attendance\n\n“This is not a love letter to this country. But to us inside this country.” Author Jacqueline Woodson narrates Meanwhile, a docu-poem about white supremacy and a community of artists who share visions of resistance. Meanwhile, an immersive, nonlinear cinematic journey—where artists’ expressions blend with historical and observational footage—unveils the profound impact of white supremacy on our human connections.\n\nThe two-hour special event will feature in-process works by artists from the film, including dance by Shamel Pitts and Tushrik Fredericks, wisdom and cookies by Juli Vanderhoop, music by Mel Chin, and more.\n\nThis program will be from 6–8 pm on the fourth floor of the Museum.\n\nThis film is supported in part by Ford Foundation/JustFilms, National Endowment for the Arts, and Brown University/CSREA.
