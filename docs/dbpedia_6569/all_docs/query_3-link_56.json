        "text": "An accomplished actor, who just happens to be a Minnesota native and UMD Theatre alumni, was spotted in Cloquet Friday evening, which was a pretty cool way for those at Gordy's Hi-Hat to kick off the Fourth of July weekend.\n\nJoel McKinnon Miller has a long and impressive acting resume and almost everyone knows him from the popular comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\n\nMost recently, he appeared in the HBO miniseries The Staircase. The Staircase, which stars Colin Firth, is an American true crime drama streaming television miniseries created by Antonio Campos, based on the 2004 true crime docuseries of the same name created by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade.\n\nIt tells the story of Michael Peterson, a crime novelist accused of killing his wife Kathleen after she is found dead at the bottom of a staircase in their home, and the 16-year judicial battle that followed. The miniseries made its debut in May, 2022.\n\nAs the Fourth of July weekend began, not only did the actor visit Gordy's Hi-Hat for a dinner, but he was cool enough to take a photo in front of the iconic Cloquet restaurant.\n\nGordy's Hi-Hat shared his visit on their official Facebook page:\n\n#brooklyn99 star and Minnesota native @joelmckmiller stopped in for dinner last night with his wife. Thanks for coming to see us.! It's a great weekend to be in Northern Minnesota.\n\nObviously, Joel McKinnon Miller knows what everyone in the Northland knows all too well, that no summer is complete without a visit to Gordy's Hi-Hat in Cloquet! It's been a favorite since 1960 and its reputation reaches far and wide.\n\nAfter visiting Gordy's Hi-Hat, the actor continued his journey through Northern Minnesota, taking time to post some photos Saturday on Twitter.\n\nIf you're planning on visiting Gordy's Hi-Hat over the holiday weekend, make it a priority on Saturday or Sunday as they will be closed on the Fourth of July.\n\nLOOK: The most famous actress born the same year as you\n\nMany of the actresses in this story not only made a name for themselves through their collection of iconic performances, but also through the selfless, philanthropic nature with which many of them approached their stardom. In an age of flipping the script on societal norms, many of these actresses are using their voices and platforms to be advocates for those who are otherwise unheard."
