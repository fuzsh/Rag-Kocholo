        "text": "THE actor and auteur Guillaume Canet is what the French call un boulimique de travail: a workaholic.\n\nAt 39, the Frenchman may be best known in the United States for “The Beach” in 2000, as the guy who loses his girlfriend to Leonardo DiCaprio, and for “Tell No One,” the 2006 thriller he directed that became a sleeper hit here. But in France Mr. Canet is half of a power couple, with the actress Marion Cotillard.\n\nThey met years ago and first worked together in the 2003 film “Love Me if You Dare,” just after he had directed his first feature film, “Whatever You Say.” Their friendship turned to romance about five years ago (they now have an infant son, Marcel), and both their stars have continued to rise, his for making the leap from working actor to popular, César-winning director, hers after winning the 2008 best-actress Oscar for playing Édith Piaf in “La Vie en Rose.” That success has led to Ms. Cotillard’s roles in high-profile Hollywood films like “The Dark Knight Rises,” and a recent poll in France ranked her and Mr. Canet as more popular than Brangelina. But like many celebrity couples, they keep their careers mostly separate, though she has roles in two of his films.\n\n“It’s physically and psychologically exhausting to make a film,” he said on a summer afternoon in Manhattan, speaking French on a day off from shooting his first English-language movie. After the editing of “Tell No One” was finished, “I was so fatigued that I caught a staph infection, and I was in the hospital for a month in the middle of summer. Nobody came to visit me. I had a lot of time to think about my priorities.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
