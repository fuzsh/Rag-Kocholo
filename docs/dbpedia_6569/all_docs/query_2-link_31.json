        "text": "Commented-On Language Hat Posts (courtesy of J.C.; contains useful Random Link feature)\n\nMy Languages\n\nMy Hats\n\nE-mail:\n\nlanguagehat AT gmail DOT com\n\nMy name is Steve Dodson; I’m a retired copyeditor currently living in western Massachusetts after many years in New York City.\n\nIf your preferred feed is Twitter, you can follow @languagehat to get\n\nlinks to new posts here as they appear. (I don’t otherwise participate\n\nin Twitter.)\n\nIf you’re feeling generous:\n\nmy Amazon wish list\n\nAnd you can support my book habit without even spending money on me by following my Amazon links to do your shopping (if, of course, you like shopping on Amazon); As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases (I get a small percentage of every dollar spent while someone is following my referral links), and every month I get a gift certificate that allows me to buy a few books (or, if someone has bought a big-ticket item, even more). You will not only get your purchases, you will get my blessings and a karmic boost!\n\nIf your comment goes into moderation (which can happen if it has too many links or if the software just takes it into its head to be suspicious), I will usually set it free reasonably quickly… unless it happens during the night, say between 10 PM and 8 AM Eastern Time (US), in which case you’ll have to wait. And occasionally the software will decide a comment is spam and it won’t even go into moderation; if a comment disappears on you, send me an e-mail and I’ll try to rescue it. You have my apologies in advance. Also, my posts should be taken as conversation-starters; there is no expectation of “staying on topic,”and some of the best threads have gone in entirely unexpected directions. I have strong opinions and sometimes express myself more sharply than an ideal interlocutor might, but I try to avoid personal attacks, and I hope you will do the same."
