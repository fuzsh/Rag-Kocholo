I look for great things as we continue to elevate this athletics communications department.”\n\nMcDaniel will serve as the primary contact for volleyball, women's soccer, bowling, women's basketball, softball and men's and women's tennis. In addition, she will be the secondary contact for football.\n\n“I am truly honored and excited to join the AAMU Athletics program and am incredibly grateful to be a part of such a dynamic department and culture,” McDaniel said. “I am eager to contribute to the success of our programs and look forward to all the opportunities ahead. I am equally enthusiastic for the chance to grow within an environment that values excellence and dedication both academically and athletically.”\n\nMcDaniel joins the Bulldog family from the University of Kentucky, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Sports Communication and a Bachelor of Arts in Writing, Rhetoric, and Digital Studies in 2022.
