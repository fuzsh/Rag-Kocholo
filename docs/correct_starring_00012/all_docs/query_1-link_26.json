        "text": "The cast of Love Actually all reunited recently for the 20th anniversary of the greatest Christmas film ever. The anniversary featured interviews with Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Laura Linney and it just doesn’t get any better than that. With the movie now officially making us feel old, the cast of Love Actually have been up to a lot, with many of them being Hollywood superstars and staples in some of the greatest TV shows and movies from the past 20 years.\n\nGet yourself a hot chocolate and turn on Jump (For My Love) by The Pointer Sisters, and have a look at what the cast of Love Actually have been up to since the movie was released:\n\nHugh Grant – The prime minister\n\nHugh Grant is a man of many talents and the only prime minister we want to run the country. Hugh Grant was already a big name in the movie world before he starred in Love Actually for his roles in Notting Hill, Bridget Jones’s Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Over the years, Hugh Grant has starred in the Guy Ritchie films The Gentlemen and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. In 2020, Hugh Grant starred in The Undoing, alongside Nicole Kidman.\n\nMartine McCutcheon – Natalie\n\nMartine McCutcheon played the role of Natalie, the person we all wanted to be in Love Actually. Similarly to Hugh Grant, McCutcheon was fairly established before Love Actually as she starred on EastEnders as Tiffany. McCutcheon hasn’t been in a lot of the years but has starred in The Bromley Boys, Jump! and Agatha Christie’s Marple.\n\nColin Firth – Jamie\n\nColin Firth has been a staple on our TV and movie screens over the years and he still shows no signs of slowing down. One role in particular everyone knows Colin for is in Mamma Mia as Harry Bright. He has also starred in every Kingsman film from 2014 to 2021.
