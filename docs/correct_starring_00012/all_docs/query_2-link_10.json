\"Main Street\" (2010).\n\nHis most critically acclaimed films are \"Conspiracy\" (2001) and \"The King's Speech\" (2010).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Richard in \"The Accidental Husband\" (2008).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 6%\n\nSummary: Radio host Emma Lloyd (Uma Thurman) finds herself at the center of a scheme when a broken-hearted firefighter (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) intercepts her engagement with her fiancé (Firth).\n\nFilm reviewers didn't hold back when it came to calling the film clichéd and unhinged.\n\n\"Sub-lousy hackneyed crapola all the way, a complete disaster, one of the year's worst movies,\" film critic David Cornelius wrote for DVD Talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Gus Leroy in \"Main Street\" (2010).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 13%\n\nSummary: Gus Leroy (Firth) moves to Durham, North Carolina, with a wild business proposal to save the city's dying tobacco business.\n\nCritics remarked that the drama was filled with uneven acting and disjointed direction.\n\n\"There's something interesting here at the core of the conflict, but the story is offered so little room to breathe, coming across rushed and undercooked,\" wrote film critic Brian Orndorf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold\" (2009), he played Geoffrey Thwaites.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 14%\n\nSummary: In the sequel, after discovering that headmistress Camilla Fritton (Rupert Everett) is descended from a legendary pirate, the unconventional boarding school students go on a misguided treasure hunt.\n\nFirth returned to the franchise to play Geoffrey Thwaites, Camilla's old flame.\n\nThe sequel was written off by critics who found it disastrously unfunny.\n\n\"A film that flails about wildly in search of at least one half-decent joke,\" wrote Neil Smith for Total Film. \"Tragically, the closest it gets is having a dog hump Colin Firth's leg.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirth was Aurelius in \"The Last Legion\" (2007).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 15%\n\nSummary: General Aurelius (Firth) and his band of soldiers take a last stand as the Roman Empire collapses.\n\nReviewers didn't enjoy the harried action drama, but some said it might be fitting for younger audiences.\n\n\"A novel hybrid of swords, sandals, horned helmets and furs, this really is a load of old rubbish, but there's some fun to be had, especially for boys who like to have mock sword fights with wooden sticks,\" wrote film critic Daniel Etherington for Film4.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Gambit\" (2012), he appeared as Harry Deane.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 18%\n\nSummary: Long-suffering art curator Harry Deane (Firth) decides to take his revenge on his abusive boss (Alan Rickman) with the help of cowgirl PJ Puznowski (Cameron Diaz).\n\nMany reviewers remarked that the dull comedy failed to deliver any surprises, but Firth's performance was a standout.\n\n\"Colin Firth is decidedly much better than the role and the lines he's given,\" Kong Rithdee wrote in a review for the Bangkok Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Peter Ingleton in \"Relative Values\" (2000).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 20%\n\nSummary: In the comedy based on the play by Noël Coward, Earl Nigel Marshwood (Edward Atterton) brings home an American actress (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and proposes to her against the wishes of his mother (Julie Andrews).\n\nAcross the board, critics dismissed the comedy as a lightweight affair that quickly faded from memory.\n\nIn a review for New York magazine, John Leonard wrote the movie off as a \"trying-too-hard film version of a bubbleheaded Noël Coward play.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirth starred in \"Arthur Newman\" (2012).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 20%\n\nSummary: After faking his own death, professional golfer Wallace Avery (Firth) rebrands himself as Arthur Newman and joins a young woman (Emily Blunt) on a road trip so they can both escape their pasts.\n\nMany reviewers felt Blunt and Firth's acting prowess was wasted on a middling script.\n\nAllan Hunter wrote for Express that \"Arthur Newman\" was a \"film that fails to make the most of a good cast and a great premise.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor played Jess Clark in \"A Thousand Acres\" (1997).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 24%\n\nSummary: After decades spent running the family farm, a father (Jason Robards) slips into anger and insanity in his old age and fights his daughters (Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange) in a destructive legal battle.\n\nIn the film, Firth played Jess Clark, the son of a neighboring farmer.\n\nMost critics dismissed \"A Thousand Acres\" as an overwrought melodrama.\n\n\"Despite the golden promise of the cornfields, its crops are barren,\" Michael Wilmington wrote for the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Hope Springs\" (2003), he was Colin Ware.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 25%\n\nSummary: After traveling to the US to get over his ex (Minnie Driver), British artist Colin (Firth) befriends a local girl named Mandy (Heather Graham) and soon finds himself at the center of a love triangle.\n\nThe romantic comedy instructed audiences to suspend their disbelief one too many times for most critics' liking.\n\n\"Ultimately it's the wholly unbelievable — and frankly, impossible — story that makes 'Hope Springs' fail to work in virtually every scene,\" wrote film critic Christopher Null.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirth played Ron Lax in \"Devil's Knot\" (2013).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 25%\n\nSummary: After three young boys are murdered in Arkansas in 1993, investigator Ron Lax (Firth) tries to separate fact from fiction as the town descends into satanic panic.\n\nMost film critics said the movie, which was inspired by a true story, had a thematic identity crisis and lacked strong direction.\n\n\"The passion of the two leads is not enough to carry the film to any satisfying conclusion,\" wrote Andy J. Smith in a review for One Room With a View.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe returned as Mark Darcy in \"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\" (2004).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 27%\n\nSummary: After a vacation goes disastrously awry, Bridget Jones (Renée Zellweger) breaks up with her boyfriend, Mark (Firth), and reconnects with her ex, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).\n\nMany reviewers said that the sequel lacked the charm and likability of the original entry.\n\n\"The humiliation of Bridget Jones is done so many times that it's not funny and it's not clever and it's not interesting,\" Richard Roeper wrote for Ebert & Roeper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Trauma\" (2004), the actor played Ben.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 29%\n\nSummary: After waking up from a coma, Ben (Firth) is distraught to realize that his wife Elisa (Naomie Harris) was killed in the car accident that put him in the hospital. When he's released, Ben continues to be haunted by his wife's death.\n\nMost critics felt the drama aimed for mystery and fell into the trap of being completely confusing.\n\nFilm critic Dennis Schwartz wrote the movie off as a \"visually stylish chiller that falls apart because it's a mess.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe originated his role as Geoffrey Thwaites in \"St. Trinian's\" (2007).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 31%\n\nSummary: A group of girls band together to stage a robbery and save their failing boarding school, led by headmistress Camilla Fritton (Everett).\n\nFirth appeared as Minister of Education, Geoffrey Thwaites.\n\nFor many, the movie fell squarely in the middle ground between being mildly interesting and utterly directionless.\n\n\"Firth looks like he's changing his mind about being in this movie WHILE the cameras are running,\" wrote film critic Michael Phillips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirth played Lord Henry Dashwood in \"What a Girl Wants\" (2003).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 36%\n\nSummary: American teen Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) is shocked to learn that her biological father, Henry Dashwood (Firth), is a wealthy British politician.\n\nDespite giving it low marks across the board, critics also admitted that they might not have been the target audience for the rom-com.\n\n\"Too-cute with a few iffy moments, but tweens will eat it up,\" Nell Minow wrote in a review for Common Sense Media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Before I Go to Sleep\" (2014), he was Ben.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 37%\n\nSummary: Due to memory loss, Christine (Nicole Kidman) wakes up every morning with a house and husband (Firth) she doesn't remember having. As she starts to question the reality given to her, she unlocks a dark truth.\n\nCritics largely felt the actors did their best with the material, but that the film was cursed from the onset by amateur direction and writing.\n\n\"This is '50 First Dates' — dark, but lacking that film's humor, characterizations, dramatic interest, and consistency,\" Louis Black wrote for the Austin Chronicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Vince Collins in \"Where the Truth Lies\" (2005).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 41%\n\nSummary: Los Angeles journalist Karen O'Connor (Alison Lohman) tries to unearth the secrets behind the partnership of entertainers Vince Collins (Firth) and Lanny Morris (Kevin Bacon).\n\nThe story's endless twists left many critics' heads spinning.\n\nIn a review for BBC, Matthew Leyland dismissed the movie as an \"awkward marriage of smut and smarts that teases on every level but doesn't quite satisfy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Dorian Gray\" (2009), the actor appeared as Lord Henry Wotton.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 44%\n\nSummary: Based on the classic tale by Oscar Wilde, the mystery follows Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) and the sickly truth behind his pursuit of eternal youth.\n\nThe film itself did little to impress most reviewers, but Firth's performance as Lord Henry Wotton, shined through.\n\n\"Some neat formal flourishes from its director Oliver Parker and a truly handsome supporting turn from Colin Firth, this story demands a more versatile and charismatic central player than the powerfully blank Ben Barnes,\" wrote film critic Kevin Maher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Mr. Ellis in \"Empire of Light\" (2022).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 44%\n\nSummary: Set in the 1980s English seaside, \"Empire of Light\" follows theater manager Hilary (Olivia Colman), who's struggling with her mental health. She pursues a relationship with new employee Stephen (Micheal Ward) despite criticism from locals.\n\nFirth plays Mr. Ellis, Hilary's boss.\n\nCritics saw the potential of this film and its talented cast but ultimately felt the story was disconnected and unconvincing.\n\n\"Watching the misguided artistry at work in 'Empire of Light,' it's hard to fathom just what attracted so many top-tier talents to a project of such torpor,\" wrote Rex Reed for Observer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played the titular character in \"Valmont\" (1989).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 48%\n\nSummary: Based on the novel \"Les Liaisons dangereuses\" by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, the story follows widow Merteuil (Annette Bening) as she dares Valmont (Firth) to turn the eye of a married woman (Meg Tilly).\n\nCritics said the power of the original novel didn't translate well in this adaptation.\n\n\"'Valmont,' then, proves a mixed blessing; a sumptuous treat for the eyes, a quiet disappointment for the mind,\" Geoff Brown wrote for the Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Then She Found Me\" (2007), he was Frank.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 50%\n\nSummary: Based on the book by Elinor Lipman, \"Then She Found Me\" centers on April (Helen Hunt) as she grapples with divorce, unexpectedly meeting her birth mother (Bette Midler), and falling for Frank (Firth).\n\nCritics said that Hunt's acting was on point, but her freshman directing efforts needed more refining.\n\n\"Everyone acts decently and you have to praise Hunt for her tenacity,\" wrote Derek Malcolm for the London Evening Standard. \"But this suffers from some fairly dire cinematography and a manufactured air that prevents the watcher connecting to the whole thing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe reappeared as Harry Hart in \"Kingsman: The Golden Circle\" (2017).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 50%\n\nSummary: When the Kingsman headquarters are destroyed in England, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Harry (Firth) must band together with the American Statesman organization to take on a shared enemy.\n\nCritics said that the \"Kingsman\" sequel was equally fun and messy.\n\nLarushka Ivan-Zadeh wrote for Metro that the film amounted to \"another goofily imaginative movie for teenagers made by middle-aged comic book fans.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Magic in the Moonlight\" (2014), he was Stanley.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 51%\n\nSummary: Skeptic Stanley Crawford (Firth) is tasked with confronting spiritual medium Sophie Baker (Emma Stone) — only to realize that she's more than meets the eye.\n\nCritics said one of the greatest disappointments in the film was the lack of any romantic spark between Firth and Stone.\n\n\"No kind of chemistry between the two ever arises, making their eventual romance, arrived at through pages of halting dialogue, feel particularly awkward,\" David Sims wrote for The Atlantic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Max Perkins in \"Genius\" (2016).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 52%\n\nSummary: Based on a true story, \"Genius\" provides insight into the storied career of book editor Max Perkins (Firth) who worked with Thomas Wolfe (Jude Law), Ernest Hemingway (Dominic West), and F. Scott Fitzgerald (Guy Pearce).\n\nAccording to critics, \"Genius\" was an ambitious tale that dipped its toe too often into familiar territory.\n\n\"A bit of a retread of drunk writer self-destructs tropes, but if you can't resist yet another trip down memory lane with your favorite writers…then 'Genius' will give you another chance,\" wrote Asia Frey for Lagniappe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Easy Virtue\" (2008), he played Mr. Whittaker.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 52%\n\nSummary: John (Ben Barnes) disappoints his father (Firth), mother (Kristin Scott Thomas), and the entire family when he returns to his estate with an American bride (Jessica Biel).\n\nOverall, the period drama had its fair share of critics and admirers.\n\n\"This British drawing-room comedy feels awfully familiar but is redeemed by some tart performances,\" Pete Hammond wrote for Hollywood.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor voiced Fred in \"A Christmas Carol\" (2009).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 53%\n\nSummary: In the Disney animated adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic story, Scrooge (voiced by Jim Carrey) is visited by three ghosts that inspire him to lead a life well-lived.\n\nIn the film, Firth voiced Scrooge's nephew Fred.\n\nMany critics said director Robert Zemeckis did his best to put a unique spin on the classic tale, but it was hard for it to stand out.\n\n\"Zemeckis' film preserves much of Dickens' original dialogue and detail while amplifying the utter ethereal strangeness of the ghosts,\" wrote Amy Biancolli for the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Harry Bright in \"Mamma Mia\" (2008).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 55%\n\nSummary: After reading her mother's (Meryl Streep) diary entries from a summer 20 years prior, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) invites three men — Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Bill (Stellan Skarsgård), and Harry (Firth) — to her wedding, hoping one might be her father.\n\nSome critics dismissed \"Mamma Mia\" as too campy to take seriously, but others appreciated it as a guilty pleasure.\n\n\"Sometimes you just need a trip to the Greek isles, some '70s pop, or maybe both to get into the summer mood,\" wrote Casey Cipriani for Bustle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirth played Paul Ashworth in \"Fever Pitch\" (1997).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 56%\n\nSummary: Sports fan Paul (Firth) falls in love with a schoolteacher (Ruth Gemmell) as he continues to obsess over his favorite English football team that hasn't won a championship in years.\n\nSome critics admired the sincerity and good intentions at the heart of the romantic comedy, based on the novel by Nick Hornby. But others felt like it fell short.\n\n\"With soccer substituting for rock music, novelist/screenwriter Nick Hornby's 'Fever Pitch' plays like a rough draft of 'High Fidelity'...a very rough draft,\" wrote critic Carlo Cavagna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe portrayed Jack in \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (2002).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 57%\n\nSummary: Oscar Wilde's play comes to life as Algernon Moncrieff (Everett) and Jack Worthing (Firth) both take on the moniker \"Ernest\" to help their love lives.\n\nMany critics marked the film down for poor direction but enjoyed the efforts of the cast.\n\n\"This may be a less than ideal 'Earnest,' but it still has delights,\" David Ansen wrote for Newsweek.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Stars in Shorts\" (2012), Firth was Steve.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 60%\n\nSummary: In the star-studded short-film compilation, Firth played oddball Steve, who disturbed the peace of his upstairs neighbors (Keira Knightley and Tom Mison).\n\nCritics said the collection of shorts had a wide range of qualities that lacked cohesion. But it was partially saved by memorable performances.\n\n\"They showcase not just the acting chops of Colin Firth, Lily Tomlin, Julia Stiles and others, but some fresh writing-directing talents, too,\" wrote Michael Upchurch for the Seattle Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Love Actually\" (2003), he was novelist Jamie Bennett.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 64%\n\nSummary: In \"Love Actually,\" different couples fall in love and fall apart over the holiday season in Britain. Firth played a novelist named Jamie who falls for his housekeeper, Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz), despite the language barrier between them.\n\nThe holiday-centric romantic comedy elicited a range of reviews from critics.
