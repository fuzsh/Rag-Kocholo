        "text": "Colin Firth (born September 10, 1960, Grayshott, Hampshire, England) is a British actor especially known for his portrayals of aloof characters who gradually shed their reserve to become emotionally available, notably Mr. Darcy in a television adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice (1995) and the future king George VI in The King’s Speech (2010).\n\nFirth’s parents were teachers, and the family moved frequently, living in Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States. He acted in school plays, and in 1980 he was accepted to the Drama Centre London (now part of the University of Arts London and Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design). Three years later he made his West End debut, portraying a character based on the British spy Guy Burgess in the play Another Country. In 1984 Firth starred in the film adaptation, though he was cast in a different role. Over the next decade Firth worked steadily, appearing in numerous stage, movie, and television productions. In 1988 he received critical praise for the TV film Tumbledown, in which he portrayed a Scottish soldier who is injured during the Falkland Islands War and endures a difficult recovery. The role earned Firth his first British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award nomination. Notable feature films from this period included Apartment Zero (1988), Valmont (1989), and Circle of Friends (1995).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nDespite his numerous credits, Firth did not receive his major breakthrough until he appeared as Fitzwilliam Darcy in the television miniseries Pride and Prejudice (1995). His portrayal of a repressed aristocrat whose haughtiness hides his growing affection for Elizabeth Bennet earned Firth a devoted following. A series of acclaimed films followed, including The English Patient (1996) and Shakespeare in Love (1998), both of which earned an Academy Award for best picture. In 2001 Firth garnered further attention as Mark Darcy in the romantic comedy Bridget Jones’s Diary, an adaptation of Helen Fielding’s best-selling novel. That character, an uptight lawyer who falls in love with the title character (played by Renée Zellweger), was based on Austen’s Mr. Darcy. Firth reprised the role in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004) and Bridget Jones’s Baby (2016).\n\nFirth continued to display his versatility in such films as Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003), in which he starred as the 17th-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer; the family film Nanny McPhee (2005); and the box-office hit Mamma Mia! (2008), a musical based on the songs of ABBA. In Tom Ford’s 2009 adaptation of Christopher Isherwood’s novel A Single Man, he portrayed a gay professor who, following the death of his lover, displays a stoic front while contemplating suicide. The role earned Firth his first Oscar nomination, and he won his first BAFTA Award. He received further acclaim with the historical drama The King’s Speech (2010), starring as Prince Albert (eventually King George VI) of Great Britain, who enlists the aid of an eccentric speech therapist (played by Geoffrey Rush) to overcome a debilitating stutter. Firth garnered numerous accolades for his poignant performance, including an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award.\n\nAfter playing a slick Texas businessman in the small-town drama Main Street (2010), Firth took the role of a British intelligence agent suspected of treason in the 2011 film adaptation of John le Carré’s novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. In the dark comedy Arthur Newman (2012), he starred as a discontented family man who fakes his death and embarks on a journey under an assumed identity. He played a former World War II prisoner of war who goes in search of the Japanese interpreter who tortured him in The Railway Man (2013), based on a memoir. Firth then evinced the husband of a woman (played by Nicole Kidman) who loses her memory in the thriller Before I Go to Sleep (2014). He deployed his starchy diction and composure to comic effect as a spy in the thriller parody Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) and the franchise’s second installment, Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017)."
