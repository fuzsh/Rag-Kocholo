        "text": "When the stars of Love Actually reunited last year for its 20th anniversary, many fans felt the cast hadn't changed a bit.\n\nStarring some of Hollywood's biggest hitters, including Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Bill Nighty, the wintery flick, released in 2003, has become synonymous with Christmas. Written and directed by Richard Curtis, the iconic film received mixed reviews from critics, but despite this it has become a modern day must-watch.\n\nLast year, Diane Sawyer hosted an ABC special called The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later, where she caught up with some of the stars of the film. But what happened to the other actors who starred in the romantic comedy? Here we look back at what's changed since 2003.\n\nHarry - Alan Rickman\n\nAlan Rickman, perhaps most known for going on to star as Professor Snape in the Harry Potter series, played Emma Thompson's husband in Love Actually.\n\nThe so-called 'Bad Harry' found himself in the doghouse after falling for the charms of Mia and breaking his wife's heart in the process. But in real life, actor Alan was far from a lothario, staying married to childhood sweetheart Rima Horton until his death in 2016.\n\nSadly, the actor passed away aged 69 in January 2016 after suffering a minor stroke in August 2015, before doctors discovered he was suffering from pancreatic cancer.\n\nDaniel - Liam Neeson\n\nLiam Neeson played Sam's grieving step-father, Daniel, who is navigating life after his wife died. Tragically, six years later the actor's own life was hit by tragedy when his wife Natasha Richardson died in a freak skiing accident.\n\nThe actress had been taking a beginners ski lesson at the Mont Tremblant Resort near Montreal when she fell and hit her head. After initially laughing off the incident, Natasha was rushed to hospital in New York after complaining of agonising headaches.\n\n\"I was told she was brain dead... She was on life support and stuff,\" Liam told 60 Minutes in 2014. \"And I went in... and told her I loved her. I said, 'Sweetie, you’re not coming back from this. You've banged your head. It's – I don’t know if you can hear me, but that's – this is what's gone down.'\" Sadly, Natasha died from an epidural hematoma two days later.\n\nLiam, now 71, threw himself into his career following the tragic loss of his wife, starring in many thrillers – including Taken, The A-Team, Wrath of the Titans Non-Stop and The Commuter. He has never remarried.\n\nMark - Andrew Lincoln\n\nAndrew Lincoln, now 50, played the part of Mark, who was hopelessly in love with his best friend's wife Juliet, played by Keira Knightley. The This Life star went on to become a huge Hollywood star thanks to his role as Rick Grimes in blockbuster zombie apocalypse series, The Walking Dead.\n\nIn 2019, Andrew starred in drama Penguin Bloom and later played the part of Rick in a spinoff of The Walking Dead, which was released this year.\n\nMia - Heike Makatsch\n\nHeike Makatsch played Mia, the office femme fatale who seduced her married boss Harry, and convinced him to buy her a sexy Christmas present which wife Karen then found.\n\nThe German actress went on to make a name for herself as Lisa Addison in 2002's Resident Evil and Liesel's mother in The Book Thief in 2013.\n\nIn 2020 Heike starred as a journalist and single mother in a crime drama called Zero, directed by Jochen Alexander Freydank.\n\nSam - Thomas Brodie-Sangster\n\nNow aged 33, Thomas Brodie-Sangster went on to have incredible success as an actor after playing young Sam in Love Actually.\n\nHe starred in Nanny McPhee, Nowhere Boy and Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens and landed the coveted role of Jojen Reed in Game of Thrones. He got engaged in July this year to dating Elon Musk's ex-wife Talulah Riley, who he starred in Danny Boyle's Sex Pistols biopic Pistol with. Thomas later confirmed the couple hadn't started dating until filming wrapped.\n\nJoanna - Olivia Olson\n\nAmerican actress Olivia Olson impressed viewers with her incredible rendition of All I Want For Christmas. After Love Actually, the Californian native starred in Disney's long-running TV show Phineas And Ferb from 2007 to 2015.\n\nShe also voiced Bliss in the reboot of The Powerpuff Girls, and has narrated characters in a number of video games such as the Adventure Time franchises' games and Lego Dimensions. Now aged 31, she also took part in X-Factor Celebrity in 2019, but was left in tears when she was voted off in the first live show.\n\nKarl - Rodrigo Santoro\n\nHunky Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro played the shy office worker who Laura Linney's character Sarah fell in love with. Since then, Rodrigo has had steady work, with stand-out roles in 300 and Focus. He also appeared on the TV show Lost as Paulo, and HBO's Westworld as Hector.\n\nNow aged 48, he is still acting and is starred in American supernatural teen drama series Wolf Pack alongside Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Sarah Michelle Gellar in 2023.\n\nJudy - Joanna Page\n\nJoanna Page plays stunt double Judy who falls in love with Martin Freeman's character John. The Welsh actress went on to star as one of the titular characters in James Corden's Gavin and Stacey.\n\nJoanna has continued to act, starring as Bethan Stubbins in the 2020 movie Doolittle alongside Robert Downey Jr. Now 46, the mum-of-four has also co-presented BBC One consumer series Shop Well for less alongside Melanie Sykes and recently popped up Celebrity Antiques Roadshow alongside Go Compare star, Wynne Evans.\n\nAurelia - Lucia Moniz\n\nLucia Moniz made a name for herself as Colin Firth's character Jamie's Portuguese cleaner. Before starring in the film she was actually a singer, famously representing her country at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1996.\n\nWith five albums under her belt to date, she returned to the music industry after filming. Now aged 47, she has also continued to star in TV shows, most recently as Isabel Da Paz in the Portuguese telenovela Na Corda Bamba.\n\nColin - Kris Marshall\n\nKris Marshall played Colin Frisell, who travelled to America because he struggled to find \"English girls\". The 50-year-old has had a hugely successful career, and many will also recognise him for his role as Nick Harper in the TV series My Family.\n\nHe has also starred as Gratiano in The Merchant of Venice and as DI Humphrey Goodman in Death in Paradise. The actor reprised his role as the hapless cop in Beyond Paradise this year in which he reunites with his Death In Paradise co-star, Sally Bretton."
