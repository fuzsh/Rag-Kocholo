Morte is a character from the Dungeons & Dragons based videogame Planescape:Torment.

floating skull with an acerbic attitude, Morte is chaotic good. He is voiced with a US east coast accent by Rob Paulsen, who is from Detroit, Michigan.

While he lacks a body, he is a capable warrior in many aspects, biting with his sharp fangs and throwing foes off guard with taunts, while his smaller size, lack of vital organs and pseudo-undead nature protect him from many attacks that would normally inflict serious wounds. Many fans wonder where he keeps his inventory. Morte and The Nameless One have an extended history together. Morte starts off in your party at the very beginning of the game, and - if you do not remove him from your party - can help you learn much of The Nameless One's previous incarnations.

Towards the end of the game you find out where Morte came from: a Pillar of Skulls on the plane ofBaator. Morte was pulled out by the Practical Incarnation from the pillar. The pile is composed of the skulls of all the people who died and have caused another to die through their lies. Morte's torment comes from the fact that he, prior to his death, lied to the Good Incarnation and told him that Ravel could make him immortal, and is thus responsible for the Nameless One's lamentable condition. If the Nameless One convinces Morte to reveal this history and forgives him, Morte becomes significantly stronger, his personal torment lessened.

His taunts are also very useful as they enable him to prevent a fleeing character from escaping and also allow him to silence spellcasting characters into going into melee combat. However, his taunts do not work on the undead and on creatures that possess very low intelligence or have no will of their own. Morte is the source of much of the game's humor, not the least being the chaotic conversations that can result between him and the Nameless One, whom he refers to as Chief.
