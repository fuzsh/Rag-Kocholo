        "text": "Now revered for creating some of the most detailed, vast, and chaotic open-world action games ever made, Rockstar has walked a unique path to becoming a household name. While plenty of players are used to hijacking cars and robbing banks on the streets of their famed Grand Theft Auto games, what many may not know is that Rockstar has made everything from licensed Austin Power tie-ins to an intricate table tennis simulator. With the most recent GTA 6 trailer arriving, you may be interested in more of what Rockstar has to offer.\n\nIt’s a large developer-publisher that’s explored many different avenues over the years, so let’s take a deep dive into Rockstar’s history and look at all the games its various teams have released so far.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nHow Many Rockstar Games Are There?\n\nIn total, there have been 47 games released by Rockstar. While the label wasn't formed until December 1998, technically its first game was released in 1997 (Grand Theft Auto) and its most recent hit shelves in 2018 (Red Dead Redemption 2). The list below runs through all of these games. It’s worth noting that the list won’t include DLCs or remasters, although standalone expansions made the cut.\n\nAll Rockstar Game in Order of Release Date\n\nGrand Theft Auto - 1997\n\nAlthough released before the studio was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in 1998 and slotted beneath the Rockstar Games banner, DMA Design Limited (which would go on to become Rockstar’s core studio, Rockstar North) dropped arguably one of the most important games of all time in Grand Theft Auto.\n\nA top-down action game where players attempt to make a name as a criminal on the streets of various fictional cities, Grand Theft Auto planted the seeds for one of the industry’s biggest franchises. Rockstar Games eventually re-released this crime simulator several times, cementing it within their portfolio and definitively making it Rockstar’s flagship franchise.\n\nWild Metal Country - 1999\n\nA stop-gap for DMA Design Limited between Grand Theft Auto and its sequel, Wild Metal Country sees players hop into tanks and battle their friends on hostile alien planets. The game wasn’t initially released under the Rockstar banner, with Gremlin Interactive handling publishing duties. However, it was re-released for the Dreamcast in 2004 as an official Rockstar-published title.\n\nMonster Truck Madness 64 - 1999\n\nPublished by Rockstar and developed by Edge of Reality Games, Monster Truck Madness 64 is exactly what you’d expect from a game that promises both monster trucks and madness. You race big monster trucks around various tracks, attempting to beat your friends in multiplayer or finesse each of its 10 courses in single-player.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 2 - 1999\n\nThe first Grand Theft Auto game to officially launch under the Rockstar banner, Grand Theft Auto 2 expanded on the original game’s premise. Shifting the story to the more futuristic setting of Anywhere City, players were once again tasked with making a name for themselves while working for crime syndicates, avoiding the police, and making cold hard cash.\n\nEarthworm Jim 3D - 1999\n\nDeveloped by VIS Interactive and published in North America by Rockstar Games, Earthworm Jim 3D was the third entry in the popular Earthworm Jim franchise. It saw the titular anthropomorphic insect trapped inside his fracturing consciousness, needing to defeat enemies from his past to wake back up. As its title suggests, it took the series to the 3D realm for the first time, following in the footsteps of N64 games like Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time.\n\nThrasher Presents: Skate and Destroy - 1999\n\nPitted as a rival to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Thrasher Presents: Skate and Destroy was developed by Z-Axis and published by Rockstar. The idea was to skate through 12 stages, working your way up through the skater world and eventually starring in Thrasher magazine. Skate and Destroy focused primarily on physics and a sim-like gameplay style, with the player able to ragdoll and take damage if they fell from their board.\n\nEvel Knievel - 1999\n\nA Gameboy Color title that casts players as the famous stunt performer of the same name, Evel Knievel was developed by Tarantula Studios (later rebranded as Rockstar Lincoln) and published by Rockstar. The game tasks the player with completing 20 death-defying stunts atop a bike.\n\nSurfing H30 - 2000\n\nA surfing game developed by Opus Corp and published internationally by Rockstar, Surfing H30 sees players take part in surfing tournaments where they try to amass high scores by performing tricks and other stylish maneuvers.\n\nAustin Powers: Oh, Behave! - 2000\n\nFresh off Evil Knievel, Tarantula Studios took on two Gameboy Color tie-ins for the revered British spy spoof franchise Austin Powers. The first of these games was Austin Powers: Oh, Behave, a collection of mini-games based on both Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. In the game, players take on the role of Austin Powers, reliving certain scenes from the films.\n\nAustin Powers: Welcome to my Underground Lair! - 2000\n\nThe second Austin Powers tie-in, Austin Powers: Welcome to My Underground Lair, launched on the same day and was a mirrored release of Austin Powers: Oh, Behave. Instead of playing mini-games from the perspective of Austin Powers, you played as his nemesis, Dr Evil. The games were functionally the same, however.\n\nMidnight Club: Street Racing - 2000\n\nOne of the first collaborations between Angel Games (later renamed Rockstar San Diego) and Rockstar, Midnight Club: Street Racing transported players to the streets of London and New York, tasking them with winning high-stakes street races to bolster their reputation. Boasting open-world maps that players could drive around freely, it spawned a franchise that fans are clamoring to see return today.\n\nSmuggler’s Run - 2000\n\nDeveloped in tandem with Midnight Club: Street Racing, Angel Games’ Smuggler’s Run sees players take control of a smuggler across several open-world levels. Using dune buggies, trucks, and other vehicles, you have to evade the law and make your deliveries. It was a success for Rockstar, with the publisher spinning up a sequel a year later.\n\nOni - 2001\n\nComing from Bungie West and published by Rockstar, Oni is a futuristic sci-fi action game with an anime art style. It centers around Konoko, a special agent who goes rogue after learning her superiors are brewing a sinister plot. Oni focuses primarily on hand-to-hand melee combat, with the player eventually able to engage in gunfights after unlocking ranged weapons.\n\nMax Payne - 2001\n\nAlthough technically published by Gathering of Developers, developer Remedy Entertainment later teamed with Rockstar to port its stylish noir shooter, Max Payne, to other consoles. Taking on the role of the eponymous hero as he seeks answers for his family’s death, Max Payne saw players run through the gritty streets of New York while using the now-iconic bullet time mechanic to kill enemies in slow-motion. Max Payne later became a fixture of Rockstar’s portfolio.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe Italian Job - 2001\n\nA video game adaptation of the iconic 1969 heist movie of the same name, The Italian Job was initially published by Sales Curve Interactive in 2001. Rockstar later took on publishing duties in North America, re-releasing the game to U.S. audiences a year later. It was an open-world driving game that saw players set up and complete the movie’s signature heist.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 3 - 2001\n\nArguably the beginning of Rockstar as we know it today, Grand Theft Auto 3 took the top-down sandbox action of its predecessors and switched it out for a 3D, third-person, open-world shooter, consequently launching the series into the stratosphere.\n\nPlaying as revenge-driven criminal Claude as he attempts to track down his former girlfriend and partner-in-crime, Catalina, GTA 3 saw players hijack cars, escape the law, and generally become a legendary career criminal on the streets of Liberty City. It formed the foundation of the series to come, paving the way for several major sequels and creating an explosion of interest in the open-world sandbox genre.\n\nSmuggler’s Run 2: Hostile Territory - 2001\n\nThe sequel to Angel Studios’ Smuggler’s Run, Smuggler’s Run 2: Hostile Territory offered players more of what they liked about the original. Much like before, you play as a smuggler, sneaking cargo across three maps with a variety of new and returning vehicles.\n\nState of Emergency - 2002\n\nA beat-em-up brawler with third-person shooter elements, VIS Entertainment’s State of Emergency saw players join violent riots in a cartoon world. Playing as one of five characters, they had to defeat enemies and complete missions using melee weapons, guns, and explosives.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City - 2002\n\nThe first of many follow-ups to Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City takes the 3D, open-world chaos of Rockstar North’s previous game and lets it loose on the streets of Vice City (GTA’s fictional take on Miami). Set in the 80s, players step into the role of Tommy Verceti, a gangster tasked with infiltrating the underworld crime scene of Vice City after a drug deal gone awry.\n\nMidnight Club 2 - 2003\n\nA sequel to Rockstar San Diego’s street racing hit, Midnight Club 2 gave players new races to conquer on the streets of LA, Paris, and Tokyo. Featuring bikes for the first time, the game was a major expansion on its predecessor.\n\nMax Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne - 2003\n\nThe sequel to Remedy Entertainment’s first Max Payne adventure was fully pulished by Rockstar. Picking the story back up as Max Payne returns to his job as a member of the New York Police Department, the game offers another gritty string of campaign missions and a variety of stylish, slow-motion shootouts. Max Payne 2 also introduced a second playable protagonist in Mona Sax.\n\nManhunt - 2003\n\nArguably the most controversial franchise Rockstar has ever produced, Rockstar North’s Manhunt cast players as James Earl Cash, a death row inmate forced to participate in disturbing snuff films to win his freedom. Focusing largely on stealth segments and grisly takedowns using makeshift weapons, the game was met with a series of protests against violence in video games; several British and American politicians called for it to be banned.\n\nRed Dead Revolver - 2004\n\nThe beginning of Rockstar’s now-beloved Red Dead series, Red Dead Revolver casts players as a bounty hunter named Red in the American Frontier. Although Revolver would go on to spawn two more successful sequels, it was largely different from its successors, with no open world to explore and a heavier focus on arcade action over realistic world-building and emotional storytelling.\n\nGrand Theft Auto Advance - 2004\n\nDigital Advance’s take on the Grand Theft Auto franchise, Grand Theft Auto Advance took Rockstar’s seminal open-world crime sandbox and reimagined it for the Game Boy Advance. Returning to the top-down action of the franchise's early games, Advance saw players take on the role of Mike, a Liberty City criminal seeking revenge for the death of his former partner.\n\nSee our picks for the best GBA games.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas - 2004\n\nReleasing in tandem with GTA: Advance, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was Rockstar North’s next mainline entry in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Telling the story of former gangster CJ as he returns home to the city of Los Santos, players are treated to the biggest GTA game yet, spanning three cities filled with missions to complete, crime families to battle, and chaos to sow. San Andreas went on to become an instant classic, still standing as many fans’ favorite entry to this day.\n\nMidnight Club 3 - 2005\n\nThe third entry in Rockstar San Diego’s racing franchise, Midnight Club 3 took players to Atlanta, Detroit, and the studio’s hometown of San Diego. Featuring more street races to complete and new customization options, it was the biggest Midnight Club experience to date.\n\nThe Warriors - 2005\n\nActing as both a prequel to and a retelling of the 1979 action film of the same name, Rockstar Toronto’s The Warriors was a melee-based beat-'em-up following a group of street thugs fleeing to Coney Island while pursued by the police and New York’s most violent gangs. Players brawl with other gangs in The Warriors universe while learning more about the characters and their lives prior to the events of the movie.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories - 2005\n\nThe series' second foray into handheld spin-offs, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories was developed by Rockstar North and Rockstar Leeds for Sony’s PSP. Following Tony Cipriani before he became involved with Claude in Grand Theft Auto 3, it was an open-world adventure that saw players complete jobs for Don Salvatore Leone.\n\nRockstar Games Presents Table Tennis - 2006\n\nA radical departure for a publisher that until that point had largely dealt in violent action games and sprawling open worlds, Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis is exactly what it sounds like: a game about ping pong. The company’s first game for the Xbox 360 acted as something of a tech demo for Rockstar's new RAGE engine, complete with state-of-the-art graphics for the time.\n\nBully - 2006\n\nAlso known as Canis Canem Edit in Europe, Bully took all the chaotic action of Grand Theft Auto and shifted it to a high school setting. Taking on the role of new kid Jimmy Hopkins as he’s sent to Bullsworth Academy, players find themselves exploring a rundown boarding school with classes to attend, cliques to infiltrate, and a lengthy story to play through.\n\nBully has become a legendary cult classic, in spite of its school setting drawing heavy controversy upon release. It was initially released for PS2 and later ported to the Xbox 360, Wii, and PC under the title Bully: Scholarship Edition.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories - 2006\n\nThe second of Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto PSP spin-offs, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories is a prequel to Vice City. It followed ex-soldier Vic Vance as he made his name on the streets of the titular metropolis, offering more open-world mayhem on Sony’s signature handheld device.\n\nManhunt 2 - 2007\n\nRockstar commissioned a sequel to its highly controversial stealth-focused action game, Manhunt. Manhunt 2 followed new protagonists Daniel Lamb and Leo Kaspar, allowing players to take on the roles of both characters as they once again fought to survive a hyper-violent string of disturbing snuff films.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 4 - 2008\n\nThe first iteration of Grand Theft Auto released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 generation of consoles, Rockstar North’s Grand Theft Auto 4 returned to the setting of Liberty City, casting players as Niko Bellic. Tasked with finding fortune and taking revenge on the sprawling metropolis’ streets, the story saw players rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, offering an exponentially more detailed and expansive open world. It would later receive two standalone expansions (more below).\n\nMidnight Club: Los Angeles - 2008\n\nMidnight Club: Los Angeles was the fourth (and currently final) entry in the Midnight Club series. Like the last game, it saw players work their way up to becoming a racing legend, this time cruising through the sunny streets of LA.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 4: The Lost and Damned - 2009\n\nThe first of two major expansions for Grand Theft Auto 4, The Lost and Damned tells the story of Johnny Klebitz, a leader for The Lost MC motorcycle gang that first appeared in the GTA 4's main campaign. Taking place alongside Niko Bellic’s story, The Lost and Damned introduced a whole new story and all-new side activities, seeing players manage the Lost MC and its members.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars - 2009\n\nIn another handheld collaboration between Rockstar North and Rockstar Leeds, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars brought GTA to the Nintendo DS. Returning to the top-down style of the first Grand Theft Auto games, players were slotted into the shoes of Huang Lee to help the Triads cement themselves as a major force in Liberty City.\n\nBeaterator - 2009\n\nA slight change in pace for the company, Rockstar Leeds moved away from Grand Theft Auto ports to create a music mixer for the PSP. Beaterator gave players the ability to create tracks and share them with friends. It was later released for iOS devices.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 4: The Ballad of Gay Tony - 2009\n\nThe final expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4, The Ballad of Gay Tony tells the story of Luis Lopez and sees players get thrust into the world of Liberty City's club scene, helping the titular Gay Tony battle off debt collectors, gangs, and rivals. It was once again set alongside the story of the main campaign, tying off several loose ends and officially wrapping up the story.\n\nSee our guide to the best GTA characters in the series.\n\nRed Dead Redemption - 2010\n\nYears after the team’s work on Red Dead Revolver, Rockstar San Diego decided to return to the franchise and deliver a sequel. Red Dead Redemption told the story of John Marston, a former outlaw tasked with hunting down his old gang after they left him for dead. Set in the final years of the Wild West, players trek across the American Frontier and Mexico, engaging in intense shootouts, killing outlaws, and living the cowboy fantasy.\n\nRed Dead Redemption was an instant classic that transformed Red Dead into a core part of Rockstar’s portfolio due to its emotional storytelling, unflinching and satirical representation of the American West, and hard-hitting action setpieces.\n\nRed Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare - 2010\n\nReturning to the game less than a year later, Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare reimagined the American West as a zombie-filled wasteland, telling an alternate-universe story in which John Marston returned from his mission right as an undead plague descended upon the land. Revisiting multiple characters from the main campaign, Marston has to put iconic enemies back in the grave while slaying zombie hordes and mythical creatures.\n\nThe expansion is often heralded as one of the best DLCs of all time, offering a fun and surprisingly meaty side campaign to dive into.\n\nL.A Noire - 2011\n\nCollaborating with Team Bondi in 2011, Rockstar published L.A Noire, a detailed detective game where players uncover mysteries, interrogate witnesses, and take down criminals. L.A Noire puts players in the role of LAPD detective Cole Phelps, who rises through the ranks of the police department while uncovering a sinister conspiracy. Featuring state-of-the-art motion capture technology for the time, it was a technical marvel upon release, even if it has become a fixture of meme culture in the years since.\n\nMax Payne 3 - 2012\n\nRemedy Entertainment handed the keys of the franchise over to Rockstar Games for the third installment, Max Payne 3. Taking the story from the grungey streets of New York to the sunny vistas of Brazil, Max Payne 3 was a completely new take on the series, seeing the titular revenge-driven protagonist shave his head and dive into a more serious story of money, murder, and shady underhand deals. Max tracks down two missing women through a haze of hyper-violent gunfights and dramatic monologues.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 5 - 2013\n\nRockstar’s most successful games and one of the most successful media products of all time, Grand Theft Auto 5 launched at the end of the Xbox 360 and PS3 lifecycle (and was then re-released on the next two console generations). The fifth mainline installment in the franchise saw players take on the roles of Franklin, Michael, and Trevor, three career criminals that come together to stage elaborate heists across the city of Los Santos.\n\nAllowing players to jump between any of the three characters at the push of a button, Grand Theft Auto 5 offered open-world chaos on an unprecedented scale, creating a hyper-detailed city filled with crimes to commit, missions to complete, and money to make.\n\nGrand Theft Auto Online - 2013\n\nInitially acting as a component of Grand Theft Auto 5 before becoming a standalone experience in 2022, Grand Theft Auto Online offers players a live-service take on the world of GTA. Given free rein to cause chaos with friends around Los Santos, players can find missions, PvP matches, races, and near-endless other activities to take part in as they level up their avatars and attempt to become a fixture of the city’s criminal underworld.\n\nL.A Noire: The VR Case Files - 2017\n\nL.A Noire: The VR Case Files is exactly what its title suggests: a rendition of some of L.A Noire’s most memorable cases playable with a VR headset. Remaking seven mysteries for the player to solve, The VR Case Files allows players to interact with clues, interrogate witnesses, and make arrests while fully immersed in virtual reality.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 - 2018\n\nA sequel to Rockstar San Diego’s smash-hit Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption 2 acted as a prequel to the original game, telling the story of Dutch Van Der Linde’s gang shortly before it was disbanded. Playing as outlaw Arthur Morgan, Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of Rockstar’s most involved storytelling experiences to date, spinning a tale about greed, brotherhood, and betrayal set against the backdrop of the American Frontier.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 went on to become another hit for Rockstar, with players praising its superb writing and the amazing attention to detail in its vast open-world.\n\nRed Dead Online - 2018\n\nMuch like with Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2’s multiplayer component, Red Dead Online, became a standalone experience after release. Allowing players to create their own outlaw, they are free to explore the American Frontier, join gangs, and complete missions to level up their cowboy.\n\nUpcoming Rockstar Games\n\nRockstar has confirmed two projects in the pipeline: Grand Theft Auto 6 and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.
