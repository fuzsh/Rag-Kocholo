        "text": "In 1996, in Brantford, New Hampshire, teenager Alex Vreeke (Mason Guccione / Colin Hanks) receives the Jumanji board game, found by his father on a beach. When Alex refused it, the game magically transforms into a video game cartridge. When he plays it, he is Teleported into the game.\n\nTwenty years later in 2016, four students in Brantford High School are placed in detention together: Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff), who was caught writing essays for his former friend, Anthony \"Fridge\" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain) (who is also in detention for the plagiarism), while Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman) and Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner) have both disrespected their respective teachers during class. They were ridiculed for their actions and are assigned by the school's principal (Marc Evan Jackson) to clear out its basement, the four find Jumanji, a multiplayer action-adventure video game. One of the playable characters (video game avatars) is inaccessible. When Spencer hits Start, the four are sucked into the game.\n\nThey find themselves in a jungle, each now in the forms of their game avatars. Spencer is a tough, muscular explorer named Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) (an archaeologist and explorer who is Spencer's avatar. Bravestone's strengths are stamina, courage, reflexes, climbing, smoldering charisma, and boomerang throwing. He apparently has no weaknesses. He is the Archetypically masculine, intelligent, and courageous video game hero of the story)\n\nFridge is a short zoologist named Franklin \"Mouse\" Finbar (Kevin Hart) (whom he had selected upon misreading the name as \"Moose\") (a short zoologist and weapons specialist who is Fridge's avatar. Finbar is Bravestone's weapon valet and is skilled in cranial assault. His weaknesses are cake, strength, and speed)\n\nMartha is a gorgeous commando and martial art expert named Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan). (a commando, martial artist, and dance fighter who is Martha's avatar. Roundhouse is proficient in karate, Tai Chi, jujitsu and Capoeira, and her only weakness is venom, such as that found in various animals in the game. Similar to Bravestone, Roundhouse is the Archetypically intelligent, athletic, beautiful, and scantily clad video game heroine of the story)\n\nBethany is an overweight, male cartographer named Professor Sheldon \"Shelly\" Oberon (Jack Black) (a cartographer, cryptographer, archaeologist and paleontologist who is Bethany's avatar. Though Oberon's strengths are his fields of expertise, because of his obesity, his endurance is his weakness)\n\nThey soon realize that they are in a video game, and each have three lives. If they lose all three, they will actually die. Each of their avatars also comes with special skills and weaknesses. They learn from Nigel (Rhys Darby), an NPC guide, that the big-game hunter, Russel Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), wants to obtain a jewel, the \"Jaguar's Eye\", allowing him to manipulate Jumanji's animals. To escape the game, the players must return it to an enormous jaguar statue and call out \"Jumanji\". Along the way, the group begins to lose lives through various means when completing game levels. The group start working together to obtain a clue from a snake but are cornered by Van Pelt's men. They are rescued by Alex, the fifth player, whose avatar is a pilot named Jefferson \"Seaplane\" McDonough (Nick Jonas).\n\nRecuperating in a tree-house built by previous player Alan Parrish (protagonist of Jumanji), Alex learns that he has been in the game for twenty years and the newcomers vow to help him return home. They commandeer a helicopter and fly for the jaguar statue to return the jewel. Upon landing Alex loses his last life after a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs CPR in time and transfers one of her lives to Alex in the process, saving him from dying.\n\nArriving at the statue, the players find themselves facing Van Pelt's forces and predatory guards. Using their resources and teamwork, the players distract the villains while Spencer returns the jewel to the statue and calls out the game's name. The game ends, disintegrating Van Pelt into many rats, and the players revert to their former selves and return to the real world but discover that Alex did not come with them. On their way home, they discover that the Vreeke household - once the neglected home of Alex's father \"Old Man\" Vreeke - has been restored. An adult Alex appears; he returned to 1996, and history was changed. He is now married and has named his eldest daughter after Bethany out of gratitude for saving his life.\n\nSpencer and Fridge reconcile, Bethany becomes a better person and makes plans to go backpacking for another adventurous encounter, Martha starts dating Spencer, and the teens are now friends after their experiences in the game. The four hear Jumanji's drumbeats, but they take the game behind the school and destroy it with the bowling ball they found in detention to prevent anyone from playing it again."
