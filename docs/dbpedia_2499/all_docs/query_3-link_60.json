        "text": "Richard used to feel as if his only options upon graduation were either teaching or law. However, his first term working for the Ubyssey taught him otherwise – that he could get paid for taking photographs!\n\nRichard graduated from UBC in 1997 with a BA in Political Science (major) and History (minor). He decided to concentrate on these subject areas out of genuine interest and planned to apply his studies towards a career in teaching.\n\nAs a second year Arts student, he was worried about job prospects with his degree, especially since many of his friends were graduating from BCIT with specific job training. He felt his only options were teaching or law. However, his first term working for the Ubyssey taught him otherwise – that he could get paid for being a photographer!\n\nFrom second year onwards, Richard became increasingly involved with the Ubyssey, first as a volunteer and then in a paid position as Photo Editor. He also joined the Photo Club and became involved with intramural sports.\n\nAside from his on-campus involvement, he further clarified his career goals by interviewing and talking with other freelance photographers. These combined experience helped to better prepare him for a career in the journalism industry. He is now the sole proprietor of his Freelance Photography business and the main freelancer in BC for the Canadian Press.\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing a similar career path, Richard suggests refining your photography skills, getting feedback from professionals, learning business sense, and getting involved with a student newspaper or Photo Club.\n\nWhy did you choose UBC?\n\nIt was the local or ‘home’ school. I got into other universities, but UBC replied first, and it made the most sense practically.\n\nWhen did you start post-secondary education?\n\n1992, the September following high school graduation.\n\nWhen did you graduate from UBC?\n\n1997, I took five years to complete my degree. Some terms I took four or five courses, and in others I took three.\n\nHow did you choose your major?\n\nI stumbled into it. I took classes my friends were taking, and I had an interest in government and politics. I chose history as a minor in third year when I thought I was interested in Education. I needed to have a concentration in a teachable subject of study, so History fit with my thoughts of being a Social Sciences high school teacher at that time.\n\nDid you ever change your mind about your Major/Minor?\n\nYes, I also had an interest in landscape architecture, but at that point I decided it was too late, and that I was too far along in my degree to change and start over again. There would have been lots of required courses and I would have had to go back into first year, and I didn’t want to do that.\n\nWhy did you decide to major in the subjects you chose?\n\nI had a genuine interest in the subjects, so I took the courses that I liked.\n\nDid you have an idea of what you would do after graduation?\n\nYes, I thought of law and education, but then started doing photography as a volunteer at the Ubyssey and loved it. After my first term of working at the student paper, I realized I could get paid for doing this and I wanted to pursue my dream.\n\nWhy did you think of Law and Education?\n\nI had been a counselor in teen youth groups and coached hockey, so I thought I might enjoy being a high school teacher. I thought of law as being a good stepping-stone to being employed in a company’s upper management.\n\nMany arts students seem to consider those same options, thinking that those are the only professional options that exist for BA grads. Was this a factor for you too?\n\nYes, especially after second year, I was worried. I had only worked in construction and I had no sales or marketing experience anywhere. I thought \"what next?\"\n\nMy sister went back to school after working as a bank teller, finished her degree and went back to a job as a bank teller with a degree. I believed that an Arts degree was worth something, but I didn’t know what.\n\nWhat were your other interests in high school? University?\n\nPhotography was always at the back of my mind, but I never pursued it in high school. I enjoyed hockey, and hoped to land a sports scholarship that would put me through university, but it didn’t work out.\n\nWere you involved in any extra-curricular activities while at UBC?\n\nI did some intramural sports and got into photography by joining the Photo Club.\n\nIf so, how did you choose those activities?\n\nI liked to play hockey and be active…the Photo Club became the basis of my social life while at UBC, especially after third year when I volunteered and then worked at the Ubyssey.\n\nDid involvement in activities help you gain experience or skills that helped you to find or secure your current job?\n\nYes, absolutely! All of my learning was on the job. There was no formal training, all hands-on experience, and being involved has been the key.\n\nIt was through the Photo Club that another club member encouraged me to volunteer at the Ubyssey, which was a great experience. My friend also prompted me to apply for the job of Photo Editor when it came up at the Ubyssey and I took his advice and applied for and got the job.\n\nWas volunteering a factor in getting hired there?\n\nYes, it was the turning point. I wouldn’t have been qualified otherwise, they knew me and knew my work, and I was right there when they needed someone.\n\nDid you ever feel afraid or worried about what kind of career or work you could find with a BA?\n\nYes! Especially early on because many of my friends went to BCIT, which is a focused job training institution. These friends were finished after two years and looking for work as I was just heading into 3rd year. It was around that time though, that I got more involved in photography and the rest is history.\n\nDid you plan to be where you are now career-wise?\n\nNo, not when I first started. After I graduated, I learned what it takes to be a freelance photographer. I knew it would be a small business and I decided to go for it and give myself three years to make it.\n\nHow important were your grades in terms of landing your current job?\n\nNot important. I learned very quickly that an Arts degree is not like an Engineering degree, for example, where grades are very important to employers. No one had ever asked me in a job interview or work setting what kind of grades I got in university. Just having the degree completed was useful.\n\nWhat is your job title?\n\nFreelance Photographer.\n\nWhat other job titles have you had leading up to this one?\n\nPhoto Editor at the Ubyssey. Before that, I was a volunteer photographer and before that I had been a laborer.\n\nCan you give me an overview of your job description and some of the day-to-day tasks?\n\nI do corporate photography and specialize in Editorial work, but you name it, I’ll shoot it. As I’m the sole proprietor of the business, there’s also lots of computer work, business skills, paperwork, negotiation skills, self-promotion, and cold calling. I use the Internet a lot to research and find contacts who might be interested in my work.\n\nDo you think you developed any of these skills as an Arts student?\n\nYes, the BA taught me how to think imaginatively and independently, to use creativity and stay self-motivated.\n\nWhat aspects of the job are most important and satisfying to you?\n\nVariety. I do something different every day. Sometimes I know I have upcoming work months in advance. Sometimes it’s literally minute by minute or day by day. I’m okay with the uncertainty.\n\nWhat aspects are least satisfying to you?\n\nAt the beginning, not knowing when the next paycheck would be. Rejection was also more difficult in the beginning.\n\nHow long have you been in business?\n\n1999 to 2004. After graduation I continued at the Ubyssey for one more year and took English 301, a business and technical writing course that was very useful and practical.\n\nHow did you support yourself at the beginning?\n\nI was still living at home, and received $500 stipend for working at the Ubyssey, but my parents’ help was important. Three years ago, in 2001, I secured an agreement with Canadian Press as their main freelancer in BC.\n\nThey have only one staff member in Vancouver, who I serve as back-up for. When he’s called away out of town or on vacation, I have guaranteed work. It’s been my main bread-and-butter for the last three years. Although there’s only work when there’s news that sparks national attention.\n\nHow did you land this agreement?\n\nPersistence. The guy who was doing this job previously moved on to the Province Newspaper, so I called the staff photographer and pestered him until he agreed to meet with me. I bought a digital camera and was working within a few days after that.\n\nIf there were some aspects of the job you could change, what would they be?\n\nMore job security, benefits, vacation pay.\n\nDid you know before you started the job what it would be like?\n\nYes. My father is self-employed as a Chartered Accountant, so I knew the benefits and drawbacks right away of being your own boss. No medical or dental, no set vacation. He helped me to learn the paperwork side too!\n\nHow did you do your research?\n\nI interviewed and talked to other freelance photographers. There weren’t many mentors really, but I met with people after school for coffee to talk about what I was getting myself into. That was quite helpful.\n\nI am now a mentor for the Ubyssey staff and volunteers because I never had one and it would have been easier if I had.\n\nWhat salary range could most BA graduates expect in this field?\n\n$30,000 -$40,000 per annum, but it can be higher or lower depending on how much hustling you do and what type of photography you do. Many paparazzi earn six figures. For me, as an Editorial specialist, I’m not rich but I’m happy.\n\nWhat would you recommend that students interested in this field do while in school to better their chances of finding work in this field?\n\nRefine your photography skills, learn business sense, and get involved with a student newspaper or UBC Photo Club. Just be taking lots of pictures and, most importantly, ask for feedback.\n\nBe pro-active, show your work, and ask professionals for feedback. I went to a photographers’ conference and got help, and the business manager at the Ubyssey newspaper was really helpful too.\n\nWhat is the worst thing a student could do?\n\nBe lazy and unmotivated. Just going to classes and not getting involved. Not being willing to grow and stretch limits. Stagnancy shows up and really stands out in photography.\n\nLooking back, is there anything you would do differently while at university?\n\nThe thing I kick myself over is not getting involved earlier in Photo Club. I knew I liked taking pictures as a kid, but in high school I didn’t have time to get seriously involved.\n\nPhoto Club was great, it had a low annual membership fee, I met more people who had a common interest, got more information, took pictures, learned along the way, and then started getting paid for it.\n\nAny advice to current students?\n\nFind a focus or niche, develop it, and work hard at it. The job market can be competitive, so seize opportunities as they can go by quickly.\n\nIn my case, I had graduated and signed up at Loyalist College in Belleville Ontario for a photojournalist diploma. But when the opportunity at Canadian Press came up I jumped on it and left the program only three weeks after it started to sign on.\n\nWhat I learned in that few weeks of photojournalism college was that I already had the skills I needed to make it on my own and that the course material was redundant.\n\nThis really helped boost my confidence because I had already developed the skills through my Bachelor’s degree and my volunteer and paid work experience. All that I needed to do next was believe in my goal and make it happen.\n\nJonathon found that a BA plus self-confidence goes a long way.\n\nJonathan graduated from UBC in 1998 with a BA in Economics. Since the summer after his first year at UBC, he worked part-time in the banking industry.\n\nThrough this work experience he gained great clarity and confidence that this was the right field for him. He has set future career goals for himself such as being in management and joining the executive ranks. He currently balances his life by regularly indulging in the arts and sitting on the Board of Directors of non-profit organizations in our community.\n\nWhen he graduated, he had a clear idea of what he wanted to do because of his work experience and networking contacts. In fact, it was largely through such contacts that he secured his current position as a Financial Advisor for CIBC Imperial Service. In addition, he has been able to strengthen his business relations and develop rapport through his clients’ shared appreciation of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (VSO).\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing a similar career path, Jonathan recommends that you take the Canadian Securities Course by correspondence while you are at university and that you gain experience with entry-level positions as a Teller or Customer Service Representative. In his experience, if you combine hard work and networking, you will be well on your way to jump-starting an exciting career!\n\nWhat is your job title?\n\nFinancial Advisor, CIBC Imperial Service / CIBC Investor Services Inc.\n\nWhat other job titles have you had leading up to this one?\n\nCustomer Service Representative; Financial Services Officer; Financial Services Manager\n\nCan you give me an overview of your job description and some of the day-to-day tasks?\n\nI manage a portfolio of approximately $100 million made up of approximately 1200 clients. I provide financial advice concerning all aspects of my clients’ financial health such as cash flow, credit, investments, and protection planning. I strive to find a balance between portfolio profitability and growth.\n\nMy daily tasks include: contacting clients to identify their immediate needs, uncovering future business opportunities, obtaining referrals, approval of loans and mortgages, making investment recommendations, and some paperwork. In a nutshell, I help clients fulfill their dreams and achieve their desired lifestyle.\n\nWhat aspects of the job are most important and satisfying to you?\n\nFirst, I enjoy dealing with clients from various backgrounds and experiences. I have made friendships that will last a lifetime. In fact, I have been invited to be the master of ceremonies at a client’s wedding this December, which is a huge honour.\n\nSecond, I’ve been given a huge responsibility and managing a portfolio of this size is financially rewarding.\n\nWhat aspects are least satisfying to you?\n\nAdministrative tasks such as paperwork.\n\nDid you know before you started the job what it would be like?\n\nYes, I had a clear picture because of my networking contacts at the Bank of Montreal, and that is also how I got my current job. My previous Assistant Branch Manager at Bank of Montreal became a General Manger with CIBC Imperial Service and he told me all about the job before I applied. Networking was a huge factor in my landing this job, as it is in many industries.\n\nIs this the type of job you see yourself in long term?\n\nI hope to one day coach and motivate a sales team of my own so that they may be successful. I strive to become an effective leader within the organization.\n\nWhat salary range could most BA graduates expect in this field?\n\nEntry-level employees (ie. customer service representatives and personal bankers), typically earn between $20,000 – $35,000.\n\nAt the financial advisor level, although I can’t disclose any figures, there is a reasonable base salary plus performance bonuses that can be quite substantial.\n\nHow long have you been working here?\n\nFour and a half years in this particular job with CIBC Imperial Service, but I’ve worked in the banking industry for over nine years.\n\nWhy did you choose UBC?\n\nI always knew I’d either go to UBC or SFU. I chose UBC because in my mind it was a bigger, better university and I thought it would carry more recognition and prestige that would benefit me long-term.\n\nWhen did you start post-secondary education?\n\nSeptember 1994, immediately after graduating from high school.\n\nWhen did you graduate from UBC?\n\nIn November 1998.\n\nHow did you choose your major?\n\nI went back and forth on that decision for a while. In my first year I took courses in pre-Commerce, as I thought I might go into Accounting. However, I also took courses in Economics and Philosophy and after deciding that Accounting wasn’t for me, my choice in major came down to those two.\n\nI really enjoyed both, but decided that Economics would give me a better foundation, as I knew that I would work in the business sector after I graduated.\n\nDid you ever change your mind about your Major/Minor?\n\nYes. As I said earlier, it came down to a choice between Economics and Philosophy. At the end of my third year, I declared my major in Economics and was happy with that choice.\n\nI also discovered Theatre in third year and decided to take a number of elective courses in that because acting has always been a passion of mine.\n\nWhy did you decide to major in the subject you chose?\n\nI thought that Economics would have more of a real world application in my case, because I knew I wanted to go into banking and finance. I had been working at the Bank of Montreal since the summer after my first year at UBC. I knew early on that I was in the right industry for me.\n\nDid you have an idea of what you would do after graduation?\n\nYes, it was very clear. While working at the bank, I knew I wanted to be part of the sales team and eventually in management, so it was a matter of moving up the corporate ladder by networking and taking applicable courses, both inside and outside of those required by my major.\n\nWhat did you think were the options for BA graduates?\n\nI thought the world was available to me and that anything was possible. I still believe that to be true.\n\nWhat were your other interests in high school? University?\n\nI really enjoyed theatre back in high school and went back to it in third-year university. I am also interested in the VSO, all kinds of expressions of music, and the arts.\n\nWere you involved in any extra-curricular activities while at UBC?\n\nI was involved with the Filipino Student Association (FSA). I took part in a few planning activities for events, but didn’t have much time to devote to that group as I was also working part-time. I also spent time socializing and developing friendships on campus with the new people I met in my classes.\n\nDid involvement in extra-curricular activity help you gain experience or skills that helped you to find or secure your current job?\n\nI think so. My recent appreciation of the VSO has helped me to relate to my clients better. I often see them at the symphony and that has helped me to develop rapport and strengthen business links.\n\nDid you ever feel afraid or worried about what kind of career or work you could find with a BA?\n\nNo. I felt pretty confident.\n\nDid you plan to be where you are now career-wise?\n\nAt this point in my life, yes.\n\nHow important were your grades in terms of landing your current job?\n\nNot as important as I thought. Employers are more concerned about the fact that you’ve completed your BA, as doing so guarantees them that you have refined learning skills. I thought that grades were very important. I got straight A’s in high school, but not in university.\n\nHowever, it never came up in an interview. I think it’s much more important to be sociable, confident, and to be able to show that you can apply your skills. There must be a balance between academic performance and what practical skills you can bring to the workplace.\n\nWhat skills from your Arts degree did you bring to your current job?\n\nMulti-tasking, time management, prioritizing, effective communication, and the ability to compartmentalize ideas.\n\nIs this the kind of job that someone with a Bachelor’s degree can do?\n\nYes, absolutely. You can enter the banking industry as a Customer Service Representative while you are a student, like I did. Then if you express an interest in developing a career in banking, you can be sponsored to take the Canadian Securities course, a job requirement.\n\nIf you show enthusiasm, confidence and aptitude, believe me, Human Resources will be interested in moving you forward.\n\nWhat would you recommend that students interested in this field do while in school to better their chances of finding work in this field?\n\nTo do my job, you must be licensed as an Investment Advisor, and to get licensed, the first step is to have passed the Canadian Securities course.\n\nI would recommend beginning the Canadian Securities course while in university if you can. Commerce and Economics majors may find that some of the information overlaps with course material, but it really helps to understand the information as it can jump-start your career.\n\nAlso, look for entry-level positions as a Customer Service Representative, then work hard, be driven, and expand your network. It’s a small community and those in management will take notice.\n\nWhat is the worst thing a student could do?\n\nJust stay home and study. It’s like dating – if you want to be in a relationship, you have to get out there. Career development is no different. Make contacts, get involved, gain confidence… put yourself out there and you can’t go wrong.\n\nLooking back, is there anything you would do differently while at university?\n\nI think I might have pursued a minor in a different department. It is always better to be well-rounded academically by having a background in different fields.\n\nAny advice to current students?\n\nKeep your options open. Don’t think you are limited by your choice of discipline. Your Bachelor of Arts skills, specifically your ability to learn and adapt to constantly changing environments, are transferable to all kinds of sectors, so don’t let that stand in your way.\n\nIdentify what motivates you, be passionate in what you do, be confident about your abilities, and ask questions. Get out there and explore!\n\nTaking advantage of each opportunity, Anne carved a path out for herself, creating positions that had previously never existed.\n\nAnne graduated from UBC in 1990 with a BA in Political Science. She developed an interest in history and politics from her father, so Political Science always felt like a natural fit. Aside from her studies, Anne played intramural volleyball and soccer and loved to spend time socializing with her friends in residence and at the Pit.\n\nBefore working with Ovarian Cancer Canada, Anne held many positions including Media and Events Coordinator for the Injury Prevention Centre at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) as well as a position developing Media Relations for Muscular Dystrophy Canada. She says she wasn’t sure which career path to follow after graduation but through her various jobs was able to figure out what she liked to do and how to do it.\n\nAs Manager of Awareness for Ovarian Cancer Canada, Anne is in charge of media relations and works closely with members of the media as well as advertising agencies to build awareness surrounding the needs and goals of her organization.\n\nShe suggests that students looking for a career in media relations capitalize on networking opportunities by volunteering for the organization or company they are interested in working with.\n\nWhat is your current job title?\n\nManager of Awareness for Ovarian Cancer Canada\n\nWhat previous positions led you to this one?\n\nCorporate and Media Relations Development for Western Canada for Muscular Dystrophy Canada;\n\nCoordinator of Safe-start Injury Prevention Program at Children’s Hospital;\n\nMedia and Events Coordinator for BC Injury Prevention Centre out of Vancouver General Hospital;\n\nMarketing Representative for McDonald’s Restaurants of Canada (found in the student employment centre on UBC Campus)\n\nHow did you find and secure your current job?\n\nBy word of mouth from a former colleague at Children’s Hospital who mentioned to me Ovarian Cancer Canada was hiring. Many of the positions I’ve had are the result of networking. The types of people who recommend you tend to know where you will fit so it works out well.\n\nWhat is your job description?\n\nThis organization is really small, but has recently received funding to expand. My role is to develop an organized national awareness plan in order to increase membership and support.\n\nCan you give me an overview of a typical work day?\n\nI handle media relations. For example, I send out press releases for upcoming events and I handle general questions from the media regarding the organization’s position on specific issues. Recently, I have been working with ad agencies and other experts who assist me in making decisions regarding how to approach specific audiences.\n\nWhat aspects of your job are most important and satisfying?\n\nThe fact that I believe in what I am doing and passionate about it is very satisfying. Throughout my career I have always excelled when I believe I am making a difference. Some people go to work and do their job regardless, but I really need to believe in it. I feel it is important for anyone considering this field.\n\nIf they really believe in the cause, other people are going to pick up on it.\n\nAnother satisfying aspect about my job is being able to do something like a media interview or getting a story out there that saves somebody’s life. At the end of the day, you go home and feel like you’ve actually made a difference and that’s very satisfying.\n\nWhat aspects are least satisfying?\n\nI don’t really fit well into the 9 to 5 box. I’ve always loved to be independent because sometimes I’ll get inspiration at night and I’ll be at work until 8.\n\nIf there’s anything you could change about your job, what would it be?\n\nNo, this job is great. It’s a small group environment and I really enjoy that.\n\nBefore you started did you know what the job would be like?\n\nNo. But every single job that I’ve had, I was hired to create something that didn’t exist. At McDonald’s, I created a brand new community marketing program. It had never been done before, so we started from scratch. I’ve never been hired into an existing role to continue where someone left off. It’s interesting. I enjoy the challenge.\n\nHow did research your current position and organization?\n\nA colleague of mine at Children’s Hospital told me a little bit about the position. She knows me really well over a couple of years so I had a good feeling about it.\n\nAlso my Grandmother died of Ovarian Cancer so I knew it was something I would be passionate about. Up until last July, there was only one person running the organization.\n\nWhat salary range could a BA graduate expect in this field?\n\nI would say a manager of a fairly small charity could expect to make from $40,000 – 45,000. If you’re trying to break in, you’re probably looking to start around $32,000 – 38,000.\n\nWhat would you recommend that students interested in this field do while they’re in school to better their chances of finding work?\n\nIf you are interested in something, go check it out yourself. Originally I wanted work in the media, so I volunteered as an intern at CTV news. After that experience, I realized that I didn’t really like working in the media.\n\nTry to volunteer at the charities where you’d like to work. It’s not always easy but if you can get in, you are going to meet the people that will do the hiring.\n\nCo-op programs are also a great opportunity. Even if it’s not a lucrative position in the short term, it may be a really valuable networking experience.\n\nWhat skills from your Arts degree helped you to create or find your current job?\n\nWriting essays was great practice. Being able to take a lot of information and condense it into something manageable is a valuable skill. You also learn a lot of discipline at university. There’s a lot of pressure and it’s not always easy to juggle your social life and school work.\n\nAn Arts degree is great because it gives you a solid foundation. Being a generalist can be a pretty marketable thing; I would recommend going beyond that and taking advantage of post-graduate opportunities.\n\nIs this a job that someone with a BA could easily do?\n\nIt’s a job that anyone can do if they are passionate about it, really believed in the cause, and have the right skill sets.\n\nWhy did you choose UBC?\n\nI was born and raised in the interior and came from a very small town. But there was no question that I was going to UBC. It is an elite school and has a residential program so I was able to live on campus.\n\nWhen did you start your post-secondary education?\n\nImmediately after high school.\n\nHow did you choose a major?\n\nMy father was a Grade 12 history teacher and was passionate about history and politics. I was exposed to a lot of that growing up. So by the time I got to UBC, I was really interested and it was a natural fit. I gravitated towards 20th century American history because I was always fascinated about American government and culture.\n\nDid you ever change your mind about your Major?\n\nI started out in History and switched to Political Science. It just sounded better. Looking back, it was kind of a superficial decision.\n\nHave you taken any post-graduate courses?\n\nWhen I went to work at the Children’s Hospital – I took a week-long course at the Health Policy Research Institute. I needed to learn the specifics around research into injuries and population health.\n\nI also needed to get specific training so I could talk with people in the industry. If there is a specific area that the organization focuses on and you don’t have any expertise, there are plenty of places to go and get some basic training.\n\nDid you have an idea of what to do career-wise after graduation?\n\nNot really, one of the reasons I chose Arts was so I would have some options.\n\nWhat did you think your options were as a graduate with a BA?\n\nI didn’t really know where I was going to end up. And I don’t think that everyone should know when they’re 20. The people I know who have been really successful never knew what they wanted to do. I think if you do what you like to do you will end up doing well.\n\nHave any faculty or staff members influenced you along the way?\n\nOne of my history professors was hugely influential because he was so passionate about what he was teaching. He influenced me from a presentation perspective.\n\nAnother influence was a woman I met while I was working on the sports paper who taught me editing and basic skills to use around the media.\n\nWhat were your non-academic interests in high school and university?\n\nI played competitive classical piano throughout elementary and high school. I actually competed at UBC!\n\nWhat extracurricular activities were you involved in while at UBC?\n\nI was quite involved in intramural sports at UBC; volleyball and soccer. And I went to the Pit. (laughs)\n\nHow did you choose these activities?\n\nThe people on my floor in residence encouraged me to sign up for a lot of activities. Had I lived at home, I wouldn’t have had the same experience. And I’m still great friends with a lot of the people I lived with in residence.\n\nHas your involvement helped you to gain experience or skills transferable to your current job?\n\nI was pretty shy when I first came to school. I didn’t have big groups of friends or anything like that. So I think the biggest gift UBC gave me was the opportunity to meet all sorts of different people and come out of my shell. I left UBC with way better communication and teamwork skills than I had in high school.\n\nWere you ever worried or afraid about what kind of work was available after graduating with a BA?\n\nOh yeah. I think we all are. I thought I wasn’t going to have a job and didn’t know what I was going to do. I’ve found that the economy can be a huge issue too. If you’re coming out of school at a time when there are no jobs it’s going to be a lot harder.\n\nSo, as a student, you can’t beat yourself up and say that you don’t have a job because you’re not good enough. When you see an opportunity to get out there and get some work, you have to pursue it.\n\nWhat steps brought you to your current career?\n\nI got a mentor.\n\nI made a big point of asking for help. I wasn’t afraid of going to my boss and saying “I don’t know how to do this.”\n\nI made sure that I got involved with big organizations. There were lots of opportunities to work for smaller ones, but I went for one that had good credentials, a lot of potential, or somebody in the organization I thought was going to be able to teach me a lot. The only reason I am here is because of the caliber of the organizations I have worked with over the years.\n\nDid you plan to be where you are now career-wise?\n\nNot until half-way through my career at Children’s Hospital did I realize this was really what I liked to do. It took a while for me to figure out where I wanted to go and how I was going to do it.\n\nHow important were grades in terms of landing your current job?\n\nNot at all, which is good because while I was at UBC I focused a lot of time on extracurricular activities. Of course I had to work hard, but I wanted to make sure that I had fun as well. In my job I rely a lot on flair and confidence which are skills I was able to pick up from socializing and networking.\n\nWhat is the worst thing a student could do with respect to working in this field?\n\nDon’t be cocky. It’s not a good idea to push yourself and your opinions too hard onto others until you have some experience under your belt. Then you can say, “Well I have the experience, and therefore I’m going to say this.”\n\nLooking back, is there anything you would have done differently while at UBC?\n\nIf I could do it over again, I would have done an international internship somewhere. I would encourage anyone to do that.\n\nI didn’t really plan well when I got in either. I never took the time to sit down with anyone and plan out my courses. I would never do that kind of thing now.\n\nAlso, I might have gone back sooner and done an MBA. I think once you’ve been out of it for a long time, it becomes very difficult to go back."
