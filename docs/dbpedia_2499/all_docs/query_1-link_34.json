        "text": "Rating: 3 stars\n\nA morte e ritorno. My family’s motto circles in my mind as I look this problem dead on and try to figure it out. I’ve faced worse than this. Survived worse odds than this. I won’t let this failure break me.\n\nWe have 72 hours to turn this around. 72 hours to make a new plan out of the dregs of the old. 72 hours until all hope is lost.\n\nThis task is impossible, but I still like my chances. I have an ace in my pocket and his name is Mason Cain. He might not want to help me, but I don’t plan on giving him a choice in the matter.\n\nMy name is Rosalie Oscura. And I refuse to let anything beat me.\n\nThis series is set in the world of Solaria five years after Zodiac Academy and ten years after Dark Fae and book one was previously published as Darkmore Penitentiary. There is some character crossover but all series can be read independent of each other without spoilers. The female lead will end up with more than one love interest.\n\nIn comparison to the rest of the books in this series, Feral Wolf felt like a slow read to me. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed what I read, but the pacing of it just didn’t fit in to me like its predecessors.\n\nWhat I did enjoy about this book though was seeing how these characters would now deal with the current obstacle that stood in their way: time. All of Rosalie’s plans to get out of Darkmore Penitentiary were now ruined and time was of the essence if she wanted to get out of the prison along with those who she promised to take with her. And it was interesting to see how all of these characters would come together to make what seemed almost impossible possible.\n\nWhat I also enjoyed about Feral Wolf was continuing to see Rosalie’s relationships with the guys continue to develop. I was glad to finally see both Ethan and Roary do what they should’ve done when it came to their relationship with Rosalie since the beginning. I also enjoyed seeing her relationships with all of these guys and how they all seemed like they were finally starting to accept that she needed all of them in her life. And I especially enjoyed getting a little more backstory into Cain’s dark past as I feel like we did get some snippets in the previous books, but what gets discovered here I feel like helped me understand his character even better.\n\nWhile I wasn’t overall a fan of the way this book ends, I knew that there had to be more to what was going on in Psych that was going to play a role in these books. So when the ending takes the turn it does, even though I hate it, I also found myself intrigued by it. I knew that there would be more involved with it than this book originally made me believe. So while I’m overall displeased with the way this book has ended, I’m also intrigued to see where things will go in the next book in this series when it comes out.\n\nHowever, there is quite a lot about this book that I didn’t enjoy as much as the rest of the books in this series. I love Sin Wilder’s character because he’s very different from the rest of the characters in this series, and I can see how much he cares about Rosalie which is something even he wasn’t expecting. But I feel like I can agree with the rest of the characters in this series in that he doesn’t always make the best decisions that help Rosalie with her plans to help him escape. I feel like there’s something in each of the books in this series so far that he’s done that’s caused her more trouble than its worth. And what he did in this book in comparison to the others I wasn’t at all pleased about. So while I do like his character and he has developed quite a bit since Rosalie first met him, his antics in this book struck a nerve with me more so than the other books in this series. I still love his character though so I’m hoping this is just a fluke for me with regards to this book.\n\nWhat I also didn’t enjoy in Feral Wolf was the overall pacing of this book. Rosalie and her crew only had a short amount of time to get out of Darkmore Penitentiary. But I felt like most of the book was spent with her and the guys screwing around instead of coming up with another plan to get out of the prison. Yes, I know things were made complicated by what happened in this book so she and everyone else had to figure out how to work around the obstacles that were now in their way. But at the same time, I don’t feel like they moved forward in coming up with a plan until close to the end of the book when things were only getting worse, and they were completely out of time to escape. And that bothered me because it almost felt like she was going to rely on whatever plan their group came up with at the last minute as their overall plan instead of trying to come up with multiple plans beforehand just in case.\n\nI also wasn’t a fan of some of the points of views they decided to include in this book that weren’t in the other two books in this series. I don’t understand why Officer Hastings had to have a couple chapters devoted to his perspective. Yes, I like his character overall in the story, but I feel like he doesn’t play an important role in the story in any way. I see him as a minor character in this series more than anything else. I also didn’t really see the point of having a chapter told from Leon’s perspective either. Yes, I like his character and I know him, and Dante are involved in helping Rosalie and the others escape. But I felt like the chapter we had from him was something we could’ve had during one of Rosalie’s chapters in this book as it didn’t add anything to the story to me from what I could see.\n\nLastly, I also wasn’t a fan of how this book ended in comparison to the rest of the books in this series. I know I mentioned earlier about being intrigued about what was going on in the Psych unit and that I knew it would definitely play a role in this series. But the character who ends up getting hurt like those in the Psych unit had been makes me sad because I feel like he went through a lot in this book and that he didn’t deserve to go through this too. I also didn’t like the ending because I feel like I know what Rosalie is going to do since things didn’t go at all the way she had hoped. Yes, its interesting because it means there’s more going on in the prison that needs to be resolved. But I feel like the authors could handle it differently too by including more of that aspect of the story into this series instead of giving us little bits of it.\n\nBut overall, I did enjoy reading Feral Wolf, the third book in this series. Its not my favorite out of the books in this series, but it left enough for me to continue reading the series to see how things will play out for Rosalie and the guys once the next book is actually released."
