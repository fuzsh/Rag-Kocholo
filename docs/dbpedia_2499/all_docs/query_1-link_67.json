        "text": "While story might not be the first thing that people consider when thinking of video games, they can be a much more involving storytelling medium than film and even novels. Contrary to what some might think, video games don’t have many inherent limitations on storytelling. They’re commonly associated with mindless violence, but we have seen time and again that they can be much more than that.\n\nVideo games have the benefit of being interactive, a benefit not shared by books and movies. Some games use this to take storytelling to a different, higher level. These are the most amazing video games there are. In this article we will examine and discuss the ten best stories in video game history. We talk a lot about the storytelling potential in games, but very few live up to that potential. This list is dedicated to those few.\n\nBe forewarned that this article contains spoilers for every game listed. Do not read about any game you have not played.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nThese are games that were once on our list, but have since been replaced by another. Make no mistake, they are remarkable in their own right.\n\n“Man, I need a real case! I need a challenge, worthy of my deductive and pugilistic skills.” – Sly Boots\n\nGame Title: Anachronox\n\nDeveloper: Ion Storm\n\nPublisher: Eidos Interactive\n\nRelease Date: 2001\n\nPlatforms: PC\n\nGenre: Turn-Based Adventure\n\nApproximate Length: 50 hours\n\nPlot Involves Saving the World?: Yes\n\nWhat’s that, a comedy game? Forbidden! Especially from an article about writing. But we don’t discriminate, Anachronox has earned a place here. It is an epic, a large scale game that will take you across the stars. You will even fight bad guys wearing Lucha libre outfits and using wrestling moves on you.\n\nAnachronox is almost like an entire season of Futurama wrapped in one third person turn-based highly interactive nonlinear game borrowing a lot of RPG elements, although contrary to what some claim it is not a full fledged RPG as you play as a predefined character known as Sly Boots. You start off down on your luck, as the intro above shows. A private detective without a steady line of work, it is time to make a change, and that’s where the game begins.\n\nOf course, that case that Sly Boots has been waiting for eventually finds him. Throughout Anachronox, you will assemble a memorable cast of unlikely heroes and explore the mysteries of MysTech, ancient artifacts that grant special powers to those who can use them, after an experiment gone wrong causes all MysTech in the universe to activate.\n\nThe name “Anachronox” refers to the words “anachronism” and “noxious”, combining to mean “poison from the past.” This is the name of the first planet the game takes place on, which is unique for its constant shifting which nobody understands. It also alludes to the fact that you’ll be exploring the troubled past not only of the protagonist, but also of the universe itself. In Anachronox, a team of scientists learn that the universe is cyclic: a universe is created by a big bang, and it is ended by a big crunch. MysTech is being used by entities of pure Chaos to bring back a previous universe which would replace our current one, erasing it from existence, in their scheme to eradicate Order from existence.\n\nSo the plot of Anachronox ascends to cosmic existential proportions. Boots and his team must stop these events from happening. Along the way you meet comical superheroes and supervillains and their presentation never misses the comedic mark. Anachronox is certainly one of the very best comedies in gaming.\n\nAnachronox is also easily the best “cinematic” game to my estimation. As cinematic as anything today, but it doesn’t sacrifice being a game. It is a very interactive game and uses this to benefit the narrative unlike the cinematic games of today. People have even combined all of its cutscenes to make a movie.\n\nSilent Hill 2 is legendary for its storytelling. This is yet another game we’ve written about in considerable detail before, both in the aforementioned best antagonist article and our best horror game article. It took the psychological horror genre to a new level.\n\nYou play as James Sunderland, a recent widower. At the start of the game James receives a letter, apparently written by his deceased wife Mary, telling him to meet her in their “special place” in the mysterious, abandoned town of Silent Hill. Right at the start of the game, when he is reading the letter, it’s made obvious that he’s a tormented character and that the player is going to experience his hell, his misery. But you won’t be able to guess just how deep this journey goes.\n\nThe town of Silent Hill is cut off from the rest of the world. For most people, once you enter there is no escape. The roads leading out of the town are destroyed, leading down into an endless cliff. The town is overrun by monsters, which are each symbolic representations of an inner struggle of James. This includes the apparent antagonist Pyramid Head, which we wrote about here. The quote at the top of this page summarizes Pyramid Head; he is an invention of Sunderland’s mind, existing to punish James for his sins, to judge him, to encourage him to face the horror of what he had done. But what did James do? This leads to another twist.\n\nJames’ wife, Mary, did not die of sickness as he said throughout the game. She was in fact dying of sickness, but it was James who ended her life. He ended her life by suffocating her. Dying in her hospital bed, Mary only brought pain and suffering into James’ life. James had suffered enough, and chose to end his attachment to a dying woman. In her final days Mary often lashed out at James, inflicting her pain onto him. All of this pushed James over the edge, and his journey through Silent Hill is perhaps a way for him to face what he has done.\n\nThe story is a psychological study of guilt and self-deception, told in a powerful and poetic way.\n\nAs with other great stories, the plot which is what happens, might not seem very impressive on paper. But the story, which is why those things happen, is one of the most complex and well-written of any and all games. Silent Hill 2 doesn’t have the most amazing overall dialogue though; in this area it is bested by the others, with bits of dialogue being downright silly (the poor voice acting does not help). But its use of symbolism and metaphors is legendary, the best in the history of video games. They’re used in the game’s set pieces, on the enemy models, and in the writing itself. It does a much better job showing than telling, and relies primarily on the former, it’s strength, thankfully.\n\nSilent Hill 2 also takes heavy inspiration from Solaris, a 1961 novel by Polish author Stanislaw Lem and particularly Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1972 film adaptation. This video breaks it down wonderfully.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs was not developed by Frictional Games, the developer of Penumbra and Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and one of the best game development studios of all time. They merely published the game. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a PC exclusive psychological horror game developed by TheChineseRoom, who also created Dear Esther.\n\nThis game is not much of a survival horror game at all, as our review pointed out. It is pure psychological horror. From a story standpoint, it marks a significant step-up in complexity over all of our previous entries.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs is exceptionally well written and it’s properly disturbing. It is easy to predict the plot twist, but that’s nothing. The plot is simply what happens, the story is why those things happened, and the why is huge in this game. It also benefits from good voice acting and an appropriate soundtrack.\n\nBecause it’s only a 6-7 hour game, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs does not have a particularly grand plot. You play as an amnesiac Oswald Mandus, a genius entrepreneur and inventor. The game is set at the turn of the 19th century. Oswald awakens in his mansion with months, perhaps years of his life erased from his memories. His children are missing and he hears their cries throughout his mansion. The initial, basic goal of the game is to simply explore the mansion and find Oswald’s children.\n\nBut obviously, that objective is just a front for what would turn into a thickly layered story. Throughout the mansion you can interact with phonographs and find journal entries which detail important, forgotten events from Oswald’s life. One very important one was the loss of his wife, Lily, who died while giving birth to their twins, Edwin and Enoch.\n\nOswald is a complex character. He was born into a rich family; his parents owned a massive meat processing company. Despite this, and despite being a rich man himself, he pitied the poor and showed generosity toward them. He was also a caring father, one who would do anything for his children. He seemed to be an equally caring and devoted husband.\n\nWhile exploring the mansion you’ll find hidden passageways, some of which revealing disturbing truths about Oswald. For example, he had passageways built into the walls behind several bathrooms, where he had front row seats to a view of the bathtub through a window disguised as a painting. Things only got worse for Oswald when he invested too much into the machinery of his factory, making it more efficient and more safe. He faced bankruptcy and had to take drastic action. Through this we are shown how cruel the industrial world was in 19th century England. Oswald tried to make things better for his workers and faced financial ruin because of it. The only way to survive during these times was to be as cruel as the rest of the world, according to this story.\n\nBut that is just one theme in this story. It goes much further, much deeper, into much darker territory. Through his uncle’s notes, Mandus learned about mythical sources of power referred to as Orbs. Perhaps those could be the miracle needed to dig his business out of the mess it was in? Perhaps that could power his cutting edge, massive factory and make it the most efficient production facility ever? This is what Oswald saw—opportunity. And this leads to another question; how far would a businessman go for such an opportunity? As you may have guessed, the answer is shown to be ‘too far.’\n\nMandus learned of the location of one such Orb—it was in an Aztec temple. So he traveled to America and Mexico with his children in search of this orb, encountering Native Americans on the way who were baffled by his knowledge. Ironically his children seem to have come across the Orb before him, calling it a “stone egg.” The origin of these Orbs is not terribly important to the story, but it’s explored in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, this game’s predecessor. But to summarize, these Orbs are otherworldly artifacts of power and we can’t even gauge the potential fully. They can be used to travel to different worlds, which is seen in The Dark Descent.\n\nUpon making contact with the Orb, the future is revealed to Mandus. He is shown visions of what seems to be both World War I and World War II, and he is shown the fate of both of his children; killed during World War I. He saw the world tearing itself apart and he couldn’t bear to see it, he could not let his children meet those horrible ends. So what did Mandus do? He sacrificed both of his children, in his mind saving them from an even worse fate, but also to reawaken the power of the Orb. This does bring up a moral debate about whether or not it was the right thing to do to “save” his children from a terrible fate, although this theme has been handled much better elsewhere, such as in the second season of Game of Thrones. However, this is not a major theme in the story of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.\n\nThe Orb also seemed to cure Mandus of a fever he had contracted, but in the process splitting his mind (or soul?) into two. These two personalities come into conflict with each other later in the story.\n\nThrough these events we also saw that Oswald Mandus was willing to go to any end to reawaken the power of the Orb, not just to save his business however. The vision changed his view on the world and all of its people. His goal shifted from saving his business to saving the world, and he was willing to sacrifice his children for the latter.\n\nBecause of his vision of death and destruction, he began to hate the world and all people, viewing them as nothing more than pigs. Flawed, disgusting, imperfect. The “disgusting” aspect is tied in with the horrible pollution of that time period (which is shown in the level design of the game), and his view on creating perfected beings is like that of the Nazis, which is ironic since it was his visions of the World Wars that changed his view in the first place. He set out to build a massive machine, a machine for pigs, fit only for the slaughtering of pigs as the quote says. He wanted to remake the world through machinery, to avert the coming wars. Human sacrifice was needed, which he held no objection too since humans were nothing more than pigs in his eyes.\n\nIt is also implied that the loss of his wife partially fueled his madness, to show how powerful grief can be and how horribly wrong one can go when unable to deal with grief properly.\n\nThe game’s concept of remaking the world is also a reflection of industrialism and technological revolution itself. He imagined a mechanized world, and the implications of this are relevant to today’s world in which technology is taking over. So this asks the question of whether or not we are taking technology too far, whether or not we are too reliant on it.\n\nOswald’s split personalities came into conflict during his construction and use of his machine. He did horrible things, such as using orphans in slave labor and sacrificing people to create his servants—’Manpigs’ which, as the name implies, are man-pig hybrids which also serve as basic enemies throughout the game. They are of course symbolic of Oswald’s negative views on mankind, showing that people are still beasts at their very core. At some point, Oswald realized the horror of what he was doing, and tried to stop it. But again, the Orb seemed to have split Oswald into two back in the temple, and his fever returned. One part of him sabotaged the machine while the other went into the machine itself.\n\nAfter he sabotaged the machine, he succumbed to his fever, falling unconscious in his bed. Eventually he awoke to the sound of his children calling him, and this is where the game begins. Oswald was without recent memory, without the memory of the machine, the wars, his sacrifice of his children. With that, we are back at square one!\n\nOswald’s amnesia isn’t entirely explained, but it’s obviously related to his fever. It’s also very similar to what happened to the protagonist of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, in which Daniel drank an amnesia potion to wipe his mind clean of all the horrible things he did, so that he can put things right. At the end of the day, this is what happened in Machine for Pigs too, except that the amnesia of Oswald Mandus is perhaps not quite as intentional as drinking an amnesia potion.\n\nWhile venturing through the mansion and recovering his memories, Oswald makes contact with a man who does not identify himself, although his voice sounds much like that of Oswald himself. He tells Oswald that in order to find and save his children, he has to repair the machine, undoing the work of the sabateur, which we just said was Oswald himself after realizing the horror of what he had done. So who was manipulating an amnesiac Oswald into repairing the machine? Why, it was his other half of course. The evil part of him that now resides within the machine itself.\n\nThroughout the game you venture deeper and deeper into the factory, into the horror. The climax is the encounter with the machine itself, along with Oswald’s other half. All is revealed to you then as you discover that Oswald sacrificed his children and that it is him who built the machine and resides within it. Here, Oswald makes another sacrifice—his own life, to stop the machine once and for all. He couldn’t have done this without the fresh start which was the result of his memory loss.\n\nLike every other story here, a summary and brief analysis don’t do it justice. It needs to be played more than once to comprehend it all. It is a content rich story full of hidden themes which are all tied together wonderfully. This story explores how grief can overwhelm you, the cruelty of industrialism and the late 19th century industrial world, obsession with technology gone too far, the beastial nature of humans, the concept of reshaping the world to better it (with religious implications). It contains some very good use of irony. These themes are explored less directly than simpler games, relying heavily on metaphors and symbolism. The dialogue and monologues are all of exceptional quality, especially for a video game.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs is truly an interactive short story, although it doesn’t focus as much on the immediate, obvious details of the plot, such as the actual threat of these pigs and the lack of an obvious armed response. It aims to be poetic above all.\n\nCryostasis: Sleep of Reason is an underrated, forgotten gem that has a way of creeping up on us it seems. I personally like its story more than some of the entries occupying better positions on this list.\n\nCryostasis is a first person Ukrainian horror game. They’re really onto something over in the East when it comes to writing in general and writing for movies and games. Cryostasis deliberately parallels Maxim Gorky’s fairy tale The Flaming Heart of Danko, a tale that studies the relationship between a leader and his followers. This story is actually found in pieces throughout the game, really emphasizing the parallelism.\n\nThe game is set in the arctic as the name implies. You play as Alexander Nesterov, a researcher sent to locate a stranded nuclear ice breaker called the North Wind. It crashed into a glacier near the North Pole, and what became of the crew was unknown. While exploring the ship it is discovered that tragedy struck; many crew members were murdered and the player must find out why, and must discover the fate of the ship’s Captain. In addition, some sort of change has befallen the surviving crew members, turning them insane and violent, and making them fear heat and live off of the cold.\n\nWhat is discovered is that the Captain followed in the footsteps of Danko, since like we said the stories are parallel. They explore very similar themes too, about leadership and how followers blame their leader during desperate times. Both are very humanistic stories. Cryostasis shows fundamental flaws in human nature and does so in a very powerful way. All of the horror you encounter is the result of nothing really extraordinary, just totally believable selfish acts done during a very trying time. It also shows us the difference that common decency and working together can make. It does such a good job at creating characters and portraying them as flawed but human; many commit terrible acts but it is very understandable why they do so, due to the desperate situations presented in the game. This is such a relief compared to one dimensional villains typically found in games, who commit evil just for the sake of evil.\n\nThe start of the game quotes Hermann Hesse. They could not have picked a better quote here.\n\nMy story is comfortless. It isn’t sweet or happy as fictional stories are. It has shades of senselessness and confusion, of madness and dreams, like the lives of people who no longer delude themselves.\n\nOther quotes appear throughout the game which give insight into what Cryostasis is about, but this one stands out the most. It so perfectly applies to the story that Cryostasis tells. It is indeed a comfortless tale, really exposing serious flaws about humanity in a brutally honest manner. Despite the added happy ending, it’s not a sweet or happy tale and this ending can easily be seen as a hoax. Confusion and madness are prevalent throughout, and Cryostasis is all about breaking illusions and introducing a hard dose of reality to the player.\n\nThe story is integrated into the gameplay surprisingly well, primarily through the game’s “Mental Echo” ability, in which the player comes across dead bodies in specific areas of the ship, set up in such a way that you can determine how they died based on the scene. By interacting with the bodies, the protagonist goes back in time to when that person died, and the player must correct their fatal flaw. This is primarily how you advance through the game. The fatal flaw is always an act of selfishness, cowardice, or treachery. Through this we are shown that common decency and working together are the only way to survive such a catastrophe (or even avert it altogether).\n\nLike the Silent Hill games, the design of the game’s enemies are symbolic. Of course all of them physically show the “cryostasis” which they have undergone (the name Cryostasis may very well reflect the fact that humans in the game acted in a very cold manner), but many reflect on the theme of imprisonment. One enemy for example has a cage and prison cell integrated into his face, while another is seemingly crudely bolted together, and another has his hands bolted to his head and wears a metal mask with a keyhole on the front. Imprisonment… for their actions that damned them.\n\nPowerful and touching, Cryostasis is a humanistic story but for the vast majority of its duration a rather negative (but truthful) one. We may not even fully understand the final boss, Chronos, we wonder if he was just added in to make for a happy ending so that players don’t kill themselves once they see the full picture of what transpired on the North Wind, and once they realize how terrible humanity is. Yeah… that’s very likely. Since it’s through him and through Nesterov that the chaos is undone. Chronos gave the North Wind’s crew members a second chance. This “boss battle” involves “playing a game” with Chronos, the God of time. Small waves of enemies are spawned, who attack Chronos by default. Chronos tries to Hulk smash them and gets a “point” for each one he does. You get a point for shooting some strange projectile at the enemies, and whoever has the most points by the end of it wins (if you lose, you fail and have to start over). The projectile resembles Earth revolving in its orbit, the “game” is basically a dialogue between Nesterov who tries to save the fallen crew members, versus Chronos who thinks humanity isn’t worth saying and is smashing them with a club. Also a reflection of the entire game in which Nesterov thinks it is worthwhile to go back in time and save the fallen crew members.\n\nOne thing we have to point out is that Cryostasis has three endings, but we feel the story would have been more effective if all three were combined into one ending. In each ending the player corrects a critical, selfish flaw committed by another character, the available characters being the executive officer of the ship, the officer in charge of the prisoners (which were the cargo of the ship), and the officer of engineering. Each aforementioned mistake is powerful and highlights those three characters. We don’t see any good reason to split up the ending into three, the player should have to correct all three of their mistakes, especially since most people wouldn’t replay the game.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is a remarkable RPG, perhaps the last truly excellent one. It was crafted by Obsidian, one of the most talented studios of all time. Like many other elite RPGs, had it not been rushed by the publishers (Bethesda in this case), it would be far better, and most likely on our main list. It was not even given two years to be developed, despite being a massive open world RPG with heavy story focus unlike every other truly open world game in existence.\n\nAs we mentioned previously, Fallout is a post-apocalyptic American satire. What are some obvious settings for such a story? Las Vegas instantly jumps out at you, which brings us to Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nYou play as the Courier, and the game begins with your botched execution after delivering yet another deadly package, a platinum chip. The man who pulled the trigger is Benny, who represents your stereotypical high roller Las Vegas gambler who thinks he has everything planned out. A revenge plot sprouts from this, but it is New Vegas itself that tells most of this game’s story. Post-apocalyptic Las Vegas, surprisingly accurately depicted I might add from a geological point of view. The Vegas Strip lives on, practically separate from the war and devastation that surrounded it.\n\nUnlike Bethesda’s own Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, Fallout: New Vegas is professionally written. The world is believable on both a macro and micro scale, while Bethesda fails at both. An example of the former would be how there is still some form of civilization and hierarchy in New Vegas (more than one in fact), something inevitable considering that these three games take place approximately two hundred years after the nuclear war. As for the latter, that would refer to more subtle details such as settlements actually being located in believable places; near fertile land or bodies of water for example. And in New Vegas, every location is rooted in satire.\n\nEvery faction has their own story and is likewise rooted in satire. Its story of the NCR (New California Republic) is a continuation of that from the first two Fallout games, a representation of post-apocalyptic law and order with questionable history leading into a good political story involving the Great Khans (also a continuation of the first Fallout). The NCR deliberately resembles the US government and the way they force their ways upon others, guaranteeing that their ways are superior and will only prove beneficial, but at the same time if you get on their bad side they can ruthlessly wipe you out or close to it, as the Great Khans found out the hard way.\n\nA new chapter for the Brotherhood of Steel was written for this game, and New Vegas introduces a new faction, massive in size, that is able to compete for power with the NCR, and that faction is Caesar’s Legion, representing a new tribal philosophy rooted in human history. Many smaller ones, such as primitive tribes, exist as well. Unlike Bethesda’s Fallout game and like any respectable story, these factions have enough exposition for them to be worth discussing long after completing the game. They are not just plot devices, they all contribute to the game’s world and story.\n\nThe same goes for the characters of Fallout: New Vegas. It has some of the most complex and well written characters in video game history, bringing with them some of the finest dialogue this industry has ever seen. The dialogue of New Vegas is stylized, truly distinct, like a well written fantasy world is supposed to be.\n\nThe story of Fallout: New Vegas revolves around, you guessed it, New Vegas. The satire throughout the game is found everywhere, and it all combines to ridicule the Las Vegas lifestyle and the people behind it. Right outside of The Strip is Freeside, a populated ruin filled with drug addicts and run by a gang who thinks they’re an early 20th century American gang. The Strip is ruled by Mr. House with an iron fist. They say the house always wins, but that doesn’t have to be the case in New Vegas. Mr. House is centuries old, being the same powerful Las Vegas entrepreneur who was prominent in the present day. He is scheming and controlling, representing what you’d expect from a powerful casino owner with ties to organized crime.\n\nOther casinos on The Strip are run by different families: the White Gloves, Omertas, and the Chairmen. Each is their own satire: the Chairmen, for which Benny was the head of, are like Benny; the cool, smooth sailing, fancy suit wearing gamblers of New Vegas. The Omertas control prostitution and are a more thuggish, quick to show their firepower and muscle. The White Gloves appear to be the most refined and luxurious. But the Three Families combine to make a greater satire; all three were primitive tribal gangs until Mr. House raised them up, and the White Gloves are cannibals, the most disgusting ones despite their refined outward appearance. So here we have New Vegas, or Las Vegas in the future, run by a power hungry entrepreneur straight out of the modern era, with casinos being owned by not just gangsters, but tribals, one of which being a family of cannibals. The place is policed by Mr. House’s robots which display a cute little image on them, and New Vegas builds up to a conflict between Mr. House, the NCR (accept my freedom or else), and Caesar’s Legion. This fits right into the Fallout universe.\n\nTime constraints caused various aspects of the NCR, Caesar’s Legion, and their conflicts to be rushed. Events that should be seen and shown do not occur, because they did not have time to include them. The scale and threat of Caesar’s Legion is not properly conveyed, the controversy of the NCR should be experienced first hand far more than the game currently shows. But publishers will be publishers, greedy and impatient as always, and games will always suffer from it. Still, New Vegas is a masterpiece.\n\nIts four story DLCs combine to make their own story that ties into the base game wonderfully. The strongest literary highlight of Fallout: New Vegas is showcased by two of its DLCs: Dead Money and Lonesome Road. Old World Blues is good in its own right, serving as a comedy but with very good tie-ins to Dead Money and Lonesome Road.\n\nDead Money and Lonesome Road serve as some of the best character studies in gaming and just ooze atmosphere. The former is a very dark satire about the greed and vices of celebrities, and how these can not only bring them down but destroy everything they love. It tells this story through its location, the Sierra Madre Casino as well as its history, and also through its cast: Dean Domino, a famous actor turned Ghoul, whose personality hasn’t changed one bit. He manages to be both the coolest character in the story, and the most despicable. Words can’t convey how well written this character is. As a performer, he found himself in the shadow of the great Frederick Sinclair, someone even richer and better connected than he. Dean became even more triggered when Sinclair retained his optimistic attitude after severe financial setbacks. Dean became obsessed with putting Sinclair in his place, and hatched a plan to take everything he holds dear, and the lengths Dean would go to achieve this are both fascinating and disturbing.\n\nThe Sierra Madre casino was Sinclair’s flagship. While working there and working close to Sinclair, Dean learned of a big vault underneath the casino. Robbing this vault became Dean’s #1 motive in life. He was friends with singer and starlet Vera Keyes, who he used as a pawn to get into the vault by introducing her and Sinclair with the hopes that Sinclair would fall for her and then Vera can tell Dean how to access the vault.\n\nThe plan set off to a good start, but Vera soon decided to abandon it out of guilt. With Vera no longer following Dean’s plan, Dean began to blackmail her as he knew of her drug addictions, though what he didn’t know is those addictions stemmed from Vera having a terminal illness she told nobody about. Sinclair would learn of this plot by accidentally coming across evidence of it. This broke his heart, and so he prepared an incredibly well engineered trap in his vault, which would lock anyone in forever. But when Vera admitted the plot to him out of guilt, Sinclair realized he isn’t vengeful enough to harm her.\n\nThen came the nuclear missiles. The Sierra Madre’s doors would lock, the security systems would engage, and the place would be walled off from the rest of the world, trapping Vera Keyes inside and killing her. The place would remain sealed until you break in during Dead Money to unravel its dark satirical story of celebrity greed and deception.\n\nIt becomes the target for the most daring treasure hunters, most of all Father Elijah, former Brotherhood of Steel member who was dissatisfied with their cautious approach to things. He would leave a trail of crimes in his wake, such that the Brotherhood would dispatch Christine Royce to eliminate him, but like Dean and like yourself, she would fall into one of his traps.\n\nWhile Dead Money is a satire of the deceitful and greedy nature of celebrity life, the theme of greed and how hard it is to let go of it is all over. The Sierra Madre is a place for you to let go of your worldly troubles, according to its official marketing. Dean’s greed for the Sierra Madre treasure led to him plotting is heist for 200 years, Sinclair letting go of his hate for Dean doomed him and Vera and the Sierra Madre, Father Elijah’s greed for the Sierra Madre treasure and technology would be the end of him, then there’s the “Dog and God” split personality character whose Dog personality is physical greed (hunger) personified. Dead Money is a brilliant story; a dark satire of celebrity greed and self-destruction, and a twisted love story.\n\nLonesome Road is a showdown between the protagonist and Ulysses, who is probably the world’s most undecided person when it comes to the philosophies behind civilization. It is a strong philosophical allegory about the impact one person’s careless actions can have. Ulysses wears dreadlocks, as did everyone in his original tribe which was aptly called the Twisted Hairs. They had previously allied with Caesar’s Legion. Ulysses was a scout, traveling far and long, absorbing everything he came across. After they helped Caesar’s Legion conquer Arizona, Caesar rewarded them by betraying their alliance, slaughtering them and enslaving the survivors and erasing the tribe from history, like he does with every other tribe.\n\nUlysses took his own namesake from Ulysses S. Grant, as he was an avid student of history. He admired how Grant was a key general in the revolutionary war and uniting of two flags. Due to his resourcefulness and willing to bend the knee to Caesar, Ulysses was put to work as a courier/spy for the legion, like many other couriers in the New Vegas region. It was Ulysses who saw the NCR at Hoover Dam, told Caesar about it, thus focusing all of Caesar’s attention on conquering the NCR.\n\nDuring his travels, Ulysses encountered a prospering community called The Divide. He saw in The Divide “a nation taking its first breath” and appreciated how they proudly displayed the American flag as their symbol. He fell in love with the place, and was trying to figure out how to perhaps make it his home. Then the NCR discovered it and annexed it in traditional NCR fashion, driving the point home about the NCR, while being less cruel than the Legion, is far from benevolent. This made Ulysses despise the NCR even more, but then to make matters more complicated, the Legion learned of The Divide and sent a small army to conquer it from the NCR.\n\nUlysses tried to hatch a plan to betray the Legion and save The Divide, but then the protagonist (a courier, if you recall) was unknowingly hired by the NCR and sent to deliver a package from Navarro to The Divide. The package had the US flag on it as well as the Enclave flag, which fascinated Ulysses, but what nobody knew is what the package contained – ICBM launch codes. The package was then activated, detonating several nuclear warheads underneath The Divide, which is why the place is so dramatically caved in like no environment you’ve ever seen before in a game.\n\nUlysses barely survived, and this event changed everything for him. Ironically he was saved by medical eyebots because he wore a US flag on his clothing, so they probably identified him as a US soldier, with flags being a motif throughout Lonesome Road. This event taught Ulysses of the potential impact one man can (accidentally) have on the world. He would become obsessed with tracking the protagonist down, and failing at this, he decided to let the protagonist come to him, which is where Lonesome Road begins.\n\nUlysses wants revenge on a greater scale, not just to kill the protagonist as retribution for The Divide, but because the protagonist accidentally destroyed the one civilization he loved in The Divide, and because there are still undetonated nuclear missiles in The Divide, Ulysses invited the protagonist here so that he/she can watch as Ulysses launches nukes at whoever he sided with in the main New Vegas campaign, making Lonesome Road an epilogue. It must be played after the main game and all DLC.\n\nSo Fallout: New Vegas has several excellent stories within them. It is a strong satire, although not as clever as Fallout 2 in this regard, it is strong in dialogue and very strong in character development. It accomplishes a hell of a lot.\n\nArcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura is one of the best RPGs and best games ever made. It has a unique steampunk fantasy setting, resembling 1800s United Kingdom, but with more advanced technology in some areas along with the presence of traditional fantasy races and tropes such as elves, dwarves, orcs, ogres, and magic.\n\nAs expected, its story is one about industrial revolution and it explores the benefits and consequences of it from various perspectives, like the nature loving elves, the stout dwarves, and the short lived humans. Industrial and technological revolution is pushing magick away in the world of Arcanum, creating obvious conflict. This much it does as well as anyone could hope from a video game. The same goes for its world building; it is a massive open world game, and every civilized location is uniquely written with its own lore and stories, a world where religion actually has a presence along with its controversies. Multiple religions of course, all explored either through optional character interaction, optional exploration, optional reading of religious texts, and quests.\n\nNPCs are also written with greater attention to detail than most other games, and combined with its amount of role-playing (which is only surpassed by Fallout 2), and dialogue quality and authenticity, it makes for a plausible, believable, living world. It becomes so much more immersive than hollow RPGs from today for example.\n\nArcanum has more thematic depth and originality just in its books that populate its world, almost all of which are optional reads, than the entirety of most games. I spend quite a while soaking in the Tarant library every time, reading memorable autobiographies, short stories, essays and more. There is the beginning of an autobiography which told the story about the writer’s experience as a child being effectively sold into slavery at a factory (obviously an allegory about real 1800s factories) and how his unknown affinity for magick disrupted the factory leading to a memorable encounter with the supervisor and his gun. There’s also that short adventure story written in the first person that serves as some cultural exposition as well as an account about what to expect when exploring a certain mountain region in the game. I recall an autobiography of sorts about a man who was driven to study therapeutics and healing due to being unsatisfied with magical healing, only to find it to be an underfunded area of science as he worked with the inventor of the microscope in this universe to study Consumption (tuberculosis).\n\nYou will find books that serve as historical texts for the game’s many locations, a writer’s propaganda or beliefs about technology or magick (whether essays or poems), and how can we forget “The Orcish Question”? This two volume collection of essays and speeches is from a human who seeks a final solution to the Orcish question, a daring reference in two spectacularly written books. The “Orcish Question” revolves around humanity advancing and becoming more “civilized” due to the industrial revolution that is happening, and the brutish ways of the Orcs has no place in new human society, so the question is what must be done about this?\n\nThe author proposes that there may be medicinal ways to pacify them, a second self-proclaimed very progressive researcher agrees and that experiments should begin on volunteers and corpses (perhaps foreshadowing the Half-Ogre island quest). Another individual defines natural selection (the same definition we use) and states that it will take care of the orcs, but the author considers this irresponsible.\n\nVolume two addresses a rumor (or propaganda) stating that Orcs are humans that have been transformed by cruel magic, bolstering the author’s anti-magick and pro-technology arguments while he addresses many strong arguments against his proposed final solution to the Orcish question.\n\nThere is obvious social commentary in many of these books scattered throughout the world of Arcanum, allegories and foreshadowing, loads of exposition. And so many of them have proper introductions. No other game I’ve played with books scattered around the world are quite this well written; they are truly expert in Arcanum. All the different books have unique style too, which makes me wonder how many people actually wrote them? Arx Fatalis and especially The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind are fairly strong in writing quality when it comes to lore books placed throughout the world, while modern AAA games such as Skyrim are really weak and lacking in soul and distinct writing style here. But Arcanum outshines even Morrowind in this writing.\n\nThe majority of Arcanum wonderfully discusses the industrial revolution themes, and how it’s short sighted and ruining the planet. Plenty of great arguments are presented from both sides in the form of NPC dialogue, books found in the world, and the quest design itself. These themes are backed into the main story, which revolves around an ancient conflict about magick vs technology; the governing body of Arcanum, the Elven council, had their power due to their unprecedented mastery over magick. Conflict arose when the most technologically advanced civilization in an underground city called Vendigroth aggressively pushed for technological advancement, going as far as creating a weapon specifically designed against mages. As a result, one of the Elven council members, Arronax, eradicated all life from that entire region. This spawned the Dark Elves, who believe in Arronax’s decision and that Elves should rule Arcanum once again.\n\nThen you also have the Dwarves’ perspective; they are the most technologically advanced people, but they are not so careless with their use of technology since they are a long lived species so they actually live to see the consequences of their actions unlike humans. There is an obvious allegory here about humanity’s industrial revolution and how we’re speeding up the demise of our species with our carelessness. But are the Dark Elves going to far? Was Arronax right or wrong? It’s up to you to decide.\n\nThroughout Arcanum you’ll also learn about Tarant, its equivalent of London, and its aggressive human and now technological expansion and how it obliterated the Kingdom of Cumbria for not accepting their industrial revolution. In-game, the capital of Cumbria, Dernholm, is a ruin. The history of Tarant is written in blood, so typical for human history, and it is not unlike the nation it resembles in Great Britain which is no coincidence.\n\nSo many of its quests (including optional side quests) serve to further expand upon the world as well as thematic elements of the story, delivering additional perspective and interesting characters to think about. The quests are also written far better than most other RPGs, especially modern ones which are ripe with fetch quests or “goose chase” type quests (e.g. find this person, then find that person, and each time said person is marked on your map, like in the disappointing Torment: Tides of Numenera).\n\nFor example, Arcanum literally incorporates an authentic Lovecraftian short story as a quest. This quest involves carrying out a detailed investigation into paranormal, creepy events. The investigation is an authentic one; it starts off by reading a nonfiction book written by someone who was investigating the matter at hand. Then it involves following up on leads mentioned in the book, which entails visiting a city’s public archives and inquiring about persons mentioned in said book, and more detective work along those lines. It is logical, diverse, and suspense continually elevates as you progress through the quest.\n\nThis is typical Troika Games greatness, evident in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines as well. Quests are unique stories in their own right, still connected to the main story of course, but they include their own unique themes, styles, tropes, cultural references, social commentary, and more. Dozens of quests like this appear in both games, it is a level of writing depth that you will not find outside of late 1990s and early 2000s RPGs (not at this scale that is).\n\nAnother noteworthy quest is the Half-Ogre Island side quest. Here, you can involve yourself in a conspiracy that starts off very secretive – a man asks you to deliver a message to another man, who then captures and threatens you because he’s well aware that the person who hired you was an assassin and you have no idea of this. This man, Sir Matt de Cesare, will then give you a quest to find the unique skulls of the Ren’ar siamese twins, without telling you what for. If you retrieve them, he’ll tell you to bring them to Arthur Tyron in Caladon. That person, whose sanity is questionable, will fill you in on a conspiracy, claiming that Gnomes have been kidnapping human females and using them to breed Half-Ogres to use as bodyguards. Tyron cites the fact that every wealthy Gnome has Half-Ogre bodyguards, coupled with the fact that Half-Ogres used to be far more rare in the world and now they’re not, also coinciding with the fact that a Gnomish merchants guild is now the ruling power in Arcanum.\n\nTyron and de Cesare have a number of operatives in their employ, you’re just one of them. A possible breeding ground on an island was singled out, and you get tasked with investigating it, where you’ll find nothing but empty cages and a journal detailing experiments – just the evidence you need, but how convincing. When bringing this back to Tyron, he’ll be gone, replaced with a Gnome who manipulates you. First he swears to be working for Tyron, and then he explains exactly how the conspiracy works – the Gnomes needed these bodyguards for self-preservation, raising more racial story themes again. The Gnomish merchants guild was responsible for killing the last King of Tarant and kidnapped his wife (who was found guilty of the murder) and used her in the first successful Half-Ogre C-Section operation. And then this Gnome states that this information may or may not be true, and that you have no hard evidence, thus revealing his part in this conspiracy.\n\nIt is a good, classic way to handle a conspiracy with good twists and turns, toying with your expectations. You expect to find ongoing experiments on Half-Ogre Island, but you find nothing and you only spend a moment there since it’s completely desolate. You expect to bring the lab notes back to Tyron and then expose this conspiracy, but instead he’s gone and one of the apparent conspirators is in his home, with Tyron missing. This Gnome mentions that perhaps the local newspaper will believe your story, which is a suggestion to the player to go take your “evidence” to the local news. The journalist says he’ll write the story based on the evidence you provide, and will pay up to 100 gold for it. If you give him the book, you will return later to find no sign of him; he wasn’t an actual journalist, but another conspirator.\n\nIt is unique that you can’t “win” this quest, it serves as a reminder that the protagonist is not capable of solving everything, something Troika also masters in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines.\n\nAnother example of the attention to detail in Arcanum questing comes in the form of really using the world intelligently. For example, there will be times where you need to contact someone in another city, and in some quests you’ll be permitted to reach out to them via telegraph instead of going there yourself.\n\nArcanum also suffers the same primary flaw of Bloodlines, and that is a rushed, unsatisfactory ending. It is a twist in Arcanum, no doubt about it. I found no foreshadowing for it. But it does not do the game justice and even worse, it completely abandons the industrial revolution themes. It seems unrelated and perhaps rushed, a worse conclusion than Bloodlines no doubt.\n\nAnd what is this weak, surprise ending, you might ask? Skip this section if you’ve never beaten Arcanum. The game wonderfully builds up the conflict of magick vs technological revolution by showing you it and getting you involved in ways that make sense. As it builds this up, it turns out the antagonist is an ancient elf named Arronax, who was vehemently against technology. The ancient city of Vendigroth, the most technologically advanced location in the game (because of course you actually get to visit it), supposedly built some sort of device that had the potential to kill even the most powerful mages. Kind of like a country building nuclear weapons.\n\nBut when a country builds nuclear weapons, we all take a cautious approach with them. Not Arronax, who was an immensely powerful mage (both politically and with his magical prowess). He not only attacked Vendigroth, he eradicated all life from that part of the world (which is the geographical equivalent to Ireland and not by accident, another jab thrown at Great Britain). You see it on Arcanum’s map called the Vendigroth Wastes; it’s a wasteland because of Arronax’s drastic actions.\n\nExpecting to be congratulated, Nasrudin, another elf on the great council who served as Arronax’s mentor at one point and brought him into the council (which was a controversial move since Arronax was young at that time), instead banished Arronax to the Void. This is about as bad as killing someone as you permanently send them to some dark void for the rest of their life.\n\nThe game builds up Arronax as the antagonist, who is looking to return, perhaps to finish what he started. And that’s what should have happened. You end up going to the Void as the game’s final location, similar to Planescape: Torment’s final mission in the Negative Energy Plane. And when you go there, you find Arronax, but he has no idea about any of the game’s plot events. He’s oblivious. Here, near the very end of the game, it is revealed that the antagonist is someone else who was hiding behind Arronax. The antagonist is revealed to be Kerghan, the very first necromancer in Arcanum. Kerghan was banished to the Void for his practices by Arronax himself.\n\nYou meet Kerghan and he tells you that he really loves being dead, it’s more peaceful than life so everyone else should be dead because it’s cool. Um… what? What happened to the awesome story about magick vs technological revolution and its commentary about the industrial revolution and humanity’s carelessness? You threw all of that out the window at the last second just for “I will save you all by making you embrace sweet death”? Really?\n\nIt is absolutely disconnected and thematically weak. What should have happened is, Arronax should have indeed been the antagonist, and he should try to convince you to join his side. After all, he wasn’t evil, just proactive and… maybe too trigger happy. Or maybe not, it should be up to the player to decide, perfectly fitting within the game’s immense role-playing and themes.\n\nJoin Arronax, who should have been revealed to have ordered the banishment of the Black Mountain Clan due to them letting steam technology fall into the hands of the humans who now want to take over everything with it. Or side with the industrial, technological revolution led by the Gnomish merchant guild that runs Tarant, with Gilbert Bates being the man to introduce you to them. So this would all have to be written in, the Gnomish merchants would have had to have been developed into characters and a faction of their own, and I guess Troika didn’t have time for it so worst case scenario is, use Gilbert Bates as their figurehead, basically informing the player that they’re not important enough to meet with the real ruling power of Tarant.\n\nOr join Nasrudin and try to achieve a fragile balance (which should imply that it will never hold or be permanent). And who you side with should change the entire ending; siding with Arronax should literally result in war occupying Arcanum, and conquering Tarant being the ending. Siding with Nasrudin or Tarant should just involve assassinating Arronax while in the Void, and the game would end there as it does now.\n\nFurthermore, unlike Bloodlines, not every quest in Arcanum (save for the last 1-2 hours given what we just stated) is brilliant; several side quests include excessively stupid, helpless NPCs, like a typical TV show or movie. Luckily these are few and far between, and at least the game makes them blatantly funny so it’s not as bad as having similarly crappy quests in a game that’s dead serious and relies on such weak design for more important quests (once again, I’m looking at modern day BioWare).\n\nPathologic 2 is the most recent game featured in this article. It tells one of the most dynamic, responsive stories in gaming; few games are more responsive to the player’s successes and failures, most RPGs aren’t even despite this not being an RPG. Pathologic 2 is a re-imagining of Pathologic, a game initially released in 2004. So really you can count both games for this spot. Read our full review of Pathologic 2 here.\n\nFrom a writing perspective, Pathologic 2 succeeds first and foremost at world building. It only takes place in a town that resembles an earlier 20th century Eastern European town with an industrial center, and also with dark fantasy elements to help distinguish itself further. Within this town you meet all sorts of people; actual characters unlike most games, whose motives you won’t be sure of. And there are just so many of them. The game buries its roots deep in Steppe culture and mythology. This town also has several prominent factions and leaders, and you will spend the game interacting with all of them. Often times their ideals will clash, and you will be in the middle and have to make a subtle choice. Not your typical point-and-click adventure game “A or B” type decisions either, as Pathologic 2 is one of the most dynamic and procedural stories of all time. It is so spontaneous.\n\nBut of course, the story of Pathologic 2 goes further than that in order to make this list. Not only does it create a unique yet believable dystopian world, the story packs the power of a 12 gauge slug. As the name implies, the plot revolves around a deadly plague that breaks loose, one that resembles the Black Death but is even more potent and lethal. Infected patients will be lucky to survive a day even with treatment, and they have almost no chance of surviving more than 2 days (it’s technically possible, just highly unlikely). But to raise the stakes, just about every character in the game can be infected at any time if they reside within an infected district, and which district will become infected is unpredictable aside from one time. All those characters you’ve gotten to know, love or hate? They can and will die at any moment. As the slogan says, you can’t save everyone.\n\nBut this is no normal plague, evident if you catch it and hear voices in your head. This plague has a purpose, perhaps even a mind of its own. It only affects humans, not animals nor the Odongh (“Worm” people). Throughout the game you will communicate with an entity that seems to actually be or represent the plague, and another character seems to communicate with it as well. Then there are the mysteries you can, but don’t have to solve, such as who killed the protagonist’s father and why, who is “The Eighth”, and more. Dreams and eerie late night plays in the theater bring obscure foreshadowing, there are so many elements at work in Pathologic 2’s story.\n\nWe mentioned fantasy elements in Pathologic 2’s story and world earlier; one of them is a spiraling tower that defies physics. There’s also a mysterious, unique looking cathedral whose purpose is unknown but rumor has it that it controls the flow of time. These inventions, created by genius minds, come with a cost; they defy physics thus they defy nature. The tower pierces the very heart of the town, pierces the Earth itself, and the plague was released by the Earth in retaliation. Earth’s children, animals or people who remain close to nature, are unaffected by the plague, but humans who defy it are not.\n\nThe earth itself seems alive in this town, and is responsible for the plague, albeit it was a reaction rather than an offensive move. The economic heart of the town is the slaughterhouse or abattoir, in which countless bulls were slaughtered. The blood of the bulls fed the earth, giving life to it. To cure the plague, the player must make a terrible decision, as the main ingredient to the cure is the “living blood” from the Earth. But, as with any living thing, drain its blood and it will die. Drain the blood of the Earth and kill it, killing its marvelous creatures like the Odongh and Albinos. Or you can preserve the earth at the cost of human life to the plague. The choice is yours in the end.\n\nThere is so much more to Pathologic 2 and isn’t even a complete story yet. It currently only has one protagonist and his story, but it will eventually gain two more like its predecessor.\n\nPenumbra is a PC exclusive episodic horror game which we constantly end up writing about because it does so many things right. Its story is one of the many things it does right.\n\nWe have talked quite a bit about its story, particularly in this article as well as this one, but we shall go into more detail here. Penumbra: Overture and Penumbra: Black Plague are the only episodes that concern us; Requiem does not add to the story so we will not speak of it. It’s not bad, it’s just useless.\n\nIn Penumbra you take on the role of Philip LaFresque, a 30 year old physics professor from England. Philip never knew his father, and one day he received a posthomous letter from him, trying to explain why he was never a part of Philip’s life. Work was too important to Philip’s father, more important than family. The letter also contained instructions to go to a bank in Mayfair, retrieve a specific safety deposit box, and destroy the contents inside. But instead of destroying them, Philip brought them to his University to have them deciphered. That was Philip’s first, and perhaps last mistake—simple curiosity, trying discover that which is not meant to be discovered. Not much was able to be deciphered, but they were able to decipher coordinates for an old, abandoned mine in Greenland. This is where Philip heads, and this is where the game takes place.\n\nThe first episode, Overture, starts off quite slow. As far as story goes, the most stand out elements in Overture are the ‘dialogues’ and monologues from the character referred to as Red, and the development of his character. His fate stands out as one of the most memorable moments in video game history. The plot also has a wonderful and mysterious twist at the end when the player comes across a large, mysterious, locked steel door with a blinding light shining through its window. The door is technologically advanced and has no business being in that old abandoned mine. Upon stepping through the door, it immediately becomes apparent that Philip not alone, that he’s being stalked. Philip is then knocked unconscious, Overture ends, and now you are ready to begin Black Plague.\n\nThe story picks up in Black Plague. The plot gets crazier, the game gets scarier, but it’s even more tightly crafted than Overture. The roller-coaster plot makes it seem longer than it actually is; both Black Plague and Overture are only around 4 hours each, so roughly 8 hours total. Throughout Black Plague Philip is infected with the so called ‘Black Plague’ (I don’t recall anything in-game calling it that, mind you) but the infection is incomplete. As a result, the virus manifests as a second personality which names itself Clarence. Clarence is listed as one of the greatest antagonists in video game history and he has more quotes than any other individual character or being in our best quotes article. He is truly a highlight of Black Plague, teasing and taunting the player at every step. There’s nothing you can do about it either.\n\nPenumbra has a silent protagonist like many other games, but they do a wonderful job making conversations feel two-way. Especially with Clarence—any player will be very responsive to Clarence, we assure you.\n\nClarence keeps things interesting and thought-provoking for a while, and as you near the end, questions start to get answered. We’re not going to repeat what we wrote here, when we discussed the main antagonist, the ending, and the meaning of the story in detail, so give that a read if you haven’t. It is a horrifying story on a cosmological scale, featuring an antagonist, a being, of unthinkable power and ancient origins. It’s really like something out of a Lovecraft story, but more direct. Despite being quite direct, the story comes off as powerful, and it still leaves room for thought since the ending of Black Plague is somewhat ambiguous. Also, unlike Lovecraft, the story doesn’t stop with the realization of the ancient otherworldly being. It goes farther than that.\n\nRequiem tries to shelve some of the ambiguity, which is a mistake. It was the answer to popular complaints about the fairly small amount of ambiguity at the end of Black Plague, complaints from people with no imagination or attention span. Think nothing of them. Play all three episodes yourself and come back and tell us if you disagree with our comments on Requiem and Black Plague. It adds nothing to the story.\n\nLike several other games on this list, the effectiveness of the storytelling of Penumbra is bolstered by a perfectly composed score and quality voice acting. Things like this go a long way. Penumbra is an outstanding all-around game and the story is one of its main highlights.\n\nIt is also clearly inspired by System Shock 2 and makes lots of nods to it; the enemies in both games are infected creatures and mostly humans at that (though System Shock 2 has a lot more variety), and the thing that is infecting them is part of a greater hive mind entity which appears as worms in both games, and this entity antagonizes the protagonist in both games. Both games have a similar scale and pace as well. System Shock 2 is a great game to borrow from.\n\n#10\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. NLC 7 (or NLC 7: I Am Marked One in general) is a total conversion modification for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl. It is the only modification featured in this article, although Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is made by a game development team that began as a modding team. But in every way, NLC 7 is incredibly professional, with its writing quality putting most games to shame. It is one of the more complex stories in this list, but succeeds on every level.\n\nIt is a complete re-imagining of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl, borrowing only a few of its plot elements but ultimately telling a totally different story (we’re about to spoil both, be warned). Shadow of Chernobyl’s story is simple but pretty good: you play as the mysterious “Marked One”, an amnesiac stalker in “The Zone” which is the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone transformed by a mysterious second disaster in 2006, resulting in anomalous energy formations, deadly mutants, wondrous “artifacts” that can make you rich (the main reason “Stalkers” enter The Zone), and supposedly a monolithic stone in the center that grants wishes which nobody knows how to reach due to the “Brain Scorcher” frying your brain if you try to approach the Pripyat and Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant area.\n\nIn Shadow of Chernobyl, you want to find out who you are and why your PDA says “Kill Strelok”. The only people who will help you is a series of black market traders who use you to discover the way to the center of The Zone (since you are a gunslinger of heroic proportions unlike in NLC 7), where it’s thought that an untouched klondike of unique artifacts can be found. And so you do just this: by obtaining important documents while raiding secret Soviet laboratories, Marked One discovers that the Brain Scorcher is in fact a man made device, and a scientist helps create a device that allows him to enter the area under the influence of the Brain Scorcher and turn it off. Then you reach the center of The Zone, find out that you actually are Strelok, and you were accidentally programmed to kill yourself.\n\nIn the canon ending, which the vast majority of players don’t even discover on their first attempt, you learn that the Wish Granter is merely an illusion and that The Zone is the Earth’s response to a Soviet super-consciousness (7 minds joined as one) trying to affect the Noosphere, supposedly looking to remove negative factors from humanity such as anger and cruelty and greed, but since they’re Soviets one can assume they want to achieve global mind control. And so marked stalkers such as Marked One are basically sleeper agents, programmed with a specific purpose in mind.\n\nIt’s a simple but interesting anti-Soviet story for an action FPS, but nothing worthy of being included in this article. It is lacking in character development, although the characters you do meet are at least presented as being a somewhat distinct and totally believable person, there’s just a lack of depth. The world building, while a good start, feels incomplete, so anyone can immediately see this game is a brilliant concept that misses more potential than it realizes. And of course, that potential is more fully realized in its source material, Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky brothers, and the film Stalker by Andrei Tarkvosky (for which the screenplay was written by the Strugatsky brothers).\n\nNLC 7: I Am Marked One decided to take a similar fundamental concept from these works, and make a new game that is more inspired by the source material, and more inspired by the designer’s experiences on the battlefield. The end result is a one of a kind gaming experience rich in philosophy, character development, and weird but intriguing fringe science leading to some thought provoking and very eerie existential horror.\n\nIn NLC 7, you play as Marked One again, and it even uses the same cinematic intro. Although this time you’re not a gunslinging hero of heroic proportions; you do not single handedly carve a path to the center of The Zone in NLC 7, others do a lot of heavy lifting. You are not the first to discover any secrets about The Zone either, others have before you and you are largely reliant on their discoveries.\n\nThe outline of the plot is similar for a little while: once again you are amnesiac and have a PDA that says “Kill Strelok”, you meet the same core characters like Sidorovich and Barkeep who again have you obtain classified documents from the military base in Agroprom and secret Soviet era laboratories. But the nature of all of that is totally different, the characters are used differently, the documents are fully fleshed out and different, and the plot and story deviate completely. For reference, Shadow of Chernobyl is a 20 hour game, while NLC 7 is longer than 100 hours easily.\n\nNow, where to begin with this massive, complex story? The world building which was obviously not complete or fully realized in Shadow of Chernobyl is far more complete in NLC 7. It is full of more stories, more inexplicable mysteries as expected for The Zone, making the entire setting out to be a more weird, unpredictable place as it is supposed to be.\n\nFor example, when the Brain Scorcher is disabled in NLC 7 (which you try to do, but fail to do and ultimately someone else succeeds at this, because NLC 7 doesn’t make you the only character capable of accomplishing anything), there are unexpected consequences. Now those near the center of The Zone don’t have their brains just melted like when the Scorcher was on, instead they feel apathy and powerlessness, they lose interest in everything. You will find groups of stalkers near the center of The Zone just sitting around talking about how pointless life is. This is the moment in the story (which you’ll come across probably 50-60 hours in) where you realize things are WAY more complicated and mysterious than you originally thought. The Brain Scorcher itself is a far more complex plot device than just an on/off kill switch, as you can see. In fact, after observing this field of apathy/powerlessness, the plot has you do more research into The Zone and correct your mistake: you must turn the Scorcher back on, though you can optionally re-calibrate it to not fry people’s brains.\n\nAnomalies are no longer just deadly pockets of common energy, they are much more varied and far more… anomalous. Some create their own stories and their own legends, the same for artifacts. You interact with them in new, bizarre ways. What was once just an isolated “gamey” mechanic of the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games is now its own thematic concept in NLC 7, and this is not the only example of NLC 7’s superior writing/world building and integration of different elements.\n\nThe writing of the quests is top tier unlike in Shadow of Chernobyl, being more logically open ended and having so many more impacts or consequences (more than most RPGs).\n\nMain quests now involve characters who clearly have their own reasons for being in The Zone, their own philosophies about The Zone, they are delightfully so much more human, being far more reminiscent of Tarkovsky’s film in particular. There is a notable amount of self-reflection in NLC 7 that is really well written, conveying just how complex a person can be, even someone who is not remarkable or some kind of genius. No, humans are complex, they can deceive your expectations, you can like them or hate them and feel betrayed by them, in this regard NLC 7 succeeds merely as a story about people.\n\nThis is one of the things the designer wanted to reflect: it’s better to work with people and act human yourself than to be a monster and just kill, a reflection of the designer’s experience in war (here is an interview transcript with him). Upon receiving a request that involves confronting soldiers (in Shadow of Chernobyl you shoot every soldier you come across except for two), he reminds you that they’re people too, which is one of many things that sets the tone for NLC 7. You are encouraged to finish it without ever shooting humans. It even subverts your expectations by late in the game making you question the ethics behind killing “zombies” (by introducing a character with some sort of medical background who believes they might not be a lost cause), only after you’ve already done a lot of this.\n\nHow do you pace such a lengthy story? It’s not easy, typically a 70-120 hour game story struggles with pacing issues and/or fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion after around 70 hours of build up. NLC 7 pulls it off. It knows exactly when to introduce a new element to throw you off; just when you think you’re coming to an understanding about something, all of a sudden a new question is raised that makes you doubt everything, and it’s brilliant. It also has some really brilliant foreshadowing.\n\nOne of the things about Shadow of Chernobyl is that the investigation into Strelok seems too distant. Throughout the game, you rely on Barkeep to decipher and dumb down documents for you, the information is filtered through him and you just take his word for things. In NLC 7 it is up to you to decipher all the vital information pertinent to the story that you come across. In the process of this, Strelok and his crew are developed into a multidimensional and complex cast, while in the original games Strelok is just another stalker looking to get rich and uncover the mysteries of the center of The Zone. Nothing else is known about the personalities of him and his team members Fang, Ghost, Doctor.\n\nWords might not be able to fully portray how different NLC 7 is, and how much more rich it is. But Strelok’s group is something far greater than a group of expert stalkers in NLC 7. Strelok is more of a scientist in fact, and he is obsessed with uncovering the secrets about The Zone (more specifically the Monolith aka Wish Granter) and fully devotes his life to it. Ghost wants to be a master of destinies, a kind of Messiah, and manipulates everyone to achieve his own ends. When you finally meet him and converse with him, the dialogue makes him out to almost be a much more intelligent villain than most games, except he’s not really a villain, just a guy you’re probably not going to like. Less is known about Fang, he serves the story more as a victim as he was a brave stalker who Strelok sacrificed just to learn something else about The Zone, but Fang embodies an important fringe science and existential element about the story, being a creepy introduction to it while also serving as foreshadowing; he has been changed by The Zone so much that if you work with the Ukrainian Ecologists to have him rescued and examined, they conclude he is technically no longer human based on his brain pattern and physiological changes. You first meet him in Strelok’s hideout in Agroprom Underground where his appearance is badly mutated and his mental state has deteriorated somewhat, although he is capable of some coherent thought. But when exposed to the surface, he becomes like the “zombies” in the game. Through him, several ideas are initially introduced about the “zombies” in NLC 7 and the larger thematic scope about the Monolith’s mental influence and the nature of some mental illnesses like schizophrenia (introducing a theory that some cases are caused by people being disassociated with time, which does fit into the general symptoms of schizophrenics being unable to properly perceive reality), which we will go more into later.\n\nStrelok’s group is larger in NLC 7, it is a group of scientists studying The Zone after already having learned something about some of its secrets. Throughout NLC 7, you uncover more and more information discovered by this group, and you meet some of its key members such as Ivar (who at the same time encapsulates the basis of the cut storyline about Baldy and his group). More and more NLC 7’s story introduces its fringe science and existentialism through these guys and their studies of The Zone.\n\nThe Monolith faction (worshipers and defenders of the Monolith/Wish Granter) is also properly developed into a group with its own ideology. With this and many other accomplishments, NLC 7 applies logic to where there are inconsistencies and plot holes in Shadow of Chernobyl. NLC 7 has no C-Consciousness, it isn’t an anti-Soviet story anymore. The Monolith/Wish Granter is revealed to be an alien thing, the result of a “collision of worlds” – whether it comes from some other, immaterial dimension, or if it just reaches across different universes within the multiple worlds theory of quantum physics is unclear. But NLC 7 doesn’t violate the basics of any established science here.\n\nThe Monolith is merely the manifestation if it in our world. It is like an information virus, it feeds off of “mental images”, replenishing its own telepathic energies. And it seeks to expand its sphere of influence. Strelok’s notes use a computer virus analogy; in order to spread its influence, it attracts people to the center of The Zone, through its apparently limited influence over the Noosphere (causing people to generally be drawn to the center of The Zone without realizing why and without realizing they’re being manipulated), and most of all by creating artifacts to draw people more naturally (since it is not capable of fully manipulating humanity through the Noosphere). And when it makes contact with people, it substitutes a part of their consciousness with its own programming, essentially spreading its influence like a virus. The person is not entirely reprogrammed, but after this they’re no longer drawn to the Monolith, and will only feel apathy and powerlessness when near it (this is how it gets them to leave and spread its influence away from The Zone).\n\nIt is also revealed that the Monolith invaded our universe about 100 years prior, and is responsible for increased rate of mental illness in humanity. That is its influence. And some of those it reprogrammed to be defenders against those who wish it harm – the Monolith faction, which is not openly hostile to you in NLC 7. You get to meet their ringleader, Charon (actually Lebedev from Clear Sky, he was ‘reprogrammed’ into Charon), and read about his philosophies which provides insight into what it’s like to receive the call of the Monolith, developing the faction into something fleshed out unlike in the original game.\n\nI do wish the science of this story delved deeper into quantum physics, which could’ve been what Strelok’s group was studying (or part of it). Existential horror by providing terrifying answers to real world issues (mental health crisis, which also happens to coincide with the ongoing mass extinction event and increasing natural disasters) that also satisfy current scientific theories is one of the most effective forms of existential horror.\n\nThis also explains how the Monolith faction members can withstand the effects of the Brain Scorcher: many of the faction members predate the construction of the Brain Scorcher, since the Monolith made contact with our world 100 years ago, and since Monolith faction members have the Monolith’s “signature” programmed into its consciousness (computer virus analogy again), the Scorcher can theoretically be programmed to not affect those with its signature.\n\nBut NLC 7 is wise enough to not answer all questions. The exact mechanics to how it works are not fully understood, only just enough is understood to tell a coherent story while leaving a believable amount of mystery that does not leave any plot holes. The Brain Scorcher seems like it was constructed by perhaps Soviets to suppress the Monolith’s influence, but I’m not entirely sure. And the nature of the Marked One is also totally different; apparently he was someone in the process of being reprogrammed by the Monolith, but intercepted by Strelok or Ivar or someone in that circle, and then further reprogrammed by Strelok himself.\n\nThe existential terror here is powerful. This monolithic crystal is some kind of cosmic entity that invaded our world nearly undetected. It seems to have the power of a deity. It does not merely destroy like some simple beast, it gradually but perhaps methodically influences human conscience on a planetary scale, and in negative ways. After the Brain Scorcher is disabled, we see that this entity has the ability to wipe all emotion from people. What if it did this across our entire planet? Or what if this rise in mental illness continues to get worse, how far will that go? Will it stop with humans? How do you stop it?\n\nThen there’s the “Black Mark” artifact, a thing of legend that causes serious debuffs if you have it. Whoever has it cannot get rid of it by conventional means, they can only be rid of it by getting someone to willingly take it from them. You can receive it by killing people, suggesting it is almost like some kind of curse or omen. So it is possible to never receive it. Multiple theories are presented in-game about it; some say it helps spread the Monolith’s influence, but Strelok sees it as some sort of important key that might help resist its influence. But the fact that you receive it when killing people can lead to its own theories. Very late in the game, you can do a main quest that results in a team of Mercenaries giving you a strange tool that looks like a container of some kind, that can supposedly allow you to pick up a Gauss Rifle (normally it drops out of your hands, and if someone without a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. tattoo picks it up, they disintegrate), but the effects of possessing this tool resemble that of the Black Mark…\n\nThe way this is all presented in NLC 7 is perfect. It is existential science fiction that doubles as a rich character study and horror game. It is a story about individuality and how one’s actions can affect so many lives around them. To make it more powerful, it provides multiple ways to complete quests and is extremely responsive to them. It can make you regret or even fear your actions, you will go from being excited about collecting artifacts at first to being suspicious of them once learning that they might be bait by the Monolith. And all of those theories and partial explanations about the Monolith come from just one group of people, you’re taking their word for it. The superpower of the center of The Zone does not come and explain everything in NLC 7, unlike Shadow of Chernobyl where the C-Consciousness explains everything and leaves only a little bit of ambiguity (purely about its motives). The Monolith in NLC 7 is also an alien creature that reminds me a bit of Solaris in how truly alien it is and how it absorbs something from everyone it reaches out to, with this leading to existential horror in both works.\n\n#9\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords is nothing like your traditional Star Wars story. It is far more ambitious, philosophic, and morally ambiguous. It is not just a tale of good versus evil. The game uses role-playing to greatly bolster its storytelling, and the characters are not one-dimensional. Much of the story involves one character, Kreia, showing the player character many different aspects of morality, some of which are seemingly more aligned toward light while others dark. But it is always up to the player to form conclusions, as it is never perfectly clear. This Kreia is one of the best characters ever written for a video game, and Knights of the Old Republic II has many other complex, well-written, and memorable characters throughout. On that note, it is incredible how responsive the characters are to the player’s influence—far more than most other RPGs even.\n\nThe entire game builds up wonderfully to several different points. Kreia judges you throughout, and is again alarmingly responsive to the player’s decisions and dialogue choices. Why does she judge and mentor you? This doesn’t become clear for a long time, as this is a lengthy game at around 60 hours long. The Force plays a major role in the story of Knights of the Old Republic II; it is often referred to as alive and having a will of its own, and that it connects all life together and with this connection our actions affect all others, for better or worse. This is stated in order to make you think about your actions before doing them, and it’s an interesting implication to think about and explained in such a way that translates to reality.\n\nBut this connection can be abused. It can be used to track Force sensitive people, as they are of course more easily detectable through the Force. This connection to all life can even be fed on, perhaps even destroyed, and herein lies some of the ideas behind the game’s plot and antagonists.\n\nBut think back to this idea that the Force connects all life together; what would happen if a massive loss of life occurred all at once? Such as the destruction of a planet? If even minor actions create ripples that have far reaching consequences (again, an interesting moral concept that can be taken from the game), what about an event as devastating as the simultaneous death of billions? The consequences would be unimaginable.\n\nNeedless to say, such events are referred to in the game, and are very important to the story. One such event, which occurred prior to the game, is revealed to have been caused by the protagonist and one of the game’s companions. This event occurred on a Sith planet called Malachor V during the Mandalorian Wars—a crucial conflict also explored in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. To cut a long story short, during this war, the protagonist, canonically referred to as Meetra Surik now, and serving under Revan, commanded the use of a superweapon created by one of the game’s companions, and this superweapon wiped out the planet. It also essentially ended the war. To end the war, but at what cost? This event was so traumatizing to the protagonist that, according to the Jedi, it caused him/her to lose his/her connection to the force, making him/her a wound in the Force and also making Malachor V a similar wound. The Jedi say that the protagonist had to sever themselves from the Force in order to survive. Had the protagonist not lost his/her connection to the Force, the result may have been as described as the quote at the top of this page.\n\nThis concept, boiling down to catastrophic events with mass loss of life having further reaching consequences, damaging and endangering all life, is the anti-war cry of Knights of the Old Republic II. It is a motif that it carries throughout. It is also a metaphor for PTSD, as these major events are ultimately a form of trauma from an extremely devastating war, and it affects every major character in the game.\n\nKreia understands that all life is connected through the Force, she understands the dangers of wounds in the Force, and she strongly believes the Force has a will of its own, a will that is exploited by some of the other antagonists. This caused her to hate the Force, and she later reveals this is why she sought out the player character; in the player character, Kreia sees the potential death of the Force, as Master Vrook and other members of the Jedi Council also did. Only this did not scare Kreia like it scared the Jedi Council – it aligned with her intention of destroying the Force. To turn away from something as powerful as the Force is demonstration of power, force of will in its own right, something she mentions several times throughout the game to the point where it serves as foreshadowing.\n\nIn essence, a series of many terrible events such as Malachor V, and also the power of two of her apprentices who appear as game antagonists, are the reason as to why Kreia hates the Force. And it is a reason one can relate to, as told by the game’s story. We are all slaves to the Force, so Kreia’s goal can even be seen as noble, despite her being a Sith lord. But Kreia does not entirely believe in Sith ideology, nor does she entirely disbelief in Jedi ideology, she is one of the best “grey” characters ever written for a game.\n\nAnother interesting element about Knights of the Old Republic II is that it is more of a Torment game than a Star Wars game, with regards to its writing. Guilt and regret are recurring themes throughout the game, combined with the fact that the player character has a unique power (being a wound in the Force) which they can use for good or evil throughout the game. Just like the writer’s (Chris Avellone’s) definitive masterpiece, Planescape: Torment. KOTOR 2 is the second Torment game. I highly encourage doing a Torment series marathon in the following order: Planescape: Torment, Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer, and KOTOR 2. Interestingly enough, one of the three antagonists in KOTOR 2, Darth Nihilus, can even be linked to the protagonist of Mask of the Betrayer should they attain the most evil ending in the game. They have the same signature power.\n\nKnights of the Old Republic II is deeply rooted in morality and asks many questions, it is filled with complex themes and characters, and has more role-playing than most other RPGs. All of this results in some impressive, but not flawless storytelling. Perhaps it would have been flawless had LucasArts (the publisher) not rushed it. Knights of the Old Republic II is one of the most rushed games in history, being a 60 hour RPG that branches out substantially, and being made in only 14 months at most. This is a testament to the incredible talent possessed by Obsidian Entertainment, especially considering this was their debut title! Their first ever video game as a company.\n\nBut this rushed development, clearly an unwise decision commanded by publisher greed, has clear consequences. Some characters are far more developed than others, and it is clear that Obsidian had greater plans in mind for most of the characters. Under specific circumstances, depending on the player’s decisions throughout the game, various ending segments are clearly rushed, mostly with regards to the fate of some of the game’s characters. A few plot holes are also created, particularly if using The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (although we highly encourage using the mod anyway for the fixes and restored content). Some pacing issues are also present, particularly earlier in the game. No doubt that if Obsidian was given a much longer development cycle, the story would have fallen together much better, and it would have resulted in this game getting a better spot on our list.\n\nIt is a story that sticks with you, as it is particularly easy to relate to. What is most surprising is that this story belongs to the Star Wars franchise. There is honestly nothing else remotely close to Knights of the Old Republic II within the Star Wars franchise, the complexity and moral ambiguity here is on a totally different level. It elevates the entire Star Wars franchise, highlighting the potential it has. But it also stands alone as far as Star Wars franchise entries go, with no equal.\n\n#8\n\n“In the waning years of the Third Era of Tamriel, a prisoner born on a certain day to uncertain parents was sent under guard, without explanation, to Morrowind, ignorant of the role he was to play in that nation’s history…” – Narrator\n\nGame Title: The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind\n\nDeveloper: Bethesda Game Studios\n\nPublisher: Bethesda Softworks\n\nRelease Date: 2002\n\nPlatforms: PC, XBOX\n\nGenre: Action RPG\n\nApproximate Length: 150-200 hours\n\nPlot Involves Saving the World?: Yes\n\nIf you have only played more recent games created by Bethesda Game Studios, such as Fallout 3, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Fallout 4, and/or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, then you may be surprised to find one of their games featured in this article. The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind was not written by the same writers as their later games, which is why its writing quality is on a completely different level. There are no real similarities between Morrowind’s writing style and approach and the later games, other than the fact that the protagonist is a special hero that is a prisoner at the start of the game, and the later Elder Scrolls games also have books scattered around the world filled with lore.\n\nWhere to begin with this open world epic game? At the start of Morrowind, you witness a dream of the protagonist in which the Goddess Azura speaks to the protagonist, telling him that he has been chosen. Also during this intro, words of the Nerevarine prophecy are put on screen for the player to read (quoted above). So right away, this idea is planted in your head about you being some legendary hero named Indoril Nerevar reborn.\n\nThe protagonist was a prisoner in an unspecified foreign land for an unspecified crime (unspecified for role-playing purposes), but was hand picked by the Emperor to be sent to Morrowind (island of Vvardenfell) on a top secret task. So right when you arrive, you are given a task of delivering an encrypted package to someone who you don’t know anything about. Off you go, like a newborn baby seeing the world for the first time. And what a visual spectacle this world is, especially with graphics mods enabled.\n\nThere are no objective markers; you are told where to go and given realistic directions on how to get there, and there are signs around the game world that can help you navigate. No hand holding here.\n\nOnce you deliver the encrypted package, the story picks up slightly, but the pacing is still distinctively slow compared to other games. Turns out this individual you delivered the package to is a member of the Blades, the secretive spy organization for the Emperor. You are immediately inducted into the Blades’ service as a low level recruit. But before you can advance this storyline, the recipient of this package and your new supervisor Caius (Grand Spymaster) tells you to go out into the world, understand the lore and its people, and gain a reputation. Become known. Then you can move on.\n\nThis is bold and, as it turns out, brilliant storytelling for an RPG. At first glance, its intentions seem obvious: the game wants the player to explore and learn about the lore behind the world. But why? Why does the player have to do this? Because it actually makes sense within the story as you would eventually find out. Jumping ahead a ton, the Emperor was well aware of the Nerevarine prophecies. You see, Nerevar is a legendary hero of this land. He united all of his people; both the Ashlanders and the Great Houses, which means he knew this land and its people better than anyone. The Nerevarine is his reincarnation and must once more reunite the Dunmer people, and remember that the game opens up telling you that you are the Nerevarine. The Emperor sent you to Vvardenfell to fulfill the Nerevarine prophecies, so Caius was given these orders which he relayed to you. To become the Nerevarine, you must know this land and its people in order to reunite them just as Nerevar once did.\n\nAnd don’t think that the game starting off by telling you that you are the Nerevarine is a cheap storytelling tactic. It becomes obvious later on that there is cleverness behind this as well; as you progress through the story, learning about the Nerevarine prophecies and how there are different versions of this and different variations on the legend of Indoril Nerevar, one particularly wise Ashlander Wise Woman is able to convince you that you are not yet Nerevarine, but you can become the Nerevarine. Here, the game throws a curve ball at the player and makes you question whether or not you truly are the Nerevarine.\n\nFurthermore, if you commit heinous acts of crime during the main quest, you will be told that you’ve thrown the Nerevarine prophecies completely off track and set into motion terrible events. With this, we have a level of role-playing and character agency never before seen in The Elder Scrolls franchise. You can say “screw this prophecy” and go turn the world upside down on its head, like various great RPGs that came before it.\n\nBut taking a step back, the player is encouraged to explore the world, talk to people in its various cities as well as the Ashlander camps, and reading political and religious books in particular. You cannot advance the story without doing this, and it makes perfect sense within the plot to be doing this. Quite a clever way of forcing the player’s hand to stop playing the game as if it were a corridor shooter.\n\nAnd this portion of Morrowind leads to some really impressive writing. Unlike… any other game developed by Bethesda Game Studios, this story puts political and religious themes on the forefront, making it not a story just focused on being a hero and fulfilling a prophecy to save the world and destroy some evil. Let’s start with the whole “get to know the people and gain a reputation” angle: during this quest (which again has no objective markers, they are not present in this game at all to encourage exploration and thinking) you will learn that there are three Great Houses present in the district of Vvardenfell (the game’s setting), and you can join any of the three. These Great Houses are House Redoran, House Hlaalu, and House Telvanni.\n\nIn addition to the Great Houses, there are various Ashlander tribes around the world; tribes of Dunmer who stick to old traditions that predate the game’s predominant religion of the Tribunal. The other local/native factions in the game include the Morag Tong, a unique lawful assassin’s guild (that’s right), and Twin Lamps (rebellious anti-slavery movement that isn’t entirely local). Beyond this, you may join foreign factions such as the Imperial Legion, the superpower of the game’s universe that controls the entire continent and is governed by the Emperor. There is also the Mages Guild and Fighters Guild, which are self-explanatory and based out of the Imperial City in Cyrodiil, so they are very much in line with the Imperial Legion, and the Thieves Guild which is again self explanatory. Plenty of other factions exist in the game, but cannot be joined by the player.\n\nYou will learn the lore behind each of these factions, and they are truly unique and fleshed out which is a feat for video game writing. Very good writing here, but no doubt the game focuses more on all of the native factions which have more direct exposition than the others. These factions, especially the local/native ones of present and especially past, make up for the bulk of the game’s political themes. One of the key factors in choosing which Great House to support (if any) is the idea of whether or not the province of Morrowind should fight to break away from the Imperial Legion and become independent, or whether it should succumb to Imperial rule. The player is not pushed heavily in either direction, although it is certain that Indoril Nerevar would have fought for Morrowind’s freedom as he had done in the past when he still lived.\n\nBut even heavier political themes are unraveled when exploring the factions of the past, which includes the Ashlander Tribes which are still present during the game’s story. Morrowind really has the player studying the history of the game world, most particularly War of the First Council. In a nutshell (and I am greatly simplifying the lore here), Indoril Nerevar had united the Dwemer and Chimer (Chimer are the predecessors of the Dunmer, before they were “Dark Elves”) to drive off Nordic invaders, liberating Morrowind and securing its independence and freedom. Note that even this manifests in the game as its own story, it is not just glossed over. So Nerevar was already a legend at this point. But, as Nerevar’s advisors anticipated, the peace did not last. The Dwemer were a unique Elven race known for their technological advancement: nobody else in the world was comparable, and rather than worshiping spirits they worshiped their own machine creations. They made their own gods. Totally unlike everyone else in The Elder Scrolls universe.\n\nThe Dwemer lived primarily underground, always digging and mining for materials since they were engineers after all. At some point they unearthed something that was not meant to be found: the Heart of Lorkhan. This is an ancient sacred artifact of unimaginable power, and it brings its own story to the game. Essentially, Lorkhan was a God that created the Mortal Plane (Nirn) against the wishes of the other gods, so as punishment his heart was ripped from him. The gods could not destroy this heart, so they sent it down into Nirn and did their best to hide it so that it would never be found. The Heart ended up creating the Red Mountain in the center of Vvardenfell, which is a massive volcano. Again, I’m really simplifying everything here.\n\nWell, the Dwemer accidentally unearthed the Heart of Lorkhan, and of course they wanted to utilize its power. House Dagoth, one of Morrowind’s Great Chimer Houses and perhaps the most cunning one, led by Voryn Dagoth at the time, was able to discover that the Dwemer had found the Heart of Lo"
