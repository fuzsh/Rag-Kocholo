        "text": "Switch to Jack and destroy a parrot stand behind the cannon, then move forward and destroy another Parrot Stand on the left. You'll receive a Minikit. Use your compass and select the option at the top, then follow the dots to find it. Grab a shovel to dig up several pieces, then assemble them into a light. Pick up the light and place it on the green rectangle to the left in between the gears. Pick up the two gold objects in the room (you may need to smash some stuff to see them) and place them on the two movable structures, then use the handles to turn them. Aim the beam of light at the golden skull.\n\nIn Free Play mode, switch to Syrena at this point in the battle and use her ability to break some shiny objects in the water in the top right of the room. Swim into another room and switch to a character who can blow things up. Blow up everything here to reveal a man who wants a telescope. Swim back into the previous room and switch to Serena again, now breaking some shiny objects underwater on the left side of the room. Swim into the next room and switch to Cursed Jack, then use his compass ability to point in the direction of the telescope. Grab it, then bring it back to the man for a Minikit.\n\nReturn to the room where Jack found the telescope. Back on the surface, you'll come to a wall with gold skulls and several gears. Use the action button to rotate the gears until the colors correspond (red skull over red box) and push the two white objects along the tracks into the wall. The red box will be replaced by a yellow one, so repeat the process by turning the gears and getting yellow over yellow, then push the objects into the wall again. Do this for blue as well. For the last part, you'll need to combine colors, so the yellow and blue skull should be over the green box, blue and red over purple, and red and yellow over orange. Repeat the full process for each color combination and you'll be rewarded with a Minikit once all the boxes are gone.\n\nSwitch to Jack and use his compass to find a golden dog. Switch to a character with super jump and grab onto a rope nearby. The dog will move and you'll earn a Minikit.\n\nSwitch to Cursed Jack and use his compass to find a golden hat underwater. Pick up the hat, then put it on top of a nearby statue for a Minikit.\n\nWalk underwater and head to the left of where you placed the golden hat until you find a tunnel. Walk into it and use Jack's compass to find an oyster. Switch to a character with super strength who can breathe underwater and pull on the orange bar. You'll open the oyster and find a Minikit.\n\nIn the same area (where you found the oyster), swim up to the surface and switch to a character with projectiles. Aim at a target on the boat in front of you. Jump up the green bars to get to a platform near the top of the ship, then jump up a second set of green bars to the left. Jump to a chain and slide across it to another platform, then head right to find a Minikit.\n\nFinally, switch to Blackbeard and jump down one level. Head right and use his ability to open a chest, then build a cannon and light it with a torch nearby. Shoot five ducks to make a Minikit appear in the water."
