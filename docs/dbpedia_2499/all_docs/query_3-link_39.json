        "text": "The claim: Bill Gates created a video game called 'Omicron' in 1999\n\nSocial media users are linking a video game to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and the omicron coronavirus variant, playing into debunked conspiracy theories that Gates planned and engineered the COVID-19 pandemic or is implementing microchips through the vaccines.\n\n\"'Omicron' was the name of a 1999 video game by Microsoft – Bill Gates – about demons pretending to be humans and harvesting their souls\" reads the text on an image posted to Facebook on Dec. 13.\n\nThe post accumulated more than 1,200 interactions within two days. Twitter users also shared the claim, and similar versions spread on TikTok.\n\nOne Facebook commenter wrote, \"Seriously?! Wow....just a coincidence tho.\"\n\nBut it's not true.

In 2000, it was released on the Dreamcast game console.\n\nThe game is set in a futuristic city called Omikron, in an alternate dimension. Players engage in combat to prevent their characters' souls from being captured by demons.\n\nFact check: 1963 movie did not predict the 'Omicron Variant'\n\nSince May the World Health Organization has been using Greek letters to name coronavirus variants to make it easier for nonscientific communities. The word \"omicron\" is the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet. Some of the other variants include alpha, beta and delta.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Gates created a video game called “Omicron” in 1999.
