        "text": "is the Stand of Mannish Boy, featured in the third part of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, Stardust Crusaders.\n\nIt has the formidable power to attack its victims in their dreams, luring their spirits into its own nightmare world where they have no power to retaliate.\n\nAppearance\n\nAppearing similarly to the depiction of its corresponding Tarot card, Death Thirteen appears as a large cloaked humanoid figure in the image of a Grim Reaper, armed with a great scythe.\n\nIts face has the design of a Venetian carnival mask[2] with empty, upward-curved eyes with a slim triangle ending in a dot under each, a sphere on the tip of a nose like that a clown may wear, a static smile, an oval pad on the chin, and prominent cheekbones. Its expression never changes. In place of human ears, Death Thirteen has large, rimmed holes. Death Thirteen wears a hat resembling a mitre with a metallic rim decorated with small cylinders and a metallic oval on the front of the hat bearing a vertical groove with horizontal bands running down it like a ladder. The hat also has a metallic band with a circle in the center on the forehead and metallic circles where the ears should be.\n\nDeath Thirteen wears a large, dark cloak with metallic shoulder pads attached to it. The collar of the shoulder pads is comprised of three stacked rings. The bottom ring has an open front from which a rectangle with a fishnet pattern travels down the cloak, ending with rounded corners and in a pattern of slim light and dark triangles arranged horizontally. Only Death Thirteen's arms, which are entirely metallic, emerge from the cloak. Death Thirteen wields a massive scythe with a metallic pole.\n\nThe cloak worn by Death Thirteen is deceiving as Death Thirteen actually has no body underneath. The Stand comprises only its head, shoulders, and arms.[3]\n\nColor Schemes\n\nThe series is known for alternating colors between media, the information presented below may or may not be canon.\n\nPersonality\n\nAs an extension of Mannish Boy's mind, Death Thirteen has a vulgar and sadistic personality, delighting in the suffering of those who fall into its dream world. It enjoys insulting them and toying with them before killing them with its scythe, such as when it makes Noriaki Kakyoin eat eyeballs[4] or when it traps the rest of the Joestar Group with their own body parts and apparel.[5] Because no Stand user trapped in its dream world can use their Stands, Death Thirteen is supremely confident in its ability to eliminate the Joestar Group.[4]\n\nDeath Thirteen tends to shout \"Lali-ho\" in joy while torturing its victims.\n\nIt represents the tarot card Death, which symbolizes self-awareness and transformation.[6]\n\nAbilities\n\nDeath Thirteen is unique in that it can only exist inside a dream world and thus requires that its victims are asleep. It is incredibly dangerous because it is certain to take people by surprise and it was only through chance that the Joestar Group survived its encounter. It is offset by the fact that the user, a baby at that, is defenseless when everyone is awake and cannot attract suspicion.\n\nDream World Control\n\nThis ability comes in two parts. When anything alive (human or otherwise) falls asleep near Mannish Boy, Death Thirteen's user, they are drawn into Death Thirteen's dream world, which appears as a massive carnival, complete with Ferris wheels and roller coasters.[7]\n\nDeath Thirteen has full control over this dream world. It is able to make death machines out of mechanical items, summon objects out of nothing, manipulate Polnareff's hair or Joseph's hand, basically shaping everything as it sees fit.[5] However, the most redoubtable property of this dream world is that Stand users cannot summon their Stand inside the dream world and are defenseless.[8] Death Thirteen explains that because Stands are made of spiritual energy, during their sleep, their spirits are \"off-guard\" and cannot defend themselves, thus Users cannot conjure Stands.[5] However, someone who falls asleep (or unconscious) with their Stand active beforehand will be able to summon the Stand inside the dream world.[3]\n\nNo one can willingly wake up from the dream world,[4] but they can be normally woken up by someone else and thus saved temporarily.[7] When they wake up, the surviving victims won't be able to remember anything from the dream but will still feel the dread they've had, giving the impression of a nightmare.[7] However, someone who manages to bring their Stand into the dream world will remember the dream.[3]\n\nIn the dream world, Death Thirteen is free to torment and kill anyone inside the dream with its scythe. Any injuries the person receives in the dream world are transferred to the real world, including fatal ones.[7] Inversely, it can also heal wounds if coerced, thus healing Kakyoin's cuts,[3] which transfers into the real world too.\n\nIf Death Thirteen is obliged to fight a Stand, it remains dangerous because of its mastery over the surrounding world, but is also very fragile and weak, relying on scythe sweeps to wound. Thus, it was easily defeated by Hierophant Green.[3]\n\nChapters / Episodes\n\nVideo Games\n\nJoJo RPG (SFC)\n\nUnlike the original storyline, in the game, Mannish Boy attacks the entire group from inside a plane en route to India. During the battle, Death Thirteen's main attack consists of using its scythe several times.\n\nCapcom Fighters\n\nJoJo's Venture & Heritage for the Future (Arcade/DC)\n\nDeath Thirteen appears as a secret boss in Story Mode. The conditions for fighting him are different in both games but after completing them as someone in the Joestar Group, the player will face Death Thirteen. The fight is optional and Story Mode will continue as normal even when losing.\n\nIn Heritage for the Future, 's Story Mode is set around Mannish Boy trapping Kakyoin in a bizarre dream as revenge for an earlier encounter.\n\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure (PS1)\n\nWith the addition of Super Story Mode, Death Thirteen appears as a battle in the plot. Mannish Boy traps the Joestar Group in a dream and Kakyoin must defeat him using Hierophant Green. Death Thirteen's special battle can be unlocked in Book Mode, but the player can only play as one of the Joestar Group (including Young Joseph and New Kakyoin).\n\nEyes of Heaven (Various)\n\nGallery\n\nTrivia\n\nHis repeated phrase \"Lali-ho\" is possibly a reference to the original name of the sleep spell in the Dragon Quest series, itself a reference to the rallying cry of The Impossibles. Some months before Death Thirteen's debut, Araki was among the many Weekly Shonen Jump artists photographed in Dragon Quest cosplay for their 1990 No. 6 cover celebrating the fourth installment.\n\nReferences"
