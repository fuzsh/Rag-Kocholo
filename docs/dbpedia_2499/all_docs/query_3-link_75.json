Lucas in SSBB was probably the last one i had never heard of until i played the SSB game he showed up in.\n\nevery other new comer from SSB4 and SSBU i've known in some form before their SSB debut. even Terry i knew about him before SSB.\n\nleder\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n7,131\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\n#30\n\nIce Climbers, Marth, Roy, Game & Watch.\n\nBy Brawl I was a big enough nerd to know everyone (including 99% of the ATs and stickers).\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\n#31\n\nAs a kid I didn't know anything about Samus, Capt.Falcon, or Ness.\n\nThen Melee came out and I didn't know anything about Ice Climbers, G&W, or the Fire Emblem characters Marth or Roy.\n\nWith Brawl and Smash 4, I didn't know anything about the Fire Emblem characters there, either.\n\nThe newest Smash Bros. has Fire Emblem and Xenoblade characters that I didn't know anything about beforehand.\n\nHet_Nkik\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n3,633\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\n#32\n\nI'm old so I knew all the big characters.

Impossible, I refuse to believe it.\n\nOP is lying about Cloud unless they learned about the concept of video games during the year that Smash Wii U released. For like a million reasons, it's impossible to be into video games and have never seen or heard of Cloud.\n\n...why would I make this up? I'm not joking.\n\nI had no interest in Final Fantasy, never played any of the games and none of my friends did either.\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\n#40\n\nI mean, back when I was a kid Smash was one of the first series I got into, so most of the characters were new to me. I recognized a few of the Melee additions I guess.\n\nGoing by the numbering on the Smash website, ROB is probably the newest character that I wasn't previously familiar with. I've known every other character from Brawl onwards.\n\ndarksider321\n\nDec 8, 2020\n\n681\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\n#41\n\nI admit when Byleth was annouced, i had no idea who the hell that character was considering that the most popular characters from the three houses were Edelgard, Dimitri and Claude at the time when i didn't look too much into the game.\n\nOn a somewhat related note, I didn't know who the hell Geese Howard was considering my knowledge of SNK lore is very limited among king of fighters and having somewhat known reference of terry with his hat. Back then, Tekken never got any guest character among Gon and Akuma so I actually thought he was an original character for the game. It wasn't until I researched about it that i found out how badass he actually is from hiss original games.\n\nUncle at Nintendo\n\n▲ Legend ▲\n\nJan 3, 2018\n\n8,919\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\n#42\n\nCaptain Falcon\n\nNess\n\nSamus\n\nHad no idea who these were back in 1999.\n\nDougieflesh\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n31,652\n\nMilky Way Ghetto\n\nHours Left\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n18,805\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\n#44\n\nSmash hasn't introduced me to any characters, I was aware of their existence beforehand.\n\nSargerus\n\n▲ Legend ▲\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n21,491\n\nGiga Man\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n21,798\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\n#48\n\nNot knowing who Sephiroth is is easier than not knowing who Cloud is. I don't play Final Fantasy games, but I've seen Cloud plenty of times in fan media.\n\nZoomer thread? Zoomer thread.\n\nZoomers are more likely to know who Cloud is than boomers.\n\nHustleBun\n\nNov 12, 2017\n\n6,077\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\n#49\n\n...why would I make this up? I'm not joking.\n\nThe reason no one believes you is because Cloud is everywhere. If you said you hadn't played FF7 or realized that was the game he was from, that makes sense. You lost people by saying you had never even heard of Cloud. Cloud has been in multiple game cameos, he was in a movie, he's been referenced in other movies and TV shows, on the cover of magazines and even products like Cup Ramen and Butterfinger candy bars. Cloud has also been a \"dream character\" referenced in Smash discussions for nearly 20 years. And while we're at it, you can't post on a gaming forum anywhere without seeing Cloud pop up.\n\nI mean it's possible you're not joking. But the reasons above are why we're mostly assuming it was a prank or a troll post.\n\nReal question- were you fairly new to gaming when Smash Wii U released?"
