        "text": "This new operator in Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Warzone is a former soldier of the Italian special forces and isa realistic representation of Fabio Rovazzi (an Italian singer well known beyond the Alps) The style of this character is indeed inspired by movie genre \"western-spaghetti\" which revived the trend of westerns in Italy thanks to extremely talented directors and castings of famous actors to the origin of memorable films. The classic beret is here replaced by a fanciful cowboy hat and a stylish poncho. Add to that the gun-wielding and iconic beard of western actors, and meet new badass operator, Morte.\n\n\"Becoming a character in Call of Duty has always been a secret and impossible dream for me\" - said Rovazzi - \" there are no words to describe my excitement at the idea of lending my voice and my appearance to a operator. I also like the fact of paying homage to the tradition of Italian Western. When I think that millions of players will be able to play with my character, I feel flattered and satisfied, it is beyond all my expectations \".\n\nMorte's journey is very intriguing. The character played by Rovazzi, whose real name is Sergio Sulla, was a young Salernois passionate about Western and dreaming of upholding the law. However, his wishes were quickly dashed by his strong temperament, which in fact led him into the juvenile justice system, for having \"vigorously defended\" the unfortunate against local bullies. Cut off from his route to the police, he enlisted as a volunteer with Colonel Moschin, serving in Iraq and Libya. But after some time, even the military proved unsuitable for Sergio, who has now become the Warcom operator named Morte, a nickname symbolizing a final tribute to his dream, “death,” the bounty hunter who wanted to be sheriff.\n\nMorte has now joined Captain Price, Ghost, Gaz and the other legendary Call of Duty characters in Modern Warfare and Warzone."
