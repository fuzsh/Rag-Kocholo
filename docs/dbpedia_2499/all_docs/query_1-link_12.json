Click party, click on enemy , wait for party to autoattack enemy to death, click on next enemy, rinse and repeat. ♥♥♥♥ing hell. And I thought KOTOR's combat system was a yawnfest but this beats it by miles. Does that at some point move to a more complex combat like Dragon Age or something or does it stay that way?",
