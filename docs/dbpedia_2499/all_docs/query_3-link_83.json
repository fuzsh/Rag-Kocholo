System Shock 2\n\nLike System Shock 1, there will be persistent levels (i.e., drop an item on one level, and you could go back later to retrieve it), gameplay elements like logs, inventory, skills, persistent world, leaning, hacking, rpg elements, multiple weapons and enemies, and a compelling storyline. Unlike most other first person shooters, the purpose of System Shock was not to kill everything in sight; nor was it a \"find the key to move onto the next level\" game. The plot was always present, but not so confining as in traditional shooters - there was almost always more than one task to accomplish. Levels were realistically designed and had logical reasons behind them. It is the principle of System Shock 2 to continue this game design. [sshock2.com]\n\n92\n\nMetascore\n\n6. Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings\n\nAge of Empires II: The Age of Kings is the sequel to the award-winning, best-selling real-time strategy game \"Age of Empires.\" Age of Empires II spans a thousand years, from the fall of Rome through the Middle Ages in which players lead one of 13 civilizations into greatness. The game keeps the epic scope of Age of Empires' game play while evolving the combat and economic features. [Microsoft]\n\n92\n\nMetascore\n\n10.
