        "text": "Steam Nintendo Switch\n\nYou arrive at your family’s new house following a trip overseas. No one is home. A note from your little sister on the door begs you not to look for her. Where is everyone? What happened here? That’s the premise of Gone Home, the spectacular debut game from the Fullbright Company. No guns or swords, no puzzles or quests, no henchmen or monsters—just you and a house and the story told by what you find inside.\n\nOriginal platforms: Windows, OS X, Linux\n\nSteam\n\nThe Shenmue series transformed adventure games into an open-world 3D experience with a cinematic, story-driven game. Shenmue II picks up after the events of the first game, as Ryo Hazuki continues the search for his father’s murderer. Gameplay involves a combination of city-exploration, detective-style investigation, interrogation, and combat—a mixture of real-time action and quick-time-events.\n\nRead This Next: China Swears It Isn’t Building a Time Machine\n\nThe second installment of the series offered a larger world to explore: the vibrant city of Hong Kong as opposed to the small Japanese town of the first game.\n\nOriginal platform: Sega Dreamcast\n\nThe factor that set Fire Emblem: Awakening apart from its predecessors is the inclusion of a robust relationship system. The more your characters fight alongside each other in battle, the closer they become. If they spend enough time together, some will even get married and have kids, passing along stat bonuses and movesets.\n\nThe super-charging of your troops with an army of beefed-up youngsters is nice, but the real show-stealer is the extensive dialog interactions that come from your characters’ burgeoning relationships. It’s all the charm of a dating sim, but less “buying flowers and trips to the mall,” and more “the family that slays together, stays together.”\n\nOh, and the game is also an entertaining turn-based tactical RPG.\n\nOriginal platform: Nintendo 3DS\n\nSilent Hill 2 succeeds in creating an atmosphere of pure terror by focusing more on the psychological and thematic elements of horror rather than simply battling against big scary monsters.\n\nWe've Got You Covered: Seven Best Game Consoles for Every Type of Gamer\n\nYou play as James Sutherland, a man searching for his deceased wife in the fog- and monster-riddled town of Silent Hill. His quest is a journey through both the town and his own psyche, where he faces taboo topics such as domestic abuse, rape, and incest.\n\nOriginal platform: PlayStation 2\n\nSteam\n\nGames like this just don’t come around very often anymore. Back in the CD-ROM days when LucasArts ruled, DOTT was the time-traveling puzzle game that far surpassed its predecessor Maniac Mansion.\n\nGuide Hoagie, Laverne, and Bernard on their journey to stop the purple tentacle from taking over the world. The puzzles range from getting Betsy Ross to design a new flag to dressing up a mummy to win a beauty contest. It’s still just as fun to play more than 25 years later.\n\nOriginal platform: MS-DOS\n\nSteam\n\nIn the late ’70s and early '80s, while the golden age of arcades made its way into shopping malls and bowling alleys, a different kind of game began to thrive at home. Text adventures offered worlds of imaginative depth, whether through an interactive fantasy novel or an electronic game of Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nZork was one of the first of these games, but it differentiated itself by its depth of both story and design. The game’s text parser was more sophisticated than its predecessors, able to understand short but more complex strings of commands as opposed to basic noun-verb statements. This made the game more engaging from both a narrative and gameplay perspective, giving us the first glimpse at what would be possible in the fantasy RPGs of the future.\n\nOriginal platform: PDP-10\n\nThere’s a moment in the first level of Star Fox 64 where, if you fly through a series of seemingly innocuous arches, your wingman Falco tells you to follow him. He leads you through a waterfall and into an alternate end of the level, unlocking a whole new path of locations to visit. You could have beaten the game via the basic path countless times without ever knowing these places existed.\n\nI love that moment.\n\nOriginal platform: Nintendo 64\n\nNintendo Switch Nintendo 3DS NES\n\nCritics loved the original Mega Man, but nobody bought it. Lucky for us, Capcom decided to move forward with a sequel, and Mega Man 2 was a smash. The game sold more than 1.5 million copies and launched the franchise into the gaming stratosphere. The second game is played like the first, as you control the eponymous Blue Bomber through a series of robot-ridden levels, defeating them to earn their abilities. But Mega Man 2 brought a series of upgrades, not the least of which was making the game less crushingly difficult.\n\nOriginal platform: Famicom, NES\n\nPC Mac\n\nDungeon Master pioneered and popularized many elements that would become staples of the role-playing game genre. Those include real-time gameplay, an immersive 3D world, character inventory, skills that improved through use rather than by spending skill points, and more. Individually, these features had appeared in earlier games. But Dungeon Master’s packing of them into a cohesive, enjoyable package in the model that games since then have emulated.\n\nOriginal platform: Atari ST\n\nSteam\n\nA sequel to the community-created mod Defense of the Ancients for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Dota 2 became a phenomenon itself, spawning one of the biggest e-sports communities in the world.\n\nMore Here: The 30 Best Multiplayer Games\n\nWith incredible artistic design, Valve perfected the massive online battle arena (MOBA) genre, and unsurprisingly, it’s not the last Valve game you’ll see on this list.\n\nOriginal platform: PC\n\nIt’s Goldeneye without the whole Bond tie-in. There’s a story mode here, but it’s really all about the multi-player option. Choose from a variety of characters and then battle your way through levels depicting several different time periods. There were so many gameplay modes aside from just your run-of-the-mill death match. Even Capture the Bag was a blast to play.\n\nOriginal platform: PlayStation 2\n\nSteam\n\nDead Space was a prime example of the cinematic storytelling experience that drove many of the best games in the 2000s. The game’s detailed setting was both atmospheric and terrifying, a perfect background to the survival-horror storyline of undead space monsters.\n\nYou Don't Say: We Already Know How to Build a Time Machine\n\nYou play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer who must survive when his mining ship is attacked by space-zombies known as Necromorphs. The game’s combat uses a system called “strategic dismemberment,” where Isaac must use his improvised arsenal to slice off the arms, legs, and other extremities of his alien assailants.\n\nOriginal platforms: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360\n\nNintendo Switch\n\nThis little indie took the gaming world by storm upon its release in 2017. The animation style echoes the work of studios like Disney and Fleischer from the 1930s. Players control the titular character making your way through boss fights with increasing difficulty. And it does get quite difficult as Cuphead and his brother Mugman fight their way to a confrontation with the devil himself.\n\nOriginal platforms: Microsoft Windows, Xbox One\n\nWith Gran Turismo 3, the now-venerated racing series made the jump from PlayStation to PS2, and with it made a giant leap in graphics and realism. While the game was perhaps a bit too realistic (and thus complicated) for the casual player, GT3’s track-day physics and driving mechanics made it a favorite of car fanatics and racing game fans alike.\n\nOriginal platform: PlayStation 2\n\nSteam\n\nWhere the third entry in the original Prince of Persia trilogy failed to successfully transfer the series from its 2D roots to a 3D setting, Sands of Time succeeded. A reboot of the classic franchise for the sixth generation of consoles, the game featured beautiful graphics and acrobatic 3D platforming and combat, all of which it combined with an innovative time-bending mechanic. The game was a hit, earning critical acclaim and spawning multiple sequels and a feature film adaptation.\n\nWe try to forget about that last bit, though...\n\nOriginal platforms: Windows, Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube\n\nNintendo Switch\n\nJust as many superheroes made their first appearance in non-eponymous comic books (Superman in Action Comics #1, Batman in Detective Comics #27), everyone’s favorite mustachioed plumber debuted in a game with neither “Super” nor “Mario” in the name.\n\nThis game was more than the Italian high-jumper’s first outing, though. Donkey Kong was an early example of the iconic platforming genre and one of the most popular arcade games of all time, helping Nintendo break into the American video game market it would dominate in the 80s.\n\nOriginal platform: Arcade\n\nNintendo Switch\n\nAn early standout of home console entertainment and one of the first sports video games, Punch Out was successful for targeting arcade-style fun rather than attempting to emulate the sport it’s based upon.\n\nIn fact, part of Punch Out’s brilliance is that it’s not really a sports game at all. It’s a puzzle game that has much more to do with pattern recognition than physical prowess. In a way, so is boxing.\n\nOriginal platforms: Arcade\n\nPop culture’s most famous plumber makes his Nintendo Switch debut with Odyssey and he has a new friend named Cappy. Together they travel the kingdoms, including stops in New Donk City and Crumbleden, on an adventure collecting power moons.\n\nCappy can be used by Mario as a weapon to capture special objects and to overcome environmental obstacles. He’s no Luigi or Toad, but a welcome addition to the family.\n\nOriginal platform: Nintendo Switch"
