        "text": "Kentaro Miura, who reached a worldwide readership for more than 30 years with his Japanese manga series, “Berserk,” which set the standard for artistic originality and narrative boldness in the fantasy media industry — in card games, comics, video games and animated series — died on May 6. He was 54.\n\nKate Jay, a spokeswoman for Dark Horse Comics, Mr. Miura’s English-language publisher, said the cause was acute aortic dissection, a tear in the aorta branching off from the heart. She did not say where he died.\n\nAccording to Dark Horse Comics, “Berserk” has sold about 50 million books worldwide and about 3 million in the United States. It originated in a Japanese magazine in 1989 and soon became a book series, in multivolume hardcover editions and single-volume paperbacks small enough to fit into a coat pocket.\n\nSince appearing in book form in the U.S. in 2003, “Berserk” has provided sophisticated fare to a generation of Americans who grew up devoted to other Japanese fantasy franchises, like the video game series Pokémon and the anime TV show “Dragon Ball Z.”\n\nThe series follows the exploits of Guts, also known as the Black Swordsman, a one-armed, one-eyed former mercenary who inhabits a world of grotesque monsters, roving militia groups and medieval weaponry. For much of the series Guts seeks a safe haven for his love interest, Casca, and falls in and out of an alliance with Griffith, a friend who matches Guts’s own fighting prowess.\n\nMr. Miura (pronounced mee-oo-ra) was an “artist’s artist,” said Dave Rapoza, an illustrator who has designed covers of Marvel comics and cards for the card game Magic: the Gathering. In most manga, he said, the drawing is “cartoony and simplified.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
