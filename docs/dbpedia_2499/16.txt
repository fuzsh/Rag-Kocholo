Morte was the first thing The Nameless One saw when he awoke. Morte is a flying, and very chatty skull. He is also somewhat infatuated with all of the girls in town, or in fact anywhere ! Morte quickly became an entertaining companion to TNO, and also proved useful in a fight, especially where there was junk to be bitten !! Morte particularly delights in verbal fencing with an aggressive Tiefling residing in The Hive, Annah.
