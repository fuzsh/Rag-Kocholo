        "text": "The best iPads are undoubtedly among the best tablets money can buy, but with so many models to choose from in 2024, it can be hard to know where to start if you're looking to invest in an Apple slate.\n\nThe iPad Pro 13 (2024) currently reigns supreme as the biggest and best iPad of them all, but that's not to say it's the perfect choice for everyone. The super lightweight iPad Air 13 (2024), for instance, is a better buy for college students, while more casual tablet users will find that the (relatively) affordable iPad 10.2 (2021) – aka the best cheap tablet – remains a great all-round device in 2024.\n\nWhatever your requirements, we've tested every iPad model out there, and every option included in the below list is accompanied by a full review, so you can rest assured that our recommendations are based on real-world judgments.\n\nTo purchase any older-generation models featured below, you may have to visit third-party retailers rather Apple directly, but we've also provided links to fully stocked retailers under each entry. Once you're set on a model, head over to our breakdown of the best iPad accessories and cases, or best iPad Pro cases. And for the latest iPad discounts, check out our best iPad deals page.\n\nQuick list\n\nThe best iPad in 2024\n\nBelow, you'll find full write-ups for each of the best iPads in our list. We've tested each model extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\n\nThe best iPad for most people\n\nThe basic iPad 10.9 (2022) isn't the best, most powerful tablet around, but we found that it can handle just about everything that iPads do well, at a much lower price than its Pro-level counterparts. In other words, it's the best iPad for most people.\n\nWith the iPad 10.9 (2022), Apple has successfully migrated the base iPad from its classic, first-gen Air looks to an iPad Pro-influenced design, and the result is a high-quality, versatile tablet that will satisfy the broadest set of users, from fun-lovers and content-consumers to those looking to get some work done (the separately-sold keyboard cover is a must-purchase for the latter).\n\nSure, we found the lack of Apple Pencil 2 support disappointing, and Apple's upcoming suite of Apple Intelligence features won't be compatible with this particular model (they're being saved for M1, M1, M2, M4-running devices), but the iPad 10.9 more than earns its keep. It's available in some vibrant color options, too, including a snazzy pink and bright yellow.\n\nRead our full iPad 10.9 (2022) review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best premium iPad\n\nThe iPad Pro 13 (2024) is unquestionably the most impressive Apple tablet of the lot. If the main selling point of any iPad is its big screen, then the supersized iPad Pro is not only the biggest iPad to date (well, alongside the new iPad Air), but it's also the most advanced, using tandem OLED technology on an Apple XDR-branded display.\n\nThe latest iPad Pro comes equipped with an Apple M4 chip, meaning it's just as powerful as the very best MacBooks. This new model boasts 20% better thermal performance than the previous iPad Pro, too, and that improvement was tangible during our testing of the device (it never once got overly hot). The iPad Pro 13 (2024) also offers 50% faster CPU performance compared to the M2 chip.\n\nIn other words, the iPad Pro 13 (2024) – which also comes in a more compact, 11-inch variation – is by far the most powerful tablet ever made, and it's one of the few iPad models that'll support Apple's upcoming suite of Apple Intelligence features, which are due to launch later this year.\n\nFor the creatives out there, the latest iPad Pro supports the impressive new Apple Pencil Pro stylus, as well as the redesigned Magic Keyboard, making it the best iPad for drawing and productivity.\n\nOn the cameras front, the iPad Pro's 12MP rear snapper is definitely capable, though you'll need to turn to your phone (or proper camera) for any ultra-wide and telephoto shots.\n\nOf course, this is an incredibly expensive tablet, and its four-figure price tag puts it in reserve for serious professionals who need all of that aforementioned power. If you just want to watch movies and video chat with friends, then the iPad Pro 13 (2024) is serious overkill. However, if you need the best of the best, then this is the tablet to buy.\n\nRead our full iPad Pro 13 (2024) review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best budget iPad\n\nAlthough no longer on sale at Apple directly, the iPad 10.2 (2021) is still available at almost all major third-party retailers, making it arguably the best-value iPad right now.\n\nThis tablet isn't a huge upgrade on the previous model, but we found that the 12MP ultra-wide selfie camera makes it great for video calls, while the True Tone display makes it more pleasant to use in a variety of environments, with the screen automatically adjusting based on the ambient light. This, especially, makes the iPad 10.2 (2021) a joy to use outdoors.\n\nFrom testing all the iPads on this list, we found that the 10.2 provides the best value-for-money proposition. Sure, it's not as good for sketching or audio as the iPad Air, and it can't tackle the same high-performance tasks as the Pro, but it's also a lot cheaper than both of those devices.\n\nAnd that's all relative, too. Compared to lots of non-iPad alternatives you might be considering, we found that the iPad 10.2 feels smooth to use and has enough power for most tasks. So, unless you're going to need all the bells and whistles of the Air or Pro, this is a great choice.\n\nRead our full iPad 10.2 (2021) review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best iPad for students\n\nIf you're a college student who's looking for a lightweight iPad at a reasonable price, then the 10.9-inch iPad Air (2022) remains an excellent choice. However, if you can afford to stretch your budget a little further, then Apple's newest iPad Air offers comparable portability alongside vastly superior power credentials, making it the very best iPad for students in 2024.\n\nAvailable in two sizes, 11 inches and 13 inches, the iPad Air (2024) comes equipped with an M2 chipset (aka the same chipset you'll find powering many of the best MacBooks), which makes it 50% faster than its M1-equipped predecessor, and three times faster than the A14 Bionic-equipped iPad Air (2021). Like recent iPad Pro models, the iPad Air (2024) will also support Apple's upcoming Apple Intelligence features, which are set to launch later this year.\n\nOther key upgrades for the iPad Air (2024) include a landscape-oriented front-facing camera, landscape stereo speakers with spatial audio, and up to 1TB of internal storage, where previous models were capped at a measly 64GB.\n\nThe iPad Air (2024) isn't exactly cheap, but at $599 / £599 / AU$999 for the 11-inch model and $799 / £799 / AU$1,299 for the 13-inch model, it's significantly more affordable than any iPad Pro on the market, and a fantastic option for students and professionals alike. For us, it's indisputably the best iPad for college.\n\nRead our full iPad Air 13 (2024) review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best iPad for kids\n\nThe iPad mini (2021) is arguably a more niche offering than Apple's other tablets, but it remains a great choice for those who prefer its dinky size, or indeed for children whose hands are, naturally, smaller than most.\n\nOn paper, the iPad mini is a smaller, lightweight alternative to the other slates, so if you want a device that you can easily slip into your bag (or your kid's bag), then this could be the iPad to choose. We found it reasonably powerful, and really liked its modern design and easy portability, too.\n\nHowever, at a higher price than the entry-level iPad, and having underwhelmed us in several departments (like battery life and accessory compatibility), this isn't the slate to consider first if you're planning on using your iPad for productivity. That said, as a casual companion for you or your child, it's definitely worth a look.\n\nRead our full iPad mini (2021) review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the best iPad in 2024?\n\nObjectively speaking, the best iPad in 2024 is the iPad Pro 13 (2024), but it's definitely not the best iPad for most people. The iPad 10.9 (2022), for instance, is cheaper and more portable, making it an excellent choice for all but the most well-heeled creatives, while the iPad Air 13 (2024) will likely suit the needs of students better than other models.\n\nHow to choose the best iPad for you\n\nWhen thinking about buying an iPad, first consider your needs – do you need a big screen and lots of power for productivity tasks? If so, an iPad Pro could be a good fit. Something portable? Take a look at the iPad mini range. A basic slate? The iPad 10.2 (2021) is the top choice there.\n\nFor college students, the iPad Air range remains the best pick. These tablets strike a balance between price and performance, and offer everything you need to work and study. Depending on your course and budget, you might want to consider the newer, more powerful models, or an older iPad Air that's available at a discount. There might be a few exceptions – some courses might require apps that will run best on an iPad Pro, for instance. And certain courses won't require much word processing at all, in which case the entry-level model will do.\n\nFor creatives, it's worth noting that all iPads are compatible with the Apple Pencil, but there are actually two different versions of the stylus.\n\nThe original – available for entry-level and older iPads – gives you basic functionality, but it's quite a pain to charge. The second-gen version charges wirelessly and gives you control over what you write with improved pressure sensitivity. People who need to draw, write notes or sketch might prefer a tablet that works with the Apple Pencil 2.\n\nDepending on your creative profession, you might also need lots of processing power, in which case an iPad Pro will be great for you. If not, a lightweight option will let you go around coffee shops or parks to work.\n\nHow we test\n\nEvery iPad on this list was subjected to a full TechRadar review, and therefore our entire testing process. For starters, we use each tablet as our own for one week or more; we sign into our personal accounts, and begin using the iPad for social media, entertainment, photography and other normal tasks.\n\nWe do this so we can emulate how you'll use the device if you buy it. It helps us understand all the quirks of an iPad that you don't notice if you just leave the device in a lab and test it.\n\nOf course, we do some lab tests, too. We run benchmark tests to work out how powerful an iPad is, as well as battery life and charging speed tests to determine which iPads are suitable for what use cases. In our iPad reviews, the main areas of focus are design, display, cameras, performance, software and battery life, though of course price is also important for our final judgment.\n\nReady to buy an iPad?\n\nYou're at the end of our best iPad guide, but that doesn't mean we can't help you further. If you've decided on a model and are ready to commit to buying it, head over to our dedicated iPad deals page for the latest and greatest iPad offers."
