Luckily, on top of the tools Apple provides to ease the strain on your eyes, a couple of other tricks can come in handy for the best reading experience -- whether that's in a bright office setting or at night in bed.\n\nAdjust Font, Colors and Brightness in E-Reading Apps\n\nApple's own iBooks app comes with built-in options for improving the visuals when reading. In any open book, then tap the Fonts icon (resembling a small and a large \"A\") to view your options. Drag the brightness slider to your desired comfort level, tap the small or large letters within the menu to increase or decrease font size, or choose between white, sepia, and night themes for reading. The night theme is especially helpful when reading in a dark setting. From this menu, you can also change the font if that helps. In addition, third-party apps like Amazon's Kindle app sport similar options tailored to individual reading preferences on the iPad.\n\nAdjust iOS Settings\n\nIf you are using an iPad app to read that has limited or no options for reducing eye strain from the bright display, there's a few handy fixes for that, too. Tap the \"Settings\" app on your iPad, then tap \"General,\" and choose \"Accessibility.\" Here you'll see an array of options from Bold Text, Increase Contrast, Larger Type and Invert Colors. The first three are self-explanatory and can certainly help improve legibility when enabled. The Invert Colors option is great if you're reading at night, but would prefer white-on-black text which may be easier on the eyes. Note that inverting the colors on your iPad changes all colors, so it won't apply to just text.\n\nReferences\n\nWriter Bio\n\nGeorge Tinari has been writing about technology for more than five years on websites such as IntoMobile, Neowin, TUAW and more.
