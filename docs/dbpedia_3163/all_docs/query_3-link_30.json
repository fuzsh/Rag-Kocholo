        "text": "You can nominate up to five family members and share your Apple books with them. This means if someone wants to read one of your e-books/books/audiobooks, you can lend it to them through your Apple Books. However, for that to happen, you must list the person as your family in your Apple device settings.\n\nHow to Set Up and Share Books Through Apple Books Sharing?\n\nTo set up your Apple Books sharing, you must start by choosing an organizer first (that could be you). After that, follow the below steps:\n\nOn your Apple device, go to the Settings option.\n\nTap on your name. Select Family Sharing.\n\nConfirm your Apple ID. Add your family members.\n\nThe best thing about Apple book sharing is that it doesn’t matter which device your family members are using. As long as it’s an Apple device (like iPad, iPhone, or Mac), you/your family members will be able to access/download all the books seamlessly. Members are also allowed to access the library and download the books that have been purchased. You can also add third-party e-books to Apple Books on a Mac.\n\nChecking Apple Book’s Library\n\nTo access and read books from each other’s library, you must do the following:\n\nGo to Apple Books > Reading Now.\n\nLook for your profile icon and tap on the same.\n\nNavigate to the “Family Purchases” option. All your family members’ names will appear on the list. You can choose the member whose library you want to access.\n\nTap on their name and choose the category (books or audiobooks).\n\nAfter doing so, the books will be divided as per genre. If you want to check all their recent purchases, simply select the All Purchases/Recent Purchases option.\n\nNow, download the book you were looking for and read it.\n\nThe books that your family members have purchased can be easily identified by the thumbnail and the name. However, you won’t be able to get any blurb or reviews for the book.\n\nApple Book Diminishes the E-book Loopholes\n\nOne of the most common issues/complaints that most e-book readers have is related to a lack of traditionality. People still miss that book sharing and turning pages with friends. However, with the introduction of Apple Book’s sharing, such loopholes can be avoided."
