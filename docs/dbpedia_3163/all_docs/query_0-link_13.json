That warranty may differ from the warranty posted on this Site. If you purchased a Coretek product from the Coretek Online Shop, the following warranties and policies apply.\n\nHARDWARE\n\nI. Money-back Guarantee Policy\n\nReturns\n\nShould you not be completely satisfied with your online store purchase, you may return your purchase within 30 days from your invoice date.\n\nPlease note that in both instances, shipping costs are not refunded. To return your Coretek product, send an email to support@coretek.us (including your order number). Coretek will email you a Return Material Authorization (RMA) number. To receive a refund, the product must be returned to the Coretek warehouse within 14 calendar days of the issuance of the RMA. No returns will be accepted without a Return Authorization (RMA) Number. A 10% open box fee will be assessed on any opened package. In addition a restocking fee of 10% will be applied if the product is being retuned without valid reason as stated below.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ship your return prepaid and insured for the full purchase price by a carrier that offers package tracking, such as United States Postal Service registered mail, United Parcel Service (UPS), or Federal Express.\n\nThe Money-back Guarantee is also contingent upon the products being returned 100% complete and in like-new condition. All products must be packed in the original, unmarked packaging including any accessories, manual and documentation that was shipped with the product. Coretek may reject the return, or deduct costs associated with: missing parts, non-original packaging, abuse, misuse of the product or user negligence.\n\nExchanges\n\nIf you purchased the wrong product and would like to exchange it for another Coretek product, the same regulations as under “Returns” apply, except that we will only charge a 5% open box fee on any opened package. Price differences between the exchanged products will be assessed during the exchange and debited or credited accordingly.\n\nII. Dead On Arrival (DOA) Product\n\nA Coretek hardware product is considered DOA if it shows symptoms of hardware failure, preventing basic operability, upon its first use out of the box. If you believe that your product is DOA, please contact support@coretek.us within 10 calendar days of the invoice date.\n\nIf the product is deemed DOA by Coretek Technical Support within 10 calendar days of the invoice date, you are eligible to receive a replacement unit. If the product is deemed not DOA by Coretek Technical Support or if the product is deemed DOA more than 10 calendar days after the invoice date. Coretek’s limited product warranty will apply (see section below on Defective Items Limited Warranty).\n\nShipping will be arranged at Coretek’s expense for all products determined by the Coretek Technical Support Team to be DOA. Coretek reserves the right to test returned DOA product. If the condition of the product is misrepresented by the customer, Coretek may impose a $100 handling fee.\n\nIII. Defective Items Limited Warranty\n\nCoretek offers a 365 Day Hardware warranty on new and refurbished products purchased online. The warranties are in effect from the invoice date. Software of any kind delivered with or as part of a Coretek product is expressly provided “as is” unless specifically provided by a license accompanying the software. If any Coretek product subject to this Limited Warranty fails during this time for reasons that are covered by our Limited Warranty, Coretek, at its option, will:\n\nREPAIR the defect by means of hardware and/or software, using new or refurbished replacement parts; OR\n\nREPLACE the product with a product that is new or which has been manufactured from new or serviceable used parts and is the functional equivalent to the original product; OR\n\nREFUND the replacement value of the product.\n\nIf such product is defective, transportation charges for the return of the product to buyer within the USA will be paid by Coretek. For all other locations, the warranty excludes all costs of shipping, customs clearance and other related charges. Coretek will have a reasonable time to replace or make repairs to the product. In no event will Coretek be liable for any other costs associated with the replacement or repair of the product, including labor, installation or other costs incurred by buyer.\n\nTo request warranty service from Coretek, contact support@coretek.us during the coverage period or call us at 704-792-2221 (9am to 5pm EST), excluding holidays. Please provide: (1) your name, address, and telephone numbers; (2) model name and order number of the product; (3) an explanation of the problem.\n\nA replacement product or part assume the remaining warranty of the original.\n\nCoretek does not sell warranty extensions or accept old hardware products in exchange for new hardware products at reduced prices.\n\nTHIS LIMITED WARRANTY, AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT MAY EXIST UNDER STATE LAW, APPLY ONLY TO THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER OF THE CORETEK PRODUCT.\n\nWarranty Limitations and Exclusions\n\nThese warranties replace all other warranties, expressed or implied including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Coretek makes no expressed warranties beyond those stated here. Coretek disclaims all other warranties, expressed or implied including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties so this limitation may not apply. All expressed and implied warranties are limited in duration to the limited warranty period. No warranties apply after that period. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so this limitation may not apply to you.\n\nLimitations of Liability\n\nCoretek’s responsibility under this, or any other warranty, implied or expressed, is limited to repair, replacement or refund, as set forth above. These remedies are the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of warranty. Coretek is not responsible for direct, special, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from any breach of warranty under another legal theory including, but not limited to, lost profits, downtime, goodwill, damage to or replacement of equipment and property, and any costs of recovering, reprogramming, or reproducing any program or data stored in or used with a system containing this Coretek product. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.\n\nDispute Resolution\n\nThis limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Any and all disputes arising under or related to this limited warranty shall be adjudicated in the United States. The forum shall be Concord, North Carolina, USA, and the applicable law shall be that of the state of North Carolina, USA.\n\nSOFTWARE\n\nYour use of Coretek software is on the terms of the license in effect for the software at the time of purchase. You will be asked to agree to the terms of the applicable license at the time that you install the software. Please be aware, however, that your purchase is subject to the particular license that accompanies the software and you must agree to the terms and conditions of that license when you install the software. That license may differ from the licenses you can review here. Be certain to read the applicable license carefully before you install the software. You may return software after rejecting the licensing terms, provided the software is not installed on a computer."
