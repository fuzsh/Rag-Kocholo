If you don't like the rate at which the Kindle is reading, you can also change the reading speed from half-speed to double speed.\n\nThe Kindle app will automatically advance to the next page when Speak Screen is done on the current page, so you never need to change pages manually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated coverage from Tech Reference:\n\n5 ways to get free books on your Kindle, from classics to new releases\n\nHow to buy books on Kindle through your computer or mobile device\n\nHow to share your Kindle books in 2 different ways\n\nHow to return a Kindle book and receive a full refund in 2 steps\n\nHow to sign out of the Kindle app on your mobile device\n\nDave Johnson\n\nFreelance Writer\n\nDave Johnson is a technology journalist who writes about consumer tech and how the industry is transforming the speculative world of science fiction into modern-day real life.
