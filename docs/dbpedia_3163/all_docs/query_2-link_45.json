        "text": "Pat, thanks - that makes sense about the storage capacity. I will do that no matter what I get but I am leaning towards the mini. I may get an Apple (or generic) pencil with it.\n\nLola, I don't think I want the keyboard. It adds weight and I can use dictation well enough if I need anything written (or the pencil). Right now Google FI is not an option for me but I need to check into that. Thanks!\n\nDonald, I definitely think you and Pat are right about getting 256GB. And that's a good idea about reading guidebooks and making reservations on it. I do have a Kindle, which I always bring for reading fiction, but now that I think about it, if I get the Mini, I could leave the Kindle at home and just read everything on the iPad. Thanks!\n\nAmanda, thanks! Yes, I have the Kindle app on my phone and in the past I've used that to access my digital guidebooks, but I do think an iPad Mini will be better for that. And yes, I remember the days of traveling to Europe lugging 9 or 10 paperbacks along, then leaving them behind to lighten the load and sometimes having to buy more at very high prices. Digital is SO much better!\n\nBostonphil, they are great! I had a mini before but wound up trading it in for a larger one for my granddaughter, who needed it for school during Covid days.\n\nMardee:\n\nI bought the IPad Mini 6th Generation last summer.\n\nIt‚Äôs got 64gb capacity.\n\nMy old IPad 2 Mini was no longer able to get a lot of upgrades to apps I needed while travelling.\n\nI‚Äôm really glad I upgraded , as I had to stay longer in Italy after getting Covid on my trip last September.\n\nThis new one was invaluable in finding a hotel to stay in, looking up rebooking for flights, and being my entertainment while I was isolating.\n\nThe only thing is, it does not have a port for wired earbuds.\n\nI bought a small ten dollar adaptor doodad so that I can use my old earbuds, of which I seem to have a huge collection.\n\nI really like this new mini, and it‚Äôs easy to carry around.\n\nIt also has a pretty good camera.\n\nMardee,\n\nI know you said that you don‚Äôt like the keyboard but I am going to go opposite of what people have said so far. I use a iPad 12.9‚Äù Pro 5th gen. I also use the official Apple Keyboard folio for it and Apple trackpad. I love the combo and it‚Äôs not too heavy, thick or cumbersome for me. But for my uses when I travel it suits me. I don‚Äôt take it everywhere with me; i usually leave it at my hotel or the place I am staying. I use it to type emails, use a bigger screen when I need to really research and look at maps, and as a backup for as an entertainment system on the plane if it doesn‚Äôt work or doesn‚Äôt have anything I like. I also like a bigger screen when something goes wrong and have to really dig in and have to figure stuff out (hotels, flights, trains, etc). The physical keyboard also saves me screen space when I type so I can see more. And I used my iPad combo to type this post. It‚Äôs almost (keyword almost) as good as my M1 Air.\n\nDarren\n\nI also like to travel with a TABLET - in my case a Samsung Galaxy Tab A8. Works just as well as an iPad, storage can be expanded with an SD card for your guidebooks, plus lower cost, especially when on sale at Costco. A smaller Tab A7 is also available, comparable in size to the mini. Both feature a physical earphone jack.\n\nMay not be practical for those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem, but you won't be paying the Apple premium, and you may not need a fancy Retina display on a smaller screen. There are a lot of people out there who use Android phones, and I wanted to point out that they have an Android option, with the ability to easily sync across devices.\n\nI use an iPhone, but prefer Microsoft apps for email and file access with OneDrive.\n\nHi Mardee, I‚Äôm still using my first iPad, a 14.8 5th generation with 32 GB. Before my next trip, I am also ready to upgrade, and I would choose the higher level of capacity to be able to upload movies, etc. for the flights. I had a recent flight where the movies weren‚Äôt working on the plane, and I currently also have to manage the number of my videos so much.\n\nI always bring my iPad because I need the larger screen than my phone in the evenings to view & be able to eliminate which photos I don‚Äôt need to keep. And I need the larger screen if I‚Äôm reading much. When I‚Äôm traveling solo, I like to have a conversation in the evening with my husband on FaceTime to catch up on our days, so I use the iPad for those, too.\n\nI will be looking at your replies to see what everyone recommends!\n\nJust get the latest iPad Mini. You're already invested in the Apple ecosystem, so this is a no-brainer.\n\nI have been traveling with iPad Minis for years, and have become increasingly convinced it is the ideal travel device. It's lightweight and compact, but so much easier to use for most things than a phone (anything except for making voice calls); it's the perfect size.\n\nThe iPad Mini (6th generation) is the current version. It has been discounted recently (typical for models that have not been refreshed recently). The iPad Mini (6) was last released in September 2021, so it's not super-new. There's speculation (with Apple products, there's always speculation...) that a refresh for the iPad line will be coming maybe this year (possibly as soon as this spring), or maybe in 2024. No way to know. The current iPad Mini is a perfectly capable device for any reasonable thing you would ever want to use it for. I have one and love it. I always buy the biggest storage option available (and have never regretted that).\n\nNo need for a separate keyboard.\n\nDon't overthink this. It's an easy choice.\n\nS J, that's good to know! I'm not worried about the wired earbuds, since I have wireless Airbuds I can use. But there is an adaptor that converts the phone jack to a lightning connection, in case you're interested for next time.\n\nDB, it's not that I don't like the keyboard but more that I don't want the extra weight. With the iPad Pro and the keyboard, I'm calculating that the weight would be close to my Macbook. But thank you for the suggestion!\n\nmarkcw, I do like Androids and Google and would be willing to switch to a Samsung tablet, but all my friends and family have iPhones and it's just easier to stick with that for now, especially for FaceTime calling. In addition, I have been using Apple products since 1987 and it's hard to make that switch. But I will check it out - thank you!\n\nandi, Carol (now retired) and Continental, thanks! Good to know!\n\nJean, yes! The photos especially! I will definitely let you know what I decide on but I'm really leaning towards the Mini.\n\nDavid, thanks - I agree. From what I hear, the next gen of the iPad mini will not be here till late 2023, so I'm probably going with the most recent.\n\nsboh, thanks for the vote! Good info to know.\n\nperiscope, thanks, I'm sure I would, too, but I don't want to pay for cellular or 4 speakers. When I do listen to music or podcasts, I listen through my Airpods, so speakers would be wasted on me.\n\nRocket, thanks! I was in the Apple store today in Naples FL (I'm on vacation) checking out the minis and I did like them. But you make a very good point about the Kindle - I'm so used to reading on it that I think it would be hard on my eyes to read fiction on the Mini. But I can still use the Mini for the guidebooks on my Kindle in glorious color. :)\n\nWell, I'm late but I vote for iPad Mini. Years ago when my Kindle died I asked the forum if I should get another Kindle or go to the small tablet. They enabled me so I got the iPad Mini and I'm on my 2nd one. It's awesome.\n\nI read several hours a day on it and it doesn't bother me. You can adjust the color a bit but I've not used a paperwhite so not sure what the difference is. Downloading the Kindle app will load all your books on there but you'll have to re-download them the first time you open any of your older books.\n\nDefinitely go for highest storage. I got the 256GB and have only used a fraction. I don't download movies but have a bunch of yoga practices downloaded which does use some space.\n\nGet a nice case. I don't like the regular Apple cases...just kind of boring. I got one on Amazon that is VanGogh's Almond Blossoms...my favorite painting. It's so pretty!\n\nI always buy the biggest storage option available (and have never regretted that).\n\nSame as David, for sure. I've never bothered with the SIM card option, but the biggest storage available, now that is essential.\n\nY'all are making me realize that my iPad is a bit of a dinosaur . . .so maybe before too long it will be time to think about replacing it. But so far, she is still going strong for what I need her to do. Although she is probably heavier than what I could get now. Hmmmm, something to think about.\n\nI agree with Jean, I really prefer looking at my photos on my iPad as opposed to my phone (and uploading to IG from there or sharing with my parents, etc).\n\nI don't really read on there that much, except for I do download guidebooks.\n\n@Mardee‚Äîsounds like you found a good solution. Enjoy your trip!\n\nI have an iPhone and IPad Pro at home, and use them daily. For travel (especially overseas), I use a Kindle Fire tablet. They‚Äôre inexpensive, and I can watch movies, read, go online, send email, journal. Don‚Äôt know about photos, since I use iCloud for that. I like being able to use a beefy mini-sim card to upgrade the. storage, so I can store movie downloads. Prefer the size format (roughly 5x8‚Äù), which fits in any bag easily, including my TB Side Kick. If something happens to the tablet, I haven‚Äôt lost much investment. Think I paid $35 for a new Kindle during Amazon Prime days.\n\nIt‚Äôs not as convenient as the Apple ecosystem, but if the tablet is stolen, someone doesn‚Äôt have access to all my stuff either. I use Evernote for journaling and travel info, and I use Dropbox for documents and my writing projects. I carry a portable Bluetooth keyboard. I do take my IPhone.\n\nTexasTravelmom, I love those cases! I'm planning to get one - just need to pick one!\n\nPandaBear, I do like a larger screen but I figure that I can do without it while I'm traveling. At home I use my Macbook for most everything, especially with Google Docs and Sheets, and I can do most of the formatting and editing before I leave. In a perfect world, I would have a valet with me to carry all my luggage and electronic equipment! üòç\n\ntavapeak, thanks! I've had a small Kindle tablet in the past but find that I prefer the iPad. And yes, there is a risk but with my phone, I can erase the data from the iPad if something were to happen. You and I use some of the same apps - I love Evernote and use it for a lot of travel and also to keep track of my hundreds of sewing patterns and fabric. It's such a great tool! I also use Dropbox although I'm nearing the max for storage and I don't want to pay for it. I got it in the beginning when they used to give out free storage for certain tasks and so I have around 8 GB of storage, but I'm close to using that up so I have to be careful what I put in there now. I keep everything else in iCloud, which I do pay for (I have a family plan with my daughter and SIL)."
