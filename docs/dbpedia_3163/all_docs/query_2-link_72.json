EPUB also enables content with a fixed layout.\n\nThe EPUB file uses XHTML or DTBook (an XML standard proposed by DAISY Consortium) to display text and package the file content in ZIP. With higher compatibility than MOBI, EPUB offers a significant benefit for complicated content layouts.\n\nA good EPUB reader may make it easier for readers to read and increase reading enjoyment by helping them comprehend complex and varied texts. To choose the top EPUB readers for iPhone, we’ve tested dozens of EPUB readers.\n\nThis article is worth reading if you frequently read and work with EPUB documents.\n\nA Glance into Best EPUB Readers for iPhone and iPad\n\nEPUB Reader Pricing Key Features Overall Rating Marvin 3 Free (offers in-app purchases) Multi-themed UI\n\nExtensive import and export tools\n\nIntegrates with Goodreads\n\nEssentially free\n\n★★★★★ Apple Books Free Already available on iPad and iPhone\n\nSupports reading goals\n\nNo ads\n\n★★★★★ Google Play Books Free Read online or offline\n\nCompatible with all devices\n\nText-to-Speech\n\nCustomizable\n\n★★★★☆ Libby Free User-friendly\n\nCross-device syncing\n\nHelps to borrow books nearby\n\n★★☆☆☆\n\n1.
