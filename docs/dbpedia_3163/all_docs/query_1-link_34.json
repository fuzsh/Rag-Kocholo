I have a Kindle now and while I enjoy the paper like e-ink screen, it's just a little too slow for me, so I've been looking to get an iPad.\n\nTo those who read a lot, which one would you go with? While the smaller size on the Mini 6 is appealing, there seem to be some issues with it (UI scaling and screen jelly effect) but I don't know to what extent these issues may be overblown.\n\nThank you.\n\nI've been in the market for a new reading device for a while now.

But if you'll be reading material that is a mix of text and images and designed for a larger form-factor (like magazines), I'd recommend a larger iPad.\n\nOne thing that I've found to significantly improve the ereader experience on the Mini 5 and 9th gen, is the use of a matte screen protector. I know that most people don't like them, but they cut down on glare, and give a color e-ink-like experience. Added bonus, due to the nature of matte screen protectors, it reduces the appearance of the air gap of the non-laminated screen of the 9th gen iPad.\n\nJelly scrolling affects people quite differently. It runs the whole range of not seeing it, to it is very noticeable and very distracting. If you have the opportunity to examine a Mini 6 in person, I suggest doing that to see if it will be an issue for you.\n\nI have a Mini 5 and iPad 9th gen, but my comments apply to the Mini 6 and Air 4 as well.\n\nIf you will be using the iPad as an ereader of material that is exclusively text, then I recommend the Mini 6 (reading a wall of text on a larger iPad is a bit cumbersome).

I think you're right on the whole Mini for text and Air for magazines. The Mini is still quite a bit larger than the Kindle I have and is essentially the same size as a paperback. I did actually test both the Mini and Air out in store and did not notice any jelly effect while using the Mini. It was only after coming back from the store that I did some research and learnt about that 'problem' - I guess that's rather telling. Looks like I'll be pulling the trigger on the Mini 6.\n\nThank you. Very helpful. I think you're right on the whole Mini for text and Air for magazines.

I notice the jagged movement when using my partner‘s mini 6 in portrait mode; it’s kept me from updating my mini 5.\n\nJIC….\n\nIf you tried the mini 6 in landscape only, there seems to be no jelly scroll. I notice the jagged movement when using my partner‘s mini 6 in portrait mode; it’s kept me from updating my mini 5.\n\nI used it in portrait when I tested it and didn't notice that anything was off. Of course, now knowing there is an apparent problem if I use it again I might indeed notice. But the fact that I never noticed anything wrong when I first tested it means I won't get too worked up about it, even if I do notice it now..... if you catch my drift.\n\nI'm pretty picky about screen quality, and I do see the jelly scrolling on my mini 6, but I still LOVE the device and use it all the time for e-reading. It's exactly what I've always hoped Apple would do with this size iPad--small enough to be an e-reader, but with the Pencil compatibility and powerful internals it's powerful enough to do all the stuff I used to do with my iPad Pro. I love it as a companion to my 14\" MacBook Pro too--makes a great little second monitor using Universal Control.\n\nI have a Mini 5 and iPad 9th gen, but my comments apply to the Mini 6 and Air 4 as well.\n\nIf you will be using the iPad as an ereader of material that is exclusively text, then I recommend the Mini 6 (reading a wall of text on a larger iPad is a bit cumbersome).

I tried a different one today, and while it was noticeably only 60Hz, it felt far better than the previous device. I'm not sure what's going on there.\n\nI slept on the mini 6. I thought it was too small for the longest time, and I defaulted to the Goldilocks 11” version. However, I always found the 11” too unwieldy as a tablet, and I always was propping it up on a knee or something - too cramped as a laptop. Enter the iPad Mini. It’s just right for me. A little book-like tablet for most of what I use a computer for. I can use a mouse and keyboard for some light office work. Heavier tasks for the iMac. I really wish the iPhone came in this size or at least 7.5 inches maybe. But this device is more balanced than the brick that is the Max.\n\nIt’s perfect for texts, comics, magazines…I’m a convert for sure.\n\nMaybe there’ll be a foldable iPhone in the near future or some better foldable to replace the need for the mini one day; however I’m enjoying this little beast for almost everything right now."
