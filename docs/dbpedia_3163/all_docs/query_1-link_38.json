        "text": "If you or anyone you know is a bookworm, obviously getting a book as a present is always welcome. If the bookshelves at home are getting far too cluttered, we suggest looking into an e-book reader. Instead of simply adding another title from their favorite author to take up more space in the home, why not change the way they're reading books altogether? Giving an e-reader as a gift offers many desirable features to the reading experience: They're lightweight and easy to read, taking them on the go is a breeze, and having one of these devices lets you carry your entire collection of digital books with you wherever you go. The majority of e-readers on the market (like Amazon's slate of Kindle models) offers connectivity directly to that retailer's digital storefront where an array of releases can be viewed, sampled, bought and downloaded directly to the device. Nearly all digital book readers also work well with local libraries, which makes it super easy to check out and download library ebooks for a stated period of time. You also have the ability to upload files to the e-reader of your choosing, as long as these files aren't protected by Digital Rights Management software. That said, this legal restriction applies to almost all books you can purchase.\n\nE-readers can already be directly connected to a specific ebook ecosystem, so we suggest figuring out the devices' functionality before choosing which one to buy. There's a good chance the book fanatic you're shopping for would want to transfer the books they own onto a new e-reader, so figuring out what is a compatible option is a great idea. Not to mention, ebook retailers usually run unique proprietary systems. So, for example, buying a release through Barnes and Noble probably won't be readable on an Apple device -- that is, of course, if you don't already have B&N's Nook app installed.\n\nThe best-known digital book reader is Amazon's Kindle line, which uses E Ink displays to give a paperlike reading experience. There are a few different models in the Kindle lineup, though they all offer a front-light touchscreen, which eliminates the need for a book light while sparing your eyes the harsh backlight that comes from most LED tablet screens. Beyond Kindle's hardware, the Kindle app works on smartphones, iPads and other devices.\n\nBut Amazon isn't the only game in town. For instance, Rakuten's Kobo ebook readers work with most third-party vendors using the ePub book standard and are deeply integrated with the local libraries through the Overdrive platform. On your Kobo device, you can search your library and directly download books, something you need a third-party app to do with a Kindle.\n\nThen there are devices -- both E-Ink devices as well as traditional tablets -- that are compatible with apps from every e-reading platform. For example, both Apple and Android devices have access to free apps on their storefronts from Kindle, Kobo, Overdrive and more. You'll be able to read all your content on these apps, but might be missing out on any hardware dependent perks, like tapping on physical buttons to turn the page.\n\nWe've rounded up even more ebook readers here if you're looking for more inspiration, plus we've tested several big-screen multifunction E Ink devices that are more tablet-like and add stylus support.\n\nMy biggest overall shopping tip is that most Kindle devices are frequently on sale and sometimes offer stacking trade-in deals on top of that, so you can often expect to pay less than the official retail price."
