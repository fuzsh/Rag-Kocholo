        "text": "On Monday Apple released iOS 9.3.3, a small update with a great secret feature. Having had an extra long test period the software appeared to be a rock solid but (given Apple’s recent track record) my upgrade guide advised users hold off for now.\n\nAnd this is why, because it turns out iOS 9.3.3 does has problems after all...\n\nA growing number of iPhone and iPad users are reporting that iOS 9.3.3 breaks the iBooks app. Threads have appeared on iMore, Apple Support Communities (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and complaints to @AppleSupport on Twitter are growing:\n\nWhile some users are noticeably angry and frustrated:\n\nWhile Apple Support does not yet appear to have an answer. Speaking on tidbits one user comments: “Since updating iPad Pro to 9.3.3 IBooks no longer works and 3 hrs on line with Apple could not resolve the problem”.\n\nAs for who is being hit most, some are iPhone owners but the vast majority have iPads both old and new.\n\nGiven iOS 9.3.3 is expected to be the last version of iOS 9 and iPad 2 and iPad Mini owners won’t get iOS 10, there is a lot of concern they could be cut off unless Apple issues a last minute additional update (presumably iOS 9.3.4).\n\nThis isn’t the only issue with iOS 9.3.3, but it is the only one I’d categorise as a serious issue. The other surfaced on MacRumors’ popular forums when it was discovered that iOS 9.3.3 does not resolve an issue with dock flickering on the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6S Plus when the screen is rotated:\n\nDespite some very angry comments on the forum, I’d argue this isn’t a serious issue as the latest iPhones will receive future updates in the shape of iOS 10. No-one is potentially stranded as could happen with the iBooks bug.\n\nThe good news, at least, is iOS 9.3.3 does appear to be free of any device crippling bugs such as those found in iOS 9.3.2 which bricked thousands of iPads. It also secures devices against a potentially crippling Stagefright vulnerability so the hope is Apple will be able to fix iOS 9.3.3 from the server side allowing all users to upgrade without problems.\n\nAnd I’ll keep you updated should Apple issue a formal response to the iBooks issue. In the meantime, the arrival of the big iOS 10 upgrade and a potential third iPhone 7 model get ever closer.\n\n___\n\nFollow Gordon on Twitter, Facebook and Google+\n\nMore On Forbes\n\nApple iOS 9.3.3: Should You Upgrade?\n\nApple iOS 9.3.3 Has A Great Secret Feature\n\nApple iOS 10 Vs iOS 9: What's The Difference?\n\nApple Leak Reveals Massive New iPhone 7"
