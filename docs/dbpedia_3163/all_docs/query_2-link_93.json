        "text": "Recently, I received a Rocketbook Flip, a notebook sold by the company Rocketbook. Rocketbook, as some readers may know, is a company with a unique notebook product. After using it for a few days, I’m ready to share my first impressions with the Rocketbook and how it compares to my iPad for note-taking.\n\nHere’s what I’ve decided after using a Rocketbook over the past few days:\n\nThe Rocketbook\n\nA Rocketbook is essentially a “whiteboard notebook.” Users can scan a QR code on each page to save notes to whatever online service you want (like Google Drive, iCloud, email, etc). You can read more information on Rocketbook’s official website, but that’s a basic summary of what the Rocketbook does.\n\nTo use a Rocketbook, you need a Frixion pen and a microfiber cloth. To write, you use the pen as a standard pen. The only difference is that you need to wait 15 seconds before you closer your notebook or move your fingers over the text — otherwise, the writing will get smudged.\n\nBut after that 15 second period, it’s nearly impossible to smudge the paper. To erase writing, simply add a little bit of water to the microfiber cloth and wipe with the wet side, after which you wipe the page again with the dry side of the cloth.\n\nWays It’s Better Than An iPad\n\nNow that I’ve been able to give a basic idea about what the Rocketbook is, let’s talk about how it compares to the iPad. First let’s start off with ways in which the Rocketbook is better.\n\nThe Feeling\n\nFor some people, the feeling of writing with an actual pen can be a big deal. Personally, I don’t mind too much, but I do prefer the feeling of a pen over the feeling of an Apple Pencil.\n\nA thing to note is that the paper on the Rocketbook feels different compared to standard paper, since the Rocketbook’s paper needs to be waterproof while erasing handwriting.\n\nLack of Technology\n\nAnother benefit is that with the Rocketbook, you aren’t on technology. This is a little tricky to explain, so I’ll try to use an example.\n\nIn my AP Chemistry class, no phones are allowed whatsoever (except for taking a picture if necessary). While I haven’t tried, I doubt that I would be able to bring out my iPad. And while other teachers do allow me to use technology, I’m sure that at least a couple think that I’m not focusing on my work.\n\nBut with the Rocketbook, this issue is solved. As a standard-looking notebook, most teachers, if not all teachers, would not care about having a Rocketbook out during class.\n\nThis issue is important to me because of debate. With in-person debate tournaments, I need to get prepared to use an actual notebook/legal pad rather than my iPad while speaking. The Rocketbook gives a middle ground option, making it especially great for me.\n\nDistraction-Free\n\nSimilarly, with a Rocketbook, I’m forced to focus on notetaking and paying attention. With my iPad, I can check my email, the latest sports scores, and stock prices in seconds. While this is useful when I’m at home, it can be tough to focus with at school.\n\nI noticed this issue when I was doing work with my Rocketbook. I was less distracted when I used my Rocketbook compared to using my iPad, and I was more productive as a result.\n\nWays The iPad Is Better\n\nBut while the Rocketbook is great, there are some areas where the iPad wins.\n\nErasing\n\nFor instance, the iPad’s ability to quickly erase writing in seconds makes it much easier to erase with. On the other hand, with the Rocketbook, I need to carry a microfiber cloth at all times if I plan to use it. Additionally, I have to ensure that I have access to some source of water at all times.\n\nThis shouldn’t be a big factor, but it can get annoying at times.\n\nAvailability of Options\n\nAnother small issue is the lack of options with the Rocketbook. When purchased, you receive one pen. For most people (including me), this isn’t that big of a deal. But for people who are used to using 50 different colors in their notes, it can be a bit annoying to purchase (and store) each pen.\n\nThe Select Tool\n\nBut those are smaller benefits. The main benefit of the iPad, in my opinion, is the select tool. With the Rocketbook, I’m able to erase specific parts, but I can’t select and move pieces of handwriting. This can be especially annoying if I want to add in new content later on. If this need rises, I need to either erase everything and rewrite the content or connect my writing with arrows.\n\nSoftware Tools\n\nAnother benefit of the iPad is the software tools available. For instance, something like Nebo’s handwriting-to-text conversion feature could be helpful to some. Note: I’m not 100% sure about this, but I believe Rocketbook does have a similar handwriting-to-text conversion feature available when you scan pages of the Rocketbook.\n\nAdditionally, collaboration features are obviously unavailable with a Rocketbook. I don’t think this matters to most people, but sometimes it can be important for specific groups of people.\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, after considering the pros and cons, I’ve decided to use the Rocketbook for debate tournaments. The iPad still wins out in note-taking for classes, but the Rocketbook’s distraction-free style of writing and lack of technology makes it a better option for researching and preparing for debate tournaments.\n\nThanks!\n\nAdi"
