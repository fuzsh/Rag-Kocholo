This session will be about using your NLS Braille eReader to read BARD Mobile books. This is the first of a two-part program for August and September. The program will begin at 7 p.m. eastern time with a brief demonstration. The rest of the hour will be spent answering patron questions about any aspect of the Zoomax or HumanWare Braille eReaders. You may access the program by going to: https://loc.zoomgov.com/j/1608951162?pwd=cMmBfH2ZFcaXyRVAOQXnmt4RX9Ckvx.1\n\nPlease join us for a described audio presentation of A Haunting in Venice.
