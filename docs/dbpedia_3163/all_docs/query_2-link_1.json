        "text": "A huge thank you to my local Idaho library for coming to the Pride event I was working at. My issue with loans is that my ADHD makes it difficult for me to return books on time. Also, Iâm usually too exhausted during my time off to read anymore, so even if I do have a book in front of me I inevitably fall asleep. The library staff I met with told me I could get ebooks and audiobooks instead, since they are timed to automatically return themselves without me having to drive anywhere. I signed up for Libby that night and itâs made a huge difference! I had never tried audiobooks before, because Iâm picky about the narration and couldnât afford to pay for one only to dislike the voice. Now if I dislike the narration, itâs so easy to find the ebook version instead and pick a different audiobook from my reading list. Audiobooks have especially changed the game for me because I often live in remote areas with lots of drivingâitâs nice that I can get my reading in when I would otherwise be bored on a 1- to 10-hour drive through the desert. I also love that I can read an ebook on my phone during my lunch break instead of carrying extra books or a kindle to and from work. Plus, I can put multiple library cards from different cities on my account so I can usually find what Iâm looking for. I just canât praise Libby enough and I recommend it to anyone who will listen. Iâm so glad to be reading regularly again and that this app makes libraries so accessible.\n\nLibby is an essential app for book lovers, particularly during this time when many libraries are closed to visitors. I have been using the app for several years and always been happy with it. Recently, updates to the app have made it even betterâparticularly the option to have a hold delivered later (useful when multiple holds come available at the same time). The app is easy to use for reading and listening on the go, but I also love the ease of sending ebooks to my Kindle when I want a larger screen. (One downside is not being able to send audiobooks to Audible, which would enable whispersync between ebook and audiobook for readers who are doing both, but I suspect thatâs an issue with Amazonâs audiobook model rather than the library.) I like being able to track how long I will need to wait for a book (Libby often overestimates the wait time, which I appreciate because then Iâm pleasantly surprised when the book becomes available early). I appreciate being able to link multiple library cards in one app and switch between them easily.\n\nWhen it comes to potential negatives for some readers (such as long wait times for popular books), itâs important to remember that those issues are just part of being a library reader rather than buying all your booksânot an issue with the app itself. Go ahead and place the hold; high demand for a book often encourages public libraries to purchase additional copies (or digital licenses) for the book."
