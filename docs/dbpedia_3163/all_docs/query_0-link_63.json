        "text": "If you haven't updated to iOS or iPadOS 16 yet, or you just want to know what the new version introduces, you've come to the right place. These upgrades to Apple's mobile operating systems build on many of the new features introduced in iOS 15, like SharePlay and Focus, and add greater customization. Below, we dive into all the major capabilities now available on your iPhone and iPad, as well as how to download the updates. Be sure to read our MacOS Ventura feature roundup for all the new features available for Macs.\n\nUpdated March 2023: We’ve added new features in iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4 including new Emoji, improvements to the Home app, and Apple Pay Later.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nIs Your iPhone or iPad Compatible?\n\nWith iOS 16, Apple is ending software support for the following devices: the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone SE 2016, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus. Basically, if you have an iPhone 8 (2017) or newer (including the second- and third-gen iPhone SE), you can download and run iOS 16. That doesn’t mean every feature in the update will be available on your iPhone, though, as some features like Live Text work only with iPhones powered by an A12 Bionic chip or newer.\n\nIt’s a little more complicated for iPads since they don’t have sensible naming conventions. Here are the generations that will receive iPadOS 16. You can figure out which model you have by following the directions here.\n\niPad: Fifth-gen and up\n\niPad Mini: Fifth-gen and up\n\niPad Air: Third-gen and up\n\n9.7-inch and 10.5-inch iPad Pro\n\n11-inch iPad Pro: First-gen and up\n\n12.9-inch iPad Pro: First-gen and up\n\nHow to Install iOS 16\n\nBefore downloading iOS 16, we highly recommend backing up your iPhone and iPad. It’s easy if you do it via iCloud. Go to Settings, tap on your name at the top, and then select iCloud. From there, tap on iCloud Backup and toggle it on. Then, tap Back Up Now to trigger a new backup. You also have the option on the previous iCloud page to toggle off specific apps that you don't want to be included in the backup. If you don’t have enough iCloud storage or you just want another method, you can check out our How to Back Up Your iPhone or iPad guide for alternative options.\n\nOnce that’s done, you’re ready to install iOS 16 and iPadOS 16. Since this is a hefty update, you should plug your iPhone or iPad into a charger. Then, make sure your devices are connected to Wi-Fi. Next, head to Settings > General > Software Update. You should see an option to download the update. Tap on Download and Install. When the download is complete, you'll need to tap Install Now for the iPhone or iPad to begin updating. When your device restarts, the update is complete. The whole process can take some time, so run the update when you won't need to use your device.\n\nNew iOS 16 Version Updates\n\nYou'll find the top features in iOS and iPadOS 16 further below, but Apple has released smaller updates since the initial launch. These usually include bug fixes, security patches, and some new features that weren't included in the first version. To update your iPhone, go to Settings > General > Software Update and follow the instructions in the section above.\n\niOS 16.4: This update includes Apple Pay Later, new Emoji (all of which you can see here), web app push notifications via the Home Screen, crash detection optimizations for iPhone 14 and 14 Pro (specifically to keep it from triggering false alerts), voice isolation for cellular calls, and the ability to detect duplicate photos and videos in an iCloud Shared Photo Library. Apple also released a new Home app architecture with improvements to overall performance—including a fix for Matter-compatible thermostats that had previously been unresponsive when paired within the app.\n\niOS 16.3: This update includes Apple ID support for Physical Authentication Keys, support for the second-generation HomePod, new Emergency SOS controls, and new wallpapers in honor of Black History Month. Apple also issued a fix for the FreeForm app where drawing strokes were not appearing on shared boards.\n\nIf you're a fan of dictating your messages instead of typing (fewer “ducks,” am I right?) then you'll appreciate the improvements to dictation. Now, the keyboard will stay open during dictation so you can easily move between voice and touch. You can tap text to select it and replace it with your voice, and even send emojis without taking forever to find one.\n\nSafari Tab Groups and Passkeys\n\nYou can create tab groups in Safari already, such as a collection of tabs for work, but in iOS 16 you can share these groups with other people. You'll also be able to see what tabs people are viewing in real-time.\n\nEveryone wants to get rid of passwords, and Apple is one step closer with Passkeys. These are unique digital keys you can create via Touch ID or Face ID; there's no password to generate or type in, and Apple says they are virtually immune from being phished or leaked in a data breach. They sync across your Apple devices via iCloud Keychain and will work across apps and the web. Apple says it's working with the FIDO Alliance for a cross-platform solution for those who also use non-Apple devices. Read more about how Passkeys work.\n\nUpdates to Live Text Visual Look Up\n\nLive Text, the feature that lets you grab the text in any photo (before or after you snap it), now works with videos. Just pause any video and tap the text to copy it. There are a few new quick actions when you select particular kinds of text, such as converting currency and translating text.\n\nVisual Look Up was a different feature Apple introduced last year that offered up more information on the photo you were looking at, such as details about a landmark or similar web results. It now supports birds, insects, and statues, but you can also use it to grab the subject from a photo (much like using the Lasso tool in Photoshop) to paste anywhere, like in a conversation thread in Messages.\n\nMedication Tracking\n\nApple updated the Health app with a new Medication tab to help make it easier to track your medications. You can use it to add medications you need to take and set reminders (and receive them on the Apple Watch). You can manually type in these medications or just scan the label of the bottle with your phone's camera. The data includes Critical, Serious, or Moderate interactions with the pills. You're able to log when you've taken your medications, too. You can share this health data with family members.\n\nUse Your iPhone as a Webcam\n\nYou can use your iPhone as a MacBook webcam (the rear cameras, which are significantly better than the webcam cameras), and without needing to plug anything in—your Mac will automatically detect the rear camera and use it for your video calls. (Any MacBook that can run macOS Ventura will support this feature.) You can use features like Center Stage, which has the camera following you around a room, and Portrait Mode, which blurs the background to block out the mess behind you. There's even a Desk View mode that utilizes the ultrawide camera to show folks what's on your desk, though I don't want anyone seeing that. Belkin has a custom mount you can use to outfit your iPhone on top of the MacBook, and there's even a version for Macs.\n\nApple Maps Goes to Vegas\n\nApple has been slowly redesigning select cities in the US to show off richer data. The company has added Las Vegas, Miami, Seattle, Atlanta, and Chicago to the list, and more cities are supposed to arrive this year. The feature is also available in London and Canada. Other Maps updates include the ability to add up to 15 stops before your final destination, which is great for long-distance road trips (and you can set this up on a Mac and send it straight to your iPhone). If you're using public transit, you can now see fares, add transit cards, see low balances, and reload transit cards.\n\nLockdown Mode\n\nTo help protect your devices from “highly sophisticated cyberattacks,” Lockdown mode adds an extreme layer of additional protection to your iPhone and iPad. When enabled, features, apps, and websites will be limited for security purposes to help keep the malware or spyware from accessing and compromising specific data. You can learn more about Lockdown Mode and how to turn it on here.\n\nSafety Check\n\nThis new tool lets you quickly remove all access that you might have granted to anyone in your circles and includes an emergency reset that will sign you out of iCloud on all other devices, reset privacy permissions, and limit messaging to the device you have in your hand. It also shows you who has access to your devices and apps.\n\nFamily Sharing\n\nThere's now a simpler process for setting up devices for kids. Just bring your iPhone close to your iPad and choose your kids' account. It'll set it up with all the parental controls you configured before. You can even grant screen time extensions in the Messages app instead of having to go into the device's settings. There's also a Family Checklist tool for suggestions like turning on location sharing, and tweaking settings as your kids get older.\n\niCloud Shared Photo Library\n\nYou can now set up an iCloud Shared Photo Library, similar to how you can set up shared photo libraries in Google Photos. Just add up to five other people to a library and everyone can add and edit family photos. You can choose which photos to share, including whether to base them on a start date or via face detection. There's also a toggle in the Camera app that you can turn on to automatically send the photo you capture to the shared library. If you're all on vacation, these photos can even automatically show up in the shared library based on your proximity to family members.\n\nEmergency SOS Via Satellite\n\nThose with any model from the iPhone 14 lineup now have access to the new Emergency SOS via the Satellite feature. If you're ever in need of assistance while in a remote location with no cellular service, the iPhone will have the ability to connect to Globalstar satellites in orbit. That way, you can communicate with emergency responders or Apple's own Relay Center to get help.\n\nAdvanced Data Protection for iCloud\n\nApple has increased the number of iCloud data categories protected using end-to-end encryption. In addition to credit card and payment data, health data, and passwords, you'll now have to option to extend this protection to other sensitive information like Notes, Photos, and iCloud Backup. You can learn more about the new feature here.\n\nApple ID Support for Physical Authentication Keys\n\nIn addition to two-factor authentication codes (which are required for all new Apple IDs), you now have the option to use hardware keys as part of the process. Unlike codes, hardware tokens can't be compromised or shared as easily—adding an extra layer of security to your devices.\n\nSupport For HomePod (2nd Generation)\n\nWith the launch of a second-generation HomePod, iOS 16 unlocks a variety of new features for the new smart speaker—some of which are also available on the first-generation HomePod and HomePod Mini. On all HomePods, you can now use Find My to ask Siri the location of family and friends (if they've shared it with you) and set up recurring Home automation via Siri using your voice (like turning the AC on at a specific time during the day). When controlling devices that are in different rooms, you'll also hear a new Siri confirmation tone to confirm the command has gone through.\n\nOn both the HomePod (2nd generation) and HomePod Mini, you'll have access to the internal temperature humidity sensor. It can measure indoor environments, allowing you to set an automation such as turning the AC on when a room reaches a certain temperature. Both full-size HomePods also now come with auto-tuning optimization for spoken content like podcasts or audiobooks, which should allow for greater clarity.\n\nEmergency SOS Controls\n\nPrior to iOS 16.3, you could make an emergency call on your iPhone by holding the side button, one of the volume buttons, and using the Emergency SOS slider. In an effort to prevent people from accidentally triggering the feature, Apple has tweaked the controls slightly. You still have to hold down the side button and one of the volume buttons, but the call won't go through until the countdown ends and you physically let go of the buttons.\n\nPay It Later With Apple Pay\n\nServices that let you buy now but pay later have received some pushback from consumer analysts, but Apple is barreling ahead with its own take called Apple Pay Later. It allows you to split the cost of an Apple Pay purchase over four equal payments spread over six weeks with zero interest and no fees. You'll also have the option to apply for Apple Pay Later when you're checking out with Apple Pay (Apple says it will do a soft credit check), and you'll need to have it backed with a debit card. It's available everywhere Apple Pay is accepted online or in-app. You can also see order tracking directly in Apple Pay, though this is available only with participating merchants. And if you're a small business owner, you'll be able to accept Apple Pay payments via iPhone instead of having to use a separate terminal.\n\nThe feature is available with iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4, but in a limited state. Apple says “randomly selected users will be invited to get early access to a prerelease version of Apple Pay Later via Wallet and through their Apple ID email.\" The company plans to release it to all eligible users within the coming months.\n\nApple Wallet\n\nYou can already add your digital driver's license if you're in Maryland or Arizona, and Apple says support for 11 other states is on the way. You're able to use this ID for apps that require identification, and it only shows necessary information, such as the fact that you're over 21, instead of your full birth date. You can also share your home, hotel, office, and car keys through messaging apps like Messages, WhatsApp, and Mail. Apple says it's working on a standard to support sharing these keys with folks that don't have an iPhone.\n\nOther New Features\n\nThere are tons of other iOS 16 features. Here are a few more worth calling out:\n\nMail: You can now schedule emails, unsend emails (within a short period of time), get reminders to add an attachment if you mention the word, snooze emails, and get follow-up suggestions. Apple has overhauled the search function, too, so you should have an easier time finding old emails.\n\nHome: The Home app has been redesigned from the ground up. It also supports the Matter standard, and you can now see your entire home in a single feed.\n\nHandoff FaceTime Calls: When you're FaceTiming on your phone, bring the device close to your MacBook or iPad and the call will transfer to your large-screen device. This works with any MacBook that can run macOS Ventura.\n\nFitness: Yes, that's right. The Fitness app is finally available to anyone with an iPhone. No Apple Watch needed. You'll be able to close your rings without needing to wear your Apple Watch. There are also a bunch of new WatchOS features made for tracking runs.\n\nApple News: A new My Sports section lets you follow your favorite teams and players in one area of the News app. You can see scores, schedules, standings, and highlights. It's available in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, and you'll get premium coverage if you subscribe to Apple News+.\n\nCarPlay: Apple is working with carmakers on a redesigned CarPlay experience. That includes a customizable odometer, buttons to control every facet of the car, and a unified interface. The first cars to launch with this new experience will be announced late in 2023.\n\nAccessibility: A few top accessibility features include Door Detection, which lets people who are blind or have low vision use iPhones to see the area in front of them. Apple Watch Mirroring allows anyone with physical and motor disabilities to fully control the Apple Watch from the iPhone.\n\nQuick Notes: This iPad feature is now available on iPhones. You can create a note anywhere by accessing it from the Control Center.\n\nNintendo Controller Support: iOS 16 adds support for the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and Joy-Cons, so you can play games with them. iOS already supports PS5 and Xbox Series X controllers.\n\nNew Lock Screen Widgets: You can now add a sleep widget to see your most recent sleep metrics and a medications widget where you can view reminders to take specific medications and also see your schedule.\n\nApple Music Sing: If you have an Apple Music subscription, this new feature allows you to display the lyrics to any song and sing along—perfect for at-home karaoke nights.\n\nGame Center: With SharePlay support, you can now play multiplayer games with others while on a FaceTime call. There's also an activity widget that allows you to stay up to date with what your friends are playing via your Home Screen.\n\nNew Wallpaper: Apple added new Unity wallpaper options to celebrate Black history and culture in honor of Black History Month.\n\niPadOS 16\n\niPadOS shares a lot of DNA with iOS, so many of the iOS 16 features mentioned above will apply to iPadOS 16, too. Here are a few more tablet-specific features that come with the new OS.\n\nEasier Collaboration\n\nSharing projects can be a pain, what with adding email addresses and granting access. In iPadOS 16 (and iOS 16 and macOS Ventura), you can use the Share button in Files, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, Notes, Reminders, and Safari, and just share access via Messages to the relevant thread. Everyone will immediately get access and will be able to see updates and quickly start FaceTime calls with folks who are in a collaborative project.\n\nThe Weather App Arrives\n\nNo, it’s not 2010. The iPad has finally received a default weather app. Need I say more? Next, maybe Apple will finally bring the calculator app to the tablet.\n\nDesktop-Like Multitasking\n\nThe iPad is continuing to behave even more like a desktop computer. With Stage Manager, you can see apps and windows on the left side of the screen and switch through them with just a tap. Your apps will appear as floating windows, and you can resize them and have them overlap, much like on macOS. Unfortunately, Stage Manager only works on select iPad models.\n\nReference Mode\n\nApple’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro (from 2021) has a mini LED screen that can be utilized as a reference monitor. Basically, creators need color-accurate screens, and a new Reference Mode will let professionals use this iPad screen to ensure consistent image quality.\n\nFreeform\n\nApple recently debuted an all-new collaboration app called Freeform. Think of it as a virtual whiteboard where you can sketch, take notes, import photos and files, and more. You can also share the board with others who own Apple devices, allowing them to add their own content and make edits in real time within a Message thread or while on a FaceTime call. It's available on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. It's worth noting that if you've experienced an issue where drawing strokes (whether with your finger or an Apple Pencil) were not appearing on shared boards, Apple has fixed the issue with iPadOS 16.3.\n\nComing Soon\n\nAll of the aforementioned features are currently accessible in iOS and iPadOS 16, but there are still a few more that will be released with future updates—including a major one below. Apple hasn’t given us an exact date on when to expect it aside from later this year.\n\niMessage Contact Key Verification\n\nWith this feature, you'll have the option to verify who you're messaging—to avoid potentially communicating with someone who is impersonating a friend or family member. With Contact Key Verification, users will receive a Contact Verification Code that they can then cross-reference with the person they're texting to make sure the codes match.\n\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get a 1-Year Subscription to WIRED for $5 ($25 off).
