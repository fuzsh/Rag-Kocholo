(I recently had to reset my phone and reinstalled Stanza even though it is not in the AppStore any more) I did try Marvin as my reader but went back to Stanza\n\nMarvin used to have a direct interface to Calibre via a plugin see support forum which allowed direct control in calibre of what is on the iPhone.\n\nMarvin also can load books over OPDS as does Stanza\n\nIt is more configurable than Stanza and so can be made to work in a similar way - except the font setting is per book and not global. Also Marvin page refreshes can be seen, Stanza just does the refresh all at once"
