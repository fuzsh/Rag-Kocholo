        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nTablets are the perfect all-in-one mobile entertainment center, but not every busy bookworm wants to watch movies, play games, read email or take notes on their device. E-readers offer a distraction-free way to binge on books with Hollywood appeal, soak up page-turners that have been translated for the small screen or listen to audiobooks without having to lug around heavy tomes.\n\nRelated: The Best Tablets for Taking Notes at Every Budget\n\nThat’s why we’ve rounded up some of the best e-readers, including HD tablets that let avid readers soak up e-books anywhere. Our top picks include Amazon‘s best-selling Kindle e-readers and Fire tablets alongside worthwhile competitors from Kobo and Rakuten, plus stellar screens from Apple and Samsung for those who want a more versatile device. Many of these options are also compatible with audiobooks so you can listen to your favorite titles, too.\n\nAt a Glance: The Best E-Book Readers\n\nBEST E-READER OVERALL 2022 Amazon Kindle, $100\n\nBEST KINDLE ALTERNATIVE Rakuten Kobo Sage, $240 $270\n\nBEST PAPER-LIKE E-READER Kindle Paperwhite, $190\n\nBEST E-READER FOR KIDS 2022 Amazon Kindle Kids, $120\n\nBEST ANDROID TABLET FOR READING Samsung Galaxy Tab S9, $675 $800\n\nBEST IPAD FOR READING 2021 Apple iPad Mini, $380 $499\n\nBEST FIRE TABLET FOR READING 2023 Amazon Fire HD 10, $140\n\nBEST E-READER FOR TAKING NOTES Amazon Kindle Scribe, $340\n\nWhat to Consider When Buying the Right E-Reader\n\nWhether you’re a budding bookworm or a regular e-reading pro, there are a few things to consider if you’re buying or upgrading to a new reading tablet:\n\nStorage Today’s e-readers can hold thousands of e-books, PDFs and other content formats, and devices typically start with 8 GB of built-in storage. If you want to download and listen to audio books, consider 16 or 32 GB of space. Many e-readers also feature free cloud storage if you’re buying content from the manufacturer’s own online marketplace (say, Amazon, Barnes & Noble or Kobo).\n\nScreen E-reader screen sizes use the diagonal measurement of the display (not the height and width of the device itself), and they can range from six to upwards of 10 inches.\n\nPortability Some readers prefer a large screen, while others want a compact tablet that travels easily. In addition to considering the screen size, keep in mind the weight (most e-readers weigh five to seven ounces), the battery life and whether a travel cover is available.\n\nAdjustable lights Nighttime readers may prefer a screen that can be adjusted from bright white to amber, while daytime bookworms might want something that’s easy on the eyes in sunlight. Many e-readers have adjustable shade and brightness.\n\nErgonomic design Prefer to turn the page with the push of a button rather than swiping? Consider a screen with physical controls that make it easy to whiz through e-books.\n\nDevice switching Some e-readers let techies read seamlessly from one device to the next. Amazon’s Kindle, Barnes & Noble’s Nook and Kobo are among those that offer apps that automatically sync with your e-book library. That means you can start reading on your e-reader and pick up where you left off on your smartphone or another tablet (or vice versa) that supports the apps.\n\nSubscriptions and library access Most e-readers don’t require a subscription, and many public libraries also let you borrow e-books for free through OverDrive, Libby or another online service. Avid bookworms can also purchase and download new content via Amazon’s Kindle Unlimited ($10 and up monthly), Barnes & Noble’s Nook or Rakuten’s Kobo e-bookstores, to name a few. E-books can also be purchased individually for about $1 to $17 and up.\n\nWhere to Buy E-Books Online\n\nRestocking your digital bookshelf? You can buy e-books online from Amazon, Apple Books, Barnes & Noble, Ebooks.com Rakuten-owned Kobo eBookstore, Google Play and more.\n\nWhat Are the Best E-Book Readers?\n\nBelow, we’ve rounded up 9 of the best e-book readers and tablets for reading, including some that are also great for mobile gaming, taking notes and watching movies.\n\nBEST E-READER OVERALL\n\nThe best option for bookworms on a budget.\n\nThe 2022 Amazon Kindle is perfect for book lovers on a budget.

The 11th generation model features 16 GB storage (double its predecessor) that can hold more than a thousand Amazon Kids+ books, a larger six-inch 300ppi display and up to six weeks of battery life on a single charge.
