        "text": "You already love your tablet for its convenience and flexibility; it allows you to play games, browse the web, make video calls, and do many other things that make your personal life easier and more fun. But did you know that you can also use a tablet to enhance your work life?\n\nYou may not be ready to abandon your work laptop completely, but a tablet can be a powerful addition to a robust set of business tools. The key to making a tablet useful for business is to treat it like a business device. Make sure you have it set up with the right accessories and applications to improve your efficiency and workflows.\n\nWhat types of businesses can benefit from iPads?\n\nMost businesses can leverage the flexibility and affordability of a tablet. Here are a few types of businesses that often use tablets:\n\nRestaurants: Tablets enable customers to view the menu and order directly from the table, as well as give servers the information they need at the swipe of a fingertip. Managers, waitstaff and kitchen crew can also use tablets to keep orders on time, flag out-of-stock menu options, and more.\n\nRetail: Salespeople can check stock from the floor, customers can pay for their purchases, and employees can clock in and out. Tablets also offer unique cross-selling and upselling opportunities: By placing tablets throughout the store, you can make recommendations to shoppers based on their checkout carts.\n\nSales: Whatever you’re selling, a tablet can make a great sales assistant. By doing tasks such as keeping your calendar in order, storing important client details and settling payments, tablets can facilitate much of the sales process.\n\nServices: Tablets let service-based businesses and B2B businesses engage with customers in dynamic ways, even when every staff member is busy. Clients can sign in or sign up for an appointment time, browse a digital catalog or menu, book a service or meal, find answers to frequently asked questions, and view recommended services at tablet-powered self-service kiosks.\n\nAccessorize to improve tablet performance\n\nWhen combined with a keyboard or a stylus, your tablet goes from being a handy personal device to a useful tool for business. Tablets are portable, affordable and easy to use, and when paired with helpful accessories, a tablet can be as powerful as a standard laptop, without the bulk.\n\nKeyboard: The Apple Smart Keyboard Folio is a great option for an iPad Pro, and the Apple Magic Keyboard offers even more versatility. These keyboards double as covers to protect your iPad when it’s not in use and, when deployed, allow you to adjust your iPad to a display angle that best suits you. There are also plenty of keyboards available for other tablets. Logitech Keys to Go is a stand-alone iOS-compatible keyboard, and the Logitech Universal Folio is a great choice for 9- to 10-inch Apple, Android and Windows tablets and doubles as a cover.\n\nStylus: The Apple Pencil feels like using a regular pencil but lets you switch between tools with a double-tap; hover over a link or icon, and it responds. The Apple Pencil is a no-brainer if you plan to use your tablet for note-taking during meetings. You can also use it to jot down notes on PDFs, scribble reminders, draw charts and graphs, and more. There are two generations of the Apple Pencil, so make sure you choose the one that’s compatible with your iPad. There are also a wide variety of styluses available for other tablets, including the NTHJOYS Universal Fine Point Stylus, which offers dual tips, and the OASO Stylus Pencil, which is compatible with all touch screens.\n\nCase: If you don’t want a keyboard folio, you can choose from many other case options. The Apple Smart Folio offers protection for both the front and back of your iPad, making it an ideal accessory for traveling business owners. Otterbox makes several cases, including the Otterbox Defender Series Case, which offer superior protection for any tablet.

This added usability is ideal for mobile, agile small businesses, like food trucks.\n\nEssential apps for business tablets\n\nAlmost all the tools you need to run your business are available for the iPad. Here are some top apps that all business professionals should have:\n\nMicrosoft Office mobile apps: Thanks to Microsoft’s line of mobile Office apps, you can outfit your iPad with your favorite work tools, like Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

But here are some tips to keep in mind when you introduce tablets to the workplace:\n\nSet a clear policy. What types of content are allowed and accessible? Are tablets shared or assigned to individuals? Can employees add more apps? Can employees bring their own device to work? Make sure you set guidelines so employees understand what constitutes appropriate use.\n\nKeep it secure. Remind staff that tablets may contain sensitive business information. Employees should keep devices secure (e.g., don’t leave them on the front seat of their car), use strong passwords, and refrain from downloading unknown or suspect content.\n\nExpect different learning curves. Some employees will take to tablet use straight away and never look back. Others may resist the implementation or get overwhelmed with the new devices. Leverage tablet-proficient employees to help those who need it, and offer extra training sessions or practice until your staff members become familiar with the new devices.\n\nEncourage good hygiene. Especially for shared devices, offer wipes or sanitizers to minimize germ transfer.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nA British consumer watchdog found \"hazardous\" levels of bacteria on the average iPad. Ensuring your team practices proper hygiene and sanitizes equipment between uses is key to a great customer experience.\n\nTablets make a great addition to the team\n\niPads and other tablets can be powerful business tools that can offer a new, engaging way to interact with customers, facilitate processes for business professionals, and provide business owners with convenient access to staff, products, clients and more. Adding tablets to your business operations can be a great way to empower staff, customers and yourself to do more with ease.\n\nJessica Pooree contributed to the writing and research in this article."
