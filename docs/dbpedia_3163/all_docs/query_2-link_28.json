        "text": "Nothing beats picking up a paper book, feeling the pages and admiring the cover art. But avid readers know that e-books are way easier to travel with, ideal for those living in small spaces and a good way to keep all your highlighted passages in one place.\n\nThe good news is that if you already have an iPad your tablet computer makes a fantastic e-reader. The large screen of one of the best iPads provides an awesome way to read your favorite books, magazines, and other content, like comics and reports.\n\nApple has its own Books app, but there are plenty of other e-reader apps to choose from, and these are our top picks whether you're going to be using an old iPad or the latest Apple iPad Pro with M2 chip.\n\nOur top picks of the best e-reader apps for iPad\n\nKindle\n\nAlthough Amazon is now a huge online store that sells almost everything imaginable, back in its early days, it started as an online bookstore, and the Kindle app provides access to Amazon's massive catalog of books.\n\nKindle can do just about anything you want from an e-reader, including changing the font, background color, highlighting text, making annotations, and more. Plus, Kindle has a very robust library management system that makes it super easy to find pages in any book with only a couple of taps of the screen.\n\nIf you're new to e-reading, I highly suggest downloading Kindle and giving it a try. After prompting you to log in to your Amazon account, Kindle will ask you to select some genres of books you like to read and rate a handful of titles. Kindle uses this information to help you discover books you might like in the future, but it also downloads some samples for you to try. While these free samples are only part of a book, it gives you a chance to try the interface out for yourself to see if you like it.\n\nBluefire Reader\n\nIf you're looking for an e-reader app that can access your Adobe content, look no further than Bluefire Reader.\n\nOn top of Adobe DRM content, Bluefire Reader can handle EPUB and PDF files, allowing you to transfer your own files from other places and have them conveniently in one place. Plus, Bluefire allows users to easily bookmark locations, highlight text, make annotations, and even use night mode across all your iOS devices, so you'll be able to read how and when you want.\n\nScribd\n\nIf you're the type of person who likes an unlimited subscription service for your content and doesn't mind shelling out some cash every month, Scribd has been called the \"Netflix for books.\"\n\nMuch like its nickname would indicate, Scribd has a huge library of books, audiobooks, magazines, newspapers, and more that you can access for a monthly subscription fee, which varies in price depending on what tier you choose.\n\nThe app itself is extremely well organized and easy to navigate, plus all the typical functionality of great e-reader apps are included. You'll be able to annotate, highlight text, and use bookmarks whenever you please, all while being able to customize the look.\n\nGoogle Play Books\n\nIf you're locked into the Google ecosystem, you can still read all your favorite books on your iPad with Google Play Books.\n\nWith thousands of books, audiobooks, comic books, magazines, and other content to choose from, Google Play Books syncs across all your devices using your Google account. Perfect for people who choose the iPad as their preferred tablet while also carrying around an Android phone.\n\nLibby by OverDrive\n\nSome public libraries across the country already have a digital media lending system that doesn't cost you any extra money and the makers of OverDrive brings that media directly to your iPad.\n\nLibby by OverDrive allows you to borrow books, audiobooks, and other content from the digital collections of participating libraries, without having to leave the comfort of your home, office, cabin, or anywhere else you and your iPad find yourself.\n\nKobo Books\n\nKobo has been around for a long time and has a well-established library of books and audiobooks, all of which you can access through the Kobo Books app on your iPad.\n\nIt's a store and e-reader all in one where you can buy, download, and read all your books right from the app. It has a ton of different themes you can set your background to, from light and bright white tones to blacks and dark grays, meaning regardless of the lighting around you, you should be able to read comfortably. Plus, it even has a night mode to make it a bit easier on your iPad's battery.\n\nBookFusion\n\nSpecifically designed for the iPad (though you can get it for your iPhone, too), BookFusion has a library of over 2 million books to peruse for all your reading needs.\n\nBookFusion also has an incredible suite of customization settings that can allow you to adjust vertical/horizontal margins, line spacing, fonts, bold/italics, colors, and more, making it perfect to tailor to your preferred reading experience. It even has an integrated reader, meaning you can open and read all your EPUB and PDFs, which will help you with productivity as much as in your leisure time.\n\nThe best iPad for reading\n\nWe've raved about how great the iPad is as an e-reader, but if you're looking for the best iPad that seems especially tailored for being a portable book, we highly recommend the iPad mini 6.\n\nIt's the smallest iPad that Apple makes, which allows it to be ultra-portable. Plus, it's super powerful since it's packing the A15 Bionic chip, so when you're not reading you can game or work with no problem."
