        "text": "Whether you a bookworm or you want to start a reading habit, you need to have the right tools for the job.\n\nSure, nothing compares to the feel of a physical book. Whether it’s the texture, the smell, or how easy it is to use, a book beats digital devices in many different departments.\n\nHowever, reading digital books is also more convenient, and you can carry literally a hundred books with you without worrying about weight.\n\nWith that said, you need to have the right device. Nowadays, the best devices for reading are an iPad or an eReader, but which one is the best for you? Here’s everything you should consider before making a purchase.\n\neReader vs. iPad: Display Differences\n\nOne of the biggest differences between an iPad and an eReader is the display. Not only do most iPads feature a larger display, but it also has a higher quality compared to any eReader.\n\nMoreover, most eReaders only feature a black-and-white screen, so reading comic books is a different experience. On the other hand, if you read manga, you won’t notice a difference.\n\nStill, if you want to have a larger display filled with bright colors and amazing quality, the iPad is the best option for you.\n\nHowever, If you just plan on reading text, an eReader is a solid choice.\n\neReader vs. iPad: Which One Is More Comfortable?\n\nHaving a larger display might be better on paper, but the bigger the device, the harder it is to use, especially if you plan on reading for a long time or carrying it around with you.\n\nMost eReaders are light, small, and easy to hold, so they’re naturally more comfortable to use when reading.\n\nOn the other hand, unless you go for an iPad mini, you won’t be able to hold your iPad with one hand for very long, making it pretty uncomfortable to hold when reading and moving through your book.\n\neReader vs. iPad: Price\n\nWhen it comes to the price, eReaders are the clear winners. Let’s use Amazon’s Kindle as an example, as they’re among the most popular eReaders you can get today.\n\nThe cheapest Amazon eReader is the standard Kindle, which starts at $99.99, whereas the most expensive model is the Kindle Scribe, which starts at $339.99.\n\nOn the other hand, the cheapest current-generation iPad starts at $449, while the most expensive model, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, goes for $1,099.\n\nKeep in mind that these are two very different types of devices. If you only want something for reading, the base Kindle will give you plenty of bang for your buck, but you may not need to spend any money at all if you already own an iPad — even an older one will do.\n\neReader vs. iPad: Battery Life\n\nWhen it comes to battery life, the eReaders come out on top one more time, although, as we mentioned before, they’re very different devices from a full tablet.\n\nFor instance, all Amazon Kindle models last for days or weeks — even if you use them regularly.\n\nThe battery life you get on the iPad, on the other hand, will depend on your model. But even the most expensive iPad Pro will only last up to 10 hours, according to Apple. That’s nothing compared to the Kindle.\n\nGranted, the Amazon Kindles don’t have nearly as many features as an iPad, nor do they need to worry about a power-hungry high-resolution screen, which is the main reason why their battery lasts so long.\n\nStill, if you’re only looking for a device to read digital books with, most eReaders will be the best option in the battery life department. It’s the difference between charging every night and charging once a month.\n\neReader vs. iPad: Extra Features\n\nIf you want to be able to read your digital books and get some extra features as well, the iPad is the clear choice for you.\n\nNo matter which model you choose, an iPad will let you read books, listen to audiobooks, browse the web, play games, watch Netflix, and so on. The possibilities are endless; you can do pretty much anything you want.\n\neReaders, on the other hand, don’t come with as many features. For the most part, you’ll be able to read books, listen to audiobooks, use a dictionary, and buy more books. Some eReaders also come with a built-in browser, but it’s actually pretty limited. You’ll probably get annoyed pretty quickly trying to use it.\n\nIf you get a more expensive eReader like the Kindle Scribe, you’ll also be able to take notes with the stylus, but you can do the same on any iPad with just your finger.\n\nNeedless to say, if you’re looking for extra stuff to do with your device, the iPad is the way to go.\n\neReader vs. iPad: Focus\n\nIf you have a hard time focusing on your books and you end up reaching for your iPhone to check notifications, then the iPad is not for you.\n\nDepending on what you have installed on your iPad, you’ll get countless notifications throughout the day. Even while reading, you might get notifications of emails or messages that will distract you.\n\nSure, you can use a Focus mode, but just having access to any app with just a few taps makes it hard to stay focused.\n\nOn the other hand, using an eReader will be the closest thing you’ll have to an actual book. No distractions, notifications, or apps to keep you from reading. You’ll get access to your book library, and you’ll only be distracted by more books to read.\n\nIf focus is an important aspect of your reading, an eReader is the best option for you.\n\neReader vs. iPad: What You Read Is Also Important\n\nAs we mentioned, the different displays, eReaders, and iPads are important things to consider.\n\nIf you only read books with no pictures or manga, then you should choose an eReader. On the other hand, if you prefer books with pictures or enjoy reading digital comics, you should go for the iPad. You’ll get a better experience with the colors that you’ll be able to see.\n\nYour preferred eBook platform also factors in here. If you like to use Apple Books, then it’s an iPad (or iPhone) or nothing. On the other hand, Amazon has a Kindle app for many other platforms, letting you seamlessly move from a Kindle to your iPhone (and vice-versa).\n\neReader vs. iPad: Which One Should You Choose?\n\nWhen it comes to choosing one device over the other, there isn’t a straight answer. You’ll need to take into account what you want from your device and what you enjoy reading.\n\nIf you just want an affordable device that will let you focus on your books, and you can carry and hold them without worrying about the weight, then an eReader is perfect for you.\n\nYou can start reading for as low as $100, and you’ll be able to access your entire library and even store PDF files or free ebooks you find online.\n\nOn the other hand, if money isn’t an issue, or you just want a great screen to read comics and want to be able to use your device for other things like Netflix or social media, the iPad is the best option.\n\nEven though the iPad is more expensive, you’ll get more bang for your buck. You’ll be able to use your iPad to take notes, do your homework, and maybe even start replacing your laptop with your iPad. Not to mention that a bigger screen makes it easier to read any font size.\n\nWhichever option you choose, you’ll surely enjoy building a reading habit with any of these devices."
