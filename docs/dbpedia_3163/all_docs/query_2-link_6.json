        "text": "Download Kindle app for iOS\n\nOn your iPad or iPhone, go to the App Store. Use the search feature to find the Kindle app.\n\nTap “Get” button, and wait until the download is complete.\n\nRegister the Kindle app with your Amazon account\n\nImport only the books you want\n\nWhen you open the Kindle app, you’ll see two tabs at the bottom: “Cloud” and “Device.”\n\nCloud tab\n\nWhen you tap the Cloud button, you’ll see all the books that are stored in your Kindle cloud library.\n\nDevice tab\n\nYour Kindle app comes with just one document that is pre-downloaded. It’s a simple guide with a few tips to get you started.\n\nOnce you download any book from the Cloud tab, it will appear in the Device section. Every book available in the Device tab can be accessed offline, which means you open and read it even when your iPad is not connected to the internet.\n\nDownload free Kindle eBooks\n\nYou can find free eBooks in the Kindle Store, but there is no way to add them directly from within the Kindle for iOS app. Instead, you can explore Amazon website in a dedicated Amazon shopping app or a web browser like Safari or Chrome.\n\nFind the book file in a browser\n\nWhen you open the mobile version of Project Gutenberg on your iPhone or iPad, you can easily find the most popular titles. Pick up the one that you want to download and tap it.\n\nSelect the right format\n\nWhen you are on a page with book details and download options, it’s important to pick up the file format which is supported by Kindle e-readers and apps.\n\nOn Project Gutenberg, it’s simply named “Kindle.” On other sites, make sure to find formats called “mobi” or “prc.” You can also download the pdf file, but it’s not as flexible as mobi. For instance, you won’t be able to increase the font size, adjust margins, or turn on the night mode.\n\nProject Gutenberg gives the option to select the Kindle file with or without pictures\n\nOpen the file with the Kindle app for iOS\n\nWhen you tap the download link or button, the dialog window will appear asking you to decide what to do with the file. Tap “Open in Kindle” link\n\nThe eBook will open in the Kindle app, and you can start reading it instantly."
