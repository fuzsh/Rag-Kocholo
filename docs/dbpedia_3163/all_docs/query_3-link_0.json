OLD REVIEW: Came to the app store to find a new reader. Glad to see I'm not the only one who's having trouble with the new version- hopefully they'll revert it!! Here are some more suggestions: -the app deletes books off the device to save space. it's always done this but with the new version, it's not always able to re-download them- even if the epub is saved local on the files app! i've lost annotated copies. please fix this, and add a way to turn off the feature in the first place. i want all my books saved local. -every time you open the annotations list, it takes you back to the top. I'd like to be able to scroll through my annotations, click one and read it, and then open the list again and be where I left off so I don't have to scroll down and find it again. It's so annoying-i have hundreds of annotations in some books. the original version held your place in the list. Everything else I've seen described in other reviews. you dont even have to go through the trouble of fixing all this just take it back to the previous version pleaseeeeee please"
