        "text": "Apple’s iPad Pro (11-inch, M4) includes plenty of upgrades over the previous generation—not only to the tablet itself, but to its accessories as well. The iPad Pro has Apple’s new M4 chip, which is very competitive against the processing power of modern Windows laptops in our testing, as well as a vibrant OLED display.\n\nAs for the accessories, you can squeeze the new Pencil Pro to bring up a helpful tool palette, and the M4-compatible Magic Keyboard case offers nicer keys and a better trackpad, plus an aluminum top that makes it feel much sturdier and more comfortable to type on.\n\nApple has increased the price of the iPad Pro, however, and combined with all the accessories, a bundle for creative pros costs at least $1,400. If you are often comparing documents side-by-side, or if you plan to mainly use the tablet with the Magic Keyboard as a laptop replacement and want to multitask, the 13-inch iPad Pro might be a better choice than the 11-inch version. The larger iPad Pro and accessories start at $1,775, however, so it’s worth considering how much you need a touchscreen, and whether a MacBook might be a better—and cheaper—option.\n\nAll iPads work seamlessly with Macs and iPhones in an Apple-centric home or workplace, and iPadOS is easy to use and simple to update, back up, and restore. It has a huge library of touch-friendly tablet apps, including lots of options for drawing, writing, and editing photos, audio, and video. And the latest version of iPadOS handles keyboards and mice, external storage, file sharing, and web browsing better than previous versions did. But iPadOS and its apps are limiting if you do any kind of coding or web development.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra has a laptop-sized 14.6-inch display that’s equally great for watching a movie or multitasking during work. In our tests, the S9 Ultra’s processor was fast enough for any app we tried, and it didn’t slow down when working with and exporting 4K video. The S9 Ultra comes with the S Pen, a proprietary stylus that magnetically attaches to the back of the tablet to charge. Tablet apps for specific uses can be harder to find in the Android app store than they are for iPads. But the S9 Ultra is more than capable of handling office tasks, and it is compatible with most modern productivity software, including Slack and Microsoft Office.\n\nWith the Apple M2 iPad Air (11-inch), the latest Air, you can be just as productive as with the iPad Pro. It has fewer pro-level features, but you’d likely never notice what’s missing unless you were to compare the two side by side. The biggest difference lies in the display: The iPad Air has an LCD screen instead of the higher-end OLED panel on the iPad Pro. The iPad Air also has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor rather than the iPad Pro’s Face ID facial recognition. Otherwise, the two models have similar capabilities, and the M2 iPad Air supports the new Pencil Pro as well.\n\nApple also now makes a 13-inch version of the iPad Air, which when paired with the Pencil Pro could be a fantastic option if you want a larger digital canvas and are interested in saving hundreds of dollars versus purchasing the iPad Pro."
