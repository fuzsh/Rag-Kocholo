The pdf shows up fine and I can read it.\n\nHowever, as soon as I click the \"back\" button on the upper left corner of ibooks, in the \"Library/PDFs\" of ibooks, I see the book I just read appear for half a second, and then instantly disappear, and then it says\n\nNo PDFs. All the PDFs in your library will automatically be added to this collection.\n\nWhat's going on? How can I get my Library -> PDFs screen in ibooks to actually show the PDFs that I have been reading, instead of having them instantly disappear? Currently, in order to read the PDF again, I have to go to the Files app, and click \"open in ibooks\" every time.\n\nI'm using ibooks on ipad air 2, with the latest system upgrades as of late August 2020."
