We will supply all parts and components listed in the full ibook’s for sale here, minus the iBook G3 Clamshell that you will be sending to me. Since iBooks will arrive in pretty much any condition, I can’t guarantee there wont be some repairs or modifications required to work with it. I will do my best, but again, cannot guarantee perfection. I will also try to replace missing apple logos and CD drive covers if I have any made in-stock, all of those repairs and replacements are included if they are possible.\n\nThe iBook iPad Conversion is made up of several parts to note. The first, and biggest variable, is the iBook G3 itself. I start with using an existing iBook G3, that I disassemble all electronics, display, and top case so we're left with just the shell. From there, I install 3D printed parts for the frame, iPad tray holder, and keyboard top case, then assembled all the cabling, chargers, mounted ports, and corrected any issues that tend to occur with 20 year old plastic (like broken screw mounts, missing apple logos, missing CD/DVD covers, etc). The case currently ONLY fits the 2021 11\" iPad Pro (1st-4th Generation), and the 10.9\" iPad Air (4th-5th Generation). Features, Parts, and Components:\n\nBluetooth Keyboard with Trackpad\n\nApple Watch Charger\n\n2 USB-C charging ports (one for the iPad, and one for the internal Battery).\n\n5000mah battery pack to keep the Keyboard and Apple Watch Charger\n\nOn/Off switch\n\nLED Light/indicator behind the Apple Logo\n\nMagnetic mounts for your iPad\n\nCurrently sold as-is with no warranty or consistent support. I can try to answer questions and troubleshoot any issues, but I currently don't have the capacity to help with everyone's order. As of now, it's in a great, user friendly condition, but you may have to troubleshoot some problems as they arise. Please visit my TikTok Channel at https://www.tiktok.com/@skipperfilms for tours, tutorials, features, and updates!\n\nAdd To Cart\n\nTHIS SALE IS FOR THE SERVICE OF SENDING YOUR IBOOK IN, AND WE DO THE CONVERSION.
