        "text": "Recently rumors started floating around that Apple will announce two updates to its iPad line: a new iPad Mini and a regular 10” iPad. If true, that means the older models will work better with the latest Apple OS and could be a great way not only to catch up on work or entertainment, but also reading goals.\n\nAccording to CNET, \"new iPad model numbers have popped up in the EEC (Eurasian Economic Commission) database, including one that may be for an iPad Mini 5.\" Apple likes to announce new tablets and computers in the spring, so it should only be a few months to see what it actually has planned. Though not the optimal e-reader option, iPads are still one of the most handy devices for on-the-go users. What iPads lack in pocket size and e-ink screens they gain in the sheer number of apps available. Because most apps also work in tandem with apps from e-book companies, it’s totally possible to turn an iPad into a killer e-reader in its own right.\n\nFirst things first: turn off notifications, mute the sound and turn on “Do Not Disturb” mode. To really get into reading, it starts with turning off the outside world. On a tablet, especially the iPad, it takes a conscious effort and a lot of tweaking the settings. The easiest way is probably turning on Airplane Mode which kills all wireless connectivity and leaves just the content pre-downloaded on the device. But if needed, the Wifi and Bluetooth can be turned back on.\n\nWondering where to find a good book? Start with Goodreads, the online community for book lovers and readers everywhere; it’s also owned by Amazon and comes in handy for Kindle users. Its app includes all of the same features as the website, plus it can search books you find by taking a photo of its barcode on the back of the book. Another great resource is Libby, the app from OverDrive. Libby connects with local libraries to manage multiple library cards, e-book loans and browse the catalog.\n\nLooking for where to read said good book? Of course, if your e-reader is an iPad the given place to start would be Apple’s own Books app–– it came pre-installed anyway. Other than that, brand loyalty is the only deciding factor in choosing whether to use the Kindle, Nook or Kobo apps. All include popular features like built-in dictionaries, highlights for words or passages, note creation, bookmarks and more. None of them are able to make e-book purchases and all require an account to download and sync books across devices. Audio books are also a popular option, and iPads support this format better than normal e-readers. Nook has its own audiobook app, while Kobo and Kindle (via Audible, which also has its own app) supports audiobooks in-app.\n\nWhere iPads really pull through as e-readers are the apps not related to books but still great for reading. For every bookmarked article, essay and think piece saved for rainy days, there’s an app that saves and stores them for later. Most people go for either Instapaper or Pocket, the former for its tie with Kindle e-readers and the latter for its Kobo compatibility. Both apps save an unlimited amount of articles, as well as offer paid plans for more in-depth search tools, more highlight options and removes ads. iPad apps are also the best way to stay up to date on the news, and most of the major media outlets have compatible offline modes (the New York Times requires a subscription for offline reading.)\n\nAn iPad is great for nearly everything and an update to the line for the everyday users will be welcome news. With a nearly endless supply of apps that connect to all the popular e-readers, it’s a versatile tablet that fits the in-between for people who want a screen larger than a phone to get some reading done. Nothing beats a physical book, and glass screens always have to deal with certain setbacks, but when it comes down to sheer convenience an iPad will get the novel read."
