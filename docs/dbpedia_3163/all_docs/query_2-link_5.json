Libraries subscribe to one of several services to provide electronic content. Overdrive is probably the most popular right now, and their ebooks use a DRM that requires their own program (overdrive console, a version of Adobe Digital Editions, I believe). Until Overdrive makes an app, you won't be able to read those books on any iOS device.\n\nOther libraries use other providers, but in all cases books will not work until they provide apps that comply with their DRM. I don't know why this surprises people: after all, for many, many years most libraries used an audiobook source that only worked with windows plays-for-sure DRM compatible players, so nobody could use the audiobooks on an ipod or even a Zune. It never seemed to bother most libraries that something like 90% of their potential audience couldn't use the audiobooks they offered. Our local library didn't even understand the issue and kept saying \"but they're MP3 files and any MP3 player can play an MP3 file\", although they were somewhat surprised that MP3 audiobooks turned out be \"less popular\" than they expected. < shrugs >\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Tamara\n\nUser level: Level 6\n\n13,738 points\n\nLV_Bill wrote:\n\nI've been told that my new iPad will not work with U.S. Public Library electronic books. These books are in the format of DRM protected PDF's and ePub's. Is this true? iPads don't work with Public Libraries?\n\nMost public libraries subscribe to a service called Overdrive. So far, Overdrive has not updated their lending libraries to work with the iPad.\n\nSomeone suggested that Apple's feud with Adobe Flash is behind this. I'm looking for the FACTS about this issue - NOT people's opinions. Any more detailed explanation would be sincerely appreciated.\n\nThis has zero to do with it.\n\nSpecifically: What is the technical basis for this issue? Is there any way around it - a circumvention? Does Apple have a future compatibility plan for public libraries? Thanks in advance for any help with this problem.\n\nCompatibility is not up to Apple but up to Overdrive and similar services that supply ebooks to libraries. The technical issue is DRM and the iPad does not support the DRM chosen by library ebook suppliers.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Barbara Brundage\n\nUser level: Level 7\n\n22,066 points\n\niPad does not support the DRM chosen by library ebook suppliers.\n\nJust to clarify what Tamara said, the ipad itself neither supports nor doesn't support any particular DRM. That's up to apps. The apple ibooks app only supports apple's own fairplay DRM, the kindle app supports kindle's DRM, etc.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Barbara Brundage\n\nUser level: Level 7\n\n22,066 points\n\nThe ipad would need for Nook or whatever service your library uses to create an app. The only workaround would be to illegally remove the DRM. All libraries use some content provider--they have a hard enough time keeping going themselves without the expense of hiring a team of coders to digitize their books and paying the necessary rights to do so. It may not be overdrive (there are several others), but I can pretty much guarantee they aren't tatting these ebooks up themselves.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Martin_UK\n\nUser level: Level 2\n\n150 points\n\nIt may not be available in your local iTunes store but there is an app called txtr which supports ebooks protected with Adobe DRM. May do what you want, I use it to read books I bought for my Sony reader.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Barbara Brundage\n\nUser level: Level 7\n\n22,066 points\n\nIt's not in the US store, unfortunately.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Ann Laux\n\nUser level: Level 4\n\n1,843 points\n\nI have a Sony Reader that works with public library books.\n\nA book I bought from the Apple iBook store will not display on the Sony Reader.\n\nLikewise, my e-books purchased from the Sony Reader store will not display on my iPad.\n\nProprietary formats and digital rights--ain't it great?\n\nUntil this Tower of Babel gets fixed, the desktop version software for Sony Reader is free and will work with public library books.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Martin_UK\n\nUser level: Level 2\n\n150 points\n\nIs the kobo app available in your local app store? That allows you to buy new books to read on iPad and download an epub version for your Sony (or other compatible) reader.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Martin_UK\n\nUser level: Level 2\n\n150 points\n\nShame. In a recent interview (google txtr iPad interview) the guys behind suggested it'd be powering apps for a number of major book retailers inside and outside Europe, maybe one will be a US seller.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Barbara Brundage\n\nUser level: Level 7\n\n22,066 points\n\nWell, I suspect copyright/DRM issues are behind the problem, alas.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Ann Laux\n\nUser level: Level 4\n\n1,843 points\n\nI tried Kobo on my iPad. It does not recognize the public library epub books. Neither does iBooks. The public library website confirms that their books do not work on an iPad. That is pretty poor.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Newstech\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n9 points\n\nTxtr asks for my Adobe ID, which I provide, but the Overdrive epub book that opens OK in Adobe Digital Editions on the PC won't open in the txtr app on the iPad. Disappointing, since both theoretically are verified by Adobe.\n\nLink"
