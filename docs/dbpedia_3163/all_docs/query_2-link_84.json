        "text": "When you buy an iPad, how much iPad storage you need is one of the most important decisions you make. All iPads offer at least two options for storage size when you get to the checkout, and the iPad Pros offer even more, going all the way up to 2TB. Apple's tablets can't be upgraded with more internal storage, so the decision will determine whether you can store everything you need on your device.\n\nYou always have the option of using one of the best cloud storage options, but ideally you want to make sure you're getting enough iPad storage on your device to be able to use it comfortably for what you want. To help you decide how much iPad storage you need, we've outlined below the different things to consider.\n\nBelow, we go through the different things that take up iPad storage and then we look at the different storage options and which users they are suited to. By the end, you should have a clear idea of exactly how much iPad storage you need to meet your needs.\n\nIf you're in the market for a new Apple tablet, our guide to all of the current iPad generations may also help you make sense of the different options and take a decision. We also have guides to the best iPad stylus and best iPad keyboard.\n\niPad storage: photos and videos\n\nWhile many of us take heaps of photos and videos with our phones, it is less common to use the more unwieldy iPad to document our lives. That said, you may still need storage for your photos and videos even if you never take a single photograph with your iPad, provided you have enabled one setting: iCloud Photo Library.\n\nThis feature syncs everything in your Photos library to every device where it is enabled. That means if you have thousands of pictures and videos on your iPhone, iCloud Photo Library will copy them to your iPad, taking up space. Before deciding how much iPad storage space you need, check how much is being consumed by media on your iPhone. If you have tons of content that will be synced, you might need more than the base 32GB or 64GB storage options. If iCloud Photo Library is disabled, this is less of an issue.\n\niPad storage: games\n\nIf games are your thing – and your iPad is going to be one of your main gaming devices – then you will likely need a decent amount of storage. Games can take up a lot of space, especially if you want to play high-end, AAA games from major developers.\n\nIf you only play games occasionally, or mostly stick to short, simple games, 32GB or 64GB will be enough for you. But if you have an overflowing games library combined with photos, videos, and other content, you might want to look at 128GB models or above.\n\niPad storage: films, TV and other media\n\nMany people use iPads as streaming devices, watching their favourite content on services like Apple TV+ or Netflix. You might find yourself in the same boat, where storage space may not be too much of a concern since streaming apps do not store their large media files directly on your device. In that case, you might be able to get by with 64GB or even 32GB of space. Just be aware that other files – like your photos or apps – will add to your storage needs, even if you mainly use your iPad for streaming (also see our guide to the best streaming services).\n\niPad storage: apps\n\nMost iPad apps are fairly streamlined, but there are some heavy hitters out there. Professional design and photo-editing apps, for example, can take up hundreds of megabytes each (see our favourite drawing apps for more creative options).\n\nDon’t forget the other important consideration with apps – their files. Creative apps are especially guilty of producing enormous files that eat up space on your device. If you are frequently working with large, complex files, 512GB or even 1TB of storage might be what you need (currently, only the iPad Pro offers that much). Otherwise, you will need much less space.\n\nHow much storage do iPads provide?\n\nThe smallest iPad storage currently available is 64GB, which comes with is the base option offered with the standard 10.2 and 10.9-inch iPads, the iPad Air and the iPad mini. That's probably enough storage if you plan to use your device mainly for browsing and using apps, especially if you also use cloud storage, but it you might soon start hitting the limit if you download images, films or games. The next step up on these iPads is 256GB.\n\nThe starting storage provision on current generations of the iPad Pro is 128GB. This is much more reasonable. But on the other hand, if you're buying an iPad Pro, you're probably planning to use it for a lot more than just browsing and light work - you might even be planning to use it for editing videos.\n\nAgain that means that the starting level of storage could easily fill up - video files in particular can be huge, especially if you're working with 4K footage or log footage. As a result, iPad Pros provide options to go all the way up to 2TB of storage, stopping at 512GB and 1TB on the way.\n\nShould I buy 256GB iPad storage?\n\nFor those looking to buy the standard iPad, iPad Air or iPad mini, the choice is a rather paltry 65GB or paying more for 256GB. If you're going for the standard iPad with a view to getting an affordable tablet that's great for browsing, streaming and light work, 65GB could be fine. If you're going for the more powerful iPad Air or iPad mini and plan to use the tablet for creative work or gaming, we would recommend considering stepping up to the higher storage option, unless you know you'll be using cloud storage a lot.\n\nShould I buy 512GB iPad storage?\n\nIf you're going for an iPad Pro, 512GB provides the sweet spot between storage size and space. The entry-level 128GB on the Pros won't go far if you're doing video editing or design work, but 512GB provides a reasonable amount of space to work with. You might even want to step up to 1TB or 2TB if you want to save having to back things up remotely too often, but the price of the tablet starts to get very steep with these configurations.\n\nAvailable on: iPad Pro\n\nShould I buy 1TB iPad storage or more?\n\nIt is unlikely that many people will ever need this much iPad storage, but that does not mean no one needs it. It is no surprise this storage option is only available on the iPad Pro – it is meant for professional users who use heavy duty apps to the max every day. If you are a professional musician or designer, or work with demanding augmented reality workloads, you might well want 1TB or 2TB to avoid having to regularly back up files to the cloud or to an external SSD."
