        "text": "* This article is from our Tip of the Day newsletter. Sign Up. *\n\nCan you read Kindle books on iPad or iPhone? Yes. However, buying Kindle books on iPhone and iPad is less straightforward. Because Amazon doesn’t want to pay Apple a cut of any in-app purchases, you can’t buy books in the Kindle app for iPhone or in the Amazon app. We’ll show you how to purchase Kindle books on your iPhone or iPad using a web browser instead.\n\nJump To:\n\nHow to Buy Kindle Book on iPhone & iPad\n\nCreate a Shortcut to the Kindle Store for Your Home Screen\n\nFAQ: Other Questions\n\nHow to Buy Kindle Book on iPhone & iPad\n\nThere are no instructions for how to download Kindle books on iPad or iPhone because Amazon doesn’t allow in-app book purchases. However, you can purchase Kindle books on iPhone and iPad using the trick below:\n\nOpen the Safari app.\n\nNavigate to Amazon.com. Make sure NOT TO TAP any prompts to open the Amazon app.\n\nSign in to your Amazon account if you're not already logged in.\n\nOnce you have signed in, tap the menu icon at the top of the screen.\n\nTap See All Departments (or See All).\n\nTap Kindle.\n\nTap Kindle Books.\n\nSearch for and select the Kindle e-book that you want to purchase.\n\nTap Buy now with 1-Click.\n\nAnd it’s bought! It will automatically appear in your Amazon Kindle and Kindle Reader libraries. On your Kindle or in your Kindle app on iPhone or iPad, tap the book you bought to download it to your device.\n\nAny time you use a website for an app you have, your iPhone or iPad will keep prompting you to use the app instead. If you accidentally navigate to the Amazon or Kindle app and try to purchase the book, you will see the message, \"This app does not support purchasing of this content. Digital books and comics purchased from Amazon are available to read in the Kindle app.\" If this happens, just navigate back to Safari. Also, if you have trouble downloading a book due to storage limits, you can also learn how to manage your iCloud storage.\n\nReturn to top\n\nCreate a Shortcut to the Kindle Store for Your Home Screen\n\nI get tired of having to buy Kindle e-books by navigating to the Amazon site through Safari. If you want to find an easy way to buy Kindle books on your iPad or iPhone, there's a shortcut. To learn more iPhone tricks, sign up for our free Tip of the Day newsletter.\n\nFirst, navigate back to the Kindle Books section of Amazon's website, making sure again to stay in Safari and NOT to open the Amazon app.\n\nTap the Share icon at the bottom center of your screen.\n\nScroll down until you find Add to Home Screen and tap it. You may need to tap More for this option to appear.\n\nYou can rename the icon by tapping the title. I like mine to be called Buy eBooks.\n\nTap Add to create an icon for the Kindle store on your Home screen.\n\nFrom now on, you can easily access the Kindle Store by tapping the icon on your iPhone or iPad and buy all the e-books you want.\n\nEven if you tap this shortcut, your Apple device will still prompt you to open the Amazon app. If you accidentally do this, you will have to return to your Home Screen and tap the shortcut or follow the steps to open it in Safari again.\n\nReturn to top\n\nLuckily, the workaround we taught you will make it possible for you to buy new books hassle-free!\n\nReturn to top"
