        "text": "Why you can trust ZDNET\n\n33 years of experience\n\n30 hands-on product reviewers\n\n10,000 square feet of lab space\n\nWhat to Consider\n\n+ -\n\nPurpose\n\nTablets serve different purposes for different users, so the purpose of your soon-to-be tablet is worth considering when choosing the right one. Kids may use one to play and stream, while adults may use one for reading or graphic design. If you’re looking for an entertainment tablet, it’s worth considering one with a high-resolution display and good speakers. If you need one for productivity or work, you’re better off with a strong processor and the ability to use it with a keyboard or stylus.\n\n+ -\n\nPerformance\n\nA tablet is only as good as it performs, so if a fast processor and good responsiveness are essential to you, look for tablets with a powerful processor. Storage is equally important; larger RAM translates into better multitasking capabilities. Also consider internal storage and if there are options for expandable storage.\n\n+ -\n\nOperating system and compatibility\n\niPhone users may prefer an iPad with seamless integration with more Apple products, like AirPods being able to switch between the iPhone and iPad without intervention. The same can be true for Samsung fans. Android tablets feature various brands and models, have more customization power, and are available in wider price ranges. Windows tablets are good for productivity, especially if you need compatibility across desktop apps.\n\n+ -\n\nPrice\n\nThe price range will narrow down the list of tablets considerably. These devices are already expensive to start, but budget and premium options are available. It’s worth considering if high-end features justify the cost for your needs.\n\n+ -\n\nBattery life\n\nLook for long battery life, especially if you plan to use your tablet on the go. You’ll need it to last for the duration of your task.\n\n+ -\n\nExtra features\n\nSome extra features may be exclusive to only some tablets, so consider whether these are important. These features include camera quality, headphone jack, USB-C charging port, weight, compatibility with accessories, and size.\n\nKindle Paperwhite (11th generation) | Best reading tablet overall\n\nKindle Paperwhite (11th generation)\n\nBest reading tablet overall\n\nView now View at Best Buy\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab A8.4 | Best Android reading tablet\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab A8.4\n\nBest Android reading tablet\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nKindle Scribe | Best tablet for reading and note-taking\n\nKindle Scribe\n\nBest tablet for reading and note-taking\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nApple iPad Mini (6th generation) | Best reading tablet for Apple users\n\nApple iPad Mini (6th generation)\n\nBest reading tablet for Apple users\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet (12th generation) | Best kids reading tablet\n\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet (12th generation)\n\nBest kids reading tablet\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nIf you're sick and (physically) tired of the perpetual backaches that come with a heavy book load in your backpack, might we suggest an e-reader instead this back-to-school season?\n\nAlso: Best Kindle readers of 2024\n\nE-readers allow you to store entire libraries (including books, magazines, and even newspaper subscriptions) in one sleek and lightweight device. Of course, you can pick up most tablets, like an iPad, to read a book, but not all tablets and e-readers are created equal or are easy on the eyes. That's why we've rounded up the best tablets for reading if you're ready to dive into the next book on your list or conserve space in your school backpack.\n\nWhat is the best reading tablet right now?\n\nWe compiled this list by extensively going hands-on with the best tablets for reading on the market, considering price, storage, and special features in our testing. Through this, we named the Kindle Paperwhite as the best reading tablet overall for its adjustable lighting, performance, and battery life. However, we also include reading tablets from brands like Apple and Samsung so you can find the right tablet for your needs and reading style in time for going back to school this fall.\n\nThe best reading tablets of 2024\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nIPX8 water resistant for reading poolside or in the bath\n\nAdjustable warm light for nighttime reading\n\nFast performance\n\nCons\n\nLight sensor can be slow to adjust\n\nKindle Paperwhite (11th generation)\n\nBest reading tablet overall\n\nThis Kindle hasn't been updated by Amazon since 2021, but its features, like its adjustable warm light for comfortable reading at night and a long-lasting battery life of up to 10 weeks make it comparable to most e-readers on the market today. Amazon customers who have purchased this Kindle also like its unique features like creating categories to organize your books, uploading your own fonts to use while reading, and the ability to look up words/phrases mid-text and reference past searches.\n\nThe screen features Amazon's signature e-ink technology, much different than the shiny display you'd find on an iPad. E-ink provides a paper-like, matte display thanks to 300 pixels per inch (ppi) and 17 front light LEDs.\n\nReview: Kindle Paperwhite (11th generation)\n\nZDNET contributing writer Jason Cipriani reviewed the Kindle Paperwhite and said the boost in performance is noticeable in the latest generation. \"According to Amazon, the new Paperwhite has 20% faster performance when it comes to turning the page in a book,\" Cipriani wrote. \"There's almost no delay after tapping on the screen before the text refreshes with the next page, ready for action.\"\n\nIt's also waterproof (how many tablets can say that?), so you can read by the pool or in the bath without worrying about stray splashes. If you want to upgrade to have the auto-adjusting light feature and 32GB of storage, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition will cost you $50 more.\n\nKindle Paperwhite specs: Display: 6.8-inch 300 ppi e-ink screen| Battery life: Up to 10 weeks (at 30 minutes per day) | Weight: 7.23 ounces | Storage: 8 GB or 16 GB\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nBright and sharp screen\n\nExpandable memory up to 512GB with a microSD card\n\nCons\n\nRuns on an older Android system\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab A8.4\n\nBest Android reading tablet\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab A8.4 is perhaps lesser known compared to its Tab S counterparts, but this small, lightweight Android tablet makes the perfect handheld reading device.\n\nIt comes with a 1,920 x 1,200 pixel display with 270 ppi (close to Kindle's 300 ppi), so images and text look bright and sharp on screen.\n\nAlso: The best Android tablets\n\nEven though it runs on the outdated Android 9 Pie operating system, you'll still get great tablet features like a 5MP front-facing camera, an 8MP rear camera with autofocus, a long-lasting battery, and the ability to expand your storage to up to 512GB with a microSD card (that's a lot of books!).\n\nOne Amazon user who rated this Android tablet 5 out of 5 stars called it the best tablet for its price, saying, \"I am an avid Kindle reader and I like to listen to music while I read. Using the Wi-Fi and my Amazon Music Unlimited, I have the best of all worlds.\"\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab A8.4 specs: Display: 8.4-inch WUXGA Display TFT (270 ppi) | Battery life: 10 hours | Weight: 10.93 oz | Storage: 32GB\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nImpressive battery life\n\nIncluded pen for handwritten notes\n\nCompatible with Microsoft Word\n\nCons\n\nNot waterproof\n\nPremium pen upgrade will cost you more\n\nDoes not support note-taking on magazines or newspapers\n\nKindle Scribe\n\nBest tablet for reading and note-taking\n\nThe Kindle Scribe is perhaps the perfect example of part e-reader, part tablet to satisfy your reading and note-taking needs. It has the same functions you've come to know and love in a Kindle, like a 300 ppi glare-free screen, weeks of battery life, and adjustable warm light. It's also compatible with Amazon's Basic or Premium Pen, so you can take handwritten notes or underline important quotations within the book you're reading.\n\nYour notes are automatically organized in one place for every book so that you can browse, review, and export them via email. The Kindle Scribe also comes with preset templates to help you create notebooks, journals, and lists, and you can create sticky notes in Microsoft Word and other compatible Word documents.\n\nReview: Amazon Kindle Scribe\n\nZDNET contributing writer Matthew Miller went hands-on with the Kindle Scribe and called it \"close to perfect.\" \"I use my Kindle Scribe daily as my primary note-taking device, and the habit of carrying it has also resulted in me reading more books than I have in years,\" Miller wrote. \"It's an excellent ebook device while also serving as a capable working tablet.\"\n\nThe Kindle Scribe comes with the Basic pen, but for the more advanced features like a dedicated eraser and the shortcut button, you'll need the Premium pen, which costs $30 extra. However, Amazon customers who have reviewed the Kindle Scribe say that the premium pen is worth paying extra for, especially since it has an eraser and a button that lets you switch the nib from writing to highlighting.\n\nKindle Scribe specs: Display: 10.2-inch 300 ppi Paperwhite display| Battery life: Up to 12 weeks (at 30 minutes per day) | Weight: 15.3 ounces | Storage: 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nStrong performance in A15 Bionic chip\n\nPixel-dense display makes for sharp text\n\nTrue Tone technology\n\nCons\n\nMost expensive option\n\nApple iPad Mini (6th generation)\n\nBest reading tablet for Apple users\n\nOf course, you don't have to get a dedicated e-reader in order to read on a tablet. The iPad Mini is a powerful tablet with great applications, and it serves as a great reading device thanks to its lightweight and sharp screen. It has an 8.3-inch liquid retina display with 326 ppi, which is a higher resolution than the Kindles. As a result, text looks especially sharp on screen, and coupled with Apple's True Tone technology (which adjusts the color and intensity of your display to match the ambient light), it provides a natural reading experience.\n\nReview: Apple iPad Mini (6th generation)\n\nCipriani also tested the Apple iPad Mini and praised it highly, saying, \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't absolutely fascinated by it... With the iPad Mini, which ships with iPadOS 15, I set up a new Focus mode that automatically turns on whenever I open the Kindle app,\" he wrote. \"It blocks all alerts and messages from showing up while I'm reading and then turns off once I leave the app.\"\n\nApple's anti-reflective screen coating also reduces the likelihood of catching a sunlight glare when reading outside on a sunny day. One Best Buy reviewer notes that the screen display lighting \"is quite soft to the eye -- not to mention versatile as well.\"\n\nWith the iPad Mini, you're also getting Apple's powerful A15 bionic chip, an ultra-wide 12 MP front camera, support for the 2nd-generation Apple Pencil to take notes, 80% faster graphics than the previous model, Touch ID, and more.\n\nAuthor's Note: The Apple iPad Mini (6th generation) is currently on sale for $380 (save $120) on Amazon.\n\nApple iPad Mini specs: Display: 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display (326 ppi) | Battery life: 10 hours | Weight: 10.4 ounces | Storage: 64GB or 256GB\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nTwo-year worry-free guarantee\n\nIncludes a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+\n\nCons\n\nAmazon Kids+ subscription will cost extra after free trial\n\nNot as great screen quality as other options\n\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet (12th generation)\n\nBest kids reading tablet\n\nAmazon's Fire HD 8 Kids tablet is worth checking out for a kid-friendly reading tablet. It has a kid-proof case built to withstand use by children aged 3 to 7, and it also comes with a free one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+. The subscription gives you access to thousands of kid-friendly, ad-free books and movies, games, and other educational content your child will love.\n\nReview: Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet (12th generation)\n\nZNDET writer Maria Diaz had her kids tested the Fire HD 8 Kids tablet and called it \"a perfect first tablet\" built with kids in mind. \"Endurance is the main reason why any parent should buy the Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids,\" Diaz wrote. \"I can't tell you how many times my preschoolers have dropped (or thrown) their [Amazon] tablets and stepped on them 'by accident' over the past three years, yet the screens have remained intact.\"\n\nParents can use parental controls built into the tablet to control screen time and set educational goals for their children. This ensures that your kid is actually reading or learning something while using the tablet. Plus, it has 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording and the ability to add themed filters and fun frames to photos.\n\nOverall, 95% of customers who purchased this reading tablet at Best Buy would recommend it to other parents, giving it an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars.\n\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet specs: Display: 8-inch HD display, 1280 x 800 (189 ppi) | Battery life: Up to 13 hours | Weight: 1.14 pounds | Storage: 32GB or 64GB\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nWhat is the best reading tablet?\n\nThe best reading tablet is the Kindle Paperwhite, which has reading-specific features like adjustable warm light, great battery life, and a screen that's easy on the eyes. Below is an overview of how the best reading tablets compare based on price, display size, and battery life:\n\nWhich reading tablet is right for you?\n\nWhile all these reading tablets are great options, it ultimately comes down to a few questions. Do you want your tablet to be just for reading, or do you also want it for other things like streaming and web browsing? How big do you want the tablet to be? How much storage space do you need, and how much are you willing to spend?\n\nHere is a look at the unique features of each of these reading tablets:\n\nFactors to consider when choosing the best reading tablets:\n\nWhether you want to jot notes while reading, have a water-resistant tablet for poolside browsing, or invest in a kid-friendly option, we have you covered. ZDNET considered price, size, and special features when making our final picks.\n\nPrice: A decent e-reader can range from $100 to $500. You can easily find an e-reader or tablet within your desired price range that serves your reading purposes and offers large memory, long-lasting battery life, and a lightweight feel for ultimate portability.\n\nSize: If you opt for an e-reader instead of physical books, you want that device to be lighter than those novels you're lugging around. We considered how much these e-readers and tablets would weigh in your book bag.\n\nSpecial features: Some e-readers are water-resistant for beach days or bathtime reads, while other tablets boast matte screens designed for easy reading on a sunny day.\n\nHow we test tablets\n\nThe ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when tested in the real world. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.\n\nDisplay: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.\n\nWe also compare the display's performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen's responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer's stylus.\n\nPerformance: For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet's temperature during intensive tasks.\n\nBattery life: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.\n\nCamera and audio: For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.\n\nFor a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive tablet testing methodology.\n\nWhat is the best tablet size for reading?\n\nThe average size book is 6 by 9 inches, so tablets that have a 7 to 10-inch screen are about the same as picking up and reading an actual book. However, please pay attention to how much a tablet weighs since you don't want it to be too heavy for its size.\n\nAlso: The best small tablets you can buy\n\nYou can also test out what works for you by visiting a local electronics retailer or bookstore.\n\nIs it better to read on a tablet or a Kindle?\n\nIf you're serious about reading, getting a Kindle over your average tablet is probably your best bet since they come with reading-specific features like adjustable warm light, waterproof designs, and page-turn buttons.\n\nAlso: Which Kindle e-reader is right for you? The top models compared\n\nHowever, if you want an all-in-one type tablet, you can opt for a tablet like the iPad Mini or the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.4 for browsing the web, streaming videos, taking photos, and reading books.\n\nIs it healthy to read on a tablet?\n\nLike all things, doing something too much or too long is never good. If you want to use a tablet for reading, be sure to take frequent breaks to give your eyes a rest from the screen. It's also a good idea to invest in a pair of blue light blocking glasses if you plan to read on a tablet at night.\n\nWhen do tablets go on sale?\n\nOther products we've tested:\n\nView at AmazonView at AmazonView at Amazon\n\nEditorial standards"
