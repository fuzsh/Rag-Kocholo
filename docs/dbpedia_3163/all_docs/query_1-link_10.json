Just glancing at new book titles and searching for something that could catch my attention. Usually, when I find a book in a bookstore that catches my attention, I quickly search it up on the Amazon store or an e-library store and add it to my eBooks cart. I have done this for the last four years since I started taking my Kindle seriously.\n\nBut yesterday, was different.\n\nFor the first time in years, I decided to buy a paperback. Well, two paperback books. I got them for a good deal and buying paperbacks felt good for a change.\n\nThatâ€™s until I started reading them later that night. I quickly realized why I spent the last few years reading only on my Kindle and iPad. Paperbacks got me nostalgic in the bookstore but the inconvenience of reading them reminded me of everything wrong with them.\n\nJust a quick detourâ€¦ if you like such kind of tech stories, consider signing up for my email newsletterâ€¦"
