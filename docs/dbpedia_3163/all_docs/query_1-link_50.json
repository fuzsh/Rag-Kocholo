        "text": "Stay focused by having your iPad read with you.\n\nNote: This applies to technology kits issued fall 2018 through spring 2022. Changes were made to the Digital Flagship initiative after spring 2022.\n\nAfter class, work, student organization meetings and spending time with friends, you're probably exhausted. One feature that can help you focus on your assignments is to have your iPad read with you. Read and listen at the same time for a new study method.\n\nSpeak Screen Methods\n\nThere’s multiple ways to have your iPad read with you.\n\nTurn on Speak Screen and Speak Selection\n\nFirst, you need to turn on Speak Screen and Speak Selection in the Settings app. Here’s how:\n\nGo to Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content\n\nTurn on Speak Screen and Speak Selection\n\nSpeak Selection\n\nSpeak Selection allows you to highlight text in any app and choose Speak as an option. This is method is helpful when you only want to review a few paragraphs at a time.\n\nHow to use Speak Selection:\n\nGo to a website or note. Highlight a section of text by long pressing on a word and dragging the selection bar over the text you want to be read aloud\n\nTap Speak in the actions bar\n\nSpeak Screen\n\nSpeak Screen will read the entire on the screen. This method is helpful for reading large amounts of text.\n\nHow to use Speak Screen:\n\nGo to a website or note\n\nSwipe down with two fingers to heard the page read aloud. A tool bar will appear that allows you to pause, rewind, fast forward and change the reading speed\n\nDifferent Voices\n\nYou can also choose different voices to read to you. You can select different voices from different languages and even different dialects from different languages.\n\nChoose Different Voices Step-by-Step:\n\nGo to the Settings app\n\nChoose Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices\n\nSelect the language you wish to use\n\nYou will notice all of the voices available. To use any language, you will need to download it first. Select the download button the right part of the screen to download each individual voice.\n\nAfter downloading each voice that you are interested in, select the right carrot and then tap the name. You will then see a checkmark to the left of the name to show that you have chosen that voice\n\nFeel free to use Speak Selection to test the voices you might use. Here are a few voices we recommend:\n\nSiri Female and Siri Male: we recommend these voices because they both sound the most realistic compared to the other voice options.\n\nAlex: this voice can contextualize a paragraph so that the context is understood and all words are pronounced correctly. Alex will even pause to take a breath, which makes the reading sound realistic and natural. Download Alex and then listen to him speak these sentences for proof:\n\nThe bandage was wound around the wound.\n\nThe farm was used to produce produce.\n\nThe dump was so full that it had to refuse more refuse.\n\nThe soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert.\n\nI did not object to the object.\n\nDr. Love lives on Love Dr.\n\n$167,123,768,987,987,890,890.50\n\nResources to Remember"
