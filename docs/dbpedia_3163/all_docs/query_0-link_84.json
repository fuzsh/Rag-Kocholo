        "text": "Revu for iPad\n\nRevu for iPad\n\nAvailable on the App Store\n\nInterface Map\n\nEasily access, markup and collaborate on PDFs from anywhere.\n\nTips and Tricks\n\nSwitch to landscape mode to keep the Tool Chest, File Access and Bookmarks tabs open\n\nIn portrait mode, the left panel containing the Tool Chest , File Access and Bookmarks tabs automatically closes after use in order to maximize screen real estate. To access these features, tap on Tab Access or simply rotate your iPad to landscape mode and tap the blue nub.\n\nTransfer your existing tool sets to Revu for iPad\n\nIf you have created custom tool sets in Revu and you would like to use them in Revu for iPad, you’re in luck.

Submissions sent between 8am on Monday to 5pm on Friday Pacific Time will be answered within 24 hours.\n\nPrinting\n\nRevu for iPad 3.8 and above\n\nTap the Send To button.\n\nTap AirPrint from the dropdown menu.\n\nFollow the directions from the AirPrint dialog box to print your document.\n\nAirPrint will only work if your printer is on this list of supported printers.\n\nRevu for iPad 3.7 and below\n\nIf you have the iBooks app installed, you can tap the Send To icon, select Flatten & Open In… , and then choose iBooks to print through AirPrint.\n\nSpeech-to-text dictation in Revu in iPad\n\nEnable Siri and check to see that you have Internet connectivity. Then, tap the microphone on your keyboard while in Revu to add text to PDFs through dictation.\n\nDisable Control Center while in Revu for iPad\n\nGo to Settings.\n\nSelect Control Center and disable Access Within Apps.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do I connect to the Studio U.K. server?\n\nFor directions on connecting to the Studio U.K. server and more, please see our Bluebeam Studio U.K. FAQ for iPad\n\nWhat can I do with Revu for iPad?\n\nRevu for iPad includes some of the most popular features of Bluebeam Revu for Windows, enabling you to redline PDFs and collaborate with others on the go. Access PDFs through Dropbox, Box, iTunes, Studio Projects or WebDav, and redline PDFs with measurement or markup tools, including your existing tool sets. Additionally, collaborate with project partners across the globe anywhere, anytime, regardless of Internet access, and review the same PDFs together in real time using Bluebeam Studio.\n\nRevu for iPad does not include all the features found in Revu for Windows. Our app is designed to provide users with the features they need to document issues and collaborate in the field, without compromising speed.\n\nSome of the recommended things to set up on Revu Windows instead of Revu for iPad include:\n\nCustom Columns\n\nCustom Statuses\n\nShareable Tool Sets\n\nGrouped Markups\n\nHyperlinks\n\nSpaces\n\nMarkups added to existing Spaces in a PDF while using Revu for iPad will appear properly in that Space when viewed on Revu Windows.\n\nHow do I sync a file/folder in Revu for iPad?\n\nSyncing files in Revu stores them locally on your iPad and makes them available offline. Follow the steps listed below to sync a file or folder:\n\nOpen the Document Manager and tap the Connection icon in the upper-left to make sure it’s green.\n\nTap Edit in the lower-right corner of the Document Manager.\n\nSelect the files and folders you want to sync by tapping the empty circle located to the left of their names.\n\nTap Set in the lower-right corner to mark the items for syncing.\n\nTap Done, and then Sync in the lower-left corner when you’re ready to download latest versions.\n\nTap the Device icon in the upper left of the Document Manager to view the files you’ve downloaded.\n\nWhy do some files render much faster than others in Studio?\n\nAs of Revu for iPad 3.0, Studio is now powered by Studio GO. Studio GO is an instant rendering solution for large format single sheet document sets, with support for revisions. Large document sets should be broken up to get fast rendering speed. Please contact us if you’d like to provide any feedback about this feature, or Revu for iPad in general.\n\nWhat does 'Purge Studio GO Data' do to my files?\n\nThe “Purge Studio GO Data” button will remove the extra data and space that Studio GO requires when caching your files. This is local to your device only and does not affect the server in any way.\n\nAdditionally, this does not affect the original PDFs themselves. They will still be available offline.\n\nWhy don't markups I've created on the iPad show up on other PDF apps for the iPad?\n\nRevu for iPad was designed to fully support markups created in the Windows version of Revu. These markups could be more advanced than those originally supported by iOS. To display markups created in Revu (Windows or iPad) on other PDF viewers, flatten these markups from within Revu.\n\nWe also offer a free PDF viewer for both the Windows and iPad called Vu, which supports all markups created in Revu.\n\nWhy do some PDFs render slowly?\n\nThere are many reasons why some PDF files will render more slowly than others. One of the main reasons this occurs is because of the efforts made towards rendering all markups correctly and generating the Markups list. Some documents render slowly because of a large amount of vector content. To see instant rendering speeds, check out Studio GO in the What’s New in Revu for iPad 3.0 Video.\n\nAdjusting the rendering preferences may help improve rendering speed. Here is a brief explanation of what each function does:\n\nEnable Safe Rendering Engine\n\nThis option uses the built-in iOS PDF rendering library to render the PDF content. It is recommended to be turned on; however, some PDF content will only render correctly if it is turned off.\n\nIncremental Rendering\n\nThis option allows the PDF to begin rendering parts of the file incrementally. When it is disabled, the PDF will not display until all objects have been loaded, which is most useful when viewing vector-based PDF drawings. If your document is a scan, turning this option off should speed up the total rendering time.\n\nEnable Tile Caching\n\nTile Caching allows PDF regions off-screen to render and cache to memory. This improves panning performance but may slow down overall rendering time. We recommend you enable Tile Caching if you will be reviewing and scrolling through multi-page PDFs. When disabled, rendering will not start until the PDF has stopped moving.\n\nPreload Pages\n\nThis option renders a placeholder image for the previous and next page of the file, making it appear to load much faster than if it were rendering normally. This option only works with Tile Caching turned on.\n\nWe understand that performance and rendering speed are important aspects of any application, and our developers are constantly working on ways to improve them.\n\nPlease contact Bluebeam Technical Support if you have files that are affected by slow performance which you can send in for testing.\n\nCan I finalize a Studio Session on Revu for iPad?\n\nCurrently it is not possible to finalize a Studio Session from Revu for iPad. Studio Sessions must be finalized from a full version of Revu.\n\nWhat's this menu that keeps popping up when I try to open the Markups list?\n\nStarting in iOS 7, a Control Center menu is activated by swiping up from the bottom edge of the screen. In Revu for iPad, this menu prevents users from invoking the Markups list with the same action. The Markups list can still be opened by tapping, rather than swiping, the bottom nub. Better yet, the Control Center can be disabled via iOS’s Settings Menu > Control center > Access Within Apps (off).\n\nCan I get a refund?\n\nWe’re sorry if you are unhappy with your purchase of Revu for iPad. Please contact us if you’re experiencing any issues, we’re happy to help.\n\nIf your issues cannot be resolved, you can request a refund from Apple. Locate the email receipt for your iTunes Store purchase and click Report Problem to explain the issue in detail. Apple will then review and issue the refund per their discretion.\n\nWhere is the chat record located for a Studio Session?\n\nStudio Session attendees can chat throughout their real-time PDF collaborations. To view the chat during a Studio Session, simply tap the Studio tab in the Markups list. To send a message, tap the Chat icon. Tapping a chat message in the list takes you to that attendee’s view when it was originally typed.\n\nCan I purchase the iPad app in volume?\n\nYou can sign up to purchase Revu iPad through Apple’s Volume Purchasing Program. Upon purchasing, you will receive a redemption code that can then be distributed to each user. Click here to learn more about Apple’s Volume Purchase Program."
