        "text": "A few years ago a Kindle or e-book reader was one of the few relatively popular gadgets I didn’t already own. I simply didn’t see the need as I already owned an iPad mini. However, one day when I was visiting a mall in Sweden, I saw a pretty good offer on the Kindle Paperwhite. The exchange rates were favorable and my curiosity got the better of me, so I bought it for around 100 EUR / 110 USD. 4 years later this has turned into a bit of a love story. My iPad mini is long gone but my Kindle is with me everywhere I go.\n\nThe Kindle is greater than the sum of its parts\n\nYou may be forgiven for thinking that the iPad is superior if you read a review outlining the technical pros and cons between a Kindle and a tablet. Sure, the iPad has a crisp color display and on the surface, the differences are subtle. However, those small differences are the ones that really matter for your reading experience and they are completely one-sided in favor of the Kindle.\n\nHere’s why the Kindle wins…\n\nA few points to the iPad\n\nThere are always exceptions, of course. If you want to read comics or generally something with a lot of graphics, the iPad is a better choice. However, in that case, I would buy physical copies as the experience on iPad is not really great either.\n\nIf you have a special need for other stores than Amazon, the iPad can accommodate that. The Kindle is manufactured by Amazon and exclusive to their store. If you can read in English, you will probably never miss anything and the prices are competitive.\n\nIf you only read inside at home, a tablet may also be sufficient, as long as you don’t have to read in the sun or transport it. I would, however, still argue that holding the Kindle for a prolonged time is a much better experience than the iPad. Reading from your lap will give you neck cramps.\n\nThen there’s also the crisp, colorful, and responsive display on the iPad, which, to be fair, is a lot better than a Kindle. I don’t notice this when I am deeply engrossed in a book. It can be annoying for browsing the Kindle store, but you can do that on another device and then send it directly to your Kindle instead.\n\niPad vs Kindle is the wrong question\n\nBefore I bought the Kindle, I was curious if the Kindle was better for reading e-books than a tablet or just a cheaper alternative.\n\nAs an owner of both an iPad and a Kindle now, I would argue that the question is wrong. It is not a matter of buying either. What you should be asking is this; Is it worth getting a Kindle if I have an iPad already? And the answer to this is a resounding yes. You should have both because they’re for two different purposes. Making a direct comparison is simply wrong.\n\nThe Kindle is superior for reading e-books for a simple reason; it’s what it was made for!\n\nBonus tips\n\nHere are some last bonus tips that you may be wondering about.\n\nWhich model to buy?\n\nThere are a lot of different Kindle models but the Kindle Paperwhite generations provide by far the best value for money. They have a good resolution for crisp text, a decent bezel, and are extremely affordable. You only need a more premium model if you also want to use it for audiobooks. However, I would recommend using your phone for that any day.\n\nGo buy your Kindle Paperwhite now! (I get a small commission at no extra cost to you if you use the link).\n\nWhat about other manufacturers?\n\nThis was strictly about Kindle vs iPad. I would, however, say that you can get some pretty good value on other e-readers that are not exclusive to Amazon’s Kindle Store. You should not exclude these from your considerations.\n\nWhat about color ink e-readers?\n\nIf consider a color e-reader, I would recommend buying a physical book or, in a fact stick to the iPad.\n\nWhat about note-taking e-readers?\n\nHybrids between note-taking tablets and e-readers have also surfaced. While these may be good for business use, I find that most of them are too big for leisure reading by the pool or a comfy chair.\n\nWhat about audiobooks?\n\nIn my personal opinion, audiobooks are great … for falling asleep and missing half the book."
