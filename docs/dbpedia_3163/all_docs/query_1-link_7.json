        "text": "MacFinnley: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just curious. Do you read on your iPad? And if so, do you have an iPad Mini, Regular or even Pro? Do you read in Bus/Train/Plane as well or just at home in bed and on couch? üôÇ\n\nI have an old Kindle for reading when I‚Äôm on the way to work/home but I consider buying an iPad Pro 9.7. Is it too big to read on it?‚Äù\n\nCE3: ‚ÄúI find the 9.7 to be the perfect size for books. Although I don‚Äôt read nearly as often as I should, I enjoy the experience on my iPad when I do. I had a smaller 7-inch Galaxy tablet a long time ago and never liked reading on it much.‚Äù\n\nTrueBlou: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a 12.9‚Ä≥ iPad Pro and I read on it every night. I‚Äôve got a Kobo Aura h2o as well but it‚Äôs not seen use for a while, I mostly use that when I go on holiday for when I‚Äôm sitting at the pool.\n\n(I also like the screen size for my Gary Larson books and the like, nice and big and clear.)‚Äù\n\nSmacrumon: ‚Äú use an iPad mini for reading and web browsing. I read and web browse on an iPhone, but web browsing is more enjoyable on the iPad. I also use the iPad mini to test an app I‚Äôm developing which can simulate an iPhone screen as well as behave like a regular iPad. I use Pages for basic document creation. But I do find that working on the iPad decreases productivity so anything substantial I‚Äôm working on, I often need to return to an iMac.\n\nI use the iPad mini usually on the couch or on a table, at the library or on the go. One reason I chose the mini was due to it‚Äôs very neat compact size and much lighter weight than the larger iPads. Plus, the mini doesn‚Äôt have a protruding camera. (I think the camera sticking out on the new iPad Pro is such a poor design decision, but that‚Äôs just an opinion.)\n\nI suspect the Kindle with e-ink has much better display quality for reading in super bright light such as under the sun at the beach. The iPad won‚Äôt be as great in super bright beach light. But I guess this all depends on if your iPad likes to stay seaside under the sun often.\n\nI was attracted to the mini because although the colour gamut technically wasn‚Äôt apparently as good as an iPad (which I haven‚Äôt really been able to notice), the image quality was incredibly sharp, even more sharper than iPad when comparing them side by side. (This would likely be due to the higher pixels per inch (ppi) with 326 ppi on the iPad mini just like on iPhone vs a lower 264 ppi on iPad Air and Pro.)\n\nFor ebooks, and other resources in the typical ebook format, mini is great, and I can adjust the text size when reading in the iBooks app. Sometimes when reading A4 sized PDF‚Äôs though, due to the text size being fixed in a PDF, text can be rather small to read on the mini. However that‚Äôs easily fixed by a double tap on the block of text to zoom in and focus in on that piece of text, or rotating the device landscape to fill the width also works a treat. Sometimes when reading PDFs, and depending on the set up of the PDF document, I get slightly strange colours due to the way the document was created either in an RGB or CMYK colour space (e.g. dark blue displays as lighter cyan blue). It‚Äôs not an issue for most things, just some PDFs.‚Äù\n\nSparksd: ‚ÄúI do all of my Kindle reading on my Air 2 and no longer use my Kindle PaperWhite because I strongly prefer the Air 2. I usually read sitting up in a chair or while laying in bed.‚Äù\n\nOzaz: ‚ÄúI use my iPad mini to read during my commute and when relaxing at home. I mainly read newspaper apps, eBooks, and web articles. I prefer the size of the mini to the 9.7‚Ä≥ iPad.‚Äù\n\nSnarl: ‚ÄúI read heavily on my iPad, books, magazines,comics etc‚Ä¶ Excellent reader for me.‚Äù\n\nRestlesslegs: ‚ÄúSimilar to others here I do read a lot on my iPad (Air 1), but only ‚Äúdisposable literature‚Äù (newspapers, news magazines) ‚Äì for serious stuff I much prefer my Kindle Paperwhite, for some reason I can much better concentrate, might be a matter of lighting and screen‚Ä¶ I also do 80% of my web browsing on my iPad.‚Äù\n\nProfets: ‚ÄúI enjoy reading books on iPad quite a bit. I find the mini and the Plus size iPhone to be the most comfortable for pure book reading. Though I‚Äôm now using a 9.7‚Ä≥ iPad and reading still feels great.‚Äù\n\nBoston04and07: ‚ÄúThis is a really interesting thread. I‚Äôve used multiple screen sizes and types to read pretty much everything at this point. I‚Äôve now settled on an iPad mini 4 and absolutely love it. I use it to read .epub books, textbooks, and PDFs in iBooks and so far, it‚Äôs the best reading experience I‚Äôve had. I actually prefer it to my older Kindle, since the clear retina screen feels way easier on my eyes than the not-quite-white against not-quite-black text that the Kindle had.\n\nI also like that the iPad‚Äôs screen emits its own light. I know I‚Äôm way in the minority here, but I‚Äôm very finicky with my reading light and I get eyestrain pretty quickly if the ambient light hitting a printed page is even a bit too dim. Weird as it is, the backlight of the iPad mini 4 eliminates that issue for me completely and I get eyestrain way less than when I‚Äôm reading from a printed page. I know that the newer Kindles would probably eliminate that issue for me too, and I admit I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try them yet, so it might not be a fair comparison. However, I‚Äôm definitely happy with my mini 4 and wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.\n\nI had a mini 2 before the 4, and the newer screen is just phenomenal in comparison. I always knew the mini 2‚Äôs screens had issues, but I guess I just got used to it over the years. But now that I have a mini 4, there really is no comparison! The colors and clarity are just incredible. I used to use the 9.7‚Äú iPads before I had the mini 2, and I always thought they were a bit too big for book reading to me. As much as I prefer backlit displays for reading, the 9.7‚Äù was just too big, emitting too much light, especially when I was reading in bed. The mini 4 is closer in size to your average paperback, so I feel most comfortable with a device that size.‚Äù\n\nVogue Harper: ‚ÄúiPad Pro 9.7‚Ä≥ for reading my photography magazines ‚Äì the colour retina display is just perfect for this.\n\nI have to admit though, for reading novels and other text books, I still cannot move away from my Kindle Paperwhite. The e-ink display is hard to beat. It just feels so much more natural and akin to reading a physical paper copy of my books.‚Äù"
