        "text": "BFA Product Design alumna Yogita Agrawal ’15 blends entrepreneurship, sustainability, and community-oriented design in the work of Ware Innovations, her Mumbai-based startup. While at Parsons, Agrawal devised Jhoule, a wearable, human-motion-powered lamp for use in off-grid Indian villages. And she and two other Product Design students created Soapen — a crayon-like soap that encourages children to wash their hands — which won an award and support from UNICEF. Agrawal's interdisciplinary design studio is currently developing a range of sustainable household products.\n\nAs Director of Design Strategy and Operations of The Lab at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Sean Baker helps government organizations use design to address pressing public issues. He works with nonprofits, NGOs, and agencies to improve the policies, programs, services, and products that civil servants and citizens rely on daily. Baker’s government position is raising awareness of the importance of well-reasoned service design and has made the MFA Transdisciplinary Design graduate a sought-after advisor on design-led change.\n\nReese set new standards in women's ready-to-wear fashion after studying at Parsons. She worked under French designer Martine Sitbon and eventually became head of the Women's Portfolio for Perry Ellis. She went on to launch a resort wear line and flagship stores in NYC and Tokyo, and she recently started two sustainable fashion lines. Reese has served on the board of the Council of Fashion Designers of America and her celebrity clients include former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nOver the last 20 years, BFA Communication Design graduate Robert Wong has invented innovative Web tools that have revolutionized contemporary life. As chief creative officer of Google Creative Lab, he and his team create campaigns that weave technology into everyday experience to positive effect.\n\nHiggs is a curator exhibiting for the digital age. His social media posts for celebrated jeweler David Webb have attracted younger audiences. And on his own popular Instagram account, Higgs dazzles followers with close-ups of seldom-seen jewelry masterpieces from around the world, paired with storytelling that brings design history to life.\n\nNew York City has no equal. A dynamic center of future-facing people, creativity, and industry, it feeds your growth as a developing artist or designer. And as a student in the center of Greenwich Village, you’re part of a diverse community with deep roots in free thinking, activism, and innovation.\n\nExplore More"
