The Organization connects nations, partners and communities to promote health and serve the vulnerable. WHO works with its Member States to achieve the highest level of health for all people by pursuing universal health coverage.\n\nStructure and governance\n\nHistory\n\nWHO headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland. WHO is governed by 194 Member States grouped into 6 regions. Each region is represented by a regional office, which coordinates programming in country offices and field offices.

This includes training the health work force, supporting policy development and working towards sustainable financing for health systems.\n\nWHO also responds to emergencies including natural disasters, conflicts and displaced populations.

The boundaries, names and designations used on maps do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area, of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.\n\nI am travelling abroad soon. Where can I find information and advice on health risks?\n\nThe latest information on international travel, including current recommendations on travelling during the COVID-19 pandemic, is available on the travel advice page.\n\nWHO has prepared an eBook on ways to stay healthy while travelling internationally.

These emails may request information or money from individuals, businesses or non-profit organizations with the promise that they will receive funds or other benefits in return. These emails sometimes carry the WHO logo and come from or mention an email address made to look like a WHO or United Nations address.\n\nThese emails are not sent from WHO or associated with WHO projects or events.\n\nMore information is available on our cyber security page. If you have any doubts about the authenticity of an email, letter or phone call that suggests that it is from or connected with WHO, please report the misinformation online or contact us."
