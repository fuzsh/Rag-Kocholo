        "text": "Answer 4: In some instances, after the filing of one or more SARs, law enforcement has contacted a financial institution requesting more specific information with regard to the suspect activity or requesting identified supporting documentation. In other instances, a law enforcement agency has contacted a financial institution to report that it does not intend to investigate the matter reported on the SAR.\n\nIf conduct continues for which a SAR has been filed, the guidance set forth in the October 2000 SAR Activity Review (Section 5 – Repeated SAR Filings on the Same Activity) should be followed (i.e., organizations should report continuing suspicious activity with a SAR being filed at least every 90 days) even if a law enforcement agency has declined to investigate or there is knowledge that an investigation has begun. The filing of SARs on continuing suspicious activity provides useful information to law enforcement and supervisory authorities. Moreover, the information contained in a SAR that one law enforcement agency has declined to investigate may be of interest to other law enforcement agencies, as well as supervisory agencies. (6/2001)\n\nAnswer 7: The SAR rules require that a SAR be filed no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the initial detection of the suspicious activity, unless no suspect can be identified, in which case, the time period for filing a SAR is extended to 60 days.\n\nIt may be appropriate for organizations to conduct a review of the activity to determine whether a need exists to file a SAR. The fact that a review of customer activity or transactions is determined to be necessary is not necessarily indicative of the need to file a SAR, even if a reasonable review of the activity or transactions might take an extended period of time. The time to file a SAR starts when the organization, in the course of its review or on account of other factors, reaches the position in which it knows, or has reason to suspect, that the activity or transactions under review meets one or more of the definitions of suspicious activity.\n\nOf course, an expeditious review, wherever possible, is recommended and can be of significant assistance to law enforcement. In situations involving violations of law requiring immediate attention, the organization should immediately notify appropriate law enforcement and supervisory authorities, in addition to filing a SAR. (12/2000)\n\nAnswer 8: Federal law (31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2)) prohibits the notification of any person that is involved in the activity being reported on a SAR that the activity has been reported. This prohibition effectively precludes the disclosure of a SAR or the fact that a SAR has been filed. However, this prohibition does not preclude, under Federal law, a disclosure in an appropriate manner of the facts that are the basis of the SAR, so long as the disclosure is not made in a way that indicates or implies that a SAR has been filed or that the information is included on a filed SAR.\n\nThe prohibition against disclosure can raise special issues when SAR records are sought by subpoena or court order. The SAR regulations direct organizations facing those issues to contact their primary supervisor, as well as FinCEN, to obtain guidance and direction on how to proceed. In several matters to date, government agencies have intervened to ensure that the protection for filing organizations and the integrity of the data contained within the SAR database remain intact. (12/2000)\n\nAnswer 9: As set forth in the October 2000 SAR Activity Review (Section 5 – Disclosure of SARs and Underlying Suspicious Activity), Federal law (31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2)) prohibits the notification to any person that is involved in the activity being reported on a SAR that the activity has been reported. This prohibition extends to disclosures that could indirectly result in the notification to the subject of a SAR that a SAR has been filed, effectively precluding the disclosure of a SAR or even its existence to any persons other than appropriate law enforcement and supervisory agency or agencies. This prohibition does not preclude, under Federal law, a disclosure in an appropriate manner of the facts that are the basis of the SAR, so long as the disclosure is not made in a way that indicates or implies that a SAR has been filed or that information is included on a filed SAR.\n\nIn the rare instance when suspicious activity is related to an individual in the organization, such as the president or one of the members of the board of directors, the established policy that would require notification of a SAR filing to such an individual should not be followed. Deviations to established policies and procedures so as to avoid notification of a SAR filing to a subject of the SAR should be documented and appropriate uninvolved senior organizational personnel should be so advised.\n\nThe prohibition on notification of a SAR filing can raise special issues when SAR filings are sought by subpoena or court order. The SAR regulations direct organizations facing these issues to contact their primary supervisor, as well as FinCEN, to obtain guidance and direction on how to proceed. In several matters to date, government agencies have intervened to ensure that the protection for filing organizations and the integrity of the data contained within the SAR database remain intact. (6/2001)\n\nAnswer 14: The CTR exemption regulations do not distinguish between a “licensed” or “non-licensed” business. In determining whether any check-cashing business is eligible for exemption from currency transaction reporting requirements, a depository institution must determine whether the business falls into either of two categories described below: (12/2017)\n\n1. An entity listed on one of the major national stock exchanges, or a subsidiary of an entity listed on those stock exchanges as described in 31 CFR § 1020.315). If a customer falls under one of the categories identified in 31 CFR § 1020.315, the depository institution does not need to determine if the business activity is considered ineligible for exemption as identified in 31 CFR § 1020.315(e)(8). Once the depository institution has determined that the customer qualifies for an exemption based on the above criteria, the depository institution may file a one-time DEP form.\n\n2. A non-listed business, if the criteria of 31 CFR § 1020.315 are met. Determining if a business can be considered a non-listed business depends, in part, on whether the customer is primarily engaged in one or more of the ineligible business activities listed in 31 CFR § 1020.315. If primarily engaged in such ineligible business activities, then the customer cannot be treated as a non-listed business.\n\na. One of the ineligible business activities listed in 31 CFR § 1020.315 is serving as a financial institution. Under the BSA, the definition of “Financial Institution” includes money services businesses (MSBs) [31 CFR 1010.100(ff)]. A check casher is defined as an MSB if it cashes checks in an amount greater than $1,000 in currency or monetary instruments for any one person in any one day in one or more transactions [31 CFR 1010.100(ff)(2)]. Consequently, if the check casher meets the definition of an MSB, it is considered to be serving as a financial institution. Therefore, if the check casher is defined as an MSB and is primarily engaged (see item b. below) in the business of cashing checks [or other ineligible business activity listed in 31 CFR § 1020.315, then it is ineligible for treatment as an exempt person.\n\nb. If a business engages in multiple business activities (e.g., money transmission in addition to check cashing), it may be treated as a non-listed business so long as no more than 50% of its gross revenues is derived from one or more of the ineligible business activities listed in § 1020.315.\n\nExample 1: A check casher (whether licensed or non-licensed) that cashes checks in an amount less than $1,000 in currency or monetary instruments for any one person on any one day and is not involved in any other ineligible business activity, or derives no more than 50% of its gross revenue from any such business, may be exempted from CTR reporting requirements as a non-listed business (assuming that all other criteria listed in 31 CFR § 1020.315 are met).\n\nExample 2: A check casher (whether licensed or non-licensed) that cashes checks in an amount more than $1,000 in currency or monetary instruments for any one person on any one day and derives more than 50% of its gross revenue from cashing checks (and/or other ineligible business activity) may not be exempted from CTR reporting requirements as a non-listed business because it is serving as a financial institution under the BSA regulations.\n\nAnswer 16: Government officials sometimes need to conduct large currency transactions as part of their official duties. For example, a law enforcement official may wish to convert seized currency into monetary instruments for security reasons. Banks are not required to file a CTR when a Federal, state or local government official, as part of his or her official duties, engages in a transaction in currency over $10,000. In addition, banks do not need to file a Designation of Exempt Person form (FinCEN Form 110) for customers that are a department or agency of the United States, of any State, or of any political subdivision of any State. A bank should, however, take the steps to ensure that the customer is eligible for the exemption (that the customer is a government official conducting business on behalf of a government agency) and document the basis for that determination (e.g., reviewing the customer’s law enforcement credentials or government photo ID). Non-bank financial institutions, however, are required to file a CTR when a Federal, state or local government official, as part of his or her official duties, engages in a transaction in currency over $10,000.\n\nRegardless if a financial institution is required to file or voluntarily files a currency transaction report for this scenario, it generally is required only to obtain, verify, and record identifying information pertaining to the agency for which the individual is working. Thus, any employee identification number, address, or other identifying information obtained should correspond to the government agency involved, and not the government official conducting the transaction.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, a financial institution should still obtain and record the name of the government official conducting the transaction. Regarding the purchase of a monetary instrument for more than $3,000 in currency, a financial institution should record the name and date of birth of the government official, for the financial institution’s records. (12/2018)\n\nAnswer 17: There are frequently asked questions regarding how to conduct independent reviews on money services business anti-money laundering programs. FinCEN has issued the following guidance 1.\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act requires money services businesses to establish anti-money laundering programs that include “an independent audit function to test programs.” In implementing this requirement, we determined to make clear that money services businesses are not required to hire a certified public accountant or an outside consultant to conduct a review of their programs. Rather, the relevant Bank Secrecy Act regulation requires money services businesses to establish anti-money laundering programs with written policies and procedures that:\n\nProvide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program. The scope and frequency of the review shall be commensurate with the risk of the financial services provided by the money services business. Such review may be conducted by an officer or employee of the money services business so long as the reviewer is not the person designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\n\nThe primary purpose of the independent review is to monitor the adequacy of the money services business’ anti-money laundering program. The review should determine whether the business is operating in compliance with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and the business’ own policies and procedures. Each money services business should identify and assess the money laundering risks that may be associated with its unique products, services, customers, and geographic locations. Regardless of where risks arise, money services businesses must take reasonable steps to manage them. Each money services business should focus resources on the areas of its business that management believes pose the greatest risks, and the level of sophistication of the associated internal controls should be appropriate for the size, structure, risks, and complexity of the money services business."
