        "text": "Many individuals with ichthyosis, particularly ARCI-lamellar ichthyosis, do not sweat normally. The thickness of their skin and the scale does not allow their sweat to reach the surface of their skin and cool them effectively. In very hot and humid weather they are at risk for overheating, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\n\nFACT: People with ichthyosis do have sweat glands. However, the thickness of the skin and the scale does not allow sweat to reach the surface of their skin and cool them effectively; so many individuals with ichthyosis do not sweat normally and suffer from overheating.\n\nStrategies for avoiding heat emergencies\n\nSymptoms of Heat Stroke\n\nFirst Aid for Heat Emergencies\n\nRemove person from the heat to a cool place where they can lie down with their feet elevated about 12 inches.\n\nApply cool wet cloths (or cool water directly) to the person’s skin and use a fan to help the water to evaporate and lower their temperature. Place cold compresses on the neck, groin and armpits. Do not use alcohol rub.\n\nGive the person cool water to sip, Gatorade or slightly salted water (1 teaspoon salt per quart of water). Give ½ cup every 15 minutes. Do not give salt tablets, alcohol or caffeine.\n\nSeek medical help immediately if the person shows signs of shock (bluish lips and fingernails, and decreased alertness), has a seizure, or loses consciousness.\n\nSun Protection and Cooling Products\n\nDownload/Print PDF Overheating\n\nThis information is provided as a service to patients and parents of patients who have ichthyosis.
