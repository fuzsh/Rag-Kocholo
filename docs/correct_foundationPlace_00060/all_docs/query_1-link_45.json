Specifically, this is the area where GCF serves as a community leader by acting as a catalyzing force that creates a better future for all by addressing our region’s most critical or persistent challenges.\n\nAs a foundation – part of our mission is to build a community where everyone can thrive and fulfill their full potential. Racial equity is the overarching goal for our community leadership work because we believe that a racially equitable community is the ideal state for our region.\n\nNow is the time to address the racial divide and we're doing so by targeting investments in the Black community."
