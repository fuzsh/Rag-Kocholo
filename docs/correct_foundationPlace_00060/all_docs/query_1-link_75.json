        "text": "New Grant Focus\n\nAt Mizuho, we believe in the transformative power of technology, both for business and the communities in which we live and work. In the rapidly evolving marketplace, technological knowledge and application are critical to career readiness. However, gaps in access and opportunity are leaving many capable young adults behind.\n\nIn 2023, Mizuho announced a new grantmaking strategy targeting the intersection of technology and equity, supporting innovative and effective nonprofits in New York City that help underrepresented young adults acquire the technical and professional skills necessary to access competitive-wage jobs.\n\nWhy have we chosen this path?\n\nAs the corporate foundation of a leading financial services firm, we recognize that our industry and corporate clients are moving through a profound digital transformation. We aspire for a future where everyone, regardless of background, has access to technology skills that can put them on a path toward financial well-being and career success. Working with our community partners, the Mizuho USA Foundation is focused on helping young adults who possess the ability and desire to succeed but lack the training that today’s workforce requires.\n\nOn a macro level, digital tech ability is necessary to enable a robust civil society, dynamic economic activity, and the achievement of critical world targets such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nGrant Programs\n\nWe have launched two new grant programs to support organizations that promote equitable access to IT training and employment opportunities, build skills for the future, and empower young adults to achieve their full potential:\n\n1) FutureReady Grants – multi-year grant support for nonprofit organizations to provide training in technology skills, expand exposure and access to career paths, and support achievement of employment.\n\n2) Opportunity Grants – general operating support for nonprofits engaged in technology training and career access for underrepresented young adults."
