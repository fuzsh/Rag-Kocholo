        "text": "We focus on several priority areas across our business and respond to emergent needs where we are uniquely positioned to make a positive difference. Our work especially emphasizes historically underrepresented communities, because we envision a world that embraces diverse perspectives and where all individuals have equitable opportunities.\n\nOur community impact efforts are focused on seven key areas:\n\nSupporting economic impact in communities\n\nCreating and preserving affordable housing\n\nAddressing food insecurity and basic needs\n\nEmpowering students and adults through education and skills training\n\nSupporting disaster relief and response efforts\n\nFunding nature in our communities\n\nAddressing health equity\n\nTo continue serving and innovating for our customers, we invest heavily in the communities where we operate. Amazon has made significant investments in the U.S. economy since 2010, which have contributed more than $880 billion to national gross domestic product.\n\nWith approximately 1.5 million full- and part-time global employees as of the end of 2023, Amazon adds economic vibrancy in the places where we invest: 47% of the people we hired for operations roles in 2023 were unemployed before joining Amazon, and two of every five U.S. jobs that we’ve created over the last five years have been in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents.\n\nWe believe that all people should have access to housing they can afford. We’re working to address national housing affordability challenges in the U.S. starting in our hometown communities.\n\nOur Progress\n\n$1.8 Billion Invested\n\nAs of the end of 2023, we invested $1.8 billion to create and preserve homes that will support nearly 35K residents.\n\nIn 2021, we launched the Housing Equity Fund, a commitment of $2 billion to preserve and create more than 20,000 affordable homes in three communities where we have a high concentration of employees: Washington state’s Puget Sound region; Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia; and Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nour progress\n\n10+ Million Meals Delivered\n\nOur Community Delivery program leverages our network of last mile fleet delivery service providers to provide free meal deliveries from food banks and other local organizations to households in need. In 2023, we delivered over 10 million meals through the program.\n\nWe strive to bring healthy, affordable food to our communities through our delivery service providers (DSPs), donations, funding, and partnerships with organizations helping individuals and families faced with food insecurity.\n\nIn partnership with local food banks, we are scaling our food redistribution efforts to contribute to food security in local communities. As of the end of 2023, 100% of our grocery facilities in North America and Europe partner with a local food bank, over 40 of which are Feeding America affiliates.\n\nWe believe in the power of education to unlock human potential, which is why we invest in programs and tools to help children, students, and adults develop valuable STEM skills.\n\nIn 2020, we pledged to help 29 million people around the world grow their technical skills with free cloud computing skills training by 2025. Our programs to support this commitment include Amazon Future Engineer, AWS Training and Certification, AWS re/Start, AWS Academy, AWS Educate, AWS Think Big Space, our partnership with Girls in Tech, and AWS GetIT.\n\nAmazon Future Engineer is our global childhood-to-career computer science program, created to inspire and educate thousands of students each year from underserved and underrepresented communities. As part of this program, students explore computer science by meeting actual Amazon employees in virtual live career talks or explorations of our real-world innovations.\n\nWhole Foods Market runs a Local Producer Loan Program to support small, local, and independent food producers across the U.S. and Canada with business expansion loans. Since Whole Foods Market began the program in 2006, the program has provided over 390 loans representing over $29 million in capital for loan recipients. In 2023, Whole Foods Market funded 11 loans totaling over $1.2 million.\n\nTo make an impact in our communities, Whole Foods Market has three foundations to support strategic programs across the globe:\n\nWhole Planet Foundation is committed to alleviating global poverty for people living in communities around the world that supply products for Whole Foods Market stores.\n\nWhole Cities Foundation expands healthy food access and nutrition education by partnering with community-led organizations to build thriving local food systems.\n\nWhole Kids Foundation supports schools and inspires families to improve children’s nutrition and wellness."
