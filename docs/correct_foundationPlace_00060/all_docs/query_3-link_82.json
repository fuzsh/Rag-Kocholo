        "text": "Meet or manage your customers' needs\n\nTailor your level of service to suit your customers' needs. Some businesses work well providing a 'no frills' or basic level of service, while others go beyond customer expectations to achieve a level of service to impress their customers.\n\nIn each case, the business communicates to create and manage customer expectations about the service it provides.\n\nFailing to meet or manage expectations\n\nCustomer expectations come from many places, including interactions with staff, promises and claims from advertising, in-store signage and your branding.\n\nWhen a business fails to meet or manage these customer expectations, customers may be disappointed or dissatisfied.\n\nFor example, if you promote a product or service as 'high quality' or you've made an offer to a customer, this becomes a promise that they expect you to follow through on. Failing to honour that promise can lead to complaints, lost sales or limited repeat business.\n\nPoor customer service, and the perceived indifference of staff and management, is often where customer expectations are not met.\n\nCustomer complaints can alert you if your business is failing to meet customer expectations. Learn more about managing customer complaints.\n\nTo improve your customer service:\n\nidentify and investigate problem areas\n\nidentify recurring issues and develop strategies to prevent them\n\ntrain staff in good customer service and sales skills\n\nrotate staff to increase their knowledge of other areas of your business\n\nencourage and support teamwork\n\nreview processes for hiring and recruitment.\n\nCreate a service delivery flowchart\n\nA service delivery flowchart will help you to examine the links between what your customers expect (e.g. service delivered by trained staff), and how successfully the service met customer expectations. It can help you identify gaps in your customer service, and how to improve.\n\nCreate a set of maps and figures that describe:\n\nhow you deliver service to customers\n\nwhere things can go wrong\n\nwhat is done when there is a service failure.\n\nConsider including these 4 actions in your service delivery flowchart.\n\nMeasuring customer service\n\nIdentify areas of your customer service that are measurable, and regularly check that these meet your expectations. There are many ways to measure the success of your customer service.\n\nMystery shoppers\n\nMystery shoppers can provide your business with objective third party feedback on your customer service.\n\nTo get started with mystery shopping, you can:\n\norganise a friend or family member who isn't known to your staff to visit or phone your business. Have them ask specific questions of your staff to test their product knowledge, helpfulness and the time taken to be served\n\nhire a mystery shopping company, who can design their visits around your specific requirements.\n\nSurveys and feedback forms\n\nCustomer feedback can be a good measure of your service. Make sure you review any feedback regularly and track recurring issues, which will help you improve your customer service. Share customer feedback with your staff so they understand what customers are saying.\n\nTo collect information on customer satisfaction, you can:\n\nuse survey cards where customers rate aspects of your service (e.g. on a scale of 1 to 5)\n\nfollow up a product or service purchase with an email survey or feedback form\n\nask for feedback on specific aspects of your business or leave forms open-ended, like a suggestion box.\n\nYou may like to invite customers to provide their name and contact details so you can get in touch with them to discuss their feedback in more detail. Make sure you are correctly collecting and storing customer information.\n\nBusiness website\n\nInclude a feedback page or section on your website (this could be with your contact information) with a statement that you appreciate, value and assess all feedback.\n\nFind out more about building and managing your website.\n\nBusiness social media\n\nMonitor both negative and positive comments posted by customers across social media platforms your business is featured on. These can include Google reviews, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and TripAdvisor.\n\nFind out more about managing online communication and customer reviews.\n\nBusiness records\n\nYou can also measure aspects of your operations that have numerical values, such as:\n\nnumber of orders\n\nnumber of complaints\n\nnumber of pageviews on your website.\n\nOver time, these numbers provide a benchmark for performance. Changes in these numbers over time can provide insight into aspects of your customer service.\n\nCreate a customer service program\n\nA customer service program formalises the level of customer service you aim to provide, and what practical things you will do to achieve this and improve customer loyalty and retention.\n\nCustomer loyalty and retention\n\nCustomer retention relies on building customers' product loyalty and satisfaction. It is often more expensive to find a new customer than to retain a current customer.\n\nSatisfied customers are more likely to be loyal customers.\n\nLoyal customers:\n\ncreate great word-of-mouth referral (potentially reducing advertising costs)\n\noffer repeat business\n\nuse competing products less and are open to your alternatives\n\ncreate more stable demand for your products and services\n\nmay be more willing to forgive issues in the delivery of your product or service.\n\nSteps for creating an effective customer service program\n\nA successful customer service program involves planning, development and implementation. You and your staff must be committed to sustain it for a period of time so you can evaluate the results.\n\nTo create your customer service program:\n\nthink about what your customers need\n\nplan how you will meet their needs—write a document outlining the program's aims, details, and how it will be implemented throughout your business\n\ndeliver training to your staff, including training for any new systems\n\nimplement the program, making sure all staff are confident with it\n\nsustain the program by reviewing changing customer needs and feedback\n\nencourage and support staff through a staff recognition program.\n\nIf your program is working well, your customers will be satisfied and more likely to be loyal to your business, which, in turn, means higher profits for you.\n\nWorking with staff\n\nEncourage staff to work together to put the needs of the customer first. Ask staff to treat customers as individuals and listen to their comments, complaints and requests. Thank customers to ensure that they feel valued, important and needed. These small things add up to a great customer service attitude.\n\nStrive to have your team understand that customers are not an interruption or distraction to completing other tasks—customers are the reason for being in business.\n\nAs the first point of contact for your customers, recognise that you and your team must:\n\nhave the right attitude\n\nfeel valued and part of an inclusive environment that includes customers\n\npresent with a positive outlook\n\ncontribute to improvement\n\nadvocate for the business.\n\nCustomer service systems and processes\n\nReview the ways your customers buy from you and if this can be improved. If customers find the buying experience frustrating or difficult, they may not bother to complete their first purchase, or any future purchases.\n\nAlso consider..."
