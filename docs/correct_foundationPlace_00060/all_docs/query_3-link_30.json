        "text": "Our Mission\n\nThe mission of EPA is to protect human health and the environment.\n\nTo accomplish this mission, we:\n\nDevelop and enforce regulations\n\nWhen Congress writes an environmental law, we implement it by writing regulations. Often, we set national standards that states and tribes enforce through their own regulations. If they fail to meet the national standards, we can help them. We also enforce our regulations, and help companies understand the requirements.\n\nLearn more:\n\nRegulations\n\nEnforcement\n\nGive grants\n\nNearly half of our budget goes into grants to state environmental programs, non-profits, educational institutions, and others. They use the money for a wide variety of projects, from scientific studies that help us make decisions to community cleanups. Overall, grants help us achieve our overall mission: protect human health and the environment.\n\nLearn more:\n\nGrants\n\nStudy environmental issues\n\nAt laboratories located throughout the nation, we identify and try to solve environmental problems. To learn even more, we share information with other countries, private sector organizations, academic institutions, and other agencies.\n\nLearn more:\n\nEPA research\n\nSponsor partnerships\n\nWe don't protect the environment on our own. We work with businesses, non-profit organizations, and state and local governments through dozens of partnerships. A few examples include conserving water and energy, minimizing greenhouse gases, re-using solid waste, and getting a handle on pesticide risks. In return, we share information and publicly recognize our partners.\n\nTeach people about the environment\n\nProtecting the environment is everyone's responsibility, and starts with understanding the issues. The basics include reducing how much energy and materials you use, reusing what you can and recycling the rest. There's a lot more about that to learn!\n\nLearn about environmental issues\n\nView our site for students and educators\n\nPublish information\n\nThrough written materials and this website, EPA informs the public about our activities.\n\nWeb publishing schedule\n\nWhat we don't do\n\nSome problems that seem like something we would handle are actually the responsibility of other federal, tribal, state or local agencies. It may be most appropriate for you to contact your city, county, or state environmental or health agency, or another federal agency, rather than EPA. For example:\n\nThe Endangered Species Act is primarily managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management addresses the problem of nuclear waste."
