The children in Easterseals' programs have disabilities and/or behavioral challenges, which means that teaching materials can be easily ripped or destroyed. Picture exchange communication systems (PECS), are a particularly impactful tool at Easterseals. Pictures of objects with the word underneath are used to support children who are nonverbal. With the use of this new commercial laminator, the Easterseals staff and teachers can now create visual aids, worksheets, and classroom materials once and preserve them for use for the entire school year and beyond. Laminated materials can be written on and wiped clean for reuse; thus eliminating the need to print materials again and again.\n\nRotary and Easterseals have a legacy partnership that spans over a century! From the beginning, Rotary International and Easterseals have been together. Paul Harris, founder of Rotary International, and Edgar Allen, founder of Easterseals, shared a friendship and passion for service and volunteerism to improve communities worldwide. Rotarian Edgar Allen founded a hospital in Elyria, Ohio after his son's death in a streetcar accident in May 1907. Soon after, Allen dedicated his life to creating community-based services for children with disabilities, recruiting Rotarians to create a network of programs that would become Easterseals.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT EASTERSEALS, visit: https://www.easterseals.com/sepa/\n\nAs part of the celebration for the sesquicentennial anniversary of the borough of Lansdale, the Rotary Club of North Penn members participated in a parade that kicked off 'Founder's Week\" in the borough. We had a great time walking the length of Main Street, passing out candy to the children and Rotary information to the adults. President Stanley Hunt drove the decorated car and members walked alongside with smiles and waves to the thousands that attended!\n\nFor more information on the festivities of \"Founder's Week\" visit Discover Lansdale's website: https://lansdale150.org/founders-150\n\nLANSDALE DAY 2022\n\nSATURDAY, JUNE 4TH\n\nWeather looks spectacular - so we are a GO for the 45th Annual\n\nLANSDALE DAY ARTS & CRAFTS FESTIVAL\n\n10am - 4pm Main Street, Lansdale\n\n4-Way Test Speech Contest held on MARCH 22, 2022\n\nOn Tuesday March 22nd, we were honored to host this year's 4-Way Test Speech Contest and are so very proud of the students that participated! We heard amazing persuasive speeches that included topics about healthcare coverage, abortion and implicit bias - all answering the questions: Is it the Truth? Is it Fair to All Concerned? Will it build Good Will & Better Friendships? and Will it be Beneficial to All Concerned? These questions serve as the ethical code by which all Rotarians try to live their personal and professional lives. CONGRATULATIONS to our three student winners, all hailing from Lansdale Catholic High School - Archdiocese of Philadelphia : Sarah Grosch (1st place), Sarah Fernandez (2nd place) & Shane Rodowicz (3rd place). All students won a cash scholarship from our Rotary Club and the first place winner will go on to compete in the Regional contest next month for a chance at more cash scholarships! We wish all of these students the very best in their future plans!\n\nA HUGE thank you to all of our judges, volunteers, 4-Way Test Speech contest committee Rotarians (Kristin York & Leon Silver), faculty, parents, familial support and invited special guests! A nod of gratitude also to Stove and Tap restaurant for the fabulous food & excellent service!\n\nThe ROTARY CLUB OF NORTH PENN PLANS\n\n45th Annual LANSDALE DAY 2022 - JUNE 4th\n\nMARK YOUR CALENDARS AND JOIN THE FAMILY FUN COMMUNITY DAY\n\nSaturday, June 4, 2022 â¦ 10am-4pm\n\nWest Main Street - Lansdale, PA\n\nâºScores of talented Local Artists & Artisans; displaying and selling their unique handcrafted wares - something for everyone!\n\nâº Live Music & Fun activities for the whole family\n\nâºFood Courts and Food Trucks\n\nâº50-50 RAFFLE $$$$ to WIN!\n\nâºCommunity Marketplace - local businesses\n\nâºGames & Give-Aways from our SPONSORS\n\nâºStrawberry Festival - benefiting Fairmount Fire Co\n\npart of Lansdale's 150th Birthday Celebration\n\nFor more information about this event and/or\n\nHow to become a vendor - click HERE\n\nScience, Technology,Engineering & Mathematics\n\nYouth ExplorerAcademy\n\nSummer 2022: A FREE 4-Day 3-Night Residential Camp\n\nfor two NORTH PENN area Middle School Students* offered by The Rotary Club of North Penn\n\nin partnership with Rotary District 7430\n\n*Student nominations are made by the middle school principals and forwarded to our Rotary Club\n\nAcademy begins on Friday, July 8, 2022 at 12:00 p.m. and concludes at 7:00 p.m. on Monday, July 11, 2022\n\nTHE ACADEMY\n\nThe SETI Institute & Albright College & SRI (Science Research Institute)\n\nEstablished with: SETI Education Staff, SRI Educators & District Rotarians\n\nComplete with:\n\nâºState of the art labs & equipment\n\nâºDorms & cafeteria for the students\n\nPlease CONTINUE reading to learn details!\n\nCOMING IN 2022\n\nLansdale's Grand Anniversary!\n\nA SUMMER OF CELEBRATION AND COMMEMORATION FOR THE BOROUGH'S SESQUICENTENNIAL**\n\n**Including a STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL on JUNE 4, 2022 - same day as the Rotary Club of North Penn's 45th annual LANSDALE DAY!\n\nWe are excited to share LANSDALE DAY with an old time town favorite returning for just this year - the Strawberry Festival!\n\nWe expect a very large crowd for Lansdale Day - for more information, click HERE\n\nMore details about the sesquicentennial celebration can be found on Discover Lansdale's website\n\nSTAY TUNED FOR SOME EXCITING INFORMATION\n\nABOUT AN UPCOMING EVENT IN AUGUST.....\n\nThe Rotary Club of North Penn, host of annual LANSDALE DAY, doesn't stop when then festival ends - we are onto the next project, looking for ways to help our community and grow as a service club - the GREATEST Service Club in the North Penn Area!!

Jack Crotty, Taylor Connelly, and Kira Sullivanâs projects were wonderfully described in last weekâs newsletter by our own Super Doc.\n\nAs a relatively new member to Rotary I was interested to know more about these clubs that provide young community leaders an introduction to Rotary and our ideals. Interact is for people ages 12-18 to develop leadership skills while discovering the power of Service Above Self (511,796 members in 22,252 clubs). After Interact, Rotaract is for those ages 18-30 to exchange ideas with leaders in the community, develop leadership and professional skills, and have fun through service (242,949 members in 10,563 clubs). There is also the Rotary Community Corps (RCCS) that plan and carry out projects in their communities and support local Rotary club projects but are not members of a Rotary club (210,500 members in 9,900 corps).\n\nThese clubs are a wonderful opportunity for our young community leaders to hone their skills, network, meet new friends, and hopefully live a fulfilled life within the Rotary community.\n\nCyber-Monday & Giving Tuesday\n\nor anytime this Holiday Season.....\n\nShop Amazon and an automatic donation is made to our Rotary Club so we are, in turn, able to\n\nhelp those in need in our NORTH PENN community!!\n\nSupport us when you shop on Cyber Monday & Giving Tuesday!!\n\nGo to smile.amazon.com/ch/75-3050562 and\n\nAmazon donates to North Penn Rotary Club Charitable Foundation Inc.\n\nEnd Hunger Event\n\nPurple Pinkie\n\nBreaking bread with the Valley Forge Tourism and Convention board (VFTCB)\n\nFor Service Tuesday at Manna on Main Street Chris, Kris, Mohana, Sam, Tammy, Virginia and Will helped to serve a gourmet meal provided by the Valley Forge Tourism and Convention board (VFTCB). This is the second year the VFTCB has taken over the kitchen at Manna, the kitchen was commanded by President & CEO Mike Bowman (a chef in a prior life) while his team worked with the Rotary and Manna teams in the front of the house (excluding Will who manned the dishwashing station â a man who is not afraid to get his hands dirty). The guests were thrilled with the three coarse meal: house salad, grilled chicken breast on a bed of mixed veggies and a side of roasted potatoes, finished with apple crumble and ice cream. After the guests retired we joined the VFTCB team for an amazing meal and fellowship.\n\nVFTCB is also in their third year of their food drive, a gift to Pope Francis when he visited the Montgomery area â what else can you give someone that chose Francis as his papal name?\n\nDistrict Governor Richard Gromis speaks at our Club\n\nOur Rotary Club of North Penn club was honored by the District Governor Richard Gromis and his wife (and fellow Rotarian) Sue being our guest speaker at our July 18th dinner. Please read Kristin Yorkâs excellent newsletter that describes the visit. Through Rotarian communications DG Rickâs emphasizes the importance of long-term strategic planning to prevent âClub Driftâ as leadership annually changes, âmajor goals for the 2017-2018 Rotary year is to strongly encourage each club to draft, resurrect, or revise a strategic plan for its clubâ. Rick also states that ââ¦as always, we will be concentrating on membership, but we will be also focused on retention. Our goal is to start one new club this year and a net increase of one new member in every club.â Rick also plans to appoint a Public Image Chairperson with a primary focus on social media, âThe District and our clubs need to have an effective social media presence.â\n\nThank you, Scott - Congratulations President Bob\n\nOn Tuesday, June 27th, we met to thank President Scott Grande for this past year of service to our Club and to Rotary.
