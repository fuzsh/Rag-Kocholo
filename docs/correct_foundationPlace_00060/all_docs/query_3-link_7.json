        "text": "Yes. Scientific and regulatory agencies around the world, including the World Health Organization, The European Food Safety Authority, the U.S. American Medical Association, Health Canada, and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, have examined the effects of GMO food crops in widespread commercial production and have concluded that foods made from these crops are safe for consumption by people of all ages and animals, and safe for the environment as well. GMO ingredients have been safely and widely used in food production for more than 30 years.\n\nWe have found that allergen lists become outdated and old versions remain in circulation. Rather than have you make purchase decisions based on outdated information, we encourage you to check the ingredient and allergen information on the package for information about a product. If you have additional questions, we are happy to help.\n\nYes, many Hershey products are made with GMO ingredients. In the United States, crops such as corn, soy, and sugar beets are primarily GMO crops. As of 2018, the USDA estimated that 94% of all soybeans, 92% of corn, and 99.9% of sugar beets harvested in the US came from GMO plants.\n\nMany Hershey ingredients come from the same sources broadly used throughout the US food and beverage industry. All ingredients meet our rigorous internal standards for safety and quality that frequently exceed local regulatory requirements.\n\nAt Hershey, we are committed to openness and transparency. We know that our consumers want to know more about the foods they eat, where they come from, and how they are made. We support the disclosure of GMO ingredients and comply with the regulatory requirements in each country where our products are sold. In the US, we have chosen to use SmartLabel® as the primary tool to provide consumers easy access to information about our products, including the use of bioengineered ingredients. A quick scan of the QR Code on a package in the US will take you beyond the label and put detailed information at your fingertips. For items that do not have a QR Code, consumers will find bioengineered food disclosure information on the label, either as text or a logo defined by the USDA Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard. Our global consumers can access our website or contact the consumer relations team to find out more about our products.\n\nFoods that are sold in the U.S. with ingredients containing detectible bioengineered DNA will have the following disclosure: “contains a bioengineered ingredient.”\n\nIn the U.S., foods containing ingredients in which the modified genetic material is not detectible are not considered bioengineered even if the ingredient is derived from a bioengineered crop. To reflect that difference, these products will have the following disclosure: “Ingredient(s) derived from a bioengineered source.”\n\nThe Gluten-Free Confections list is located in the Dietary Needs webpage of our website.\n\nHershey produces a number of zero sugar products that may be useful in a diet for people living with diabetes. Visit the Dietary Needs webpage to learn more about our zero sugar products.\n\nYes, Hershey does have number of products that do not contain GMO ingredients. The following products are Non-GMO Project Verified: barkTHINS snacking chocolate, Hershey’s Natural Unsweetened Cocoa, Hershey’s Simply 5 Syrup, SkinnyPop popcorn, Paqui Tortilla Chips, and several flavors of Pirate’s Booty snack puffs. In addition, we offer a line of Certified Organic products that include milk and dark chocolate bars as well as Reese Peanut Butter cups. We encourage customers to use SmartLabel® or refer to our packaging labels for ingredient information because we are always striving to create new products to satisfy our customers’ needs and expectations.\n\nVisit our Allergens page to learn how Hershey manages allergies.\n\nThe amount of PGPR used is quite small (as is the amount of soy lecithin). For example, in our milk chocolate, it is less than 1% of all ingredients.\n\nThe small amount of caffeine present in chocolate occurs naturally in the cocoa bean, unlike the caffeine in soft drinks which is added during the manufacturing process.\n\nThe amount of theobromine in specific Hershey's chocolate products are listed in the Ingredient Topics page.\n\nNo. PGPR is a processed ingredient, but it is made from natural ingredients such as castor beans, soybean oil and sunflower oil.\n\nYes, PGPR is a commonly used and a safe ingredient. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) and other international regulatory authorities have reviewed PGPR and indicate that it is safe and suitable for use in food production.\n\nGMO ingredients have been widely used in food production for more than 30 years. GMO crops have played an important role in supporting sustainable agriculture by improving crop yields to ensure there is a robust food supply for the world’s growing population. In the US, the most commonly grown GMO crops include corn, soy, and sugar beets. These crops may be more resistant to insects and weeds or better able to withstand disease, thus reducing the need for insecticides and herbicides.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, genetically modified plants, animals, or microorganisms have genetic material (DNA) that has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. In the United States, GMO is referred to as Bioengineered or BE for purposes of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (the Standard). The Standard ensures consumers have access and transparency to the BE content of food products.\n\nFarmers have used selective breeding techniques for thousands of years to improve the quality and productivity of food crops. Today, modern methods of plant biotechnology enable plant geneticists to improve the genetic makeup of food crops more rapidly than is possible through traditional selective breeding techniques. Genetic engineering has allowed scientists to produce plants that are more resistant to pests and are more drought tolerant. These crops allow for stronger yields and less loss which reduces food insecurity around the world. Other benefits may include longer shelf life, better appearance, and enhanced nutrition.\n\nFood crops that have been altered using these modern genetic techniques as well as ingredients made from those food crops are commonly referred to as “GMOs.”\n\nPolyglycerol polyricinoleate, more commonly known as PGPR, is an emulsifier that is made from castor beans, soybeans or sunflower seeds. It’s used in cooking oils and fats, spreads, low fat dressings, ice cream, and flour. In the confectionery industry, it is used to improve the consistency of chocolate. It improves the flow of chocolate to aid in moulding it into bars.\n\nFor purposes of the U.S. National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, the U.S. Department of Agriculture defines a bioengineered food as a food that contains detectable genetic material that has been modified through certain lab techniques that cannot be created through conventional breeding or found in nature. This standard has established a mandatory disclosure for foods that are made with ingredients that contain detectable bioengineered DNA or may be sourced from bioengineered crops. Consumers will see the term “bioengineered” on some food labels in the United States as the new standard takes effect.\n\nOn packages that carry a QR code, consumers will be able to access the BE disclosure for a particular product via SmartLabel®. For products that do not carry a QR code, a text statement or logo will be printed on the package.\n\nFood products that are sold in the U.S. with ingredients containing detectable bioengineered DNA will have the following disclosure: “contains a bioengineered ingredient.”\n\nIn the U.S., food products that contain ingredients in which the modified genetic material is not detectible are not considered bioengineered even if the ingredient is derived from a bioengineered crop. To reflect that difference, products containing these ingredients will have the following disclosure: “Ingredient(s) derived from a bioengineered source.”\n\nAn emulsifier is an ingredient that is typically used to keep fat and water from separating in the product. When cooking at home, egg yolks are often used as an emulsifier. They also facilitate the moulding of chocolates into various shapes. PGPR is made from natural ingredients such as castor beans, soybean oil and sunflower oil. Another emulsifier used by Hershey is soy lecithin, which is commonly obtained from soybeans. It is not a substitute for the cocoa butter or fats used in chocolate."
