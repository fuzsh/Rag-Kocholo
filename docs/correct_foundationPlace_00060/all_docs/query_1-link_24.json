        "text": "The Oishei Foundation has always been committed to helping our community thrive. We’re proud of our work and, through our partners, believe we've made a difference. But as we look around, it’s clear that many of our neighbors—especially communities of color—still face stark inequities. So now, we are changing what we do—and how we do it—together.\n\nMoving forward, the Oishei Foundation will narrow our focus in order to broaden our impact. Specifically, we will address the root causes of racial inequity, working to change systems and build financial prosperity for a racially just region. Explore Our New Direction.\n\nThe Oishei Foundation recently engaged in a strategic planning process through which we gained an even deeper understanding of some challenging truths. We listened to diverse voices and analyzed disaggregated data that highlights racial inequities—specifically for Black people.\n\nThe inequities are clear. Black people in Buffalo earn 40% less, die 10 years sooner, and own their homes one-third less often than white people.\n\nHow can we say we’re The City of Good Neighbors when nearly 4 out of 10 Black residents live in poverty, but fewer than 1 out of 10 white people do? (sources)\n\nBuffalo is both one of the poorest and one of the most segregated cities in the country. As we continue to ask why and consider what has to change, we have reached the conclusion (as many others have) that racial inequity is rooted in systems, and is directly linked to financial well-being.\n\nFor these reasons, the Oishei Foundation will change its approach, focusing first on Buffalo’s East Side communities, and going deeper than symptoms to address the root causes and systemic barriers that perpetuate racial inequity and deny Black people the opportunity to build financial stability that leads to generational wealth.\n\nThe region’s resurgence will only be complete when everyone is included.\n\nMoving forward together, everything we do will be measured by the progress made toward shared financial prosperity for a racially just region.\n\nWe will transition all grantmaking, support, and services to align with our new strategic focus.\n\nWe will share our power with communities, so they can lead.\n\nWe will listen more, learn more, and act more.\n\nTogether, we will build a foundation for racial equity—a foundation for a better Buffalo.\n\nWhile we are committed to this new direction, we are also are acutely aware that this change may present specific challenges for many of our grantees and partners.\n\nWe are pausing grantmaking as we take time to listen and learn with East Side communities and determine and develop the specifics of our future work. We are enacting a thoughtful transition plan that provides time for partners who rely on us for significant support to adjust. We are also evaluating our philanthropic support programs, using this new direction as a guide.\n\nThese decisions are made with careful consideration to the very valuable work of so many organizations that are deeply committed to advancing racial equity.\n\nAt this time, we are not accepting new grant requests, and organizations that have a current or pending grant with the Foundation, including those who have been awarded transition grants, can access the portal and submit requested information.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding grants, reporting, or the portal, please contact Natalie Cook, Grants Administrator at ncook@oishei.org.\n\nOrganizations that have a current grant with the Foundation can access the Expenditure Report Template to accompany interim or final reports.\n\nFor reference, the Foundation’s General Terms and Conditions for all grants can be found here.\n\nThe Oishei Foundation will invest the time, working with and within East Side communities to listen and learn, and to ensure that our shared path forward directly reflects the community’s vision of progress.\n\nThe individuals within these communities will guide our actions—because we believe that those closest to issues and with lived experience hold the keys to possible solutions.\n\nWe will engage in our own continuous learning—from the community, experts, fellow funders, and others—to set priorities and begin implementation. And we will learn what works, and what doesn’t, and adjust our approach as needed to advance racial equity."
