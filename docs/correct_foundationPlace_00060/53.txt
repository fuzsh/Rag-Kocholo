CLUB HOSTS MEET & GREET - JAN 9, 2024

Thanks to all the wonderful "New Friends" who came out to our Meet & Greet event on Jan 9th. We were happy to meet you and socialize with you - after we danced between the torrential rain drops to get into North Penn Commons!A fun evening of games, wine & cheese... and telling the Rotary story to prospective new members!

Prospective New Members learned a little about who we are & what we do as a Rotary Club, like supporting numerous charities here in the North Penn area; and around the world!

At our Tuesday Nov 14th meeting, we were honored to have Robert Gallagher, CEO of the North Penn YMCA give a presentation as our guest speaker. Bob has dedicated his adult life to community service and the well-being of others. His long-standing tenure with the North Penn YMCA certainly fits this role. Bob informed our Club that the YMCA will be building a new state of the art gymnasium and expanded Wellness Center at their North Penn Commons location. Their large membership enjoys the many amenities at the local branch including a beautiful Olympic size pool enjoyed by all ages, exercise rooms & classes as well as a new "EZone" featuring virtual sports, golf simulators & gaming (very cool!!) Nationwide, the YMCA is the largest child care provider and the facility at the North Penn branch is top notch! Did you know that both basketball and volleyball were invented at the YMCA? The North Penn YMCA's charitability in the community is over a half million dollars! Thank you, Bob, and your team of dedicated employees & volunteers for your commitment to the North Penn community, and for making the North Penn YMCA a place where all feel welcomed while putting our health and wellness in the forefront.

CLUB VISITS EASTERSEALS

District Grant fulfilment of Eye Gaze Equipment

Aug 29th, 2023 - - North Penn club members were treated to a wonderful tour of the Easterseals of Southeastern Pennsylvania school located in Kulpsville (Lansdale). We got to see first hand the fabulous facility and meet the wonderful staff. Easterseals provides a wide variety of services to children with disabilities - their caring & compassion is unparalleled! Our club, with the help of a Rotary District grant, provided the school with Skylar Eye Gaze equipment which helps teach non verbal children to speak with their eyes! Truly amazing! We cherish the long history Rotary has with Easterseals, and our North Penn Club is proud & honored to provide this essential equipment to the local Easterseals school this year.

The Date Is Set for the Annual 4-Way Test Speech Contest

Annually, our club hosts this special speech contest; open to local high school students who write and present a persuasive 5-7 minute speech that answers these four questions:

FIRST, is it the Truth?

SECOND, is it Fair to all concerned?

THIRD, will it build Good Will and Better Friendships?

FOURTH, will it be Beneficial to all concerned?

The Four Way Test is used by Rotarians world-wide as a moral code for personal and business relationships.

The test can be applied to almost any aspect of life.

Over the years, we have heard from amazing students who speak on a variety of interesting topics; from environmental issues and healthcare to economic development and social pressures.

This year's contest will be held on March 28th and we are looking forward to hearing from the students.

Cash prize scholarships are awarded to the 1st, 2nd & 3rd place winners! Interested students should contact their school's administration for details on applying to participate in the contest.

Easterseals of Montgomery County Receives Grant from North Penn Rotary Club

The Club was proud to give a grant to Easterseals of Montgomery County with the help from Rotary District 7430 Grant funds this year. Our club supplied the local EasterSeals school with a much needed commercial lamination machine and supplies. The children in Easterseals' programs have disabilities and/or behavioral challenges, which means that teaching materials can be easily ripped or destroyed. Picture exchange communication systems (PECS), are a particularly impactful tool at Easterseals. Pictures of objects with the word underneath are used to support children who are nonverbal. With the use of this new commercial laminator, the Easterseals staff and teachers can now create visual aids, worksheets, and classroom materials once and preserve them for use for the entire school year and beyond. Laminated materials can be written on and wiped clean for reuse; thus eliminating the need to print materials again and again.

Rotary and Easterseals have a legacy partnership that spans over a century! From the beginning, Rotary International and Easterseals have been together. Paul Harris, founder of Rotary International, and Edgar Allen, founder of Easterseals, shared a friendship and passion for service and volunteerism to improve communities worldwide. Rotarian Edgar Allen founded a hospital in Elyria, Ohio after his son's death in a streetcar accident in May 1907. Soon after, Allen dedicated his life to creating community-based services for children with disabilities, recruiting Rotarians to create a network of programs that would become Easterseals.

As part of the celebration for the sesquicentennial anniversary of the borough of Lansdale, the Rotary Club of North Penn members participated in a parade that kicked off 'Founder's Week" in the borough. We had a great time walking the length of Main Street, passing out candy to the children and Rotary information to the adults. President Stanley Hunt drove the decorated car and members walked alongside with smiles and waves to the thousands that attended!

Weather looks spectacular - so we are a GO for the 45th Annual

LANSDALE DAY ARTS & CRAFTS FESTIVAL

10am - 4pm Main Street, Lansdale

4-Way Test Speech Contest held on MARCH 22, 2022

On Tuesday March 22nd, we were honored to host this year's 4-Way Test Speech Contest and are so very proud of the students that participated! We heard amazing persuasive speeches that included topics about healthcare coverage, abortion and implicit bias - all answering the questions: Is it the Truth? Is it Fair to All Concerned? Will it build Good Will & Better Friendships? and Will it be Beneficial to All Concerned? These questions serve as the ethical code by which all Rotarians try to live their personal and professional lives. CONGRATULATIONS to our three student winners, all hailing from Lansdale Catholic High School - Archdiocese of Philadelphia : Sarah Grosch (1st place), Sarah Fernandez (2nd place) & Shane Rodowicz (3rd place). All students won a cash scholarship from our Rotary Club and the first place winner will go on to compete in the Regional contest next month for a chance at more cash scholarships! We wish all of these students the very best in their future plans!

A HUGE thank you to all of our judges, volunteers, 4-Way Test Speech contest committee Rotarians (Kristin York & Leon Silver), faculty, parents, familial support and invited special guests! A nod of gratitude also to Stove and Tap restaurant for the fabulous food & excellent service!

WELCOME STANLEY!

June 30, 2020: As our Rotary year comes to a close, we gathered (via social distancing) to thank our Club President, Les Fowler, for his unwavering leadership this past year! We were able to give more than $25,000 to those in need and we stand with this great community! We also welcomed our in-coming Club President, Tom Clifford, as he will take the reigns on July 1st. We look forward to Tom's leadership this coming year! This ceremony took place at Whites Road Park, at the Bandshell that our Rotary Club of North Penn gifted to Lansdale back in 2007, celebrating Rotary's 100's anniversary.

Tom is a local professional CPA who has visited our club for the past several weeks and we are thrilled to have him officially on our roster!

Rotary International President, Barry Rassinâs, theme for 2018-19, Be the Inspiration, asks Rotarians to inspire change in the world and in each other. âI ask all of you to Be the Inspiration to help Rotary move from reaction to action â to take a hard look at the environmental issues that affect health and welfare around the world and do what we can to help.â

A challenge to all Rotarians, across this great planet Earth we call home, to make a difference by being an inspiration to others. The North Penn Rotary Club is ready and willing to take on this challenge and do what we can to make our world a better place, both at home and abroad. We look forward to this coming year and will continue to support numerous non-profit and charitable organizations right here in our own back yard.

Interact Speakers

For our weekly meeting Tuesday Dec. 12th 2017 we were privileged to have Tom Quintois and his three new members from the Lansdale Catholic Interact club describe their first projects. Jack Crotty, Taylor Connelly, and Kira Sullivanâs projects were wonderfully described in last weekâs newsletter by our own Super Doc.

As a relatively new member to Rotary I was interested to know more about these clubs that provide young community leaders an introduction to Rotary and our ideals. Interact is for people ages 12-18 to develop leadership skills while discovering the power of Service Above Self (511,796 members in 22,252 clubs). After Interact, Rotaract is for those ages 18-30 to exchange ideas with leaders in the community, develop leadership and professional skills, and have fun through service (242,949 members in 10,563 clubs). There is also the Rotary Community Corps (RCCS) that plan and carry out projects in their communities and support local Rotary club projects but are not members of a Rotary club (210,500 members in 9,900 corps).

These clubs are a wonderful opportunity for our young community leaders to hone their skills, network, meet new friends, and hopefully live a fulfilled life within the Rotary community.

Breaking bread with the Valley Forge Tourism and Convention board (VFTCB)

For Service Tuesday at Manna on Main Street Chris, Kris, Mohana, Sam, Tammy, Virginia and Will helped to serve a gourmet meal provided by the Valley Forge Tourism and Convention board (VFTCB). This is the second year the VFTCB has taken over the kitchen at Manna, the kitchen was commanded by President & CEO Mike Bowman (a chef in a prior life) while his team worked with the Rotary and Manna teams in the front of the house (excluding Will who manned the dishwashing station â a man who is not afraid to get his hands dirty). The guests were thrilled with the three coarse meal: house salad, grilled chicken breast on a bed of mixed veggies and a side of roasted potatoes, finished with apple crumble and ice cream. After the guests retired we joined the VFTCB team for an amazing meal and fellowship.

VFTCB is also in their third year of their food drive, a gift to Pope Francis when he visited the Montgomery area â what else can you give someone that chose Francis as his papal name?

District Governor Richard Gromis speaks at our Club

Our Rotary Club of North Penn club was honored by the District Governor Richard Gromis and his wife (and fellow Rotarian) Sue being our guest speaker at our July 18th dinner. Please read Kristin Yorkâs excellent newsletter that describes the visit. Through Rotarian communications DG Rickâs emphasizes the importance of long-term strategic planning to prevent âClub Driftâ as leadership annually changes, âmajor goals for the 2017-2018 Rotary year is to strongly encourage each club to draft, resurrect, or revise a strategic plan for its clubâ. Rick also states that ââ¦as always, we will be concentrating on membership, but we will be also focused on retention. Our goal is to start one new club this year and a net increase of one new member in every club.â Rick also plans to appoint a Public Image Chairperson with a primary focus on social media, âThe District and our clubs need to have an effective social media presence.â

Thank you, Scott - Congratulations President Bob

On Tuesday, June 27th, we met to thank President Scott Grande for this past year of service to our Club and to Rotary. We accomplished so much and had a great president at the helm! We now welcome and congratulate incoming President Bob Kile who shared his vision for the upcoming Rotary year. We look forward to another great year with another great president to lead us as we strive to Make A Difference!

SERVICE ABOVE SELF AT MANNA ON MAIN STREET

At the 1917 Rotary International Convention, outgoing Rotary president Arch Klumph proposed setting up an endowment âfor the purpose of doing good in the world.â That one idea, and an initial contribution of $25.50 set in motion a powerful force that has transformed millions of lives around the globe. Today, the Rotary Foundation has grown exponentially because of the very generous, service minded Rotarians around the world who give willingly and unselfishly so that funds through grants which provide sustainable service projects are given to those in need - world wide!

ROTARIANS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD! At a local celebration on March 11, 2017, our Rotary District 7430 held a 100th Anniversary Gala where Rotarians from all over Eastern PA gathered to celebrate our Foundation's milestone. The evening was filled with fun, fellowship and, of course, more self-less giving to our amazing Foundation! Among those attending were our very own from the North Penn Club: Rotarian Tony Jannetta and his beautiful wife, Rachel were honored by District Governor, Linda Young and the entire room of Rotarians as Tony & Rachel have pledged to be Arch Klumph Society members, donating $250,000 to the Rotary International Foundation. Tony & Rachel have supported the works of Rotary and it's Foundation for numerous years and continue to put âService Above Selfâ every single day! Thank you, Tony & Rachel for your dedication to the Rotary Foundation and your hearts of gold so that others, less fortunate than yourselves, may benefit from your generosity to the Rotary Foundation.

Also in attendance from North Penn was Rotarian Michael Seidner and his lovely wife, Stephanie. Mike & Stephanie have been long-time supporters of the Rotary Foundation, are multiple Paul Harris Fellows and also Paul Harris Society members. Thank you, Mike & Stephanie for your continued, generous support of the Rotary Foundation.
