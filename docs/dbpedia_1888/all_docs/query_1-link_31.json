        "text": "18 months ago, our team did an exercise where each of us wrote down “what ‘wildly successful’ would look like at the end of 2023”. What a fun exercise! For the past 18 months, I’ve had those cards hanging in my office. This month, in our December “Team Meeting of the Minds”, we pulled those cards down and reviewed them together. Keep in mind, when we wrote these, we had no fear, we were dreaming big! I’m happy to report that we reached (and in come cases far exceeded) 50% of those goals. Sure, we had some misses (a nacho cheese machine in the office was one), but it was so incredible to look back and see how far we’ve come. The RDS Team is extremely grateful for our partners and everything you’ve done to contribute to our success. Our team is focused on the “Recreational Space”: RV, Marine, and Powersports. These industries are down significantly in 2023. However, due to your partnerships, RDS had a record year in 2023! I’m incredibly proud of the RDS Team for the contributions they’ve individually made and continue to make. Here are 3 quick highlights from 2023: 1. Year over year revenue growth * Mentioned above – there aren’t many teams in our industry that are up YOY. 2. Industry Training Experts * Our online platform, RDS-U continues to grow and add value to our partners across the country. * Our opportunities within the industry continue to grow. This year we had features in industry publications, RVDA Convention sessions in Vegas, and an education session at the MRAA Convention in Tampa. * Dom has done a phenomenal job leading our F&I Masterclasses. We hosted Masterclasses in 3 states this year with a record number of participants. Most importantly, the participants are delivering results! 3. RDS Team growth * Our team has grown significantly; we’re approaching 20 people on the RDS team to serve you better. We’re grateful for our growth, but we’re not satisfied. In 2024, we’re committed to relentlessly growing and improving, personally and professionally. We will be a better partner 12 months from now than we are today. Look out 2024! #relentless #leadership #marine #rv\n\nReflecting on Our Journey: A Year of Growth and Unity at HLB Puerto Rico 🌟 As we bid farewell to an incredible year, HLB Puerto Rico is proud to share a special video that captures the essence of our journey together. This recap isn't just about the moments we've shared; it's a tribute to the values that define us. 🌟 Leadership- Our journey was steered by the inspiring leadership within every team member. It’s their vision and guidance that illuminated our path towards success. ❤️ Passion- The passion that drives us is palpable in every project we undertake, every challenge we overcome, and every innovation we introduce. 🌈 Happiness- From spontaneous celebrations to the fulfillment of achieving our goals, happiness has been the cornerstone of our workplace culture. 🎨 Creativity- Our team's creativity has been a beacon of innovation, pushing us to explore new ideas and solutions. 🙏 Gratitude- We are immensely grateful for the dedication, hard work, and spirit of every individual who calls HLB Puerto Rico home. 🤝 Kindness- Kindness has been our compass, guiding us to support each other and our community with empathy and understanding. 🔗 Unity- The unity among our team members has been our strength, enabling us to achieve more together than we ever could apart. 🚀 Success- This year has been marked by numerous successes, each one a testament to our collective effort and determination. 🌱 Growth- Together, we have grown, not just in numbers or achievements, but in our knowledge, skills, and relationships. Together we make it happen is not just a phrase; it's our reality. Every laugh shared, every milestone achieved, and every challenge faced has brought us closer and made us stronger. As we look towards the horizon, ready to embrace what 2024 has in store, we do so as a united, passionate, and determined family. Join us in celebrating our journey and the endless possibilities that lie ahead. #HLBPuertoRicoLLC #Teamwork #Growth #Unity #Leadership #Passion #Success\n\nLet’s celebrate Project X Member Dr A (name deidentified for privacy)who has totally transformed their Practice and life. When we first met Dr A, the grind was REAL. Clocking up long hours, stressed from squeezing in admin after clinical work and over weekends, Dr A also felt that their team should be performing way better. The level of hustle just wasn't translating into the rewards or life quality Dr A had envisioned when starting the Practice 7 years before. Sound familiar? But Dr A was determined to change this, and applied the following key frameworks: 🔹Created Role Clarity: they realised that having the right people doing the right things was critical for success 🔹Implemented Leadership Toolbox 🛠️: Fostered a culture of accountability so that everyone in the team stepped up their game. 🔹Nailed Resource Allocation: By smartly distributing resources and leveraging internal and external support, productivity soared. Fast forward 19 months: Dr A now works 3 clinical days, dedicates a full day to focus 'on the business,' and, get this, enjoys 3 full days off! The practice runs smoothly even when Dr A isn't there. The kicker? Earnings went up by 24% (actually 24.3%) whilst working 33% less! 💪 Wondering how you could create a similar transformation? Comment \"BRAINSTORM\" below, and let’s map out a plan to get you there! 🙌\n\nI saw some long-time friends at the AORN Leadership meeting.... and made a new one (Melanie Perry) or two. My takeaways from the meeting? ✔️OR nursing leadership recognizes change is needed. ✔️Lots of burnout among staff. ✔️Losing staff to the \"Silver Tsunami\" (Good Company Consulting thanks for the term!) ✔️Enormous caseload (my \"Surgical Tsunami\") ✔️✔️✔️✔️Increasingly burdened with administrative and training duties (of all the new staff) One leader told me: \"I don't have 5 minutes to myself without some surgeon knocking on my door or 1000 emails\" Good news? ✅Lots of openness to new ways of looking at Leadership, AI, technology etc.... All of which, hopefully, leads to nurses working at the top of their license. 🤞Because the old way of thinking (hire more people, take on more work selflessly, just hire travelers, stay late, \"we'll make it work\")... Doesn't work anymore. Hank Balch Alex VanOeveren Francis Iula Maya Ber Lerner Rebecca Urban M.Ed #sterileprocessing #medicaldevices #aorn #aorn2024"
