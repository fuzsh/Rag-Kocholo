        "text": "Art√©Vize Expo (AVEX) held its inaugural event in February 18, 2023 at the Calabanga Museum. The AVEX organizers took inspiration from Bicol art bazaars and small press expos, NagaZine and BLTX, which included arts and crafts sales with an open mic for musicians, book authors and poetry readers, with attendees from Naga, Albay, Iriga, Bombon, and others.\n\nThe event was conceived to support home grown independent artists and art collectives who started out in Naga and other parts of Bicol and enable them to flourish within the town of Calabanga. The aim is for AVEX to become a hub and incubator for fellow Calabangue√±o artists, empowering them to develop their own artistic personality and brand, as well as to network with other fellow artists and art enthusiasts all over Bicol.\n\nTo broaden its reach and diversity, AVEX partnered with the Central Bicol State University-Calabanga (PINTADOS and The Writers‚Äô Project), Ateneo de Naga University (ADNU SHS Writers‚Äô Guild, Ateneo Literary Association), Calabanga‚Äôs LGU and Municipal Tourism offices and the town‚Äôs very own, the Do-Lot Art Group. The organizers executed a marketing campaign to promote the expo and encourage attendance which included creating flyers and social media posts, reaching out to local media outlets, and leveraging the members‚Äô personal and social networks to spread the word.\n\nThe expo which ran from 1pm to 9pm was supported by 4 food concessionaires, all local businesses from area. Unfortunately, rain poured from morning to nighttime during the course of the event. But this did not dampen the spirits and enthusiasm of the exhibitors, attendees and guests. Local artist and AVEX advocate Paul Bordado performed 3 songs including his very own ‚ÄúPahinga.‚Äù Calabanga Mayor, Eugene Norman Severo came in the afternoon and mingled with the participants. Food and sound system were provided by the LGU which was a big help. AVEX stickers and keychains were handed out as gift to the exhibitors.\n\nAVEX will continue supporting local independent artists as the organizers prepare and pitch for the next big expo event. For now, its core group will form itself into the AVEX Collective.\n\nThe organizers behind AVEX are: ArtMerk, Maebi, and Ref3Renz.\n\nArtMerk (Merk Hamet Bordado), Head Organizer, is a Calabangue√±o traditional and digital artist. He is studying Digital Illustration and Animation in Ateneo and has worked as a graphic designer and layout artist. He is the president of the Estƒìtiko Ateneo (formerly the Ateneo Design and Arts Society) since 2018. He enjoys attending art fairs and conventions. His traditional art medium choices are mixed media, graphite, charcoal, watercolor, ink, acrylic, and oil paint. He also loves surrealism and poetry. He is an advocate of Bicol Arts and Literature and hopes to see the Bicol art community grow and thrive. His goal for AVEX is to bring Bicol artists, writers, and creatives alike closer and more connected.\n\nMaebi (Maybelle Escaro), co-organizer, is a 3D artist and illustrator. ‚ÄúI create art that are intimate and intense. Reds and blacks. Eyes and hearts. Life and not.‚Äù\n\nRef3Renz (Renz Gacer) is a versatile 3D digital artist and a jack of all trades from Calabanga. With a passion for all things 3D, he has honed his skills in 3D printing, VR modeling, laser cutting, and motion graphics animation. His broad range of expertise has allowed him to bring a unique perspective to each work. He also utilizes the latest tools and techniques to bring his imaginative ideas to life. With a strong understanding of cutting-edge software and hardware, he can create quality digital artworks.\n\nAbout the Calabanga Museum, the event venue: since opening its doors to the public, it has become a popular landmark in the area, providing visitors with a glimpse into the rich cultural heritage that makes this town unique. With engaging exhibits from artifacts to contemporary art, the museum is a must-visit destination for those interested in exploring the rich heritage of the community. The museum is much more than a venue to see displays; it is also a center for innovation, learning, and participation in the local community. Visitors wishing to immerse themselves in Calabanga‚Äôs thriving arts and cultural scene will find a wealth of opportunities at the museum, which hosts everything from tourism and arts workshops to exciting exhibits and other events.\n\nThe AVEX Exhibitors\n\nLiterary Organizations and Writers\n\nAteneo SHS Writers Guild, an association formed through a shared love for literature and writing.\n\nThe Writers Group (TWP), a cultural organization in CBSUA-Calabanga established in 2016. It has organized writers‚Äô workshop, published DIY publications, and produced award-winning writers. For this academic year, it seeks to hone the young student-writers to develop their creativity and their love for language and literature. In 2016, TWP joined the BLTX where they sold their works including Mga Paghapit by Edwin Breva, Sais by Abegail Sta. Ana, Padangat by Jerome Hipolito, Tipasi by John Chris Pineda and Tagulyab, the organization‚Äôs folio.\n\nThe Ateneo Literary Association, an organization of readers and writers who seek to strengthen the literary scene in the university and the Bicol Region. Featured members are: Alalasu (also a graphic designer), Kyle Garcia, Bea Doma.\n\nDennis B. Gonzaga, a cultural worker from the City of Naga. He is now currently based in Goa, Camarines Sur, where he serves as the Press Director for the Partido State University and Research Associate for the Museo de Isarog. He is the owner and curator of The 416 Art Space, an independent hole-in-the wall art gallery located at Bagumbayan Sur, Naga City. He previously served as the Chairperson of the Social Sciences Department of the Ateneo de Naga University, where he also taught Art Appreciation, and Humanities for nearly two decades.\n\nGonzaga launched and promoted his new book, An Santero nin Santo Entierro, a Bikol-language novel in epic poetry format. It is divided into ten chapters which chronicle the mortal and spiritual conflict of the epynomous Santero, a sculptor who specializes in religious artifacts. Beneath the fictional surface of the work is an undercurrent of critique on colonialism, mythopoesis, existentialism, nihilism, and morality. Published by Kabulig Bikol, Inc., with the invaluable support of the Bikol Historical Research Center, ‚ÄúAn Santero Kan Santero Entierro‚Äù is intended to be the first part of a planned trilogy.\n\nRandom Pics at the AVEX"
