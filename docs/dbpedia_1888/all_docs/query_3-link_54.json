YOGAD Background\n\n The word 'Yoga' is derived from the Sanskrit root 'Yuj', meaning 'to join' or 'to yoke' or 'to unite'.

It is made from a rattan frame, decorated with brass wire, and red yarn and shells.  Bugkalot Beads & Accessories are handcrafted by Bugkalots themselves. Each glass bead, tassel, and mother of pearl trimmed are weaved together with delicate wiring or a specific weaving technique. Procuring these accessories is critical to supporting the people of Nagtipunan; even a small purchase can contribute to cultural preservation and elevate the spirits of our Bugkalot kailyans in preserving their tradition alive for future generations.\n\nNorthern Central and Southern Luzon\n\nPeoples of the Philippines: Negrito Like the Manobo, the Negrito groups of the Philippines constitute one of the most complex populations in terms of dispersal. There are two major branches which made their appearance in the Philippine archipelago between 30,000 to 20,000 years ago: one moving on the eastern flank of the Philippines going up to the north to the Pacific side of the Sierra Madre mountains constituting the Alta, Arta, and Agta groups; the second branch moved along the western side, similarly going up northern Luzon which now includes the Pinatubo Negrito. Other corresponding major subgroupings are the Dumagat, Ata, Ati, Atta, Sinauna, and Batak. The people are characterized by shortness of stature, darkness of pigmentation, and kinky hair. All of the Negrito groups speak languages that are dialects of the major adjacent peoples. They are now widely distributed and found in highland areas or places that are difficult to access: the Pacific side of northern Luzon to the Bicol peninsula, the northern tip of the Cordillera mountains, the Zambales ranges and the Bataan peninsula, Bondoc peninsula, and the islands of Negros, Panay, and Palawan. There are at least 25 groupings, with a highly tentative national population count of 766 (NM 1994). Although basically hunters and gatherers, being the most proficient in the use of the bow and arrow, they also practice minimal horticulture in small patches. They are known to have developed patron-client relationships with adjacent groups for trade and food procurement. The social groupings are small bands that have fluid membership based on bilateral kinship.\n\nArt A traditional form of visual art is body scarification. The Aetas intentionally wound the skin on their back, arms, breast, legs, hands, calves and abdomen, and then they irritate the wounds with fire, lime and other means to form scars. Other \"decorative disfigurements\" include the chipping of the teeth. With the use of a file, the Dumagat modify their teeth during late puberty. The teeth are dyed black a few years afterwards. The Aetas generally use ornaments typical of people living in subsistence economies. Flowers and leaves are used as earplugs for certain occasions. Girdles, necklaces, and neckbands of braided rattan incorporated with wild pig bristles are frequently worn.\n\nTraditional political organization While the father is normally the figurehead of the family, Aeta communities or bands traditionally had an anarchic political structure wherein they don't have appointed chiefs to exercise authority over them. Individual Aeta is on equal grounds with the other and their main course of social interaction is through their tradition. It's also the tradition, and not constituted laws, that maintain the equality among them and guide their way of life. They do have groups of elders in their community, called pisen, who they tend to go to when it comes to arbitrating decisions. However, the decisions made by the elders only remain in advisory capacity and no one could force any individual to follow those decisions. Their guiding principle and conflict resolution is through a sustained deliberation. Over time, this egalitarian political structure was disturbed due to recurring contacts with the lowland Filipinos wherein the local officials and individuals they interact with forced Aeta communities to create government structure resembling those in the lowlands. At times, Aeta communities do organize themselves in government-like system with a Capitan (Captain), Conseyal (Council) and Policia (Police). But mostly, they resist such imposed organization. In particular, they refuse to appoint a chief (or a president) that will govern them although they do have one elder that takes the responsibility of leadership. This informal kind of government can also be found in their judicial process. When someone in their community did something wrong, they would deliberate about it but more importantly, they don't talk about what kind of punishment they will hand to the wrong-doer but instead the deliberation is about understanding the motivation behind the action and prevent the consequence of the action from developing into something worse. Young men and women are excluded from the deliberation process. In this particular case, women are also largely excluded from the deliberation process even when they are allowed to attend the hearing or even when sometimes they can make their opinion about the problem. For the most part, women are not given room within the decision making process because the Aeta communities also follow a strict gender role were women are mostly expected take care of the children and the husband.\n\nCULTURE a traditional form of visual art is body scarification.

Other Information The Cordillera mountain range, which feature the island's north-central section, is covered in a mixture of tropical pine forests and montane rainforests, and is the site of the island's highest mountain, Mount Pulag, rising at 2, metres. The range provides the upland headwaters of the Agno River, which stretches from the slopes of Mount Data, and meanders along the southern Cordillera mountains before reaching the plains of Pangasinan.\n\nThe northeastern section of Luzon is generally mountainous, with the Sierra Madre, the longest mountain range in the country, abruptly rising a few miles from the coastline. Located in between the Sierra Madre and the Cordillera Central mountain ranges is the large Cagayan Valley. This region, which is known for being the second largest\n\nspoken dialect in the region, used by people from Pampanga and Tarlac. Ilocano, the third most dominant dialect in the region, is spoken in the provinces of Zambales, northern Tarlac and northern Nueva Ecija which are close to the Ilocano-speaking provinces of Pangasinan and the Cordilleras. Among the region’s festivities, celebrations and religious sites, the most prominent include the Carabao Festival and Obando Fertlity Rites in Bulacan; the Giant Lantern Festival and Lenten Rites in Pampanga; and the Mango Festival in Zambales. Central Lzuon is also noted for products such as furniture, Christmas lanterns, jewelry, marble products, meat products and sweets and delicacies. Centuries-old churches, ancestral houses, as well as historical monuments serve as landmarks that depict the rich cultural heritage of the region.\n\nSOUTHERN LUZON\n\nLocation\n\nBackground The northern section of Southern Luzon is dominated by the Laguna de Bay (Old Spanish, \"Lake of Bay town\"), the largest lake in the country. The 949-square-kilometre (366 sq mi) lake is drained into Manila Bay by the Pasig River, one of the most important rivers in the country due to its historical significance and because it runs through the center of Metro Manila. Other Information Located 20 kilometres (12 mi) southwest of Laguna de Bay is Taal Lake, a crater lake containing the Taal Volcano, the smallest in the country. The environs of the lake form the upland Tagaytay Ridge, which was once part of a massive prehistoric volcano that covered the southern portion of the province of Cavite, Tagaytay and the whole of Batangas province. South of Laguna Lake are two solitary mountains, Mount Makiling in Laguna province, and Mount Banahaw, the highest in the region of Calabarzon. The southeastern portion of Luzon is dominated by the Bicol Peninsula, a mountainous and narrow region extending approximately 150 kilometres (93 mi) southeast from the Tayabas Isthmus in Quezon province to the San Bernardino Strait along the coasts of Sorsogon. The area is home to several volcanoes, the most famous of which is the 2,460-metre (8,070 ft) high symmetrically shaped Mayon Volcano in Albay province. The Sierra Madre range has its southern limits at Quezon province. Ultra- prominent mountains dot the landscape, which include Mount Isarog and Mount Iriga in Camarines Sur, and Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon. The peninsula's coastline features several smaller peninsulas, gulfs and bays, which include Lamon Bay, San Miguel Bay, Lagonoy Gulf, Ragay Gulf, and Sorsogon Bay.\n\nCulture and Traditions/ Artifacts Indigenous Crafts/Products The literary tradition in the Tagalog regions specially outstanding in the field of oral literature like bugtong(riddle), proverbs, native songs. These oral literatures are always in poetic forms, usually seven- syllabic rhymes, so Asian in form and perspective. Tagalog literature has been born, cradled, nourished\n\nand peaked into fruition in the provinces of Southern Luzon, Central Luzon and the present Metropolitan Manila or the National Capital Region. Tagalog region is the birthplace of a rich tradition of Philippine culture in language, politics, economy and literature.\n\nVISAYAS\n\nVisayas is known for what?\n\nThe Visayas is known for fresh mangoes, scenic drives, frequent bus services by companies such as Ceres Liners.
