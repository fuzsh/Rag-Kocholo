THE BUDGET CYCLE Four Phases in Managing the National Budget:  Budget Preparation  Budget Legislation  Budget Execution  Budget Accountability During the preparation phase, the Executive prepares the proposed National Budget. This is followed by the legislation phase where the Congress authorize the General Appropriations Act. In the execution phase, agencies utilize their approved budgets and during the accountability phase the executive phase, agencies utilize their approved, the executive monitor and evaluate the use of the budget.\n\n4. 1. BUDGET PREPARATION THIS STARTS WITH THE BUDGET CALL AND ENDS WITH THE PRESIDENT’S SUBMISSION OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET TO CONGRESS.\n\n5. BUDGET PREPARATION 1. The Budget Call At the beginning of the budget preparation year, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) issues the National Budget Call to all agencies (including state universities and colleges) and a separate Corporate Budget Call to all GOCCs and GFIs. The budget Call contains budget parameters (including macroeconomic and fiscal and agency budget ceilings) as set beforehand by the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC); and policy guidelines and procedures in the preparation and submission of agency budget proposals. 2. Stakeholder Engagement A new feature in budget preparation which seeks to increase citizen participation in the budget process, departments and agencies are tasked to partner with civil society organizations (CSOs) and other citizen-stakeholders as they prepare their agency budget proposals.\n\n6. BUDGET PREPARATION This new process, which was piloted in the preparations of the 2012 National Budget, is now being expanded towards institutionalizations. Department and GOCCs Mandated to Conduct CSO Consultation\n\n7. BUDGET PREPARATION “Bottom-Up” Budgeting The Bottom-up Budgeting program was set-up in 2013 to help the Philippines to help the Philippines attain its Millennium Development Goals of inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Now, two years later, the Department of Budget and Management is holding a two-day summit to show how far the project has come. The Aquino government, through the Cabinet Cluster on Human Development and Poverty Reduction. Two years after Bottom-up Budgeting (BuB) was first implemented in the 2013 National Budget, the Aquino Administration plans to extend the program’s reach and ensure the sustainability of BuB-enabled gains, beginning with a twoday summit to assess and reaffirm the program’s progress. Under the 2015 budget, BuB covers 1,590 municipalities and cities across the country, and is amply supported with a budget of P20.9 billion. For 2016, the Administration is proposing a budget of P24.7 billion to support the implementation of more than 14,300 BuB projects nationwide.\n\n8. BUDGET PREPARATION ““The BuB is meant to empower our grassroots communities and their respective local governments. That’s why we’ve made improvements to the program by allowing LGUs to directly implement projects instead of coursing them through the agencies. This also strengthens the link of accountability between our LGUs and their constituents,” the budget chief said. The BuB approach was set up to help the Philippines attain its Millennium Development Goals of inclusive growth and poverty reduction, all while promoting good governance at the local level. This is done by increasing citizens’ access to local service delivery via a demand-driven budget planning process.\n\n9. BUDGET PREPARATION Program Expenditure Classification (PREXC): This approached is adopt by President Duterte Administration. a reform that restructures the current Budget by grouping activities and projects under major programs or key strategies. Through this innovation, the government will be able to assign performance targets—both outputs and outcomes—at the level of programs. This way, the direct link between strategies, budgets and intended results will be clearer and program monitoring and evaluation can provide evidence-based assessments PREXC was implemented in the proposed Budget for 2018.\n\n10. BUDGET PREPARATION 3. Technical Budget Hearing These are conducted after departments and agencies submit their Agency Budget Proposal to the DBM. Here, agencies defend their proposal budget before a technical panel of DBM, based on performance indicators on output targets and absorptive capacity. DBM bureaus then review the agency proposals and prepare recommendations. 4. Executive Review The recommendations are presented before an Executive Review Board which is composed of the DBM Secretary and senior officials. Deliberations here entails a careful prioritization of programs and corresponding support, vis-a vis the priority agenda of the national government. Implementation issues are also discussed and resolved.\n\n11. BUDGET PREPARATION 5. Consolidation, Validation and Confirmation DBM then consolidate the recommended agency budgets and recommendations into a National Expenditure Program and a Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing (BESF). As part of the consolidating process, the deliberations by the DBCC determine the agency and sectoral allocation of the approved total expenditure ceiling, in line with the macroeconomic and fiscal program. Heads of major departments are invited to this meeting. 6. Presentation to President and Cabinet The proposed budget is presented by DBM, together with the DBCC, to the President and Cabinet for further refinements of prioritization. After the President and Cabinet approve the proposed National Expenditure Plan, the DBM prepares and finalizes the budget documents to be submitted to Congress.\n\n12. BUDGET PREPARATION 7. The President’s Budget The budget preparations phase ends with the submission of the proposed national budget –the “President’s Budget” - to Congress. The President’s Budget consist of the following documents, which help legislators analyze the contents of the proposed budget: President’s Budget Message (PBM) This is the President explains the policy framework and priorities in the budget Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing (BESF) Mandated by the Constitution, this contains the macroeconomic assumptions, public sector context (including overviews of LGU and GOCC financial positions), breakdown of the expenditures and funding sources for fiscal year and the two previous year.\n\n13. BUDGET PREPARATION National Expenditure Program (NEP) This contain the details of spending for each department and agency by program, activity or project and is submitted in the form of a proposed General Appropriations Act. Details of Selected Programs and Projects This contains a more detailed disaggregation of key programs, projects and activities in the NEP, especially those in line with the national government’s development plan. Staffing Summary This contains a summary of the staffing complement of each department and agency, including number of positions and amounts allocated for the same.\n\n14. 2. BUDGET LEGISLATION - also called the “ Budget Authorization phase,” this starts upon the House speaker’s Receipt of the President’s Budget and ends with the President’s enactment of the General Appropriations Act (GAA).\n\n15. BUDGET LEGISLATION The House of Representative, in plenary, assigns the President’s Budget to the House Appropriations Committee. The Committee and its Sub-Committee then schedule and conduct hearing on the budgets of the departments and agencies and scrutinize their respective programs and projects. It then crafts the General Appropriations Bill (GAB). In plenary session, the GAB is sponsored, presented and defended by the Appropriations Committee and Sub Committee Chairmen. As in all other laws, the GAB is approved on Second and Third Reading before transmission to the Senate. (Note: In the First Reading, the President’s Budget is assigned to the Appropriations Committee). 1. House Deliberations As in the House process, the Senate conducts its own committee hearing and plenary deliberations on the GAB. Budget deliberations in the Senate formally start after the House of Representatives transmits the GAB. For expediency, however, the Senate Financing Committee and Sub-Committees usually start hearings on the GAB even House deliberations are ongoing. The Committee submits its proposed amendments to the GAB to plenary only after it has been formally transmitted by the House.\n\n16. BUDGET LEGISLATION 2. Senate Deliberations As in the House process, the Senate conducts its own committee hearing and plenary deliberations on the GAB. Budget deliberations in the Senate formally start after the House of Representatives transmits the GAB. For expediency, however, the Senate Finance Committee and usually start hearings on the GAB even as House deliberations are ongoing. The Committee submits its proposed amendments to the GAB to plenary only after it has been formally transmitted by the House. 3. Bicameral Deliberations Once both House of Congress have finished their deliberations, they will each constitute a panel to the Bicameral Conference Committee. This committee will then discuss and harmonize the conflicting provisions of the House and Senate Versions of the GAB. A Harmonized Version of the GAB is thus produced.\n\n17. BUDGET LEGISLATION 4. Ratification and Enrollment The Harmonized or “Bicam” Version is then submitted to both Houses, which will the vote to ratify the final GAB for submission to the President. Once submitted to the President for his approval, the GAB is considered enrolled. 5. The Veto Message The President and DBM then review the GAB and prepare a Veto Message, where budget items subjected to direct veto or conditional implementation are identified, and where general observations are made. Under the Constitution, the GAB is the only legislative measure where the President can impose a line-veto (in all other cases, a law is either approved or vetoed in full).\n\n18. BUDGET LEGISLATION 6. Reenactment When the GAA is not enacted before fiscal year starts, the previous years’s GAA is automatically reenacted. This means that agency budgets for programs, activities and projects remain the same. Funding for programs or projects that have already been terminated is realigned for other expenditures. Because reenactments are tedious and prone to abuse\n\n19. 3. BUDGET EXECUTION This is where the people’s money is actually spent. As soon as the GAA is enacted, the government can implement its priority programs and projects. 1. RELEASE GUIDELINES & PROGRAM The budget execution phase begins with DBM’s issuance of guidelines on the release and utilization of funds. 2. BUDGET EXECUTION DOCUMENTS (BEDs) Agencies are required to submit their BEDs at the start of budget execution. These documents outline agency plans and performance targets. These BEDs include the physical and financial plan, monthly cash program, estimate of monthly income, and list of obligations that are not yet due and demandable.\n\n20. BUDGET EXECUTION 3. ALLOTMENT & CASH RELEASE PROGRAMMING To ensure that releases fit the approved Fiscal Program, the DBM prepares an Allotment Release Program (ARP) to set a limit for allotments issued to an agency and on the aggregate. The ARP of each agency corresponds to the total amount of the agency-specific budget under the GAA, as well as Automatic Appropriations. A Cash Release Program (CRP) is also formulated alongside that to set a guide for disbursement levels for the year and for every month. 4. a. ALLOTMENT RELEASE Allotments, which authorize an agency to enter into an obligation, are either released by DBM to all agencies comprehensively through the Agency Budget Matrix (ABM) and individually via Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs).\n\n21. BUDGET EXECUTION 4. b. ALLOTMENT RELEASE Agency Budget Matrix (ABM) This document disaggregates all programmed appropriations for each agency into two main expenditure categories: “not needing clearance” and “needing clearance.” The ABM is the comprehensive allotment release document for appropriations which do not need clearance, or those which have already been itemized and fleshed out in the GAA.\n\n22. BUDGET EXECUTION 4. c. ALLOTMENT RELEASE Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) Items identified as “needing clearance” are those which require the approval of the DBM or the President, as the case may be (for instance, lump sum funds and confidential and intelligence funds). For such items, an agency needs to submit a Special Budget Request to the DBM with supporting documents. Once approved, a SARO is issued. 5. INCURRING OBLIGATIONS In implementing programs, activities and projects, agencies incur liabilities on behalf of the government. Obligations are liabilities legally incurred, which the government will pay for.\n\n23. BUDGET EXECUTION 6. The GAA as Allotment Release The FY 2017 budget aims to facilitate the achievement of meaningful national development goals as emphasized by the Duterte Administration. The implementation of real change is anchored on the timely and appropriate execution of this budget. In particular, the policy of using the General Appropriations Act as an Allotment Order (GAAAO) shall continue to be adopted to ensure the immediate implementation of programs, projects and activities. In so doing, resource unpredictability and delays in project/program implementation are reduced. Likewise, credibility and transparency in the budget process is expected to be further enhanced. 7. a. CASH ALLOCATION To authorize an agency to pay the obligations it incurs, DBM issues a disbursement authority. Most of the time, it takes the form of a Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA); and in special cases, the Non-Cash Availment Authority (NCAA) and Cash Disbursement Ceiling (CDC). - Source: http://www.dbm.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/Issuances/2017/National%20Budget%20Circular/NBC-567.pdf\n\n24. BUDGET EXECUTION 7. b. CASH ALLOCATION Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) This is a cash authority issued periodically by the DBM to the operating units of agencies to cover their cash requirements. The NCA specifies the maximum amount of cash that can be withdrawn from a government servicing bank for the period indicated. The release of NCAs by DBM is based on an agency’s submission of its Monthly Cash Program and other required documents.\n\n25. BUDGET EXECUTION 7. c. CASH ALLOCATION Others Disbursement Authorities. In contrast to NCAs, Non-Cash Availment Authority (NCAA) are issued to authorize non-cash disbursements. Cash Disbursement Ceiling (CDC) are meanwhile issued to departments with overseas operations, allowing them to use income collected by their foreign posts for their operating requirements. 8. DISBURSEMENT This is the final step of the budget execution phase, where government monies are actually spent. The Modified Disbursement Scheme is mostly used, where disbursements of national government agencies chargeable against the Treasury are made through government servicing banks, such as the Land Bank of the Philippines.\n\n26. BUDGET EXECUTION The budget process, of course, does not end when government agencies spend public funds: each and every peso must be accounted for to ensure that is used properly, contributing to the achievement of socioeconomic goals.\n\n27. 4. BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY This phase happens alongside the Budget Execution phase. Through Budget Accountability, the DBM monitors the efficiency of fund utilization, assesses agency performance and provides a vital basis for reforms and new policies. 1. PERFORMANCE & TARGET OUTCOMES Agencies are held accountable not only for how these use public funds ethically, but also on how these attain performance targets and outcomes using available resources. These performance measures are set alongside the preparation of the National Budget; and these are indicated in the OPIF Book of Outputs. Prior to the execution of the enacted National Budget, these performance targets are firmed up during the preparation of BEDs.\n\n28. BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY 2. BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY REPORTS (BARs) Submitted by agencies on a monthly and quarterly basis, BARs are required reports that show how agencies used their funds and identify their corresponding physical accomplishments. These include quarterly physical and financial reports of operations; quarterly income reports, a monthly statement of allotments, obligations and balances; and monthly report of disbursements. 3. NO REPORT , NO RELEASE Starting 2012, the DBM will be withholding certain fund releases to agencies if these fail to submit their Budget Accountability Reports. In particular, these will be funds from the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund (MPBF) for compensation adjustments under the Salary Standardization Law, provisions for unfilled positions and employee clothing allowances.\n\n29. BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY These funds to be withheld are only limited to agencies’ MPBF allotments so that only the agencies are penalized and that the implementation of critical programs and projects will not be disrupted. Errant and compliant agencies will also be posted online for public scrutiny. 4. REVIEW OF AGENCY PERFORMANCE The DBM regularly reviews the financial and physical performance of agencies. Actual utilization of funds and physical accomplishments, as indicated in the agencies’ BARs, are evaluated against their targets as identified via OPIF and in the agencies’ BEDs. Agency Performance Reviews (APRs) are conducted quarterly or every semester, as the case may be. An annual Budget Performance Assessment Review (BPAR) is conducted to determine each agency’s accomplishments and performance by the year-end. The DBM regularly reports results to the President\n\n30. BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY 5. AUDIT Auditing is not within the DBM’s jurisdiction, and is instead lodged under the Commission on Audit (COA). Nonetheless, auditing is critical in ensuring agency accountability in the use of public funds. The DBM uses COA’s audit reports in confirming agency performance, determining budgetary levels for agencies and addressing issues in fund usage. 6. Performance-Based Incentive System The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) is also in the process of establishing a performance based incentive system- which will recognize and reward good performance among government employees- to help improve the efficiency of service delivery across all government institutions."
