        "text": "Reflecting on an incredible work trip to Manila, Philippines! ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ So deeply appreciative of the chance to work with J&Jâ€™s Global Services organization to better understand the global workforce, assessing future capabilities, and explore the companyâ€™s entry into new areas. I truly witnessed what a strong work culture looks like, and saw almost instantly why Manila is a seminal and central talent hub in Asia for global shared services and beyond. A special thank you to Ginelle Julien-Jackson, who showed me a few things in the brief time I supported her as she moves on to her next chapter. One seminal lesson in traveling with her was the importance of giving time to her people, listening and truly learning from them rather than the other way around. Youâ€™re a gem for your passion to help others, and look forward to seeing you soar as a female powerhouse in J&J. Iâ€™m sure the entire team is grateful for this last experience with you! And still looking forward to supporting a wonderful team @Matt Barnett Marvin Johnson Holly Erdelac Sharron Ravalo Deanna Wright Ping Chao Becky Brown (who did an incredible job shaping agenda)! A special thank you to my global family members Ana Araki and Jose Enrique (Jory) Jimenez. Thank you and I appreciate the time we spent together! And so grateful to finally see my old Employee and Labor Relations team after I had to cancel my March 2020 trip from something called COVID! Neil Reymond Domingo - thank you for showing me so many facets of your beautiful country, including time with Charmaine Ibarreta. To all the people I met, I hope to continue to work with the teams in a productive and meaningful way after knowing more about your culture and rich history, and how you operate as a connected people! There is always more to learn and grow, and I look forward to this journey!"
