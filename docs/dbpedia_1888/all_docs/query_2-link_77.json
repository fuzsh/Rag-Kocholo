The parking is located in the Matzada parking lot, very close to the center. Bera is a charming town located in the Cinco Villas region, in the Foral Community of Navarra, between the Bidasoa river and the Zía regatta. Its historic center is worth a visit for its examples of 18th century architecture with beautiful buildings such as the Itzea house, residence of the Baroja family, where Carmen, Pio and Ricardo Baroja developed much of their work. Another attraction worth visiting is the Town Hall, a neoclassical-style building with painted polychrome murals with allegorical motifs that give the façade a unique air. In 1983, based on the remains that appeared on the façade, Julio Caro Baroja drew some drawings that were painted by the Beratarra painter Juan Ignacio Larramendi. These images represent the four cardinal virtues: prudence, temperance, justice and fortitude. On the website there is a wide variety of hiking proposals to enjoy the natural wealth of the town and its surroundings."
