On July 27, 2015, Massachusetts Governor Charles Baker reappointed Dr. Alfonso Ibarreta, a Managing Engineer in Exponent's Thermal Practice, as a member of the Massachusetts Board of Fire Prevention Regulations. Dr. Ibarreta was originally appointed to the Board in 2012 by then-Governor Deval Patrick. Since then, he has served on the Board as the mechanical engineering representative. The Board is responsible for amending and promulgating the comprehensive fire safety code (527 CMR) for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

During his involvement with the MA Board of Fire Prevention Regulations, Dr. Ibarreta helped to develop and adopt a new model fire code for the Commonwealth. The new Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code took effect on January 1, 2015. The code adopts, for the first time, the National Fire Protection Association Fire Code (NFPA 1, 2012 edition) with Massachusetts amendments. Massachusetts now joins nearly 20 other states in the country that use this model code as the backbone of their fire code.
