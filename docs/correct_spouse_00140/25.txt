Kimberly Anne Scott's biography

The renowned author was born in Warren, Michigan, United States, on 9th January 1975. This makes her 47 years old as of 2022. Her mother is known as Kathleen Scott, and her stepfather is Casimer Sluck. Not much is known about Kimberly's biological father.

Kimberly grew up alongside her twin sister, Dawn, who passed away in 2016 after overdosing on drugs. The two had a troubled childhood and had to endure incessant abuse from their alcoholic stepfather. Eventually, the unfavourable domestic situation led to the two girls running away from home when they were aged thirteen.

How did Eminem and Kimberly Anne Scott meet?

The thirteen-year-old sisters, Dawn and Kimberly, found refuge in the outskirts of Detroit after running away to escape their abusive, irresponsible, and alcoholic stepdad.

At the time, Eminem (Marshall Bruce Mathers III) was in and out of several rehabilitation centres, having been deserted by his father. In 1987, the 15-year-old Eminem and the sisters were at a house party, and his electrifying performance of LL Cool J's song caught Kimberly's attention.

Eminem and the young Kimberly Anne Scott began talking and quickly became friends. The rapper invited Dawn and Kimberly to live with him in his mother's house. Eminem's mum quickly became fond of Kimberly. Kim and Eminem then began dating around the same time the renowned rapper's career was taking off.

In December 1995, Kimberly and Eminem welcomed their first child together, a daughter known as Hailie Jade. The birth of Hailie marked the beginning of problems in the couple's relationship. This was reportedly caused by Eminem's rising fame, which made it difficult for him to balance his career and family life. Kimberly moved out and took Hailie with her.

The one-and-off relationship went on for a while, with the two eventually getting married in 1999. Not much is known about Kimberly Anne Scott's wedding. Still, the relationship troubles continued and reached an all-time high when Eminem released a song titled Kim in 2000. The song criticized Kimberly and included some seemingly violent lyrics.

Kimberly was hugely hurt by the song and attempted suicide by cutting her wrists. She survived the attempt and eventually divorced Eminem in 2001. The two got remarried in 2006, but their newfound union only lasted three months.

In 2015, Kimberly attempted suicide by ramming her car into a tree. She survived the crash.

Drug use

In 2016, Kimberly's sister passed away after overdosing on drugs. Kim was predictably shaken by her twin sister's demise. Here is an excerpt of her statement after Dawn's death.

Dawn was my sweet, beautiful sister who lost her way. I kept a light lit for her, hoping she'd find her way back to me. I miss her and love her more than anything I could ever say. I wish she was here so I could hug her and tell her I love her.
