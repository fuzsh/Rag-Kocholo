Kimberly Ann Scott, who is also known as Kim Mathers and who is the former wife of Eminem, has been seen out in public in Michigan, with this her first appearance since her suicide attempt in 2021.

She hadn't been seen in public for several years, but was spotted in Shelby Township, Michigan, at a local store, where she picked up some groceries.

In 2021, she was found by one of her children on the bathroom floor, surrounded by pills and blood.

It has been reported that she had written suicide notes, but fortunately the ex-wife of Eminem was saved by the emergency services.

Now, she is doing much better and even spent over a month at a rehabilitation centre called Jefferson House, located in Detroit, Michigan.

"It's been hard, as I lost my mom, my dad and my sister, but I'm good," she said, according to The Sun.

"I've been clean since about October, I went to Jefferson House for 45 days."
