        "text": "Eminem’s ex-wife Kim Scott has spoken out in a rare interview and revealed the pair are set to reunite soon.\n\nThe Lose Yourself rapper, 50, had a tumultuous marriage with Kim, 48, between 1999 and 2001. Days after he filed for divorce, Kim sued her estranged husband over lyrics about her in a song that was named after her.\n\nSurprisingly, they were able to settle the dispute out of court and reconciled before marrying each other for a second time in 2006. However, the relationship ended a year later.\n\nDespite their rocky past, the former couple appear to be on amicable terms and will reunite at their daughter Hailie Jade Mather’s upcoming wedding.\n\nHailie, 27, got engaged to her longtime boyfriend Evan McClintock in February when he popped the question at a restaurant.\n\nIt’s not known when Hailie and Evan have scheduled their nuptials but Kim has confirmed she’ll be there alongside ex-husband Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers. Speaking to The Sun US this week, she said ‘yes, of course’ when asked if she’ll be attending.\n\nWhen quizzed on how often she sees Eminem, she laughed: ‘Not often, but often enough!’\n\nKim also revealed that she is close with all her adult children and in contact with Eminem, while describing their daughter Alaina Scott’s wedding as ‘extravagant.’\n\nAlaina, who is Kim’s niece and raised by both her and Eminem, married her partner Matt Moeller in June in an elaborate Great Gatsby-themed wedding in Detroit.\n\nAfter tying the knot this summer, Alaina wrote in an Instagram post: ‘June 9, 2023 simply one of the best days of my life in this lifetime and in the next, my soul will always find yours [sic].’\n\nHer sister Hailie announced her engagement in February after Evan, who she had been dating since 2016, proposed.\n\n‘Casual weekend recap… I love you @evanmcclintock11,’ she captioned photos of the romantic moment.\n\nTheir mother Kim typically remains out of the spotlight but she opened up about her relationship with Eminem in an ABC 20/20 interview in 2007.\n\n‘Money is great, but it doesn’t make your husband stay at home with you,’ she said.\n\n‘Or sleep in the same bed with you … Him being on the road and on tour … that was like the big one. I mean … constant infidelities, all the time.’\n\nEminem is also father to Kim’s child from a previous marriage, who now uses they/them pronouns and goes by Stevie Laine. Kim also has a fourth child, son Parker, who is believed to be a teenager from a recent relationship.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : 50 Cent brings pal Eminem on stage in epic surprise: ‘I love him to death!’"
