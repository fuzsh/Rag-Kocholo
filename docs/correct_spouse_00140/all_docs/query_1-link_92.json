        "text": "Earlier this year, Eminem fans became fascinated by the rapper’s 21-year-old daughter Hailie Scott after she began posting to Instagram regularly (she stopped shortly after word caught on). But, interest in the beauty also left fans curious about her mom, Kimberly Anne Scott.\n\nThe 42-year-old was married not once but twice to the Grammy winner. They initially met after Kimberly and her twin sister Dawn ran away from home at the age of 13, and started living with Eminem (whose real name is Marshall Mathers) and his family. Soon after, the then-teen began dating the musician.\n\nThe couple welcomed Hailie on Christmas Day 1995 when Kim was 20 and Eminem was 23. Though having a child put a strain on their relationship, they tied the knot in 1999, but divorced two years later — in part because of an onstage incident in 2000. Not only did the singer record a song in which he describes killing his wife and burying her body, but he also threw around a blow-up doll during one of his concerts, which reportedly served as a stand-in for Kim. She attempted suicide shortly after.\n\nDespite years of turmoil, the pair remarried in January 2006, but the 8 Mile star filed for divorce again just three months later. Kim has had a few run-ins with the law since her first split from Eminem. She was charged with felony cocaine possession in 2003 and was sentenced to 30 days in jail after violating her probation. She also received a fine and probation in 2015 after drunkenly crashing her car into a utility pole. Her defense attorney claimed it was a suicide attempt.\n\nKim’s 2003 mug shot.\n\nAlong with Hailie, Kim has a 15-year-old daughter named Whitney with ex Eric Hartter. Eminem gained full custody of the teen amid Kim’s legal troubles. He also has custody of Dawn’s daughter, Alaina, which was granted before her mother’s death in January 2016.\n\nEminem recently spoke to Vulture about his love life, since he hasn’t been seen with anyone since the couple split more than 10 years ago. “It’s tough. Since my divorce I’ve had a few dates and nothing’s panned out in a way that I wanted to make it public. Dating’s just not where I’m at lately,” he admitted.\n\nThe 45-year-old also added that he’s found most of these dates on Tinder, Grindr (yes, Grindr), and in strip clubs. “Going to strip clubs is how I was meeting some chicks. It was an interesting time for me,” he shared. But when asked whether fame has been a solitary experience for him, Eminem responded, “Am I lonely? No, I’m good. Thanks for asking though.”"
