        "text": "After scrapping a second attempt at salvaging their rocky marriage, Eminem (Marshall Mathers) and estranged wife Kimberley Mathers have worked out a temporary divorce agreement. In it, Eminem gets the couple’s $450,000 Michigan home and Kimberley gets $475,000 to find her own place. The two also agreed on joint legal and physical custody of their five-year-old daughter, Hailie Jade.\n\n“Marshall’s obviously pleased with the agreement,” says Eminem’s attorney Harvey Hauer. “He feels it’s only appropriate because he’s had this significant role in his daughter’s upbringing to date, and that’s going to be ongoing.”\n\nThe temporary status of the agreement is standard procedure in Michigan, where there is a minimum sixty-day waiting period before a couple can get divorced.\n\nTrending\n\nThe Mathers, who were high-school sweethearts, were married in 1999. Eminem first requested a divorce after Kim attempted suicide at their Warren, Michigan home, while he was performing on the Up in Smoke Tour. Kim then retaliated by suing him for emotional distress, citing his violent lyrics that reference her. The couple later settled the suit and cancelled divorce proceedings, announcing that they would continue to live together. On March 1st, Kim’s lawyers filed for divorce, citing “a breakdown of the marriage relationship.”\n\nEminem still faces an April 10th sentencing for weapons possession charges stemming from a June 4, 2000 nightclub incident in which he allegedly assaulted a friend of Kim’s outside of a Michigan nightclub. He also faces a weapons charges from an incident the previous day involving a member of rival band Insane Clown Posse’s entourage."
