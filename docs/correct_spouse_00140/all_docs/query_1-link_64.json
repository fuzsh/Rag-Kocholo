        "text": "So here's a fact you might not know: rapper and singer Marshall Mathers (Eminem) doesn't just have one daughter. He actually has three kids.\n\nWe've heard a lot about eldest daughter Hailie Scott's upbringing in songs like 'Mockingbird' and 'Hailie's Song'. We're also relatively familiar with Mathers' troubled relationship with his ex-wife Kimberly Anne Scott.\n\nBut what fans rarely hear about is the two adopted children that changed Eminem's life.\n\nUnless you're a die-hard fan of the rapper, chances are the names Alaina Marie Mathers and Whitney Scott Mathers aren't entirely familiar.\n\nWatch a clip from Eminem’s music video for 'Lose Yourself'. Post continues below.\n\nHere's what Eminem's daughters' lives look like now.\n\nHailie Jade Scott.\n\nHailie has the most public persona of Eminem's children.\n\nShe's also Eminem's only biological daughter and was born on Christmas Day in 1995. She's now 27.\n\nIn 2014, Hailie graduated Summa Cum Laude from Michigan's Chippewa Valley High School and paid tribute to her parents.\n\n\"My mother and father because they have pushed me to be the person I am and have given me all the support to achieve what I have,\" she said in an end-of-school newsletter, reported by E! News.\n\nThey split two years later in 2001. The pair briefly reconciled in 2006, before separating permanently.\n\nOn her podcast, Hailie spoke about the reality of being Eminem's daughter, admitting questions about her dad bothered her.\n\n\"The best way to say this is yes and no. Honestly, it's to a point,\" she explained, adding, \"I obviously expect it. And there are certain things I can understand why people are just genuinely curious about, as anyone would be when you've kind of grown up half in the spotlight.\"\n\nHailie continued, \"I feel like growing up, when it would happen, I would get more bothered by it because I was like, 'Why do people care?' I was young and I didn't totally understand the situation, so I was like, that's my dad. I don't ask you about your dad.\"\n\nThe pair are incredibly close and on her podcast, she shared more about childhood — which she reflects on fondly.\n\n\"I always think about that time we went to Florida, my dad was working on something, and he set up for us to do, like, the limo and take it to Disney and we did the princess tea party, and he had the dresses waiting for us,\" Hailie shared on Just A Little Shady.\n\n\"At the time, we were so happy and so excited, but we didn't get to appreciate that moment as much as now when we talk about it and think back on it.\"\n\nAlaina Marie Mathers.\n\nBorn under the name Amanda in 1993 to Kimberly’s twin sister Dawn Scott — who died of drug abuse in 2016 — Alaina Marie was legally adopted by Eminem in the 2000s, although it’s unclear precisely when this happened.\n\n\"I have full custody of my niece,\" the rapper told Rolling Stone about Alaina.\n\n\"My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born. Me and Kim pretty much had her, she'd live with us wherever we was at.\"\n\nIn 2020, he said Alaina, whom he often calls Lainey in the lyrics of his songs, is \"like a daughter\" to him.\n\nHer name was legally changed during the adoption process.\n\nAlaina is occasionally referenced in Eminem’s work: in 'Mockingbird' the rapper referred to Alaina and Hailie as sisters.\n\nThese days, Alaina is a mental health and body positivity advocate, regularly sharing photos on her Instagram.\n\nIn December 2021, the 30-year-old got engaged to her fiance Matt Moeller after seven years together.\n\nThey married on June 9, 2023, in Detroit, Michigan; and Hailie was a bridesmaid.\n\n\"June 9, 2023, simply one of the best days of my life in this lifetime and in the next, my soul will always find yours,\" Alaina wrote on Instagram.\n\nIn an interview with PEOPLE, Alaina confirmed Eminem did walk her down the aisle.\n\n\"He wasn't going to miss that,\" she said. “These are once-in-a-lifetime moments, and I'm just so grateful to be loved the way I am by everyone. None of this would have been possible without my dad. I'm beyond blessed.”\n\nIn the video, which has since been deleted, Stevie seemed to recount a conversation they had with the rapper about being adopted.\n\n\"He's not your real dad,\" they wrote in the video, as if it was said by an unnamed person. \"You're adopted.\"\n\n\"You're my real dad, right? Am I adopted [sic]?\" they asked.\n\n\"I am your real dad,\" they were told by (presumably) Eminem.\n\nStevie then claimed they were sent an article about their biological father's death and showed it to their grandmother.\n\n\"I'm sorry they wouldn't tell you about him [sic],\" Stevie recounted their grandmother saying.\n\nThe 21-year-old ended the video by lip-syncing the line, \"That must be so confusing for a little girl\" from the song 'Remember Me' by Adventure Time.\n\nStevie is also the most private out of the three siblings, but in November 2022, we got to find out a little bit more about their childhood through Alaina and Hailie on Just A Little Shady.\n\nIn the podcast episode, the sisters joked about their strict upbringing and how it compared to Stevie's, who seemed to get away with a lot more.\n\nAlaina recalled how, as the oldest sibling, she was \"always getting in trouble\", while her baby sibling got away with everything. As an example, she recalled her birthday party when she was in the sixth grade.\n\n\"I wanted to wear a two-piece bathing suit and I wasn't allowed,\" she said. \"And I was like, 'Stevie came out the womb in a two-piece bathing suit, basically!'\"\n\nThis post was originally published on January 26, 2018, and has since been updated with new information.\n\nFeature Image: Instagram/TikTok @alainamariescott, @hailiejade, @st0nedc0w.\n\nDo you have kids aged under 13 years?
