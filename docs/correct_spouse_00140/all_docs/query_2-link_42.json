        "text": "Eminem celebrated his 50th birthday this weekend, and what a 50 years he has had.\n\nThe rapper, who grew up in poverty in Detroit, became one of the most successful artists of our generation.\n\nHe swooped onto the music scene with huge tracks like The Real Slim Shady and Mockingbird where he leaned on his own life experiences to craft lyrics.\n\nHis songs about his struggles and heartbreak captured the hearts of the listeners and are still widely listened to today.\n\nEminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, is still single now - but his relationship history is far from smooth.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, he spoke about how he finds it hard to find someone he can trust.\n\n\"I mean, I'd like to be in a relationship again someday. Who doesn't? It's just hard to meet new people, in my position,\" he said.\n\n\"I have trust issues. With women, friends, whatever. You always wonder what their real motives are.\"\n\n\"I've got a small circle of friends, and it's a lot of the same friends I've known forever. Right now, that works for me,\" he added.\n\nHere we take a look at the star's love life, turbulent marriage and devotion to his children.\n\nKimberly Anne Scott\n\nEminem met Kimberly at high school and she moved in with him soon after she and her twin sister ran away from home.\n\nThey embarked in an on/off relationship in 1989, before getting married ten years later in 1999.\n\nIn 1995 the couple had a daughter, Hailie, who regularly features in Slim's songs.\n\nDespite being childhood sweethearts, they got divorced in 2001.\n\nShe then sued him for emotional distress - claiming his violent lyrics referenced her.\n\nDespite this, the couple cancelled divorce proceedings and decided to continue living together.\n\nHowever, this arrangement wasn't to last and Kim's lawyers filed for divorce again, citing \"a breakdown of their marriage\".\n\nAfter the divorce, they stayed in each others lives and eventually rekindled their romance.\n\nThey got married again in 2006, but Kim has since spoken about her reservations.\n\n\"I was excited, I was happy, but at the same time, I thought he was rushing things,” she said.\n\n\"In our relationship, there’s a pattern. Like, we’ll have two good years and then it will go bad for some reason. It’s like a two-year max with us and we hadn’t reached the two years yet. I just didn’t want to rush into anything before the two years,” she said.\n\nSoon after their second wedding, their relationship began breaking down again.\n\nThey divorced for the second time in April 2006, and agreed joint custody.\n\nAs well as Hailie, they share custody of their niece, Alaina Mathers - who Eminem adopted in the early 2000s.\n\nMariah Carey\n\nMariah Carey has always denied dating Eminem, but the feeling isn't mutual.\n\nSlim has spoken about his so-called relationship with the All I Want for Christmas singer saying: \"Yes, me and Mariah did have a relationship for about a good six, seven months, but it didn’t work. I wasn’t really into what she was into; our personalities collided.\"\n\nMariah has a different take on the situation, speaking to Larry King in 2002: \"I talked to him (Eminem), I spoke to him a few times, whatever.\n\n\"But in terms of me having an intimate relationship? With men, I can name them all on one hand, and he’s not one of them.” She added, “I hung out with him, I spoke to him on the phone. I think I was probably with him a total of four times. And I don’t consider that dating somebody.”\n\nKarrine Steffans\n\nMusic video star Karrine has appeared in more than 20 music videos and been linked to countless celebrities.\n\nShe is the author of three New York Times bestsellers:\n\nConfessions of a Video Vixen, The Vixen Diaries, and The Vixen Manual: How to Find, Seduce & Keep the Man You Want.\n\nThe pair were said to have dated in 2003.\n\nTara Reid\n\nThe American Pie actress and Eminem had a relationship, which he referenced in harsh lyrics on his Kamikaze album.\n\nIt is believed that they got together in 2004, which the rapper has confirmed.\n\nJoy McAvoy\n\nActress Joy McAvoy allegedly admitted that she spent a night with the rapper in the early 2000s.\n\nEminem has neither confirmed or denied the claims.\n\nJoy has appeared in X-Men: Dark Phoenix and Avengers: Endgame.\n\nChildren\n\nHailie Jade\n\nHailie is Eminem's only biological child. She now works as a social media influencer where she has 2.8million followers.\n\nShe also hosts her own podcast called Just A Little Shady - in a sweet reference to her dad.\n\nShe graduated from Michigan State University in 2018 with a degree in Psychology.\n\nAlaina Mathers\n\nAlaina, 29, is the biological daughter of Kim's sister Dawn who died of an overdose in 2016.\n\nSpeaking of his relationship with Alaina, Eminem told Rolling Stone: \"My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born.\n\n\"Me and Kim pretty much had her, she’d live with us wherever we was at.\"\n\nAlaina, who has a huge Instagram following, broke the news to her 32.4k followers that she was engaged.\n\nHer long-term boyfriend Matt Moeller got down on one knee in a rooftop proposal at Detroit's Monarch Club with the caption: \"this moment. this life. yes hundred times over.\"\n\nStevie Mathers\n\nEminem also adopted 20-year-old Stevie Mathers, formerly Whitney, who is non-binary and uses the pronouns they/she/he.\n\nStevie is the biological child of Kim and her ex boyfriend Eric Hartter.\n\nDo you enjoy reading about celebrities?
