        "text": "Millions of people are familiar with the legendary rapper Eminem. The rapper hasn't been on the headlines only due to his songs but also for his volatile relationship. Kim Scott Mathers, Eminem's ex-wife now, is the woman whom he has divorced not once but twice.\n\nKimberly is an American-born writer and mercenary illustrator. Kim has written several children's books, but this didn't bring her to the limelight as much as her turbulent relationship did. The relationship between Eminem and Kim has been a rollercoaster of emotions with the pair ending up calling it quits.\n\nKimberly Ann Scott profile summary\n\nFull name: Kimberly Ann Scott\n\nDate of birth: 9th January 1975\n\nPlace of birth: Warren, Michigan, U.S.A\n\nAge: 45 years\n\nNationality: American\n\nEthnicity: Caucasian-white\n\nReligion: Christianity\n\nProfession: Writer, illustrator\n\nMarital status: Divorced\n\nCurrent residence: Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A\n\nNet worth: $2 million\n\nKimberly Ann Scott biography\n\nKim was born on 9th January 1975 as Kimberly Ann Scott in Warren, Michigan, in the United States of America. Her parents are Casimer Sluck (father) and Kathleen Sluck (mother). She had a twin sister named Dawn Scott, who passed away in early 2016 at the age of 41 due to heroin overdose. The twin sisters were brought up by their mother and step-father.\n\nKim and Dawn had a rough time growing up as they had to deal with an alcoholic step-father who even assaulted Kimberly sexually. The two couldn't take it anymore, and they fled home and began living at Youth home in 1998. Later on, Kim met the rapper, and they moved to his mother's house.\n\nEminem and Kim Scott relationship\n\nKim and Eminem met for the first time at a friend's house party where Eminem saw Kim singing. At that time, Eminem was 15 years, while Kim was just 13 years old. After knowing each other for some time, Eminem invited Scott to go live with him in his mother's house.\n\nThe duo had an on-and-off relationship, which forced Kimberly to move out with her daughter Hailie just after her birth. A few years later, the relationship was on, and Kim and Eminem reconciled and tied the knot in 1999.\n\nThe marriage was faced with numerous challenges that made the duo hate each other even more. It was so bad that the rapper composed songs to express his dislike for Kim. He released the jam, Kim, in 2000, which was aimed at expressing his intense fury towards his wife.\n\nKimberly was caught kissing his husband's mutual friend and rapper, John Guerra. The occurrence got Eminem enraged to the point of attacking Guerra, who filed a lawsuit against him. As a result, Eminem was sentenced to two years of probation. Kim's husband referenced the incident in his jam dubbed the Kiss from his 2002 album titled The Eminem Show. Two years later, the couple ended their marriage in divorce.\n\nThe court finalized the divorce by authorizing that Kim and Eminem would enjoy shared custody of their daughter.

Even though Kim survived the attempted suicide, it marked the beginning of a series of disastrous events in her life.\n\nDue to desperation, Kim turned to drugs. In the year 2001, she was arrested for possessing drugs. In 2003, she received court charges after she was caught driving under the influence. Ann was fined and kept on probation. What did Eminem ex-wife go to jail for? Kimberly violated the terms of her probation. She was once again arrested, and the courts ruled a jail term of one month.\n\nEminem and Kimberly tied the knot again in 2006, following the release of Kim. Soon after, the duo separated after staying together for three months. Kim was able to handle the second divorce in a better manner than the first one, even though she claimed that the marriage was a rush decision.\n\nIn 2016, the news of Kimberly's twin sister's death broke her to pieces that she attempted suicide for the second time. Anne Scotts drove her Escalade into a pole but got lucky enough to survive the crash.\n\nKimberly Anne Scott children\n\nOn 25th December 1995, Kimberly gave birth to their firstborn daughter Hailie Jade while the duo was still living at Eminem's house.
