Kim Mathers' age at that time was 13, while Eminem was 15. Recalling how they met, Eminem had the following to say:\n\nI met her the day she got out of the youth home. I was at a friend’s house, and his sister was friends with her, but she hadn’t seen Kim in a while ’cause she was in the youth home. And I’m standing on the table with my shirt off, on top of their coffee table with a Kangol on, mocking the words to LL Cool J’s ‘I’m Bad.’\n\nBut what amazed most fans is that despite several challenges, they remained glued to each other and went on to marry. Issues occurred, and they divorced two years after marrying in 2001. They briefly remarried again in January 2006 and finally went their separate ways three months later.\n\nWhat happened to Eminem's ex-wife?\n\nShe battled depression and addiction and tried to end her life. Kim had the following to say about the car accident:\n\nI sat at the end of a road where I knew that no one else but myself would get hurt. Yes, I drank, I took pills and I hit the gas and aimed for a pole. I never expected to make it out of that alive. I apologized immensely. I did not even expect to make it through that, and I told [police] that I tried to do this on purpose.\n\nKim Scott Mathers' suicide attempt happened in 2000 after her ex-husband wrote and performed a song in her name.

The day she was arrested for possessing drugs, police said they found a “white powdery substance” with her. But her lawyer claimed that the drugs were not hers.\n\nWhy did Eminem write Kim?\n\nEminem reportedly wrote the song after he had broken up with his then-wife and was feeling the frustration of them breaking up and having a daughter all in the mix. He said he also needed an opportunity to pour out his heart and scream. The song reflects his pain, anger, resentment, and intense ups and downs with Mathers.\n\nDoes Kim Mathers have a sister?\n\nShe has a twin sister; they were born on 9 January 1975 in Warren, Michigan.
