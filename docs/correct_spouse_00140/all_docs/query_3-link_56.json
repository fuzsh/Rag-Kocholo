She was born on February 22, 1993 in Michigan.\n\nAccording to People, Eminem legally adopted her in the early 2000s as Dawn struggled with substance use. Dawn died in 2016 from a suspected overdose.\n\n\"My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born,\" Eminem told Rolling Stone of Alaina in 2004. \"Me and Kim pretty much had her, she'd live with us wherever we was at.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlaina, 31, married her longtime fiancé, Matt Moeller, in 2023.\n\nAlaina graduated from Oakland University in 2016 with a bachelor of arts in communication and a double minor in public relations and advertising.\n\nShe shares her travels and adventures on Instagram, where she has over 100,000 followers.\n\nOn June 9, 2023, she married her partner Matt Moeller in a ceremony in Michigan, surrounded by 125 of their nearest and dearest, including Hailie.\n\n\"Simply one of the best days of my life,\" she wrote on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHailie Jade is Eminem's only biological child.\n\nHailie Jade Scott was born on Christmas Day of 1995 in Detroit.\n\nBefore Eminem found fame, he worked 60 hours a week as a cook at a local restaurant to help fund her upbringing.\n\nAt age 6, Hailie was featured on the track \"My Dad's Gone Crazy\" alongside her father. After the song hit the Billboard charts in August 2002, Hailie entered the Guinness Book of World Records as the youngest performer to be credited on the R&B charts.\n\nThroughout his career, Eminem has often mentioned his daughter in his songs, including \"Mockingbird\" and \"Hailie's Song.\"\n\nEminem and Kim agreed to joint custody of Hailie after their second divorce, in 2006.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHailie, 28, is a podcaster who recently married her longtime partner, Evan McClintock.\n\nIn 2018, Hailie graduated from Michigan State University with a psychology degree.\n\nToday, she is an influencer with over 3 million followers on Instagram. She also has a podcast called \"Just A Little Shady,\" a nod to Eminem's rap alter-ego.\n\nIn 2023, Hailie announced that she and her boyfriend of six years, Evan McClintock, were engaged. They married the following year with rap royalty in attendance, including Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, and, of course, her father.\n\nDuring a 2021 interview with MailOnline, Hailie shared that she and Eminem were still \"very close.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEminem also adopted Stevie in 2005.\n\nBorn in 2002, Stevie Laine Scott is the child of Kim and her former partner Eric Hartter.\n\nWhen Eminem and Kim reconciled after their first divorce, he adopted Stevie as Hartter reportedly dealt with drug addiction.\n\nHartter died in 2019 at age 40.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStevie, 22, now lives a quiet life in Michigan.\n\nIn August 2021, Stevie came out as nonbinary in a TikTok video captioned, \"watch me become more comfortable with myself.\"\n\nStevie is dating Declan Jace, a TikToker who often shares videos of them together on their account.\n\nCorrection: June 14, 2023 — An earlier version of this story misstated the name of the university that Hailie Jade Scott attended.
