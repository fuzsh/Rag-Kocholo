        "text": "Birth Name Kimberly Anne Scott Born January 9th, 1975 (49 years old)\n\nWarren, Michigan, United States\n\nKimberly Ann Scott, also known as Kim Mathers, became popular in the late 1990s after dating the famous hip-hop rapper Eminem. The couple dated for several years. According to their friends, colleagues, and fans, the two \"were a match made in fucking hell.\" Despite being together for a long time, the two were also known to get into spats quite a lot. They married and divorced twice, in 2001 and 2006.\n\nShe is most widely recognized as Eminem’s ex-wife. The relationship between the two was well-documented in the 1990s and early 2000s everywhere in the tabloids.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn on January 9th 1975, Scott did not have a good childhood. She was born in the suburbs of Detroit, but Scott and her twin sister had to run away from their home in 1988. The couple took shelter in a youth shelter outside of Detroit, Michigan.\n\nRelationship with Eminem[]\n\nScott and Eminem knew each other since childhood. They met in 1988 when both were just teenagers. Allegedly, sparks began to fly between them through the 1990s. The couple dated each other for a while and even welcomed their first and only child, Hailie Mathers.\n\nAfter Hailie’s birth in 1995, the couple decided to take a serious step in their relationship. Eminem and Scott tied the knot in 1999 and lived like a happy family for some time. Sadly, they began finding themselves in some rocky waters. Their marriage ended two years later, but they did not part ways. They also did a second marriage and divorced in 2006.\n\nLater career[]\n\nShe owns a house in Macomb Township, Michigan, U.S.\n\nTrivia[]"
