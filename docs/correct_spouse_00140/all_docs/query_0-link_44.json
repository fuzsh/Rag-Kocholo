        "text": "EMINEM'S ex-wife Kim Mathers has revealed she is now clean following a 45-day stint in rehab after her suicide attempt last year - just days after losing her beloved mother.\n\nThe 48-year-old, who has three children with the rap superstar and one from another relationship, was left heartbroken after her mom Kathy Sluck passed away.\n\nAudio from a 911 call in July 2022 revealed one of Kim's scared children found their mom \"surrounded by blood and pills on her bathroom floor.\"\n\nHer child saved her life after breaking the handle on the door and calling for help, as desperate Kim begged them not to call the police.\n\nThe mom-of-four, who reportedly left notes for her family, was rushed to hospital for treatment before being discharged and was later said to be recovering at home.\n\nThe U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal Kim is doing much better since her mental health scare, and she received treatment for addiction at a center in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nWhen approached to ask how she is doing now, she said: \"It's been hard, I lost my mom, my dad, and my sister [over the past 10 years].\n\n\"[But] I'm good. I've been clean since about October, I went to Jefferson House ... for 45 days.\"\n\nKim, who has also been pictured carrying boxes to her car, revealed she had previously been taking pills to try and sleep as she struggled with the loss of her mother.\n\nShe said her children had been \"very supportive,\" and she is now on medication, but declined to talk further about her situation.\n\nKim said that despite her past troubles with Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers, he has also been there for her and checks in to make sure she's doing ok.\n\nNEW CHAPTER\n\nAsked how often she sees her famous ex, she joked: \"Not often, but often enough.\"\n\nKim has changed her look dramatically in recent years, adding dozens of tattoos to her collection, including a sleeve down her left arm, neck inkings, and text on her right arm.\n\nQuizzed on what made her get the tattoos, she said: \"I don't know, but I love Alice In Wonderland,\" pointing to her giant colorful Cheshire Cat design.\n\nExclusive photographs obtained by The U.S. Sun also show her with short-cropped blonde hair as she runs errands close to her home in Macomb.\n\nBefore her latest suicide attempt, Kim posted a heartfelt message to her mum, who died on July 23 last year, writing underneath an online obit: \"You're all I had left Momma.\"\n\nThe grieving mom added: \"I can't imagine this without you! I love you Momma! Kiss my dad and sister for me.\"\n\nHer mom's official obit read: \"From day one, Kathleen knew how to be the center of a room and made friends wherever she went.\n\n\"She had a great knack for telling jokes and making people laugh and loved to be a flirt.\n\n\"Later in her life, Kathleen met the love of her life, and future husband, Casey Sluck. Together, Kathleen and Casey spent many years together filled with love and countless beautiful memories.\n\nFAMILY TIES\n\n\"Kathleen was an exceptional mom to her two daughters; Kim and Dawn; and was overjoyed to become a grandmother to her grandchildren; Alaina, Adam, Hailie, Stevie, P.J., and Parker.\n\n\"Kathleen adored the holidays with her family, where she would make one of her many fantastic homemade meals. Kathleen will be forever remembered for being a loving wife, mother, grandmother, and friend to all who loved her.\"\n\nDespite a difficult year, Kim, who still goes by her married name, said she was delighted to attend her daughter Alaina Scott's wedding in June, where she was reunited again with her famous ex.\n\nShe joked the ceremony was \"extravagant\" and the family had a dream day at the Packard Proving Ground Historic Museum in Shelby Township, Michigan.\n\nKim, who also has daughter Hailie Jade, 27, with ex Eminem, adopted Alaina, 30, whose mother Dawn, Kim's sister, died of a drug overdose in 2016 after years of addiction problems.\n\nBorn in Warren, Michigan, Kim and sister Dawn both left home at 13, allegedly to escape an alcoholic stepdad.\n\nAlaina has always considered Kim and Marshall to be her parents and is incredibly close to the pair.\n\nKim is also mom to Stevie Laine, 21, who identifies as non-binary, from a previous relationship, and was also raised by the rapper, 50, who considers her his daughter.\n\nRELATIONSHIP HISTORY\n\nShe now lives alone with her rarely-seen son Parker, who is believed to be in his teens.\n\nKim has been open about her mental health struggles over the years and previously tried to take her own life in 2015 by crashing her car into a utility pole.\n\nShe told cops after surviving the crash she'd drank a fifth of Malibu rum and waited until nobody else was on the road.\n\nShe struck a utility pole and her SUV landed upside down in a ditch.\n\nKim was still sentenced to 12 months of probation and a $900 fine in connection to the October 2015 crash.\n\nShe spoke fondly of her ex at the time during her recovery, saying he had been supportive.\n\nKim has had a rocky relationship with Eminem, who was her childhood sweetheart, but the pair are now on good terms.\n\nThe pair were married from 1999 to 2001 and she sued for defamation just days after he filed for divorce over the violent lyrics in his song 'Kim'.\n\nThey settled out of court and ended up reconciling, tying the knot again in 2006 but divorcing just a year later."
