        "text": "\"How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?\" Eminem raps in his hit song \"Kim,\" inspired by Kim Scott.\n\nBy Alex West\n\nMay 28 2024, Published 9:31 a.m. ET\n\nRapper Eminem faced a tumultuous relationship with a woman named Kim Scott in the early years of his career. Their relationship helped inspire much of his music, including songs like \"Kim,\" \"Bonnie & Clyde,\" and \"Love The Way You Lie.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nTheir love started sweet and innocent as high schoolers, but as Eminem rose to fame, the pressure took a toll. They were married in 1999 before separating and re-marrying in 2006. That second marriage only lasted a year before they divorced for good.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhere is Eminem's ex-wife Kim Scott now?\n\nKim Scott Mathers was affected deeply by Eminem's music and fame. In an incident from 2000, Eminem held up a blow-up doll that resembled her on stage while performing a song with her namesake. “Seeing the crowd’s response and everybody cheering, singing the words, and laughing and it just felt like everyone was staring at me,” Kim told People. “I knew that it was about me and that night I went home and I tried to commit suicide.”\n\nKim also had some run-ins with the law. During her relationship with Eminem, she was arrested for drug possession and faced several DUIs. She was hit with another DUI charge in 2016.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nKim also struggled heavily with drug and alcohol addiction which came to light during the divorce proceedings. According to reports, her drug and alcohol issues are what led to the divorce.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIn 2021, Kim relapsed and was hospitalized for self-harm. TMZ reported that she was suicidal and a call was made to 9-1-1. Authorities told the publication that she was combative and violent when they arrived.\n\nKim reportedly cut herself on her leg which caused a decent amount of blood. During her hospital stay, she was psychologically and physically evaluated before being allowed to return home.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nNow, Kim seems to be in a healthier state as she focuses on her budding career as an illustrator, specifically for children's books. She is a mother to three, one of which is the biological child of Eminem and the other two are adopted by both parents.\n\nAs for finances, Kim reportedly receives $50,000 annually from Eminem. However, it's unknown if these checks are still rolling in or if they stopped as the kids grew up.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWho are Eminem's kids?\n\nKim and Eminem's children are growing up quickly, but fans may remember the days they were born or adopted. Their eldest is Hailie Jade Scott who served as a real wakeup call for Eminem.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHailie is the inspiration behind several of the musician's songs. She was born in 1995, making her an adult today which is evidenced through her life events, including a wedding in May 2024.\n\nThe pair's middle child is Alaina Marie Scott. She was technically born to Kim's sister, but Eminem adopted her and got full custody. She was born in 1993 and is now a travel blogger.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAlaina got married in 2023 and Eminem walked her down the aisle. She told People, \"He wasn't going to miss that. These are once-in-a-lifetime moments, and I'm just so grateful to be loved the way I am by everyone. None of this would have been possible without my dad. I'm beyond blessed.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe pair's youngest child, Stevie Laine Scott, was born in 2002 to Kim and her now ex-boyfriend Eric. While they were born while Kim and Eminem were separated, he still adopted them ahead of Stevie's biological father's death."
