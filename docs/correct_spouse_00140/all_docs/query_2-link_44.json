        "text": "The name that is repeatedly being linked to the rapper Eminem is Kimberly Anne Scott. Did you know she is the girl who took the heart of the rapper in the first sight? And, what about their bitter past together. If you aren’t aware, then just give a deep look on our post. Here we have summed up all the information about Kimberly, her relationship with Eminem, net worth and many more.\n\nKeep on Scrolling and enjoy the post!!!\n\nSynopsis\n\nKimberly Anne Scott is an author and American mercenary illustrator. She has written over dozens of children’s books. She isn’t famous for her writing but indeed came in headlines for her turbulent relationship with the controversial rapper- Marshall Bruce Mathers III AKA Eminem. Eminem is one of the most controversial and best-selling artists of the 21st century who garnered recognition after he released the album The Slim Shady LP. Eminem and Kim have a daughter named Hailie Jade Mathers.\n\nWho is Kimberly Anne Scott?\n\nKimberly Anne Scott was born on January 9, 1975, in Warren Michigan, USA to mother Kathleen Sluck and father Casmir. Kim is of white ethnicity and holds American nationality. She has also got a twin sister named Dawn Scott who demised due to heroin overdose in early 2016. The twin sisters were raised by her mother and step-father.\n\nGrowing up, Kim and her twin sister had a disturbing childhood. They had to deal with their alcoholic step-father who even used to assault Kim sexually. As a consequence, she and her sister ran away from the house and started living at Youth home in 1998. But later on, after meeting with Eminem, they moved to his house.\n\nHow Kimberly and Eminem Met?\n\nKimberly Anne Scott and Marshall Bruce Mathers III, known by stage name as Eminem met each other by utter fate. While at the Youth Home, Kimberly never got out but the first time she left for a friend’s party, she met Eminem. Kimberly was 13 and Eminem was just 15 years of age when they met. The duo came into each other path when Eminem was singing his favorite song “I am Bad” standing half naked on the table. His swag was able to make impression on Kimberley who instantly fell in love with him.\n\nTheir friendship blossomed at the party and it didn’t take long before Eminem let Kim and her sister stay at his mother’s house. On and off relationship between the pair started to blossom and soon they became school sweethearts.\n\nHer On and Off Relationship with Eminem\n\nThe duo started dating in the year 1989 and throughout the 90s.Things were already getting sour between the couple when Kimberly got pregnant when she was living at Eminem’s mother.Despite the on-and-off relationship, they gave birth to their daughter on Christmas 1995. The Christmas baby was named as Hailie Jade Mathers.\n\nThe following year, the couple parted their ways , and Kimberly with her daughter shifted to one bedroom apartment.Whereas, Eminem went back to stay with his mother.Despite staying away for more than two years, the duo revived their romance and later got back together in 1999. They also exchanged vows at St.Joseph Mo the same year they got together.\n\nUnfortunately, the marriage didn’t last long and they parted their ways legally in 2001. It’s assumed that the reason behind their separation is the song ‘Kim’ where he mentions about killing his wife. Further, he played the song in his ‘Up in Smoke Tour’ where Kim was one of the audiences. This incident created more tension between the couple whose output was the divorce.\n\nHowever, after five years of their separation, again the two decided to give second chance to their relationship for the welfare of their daughter and re-married in January 2006. To everyone’s surprise, the marriage only lasted for one month.Scott and Eminem share the joint custody of their daughter Hailey Jade.\n\nPrior to second marriage, Kimberly was in the relationship with a man called Eric Harter. She also gave birth to daughter named Whitney Scott from that relationship.\n\nThe Glue That Kept Them Together\n\nDespite having many differences, Kim and Eminem came together from time to time for their daughter Hailie. Both parents loved Hailie immensely and she was the glue that kept them together for much longer than they should have been. They gave many chances to their relationship for their Christmas born baby. However, in the end, they ended their up and down relationship.\n\n//www.instagram.com/embed.js\n\nPhoto :Kimberly And Eminen’s Daughter Hailie Jade Mathers\n\nControversies and Troubles with the Law\n\nIn June 2000, Eminem saw his wife kissing a friend John Guerra on his cheek in the parking lot of a Warren, Mich. Nightclub. Eventually, he assaulted the man and was also arrested for the incident. He was pled guilty and was charged with sentence of two years. Likewise, in 2000, Eminem played the song ‘Kim’ and assaulted a blow-up doll stand-in for Kim at one of his concerts in Detroit. She wasn’t able to handle this humiliation because of which she tried to kill herself by slashing her wrist.\n\nIn 2001, Eminem’s wife was arrested and charged with drug possession but wasn’t declared guilty. Again in 2003, she was arrested for unsafe driving with two bags of cocaine. She was fined and was kept on probation. Later when she violated her probation, she was sentenced to one-month jail. Similarly, in 2015, while going through depression following her ex-husband’s stage abuse, Kim attempted suicide by crashing her car into standing pole after taking pills and drink. She was fined and served one year of probation and has undergone alcohol and drug testing.\n\nEminem’s Apology to Kim\n\nEminem’s stormy relationship with his ex-wife has been a major source of inspiration throughout his musical career. He has humiliated his ex-wife through his musical albums in the past. However, on his new album ‘Revival’ with ‘Bad Husband’, he has finally apologized to Kim for the pain he has caused.\n\nEminem opens up “Bad Husband” by elaborating the height of their chaotic public relationship from 1998 through 2001. That is from the time they got married and when they got divorced while his career was on the path to success.\n\nKimberly Anne Scott ‘s Children\n\nKim has two biological children Hailie Jade Mathers from Eminem and Whitney Scott from her relationship with Eric Harter. She and Eminem took care of Aliana Marie Mathers, the daughter of Dawn Scott because of her drug issues. They formally adopted Aliana in 2002.\n\nKim has also a son named Patrick Scott. No further details about him are known other than his name. Eminem and Kim together share the custody of their biological and adopted children.\n\nKim’s Net worth\n\nBeing the ex-wife of a famous rapper, her net worth is estimated to be around $ 2 million. However, her former husband, Eminem has a whooping sum of amount $220 million as net worth according to Celebrity net worth in 2019. The rapper comes under the 6th position among the richest rappers in the world. In 2001, for the divorce settlement, the court ordered Eminem to pay $52000 per annum to Kim for spousal support and child custody.\n\nThe ex-couple still see each other, but Kim has managed to clean up her life, despite the bad influence Eminem seems to have on her. Their daughter Hailie had a normal upbringing and wasn’t affected by the stormy relationship of her parents."
