        "text": "Eminem's dysfunctional relationship with wife Kim has hit another low _ he has filed divorce papers, less than three months after remarrying her.\n\n\"There has been a breakdown in the marriage relationship to the extent that the objects of matrimony have been destroyed and there remains no reasonable likelihood that the marriage can be preserved,\" according to the filing, which was made in Macomb County on Wednesday on behalf of Marshall Bruce Mathers III, Eminem's real name.\n\nThe filing also states that Eminem and his wife signed a prenuptial agreement a week before their Jan. 14 wedding ceremony in Rochester. It doesn't describe the specifics of the prenuptial agreement, other than to say that \"the property of the parties should be divided in accordance with\" the agreement.\n\nIt also says that Kim Mathers is not pregnant and that Eminem is seeking joint custody of their 10-year-old daughter, Hailie Jade Scott.\n\nKim Mathers' lawyer, Michael J. Smith, said the filing caught his client off-guard.\n\n\"It comes to us as somewhat of a surprise. But we have to deal with it, and we will deal with it,\" he said. \"I was at their wedding. It's very unfortunate that he filed for divorce.\"\n\nEminem's publicist, Dennis Dennehy, confirmed the filing, but had no other comment. A message seeking comment was left Wednesday afternoon with Harvey Hauer, Eminem's lawyer.\n\nThe 33-year-old Grammy- and Oscar-winning rapper remarried Kimberley Anne Scott a month after the couple announced they were getting back together. Their first marriage ended in 2001.\n\nThough the marital issues of most rappers wouldn't make headlines, Eminem has used his tormented relationship with his high school sweetheart as a source of his most popular and demented rhymes. He's killed her off in song and assailed her with his lyrics _ but that was before they got back together.\n\nThe couple reconciled in late 2004, and Eminem announced in December 2005 that they would get back together.\n\nThe pair grew up in the suburbs along Eight Mile Road, Detroit's northern border.\n\nLast August, Eminem entered a hospital to undergo treatment for sleep medication dependency. A month earlier, he denied reports that he was preparing to retire from recording.\n\nEminem rose to pop stardom by delivering a number of best-selling CDs, deeply personal lyrics and a starring role in the 2002 film \"8 Mile.\"\n\nHis Grammys include best rap album for \"The Slim Shady LP,\" \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" and \"The Eminem Show.\" He won an Oscar for the song \"Lose Yourself\" from the 2002 film \"8 Mile,\" in which he had a starring role."
