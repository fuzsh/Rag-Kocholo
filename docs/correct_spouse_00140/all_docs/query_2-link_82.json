        "text": "Eminem’s Ex-Wife Hospitalized For Suicide Attempt\n\nEminem’s ex-wife, Kim Scott, was hospitalized following a suicide attempt during which she became violent with law enforcement.\n\nLaw enforcement told gossip website TMZ that police and emergency workers responded to a call of a suicidal person at Kim’s home in Michigan on July 30.\n\nWhen help arrived, Kim was so combative, that she had to be restrained by deputies and was so violent, paramedics were unable to check her vitals.\n\nSources say it appeared Kim had cut herself, as she had several small lacerations on the back of her leg and a large amount of blood was on the floor. Kim was then rushed to a hospital for both medical and psychological evaluation, but is now back at home and is recovering. It’s unclear if she’s getting any additional care.\n\nEminem and Kim Scott were married in 1999 and divorced in 2001, having daughter Hailie Jade in 1995. The couple briefly remarried for a few months in 2006.\n\n8 Celebrities Who Have Beefed With Eminem\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
