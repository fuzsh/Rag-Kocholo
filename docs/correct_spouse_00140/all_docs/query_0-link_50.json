        "text": "Eminem has apparently struggled to find a woman he trusts, with a close friend saying that the rap superstar is still very much scarred by his ex-wife Kim Scott.\n\nEminem’s toxic relationship with Kim has been well documented over the years, both in the rapper’s music and elsewhere. The pair first met in high school back in 1989, and had their daughter Hailie in 1995, before going on to exchange their vows in 1999. They then divorced in 2001, before reconciling and getting married again in 2006. But a mere three months later they divorced again.\n\nAccording to RadarOnline, a close friend reportedly told the outlet Em has no plans to get married again and hasn’t had a serious girlfriend since his whirlwind romance with his ex.\n\n“With Kim, they were a couple when he didn’t have two nickels to rub together,” the friend claimed. “Marshall is just very distrustful of what a woman’s motivations might be for wanting to be with him.”\n\nThe pair have still maintained an amicable relationship following their romantic time together, with the friend saying Eminem will always have a special place in his heart for Kim.\n\nThe report comes a few days after the superstar became a father-in-law. His adopted daughter Alaina got married last weekend in the rapper’s hometown of Detroit, Michigan, though it’s unclear if Eminem attended the wedding.\n\nThe 30-year-old adopted daughter of the rapper, who he calls “Lainey,” married longtime boyfriend Matt Moller on June 9, and her younger sister Hailie Jade Scott was even in tow as a bridesmaid.\n\n“June 9, 2023 simply one of the best days of my life,” Alaina wrote in an Instagram post. “In this lifetime and in the next, my soul will always find yours.”\n\nEminem had previously spoken about all of his children in a candid interview with Hotboxin’ With Mike Tyson, and noted that his kids are his greatest accomplishments.\n\n“Hailie is 23,” he said. “Not babies, nope. Just a boyfriend, and she’s doing good. She’s made me proud for sure. She graduated from college, 3.9. It definitely is crazy.”\n\nHe added: “I have a niece that I have helped raise too that’s pretty much like a daughter to me and she’s 26, and then I have a younger one that’s 17 now. So when I think about my accomplishments, that’s probably the thing I’m most proud of — being able to raise kids. It’s definitely important to keep your kids grounded when there’s situations like we have.”"
