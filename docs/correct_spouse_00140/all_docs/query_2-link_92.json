        "text": "(AP) Rap megastar Eminem and his high school sweetheart divorced for a second time Tuesday, less than a year after they remarried.\n\nEminem and Kim Mathers agreed to divide property under terms of a private settlement and to share custody of their 10-year-old daughter, Hailie Jade Scott. They told a judge they understood the divorce was final.\n\nThe couple \"conducted themselves with dignity and respect,\" Circuit Judge Antonio P. Viviano said. \"All in all, they are a very fine couple to deal with.\"\n\nEminem, 34, declined to comment after the brief hearing as two men whisked him into a black Cadillac Escalade. Mathers, 31, did not speak to reporters.\n\nEminem and Mathers remarried Jan. 14. He filed for divorce April 5. They first married in 1999 in a secret ceremony in Missouri, and divorced in 2001.\n\nEminem, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, has won nine Grammy Awards, including best rap album, for \"The Slim Shady LP,\" \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" and \"The Eminem Show.\" He won an Oscar for the song \"Lose Yourself\" from \"8 Mile,\" the semi-autobiographical 2002 film in which he starred"
