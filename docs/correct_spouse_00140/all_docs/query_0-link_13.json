        "text": "Eminem has been a very private person when it comes to relationship status after his second divorce from Kim Scott, the mother of her daughter Hailie.\n\nMarshall Mathers has not been very open about the details of their separation, however, part of the artist's relationship with Kim was documented not only on his albums but it was even dramatized in his movie '8 Mile', which was somewhat autobiographical.\n\nEminem tried to make it work with the mother of his daughter\n\nAccording to Radar Online, a friend of the multiplatinum Emmy winner mentioned that \"With Kim, they were a couple when he didn't have two nickels to rub together,\".\n\nEminem and Kim met in high school and began dating in 1989, and they had their baby in 1995, then got married in 1999 but it only lasted 2 years, and then divorced only to get married again in 2006 and file for divorce a few months after.\n\n\"Marshall is just very distrustful of what a woman's motivations might be for wanting to be with him,\" the insider claimed.\n\nKim Scott did not want to 'necessarily' get divorced\n\nMeanwhile, Kim Scott did an interview on a Detroit morning show after Eminem filed for divorce and claimed that it was not her choice entirely \"I thought it was really going to be something that worked this time,\".\n\n\"I don't really necessarily want to get divorced,\" she elaborated. \"I was hoping he was going to come home and say, 'I got us a counselor, let's go.' But you know it didn't work out that way. I got an attorney at the door instead.\"\n\nEminem's PR team reached out to the public with a few comments from the artist \"The details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private, and I had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family.\"\n\n\"She was aware that I was filing for divorce, we both tried to give our marriage another chance and quickly realized that a wedding doesn't fix the underlying problems.\" The statement read."
