        "text": "The former wife of rap superstar Eminem is recovering after an apparent suicide attempt last month where she was found bleeding in her Macomb Township bathroom with a “self-made ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ request” nearby, according to the sheriff’s office.\n\nKim Scott was discovered sitting on the bloodied floor of her Macomb Township bathroom July 30, the Macomb County Sheriff’s Office said in a police report obtained by The Macomb Daily through a Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe attempt was made a week after Scott’s mother died, according to an obituary notice.\n\nDeputies who responded to a call indicating Scott, 46, may be trying to take her own life said she was found with an “unidentified object” in her hands and had a “large amount of smeared blood” from “numerous deep lacerations” on her legs,” the report stated.\n\nAn unnamed person later gave investigators a small cardboard shipping box that was found in the home.\n\n“The box was covered in haphazard messages from (name deleted) to her family, including a self-made ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ request,” deputies said in the report. “The request was adhered to the box in what appeared to be a patch of blood.”\n\nThe names of the people involved were redacted, but law enforcement sources confirm the individual involved was Scott.\n\nAccording to the three-page report, dispatchers received a call of a possible suicide attempt about 4 p.m. at the house. Deputies encountered Scott physically struggling with an unnamed person on the bathroom floor. The person appeared to be trying to restrain Scott and remove the unknown object from her hand.\n\nScott, who also had patches of blood on her white tank top, had to be restrained after she allegedly attempted to strike the responding deputy, according to the report, which noted she had “difficulty speaking, was slurring her speech and later fluctuated in various levels of consciousness.”\n\nThe deputy handcuffed Scott while joining in the effort to hold her down until medical personnel arrived.\n\nDuring that time, Scott described her attempt to die by suicide, but that information was also redacted.\n\nFirst responders from the Macomb Township Fire Department and Medstar Ambulance who arrived on the scene assisted deputies in transferring her to a medical gurney and securing both of her arms.\n\nAuthorities interviewed two people who were at the house. One said she received numerous “suspicious” text messages from Scott, stating she was in the bathroom and to not attempt to enter the room. She decided to check on the woman’s welfare.\n\nThe friend found the door was locked, so she used a large flashlight to break it open and found Scott laying in a large pool of blood. Investigators also interviewed a friend of Scott’s late mother, who said she had received “out of character” text messages from Scott and also found a purported suicide note.\n\nAn obituary notice published by the Lee-Ellena Funeral Home stated Scott’s mother, Kathleen Sluck, died July 23 in her home in Ray Township. She was 65.\n\nScott’s twin sister Dawn Scott died in 2016 of a suspected heroin overdose. She was 41.\n\nEminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, and Kim had a tumultuous relationship. They married in 1999, divorced in 2001, then remarried for a few months in 2006. They have an adult daughter together, Hailie.\n\nNeither Eminem nor Scott has commented publicly on the incident.\n\nHelp is available for those who may be experiencing suicidal thoughts. Call the 24-hour National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (800-273-8255)."
