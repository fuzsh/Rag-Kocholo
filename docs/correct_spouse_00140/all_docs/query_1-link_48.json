        "text": "Eminem has made no secret of his family feuds, often referring to them in explicit detail in his many songs over the years.\n\nBut while his fans are familiar with his strained relationships with his mother, Debbie Mathers, and ex-wife, Kim Scott, Eminem has also expressed his love for his children and has dedicated many of his hits, including \"Mockingbird\" and \"Hailie's Song\" to his biological daughter, Hailie Jade.\n\nThe \"Death of Slim Shady\" star adores being a dad and even when his fame went stratospheric, he still made sure to be present for his kids.\n\n\"Bein' a dad is definitely living a double life,\" he told Rolling Stone in 2004. \"Even before Hailie was born, I was a firm believer in freedom of speech … But once I hit them gates where I live, that's when I'm Dad.\"\n\nHe added: \"Takin' the kids to school, pickin' 'em up, teachin' 'em rules. I'm not sayin' I'm the perfect father, but the most important thing is to be there for my kids and raise them the right way.\"\n\nMeet Eminem's kids below...\n\nHailie Jade Scott, 28\n\nHailie is Eminem's biological daughter with ex-wife Kim Scott. The former couple welcomed her on Christmas Day in 1995, but separated one year later, with the rapper moving back in with his mom while Kim and Hailie lived in a one-bedroom apartment.\n\nHailie has made her dad very proud over the years, graduating from Michigan State University with a degree in psychology and a 3.9 GPA. Now 28, she has amassed a huge following on Instagram, with 3.4 million people interested in her fitness and fashion posts. She also hosts the Just a Little Shady podcast.\n\nIn March 2020, Eminem spoke publicly about Hailie on Mike Tyson's Hotboxin' podcast. When asked if she had any children of her own, he replied: \"No babies. Just a boyfriend. She’s doing good. She’s made me proud for sure.\"\n\nHailie's long-term boyfriend, Evan McLintock proposed in February 2023 and they tied the knot in May 2024.\n\nHailie and her dad are still \"very close\" and in September 2022, she spoke about her unique childhood on her podcast.\n\nWhen asked if she was bothered by people quizzing her on her dad, she replied: \"The best way to say this is yes and no … Honestly, it's to a point.\n\n\"I obviously expect it. And there's certain things I can understand why people are just genuinely curious about, as anyone would be when you've kind of grown up half in the spotlight.\"\n\nShe added: \"I feel like growing up, when it would happen, I would get more bothered by it because I was like, 'Why do people care?' I was young and I didn't totally understand the situation, so I was like, that's my dad. I don't ask you about your dad.\"\n\nAlaina Marie Scott, 31\n\nAlaina Marie is the daughter of Kim Scott's late twin sister, Dawn. Eminem adopted her after her mother struggled with drug addiction. Dawn died from an overdose in 2016 aged 41.\n\nSpeaking of Alaina Marie to Rolling Stone, Eminem previously said: \"My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born. Me and Kim pretty much had her, she'd live with us wherever we was at.\"\n\nHe also said on Mike Tyson's Hotboxin' podcast: \"I have a niece that I have helped raise, too, that's… pretty much like a daughter to me.\"\n\nNow 31, Alaina Marie has a bachelor's degree in communication with a double minor in public relations and advertising from the University of Oakland. She is a travel blogger and is vocal on social media about body positivity.\n\nIn December 2021, she got engaged to her longtime love, Matt Moeller. and the couple tied the knot on June 9, 2023, in Detroit.\n\nOf course, Eminem was present on the day and walked his daughter down the aisle. \"He wasn't going to miss that,\" she told People.\n\n“These are once-in-a-lifetime moments, and I'm just so grateful to be loved the way I am by everyone. None of this would have been possible without my dad. I'm beyond blessed.”\n\nStevie Laine Scott, 22\n\nStevie – born Whitney Scott Mathers – is Kim Scott's biological child from her relationship with tattoo artist Eric Harttner, who died in 2020 aged 40. Eminem adopted them in 2005 after he and Kim rekindled their relationship, four years after their divorce.\n\nIn August 2021, Stevie announced on TikTok that they identify as non-binary and shared their new name.\n\nStevie is in a long-distance relationship with TikToker Declan Jace.\n\nMeet the rest of Eminem's family below...\n\nKim Scott, 49\n\nKim Scott first met Eminem at a party when she was just 13 years old, and he was 15. Their friendship soon blossomed into romance, and they officially became an item in 1989. One year after moving into his mom's trailer, Kim gave birth to daughter Hailie Jade.\n\nOne year later, the couple split and stayed apart for three years before rekindling their romance and getting married in 1999, but by 2001, Eminem had filed for divorce.\n\nHowever, in January 2006, the on-again-off-again couple decided to give their relationship another go and married for a second time, only for Eminem to file for divorce three months later, which was finalized in an out-of-court settlement in December of that same year.\n\n\"There was a lot of sadness about why this didn't work out. They've been together for 17 years,\" Kim's attorney Michael J. Smith told People at the time.\n\n\"They're life-long friends, lovers, have been husband and wife, they're raising children together ... It's not the end and it's not over between them.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Kim is doing great. She is a very articulate, very smart woman. She is going back to college to study design. She just wants to be a mom and go back to college. That's what she wants to do right now.\"\n\nSiblings\n\nEminem has a half-brother named Nathan, who was born in 1986 to his mom Debbie, and her ex-husband Fred Samara. When Nathan was just 16 years old, Eminem gained legal custody of him after he was placed in foster care.\n\n“When he was taken away I always said if I ever get in a position to take him, I would take him,” Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2004.\n\n“He was the best role model I could have had to help me be the dad that I am today,” Nathan said on Hailie Jade's podcast in February 2023.\n\nNathan is now 38 and works as a DJ, music producer, and actor. He has three children with his long-time partner Ashley, whom he married in 2018.\n\nSarah Mathers is Eminem's half-sister, with the duo sharing the same dad, Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. Sarah is said to have reached out to her famous half-sibling after she discovered his identity in 2005 but has yet to receive a response. She lives in California.\n\nDebbie Mathers, 69\n\nDebbie Mathers – née Nelson – gave birth to Eminem when she was 17. Eminem has made no secret of their fractured relationship and rapped about it in many of his earlier hits.\n\nBack in 1999, Debbie filed a lawsuit demanding $10 million from her son for her name being slandered in his song, My Name Is. In 2001, the case was settled for just $25,000, with only $1,600 going to Debbie, and the other $23,354.25 going to her former attorney.\n\nIn 2013, Eminem revealed he had forgiven his mother for her wrongdoings and apologized to her in his song, Headlights.\n\nMarshall Bruce Mathers Jr.\n\nEminem did not have a close relationship with his father, Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr., who died of a heart attack in 2019 when he was just 67 years old.\n\nAccording to Eminem's mom, Debbie, she and Bruce married when she was 15 and he was 22. Two years later they welcomed Eminem – born Marshall Bruce Mathers III – but Bruce left the family shortly after.\n\nThe Real Slim Shady hitmaker previously revealed that when he tried to write letters to his dad, they would return unopened, and once he became famous, he had no interest in a relationship with him."
