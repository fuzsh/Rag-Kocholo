The bride-to-be wore numerous looks throughout the evening, starting with a halter-top white dress before changing into a black top and dark pants, and another look that featured sparkling pants, a feathered white jacket and a bandeau top.\n\nThe ‚ÄúReal Slim Shady‚Äù performer, 50, and Mathers met at a house party in 1988 when he was 15 years old and she was 13 when she had just gotten out of a youth home after she and her sister escaped their father‚Äôs abuse.\n\nFor more Page Six you love‚Ä¶\n\nListen to our weekly ‚ÄúWe Hear‚Äù podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nMathers moved into Eminem‚Äôs house with his mom, Debbie Nelson, but when their romance began Nelson kicked them out.\n\nMathers became pregnant in 1995 and the couple welcomed Hailie on Christmas Day that year. The pair married in 1999 but divorced two years later. They briefly reconciled in 2006 but ultimately split again.\n\n‚ÄúMoney is great, but it doesn‚Äôt make your husband stay at home with you,‚Äù Mathers said in an interview with ‚Äú20/20‚Äù . ‚ÄúOr sleep in the same bed with you ‚Ä¶ Him being on the road and on tour ‚Ä¶ that was like the big one. I mean ‚Ä¶ constant infidelities, all the time.‚Äù\n\nA decade after their split, Eminem apologized to his ex-wife on the track ‚ÄúBad Husband.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI loved you / but I hated that me / And I don‚Äôt wanna see that side again / But I‚Äôm sorry, Kim / More than you could ever comprehend,‚Äù he rapped."
