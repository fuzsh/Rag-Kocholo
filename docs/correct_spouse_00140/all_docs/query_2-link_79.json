        "text": "Eminem’s adopted daughter celebrated her happy day, but Alaina Scott, who was just his niece before his sister-in-law died, spent most of her life rising above tragedy.\n\nThe legendary lyrical wordsmith’s oldest child Alaina Scott, 30, married the love of her life, Matt Moeller, on June 9. The wedding took place in Detroit, Michigan, alongside 125 of their closest family and friends. Alaina’s sister Hailie Jade was a bridesmaid for the joyous occasion.\n\n“June 9, 2023, simply one of the best days of my life🤍 in this lifetime and in the next, my soul will always find yours🌹,” Alaina raved over her nuptials on social media alongside snapshots of the event.\n\nThe beaming bride had her happiest day, but she lived through a troubled upbringing in her younger years. Her mother, Dawn Scott, battled drug addiction and later died in 2016 from a suspected heroin overdose. Dawn is the twin sister of Kim Scott, Eminem’s ex-wife.\n\nDawn lambasted Eminem just months before she died, claiming that he never aided her with her issues.\n\n“I have a millionaire brother-in-law and a sister with money up the ass, but they’re refusing to give me any help,” she told RadarOnline.\n\nDawn was 41 years old at the time of her passing and her boyfriend Les Martin told the publication that she made desperate phone calls to Kim in the year before her death.\n\n“I’ve been trying like hell to save her life,” Martin said. “I’ve had numerous conversations with Kim about trying to get her help and it just wasn’t a conversation she wanted to have. She wanted to let Dawn go.”\n\nLike Alaina’s mother Dawn, Eminem had his own struggles with addiction. He has been sober since 2007 after overdosing on methadone, and he credits his children with helping him stay on the straight and narrow. In 2010, he gave the New York Times an interview about his battle with addiction.\n\n“I didn’t know it was methadone. I used to get pills wherever I could,” he said. “I was just taking anything that anybody was giving to me.”\n\nThe rapper added that his family has been supportive of his sobriety. “I love them so much and they’ve helped me through so many things,” he said.\n\nEminem is a father of three. While the “8 Mile” star — born Marshall Mathers — adopted Alaina and Stevie in the early 2000s, Hailie is his only biological daughter.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about Eminem’s three children.\n\nAlaina Marie Scott\n\nAlaina is the daughter of Kim’s twin sister, Dawn. The “Rap God” crooner adopted her in the 2000s.\n\n“I have full custody of my niece,” Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2004. “My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born. Me and Kim pretty much had her, she’d live with us wherever we was at.”\n\nThe Oscar winner often calls Alaina “Lainey.” Alaina, born in 1993, went to Oakland University and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communication with a double minor in public relations and advertising.\n\nShe got engaged to Moeller in December 2021, writing on social media at the time: “This moment. this life❤️ yes a hundred times over. I LOVE YOU!”\n\nThey got married earlier this month, after seven years of dating.\n\nHailie Jade Scott\n\nThe 27-year-old is the “Just Lose It” rapper’s only biological child, whom he shares with his ex, Kim Scott. He and Scott married in 1999 and divorced in 2001. However, they remarried in 2006, but were together for just four months.\n\nHailie was born on Christmas Day in 1995 and has long been the inspiration behind several of her dad’s hit records, including “Mockingbird” and “Hailie’s Song.”\n\nHailie graduated from Michigan State University with a psychology degree and a 3.9 GPA.\n\nEminem gushed over his middle child on a 2020 episode of “Hotboxin’ With Mike Tyson,” saying: “She’s made me proud for sure.”\n\n“So when I think about my accomplishments, like, that’s probably the thing that I’m the most proud of, you know, is that — is being able to raise kids,” he said.\n\nShe then spoke about how close she is with her father on her “Just a Little Shady” podcast in 2022, revealing how she has happy memories from her childhood.\n\n“I always think about that time we went to Florida, my dad was working on something, and he set up for us to do, like, the limo and take it to Disney and we did the princess tea party, and he had the dresses waiting for us,” she recalled.\n\nHailie went on: “At the time, we were so happy and so excited, but we didn’t get to appreciate that moment as much as now when we talk about it and think back on it.”\n\nHailie announced her engagement to longtime beau Evan McClintock this past February and posted the sweet news on Instagram, showing off her glistening rock and proposal.\n\nStevie Scott\n\nEminem’s youngest adopted daughter is Stevie, who was born in 2002 to Kim and her boyfriend, Eric Hartter.\n\nWhile Hartter passed away in 2019, the Grammy winner legally adopted Stevie in 2005.\n\nIn August 2021, Stevie, 21, announced that they were nonbinary, taking to TikTok to share the news. “Forever growing and changing,” they captioned the clip, adding the hashtags “#genderfluid” and “#bi.”"
