        "text": "Tell a friend: Shady’s a father-in-law for the second time. Rapper Eminem, real name Marshall Bruce Mathers III, celebrated the wedding of his daughter Hailie Scott over the weekend. Scott married her longtime boyfriend Evan McClintock a little less than a year after Eminen’s oldest daughter, Alaina, tied the knot.\n\n“None of this would have been possible without my dad,” Alaina told People in June 2023 following her wedding to Matt Moeller.\n\nNow 51, Eminem has had a tumultuous career and personal life, including a battle with drug addiction and his rocky relationship with ex-wife Kim Scott, whom he married and divorced twice. But one continuous source of pride and happiness for the 15-time Grammy winner is his role as a father. “When I think about my accomplishments, like, that’s probably the thing I’m most proud of, you know, is being able to raise kids,” he said on an episode of the Hotboxin’ with Mike Tyson podcast.\n\nAlong with Alaina and Hailie, Eminem is also a father to Stevie. Here’s what the relationships between all three kids and the rap legend are like and what Eminem’s children are doing today.\n\nAlaina Marie Scott\n\nAlaina, 31, was born February 22, 1993, to Dawn Scott, Kim’s sister. According to People, Eminem legally adopted his niece in the early 2000s as her mother struggled with drug abuse. Dawn died in January 2016 from a suspected heroin overdose.\n\nAlaina, or “Lainey,” attended Oakland University and earned a degree in communication with a double minor in advertising and public relations. She regularly posts about travel and fashion for her 116,000 or so Instagram followers and runs Lanes Book Club. In 2021, she got engaged to now-husband Matt Moeller. Her dad walked her down the aisle at the couple’s June 2023 wedding.\n\nEminem has referenced Alaina in his music, including the 2004 hit “Mockingbird” and considers her one of his biological children. “My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born,” the rapper told Rolling Stone in 2004. “Me and Kim pretty much had her, she’d live with us wherever we was at.”\n\nAlaina is also close with her sister, Hailie, who got engaged in February 2023. “She’s crushing her career right now, crushing being one of my Maid of Honors, crushing her podcast, and everything else that she touches. I have no doubt you’ll crush being a wife, too,” Alaina wrote of Hailie in an Instagram post at the time.\n\nHailie Jade Scott\n\nHailie Jade Scott attends the 2022 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in Los Angeles.\n\nHailie, 28, is Eminem’s daughter with his ex-wife Kim Scott. She was born on December 25, 1995, in Detroit. Six years later, Eminem said her birth was “a real wakeup call” that forced him to make something of his life.\n\nHailie is well on her way to doing just that. She attended Chippewa Valley High School and was a member of the National Honor Society and volleyball team. She earned a psychology degree from Michigan State University with a 3.9 GPA, and , aptly titled Just a Little Shady, has around 129,000 followers on Instagram and 155,000 subscribers on YouTube. She also has a clothing line in connection with the podcast, including hats, T-shirts, and other items.\n\nThe podcaster shared the news about her recent nuptials to Evan McClintock on Instagram. “Evan and I are feeling so grateful for all of the family & friends that traveled to support us and be a part of this new chapter of our lives as husband & wife,” Hailie wrote.\n\nLike Alaina, Hailie is referenced in her father’s music. On her podcast, Hailie revealed she was sometimes bothered by all of the questions she received about her famous dad while growing up. “I obviously expect it. And there’s certain things I can understand why people are just genuinely curious about, as anyone would be when you’ve kind of grown up half in the spotlight,” she said, according to People. “I was young, and I didn’t totally understand the situation, so I was like, that’s my dad. I don’t ask you about your dad.”\n\nToday, the two are very close. They attended the 2022 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony together, when Eminem was enshrined as a member.\n\nStevie Laine Scott\n\nStevie is the 22-year-old child of Kim Scott and her ex-boyfriend Eric Hartter. The pair dated after Kim and Eminem’s first divorce. The rapper legally adopted Stevie in 2005 just prior to his second marriage to Kim. According to the Daily Mail, Hartter died in 2019 from a cocaine and fentanyl overdose.\n\nStevie came out as nonbinary in , revealing they use all pronouns. They received a lot of support from fans, later recording a video of gratitude. They are currently in a relationship with TikToker Declan Jace and regularly post about their relationship ."
