        "text": "Tara Reid is an American actress best known for her roles in popular teen films like American Pie and Van Wilder. She also appeared in the critically panned yet culturally significant Sharknado series.\n\nDuring 2004, Eminem was rumored to be dating Reid. He also suggested he'd hooked up with Reid in a song lyric.\n\nKarrine Steffans is an American author known for her highly publicized romantic link-ups with celebrities and her memoir Confessions of a Video Vixen, and other books like The Vixen Manual: How to Find, Seduce & Keep the Man You Want. She gained early popularity as a video vixen in several hip-hop music videos.\n\nIn her memoir, Steffans wrote about famous musicians she allegedly had sexual relationships with, but Eminem wasn't among them. Still, unsubstantiated rumors suggest the two had a relationship.\n\nBritney Spears is a celebrated pop icon, famous for her hit singles like \"Baby One More Time\" and \"Toxic.\" Spears, who began her career as a child star on Disney's Mickey Mouse Club, has had a highly successful musical career studded with personal challenges.\n\nThere were rumors, never confirmed, that Spears and Eminem dated briefly. Spears does not mention dating or being involved with Eminem in her memoir, The Woman in Me.\n\nIn an interview, Eminem described Spears as “dressing trashy” and worried how that would affect young girls who are fans of the singer, like his daughter.\n\nMurphy was a well-known American actress and singer, known for her roles in films like Clueless, 8 Mile, and Sin City. She died mysteriously at age 32 in 2009.\n\nEminem and Murphy starred together in the 2002 film 8 Mile. They reportedly were close, and always spoke well of each other.\n\nWhen Murphy was on David Letterman's show in 2002 to promote the movie, the host asked her if she'd had an off-screen relationship with Eminem as well as an on-screen one.\n\nMurphy, laughing, replied, “Yep, yeah… sure…” Letterman said, “There was an actual relationship - more than… friends is what you're saying,” and she responded, “Sure.” She then added, “He’s a friend of mine… I adore him and I have nothing but wonderful memories, and he's a wonderful father, and very loving, and one of the hardest workers I've ever met in my life… and funny as the day is long.”\n\nAccording to E! News, Taryn Manning, who also starred in 8 Mile, said in the 2021 HBO documentary What Happened, Brittany Murphy?\" that a relationship “was speculated.”\n\nAfter Murphy's death in 2009, Eminem told Vibe, “It’s crazy because at one point we were very close and she was a really good person.”"
