        "text": "Kim was born in 1975 in Warren, Michigan.\n\nKim Scott and Eminem started their relationship in 1988.\n\nEminem and Kim had two marriages, first in 1999 and then in 2006.\n\nKim Scott, also known as Kimberly Ann Scott, was born in Warren, Michigan, in 1975. Her relationship with Eminem started at a house party in 1988 when they were teenagers, and it went through many ups and downs over nearly two decades.\n\nEminem, famous for his rhythmic raps, found inspiration in his relationship with Kim for songs like “Kim,” “’97 Bonnie & Clyde,” and “Love The Way You Lie,” reflecting both the love and turbulent aspects of their connection.\n\nDespite the challenges, Eminem and Kim became parents to their daughter, Hailie Jade Scott, in 1995. After their divorce in 2007, co-parenting became a shared responsibility, and Hailie has spoken positively about both parents, acknowledging their influence on her life.\n\nEminem and Kim had two marriages, first in 1999 and then in 2006, with a final divorce in 2007. Despite their love-hate dynamic, they remained life-long friends, as confirmed by Kim’s attorney.\n\nKim faced difficulties post-divorce, including struggles with substance abuse and depression. In 2015, she made headlines for a car crash involving prescription pills and alcohol, shedding light on her ongoing journey with mental health challenges.\n\nAlthough their romantic relationship ended, Eminem and Kim prioritize co-parenting their children. In a 2016 interview, Kim mentioned they remained close friends, dedicated to providing a normal setting for their kids. Their commitment to their children’s well-being goes beyond the challenges of their past."
