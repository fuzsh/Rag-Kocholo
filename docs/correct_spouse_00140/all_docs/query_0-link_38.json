        "text": "Super Bow halftime performer Eminem has never been one to shy away from discussing his personal life in his music, with the rapper having released several tracks over the years that have referenced such.\n\nThe musician, 49, - whose real name is Marshall Mathers - has become a notable figure within the music industry since his debut album was released more than two decades ago.\n\nAnd among lyrical references to fellow celebrities, the Grammy Award winner has also been known to mention his family life, including his now ex-wife Kimberly Anne Scott, 47.\n\nThe former couple, who met when they were teenagers, are understood to have began an on-off relationship in 1989.\n\nThey subsequently got married a decade later in 1999.\n\nA years prior to the marriage, the pair had received an unforgettable gift on Christmas Day in 1995, with the birth of their daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, now 26.\n\nThe relationship between Marshall and Kim is believed to have had its challenges, with him referencing his partner in the track '97 Bonnie & Clyde, which was released in 1998.\n\nThe fictional lyrics document the disposal of her body in a lake, with the narrative of the track following Marshall as him and his infant daughter travel to the pier where it happens.\n\nThe relationship later drew further attention with the track Kim, which was released in 2000. It's understood to be a prequel to '97 Bonnie & Clyde.\n\nThe lyrics reflect anger towards Kim, with the track said to conclude with the rapper killing her, before putting her body in the trunk of his car - leading up to the other track.\n\nThe couple separated when their daughter was a child, with their first divorce said to have been finalised in 2001.\n\nIt was reported at the time that they had joint custody of Hailie.\n\nThey later remarried briefly for a couple of months in 2006.\n\nMarshall's love life has remained under wraps since his last divorce from Kim more than a decade ago.\n\nIt's understood that the musician has two adoptive children - the eldest being Alaina Scott, now 28. She's the daughter of Kim's late sister Dawn Scott, who died in 2016.\n\nSpeaking about her in 2004, he said: \"My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born.\n\n\"Me and Kim pretty much had her, she'd live with us wherever we was at.\"\n\nAnd he is also said to have adopted Stevie Mathers, now 19.\n\nThe teenager, who came out as non-binary last year, is understood to be the child of Kim and a former partner.\n\nAlthough he's remained quiet about parts of his life in recent years, Marshall has continued to reference such, including on the track I'm Going Through Changes.\n\nDo you enjoy reading about celebrities?

We just could never get it together.\"\n\nHe later further recalled his relationship with Kim in the track Bad Husband, released in 2017. It's understood to act as an apology to his ex-wife for his previous behaviour.\n\nThe lyrics of the track read: \"I loved you, but I hated that me. And I don't wanna see that side again. But I'm sorry, Kim. More than you could ever comprehend.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell? Get in touch with us at webcelebs@trinitymirror.com or call us direct 0207 29 33033."
