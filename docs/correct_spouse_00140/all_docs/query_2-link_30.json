        "text": "Wedding occurs five years after ugly divorce ruptured turbulent relationship\n\nEminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III, and Kimberly Mathers exchanged vows in a small and tightly guarded ceremony at Meadow Brook Hall in Rochester Hills, near Detroit.\n\nROCHESTER HILLS, Mich. - Rapper Eminem and his former wife remarried Saturday, five years after an ugly divorce ruptured their turbulent relationship.\n\nEminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III, and Kimberly Mathers exchanged vows in a small and tightly guarded ceremony at Meadow Brook Hall in Rochester Hills, near Detroit.\n\nJournalists and fans crowded the entrance to the grounds around the hall -- a popular wedding site on the Oakland University campus -- as guests began arriving in the afternoon.\n\nLittle information was available from inside but Eminem’s publicist, Dennis Dennehy, confirmed to Reuters that the wedding had taken place.\n\nAmong other guests, rapper 50 Cent’s G-Unit hip-hop group arrived in an entourage of four sport utility vehicles.\n\nEminem, 33, arrived in a black limousine, sporting a red baseball hat.\n\nThe hip-hop superstar, whose 2000 hit “Kim” is a graphic rap fantasy about his wife’s death, told a Detroit radio station last month the couple had reconciled and would probably remarry.\n\nThe Mathers first married in 1999 and their divorce, which prompted a custody battle over their 10-year-old daughter, was finalized in 2001.\n\nLast year, Eminem was treated for addiction to a sleep medication and had to cancel his European tour. His greatest hits collection, “Curtain Call,” was released in December.\n\nEminem has denied he plans to retire but suggested he could take a break from recording and performing.\n\n“I’m at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don’t know where my career is going right now,” he told Detroit radio station WKQI-FM last month in the only interview he granted to promote the album.\n\nEminem files for divorce after less than 3 months\n\nPosted 4/5/2006 2:33 PM\n\nDETROIT (AP) — Eminem filed divorce papers Wednesday, less than three months after remarrying his high school sweetheart, Kim Mathers.\n\nThe filing on behalf of Marshall Bruce Mathers III was confirmed by two employees of the Macomb County clerk's office. They didn't provide their names, citing an office policy.\n\nThe Grammy- and Oscar-winning rapper and Kim Mathers were married on Jan. 14, a month after the couple announced they were getting back together.\n\nTheir first marriage ended after two-plus years in October 2001 in an ugly legal fight that included a custody battle over their daughter.\n\nEminem and Kim Mathers reconciled in late 2004, and he announced in December 2005 that the two would get back together.\n\nThe pair grew up in the suburbs along 8 Mile Road, Detroit's northern border.\n\nMessages seeking comment were left Wednesday with Dennis Dennehy, Eminem's publicist.\n\nThe filing adds to what has been a turbulent time for the 33-year-old superstar entertainer.\n\nIn August, it was announced that he had entered a hospital to undergo treatment for sleep medication dependency. A month prior to that, Eminem denied reports that he was preparing to retire from recording.\n\nEminem rose to pop stardom by delivering a number of best-selling CDs, deeply personal lyrics and a starring role in the film 8 Mile.\n\nAlong the way, he picked up awards and a devoted following attracted both to his abilities on the mic as well as his juicy life story: A transient childhood spent mostly in Detroit and its suburbs; a series of dead-end jobs; contentious relationships with Kim Mathers and his mother; and an undying love of his daughter.\n\nI'm really not surprised. I couldn't understand why they remarried in the first place, considering how tumultuous their relationship can be\n\nEminem, wife duel over split details\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/07/eminem.divorce.ap/index.html\n\nOne day after Eminem filed divorce papers, and 83 days after they remarried, Kim Mathers called a Detroit-area morning show to tell her side of the story.\n\n\"He's having problems with, you know, his problem that he had,\" she said, an apparent reference to the sleep-medication dependency for which Eminem was hospitalized last summer. \"I was hoping we could get counseling and work it out, you know? ...\n\n\"Right after he came home from his rehab, we started to have a few problems, and I thought it was going to be in our best interest to delay the wedding,\" said Mathers, who was remarried January 14 to her high school sweetheart.\n\n\"But he really pushed it and I thought it was really going to be something that worked this time,\" she said.\n\nEminem, however, has not spoken with her in about six weeks, she said, and surprised her by having her served with divorce papers.\n\n\"I don't really necessarily want to get divorced,\" said Mathers, whose first marriage to Eminem lasted from 1999 to 2001. \"I was hoping he was going to come home and say, 'I got us a counselor, let's go.' But you know it didn't work out that way. I got an attorney at the door instead.\"\n\nIn a statement released Thursday afternoon through his publicist, Eminem said: \"The details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private, and I had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family. However, a few of Kim's statements in a radio interview this morning need to be addressed.\n\n\"First, her allegations regarding my status post-rehab are both untrue and unfortunate. Second, she was aware that I was filing for divorce. We both tried to give our marriage another chance and quickly realized that a wedding doesn't fix the underlying problems.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old rapper, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, remarried Kimberley Anne Scott a month after the couple announced they had reconciled and were getting back together. The pair grew up in the suburbs along Eight Mile Road, Detroit's northern border.\n\nEminem has won nine Grammys, including best rap album for \"The Slim Shady LP,\" \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" and \"The Eminem Show.\" He won an Oscar for the song \"Lose Yourself\" from \"8 Mile,\" the semi-autobiographical 2002 film in which he starred."
