        "text": "EMINEM gained mainstream popularity in 1999 following the release of his album, The Slim Shady LP.\n\nSince then, he has continued his rise on the hip-hop scene, during which time, he has been linked to several high-profile celebrities.\n\nWho is Eminem dating?\n\nEminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, is thought to be single.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, the rapper said that it's hard for him to find someone that he can trust.\n\n\"I mean, I'd like to be in a relationship again someday. Who doesn't? It's just hard to meet new people, in my position,\" he said.\n\n\"I have trust issues. With women, friends, whatever. You always wonder what their real motives are.\"\n\nHe added, \"I've got a small circle of friends, and it's a lot of the same friends I've known forever. Right now, that works for me.\"\n\nWho are Eminem's ex-wife and past girlfriends?\n\nOver the years, Eminem has only tied the knot with one woman.\n\nHe was married to Kimberly \"Kim\" Scott from 1999 to 2001 and then again briefly in 2006.\n\nThey began dating in 1989 after meeting in high school.\n\nDuring that time, Kim lived with Eminem's mother, Debbie Nelson, because she and her twin sister, Dawn, ran away from home to reportedly escape their alcoholic stepfather, according to Page Six.\n\n“I met her the day she got out of the youth home,” Eminem recalled during a 2004 interview with Rolling Stone.\n\n“I was at a friend’s house, and his sister was friends with her, but she hadn’t seen Kim in a while ’cause she was in the youth home. And I’m standing on the table with my shirt off, on top of their coffee table with a Kangol on, mocking the words to LL Cool J’s ‘I’m Bad.’ And I turn around and she’s at the door. Her friend hands her a cigarette.”\n\nHe added: “I said to my friend’s sister, ‘Yo, who was that? She’s kinda hot.’ And the saga began. Now there’s the constant struggle of ‘will I ever meet somebody else that’s gonna be real with me, as real as I can say she’s been with me?’”\n\nFriends said that the pair were meant for each other, but ultimately life got in the way.\n\n“Money is great, but it doesn’t make your husband stay at home with you,” Kim said during a 2007 interview with 20/20.\n\n“Or sleep in the same bed with you … Him being on the road and on tour … that was like the big one. I mean … constant infidelities, all the time.”\n\nAfter Eminem parted ways with Kim, he went on to have multiple relationships.\n\nHis ex-girlfriends, according to Ranker, include:\n\nKaya Jones\n\nBritney Spears\n\nBrittany Murphy\n\nMariah Carey\n\nKarrine Steffans\n\nTara Reid\n\nDoes Eminem have kids?\n\nDuring Eminem and Kim's relationship, they welcomed one daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers.\n\nShe was born on December 25, 1995, in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nEminem calls Hailie his \"proudest achievement\" and often expresses his pride in his music and on social media.\n\nIn 2002, Eminem released the song Hailie's Song, in which he says she kept him from going \"crazy.\"\n\n\"My baby girl (girl) (Hailie laughs) keeps gettin’ older (der) / I watch her grow up with pride,\" he raps."
