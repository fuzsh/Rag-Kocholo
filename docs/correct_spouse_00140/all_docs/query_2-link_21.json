        "text": "“I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again,” Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002. This week, the Detroit rapper may be wondering why he did not heed his own words.\n\nIn yet another verse of the very public saga between Eminem (born Marshall Mathers III) and Kim, the hip-hop superstar has filed for divorce from the erstwhile Mrs. Mathers — less than three months after the couple remarried. A representative from Eminem’s label Interscope confirmed that the rapper has filed divorce papers with the Macomb County clerk’s office in Michigan.\n\nThe couple grew up in the suburbs of Detroit along Eight Mile Road, and went on to marry in 1999. Their tumultuous relationship became the subject of many of the rapper’s vitriolic verses. In the song “Kim,” off 2000’s The Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem accused his then-wife (for the first time) of infidelity, repeatedly called her a “bitch” and fantasized about violently murdering her. “You really fucked me, Kim/You really did a number on me,” he rapped. Shortly after the album’s release, Kim attempted suicide.\n\nTrending\n\nIn 2001, Eminem and Kim divorced bitterly, entwined in a heated custody battle over their now ten-year-old daughter Hailie. But the couple somehow reconciled, and went on to remarry last January.\n\nLast summer, Eminem cut short the European leg of his blockbuster Anger Management 3 tour — with fellow rap star 50 Cent — in order to enter rehab for addiction to sleeping pills. He shortly thereafter released his first hits compilation, Curtain Call, amid speculation about his retirement from the music industry. Curtain Call has since sold two million copies."
