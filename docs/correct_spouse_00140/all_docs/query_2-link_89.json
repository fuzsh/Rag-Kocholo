The couple were married in 1999, divorced in 2001, remarried on January 14 this year and filed for divorce on April 15. They told the judge they understood the divorce was final, and had \"conducted themselves with dignity and respect\", he said.\n\nEminem, 34, declined to comment after the hearing as two men whisked him into a black Cadillac."
