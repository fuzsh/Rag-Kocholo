She is most famously known as the ex-wife of rapper Marshal Mathers, also known as Eminem. Her net worth has mainly accumulated from her association with Eminem, potentially from settlements and royalties.\n\nKimberly met Eminem when she was 13 years old, and they formed a relationship growing up in the Mathers household. Their relationship endured many problems and became publicly known through Eminemâs music. They had a child and were married for six years before getting divorced. Despite their rocky relationship, Kim and their daughter have been seen alongside Eminem for various tours.\n\nKim has had run-ins with the law due to DUI, and she has another daughter from a relationship during her time of separation from Eminem. Notably, her twin sister passed away from a drug overdose in January 2016, and Eminem and Kim adopted her daughter.\n\nFor further details, visit the original article.\n\nStructural information:\n\nâ Net Worth: $2 Million\n\nâ Date Of Birth: January 9, 1975\n\nâ Place Of Birth: Warren, Michigan USA\n\nâ Nationality: American\n\nâ Spouse: Eminem (m. 2006â2006), Eminem (m. 1999â2001)\n\nâ Children: Hailie Jade, Alaina Marie Mathers, Whitney Scott Mathers, Parker Scott\n\nâ Parents: Kathleen Sluck\n\nâ Siblings: Dawn Scott\n\nâ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Kim-Mathers-330813183421\n\nâ Twitter: https://twitter.com/kimberly__scott?lang=en\n\nâ IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/name/\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiioqVdoq61tMSrqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o"
