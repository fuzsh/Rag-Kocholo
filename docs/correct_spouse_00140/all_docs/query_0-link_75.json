        "text": "Eminem is an American rapper.\n\nKim met Eminem at a house party at 13.\n\nEminem and Kim Scott met as teenagers in 1988.\n\nEminem and Kim Scott’s tumultuous relationship has been marked by two marriages and divorces. The couple first met as teenagers in 1988 and experienced an on-again, off-again relationship for nearly two decades.\n\nThey married in 1999, divorced in 2001, remarried in 2006, and divorced again in 2007. They share a daughter, Hailie Jade Scott, born in 1995.\n\nKim, who grew up in Michigan, met Eminem at a house party when she was 13. Eminem’s mother took her in shortly after they started dating.\n\nThe couple’s relationship inspired several of Eminem’s songs, though not all in a positive light. Kim has struggled with substance abuse and depression, notably surviving a suicide attempt in 2015.\n\nDespite their rocky history, Eminem and Kim remain close friends, focused on co-parenting their children, including Hailie and their adopted daughters, Alaina and Stevie. Kim has since stepped out of the spotlight, prioritizing her role as a mother and pursuing college studies in design."
