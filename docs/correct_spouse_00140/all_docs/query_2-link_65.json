        "text": "By Pretty Honore\n\nJan. 12 2024, Published 2:20 p.m. ET\n\nIn 2000, the Real Slim Shady stood up and turned the rap industry on its head. The rapper was at the helm of a raps-to-riches story that inspired the world. More than 20 years after his rise to fame, Eminem’s name still rings bells.\n\nLately, Em’s music career has taken a backseat but that hasn’t stopped the widespread curiosity about his personal life. His career has been riddled with controversy, from trouble with the law to beef with other rappers.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAlso, the rapper's dating life has been at the center of attention throughout his career — especially since he has been linked to a long list of celebrities. So, who has Eminem dated? Read on for a rundown of his dating history.\n\nMeet Eminem’s ex-wife — Kimberly Anne Scott.\n\nOut of all the beef that Eminem has been embroiled in over the years, his feud with his baby mama, Kim Scott, tops the chart as the most brutal. The two met in high school and later welcomed their daughter, Hailey.\n\nThey got married in 1999 but split just two years later. However, their love story didn’t end there. The two later remarried in 2006 but their relationship came to an end for good that same year.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nEminem spent a wholesome evening with U.K. actress Joy McAvoy.\n\nAlthough Eminem never explicitly confirmed that he was entangled with Avengers actor Joy McAvoy, she spilled all the tea about their brief encounter in an interview with the Daily Record in an article titled “I Was a Lady With Slim Shady” in 2001.\n\nAt the time, Joy described herself as a “huge fan” of the rapper. According to her, they didn’t consummate their situationship, but they did kiss, cuddle, and have a heart-to-heart.\n\n\"We talked about relationships and he told me how difficult it was for him to have a serious relationship because of his fame,” she said.\n\nJoy added, \"We spent the entire night in his hotel.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nEminem and Brittany Murphy’s romance blossomed on the set of ‘8 Mile.’\n\nEminem and Brittany Murphy were lovers both on and off the set of their 2002 film 8 Mile. She shared the truth about their relationship during an interview with David Letterman. According to her, their romance “cаme аnd went.\"\n\nThe actor went on to marry Simon Monjack in 2007 and sadly died in 2009.\n\nEminem and Mariah Carey’s breakup nearly broke the internet.\n\nBefore Mariah Carey got married to Nick Cannon, she had a fling with Eminem. The two dated for six months in 2001. All hell broke loose after they broke up and their years-long celebrity feud began.\n\nNot only did Eminem shade her in several interviews, but he also dissed her on a few of her songs.\n\nBut Mariah didn’t take the disrespect lying down.\n\nThe video for her 2009 single, “Obsessed,” featured an Eminem doppleganger that was giving serious Joe Goldberg vibes. He later fired back at Mariah with his song, “The Warning.”\n\nSince then, Eminem hasn’t made any of his romantic relationships public — and he should probably keep it that way!"
