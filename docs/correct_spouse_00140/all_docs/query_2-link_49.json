        "text": "EMINEM's ex-wife Kim Mathers is offloading her humble home for just under $540,000 as she downsizes for the second time.\n\nThe 49-year-old sold her six-bed, seven-bath Detroit mansion, which was reportedly built by Eminem for their children, back in March 2023 for $1.35million.\n\nShe then bought a four-bed, three-bath property in a different area as most of her children had left home.\n\nDocuments show the home was bought with a large loan of $615,000 from Shady Games, Inc., with the president, treasurer, and secretary listed as Marshall Mathers.\n\nThe U.S. Sun can reveal she has now put the house on the market.\n\nThe mom-of-four, who prefers to stay out of the spotlight, purchased a smaller home a year ago for just $410,000.\n\nThe five-bed, three-bath home is just one story and Kim does not appear to have taken a mortgage out.\n\nKim had a tumultuous relationship with her childhood sweetheart, whose real name is Marshall Mathers.\n\nThey were married from 1999 to 2001 and then again briefly in 2006 before they split for good.\n\nDespite their messy history, Kim previously confirmed to The U.S. Sun they are now on good terms for the sake of their kids, although they don't see each other regularly.\n\nNEW LOOK\n\nThe U.S. Sun published exclusive images of Kim in 2023 as she was seen for the first time in five years with a surprising new look.\n\nKim now has a rockstar look and showcased her slim frame in a halterneck backless denim jumpsuit.\n\nShe is heavily tattooed with new inkings down her arms and displayed on her neck.\n\nThe reclusive ex-wife of superstar rapper Eminem was seen outside her home wearing black boots as she loaded her car with items.\n\nAlong with 28-year-old Hailie Jade, Kim also has a child Stevie, 22, who identifies as non-binary, and a son, Parker, who is believed to be in his teens, from other relationships.\n\nShe and Eminem also adopted her late sister Dawn Scott's daughter, Aliana, now 31, whose mom died in 2016 from a heroin overdose following years of drug abuse.\n\nKim and her ex reunited for their daughter Aliana's wedding last year and will come together again as the rapper walks Hailie down the aisle in the coming months.\n\nDAUGHTER'S WEDDING\n\nShe is set to marry her long-term boyfriend, Evan McClintock, and celebrated her bachelorette party in Tampa, Florida, recently, although she is keeping the wedding date a secret.\n\nHailie shared several photographs on Instagram on April 17 showing her posing in a white bikini while on a boat with friends, who were all in black swimsuits.\n\nHer sister Alaina commented underneath the post, writing, \"This ain't TX, WOOOOO, the best time celebrating you.\"\n\nAlthough Evan popped the question in February 2023, he asked for her dad's blessing months before.\n\nAppearing on her Just A Little Shady podcast, he revealed he spoke to her famous father on Hailie's birthday in December 2022.\n\n\"I saw your dad go downstairs and [thought], 'Alright. I got to do it right now or I'm not doing it today. I'm going to have to schedule some other time,'\" he said after the engagement.\n\n\"So, I just followed him downstairs and thankfully, he was just down there grabbing your cake.\"\n\nHe got down on one knee and gave Hailie an expensive oval-cut diamond on a gold band."
