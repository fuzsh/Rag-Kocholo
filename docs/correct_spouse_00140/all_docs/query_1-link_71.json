        "text": "EMINEM'S ex-wife Kim Mathers looks unrecognizable as she is seen for the first time in five years with a shocking new cropped hairstyle and elaborate tattoos.\n\nThe U.S. Sun has obtained exclusive images of the rapper's former spouse, 48, as she loaded her car up with items this week in Macomb, Michigan.\n\nHailie Jade's mom has shunned Hollywood for many years and prefers to live a reclusive life where she grew up, close to her 27-year-old daughter and ex-husband.\n\nThe U.S. Sun's photographs show Kim looking healthy following her mom's death and her reported suicide attempt last year, with new bleached blonde short locks.\n\nKim had a tumultuous relationship with her childhood sweetheart, real name Marshall Mathers.\n\nThey were married from 1999 to 2001 and then again briefly in 2006.\n\nSources say they are on \"good terms\" these days and support each other as they continue to raise their daughter, who is a social media influencer and hosts her own podcast, Just A Little Shady.\n\nKim showed off her slim petite frame in a revealing halterneck backless light denim jumpsuit as she debuted her rockstar look.\n\nKim, who was also seen wearing a pair of glasses, decided to match her summer outfit with black studded ankle boots with a low heel.\n\nShe has not been photographed since 2018 and has since added dozens of tattoos to her collection, including cover-ups on her tribal designs and a full sleeve down her left arm.\n\nKim also showed off inkings on the side and back of her neck, along with a number of new wrist tattoos.\n\nEminem's ex was left heartbroken last year when she lost her 65-year-old mother, Kathy Sluck, who had been living at her home as her health deteriorated, according to property records.\n\nEmergency services were called to Kim's house in Macomb a day after her mom's funeral on July 30 after one of her panicked daughters called 911 when she tried to take her own life.\n\nBefore her suicide attempt, Kim posted a worrying message to her mom underneath her online obit, writing: \"You're all I had left Momma.\"\n\nShe added: \"I can't imagine this without you! I love you Momma!!! Kiss my dad and sister for me.\"\n\nKim also previously confessed to trying to take her own life when she crashed her car while drunk back in 2015.\n\nDIFFICULT YEAR\n\nShe admitted she was shocked to have survived after she struck a utility pole and her SUV landed upside down in a ditch.\n\nKim has opened up previously about her own addiction struggles and her difficult upbringing before meeting Eminem.\n\nShe and her late sister Dawn - who didn't know their biological dad - both left home at 13, allegedly to escape an alcoholic stepdad.\n\nKim was taken in by Eminem's mum, Debbie Nelson, who claimed in her memoir she wanted to help her after she was sexually abused by her stepdad and ran away.\n\nBut after Eminem dropped out of school to pursue a rap career, she allegedly threw the young lovers out and they struggled to make ends meet as they lived in poverty-stricken areas.\n\nKim was just 21 when she gave birth to Hailie in 1995 and they moved back to the trailer, but Eminem claimed it was impossible to live there because of Debbie's drug habit.\n\nHer relationship with the 50-year-old rapper has had its ups and downs, and she previously sued over the \"intentional infliction of emotional distress\" caused by abusive lyrics about her in his songs.\n\nEM'S SUPPORT\n\nThe pair agreed to settle for an undisclosed sum and have since worked through their issues, according to sources.\n\nKim spoke fondly of the Rap God hitmaker back in 2015 after trying to take her own life.\n\nShe said he had regularly been in touch, explaining: \"He's been real supportive. We're really close.\n\n\"We're just trying to raise our kids together and make it as normal for them as possible.\"\n\nEminem took to the stage in Detroit on Sunday evening, with some family in attendance including daughter Alaine, after the rapper was brought out by 50 Cent as a surprise guest.\n\nDespite her many battles with mental health and addiction, The U.S. Sun's photographs show Kim has managed to turn a corner as she appeared in good spirits.\n\nAlong with Hailie, Kim also has a child Stevie, 21, who identifies as non-binary, and a son, Parker, who is believed to be in his teens, from other relationships.\n\nShe and Eminem also adopted her late sister Dawn Scott's daughter, Aliana, now 30, whose mom died in 2016 from a heroin overdose following years of drug abuse.\n\nShe has celebrated Aliana's marriage in recent months, along with Hailie's engagement to long-term boyfriend, Evan McClintock, who popped the question in February.\n\nThe U.S. Sun can confirm she lives alone with her son Parker just minutes from her other adult children who have all left home."
