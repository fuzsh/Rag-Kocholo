        "text": "The music world is full of (in)famous unions, and one of the most prominent is arguably Marshall Mathers and Kimberly Anne Scott's relationship. Eminem's relationship with fans is great, but he's been open about his messy, complex feelings for the woman he married twice. The Eminem vs. Kim feud is far more complicated than you might realize, though. The two have been in each other's lives for decades, and they share children and history; their journeys, for better or worse, remain inextricably linked.\n\nEminem's deeply troubling childhood and everything since his career took off are in the public eye, but because Kim and Eminem's daughter aren't, we often only hear one side of the story. The truth is that Kim has had her own struggles and triumphs, but due to her ex's stratospheric fame, the facts often get lost in the shuffle.\n\nThis timeline documents the drama surrounding Eminem and Kim, from their first marriage and divorce, to their second marriage and divorce, their daughter, and what Kim and Eminem have to say about it all."
