        "text": "Kim is a song by American rapper Eminem. It appears on his third studio album, The Marshall Mathers LP.\n\nReleased February 8, 2000 Recorded February 3, 1998 Label Shady Records Writer Marshal Mathers Producer Marshal Mathers\n\nBrief Overview []\n\nIn this song, Eminem fantasized over seeking revenge on his then-wife, Kimberly Anne Scott, for frustrating and cheating on him by murdering her and then dumping her body in the back of the trunk if he could get away with it. This song serves as a prequel to \"97 Bonnie & Clyde\".\n\nAt the beginning of the song, he speaks softly to his daughter Hailie, but as soon as Kim enters the room, he promptly starts angrily shouting at his wife and then drags her into the car and starts driving. After telling her she will be in the trunk, he stops at a calm place in the woods. Kim tries to escape but fails and then Eminem slits her throat, causing her to choke and bleed to death. He then (presumably) ties her up with a sticky tape, opening the trunk with a key and puts her inside. Finally, he closes the trunk, drives back home, and gets Hailie to help him dispose of her body in \"97 Bonnie & Clyde\".\n\nLyrics[]\n\nINTRO & FIRST VERSE:\n\nEminem:\n\nAww look at Daddy's baby girl\n\nThat's daddy's baby,\n\nLittle sleepy head...\n\nYesterday I changed your diaper, wiped you and powdered you\n\nHow did you get so big?
