        "text": "Eminem wasn’t just in the headlines for his rap songs. But, also for his volatile relationship with Kimberly Anne Scott also known by many as Kim Mathers. Kim is the former wife of Eminem and mother of four; Hailie, Alaina, Whitney, and Parker. Their lover story is no different to a roller coster of a movie where they got married twice and even got divorced twice. The school sweethearts perhaps didn’t enjoy their love life too long.\n\nKimberly Anne Scott is an author and American mercenary illustrator. She has written over dozens of children’s books. She isn’t famous for her writing but indeed came in headlines for her turbulent relationship with the controversial rapper- Marshall Bruce Mathers III AKA Eminem.\n\nFAQ about Kimberly Anne Scott\n\nWho is Kimberly Anne Scott?\n\nKimberly Anne Scott was born on January 9, 1975, in Warren Michigan, the USA to mother Kathleen Sluck and father Casimir. Kim is of white ethnicity and holds an American nationality. She has also got a twin sister named Dawn Scott who demised due to heroin overdose in early 2016. The twin sisters were raised by her mother and step-father.\n\nGrowing up, Kim and her twin sister had a disturbing childhood. They had to deal with their alcoholic step-father who even used to assault Kim sexually. As a consequence, she and her sister ran away from the house and started living at Youth home in 1998. But later on, after meeting with Eminem, they moved to his house.\n\nHow did Kimberly and Eminem Meet?\n\nKimberly Anne Scott and Marshall Bruce Mathers III, known by stage name as Eminem met each other by utter fate.\n\nIn an interview, Debbie, mother of Em recalls Marshall bringing a tall, sulky blonde call to home.\n\nHe introduced her as Kim Scott. She said she was fifteen and there was no reason to doubt it. In truth she was so cute and busty, she could have easily passed for seventeen, said Debbie.\n\nHowever, Kimberly was 13, and Eminem was just 15 years of age at the time of the meeting. The duo came into each other path when Eminem was singing his favorite song “I am Bad” standing half-naked on the table. His swag was able to make an impression on Kimberley who instantly fell in love with him.\n\nTheir friendship blossomed at the party and it didn’t take long before Eminem let Kim and her sister stay at his mother’s house. However, they were constantly chased away by Debbie’s boyfriend’s claims Debbie.\n\nEminem and Kimberly Anne Scott’s On and Off Relationship\n\nThe duo started dating in the year 1989 and throughout the 90s. Things were already getting sour between the couple when Kimberly got pregnant when she was living at Eminem’s mother. Despite the on-and-off relationship, they gave birth to their daughter on Christmas 1995. The Christmas baby was named Hailie Jade Mathers.\n\nThe following year, the couple parted their ways, and Kimberly with her daughter shifted to a one-bedroom apartment. Whereas, Eminem went back to stay with his mother. Despite staying away for more than two years, the duo revived their romance and later got back together in 1999. They also exchanged vows at St.Joseph Mo the same year they got together.\n\nUnfortunately, the marriage didn’t last long and they parted their ways legally in 2001. It’s assumed that the reason behind their separation is the song ‘Kim’ where he mentions killing his wife. Further, he played the song in his ‘Up in Smoke Tour’ where Kim was one of the audience. This incident created more tension between the couple whose output was the divorce.\n\nHowever, after five years of their separation, again the two decided to give second chance to their relationship for the welfare of their daughter and re-married in January 2006. To everyone’s surprise, the marriage only lasted for one month. Scott and Eminem shared the joint custody of their daughter Hailey Jade.\n\nPrior to a second marriage, Kimberly was in a relationship with a man called Eric Hartter. She also gave birth to a daughter named Whitney Scott from that relationship.\n\nKim Mathers’ Children: The Glue That Kept Them Together\n\nDespite having many differences, Kim and Eminem came together from time to time for their daughter Hailie. Both parents loved Hailie immensely and she was the glue that kept them together for much longer than they should have been. They gave many chances to their relationship for their Christmas-born baby. However, in the end, they ended their up-and-down relationship.\n\nhttps://ift.tt/2nLScIl\n\nBesides Hailey, Kim also has another daughter Whitney Scott from her relationship with Eric Harter. She and Eminem also took custody of Aliana Marie Mathers, the daughter of Dawn Scott because of her drug issues. They formally adopted Aliana in 2002.\n\nAccording to few sources, it’s said that Mathers also has a son named Patrick Scott. No further details about him are known other than his name. Eminem and Kim together share the custody of their biological and adopted children. They are on good terms for the sake of their children. Nobody can deny the fact that though being bad partners for each other, they have proved themselves as good parents.\n\nControversies and Troubles with the Law\n\nIn June 2000, Eminem saw his wife kissing a friend John Guerra on his cheek in the parking lot of a Warren, Mich. Nightclub. Eventually, he assaulted the man and was also arrested for the incident.\n\nHe was pled guilty and was charged with a sentence of two years. Likewise, in 2000, Eminem played the song ‘Kim’ and assaulted a blow-up doll stand-in for Kim at one of his concerts in Detroit. She wasn’t able to handle this humiliation because of which she tried to kill herself by slashing her wrist.\n\nIn 2001, Eminem’s wife was arrested and charged with drug possession but wasn’t declared guilty. Again in 2003, she was arrested for unsafe driving with two bags of cocaine. She was fined and was kept on probation. Later when she violated her probation, she was sentenced to one month in jail.\n\nSimilarly, in October of 2015, Kim was found under heavy influence when she crashed her SUV into a ditch and utility pole.\n\nLater at Shelby TWP Court, she admitted to her drunk driving case and attempted suicide. After a year-long trial, she was fined $900 dollars and sentenced to one year of probation. Talking about her mental state, she mentioned she has been doing fine with her therapy sessions.\n\nEminem’s Apology to Kim\n\nEminem’s stormy relationship with his ex-wife has been a major source of inspiration throughout his musical career. He has humiliated his ex-wife through his musical albums in the past. However, on his new album ‘Revival’ with ‘Bad Husband’, he has finally apologized to Kim for the pain he has caused.\n\nEminem opens up “Bad Husband” by elaborating on the height of their chaotic public relationship from 1998 through 2001. That is from the time they got married and when they got divorced while his career was on the path to success.\n\nKimberly Talks About Eminem\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Kim talks about Eminem and how he is the best possible father for their kids. She goes on talking about the problems of having fame, infidelity, and how her relationship went down the hill from there. Kim also talks about how Em’s performance on Kim and her attempted suicide!\n\nKimberly Anne Scott’s Net worth\n\nBeing the ex-wife of a famous rapper, her net worth is estimated to be around $2 million. However, her former husband, Eminem has a whooping sum of amount $220 million as net worth according to Celebrity net worth in 2019. The rapper comes under the 6th position among the richest rappers in the world. In 2001, for the divorce settlement, the court ordered Eminem to pay $52000 per annum to Kim for spousal support and child custody.\n\nThe ex-couple still see each other, but Kim has managed to clean up her life, despite the bad influence Eminem seems to have on her. Their daughter Hailie had a normal upbringing and wasn’t affected by the stormy relationship of her parents.\n\nWill Kimberly and Em ever get back together?\n\nWell, there is a saying you can never say never. When there is so much history between two people, you can never tell what can befall. They have shared their teens together, loved, married, divorced, married, and again divorced. Both of them are still single. So, who knows what can ignite this fiery relationship again.\n\nIn November 2013, a news surfaced that Eminem might just re-kindle his relationship with his ex-wife when his ex-mother in the law revealed that he was building a house for Kim. She told how Em and Kim see each other often and think they have a good chance of getting back together.\n\nBut it’s been almost 7 years after the story was revealed and the ex-lovers seem to be living peacefully in their own lives.\n\nWhere is Kimberly Ann Scott Now?\n\nApart from coming into the highlights with her toxic relationship with Eminem, Kim rarely makes any public appearances. Therefore, we can only guess she is living a peaceful life away from the limelight and is making ways to make her life better."
