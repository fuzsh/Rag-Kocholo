        "text": "One of the main topics Eminem raps about in his songs is his family, whom he has tried to keep out of the limelight throughout his career.\n\nDespite a tumultuous childhood, the rapper has tried his best to make sure his family is always well taken care of.\n\nThe “Real Slim Shady” chart-topper shares three children — Hailie Jade Mathers, Alaina Marie Scott and Stevie Laine Mathers — with his ex-wife, Kim Scott, with whom he has had a decades-long relationship.\n\nThrough the years, the Oscar winner has given fans a glimpse inside his home life.\n\n“Bein’ a dad is definitely living a double life,” Eminem, born Marshall Mathers, told Rolling Stone in 2004.\n\n“Even before Hailie was born, I was a firm believer in freedom of speech … But once I hit them gates where I live, that’s when I’m Dad. Takin’ the kids to school, pickin’ ’em up, teachin’ ’em rules. I’m not sayin’ I’m the perfect father, but the most important thing is to be there for my kids and raise them the right way,” he said at the time.\n\nHe even credited his children with helping him get sober, telling New York Times Magazine in 2010, “I love them so much and they’ve helped me through so many things.”\n\nRead on to learn more about Eminem’s family.\n\nEminem’s relationship with Kim Scott\n\nEminem met Kim at a house party in 1988 when he was 15 and she was 13.\n\nKim and her twin sister, Dawn, had recently run away from home, reportedly to escape their alcoholic stepfather, and settled at a youth shelter outside of Detroit.\n\n“I met her the day she got out of the youth home,” the rapper recalled in his 2004 interview with Rolling Stone.\n\n“I was at a friend’s house, and his sister was friends with her, but she hadn’t seen Kim in a while ’cause she was in the youth home. And I’m standing on the table with my shirt off, on top of their coffee table with a Kangol on, mocking the words to LL Cool J’s ‘I’m Bad.’ And I turn around and she’s at the door. Her friend hands her a cigarette.”\n\nHe went on, “I said to my friend’s sister, ‘Yo, who was that? She’s kinda hot.’ And the saga began. Now there’s the constant struggle of ‘will I ever meet somebody else that’s gonna be real with me, as real as I can say she’s been with me?’”\n\nNot long after, Eminem and his future wife were living with his mother, Debbie Nelson.\n\n“Marshall arrived home from school with a tall, sulky blonde girl,” Nelson recalled in her 2008 memoir, “My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem.” “He introduced her as Kim Scott and said she needed a place to stay. I was happy to help out.”\n\nHowever, shortly after their romance started, Nelson kicked them out and they were forced to live in a neighborhood riddled with drugs and crime.\n\nBy 1995, Kim unexpectedly got pregnant and the couple welcomed their first daughter, Hailie, on Christmas Day.\n\nThe pressure of raising a child, along with Eminem’s unfulfilled musical ambitions seemingly put a strain on the relationship which led to a constant cycle of breakups and reconciliations.\n\nIn 1999, he dropped “The Slim Shady LP” which featured a track about murdering Kim and disposing of her body with the help of their daughter.\n\n“I played her the song, and she bugged the f— out,” Eminem said in his 2004 interview with Rolling Stone.\n\nAlthough it didn’t help his relationship, the album did propel the rapper to international stardom. He and Kim tied the knot in 1999 but called it quits two years later.\n\nThey briefly reconciled in 2006, but divorced for the second time a few months later.\n\nKim spoke out about the rollercoaster relationship in a 2007 interview with 20/20.\n\n“Money is great, but it doesn’t make your husband stay at home with you,” she said. “Or sleep in the same bed with you … Him being on the road and on tour … that was like the big one. I mean … constant infidelities, all the time.”\n\nShe also admitted their second marriage wasn’t a good idea.\n\n“In our relationship, there’s a pattern. Like, we’ll have two good years and then it will go bad for some reason. It’s like a two-year max with us and we hadn’t reached the two years yet. I just didn’t want to rush into anything before the two years,” she explained.\n\nA decade after their split, Eminem apologized to his ex-wife on the track, “Bad Husband.”\n\n“I loved you, but I hated that me. And I don’t wanna see that side again. But I’m sorry, Kim. More than you could ever comprehend,” he crooned in 2017.\n\nEminem’s first daughter, Hailie Jade\n\nBorn on Dec. 25, 1995, in Detroit, Hailie is Eminem and Kim’s only biological child.\n\nDespite the pair splitting for good in 2006, they successfully managed to co-parent Hailie.\n\n“She made me get my ass in gear — to make something of my life and try 10 quadrillion times harder than I had before,” Eminem told British outlet “Q” in 2001. “Everything that I am doing right now is for Hailie … the money — it’s for her college.”\n\nBack in 2002, he got candid about the impact his little girl had on his life in “Hailie’s Song.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“My insecurities could eat me alive, but then I see my baby / Suddenly I’m not crazy, it all makes sense when I look into her eyes,” he crooned.\n\nNow, Hailie is a social media influencer who has amassed millions of followers across Instagram and TikTok. She graduated from Michigan State University in 2018 with a degree in psychology and a 3.9 GPA.\n\n“She’s made me proud for sure,” Eminem said on “Hotboxin’ with Mike Tyson” in 2020.\n\nThe social media star has gushed on multiple occasions about growing up with her A-list dad, calling her upbringing “surreal.”\n\n“It’s so fun to look back [at my life] … thinking back as an adult, I’m like, ‘Wow, that’s so, so surreal,’” she said on a 2022 episode of her Just A Little Shady podcast.\n\nHailie noted that she’s also “very close” with her father and recalled one specific memory.\n\n“I always think about that time we went to Florida, my dad was working on something, and he set up for us to do, like, the limo and take it to Disney and we did the princess tea party, and he had the dresses waiting for us,” she shared.\n\n“At the time, we were so happy and so excited, but we didn’t get to appreciate that moment as much as now when we talk about it and think back on it.”\n\nNevertheless, she revealed in a later podcast episode that she sometimes gets frustrated by the constant questions about the “Lose Yourself” chart-topper.\n\n“I feel like growing up, when it would happen, I would get more bothered by it because I was like, ‘Why do people care?'” she said. “I was young and I didn’t totally understand the situation, so I was like, that’s my dad. I don’t ask you about your dad.”\n\nHailie is currently engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Evan McClintock, after he got down on one knee.\n\n“casual weekend recap… 2.4.23 ,” the bride-to-be captioned Instagram photos showing the couple popping champagne in February 2023.\n\n“i love you @evanmcclintock11,” she added.\n\nThe pair met in college and dated for six years before he popped the question.\n\nEminem’s adopted daughter, Alaina Marie\n\nAlaina was actually born to Kim’s twin sister, Dawn, on Feb. 22, 1993. However, the identity of her biological father is unknown.\n\nFollowing Dawn’s struggles with substance abuse, Eminem and Kim adopted Alaina after she had lived with them for the majority of her life. By 2016, Dawn had suffered a fatal overdose.\n\n“My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born,” Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2004. “Me and Kim pretty much had her, she’d live with us wherever we was at.”\n\nDuring his 2020 interview on the “Hotboxin’ with Mike Tyson” podcast, he said Alaina — whom he often refers to by her nickname Lainey in the lyrics of his songs — was “like a daughter” to him.\n\nMost famously, he name-dropped Alaina in his 2004 song “Mockingbird,” rapping, “Lainey, uncle’s crazy ain’t he? / Yeah, but he loves you, girl and you better know it / We’re all we got in this world.”\n\nShe attended Oakland University, where she received a bachelor of arts in communication with a double minor in public relations and advertising.\n\nShe now boasts more than 80,000 Instagram followers and frequently shares travel-related content with her husband, Matt Moeller.\n\nThe pair said “I do” in June 2023, after getting engaged in December 2021.\n\n“June 9, 2023 simply one of the best days of my life,” the bride captioned an Instagram carousel of pictures from the big day.\n\n“In this lifetime and in the next, my soul will always find yours.”\n\nEminem’s adopted younger child, Stevie Laine\n\nStevie Laine was born on April 16, 2002, to Kim and her then-boyfriend, Eric Hartter, whom she dated between her two marriages with Eminem. Hartter reportedly battled drug addiction and died in 2020 at the age of 40.\n\nWhen the on-again, off-again couple said “I do” for the second time in 2005, the “8 Mile” actor legally adopted Stevie, who uses all of the pronouns.\n\nIn 2021, Stevie came out as nonbinary, sharing a sweet video documenting their journey to becoming “more comfortable” with themselves.\n\nThey added the hashtags “#genderfluid” and “#bi.” Stevie — who was born Whitney Mathers — had previously come out as bisexual in 2017.\n\nAlthough they have stayed away from the spotlight, Eminem has mentioned them in his songs.\n\nOn his 2010 track “Going Through Changes,” the Grammy winner rapped, “Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina, too, I still love your mother, that’ll never change, think about her every day, we could never get it together, hey.”"
