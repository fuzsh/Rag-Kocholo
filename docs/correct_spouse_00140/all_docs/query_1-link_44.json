        "text": "Eminem warmed hearts across the world this week when he admitted his proudest achievement is ‘being a father.’\n\nWhich is a no feat, considering the rapper is one of the best-selling rappers of the 2000s and is the best-selling hip hop artist of all time.\n\nDuring an appearance on Mike Tyson’s Hot Boxin’ podcast, Eminem gushed over how proud he is of his daughter.\n\n‘Hailie is 23, no babies, she has a boyfriend, but she’s doing good, she’s made me proud for sure, she’s graduated from college,’ Em told the retired boxer.\n\nHe later concluded: ‘So when I think about my accomplishments that’s probably the thing I’m the most proud of is that – is being able to raise kids.’\n\nEminem shares daughter Hailie Mathers with his ex-wife Kimberly Scott, who is probably best known for featuring regularly in the lyrics of the rapper’s early hits.\n\nSo, who is Kim Scott and what is she doing now?\n\nKim Scott, formerly Kim Mathers, was born in 1975 in Warren, Michigan, and first met Eminem in 1987 when they were both teenagers.\n\nThey embarked on a rocky relationship which saw them marry and divorce twice before finally parting ways in 2006.\n\nThey married from 1999 to 2001, before divorcing and remarrying in 2016, with their second marriage only lasting a few months.\n\nIn 2000, Eminem released Kim, where he spat some pretty slamming lyrics about his wife at the time, claiming she had cheated on him.\n\nThe track also alluded to domestic violence, with the lyrics portraying Eminem as beating up his unfaithful wife, even killing her.\n\nShe later filed a suit against the star for $10 million in compensation for ‘the intentional infliction of emotional distress.’\n\nThey co-parent daughter Hailie, who was born on 25 December 1995.\n\nWhat is Kim Scott doing now?\n\nSince their second divorce, Kim, 45,has laid relatively low, last speaking publicly in 2015.\n\nIn 2015 she was involved in a car accident in Shelby Township Michigan, which she later revealed was a suicide attempt.\n\nShe told Detroit-based radio show Mojo in the Morning about the accident, where she revealed: ‘I sat at the end of a road where I knew that no one else but myself would get hurt. Yes, I drank, I took pills, I hit the gas and aimed for a pole.’\n\nShe went on to say she was getting help and that she had been sober for ten years, adding that she was raising her kids, including her son with autism.\n\nShe praised Eminem, confirming there is no longer beef between the pair.\n\n‘He has been real supportive. We are really close friends. We are just trying to raise our kids together and make it as normal for them as possible,’ she said.\n\nThe pair have three children together in total, Hailie their biological child, as well as Whitney, Kim’s daughter whom Eminem adopted, and Alaina, the daughter of Kim’s late twin sister, whom they also adopted.\n\nWhitney, 17,is Kim’s daughter from a previous relationship whereas Alaina, 26, is Kim’s sister Dawn’s daughter.Dawn passed away in 2016.\n\nWhile the girls are active on social media, they have refrained from posting images of their mother.\n\nKim also has a son called Parker but it’s understood Eminem is not his legal guardian.\n\nMORE : Eminem ‘proud’ of daughter Hailie as she builds life with boyfriend after graduating\n\nMORE : Eminem debuts Godzilla music video with Mike Tyson cameo and Juice Wrld tribute\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."
