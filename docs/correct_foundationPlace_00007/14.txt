A wine list from Flask published in the early 1970s

Driving down Ventura Blvd in Studio City in the 1960â€™s has something in common with today, Flask Fine Wine & Whisky- Flask first opened its doors to the public in 1962. Decades later and it still remains a respected fixture in the Los Angeles community.

We work directly with the wineries, distilleries and breweries to maintain a personal relationship with the creators of some of our favorite products.

We want to know their stories and how they produce bottles that fit into our unique collection. We make a point to keep our selection stocked with a wide variety, offering your classic Napa icons to your natural & organic wines.

We like to think of our whiskey and spirit section as more of a library where the rarest of bottles can be found.

We look forward to helping you find your next favorite bottle!
