IPIBSBV^iOSo >4|||H The foUowiDg Lectures were read in the universitjr of Edinburgh, for twentj-four years. The publication of them, at present, was not altogether a matter of choice. Imperfect copies of them, in manuscript, from notes, taken by students who heard them read, were first pri- vately handed about ; and afterwards frequently exposed to public sale. When the author saw them circulate so currently, as eyen to be quoted in print,* and found him- self often threatened with surreptitious publications of them, he judged it to be high time that they should pro- ceed from his own hand, rather than eome into public view under some very defective and erroneous form. They were originally designed for the initiation of youth into the study of belles lettres, and of composition. .With the same intention they are now published ; and BiograpbiaBritaDnlra. Articl«» Addisov. 4 V nsFAes. therefore, the form of Lectures^ in which they were n\\ first composed, is still retained. The author gives then to the world, neither as a work wholly original, nor as a compilation from the writings of others. On erery subject contained in them, he has thought for himself He consulted his own ideas and reflections : and a great part of what will be found in these lectures is entirely his own. At the same time, he availed himself of the ideas and reflections of others, as far as he thought them proper to be adopted. To proceed in this maimer, was his duty as a public professor. It was incumbent on him, to convey to his pupils all the knowledge that could im- prove them ; to deliver not merely what was new, but ivhat might be useful, from whatever quarter it came* He hopes, that to such as are studying to cultivate their taste, to form their style, or to prepare themselves for public speaking or composition, his lectures will afford a more comprehensive view of what relates to these subjects, than, as &r as he knows, is to be received from any one book in our language. 9 In order to render his work of greater service, he has generally referred to the books which he consulted, as far as he remembers them ; that the readers might be di- rected to any farther illustration which they afford. But as such a length of time has elapsed since the first com-* pontion dTtfaeae lectoreB, he may, perhapcs hsire adopted tfaeaentimenteaf some author into whose writiogs he had tfaea looked, without now remembering whence he den- Teddiem. In the opinions which he has delivered coiioeniing such a variety of authors, and of literary nmtters, as come un- der his consideratioB, he cannot expeet that all his read- ers win concur with him. The .subjects are of such a nature, as allow room for much diversity of taste and senfknent : and the author will respectfully submit to the judg^nentof the public Retaming the simplicity of the lecturing style, as best fitted lor conveying instruction, be has aimed, in hb lan- guage, at no more than perspicuity. If, after the liber- ties whidh it was necessary for him to take, in criticbing the style of the most eminent writers in our language, hb own style shall be thought open to reprehension, all that he can say, is, that his book will add one to the many proofs already afforded to the world, of its bebg miich easier to give bstruction, than to set example. 1 r CONTENTS. h INTRODUCTION 5 IL Taste .-•-.-. .^15 III.

O 'Me of the most distinguished privileges which Providence has conferred upon mankind, is the power of communicating their thoughts lo one another. Destitute of this power, reason would be a solitarji and, in some measure, an unavailing prinfjple. Speech is the great in- strument by which man becomes beneficial to man : and it is to the in- tercourse and transmission of thought, by means of speech, that we are xhieflj indebted for the improvement of thought itself. Small are the • .advances which a single unassisted individual can make towards perfect- ingany of his powers. What we call human reason, is not the effort o^ lability of one, so much as it is the result of the reason of many, arising from lights mutually communicated, in consequence of discourse and writing. it is obvi#as, then, that writing and discourse are abjects entitled to the highest attention. Whether the influence of the speaker, or the en- tertainment of the hearer, be consulted ; whether utility or pleasure be the principal aim in view, we are prompted, by the strongest motives^ to study how we may communi(;jite our thoughts to one another with most advantage. Accordingly we find, that in almost every nation, as soon as language had extended itself beyond that scanty communication which was requisite for the supply of men's necessities, the improvement of discourse began to attract regard. In the language even of rude un- cultivated tribes, we can trace some attention to the grace and force o^ those expressions which the^ used, when they sought to persuade or to a&ct. They were early sensible of a beauty in discourse, and endeav- .oured to give it certain decorations, which experience had taught them it was capable of receiving, long before the study of those decorations was formed into a regular art. But, among nations in a civilised state, no art has been cultivated with Biore care, than that of language, style, and composition* The attention paid to it, may, indeed, be assumed as one mark of the progress of soci- ety towards its most improved period. For, according -as society im- proves and flourishes, men acquire more influence over one another by means of reasoning and discourse ; and in proportion as that influence is felt to enlarge, it must follow, as a natural consequence, that they will be- stow more care upon the methods of expressing their conceptions with propriety and eloquence.*;. Hence we find, that in all the polished nations of Europe, this study has. been treated as highly important, and has possessed acckisiderable place in every plan of liberal education. B 10 mXRODUCnON. iUCT. t. Indeed, wheo the arts of speech and writing are mentioned^ I mo slble that prejudices against them are apt to rise in the minds of many. A sort of art is immediately thought of, that is ostentatious and deceitful; tlie fniuute and trifling study of words alone ; the pomp of expression ; the studied fallacies oC rhetoric ; ornament substituted in tbejroom of use* We need not wonder, that, under such imputations, all study of discourse as an art, should have suffered in the opinion of m^ of understanding f and i am far from denying, that rhetoric and criticism have sometimes been so managed as to tend to The corruption^ rather than to the improve- nent of good tase and true eloquence. But sure it is equally possible to apply th«' principles of reason and good sense to this art, as to any other that is cultivated among mea. If the following Lectures have any merits it will consist io an endeavour to substitute the application of these prin- ciples in the place of artificial and scholastic rhetoric ; in an endeavour to explode fake ornament, to direct attention more towards substance than show, to recommend good sense as the foundation of all good com- position, and simplicity as essential to all true ornament. When entering on tliis subject, I may be allowed, on this occasion, to suggest a few thoughts conceBning the importance and advantages of such studies, and the rank they are entitled to possess in academical edu- cation.* 1 'am under no temptation, far this purpose, of extolling their importance at the expense of any other department of science. On the contrary, the study of Rhetoric auid Belles Lettres supposes and requires a proper acquaintance with the r^st of the liberal arts. It embraces them ail within its circle, and recommends them to the highest regards The first care of all such as wish either to write with reputation, or to speak in public so as to command attention, must be, to extend their knowledge ; to lay ia a rich store of ideas^relating to those subjects of which the occasions of life may call them to discourse or to write. Henee^ among the ancients, it was a fundamental principle, and freqoisntly incuU cated, '< Quod omnibus disciplinis et artibus debet esse instructus orator ;*' that the orator ought to be an accompfished scholar, and conversant in every part of learning. It is indeed hnpossible to contrive an art, ahd very pernicious it were if it could be contrived, which shouM give the stamp of merit to any composition rich or splendid in expression, buL barren or erroneous in thought. They are the wretched attempts to^* wards an art of tliis kind, which have so often disgraced oratory, and de* based it below its true standard*. The graces of composition have been employed to disguise or to supply the want of matter ; and the temporary applause of the ignorant has been conrted^ instead of the lasting appro- bation of the discernrag. But such imposture can never maintain- its ground long. Knowledge and science must furnish the materials that form the body and substance of any valuable composition. Rhetoric serves to add the polish ; and we know that none but firm and solid bo- dies can be polished welt.. Of those wlio peruse the foDowing* Lectures, some By the profession * to which they addict themselves, or in consequence of their prevailing * The anthor was the fi^t who read lectures on this subject ia the uoiversity of Edin- burgh, lie began with reading them io a private character in the year 1759. In the following year he was chosen Professor of Rhetoric by the magistrates and town-coan- eil of Eain))urgh ; and, in 1762, his majesty was pleased to erect and endow a Fra- fcvjsion of Rhetoric and Belles lettrai in tfalk uaivarsity ;. ud the author was ax»poiat- ed the first Regius Pjotfessor* I£CT.4.1 INTfiOBOCTION. 1| ineluMitioa may have the view of beteg opployed in eomposition^ or ia publtc speaking. Others^ without any prospect of this kind, may wish •ely to Improve their taste with respect to writing and discourse, and to acquire principles which will enable them to judge for themselves io that part of literature called the Belles Lettres* With respect to the former, such as may have occasion to communicate their semtiiiieDts to the public, it is abundantly tiear that some prepara- tion of study is requisite for the end which they have in view. To ipeak or to write perspicuously and agreeably, with purity, with grace and strength, are attainments of the utmost consequence to all who pur- pose, either by speech or writing, to address the public. For without being masterof those attainments, no man can do justice to bis own con- ceptions) but bow rich soever he may be in knowledge and good sense, will be aMe to avail himself less of those treasures, than such as possess not half his stora, but who can display what they possess with more pro- priety Neither are these attainments of that kind for which we are in- . debted to nature merely. Nature has, indeed, conferred upon some a very favourable dbtinction in this respect beyond others. But in these, as in most other talents she bestows, she has leA much to be wrought out by every man's own industry. So conspicuous have been the effects of study and improvement in every part of eloquence ; such remarkable examples have appeared of persons surmounting by their diligence, the disadvantages of the most untoward nature, that among the learned it has long been a contested, and remains still an undecided point, whether nature or art confer ^ost towards excelling in writing or discourse. With respect to the manner in which art can most effectually furnish assistance for such a purpose, there may be diversity of opinions. I by no means pretend to say that mere rhetorical rules, how just soever, are sofiicient to form an orator. Supposing natural genius to be favourable, more by a great deal will depend upon private application and study, than upon any system of instruction that is capable of being publicly commu- nicated. But at the same time, though rules and instructions cannot do all that it requisite, they may, however, do much that is' of real use. They cannot, it is true, inspire genius ; but they can direct and assist it They cannot remedy barrenness; but they may correct redundancy. They point out proper models for imitation. They bring into view tb6 chief beauties that ought to be studied, and the principal thoughts that oaght to be avoided ; and thereby tend to enlighten taste, and to lead ^^ius from unnatural deviations, into its proper channel. What would not avail for the production of great excellencies^ may at least serve to prevent the commission of considerable errors. All that regards the study of -eloquence and composition, merits the higher attention «pon this account, that it is intimately connected with the improvement of our intellectual powers. For I must be allowed to say, that when we are employed, after a proper manner, in the study of ^oipposition, we are cultivating reason itself. True rhetoric and sound logic are very nearly allied. The study of arranging and expressing. our thoughts with propriety, teaches to think, as well as to speak accu- rately. By putting our sentiments into words, we always conceive 4hem more distinctly. Every one who has the slightest acquaintance with composition knows, that when he e5t>resses hiiffself ill on any subject, when his arrangement is loose, and his sentences become fee- ble, the def^ts of his style can almost on every occasion^ be traced la wm&oacnoK. elect, i. back to his indistinct conception of the subject : fto close is the oomwiiM between thoaghts and the words in which they are clothed. The study of composition^ important in itself at all times, has aojaired iulditional importance from the taste and manners of the present age. It is an age wherein improveinents, in every part of science have b^Q prosecut^ with ardour. To all the liberal arts much attention has been paid : and to none more than to the beaoty of language, and the grace and elegance of every kind of writing. The public ear b become re- fined. It will not easily bear what is slovenly and incorrect* Every author must aspire to some merit in expression, as well as in sentiment, if he would not incur the danger of being neglected and despised. I will not deny that the love of minute elegance, and attention to iafe* rior Ornaments of composition, may at present have engrossed too great m degree of the public regard. It is indeed my opinioQ, that we lean to this extreme; often more careful of polishing style, than of storing H with thought Yet hence arises a new reason for the study of just and proper composition. If it be requisite not to be deficient in elegance or ^ ornament in times when they are in such high estimation, it is still more requisite to attain the power of distinguishing Ailse ornament from' true, In order to prevent our being carried away by that torrent of false and . frivolous taste, which never fails, when* it is prevalent, to sweep along wit^ it the raw and the igpiorant. They who have never stndi^ elo** quence in its principles, nor have been trained to attend to die genuine and manly beauties of good writing, are always ready to be caught by the mere glare of language ; and when they come to speak in public, or tci compose, have no other standard on which to form themselves, except what chances to be fashionable and popular, how corrupted soever, or et^ roneous, that may be. But as there are many who have no such objects as either composition or public speaking in view, let us next consider what advantages may be derived by them, from such studies as form the subject of these Lectures* To them rhetoric is not so much a practical art as a speculative science; and the same instructions which assist others in composing, will assist them in judging of, and relishing, the beauties of composition. Whatever enables genius to execifte well, will enable taste to criticise justly. When we name criticising, prejudices may perhaps arise, of the same kind with those which I mentioned before with respect to rhetoric. As rhetoric has been sometimes thought to signify nothing more than the scholastic study of words, and phrases, and tropes, so criticism has been considered as merely the art of finding faults ;' as the frigid application of certain technical terms, by means of which persons are taught to cavil and censure in a learned manner. But this is the criticism of pedants only. True criticism is a liberal and humane art. It is the offspring of good sense and refined taste. It aims at acquiring a just discernment of the real merit of authors. It promotes a Uvely relish of their beauties, while it preserves us from that blind and implicit veneration whioh would confound their beauties and faults in our esteem. It teaches us, in a word, to admire and to blame with judgment, and not to foDow the crowd blindly. In an age vAen works of genius and literature are so firequently tbe subjects of discourse, when every one erects himself into a judge, ami vhcQ we ^an hardly mingle in polite society without (rearing; some share UECT.L] INTBODUCTION. |3 io aach difeiMBioiif; studies of this kisd, it is ftot to be doubted, wiU 9;^ Car to derive part of their importani:e from the use to which they mi^ applied in fumisbiog materials for those fashionable topics of discourse^ ' Md thereby enahUog us to support a proper rank in social life. But 1 should be sorry if we could not rest the merit of such studies on somewhat of solid and iotrinsical use, independent of appearance and show. The exercise of taste and of sound criticism is, in truth, one of the most improviag employments of the understanding. To apply the principles, of good sense to composition and discourse ; to examine what is beauti- fid and why it is so ; to employ ourselves in distinguishing accurately between the specious and the solid, between affi^ted and natural oma* ment, must certainly improve us not a little in the most valuable part of aU philosophy, the philosophy of human nature. For such disquisitions lure very intimately connect^ with the knowledge of ourfelves. They iseoessarily kad us to r^ert on the operations of the imagination, and the movements of the heart ; and increase our acquaintance with some of the most refined feeUngs which belong to our frame. Logical and ethical disquisitions move in a higher sphere ; and are con- ¥affs«nt with objects of a more severe kind ; the progress of the under* stancfittgin its search after knowledge, and the direction of the will in the proper porsait of good* In these they point out to man the improvement of his nature as aa intelligent being ) and his duties as the subject of mo- ral obligation. Belles Lettres and criticism chiefly consider him as a beiDg endowed with those powers of taste and imagination, which were intended to embellish his mind, and to supply him with rational and use- liil entertainment. They open a field of investigs^tien peculiar to them- selves. AU that relates to beauty, harmony, grandeur, and elegance | all t^at can soothe the mind, gratify the fancy, or move the affections, be- longs to their province. They present human nature under a different SMpect^rom that which it assumes to the view of other sciences. They bring to Ught various springs of action, which without their aid, might have passed unobserved ; and which, though of a delicate nature, fre- quentty exert a powerful influence on several departments of human life. Sacfa studies have also this peculiar advantage, that they exercise our reason without iatiguiog it. They lead to inquiries acute, but not pain* lui ; profound, but not dry nor abstruse. They strew flowers in the path of science ; tLud while they keep the miod bent, in some degree and active, they relieve it at the same time from that more , toilsome labour to which it must submit in the acquisition of necessary erudition, or the investigation of abstract truth. The cultivation of taste is farther recommended by the happy effects which it naturally tends to produce on human life. The most busy man^ in the most active sphere, cannot be always occupied by business. Men of serious professions cannot always be on the stretch of serious thought* Neither can the most gay and flourishing ntuations of fortune afford any man the power of filling all his hours with pleasure. Life must always , languish in the hands of the idle. It will frequently languish even in the hands of the busy, if they have not some employments subsidiary to that which forms their main pursuit. How then shall these vacant spaces, those unemployed intervals, which, more or less, occur in the life of every one, be filled up ? How can we contrive to dispose of them in any jFay that shall be more agreeable in itself^ or more consonant to the dig-* 14 ' INTRODUCTION. JVtCt. U tdty of the liuman mind, limn in the entertainments of taste, and the study of polite literature ? He who is so happy as to have acquired a relish lor these, has always at hand an innocent and irreproachable amusement for his leisure hours, to save him from the danger of many a pernicious passion. He is not in hazard of being a burden to himself. He is not obliged to fly to low company, or to court the riot of loose pleasures, is order £>€ure the tediousness of existence. Providence seems plainly to have pointed out this useful purpose to which the pleasures of taste may be applied, by interposing them in a middle station between the pleasures of sense, and those of pure intel* lect. We were not designed to grovel always among objects so low as the former; nor are we capable of dwelling constantly In so high a re- gion as the latter. The pleasures of taste refresh the mind after the toilsof the Intellect, and the labours of abstract study ; and they gradual- ly raise it above the attachments of sense, and prepare it for the onjoy- snents of virtue. So consonant is this to experience, that m the education of youth, DO object has in every age appeared more important to wise men, than to tincture them early with a relish for the entertainments of taste. The transition is commonly made with ease from these to the discharge of the higher and more important duties of life. Good hopes may be en- tertained of those whose minds have this liberal and elegant tuoi. Many virtues may be grafted upon it. Whereas to be entirely devoid of relish' for eloquence, poetry or any of the fine arts, Is justly construed to be aa unpromising symptom of youth ; and raises suspicions of their being prone to low gratifications, or destined to drudge in the more vulgar and illiberal pursuits of life. There are indeed few good dispositions of any kind with which ihe im- provement of taste is not more or less connected. A cultivated taste in- creases sensibility to all the tender and humane passions, by giving them frequent exercise ; while it tends to weaken the more violent and fierce emotions. Ingenaas didicisse ffdeHter artes Emollit mores, nee sioit ease feros.* The elevated sentiments and high examples which poetry, eloquence and history are often bringing under our view, naturally tend to nourish in our minds public spirit, the love of ^ory, contempt of external fortune^ and the admiration of what is truly illustrious and great. I will not go so far as to say that the improvement of taste and of vir* tue is the same ; or that they may always be expected to co-exist in aa equal degree. More powerful correctives than tasle^ can apply, are ne- cessary for reforming the corrupt propensities which too frequently pre- vail among mankind. Elegant speculations are sometimes found to float on the surface of the mind, while bad passions possess the interior regions of the heart. At the same time this cannot but be admitted, that the exercise of taste is, in its native tendency, moral and punfying. From reading the most admired productions of genius, whether in poetry or prose, almost every ope rises with some good impressions left on his mind^ and though these may not always be durable, they are at least to be raukied among the means of disposing the heart to virtue.

LECTURE IL TASTE. 7H£ nature of the present ondertaking leads me to begin with some inquiries concerning taste, as it is this £etculty which is always appealed to, in disquisitions concerning the merit of discourse in writing. There are few subjects on which meo talk mor^ loosely and indistinctly than on taste ; few which it is more difficult to explain with precision^ and none which in this course of Lectures will appear more dry or ab- stract. Wbat I have to say on the subject, shall be in the following order. I shall first explain the Nature of Taste as a power or faculty in the hu- man mind. I shall next consider how far it is an improveable faculty, i shall shew the somrces of its improvement, and the characters of taste in its most perfect state. I shall then examine the various iuctuations ta which it is liable, and inquire whether there be any standard to which we can bring the different tastes of men, in order to distinguish the corrupted from the true. Taste may be defined '^ The power of receiving ()le«8ure from the *' beauties of nature and of art.^ The first question that occurs concern- ing it ii^hether it is to be considered as an internal sense, or as an ex- ertion of reason ? Reason is a very general term ; but if we understand by it, that power of; the mind which in speculative matters discovers truth, and in practical matters judges of the fitness of means to an end, I appre- bend tbe question, may be e^ily answered. For nothing can be more clear, than that taste is not resolvable into any such operation of reason. It is not merely through la discovery of the understanding or a deduction of argument, that the mind receives pleasure from a beautiful prospect or • a fine poem. Such objects often strike us intuitively, and make a strongs kBpffession^^ whcnwe are unable to assign the reasons of our being pleas- \\ IS TAstifc n«ct.it I ed. They «6metime« strike in the tame ihaimer the phitoiopher and the peasant; the boy and the man. Hence the faculty by which we reUflh such beauties, seems more allied to a feeling of sense, than to a Erocess of the understanding ; and acocM-dlngly from an external sense it as borrowed its name; that sense by which we receive and distinguish the pleasures of food, having, in sevend langvages, given rise to the woi4 laste, in the metaphorical meaning ander which we now consider it. However, as in all subjects which regard the operations of the mind, the inaccurate use of words is to be carefully avoided, it most not be ifr- ferred from what 1 have said^ that reason is entirely excluded from the exertions of taste. Though taste, beyond doubt, be ultimately founded / on a certain natural and instinctive sensibility to beauty, yet reason, as I . shall shew hereafter, assists taste in many of ifs operations, and serves to ^ enlarge its power.* Tbste, in the sense in which 1 have explained it, is m faculty coaMnoa }n some degree to all men. Nothing that belongs to homau nature in mote universal than the relish of beauty of one kind or other ; of wha< is orderly, proportioned, grand, harmonioos, new, or sprightly. In chiK dren, the rudiments of taste discover themselves very early in a thousand * instances; In their fondness for regular botfies, their admiration of pio* tares and statues, and imitations of aH kinds ; and their strong attach- ment to whatever is new or marvetloas. The most ignorant peasants are delighted with ballads and tales, and are struck with the beautiful appear^ ancesof nature in the earth and heavens. £ ven in the deserts of America, where human nature shews Itself in its most uncultivated state, the sava- ges have their ornaments of dress, their war and their death songs, their harangues and their orators. We must therefore conclude the princi- ples of taste to be deeply founded in the human muid. It is no loss es- sential to man to have some discernment of beauty, than it Is to posseaa the attributes of reason and of speech.t But although none be wholly devoid of this faculty, yet the degrees in which it is possessed are widely different. In some m^ only the feeble glimmerings of taste appear ; the beauties which they relish are of the coarsest k}nd ; and of tnese they have but a weak and confused impres- * See Dr. Gersrd*s Esm^ on Ttate-^4>* Alenbert*!

In general, we may observe^ tiiat in the powers and pleasures of taste, there is a more remarkable ion equality among men than is usqaMy found in. point of common sense, rea« ton, and judgment. The constihition of our nature in this, as in all other respects, discovers admirable wisdom, in the distribution of. those talents which are necessary for man's well-being, nature hath made less distinc- tion among her children* But in the distribution of those which belong only to the ornamental part of life, she hath bestowed her lavours with Wiore fmgafity. She hath both sown the seeds more sparingly; and vendered a higher culture requisite for bringing them to perfection. This inequahty of taste among men is owing, witfaoat doubt, in part, to Ibe different frame of their natures ; to niter organs, and fmer internal ]Kywers, with which some are endowed beyond others. But if it be ow- ing in part lo nature, it is owing to education and culture still m<Nre. The lUostration of this leads to my next remark on this* subject, that taste is a SBoat improveable faculty» if there be any such in human nature ; a re* Bsark which gives great encouragement to such a cogrse of study as me awe now proposing to pursue. Of the truth of thiseassertion we may easllv be conivinced, ir^ only reflecting on that immense superiority which education and improvement give to civilised, above barbarous na* iions, in refinement of taste; and on the superioriQr which tbey give in die same nation to those who have studied the liberal arts, above the rude amd nntaogirt valgar. The difference is so great, that there is perhaps no one particular in which these two classes of men are so far removed ifom eadi other, as in respect of the powers and the pleasures of taste ; mnd assuredly for this difierence no other general cause can be assigned^ bat cohure md education* I shall now proceed to shew what the meaoa stfe by whidh taste becomes so remarkably susceptible of cultivation and progress. Reflect first upon that great law of oar nature, that exercise is the chief toorce of improvement in all oar faculties. This holds both in our bodHyf and in our mental powers. It bo\\d9 even in our external senses ^ ahhoogh these be less the subject of cultivation than any of our other Aenlties. We see how acute tne senses become in persons whose trade or buskiess leads to nice exertions of them. Touchy for instance^ be- comes infinitely more exquisite in men whose employment requires them to examine the polish of bodies, than it is in otl^rs* They who deal in Bucroscopical observations, or are accustomed to engrave on precious stooea, acqinre surprising accuracy of sight In discerning the minutest olyects; and practice in attending to dii&rent flavours and tastes of li- quors, wonderfully improves the power of distinguishing them, and of tracing their composition. Placing internal taste therefore on the foot- ing of a simple sense, it cannot be doubted that frequent exercise, and curiotis attention to its proper objects, must greatly heighten its power. Of this we have one clear proof in that part of taste, which is called an ear for music. Experience every day shews, that nothing is more im- pmreaUe. Only the simplest and plainest compositions are relished at^ first; nse and practice extend our pleasure; teach us to relish finer melody, and by degrees enable us to enter into the intricate and com- pounded pleasures of harmony. So an eve for the beauties of painting IS never all at once acqulrecU It is gradually formed by being conveJ^ant amoi^ piciureSj and studying the works oi the best masters. ^ * C i» TAStML liECT. «.

The oMral beaaties are not only in themselves saperior to all others, but ^ey exert an influenoOy eitlittr more near, or more remote, on a great variety of other objects of taste. Whefw^er tbc ofiections, characters, or actions of men are con^ cemed, (and these ceruiqly afford the noblest sulijects to genius,) there can be neither any just or afiectiag description of them, nor iSMy thorough feeling of the beauty of that description, wtthoot our possessing the vir* CttouB afi^tions. ife whose heart is indelicate or hard, he who has no act' minion of what is truly noble or.praise-werthy, nor the proper sympi^ thetic sense of what is aoft and tender, most have a vefy imperfect relish of (he highest lieattties of eloquenoe and poetiy. The characters of taste, when brought to its most perieet stale, are aH vedueiUe to two, Deikacy and Correctness. • DeKcacy of taste respects prindpaBy the perfection of that natursd sen- aibUily on which taste is founded^ It implies those finer organs orpowers which enable us to discover beanties that lie hid from a vulgar eye. 0tte aaay have strong sensibility, and yet be deficient in dehcate taste. He niay be deeply impressed by such beanties mB be pesceives; but he per- edves only what is in some degree coarse, what is bold and palpable; -while cfaairter and simpler ornaments escape hn notice. In ^is state, taste generally eatets among rude and uarefined oations. But a person 4if delicate taste both feeb strongly, and feels aoeurateiy. He sees dis» tineUoos and differences where others see none ; the moot latent beao^ does not escape hiid, and he is sensible of the smallest yenish. Delicacy of taste is judged oi by the same marics that we use in judging of the del^ cacy of an eateraal sense. As the goodness of the palate is not tried by strong flavours, but by a mixture of ingredients, where notwithstanding tlM confusion, we remain sensible of eadi; in like manner delicacy of iateffnal taste lypears, by a quick and lively seoBibili^ to its finest, asost omnpounded, or most latent obfocts. C^rectneso of taste lespects okieiy the improoemwnt wliich that fa^ cidty reoeives through its connexion with the understanding. A man of oorrect taste is one who is never imposed on by counterfeit beauties $ who carries always in bis mind that standard of good sense which he employs in judging of every thing. He estimaites with propriety the comparative merit of the several beauties which he meets with in any work of genius ; vefefs them to their prop^ classes ; assigns the prin^ dples, as far as they can be traced, whence their power c4 pleasing flows ; and is pleairad himseU* precisely in that degree in wfaidi he ougbt^ and no more. It u true, that these two qualities of taste, delicacy and correctness, BMnaHy imply each other. No taste can be exquisitely delicate with* out being eorreot ; •nor can be thoroughly correct without being delicate^ Bat slIH a predominaocy of one or other qualitf in the mixture is oAen visible. The power of ^lefeacy is chiefly seen in diicening the true merit of a wofk; th« p6wer of correctness, in rtjectaig (Use preleii- ! «ions to merit. Delicacy^ leans more lo jfeeling ; correctness, more to reason and judement. The former is more the gift of nature ; the latter^ more the prodi^ of culture and art Among the ancient critics^ Lon* ginos possessed most delicacy^ Aristotle, most correctness. Among the modems, Mr. Addison is a faigh example of delicate taste ; Dean Swift^ had he written on the subject of criticism, would perhaps have afforded the example of a correct one* Haying viewed taste in its most improved and perfect state, I come next to consider its deviations from that state, the fluctuations and changes to which it is liable; and to inquire whether, in the midst of these, there be any means of distinguishing a true frum a corrupted taste. This brings us to the most difficult part of our task. For it must be ecknow* lodged, that no principle of the human mind is, in its operations, more fluctuating and capricious than taste. Its variations have been so great and frequent, as to create a suspicion with some, of its being merely tf'r* bitrary ; grounded on no foundation, ascertainable by no standard, but wholly dependent on changing fancy ; the consequence of which would be, that all studies or regular inquiries concerning the objects of taste were vain. In architecture, the Grecian models were long esteemed the most perfect In succeeding ages, the Gothic architecture alone prevailed, and afterwards the Grecian taste revived in all its vigour, and engrossed the public admiration. In eloquaice and poetry, the Asiatics at no time relished any thing but what was full of ornament, and splen- did in a degree that we shoul(f denominate gaudy; whilst the Greeks admired only chaste and simple beauties, and despised the Asiatic os- tentation. In our own country, how many writings that were greatly extolled two or three centuries ago, are now fallen into entire disrc- pute and oblivion ? Without goipg back to remote instances, how verfr diflerent is the taste of poetry which prevails in Great-Britain now,^ from what prevailed there no longer ago than the reign of king Charles II. which the authors too of that time deemed an Augustan age : whea nothing waff in vogue but an affected brilliancy of wit ; when the simple majesty of Milton was overlooked, and Paradise Lost almost entirely unknown ; when Cowley's laboured and unnatural conceits were admir- ed as the very quintessence of genius ; Waller's gay sprightUness was mistaken for the tender spirit of love poetry; and such writers as Suckling and Etheridge were held in esteem for dramatic composition. The question is, what conclusion we are to form from such instanoes as these ? Is there any thing that can be called a standard of taste, by appealing to which we may distinguish between a good and a bad taste P Or, is there in truth no such distinction : and are we to hold that, accord* iog to the proverb, there is no disputing of tastes ; but that whatever pleases is right, for that reason that it does please ? This is the question^ and a very nice and subtle one it is, which we are now to discuss. 1 begin by observing, that if there be no such thing as any standard of taste, this /consequence must immediately follow, that all tastes are equally good ; a position, which, though it may pasd unnoticed in slight matters, and when we speak of the lesser diftrences among the tastes of men, yet when we apply it to the extremes, its absurdity becomes glaring. For is there any one who will seriously maintain that the taste of a Hottentot or a Laplander is as delicate and as correct as that of a l<onginus or im Addison ? or, that he can be charged with no defect er UBCT. 11.1 TASTE. S| Mcapacity who tidnkf tt cdrnmoD news writer as excellent an historian as Tacitus ? As it would be held downright extravagance to talk in this maooer, we -are led unavoidably to this conclusion, that there is some Jbondatioa for the preference of one man's taste to that of another; or that there is a good and a bad^ a right and a wrong in taste, as in othet things, Botto prevent mistakes ou this subject, it is necessary to observe next, that the diversity of tastes which prevails among mankind, does not in every case iafer corruption of taste, or oblige us to seek for some standard In order to de^temine who are in the right. The tastes of men may differ very considerably as to their object, and yet none of them be wrong. One man relishes poetry most ; another takes pleasure in Bolhii^ but history. One prefers comedy ; another tragedy. One ad- mires the simple; another, the ornamented style. The young are amused with gay and sprightly compositions. The elderly are more entertained with those of a graver cast. Some nations dehght in bold pictures of manners, and strong representations of passion. Others in*^ dine to more correct and regular elegance both in description and senti- ment. Though all differ, yet all pitch upon some oae beauty which pe-' euliarly suits their turn of mind ; and therefore no one bas a title to con- demn the rest. It is not in matters of taste, as in questions of mere reason, where there is but one conclusion that can be true, and all the rest are erroaeons. Truth, which is the object of reason, is one ; beaoty, which is the object of taste, is manifold. Taste therefore admits of latitude.and diversity of objects, in sufficient consistency with goodness or justness of taste. Sot then, to ezj^in this matter thoroughly, I must observe farther, that this admissible diversity of tastes can only have place where the objects of taste are difierent. Where it is with respect to the same ob- ject that men disagree, wheli one condemns that as ugly, which another admires as highly beautiful; then it is no longer diversity, but direct opposition of taste that takes place ; and therefore one must be in the lif^t, and another in the wrong, unless that absurd paradox were allowed to hoM, that all tastes are equally good and true, v One man prefers Vir- gil to Homer. Suppose that I, on the other hand, admire Homer more than Virgil* I have as yet no reason to say that our tastes are contra- dictory. The other person is more struck with the elegance and tender- ness which are the characteristics of Virgil; I, with the simplicity and fir^of Homer. As long as neither of us deny that both Homer and Vir- gil have great beauties, our difference fdls within the compass of that diversity of tastes, which f have shewn to be natural and allowable. But if the other man shall assert that Homer bas no beauties whatever ; that he holds him to be a dull and spiritless writer, and that he would as soon peruse any old legend of night errantry as the Iliad ; then 1 exclaim, that my antagonist either is void of all taste, or that his taste is corrupted in a miserable degree ; and 1 appeal to whatever I think the standard of taste, to shew him that he is in the wrong. What that standard is, to which, in such opposition of tastes, we are obliged to have recourse, remains to be traced. A standard properly signifies, that which is of such undoubted Authority as to be the test of o&er things of the same kind. Thus a standard weight or measure, is that which is appointed by law to regulate all other measures and weights. V 32 luusTfi. iMJEcr^m. Thas the court is sftid to be ihe standaff d of good iiKMihiB I imdtbeicii^ lure of theological truth. When we say that nature is the staodard^of taste, «e lay down a.prii^ ciple vexy true and just^ as far as it can be applied. There is no doubt, that in all cases where an imitation is intended of some object that eaista in nature, as in representing huoian characters or actions, coofor^uty to nature affi>rds a fuU and distinct criterion of what is truly beautiful. Rea- son bath in such cases full scope for exerting its authority ; for appranr* ing or condemning; by comparing the copy with the oriinnal. But ' tliere are innun^erable cases in wbich this rale cannot be at mi applied^ and conformity to nature, is. an eipressioa frequently osed, without muf distinct or determinate meaning. We must therefore search for some- what that can be rendered more dear mad precise, to be the standard of taste. ^ Taste, as I before explained it, is ultimately founded on an internal tense of beauty, which is natural to men, and which, in its application to , particular objects, is capable of being guided and enlightened by reasan* Kow were there any one person who possessed in foil perfection all tho powers of human nature, whose internal senses were in eyery instunce eacquisfte and just, and whose reason was unerring and sure, the determi- ' nations of sudi a person oanceming beauty, would, beyond doubt, be it perfect standard for the taste of idl others. Wherever their taste dkSer^ ed from his, k could be imputed only to some imperfection in their natii- ral powers. But as there is no such living standard^ no one person to ^whom all mankind will allow such submission to be due, what is there of sufficient authority to be the standard of the various and opposite tastes of men ? Alost certainly there is nothing but the taste, as far as it can be gathered, of human nature. That which men concur ibe most in admiiv ing, must be held to be beautiful. His taste must be esteenfed just and true, which coincides with the general sentiments of men« In thu stand- ard we must rest To the sense of mankind the ultimate appeal most ever lie, in all works of taste. If ai^ one should maintain that sugar waa bitter and tobacco was ;iweet, no reasonings could avail to prove it The taste of such a person would infallibly be held to be diseased, merely bo^ cause it differed so widely from the taste of the species to whi^ lie be* longs. In like manner, with regard to the objects of sentiment or inters nal taste, the common feelings of men carry tfate sane authority, and haivo a title to regulate the tasle of every individuaL But have we then, it will be said, no other criterion of what is beii|iti«> ful, than the approlmtioa of the majority ? Must we collect the voices of others, before we form any judgment for ourselves^ of what deserves ap- plause in eloquence or poetry? By no means; there are principles of reason and sound judgment which can be applied to matters of taste, «a well as to the subjects of science and philosophy. He who admires or censures any work of genius, is always ready, if his taste be in any degree improved, to assign some reasons fm- his decision. He appeals to prin- ciples, and points out the grounds on which he proceeds. Taste is a eoct of compound power, in which the light of the understanding always min- gles, more or less, with the feelings of sentiment. But theugh reason can carry ns a certain ^gth in judging coDceming works of taste, it is not to be forgotten thai the nldmate conclusions to which our reasonings lead, refer at last to sense and perception.

I by no means pretend, that there is any standard of taste^ to which, ia every particular instance, we can resort for clear and immediate deter- mination. Where, indeed, is such a standard to be found for deciding any of those great controversies in reason and philosophy, which per- petually divide mankind ? In the present case, there was plainly no oc- casion for any such strict and absolute provision to be made. In order to judge what is morally good or evil, of what man ought, or ought not in duty to do, it was fit that the means of clear and precise determination should be afforded us. But to ascertain in every case with the utmost exactness what is beautiful or elegant, was not at aU necessary to the happiness of man. And therefore some diversity in feeling was hens allowed (o take place } and room was left' for discussion and debate, con- cerning the degree of approbation to which any wdrk of genius is entitled. The conclusion, which it is sufficient for us to rest upon, is, that taste 18 far from being an arbitrary principle, which is subject to the fancy of every individual, and which admits of no criterion for determining whether it be false or true. Its foundation is the same in all human minds. It is built upon sentiments and perceptions which belong to our nature ; and which, in general, operate with the same uniformity as our other ^ intellectual principles. When these sentiments are perverted by igno- rance and prejudice, they are capable of being rectified by reason. Their sound and natural state is ultimately determined, by comparing them widi the general taste of mankind. Let men declaim as much as they please, concerning the caprice and the uncertainty of taste, it is found, by expe- rience, that there are beauties, which, if they be displayed In a proper light, have power to command lasting and general admiration. In every composition, what interests the imagination, and touches the heart, pleases all ages and all nations. There is a certain string, to which, whes properly struck, the human heart is so made as to answer. Hence the universal testimony which the most improved nations <^ the earth have conspired, throughout a long tract of ages, to give to some few works of genius ; such as the Iliad of Homer, and the ^neid of Virgil. Hence the authority which such works have acquired, as stand- ards in some degree of poetical composition ; since from them we are enabled to collect what the sense of mankind is, concerning those beau- ties which give them the highest pleasure, and which therefore poetry ought to exhibif. Authority or prejudice may, in one age or country, give a temporary reputation to an indifferent poet or a Iwd artist ; but when foreigners, or when posterity examine his works, his fisidts are dis- cerned, and the genuine taste of human nature appears. ^ Opinioaum ^ commenta delet dies ; natur® judioia cooirmat^' Time overthrows. the illusions of oplnio^i, but establishes the deciftons of aaturet ( as ) LECTURE III CiirnCISM....Gi:NK7S..JPL£ASUBES OF TASTE.... SUBUMITT IN OBJECTS. ^ X ASTEy cnticism, and genius, are words currently employed, without distinct ideas annexed to them. In beginning a course of lectures where such words must often occur, it is necessary to ascertain their meaning with some precision. Having in the last lecture treated of taste, 1 pro* eeed to explain the nature and foundation of criticism. True criticism is the application of taste and of good sense to the several fine arts. The object which it proposes, is to distinguish what is beautiful and what is HxAXy in every peformance ; from particular instances to ascend to gene- ral principles ; and so to form rules or conclusions concerning the several kinds of beauty in works of genius. The rules of criticism are not formed by any induction, a priorij as it is called ; that is, they are not formed by a train of abstract reasoning, in* dependent of facts and observations. Criticism is an art founded wholly on experience ; on the observations of such beauties as have -come near- est to the standard which 1 before established : that is, of such beauties as have been /ound to please mankind most generally. For example ; Aristotle's rules concemmg the unity of action in dramatic and epic com- position, were not rules first discovered by logical reasoning and then applied to poetry ; but they were drawn from the practice of Homer and Sophocles: they were founded upon observing the superior pleasure which we receive from the relation of an action which is one and entirci beyond what we receive from the relation of scattered and uncon- nected facts. Such observations taking their rise at first from feeling and experience, were found on examination to be so consonant to reason and to the principles of human nature, as to pass into established rules and to be conveniently applied for judging of the excellency of any per- formance. This is the most natural account of the origin of criticism. A masterly genius, it is true, will of himself, untaught, compose in such a manner as shall be agreeable to the most material rules of criticism : for as these rules are founded in nature, nature will often suggest them io practice. Homer, it is more than probable, was acquainted with n^ systems of the art of poetry. Guided by genius alone, he composed fh verse a regular story, which all posterity has admired. But this is no argument against the i|sefulness of criticism as an art. For as no human geaitts is perfect, there is no writer but may receive assistance from critical observations upon the beauties and faults of those who have gone before him. No observations or rules can indeed supply the defect of genius, or inspire it where it is wanting. But they may often direct it in- to its proper channel; they may correct its extravagancies, and point out to It the most just and proper imitation of nature. Critical rules are de- signed chiefly to shew the faults that ought to be avoided. To nature wf must |>e indebted for the production of eminent beauties. D 26 CRmCISV. lUCT. IB. From whal has been said, we are enabled to form a iodgment coneem* ing those complaints which it has^ong been faihionabfe for petty authors to make against critics and criticism. Critics have been represented as the great abridgers of the native Uberty of genius ; as tlie imposers of unnatural shackles and bonds upon writers, from whose cruel persecu- tion they must fly to the public, and implore its protection. Such suppli* catory prefaces are not calculated to give very favourable ideas of thege* mis of the author. For every good writer will be pleased to have his work examined by the principles of sound understanding and true taste* The declamations against criticism. comtaionly proceed upon thb supposi- tion, that critics are such as judge by rule, not by feeling ; which is so far from being true, that they who judge after this manner arepedants, not cri- tics. For all the rules of genuine criticism I have shewn to be ultimately founded on feeling; and taste and feeling are necessary to guide us in the application of these rules to every particular instance. As there is noth- ing in which all sorts of persons more readily affect to be judges than in works of taste, there is no doubt that the number of incompetent critics will always be great. But this aObrds no more foundation for a general invective against criticism, than the number of bad philosophers or rea- Boners afibrds against reason and philosophy. An objection more plausible may be formed against criticism, from the applause that some performances have received from the pubKc, which, when accurately considered, are found to contradict the rules established by criticism. Now, according to the principles laid down in the last lec- ture, thepublic is the supreme judge to whom the last appeal must be made in every work of taste ; as the standard of taste is founded on the senti- inents that are natural and common to all men. But with respect to this, we are to observe, that the sense of the public is often too hastily judged of. The genuine public taste does not always appear in the first applause Iflven upon the publication of any new work. There are both a great vulgar and a small, apt to be catched and dazzled by very superficial beau- 'ties, the admiration of which in a little time passes away; and sometimes a writer may acquire great temporary reputation merely by hb compli- ance with the passions or prejudices, with the party spirit or supersti- tious notions that may chance to rule for a time almost a whole nation. In such cases, though the public may seem to praise, true criticism may with reason condemn ; and it will in progress of time gain the ascendant : for the judgment of true criticism, and the voice of the public, when once become unprejudiced and dispassionate, will ever coincide at last* Instances, 1 admit, there are, of some works that contain gross trans- gressions of the laws of criticism, acquiring, nevertheless, a general, and even a lasting admiration. Such are the plays of Shakspeare, which considered as dramatic poems, are irregular in the highest degree. But then we are to remark, that they have gained the public admiration, not by tlieir being irregular, not by their transgressions of the rules of art, but in spite of such transgressions. They possess other beauties which are conformable to just rules ; and the force of these beauties has been so great as to overpower all censure, and to give the public a degree of satisfaction superior to the disgust arising from their bleas- ishes. Shakspeare pleases, not by his bringing the transactions of many years into one play ; not by his grotesque mixtures of tragedy and comedy in one piece, nor by the strained thoughts and afiEected wit- ticisms, which he sometimes employs. These we consider at Men- Uicrr.jii.] m^^d. aor ishesy Md impute them to the grotgness of the age in which be Hved. But he pleases by his aniinated and inasterly representations of char- acteis, by the liveliness of his descriptions^ the force of his sentiments, ajid bU possessing, beyond all writers, the natural language of passion: Beaaties which criticism no less teaches us to place in the highest nuik^ thaa nature teaches us to feeL This much it may suffice to have con- cemioi; the origin, office, and importance of criticism. I proceed next to explain the meaning* of another term, which th^e, wiU he freque^it occasion to employ in these lectures ; that is, genius. Tnsfe and genius are two words frequentlyjoined together ; and therefore by inaccurate thinkers, confounded, lliey signify, however^ two.qiiite different things. The difference between them can be clearly ^iated out f and it is of importance, to remember it. Taste consists in the power of judging ; genius, in the power of executing. One may kave a considerable degree of taste in poetry, eloquence, or any of the fine arts, who has little or hardly any genius for composition of execution in any of these arts : hut genius caiinot be found without including taste also. Genius, therefore, deserves to be considered as a higher power of the mind than taste. Genius always imports something inventive or ereative; which doe^' not rest in mere sensibility to beauty where it IB perceived, but which cam, moreover, produce new beauties, and ex- hibit then^ in such a manner as strongly to impress the minds of others. Refined taste forms a good critic; but genius is farther necessary to foim the poet, or the orator. It is proper also to observe, that genius is a word, which, in common acceptation, extends much farther than to the objects of tas^te. It li - aaed to signify that Udent or aptitude which we receive from nature, for ezcelUng in- any one thing whatever. Thus we speak of a genius for Mathematics, as well as a genius for poetry ; of a genius for war, for politics, or for any mechanical employments This talent or aptitude for excelling in some one particular, is, I have said, what we receive from nature. By art and study, no doubt, it may be gpreatty improved ; but by them alone it cannot be acquired. As gienios, is a higher faculty than taste, it is ever, according to the usual frugality of nature, more limited in the sphere of its operations. It Is not uacommon to meet with persons who have an excellent taste in several of the polite arts, such as music, poetry, painting, and. elo- qaeoce, altogether: but, to find one who is an excellent performer in all these arts, is much more rare ; or rather, indeed, such an one is not to he looked for. A sort of universal genius, or one who is equally and iadiflerendy turned towards several different professions and arts, is not likdy to excel in any. Although there may be some few exceptionS|' yet in general it holds, that when the bent of the mind is wbolly directed towards some one object, exclusive in a manner of others, there is the lairest prospect of eminence in that, whatever it he. The rays must converge to a point, in order to glow intensely. This remark I here cbooae to make, on account of its great importance to young people ; iq leadipg them to examine with care, and to pursue with ardour^ the cur- rent and pointing of nature towards those exertions of genius in which tiiey are most likely to excel. A gemuafor any of the £ne arts, as I before observed, always sup- poses taste ; and it is dear, that the improvement of taste will serve heA to forward and to carrect the operations of genius, In proportion PLKASOIQES OF TAfltf. (tBCt. IH. miS the ta8t<e of a poet, or oratofi becomei mow ivefioed wHh retpeet to the beauties of compositioo, it wiR certainly asaUt him to produce the more finished beauties id his work. Geolos showever, in a; poet or orator, may sometimes exist in a higher degree than taste ; thai isp genius may be bold and strong, when taste is neither verjdeKcate, nor very correct. This is often the case in the infancy of arts ; a period^ wlMn genius frequently exerts itself with great vigour, and execotes wm much warmth; while taste, which requires experience, and im* proves by slower degrees, hath not yet attained Its fuU growth. Homer and Shakspeare are proofs of what I now assert; in whose admirable ifritings are found instances of rudeness and indelicacy, which the mofe refined taste of later writers, who had far inferior genius to them, would have taught them to avoid. As all human perfection is limited, this may very probably be the law of our nature, that it is not given to one man to execute with vigour and fire, and, at the same time, to attend to all the lesser and more refined graces that belong to the exact per^ fection of his work : while on the other hand, a thorouf^ taste for these inferior graces is, for the most part, accomimnied with a diminution of ^biimity and force. Having thus explained the nature of taste, the nature and importance of criticism, and the distinction between taste and genius ; I am now to enter on considering the sources of the pleasures of taste. Here opens a very extensive field j no less than all the pleasures ' of the imagination, as they are commonly called, whether afforded us by natural objects, or by the imitations and descriptions of them. Bat it is not necessary to the purpose of my lectures, that all these should be (Examined fully ; the pleasure which we receive from discourse, or writing, being the main object of them. All that I propose is to give some openings into the pleasures of taste in general ; and to insist more particularly upon sublimity and beauty. We are far from having yet attained to any system concerning this subject. Mr. Addison was the first who attempted a regular inquiry, in }iis Essay on the pleasures of the Imagination, published in the sixth volume of the Spectator. He has reduced these pleasures under three heads ; beauty, grandeur and novelty. His speculations on this subject, If not exceedingly profound, are, however, very beautiful and entertain- ing ; and he has the merit of having opened a track, which was before unbeaten. The advances made since his time in this curious part of philosophical criticita, are not very considerable ; though some ingenious writers have pursued the subject. This is owing, doubtless, to that thinness, and subtilty, which are found to be properties of all the feel- ings of taste. They are engaging objects ; but when we would lay firm hold of them ; and subject Uiem to a regular discussion, they are sdways ready to elude our grasp. It is difficult to make a full enumeration of the several objects that give pleasure to taste : it is more difficult to define all those which have been discovered and to reduce them under proper classes ; and, when we would go farther, and investigate the efficient causes of the pleasure which we receive from such objects, here^ above all, we find ourselves at a loss. For instance; veall learn by experience, that certain figures of bodies appear to us more beautiful than others. Ori inquiring farther, we find that the regularity of some figures, and the graceful variety of others, are the foundation of the beauty which we discern in them | bat when we attempt to |pD a stqp LBci. mi suBLiMmr in ouscts. ^ beyond ttis, and inquire what is the catne of regtdarity and variety pfodoafcig ia our miiids the sensation of beauty^ any reason we can as- sign k extremely imperfect. These first princii^es of internal sensation, nature seems to have covered with an impenetrable veil. It i» some comfort^ however, that although the efficient catate be obsenre, the final cause of those sensations lies in many cases more open ; and, ia entering on this subject, we cannot avoid taking notic# of the strong hnpression which the powers of taste and imagination are calculated to give us of the benignity df our Creator. By endow- ing OS with such powers, he hath widely enlarged the sphere of the pleasure of human life; and those, too, of a kind the most pure and innoeent. The necessary purposes of life might have been abundantly answered, thoogh our senses of seeing and hearing had only served to distinguish external objects, without conveying to us any of those re- ined and d^lkate sensations of beauty and grandeur, i^th which we, are now so much delighted. This additional embellishment and^ry, which for promoting our entertainment, the Author of Nature hath poured forth upon bis works, is one striking testimony, among many others, of benevolence and goodness. Thisuiought, which Mr. Addi- son first started. Dr. Akenside, in his poem on the Pleasures of the ima- piiatiOB, has happily pursued^ Not content With every f*od of life to nofwish miuiy Bv kiiid tUneions of the wondering lene, Tnou mak'st all nature beanty to his ejre. Or music to his ear. I shall begin with considering the pleasure which arises from sub* Bniity or grandeur, of which I propose to treat at some length ; f>oth, as this has a character more precise and distinctly marked than any other of the pleasures of the imagination, and as it coincides more di- rectly with our main subject For the greater distinctness I shall, first, treat of the grandeur or sublimity of external objects themselves, which will employ the rest of this lecture ; and, afterwards, of the duscrip- tion of such objects, or, of what is called the sublime in writing, which shall be the subject of a following lecture. I distinguish these two things from one another, the grandeur of the objects themselves when they are presented to the eye, and the description of that grandeur in discourse or writing ; though most critics, inaccurately I think, blend them together ; and I consider grandeur and sublimity, as terms synon* ymous, or nearly so. If there be any distinction between them, it arises from sublimity's expressing grandeur in its highest degree.* It is not easy to describe, in words, the precise impression which great and sublime objects make upon us, when we behold them 5 but every one has a conception of it. It consists in a kind of admiration and expansion of the mind ; it raises the mind much above its ordinary state, and fills it with a degree of wonder and astonishment, wUch it cannot well express. The emotion is certainly delightful ; but it is al- together of the serious kind; a degree of awfulness and soleilinity^, even approaching; td severity, commonly attends it. when at its height ; very distingubhaoie from the more gay and brisk emotion raised \\>y beautiful objects.

It is to be remarked, iv>werer| that space ex- tended in length, makes not so strong an impression as height or depth* Though a boundless plain be a grand object, yet a high mountain, to which we look up, or an awful precipice or tower whence we look down on the objects which lie beloar^ is still more so.

Hence infinite space, endless numbers, and eternal duration, fill the mind with grreat ideas. Frecn this some have imagined, that vastness^ or amplitude of exleat| IS the foundation of all sabiimity. But I cannot be of this opinion, be- caupe many objects appear suUime which have, no relation to space at alL Such, <for instance, is great loudness of sound. The burst of thunder or of cannon, the roaring of winds, the.shouting of multitudes, the sound of vast cataracts of waters are ail incontestibly grand objects. '^ I heard *^ the voice of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters, and of << mighty thunderings, saying, Allelujah.\" In general we may observe, that grt?at power and strength exerted, always raise sublime ideas ^ and perhaps the most copious source of these is derived from this quarter. Hence the grandeur of earthquakes, and burning mountains ; of great Conflagrations ; of the stormy ocean, and overfiowing waters ; of tem« pests of wind ; of thunder and lightning ; and of all the uncommon vio- lence of the elements. Nothing is more sublime than mighty power and strength. A stream that runs within its banks, is a beac^tiful object, but when n rushes down with the impetuosity and noise of a torrent, it pre- sently becomes a sublime one. From lions and other animals of strength, are drawn sublime comparisons by poets. A . race-horse is looked upon with pleasure ; but it is the warhorse, ^* whose neck is clothed with '' thunder,\" that carries grandeur in its idea. The engagement of two great armies, as it is the highest exertion of human might, combines a ▼ariehr of sources of the sublime ; and has accordingly been always considered as one of the most striking and magnificent spectacles that can be either presented to the eye, or exhibited to the imagination in description. For the further illustration of this subject, it is proper to remark, that all ideas of the solemn and awful kind, and even bordering on the terriblOi tend greatly to assist the sublime ; such as darkness, solitude and silence. What eu'e the scenes of nature that elevate the mind in the highest de- gree, and produce the sublime sensation ? Not the gay landscape, the flowery field, or the flourishing city ; but the hoary mountain, and the soli- tary lake ; the aged forest, and the torrent falling over the rock. Hence Ao^, night-scenes are commonly the most sublime.

Though it render' the object indistinct, the impression, however, may be great ; for, as an ingenious author has well observed, it is one thing te make an idea clear, and another to^ make it affecting to the imagination ; and tbe imarination may be strongly affected, and? in fact, often is so, br objects of itnich we have no clear conception. Thus we see, that almost all tbe descnptions given us of tbe appearances of supernatural beings, carry some sublimity, though the conceptions which they afford us be confused and indistinct. Their sublimity arises from the ideas, whick they always convey, of superior power and might, joined with an awful obscurity. We may see this fully exemplified in tbe following noble pas- sage of the book of Job.

J[L£GT. UC << God ?\"t (Job IT. 15.) no ideas, it is t>lain, are so suUIme at fhose ta* ken from the supreme being ; the most unknoWD, bat die greatest of all objects ; the infinity of whose nature, and the eterniQr of whose duratkiai joined with the omnipotence of his power, though they surpass our coi^ ceptions, yet exalt them to the highest. In genend, all objects diat tare greatly raised above us, or far removed from us, either in space or in time, are apt to strike us as great Our viewing them, as through the mist of distance or antiquity, is favourable to the impressions of their sub- limity. As obscurity, so disorder too, is very compatible with grandeur ; nay, frequently heightens it Few things that are strictly regular and method- ical, appear silblime. We see the limits on every side; we feel our- selves confined; there is no room for the mind's exerting any great eflbrt. Exact proportion of parts, though it enters often into the beautiful, is much disregarded in the sublime. A great mass of rocks, thrown togeth- er by the hand of nature with wildness and confusimi, strike the mind with more grandeur, than if they had been adjusted to each other with tk^ most accurate symmetry. In the feeble attempts, which human art can make towards produ- cing grand objects, (feeble I mean, in comparison with the powers of na- ture) greatness of dimensions always constitutes a principal part No pile of building can convey any idea of sublimity, unless it be ample and lofty. There is, too, in architecture, what is called greatness of man- ner I which seems chiefly to arise, from presenting the object to us in one full point of view ; so that it shall make its impression whole, entire| and undivided upon the mind. A Gothic cathedral raises ideas of gran* deur in our minds, by its size, its height, its awful obscurity, its strength, its antiquity, and its durability. There still remains to be mentioned one class of sublime objects, which may be called the moral, or sentimental sublime ; arising from certain ex- ertions of the human mind ; from certain affections, and actions, of our fellow-creatures. These will be found to be all, or chiefly, of that class, which comes under the name of magnanimity or heroism ; and they pro- duce an efiect extremely similar to what is produced by the view of grand objects in nature ; filling the mind with admiration, and elevating it above itself. A noted instance of this, quoted by all the French critics, is the celebrated Qtf't2 MaunU of Corneille, in the tragedy of Horace. In the famous combat between the Horatii and the Curiatii, the old Horatiua being informed that two of his sons are slain, and that the third had foe- taken himself to flight, at first will not believe the report ; but being thoroughly assured of the fact, is fired with all the sentiments of hig^ honour and indignation at this supposed unworthy behaviour of his surviv- ing son. He is reminded, that his son stood alone against three, cuid ^ t TIm picture which Lu<aretias has drawn of the domioion of superstition over kiod, representing it as a portentous spectre showing its head from the cloodsy and dismaying the whole human race with its countenance, together with the magnanimity of Epicurus in ralsiag himself up against it| carries all the grandeur of a sublliQe, obscure* and awful image.

''To have died,\" he answers. In the same manner Porus, taken prisoner by Alexander, after a gallant defence, and asked in what manner he would be treated ? an- awtrin;^, '' Like a king ;'' and Cssar chiding the pilot who was afraid to set out with him in the storm, '* Quid times ? C^sarem vehis ;'' are good Instances of this sentimental sublime. Wherever, in some critical and high situation, we behold a man uncommonly intrepid, and resting upon himself; superior to passion and .to fear ; animated by some great prin- ciple to the contempt of popular opinion, of selfish interest, of dangers or of death; there we are struck with a sense of the sublime.* High virtue is the most natural apd fertile source of this moral sublimity. However, on some occasions, where virtue either has no place, or is but imperfectly displayed, yet if extracMmary vigour and force of mind be discovered, we are not insensible to a degree of grandeur in the charac* ter ; and from the splendid conqueror, or the daring conspirator, whom we are far from approving, we cannot withhold our admiration.t I have now enumerated a variety of instances, both in inanimate objects and in human life, wherein the sublime appears. In all these instances, the emotion raised in us is of the same kind, although the objects that produce the emotion be of widely different kinds. A question next arises, . whether we are able to discover some one fundamental quality in which all these diderent objects agree, and which is the cause of their producing an emotion of the same nature in our minds ? Various hypothesis have been formed concerning this ; but, as far as appears to me, hitherto un* satisfactory. Some have imagined that amplitude, or great extent, joined with simplicity, is either immediately, or remotely, the fundamental * The sublime, in natural and in moral objects, is brought before us in one Tiew, and compared togetherj in the following beautiful passage of Akenside's pieasttrss of the imagination.
