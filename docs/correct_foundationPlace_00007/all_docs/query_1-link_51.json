        "text": "The paper tackles the issue of agencification in two former communist countries, Lithuania and Romania, based on data collected in 2008 and 2010 using the COBRA CRIPO survey. Its main goal is to understand in what degree country specific variables and agency level variables explain the degree and type of autonomy and control faced by agencies in both countries, but also to explore the potential impact of agencification on the use of managerial steering techniques at agency level. The article is divided into three main sections. The first part describes the theoretical background and the hypotheses for the analysis of agency control and steering in Lithuania and Romania. The second part presents the methodology and main findings, while the third part outlines the key observations concerning the hypothesis and the control and steering patterns in both countries. Lastly, the paper discusses the implications of the statistical findings and lays the ground for future research.\n\nAbstract A general trend is easily observable in the literature on public administration reforms in postcommunist countries and it consists in analyses of the degree of adoption and success of the New Public Management (NPM) model. Relevant implementation gaps for some levers as well as areas of reform, which cannot be ascribed to the NPM in these countries, are highlighted.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1991, a giant region of the world underwent revolutionary change. To this day, it is widely referred to as Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). This book represents an overview and a reflection of changes in countries that implemented the most profound public administration reforms (PAR) – countries that joined the European Union (EU) between 2004 and 2013. Contributors to this book are prominent public administration researchers in their respective countries; this allows for in-depth insights both into the history of reforms, as they were experienced and into current topics of PAR as they are debated at the national level. We find that the concept of CEE has lost relevance in public administration research, and we are in need of a more nuanced theory. In the face of mounting challenges to EU integration this book, we believe, will contribute to the search of public governance solutions for the benefit of all Europeans.\n\nThe objective of the survey is to provide insight into the personal experiences and views of senior civil servants about public governance and the application of reforms within Serbia’s public administration. The survey encompassed a representative sample of senior civil servants (2522 civil servants), who are, more than any other group of actors within the government, directly responsible for the implementation of reforms and the day to day management of the public administration.\n\nBased on the transformative approach, the NPM and post-NPM models this article explains the proliferation, autonomy, control and innovative behavior of Lithuanian agencies and other public sector organizations in the 1990-2010 period. While the expansion of governmental functions during Lithuania’s transition to democracy and its accession to the EU brought agencification in 1990-2004, the adoption of government-wide organizational reforms during the economic crisis marked the start of de-agencification in 2009- 2010. The degree of autonomy and control of the Lithuanian public sector organizations is largely explained by their legal basis and political salience of their tasks. Finally, in line with the post-NPM model, structural capacities and participation in networks have a strong impact on innovative behavior of these organizations.\n\nThe book represents an effort to conceptualize the content and dimensions of the Eastern European (EE) region post-communist / socialist transformation upon the role and results of PAR as a “success story”. The general research question that we addressed has been based on an assumption of radical change in public governance in respective countries due to their Europeanization. Simultaneously, we have envisaged that: A) PAR are facing so called implementation gap in general, B) there are crucial differences in individual (groups of) countries (e.g. among Baltic countries, Visegrad (V4) or former Austrian-Hungarian or Yugoslavian countries, etc.). Especially with regard to governance convergence towards the EU standards and among each other as well as different trajectories of divergence as the homogenizing effects of communism have faded and construct a more relevant and contemporary theory of PAR that could replace the outdated notion of one-size-fitsall post-communist / EE transformation theory."
