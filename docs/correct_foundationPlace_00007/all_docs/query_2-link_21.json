The data generated through the use of these technologies need to be analyzed for forensic purposes when criminal and terrorist activities are involved. In order to deal with the forensic implications of social networks, current research on both digital forensics and social networks need to be incorporated and understood. This will help digital forensics investigators to predict, detect and even prevent any criminal activities in different forms. It will also help researchers to develop new models/techniques in the future. This paper provides literature review of the social network forensics methods, models, and techniques in order to provide an overview to the researchers for their future works as well as the law enforcement investigators for their investigations when crimes are committed in the cyber space. It also provides awareness and defense methods for OSN users in order to protect them against to social attacks.\n\nOnline Social Networks (OSNs) play an important role for internet users to carry out their daily activities like content sharing, news reading, posting messages, product reviews and discussing events etc. At the same time, various kinds of spammers are also equally attracted towards these OSNs. These cyber criminals including sexual predators, online fraudsters, advertising campaigners, catfishes, and social bots etc. exploit the network of trust by various means especially by creating fake profiles to spread their content and carry out scams. All these malicious identities are very harmful for both the users as well as the service providers. From the OSN service provider point of view, fake profiles affect the overall reputation of the network in addition to the loss of bandwidth. To spot out these malicious users, huge manpower effort and more sophisticated automated methods are needed. In this paper, various types of OSN threat generators like compromised profiles, cloned profile...\n\nIn this paper, we present a study on the emotions conveyed in bot-generated Twitter messages as compared to emotions conveyed in human-generated messages. Social bots are software programs that automatically produce messages and interact with human users on social media platforms. In recent years, bots have become quite complex and may mimic the behavior of human users. Prior studies have shown that emotional messages may significantly influence their readers. Therefore, it is important to study the effects that emotional bot-generated content has on the reactions of human users and on information diffusion over online social networks (OSNs). For the purposes of this paper, we analyzed 1.3 million Twitter accounts that generated 4.4 million tweets related to 24 systematically chosen real-world events. Our findings show that: 1) bots emotionally polarize during controversial events and even inject polarizing emotions into the Twitter discourse on harmless events such as Thanksgiving, 2) humans generally tend to conform to the base emotion of the respective event, while bots contribute to the higher intensity of shifted emotions (i.e. emotions that do not conform to the base emotion of the respective event), 3) bots tend to shift emotions to receive more attention (in terms of likes and retweets).\n\nIn this paper, we analyze the message exchange patterns that emerge when social bots and human users communicate via Twitter. In particular, we use a multilayer network to analyze the emergence of the corresponding representative and statistically significant sub-graphs (so called motifs). Our analysis is based on two recent riot events, namely the Philadelphia Super-bowl 2018 riots and the 2017 G20 riots in Hamburg (Germany). We found that in these two events message exchanges between humans form characteristic and re-occurring communication patterns. In contrast, message exchanges including bots occur rather sporadically and do not follow a particular statistically significant pattern.\n\nThis article describes a system that participated in the Bots and Gender Profiling shared task at PAN 2019. The first objective of the task is to detect whether the author of a Twitter account is a bot or a human; and in case of human, the second objective is to identify the gender of the user account. For this purpose, we present a bayesian strategy based on features including specific content of tweets and automatically built lexicons. The best configuration of features reached 0.88 accuracy in the official Spanish test dataset and 0.81 in the English one for the bot/human classification. For gender profiling, the scores we obtained were lower, around 0.70.\n\nIn this paper, we analyze a data-set consisting of 4.5 million tweets related to four highly emotional events and investigate the interaction patterns that emerge when social bots communicate with human users. In particular, we propose an emotion-annotated n-layer multiplex network model to study the involvement of bots in the exchange of emotional messages. To this end, we study four events: a) the riots that happened during the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, b) the 2017 Charlottesville riot, c) the 2017 Catalonia independence referendum riot, and d) the riots that happened after the Philadelphia Eagles won the 2018 Superbowl. In our analysis, we found that: 1) when identifying significant triadic patterns (motifs) in the the respective communication network, a number of star-like subgraphs emerge as representative and significant communication patterns, 2) bots tend to send messages of a higher emotional intensity, as compared to humans, 3) though bots predominantly send retweets, they also compose original messages that may potentially harm the reputation of the person they are targeted at, and 4) in contrast to previous findings, we found that during riot events up to 87.18% of the involved bots actively engage in a direct communication with human users."
