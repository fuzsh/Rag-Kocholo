Morrison, who has been seleoted\n\nby Mr. Kerr as the Chairman of the\n\nways ana .means committee, is\n\na gentleman of unoeminort knowl\n\nedge and of great probity, patriotism,\n\nand persistence. ' He Is one of the\n\nweightiest men in counoil, and the most\n\nprompt and resolute in action in this\n\ncongress, trusted in nis state ana\n\nthroughout the West, a Hard-Money\n\nman, a revenue-tariff mau, and one\n\nthoroughly imbued with the latest and\n\nbest ideas of tho reformed Democracy,\n\nsteering between Scylla and Charybdis.\n\nBut General Morrison's selection tor\n\nthis important post makes it by no\n\nmeans certain that he will lead the\n\nopen House. To be sure the leadership\n\not the House has usually been con\n\nceded to the Chairman of the Ways\n\nand Means Committee and maintained by\n\nhim through whole sessions. But it is\n\nlikely enough that Speaker Kerr, who\n\ncould hardly have selected General Mor\n\nrison for his power as an orator or in\n\ndebate, has trusted to his honesty and\n\njudgment rather, and is willing to let\n\nthe noor isaaersuip oi tne House oe as\n\nsumed by whomsoever is intrinsically\n\ncapable oi it.\n\nWashington Coi rsspondence of yesterday's\n\njxew ior. xriimne.j\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, one\n\nof the most important in the organ\n\nization ul the House, will. It is reported\n\non very high authority, be oomposed of\n\nthe following named gentiemeu : .Messrs.\n\nMorrison ol Illinois, Wood of New York,\n\nThomas oi Maryland, iianuoipu oi Vir\n\nginia, Ben Hill of Georgia, Hanoook ol\n\nTexas, Blaine of Maine, Burohard of\n\nIllinois, Win. D. Kelly ot Pennsylvania,\n\nGarfield of Ohio, and Chapin ot Massa\n\nchusetts. The contest between Mr.\n\nWood and Mr. Cox lor the chairman\n\nship of tills committee has been very bit\n\nter, especially on us part oi tne lormer,\n\nand this, with the belief of the Speaker\n\nthat the Mississippi Valley is entitled\n\nto this very important and influential\n\nposition, induced him to give it\n\nto jMorrison. it is oeiieveu mat\n\nMr. Wood will feel his appointment\n\nas second ou the Committee as a\n\ndegradation, and a report is abroad to\n\nnight that ne win not accept tne posi\n\ntion. The Committee is believed tu be,\n\nwith two exceptions, composed entirely\n\nof hard-money men. The Chairman, Mr.\n\nMorrison, has been one of the most pro\n\nnounced and uncompromising advo\n\ncates ot honest currency in the West,\n\nand in 1874 distinguished himself in. the\n\nDemooratio and Liberal Convention at\n\nSpringfield by the ability and zeal\n\nwith which he .labored and spoke\n\nto prevent his party from commit\n\nting itself to the inflation heresy.\n\nHe did this, too, when his friends be\n\nlieved that it would cost him a lenomi\n\nnatiou to Congress. Of course tbis com\n\nmittee will not lavor any of the schemes\n\nof the inflationists, nor will It roport any\n\nbill for the paymeut of all or any part of\n\nthe duties on imports in paper money.\n\nWashington Correspondence of yesterday's\n\nChicago Tribune.\n\nCommitte on Ways and Means Mor\n\nrison, of Illinois, chairman; Fernando\n\nWood, Thomas ot Maryland, Randolph\n\nTucker of Virginia, Ben-Hill, Hancock\n\nof Texas, Blaine, Burchard, William D.\n\nKelley, Garfield, Chapin ot Massachu\n\nsetts. This committee, it will be seen, is a\n\nvery strong one. There is reason to be\n\nlieve that Wood, will consider his as\n\nsignment to the second place a degrada\n\ntion, and that he will in oonsequenoe\n\ndecline committee-service altogether.\n\nHe has said as muob. tlic committee is\n\na hard niooey committee. With, possi\n\nbly, two exceptions, the entire commit\n\ntee is in favor of specie resumption.\n\nThe Committee will never in\n\ndorse the greeubaok heresy of sub\n\nsfitutiug paper for gold in pay\n\nment of oustoms duties. Morrison re\n\nceived the Chairmanship for the reason\n\nthat the Speaker is of the opinion that\n\nthe Mississippi Valley is entitled to this\n\nChairmanship at the hands 6t Kerr, and\n\nfor the reason that he managed Kerr's\n\ncampaign for the Speakership.\n\n- Old Bozer.up on Pine street, is a mean\n\nfather. - When one of bis boys asks him\n\nfora pair of skates he inquires:\n\n\"My son, would you la your life down\n\nfor mef\"\n\n\"Yes, father, I would,\" is the reply.\n\n- \"Then you can't hate the skates, for\n\nto die- for me would be wicked and un\n\noalled fori\" eajts the father.\n\nThen when the other Boy asks for a\n\nsled the father ipquif e:\n\n\"My squ, would jrou die for qieP\n\n'No, sir,' promptly replies the boy.\n\n\"You wouldn't, eb Well, a boy who\n\nwouldn't die for bis father doesn't de\n\nserve a sled, aud you won't get one I\"\n\nAnd by working it that way Old Bozer\n\nkeeps the whole ramily on the edge of\n\nragged despair.
