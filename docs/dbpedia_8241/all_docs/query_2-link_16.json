        "text": "Do I need to be registered?\n\nNo. You don’t need to be registered with us as a patient for one of our caring dental teams to look after you. If you are registered with a dentist you will receive follow up treatment (if required) by them.\n\nIf you don’t have a dentist you can choose to remain a patient at our practice and we would love to be able to look after you moving forward!\n\nWhen can I be seen?\n\nWe always guarantee same day emergency appointments. We are quite busy but will always move heaven and earth to ensure you are seen the same day.\n\nProvided there is no medical contraindications, it is in your best interest and you are happy to proceed we always provide emergency treatment during your visit with us.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nYou can contact us in whatever manner is most convenient for you:\n\nCalling us on 0161 300 2099\n\nOnline chat\n\nClick to email us\n\nYou will then be triaged and offered the earliest and most convenient appointment for you.\n\nThe dentist will see you, carry out an assessment, x-rays if needed and then explain in plain language the issue and your treatment options.\n\nEmergency treatment is provided in the same visit provided there are no medical contraindications, it is in your best interest and you are happy to proceed.\n\nHow much does it cost to be seen?\n\nThe assessment fee is £49 and covers your consultation and any x-rays you require.\n\nThe treatment fees will vary depending on the emergency. We see patients for everything from broken dentures, toothache to dental trauma.\n\nFees depend on the issue and the treatment option you choose.\n\nYou are not liable for anything further to the £49 assessment until the dentist gives you an exact treatment fee.\n\nI haven’t been to the dentist for years?!\n\nThat is not an issue for us and we see many patients who have not attended a dentist for many years.\n\nWe treat all patients with care, respect and dignity.\n\nI’m EXTREMELY nervous?!\n\nWe totally understand that. It doesn’t help when you are anxious with toothache then attending a clinic you may have never attended previously.\n\nWe feel we have the most caring dental team who are specially trained in anxious patients.\n\nHave a look at our reviews below and we hope that sentiment comes across.\n\nWhat pain killers can I try?\n\nOnly take painkillers that you know you are not allergic to. Always read the label.\n\nWe would always advise consulting a qualified medical professional such as a doctor or pharmacist before taking painkillers.\n\nAre you NHS or Private?\n\nUnfortunately we do not have an NHS contract and are thus a wholly private practice."
