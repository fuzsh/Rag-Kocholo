I think it was a good\n\none. Whether it be owing to our style of living now-a-days, which tends\n\nmore to the development of brain than muscle; or whether it be, as Darwin\n\nsays, that we really are descended from the ape, and, as the years roll\n\non, are losing that essentially animal virtue--patience; certainly it is\n\ntrue that we cannot tolerate prefaces, preludes, and long graces before\n\nmeat, as our grandfathers did. A preface, like Curaçoa--and--B, before\n\ndinner, ought to be short and sweet: something merely to give an edge to\n\nappetite, or it had as well be put in the “end entoirely,” or better\n\nstill, in the fire.\n\nI presume, then, the reader is fond of the domestic cat; if only for the\n\nsimple reason that God made it. Yes; God made it, and man mars it. Pussy\n\nis an ill-used, much persecuted, little understood, and greatly slandered\n\nanimal. It is with the view, therefore, of gaining for our little fireside\n\nfriend a greater meed of justice than she has hitherto obtained, of\n\nremoving the ban under which she mostly lives, and making her life a more\n\npleasant and happy one, that the following pages are written; and I shall\n\ndeem it a blessing if I am _in any way_ successful. I have tried to paint\n\npussy just as she is, without the aid of “putty and varnish;” and I have\n\nbeen at no small pains to prove the authenticity of the various anecdotes,\n\nand can assure the reader that they are all _strictly true_.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n[_See Note B, Addenda._]\n\nPUSSY ON HER NATIVE HEARTH.\n\n“It wouldn’t have surprised me a bit, doctor,” said my gallant captain to\n\nme, on the quarter-deck of the saucy _Pen-gun_,--“It wouldn’t have\n\nsurprised me a bit, if they had sent you on board, minus the head. A nice\n\nthing that would have been, with so many hands sick.”\n\n“And rather unconvenient for me,” I added, stroking my neck.\n\nI had been explaining to the gentleman, that my reason for not being off\n\nthe night before, was my finding myself on the desert side of the gates of\n\nAden after sun-down. A strange motley cut-throat band I had found myself\n\namong, too. Wild Somalis, half-caste Indian Jews, Bedouin Arabs, and burly\n\nPersian merchants, all armed with sword and spear and shield, and long\n\nrifles that, judging by their build, seemed made to shoot round corners.\n\nStrings of camels lay on the ground; and round each camp-fire squatted\n\nthese swarthy sons of the desert, engaged in talking, eating, smoking, or\n\nquarrelling, as the case might be. Unless at Falkirk tryst, I had never\n\nbeen among such a parcel of rogues in my life. I myself was armed to the\n\nteeth: that is, I had nothing but my tongue wherewith to defend myself. I\n\ncould not help a feeling of insecurity taking possession of me; there\n\nseemed to be a screw that wanted tightening somewhere about my neck. Yet I\n\ndo not now repent having spent that night in the desert, as it has\n\nafforded me the opportunity of settling that long-disputed question--the\n\norigin of the domestic cat.\n\nSome have searched Egyptian annals for the origin of their pet, some\n\nPersian, and some assert they can trace its descent from the days of Noah.\n\nI can go a long way beyond that. It is difficult to get over the flood,\n\nthough; but I suppose my typical cat belonged to some one of the McPherson\n\nclan. McPhlail was telling McPherson, that he could trace his genealogy\n\nfrom the days of Noah.\n\n“And mine,” said the rival clansman, “from nine hundred years before\n\nthat.”\n\n“But the flood, you know?” hinted the McPhlail.\n\n“And did you ever hear of a Phairson that hadn’t a boat of his own?” was\n\nthe indignant retort.\n\nIn the midst of a group of young Arabs, was one that attracted my special\n\nattention. He was an old man who looked, with his snow-white beard, his\n\nturban and robes, as venerable as one of Doré’s patriarchs. In sonorous\n\ntones, in his own noble language, he was reading from a book in his lap,\n\nwhile one arm was coiled lovingly round a beautiful long-haired cat.\n\nBeside this man I threw myself down. The fierceness of his first glance,\n\nwhich seemed to resent my intrusion, melted into a smile as sweet as a\n\nwoman’s, when I began to stroke and admire his cat. Just the same story\n\nall the world over,--praise a man’s pet and he’ll do anything for you;\n\nfight for you, or even lend you money. That Arab shared his supper with\n\nme.\n\n“Ah! my son,” he said, “more than my goods, more than my horse, I love my\n\ncat. She comforts me. More than the smoke she soothes me. Allah is great\n\nand good; when our first mother and father went out into the mighty desert\n\nalone, He gave them two friends to defend and comfort them--the dog and\n\nthe cat. In the body of the cat He placed the spirit of a gentle woman; in\n\nthe dog the soul of a brave man. It is true, my son; the book hath it.”\n\nAfter this I remained for some time speculatively silent.\n\nThe old man’s story may be taken--according to taste--with or without a\n\ngrain of salt; but we must admit it is as good a way of accounting for\n\ndomestic pussy’s origin as any other.\n\nThere really is, moreover, a great deal of the woman’s nature in the cat.\n\nLike a woman, pussy prefers a settled home to leading a roving life. Like\n\na true woman, she is fond of fireside comforts. Then she is so gentle in\n\nall her ways, so kind, so loving, and so forgiving. On your return from\n\nbusiness, the very look of her honest face, as she sits purring on the\n\nhearth-rug, with the pleasant adjuncts of a bright fire and hissing\n\ntea-urn, tends to make you forget all the cares of the day. When you are\n\ndull and lonely, how often does her “punky humour,” her mirth-provoking\n\nattitudes and capers banish ennui. And if you are ill, how carefully she\n\nwill watch by your bedside and keep you company. How her low song will\n\nlull you, her soft caresses soothe you, giving you more real consolation\n\nfrom the looks of concern exhibited on her loving little face, than any\n\nlanguage could convey.\n\nOn the other hand, like a woman, she is prying and curious. A locked\n\ncupboard is often a greater source of care and thought to pussy, than the\n\nsecret chamber was to the wife of Blue Beard. I’m sure it is only because\n\nshe cannot read that she refrains from opening your letters of a morning,\n\nand only because she cannot speak that she keeps a secret. Like a woman,\n\ntoo, she dearly loves a gossip, and will have it too, even if it be by\n\nnight on the tiles, at the risk of keeping the neighbours awake. Oh! I’m\n\nfar from sure that the Arab isn’t right, after all.\n\nPussy, from the very day she opens her wondering eyes and stares vacantly\n\naround her, becomes an object worthy of study and observation. Indeed,\n\nkittens, even before their eyes are opened, will know your voice or hand,\n\nand spit at a stranger’s. The first year of pussy’s existence is certainly\n\nthe happiest. No creature in the world is so fond of fun and mischief as a\n\nkitten. Everything that moves or is movable, from its mother’s tail to the\n\ntable-cloth, must minister to its craze for a romp; but what pen could\n\ndescribe its intense joy, its pride and self-satisfaction, when, for the\n\nfirst time it has caught a real live mouse? This is as much an episode in\n\nthe life of a kitten, as her first ball is to a young lady just out. Nor\n\ndo well-trained and properly-fed cats ever lose this innate sense of fun,\n\nand love of the ridiculous. They lose their teeth first. I have seen\n\ndemure old cats, of respectable matronly aspect,--cats that ought to have\n\nknown better,--leave their kittens when only a day old, and gambol\n\nround the room after a cork till tired and giddy.\n\n[Illustration: BLACK and WHITE.\n\nFirst Prize--Owned by J. BRADDEN, ESQ.]\n\n[Illustration: WILD CAT (Half-Bred).\n\nFirst Prize--Owned by A. H. SEAGER, ESQ.]\n\nCats of the right sort never fail to bring their kittens up in the way\n\nthey should go, and soon succeed in teaching them all they know\n\nthemselves. They will bring in living mice for them, and always take more\n\npride in the best warrior-kitten than in the others. They will also\n\ninculcate the doctrine of cleanliness in their kits, so that the carpet\n\nshall never be wet. I have often been amused at seeing my own cat bringing\n\nkitten after kitten to the sand-box, and showing it how to use it, in\n\naction explaining to them what it was there for. When a little older, she\n\nentices them out to the garden.\n\nCats can easily be taught to be polite and well-mannered. It depends upon\n\nyourself, whether you allow your favourite to sit either on your shoulder\n\nor on the table at meal-times, or to wait demurely on the hearth till you\n\nhave finished. In any case, her appetite should never get the better of\n\nher good manners.\n\n“We always teach our cats,” writes a lady to me, “to wait patiently while\n\nthe family are at their meals, after which they are served. Although we\n\nnever keep a dish for them standing in a corner, as some people do, yet we\n\nnever had a cat-thief. Our Tom and Topsy used to sit on a chair beside my\n\nbrother, near the table, with only their heads under the level of it. They\n\nwould peep up occasionally to see if the meal were nearly over; but on\n\nbeing reminded that their time had not come, they would immediately close\n\ntheir eyes and feign to be asleep.\n\n“Poor old Tom knew the time my brother came in from business, and if five\n\nor ten minutes past his time, he would go to the door and listen, then\n\ncome back to the fireside showing every symptom of impatience and anxiety.\n\nHe knew the footsteps of every member of the family, and would start up,\n\nbefore the human ear could detect a sound, and hasten to the door to\n\nwelcome the comer. He knew the knock of people who were frequent visitors,\n\nand would greet the knock of a stranger with an angry growl.\n\n“Tom would never eat a mouse until he had shown it to some member of the\n\nfamily, and been requested to eat it; and although brought up in a country\n\nvillage, made himself perfectly at home in Glasgow, although living on the\n\nthird floor. But poor faithful fellow, after sticking to us through all\n\nthe varied changes of fourteen years, one wintry morning--he had been out\n\nall night--when I drew up the window to call him, he answered me with such\n\na plaintive voice, that I at once hastened down to see what was the\n\nmatter. He was lying helpless and bleeding among the snow, with one leg\n\nbroken. He died.”\n\nCats will often attach themselves to some one member of a family in\n\npreference to all others. They are as a rule more fond of children than\n\ngrown-up people, and usually lavish more affection on a woman than a man.\n\nThey have particular tastes too, as regards some portions of the house in\n\nwhich they reside, often selecting some room or corner of a room which\n\nthey make their “sanctum sanctorum.”\n\nTalking of her cats, a lady correspondent says:--“Toby’s successor was a\n\nblack and white kitten we called Jenny. Jenny was considered my father’s\n\ncat, as she followed him and no one else. Our house and that of an aunt\n\nwere near to each other, and on Sabbath mornings it was my father’s\n\ninvariable custom to walk in the garden, closely followed by Jenny,\n\nafterwards going in to visit his sister before going to church. Jenny\n\nenjoyed those visits amazingly; every one was so fond of her, and she was\n\nso much admired, that she began to pay them visits of her own accord upon\n\nweekdays. I am sorry to say that Jenny eventually abused the hospitality\n\nthus held out to her. For, as time wore on, pussy had, unknown to us, been\n\nmaking her own private arrangements for an event of great interest which\n\nwas to occur before very long. And this is how it was discovered when it\n\ndid come off. Some ladies had been paying my aunt a visit, and the\n\nconversation not unnaturally turned on dress.\n\n“‘Oh! but,’ said my aunt, ‘you must have a sight of my new velvet\n\nbonnet,--so handsome,--one pound fifteen shillings,--and came from\n\nLondon. I do trust it won’t rain on Sunday. Eliza, go for the box under\n\nthe dressing-table in the spare bedroom.’\n\n“Although the door of this room was kept constantly shut, the window was\n\nopened by day to admit the fresh air. It admitted more,--it admitted\n\nJenny,--and Jenny did not hesitate to avail herself of the convenience of\n\nhaving her kittens in that room.\n\n“Eliza had not been gone five minutes, when she returned screaming,--‘Oh,\n\nmurther! murther!’ that is all she said. She just ran back again,\n\nscreaming the same words, and my aunt and friends hastened after her. The\n\nsight that met their gaze was in no way alarming: it was only Jenny cosily\n\nensconced in the box--the bonnet altered in shape to suit\n\ncircumstances--looking the picture of innocence and joy as she sung to six\n\nblind kittens.\n\n“Summary and condign was the punishment that fell on the unlucky Jenny.\n\nThe kittens were ordered to be instantly drowned,--we managed to save just\n\none,--and pussy sentenced to be executed as soon as the gardener came in\n\nthe morning. This sentence was afterwards commuted to transportation for\n\nlife from my aunt’s house; and it was remarkable, that although Jenny took\n\nher Sabbath morning walks as usual with my father, she never entered my\n\naunt’s dwelling, but waited patiently until my father came out.” Jenny’s\n\nmaster died.\n\n“Jenny seemed to miss my father greatly. She used to go to the garden on a\n\nSunday, as usual, but walked up and down disconsolate and sad; and on her\n\nreturn would take up her old position outside my aunt’s door, and wait and\n\nwait, always thinking he would surely come. This constant waiting and\n\nwatching for him that would come again no more, was the first thing that\n\nsoftened my aunt’s heart to poor Jenny; and she was freely forgiven for\n\nthe destruction of the velvet bonnet, and took up her abode for life with\n\nmy aunt, on whom she bestowed all the affection she had previously\n\nlavished on my father.”\n\nKittens, like the young of most animals--mankind included--are sometimes\n\nrather selfish towards their parents. A large kitten that I knew, used to\n\nbe regularly fed with mice which its mother caught and brought to it from\n\na stack-yard. Instead of appearing grateful, he used to seize the mouse\n\nand, running growling to a corner, devour the whole of it. His mother must\n\nhave thought this rather unfair, for after standing it three or four\n\ntimes, she brought in the mouse, and slapped him if he dared to touch it\n\nuntil she had eaten her share--the hind quarters; then he had to be\n\ncontent with the rest.\n\nI knew of a cat that, in order to avoid the punishment which she thought\n\nshe merited on committing an offence, adopted the curious expedient of\n\nhaving two homes. Her failing was fish. If there had been no fish in the\n\nworld, she would have been a strictly honest cat. She warred against the\n\ntemptation, but it was of no use; the spirit was willing but the flesh\n\nweak, and the smell of fish not to be resisted. As long as she could steal\n\nwithout being found out, it was all right, things went on smoothly; but\n\nwhenever she was caught tripping, she bade good-bye for a time to that\n\nhome, and took up her quarters at the other, distant about half a mile.\n\nHere she would reside for a month or more, as the case might be, until the\n\ntheft of another haddock or whiting caused her to return to the other\n\nhouse. And so on; this cat kept up the habit of fluctuating backwards and\n\nforwards, between her two homes, as long as she lived. She was never\n\nthrashed, and, I think, did not deserve to be.\n\nIt is a common thing for a she-cat, if her kittens are all drowned, to\n\ntake to suckling a former kitten--even a grown-up son has sometimes to\n\nresume the office and duties of baby to a bereaved mother, and is in\n\ngeneral no ways loath to do so. There is a horrid cat in a village in\n\nYorkshire, who, every time his mother has kittens, steals them, taking\n\nthem one by one to the cellar, and eating them. When there are no more to\n\neat, filial piety constrains him to suckle his dam, until she deems it fit\n\nthat he should be weaned. He has been weaned already four times, to my\n\nknowledge.\n\nIf a kitten has been given away, and for some reason or other returns\n\nagain to its mother’s home, the first thing that mother does is to give\n\nhim a sound hiding, afterwards she receives him into favour, and gives him\n\nher tail to play with by way of _solatium_. Mothers will sometimes correct\n\ntheir very young kittens; for instance, if it squeals when she wants to\n\nget away for a short time, two or three smart pats with a mittened paw\n\ngenerally make it go fast asleep.\n\nThe cat’s love of fun is perhaps one of the most endearing traits in her\n\ncharacter. Who has not laughed to see the antics performed by some pet\n\ncat, whom its mistress wished to bring into the house for the night. Pussy\n\nhas been walking with her mistress in the garden; but the night is fair\n\nand moonlit, and she hasn’t the slightest intention of coming in, for at\n\nleast half-an-hour yet. So round the walks she flies, romping and\n\nrollicking, with tail in the air, and eyes crimson and green with the\n\nmischief that is in them; always popping out when least expected, and\n\nsometimes brushing the lady’s very skirts. Now she walks demurely up to\n\nher mistress, as if soliciting capture, and just as she is being picked\n\nup,--“Ah! you thought you had me, did you?” and off she scampers to the\n\nother end of the garden. Anon, she is up a tree, and grinning like an elf\n\nfrom the topmost branches; and no amount of pet names, blarney, or coaxing\n\nwill entice her down or into the house until, as they say in the north,\n\nher ain de’il bids her. Pussy’s fondness for frolic has led to strange\n\nresults sometimes, as the following will testify:--\n\nIn an old-fashioned house, in an old-fashioned parish, in the county of\n\nAberdeenshire, there lived, not many years ago, a farmer of the name of\n\nD----. His family consisted of his wife, two marriageable daughters, and a\n\nbeautiful tabby cat. This cat was well fed and cared for, and being so,\n\nwas an excellent mouser. Indeed, it was averred by the farmer that no rat\n\nwould live within a mile of her. The house stood by itself some distance\n\noff the road, but, though surrounded by lofty pine-trees, it had by no\n\nmeans the appearance of a place, which a ghost of average intellect and\n\nany claim to respectability would select, as the scene of its midnight\n\nperegrinations. Besides, there was no story attached to the house. No one\n\nhad ever been murdered there, so far as was known. No old miser had ever\n\nresided within its walls; and though several members of the family had\n\ndied in the old box-bed, they had all passed away in the most legitimate\n\nmanner. Old granny was the only one at all likely to come back; but what\n\ncould she have forgotten? The old lady was sensible to the last, and\n\nbehaved like a brick. She told them candidly she was “wearin’ awa’;” sat\n\nup in bed and in a sadly quavering voice sang the Old Hundred; then handed\n\nover the key of the tea-caddy, where she kept her “trifle siller,” with\n\nthe remark that they would find among the rest two old pennies, which she\n\nhad kept especially to be placed in her eyes when her “candle went out.”\n\nIn spite of this, however, the honest farmer and his family were all\n\nawakened one night by hearing the parlour bell rung, and rung too with\n\ngreat force. They couldn’t all have been dreaming. Besides, while they\n\nwere yet doubting and deliberating, lo! the bell rung a second time. John\n\nand his wife shook in their shoes. That is merely a figure of speech; for,\n\nproperly speaking, they hadn’t even their stockings on. The marriageable\n\ndaughters would have fainted, but they had only read of fainting in books,\n\nand had no idea how it was done. It must be allowed matters were alarming\n\nenough. Who or what dreadful thing was thus urgently demanding an\n\ninterview at that untimely hour of night, in that lone house among the\n\npine-trees. The bell rang a third time; and, urged by the entreaties of\n\nhis wife to be brave for once and go--she did not say come--and see, John\n\nat last reached down his old brown Bess--it had been loaded for five\n\nyears--and with a candle in his other hand, his wife holding on by the\n\nskirts of his night-dress, and the marriageable daughters bringing up the\n\nrear, prepared to march upon the parlour.\n\nIn Indian file, and all in white, they might have been mistaken for a\n\nparty of priests going to celebrate midnight mass. No ghost could have\n\nwithstood the sight of that procession. It must have burst out laughing,\n\nunless, indeed, a very _grave_ ghost. When at last they reached the\n\nparlour, neither sight nor sound rewarded them for their heroism.\n\nEverything was in its usual place, and nothing was disturbed. A search all\n\nover the house proved too that the doors were all locked, the windows\n\nfastened, and no one either up the chimney or under the beds. So the\n\nmystery was put down to super-human agency, or, as the good wife termed\n\nit, “something no canny;” and they all went trembling back to bed, and lay\n\nawake in great fear till the cock crew.\n\nFor nearly a fortnight after this, almost every night, and sometimes even\n\nby day, the same strange disturbances occurred, and all efforts to solve\n\nthe mystery were fruitless. So it got rumoured abroad that the house was\n\nhaunted. All the usual remedies were had recourse to for the purpose of\n\nexorcism, but in vain. The parson came twice to pray in the room. He might\n\nas well have stopped at home. Equally unsuccessful were the services of an\n\nold lady, whom her enemies called a witch, her friends “the wisest woman\n\nin the parish.” Things began to look serious. The goodwife was getting\n\nthin, her daughters hysterical, and John himself began to lose caste among\n\nthe neighbours. It was openly hinted, that some deed of blood must have\n\nbeen committed by him, in that same house and room. Nor could his thirty\n\nyears of married life and unblemished reputation save him. He had been\n\n_too_ quiet, people said, and _too_ regular in his attendance at church;\n\nbesides, he had a down look about him, and, on the whole, hanging was too\n\ngood for him. Some averred that strange sights and sounds were seen and\n\nheard by people who had occasion to pass that house at night, among other\n\nthings a light gliding about in the copse-wood. No, they would not believe\n\nit was only John locking up the stable; and the devil himself, in the\n\nshape of a fox, was seen at early morning coming directly from the house.\n\nOf course the devil had a fine fat hen over his shoulders, but that had\n\nnothing to do with the matter. Poor John! it had come to this, that he had\n\nserious thoughts of giving up his farm and going to America, when a\n\nrollicking young student in the neighbourhood, who did not believe in\n\nspirits--except ardent--proposed to the farmer that they should “wake the\n\nghost.”\n\n“Wake the ghost!” said the farmer, “ye little ken, lad. He’s wide enough\n\nawake already.”\n\n“Wake him,” repeated the student; “sit up at night, you know, and wait\n\ntill he comes.”\n\nJohn turned pale.\n\n“I’ll sit with you,” continued the young man. “If he’s a civil ghost, we\n\ncan hear what he has got to say; for\n\n‘The darkest nicht I fear nae deil,\n\nWarlock, nor witch in Gowrie.’”\n\nVery reluctantly John consented; but he did consent; and that night the\n\ntwo met in the haunted chamber alone, just before the old clock on the\n\nstair told the hour of midnight.\n\n“What have you got under your arm?” inquired the student.\n\n“The ha’ Bible,” replied John, in a sepulchral voice; “is that a Bible\n\nyou’ve brought?”\n\n“No, it’s whisky,” said the student, “about the only spirit you are likely\n\nto see to-night; and there won’t be the ghost of that left by cock-crow.”\n\nSo they waited and watched, John reading, the student smoking steadily and\n\ndrinking periodically. One o’clock came, and two o’clock, and the candle\n\nwas burning low in the socket, when suddenly, “Hist!” said the student,\n\nand “Hush!” said John. They could distinctly hear footsteps about them in\n\nthe room, but no one visible. They were really frightened now. Then\n\nsomething rushed past them, and the bell rang, and there, lo, and behold!\n\nfrom the rope dangled John’s decent tabby cat.\n\n“And the Lord’s name be praised,” said John piously, closing the book.\n\n“Such ghosts as these,” said the student, “are best exorcised with a\n\nbroom-handle; but, see! this explains.” He held up the rope, to the end of\n\nwhich--country fashion--was attached _a hare’s foot_!\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n[_See Note C, Addenda._]\n\nPUSSY’S LOVE OF CHILDREN.\n\nThe cat is more than any other creature the pet of our early years. Almost\n\nthe first animal we notice, when we are old enough to notice anything, is\n\npussy, with her beautiful markings, her well-pleased, homely face, sleek\n\nand shining fur, and soft paws, which she never ungloves in the presence\n\nof childhood. Children and cats, especially young ones, have so very much\n\nin common. Both are innocent, sinless, and easily pleased, and both are\n\nfull of fun and frolic. Children will often play with a kitten until they\n\nkill the poor thing. In the country, pussy’s place may easily be supplied\n\nby some other toy; but to a poor little gutter-child the loss is simply\n\nirreparable, and she will nurse her dead kitten in the mud for a week. The\n\nway children use poor patient pussy is at times anything but commendable;\n\nand while deprecating the conduct of parents in allowing them to treat\n\nthe cat so, we cannot but admire pussy’s extreme forbearance and\n\nuncomplaining good nature, under what must be considered very trying\n\ncircumstances. It is nothing to see Miss Puss or Master Tom dressed up in\n\na shawl and neatly fitting cap, and lugged about as a doll, carried by the\n\ntail over the child’s shoulder, or worn as a comforter round his neck. Yet\n\npussy seems to know that there is no harm meant, and that the children\n\nreally love her dearly; so she never attempts to scratch, far less to\n\nbite. All experience goes to prove, too, that it is generally the child\n\nthat uses her the worst, to whom pussy is most attached.\n\nThe ‘dead playmate’ is a picture you will often see in real life. I saw\n\none not a month ago. A pretty little child, with round, wondering eyes,\n\nswollen with recent tears, sitting in the corner of a field in the summer\n\nsunshine. On her lap lay--among a handful of daisies and corn-poppies--a\n\nwee dead kitten: life had but lately left it. When I spoke to her, her\n\ngrief burst out afresh.\n\n“O sir, my pussy’s deadëd, my pretty pussy’s deadëd!”\n\nThere would be no more games of romps in the garden, no more scampering\n\ntogether through the green fields after the butterfly, no more making\n\npussy a doll. She would go lonely to bed to-night and cry herself asleep,\n\nfor pretty pussy was “deadëd.”\n\nIn the adjacent street to where I now live, is a fine large red-tabby Tom.\n\nHe is a famous mouser, a noted hunter, and a gentleman every inch. He was\n\nfaithful in love and dauntless in war. When I tried to stroke him, he gave\n\nme a look and a growl of such unmistakable meaning, that I mechanically\n\nput my hands in my pockets and whistled. He makes no friends with\n\nstrangers. Yet Tom has a little mistress, not much over three years old,\n\nwhom he dearly loves, and from whom he is seldom absent. He lies down on\n\nhis side, and allows little Alice to lift him, although she can hardly\n\ntotter along with her burden, which she carries as often by the tail as\n\nany way else. She sleeps beside him on the hearth-rug, Tom winding his\n\narms lovingly around her neck, and little Alice declares that pussy\n\n“carries his kisses on his nose.”\n\nWee Elsie S----, though only six years old, has completely tamed--as far\n\nas she herself is concerned--what might almost be called a wild cat, it\n\nhaving been bred and brought up in the woods. This cat has only two good\n\nqualities, namely, his great skill in vermin-killing, and his fondness for\n\nlittle Elsie. Neither the child’s father, mother, nor the servants, dare\n\nput a finger on this wild brindled Tom; but as soon as Elsie comes down in\n\nthe morning, and puss is let in, with a fond cry he rushes towards her,\n\nsinging and caressing her with evident satisfaction. He then does duty as\n\na doll all day, or follows the child wherever she goes, and sleeps with\n\nher when she sleeps.\n\n“In our nursery,” writes a lady correspondent, “there was always a cat,\n\nwhich was the favourite companion of the children, submitting to many\n\nindignities which a dog would scarcely have endured with so much patience.\n\nOne handsome tabby cat, named by us children Roland the Brave, used to\n\nhold his place in front of the nursery fire, with the utmost patience and\n\ngood-humour, in spite of kettles boiling over on him, nursery-maids\n\ntreading on his paws and tail, and children teasing him in every possible\n\nway.”\n\n“The tom-cat which I have at present,” says another, “keeps my children\n\ncompany in their walks, and is indeed more careful of them than the maid,\n\nwho sometimes has forgotten her duty so far as to leave the perambulator\n\nto look after itself, while she is talking and laughing with a tall man in\n\nred. But Tom is not so thoughtless, and sticks close by the children,\n\nshowing signs of anger when any one approaches. He seems, moreover, imbued\n\nwith the idea, that the every-day food of that domestic quadruped, the\n\ndog, is babies, and, if any one is foolish enough to come snuffing round\n\nthe perambulator, Tom mounts him at once, and proceeds forthwith to\n\nsharpen his claws in his hide. On one occasion when my family were absent\n\nfor a few days, Tom was so disconsolate that he refused to take his food.\n\nTo show his love for the children, I made the remark to Tom, in presence\n\nof some friends, that baby was in the cradle; the cat jumped up and went\n\ndirectly towards it, and examined it, then returned mewing most mournfully\n\nbecause of the disappointment.”\n\nPussy’s love for babies is always very noticeable. In fact, with very\n\nlittle training, she may be taught, if not to nurse, at least to mind, the\n\nbaby. I know a cat which, as soon as the child is placed in its little\n\ncot, lays itself gently down at its back; and this is not for sake of\n\nwarmth and comfort, as some may allege, but from pure love of baby. For\n\npussy lies perfectly still as long as the child sleeps; but whenever she\n\nawakes, even before she cries, the cat jumps down and runs to tell her\n\nmistress, runs back to the cradle, and, with her forefeet on the edge,\n\nlooks alternately at baby and its mother, mewing entreatingly until the\n\nchild is lifted. Contented now, it throws itself at the mother’s feet, and\n\ngoes quietly off to sleep. Another cat I know of, that goes regularly to\n\nthe harvest-field, with its mistress and a young child. The cat remains\n\nwith the child all day, guarding him and amusing him by playing at\n\nhide-and-seek with him, until evening, when the mother, who has only\n\nvisited her child two or three times during the day, returns, generally to\n\nfind baby and puss asleep in each other’s arms.\n\nCats too not only mourn the absence of their little master or mistress,\n\nbut will try to follow them if they can.\n\n“A certain party of my acquaintance,” says a lady, “had a large cat called\n\nTabby, who was a great favourite with all the family. Tabby seemed to\n\nreciprocate the attachment of the different members, but its fondness for\n\nthe youngest daughter was something wonderful. It would follow her about\n\nwherever she went, and if she ever left home for a short time, poor pussy\n\nseemed quite wretched until her return. At one time the child went to\n\nreside for two months, with some friends many miles distant. You may fancy\n\nher surprise and delight when one morning, after she had been about a\n\nweek in her new residence, in marches her dear friend and companion\n\nMistress Tabby, and nothing could induce her to leave again. Pussy took up\n\nher abode with the girl, stuck by her all the time, and at the end of the\n\nvisit faithfully accompanied her back to their home.”\n\nA woman, whom I know, has a tom-cat, which watches constantly by the\n\nbaby’s cradle, when its mistress is absent. One day, when hanging up some\n\nclothes in the garden, she became suddenly aware of an awful row going on\n\nin the room she had just left. She entered, just in time to see Tom riding\n\na large shepherd’s collie round the room, and back again, and finally out\n\nat the door. Tom was a most cruel jockey, sparing neither bit(e) nor spur,\n\nas the howls of the unhappy collie fully testified. That dog hasn’t been\n\nseen in the immediate vicinity since.\n\nThe cat, mentioned in the following anecdote, was surely worthy of the\n\nHumane Society’s bronze medallion, as much as any Newfoundland ever was.\n\nA certain lady’s little son was ill of scarlet fever. The period of\n\ninflammation and danger was just over, but the poor child was unable to\n\nsit or stand. Through all his illness, he had been carefully watched by a\n\nfaithful tom-cat, who seldom ever left his bedside by night or by day; for\n\nTom dearly loved the little fellow, who, though now so still and quiet,\n\nused to lark and roll with him on the parlour floor. But since his little\n\nmaster’s illness, Tom had never been known to make the slightest attempt\n\nat fun. One day, the child was taken by its mother from bed, and laid on\n\nthe cool sofa by way of change; and when he had fallen asleep she gently\n\nleft the room, Tom being on guard as usual. She had not been gone many\n\nminutes, and was engaged in some household duties, when Tom entered,\n\nsquirrel-tailed and mewing most piteously, looking up into her face, and\n\nthen running to the door, plainly entreating his mistress to hurry along\n\nwith him. It was well she did so. Poor Tom ran before her to the room in\n\nwhich she had left her boy, when she found that, in attempting to get up,\n\nthe child had fallen on the floor along with the rugs in such a position,\n\nthat death from suffocation would have inevitably followed, but for the\n\ntimely aid summoned by this noble tom-cat.\n\nI think I have said enough to prove how fond pussy is of children, and how\n\nforbearing towards them; and surely this trait in her character should\n\nendear her to us all. But I do thoroughly deprecate pussy’s being made a\n\nplaything of, whether she be cat or kitten. It is exceedingly cruel of\n\nparents to allow it, and is taking an unfair advantage of the cat’s\n\ngood-nature and sense. The way she is lugged about, and tormented by some\n\nchildren, is very prejudicial to her health and appearance. It often does\n\nher grievous bodily harm, injures her heart and lungs, and stops her\n\ngrowth, even if it does not induce paralysis and consequent death. Let\n\nyour children love pussy, pussy loves your children; only kindly point out\n\nto them the essential difference between a play_thing_ and a play_mate_.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n[_See Note D, Addenda._]\n\nPUSSY “POLL.”\n\nThe following sketch of cat-life is contributed by one who loves “all\n\nthings both great and small.” We give it _in extenso_.\n\nEven supposing it to be endowed with the nine lives ascribed to the race,\n\nwas it at all probable that I would be successful in rearing to mature\n\ncathood that dripping little wretch?\n\nSuch was the question, which not without doubt, I asked myself while\n\nattempting to dry a kitten, some two weeks old, which I had just saved\n\nfrom death in a neighbouring horsepond. Arrived at home, I put in practice\n\nas many of the Royal Humane Society’s rules for the treatment of the\n\napparently drowned, as I found applicable to the case in hand, and soon\n\nhad the satisfaction of seeing my charge, comfortably sleeping in a bed\n\nprepared in an old cap, by the fireside. Not less successful were my\n\nefforts at nursing, and in a few weeks, Poll, for so I named my pet, had\n\ngrown to be the daintiest thing possible; the very impersonation of\n\nmischief and fun, without thought or care, from morn till night, except\n\nthat of--\n\n“Turning to mirth all things of earth,\n\nAs only kittens can.”\n\nTime passed on, however, and with years, or rather months, came troubles,\n\none of the first causes of which to puss was a mirror. To her it was a\n\nmystery which cost many hours of deep thought and serious study; but never\n\ncould she understand why the cat which was always visible in front could\n\nneither be seen, felt, nor heard, behind the glass.\n\nNumerous experiments were made to solve the puzzle; but the most common\n\none was for Poll to seat herself in front of the mirror and critically\n\nexamine her _vis-à-vis_. The thing seeming so real, she next would give\n\nthe glass a pat with her paw, and run round to the back; but nothing being\n\nfound there, one paw was then put in front and the other kept behind. She\n\nwould then peep round into the glass, and still seeing puss there, would\n\nrenew her efforts to catch her. This was repeated almost daily for some\n\ntime; but at last puss seemed to have resolved that the mystery should\n\nremain one no longer, so struck at her opponent with full force, and of\n\ncourse seemed to receive a blow in return. In an instant Poll sprang to\n\nher feet and assumed a position of defiance; but her foe, nothing loath\n\nfor the fray, was equally ready. A moment’s pause, and puss hurled herself\n\non her foe. There was a crash. A cat rushed wildly out of the door, and I\n\nproceeded to gather fragments of a mirror from off the floor.\n\nAt meal-times, puss regularly seated herself on my shoulder, and waited\n\npatiently for what she considered her due proportion; but if I seemed to\n\nneglect her, she gently reminded me of her presence by patting my cheek\n\nwith her paw. If that was not sufficient, the paw was pressed on my cheek,\n\nthe claws slowly protruded, and my face drawn round towards her. Success\n\ninvariably attended this manœuvre; and after receiving her share, she\n\nthanked me by rubbing her head against my cheek, and licking my face.\n\nIn due course a young family of kittens appeared; but of course they all,\n\nsave one, met the fate from which I had saved their mother. With the\n\nfamily came family cares. Soon the kitten was old enough to begin to\n\nreceive its education, and then mice at any time, varied occasionally with\n\na rat or two were to be found lying about the floor. As the kitten got\n\nolder, and was able to be left for longer periods alone, Poll extended her\n\nhunting excursions: one morning she brought home four or five young\n\npartridges, and the following day one of the parent birds. The next great\n\nhunt produced as many young rabbits, and although to such games I had no\n\ngreat objection to offer; yet, when frogs, toads, or lizards were the\n\nproduce of a day’s sport, as was sometimes the case, I did protest.\n\nOn one occasion, while the kitten was playing out of doors, it was pursued\n\nby a dog belonging to a neighbour, but escaped through a hole in a wall\n\nclose by. Poll, who at some distance had seen the whole affair, at once\n\ndarted to her kitten’s side, and did her best to quiet its fears, telling\n\nit, doubtless, that she would take an early opportunity of teaching that\n\ndog better manners. The opportunity was not long wanting. Next day the dog\n\nagain passing, was noticed by puss, who ran and hid behind a corner, near\n\nwhich he would come, and there waited his approach. Just as he turned she\n\nsprung on his head, and with teeth and claws took hold so firm that he in\n\nvain endeavoured to shake her off. Going to his assistance, I with\n\nconsiderable difficulty disengaged puss, but not before his head was badly\n\ntorn.\n\nBut although thus ready to do battle when occasion required, puss knew\n\nalso how to evade a foe when so inclined.\n\nAlways treating the game-laws with that respect of which they are worthy,\n\npuss was of course never disturbed in her rambles by gamekeepers; and so\n\n’twas quite an accident when, being in the middle of a field, she was\n\nchased by a dog belonging to one. Possibly on that particular morning she\n\nmay have remembered that “discretion is the better part of valour;” and\n\nso, when she saw the dog coming, she made for the cliffs, by which on one\n\nside the field was bounded. But the dog was swift, and ere half the\n\ndistance was passed he was upon her. Just, however, as he was about to\n\nseize her, she sprang on one side and stopped, the dog rushing forward\n\nsome half dozen yards. While he was stopping and turning, she darted past,\n\nand thus continued to elude him till the cliffs were reached.\n\nWhile Poll and I were taking a walk one evening, a curious incident\n\noccurred. A rook flying overhead seemed struck with some peculiarity about\n\npuss; for suddenly checking himself in his flight, he circled once or\n\ntwice round us both, and apparently satisfied with the survey, darted away\n\nto the opposite side of the field, where a large flock of rooks were\n\nfeeding. He took not time to alight, but gave several peculiar caws, in a\n\ntone which seemed to me expressive of great excitement. What his\n\ncommunication was, I know not; but it seemed perfectly intelligible to the\n\nother rooks, which instantly took wing, and, following him as their\n\nleader, bore down on puss, who by this time had mounted on the top of a\n\nfence, and was quietly taking a survey of the surrounding scenery. At\n\nfirst I expected to see them attempt to carry her off bodily; but if such\n\nwas their intention, none of them had sufficient courage to begin the\n\nattack. Sometimes, indeed, one bolder than the rest would make a near\n\napproach; but, as on these occasions puss endeavoured to make a capture,\n\nthey preferred keeping at a safe distance. For fully five minutes they\n\nthus continued to circle around, filling the air with a perfect Babel of\n\nsound, and then, as suddenly departed as they had come.\n\nThis was almost the last adventure of note which we two had together.\n\nShortly after, having to remove to a distant part of the country, where I\n\ncould not take my darling with me, it became necessary either to leave her\n\nwith some acquaintance or destroy her. With increasing years, her temper,\n\nnever good towards strangers, did not improve, and being afraid that if I\n\nleft her behind me she might be subjected to bad treatment, I determined\n\nto adopt the course which seemed the lesser of two evils. On the day of my\n\ndeparture, we paid a last visit to the ocean.\n\n“A splash, a plunge, and all was o’er,--\n\nThe billows rolled on as they rolled before;”\n\nand puss, my most pleasant companion and faithful friend, had met the fate\n\nfrom which I saved her so many years before. “_Sic est vita._”\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n[_See Note E, Addenda._]\n\nSAGACITY OF CATS.\n\nFew people now-a-days think of denying, that man’s noble friend the dog\n\npossesses a large amount, of what can only be termed reason. I myself\n\nbelieve, that almost every animal does; but in these pages I shall only\n\nclaim the gift for our mutual friend, the domestic cat. Reason, I\n\nconsider, is quite different from mere instinct. Instinct is born in an\n\nanimal; reason is that instinct matured by experience.\n\nI hardly think that you can find a more sagacious animal than the cat. I\n\ndoubt, indeed, if the dog is; for pussy’s peculiar mode of existence, the\n\nmany enemies she has to encounter, and the struggle she often has to"
