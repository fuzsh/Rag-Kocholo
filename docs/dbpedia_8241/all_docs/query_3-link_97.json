        "text": "They dominated the game from the start and were full value for their win against a side who have been leaking goals.\n\nThe breakthrough came on 35 minutes when defender Domaine Rouse completely missed Liam Brockbank’s cross and Dav Symington collected to shoot home.\n\nOn 43 minutes another mistake by Rouse gave Allison the ball. He was 40 yards out but held off the pursuers before lifting a superb finish over keeper Elliott Wynne.\n\nIt was normal service again on the resumption as Reds continued to dominate.\n\nA Symington free-kick was turned onto the bar and over by Wynne. But from the corner a half clearance was driven home by Jordan Little.\n\nReds used three substitutes in the first 20 minutes, including new striker Mwiya Malumo.\n\nOn 71 minutes Malumo marked his debut with a goal, firing home after good work by Millenic Alli and Brockbank.\n\nThe 19-year-old Zambian striker has been training with the Reds and the management team have liked the look of him.\n\nHe was announced as a new signing before the game.\n\n“We saw videos of him in action and thought it was worth taking a look,\" Grainger said.\n\n\"He’s done well in training so we are happy to put him in.\"\n\nMalomo had been with Wigan and after being released spent time playing in Sweden.\n\nThis season he has been playing for Irlam Town in the North West Counties Premier Division."
