A letter from Philippopolis states that emissaries from Sofia are traversing Macedonia in all directions prodaiming to the ignorant Bulgarian peasants that the empire of Alexander the Great is to re stored. To assist in this work committees are formed in the towns and villages, and the country people are partly persuaded, partly driven, to contribute funds, of which one half wanders into the pocket of the Bulgarian, bishop, whose office it is to' appease the authorities and ward off suspicion, while the other half is despatched to the President of the Central Bulgarian Committee in Sofia.

The demand -was bnly moderate, the hardening tendency\" being' duo rather io a reluctance t6 much nt the current figure than to anv' increase in the supply of bills.

The liicestcr correspondent of tho Times, writing on Wednesday, says-. it is impossible to estimate with anything like accuracy the exact amount of damage to the Midland Railway by tho recent floods, it must amount to many thousand pounds. In the neighbourhood of Ia9ice5ter largo gangs of men havo\" been employed for about a week night and day in restoring the line and in constiucting temporary viaducts to' carry the lines over the three large gaps caused by the floods carrying away the old structures. To-day a lnrgi gang of pUe-drivers, bridge-builders, and other workmen weio engaged at Thurmaston reconstructing a viaduct 48tt .\n\nlong, which had been swept away. Although this was the smallest gap of the has proved the most difficult to bridge over. Tho engineers found that the flood bad mads a channel under tlie viaduct 10ft. deep, and into this vast masses of brickwork were embedded. The engineers, however, overcame the difficulties to-day, and succeeded In driving the last of tho piles .\n\nBefore this was accomplished masses of brickwork weighing three tons were removed from the channel, still filled with Water, into which tho flood has converted the roadway. On either side of tbe viaduct there are still oyer ten acres of fields -under water, and in ono of the fields is' a solid mass of brickwork, which tho engineers estimate to' weigh two tons and a half, proving how enormous must havo been the pressure of the water. The fact that the brickwork has held together in large masses is also proof that tho -viaduct was constructed of thoroughly good materials. It has been 'ascertained drmnitely that the suddon collapse of the structure was duo to all the earth being washed away and the foundations being undermined. Now tliat the piles have been successfully driven, it is anticipated that traffic which has up to now been conducted on the goods liocs, will bo resumed on; the .\n\npassenger routes tomorrow, or exactly a week of tarr'tiio carrying away of the structure by' the floods. The temporary structures ail very strong, and they will be replaced by poimacetit ones as onportonity offera,\" it' v. -nHsKB GROCERY and PROVISION SHOP: 3trreH the prlcler-a.

But vhetucr under tho influence of this circumstance or net-, there has been considerably more inquiry in the wool market and rather more business has done in some classes of wool, with an evident tendency to greater firmness in prices. Some staplers, finding that large dealers in tho country have assumed a firmer attitude, are seeking to establish an improvement in prices, though from the limited business aone in too aggregate it can hardly said that tiioy nave imiy succeeded, Any downward tendency is certainly arrested, and a slight advance has in some cases been realised Little, if any, attention can.be reported in the yarn market .\n\nThe tone is more hortef nl and'thero is more inauiry. hut the business doing is still very restricted.
