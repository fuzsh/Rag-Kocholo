        "text": "Looking for one of the best walks in South Manchester? Look no further…\n\nScenic views and wildlife might not be the first things that spring to mind when you think of Stretford, but that’s what makes this scenic spot just off the M60 so special.\n\nWhile much of Stretford’s agricultural history has been lost to urban progression, this place is very much still teeming with wildlife. In the 19th century, Stretford was a hub for agriculture—known locally as Porkhampton due to the of pig farms which provided produce for the nearby Manchester Market. Wild, eh?\n\nBack then, Streford was also an extensive market gardening area, described as the \"garden of Lancashire\" by writers of the time. In 1845, over 508 tons of vegetables were being produced each week for the Manchester Market, with their specialty being rhubarb—known locally then as “Streford beef”.\n\nSo successful was Stretford’s vegetable output, it became known as “ the Eden of Lancashire” throughout the Victorian era. In 1845, over 508 tons of vegetables were reported to be produced by Stretford market gardens for Manchester residents.\n\nFor those looking to make a proper day of it, you can extend the route by heading to Old Ees Brook in Urmston, or by meeting up with one of the route’s many traffic-free transport links, including the Trans Pennine Trail or the Bridgewater Canal."
