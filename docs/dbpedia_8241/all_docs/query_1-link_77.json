The former standing terrace was demolished in 1992 and was replaced by a cantilever, seated stand. This photograph was taken in Colley Street, to the south of the stadium.\n\nContent\n\nThis is part of the Series: PLA01/04 Played in Manchester; within the Collection: PLA01 Played in Britain Collection"
