        "text": "TASTING NOTES\n\nThe Rouge Cerise boasts notes of ripe cherry fruit and hints of black pepper on the nose. On the palate, the tannins are smooth, well-balanced.\n\nVINEYARDS\n\nThe Rouse Cerise is made 100% from Syrah. The vines are planted on soils of loam and limestone, situated near the village of Montagnac which is near to the Mediterranean Sea. The proximity of the zone to the sea means cool maritime breezes moderate the climate, allowing the grapes to ripen slowly and retain good levels of acidity, resulting in fresh and vibrant wines.\n\nVINIFICATION\n\nGrapes were hand-picked and sorted meticulously at the winery prior to crushing and pressing. At the winery, fermentation took place in open top fermenters for 18 days with optimum extraction of colour and tannins being achieved by daily punch downs of the cap. After alcoholic fermentation, 30% of the wine was transferred to oak barrels and the rest remained in strainless steel.\n\nPRODUCER\n\nOwned by brothers Yves and Hugues Ricome for over 30 years, Domaine La Croix Gratiot covers 27 hectares in Montagnac in the Coteaux du Languedoc. After years of selling to the local co-operative, Yves started bottling his own wine in 2005. His daughter Anaïs has now taken charge, after working for some time in New Zealand with Matt Thomson, and makes wonderfully pure wines that reflect the potential of the local varieties with which she works. The domaine has been practising biodynamic since 2016 and is currently in conversion. The first certified vintage will be in 2021."
