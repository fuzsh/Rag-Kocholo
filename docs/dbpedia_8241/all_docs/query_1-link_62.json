        "text": "While Terry Jacks was busy topping the charts with Seasons in the Sun, three municipal boroughs of Altrincham, Sale and Stretford were fused with the urban districts of Bowdon, Hale and Urmston and part of Bucklow Rural District, placing Trafford firmly on the map.\n\nIt was April 1st, 1974, making this year Trafford’s 50th birthday.\n\nAnd that can only mean one thing – it’s time to celebrate our wonderful borough!\n\nI have lived in Trafford my whole life.\n\nI went to school here, have brought up my two children here, and it’s where I began my political career.\n\nAnd it just so happens to be a special birthday for me this year too.\n\nIn my roles as Deputy Leader, and Executive Member for Leisure, Arts, Culture and Heritage, I will be working alongside council colleagues, residents, and partners to mark this special occasion.\n\nTrafford is known worldwide because of its amazing sporting arenas and its strong historical and cultural background.\n\nIt is a place with unique heritage, the Barton Swing Aqueduct which is the first and only one in the world, while Trafford Park was also the first planned industrial estate, and the largest in Europe. And Trafford General, which opened its doors to the public in 1947, is known globally as the birthplace of NHS.\n\nToday, Trafford continues to lead the way in media, the arts, sport, and animation. It’s home to the Imperial War Museum, Sale Waterside and the Robert Bolt Theatre and the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse, and not forgetting the wonderful Trafford Centre. And we have fabulous town centres and exciting developments happening in Stretford and Altrincham.\n\nThe main birthday celebrations will take place during this year’s Trafford LIVE on Sunday 7th July, from 11am to 2pm, at the town hall and Emirates Old Trafford. However, there will be further announcements in the runup to the special day.\n\nBut it’s not just Trafford’s birthday we’re celebrating! This year’s International Women’s Day will take place on Friday 8th March. And Waterside in Sale and Creative Industries Trafford have announced a series of events and exhibitions to mark the occasion.\n\nThe exciting lineup includes two photographic exhibitions, an evening of theatre in development, a musical performance showcasing pioneering women, as well as talks and workshops – all led, created or inspired by female-identifying artists.\n\nI would encourage everyone to visit.\n\nI will be joining my colleague, Cllr Joanne Harding, on Saturday 9th March, at Flixton Girls School from 6pm to 9pm, for Trafford’s fourth International Women’s Day awards.\n\nThis is a fantastic event that celebrates and honours the incredible work and achievements of Trafford women.\n\nI’m really looking forward to meeting everyone and celebrating your amazing success.\n\nAnd finally, I recently attended the Trafford Women’s Voices Workshop, hosted by the Trafford Local Care Organisation (TLCO), the team do really fantastic work within communities.\n\nThis event provided a platform for amplifying the voices of women, ensuring their perspectives shape local action. It also showcased examples and effective strategies for enhancing women’s health and wellbeing not only in Trafford but across Greater Manchester.\n\nThank you for the excellent work you do.\n\nI’ll sign off now, have a lovely weekend.\n\nCath."
