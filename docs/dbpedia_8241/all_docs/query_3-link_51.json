        "text": "BetVictor North West: Droylsden 2-0 Trafford\n\nTwo goals in the last ten minutes from skipper Domaine Rouse saw the Bloods claim all three points in this Boxing Day Derby.\n\nRouse was at the far post to poke home Jack Kay’s cross with ten minutes left and was gifted a second eight minutes later when Trafford keeper Matthew Cooper let Rouse’s shot roll under his body.\n\nIt was a battling performance from Droylsden who were on the back foot for much of the game against a Trafford side pushing for the playoffs.\n\nKeeper Chris Thompson was called into action several times in the first half, saving well early on from Darius Palma and from Salmon who got behind Adam Rooney playing as an emergency full back to force the keeper into a block at his near post.\n\nIn between, Colin Murray should really have done better from Kay’s cross after the striker broke down the right but with time on his hands his shot went wide of the far post.\n\nThe visitors dominated much of the possession for the rest of the half, Johnson’s free kick flying just wide of the post while the same player forced Thompson into a spectacular one handed save low down to his far post just before the break.\n\nThe second half evened out in the wet conditions, neither side really dominating. Droylsden brought on Harry Canon Noren for his debut along with Jamie Frost and Noren had an ambitious attempt soon after coming on, breaking down the right hand side before skying his attempt.\n\nIt began to look like the odd goal would pinch the tie and Rouse obliged on 80 minutes after the hard working Kay’s cross found him at the far post.\n\nTrafford weren’t finished though, a double save from Thompson preventing an equaliser before Rouse secured the points at the other end."
