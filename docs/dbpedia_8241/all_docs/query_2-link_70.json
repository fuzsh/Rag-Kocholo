        "text": "This article describes the birth of one of Britain's most successful regional magazines, Cheshire Life, in 1934, in the context of the economic and social changes of the times, analysing it as a media product and historical source. Cheshire Life is part of a publishing genre-the county and regional magazine-which includes some sixty-five titles across England, with a monthly readership in the millions. This significant readership alone makes it worthy of academic study. But magazines like Cheshire Life can tell us about county identities and their history, attitudes to the countryside, the relationship between social class and sense of place, the changing role of the country house, countryside and nature writing and publishing, landscape photography and the broader regional media ecology. The magazine began as the mouthpiece for an economic development council during the Depression, but came under new ownership in 1935, leading to rapid and significant changes in its content and fortunes. The new publisher, Christopher Nicholls, had a huge influence on Cheshire Life and on county magazines as a genre, setting a template which is still in use today. Nicholls successfully created an advertising vehicle which grew fat on the 1930s' consumer advertising boom, filled with photographs and other editorial benefiting from the cachet of the county set. The decline of the gentry as political and economic leaders can be seen in the magazine, but their social world of 'county society' lived on, eagerly adopted by a segment of the rising middle class.\n\nAlong the valley … of the Dee and their mountain tributaries, where they begin to open towards the English plain, mottes and ringworks succeed one another like beads on a string. There was no overall plan of defence …. They served only for local protection against an enemy who came by stealth and at night to forage and to loot … (Pounds 1990, 70) This article examines the medieval castles of Cheshire, in North-West England, and argues that there was far more continuity in conceptions of power, place, and land tenure across the eleventh and twelfth centuries than has been previously recognized. New interpretations of existing evidence are presented, indicating that the medieval castles in the western areas of the county were strategically sited and maintained throughout the Anglo-Norman period. Probably because the River Dee largely formed the western boundary of the entire frontier county from the end of the thirteenth century (Harris 1984, 1), Anglo-Norman castles located to the west of the River Dee in medieval west Cheshire have tended to be researched separately from their counterparts to the east of the River Dee. This has had the overall effect of both diminishing the value of this important northern section of the Anglo-Welsh border — what is here termed the Irish Sea Cultural Zone — and ignoring the significant research and interpretation potential of the castles and their landscapes, in terms of their individual and group significance within medieval Cheshire. As such, the concept of the Irish Sea Cultural Zone, and its nature and extent, is proposed in this article for the first time. The evidence relating to the siting and form of the zone’s castles is analysed through a landscape history and archaeological study, which spans many disciplinary boundaries. Discussion will highlight that continuity of form from prehistoric, Roman, or Anglo-Saxon monuments to Anglo-Norman castles reflected the continuity of purpose in control over communications, as well as reflecting the continuing significance of military and social influences on the siting of the castles in west Cheshire.\n\nHistoric Maps The townships of Branxton and Crookham (the latter incorporating Pallinsburn) are relatively well-covered by historic maps, with a number dating back to the mid to late 18th century. Crookham was surveyed and mapped in the 1760s (Northumberland Record Office ZMD 85, 2DE/15/1-2), whilst Branxton was covered by a series of maps produced c. 1780 (NRO 740 P98/1-2, 2DE 17/01), when the common waste of the township was finally enclosed. Altogether these include detailed maps of the two villages showing their layout before the common green was enclosed in each case. The Crookham maps also include the eastern end of the township next to the River Till, and the southern tongue extending towards Flodden Hill as well as the western and northwestern parts of neighbouring Heatherslaw township, almost all of which are now included in Crookham Civil Parish. Civil Parishes replaced townships as the smallest unit of local government and administration in the late 19th century. Initially their boundaries were usually the same as their predecessors, at least in rural areas, but over time these have been subject to alteration, with Heatherslaw effectively having been suppressed and its territory being divided amongst the neighbouring civil parishes, and Crookham having absorbed the northwestern quarter. However it is clear that the pattern of post-medieval landownership had already anticipated this change to a substantial degree. In the case of Branxton, as well as the village and its immediate environs, the 1780 enclosure map (NRO: 2 DE 17/01) shows a strip of common land extending along the eastern edge of the township right down to its southeast corner. Some parts of this strip were ultimately assigned to the two neighbouring townships of Crookham and Heatherslaw & Flodden, as is made clear by the map surveyed in 1837 showing all the townships of Ford Parish in outline, and it is likely that the inhabitants of these townships all had intercommoning rights on parts of Branxton Moor dating back to the Middle Ages which were recognised by this allocation. A second corridor of common land, extending directly southward from the centre of Branxton village towards the moor, figures on another of the plans associated with the inclosure award (NRO: 740, P98, plan 2) showing how a broad corridor was reduced to a narrow road, doubtless hedged on either side. There are certain parts of both townships, however, that do not feature on detailed maps before the appearance of the respective tithe maps for the two townships, which were surveyed in Part of the 1842 Branxton Tithe plan-NRO: DT 66S"
