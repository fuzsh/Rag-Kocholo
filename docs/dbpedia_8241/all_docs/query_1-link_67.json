        "text": "News\n\nEat Well Manchester is launching a special fundraising festival for those in need this autumn Danny Jones\n\nFood charity Eat Well Manchester, which helps support the region’s most vulnerable all year round, is teaming up with local hospitality venues for a crucial fundraising festival this autumn.\n\nAs another season of sun-soaked summer dining nears its end, we’re once again reminded of those less fortunate and the struggles that countless people all over the city and beyond face, especially as the colder months start to creep back in quicker than any of us would like.\n\nThat’s where important non-profits like Eat Well MCR come in, helping dish out free, nutritious and varied meals to Greater Manchester’s homeless community and anyone in need with the help of some of your very favourite restaurants.\n\nWith that in mind, as autumn fast approaches, the organisation has set up the fittingly named ‘Eat Well, Do Good’ festival, which will help raise vital funds and provide thousands of free meals to those who need them most.\n\nEat Well MCR works to tackle the growing crisis by delivering roughly 2,500 meals per month to\n\nindividuals facing economic deprivation. By supporting the charity, venues and patrons can\n\npositively impact the community more than they know.\n\nWith just £2, a meal can be provided for someone in need, and the collective efforts during this week-long festival have the potential to raise funds to not only unite local businesses but also show people sidelined by poverty in our community that Manchester cares like we know it does.\n\nTeaming up with the likes of Ramona, Maray, 10 Tib Lane; Chorlton Cheesemongers, chef Caroline Martins, and many more soon-to-be-announced partners, the festival will feature a wide variety of activities and events all across 0161.\n\nEat Well MCR are also obviously encouraging as many hospitality venues as they can to get involved with this important charity initiative throughout the season; food and drink spots can participate in whichever way they find the most suitable – the most important thing is doing your bit.\n\nThis aim is not only to bring the Manc hospitality sector close together and help battle its own struggles, but help deliver meals, source ingredients and raise awareness and funds to support underprivileged communities on our doorstep, all with the help of volunteers and kind-hearted people in the industry.\n\nRead more:\n\nA brand new gym in Manchester city centre is offering free yoga and HIIT classes this August\n\nMorrisons is giving away 100,000 Warburtons crumpets for FREE this summer\n\nFour best mates from Stockport are taking on the Loch Ness 24 challenge for charity\n\nWill Taplin, Executive Chef for Ramona, Firehouse and Diecast, said of the event: “We’re really excited to be part of this fundraising campaign. We’ll have extra special slices at Ramona and full pie at Diecast on sale throughout October, with a built-in donation from every pizza sold going to Eat Well MCR.”\n\nOther hospitality vendors can get involved by offering a special dish or drink where a\n\na portion of the proceeds are donated to Eat Well MCR, hosting their own fundraising activities or ticketed events, or by simply adding a £1 donation to every bill.\n\nFor instance, there will also be a party featuring DJs and more held at Ramona on 27 October to conclude the week of fundraising, where all proceeds from the evening will be donated to Eat Well MCR.\n\nWith stats like £1,000 worth of frozen food alone being thrown away by Mancs every year and that there are more than 7,000 homeless children across the 10 boroughs, it’s time to stand up and make a difference. Those interested can sign up via the Eat Well, Do Good Week sign-up page HERE.\n\nFor all the latest news, events and goings on in Greater Manchester, subscribe to The Manc newsletter HERE.\n\nFeatured Images — The Manc Eats/Eat Well MCR/gwafuvegan (via Instagram)\n\nNews\n\nFamily of man who died after falling from fourth-floor balcony in Salford pay tribute Daisy Jackson\n\nA touching tribute has been paid to the man who died after falling from a fourth-floor balcony in Salford.\n\nThe man, who has now been named as William Waheed Lyall, has been described as a ‘loving, strong, resilient’ man by his family.\n\nThe 57-year-old passed away on Sunday after he fell from an apartment at Black Friar Court in Salford.\n\nThree people were arrested on suspicion of murder and have since been bailed.\n\nGreater Manchester Police are still investigation the circumstances of his death.\n\nA spokesperson for William’s family said: “It is with immense sadness and shock that the family of William Waheed Lyall have learnt of his unexpected death.\n\n“William was loving, strong, resilient and worked tirelessly to provide for his family, not seeking recognition but wanting to see them happy. His children meant the world to him and he taught them that true strength comes from selflessness.\n\n“As a brother, he was fun to be with and was always a shoulder to lean on. We will miss his kindness, generous heart and his contagious hearty laughter.\n\n“William may no longer be with us but his spirit, his values and his love will forever guide us. William leaves behind three children Aadel, Ahel, Francesco and his wife Dida.\n\n“The family trusts that the police will leave no stone unturned to determine the details of this tragedy. We await the completion of the police investigation so that we can bury William at the Salford Muslim cemetery.\n\n“Rest in peace, dear William you will be forever missed but never forgotten.”\n\nOfficers are continuing to investigate and anyone with information is asked to contact police via 101 or gmp.police.uk, quoting log 3044 of 11/8/24.\n\nAlternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.\n\nRead more\n\nFour best mates from Stockport are taking on the Loch Ness 24 challenge on behalf of The Christie\n\nBudget airline Wizz Air launches UK’s first ‘unlimited’ flight subscription with 200 destinations\n\nMancs named among the top 10 ‘biggest complainers’ in the UK\n\nFeatured image: GMP"
