        "text": "Stretford residents are able to cast their vote for their favourite of the three names after voting officially opened on yesterday (Saturday, June 1) at the June Stretford Socials event.\n\nA polling station is located in the centre of Stretford Mall where the community will be able to vote using the token provided.\n\nAlternatively, Stretfordians can cast their vote on Stretford town centre’s social media poll from today (Sunday June 2).\n\nVoting will officially close on Sunday 16th June. The final three finalists are:\n\nHibberd Square - Named after Joan Hibberd, a beloved resident of Stretford since 1922. Hibberd is celebrated in the town for her active commitment to civic engagement, which has made a lasting impact on the Stretford community.\n\nLloyd Square - Inspired by Sir Anthony Joseph Lloyd, a dedicated public servant, who represented Stretford as an MP for many years. Sir Anthony was known for his commitment to social justice and community welfare, tirelessly advocating for the residents of Stretford and significantly contributing to the area’s development and well-being.\n\nEnriqueta Square - Dedicated to distinguished philanthropist and bibliophile, Enriqueta Rylands, who lived in Stretford and founded the famous John Rylands Library in Manchester city centre, named after her husband. Her dedication to preserving knowledge and promoting education has left a legacy in the world of literature and beyond.\n\nStretford town centre launched the initiative to name the square earlier in the year and invited the local community to name a brand new public square that is set to open in the heart of Stretford next year.\n\nConnecting the newly restored King Street and Pinnington Lane, the new public square will play a key part in the transformation of the area and will be a focal point for Stretford, featuring greenery and seating areas.\n\nJames Tootle, Head of Retail & Leisure, Bruntwood said: \"We want to say a huge thank you to everyone that submitted their entries to the Naming the Square initiative.\n\n\"It’s been a real honour to go through each and every one of them and read about the inspiring stories behind each entry.\n\n\"The town centre forum has carefully selected three names that embody the spirit of our local area, showcasing creativity, relevance, and a strong connection to the themes of heritage, community, and culture.\"\n\nCllr Liz Patel, Cabinet Member for Economy and Regeneration at Trafford Council added: \"The response we have had to this initiative demonstrates the strong sense of community that exists in Stretford, and how committed local people are to this regeneration project.\n\n\"The three finalists demonstrate the importance of history but also of individuals within a community in Stretford. Make sure you vote for your favourite – all three are worthy winners.”\n\nThe unveiling ceremony of the new name for the public square will take place in the centre of Stretford Mall at The StretFest on Saturday, July 6."
