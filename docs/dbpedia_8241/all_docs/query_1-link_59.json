        "text": "A forgotten \"ghost mall\" has been frozen in time since its heyday as one of the busiest places in Manchester.\n\nOriginally known as Stretford Arndale, the shopping centre opened in 1969 and soon found itself lacking investment and competing with the nearby Trafford Centre. A majority of stores soon left the Stretford Mall, which began resembling a 'dead' mall, where vacancy rates are high and foot traffic is low. Even after a redevelopment plan, a part of the mall which had no work done to it was discovered, leading one to describe the upper floor of the mall as 'frozen in time'.\n\nHayley Flynn, speaking to MEN, said: \"It was like staring through a tear in the fabric of time; it wasn’t altered, it wasn't hidden yet it wasn't paid attention to either. Totally isolated and hidden in plain sight.\" She further credited the 'quaint brick and net-curtained inn' found upstairs, as well as the 'magic' of the undeveloped upstairs area. \"I couldn't get an exact date on the last time this was open for business, but by the looks of things, it doesn’t look like the place was around to welcome in the '90s,\" she added.\n\nPhotographer Shirley Bainbridge has since captured the interior and showcased the now-demolished 'time capsule' within. The area has since been demolished and replaced with a new entrance, built over the course of 2017 to 2019. Eerie images now show the desolate halls which feature just a small handful of shop fronts, including a key cutters and café."
