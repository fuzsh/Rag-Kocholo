We hold a copy of one record concerning the landfill site at\n\nLesley Road (attached). The BGS has an incomplete set of records and only\n\nholds copies of landfill records for one year, 1973. Local authorities\n\nhold all original landfill records and they may have further records for\n\nthe landfill at this site. Historic landfill site data can also be freely\n\ndownloaded from\n\n[1]https://data.gov.uk/dataset/17edf94f-6de....\n\nThis may contain data on the Stretford Meadows site. Piping is usually\n\ninstalled to allow gases such as methane to escape from the landfill.\n\nI have also attached an excerpt from the fieldslip. Fieldslips are the\n\nworking documents that geologists make notes on while carrying out a\n\ngeological survey at a site and that are later used to create geological\n\nmaps. The BGS Terms and Conditions document attached applies to the\n\nlandfill record and the field slip.\n\nIn addition, I asked a geologist to look at the site and provide her own\n\nassessment. She explains that landfill sites often correspond with a hole\n\nin the ground, such as a former pit or quarry, but that doesn't appear to\n\nbe the case here. The landfill record states that the waste was placed\n\ndirectly onto alluvium and river terrace deposits, which would have been\n\nremoved if the site had been quarried. This is further supported by\n\nborehole evidence; one borehole from the site records 7.1m of 'loose dark\n\nbrown clay, cinder, brick, topsoil and rubbish fill' (characteristic of\n\nlandfill) underlain by 1m of 'soft to firm brown and grey silty very sandy\n\nclay with traces of peat' (characteristic of alluvium deposits).\n\nIf you would like to view the borehole records that we hold for the site\n\nyou can access them through the Geology of Britain viewer\n\n[2]http://mapapps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyofbritai.... Zoom into your\n\nsite, then click on the 'boreholes' button at the top of the page. The\n\ncoloured dots represent boreholes for which we hold records. When you\n\nclick on a coloured dot if there is a scan available for the record you\n\ncan click on the 'view scan' link to see it.\n\nLooking at Ordnance Survey historic maps that we have access to, dating\n\nfrom 1848 to 1951, there is no evidence of former workings on Stretford\n\nMeadows.\n\nThe BGS Geology 1:50,000 scale data shows artificial ground (man-made\n\nground) covering Stretford Meadows. It looks like the geologists who\n\nsurveyed the area couldn't agree on whether it had been worked or not; the\n\nnorthern half is mapped as infilled ground (areas where the ground has\n\nbeen cut away then wholly or partially backfilled) and the southern half\n\nis made ground (man-made deposits on the natural ground surface) with\n\nalluvium underneath. Based on the evidence we've looked at, the entire\n\nsite could be classed as made ground on the geological map, not half\n\ninfilled/half made ground as currently shown.\n\nThe NextMap digital ground elevation model that BGS has access to shows\n\nthat Stretford Meadows is of higher elevation than the surrounding area so\n\nit looks like the land level has been artificially raised.\n\nBGS do not hold information on radioactive waste disposal sites. The\n\ndisposal of low-level radioactive waste at non-nuclear licenced sites is\n\nthe remit of the Environment Agency (EA). As environment regulators, the\n\nEA enforce laws and regulation and authorise and control the disposal of\n\nradioactive waste into the air, water and land. See\n\n[3]https://www.gov.uk/topic/environmental-m...\n\nI hope this fully answers your questions. If you feel we have failed to\n\ncomply with your request in accordance with the requirements of the\n\nRegulations, you have the right to ask for an internal review (Regulation\n\n11). Internal review requests should be submitted in writing within 40\n\nworking days after the date on which you believe we failed to comply with\n\nthe requirements – normally the date of receipt of our response to your\n\nrequest. This should be addressed to The Complaints Officer at NERC,\n\nPolaris House, North Star Avenue, Swindon, Wilts SN2 1EU. There is no\n\ncharge for this review.\n\nPlease remember to quote the reference number above in any future\n\ncommunications.\n\nIf you are not content with the outcome of the internal review, you then\n\nhave the right to apply directly to the Information Commissioner for a\n\ndecision. The Information Commissioner can be contacted at the Information\n\nCommissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9\n\n5AF. Telephone: 08456 306060, or: 01625 545745.
