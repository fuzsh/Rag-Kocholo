        "text": "Leon Constantine had levelled an early Bury striker but Ryan Lowe scored twice as the Bulls faded after the interval.\n\nHereford made three changes, the most significant being the return of former Bury winger Marc Pugh after injury in place of Matt Done.\n\nKeith Lowe was given his United Football League debut in place of Darren Jones while Glen Southam returned to midfield with James McQuilkin dropping to the bench.\n\nAmong the opposition, there was a return to Edgar Street for popular goalkeeper Wayne Brown.\n\nHereford made a lively start and Brown had to save from Leon Constantine and Jonny Godsmark in quick succession.\n\nThen Pugh raced on to a superb through pass from Constantine, only for the winger to lose control at the vital moment as Brown came out to gather.\n\nBut despite Hereford’s early dominance, it was the visitors who took the lead on 10 minutes.\n\nDebutant Domaine Rouse was brought down on the edge of the area by Darren Dennehy and Michael Jones curled a free-kick around the wall and into the top corner.\n\nBut Hereford were level five minutes later with a well-worked goal.\n\nSoutham’s fine pass sent Ryan Green away on the right and his cross found Constantine, who controlled the ball before shooting home off a post.\n\nDavid Buchanan stole in and almost steered the ball past Bartlett and then Stephen Dawson rifled a shot wide as Bury sought to regain the lead.\n\nWith Bury continuing to press forward, a Rouse shot was deflected behind for a corner.\n\nHereford finally broke free and an expertly-played pass by Constantine sent Pugh away down the wing, with only desperate header putting his cross behind for a corner.\n\nLee Morris then curled a shot inches wide of an upright from the edge of the area.\n\nFive minutes before the break, a scything challenge on Ryan Green brought Dawson a booking.\n\nFrom the free-kick, 25 yards out, Kenny Lunt curled a shot just over.\n\nBut the Shakers were not to be discounted and Jones fired just wide from 20 yards.\n\nBury re-assserted their threat at the start of the second period and Bartlett grasped a fierce drive from Ryan Lowe.\n\nBut the former Chester striker had better luck on 51 minutes with a crisp drive which flew into the corner of the net.\n\nAnd as Bury continued to have the better of matters, Rouse cracked a shot just wide on the hour.\n\nImmediately before, Hereford had collected their first yellow cards of the season when fouls earned Ryan Valentine and Southam cautions in quick succession.\n\nKeith Lowe then did his best to gift Bury a third when he passed straight to his namesake Ryan but, fortunately for Hereford, Bury’s over-intricacy cost them the chance.\n\nBrown was typically alert on 75 minutes, racing off his line to block when Southam sped on to a Pugh pass.\n\nBut Ryan Lowe should have extended the lead, blazing over from a good position, and Jones forced another low save from Bartlett as Bury kept up the attack.\n\nGodsmark, by now leading the attack after a round of substitutions, stretched to head straight at Brown as Hereford struggled to get back into the game.\n\nBut their hopes were dashed five minutes from the end when Ryan Lowe beat the offside trap to add the third.\n\nAnd to add to Hereford’s misery, Valentine’s second yellow card of the evening brought an end to his involvement four minutes from time.\n\nHereford: Bartlett; Green, Lowe, Dennehy, Valentine; Godsmark, Southam, Lunt, Pugh; Constantine (Tolley, 70 min), Morris (Done, 46 min). Subs not used: Adamson, Rose, D Jones, Gwynne, McQuilkin.\n\nBury: Brown; Scott, Futcher, Sodje, Buchanan; Worrall, Dawson, Barry-Murphy, Jones (Racchi, 84 min); Lowe (Johnson, 88 min), Rouse (Morrell, 73 min). Subs not used: Cresswell, Baker, Belford.\n\nReferee: Roger East (Wiltshire).\n\nAttendance: 2,321 (217 from Bury) Goals: M Jones, 10 min, 0-1; Constantine, 15 min, 1-1; Lowe, 51 min, 1-2; Red card: Hereford – Vaklentine, 58 min, foul; 88 min, foul.\n\nYellow cards: Hereford – Southam, foul, 60 min; Dennehy, dissent, 89 min; Bury – Dawson, foul, 40 min;"
