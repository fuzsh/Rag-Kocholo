        "text": "The Ford Motor Company was opened in Trafford Park in October 1911 to assemble Model T cars and trucks and was the first outside America and Canada; over 300,000 vehicles were built before operations were transferred to Dagenham, Essex in 1931. The Second World War (1939-1945) resulted in Ford returning to Trafford Park to produce the Rolls Royce Merlin aero-engine under licence which was used in both the Spitfire and the Lancaster.\n\nThe new factory on Barton Dock Road was located close to the original Ford site and on completion the factory buildings spanned over 44 acres. By June 1941 the company was producing 400 engines a month; by 1943 this had risen to 900. The Merlin engine was described by the Royal Air Force as a “Wizard Engine”\n\nBorn on 12 June 1887, at 2 Crosby Place, Steven Street, Stretford, James Neville Marshall was an acting Lieutenant Colonel attached to the Lancashire Fusiliers.\n\nOn 4 November 1918, while commanding the 16th Battalion at the Battle of the Sambre, a partially-constructed bridge over the Sambre-Oise Canal came under concentrated fire by enemy forces and was broken before his advancing troops could cross.\n\nAt once, James organised repair parties and, under intense fire, stood on the bank encouraging his men and assisting in the work. When the bridge was repaired, James attempted to cross at the head of his battalion and was killed. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery in February 1919.\n\nEdward Colquhoun Charlton was born on 15 June 1920 in Gateshead, County Durham and moved to Stretford aged 5.\n\nEdward enlisted in the Irish Guards, completing his training at Caterham Depot, Surrey. He was called up to the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards on 19 September 1940.\n\nIn 1942 he joined the 2nd (Armoured) Battalion, Irish Guards and shortly after D Day (6 June 1944) he was sent to the Guards Armoured Division 1st Squadron as a Tank Co-Driver.\n\nOn 21 April 1945, he was co-driver of a tank which, with a platoon of infantry, seized the village of Wistedt, Germany. When attacked by the enemy Edward, on his own initiative, decided to counter attack, advancing in full view of the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties. Despite having been wounded several times in his arm Edward mounted his gun on a fence and continued firing until finally collapsing from his injuries. Edward was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) posthumously.\n\nLord Kitchener (real name Aldwyn Roberts) is widely known as the “Grandmaster” of calypso music, Trinidad’s native musical style. Also known by the names “Kitch” and the “Road King”, Lord Kitchener achieved international success and legendary status throughout his long career. He arrived in England on HMT Empire Windrush on 21st June 1948.\n\nHe moved to Manchester in 1953, briefly owning a night club, whilst continuing to record songs. Lord Kitchener lived at various addresses in Manchester and Trafford, including 48, Brooks Road (1957-1962).\n\nHe performed at the Manchester Carnival in 1962 and was part of the milieu which gave birth to the Notting Hill carnival, in the late 1960s.\n\nLilian was born in Stretford in 1864. Trafford Golf Club opened in 1891 and it was here that her interest in golf began.\n\nLilian joined Timperley Golf Club and won the Jubilee Challenge Trophy in 1897, later becoming lady Captain.\n\nIn 1904, a committee of women associated with Manchester Golf Club, decided to form a women’s club. She took on the role of Secretary and wrote to the Captain and Council to request more independence.\n\nOn 17 March 1905, the First A.G.M. of the Manchester Ladies’ Golf Club was held at Trafford Park Hall. It was unanimously agreed that Lilian should be Captain and after that she was elected Honorary Secretary, a position she held until her death.\n\nIn 1912, she was made an honorary life member of the Manchester Golf Club, in recognition of her valuable service."
