        "text": "Connor Martin should have put Tom Baker’s side ahead after just four minutes when a superb low cross by Chris Palmer found him in acres of space at the back post but with the goal at his mercy, and only eight yards out, he struck the outside of the upright.\n\nDroylsden right winger Billy Hasler-Cregg proved to be a constant threat on his flank and gave debutant Liam Davis a torrid time at left back.\n\nIn the 35th minute visiting striker Domaine Rouse broke clear down the middle but lost his footing as goalkeeper Russ Saunders sped from his goal and just one minute before the interval Rouse was in action at the other end when he cleared an Aaron Burns back-heel off his own goal-line.\n\nSaunders then saved a Hasler-Cregg drive at the second attempt three minutes into the second period but was helpless to prevent the visitors from taking the lead just sixty seconds later when Droylsden broke away and Hasler-Cregg cut inside and drove the ball hard and low into the bottom corner.\n\nDroylsden were now firmly in control as Trafford struggled to play with any cohesion and both James Hampson and Hasler-Cregg went close to increasing their lead.\n\nHowever, in the 77th minute Trafford found themselves back on level terms when a free kick from the left fell to Andy Langford who hooked the ball over his shoulder and into the top corner.\n\nFor the first time in the game, Trafford were now on top and substitute Chris McDonagh agonisingly headed a Luke Horrocks cross onto the roof of the net from 10 yards.\n\nAnd in the 90th minute the Shawe View boys were awarded a penalty when Droylsden left-back Ben Barber was harshly adjudged to have tripped Dorney.\n\nThe visitors were incensed by this decision and it was perhaps justice, both in the decision and the pattern of the game, that Dorney’s spot kick was saved by the legs of Steve James.\n\nThe final whistle signalled the end of a disappointing performance by Trafford and they will be hoping for a big improvement on Saturday when they entertain Clitheroe at Shawe View, kick off 3pm."
