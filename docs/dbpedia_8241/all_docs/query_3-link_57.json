        "text": "BURY boss Chris Casper is looking to the future after steering the Shakers clear of the League Two relegation trap door.\n\nHe is planning to field a few youth team stars like Domaine Rouse and Dale Stephens in the final game of the season at home to Mansfield Town on Saturday, May 5, kick-off 3pm.\n\nAnd with 14 members of the squad out of contract next week he is busy trying to convince players to sign extended deals.\n\nHe admits that several players will be leaving the club once the curtain is drawn on the 2007 season.\n\nThe on-loan trio of Darren Kempson, Jason Kennedy and William Mocquet are set to go back to their respective clubs after Saturday's game but Casper is looking into signing those players permanently after being impressed with their contributions to Bury's successful fight against relegation.\n\nHe concedes that he is unlikely to get all three, with Kempson the most likely to stay on board.\n\nAnd Casper has rubbished the suggestion that Saturday's game is a dead-rubber.\n\nHe is keen for the club to get another home win on the board to avoid equalling their worst ever home league campaign when they won just four league games at Gigg Lane in the 1968/69 season. And he wants his side to entertain the fans and give them a happy final memory of what has been another disappointing season.\n\nCasper said: \"It is a huge relief to have beaten the drop. The players have been magnificent under so much pressure in the last few months and I'm really proud of them.\n\n\"For a long time it was looking as though it'd come down to the last game of the season but, thankfully, that isn't the case.\n\n\"We are still desperate to win on Saturday though. We want to end the season on a high and give our fans something to cheer about. They have been magnificent this season and we want to show our appreciation with a good performance and a good win.\"\n\nStar striker Andy Bishop and winger Marc Pugh will miss Saturday's game through injury, joining midfielder Brian Barry-Murphy and defender Chris Brass on the sidelines.\n\nBishop has a muscle problem in his knee while Pugh has a badly bruised foot.\n\nNeither injury is said to be serious but Casper sees no reason to risk their long-term futures on Saturday.\n\nCasper said: \"With the relegation issue settled it is time to start building for the future.\n\n\"I may play a few of the young lads coming through on Saturday. The likes of Domaine Rouse and Dale Stephens may get a chance to impress with a view to next season.\n\n\"And I am looking to get new contracts sorted out for certain players.\n\n\"Saturday's game may be the last one for some players at the club.\n\n\"The three players on loan (Kempson, Kennedy and Mocquet) have done very well for me and I'd love them to stay. I'll be looking into that.\"\n\nBury won 2-0 at Mansfield at the start of December but they have not won a home game since they beat Stockport five months ago."
