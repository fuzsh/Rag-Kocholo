        "text": "Stretford regeneration will create a sustainable town centre for the people, by revitalising the high street and surrounding areas to create an experience with community at the heart of it.\n\nThe vision is to create a town centre experience to shop, work, play and stay, which is greener and healthier and has improved connectivity to link all neighbourhoods. This inclusive dynamic mixed-use development will create a new thriving community. With sustainability at its core, we are aiming for a self-sufficient town centre.\n\nSince acquiring Stretford Mall in 2019, Bruntwood and Trafford Council have undergone an extensive consultation period with the general public and key stakeholders. After hosting three engagements across 15 months, both digitally and in-person we identified a number of consistent themes that helped shape our masterplan for Stretford:\n\nPeople want a better, busier town centre\n\nThe area is ready for change, with improvements for the benefit of local people\n\nImproved connections around and across Stretford is a major issue. People want better pedestrian routes and links to the Metrolink\n\nResidents want a better quality environment, with more greenery and public open spaces\n\nStretford Mall Masterplan\n\nA hybrid planning application for the Future Stretford proposals is being submitted to request approval for the redevelopment of the Mall and Lacy Street, for new access points and the demolition of a number of existing buildings. It sets the parameters for the development - to establish what can and can't be built.\n\nThese proposals aim to deliver a vibrant and economically sustainable new town centre for Stretford, with shops, employment, leisure opportunities and new homes.\n\nThe main elements of the proposals are:\n\nto re-establish King Street as a lively new high street. We aim to keep existing businesses and attract new shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars to Stretford - including independent and well-known brands.\n\nsignificant and beautifully designed new public open spaces and green areas - equivalent to 1.5 football pitches.\n\nsignificant investment to modernise the multi-storey car park to make it light, convenient, and safe.\n\nambitious plans for future improvements to Kingsway and Chester Road.\n\na maximum of 800 new homes.\n\na new St Matthew's residential quarter\n\nKing Street Planning Application\n\nFocussing on the King Street shopping area, this will be a detailed planning application that works within the parameters established by the hybrid application.\n\n(pictured: the emerging vision objectives)"
