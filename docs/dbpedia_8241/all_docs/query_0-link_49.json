        "text": "A few weeks ago, an early morning dash from Gatwick to Jersey parkrun by Paul Jeffrey and his girfriend reminded me about the parkrun alphabet challenge.\n\nJersey is the only “J” in the UK so anyone wish to complete the challenge – a parkrun for each letter of the alphabet – needs to head to the Channel Islands or further afield (there’s a great website for parkrun tourist jargon here).\n\nI’ve now completed over 100 parkruns in 23 locations (five countries) but have only made it to 17 different letters (the letter “M” is the only thing that Milan and Mile End have in common).\n\nI clearly needed to up my alphabet game but couldn’t find a list of parkruns anywhere. So I made one. As at the beginning of January 2018, these are all of the parkruns in the world, in alphabetical order (Russian parkruns have been Google translated).\n\nHope it helps you on your own challenge! Come find me on Strava so I can see how you get on – Sam Wilkes\n\nPost-Covid (for the main) BIG update – June 2023\n\nHello!! Having done my newest international parkrun in the USA (see Byxbee), I thought I would have another crack at the list. And I think it might just work.\n\nSomething to consider:\n\nSome places have not restarted parkruns after the pandemic whether on an individual level like in San Francisco or as a country (France). This was obviously not something I considered when first putting together the list so I’ve taken the decision to only include active parkruns at a point in time. That means that the list may now shrink as well as grow.\n\nAlso, the way that parkrun display their data means it is a very manual task to update and also means that the region is no longer available so it is just on a country basis.\n\nWith that in mind, there are some exciting developments:\n\nAachener Weiher parkrun in Germany has replaced Aberbeeg parkrun at the top of the alphabet (with the former first name on the list dropping to third behind Abbey Park parkrun). At the other end of the list, Zuiderpark parkrun in the Netherlands has replaced Zillmere parkrun in Australia – exciting stuff! All in all there are now 1930 parkruns in the world which is crazy!! There are also 10 opportunities to get the Z (still no X) so time to get travelling!\n\nCovid update – Jan 2022\n\nHi everyone – I think I may have found a way to update the list. However, my coding skills (or lack of) mean it will only be on a country basis. And as all countries are not yet open for parkrun – I will wait until they are before attempting my deep data dive…should be any time now yeah…\n\nDecember 2019 update\n\n1423 parkruns around the world (up from 1114) and Aberbeeg has replaced Aberdeen as first in alphabetical order!\n\nJersey Farm has joined Jersey in the “J” category for the UK (not sure how I feel about this).\n\nFull List – June 2023"
