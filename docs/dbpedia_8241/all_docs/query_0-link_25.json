        "text": "The visitors started the Evo-Stik North clash brightly and Ciaran Kilheeney saw a shot shave the outside of the post in the first minute.\n\nJason St Juste was finding space down the left for the hosts and his cross in the seventh minute was headed over by Andy Keogh.\n\nTrafford then turned the screw and a quickfire double put them firmly in control.\n\nScott Sephton combined with Keogh in the 14th minute, releasing Michael Monaghan and his deft chip over the onrushing goalkeeper deflected in off the underside of the bar.\n\nIt was 2-0 seconds after the restart, Jack Dorney feeding Aaron Burns who coolly slipped the ball under the visiting keeper.\n\nDorney was supplier again on 19 minutes, but his cross was just too much for the outstretched leg of Keogh.\n\nDroylsden enjoyed a period of pressure, but their patient build-up play ended with Grant Shenton smothering Dominic Smithâ€™s shot.\n\nThe visitors started the second half strongly with substitute Domaine Rouse injecting some pace up front.\n\nIn the 52nd minute, Shaquille Clarke set up Liam Caddick but home keeper Shenton saved with his legs.\n\nTrafford then enjoyed some pressure themselves when, on 74 minutes, Steve Mason headed wide when unmarked at a corner.\n\nThe visitors were looking for a way back into the game, playing a high line and increasingly leaving themselves exposed at the back.\n\nTrafford should have added to their tally on a couple of occasions, when both James Dean and Chris Palmer beat the offside trap but could not find a way past the goalkeeper.\n\nKeogh was also guilty of missing chances when he had two golden opportunities in the 77th minute.\n\nFirstly, he was challenged well in the box when fed by Dean and seconds later he steered a Louis Corrigan cross wide from six yards when it looked easier to score.\n\nTrafford were good for the points when Keogh atoned for his earlier misses.\n\nSephton found Dean in space on the edge of the box, he cushioned the ball down to Keogh who stroked the ball coolly into the bottom corner to round the match off in style three minutes from time."
