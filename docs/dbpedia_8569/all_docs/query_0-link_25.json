        "text": "Early life\n\nBorn to father Mensur KuriÄ from NiÅ¡ whose family roots go back to Donji Vakuf and mother Nada Wasche from Sarajevo, Irfan grew up in Sarajevo's Dolac Malta neghbourhood.[1][2] At the age of 15, his parents divorced and Irfan moved with his father to NiÅ¡.\n\nIn NiÅ¡, Irfan's father married actress Miroslava \"Mima\" VukoviÄ, so Irfan spent part of his teenage years with a stepmother.[1]\n\nEncouraged by his stepmother, young Irfan pursued performing arts and successfully passed the audition to enroll at the Academy of Theatre, Film, Radio and Television in Belgrade.[1] Soon after moving to Belgrade, he legally changed his last name to Mensur in honour of his father.[1]\n\nCareer\n\nHe is living and playing roles in Serbia for 30 years. He is married to actress Srna Lango. The couple lives in Belgrade and they have one son. Both have children from previous marriages.\n\nDuring the 2000s decade, the couple took one of the main roles in TV serial Jelena filmed in the production of Serbian RTV BK Telecom.\n\nIn December 2010, Irfan and Srna appeared as contestants in popular reality show Parovi on the Serbian TV station Happy TV.\n\nPersonal\n\nIn 1976, at the height of his Beach Guard in Winter popularity in Yugoslavia, twenty-four-year-old Mensur married the twenty-three-year-old Trebinje-born model Ljiljana PeroviÄ who had, much like him, also spent her childhood in Sarajevo before ending up in Belgrade in pursuit of a show business career.[3] The couple had a son, Filip, in 1983 before divorcing in 1984.[3]\n\nIn 1995, forty-three-year-old Mensur married twenty-four-year-old actress Srna Lango who, like Mensur, already had a son from a previous marriage.[4] Their son Pavle was born in 1999.[4] The couple divorced in 2012.[4]\n\nIn April 2013, sixty-one-year-old Mensur suffered a heart attack while preparing a play at the Zoran RadmiloviÄ Theater in ZajeÄar.[5][6][7] He was immediately rushed to a cardiovascular clinic in Belgrade where a triple bypass surgery was performed.[7]"
