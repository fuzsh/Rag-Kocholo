        "text": "ABOUT OSCAR WILDE\n\nOne should be familiar with Wilde’s life in order to enjoy his books. Just like the good and prolific Renaissance masters, he held his life in his hands as a work of art (…) his excellent paradoxes on politics and nations, on richness and work have become outdated, while his witty sentences about life and art sparkle with more light every day. A lot has been written about Wilde, either malicious or positive. (…)\n\nThe three main characters are merely three Wilde’s faces: a lord who wittily despises everything, a painter who desperately loves everything beautiful and a youth who plunges into pleasure looking for answers to the secret of life. In the fireworks of sharp sentences that mock everything, there is a beauty of words, which is only rarely found in literature. What we read there intoxicates the soul and makes the book seem to possess the power its title character believes into. Wilde simply astonishes with his vast knowledge of beautiful things. It is all scattered throughout the novel, sometimes recklessly, but with endless abundance. This is surely the most brilliant novel about decadent English aristocracy, more accurate than French novel The Red Lily by Anatole France. And when Wilde as an ironic psychologist and an impetuous moralist shall be long forgotten, only then Wilde’s glory as an aesthete will become strong. Because, as an aesthete, he represents one of the most exquisite minds who dedicated themselves to writing. Although he approached art only from its hedonistic side, since it probably is the only side to approach it, he wrapped it into mysterious greatness that ever since the ancient Greeks to this day nobody could accomplish. Therefore, the novel will be a special experience for everybody. Because, when you read it and forget all the characters and events in it, some sort of restlessness will remain in your soul for a long time owing to mysterious beauty of the novel, the sort that only the works dating from Greek and Renaissance times possessed, when they knew the truth, “Beauty is the only thing time cannot damage. Philosophies scatter like sand, religions succeed each other, but beauty is the delight of all times and belongs to eternity”.\n\nExtracts from Miloš Crnjanski’s review\n\nOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray, Feniks Libris, Belgrade, 2005\n\nVLADIMIR LOGUNOV\n\nVladimir Logunov is a ballet artist, choreographer and pedagogue.
