        "text": "About Famous People\n\nMilan Kovacevic was one of the journalists legend of Television Belgrade. He was born on January 23, 1915 in Kotor Varos. Before World War II he successfully dealt with athletics, and after the war he edited a variety of newsletters dedicated to this sport, and in the period from 1952 to 1958 he was editor of the Belgrade newspaper \"Sport\".\n\nKovacevic belonged to the first generation of journalists at the recently established Television Belgrade, and during his many years of work by the qualitative standards in the genre of travelogue TV reports, which are still elusive. The highest altitude reached on television when he left the sport journalism and began to create (to date unsurpassed) series including \"Caravan\" and \"The camera through the world.\" The first three pilot episodes of \"Caravan\" Kovacevic was implemented in 1963, 1964 and 1965, and by 1983 he recorded a total of 114 broadcasts of this series, in which the author of TV viewers discovered landscapes, people and customs that did not know that exist in contemporary Yugoslavia. \"Caravan\" are characterized by specific (hitherto unknown) television expression and authentic approach to the treatment of certain area, that any viewer could not leave you indifferent. That is why, until the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, \"Caravan\" was the most watched TV series in this part of the Balkans.\n\nIn addition to the \"Caravan\", Kovacevic in the period from 1968 to 1973 and recorded 29 travel stories under the same title \"With camera through the world\", which are (also) had remarkable viewership among Yugoslav TV viewers. Milan Kovacevic in both series was a screenwriter, director and commentator. However, recording every show \"Caravan\" was preparing so meticulously, that in his - or unique personality - united and historians, archaeologists, biologists, geographers, linguists and cavers. In TV circles is remembered as a tireless seeker, whose authentic commentaries and impeccable diction helped to television becomes truly a window into the world. Rarely creator of Television Belgrade has managed to, in such a long period of time (from two decades), so maintain uniform quality of their emissions, as it was Kovacevic. Although it is considered to be a great fighter and a man for whom there existed no environmental obstacles, one of the knights of the domestic television lost his battle with a serious illness on July 18, 1985 in Belgrade ...\n\nOne of the most popular Serbian writers, Branko Copic, was born at the foot of Grmec, in the village of Hasani, January 1, 1915. He attended primary school in his village, lower secondary school in Bihac, while the teachers' school in Banja Luka and Sarajevo, and ended up in Karlovac. In 1940 he graduated from the pedagogical and philosophical group of the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade. During his studies he occasionally wrote and published stories in \"Politika\". The Second World War he spent in partisan lines, where, among other things, successfully worked on organizing cultural and educational activities. The period spent in Partisans much influence on subsequent literary work of Copic, because it is based on what is experienced in World War II wrote novels \"Prolom\", \"Silent Gunpowder\", \"Do not grieve bronze guard\" and \"Eighth offensive\" and short stories \"Dew on bayonets,\" \"Crude school\", \"Love and Death\", \"the Adventures of Nikoletina Bursac\" and \"Bitter honey\", as well as a collection of poems \"Warriors spring.\"\n\nBranko Copic after the war settled in Belgrade, and from 1951 he became a professional writer. He wrote the \"national language\", whose beauty, grandeur and lightness come to the fore in most of his works. By the end of his life he published about 150 titles, and is rightly considered among the most prolific and widely read writers of the late 20th century in the former Yugoslavia. Copic is for many people today the best children's writer, was born on the territory of the former common homeland. His novels \"Eagles Fly early\", \"Glorious warfare\", \"Battle of the Golden Valley\" and \"Donkey's years\", followed by collection of short stories \"Tales of partisans\", \"Breakneck stories\", \"The stories below the dragon's wings\" and \"Adventures of a cat Tose\" as well as a collection of poems \"Magic Forest\", \"The Army, defense yours\", \"Partisan sad fairy tales\", \"Grandpa Trisa mill\" and \"Naughty boys\" are an essential part of an anthology of literature for children.\n\nLess well known is that this prolific writer, the author of scenarios for war movies \"will live the people\" and \"Major Bauk\" and wrote theatrical comedy \"The Adventures of Vuk Bubalo\" and a piece for children \"Shock workers\". Political persecution, which was exhibited almost the entire post-war period, most likely influenced the Copic`s decision to end life by jumping from the Branko's Bridge in Belgrade, on 26 March 1984."
