        "text": "12/03/2014 - The US production starring James Floyd, Noémie Merlant and Anthony LaPaglia is being shot entirely in Serbia with a local crew\n\nThe US production Newcomer is filming entirely on location in Belgrade, Zlatibor and Mokra Gora in Serbia until 18 March. The title, written and directed by Kai Barry and produced by Gregory Chou and Serbian-born, Hollywood-based Srdjan Stakic in association with Dominion Pictures and Serbia's Emote Productions, has Brian Kavanaugh-Jones (Sinister, Insidious: Chapter 2) on board as executive producer.\n\nAn action spy thriller about a Special Forces rookie whose mistake costs the lives of his entire team and turns him into the scapegoat and the primary suspect of an international manhunt, Newcomer stars James Floyd (My Brother the Devil ), Anthony LaPaglia and Noémie Merlant alongside a local cast that includes Predrag Ejdus (When Day Breaks , Redemption Street ), Dragan Mićanović (Coriolanus , Rocknrolla ) and Irfan Mensur (Sheitan's Warrior).\n\nUnlike most US and international productions that have been filmed in Serbia over the past few years, Newcomer has employed heads of departments locally, including Bosnian DoP Erol Zubčević (An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker , A Stranger ), production designer Aljoša Spajić (Redemption Street, White White World ) and debutant costume designer Jovana Božović.\n\n\"It was the combination of locations, cast and crew that made Serbia the optimal home in which to film Newcomer,\" says Barry. \"As with any project, some of the early directorial vision changes when presented with practical locations. However, Serbia became an inspiration – not a compromise.\""
