        "text": "Savior is about hope\n\nAparajita Saha\n\nBosnia.\n\nIt's a black dot on the map for most.\n\nFor some, it's a way of life. And death.\n\nSavior unflinchingly captures the grim realities of the Bosnian war and puts a human face on the tragedy.\n\nRobert Orr, who spent two years, starting 1993, in Bosnia, as a photographer's assistant and relief worker, writes a dramatic assertion of humanism in the face of unspeakable horror in Savior.\n\nInspired in part by an actual incident, the film is directed by Serbian emigrant Predag Antonijevic and filmed in the Republic of Montenegro.\n\nThe movie opens in Paris, 1987.\n\nJoshua (Dennis Quaid) loses his wife (Nastassja Kinski, in a miniscule role) and child in a terrorist bombing. His blinding need for revenge leads him to commit a crime that forces him to go into hiding.\n\nAfter joining the Foreign Legion, he assumes a new identity and takes on a new life as a hired gun for the Bosnian Serbs.\n\nFlash forward to Bosnia 1993.\n\nFighting with the Serbs against the Croats and the Muslims, an emotionally numb Joshua continues to vent his anger at the world. Trained to kill, he ruthlessly knocks down civilians and soldiers alike.\n\nHe is finally shaken out of his almost lifeless state when his partner - a Serbian soldier (Sergej Trifunovic) - brutally attacks a pregnant Serb, Vera (newcomer Natasa Ninkovic). Joshua finds redemption in the hell of rural Bosnia as he protects Vera and her newborn infant.\n\nOne wonders who the real 'savior' is. Is it Joshua? After all, he is protecting Vera and her child.\n\nBut then again, aren't Vera and her baby saving Joshua from eternal damnation by rekindling the goodness in him?\n\nThroughout the film various characters play 'savior' at different times and situations.\n\nQuaid's bare, emotionally raw performance lends a remarkable austerity to his character. While his gruff charisma adds dignity.\n\nThe striking Yugoslavian-born actress Natasa Ninkovic makes an impressive debut as the young mother Vera. Young Serbian actor Trifunovic is convincingly evil as Joshua's loudmouthed and detestable partner.\n\nNastassja Kinski, who plays Joshua's wife, is gone with the blink of an eye. Stellan Skarsgard's role as Joshua's soldier comrade is equally brief and unmemorable.\n\nMuch of Savior's power stems from director Antonijevic's carefully calculated use of disquieting acts of brutality.\n\nAlthough shockingly despairing, Savior is about hope.\n\nThe film has the stench of death. Yet, it also offers a new lease of life.\n\nFor reconciling these contradictions and much more, Savior is worth a viewing."
