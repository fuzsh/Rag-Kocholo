        "text": "Serbian actors Irfan Mensur, 68, and Zarko Lausevic, 60, successfully battled the coronavirus, for which they were hospitalized together at the Bezhaniska kosa clinical hospital in Belgrade.\n\nMensur and Lausevic lay in adjoining rooms of the hospital and watched and cheered each other every day.\n\nMensur says that he barely defeated the coronavirus and that his biggest support was Lausevic, who did everything to cheer him up in difficult moments.\n\nI was close to death\n\nMensur was in a difficult situation and was fighting for his life, and Lausevic did everything to \"lift\" him.\n\n- I was constantly on oxygen for fifteen days. As soon as I was connected to the machine, it crossed my mind that it was over. I was close to death, I felt it, but I was not afraid. We will all experience that sooner or later. At almost 70 years old, I have done enough in my life, so I do not worry that one day I will be gone. The only thing that bothered me in those difficult moments was the fact that I did not tell some people everything I had planned - said Mensur, to whom the hospital days were easier in company.\n\n- Laush was lying in the apartment next to mine. He arrived at the hospital a week before me. We hung out every day as much as our health allowed. We encouraged each other. When he came out of the hospital, he left me a big cup of coffee with a painted smiley face. That gift has become my amulet and will last as long as I live Added Mensur.\n\nHe has a long recovery ahead of him\n\nMensur found out he was infected with the coronavirus while preparing the play \"Anna Karenina\" at the National Theater in Nis.\n\n- During the rehearsal I felt exhausted, reduced concentration and loss of strength. Three colleagues tested positive. I got a fever and was immediately transferred from Nis to Beжаниaniska kosa. Fortunately, I arrived on time - explains the actor.\n\nIrfan was released from the hospital two weeks ago and is facing a long recovery.\n\n- The worst is over. I am still taking medication and receiving injections. I am currently in self-isolation and need to do a control test in a few days. I expect to be able to function normally in about a month - says the actor.\n\nZarko Lausevic contracted the coronavirus while undergoing a cyst surgery on his tooth, Serbian media reported unofficially. His condition was stable, but doctors recommended that he be treated in hospital because he had high blood pressure."
