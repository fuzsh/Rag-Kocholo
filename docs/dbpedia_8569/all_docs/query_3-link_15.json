        "text": "The name of the nation is derived from the two nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which share an ill-defined boundary. Four-fifths of the country, or in the north, is occupied by Bosnia; the remaining third, in the south, is occupied by Herzegovina.\n\nIn 2021, the average global GDP per person was roughly 12.259 USD. On the other side, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s GDP totaled 22.57 billion USD or 6.916 USD per person. Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is now ranked 111, is one of the smaller economies.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina has long been a trade-oriented nation with a multicultural population as a result. Currently, mosques worldwide may be heard calling out for prayer.\n\nBosnians are thought of as being gregarious, amiable, and pleasant. They like Merak (a relaxed pace of life). Different qualities are emphasized by each large group.\n\n1. Dino Merlin – Pop rock Artist\n\nThe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s first national anthem, “Jedna si, jedina,” was written by notable Bosnian singer-songwriter, musician, and producer Edin Dervihalidovi, better known by his stage name Dino Merlin.\n\nHe is regarded as one of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s most outstanding artists and is well-liked in other former Yugoslav nations. The Bosnian and ex-Yugoslav diaspora populations in the US, Turkey, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Bulgaria, and Austria are also well known for him.\n\n2. Alija Izetbegović – Military Commander\n\nHe was a Bosnian politician, activist, lawyer, novelist, and philosopher who was elected as Bosnia and Herzegovina’s first president in 1990. He held this position until 1996, at which point he was elected to the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency and served in that capacity until 2000.\n\nAdditionally, he wrote other publications, including the Islamic Declaration and Islam Between East and West.\n\nHe was also an ardent Muslim who envisioned a free and independent Bosnia. As president, Bosnia declared its independence from Yugoslavia (1992–1996). Seven centuries before the present, during the medieval Bosnian Kingdom, Bosnia attained independence for the first time.\n\n3. Vesna Bugarski – Architect\n\nShe was born in Sarajevo just before World War II and later rose to prominence as Bosnia and Herzegovina’s first female architect.\n\nShe was the sole female student attending the University of Belgrade. She transferred back to Bosnia once the department of architecture opened up in her hometown of Sarajevo.\n\nShe established a profession as an interior designer in Bosnia after graduating in 1964. Everything was going pretty well for her until the 1992 armed conflict. Although Sarajevo was occupied and dangerous to stay in, she refused to leave.\n\n4. Goran Bregović – Musical Artist\n\nHe is a controversial musician and composer and is a musical legend. As the lead guitarist for the rock band “Bijelo Dugme,” he rose to prominence. He managed to stay in the spotlight after the band’s breakup because he spent most of his time composing movie scores.\n\nHe is also well-known for organizing the “Gua Brass Festival,” which attracts over 100,000 visitors from all over the world to a small town in Central Serbia. The wedding and funeral orchestra,” in which he is currently playing, frequently performs in European countries and former Yugoslavia.\n\nHe has shared the stage with critically acclaimed musicians such as Iggy Pop, Cesaria Evora, and Kaya, with whom he recorded an album, throughout his half-century career.\n\nHe has also performed in prestigious international venues such as the Royal Albert Hall, L’Olympia, and even Carnegie Hall.\n\n5. Edin Džeko – Soccer\n\nHe is one of Bosnia’s most successful football players. He is currently a striker and captain for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team as well as Roma (in the Italian national football league).\n\nHe had previously played for Manchester City and VfL Wolfsburg. After scoring his 50th league goal for Roma in 2018, he became the first player in history to score 50 goals in one of Europe’s top five major leagues.\n\nHis impressive achievements, including a national and international football career, have made him a legend among Bosnians.\n\nAt home, he is known as the “Bosnian Diamond.”\n\n6. Marin Čilić – Tennis Player\n\nHe is a Croatian professional tennis player who was born on September 28, 1988. His career-high ATP singles ranking is World No. 9, which he attained on February 22, 2010.\n\nHe rose to prominence after defeating then-World No. 2 Andy Murray in the fourth round of the 2009 US Open. He then advanced to the semifinals of the 2010 Australian Open, where he was defeated by Murray.\n\nHe began his career at a young age, and his potential was recognized by local hometown coaches who saw him play and encouraged him to move to Zagreb for additional training. He became a professional in 2005.\n\n7.Miralem Pjanić – Soccer\n\nHe is a Bosnian footballer who currently plays for Roma in Serie A and the Bosnian national team. He is an attacking midfielder who has been described as an “old-fashioned playmaker with tremendous technical ability.”\n\nHe became interested in football through his father, a former third division football player in SFR Yugoslavia, and began his football career in Luxembourg after his family moved there shortly before the outbreak of the war in Bosnia.\n\nHe previously represented Luxembourg at the under-17 and under-19 levels as a youth international. He competed in the 2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, scoring the team’s lone goal.\n\nHe decided to pursue a senior international career in his birth country Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2008, and he made his debut in August of that year. Two years later, in March 2010, he scored his first international goal against Ghana.\n\n7. Lepa Brena – Pop folk Artist\n\nFahreta ivojinovi, better known by her stage name Lepa Brena, is a Bosnian singer, actress, and talent manager.\n\nWith over 40 million records sold, she is arguably the most popular singer of the former Yugoslavia and the top-selling female recording artist from Yugoslavia. Despite her Bosniak ethnicity, she considers herself Yugoslav.\n\n8. Ivo Andrić – Novelist\n\nIvan “Ivo” Andri was a Yugoslav novelist and short story writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961.\n\nHis writings focused primarily on life in his native Bosnia during the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHis childhood home in Travnik has been turned into a museum, and his Belgrade apartment on Andriev Venac is home to the Ivo Andri Museum and the Ivo Andri Foundation.\n\n9. Boris Tadić – Politician\n\nBoris Tadi is a Serbian politician who served as the country’s President from 2004 to 2012. On April 5, 2012, he resigned to force an early election.\n\nHe stepped down as Democratic Party leader following his defeat in the 2012 presidential election and his party’s poor rating, as well as his loss of power.
