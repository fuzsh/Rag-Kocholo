        "text": "AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nWe've been remembering this week a moment that happened 100 years ago. Specifically, it was 100 years ago tomorrow. That's when Gavrilo Princip shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. The assassination triggered the first World War, charting the course for the 20th century. Princip's legacy is the subject of intense debate. And as NPR's Ari Shapiro reports, nowhere more than in Sarajevo itself.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: The street corner where the assassination took place is now a one-room museum. Mirsad Nazerovic gives tours here. He points to a black-and-white photo, showing a pillar that used to stand outside this building. It was a monument with a very short life.\n\nMIRSAD NAZEROVIC: His construction started in 1916. It was finished in 1917 and destroyed in 1918.\n\nSHAPIRO: That was the first in a long string of short-lived memorials to the assassination.\n\nJAMES LYON: The question you're faced with is very stark - was Gavrilo Princip a terrorist, or was he a national hero? There have been tug-of-war interpretations and they have changed over time.\n\nSHAPIRO: Historian James Lyon went down a list of monuments that have been erected on this site, built up and torn down with each change in power. There was a plaque in the 1930s. It said Princip fired shots expressing the longing of people to be free. It was removed when the Germans arrived, then World War II ended.\n\nLYON: Immediately after the Partisans retook Sarajevo, a plaque was put up, saying that this was where Gavrilo Princip threw off the German occupiers, obviously with references to the recent war in mind.\n\nSHAPIRO: For a while, there were footprints in the sidewalk where tourists could stand in Princip's shoes. Those were torn out during the Balkan wars in the '90s. And this is not the only place where the battle over Princip's legacy is raging. To reach Princip's grave, you have to take a cab outside of town.\n\nThis doesn't have the look of a historic site. There are people selling used books. There is sort of a grungy cafe. There is a highway overpass and the cemetery itself looks a little bit run down.\n\nInside, there's a small chapel where Princip and most of his co-conspirators are buried. He died in prison after being convicted of the assassination. Some of the others were executed. Historian Edin Hajdarpasic says the inscription on the chapel literally refers to the assassins as heroes.\n\nEDIN HAJDARPASIC: And above it is a citation from the Montenegrin poet Njegos, and it reads, (reading) blessed is he who lives forever. He had something to be born for.\n\nSHAPIRO: So this is not what you would think of as the grave of a villain?\n\nHAJDARPASIC: Absolutely not. It has hero written all over it (laughing).\n\nSHAPIRO: Hajdarpasic says in every era, people with power try to use Gavrilo Princip as a symbol. The meaning of the symbol changes depending on who's talking. Even Hollywood got in on the act. The real Princip was a scrawny, malnourished guy. But in the 1975 movie \"The Day That Shook The World,\" he's a smoldering heartthrob.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE DAY THAT SHOOK THE WORLD\")\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) Don't do it.\n\nIRFAN MENSUR: (As Gavrilo Princip) (Unintelligible) Try to understand. I must do it.\n\nSHAPIRO: The people with first-hand experience of the assassination, this all seems very odd. Haaris Pasovic is a theatrical director in Sarajevo. His grandfather was a teenager working in the family shop on June 28, 1914, and actually heard the gunshots that killed Archduke Ferdinand.\n\nHAARIS PASOVIC: My grandfather mentioned that once to me in passing. So it wasn't, you know - the Sarajevo assassination wasn't ever the big deal in Sarajevo - you know?\n\nSHAPIRO: Not for locals anyway. But politicians know a powerful tool when they see one. And for the last 100 years, Gavrilo Princip has been a more potent symbol in death than he ever was in his life.
