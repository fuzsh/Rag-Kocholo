        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor embodied Hollywood glamour, defining again and again what it meant to be a movie star.\n\nBorn in London in 1932 to American parents, Taylor and her family moved to Los Angeles when she was seven years old. In L.A., she started her acting career at the young age of ten with her debut film, There's One Born Every Minute. After the movie was released, Taylor's contract with Universal Pictures was dropped, and she signed instead to MGM, shooting to fame as a teenage star after her 1944 performance in National Velvet. From there, her career took off,eventually garnering her two Oscars for Best Actress, but today, Taylor is perhaps as well known for her work off screen as on. She was a dedicated philanthropist, and one of the first celebrity activists in the fight against HIV/AIDS, co-founding the American Foundation for AIDS Research and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. “There are three things I never saw Elizabeth Taylor do: Tell a lie, be unkind to anyone, and be on time,” said Mike Nichols, who directed her in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. In 2001, she was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal.\n\nA new documentary, Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes, which features Taylor telling her own story, premieres this weekend on HBO. “Elizabeth Taylor is one of the first modern celebrities,” director Nanette Burstein tells Town & Country. “Like Princess Diana or today’s stars like Taylor Swift, Elizabeth was plagued by the paparazzi and one of the first to navigate intense public scrutiny. For Elizabeth, fame was the bane of her existence. As she says, she likes being an actress, but she doesn’t like being a public utility. Years later, in the 1980s, Elizabeth realized her fame could be her superpower and she could use it for philanthropic efforts.”"
