        "text": "The first Jewish community in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina arrived in 1492, fleeing the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions. Though they were treated as second-class citizens, like other non-Muslims under Ottoman rule, these early Jewish settlers were afforded significant rights and autonomy and enjoyed a relatively peaceful existence. However, the following century saw a spike in antisemitic sentiments and behaviors, forcing many Jews to move from their original quarter in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This became an unfortunate trend for Bosnian Jewry, as successive centuries saw gradual (and sometimes explosive) increases in regional antisemitism.\n\nTensions began to subside in the 19th century; in 1839, new civil rights laws dramatically improved the living situation for Jews in the area. This was furthered in 1856 when non-Muslim subjects in the Ottoman Empire were granted full equality. In 1876, Bosnian Jews were elected to the Ottoman Parliament in Istanbul. The Austro-Hungarian empire took over Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, resulting in an influx of Ashkenazi Jews. The development saw a mixing of Ashkenazi and Sephardic cultures, as the established Sephardic community was greatly influenced by the new Ashkenazi communities settling in the area. By the end of the century, the Bosnian Jewish population had greatly increased to about 10,000 people.\n\nWorld War I saw the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the incorporation of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The interwar years saw the Jewish population continue to gradually increase, and the community thrived as it built a Sephardic synagogue that was considered the largest in the Balkans, hosted several different Jewish-related activities, and even established a seminary.\n\nA small Jewish community was re-established following World War II, but many survivors emigrated to Israel. Jewish life and identity were repressed during the post-WWII communist era.\n\nBosnian Jews found themselves thrown into the middle of the turmoil when Yugoslavia violently split apart in 1991. Violence in Bosnia was exacerbated by the breakout of civil war, as several ethnic factions began fighting one another, though Jews were not targets of such violence. The Bosnian Jewish community was largely outside of the conflict, and with that in mind, aimed to provide sanctuary and assistance to all Bosnians. La Benevolencija, the Bosnian Jewish community’s humanitarian organization, helped distribute supplies and medical care to those in need, regardless of ethnic or religious identity.\n\nDuring the siege of Sarajevo by the forces of \"Republika Srpska\", a self-proclaimed Serbian secessionist movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Sarajevan Jewish community helped assist the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in the evacuation of thousands of Sarajevan residents, both Jews and non-Jews alike. In the aftermath of the war, many Bosnian Jews who had left chose not to return.\n\nToday, the Jewish community in Bosnia and Herzegovina enjoys peaceful relations with the broader Bosnian society and can freely practice its religion without issue. It also enjoys a relatively open role in Bosnian society and political life, with Sven Alkalaj serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2007 to 2012.\n\nThe Holocaust devastated the Bosnian Jewish community, with almost three-quarters of the pre-war population murdered by the Nazis, Bosnian collaborators, and the fascist Croatian Ustaše organization. In 1941, Bosnia was incorporated into the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia, and in that same year, the Germans occupied Sarajevo. The Independent State of Croatia was grounded in notions of racial and ethnic “purity,” and it was the expressive aim of the state to exterminate “outsiders”, such as Jews or Serbians.\n\nNumerous anti-Jewish decrees, including the adoption of the Nuremberg laws and the incarceration of Jews, were prominent and publicly espoused by the regime. When the Germans arrived, such sentiments were increased. One of the first acts of the occupying Nazis was to burn the famed Sephardic synagogue, which was done with the help of local Muslims.\n\nThe Mufti (Muslim legal expert) of Jerusalem, Haj Amin Al-Husseini, was especially active in Bosnia during this time. An ardent antisemite and supporter of Hitler, Al-Husseini sought to enlist recruits to a Bosnian-Muslim SS unit and encouraged the deportation and extermination of Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nConcentration camps were set up throughout the independent Croatian state. Between 1941 and 1943, almost 5,500 Bosnian Jews were deported to camps in Sarajevo, Zagreb, and Loborgrad. From there, over 1,150 Jews were then transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The majority of Bosnian Jews were sent to the Kruscica camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina; 3,000 people were murdered there. About 10,000 Bosnian Jews were murdered during the Holocaust – about 71% of its pre-war population."
