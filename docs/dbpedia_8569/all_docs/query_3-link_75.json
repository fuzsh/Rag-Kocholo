Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.\"\n\n-Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n\"The true mark of a leader is the willingness to stick with a bold course of action — an unconventional business strategy, a unique product-development roadmap, a controversial marketing campaign — even as the rest of the world wonders why you're not marching in step with the status quo. In other words, real leaders are happy to zig while others zag. They understand that in an era of hyper-competition and non-stop disruption, the only way to stand out from the crowd is to stand for something special.\"\n\n-Bill Taylor, from the article \"Do You Pass the Leadership Test?\"\n\n\"The very essence of leadership is that you have to have vision. You can't blow an uncertain trumpet.\"\n\n-Theodore M. Hesburgh\n\n\"You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing you think you cannot do.\"\n\n-Eleanor Roosevelt\n\n\"In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.\"\n\n-Thomas Jefferson\n\n\"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, concerned citizens can change the world. Indeed it is the only thing that ever has.\"\n\n-Margeret Mead\n\n\"A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.\"\n\n-Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.\"\n\n-Charles Darwin\n\n\"Leaders grasp nettles.\"\n\n-David Ogilvy\n\n10 important quotes on how good leaders raise the bar and unlock potential\n\nExcellent leaders raise the bar, inspiring others to achieve the most that is possible. Here are 10 powerful quotes on unlocking people’s potential:\n\n“I start with the premise that the function of leadership is to produce more leaders, not more followers.”\n\n-Ralph Nader\n\n\"The single biggest way to impact an organization is to focus on leadership development. There is almost no limit to the potential of an organization that recruits good people, raises them up as leaders and continually develops them.\"\n\n-John Maxwell\n\n\"A good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better.\"\n\n-Jim Rohn\n\n\"Leaders instill in their people a hope for success and a belief in themselves. Positive leaders empower people to accomplish their goals.\"\n\n-Unknown\n\n\"If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.\"\n\n-John Quincy Adams\n\n\"A great person attracts great people and knows how to hold them together.\"\n\n-Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe\n\n“Leadership is the art of giving people a platform for spreading ideas that work.\"\n\n-Seth Godin\n\n\"A leader is best when people barely know he exists. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.\"\n\n-Lao Tzu\n\n\"A leader takes people where they want to go. A great leader takes people where they don't necessarily want to go, but ought to be.\"\n\n-Rosalynn Carter\n\n\"Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others.\"\n\n-Jack Welch\n\n10 leadership quotes on the qualities of a great leader\n\nAverage leaders raise questions and find the roadblocks - skillful leaders seize on what they don’t know and find the answers.

The leader adjusts the sails.”\n\n-John Maxwell\n\n\"Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.\"\n\n-John F. Kennedy\n\n\"Wise leaders generally have wise counselors because it takes a wise person themselves to distinguish them.\"\n\n-Diogenes of Sinope\n\n\"The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.\"\n\n-William Arthur Ward\n\n\"No man will make a great leader who wants to do it all himself, or to get all the credit for doing it.\"\n\n-Andrew Carnegie\n\n\"Anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm.\"\n\n-Publilius Syrus\n\n\"A good leader takes a little more than his share of the blame, a little less than his share of the credit.\"\n\n-Arnold Glasow\n\n“The most dangerous leadership myth is that leaders are born-that there is a genetic factor to leadership.

Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.\"\n\n-Helen Keller\n\n“Effective leadership is not about making speeches or being liked; leadership is defined by results not attributes.\"\n\n-Peter Drucker\n\n“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that count.\"\n\n-Winston Churchill\n\n\"Victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan.\"\n\n-John F.
