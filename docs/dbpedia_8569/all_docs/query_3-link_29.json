        "text": "In the Bosnian Valley of the Pyramids, you can meet famous people every day who gather energy for work and peace of mind in Visoko.\n\nSome new, interesting projects are also born there, and journalists attended the birth of one such project at the Ravna Complex. Namely, at Ravna, there was the famous Croatian musician Goran Karan, who is a regular guest, and with him was the versatile artist, musician, and actress Elis Lovric.\n\nGoran was the first to reveal what was happening in the Bosnian Valley of the Pyramids and what these two artists were up to.\n\nActing work\n\n”We are staying with Dr. Osmanagic in Visoko, and we needed the friendliest place within a radius of 1.000 km, and we found it here. We are doing a show that will be a kind of musical confession with a guitar, and the working title is ”Ljubav je fer – Price iz moje ulice” (Love is fair – Stories from my street),”Goran said.\n\nIt is Goran’s play, in which he plays the main role, and Elis is in charge of directing.\n\n”I have already been here twice and I was very happy when Goran invited me and suggested that we start the project right here. As for the play, we met a couple of years ago at the Sibenik Festival, where the idea was born, which I liked, which includes my entire acting work, but also music, that is, a creative synergy,” Elis pointed out.\n\nCloser to people\n\nThis is an exclusive story and the announcement from the Bosnian Valley of the Pyramids, and as Goran said, they hope that the premiere will be in Visoko.\n\n”I hope that we will have the premiere here for our convinced friends. I really like everything here, every time I come I get closer to people, and everything goes rather relaxed, a lot of things are done without excessive running and fatigue,” said Karan and sent a message to people to come to the Bosnian Valley of the Pyramids, where ”the heart opens and love flows from it”, Avaz reports.\n\nE.Dz."
