In our house, the night before between June 19 and 20, 1991, Hasibs wife Hisveta had spent the night together with her mother Cumra and her three sons. They stayed in our house for as long as the shooting did not stop, at some 14:00 hours.

For this reason, it was not strange to us at all that they came to spend the night with us on that particular night, because our relations were very close.\n\nAfter they left, my father said that we should give water to the cattle, have lunch and then go all of us together to the center of the village to see what to do next.\n\nMy wife at one moment told me that some 20 armed Muslim soldiers are coming, headed by the son of our neighbor Mustafa Musinbegovic called \"Dico\".

Then he was told that he must leave his house in Tenja and must never again return to it for as long as he is not given the permission to do so.\n\nThe witness after that left Tenja and went to Osijek, where he and his wife were employed and took shelter with his cousin.\n\nWhen the witness by the end of September 1991 for the first time was arrested, he was detained in a basement room of the hospital where he was employed. He was accused of \"spying\" for the former Yugoslav Peoples Army (JNA) and was beaten on that occasion. The arrest was done at his place of work so that all his colleagues could see him arrested and taken away at gun point. The witness was in that way compromised, in view of the fact that he was enjoying a good reputation among the employed in the hospital.\n\nIn October 1991 he was arrested for the second time also at his place of work. Then he was accused of being a sniper shooter, firing at the Croat soldiers, which was not true.\n\nThe witness was arrested for the third time on December 7, 1991 by three young men in camouflage uniforms, in the house of his cousin where he was temporarily residing. They told him that they are taking him for \"informative talk\" and have taken him to Dubrovacka Street, to a building on which was a large flag of the HDZ (Croat Democratic Community). They took him to the cellar room in which the witness noticed immediately the traces of blood.\n\nThey asked him only one question: \"Who are the Chetniks that you know and who are the Chetniks with whom you are collaborating?\". Since the witness did not know the answer, explaining that he did not know any such people, they were asking him again and again the same question, and then they started beating him with the truncheon and a gun. On that occasion his nose bone was broken and his scull fractured behind the right ear and many other injuries were inflicted upon him.\n\nWhen at one moment they took away his wallet, one of them said to the other to destroy the documents, because the witness will not be needing them any longer.\n\nThe witness was so much beaten up that he could not walk, and they had to carry him out of the room. His hands here tied with celotape behind his back, and paper was pushed into his mouth and over his mouth a large celotape was sealed. He was thrown into the car type \"Audi 80\" green in color and was driven to the part of town called Trvdja, on the way to Bastion. At the distance of some 600-800 meters from Basion, they drove to the river bank of Drava where they stopped at the stairs leading down to the river Drava.\n\nHe was taken out of the car by the driver and one soldier with a pistol, for whom the witness later learned that his name is Jure Relatic, and was taken down the stairs. Behind them was walking the man they called \"chief\". There, close to the water, Relatic cocked the pistol and at point blanc fired a shot at the witness head hitting him in the left side of the jaw. At the same time, \"the chief\" pushed him with his foot into the river Drava.\n\nOnce in the water, since he was only wounded, the witness pushed his head above the water. Then Relatic fired another shot at him hitting him through the open mouth into the lower side of the jaw. After that they went away.\n\nThe witness, although heavily injured, succeeded somehow in freeing himself from the celotape and swimming to the staircase leading to the plateau on the river bank.\n\nWhen he saw that the same car with the lights on is approaching again, he hid into the bushes. The car stopped at the same place, and Relatic and another two uniformed soldiers took out of the car another person, who the witness recognized under the car lights as Dr. Milutin Kutlic, a surgeon and oncologist from Osijek, who was his acquaintance.\n\nRelatic fired at the head of Dr. Kutlic and his body once slump, was pushed down the stairs into the water. Then they boarded the car and drove away.\n\nWith the greatest of efforts, loosing consciousness from time to time, the witness succeeded in coming up to Kugin monument, where he fainted and regained consciousness in the Osijek hospital where medical care was given to him. Then he learnt that some passers-by have found him and took him to the hospital. He also learnt that on that same night another 8 Serbs were killed in Osijek, among them one woman. Although with permanent injuries to his health, he was the only one that survived.\n\nThe witness later on learnt that the perpetrators were arrested in Osijek, but that they were soon released.\n\nINDICATIONS CONCERNING PERPETRATORS:\n\n1.
