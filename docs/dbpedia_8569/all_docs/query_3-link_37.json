        "text": "1. SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCIES DURING OTTOMAN AND AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN PERIOD IN B&H (1463-1918)\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H), before its occupation by Austro-Hungarian military in 1878 the territory covered by the current state and some eastern regions, which belonged to it at the time of its independence, no major resorts. The state was located in the mountainous region, surrounded by countries of different religions and interests, which conflict had a significant impact on the state and progress (1-3).\n\nThere was little literate population, while practically the only literacy gained in madrasas and mosques in maktab the major towns, the Muslim population, then the monasteries perched in the rugged and little affordable areas, and partly in the Bosnian nobility and gentry. Epidemics are constantly ravaged almost all of its parts, people are exhausted because it was not drugs (4-6). Population assistance is sought in a variety of fortune and priests, the wealthy were approached Dubrovnik that they are in the city provide treatment, or that they send a doctor from Dubrovnik (5, 6). Hospitals and health care and treatment of patients was not established until the second half of the nineteenth century, and the largest percentage of the population is generally treated in their homes (7-10). With the arrival of the Turks in the territory of B&H in 1463 which they brought with them a new state structure, significantly changed the views of the entire life of man and society. Turks bring with them experience and medical literature that were adopted from the Arabs, which was already at an extremely high level (11-20). Turks after his arrival in Bosnia brought a new way of social and personal life, which, in addition to prescribing the maintenance of high levels of personal hygiene, insist on some other activities and measures of personal and social life. Raise the public baths, and every Muslim houses had a special form of a home bathroom (5, 6, 7). Raised are the first water supply, thereby establishing a practical first sanitary facilities in B&H. According to data of Alija Karahasanovic (1), up to half of the seventeenth century in 92 towns in B&H, there were a total of 56 public baths, and only the fourth in Sarajevo He also built and public toilets. The first was built in Kovaci around the 1526, and later raised another in the present clock tower at the bazaar, and one on the Miljacka. At each place they built a public fountain for washing before regular religious observance, and wealthy citizens have brought the water in your backyard (5, 6). The first modern water supply received Mostar 1886, Sarajevo 1890, Banja Luka 1908 and Tuzla 1910. During 1910 in another 36 major sites in B&H received water, sewage work included a little slower. The first was built in Sarajevo 1896. In addition to every mosque is built in a public fountain. The very measure of personal hygiene is not sufficient in order to prevent various diseases, especially those of epidemic character, which then-ravaged Bosnia and relate the lives of many Bosnians. The most frequent diseases were: syphilis (which, apparent by French cruisers and they called it “Frenjak”. First description was from 1790 when local physicians in village Škrljevo nier Rijeka (Fiume), Croatia, reported about “new disease” and named it “Morbus Skrljevo”, in French - “Mal di Fiume”), tuberculosis, leprosy, trachoma, favus and other fungal diseases, etc. (5). The last two centuries in B&H, ravaged the acute infectious diseases, some of which are related epidemic and the lives of endemic diseases - cholera, which is frequently penetrated from other countries, smallpox, which in B&H was a frequent and inevitable phenomenon until the 1907 year, followed by typhoid fever and dysentery, due to poor water supply and poor hygiene of foodstuffs, as well as measles, scarlet fever and diphtheria, among children (5, 6). About mental illnesses, their prevalence and treatment in the Turkish period, there is not much data.\n\n3. THE FIRST HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS AND THE FIRST MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS\n\nDuring the period from the 16th to the 19th century, until the establishment of Vakuf’s hospitals - Hastahana’s in the five Bosnian-Herzegovinian cities (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Mostar, Travnik and Banja Luka), the population in B&H was mostly treated by medicines and herbs from the “ljekarusa’s” - rulebooks or other written documents written by trained but also learned „traditionalist’s“, attar’s (ittar’s), religious staff (hojja’s, friars, etc.); or they were transcripts of medical manuscripts from other languages that have been brought to our country in various ways (Arabic manuscripts of „Avicennian medicine“) (11-20). More professional were: barbers (they represented as surgeons) and the healers who set the diagnosis and prescribed medication (used alternative medicine). The Franciscans, who studied in Western countries, treated population with translated or personally written „ljekarusa’s“ (medicine recipes), preparing herbs from grass, oil and fat, or acquiring them from attars, the forerunner of pharmacists. Pharmacy has begun since the early 11th century, when the monks in Monte Cassino (Italy) began to deal with medicine. This interest is linked to the emergence of the one of oldest medical school in Europe, in town of Salerno (Salernum in Campania, Southern Italy). That school had enormous influence on the development of medicine and pharmacy and health in general in the 12th century. Numerous works have been translated into such an environment into our languages. One of the most famous parts is “Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum or Flos Medicinae”. This work was in use until the 19th century. In BiH, such writings have emerged from a national experience. The recipes were based on medicinal herbs and superstitions that the people of BiH were inclined to. Drugs are differently accepted from the medical side. Medical historians think that they were created at the time of the fall of ancient medicine, so there were some views on the world such as astrology, alchemy, magic, etc (16-23). The books of Fr. Franjo Gracic and Fr. Petar Maresevic differ in form and form. In 1895, Fr. Gracic published his medical book in Latin in Padua: „A theoretical and practical analysis of the priests on the behavior of the crazies, the house and the snake poison, about many other diseases and their main drugs, and some other things“. This work is first published book of medical content of one author from B&H. The most famous ljekarusa dates from 1774. It is preserved in Fojnica Monastery, written by a bosancica. In 1791 a ljekarusa called “Pharmacopoeia familiaris bossinensis” was published. The text „Summary Review of Health and Medical Opportunities of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Past“, from the “Prosveta Calendar” (issued from 1905 to 1914), Dr. Risto Jeremic (2, 5) talks about health culture in BiH through a brief history. „With the arrival of the Turks, we began to cultivate a health culture in Bosnia... The first graduate doctors of Bosnia were the Franciscans, the Friars of the Italian Universities: Fr. Petar Bustrović (1708-), Fr. Franjo Gracic (1720-1799), Fr. Tadija Lagarevic (1761-1840) Fr. Mato Nikolic (1784-1844), Fr. Tomo Dafinic, Fr. Petar Maresevic (since 1837 he was the first doctor of medical sciences in B&H) and Fr. Mijo Sucic (since 1850 he was the first specialist in surgery in B&H). Ivan Franjo Jukic founded the first journal in BiH „Bosnian Friend“. Drugs and recipes were published there. Until then, they were released in some other editions, most often in calendars. In 1795, Fr. Franjo Gracic printed a medical booklet in Latin on the treatment of certain diseases. Fr. Mato Nikolic graduated medicine in Feldsberg in 1807 and he is the first doctor in the history of B&H. In his personal skill was physician-surgeon Fr. Mijo Sucic (died 1865). Numerous documents testify that the Franciscans in their medical practice aided all people, regardless of their religious or other differences. In Italy, he was graduated in Padua in 1850 and he was graduated from Sarajevo by Isaac Salom, a military doctor and a member of the Sarajevo Administrative Council. The first physicians Muslims were Mehmed Serbic and Zarif Skender, graduated in Istanbul in 1873. At the end of the 18th and early 19th centuries in Sarajevo, practitioners of Jews: Jozef Haim Salom and Samuel Sumbul. There were also foreign doctors, such as Dr. Franz ?, Dr. Pavle Kramer, Dr. Gustav Gaal-Velibeg, Dr. Gabor Galanthay. By the middle of the 19th century, the Turks or Greeks worked in BiH, often serving Turkish military sanitation. The first among them was the Swiss Jozef Kecet, who was a personal physician of Omer Pasha Latas, and later Topal Sherif Osman Pasha, and his bibliographer, who left two books with factorial description of events in B&H during that period. The new power of laws and regulations initiates the construction of new, more modern health care institutions to primarily protect their new citizens. The health service is organized according to the laws of governed the Monarchy itself. A major obstacle to these efforts was the conservative perception of the local population, and the lack of financial resources and the educated medical staff. For this reason, a special department was established at the State(Land) Government in Sarajevo, headed by a doctor from the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. There are 6 districts from Bihac, Banja Luka, Mostar, Sarajevo, Travnik and Tuzla, and they are placed at the expense of the terrestrial budget, with an annual salary of 1200 forints. Each county has represented a special healthcare community with one doctor who performs health care services privately and manages its own home apothecary. The poor population was treated free of charge.\n\nAt the time of occupation, the city of Sarajevo had two Turkish hospitals ( ) - Vakuf’s and Millitary (both opened in 1866), and quarantine (Churche Han). The military hospital was a closed type and used for stationary treatment, mostly for soldiers, and the Vakuf’s hospital had modest capacities (a total of 40 beds). There were four trained doctors: Dr. Theophil Koetschet, Dr. Leopold Kramer, Jacov(b) Sumbul and Rafo Atijas. There was a modern pharmacy in which Eduard Plajell worked, who came to Sarajevo in 1877 (5, 6).\n\nOn the basis of the Austro-Hungarian Government’s order of 1879, all „promoted, graduate or probed doctors, ranches (Wundaerzte), dentists, veterinarians and midwives who attended school at the appropriate school establishments in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy are allowed to practice in B&H. That is why all doctors had to file a healthcare application. They were obliged to do the practice neatly, keeping a professional secret.\n\nBy the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 the state is changing its material base and social structure. With the occupation army, came skilled workers: the Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Polishs and others who build the barracks, railways, housing for the military. For all of them must be well-organized health service. It called for the formation of the first social insurance funds, so in 1888 in Bosnia formed the so-called fraternal insurance fund intended for miners, such as those that have already been formed on the territory of Slovenia, Croatia and Dalmatia in 1854, and Serbia 1866. True, the social legislation in Austria dates back to the 1810, and in 1887-1888 was released in Austria the Health Insurance Act (5, 6). The Government of Bosnia adopted a Law on Social Insurance, which entered into force in 1910. Otherwise, the Basic Health Act was passed in Austria 1870, and in Hungary 1876 (the law written by renowned hygienists Fodor). These data suggest that illustrate the Austro-Hungarian Empire took strict care of the health care of your appliances and citizens of countries that were occupied. According to the unique concept of the organization, socially-oriented health services, with strict organizational principles proclaimed that every hospital (district, county, municipal), each clinic must arrange the outpatient service and maintain appropriate hygiene and safety measures.\n\nFirst, so-called „Necessary hospitals“ (notsspittaler) who had a small number of beds and only the most basic equipment were founded, and since 1886 the construction of the so-called „municipal hospitals“ that were run by municipal doctors or district doctors.\n\nSuch hospitals were founded in: Tuzla (1886, 30 beds), Prijedor (1886, 13 beds), Brcko (1886, 16 beds), Mostar (1887, 42 beds), Konjic (1889, 14 beds), Banja Luka, 64 beds), Visegrad (1896, 11 beds), Bijeljina (1900, 27 beds), Trebinje (27 beds), Foca (6 beds), Prnjavor (20 beds), Bosanski Novi (20 beds), Derventa (32 beds). From 1892 to 1903 county hospitals were founded in: Kotor-Varos, Kladanj, Srebrenica, Cazin, Livno, Vares, Gacko, Kljuc and Gorazde (see Health instititutions network in 1901 on ). In 1879, a total of 7 doctors were employed in the civil service in BiH, and in 1893, that number increased to 64, out of which 41 were in the civil service, 19 were municipal services, and 3 doctors worked only as private doctors. The end of the Austro-Hungarian rule in BiH is characterized by an increased number of healthcare staff, so that the total number of doctors in BiH amounted to 168, out of which 106 were in the state administration, 30 in the municipality, in the company and factory 9, in the terrestrial railways 5, and there were 18 private doctors. By taking the Austro-Hungarian monarchy into power in Bosnia, the social structure is changing. Qualified workers from Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland are eligible to settle. Railways, barracks, residential buildings, hospitals are build.\n\nThe lack of hospital capacities was motivated by the authorities to build the State/Provincial (“Landesspital”) in Sarajevo, which was built and opened on July 1, 1894. In the State Hospital were employed high quality doctors who, besides the clinical part, also engaged in scientific research in the field of medicine. So many of the scientific and professional papers that were recognized outside the borders of B&H were also published. Many of them were published in the first scientific journal in B&H - “The Annual of the State hospital in Sarajevo - Godisnjak Zemaljske bolnice u Sarajevu”, which dates from 1897 to 1903 in German. At the beginning of the First World War in 1914, a total of 234 physicians, 141 inpatients, 8 dentists and 71 MA Pharmacists worked in 17 hospitals (837 beds), 58 municipal ambulances and 43 public pharmacies. On average, one inhabitant had 0.6 beds, one physician was 12.912, one had 16.222 inhabitants, and one apothecary 40.384 inhabitants.\n\n5.

Born on 14 February 1830 in Delémont, Switzerland. Studies completed in Bern, Vienna and Paris. After completion of medical school he went to Turkey, where he worked as a Turkish military physician in the Crimean War (1853-1856). Accompanied by a controversial Omer Pasha Latas, Kecet came to Bosnia, where at one time worked as a Turkish military physician and as a personal doctor of Topal Sherif Osman Pasha. It is know that he also tried to deal with diplomacy, as the Austro-Hungarian officer, and that he was offered the services of personal physician of the Montenegrin prince, which he refused with a large dose of diplomacy.

He had two sons, Aleksandar, born 10 May 1862, and Teofil Ladislav Kecet (Theophil Koetschet), born 29 April 1864, which graduated in medicine in Vienna.\n\nImportant and interesting fact recorded in the literature is that in Vakuf’s hospital in Sarajevo, opened on October 8th of the 1866, in the year 1791 Dr. Karel (Karl) Bayer (1850-1914), who was Director of Vakuf’s hospital from March 1885 (and had also private surgery in Sarajevo at his flat in Pruscakova street 17)) carried out the earliest recorded neurosurgical operations for epilepsy (on three patients with post-traumatic epilepsy) (29-31, 35). All three patients had suffered from epileptic fits caused by bone fragments in the brain. The operations consisted of craniotomy, removing of the bone fragments and closing the dura mater. The patients were reported cured (31). Dr. Bayer was member of State Health Council from 1896 and also the first President of Society of physicians of Bosnia and Herzegovina (35).\n\n6.2. MEHMED SERBIC (1847-1918)\n\nMehmed Serbic Sami was born in Sarajevo 1847 where he finished high Ruzdi. After Ruzdi went to Instanbul and remained there for 12 years. In that period graduated medical studies in 1873 at “Ecole de Medicine”, opened in 1843 in Istanbul ( ). He has diploma in Turkish and French. In 1874 he was appointed as physician in Tuzla, Zvornik province, and worked till 1866 when Hastahana closed and Dr. Serbic continued to work in new opened hospital. In 1879 he notified diploma at Vienna University. As a physician he followed the Bosnian pilgrims to Mecca in 1892, when 120 pilgrims from 59 of them died from the plague. As a physician, he participated in the war against the Austro-Hungarian 1875-1876, arround Bijeljina. He is the founder of Kiraethana (Library) in Tuzla 1891 where he was Director until 1914. A regular member of the Medical Association of the Croatian Kingdom and Slovenia became on 1 January 1896. He had spoken Turkish, Arabic, Persian, French, Greek and German language. On Turkish language he had written in 1869 the book “Kavanini Dzerahin” - “Surgery regulations” as the first edition manuscript of treating wounds. Practicaly it was the first book about surgery in B&H, containing 369 pages in 24 chapters, and which included large sections of the surgery. To him and other doctors this was an outstanding guide. His daughter Dr. Hiba Serbic Ramadanovic was the first Muslim woman who graduated medicine in Belgrade in 1939. The first Muslim woman physician in B&H was Sevala Iblizović, graduated medicine in Zagreb in 1931.\n\n6.3. JULIJE MAKANEC (1854-1891)\n\nJulije Makanec comes from the Croatian noble family Makanec. After Baron Jelacic abolished the celibacy, the family sold all their possessions and moved to Zagreb, and later to Bosnia and Herzegovina Travnik and Sarajevo) ( ). Dr. Julije Makanec II was a physician, a member of the City Council of Sarajevo. He was one of the experts who came to Sarajevo in 1879 to be the chief city pharmacist, then became a temporary district physician, and he was also a police physician. In 1884 he founded the „Bosnische Post“ magazine and opened a printing house in his house in Kulovica Street under the name of „Spindler and Loschner“ (his partner and his wife, by the birth of Loschner). Later he sold the magazine to the first editor of Eugene Topffer, and the press gave Spindler a lease. Through the „Bosnische Post” - “Bosanska posta”) magazine, a public call was sent to interested parties to support the establishment of a special Museum Society for Bosnia and Herzegovina that would work on preparations for museum establishment. To prevent the destruction of archeological antiquities and their relocation from the country in 1880 he founded the first Archaeological Society. Dr. Makanec was long-term Director of the Society. He invited expert (in 1886) Dr. Ciro Truhelka, archeologist of the Museum of Arts and Crafts in Zagreb, to come to Sarajevo and help in organisation of Museum. Truhelka will later be profiled as one of the most eminent researchers in BiH, but will also be long-term director of the National Museum. Delighted with this project, the City Administration, supported by H.E. Benjamin Kalaj (Kallay), assumes funding for the Archaeological Society, which in 1888 opened the first museum in BiH with the help of Kosta Hörmann, Karl Pač (Patsch), Ćiro Truhelka and Vejsil Ćurčić. The museum was initially housed in the Gazi Husref-bey palace building. The Society then gathered around 500 members and immediately started working not just for collecting and studying the antiquities, but also for exploring nature. When the National Bank of Sarajevo was founded, it became a member of the management of the first and second year since its foundation. The exchange office of Josip Loschner was also one of the initiators of the deceased, and in the latter years he was reluctant to take a bathing place in Kiseljak to obtain a lucrative voice in and out of the country. From these short lines, Dr. Makanec, apart from his medical attendance, has been living actively in municipal, cultural and economic affairs, gaining a great reputation and respect. As a doctor, he created a friendly social position for himself, as rarely one of Austro-Hungarian citizens. His scientific education, beside medical education, was extensive. Apart from mother’s language, he spoke several foreign languages, and also Turkish. He was a man of his own mind, objective in mind, full of different ideas. Dr. Julije Makanec died of an illness in 1891 in Jeddah (Džeda), where he was a physician of Bosnian Hajja’s on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Makanec than was only 37 years old (4-6).\n\n5.4. TEODORA KRAJEWSKA (1854-1935)\n\nTeodora Krajewska (called her Dr. „Quine of Bosnia“), was a Polish-born Austro-Hungarian physician, writer and teacher. Teodora was born in Warsaw in 1854, then part of Russian Poland ( ). She left Warsaw in 1883, travelled to Switzerland and enrolled in the University of Geneva. Krajewska first studied physiology, becoming the first female teaching assistant in the university’s history, and then took up medicine. Krajewska passed her final exams in 1891 and received an award for her doctoral dissertation the following year, but found that she could not obtain the nostrification of her diploma or practice medicine in her homeland (5, 34). In 1892, she was hired by the authorities of Austria -Hungary to work as a public health official in Bosnia and Herzegovina. One of the first women to practice medicine in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Austria-Hungary, Krajewska mainly treated Bosnian Muslim women, whom she regarded as susceptible to particular health problems. Due to the specific health situation in the country at the end of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian period beginning, there was a need for the involvement of women physicians, who are required to have doctors in general medicine and a good knowledge of the Bosnian language. At that time, women could only study at medical schools in Switzerland and in Vienna - at the early twentieth century, 1901 the study of medicine has become available in Vienna for women. The State Government had intended to systematize the place of women doctors in a hospital in Sarajevo, seeking to be appointed for two women students of the Faculty of Medicine in Zurich (34). If these measures proved useful, place the physician would be entrusted to women and doctors in other places. The circle of women candidates was narrowed down to the Czech and Polish women (34). Prejudice against them were enhanced because of the political situation. Their task was to offer free medical help and advice to women who have just birth and their patients in the home or clinic. These two phjysicians were pioneers in scientific research activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nKrajewska wrote detailed notes about the state of women and Muslim customs. These writings, published in 1989, reveal the patronizing attitude towards Muslims that was common for the era. Krajewska stayed in Bosnia after the collapse of Austria-Hungary but the loss of eyesight forced her to retire in 1922. In 1928, she moved back to Warsaw, a decision she regretted, where she died. Austro-Hungarian districts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Krajewska was first responsible for the towns in the district of Tuzla and then for those in the district of Sarajevo. Teodora Krajewska was named the public health official (Amtärztin) of the District of Tuzla with the rank of captain by the decree of 28 November 1892. In order to perform obstetric and gynecological procedures, she undertook training in a clinic in Vienna. Women could not study or practice medicine in Austria-Hungary at the time, but exceptions had to be made for Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Muslim women refused to be treated by male physicians. Krajewska was thus not only one of the first female physicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina but in Austria-Hungary as well. Seven women in total were employed to treat Bosnian women; Krajewska was one of the three Russian citizens and one of the two ethnic Polish’s, including Bohuslava Kecková. Before assuming her office, Krajewska had to take Austro-Hungarian citizenship. She succeeded Anna Bayerová, a Czech, who had resigned shortly after her appointment due to frequent disagreements with her military superiors. Bayerová was unwilling to care predominantly for Bosnian Muslim women, as her superiors had expected, while Krajewska embraced the task (34). Krajewska’s arrival in Tuzla in March 1893 was announced by the town crier. She was dismayed to find “these marvellous Slavic women covered by veils”. Krajewska learned Serbo-Croatian quickly. She usually rode a Bosnian pony on her visits to remote mountain villages but had to travel by foot when the winters were too severe for the horse. The demand for Krajewska’s services was such that the Austro-Hungarian authorities soon employed Bohuslava Kecková, another Polish, who took up post in Mostar. She returned to Warsaw, now capital of Poland, in 1927. She found that the city had changed immensely and she did not feel at home there anymore. She had been one of the best known and most respected people in Sarajevo, but only an anonymous old woman in Warsaw.\n\n5.5.

In addition, in 1889 she became the first female member of the Anthropological Society of the Habsburg Monarchy in Vienna. Therefore, for the women’s cultural history of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the female question Milena Mrazovic von Preindlsberger is extremely important. In the same year (in 1896) she was married a doctor of the Landesspital in Sarajevo, Dr. Josef Preindlsberger, leaving the „Bosnische Post“ department and turning to writing books and texts for various European newspapers. She wrote about all the important events such as the annexation of B&H, the murder of the H.E. Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip.

PAVLE KAUNIC (1884-1960)\n\nPavle Kaunic (Paul Kaunitz) was born in Vienna in 1884. His father, a physician, gets his post at the Bihac Hospital in 1886, and Kaunic begins his primary education in Bihac, and complete it in Fojnica. Graduated at Gymnasium in Sarajevo. He enrolled at the Medical Faculty in Vienna and completed his studies in 1909 (5, 6, 35) ( ). As a scholar of the Government of B&H he spent four years at the specialization at the Vienna Faculty of Medicine with professors: Weichselbaum, Koliska, Paltauf. After completing specialist examination in 1913, he was appointed as assistant to the pathologist of the Sarajevo State Hospital. During the First World War he was engaged in Military medical corps as a hygienist and bacteriologist and works to prevent and control epidemics in several cities of BiH. After the end of the war, he returns to the job of the assistant of the pathologist at the State Hospital in Sarajevo and in 1919 he was appointed as general pathologist. In the year 1925 he was named as the Head of the Institute for Epidemiology and Director of the Institute of Hygiene in 1929. From this period, he will be remembered as a participant of the event - embalming Prince Ferdinand and his wife Sophia at the „Konak“ Residence on June 28, 1914, following the assassination with supervision of Colonel of 25th Military hospital in Sarajevo, Dr. Gotlib Arnstajn (35). The Sarajevo Assassination is one of the medias and film’s most processed events in history and the theme of many texts of different scale and character. The Sarajevo assassination and the practical cause of the start of the First World War on July 30, 1914, with the announcement of the war from Austria to Serbia. This is because it was considered that Serbian extremists, led by Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sofia of Hohenberg. The subject that has provoked a lively interest and has been subject to mystification for many years in various ways is whether the murdered princess of Sofia was possibly pregnant and carry Ferdinand’s baby in the womb, which was launched in 1924 by writer Borivoje Jevtic, close to the assassins and their circle (35). Until the publication of Jevtic’s memories under the title „Sarajevo Assassination“, about the possibility that the 47-year-old Duchess was pregnant, there was no mention in the public. After the assassination, the Viennese press was full of bombing news, which was soon denied. It was written about the dozens of conscripts deployed in Sarajevo, about explosives on trees, government facilities ... even under the table for a festive lunch at the Konak residence. The worst scenarios were considered, but there was no word about the possible pregnancy of unlucky Sofia, given the fact that earlier (in 1909) - the top Viennese medical authorities strongly recommended that Sofia avoid the pregnancy in the future, given that in that years she had a stillbirth. It is difficult to assume that Sofia did not follow the advices from her doctors. However, crown proof that an undocumented Austro-Hungarian emperor was not pregnant represents the autopsy and embalming of the dead bodies of Sofia and Ferdinand, which took place between 28 and 29 June 1914. The key participant of this operation was the pathologist of the State Hospital (Landesspital), doctor Pavle Kaunic, who described the flow of the autopsy in 1958 to publicist Radivoje Papic and whose full text was published in the book by Izet Masic „The Roots of Medicine and Healthcare in BiH“ (5, 6). After the assassination, it was reported from Vienna that there will be a team of specialists in Sarajevo who will embalm the bodies of Sofia and Ferdinand. However, on the same day (June 28, 1914), the military courier handed to doctor Kaunic the letter by which Dr. Rihard Pollak urgently invited him to the Military Hospital. Dr. Polak asked Dr. Kaunic if he had the instruments and the chemicals needed to embalm the bodies of the killed. After confirmation, Dr. Kaunic was ordered to do all the preparations for autopsy and embalming with assistants Dr. Rihard Pollak and Dr. Edward Hecht. The telegraphic order arrived from Vienna, so the operation started around 22:00 hours on June 28. First Dr. Kaunic removed the blood from the blood vessels and the blood vessels were washed with saline. The bodies are embalmed with the use of glycerin and formalin. The internal organs were treated separately, according to the custom that they applied in the Habsburg dynasty. After the section provided a thorough and detailed insight into the condition of the dead bodies of Sofia and Ferdinand, the team practitioner also carried out the necessary formalities prescribed by law. A detailed report was compiled and the Death certificate completed. Pregnancy was not mentioned even as the indication, because it was not present. Before the completion of the autopsy of Sofia and Ferdinand by Dr. Kaunic and his assistants in Konak were brought the Sarajevo painter Rudolf Valic and his wife Ludmila, which was the sculptor. Ludmila Valic took the dead masks from the face of the Duke and the Duchess, and Rudolf Valic first skirted an interesting multicolored tattoo of the forearm, created in Japan on Ferdinand’s journey around the world, and then made a portrait of the dead Duke. Later, on the basis of that sketch, Valic produced a portrait of Ferdinand in oil. Later, death masks were handed over to the Emperor and the Duchess children, and the tattoo drawing was taken away by the police (35). On the 28th of August, 1914, Dr. Pavle Kaunic was awarded the Order of the Franciscan Order of the Franz Jozef I. At the beginning of the Second World War he was released from duty and returned to the duty of the bacteriologist of Military corps during the war. After the end of World War II, he led the Institute for Hygiene, the Institute for Epidemiology and works as a bacteriologist at the Military Hospital in Sarajevo. In 1949 he returned to the position of head of the Autopsy department of the Clinical Hospital in Sarajevo.
