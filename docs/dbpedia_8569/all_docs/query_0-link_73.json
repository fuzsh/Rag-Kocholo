        "text": "This research paper in its first part focuses on the theoretical concepts of “innovation”, “innovation Management”, and “ICT innovation management”. The second part of the paper aims to follow results of the survey (research methodology) in determining whether the innovation is of interest to the participants of the survey. It questions whether ICT innovations are the key for economic development of the country, or if the interviewees own their (patented) ICT innovative product. It questions where the interviewees find motivation for creation of ICT innovation and if the managers consider opening vacancies for ICT innovation development. It questions whether they are familiar with the Strategy of Innovation Incentives in the Republic of Croatia, in the period 2014-2020, or whether the interviewees believe it was real and achieved. Did the interviewees know that the Republic of Croatia was behind Slovenia, Hungary and Bulgaria according to the Index of Innovation, and if they agree with the statement that innovations are the source of real competitive advantage of individual business, and one of the most efficient ways for sustainable prosperity. Are the SMEs (small and medium enterprises) the cornerstones for development of modern economy?"
