        "text": "I must apologize for the lateness of this blog entry. The fact of the matter is, over the weeks I was supposed to complete this post, I had great difficulty writing. The eye tracking of my computer was askew. I couldn’t control the cursor, which follows my eye gaze. I could not write for weeks, or even communicate with nurses. I’ve been through a very very difficult time. My TV moved, on the judgement of my computer specialist. The computer was then put directly in front of my eyes. That happened, but the computer wasn’t still in the right position. So the carpenter came back and moved the TV 16 inches further over towards the window. This all took weeks. Finally, I was able to write. Nowhere near what it should be. I was then examined by a neurologist and eye consultant. Apparently, the problem was with drooping eye lids. My eyes are okay. I may have eye lid surgery, or use a special computer for drooping eye lids. Unfortunately, this blog entry has been split into two. I have to do that, to get it out. There is still plenty to write before I finish the final section of part 2. So, more is to come. I thank Gwenyth Dobie for putting this blog on the Web and for being patient. I also thank my brother, Ljuba Vukovic for using his influence to get my eyes examined, also, reminding me of names of obscure relatives.\n\nPart 2.\n\nI flew back from Italy, checked in with my agency, and almost immediately, Maureen Vincent and Ginette Chalmers, had me lined up for another film. I was to meet director, Peter Yates and casting director Noel Davis for a film called Eleni. Apparently, it was based on a very interesting book, of how an investigative reporter from a major American newspaper, in the present day, went to Greece, and researched the story of his own mother, in the Greek Civil War at the end of World War 2. They were now making a film about the story. I still had my long beard from King David, and I was full of confidence, as I suppose any actor would be after over 3 months on a major film. I breezed into the meeting and it went very well. I hit it off with both Peter and Noel, who I’d worked with before. My look was perfect for the Greek Civil War. I was half Macedonian, from my mother’s side, and had the dark looks. Plus, the beard made me look ideal for a part in the film, because partisans rarely shaved, being not real soldiers, but Communist idealists. It wasn’t long before I heard that they would give me a part in the film. They didn’t specify what part, but it was obviously as a partisan. I was thrilled. 1984 would be a bumper year!\n\nI was pleased to be back in London again and to see Doe. I went downtown to the bookstore and quickly read the book. Modern investigative techniques were used by a first class journalist to uncover the fate of his own mother. Back at Belsize Park, we had a flatmate on the other side of the apartment that irritated both of us. It was time, with this influx of money, for Doe and I to buy our own property. Before we could think about it too seriously, my agents put me up for a commercial. I can’t remember what product it was for, but they were looking for a 1930´s type gangster. I went for the audition, and would you believe, I was booked for it. The only problem was that I had to lose my beard. 1930´s gangsters didn’t have long unruly beards. I’d heard that there would be an informal reading of Eleni, and that I was invited to at a South Kensington hotel, the day after I shot the commercial. I was not worried about the loss of my beard. I would grow another one before filming began, just like I’d done on King David. After all, they told me that I’d be in the film. I looked forward to the reading. In my situation, I had to take any work that I could. I’d been through some hard times in the past. The day’s filming would be lucrative, also if the commercial was shown a lot, I’d make a lot of money. It was a win win situation. I cut and shaved my beard off.\n\nOn the day of the commercial shoot, they sent a black London cab to take me on the long journey south, to the studio. London had been undergoing a heatwave for the past few days. It had been freakishly hot. Finally, the taxi got to the studio. I went through hair and makeup, where everyone was complaining about the heat. The set was a real and complete old fashioned aeroplane, somehow wheeled into the studio. The action would take place in the plane. The filming in the non air conditioned studio was hot and sweaty. Models and another villainous gangster looking actor were also in the commercial. I kept my relative cool during the shoot. It was uncomfortable, but bearable. The day came to an end. A taxi drove me north to NW3.\n\nIt was the day of the informal reading of the Eleni script. I don’t know what came over me, but I decided to take the VW Beetle down to South Kensington. It was scorching outside. I had a quick coffee, got dressed and found my car on the side street outside the flat. I took the route I normally take when driving to my health club, also in South Kensington: through Hyde Park. The hotel was quite a bit north of the club and I wasn’t familiar with its surrounding streets. Anyway, I couldn’t find somewhere to park. I must have drove around for a good twenty minutes before finding a spot. Meanwhile, it was almost time for the reading. I was late, unless I legged it to the hotel, some distance from where my car was. I hate being late, so I ran to the hotel. It must have been 40 degrees centigrade out on the street. I got there on time. By now, I am sweating. Very far from being ” informal”, there were a large number of actors and actresses, trying to look occupied, or stiffly chatting. It was a large room with a good sized table in the middle. There’s no need for air conditioning in Britain and this room didn’t have it. I couldn’t stop sweating, so I went to the washroom, tried to cool down by splashing cold water on my face. It was no good, I was still sweating uncontrollably. I ventured into the main room. Someone introduced me to the screenwriter Steve Tesich, (of Serbian descent) and producer, Nick Vanoff, (of Macedonian descent). Eventually, Peter Yates, the director spoke. He welcomed us to the reading and asked us to sit around the table. Then he handed out the scripts, saying what part you were reading. He didn’t do that to John Malkovich or Kate Nelligan, they knew what parts they were playing. Malkovich was already cast as the reporter, and Nelligan as Eleni herself. He said that I would read Spiro, the partisan leader. It was a major role, with quite a lot of dialogue. I was still sweating, but settled down and gave a not bad reading. In fact, the actor next to me praised me at the end. It was an interesting reading that John Malkovich gave. He was the opposite of me, calm, understated, totally at home in the situation. He was the modern day reporter. In fact, most of the actors and actresses did cope with a potentially nerve-wracking situation very well. Only I could not stop sweating. Would the screenwriter and producer put in a good word for their fellow Yugoslav? They were Hollywoodized, hard as nails and survival of the fittest will win. I left the hotel. I had blown it. This was an opportunity to land a major film role. I had taken the stupid ad, which I should have turned down, kept my beard. I should have taken a taxi to the hotel, and stayed calm. I was not short of money. Wrong decision after wrong decision.\n\nA week went by without hearing anything. Forlornly, I phoned my agents. I asked what had happened to the part that I was promised in Eleni? Maureen said that I could assume that I would not be in the film. I was given a Hollywood promise by Peter Yates. I was crushed. I went to my GP and I told him the story and he prescribed tranquilizers for my next auditions. I can honestly say that the Eleni debacle was the worst day in my professional career. Before long, I gave up on the tranquilizers. Peter Yates went for experience in the end. He cast Ronald Pickup as Spiro.\n\nI had no choice, but to get on with my life. There was The Misfit to get on. I was in touch with Chris Malcolm, and we were looking for a venue to stage the play. Playing cricket had been a pleasure since I was at junior school. Through my friend, Bob Ashby, I joined Brondesbury Cricket Club in NW2. It was a high standard, I was in between the 2nd and 3rd team. I read this book called Free Shakespeare by John Russell Brown, a Shakespeare scholar and a former advisor to Peter Hall, artistic director of the National Theatre. This book fired my imagination. It was very much about Shakespeare’s original company. It was a theatre without director´s interpretation, but with actor’s improvisational skill. Shakespeare’s actors only had their lines to learn. There was a performance of a different play every day. There were rehearsals, but they were very limited. I decided to put in a proposal to conduct a two week workshop to the Actors Centre, at that time in Covent Garden. I would choose scenes from Shakespeare, the actors would be given their lines only and on the second week of the workshop, they would perform the scene. This was a reaction to my time in the Royal Shakespeare Company, where the director´s interpretation was king. Surely, there was another way of performing Shakespeare?\n\nI did go into the dubbing studio to work with Bruce Beresford on re-voiceing part of my dialogue in King David. He seemed really upbeat about the film, but there were months of post-production to come. At the same time, Doe and I started looking for our own one-bedroom flat. We really liked the area of Primrose Hill. Prices of properties in London had not yet gone mad, and it was quite possible to live in an ultra fashionable area like Primrose Hill, quite affordably, as long as you were not looking for a whole house. It was just south, within twenty minutes walk of Belsize Park. It had a very attractive village, with restaurants, pubs, shops, coffee shops and a newsagent. Just at the end of the village, was Primrose Hill itself. A hill, it gave great views of downtown London, and beyond. Adjoining Primrose Hill, was Regents Park. So there were acres of parks just close by. We went to an estate agent in the village itself. There was advertised a one-bedroom flat just on King Henry’s Road, about two minutes walk away. Doe wanted to see it. We arranged a viewing. When we got there, Doe fell in love with it. It was originally a house that had been converted into flats. We saw a ground floor flat, with a spacious living room, the original. Behind the living room, was a small double bedroom, a bathroom down the corridor and a well-equipped kitchen overlooking a large garden and the railway line beyond that. The kitchen window was double glazed, so we couldn’t hear the trains. Doe was hopping with excitement, she wanted it. We put in an offer. The couple who lived there accepted. It was the shortest flat hunt of all time. We loved the first place that we saw. We now had to go to the bank and arrange a mortgage. It was all okay. Doe had a steady job at IPC, and I put 10% deposit down, from my King David money. We were all set. We would move in the 1st of next month.\n\nThat was over two weeks away. I was accepted by the Actors Centre to do the Shakespeare workshop next month. Jonathan Tafler, who was still living across the road, said that he would put his name down for the workshop. This was great, because we’d stayed in close touch since our RSC days. Just down the road, was another member of our company. His name was Jimmy Gardiner, small, the son of an infamous jockey, he was older, no one knew quite how old. He was in the RAF during the war and had been a tail gunner on bombers, a dangerous job. He smoked dope, played poker and badminton in his garden. I met future Academy Award winner, Mark Rylance there. Quite a character.\n\nWhile we were in the Belsize Park flat, I got a phone call from Julian Doyle, one of my on-going team mates at Bob Ashby´s five a side soccer group. Julian was a Jack of all trades, working in the film industry, particularly with the Monty Python team. He’d become rich on their films, which he´d been an associate producer and invaluable crew member on. He received a lot of residual money from the Python movies. Anyway, he was the film editor on Terry Gilliam´s about to be made film: Brazil. He said that they were looking for the lead in the film, Sam Lowry. Would I be interested in the part? They would need someone very physically inclined, because there would be a lot of special effects in the film. Of course, I was interested. Why did all these people choose me to try out for the lead in films? Thinking back to my drama school days, I played a crowd member in a third year production. A visiting head of another drama school, pointed me out, and said that I would be a star. I played a lot of leading parts at drama school. I had presence, they were developing me. The problem arose when I acted. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t. Over acting was enemy number one. I wish that I would finally land a leading part in a film. Julian asked me if I had any of my work on a video tape? I had one pop video, that my friend, Alexander Stuart had shot, with me as an Eastern Block soldier. King David was months away from release. I was stuck. The vast majority of my experience was in the theatre. The next Sunday, at the soccer, I handed Julian the tape. It wasn’t adequate at all for my body of work. I don’t know if Julian even showed Terry Gilliam the tape. I doubt it. Anyway, Julian was still keen. He arranged a meeting with Terry Gilliam the next week. I studied Jabberwocky, his past film, to familiarize myself with his work. It was absurdist, wacky, but real substance below the surface. It was a delightful film. He had done the cartoons in Monty Python and been in all the films. He was the only American in Monty Python. I met him at his office in Covent Garden the next week. It was a very pleasant meeting, lasting about 90 minutes. I told him all about my class that I was leading. I said that I’d been on a big film for the past few months. The film would be released next year. He told me about his film, I was able to refer to Jabberwocky, I think that I was very relaxed. I didn’t take any tranquilizers. Eventually, it was the same old story. He wanted someone taller and leaner than me. Julian Doyle himself told me, which I appreciated. That lack of a show reel really hurt me. It was a lesson learned the hard way. In the future, I’d be prepared. Jonathan Pryce did get the role. He’s taller and leaner than me. He is also a superb actor.\n\nWe didn’t move into our new flat straight away. We picked up the keys, went for lunch, to my favourite Indian restaurant on the Finchley Road, I adored Indian food. Doe and I walked down to our flat, about half an hour away. We let ourselves in, looked around, lay down on the brown carpet where the bed should be. Finally, we had our own property. We chatted for a long time. Every conversation with Doe, had an intellectual aspect. We would buy a double bed and move in the next day. We had a desk, a trunk, which we covered, and used as a sofa. We ate at the desk temporarily, because we wanted good furniture. My mum had phoned me, both my parents were planning a visit in the new year. We needed a really good sofa-bed to have them sleep on in the living room. They generously sent us a large sum of money to buy the best. After a week or two, we went to the top furniture store in town, on the Tottenham Court Road, and bought the best hand-made sofa-bed and an arm chair: Wesley Barrell. Doe bought a very nice table and chairs. Finally, she bought a Sony TV, we purchased some pots and pans, I had a VCR from our previous flat, and an answering machine. Our new place was complete. Before long, Doe received a big promotion, she had started on level 8 a few years back. She was now level 1. She was appointed deputy editor of Ideal Home magazine, the most successful home furnishing magazine in the country. She had a large salary, an expense account and occasional exotic trips to countries that wanted exposure in the magazine, which had a big readership.\n\nIt was time to take my class at the Actors Centre. I had a good turn out, 8 actors and actresses. It was the days before computers, I found out who was going to be there and I used a photocopier to copy all the scenes, then I would cut each actor’s lines on an individual script, so his scene partner wouldn’t know what he or she said. Cues were copied onto each set of lines, highlighted, otherwise we’d lose speed. It was quite painstaking, but I thought that we would discover a new way of acting Shakespeare. I explained the whole concept in the first class, and held a discussion about it. During the discussion, I was able to cast the scenes, so at the end, I was able to give each actor his or her set of lines. The following week, we performed the scenes. It was remarkable how fresh the scenes were. We discovered that Shakespeare’s players used a lot of improvisational skill. There was a lot of spontaneity and danger with this approach. For me, it explored a new fresh way of approaching Shakespeare. In later years, I would develop and change my view. The intricacies of the verse structure would be my later concern. I would also abandon the idea of director´s interpretation being a bad thing. Nevertheless it was a worthy experiment. Jonathan Tafler took part in it and enjoyed it. I even wrote to John Russell Brown and told him about the workshop. He replied and was encouraging.\n\nChris Malcolm and I had stayed in touch about the Montgomery Clift play, The Misfit. We managed to book the Old Red Lion pub theatre, just off Islington High Street, to stage the play in February of 1985. It was one of the best known pub theatres in London. The vast majority of fringe theatres in London were in public houses. There were exceptions, but they were out of the way, or too expensive to rent. Meanwhile, my agents had kept putting me up for film and TV jobs, about once a week. I’d taken tranquilizers for the first two or three, but they didn’t particularly help. They fuzzed up my head. I normally handled interviews and auditions well. The Eleni debacle was an aberration, born out of poor planning, the very awkward situation and the hot weather.\n\nThey put me up for a part in a TV film called Operation Julie, about a famous police drug bust in 1960´s Wales. I was trying out for one of the main drug dealers. I went to the casting place and the casting director said, just before I went to meet the director and producer, they are looking for a nasty person. I went in, exuding nastiness, and would you know, I got the part. The production would be done by Tyne Tees TV, up in Newcastle. I looked at the script and my character had some really good scenes, more substantial than I’d done before. By now it was November, the nights were long. I set off for Newcastle in my VW Beetle. The drive up there was okay. I got to the hotel and found out that one of my favourite actors, Colin Blakely, was also in it, playing the lead detective. The next night, I had a drink with him, in a small group. He looked unwell. Still, it was great to meet him. When I was a teenager, in 1969, I’d seen him in a TV play called Son of Man, by Dennis Potter, where he played Jesus Christ, in a very down to earth performance. He was rough, not in any way holy. It was for me, an extremely memorable performance. He was a member of the National Theatre for five years during its heyday, at the Old Vic. He did tons of film and TV work, was at the RSC, and a regular in the West End.\n\nWe started filming outside Newcastle. I didn’t have a huge amount of dialogue, but I did a lot, stashing drugs in my bedroom, being observed by the police, delivering drugs, outsmarting the police and finally, getting caught. I also worked with an actor who´d been at Derby Playhouse, which when I was a stage hand. I didn’t remind him. The days past fruitfully, director, Bob Mahoney, liked my work. It was simple. Sadly, Colin Blakely died two years later, of leukemia, at the peak of his career, aged only 56.\n\nI set out for London at night and almost fell asleep at the wheel. It is a long journey from Newcastle and I should have taken the train. Anyway, feeling lucky to be still alive, I pulled over on the hard shoulder, to have a rest. Before I know it, a bus also pulls over, and a number of men come out, to pee against the bank. Drunkenly, they checked to see if I have a female with me. How typically British!\n\nI got back to London, checked in with Chris Malcolm and the rest of the cast of The Misfit, whether they were available to start rehearsals in January? I was lucky, everyone was ready. There was not much going on in January. I phoned Norway and the actor playing Monty´s lover, would also come to London and stay with his brother. Most importantly, John Cassady was available for the part Monty Clift. He had been passing himself off as an American actor. He figured that he would pick up American roles in Europe and the UK. He borrowed a back story from Steve Barker, the American draft dodger that we had both worked with in Moving Being. He was from Burlington Iowa. He managed to get some work as an American actor, but he didn’t have to pretend with me or the rest of the cast. He could be his normal Geordie self. ( for you who don’t know, natives of the Newcastle area are known as Geordies). Jonathan Barlow, playing Marlon Brando, John Wayne and Kevin McCarthy, was a vital cog to the machine, given his great gift for mimicry, was also eager to do the show. He knew an older actor, who would play the John Huston, and the director role. Francesca Gonshaw ( Elizabeth Taylor) was keen. Barbara Kinghorn, who played Mira Rostova, the acting coach and mother, was also available. Janet Rawson, who was at my drama school, was good to play Gusta, Kevin´s wife. Every actor had a great American accent. In fact, I had my designer, a Frenchman, and a couple, who agreed to stage manage, a lighting designer. Chris Malcolm had touched up Richard O´Brien for money, and we were all set.\n\nI was going to spend Christmas, as I always did, with Doe´s family in Hereford. My own family were in either Yugoslavia or Canada, so Doe´s family, very kindly and generously gave me Christmas every year. Her mum, dad and sister lived in Hereford. Her parents in a council house, and Lydia, her younger sister, was married, and worked as a primary school teacher, was married to Phil Weaver, who worked for the government. I hit it off with Phil, who was passionate about soccer. We would go and see the team he supported, Hereford United. We went to Highbury, to see Arsenal, with the other Phil, Croskin, when they stayed with us in London. He was a good guitarist, playing in local bands with a number of rock musicians, who would be eventually named, The Pretenders, who apart from Chrissie Hynde, were all from Hereford. He was close friends with Pete Farndon, who high on heroin, passed out and drowned in his own bathtub. Another member, and friend overdosed. His friends couldn’t handle the fame and money that came to that band. We normally stayed at Phil and Lydia´s house, when we were in Hereford, but particularly Christmas Eve was spent, by Polish tradition, at the Czerny house, having a feast. Mrs Czerny was a very good cook, and the evening would be spent eating Polish delicacies like guomki, or sledge, pickled herrings. Doe´s mum and dad were interesting characters. Her mum had been a librarian before the war and was educated, spoke good English. Her father, a minor aristocrat, who´d been an officer in the Polish army, when Poland was overrun by the Nazis in 1939. He spent the whole war in a German prisoner of war camp. He had a good sense of humour, and also spoke good English. The first time that I met him, he was running the Polish club in Birmingham. He was a neat guy. I enjoyed seeing Doe and Lydia together, like a beautiful sister double act. Lydia was far calmer than Doe, less neurotic. Before I knew her, Doe took a great deal of LSD when she was at York University. It affected her deeply. She had to leave. With my help, and clean, she returned, got an honours degree. She was smarter than me, and like both her parents, she smoked. In Doe´s case, she was heavily addicted to tobacco. Menthol cigarettes, Consulate.\n\nIt was the first rehearsal of The Misfit. Everybody was there. The rehearsal room was cheap, in an old abandoned school, near the theatre, in Islington. Remember, we were all doing this for basically nothing. Chris Malcolm had rented the theatre, paid for the set and given money to the designer and lighting designer. My friend, Julian Bergin, would play a small part, and along with his girlfriend, would stage manage. The first read-through went well. Chris Malcolm was there, the producer. I got into the habit of picking up Barbara Kinghorn up every morning. She lived about 10 minutes drive from me. Almost immediately, there were problems. Neil Norman, the writer, had got it together with an actress, when were still in Belsize Park. They had the large living room all to themselves one night. Anyway, Neil wanted to replace his girlfriend for Francesca Gonshaw, in the part of Elizabeth Taylor. He basically said that Francesca was wooden, and not good enough for the part. I was reluctant, I was quite happy with her performance, and she could do good for the show later. She was very rich, coming from a property developing family. We had rehearsed in an unused West End theatre that her family had bought. She was petite, dark haired and beautiful. I would make her good in the part. It was my responsibility as director. Neil was adamant. After a long discussion, finally, I gave in to the person who´d written this great dialogue. The astonishing thing about this, was that Neil´s girlfriend and Francesca were friends! Forget Hollywood, this was an unpaid fringe play. Treachery arises, even among friends. A few days into rehearsal, I fired Francesca from the project. She was very feisty on the phone when I told her. Among other things, she called me an idiot. I was an idiot. It was my responsibility to ensure that she gave a good performance. I have never since, fired an actor. To this day, I regret it. Ironically, Francesca Gonshaw went on to work in television a lot, regular parts in hit series, like ´Allo ´Allo. Later, she helped to found Miramax Films. It was a low in my directing career. I shouldn’t have done it.\n\nWe waited four hours for Neil´s girlfriend to show up. The next rehearsal, she doesn’t show up at all. There were obviously games going on here. Neil Norman couldn’t explain it. He wasn’t there all the time. He had to go watch films and make a living. In desperation, we set up auditions for the part. It’s remarkable how many young actresses are willing to act for next to nothing. We saw a number, Chris and I. We did manage to get a good actress for the part, she was dark haired and looked a bit like Taylor, but she was tall. I’d always imagined Elizabeth Taylor as petite. But we had lost time with the cast change and we needed to make it up. There was a problem with the rehearsal room itself. There was no heating in the room. It was an abandoned school. It was January, and we having a cold snap. Rehearsals were uncomfortable, but we wore coats and hats and it went well. I had a good cast and they just got on with it. John Cassady handled being out of it very well. I thought that he was strong. Jonathan Barlow was brilliant as Brando, John Wayne and Kevin McCarthy, very funny. The two older actors were convincing. The freezing rehearsal room didn’t help.\n\nIt was almost time to go to the performance space. Eventually, we invited Chris Malcolm to see a run-through. He came, sat down and watched. It was a bitterly cold afternoon. You could see the breath coming out of the actors´mouths. It was a lousy run. The worst that I’d seen, in what had been months of workshops, and even an invited friends performance, of sections of the show, but that had been in warm halls. I had mentioned John lacking technique, my theory is that he didn’t train. Well, in this run, the bottom fell out of his performance. If you remember, this play had a Shakespearean construction. If the central character is not effective, the whole thing saggs. Every actor in this run, was well below par, even Jonathan Barlow. I’m sure that the freezing temperature had a big effect. Actors should not work in those conditions. I was so shocked, that I sat there motionless. I made a big directorial mistake that afternoon. I didn’t take any notes. I should have taken reams. At the end of it, in private, Chris threw the book at me and Neil. He said that what he’d seen was terrible. He wasn’t going to risk his name and his reputation as a producer, on this. He asked me why I didn’t take notes? I was silent. He said that a real director took notes on every run-through. I had to agree. He didn’t say that John Cassady was wrong for the part, but he essentially fired me as director of The Misfit. From now on, he would direct the play. At that point, I became a glorified stage manager on my own project. I would attend rehearsals, to see Chris Malcolm cutting the script and rearranging a scene or two. He also changed some of the blocking. This had a devastating effect on company morale. Particularly the older actors thought that I was leading them into a disaster. It was not at all good for the general atmosphere. After a couple of days rehearsal with Chris in the director´s seat, we moved into the Old Red Lion. It was a good space, and Yves, the French designer, came up with a good, but simple set. Chris Malcolm complained about the cost of it. I was seeing another side of him now. He had lost respect for me, completely.\n\nThe bookings for the show were excellent. All the previews and the first night were sold out. There was a lot of interest in Montgomery Clift. We had ads in Time Out and City Limits, we also had a really good poster, with a profile picture of Monty, in blue, all paid for by Chris Malcolm. During the previews, the show was received very well. The pub theatre was warm. The standard of the acting improved immeasurably. John Cassady was back to his best. Jonathan Barlow got lots of laughs with his Brando impersonation. The whole cast were good. Chris started to talk about transferring to the Warehouse Theatre. Then we had the first night. The audience were really receptive to the piece. I spotted pop star, Adam Ant in the audience. Then the reviews came out. They were particularly savage to John. One reviewer said that I may as well cast Dame Margaret Rutherford as Clift. London critics can be very hard. The plans for a transfer went down the pan. At least the show got good audiences for the whole run. Mind you, there are a 100 seats in the place, maximum. All the actors got some money. I took nothing. It was a sobering experience. I was angry, and during the run, I had a long phone conversation with one of my agents, Maureen Vincent. She had taken an interest in the show and had seen the friends invited audience workshop. She was incredibly sympathetic. She said that some of her clients played poker with Chris Malcolm. Apparently, he was a card shark and not to be trusted. When it was over, I had one more phone conversation with him. I said that he saw a very bad run, in freezing cold. I also said that I would never forgive him for taking the show from me. I never saw him again. Since then, I have directed countless productions. I always take copious notes at every run-through. I learnt a lesson, that cold afternoon.\n\nI was now on look out for work. I did manage to get the trauma of the last couple of months out of my system. I made a number of mistakes, firing Francesca Gonshaw, not taking notes at that dreadful run-through and perhaps the worst mistake, casting John Cassady as Monty Clift: at least according to the critics. I liked John’s performance. This isn’t the first time that a director has disagreed with the critics. The one thing that I am, is positive. I learned a lot from directing my first new, and full-length play. John Cassady was attractive to women, slim, charismatic, charming, but he didn’t have the patrician vulnerability and beauty of Montgomery Clift. I think of one of my favourite films: William Wyler´s, The Heiress. He was very much the rising star. The character´s overriding ambition, his sheer beauty, almost fools Olivia de Havilland, but she sees through it all at the end. Ralph Richardson was also masterful in the film. John Cassady had tremendous energy, but he was not a patrician and a beautiful man, that Monty was, before the car accident, that disfigured his face. John Cassady´s career just fizzled out after 1986. He’d been so brilliant as Lenny Bruce, star quality, I was convinced that it would translate to Clift, but Clift is an iconic figure, particularly in Britain.\n\nI was now 30, soon to be 31. There is a career trough at that age, and for the next few years. You’re too old for the juvenile leading parts and your acting career pauses. It’s not too bad if you are young looking, but I was slowly losing my hair. In some instances, that can help, particularly if you have to age, like I did in King David. But I looked my age, and for the next couple of months, it was slow. The Inland Revenue came after me in a big way, for my King David, Tunisia, commercial and Operation Julie earnings. I had to go to their offices, with my accountant, to plead my case. These things take time, but months down the road, they were very hard on me, as if they wanted to make an example of me. Eventually, I received a whopping tax demand. I had already spent most of the money, on the deposit for the flat, furniture, crockery, kitchen utensils, the bed, the car, the mortgage, not being paid for The Misfit, and living, London is an expensive city. I was down to my last few thousand. I didn’t have to pay the tax man for a long time.\n\nA bright two weeks would come up for me in the spring of 1985. My agent phoned and asked if I would direct Twelfth Night by Shakespeare and play Malvolio? The only catch was that it was a week’s rehearsal and a week-long performance, at the Pomegranate Theatre, Chesterfield. The majority of the cast would come from Fraser and Dunlop. That would make directing easier. There was a budget, so everyone would be paid the Equity rate. I would be paid a fee for directing. I thanked Maureen for giving me this opportunity. They believed in me. I had to call a character called Gordon Salkilld, the producer. I took a day or two to figure what I wanted to do with show. I didn’t know Twelfth Night at all. I had never seen the play and I had to familiarize myself with story. I went downtown to my bookshop and bought a cartoon book of the play. I had a copy of the play in my complete works. This was well before the Internet. I formulated a plan for the production: it would have no set, modern dress, as if the audience were attending a rehearsal. Of course, there was no chance of text work. I had to play a major role in it, and direct it, in a week, quite a task, in a play that I didn’t know. It reminded me of weekly rep, which they used to have in Britain years and years ago. Even then, I doubt if they did Shakespeare’s plays, preferring one set pot-boilers.\n\nI phoned Gordon Salkilld and told him my plans. He was delighted, he wouldn’t have to pay for a set or costumes. I was very idealistic, still in the Free Shakespeare mode. Bare the play to its essentials, the genius of Shakespeare would come out. Quite naive really. Most of the cast were provided by the agency, but I still had a half a dozen or so to cast myself. I held interviews in our living room at home. By now the furniture was all there. Purposely, I didn’t agonize over casting. I cast Antonio from his photo, and on the strength that he could do acrobatics. His agent was surprised when I offered him the part without seeing him. I cast an overtly gay actor as Aguecheek, Terry Madely. A fat, but funny actor as Belch. My best bit of casting was to put a real comedian, Nick Revell, in the part of Feste.\n\nRehearsals began in London. The actors provided by the agency, were a cut above. I didn’t have to do text work, Viola, Orsino, Olivia, Maria and Sebastian all spoke the verse very well, particularly Viola. Rehearsal went well. I managed to be in, and direct without too much difficulty. I would not recommend it. I did it twice more. Everyone was so panicky about getting their parts down, it was quite simply, looking after yourself. I rarely appeared in productions that I directed. Directing itself is hard enough to pull off, without vanity coming into it. I was encouraged by the clowns. They were funny. Aguecheek was camp but inventive, especially when he butched-up in Olivia´s presence. Nick Revell, as Feste, was funny as a priest, condemning my character to madness. Sir Toby Belch and Maria, were mischievous, as they played a wicked prank on the stuck-up steward, Malvolio. The actress playing Viola, handled the gender switch to Olivia´s servant, Cesario, very well. Olivia falls in love with him, putting aside her vow of chastity. Of course, in Shakespeare’s day, Viola would have been played by a boy, so the sex switch would’ve been that much more effective and believable. I’m convinced that Shakespeare wrote for the here and now. He didn’t think about his legacy. He was a producer, intent to make money and, in time, gentrification, was his immediate aim. It was up to two of his company members and friends, Heminges and Condell, after his death, but who collected the plays and published the First Folio. We owe them a lot.\n\nWe all went to Chesterfield. I drove up in my VW Beetle. I found my digs and went to the theatre. I started to, with the technician, to create my “set.” I had to have walkway from one side of the stage to the other. I put flats, back to front, along the back of the stage. That was it. There would be chairs onstage during the performance. It was a bare stage. We were to do eight performances, including two school matinees. The show itself was in surprisingly good shape. The cast worked very hard. The show opened to not bad audiences. The reviews came out the next day. One reviewer complained that it would be a really great production, if it had a set and costumes! I got good reviews for my performance. ” You could see that he had been with the Royal Shakespeare Company, with the quality of his performance.” One of my agents, Ruth, came up from London and was very positive about it. My good friend, Robert Ashby, saw it and said that the production was better than the current Shakespeare production at the nearby Sheffield Crucible theatre. There was a memorable moment from comedian Nick Revell during one of the school matinees. The school kids were a bit rowdy, so Nick said, ” is this your first time out in long trousers?” It was a great ad-lib, and entirely in line with what Shakespeare’s comics what have said off the cuff. A terrific piece of acting. I spoke with producer, Gordon Salkilld, he enjoyed the show. I don’t know whether the reason was because he had saved money. The show got better as it went on. I was not fully developed as a director. Not having a set was a mistake, although it took years to think it all through. The week finished and I went back to Doe and Primrose Hill. A sad footnote, is that Terry Madely, who was funny and inventive as Sir Andrew Aguecheek, died of AIDS 3 years later.\n\nI went to back to London, and nothing. As I said, I was at a difficult age. My agents were practically silent. I drove down to my health club, read, did the cooking, tidied up the flat, and basically was the housewife. I was running out of money fast, and had the prospect of a huge tax bill. I didn’t want to sign on, so with Doe´s encouragement, I took a job. It was selling advertising space in theatre programs. At least it was theatre related. It was for a company called Stillwell Darby. As usual, with these Joe-jobs, it was commission only. You had to sell the advertising space, get the artwork and money from the client, before getting paid yourself. It was one step away from slavery. I am a good salesman, and I had to convince companies to meet with me at their place of business, then I would pitch them. This involved driving to Cambridge or Peterborough, at my expense. The good thing was that it was flexible. I would go to the office, in the Paddington area, park outside, spend a few hours phoning, using their local yellow pages. It was demoralizing being the umpteenth person to call that day. Some people would be rude at the other end of the phone. I consoled myself by driving to have a good workout at the end of it. I would drive out of town and make enough money to survive. I was a good salesman.\n\nThis went on for months. I did do a commercial, I had to age from young to old, to show how long the company had been in business. It was shown a fair amount, so I did make money on repeats. King David had a big release in the USA, and flopped. At least the video tape would be out before too long, for show-reel purposes. I played a lot of cricket. Doe and I sent money to Live-Aid, which happened in July. My parents came during the summer. I had money from my commercial, so I took time off and hosted my folks, during their stay. We did touristic things, like go shopping on Oxford Street. There was a royal occasion, which found the four of us in front of Buckingham Palace, while the Queen Elizabeth and her family, came out on the balcony, for us all to see. Being monarchists, of the Yugoslav ilk, mum and dad enjoyed that. I first got the impression that they were aging, when they tired, halfway through Regents Park. They really enjoyed fish and chips from the chip shop in the village. The sofa-bed in the living room, worked well, although mum had to open the window, to let out Doe´s cigarette smoke. As I drove them back to the airport, mum remarked how well I knew the shortcuts of London. In the city, it was a necessity.\n\nSummer turned into winter, and I was still at Stillwell Darby. Operation Julie was broadcast. I carefully recorded it on high quality video tape. They did give me a refurbished theatre, the Bradford Alhambra, to sell the program. They even let me drive the company car up to Bradford. I would often hit 100 mph on my way there and back. I stayed in a cheap hotel, that smelled of boiled cabbage. That night, I could hear the Academy Awards on a TV somewhere. It was another low point. I seemed miles away from work. I did make some money over two trips to Bradford. The second time, my friend, Julian Bergin came with me. He also tried his luck with Stillwell Darby. Apart from making good money, I discovered a fabulous Indian restaurant. It was very simple, but had delicious food. I took Julian there.\n\nAt last, I was saved. I was offered a theatre job. It was the early spring of 1986. I met a director called Nigel Bryant, who knew my work at Derby Playhouse, where he´d been an assistant director. It was for Orchard Theatre, a touring company, based in Devon. It was a fascinating part: Queequeg, in a dramatized version of Melville´s great novel, Moby-Dick. He was a South Sea islander and a former cannibal. This was a very challenging role. I had seen a very good production of the same play at the Victoria Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent, while at drama school. Queequeg was a real presence in that show, with his tattoos, outlandish religious beliefs, his immense skill as a harpooneer. Finally, there were his relationships with Ishmael, the narrator, Captain Ahab, and the rest of the crew of the whaling ship, Pequad, in 1850, out of Nantucket, in pre-civil war America. I went to the library. There was a lot of research to do.\n\nThe cast were to meet in a pub, outside Barnstable, in the north part of Devon. I drove west, in my trusty VW Beetle. When I got there, had a drink with the cast, and met Nigel again, who I knew quite well, plus I met the other members of the cast. All men, they all seemed like a good group. We were lodged in a nice farm house just outside the town. Rehearsals went well. In the evenings, the cast would play Film Trivial Pursuit. One actor had an encyclopedic knowledge of film. Previously, he had his own theatre company, Incubus, but had fallen on hard times. He was called Paddy Fletcher, and later, he would become something of a nemesis. Because the character was far removed from myself, I found a kind of freedom. I had to make stuff up, particularly with his worship of his runes and idols. I had to be brave and committed with this jibberish. The Internet would have helped, but it was years away. Rehearsals went smoothly. I did visit a fellow actress from the Studio Company in Derby. Sally Hedges was now married to Nigel Bryant, and lived in Barnstable. We had tea and had a good chat. One Saturday, I went to the local pub and had two pints of skrumpy, (apple cider, very strong.) I had never been so drunk. I went to the bathroom next my room, was sick.\n\nWe opened the show, it took a long time to draw tattoos on my face, or on exposed flesh. I immediately felt unhappy. My big moment in the play, is when Queequeg consults his runes and they tell him that he will die. He makes a coffin, lies in it ceremoniously, and then changes his mind, rises up out of the coffin. This, in the Stoke-on-Trent production, got the biggest laugh of the night. Paddy Fletcher, as a crew member, had the next line, which he would say straight away, preventing me from getting the laugh. This, in my view, was unforgivable. You are supposed to give to your fellow actor. What about artistic generosity? I did talk to him about it, but continued doing it, I have to think that it was out of spite. By now, I knew that he was a hard line alcoholic.\n\nDuring rehearsals, I was made aware that on tour, we’d be expected to share a room. I drew a line at this. Moving Being, my previous experience of touring, we had our own rooms. I had been spoiled by the film and TV jobs that I’d done. I hated the idea of sharing a room with another actor for the whole tour. I could be roomed with Paddy Fletcher. We were paid a touring allowance, which would easily pay for me to do the rounds of bed and breakfasts in the West Country. I then found a book called, The Best Bed and Breakfasts in the World. This would be my bible, as I drove, in my VW Beetle, around the beautiful West Country in the early summer. The Beetle was tough, but would it last the tour? As soon as I started staying in the bed and breakfasts in the book, it didn’t take me long to discover that they were indeed, the best. Superb bedrooms and breakfasts, often from the farm, it was a pleasure staying in these places. Plus, the sheer beauty of the region, never far from the sea, fishing villages and history. I really enjoyed finding these obscure places. We would often do one-night-stands.\n\nThe reviewers came from every small town or village that we played. Even though I was doing most of my part on the fly, I got terrific reviews. It just goes to show that if you’re committed and brave in your choices, you can succeed. The show generally received good, positive reviews. The tour went on. I became friendly with the other actor who wasn’t staying with the rest of the company. He was really trying to save money, by driving in a large van, where he slept. Andrew Jolly, who was very good as crew member, Starbuck. We met for coffee quite often, and we would moan about the company, Paddy Fletcher in particular.\n\nWe did a dress rehearsal in one venue. I don’t remember why, but I had developed a theatrical, risky way of throwing my harpoon, after all, Queequeg was an expert. The harpoon would be thrown high, I would make a throwing gesture, and catch the real harpoon, low down. I miss-timed the stunt this time, and the backward spike of the harpoon spear, went actually through my right hand. Immediately, the rehearsal stopped, and I was rushed to hospital. I was extremely lucky, the spike had gone through the fleshy, upper part of the hand. It did go right through, so I would need separate stitches on both sides of my right hand. A couple of inches higher, I could have easily lost a couple of fingers. I was a strange sight in the nearest country hospital, with tattoos all over my face and 19th century costume. It was lucky that this small country hospital was not too far away, because we played in some very remote places. The doctor put a large number of stitches on both sides of my right hand. I could leave the hospital then. I must say, that this doctor did a tremendous job of stitching my hand up. I was able to perform that night, although the throwing routine was made safer, and I wore a leather half glove, to cover my stitches. I became angry with the company. Why didn’t they hire a fight director? Because they were too cheap. The next town that we were in, I went to a professional photographer and he took photos of the hand. I would go to British Actors Equity Association, in London, to tell them about it. The tour went on.\n\nOne evening, my agents, enterprisingly, phoned me just before I was to perform. Could I get to the agency offices the next day to meet Jack Gold, to interview for a big TV film called Escape from Sobibor? The relevant thing about this job, was that it was to be shot in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Of course, Serbian was my first language. I only spoke to my mum and dad in Serbian. Jack Gold was one of the leading TV directors in the country, with a huge body of work behind him, like The Naked Civil Servant. I had to drive from the West Country to central London for the interview, and back to Dartmoor, all in the same day. I set off early and managed to get to my agents office in good time. My meeting with Jack Gold went very well indeed. We hit it off. Naturally, I said that I spoke fluent Serbo-Croat. I learned that the film was about the only mass escape from a Nazi death camp, in World War 2. I looked Jewish, so that was in my favour.\n\nI set off for Dartmoor in good time. I was about 50 miles away from the venue, when I overtook a truck, suddenly I heard a loud bang from the engine. The car lost power completely and I managed to steer it onto the hard shoulder. I don’t know much about cars, but the big end went on mine. Just my luck, something like this to happen! I walked to the phone booth, which in those days were on every motorway. I got through to a garage, who came and towed the VW Beetle and me to their garage. It was now getting late, so I tried to phone the venue, where the curtain would be going up, sooner than I would like. I phoned directory enquiries, and would you believe, this village hall was not on the phone! I was in despair. One of the mechanics took the VW off my hands. I hired a taxi to take me to the middle of Dartmoor. Finally, the taxi arrived and we set off. The taxi driver refused to speed. It took absolute ages to get there. The show starting time came and went. To say that I was frustrated, would be a gross understatement. There were curvy slow roads on Dartmoor. At last, we got there, 40 minutes late. I paid a lot of money for the taxi fare. Rushing into the dressing room, I found the director, Nigel Bryant, dressed in my costume, with an approximation of my make-up on his face. He was livid. He said, ” this is outrageous!” I explained that the venue wasn’t on the phone. I slapped my make-up on very quickly, got into my costume, and went on stage, 45 minutes late. The house was packed. The show went very well. I had to travel in the next venue with the company. I shared a room for the last week of the tour.\n\nA couple of days later, my agent phoned the theatre. I was offered a part in Escape from Sobibor. Also, the film company would pay me more for assisting the director. There were a lot of Yugoslav actors on the film. I would coach them with their English lines. The great thing was, with the two salaries, I’d make as much as King David. But most of it would go to the taxman. I was absolutely delighted. I was to spend 10 weeks in my parents´ birth place. I could see my sister, my uncle and family members.\n\nI spent the next week in London. As soon as I was booked for the film, I went on a diet. Although I was playing a Jewish carpenter, who was kept alive because he had a useful skill. The people in a death camp were not well fed at all. I looked at the script, it was exceptional, and Morris, my character, did have three really good scenes. I was also around a lot, stepping on a mine at the escape. On the script, was a note from the director, that we should all read a book, giving a personal account of a highly educated man, surviving a concentration camp. I did have a costume fitting. Also, I did make a point of going to the Equity offices where I had a long meeting with someone in the legal department. I said that I would return when I got back from location. He thought that I had a really good case against Orchard Theatre. I showed him the photos of my stitched hand. It could have been much worse. The scars were readily visible on both sides of my right hand. I was angry. They should have hired a fight director for one day.\n\nMy Serbian was a bit rusty, so I went to my bookshop and bought the first hand account of one person’s survival in a death camp, also a Serbian phrase book. I rarely spoke the language. My parents had left England 11 years ago. They came back for 6 months in 1980, I saw them in both Macedonia and Canada, they visited London last year. Still, the phrase book jogged my memory. It was nice to see Doe. She planned to come to Belgrade.\n\nUsing public transport, I even got in a game of 5-a-side soccer. I had a drink with my mates after the game. Phil Croskin had joined the group some years before and it was always good to see him. 4 years earlier, we were in Spain, for the World Cup. I did manage to see the odd England game, in the lounges of the B and B´s. A lot of games were missed. At least I had a paid acting job. I told him that I was off to Yugoslavia, this week.\n\nA few days later, I flew to Belgrade, business class. It felt great to be on a big film project again. We arrived in Belgrade. Although I was born in Derby, I felt a special affinity to this country. My ancestors had lived in this region for generation after generation. Not only that, but I could understand what everybody said. I was brought up, truly bilingual. I was picked up by a driver, who displayed my name, and I was driven to the hotel. I chatted to him in Serbian, on the way. It was the Intercontinental, the best hotel in the city. I checked in at reception, went to my room. My room was high up, I could see birds migrating in the sky. Facing me was the car park, beyond, downtown Belgrade. I checked out my bathroom, mini bar, bed and TV. Everything was great, I could get used to luxurious living, quickly. I unpacked and went down to the lobby, to see if I could find someone from the production. I soon found a production assistant, who gave me a large number of dinars, my per dium. He gave me my call, it was early the next morning. I went back to my room, because I was trying to not eat. I phoned for an early wake up call. The receptionist was mildly amused by my accent, which was at worst, British, at best, Slovenian, which was still part of Yugoslavia then. They didn’t hear too many accents.\n\nThe next morning, early, I was picked up by a minibus, outside the main entrance. With me, was a young English actor who was called Simon. He looked green, and didn’t talk much. Along with us, was a seemingly reluctant, German actor, from West Germany, and we set out for the set. We would drive about 40 kilometers out from Belgrade, to a large forest, Lipovicka Suma. I spoke to the German actor on the way. He was called Hartmut, and spoke good English. We got to our destination. There was a very impressive death camp, right there, in the forest. A large number of nissan huts, barbed wire surrounding the camp, a parade ground, German officers quarters, workshops, gas chambers, ovens, I would later discover a train station, a short walk from the camp. It must have cost a lot of money to build this. Yugoslavia was undergoing economic difficulties at that time, so labour was obviously cheap.\n\nThe camera crew then began to shoot establishing shots. I was observing, suddenly, I felt extremely excited. The whole film making process would be witnessed by me, as dialogue director, from the inside. This was an amazing learning opportunity. Jack Gold showed up and I then had to translate for him, as he spoke to extras. I was used to this, because I’d translated for my mother, who didn’t speak English, from an early age. With short phrases, I was comfortable. I said that my Serbian was a bit rusty, well, I had to translate a full and long statement from the Germans, for a crowd of extras, simultaneously. As I attempted it, a few of them suppressed smiles, which was completely in contrast to their situation, they were facing death. My dad spoke perfect Serbian. He was a proud Serb, the same could not be said about my mum. She was born and raised in Macedonia. There are considerable differences between the Macedonian and Serbian languages. My mum was an intelligent and able woman, but she was not a language person. She never learned Serbian completely, even though she lived in Serbia for 12 years. She would mix in a bit of Macedonian. I learned the language from her in my early years. Dad was always at work. I did, under stress, go back to mother-speak. Hence the muffled laughs at my Serbian, mixed in with a bit of Macedonian. My auntie Vera, my mum’s youngest sister, used to joke that I spoke Serbo-Kratovski, Kratovo, being the small town where mum was born and grew up as a child. It has a dialect.\n\nThen a real steam train, with carriages, rolled into the station. It was time for me to work my first Yugoslav actress. This is what I did well. I worked with her on her English lines. She was to give a tip to someone who took her luggage. It really was remarkable how people were totally unaware of their immediate fate. She spoke some English, but I honed her text and she was good. A bunch of extras piled into the train carriages, along with the actress. I went behind the camera to hear her. It went well, she spoke well. Jack was happy. Coordinating the extras, was Milan, the first assistant director. He had lived in Australia, so he spoke good English. Where he helped me, was in his instructions to everyone, through a megaphone and without, in perfect Serbian. I used him to brush up on my own Serbian. He was articulate, highly educated. Most of the Serbian community in Derby, were villagers, with little education.\n\nThere then followed harrowing scenes, where families were separated, some to survive, others to die. Simon Gregor, the young actor, had a scene. The same train arrived, and mass of people got off. Hartmut was there, along with the German commanding officer. Both actors wore German uniforms. People were separated on the platform. Simon´s character gets picked out by the Germans. He’s a tradesmen, he will be spared, for now. There was a tearful scene, as he says goodbye to his mother and father. The crowd behind them, prompted by Milan, in Serbian, realize their fate, and erupt. Suddenly, without reason, Simon immediately stopped the scene, refusing to go on. The crowd reaction threw him. Jack went ballistic at him. ” Never ever step out of character! I want you dealing with the crowd in the scene! That would have been truthful, real, as your character. Never, ever, do that again! Your job is to react to the crowd, and use that. You play the scene regardless. Always, always, incorporate the situation into your acting of the scene. Carry on, at all costs, until I say cut!” Right there, I had Jack Gold´s philosophy as a director: spontaneity, truth and reality, at all costs. Shortly after, we finally shot the scene. My first day on Escape from Sobibor would end.\n\nWeeks of the shoot went by. I was on set, every single day. It was hard, emotional, but very satisfying work. My Serbian was getting markedly better every day. I loved working with the Yugoslav actors. I was suited to coaching. I had a talent for it. My relationship with Jack Gold was closer than any film director I’d worked with. I translated for him, particularly when he spoke to the Yugoslav actors. I sat in the sauna with him, we occasionally went out to dinner with, an attractive young actress called Judith Sharp. She had been to Cambridge University with my friend, Jonathan Tafler. We would later become friends. Jack made the cast see his favourite comedy: The Producers. It was a film dear to me as well. No wonder we got on. One of my favourite American actors, Alan Arkin, was playing the leader of the escape committee. I would have two of my scenes with him. One of the other star names, was Rutger Hauer. He had tremendous presence, your eyes immediately went to him, in a group. He was quite friendly, asking me to coach him if I heard something odd in his pronunciation of English. He was Dutch. I did give him the occasional note, which he accepted. He had a very novel living arrangement: a huge truck, which had a custom-built, luxury apartment in the trailer. He drove the whole thing himself. The reaction of the Yugoslav actors, when they saw that, was funny and bemused at the same time. He played a Russian officer, part of a number of Russians, that were also prisoners. They would play a role in the escape. The other name, was Polish actress, Joanna Pacula. Quite frankly, I found her snobby and self absorbed. She didn’t say a word to me, the whole time that she was there.\n\nA group of us would go to the Writer’s Club, which served very good Serbian food, which reminded me of my mum’s cooking. We also went to a night club, owned by Peter Barota, the former Chelsea goalkeeper. He spoke good English and owned a number of businesses. I also became friends with a Dutch actor, based in Landon, called Hugo Bower. He disliked the German actors, with whom he was playing a sergeant. Belgrade had a very lively night life, which we all enjoyed in the evenings. The main theatres had extremely nice cafes, which stayed open till the early hours. My big regret was that it was summer, meaning that the city’s numerous theatres were not performing. I would love to have seen a lot of theatre in the season. Yugoslav actors were considered artists in that country, and highly respected. Perhaps that’s why my parents didn’t object at all, when I became an actor. Mind you, they were relieved when I started to earn a living at it. My parents didn’t have money, so I had to be financially independent from an early age. They could not certainly support me through drama school. Thank goodness for the Welfare State. I digress, there were some leading Belgrade actors in the film. I became friendly with one of the best actors in the city, Irfan Mensur, of a Bosnian Muslim background. When Doe came to Belgrade, the three of us would go to the old town restaurant district: Skadarlija. He spoke reasonable English, so he was able to communicate with Doe. In fact, she behaved well during her visit. We also went out with Hugo Bower, who we would see in London, when filming finished. On my days off, Doe and I would explore Belgrade. The most romantic place in the city was Kelemegdan Fortress, an old fortress, where the Sava and Danube Rivers meet. It is a fascinating place, with a park and a military museum. We spent hours there. Then we went people watching at the main street, Knez Mihailova. We sat in cafes, shopped, our per diums were very generous, we could take taxis everywhere. It was not encouraged by the film company, to reveal what we were being paid. There was quite a disparity pay-wise, with our Yugoslav colleagues.\n\nNow, a bus would pick us up, to take us to the set. There were a fair number of Yugoslav actors and actresses on the film, we needed a bus. I was shocked at the rate of traffic accidents that we’d see on the way to the forest. The Yugoslavs were rather cavalier when they drove, never wearing seat belts. Still, it was good to do some coaching on the bus. There was one very old actor, who everyone showed great respect to. His name was Svetolik Nikacevic. He was born in the old Ottoman Empire. He didn’t speak English at all, plus he had some text. He spoke beautiful Serbian though, that I had rarely heard in the Serbian community in Derby. He also had a sly, self-deprecating sense of humour, saying that the meter was ticking, when we went into overtime. In Serbian, there’s two ways of saying “you”: familiar, and showing respect. Of course, I went along with everyone else, and showed him respect. I worked hard with him, and in the end, it paid off. None of the actors that I worked with, had to be dubbed in post-production. The American executive producer, Martin Starger, would praise my work with the Yugoslav actors, more than once. He said that it was remarkable how many of their voices they would keep. The English production supervisor, Clive Reed, also said that I was doing a good job. I felt very involved in the production and not least, when I donned my costume, playing Morris, the carpenter. I arrived at the camp, a traumatic experience. I was present a lot, to see other actors doing their stuff. There were artists that I admired, like Patti Love, who was terrific. Then there was Jack Shepherd, who’s work I thought extraordinary, at the Cottesloe studio theatre at the National Theatre, when I was there. I’d also played soccer with him, in the big crunch match, between the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, on a pitch at Hyde Park. Mark Rylance had his fan club in attendance. There were no rivals, for my claim to be the best actor footballer. Emil Wolk, I had seen with some of best experimental theatre companies. One weekend, he hired a boat and musicians, and we all went for a cruise down the river, with music playing. Then there’d be an extreme method actor, like Sarah Sugarman, going to extraordinary lengths, to get “in” the moment.\n\nDoe enjoyed her stay in Belgrade. She brought a few big packs of duty-free Consulate menthol cigarettes with her, so she could have her 40 a day tobacco fix every day. We went, by taxi, out to dinner every night. Thankfully, she didn’t get drunk and embarrass me. As I mentioned, we explored Belgrade. She spent a day on the set, we went out with my new-found friends, even going to Peter´s night club. Doe did like being abroad, and particularly staying in luxury hotels. She would go to the pool and potter around when I was at work. She had a magazine allowance, as part of her job, so she brought them to the hotel, and read them a good deal. Days before she went back to London, I got really bad food poisoning. I said that Yugoslavs were rather cavalier about driving, well they had a similar attitude towards hygiene. Every morning, before getting the bus to set, and on days off, the Intercontinental laid on a breakfast buffet. It had all kinds of fruit, juice, coffee, eggs, etc. The way those foods were handled, left something to be desired. One morning, as we were relaxing, it suddenly hit me. I immediately had to go to the bathroom. It got so bad, that a doctor had to be summoned. I’ll never forget that he used the term ” liquid” in Serbian. That just about sums up my state. Let’s just say that I spent a lot of time on the toilet. He gave me some pills. It was on my days off, so luckily, I didn’t miss filming. I was really committed to this project. Doe did fly back to London a couple of days later. The stomach bug would go away, I plunged into work.\n\nOver the next number of weeks, my social life would, sometimes, involve dating women, to various degrees of romance. I didn’t go to bed with any of them, except with one. This would happen on my next trip to Yugoslavia, but that’s a different story. To this day, I honestly don’t know why I did it. Doe loved me very much, and was completely faithful. I was restless. It was just the way it happened, born out of the harsh fact, that I couldn’t feel a sense of loyalty to Doe. She did put me down, using sarcasm and embarrassing me on occasion: in my mind, masculine characteristics, a turn-off, yet, at times, she could be sweet, intellectually stimulating, company. She endearingly loved animals. Was there too much Jekyll and Hyde going on here? Maybe it was because I was not attracted to her when we first met, in Cardiff. I was sharing a house with her boyfriend in 1976. He was a very bright, Welsh speaking medical student at the time. She was at a lose end, and would frequently stay with him. They came to see me in the Moving Being shows that I was in. When David was away, she suggested that we go for a walk, around an unglamorous area called Splott, where our house was. Around those ugly streets, near the railway track, she seduced me. She was so smart, and at the same time petite, and in her own way, beautiful. It didn’t take long for me to fall under her spell. She wanted me and she got me. Quite masculine really, in my mind. She split up with David, he moved out. Free now to be together, we hitchhiked up to my house in Derby. Every car or truck, stopped. Everyone wanted to give her a lift. We had a passionate stay in my folks ´ house. We even went on holiday to Gibraltar, of all places. She looked beautiful there. We were in love. Inevitably, she would come to live with me in Derby, when I was at the Playhouse. I’d been with her, lived with her, for the past 10 years. During that time, I quickly discovered that she was a bit of a slob, smoking endlessly. She also didn’t like actors, except me. She warmed to them, eventually, but still wary. Our friends were in other professions. She didn’t get on with one of my best friends at the time, Phil Croskin. We also had heated arguments, particularly after my affair at the RSC, where she would physically attack me, which I hated. But we would always make it up. This violence, made me uneasy, a real turn-off for me. Possibly I had a secret, resentment of her? I never proposed to her, never crossing my mind. I did love her, perhaps I was too immature, to live with her at 22?\n\nThe filming went on. I established relationships with the two English sound operators. I would check with them pretty regularly about the understandability of the Yugoslav actors. I spoke every day, with the continuity woman, Cheryl Leigh. She would much later, become a friend. I also worked with two young actors, Eli and Jason. Eli was very inexperienced, so I thought that he needed a lot of work. I did go a bit heavy with him, making him stress keywords. This backfired on me, because Jack Gold actually questioned Eli´s line readings. Luckily, he didn’t mention my name. I learned a valuable coaching and directing lesson then: never give actors line readings.\n\nI also coached a couple of German actors, who didn’t speak great English. Both were very impressive characters. I knew of Kurt Raab. He´d been a major collaborator with Rainer Werner Fassbinder, the well known underground German filmmaker, who had a controversial and subversive reputation. Kurt was a brilliant actor. He asked if I could coach him. He was obviously very experienced, really knowing what he was doing. I coached him in some officer scenes, then we had a scene together as actors, where his character comes into my carpenter’s shop, suspicious about an escape plot. What was very interesting, was that he asked for coaching on every single line that he said. It was odd playing a substantial scene with your fellow actor asking me for advice after every take. Jack Gold didn’t mind at all. It created an interesting dynamic for the scene. As I got to know Kurt, he did ask me if there were any gay clubs in Belgrade? Of course, he was an openly gay man. I certainly hadn’t heard of such a place in a fiercely anti-gay society. After all, they were Slavs. I went to the wardrobe guy, to ask his advice. He seemed to know what he was talking about, when he said that there were no such clubs in Belgrade, saying that there were no places that gay people could gather in the whole country. He did say that there was activity in the vicinity of the ballet theatre, but of course, the theatre season did not start up until the autumn. When I told Kurt, he was not pleased. I then knew that Yugoslavia was a backward country. The gay and transsexual people in Yugoslavia, must have had a really hard, victimized, time. Tragically, Kurt Raab died of AIDS in Germany, a mere two years later. Europe lost a great talent. He was only 46.\n\nThe other actor who sought my help, was a fine actor called Wolfgang Bathke. He told me that actors in West Germany, were guaranteed work. The trick is to be accepted by a drama school, which was fiendishly difficult. Every town and city had many arts activities. The arts were highly subsidized. He was very good in the film, as a brutish murderer, in contrast, he was a really nice guy. He told me that Hartmut Becker, the German actor who I traveled with on the first morning, refused to get into a minibus, he thought that he was worthy of a car. Status, or perceived status, in the film world is weird. I remember on King David, Richard Gere´s girlfriend, yes, girlfriend, demanded a car to meet her at the bottom of the aircraft steps.\n\nIt was time for me to act in the film. Most of my scenes would look good on my show-reel, particularly those with Alan Arkin. I had an escape committee scene with him, in which he shoots my idea down in flames. It went very well. Then, I had a scene just with him. I didn’t get friendly with him, but he was down to earth and unassuming. He wore a toupee in the film, but didn’t bother to wear it off-camera. I liked him, he was friendly enough. When we had our scene, just the two of us, he insisted on directing me between every take. I don’t know if he thought that I wasn’t up to scratch as an actor? Anyway, he did it. Jack Gold let him do it. When I finally saw the scene, it was very good, so he had a positive impact on my performance. It was curious though.\n\nAfter most of my scenes, Jack Gold came up to me and said, ” you’re an actor, not a crew member!” He particularly emphasized the word ” actor”. Was this a compliment? I didn’t know. The fact of the matter, is that in later years, I would earn an awfully large amount of money from coaching. As a Jewish man, I thought that Jack Gold´s behavior was at all times, very professional, dealing with such a harrowing subject for the Jewish people. However, he did get emotional and lose it, once. There was a pile of children’s toys in one of the scenes to be shot. This was too much for him. He broke down. Through his tears, he demanded more and more toys. The prop guys rushed off and got him more toys. It was the only time he lost it. I have studied Hitler. I had read Albert Speer long before filming began. He was in Hitler´s inner circle. He denied knowledge of the Holocaust, which scholars have since proved wrong. Adolf Hitler was the reason that I was English. For me, it would be impossible to kill one man, let alone over 6 million. The order for the Holocaust must have come from Hitler´s lips. What a monstrous, evil, totally deluded, racist, bigoted and dangerous man. I wish that he was killed in the First World War. It would have saved millions and millions of lives. 17 years later, I did further research on Hitler, in preparation for a CBS film, where I coached the actor playing Hitler. There were a number of Jewish actors on the film. Jack cast the film expertly. One day, they hunted down one of the few synagogues in Belgrade. They were very proud of the fact that, along with a scattering of people already there, they formed a quorum: a minimum of 10, to be able to worship. On the film set, were a number of honoured guests: survivors and escapees of Sobibor itself. They had settled for the most part in the United States, so they could all speak English. They told incredible stories about their life in the camp, and ultimately, their escape. They become increasingly valuable as technical advisors. I will never forget the reaction of an older male survivor, to the staging of the escape. People just had a mass fleeing from this dreadful place. I stepped on a mine during this. The survivor was actually discovered in the forest, outside of our Sobibor, running, hell for leather away. When I saw him soon after, he was bruised and bloody, from his own escape. This escape part of the film obviously connected to him deeply. His escape was the major event of his life. This was emotional recall, metastasized into present day reality. He was traumatized by something that happened 43 years earlier. They had problems finding people to extra, in the nude, lining up for a ” showers”, in other words, the gas chambers. They had to round up the city’s prostitutes and extremely poor males, of which there were plenty in Belgrade.\n\nI will now tell you about my philandering, and seeing my family. By this point in the shoot, well after Doe had flown back to London, my Serbian was pretty good. All the following encounters were exclusively in the Serbian language. I doubt whether the people involved, spoke even a word of English.\n\nI was relaxing in my room one evening, when I received a phone call. It was a female voice on the other end. She said, ” I hope that you don’t mind me calling you in your room, but I just wanted to say to you, that I have been an extra on the film, which I really enjoyed doing. I just wanted to say how much I admire what you’re doing on the film”. I was pretty floored and intrigued by her voice. She was articulate, well spoken. Could she be beautiful? We chatted for a long time, my interest growing. I asked suddenly, if I could visit her? She spoke so well, that my curiosity got the better of me. She said yes and gave me her address. I finished the conversation, and went down to the lobby, there were always taxis available on the forecourt. I grabbed one and we reached her place fairly quickly. She let me in. She was not the beauty I was hoping for, but she was slim, young and reasonably attractive. I had not noticed her on set, but everyone looked dowdy as prisoners. What took me by surprise, was where she lived. It was a single, simply furnished room. There was someone else there too. She introduced me to her brother. There were two single beds in the room, and that was about it. The bathroom and kitchen must have been separate and, no doubt, shared. I then realized that most people in Belgrade, lived like this. The chat that had started on the phone, continued in her room, with the odd interjection from her young brother, who must have been about 20. She was easy to be with. We covered all kinds of topics. She was bright, and was growing on me. It was getting late, I had an early call the following morning, so I asked if I could take her out to dinner the next evening? She immediately agreed. I think that she had a crush on me. We agreed a time to pick her up, and I got a taxi back to the hotel.\n\nI thought about it that next day, and decided to take her to Zemun, a kind of twin city to Belgrade. It was very unlikely that any of the crew or cast would be there. I picked her up by taxi at the agreed time. She had her best dress, high shoes, and panty-hose on. Along with make-up, the she had made an extra effort to look nice for me this evening. I found that sexy. She did look good. I asked the taxi driver to take us to the best restaurant in Zemun. He took us to a very nice place. She was obviously not used to going to such a restaurant. She was definitely not a good time girl. I got the distinct feeling that she really struggled to make ends meet. So this was a real treat for her. We had three courses and wine. I enjoyed her company. She was intelligent and a good conversationalist. It was too early to go home, and I was reluctant to take her back to my hotel. So we wandered around the streets of Zemun. Yes, we kissed passionately and held hands. We found dark corners and groped each other. We must have been on the streets for a couple of hours, acting like new lovers. It was time to go home. She then said something extraordinary to me. “We inhabit different worlds. We are not meant to be together. You are rich and live a totally different life to me.” She reached down to her hand bag and gave me a gift. It was a bound artist’s sketch book, with hundreds of white blank pages in it. On the inside cover, there were a few head shots of her and some writing in Cyrillic, it said ” thanks for such a great time!” I dropped her off at her place in a taxi. She had finished being an extra on the film. I never saw her again. However, I wrote my first solo play in that book, her head shot would remind me our special night for a long time.\n\nSadly, during this period, I was like a dog in heat. Maybe my accent made me attractive to women? I was also at the peak of my powers. I’d always been able to attract women, and for that matter, men. I was slim and fit, not yet losing my hair. My new interest was a waitress that helped serve breakfast in the morning. She was young, tall, naturally blonde and could easily have been a model, she was pretty stunning. It seems that the Intercontinental hired pretty girls deliberately, to improve the patrons ” scenery”. The only problem with this girl, was that had one of her front teeth missing. Dental care wasn’t high on Yugoslavs list of priorities. Local people had bad teeth, generally. One morning, I asked her out? She said yes, that night. She slipped me her phone number. I was to call her after work, when she would give me her address.\n\nAfter work, I phoned the number. She answered the phone and gave me her address. I showered and put good clothes on. I hopped into a taxi and set off. She failed to tell me that her place was miles and miles away. I had an altercation with the taxi driver, who tried to put a card in front of the meter. This had been done to me before. Things would get worse before the evening was finished. We finally got there. It really was on the outskirts of the city. It turned out that her middle-aged mother insisted on coming to the restaurant, to “chaperone” her. This had never happened to me before. I was in semi-shock. The girl looked glum, as we walked to the local restaurant. There, the mother dominated the conversation. Occasionally, the daughter, who I was really interested in, could hardly get a word in edge ways. On top of that, the mum started making eyes at me, flirting with me. The model girl sat there, miserable. I wanted to get out of this situation. I paid the bill and managed to get a taxi all the way back to the hotel.\n\nI’m not sure where this womanizing came from? Maybe it was out of the fact that I was a method actor? Day after day, playing a deprived prisoner? Maybe at that moment, I had a high libido? Anyway, I had noticed a Serbian actress, who had a tiny part, but was there for a week or so. I did pay attention to her, because in dowdy clothing, she could emerge as a beautiful swan, dressed up. I became obsessed with this idea. One day on set, I asked her out? She couldn’t meet for a day or two, but she would have a drink with me at the National Theatre cafe at a time that we set. I was fascinated how much she would transform.\n\nThe night of the date arrived. I didn’t know what to expect from her. She definitely didn’t disappoint. She looked gorgeous, with the streaks in her hair and makeup on her face. She looked totally different from the prisoner that she was playing in the film. Over drinks, we had a revealing talk about being an actor in Belgrade. There wasn’t such thing as an agent. So it was every single actor for themselves. I thought that was a bit feudal. But plays ran for years, only perhaps twice a month. I really wish the season was on, because I would overload on theatre going. However, years later, I would see quite a few Belgrade theatre productions, brought over to Toronto and played in front of a burgeoning middle class of newly immigrated Serbian audiences, but that’s a different story. We enjoyed our date. It was getting late. I then asked her back to my room at the hotel? Luckily, she refused. I would have been asking for trouble, if she’d accepted the invitation. She said sensibly, that the whole process should be slower, we should meet for coffee and the rest would fall into place. I don’t remember seeing her on the set again, so the thing fizzled out.\n\nI took a break temporarily from my philandering, with a weekend trip down to Kragujevac, and more specifically, the village of Bare, a few miles from Kragujevac, a city, about a 100 km south of Belgrade. I had been in touch with my parents in Canada and they had given me auntie Radmila´s phone number, who I phoned a few days earlier, to tell her that I was coming. She answered the phone lovingly, meaning that it would be an emotional weekend. She was my dad’s half sister, from my grandfather’s second marriage. We arranged for her husband Todor, to meet with me at the Kragujevac bus station. I got a bus down to Kragujevac, and was duly met by Todor. He drove me to the village. I especially wanted to see my dad’s brother, Milan. I was to see a large group of relatives down in the Kragujevac area. Before that, I met my auntie Radmila. She showed the typical Serbian hospitality, and then some. She was very loving and then she made me a delicious meal, most of it fresh and from the farm. The changes to the village in the 20 years since I’d been there last, were astonishing. Back then, there were no roads, no electricity and no plumbing. Now, the village had the lot. It was a very beautiful area anyway. The forest region. After the meal, she took me to meet my uncle Milan. It was a joyful meeting. We embraced and kissed, as was the Serbian tradition. He looked just like my dad, but shorter and just as intelligent. He told me a story about the war. Basically, you never knew what force would come to the village next, there would be Partisans, (Communists,) Cheknicks, ( Royalists) stopping by every other day, looking for each other. He was witty, just like my dad. He was no longer in the house that they were brought up in. He took me around the house. It was very simple, with a couple of rooms that they all lived in. Now, he had electricity, plumbing, everything. He led me to see his daughter, Zora, who had a summer home in the village. Again, she was very warm, a testament to how much they loved my dad.\n\nI slept at Radmila´s place, on Sunday we were to go to Kragujevac to see Milan´s son, Miroljub. He lived in a quite nice house in a suburb. I hadn’t seen him for 20 years. He now worked as a long distance truck driver. He’d been all over Europe. We had a good chat. His son was about to get married. It would be a full Yugoslav type wedding. He asked me to shoot a video of the wedding? I was in the film business. We had a nice barbecue and we all posed for a photo. I had the photo until quite recently. Uncle Milan in his Partisan cap and a young and fit looking me. They dropped me off at the bus station later, and I went back to Belgrade. It was a wonderful, emotional visit. I would never see that part of my family again.\n\nI had one remaining family commitment, which this time, I didn’t expect. One day, late in the shoot, a young girl extra approached me and said that she was a relative of mine. It turns out that she was the granddaughter of Radmila, my dad’s half sister, who I’d recently seen in the village. Her name was Tanja, and she invited me to visit my cousin, Ruza, in a suburb of Belgrade, Valjevo. It was surprising how this happened, but it was good to see more relatives. I went up there one evening and saw Tanja, Ruza and her husband, both teachers. They made me a very nice dinner and we had a good conversation about education in Yugoslavia. They showed me typical Serbian hospitality. It was a good visit. I would see Tanja in the final days of filming. We would talk. She was a very nice, bright girl. About 4 years ago, my brother Ljuba, with Joan, visited Belgrade, and his stomping grounds in Kragujevac. He sent me a photo of the now retired Ruza and a middle-aged Tanja. Time passes.\n\nI had noticed a girl called Branka from the very beginning of my stay at the Intercontinental. How could I not notice her? She was one of the most beautiful women that I’d ever seen. She had a perfect complexion, lush long hair, lovely figure, beautiful dark brown eyes, and even good teeth! She ran the sports centre of the hotel. There were a few tennis courts, an indoor swimming pool, a gym and a sauna. I used the sauna and occasionally, the pool. I thought that she was not interested in me, but she was friendly enough. Then, just as we were in the last few days of filming, she showed some interest in me. I owe a lot to Eli, the young boy actor, that I’d coached. One day, she made a real fuss of him. Kissing him and cuddling him. I thought that I nothing to lose by asking her out. We were flying back to London tomorrow. To my astonishment, she said that she would like that. We arranged to meet up at the National Theatre cafe later. I had a feeling about this date. I showed up at the cafe later, and she was already there, looking great. We had a really good time. She was easy to talk with. She lived in an apartment with her mother. She had been Miss Montenegro, where her family were from. She told me about the beauty contests of her past, and how happy she was with her present job. The time passed quickly. I offered to walk her home. She lived quite nearby, in the city centre. On the walk home, I kissed her. It just happened naturally, like it was meant to happen. We had some loving moments on that walk. We reached her place. She said that if I was ever in Yugoslavia, I must phone her. She wrote the number down on a piece of paper, which I put safely in my wallet. We kissed each other goodbye. Before I left, she waved goodbye from her ground floor window.\n\nThe next day, I flew back to London. I didn’t feel guilty at all for my actions. My main concern was that Doe should not find out. Quite selfish really. Anyway, I was driven back to our flat in Primrose Hill. Doe was pleased to see me. She didn’t suspect anything. Over the following weeks, we were invited to Jack Gold´s house in North London. We were to see a sneak preview of the film. Doe wore a leather mini skirt for the party. She looked hot. I began to feel guilty for my indiscretions, but that soon passed when I saw her with actress Judith Sharp. She joined us, and the two together, were a picture of loveliness. We thought that it was a first class film, although I was a bit miffed that my scene with Kurt Raab was cut. There was a premiere with the West German actors attended. I looked after Wolfgang Bathke. It was eventually shown on ITV in Britain, and CBS in America, where it played to over 33 million viewers.\n\nWhen award season came around, Escape from Sobibor won the Golden Globe for Outstanding Mini Series or TV Film. Rutger Hauer won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. The most satisfying was the Emmy Award that Jack Gold won for Outstanding Direction of a Mini Series or TV Film. I like to think that I played a small part in the winning of this award. I will always be grateful to Jack Gold, for giving me my first coaching job. A role that would occupy me greatly in future years, and would ultimately, save my life."
