Although Princip and members of “Mlada Bosna” had been convicted before the judicial process even started. His defense has entered the world’s legal textbooks and to this day remains a universal moral model …\n\nScriptwriter and director, Srdjan Koljević, for his movie says that it is important to tell a positive story about a model of morality, courage and firmness, painted in the form of Rudolf Zistler, because such examples are rare, and because they lack today more than ever.\n\nIn the film are acting our renowned actors: Nikola Rakočević, Nebojša Glogovac, Vuk Kostić, Boris Isaković, Dragan Petrović-Pele, Ljubomir Bandović, Branislav Lečić, Rale Milenković, Irfan Mensur, Bane Tomašević, and a whole new generation of actors’ names: Milan Marić, Miloš Đurović, Vaja Dujović, Vučić Perović, Marko Grabež, Marko Pavlović …\n\nProducer is Zoran Janković, director of photography Goran Volarević, costume designer Boris Čakširan, set designer Zoran Petrov, editor Peter Putniković, artistic director Slobodan Terzić, masker Marinela Spasenović, and for the music was hired Biljana Krstić."
