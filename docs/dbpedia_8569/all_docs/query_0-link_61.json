        "text": "Summary\n\nThe fall of the town of Srebrenica and its environs to Bosnian Serb forces in early July 1995 made a mockery of the international community’s professed commitment to safeguard regions it declared to be \"safe areas\" and placed under United Nations protection in 1993. United Nations peacekeeping officials were unwilling to heed requests for support from their own forces stationed within the enclave, thus allowing Bosnian Serb forces to easily overrun it and — without interference from U.N. soldiers — to carry out systematic, mass executions of hundreds, possibly thousands, of civilian men and boys and to terrorize, rape, beat, execute, rob and otherwise abuse civilians being deported from the area.\n\nThis report, based on an investigation by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives from July 31 to August 23, records the events leading up to, during and immediately after the fall of the Srebrenica “safe area,” including gross violations of humanitarian law, as has been typical of Bosnian Serb military conduct to date. Abuses attending the occupation of the “safe area” included the terrorization of women, children and the elderly and the premeditated mass executions of men and boys. The trek through Bosnian Serb-controlled territory that men fleeing the enclave hoped would lead them to safety instead led to ambushes and executions of hundreds and possibly thousands of men in numerous locations. We have based our accounts of these atrocities on the testimony of survivors who have identified locations and sites of mass executions both within the Srebrenica region and in various areas stretching between Bosnian Serb-controlled and Bosnian government-controlled territory.\n\nWe report on the mishandling of the crisis by the U.N.’s Bosnia peacekeeping force UNPROFOR/UNPF — from the craven decisions of its field commanders prior to the fall of Srebrenica, to its apparent suppression and destruction of evidence of massive human rights abuses immediately after the fall of the “safe area.” We also report on the Dutch Defense Ministry’s “mislaying” of a crucial list of missing Bosnian men and boys and its destruction of a video tape showing Bosnian Serb soldiers engaged in extrajudicial executions as Dutch U.N. troops looked on.\n\nThe recent cease-fire in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the euphoria that has accompanied this apparent progress, should not obscure the fact that no peace agreement will be legitimate or stable without justice for human rights abuses. The atrocities described in this report, like the many others that have preceded them in the former Yugoslavia, require of the international community a commitment to reparation for the victims and accountability for the perpetrators.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the World Conference on Human Rights, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia have all decried the atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina as genocide. Yet the international community has failed to fulfill its moral and legal duty to prevent genocide and to insist that those who commit acts of genocide, as well as those responsible for parallel war crimes and crimes against humanity, be brought to justice.\n\nAs this report documents, possibly thousands of civilians were killed by Bosnian Serb forces during and immediately after the offensive on Srebrenica. The whereabouts of thousands of persons remains unknown. Bosnian Serb forces have granted the International Committee of the Red Cross only limited access to a small number of detainees, while the vast majority remain disappeared. A complete investigation to determine the number of civilians executed by Bosnian Serb forces and the fate of those whose whereabouts is unknown is not possible without access to the territory under the control of Bosnian Serb forces, an examination of the sites, and the exhumation of alleged mass graves and examination of corpses which may be found.\n\nTo Bosnian Serb Authorities:\n\nIdentify the fate of all persons — both civilians and combatants — killed during and immediately after the July offensive against the United Nations-designated “safe area” of Srebrenica;\n\nAllow international humanitarian and human rights organizations immediate access to all detainees and ensure the safety of such detainees;\n\nIdentify the site(s) of any possible massacres and allow international forensic experts to exhume and examine the bodies immediately to determine cause of death and to preserve evidence for future prosecution;\n\nProtect all civilians remaining in Bosnian Serb-controlled territories from abuses such as rape, forced labor, forced eviction and imprisonment, harassments that are designed to intimidate, terrorize or forcibly expel, thereby “ethnically cleansing” the regions;\n\nPublicly prosecute, not only those who committed acts of genocide, but also those who allowed atrocities to be committed by troops under their direction, as well as those who provided or assisted such troops.\n\nTo the International Community:\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Helsinki calls the international community, and especially the United States government and its peace negotiating team, to\n\nInsist on immediate international access to all detainees from the Srebrenica “safe area” and demand that their safety and well-being are ensured;\n\nInsist that the Bosnian Serb authorities provide immediate access to the sites of reported massacres during the Srebrenica offensive;\n\nPublicly name the senior political and military leaders who presided and continue to preside over the commission of atrocities related to the Srebrenica offensive. Make details of their crimes public and provide this information to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia;\n\nProvide immediate humanitarian assistance to those displaced by the offensive;\n\nIf relevant, disclose all available information, including intelligence, that implicates Serbia in supplying, assisting or directing Bosnian Serb troops. Also, strengthen the mechanisms for monitoring external support to Bosnian Serb forces;\n\nInvestigate the role of U.N. officials and disclose all available information pertaining to the United Nations’ response to the military offensive against the so-called “safe area” of Srebrenica. Such investigations and disclosures should be aimed at and forthcoming not only from the Dutch government, but also senior military and civilian officials at UNPROFOR/UNPF headquarters in Zagreb. An independent investigation should be conducted into the U.N.’s role before, during and after the fall of the Srebrenica enclave, and disciplinary action should be taken against all those - irrespective of rank - who destroyed or withheld information that provides evidence of human rights abuses;\n\nEnsure that any peace accord agreed to by any of the parties to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina guarantees the right to repatriation of survivors of “ethnic cleansing” and the full protection of all returnees and minority groups. Also, the fate of the missing and disappeared must be disclosed;\n\nTake steps to further protect the remaining United Nations-designated “safe areas” of Gorazde, Sarajevo and Tuzla, and ensure that no siege of these areas or massacre of their inhabitants takes place.\n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia offers an historic opportunity to provide justice to victims of atrocities, possible deterrence against further abuse, and a basis for eventual peace and reconciliation by substituting individualized guilt for the assumptions of collective ethnic guilt that now fuel the conflict. The Serbian government’s active support is needed to secure the presence of defendants for trial, but to date, Belgrade has blocked the tribunal’s investigations and done nothing to secure custody of Bosnian Serbs indicted by the tribunal.\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Helsinki is deeply disturbed that the major powers, despite earlier commitments to the contrary, are now offering rump Yugoslavia (i.e. Serbia and Montenegro) an opportunity to suspend sanctions in return for political concessions that have nothing to do with the tribunal. That offer should be withdrawn, and rump Yugoslavia’s active cooperation with the tribunal - particularly in regard to the investigation of the massacres in the Srebrenica area - should be made a prerequisite for any suspension, lifting or easing of the sanctions.\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Helsinki calls on the major powers to:\n\nAssist actively, including by providing sufficient budgetary support, in the efforts of the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to identify, prosecute, and punish war criminals and to prevent war crimes.\n\nMaintain full economic sanctions against rump Yugoslavia until that government cooperates fully with the investigation and extradition of suspected and indicted war criminals.\n\nBackground\n\nIn April and May 1992, the Bosnian Serb army ‑ with the active assistance of the Yugoslav Army and paramilitary groups from Serbia proper ‑ began a drive to “ethnically cleanse” all non‑Serbian inhabitants from much of Bosnia. As part of its “ethnic cleansing” campaign, Bosnian Serb forces used tactics such as siege warfare, systematic persecution involving widespread torture, murder, rape, beatings, harassment, de jure discrimination, intimidation, forced displacement of people, confiscation and destruction of property, and the destruction of cultural objects such as mosques and Catholic churches. With the fall of Srebrenica and Cepa, Bosnian Serb forces have virtually completed the “ethnic cleansing” of eastern Bosnia. The abuses perpetrated during the “ethnic cleansing” of eastern Bosnia constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity as that term was defined at the Nuremberg trials and within the meaning of customary international law. Moreover, the fact that the abuses associated with “ethnic cleansing” were “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,” and that such acts were perpetrated systematically, that no one was held accountable for such crimes, and that they appear to have been premeditated in some cases, would indicate that the “cleansing” of eastern Bosnia and of the Srebrenica “safe area” in particular was part of a larger attempt by Bosnian Serb forces to commit genocide against the Bosnian Muslims and other non-Serbs.\n\nBefore the war, approximately 37,000 people — 72.5 percent Muslims and 25.5 percent Serbs — lived in the Srebrenica municipality. The town of Srebrenica was a relatively small and poor provincial town that had a population of approximately 8,000 residents. When Bosnian Serb forces began their brutal campaign of “ethnic cleansing” in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina in April and May 1992, most areas quickly fell under Bosnian Serb control. Most of the non-Serb men either fled, were put into detention centers, or were indiscriminately killed. Most of the women, children and elderly who did not escape were forcibly expelled, and the few who remained lived under repressive conditions. Srebrenica initially came under the control of the Bosnian Serb forces in April 1992, but territorial defense units loyal to the Bosnian government retook the city a few weeks later.\n\nThousands of mostly Muslim refugees from other areas of eastern Bosnia flocked to places like Cepa, Gorazde and Srebrenica, where territorial defense units had succeeded in fending off the Bosnian Serb attacks. As a result of this sudden demographic shift, Srebrenica's population swelled to an estimated 55,000 to 60,000, which remained under siege for more than three years.\n\nSrebrenica’s defense was formed from the region’s territorial defense units and was commanded by Naser Oric, formerly a police officer in the Yugoslav Interior Ministry and bodyguard of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Despite being severely outgunned, Oric’s troops initially resisted Bosnian Serb assaults until early 1993, when Bosnian Serb forces launched a major offensive in eastern Bosnia. This attack reduced the Srebrenica municipality from approximately fourteen square kilometers to eight square kilometers. The Srebrenica pocket became increasingly vulnerable as Bosnian Serb forces tried to overrun the city. Bosnian Serb shelling increased, while access for U.N. humanitarian aid convoys decreased. Residents were reported to be on the verge of starvation, and the humanitarian crisis in the area became dire.\n\nReports of Srebrenica's disastrous situation in late February and early March 1993 prompted the United States to spearhead an air‑drop operation as a means to ensure that food reached the besieged enclave. As a result, the malnutrition crisis was somewhat alleviated, but the Bosnian Serb attacks continued. On March 11, 1993, the French commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, Gen. Phillipe Morillion, forced his way into the pocket. His visit was the first by an international observer for several months and was an attempt to publicly protest against the Bosnian Serbs’ siege and continued attacks against the enclave. However, when Morillion had made his point and prepared to leave, the citizens of Srebrenica prevented his exit. Women and children lay on the ground in front of his convoy and refused to let it pass, forcing Morillion to stay in Srebrenica until the United Nations concretely addressed their immediate needs. Morillion left about a week later when the first convoy with humanitarian aid in months finally arrived in the town. Some of the enclave’s 60,000 residents were also evacuated during the period, reducing the population of the enclave to approximately 40,000 people.\n\nMeanwhile, Bosnian Serb forces announced that they would only end their attacks on Srebrenica if the residents relinquished their weapons to the U.N., thereby making Srebrenica a \"demilitarized zone.” U.N. troops were allowed into the enclave only after most weapons there were placed under U.N. control. Despite Bosnian Serb protests, Srebrenica’s defenders retained their light weapons. Bosnian Serbs would later justify their final offensive on the enclave by claiming that these weapons were being used against them. On April 16, 1993, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 819 declaring Srebrenica a \"safe area,” and a cease-fire was signed on April 17. Access for humanitarian convoys was no longer denied, and the first 133 Canadian U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) soldiers moved into the town. Srebrenica became a catalyst for the creation of five other United Nations-declared “safe areas” three weeks later.\n\nThe role of the U.N. in the “safe areas” has been mired in confusion since the areas’ inception. The Security Council resolutions establishing the six “safe areas” provided for the placement of U.N. troops within the areas but left unclear whether force could be used to protect the enclaves and their population from attack or whether U.N. troops could use force only for their own self-defense. A subsequent resolution stated that UNPROFOR was mandated to “deter attacks against the safe areas.” A May 1994 report by the U.N. Secretary-General made clear that U.N. troops were authorized to use force to protect the “safe areas” but that, due to a lack of troops, the U.N. could not guarantee the defense of the “safe areas.” The U.N. estimated that it would need 34,000 troops, “to ensure full respect for the ‘safe areas,’” but it assumed that only an initial force of 7,600 would be available. According to U.N. officials in the field, only 3,500 were eventually deployed and only a few hundred of those were deployed in Srebrenica. This made it nearly impossible to fend off any attacks, if only U.N. troops were used. U.N. commanders have generally interpreted their mandate narrowly, claiming that U.N. troops could use force only to protect themselves, not the civilian population, within the “safe areas.” The aforementioned report by the secretary-general states: “UNPROFOR understands its mission [within the safe areas] as follows:\n\nTo protect the civilian populations of the designated safe areas against armed attacks and other hostile acts, through the presence of its troops and, if necessary, through the application of air power, in accordance with agreed procedure.”\n\nAlthough the safe areas may have been created with good intentions, in actuality, they became U.N.-administered ethnic ghettos. The humanitarian air drops to Srebrenica ended after Bosnian Serb forces allowed the U.N. to resume land convoys through Serbian-controlled territory from Belgrade to the enclaves. Unlike the air drops, the deliverance of humanitarian aid by land convoys allowed the Bosnian Serbs to examine, monitor and control the quantity, contents, and frequency of the deliveries. Bosnian Serb forces also demanded a portion of the aid in exchange for allowing its passage into the enclave. Sporadic violence continued around the Srebrenica “safe area” to varying degrees for the next two and a half years. Thousands of people huddled together, with inadequate food, water and shelter, living in isolation from the rest of the world. Only a few hundred lightly armed peacekeepers and increasingly disingenuous threats of NATO air strikes guaranteed their safety.\n\nThe Fall of Srebrenica\n\nBosnian Serb forces justified their increasing attacks on the U.N.-declared “safe area” of Srebrenica by pointing to “terrorist activities” being carried out by Bosnian Army troops from within the enclave. In a July 1995 letter sent to Gen. Rupert Smith, the commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic justified the offensive on the Srebrenica “safe area” by claiming that Bosnian Army commando raids out of the enclave had killed more than one hundred Serbian civilians since the U.N. demilitarized the pocket in May 1993. “This action is aimed to neutralize the terrorists. Our activities are not aimed against civilians or the U.N.,” Mladic wrote.\n\nAccording to H.H., a fifty-five-year-old man:\n\nStarting in April of this year, all the way to late June, there was talk of an army buildup near Perucac. Scouts and people who traveled between Srebrenica and Cepa reported seeing younger soldiers dressed in black uniforms in the area; they reported seeing military maneuvers being carried out, tanks on higher ground and tank columns moving towards Cepa. Then the Chetniks started to bomb incrementally starting in April; people who trekked between Srebrenica and Cepa for food started to be killed in large numbers. Of about one hundred who would leave, only thirty or forty would return. In two months about 2,000 people lost their lives between Srebrenica and Cepa.\n\nThere was a lot of commotion in Srebrenica in the beginning of May when some of our men carried out a strike in Visnjica and killed those Serbs. People in Srebrenica were furious because — as the word was — it wasn’t an ordered operation, but something carried out by individuals acting on their own. Everyone feared that this mindless action was equivalent to signing a suicide note for the city. From that day on, there was no more peace in Srebrenica. Bombs fell into the city every day and even during one night in June, the Chetniks carried out a commando strike inside the city. People were afraid.\n\nU.N. officials acknowledge that Bosnian soldiers did launch attacks from the Srebrenica pockets, but stated that such attacks were few and small in scale, usually intended to obtain food and ammunition from the Bosnian Serbs.\n\nPrelude: Starvation and Manipulation of Aid\n\nLong before July 1995, there were numerous indications that Bosnian Serb forces were planning a summer offensive against the “safe area.” Access for U.N. convoys was increasingly restricted by Bosnian Serb forces, so that by late February and early March 1995, only one convoy per month was being allowed into the “safe area” to feed the approximately 39,000 people. Furthermore, Bosnian Serb forces forbade the U.N. convoys from delivering any salt to Srebrenica and Cepa, in what some UNPROFOR officials told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives, was an attempt to prevent residents from preserving food.\n\nThe UNPROFOR officials also stated that by May, civilians in the enclave began to suffer from malnutrition, and by the first days of June, seven people had died of hunger. Such conduct by Bosnian Serb forces violated an agreement, reached between the Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serbs on May 8, 1993, which stipulated that Bosnian Serbs would allow food and other humanitarian aid convoys into Srebrenica and respect the principles behind the U.N.-declared “safe area.” A U.N. official in Tuzla told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives:\n\nThis was a deliberate tactic used by the Serbs to weaken the population of the enclave in order to prepare the area for a final offensive; the incremental denial of food, water, electricity and proper medical supplies by the Serbs over a long period of time should actually have been viewed as the true preparatory stages of the July assault on the enclave and should have served as a warning signal to the international community that the so-called United Nations “safe area” of Srebrenica was in danger.\n\nMargriet Prins, UNHCR’s head of logistics in Tuzla, warned the commander of the peacekeeping forces there not to use any of the humanitarian supplies that had been stockpiled. “I knew that the enclaves would fall. . . . I think most of us knew. It was obvious that the Bosnian Serbs needed a victory, since people on their side have been getting sicker and sicker of the war, and it was obvious that no one was going to stop them if they were serious.” As Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives were told by a U.N. official, on July 2 a request was made to U.S. forces in Zagreb to initiate an airlift operation, to supply humanitarian aid to the Srebrenica pocket; the request was turned down because it posed security risks for U.S. pilots flying over Serb-controlled areas. By early July, the U.N. soldiers within the enclave were completely out of fuel and patrolled regularly on foot. According to UNPROFOR/UNPF officials, it was not uncommon to see people combing the garbage dumps looking for food within the enclave at that time.\n\nU.N. Failure to Prepare or React\n\nPrior to the offensive, Bosnian Serb forces hampered peacekeeping effectiveness, as well as troop rotations into Srebrenica. Bosnian Serb forces also crippled the Dutch battalion’s military capability prior to the July offensive. The Dutch unit was equipped with TOW missiles capable of destroying tanks, but prior to the offensive Bosnian Serb forces confiscated vital TOW spare parts as the Dutch were bringing them into the enclave. This made the missiles inoperable. Also, two rotations of Dutch troops stationed in the enclave had been allowed to leave, but the Bosnian Serbs refused their replacements entry. As a result, the force was reduced from an already gravely insufficient force of about 400, to about 300. According to U.N. officials interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives, another larger rotation of between fifty and eighty Dutch troops was due to leave the enclave on July 5, the day before the offensive began, but they reluctantly remained as signs of the offensive flared up.\n\nThus, the entire pocket — civilians and UNPROFOR troops alike — were psychologically and physically exhausted weeks prior to the offensive. One U.N. official admitted to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives that the Dutch troops were so eager to leave that they avoided, with one exception, reporting serious signals of the looming offensive, such as troop movements, new reinforcements coming into the area, and large amounts of fuel being sent to the enclave. For example, just two days before the attack Bosnian Serb forces allowed one convoy carrying 100,000 liters of diesel fuel, an unprecedented amount, into the pocket. This fuel was then recaptured when the “safe area” was overrun. Given the embargo on the Bosnian Serbs, as well as their refusal to allow fuel into the enclave on previous occasions, their sudden influx of fuel should have been suspicious to the Dutch U.N. soldiers. Without the fuel, Bosnian Serb forces would not have been able to later bus tens of thousands of Muslims to Bosnian government-controlled territory. Instead of heeding these warning signals, U.N. officials initially brushed off the Bosnian Serb incursions into the “safe area,” claiming that they believed that the Bosnian Serbs intended only to capture the southeastern tip of the pocket.\n\nIn late June and the days leading up to July 6, the number of shells landing within 200 meters of U.N. observation posts inside the enclave had increased substantially, concentrated mainly in the southern part of the enclave. Bosnian Serb artillery and tanks also advanced towards the enclave from the north and northeast. In total, U.N. sources estimate that approximately 5,000 Bosnian Serb troops had surrounded the enclave by July 5 with fifty artillery pieces and fifteen to twenty battle vehicles, including tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs). July 5 was the quietest day the pocket had seen in a month; almost no incidents were reported.\n\nOffensive against the UN Designated “Safe Area” of Srebrenica\n\nBosnian Serb forces launched a full-scale offensive on Srebrenica at 3:15 A.M. on July 6. Bosnian Serb forces, already less than two kilometers from the center of the city, began to shell civilian targets within the enclave. This was the first in a pattern of incidents invoking widespread panic and chaos because there was no place for Srebrenica’s people to retreat. The shelling was too heavy to count the number of detonations, but U.N. estimates were in the thousands. The shelling did not stop until 3:00 P.M. and then resumed the next day at noon.\n\nOn July 7, the assault continued, although only a few casualties were reported. On July 8, Bosnian Serb forces heavily shelled central Srebrenica, advancing quickly. They attacked near the U.N. observation posts \"U,\" \"S\" and \"F\" [see map at end of section] in the southern part of the enclave near a key road leading from Cepa ‑ the adjacent eastern enclave - to the northern part of the Srebrenica pocket.\n\nGiven the scarcity of housing within the enclave, Srebrenica’s residents sought shelter as Bosnian Serb troops began taking control of U.N. observation posts one by one. By the time the offensive was over, fifty-five U.N. troops had been taken hostage.\n\nDuring July 7 and 8, tensions between the Bosnian Army and the Dutch U.N. troops rose because Dutch troops refused several requests from the government to fight on its behalf. Additionally, during the course of the attacks, the local defense force in Srebrenica tried several times to take their weapons from the U.N. collection sites, but the Dutch troops refused them access. Bosnian Army soldiers then threatened to kill Dutch troops if they ever abandoned their posts. These tensions culminated on July 8, when Bosnian Serb forces overran observation post “F.” As the U.N. troops retreated, a Bosnian soldier shot and killed a Dutch U.N. soldier.\n\nIn view of the increasing Bosnian Serb attack against the “safe area,” Dutch soldiers within the enclave requested close air support from their U.N. commanders, but the date of the request remains disputed. Some contend that had close air support been provided sooner rather than later, the Bosnian Serbs might have halted their assault on the “safe area” and thereby prevented the subsequent displacement and execution of its inhabitants. U.N. officials interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki deny that Dutch troops in the “safe area” requested close air support on July 8, claiming such a request did not come in until July 10. Other evidence, however, suggests that Dutch troops in the enclave acted sooner and believed that close air support might have dissuaded the Bosnian Serbs from pressing their offensive. According to press accounts, Lt. Col. Ton Karremans requested close air support on July 8, after the U.N. soldier had been killed by Bosnian government troops. That request was reportedly turned down by a commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Rupert Smith, in Sarajevo. \"They [Smith and his staff] felt the U.N. in Zagreb would see it as too early and not worth the risk,\" a Western military source in Zagreb said. Smith and his staff in Sarajevo apparently also feared that the Bosnian Serb forces would then be motivated to capture and hold more U.N. troops. By this time, the Bosnian Serb forces had already taken about thirty Dutch peacekeepers hostage.\n\nOn July 9, most civilians on the outskirts of town had flooded the city center as Bosnian Serb forces closed in. Roughly 26,000 people were now living in an area where only 4,000 had lived before the war. Dutch soldiers in observation post \"A\" were attacked, and Bosnian Serb troops advanced on Dutch soldiers in observation post \"C\". Elsewhere, Dutch soldiers in an armored personnel carrier had been taken hostage. Of the three U.N. observation post in the southernmost tip of the enclave, each with roughly eight Dutch U.N. troops inside, one (observation post \"F\") had retreated and regrouped into a blocking position, and two (observation posts \"U\" and \"S\") had surrendered, and the U.N. troops at these two points were taken hostage. In addition, U.N. troops in observation post \"K\" reported heavy fighting in their vicinity. These troops were surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces to the south, west and east and were not allowed to withdraw to the north by Bosnian government forces. Observation post \"M\" had already been shelled and its troops had withdrawn to the south. Observation post \"D\" was surrounded by Bosnian troops and the U.N. was negotiating a withdrawal with these soldiers.\n\nNATO jets were called in on July 9 to fly overhead, but rather than strike, the U.N. opted to withdraw and set up a \"blocking unit\" with about seventy troops. The U.N. sent Mladic a letter warning that if Bosnian Serb forces crossed the U.N. “blocking unit,” they would face NATO air strikes. \"This attack against a U.N. safe area is totally unacceptable and is a grave escalation of the conflict. The U.N. demands that this offensive cease forthwith,\" the letter read. U.N. officials echoed the written statement saying that any attempt by Bosnian Serb tanks to get past the platoon of Dutch soldiers outside the city would result in bombing by NATO. The U.N. and the Bosnian Army stood their ground until July 11, when Bosnian Serb forces plowed past their defenses.\n\nBy the evening of July 9, the staff of Lt. Gen. Bernard Janvier, the commander of all U.N. troops in the former Yugoslavia, was recommending that the Dutch troops be given close air support, but Janvier refused. At that point, European Union mediator Karl Bildt was in Belgrade trying to negotiate with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Janvier reportedly feared that air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces would jeopardize the talks. He argued, as one source present at the meeting puts it: \"If Karremans can hold out without close air, let's try it.\"\n\nOn July 10, the assault continued as a front opened up on the eastern side of the enclave. Bosnian Serb forces directly targeted the Srebrenica hospital between 1:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M. According to UNHCR estimates, approximately 30,000 people began to evacuate Srebrenica and move back to the northern part of the enclave towards a U.N. base in Potocari — a village located halfway between Srebrenica and Bratunac. On the same day, observation post \"H\" emptied and the Dutch troops withdrew.\n\nThe Security Council condemned the attack and demanded that the Bosnian Serb forces surrender and that both parties respect the April 1993 agreement. The Bosnian Serbs then announced that the U.N. troops could have safe passage out of the enclave if they surrendered their weapons, and demanded that all civilians leave the town within forty-eight hours. Meanwhile, a Pentagon official stated, \"We don't think the city is falling. . . . It's under considerable stress. . . . Our belief is that this is in retaliation for the [Bosnian] government offensive around Sarajevo, and designed to generate refugees, intimidate the U.N. and discredit the government.\"\n\nFinally, on July 11, two days after the Bosnian Serb forces had driven through the U.N. blocking position, the U.N. used the close air support it had at its disposal. The request from the Dutch troops came at 8:00 A.M. on July 11, and was made in consultation with the Dutch foreign minister. The foreign minister approved the use of air strikes, despite the fact that Dutch U.N. troops were being held hostage, but the request was again denied by Gen. Bernard Janvier. At noon, another request for air strikes was made by the Dutch troops as Bosnian Serb forces walked into Srebrenica. At this point, Janvier decided he had no choice but to order air strikes, and at 2:23 P.M., a NATO air strike was finally launched. Four U.S. F16 fighter planes took part in the attack, which resulted in the destruction of one Bosnian Serb tank. As one U.N. official said, \"It was a meager display. Too little, too late.\"\n\nAfter gathering some belongings and food from his home, J.N. retreated to the hills, from where he could see the activities of both NATO and the Bosnian Serb forces. He reported to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki:\n\nFrom that hill we could see everything that was going on in town. We saw a village, which was burning. Tanks were firing on the village. We just sat and watched while houses were pummeled one by one. Then we saw a column of tanks, armored personnel carriers and different kinds of vehicles in Bibici ‑ about one kilometer from Srebrenica. The Chetnik vehicles were placed along the whole road from Bibici to Srebrenica. We could see the Chetniks shelling all the villages in the vicinity. They used the kind of shells that explode into fire as soon as they hit objects, so the houses began to burn at once. The Chetniks were shelling exactly the places where the most people were concentrated. When I was sitting and looking at what they were doing to us, I started to cry and I said to myself that we would never survive this. My brother said he thought none of us would make it out alive. Then two NATO airplanes showed up and from this hill where we were, we could see everything. These NATO planes circled two or three times around Srebrenica and then they dropped a couple of bombs. But I saw each one come down, and I am sure that none of them hit their targets. Even while the planes were dropping the bombs, they were still firing their tanks at the towns and villages. These airplanes came about three or four times and after they left, the Chetniks began to bombard us harder than ever.\n\nBosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic threatened to fire on the Dutch compound and the civilian population of Srebrenica and to execute Dutch peacekeeping hostages, if more air strikes were carried out. Following NATO’s attacks on Bosnian Serb targets, Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve contacted Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. secretary general’s special representative to the former Yugoslavia and chief U.N. civilian officer in the U.N. mission, and demanded that air strikes be called off immediately. Such a request was apparently contrary to earlier requests by the Dutch Foreign Ministry for air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces. Akashi complied, the air strikes were not repeated, and the U.N. effort to save the U.N. designated “safe area” of Srebrenica shifted to damage control.\n\nThe immediate reactions to the fall of the so-called U.N. “safe area\" of Srebrenica were mainly of panic and disunity. The U.N. Security Council unanimously voted for a resolution, which demanded that the Bosnian Serb forces halt their offensive, immediately pull back from Srebrenica, and free the Dutch U.N. soldiers. French President Jacques Chirac put forth an offer — never seriously considered and perhaps so intended — to send French troops as part of a multinational force if the Security Council so requested, in order to return the status of Srebrenica to a \"safe area.\" On July 13, Reuters reported that British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind had urged Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to make the Bosnian Serbs “behave in a more civilized fashion.” British Prime Minister John Major opted for inaction, however, by threatening to pull British U.N. peacekeepers out of Bosnia altogether. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel recommended leaving the Srebrenica issue alone and concentrating instead on an impending attack on the “safe area” of Cepa. NATO announced that it condemned the taking of Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb forces and declared that it was \"waiting for orders from the U.N.\"\n\nIn replying to the U.N. Security Council's resolution demanding that Bosnian Serb forces pull back from Srebrenica, rebel Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic announced that “Srebrenica is our land” and that there can be absolutely no word about retreat. Bosnian Serb forces proceeded to pass through Srebrenica and continued on to Potocari without much resistance. More observation posts withdrew and U.N. troops and Srebrenica’s civilians began to consolidate at a United Nations base in Potocari in the north.\n\nPotocari\n\nBy the time the air strikes occurred on July 11, much of the enclave was already in Bosnian Serb hands and most of the civilian population had already begun to retreat toward the Dutch battalion’s U.N. base in the village of Potocari. U.N. troops tried to organize a hasty evacuation from the city center of Srebrenica for the roughly 28,000 panicked, but widespread chaos prevailed.\n\nEvacuation from Srebrenica\n\nT.T. gave her account of her family’s quick departure:\n\nThe U.N. began telling everyone they had to leave and they organized transportation to Potocari. Everyone then started climbing up into trucks, but because I was with my three children and one of them was an infant, I couldn't fight my way in, so I had to stay. Some of us managed to get into the trucks, but there were a lot who didn't, and the column of people who were walking was very long. The Chetniks were shelling the path that we were taking, and a lot of people were killed. Most of us tried not to look because we were just trying to save our own lives.\n\nB.J., a twenty-three-year-old woman from the village of Orlica, gave a similar account of a hasty retreat:\n\nWhen the Chetniks finally entered Srebrenica, everyone was still there — even many of the men who had fought to defend the town. The Chetniks pulled out again during the bombing, and we chased our men into the forests and mountains. Then mostly women, children, the elderly, the disabled, and many young boys and girls picked up and started to walk to Potocari where UNPROFOR made a large circle surrounded by barbed wire so we could all get inside. About 4,000 of us arrived in Potocari at first, but more came later.\n\nH.H., a fifty-five-year-old man from the village of Fojhar, believed the Bosnian Serb attack and the initial retreat of U.N. troops from Srebrenica were only temporary and would no doubt be reversed since the area was a U.N.-declared “safe haven.” According to H.H.:\n\nBy July 11, UNPROFOR soldiers were in a constant retreat. At 8:00 A.M. they were positioned near the mosque at Petri_ and began to retreat towards the center. By noon, they had moved back to the department store, by 12:30 P.M., they were at the bus station, and by 1:15P.M. they were at the gas station. At 1:20P.M., I locked the door of my house and joined the retreating civilians and soldiers — at this point the Chetniks were at Kazanski bridge. So many people like myself thought that what was happening would only be a temporary thing. We thought that soon the West and the U.N. would demand that the Serbian forces retreat from Srebrenica and that the “safe area” status would be restored. “It was a U.N. ‘safe haven,’ there is no way it will be allowed to fall,” I thought. That’s why I didn’t take anything with me when I left my house. I just locked my door and figured I’d be back in a few hours or a few days at the longest. Now all I have with me — of all the things I owned — are the keys to the front door of my house.\n\nBy Tuesday, July 12, the Potocari camp was completely overcrowded. Approximately 3,000 to 4,000 civilians were crammed inside the U.N. base, and over 24,000 others stayed in the surrounding buildings or outside the camp. Shooting continued throughout the Srebrenica pocket and Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic warned that unless Srebrenica surrendered the pocket would be shelled into submission. T.Y., a fifty-five-year-old man from Pobuce, told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives:\n\nThe Chetniks entered the area and started lighting up hamlets. Mortars were falling everywhere, and the people were all heading towards the U.N. base; everyone wanted to follow the UNPROFOR soldiers, because we didn’t know what else to do. But even as we met up with the UNPROFOR soldiers and retreated with them, the Chetniks still continued to shell us.\n\nBosnian Serb Forces Masquerade as U.N. Troops\n\nBosnian Serb forces had, by this time, completely surrounded the civilians in Potocari, and their tanks and artillery pieces in the hills were clearly visible from the camp. Most of Srebrenica’s able-bodied men between the ages of sixteen and sixty had gathered together in a separate location in order to escape capture. They set off on a long trek through Bosnian Serb-controlled territory in an effort to reach Bosnian government-controlled areas, at the closest — about fifty kilometers away. The journey took the approximately 12,000 to 15,000 men between five and thirty-five days. Some men were still crossing over into Bosnian government-controlled area at the time Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives were in Tuzla during the entire month of August. On July 12, Serbian forces captured observation posts “R,” “Q” and “N;” only posts “A” and “C” remained under U.N. control. By this time, a total of forty-eight Dutch U.N. troops had been captured by the Bosnian Serbs, and most had been transferred to Bratunac.\n\nMeanwhile in Potocari, Bosnian Serb troops were freely walking inside the camp among the civilians, with the U.N. reduced to bystanders. Many displaced persons told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives that the Dutch troops had been stripped to their underwear and that many Bosnian Serb soldiers were wearing U.N. uniforms and helmets, walking among the displaced persons in Potocari, fooling civilians into thinking they were really U.N. troops.\n\nT.N., a sixty-three-year-old refugee from eastern Bosnia who had been living in Srebrenica, recounted the following:\n\nAt one point during all this, a few Serbian soldiers stopped an UNPROFOR vehicle and pulled out two UNPROFOR soldiers. The UNPROFOR men were very angry. The Serbs were making them take off their clothes at gun point. One U.N. man got really mad, took his uniform off and threw it on the ground. Then the Serbs took off in their vehicle.\n\nThe UNHCR also reportedly confirmed that ninety-nine people, including twenty to thirty women and children, were killed by Bosnian Serb soldiers. The soldiers, wearing the blue helmets and driving the white jeeps they had stolen from surrendering Dutch troops, had lured the refugees out of hiding to their deaths.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 13, Bosnian Serb soldiers stopped a U.N. medical convoy at Kravica, where UNPROFOR soldiers were forced to give the Bosnian Serbs their flak jackets. One witness reported seeing men dressed in U.N. uniforms, who spoke fluent Serbian, abducting two young women from Potocari. N.P., a sixty-five-year-old man from Likari, described to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives that he also saw Serbian soldiers dressed as U.N. peacekeepers:\n\nWhen I arrived at Potocari on Tuesday, the Chetniks were already there. We saw some U.N. soldiers in their underpants. Initially, the people thought that U.N. soldiers were walking amongst them, only to discover that it was really Chetniks dressed up in their uniforms. I saw them pulling young boys and girls out of the crowd on Tuesday night. . . . Everyone at that time thought that the U.N. would guarantee our safety no matter what happened. We thought everything would soon be all over. If I had known that things would turn out like this and that I would never come back, I would have burned my own house down rather than have the Chetniks loot and vandalize it.\n\nEvacuation of Potocari and Early Killings\n\nOnce the refugees had gathered in Potocari, the Bosnian Serbs began the mass transportation of civilians to Bosnian government-controlled territory. An evacuee list was prepared: first, the sick were to be evacuated; second, the weak; third, the women with children; and fourth, men between the ages of sixteen and sixty. The latter group would only be released after the men had been interrogated to determine if they had committed any “war crimes.” The actual deportations began on Wednesday and took one and one-half days to complete. The Bosnian Serbs transported the civilians in their own buses, each capable of transporting roughly seventy people. The aforementioned 100,000-liter shipment of U.N. gasoline, which had been allowed in by the Bosnian Serbs prior to the offensive, was apparently used to fuel the buses. Although most of the men had already fled to escape capture, some (mostly of non-draft age) remained. They were randomly separated from the rest of the people over the course of the next three days.\n\nE.A., a woman, reported seeing twenty men being taken away and then one returning after he had been beaten. According to E.A.:\n\nOn Wednesday evening [July 13], Mladic arrived [in Potocari] and announced that transportation would be halted until 7:00 A.M. the next morning. That day I saw approximately twenty men being taken away by a tractor‑trailer. Women were crying and screaming; then they took four or five more men away. The circle was very big. When the men were taken away, the women screamed and cried. I saw some other men — five or six of them — being taken away. One of them came back Thursday morning. He was from Suceska, but I don't know his name. He said that those five to six people who were taken away the night before would now \"guard the area with the Chetniks together;\" he must have been ordered to say this because it didn't make any sense at all.[60]\n\nBosnian Serb soldiers searched the factories near the U.N. base and surrounding buildings, taking away specific individuals who had taken shelter there. Then, Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic arrived in Potocari on Wednesday afternoon. After Serbian television had recorded him handing out candy to the children and telling the refugees that they would be taken care of, the atrocities began. According to T.Y.:\n\nSuddenly a truck carrying water and bread pulled up next to the factory. The Serbs started throwing the bread out to us and everyone scrambled for it since we hadn’t had any food the night before. Right away, Serbian photographers started taking pictures of how the Chetniks were giving us food and water. The journalists then left with Mladic, and the UNPROFOR soldiers were just left there in their underclothes. Afterwards, the Chetniks started pulling young girls and boys out of the crowd. While all of this was going on, I recognized one of the Chetniks; his name is Jovan Nikolic. He is about thirty years old and is from Kravica; he was a director of a school in Pobuce. By that night, the people who hadn’t been transported out yet became hysterical and frightened. We began to hear talk about corpses being discovered in the area. Chetniks told us that we were Kurds. By Thursday morning, women were wailing and crying because many of their husbands and/or sons had been taken away by the Chetniks for one reason or another, but had not been brought back.\n\nT.T., originally from Srebrenica, described how she dressed her fifteen-year-old son as a woman to fool the Bosnian Serb soldiers picking young boys out of the crowd. According to T.T.:\n\nThey [the soldiers] said, “We won't hurt you ‑ we are the regular army,” and then in the afternoon, on the second day Ratko Mladic showed up. He was standing just a few feet away from me when he spoke to us. He said everything would be fine, that there was no need to worry, that we would be safe here, and that nothing would happen to us. But not long after he left, about 1:00 P.M. or 2:00 P.M., the Chetniks came into the building wearing camouflage police uniforms with the kokarda on their caps, and they started to take boys out of the building. They took about thirty boys away, we don't know where, but we never saw them again. They told us they were only going to ask the boys a few questions ‑ that nothing at all would happen to them. We didn't dare look too closely to draw attention to ourselves. I was hiding my son. That night while we were in the building, we could hear screaming from outside ‑ terrible screams all around, and the women were all crying for their sons. My son and I spent that night together terrified. He said we shouldn't wait another day to leave ‑ that we should leave tomorrow. So in the morning, on the third day, we left the building and headed toward the meeting area for the transports to Tuzla. At this place, the Chetniks were separating us into groups of men, or women with children. They were including little boys as young as twelve years old in the group of men, so I dressed my son up like a little girl. I put a scarf on his head and some bag on his back to make him look younger, and he snuck past them with me.\n\nA Muslim woman, J.N., described to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives how her son was killed:\n\nAfter 2:00 P.M. when Mladic left, it got very bad. The soldiers began to drink. Mladic said all of us ‑ all women and children ‑ would be evacuated that night to Kladanj. I was about to go and look for my youngest son Elmadin; [he was] fifteen years old. He was in a circle with soldiers and dogs all around him, and I couldn't get through. I went to find this U.N. interpreter, Vahid, and asked for his help. He said there was nothing he could do ‑ that there was nothing the U.N. [soldiers] could do because they had all been disarmed for the last four days. Then he said that I should find the particular man who took my son, because he is probably the only one who could help me. Then I went up to this tent where there were ten Serbian soldiers, and I asked them what happened to my son. The Serb's name was Dragan. He said not to worry and that he had already sent my son to Kladanj, and that he was perfectly safe. I went back to the circle, and I was crying. Then at 4:00 the next day, they took my husband away. My husband was with two of my children, a daughter and my three-year‑old son. They took my son out of his arms and just threw him on the ground. I was screaming, but they didn't stop. Then they made my daughter break away from my husband, and they threw her on the ground, too. And then my son Esmir . . . . It is just so hard to talk about this, I can't, it just breaks my heart. . . . I was holding him in my arms. He was my son from my first marriage. We were hugging, but they took him away. They grabbed him and just slit his throat. They killed him. They made me drink his blood. I just can't say anymore, I just can’t, you have to understand that it is breaking my heart. I'm still hoping the authorities or anyone can still get my other son or my husband free. . .\n\nT.N. described how her husband and she were beaten as they were being separated:\n\nThey had been separating the men and women, but my husband and I had managed to stay together somehow. Finally, when it was time to leave, we went to the buses together. We were holding each other tightly. Just before we were about to get on the bus, the Serbian soldiers told us to let go of each other. We wouldn't do it, and then one Serbian soldier winked at the other. One guy pulled us apart, and the other hit me with the butt of his gun so that we would let go. I fell on the ground, and he stamped me with his boot and injured my leg. I can hardly walk now, I'm an old woman. My husband and some other men were taken to a factory while we were getting on the buses. It was all women on the bus. Everyone had to give whatever they had left to the Serbs, who demanded valuables from us on the buses. My grandson, the last time he saw me, gave me his ring because he said that he might never see me again. They had taken him away earlier, but my granddaughter didn’t want to worry me at the time, so she didn’t tell me.\n\nSeveral witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki reported that the Bosnian Serbs took away boys younger than sixteen and older men in their seventies. Other men were separated from their families as they were boarding the buses or taken off the buses as they were driving to Kladanj.\n\nThere is also ample evidence indicating that many of the men taken from the Potocari camp were later killed. Several witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives saw bodies of men whose throats had been cut or who had been shot, lying in houses in the hills surrounding the camp.\n\nE.A. reported seeing the bodies of ten men who had previously been at the camp when she went looking for water. According to E.A.:\n\nA friend of mine, Majda, and I were sent to get water. We went to some nearby houses. In the first three or four houses there was no water, so we had to go further. When we arrived at the first house with water, we saw blood all over the place. The furniture inside was a mess. On our way back, we saw about ten bodies with their throats slashed; it was around 8:00 A.M. We walked back the same way we came, but we hadn't seen the bodies on the way there because we had been talking and we hadn't really paid attention to what was happening around us. But when we saw blood on the way back we began to look around a bit, and that's when we saw the bodies. I knew that these were men from the group of twenty taken away the night before, because I recognized some of the men and their clothes. We were frightened and went back to the circle. After that event, the Chetniks forbade us to go there for water; instead, they brought a water cistern down to us.\n\nOthers recounted similar experiences. One woman interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki reported that she had seen three to four bodies in a house. Another said she had seen altogether about fifty bodies, all of men and boys.\n\nInternational observers in Srebrenica also witnessed beatings and killings. Two international observers saw a man forcibly taken from a large group of people. A short time later they heard screams and upon investigation saw a Bosnian Serb soldier shoot the man in the head. International observers also saw a man being beaten with rifle butts and then dragged into a house. He then heard one shot and concluded that the man had been killed. Many witnesses said they heard screams in the middle of the night on Wednesday, July 12, 1995. International observers found nine or ten bodies dressed in civilian clothes lying near a creek. The bodies were all lying face down with their heads almost in the water. There appeared to be gunshot wounds in the back and sides of the bodies. Another witness had seen the ten men being taken in the direction of the creek. Two more international observers witnessed the same scene later in the day. Although a group of six to seven bodies in civilian clothes was reported to have been seen in another location, accounts vary as to whether the cause of death had been the cutting of throats or gunshot wounds.\n\nDutch peacekeeping troops evacuated from Srebrenica said on July 23 in Zagreb that Bosnian Serb soldiers executed at least ten Muslim defenders and abducted between 150 and 300 men between the ages of sixteen and sixty, of whom nine were executed in the house, shot in the back. The Dutch officers acknowledged that with Bosnian Serb soldiers restricting their movements and stealing their vehicles, they may have witnessed only a limited picture of what really happened.\n\nThe List of Missing Men and Boys from Potocari\n\nWhile in Tuzla, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives were told by I.O., a displaced person from Srebrenica, that a list had been compiled of Muslim men who had been in the Dutch compound at the U.N. base in Potocari. The list contains the names of 239 military-aged boys and men who had been at the base, had surrendered to the Bosnian Serbs, and are now missing. The list was compiled by a Muslim from Srebrenica who had been at the Potocari base. His wife and son are also missing. I.O. told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives that the list had been given to a Mr. Franken, a Dutch military officer at the Potocari compound. Mr. Franken reportedly told the Bosnian Serb soldiers that a list containing the names of the men and boys within the Potocari base had been compiled, that he retained a copy of that list, and that he would pass it on to “officials in Holland and Geneva” as a guarantee that the prisoners should not be mistreated by the Bosnian Serb forces.\n\nUpon arriving in Bosnian government-controlled territory, I.O. began to contact various government, human rights and humanitarian organizations in Geneva and the Netherlands only to be told that no one had heard of such a list. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representative then inquired with the Dutch Foreign Ministry about the existence of the list, but were told that it had no knowledge about the existence of such a list. However, following Human Rights Watch/Helsinki’s request, an internal inquiry within the Dutch government was conducted and the list was eventually found in the Dutch Defense Ministry. A copy was then forwarded to the Dutch Foreign Ministry, which subsequently sent a copy to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. A transcribed copy of the list appears as Appendix A of this report.\n\nIn the interim, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki learned that the U.N. peacekeeping mission’s headquarters in Zagreb reportedly also retained a copy of the list, if not the original. On September 13, 1995, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki sent a letter to Maj. Gen. Ton Kolsteren, the U.N. force’s chief of staff, asking whether the U.N. retained a copy of the list and whether it had raised the fate of the missing men and boys with Bosnian Serb officials. As of October 4, we had received no reply. We also sent a letter to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, appending a copy of the list and asking that the fate of these men and boys be raised with the Yugoslav/Bosnian Serb delegation during talks in Geneva on September 8. To date, we have not received a reply from the U.S. government regarding our letter.\n\nAlthough the Dutch press is questioning whether and why their Defense Ministry suppressed the list, no one appears to have inquired about the fate of the missing men and boys, with the exception of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been lobbying for access to detention centers controlled by Bosnian Serb forces.\n\nEvidence of Human Rights Abuses in Potocari Destroyed by Dutch Government\n\nAccording to a documentary aired on BBC2 in Britain on August 16, 1995, and an article published a week earlier by The Observer, the United Nations destroyed video footage showing scenes of U.N. troops standing by while Bosnian Serb forces organized the massacre of Muslim men at the U.N. base at Potocari. According to The Observer, a Bosnian Serb cameraman filmed some of the same scenes that U.N. troops in Srebrenica were known to have captured on video. The footage reportedly reveals Bosnian Serb soldiers wearing looted U.N. berets and flak jackets and U.N. soldiers standing by while Bosnian Serb troops separate men from women and children. The film also reportedly depicts “a group of Muslim men prisoners herded into a field as Bosnian Serb soldiers were readying their weapons and there the film goes to black.” General Hans Couzy, commander-in-chief of the Royal Netherlands Army, has admitted that the video footage “was destroyed” on his orders because it also identified Dutch troops.\n\nThe withholding of the aforementioned list and the destruction of video footage of certain atrocities, that were carried out in the presence of United Nations peacekeepers, deprived the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia of valuable evidence linking possibly identifiable perpetrators to their war crimes and denied Muslim families the opportunity to identify and possibly discover the fate of their missing relatives.\n\nTransport to Kladanj: Bosnian Serbs Terrorize Evacuees, Slaughter Fleeing Men and Boys\n\nBosnian Serb forces began transporting women, children and the elderly to the Bosnian government-controlled town of Kladanj on July 12. Approximately fifty buses and trucks were made ready by the Bosnian Serbs to transport Muslims from Potocari to the border of Bosnian Serb-held territory near Tisca. The drive lasted about two and one-half hours, via Bratunac and Vlasenica. The displaced persons were then forced to walk some six to eight kilometers across front lines to Bosnian government-held territory at Kladanj. Along the way the buses were frequently stopped by Bosnian Serb soldiers, who demanded money and jewelry. Bosnian Serb civilians stoned and harassed the passengers, calling them “Balije,” the derogatory term used to describe Muslims. Many men of military age who had attempted to make the trek through Bosnian Serb-held territory were captured along the way. Although the numbers varied, evacuees spotted many captured men en route to Tisca. T.T. reported seeing about 2,000 men rounded up about one kilometer from Konjevic Polje. According to T.T.:\n\nAs we drove through their territory, the Chetniks showed us the three-finger salute [used by the Serbs] and said things like \"Srebrenica is our territory ‑ get out of here you Balije.” Then as we drove on the Glogova road, I saw about seven young men; all of them had their throats cut. They were lying on the side of the road, and one of them was around the same age as my son. His head was lying on top of a bag, but you could see clearly that his throat had been cut. Then, near Konjevic Polje, I saw some other young men who I recognized from Srebrenica, but they were showing the three-finger Serb salute and one of them was holding a white shirt. I figured the Chetniks had found them in the forests and forced them to surrender. . . . The Chetniks were making them hold their three fingers up behind their heads as they led them up the hill. Then we came to Konjevic Polje, and they stopped the bus near a café bar. Three soldiers came onto the bus and told us to give them the youngest child on the bus so that they could slit his throat. In fact, he said “Give us your youngest Ustasa” ‑ not “child.” So they told us to give them all the money and jewelry we had. They said that those who didn’t hand it over would be taken from the bus and their breasts would be chopped off. They didn't do anything to us because all of us had something to give ‑ we gave some gold and some money. I think all in all they probably collected about 1,000 German marks from us. Then the bus driver was allowed to proceed. About one kilometer from Konjevic Polje — on the road to [Nova] Kasaba — I saw about 2,000 of our men who had been caught by the Chetniks in the forest. They had their hands tied above their heads. They were showing us the three-finger salute as well. They were all around the road and on the sides of the road. The _etniks were standing around them with their guns at ready, and they were all heading in the direction of [Nova] Kasaba.\n\nMany people said they saw smaller numbers of prisoners along the sides of the road. For example, E.A. said she saw about twenty prisoners standing in a field in Kravica and another fifty in Nova Kasaba. N.T., a twenty-six-year-old woman from Konjevic Polje, saw twenty prisoners in Kravica. Additionally, international observers and a displaced person reported that they saw between 300 and 500 men at a soccer stadium in Nova Kasaba. T.Y. from Pobuce confirmed that a large number of Muslim men were rounded up in the Nova Kasaba area:\n\nMy convoy was made up of seven buses. All along the roadsides, I saw corpses and captured men from Srebrenica walking with their hands behind their necks; especially when we were passing [Nova] Kasaba — there was a tremendous number of prisoners gathered around there. Many of the women in my bus recognized the men who were captured. Meanwhile, Chetniks were boarding our bus and looking for money or jewelry.\n\nSome people were forcibly removed from the buses during the journey. At one point, three elderly men were taken off one bus during a stop at Kravica. Nine women — mainly between the ages of fifteen and twenty — were taken off a bus at Bratunac. The fate of these persons remains unknown. N.P. from Likari told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives that during the trip from Potocari to Kladanj, the Serbs indiscriminately detained civilians from the groups being transported. According to N.P.:\n\nWe heard that some drivers were good and didn’t stop at all [to let Serbian soldiers on board], but ours did. Serbian civilians and soldiers alike climbed on board demanding anything valuable. I saw people being dragged off of the other vehicles in our convoy. We were terrified. Even when we arrived at our drop-off point in Tisca, groups of Chetniks there were calling out and looking for people from certain villages, places and towns. People were being dragged away to the sides of the road and out of view. A Chetnik grabbed me by the arm and told me to follow him behind a bus. I saw that nobody was going in that direction. He told me there was a handicapped person there who needed help. I was frightened, because I knew he was lying. He told me I’d be right back, but as soon as his attention shifted to someone else, I broke away and slipped into the crowd.\n\nIn addition to the prisoners, many passengers saw dead and mutilated bodies on the sides of the road. According to N.T.:\n\nWe arrived in Kravica and from the window as we drove by I saw two women and about twenty men who had been captured by the Serbs. The Serbs were standing there with their machine guns pointed at their heads. I recognized them from Srebrenica. I was looking to see if my husband or some of my brothers were in that group. They had their hands behind their heads, and their faces were all black and blue and bloody. When we arrived in Lolici, I saw that some of our captured people were sitting at the side of the road. Their backs were turned to us. They were beaten up too, and some of them were only in their underwear. Then at about 10:00 A.M. as the bus drove by slowly, I also saw about one hundred men dead on the side of the road. The bus was going towards Konjevic Polje. . . . There were a lot of corpses lying by the road in Konjevic Polje. Some were by the road and others near the creeks, but they were very near the bus and we could see them clearly. . .\n\nAt Kasaba there were about ten Chetniks. They had two boys captured who looked like they were only about ten to twelve years old. . . . The soldiers then told us that they had just made the two boys call out to their fathers in the forest. I didn't dare go out, because I knew they would capture me too. They were, nevertheless, yelling out towards the forests: \"We have your wives and children here. We will kill them unless you all surrender.\" Their guns were pointed towards the trees, because I guess they knew a lot of our guys were near. They told us to get out of the bus, because they were going to kill us all. My son was crying \"Daddy, daddy.\" We didn't get out of the bus. We just sat there for about half an hour. Then they gave up on us, and we started towards Kladanj.\n\nAnother witness whose transport was stopped in Kravica testified:\n\nThey said to us, “See your army?” Kneeling in the grass were many men I knew. They had their hands behind their necks. I saw one of my sons among them. But I could say nothing to him. I do not know if he saw me.\n\nAfter the buses made the journey, they let the refugees out at Tisca from where they walked across front lines to Kladanj in Bosnian government-held territory. Many of the refugees reported seeing dead bodies on the side of the road during the walk. N.N. reported her experience to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives:\n\nWe reached the end of the road, and he stopped the bus and let us out. We had to walk towards Kladanj. On the way, I saw them stop one woman and ask if she was a man dressed as a woman. When she said no, they laughed and asked her who would ever fuck her? As we were walking, I could see a lot of dead people by the side of the road. I saw a man with his throat cut, but he wasn't completely dead yet. He was still grasping for breath. The Chetniks told us to stay away from the sides of the road and not to go by the creek because it was dangerous. But they didn't want us to go there because there were dead bodies all around. I saw about four of them ‑ two of which were not completely dead. Some of our people went to the creek. When they came back, they said there were a lot of dead there as well.\n\nRape and Other Inhumane Treatment\n\nWomen were raped and sexually abused during the fall of Srebrenica, although the extent of such abuse remains unclear. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives only identified one victim of rape while conducting random interviews with those displaced from Srebrenica, but other international observers have reported other instances of sexual abuse. The victim Human Rights Watch/Helsinki spoke to had left Srebrenica on a bus with several wounded people. When she arrived at Tisca with the other refugees, she was taken from the bus and raped.\n\nIn another case, reported by a foreign journalist, a woman said she sat near twelve-year-old M.S. and fourteen-year-old F.S. — two girls she had known well — while she was awaiting transport in Potocari. Three Bosnian Serb soldiers passed through the factory about midnight on Tuesday, July 11, and abducted the two cousins, as well as twenty-three-year-old N.O. The witness said the soldiers were wearing United Nations uniforms and helmets, but their appearance, demeanor and fluency in the Serbian language made her certain they were Serbs. When the three returned several hours later, they reportedly were naked and covered with scratches and bruises, and the two young cousins were bleeding from the assault. “M. was crying the most. She was saying, ‘We are not girls anymore.’” Reportedly, there was no water to wash the blood off themselves, so they tried to wipe it off with clothes that people gave them. Near dawn on Wednesday, Bosnian Serb soldiers came searching for men. “They took some boys who were about ten or eleven. We never saw them again. Everyone was in a panic, trying to hide their boys. While this was going on, F. slipped off to the side, took a scarf, tied it around her neck and hanged herself from a beam. By the time we found her she was dead.”\n\nIn another case documented by another foreign reporter, two women described how they watched through half-closed eyes, pretending to be asleep, and hoping that they would not be next, as four Bosnian Serb soldiers raped a twenty-eight-year-old Muslim woman whom the soldiers selected from among those in Potocari. One of the witnesses — a nineteen-year-old woman — said she held one of her sister’s children in her arms, hoping that would make her a less likely candidate for abuse. “Two took [the victim’s] legs and raised them up in the air, while the third began raping her. Four of them were taking turns on her. People were silent, no one moved. She was screaming and yelling and begging them to stop. They put a rag into her mouth and then we just heard silent sobs coming from her closed lips.” The former U.N. special rapporteur on the former Yugoslavia reported that nine women between the ages of fifteen and twenty were taken off a bus at Bratunac and not seen again. Another foreign journalist interviewed witnesses who said they saw women and girls taken from trucks in Kravica.\n\nH.H., a fifty-five-year-old man from Fojhar, reported that civilians who were rounded up in Potocari were terrified, especially about disappearances, suicide, erratic behavior and the talk of rape. According to H.H.:\n\nI saw Chetniks leading young people away from Potocari. They were taking young girls and young men away from the “circle” and from the crowds gathered outside of it. I didn’t see any of them return during my stay in Potocari. I saw people going crazy, losing their minds, having nervous breakdowns. I asked some people what happened to one particular girl who looked like she lost her head; they told me she was raped. I saw about seven people who hanged themselves in the zinc factory — six men and one woman who, I was told, was raped.\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives also collected several accounts of injections being administered to the civilians in Potocari and men making the journey through the forest. N.N., one woman interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki reported that she had been given an injection while staying at a factory called “the 11th of March factory.” She reported that the injections caused her to have severe hallucinations.\n\nAfter hearing her testimony, a Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representative escorted N.N. to a medical tent run by the Bosnian government at the refugee camp. The doctor told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki that several patients had reported receiving injections of drugs, but could not recall specifically how many.\n\nTrek through Serbian-Controlled Territory\n\nAs Srebrenica was falling, the overwhelming majority of military-aged men and boys and a smattering of women and children gathered in a separate location in order to make a journey through Bosnian Serb-held territory to reach Bosnian government-controlled territory. The majority of the persons in this group were civilians; men and boys interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives stated that of the 12,000 to 15,000 trekkers, between 3,000 to 4,000 of whom were armed. These armed persons were primarily located in the front and brought up the rear while civilians and wounded filled the middle. Some of those in between were also armed, although the vast majority were not.\n\nMost men and boys of military age began grouping together and leaving the Srebrenica pocket in the evening and early morning of July 11 and 12. They formed a column, which stretched for approximately ten kilometers. The men had to walk in such a vulnerable formation because they had been warned of mined terrain. During the trek, the column was exposed to numerous attacks and ambushes by Bosnian Serb forces, during which violations of humanitarian law were committed. These included: attacks against civilian targets, indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force, and summary executions.\n\nAfter the U.N. failed to defend the “safe area” of Srebrenica, the enclave’s military-aged men no longer trusted the UNPROFOR/UNPF troops, nor did they believe their safety would be guaranteed. I.N., a twenty-year-old born in Gladovici in the municipality of Srebrenica, recounted that he decided to leave the “safe area” on his own after he found out that the U.N. could do nothing to protect the enclave and its residents:\n\nThe Chetniks bombed the civilian center every day from the beginning of the offensive on June 27 until the end when they came in. Everyone from the outlying areas of the city flooded down into Srebrenica around July 5 or 6; there was intense shelling. The Serbs advanced from the east, north and south, lighting up hamlets and villages as they got closer. We held out in the west, but they burned that area after Srebrenica had fallen. Since I had worked at a U.N. humanitarian distribution base before, I asked the Dutch why they weren’t protecting us and why there were no air strikes; they told me it was because the Serbs said they would slaughter their [U.N.] hostages who were now in Bratunac [if the U.N. attacked].\n\nJ.N., a man from Konjevic Polje - who was a logger before the war - described the atmosphere in the “safe area” on the last night in Srebrenica during the planning phase of the trek:\n\nThe Serbs were already in the town, so the men tried to escape through the forest. I said goodbye to my wife and kids and went to meet up with the other men. We went to the big circle where the U.N. was, to wait for transportation to Tuzla. The boys and men first went to Lipa hill to discuss with everyone what our strategy would be. We called that route “the way of life and death.” We realized that we had no other choice and that many of us would die. But this way maybe at least some of us would survive. If we surrendered to the Serbs, then we surely had no hope.\n\nFrom that hill we could see everything that was going on in town. Then we saw a column of tanks, transporters and different kinds of vehicles in Bibici ‑ about one kilometer from Srebrenica. The Chetnik vehicles were placed along the whole road from Bibici to Srebrenica, and we could see the Chetniks shelling the villages all around. They used the kind of shells that explode into fire. The houses began burning as soon as they were hit. The Chetniks were shelling exactly those areas with the most people.\n\nDuring the day, thousands of men arrived at Lipa. At about 6:00 P.M. we headed out towards Tuzla. There were maybe about 15,000 of us.\n\nJ.T., a thirty-seven-year-old miner from Srebrenica, gave a similar account of the departure:\n\nIn the evening about 8:00 or 9:00 P.M., about 15,000 men all met at Jaglici. There were even some women and children there who either wanted to go with their men or did not trust the Serbs to transport them safely. We had to decide whether or not to go to Cepa or Tuzla, but finally decided to go to Tuzla. At about 5:15 A.M., my sector headed towards Konjevic Polje. We headed out in one column of two-by-two rows, and I was in the first section at about the 153rd position.\n\nThe men and boys began the journey by making their way through a forest in a column-like fashion. During the first section of the trek, while they were still in so-called “safe-area” territory, they experienced shelling and grenading, but no direct ambushes or assaults. However, during the second part of the journey, the column of men and boys was exposed to direct ambushes, as well as shelling.\n\nJ.C., born in May 1952, in Pomol in the municipality of Vlasenica, recounted that Bosnian Serb forces knew the men and boys from Srebrenica would attempt to escape through enemy territory:\n\nThe first of us left Jaglici at 4:30-5:00 A.M. on July 12. Scouts went out first to see what kind of conditions were up ahead; the column of men followed shortly. The Chetniks knew we were going to head for Bosnian government-controlled territory from Jaglici, so they shot at us, threw grenades at us, and kept on shouting to us - most of the time through bullhorns - “We know you are going to try and pass through with your column! Better for you to go to Potocari and leave with the buses!” My section of the column departed at 12:30 P.M.\n\nJ.N. was situated at the front of the column and described the departure:\n\nI was in the first group with about 1,000 people, because I knew the terrain pretty well. We passed the first _etnik bunkers without a lot of problems, and in the morning we arrived near Kamenica. Those at the end of the column had a lot more problems, because the Serbs allowed a large portion of us in to penetrate their lines and then they began to ambush the middle. While we were stuck at Kamenica, all the wounded were being brought to a place nearby. We stayed there for the rest of the day and the night. After a while, we realized that we had to move, one way or another, or else we were surely dead. The Serbs knew this, too, so they just waited. They had squeezed everyone into one small spot near Kamenica. After we walked about 500 meters, the Serbs began shooting everywhere. I remember a tree falling down and killing more than twenty people at one point. I'm sure more that 2,000 people were killed from shooting and shelling there.\n\nSerb tanks were placed all along the route from Kravica to Konjevic Polje up to the intersection at Konjevic Polje. My brother and I saw people falling down. Dead and wounded were all around. We were simply running without knowing where we were going. One shell fell near me, and I was terrified. That's when my brother and I separated. I haven't seen him since. There were people all around who were shot in the legs, arms, stomach. I saw so many bodies. At this point, the Serbs were all along the road from Kravica to Konjevic Polje preventing us from crossing. We were trying to find our way through from the village Krajinovici to Kaldrumica road, but the Chetniks were waiting for us. Their APCs and tanks were placed all along the road. When we realized that there was no way we could cross, we decided to retreat towards Nova Kasaba.\n\nJ.T. described what he saw after an initial section of the column was attacked:\n\nWe went through the forest and then down by a creek. There were Chetniks on both sides. Almost immediately we began to hear detonations up ahead. They were shelling the people who had left before us. In any case, we had to keep going, and after about 700 or 800 meters, we came to an area where there were a lot of dead and wounded. My wife's brother was among the dead. We tried to cover them with leaves, because we didn't have time to make a grave, but we couldn't do them any justice.\n\nAs we approached a creek we were elated because we thought we would be able to drink some water. But then we saw all the dead bodies, and I couldn't even think about taking a drink. I think what happened was that the first group had come down to the creek to get some water when the shells landed there and killed all those people. The bodies were lying all over the place like little pieces of wood.\n\nP.I., a thirty-five-year-old man from Suceska in the Srebrenica municipality, stated:\n\nBy the time we reached Siljkovici/Buljim mountain we had already been shelled by grenades, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns [PRAGAs and PAMs]. The Chetniks tried to cut the column up as much as they could. In a meadow in the middle of a forest at Siljkovici, we sat down to take a rest at around 3:00 P.M. There we decided to wait until dark to cross the road at Konjevic Polje. About thirty of our badly wounded people had to be left near a stream. Complete chaos erupted when thousands of us started to depart. Suddenly there was a burst of weapons fire, and some rockets fell into the meadow. PRAGAs and PAMs started to hammer from all sides. There was massive panic among the thousands of us. It was completely dark. There were weapons firing from all sides, and many people were being killed.\n\nPicking up and carrying as many of the wounded as they could, the men and boys continued to move ahead, but the chaos, panic and disarray produced by the ambushes caused large segments of the column to break apart and split into smaller groups and individuals. Survivors of the trek described to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives how Bosnian Serb ambushes repeatedly cut the column into segments. Many of those fleeing became hysterical with terror and lost all emotional control, others decided to surrender, or as mentioned below, commit suicide. Also, people who were located in the back of the column recounted how they found piles of corpses of people who had been in the front and middle of the columns, littered along the terrain, near streams, rivers and meadows. Many had slit throats. I.N. vividly described the horrific ordeal which the men and boys experienced:\n\nOn July 12, around 11:00 A.M., I left Srebrenica with approximately 6,000 to 7,000 men. Our scouts told us to leave by walking in two columns because everything in the area was mined. We were so vulnerable to ambushes — walking in two long columns like that — but it was the only thing we could do to avoid getting blown up [by mines]. Around 5,000 to 6,000 men had left already, and they were already approximately fifty to seventy kilometers ahead of us. After about three kilometers, we encountered our first ambush at a stream. The center of our column was hit by anti-aircraft machine guns [PAMs] and mortars; around 200 people died just from that. The Chetniks then came down from the hills, and about 2,000 men from the middle of the column got caught in the line of fire. The people at the front and back of the columns scattered everywhere. I was in the middle and saw how the Serbs were shooting everyone and slaughtering us with bayonets. These soldiers were not local Bosnian Serb soldiers who looked more like paramilitary bands; these soldiers must have come over from Serbia, because they were all wearing black uniforms with white bands on their necks. I managed to escape to a stream where I saw about fifty bodies; from there I tried to go to Kravica. At one point on the way I saw - about 200 meters in front of me - about one hundred people yelling “Don’t shoot! We give up” and giving themselves up to the Chetniks who rounded them up and took them away. I turned into a forest and ran into about thirty guys. We wandered around and after a while, we ran into a large group of about 3,000.\n\nT.I., a sixty-three-year-old from Cerska, stated:\n\nEven though I am sixty-three years old and was supposed to leave Srebrenica with the women, children and elderly on the buses and trucks, I was picked to follow our men out of Srebrenica, because I had a horse and could help transport some of the wounded. I think everyone who had a horse and could move the wounded was told to come along, because there were others. On July 11 or 12, I left in a column of about 5,000 to 6,000 people — civilians and soldiers from age twelve, thirteen and up. The guy I had to transport had a head wound and a hand injury. We were heading out towards Pobudze-Kamenica.\n\nWe walked for about twenty-four hours. Then our column began to diminish, because people were breaking off and running into the woods and mountains individually and in little groups. Along the way we saw bodies, wounded people and a few who had just lost their minds. We encountered our first ambush near Nova Kasaba. We were in the woods, where our column had to stop and leave our wounded. The Chetniks started shelling the woods with mortars and calling for us to come out and give up. They told us that they would send the elderly to their families and that they would keep the younger men for exchanges. When we realized we were surrounded, people from the column started killing themselves, committing suicide; some threw themselves on top of grenades, others shot themselves in the mouth and others were shooting themselves in order to wound themselves in the hope that maybe their injury would somehow save them after they were captured by the Chetniks. We ended up surrendering.\n\nDuring the nighttime and during the ambushes, Bosnian Serb soldiers in civilian clothing managed to infiltrate the column — spreading disinformation and confusion, giving wrong directions, injecting men with what were believed to have been hallucinatory drugs, drawing groups and individuals away from the column, and killing people from within the column. I.N. continued with his account:\n\nAfter a while I carefully got up and looked around. There was about 200 dead bodies lying around me. I listened carefully. I didn’t know where I was. Then I heard someone talking, and I. . . realized there were about a thousand of our guys. Again - just as before - we got into columns and walked, but by now almost none of us had weapons left. We carried the wounded and injured from the first and second ambush in woolen blankets. I had to leave the wounded guy I was carrying at the side of the road; I couldn’t carry him anymore. He was about a twenty-year-old kid.\n\nAs night fell, we saw groups of men merging into our column. I saw unfamiliar faces; one of them started saying, “Hurry up with the wounded! Hurry up with the wounded!” All of a sudden we realized that the unfamiliar men were Chetniks who had infiltrated our column. There was a lot of them, about 300. They ordered us to leave the injured and wounded at the side of the road, while their men started giving them injections and making them swallow some kind of pills. Later, people who were at the end of our column said that the injured and wounded people looked like they were dying after they were injected or forced to swallow the pills.\n\nAll of a sudden, in all that chaos, we noticed that the chetniks had suddenly disappeared; panic erupted. We were all in a meadow, when shooting suddenly erupted from a hill behind us. I ran for the woods right away. The Chetniks came out into the meadow and started to kill and slaughter everyone they could. I ran about 500 meters with about twenty guys towards a creek when suddenly three grenades emitting red fire and smoke dropped in front of us. My eyes, nose and mouth started stinging. I thought it was some kind of poison, and for the first time, I became really frightened that I was going to die. Fortunately, a wind started carrying the smoke up the hill, so I turned downhill with about five guys. The stinging lasted for about half an hour. We descended to a creek where we heard running water. We wanted to go in, but we saw about twenty massacred bodies floating in it, some decapitated.\n\nJ.C. gave a similar account of the “infiltration tactic” used by Bosnian Serb forces:\n\nThe Chetniks who had mixed into our column started telling us that they knew the way to safety. Many small groups broke off from our larger group of about 2,000 to follow these men - faces I had never seen before in Srebrenica. These unknown men told our guys to take the wounded with them; we never saw any of those wounded men again.\n\nI came out onto a meadow near the village of Krajnovici where I found my cousin, Ibrahim Mujicic, and a friend. There, we were ambushed by the Chetniks; they started slaughtering our men. The three of us ran to the bank of a creek to hide. During the ambush, three other men crawled up to us; one with a rifle and the other two with knives. One of them suddenly took Ibrahim by the beard and cut his throat. They got my friend, too. I jumped into the creek and ran about thirty meters while they shot at me. I hid in the bushes, and fifteen minutes later I saw them looking for me. They kept on saying, “He must be here somewhere.” One of the Chetniks walked about half a meter away from me; I was extremely frightened. They searched the area all day for other escapees as well. I remember that one of the Chetniks said, “I mostly killed the wounded.” I didn’t hear that much shooting from the meadow, so I think most of our men there were slaughtered with knives just like Ibrahim was. I remained hidden until late that night, until I thought that everyone had left the area. I started to walk across the meadow - which was about 500 meters long - and must have seen about 200 corpses there - most of them slaughtered. I headed for the forest, walked through it, and came upon the Kravica river, which I crossed.\n\nJ.T.’s account of Bosnian Serb soldiers infiltrating the column closely corroborates I.T.’s and J.C.’s:\n\nAs we continued, we saw hundreds of dead people. Everyone was just trying to save themselves. Some were killed by shells, others by bullets. Then the Chetniks began infiltrating our column. They were dressed in civilian clothes so of course at first we couldn't tell if they were our guys or not. They were killing our people, sometimes with wires and sometimes with a knife by slitting their throats. They didn't want to use guns because it would make noise and they did not want to draw attention to themselves.\n\nA thirty-year-old bus conductor, from the Vlasenica area, G.I., witnessed how people in the column were being given injections at random by the Bosnian Serb infiltrators. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives collected many testimonies in which men and boys gave similar accounts:\n\nThe Chetniks were among us in the column. They were also in civilian clothes so we couldn't tell who was one of us and who was one of them. One of them was carrying water, and they had needles for injections with them. They began shoving the needles into people and injecting them. A lot of people around me were going crazy and acting very strange. They were having hallucinations. They were saying things like, “What a pretty rose that is,\" or “what a pretty cucumber.\" The Chetniks were offering water to us, too, pretending that they were one of us. Some of them fell for it. I had a feeling they were Chetniks, because this one guy, who said he was Admir from Cepa, had brand-new sneakers on and he was clean-shaven. They weren't nervous at all. They would lure people away from the columns by offering water to them and saying that they knew the way to go.\n\nN.T., a forty-year-old man originally from Bratunac, described what he saw as a systematic tactic: “The Chetniks continually shelled the columns in order to kill as many men as possible, but the shelling also diverted our attention from the infiltrators.” He recounted how his part of the column was also ambushed from “the inside”:\n\nThe column and the forest through which we were moving were shelled by the Chetniks at random the whole way. At around 3:00 P.M. that day, the column stopped in the forest so we could wait for the end of the column to catch up. We waited until about 6:00 P.M. At around 7:00 P.M., we headed out again and encountered the largest ambush near Pobuce near Kravica. It happened around 8:30 P.M., when it got dark. We were hit by anti-aircraft guns [PRAGAs] from Kravica, while Chetniks, who had infiltrated into our column earlier, suddenly opened fire on us from within the column. Everyone just dove to the ground; it was complete chaos; nobody knew what was going on, everyone was panicking, and there were massive casualties. The ambush lasted for about ten to fifteen minutes. Then the shooting stopped, and it was completely dark; we had to regroup and collect all the wounded. Everyone was screaming and shouting amidst the chaos. We ended up taking the lightly wounded with us and leaving the heavily wounded behind.\n\nAs the ambushes and infiltrating Bosnian Serbs continued to pick away at the column, men and boys tried desperately to regroup after the ambush. During the day, the men and boys stopped along the way to allow stragglers to catch up and to figure out who the infiltrators were. N.P., a twenty-five-year-old from Lehovici in the municipality of Srebrenica, described the exhaustion and extremity to which the victimized men were pushed:\n\nAt dawn, the thirteen of us headed out. One of the men in the group was from Pobude and suggested that we head toward Kamenica, since he was familiar with that area. We made it to his village sometime in the morning of July 13. It was completely burned. On the way there, we ran across two wounded men - one of them had his leg blown off. They were good friends, and the former did not want to leave his partner at all. He begged us to call the Serbs so that his friend could get medical help. We told him that he was crazy - that the Chetniks would surely execute them. Anyway, he didn’t want to leave his immobile friend and go with us. He said, “We’ll stay together no matter what; even if we have to die together. We have two guns, and if no one comes for us we’ll shoot each other.” So we left them and pushed on.\n\nN.T. gave an account of psychological exhaustion and paranoia gripping the men:\n\nWhen we arrived at Ljiplje at around 2:00 P.M., we were ambushed by anti-aircraft gun [PRAGA] and anti-aircraft machine gun [PAM]fire from a fortification, and again, by Chetniks within our group who opened fire. The attack lasted for about an hour; we all ran for low ground, took cover and then ran toward the forest. That night, the Chetniks started infiltrating our group again. But some of us were more guarded now; trying to see whether anyone recognized these people who announced that they knew the way or where the Chetniks were hiding. This time we caught one of them and killed him immediately when he couldn’t answer some of the more detailed questions about “his history” in Srebrenica. It was a torturous state of mind to be in; no one knew whom to trust.\n\nThe column eventually became smaller and smaller in number, and smaller groups were left behind and separated from the rest. Many men and boys surrendered, and several witnesses told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives that they saw unarmed men shot in the process of surrendering.\n\nAfter running into a number of other stragglers from the column, I.N. recounted the following:\n\nWe made our way back to the main road where we came upon another group of corpses, between 200 and 220, which looked like they were killed with grenades. They didn’t have bullet wounds, but it looked as if they were all torn up, like they were killed with shrapnel. We spent the next two days and nights walking through the forest, where we could follow the main road but not be seen by the Chetniks. In that time, we must have seen about one hundred men coming down from the forest, onto the road, so they could give themselves up; but they were all being killed. We kept on walking for four days and four nights until we arrived at Krizevici. Finally, I passed Chetnik lines and crossed over into Memici in Kalesija around 9:00 A.M. and ran into a few Bosnian soldiers who showed me their I.D. cards and gave me a pack of cigarettes with a ljiljan on it. I knew then that I had made it to Bosnian government-controlled territory.\n\nWhen we were sneaking past all these villages in Chetnik-controlled territories in eastern Bosnia, the amazing thing is that, in the area that had been “ethnically cleansed” of Muslims, there were no Serbian civilians. All the Muslim villages are burned out and empty. You can tell they haven’t been inhabited for a long time, because the grass is overgrown and in some places as tall as me. The only things we had to worry about were Chetnik patrols and groups of soldiers that were traveling back and forth looking for us; they were everywhere. The other thing I noticed during our trek through Chetnik territory was that, many times, as we listened to Chetnik patrols and guards, many of the soldiers spoke with Krajina accents; they had distinct Croatian accents.\n\nThe Massacre Sites\n\nHuman Rights Watch/Helsinki conducted interviews with a witness to a massacre in Kaldrumica (in the Nova Kasaba-Konjevic Polje area), and with four persons who were detained by Bosnian Serb forces and later sent to mass executions at two sites in the Karakaj area (a town north of Zvornik on the Bosnian-Serbian border).
