        "text": "Sarajevo culture\n\nSarajevo is probably most famous for its multiculturality and for being known as the Jerusalem of Europe.\n\nNowhere else in Europe nor World you will find such diversity in all aspects of life as you will in Sarajevo.\n\nOne of the most popular sights in Sarajevo is a meeting of cultures spot. That spot literarily marks a meeting of the two most influential cultures in Sarajevo, Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian.\n\nWhen you stand on the meeting of cultures mark and you look to your east you will see Istanbul and when you look to your west, you will see Vienna.\n\nIn approximately 500 meters walk from Sebilj, on Baščaršija square to Sarajevo Cathedral, you will be able to see at least three different sacral objects. You will see a Mosque, a Catholic Church, and Orthodox Church. If you try a little harder, you will also see a Jewish Synagogue. Have you ever been to a city as special as Sarajevo?\n\nFacts to know about Sarajevo culture\n\nDo you know that in the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina which is, as you might think, located in Sarajevo, find one of the oldest Jewish sacred books? Yes, indeed you can. It is called Sarajevo Haggadah. Do you know that Sarajevo has a mosque that is the first electrified mosque in the World? Do you know that the construction of the Orthodox Church was approved by Ottoman Sultan and financed by the citizens of Sarajevo?\n\nWhen we speak about more recent cultural facts, we should point out a fact that Nobel Prize winner and probably most famous writer in Bosnia and Herzegovina ever had, Ivo Andrić attended high school in Sarajevo. Also, the second Nobel Prize winner connected to Bosnia and Herzegovina, well-known chemist, Vladimir Prelog, was born and raised in Sarajevo, and in fact, due to his importance to the city, there is a street named after him in one of the Sarajevo neighbourhoods.\n\nSarajevo music scene\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Sarajevo culture is music. Even though Sarajevo wasn’t the capital of Former Yugoslavia, among the citizens of the former republic it was called the capital, and that was because of the music. It is well known that Sarajevo was the most influential city in the Balkans in the 20th century.\n\nFrom our traditional music, Sevdalinka (it is similar to Portuguese Fado) and a great example of Sevdalika is notably the most popular song – Kad ja pođoh na Bentbašu (When I went to Bentbaša) which is in some way, unofficial city anthem, to pop and rock in Yugoslavia, Sarajevo was the centre of attention.\n\nMost notable bands from the Sarajevo pop-rock scene, Bijelo Dugme and Indexi are arguably the greatest Yugoslav rock bands of all time. Also, other bands and performers are considered “greats” and “legends”, such as Crvena Jabuka, Plavi Orkestar, Zabranjeno Pušenje, and others.\n\nSolo artists such as Kemal Monteno and Dino Merlin also gained much prominence. Sarajevo Ljubavi Moja (Sarajevo Love of Mine) is another unofficial anthem of Sarajevo and it was written and performed by Kemal Monteno. It was his way to express his love for his hometown.\n\nYES, Sarajevo is a safe place to travel to.\n\nEven though politics make an impact on this matter, people live here peacefully.\n\nIt is true that people’s nationality is the main reason why the situation can be a little tense between nations who battled a war in the 90s.\n\nThere is no war here, even if the news portals are constantly exaggerating the “situation in Bosnia” to make it seem much more unstable than it really is.\n\nWhat can we advise you to do as a tourist? While travelling, rather google for answers than dare to ask the locals for their opinion on the war.\n\nWhy do we say this? Here, everyone will tell their side of the story and you will lack the objective truth.\n\nPersonal safety\n\nSame as visiting other cities, we advise you to take safe paths, more frequent streets and enlightened areas. Sarajevo can be a little dangerous if you stray into the dark. This in particular is important to women travelling alone or in small groups.\n\nSo, if you have doubts is Sarajevo safe? Hopefully, we clarified your question.\n\nGazi Husrev Bey’s Mosque and Clock Tower\n\nBey’s Mosque\n\nThe Bey’s Mosque was built in 1531 and is currently one of the most important monuments of sacral Islamic architecture in the Balkans. It is an endowment of the ruler Gazi Husrev Bey and was designed by the chief architect of the Ottoman Empire, Ajem Esir Ali. The entire mosque complex has been declared a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nClock Tower Sarajevo\n\nThe specific timekeeping used by this clock tower is referred to as the “ala Turca” time and its distinct feature is showing midnight at the moment of sunset. This label was predominantly used in the 19th century Balkans when the Ottoman empire was disappearing from the region and a new, modern culture was making inroads into the territory once called European Turkey. The term ” ala Turca” referred to all the things pertaining to the Ottoman (Turkish) empire and “ala Franca” referred to the modern (Frankish) European culture, dress code, music, etc.\n\nAlthough this clock is actually connected to the time of sunset many people believe it is a lunar clock tower. The lunar clock is usually part of an astronomical clock showing phases of the moon (new moon, full moon) and has a dial indicating numbers 1 to 30. Many such clocks can still exist throughout Europe, from the astronomical clock in Prague to Le Gros Horloge in Rouen.\n\nThe Sarajevo clock tower is not related to the moon in any way but since Muslims all over the world are following a lunar calendar (at-taqwīm al-hijrī) people believe the clock itself is also a lunar one. In fact, the clock has 12 dials and shows midnight at the exact moment of sunset which is the moment when one day ends and another day begins in Islamic tradition. Five minutes on this clock correspond to five minutes on our modern clocks, the only difference being the starting point of the timekeeping.\n\nThe Spring of river Bosna\n\nThe Spring of river Bosna is the most beautiful natural oasis in the Sarajevo suburbs. It is located approximately 15 kilometres from the city centre and the best way to reach the spring is by car or taxi since the tram line to Ilidža is currently under reconstruction.\n\nThe entrance fee per person is 2BAM (around 1€) and one can really enjoy a natural and green environment, birds, swans, fishes etc.\n\nYou will be able to see the spring, take memorable pictures or even get a refreshment or something to eat in nearby restaurants.\n\nAdditional info: In case you are interested, you are able to take a ride on a horse carriage and you will agree on a price with the driver. That can be an unique experience.\n\nYellow Fortress\n\nAhh, one of the best vantage points in the beautiful city of Sarajevo, this fortress will take your breath away. It was built in the mid-18th century and it was part of the defensive walls of old town Vratnik. This fortress held a very important function, but it lost its purpose when Austro-Hungarians took over the city. Since it’s on high ground, when you climb on top of it, you have Sarajevo city in the palm of your hand.\n\nYou can also sit in a wonderful cafe and take your time enjoying the vantage point. Another specific thing you can find in that fortress is medieval cannon. You read it right, a cannon. And it’s still in use.\n\nCannon is used 30 times per year, during the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims are fasting, shooting from that cannon is a sign that they can break their fast. It’s shot at the sunset. Important note: Don’t touch the cannon! Besides that don’t lean over the edges there’s no fence.\n\nWhite Fortress\n\nThe White Bastion is a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located at an altitude of 667 meters and its walls are the remnants of the old town of Vratnik, which protected the eastern entrance to the city. It was built around 1550 during Ottoman rule. The bastion offers a fascinating view of the entire city of Sarajevo and is an ideal place for photography.\n\nThe best way to get to the White Fortress is by taxi from Baščaršija. The ride itself should not take more than 5 minutes and it should cost 5 BAM (2.5€) max.\n\nIf you for some reason opt to go by foot, it will take you 20 minutes to half an hour walk, and you should take into consideration that the incline is really high.\n\nBeware that sometimes White Fortress may be closed to the public, but usually, working hours are from 10:00 AM to 04:00 PM.\n\nTake a ride by cable car to Trebevic mountain\n\nCable car by definition is a must in every city, but in Sarajevo, it is added value, and because of it, it has to be on everyone’s things to do on Sarajevo list. After 26 years this Cable car is once again, fully functional. Why is it so unique?\n\nThis cable car was quite popular before the siege of Sarajevo, and when it was destroyed, part of the city’s soul was destroyed with it. You can only imagine how locals were happy to find out that the Cable car will once again become a lively place with many local and foreign people. Every car cabin is equipped with cameras and all of them are pet-friendly.\n\nAs for the price, the cost of a one-way ticket for tourists is 15 KM, and the return ticket costs 20KM. In case you have a bike with you, you will be charged 4KM extra. While at the top of the mountain Trebević you can walk around and enjoy the clean air and beautiful panoramic point of view. You can also walk around the Olympic bobsled track.\n\nImagine going on the rollercoaster while having a panoramic view of Sarajevo?\n\nExactly that can be found on Trebevic mountain. It will be one hour walk if you decide to walk from the Trebevic Cable Car exit on Trebevic mountain to the Sunnyland. On the other hand, if you call a taxi, you will be there in 10 minutes. Besides an incredible rollercoaster experience, you will be able to eat delicious food and take memorable pictures of Sarajevo, since all of the Sunnyland complexes is overlooking Sarajevo.\n\nWant to have an incredible experience in an award-winning hotel?\n\nIt is only 20 minutes walk from the Cable Car on Trebevic mountain to Pino Nature hotel, or 5 minutes if you opt to go via taxi. It is one of the most prominent hotels in Sarajevo and it will for sure blow you away with its architecture and gastronomic offer as well.\n\nGo to Brus recreational centre\n\nIn case you are a nature enthusiast, take a walk and explore Trebevic nature, overlook Sarajevo, and take amazing and memorable pictures on your way to Brus recreational centre. It only takes 30 minutes to walk from the Trebevic Cable Car exit to Brus. By the way, you will purify your lungs, experience mesmerizing sceneries and create incredible memories. Also. when you arrive, a Brus restaurant will be there waiting for you with their amazing gastronomic offer and all other facilities at your disposal.\n\nRide the tram around Sarajevo\n\nRide tram around the city is one of the most adventurous things to do in Sarajevo. You are probably wondering, “Is this person sane? How can the usage of public transport be adventurous?” Well, here’s a thing, if you go to Berlin or Istanbul or any other city with a fancy transportation system, it won’t be an adventure. Just a normal ride to your destination.\n\nHere sitting in a tram and riding the entire round through the city is unquestionably an adventure. The trams are quite loud and very old. You will often hear locals say that they are “from the Austro-Hungarian period”. If you are looking for experience please enjoy loud trams.\n\nCan the power go out? Will it stop all of a sudden? Will it take the wrong turn and go to the station instead of going to the other side of the city? You never know. One tram ticket is 1.60KM (if you buy it outside of the team at local stores you can find it at almost every tram stop) and 1.80KM if you buy it from the drivers.\n\nGo hiking\n\nSarajevo hiking trails are a very special and interesting activity for travellers around the world. Hiking in Bosnia offers you an incredible experience because Bosnia and Sarajevo in particular offer you an incredible mountain ambience just a few kilometres outside the city centre. Most people, even in Sarajevo, don’t know what beauty their city holds. Most of the hiking routes are really easy so you don’t need to be an experienced hiker to visit and explore them.\n\nIt is quite incredible to go hiking just 10 kilometres outside the city and on the hiking route to be in a position to visit 1 out of 13 Bobsleigh tracks in the world, right? That is exactly what you can experience while hiking in Sarajevo and its surrounding.\n\nChoose to hike to the mesmerizing village and one of the most picturesque locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina – Lukomir, Olympic mountain Trebevic or waterfall Skakavac.\n\nAttend Sarajevo Film Festival\n\nThe greatest film festival in this part of Europe happens exactly in Sarajevo. Amazing, right? All Sarajevans are really proud to host the Sarajevo Film Festival (SFF) for almost 27 years.\n\nThis festival really transforms the city into an epicentre of southeastern Europe because of the noisy nightlife, amazing events, and crowdy streets. If you happen to visit Sarajevo during SFF, make sure to visit the city centre. You will get a chance to sit and drink in an open bar and feel the festive atmosphere, especially in two streets: “Zelenih beretki” and “Branilaca Sarajeva” which are basically one next to each other. The main event usually occurs behind the entrance of the National Theatre, Susan Sontag square.\n\nSarajevo Film Festival happens usually around the 15th of August and if you choose to visit the event you will maybe get a chance to see some of the most popular movie stars. SFF until now hosted Robert De Niro, Angelia Jolie, Brad Pitt, Daniel Craig, Kevin Spacey etc.\n\nGo shopping\n\nHave a fun time shopping in Sarajevo! You can choose between shopping for souvenirs, artisan products related to Sarajevo’s culture or shopping for some nice piece of clothing.\n\nThe most popular place for tourists is Gazi Husrev Bay’s Bezistan, Baščaršija square and especially Kazandžiluk street due to its instagrammable scenery.\n\nWhere to buy souvenirs in Sarajevo?\n\nThe best places to buy souvenirs are small shops in Baščaršija. Best Sarajevo Souvenir is usually pictures or motifs made on the copper base which are mainly made by coppersmiths. Those are handmade products that can make a really great memory of Sarajevo. Another suggestion is to buy a traditional “džezva” – coffee pot for making a traditional Bosnian coffee which usually comes in set with “fildžan” – a small coffee cup to drink from it. Most of them have beautiful motifs and decorations and they will always remind you of Sarajevo. One can also find handmade woollen socks or Bosnian carpets which have a great resemblance to Persian ones.\n\nSo, when you come to Sarajevo, make sure to read our What to see in Sarajevo | Amazing local guide for 2022.
