        "text": "Donald Romain Davis (born February 4, 1957) is an American composer, conductor and orchestrator.\n\nA native from California, he was interested in music very early on, learning to play the trumpet at the age of nine and started to write short pieces by twelve. It was, above all, the jazz and rock genres that attracted him.\n\nAfter high school, he joined the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and continued his studies in composition with Henri Lazarof. Besides this, he learned orchestration with Albert Harris, who, during their sessions, presented him to the composer Joe Harnell (composer of the miniseries V). He helped Don Davis in his job search. His first job was a collaborative effort with composer Mark Snow on the series Hart to Hart. He was also an additional orchestrator for Michael Kamen on Die Hard 2: Die Harder.\n\nHe was primarily a composer for television series, until the young brothers Wachowsky (The Matrix trilogy) chose him to do the soundtrack of their film Bound, which was a little box office success. This is the film that allowed Don Davis to become the composer for The Matrix trilogy, his greatest work, firmly in conjunction with other compositions, by his atonal and avant-garde features.\n\nHe is also the composer of the soundtrack of the third Jurassic Park, recommended to the filmmakers by John Williams himself.\n\nOfficial site: http://www.dondavis.net/\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
