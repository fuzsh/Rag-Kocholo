Also in this series, we profile Republican candidate Laurie Buckhout.\n\nBen Adams\n\nThis post is part of a series examining where 2024 candidates running for public offices in the Southeast stand on key energy and climate issues. Note: The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy does not support or oppose candidates or political parties. Links to reports, candidate websites, and outside sources are provided as citizen education tools.\n\nIn this blog post, we examine the policies and positions of Don Davis, Democratic Party candidate running for reelection to represent North Carolina Congressional District 1 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Also in this series, we profile Republican candidate Laurie Buckhout. Election Day is November 5, 2024.\n\nBorn and raised in Snow Hill, North Carolina, Davis served eight years in the US Air Force. He also worked as an assistant professor of Aerospace Studies at East Carolina University instructing national security affairs and leadership courses, and later became mayor of Snow Hill at age 29. Beginning in 2008, he served six terms as a North Carolina State Senator.\n\nIn 2022, Davis was elected to the U.S. Congress representing his home community, eastern North Carolina. He lives in Greene County, NC, with his wife and three sons.\n\nRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency\n\nDon Davis has helped secure two federal grants for Carolina Poultry Power, a company that converts poultry litter waste into energy.\n\nClimate Change\n\nDon Davis has voted in favor of expanding research into carbon sequestration, and against repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Methane Emissions Reduction Program provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nDavis has also voted to criticize the idea of a carbon tax.\n\nElectric Transportation\n\nAs a Congressman, Don Davis has acted against the growth of electric vehicles. He voted to limit the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate emissions from motor vehicles. He also voted to denounce a federal rule facilitating the growth of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.\n\nEnergy Equity and Energy Burden\n\nDon Davis’ campaign website includes a promise to fight for a better environment in his district, stating that “Air and water pollution and the impacts of the climate crisis often disproportionately impact our poorest families, working-class communities, and communities of color, who are more likely to live in areas where air and water pollution exceed national standards.”\n\nHigh-Risk Energy: Coal, Nuclear, Oil, Gas\n\nDon Davis has taken actions that both support and constrain high-risk energy sources.\n\nAs a Congressman, he voted to preserve federal regulations on the exporting of Liquid Natural Gas. He also voted against a sweeping bill that would have supported fossil fuel industries while getting rid of fossil fuel regulations and clean energy programs.\n\nHe voted in favor of the Restoring American Energy Dominance Act, which repeals constraints on oil and gas extraction on federal lands. He also voted in favor of requirements to accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear reactors.\n\nVoter Information\n\nElection Day is November 5. Here are important dates and deadlines to consider, from the North Carolina State Board of Elections:\n\nSept. 6, 2024: County boards of elections begin mailing absentee ballots to eligible voters who submitted an absentee ballot request form.\n\nOct. 11, 2024: Voter registration deadline (5 p.m.).*\n\nOct. 17, 2024: In-person early voting begins; same-day registration available.\n\nOct. 29, 2024: Absentee ballot request deadline (5 p.m.).*\n\nNov. 2, 2024: In-person early voting ends (3 p.m.).\n\nNov. 5, 2024: General Election Day.\n\nNov. 5, 2024: Absentee ballot return deadline (7:30 p.m.).*\n\n*Voter registration and absentee voting deadlines are different for military and overseas citizen voters.\n\nFind additional important election information here.\n\n#CandidatesOnEnergy2024"
