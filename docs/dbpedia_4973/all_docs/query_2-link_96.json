On December 20, 1959, he married the love of his life, Patricia Wise (Patty Pat), in Rhome, Texas. Don and Patti moved to Waco, in 1970, where they raised their sons Mark and Dave. Don owned the Roto-Rooter franchise in Waco for 25 years before selling the business and retiring. Don loved coaching his boys in Lake Air Pee Wee football and Little League baseball. Don was a former Deacon at Crestview Church of Christ and President of the China Spring ISD School Board. Don thought the world of his family and once said, “I know I have been successful in life, just look at my family.”\n\nDon is proceeded in death by his parents; brother, Bob; and son, Dave.\n\nLeft to carry on his legacy are his wife of 64 years, Patti; son, Mark Davis (wife Dedra); daughter-in-law, Marti Davis; granddaughters, Danni, Cameron, and Sydney Davis; grandsons, Zach Davis (wife Lindsey) and Alex Davis (wife Samantha); great-grandkids, Sawyer, Crawford, and Davey; and numerous nieces and nephews and cousins.\n\n“There are no happy ending endings, only new beginnings. Our zest for life can only be overshadowed by the beauty of God’s tomorrow.” –Don Davis\n\nPrint Obituary & Condolences"
