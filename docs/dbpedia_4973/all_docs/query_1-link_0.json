        "text": "Congressman Don Davis was born and raised in Snow Hill, North Carolina. He has spent his life answering the call to serve -- as a veteran, educator, minister, and dedicated public servant.\n\nAs a young man, Congressman Davis worked in the tobacco fields and faithfully attended the same church where he currently ministers. He graduated in 1994 from the United States Air Force Academy and became a commissioned officer in the United States Air Force, where he actively served in uniform for eight years. As a First Lieutenant, Davis coordinated Air Force One and CODEL operations at Andrews Air Force Base and supported families of military members as a mortuary officer.\n\nCongressman Davis returned to eastern North Carolina as an assistant professor of Aerospace Studies at East Carolina University Air Force ROTC Detachment 600, where he taught national security affairs, military history, and leadership courses. As an educator for over 20 years, Davis mentored thousands of students as they completed their studies.\n\nAs a veteran, Congressman Davis continued his commitment to public service by becoming the youngest Mayor of Snow Hill at age 29, where he served seven years. In 2008, Congressman Davis was elected to the North Carolina State Senate, serving six terms.\n\nIn 2022, Congressman Davis was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing 19 counties comprising the First Congressional District of North Carolina in eastern North Carolina. The Region 7 delegation unanimously elected him to serve as their representative and on the Steering & Policy Committee. Congressman Davis remains committed to working with his colleagues, regardless of party affiliation, to address the needs of his constituents in the First Congressional District."
