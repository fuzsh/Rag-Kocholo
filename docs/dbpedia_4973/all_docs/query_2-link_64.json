Contributor to periodicals, including Utne Reader, Teacher, Parenting, Time, and Mother Earth News.\n\nSidelights\n\nAlthough he has published books for adults and children, Donald Davis considers himself foremost a storyteller. Born in the mountainous region of western North Carolina in 1944, Davis told Robert Jordan of the Winston-Salem Journal that storytelling was an element of his daily life while growing up, particularly as part of his relationship with his Grandma Walker. \"My grandmother did lots of telling,\" Davis recalled. \"I remember hearing those stories, and I remember by the time I was in the second grade telling other kids in school stories I'd heard my grandmother tell.\" Among those stories are those he retells in such works as The Pig Who Went Home on Sunday: An Appalachian Folktale, a home—grown version of \"The Three Little Pigs\" that School Library Journal contributor Linda M. Kenton praised as \"a readable story with just the right amount of repetition for sharing aloud.\"\n\nDavis's storytelling has led to several successful publishing outlets, including CDs, tapes, and videos. Among the dozens of recorded works Davis has created are several that feature the ubiquitous fairy-tale figure of Jack. Well-known from such stories and nursery rhymes as \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" and \"Jack and Jill,\" this teenaged hero stars in Jack's First Job and Jack and Granny Ugly. Retold as part of the Appalachian oral tradition, Davis's rich versions of various classic tales incorporating this Everyman figure, the \"Jack\" stories demonstrate the importance of humor and the endearing, universal qualities of an adolescent character.\n\nJack also appears in the stories Davis has collected in book form. In Jack and the Animals Davis sets his version of the Grimm Brothers' tale \"The Bremen Town Musicians\" in the Appalachian Mountains. Using simple, direct language, he recounts how the kind-hearted Jack adopts five animals, all of whom seem to have outgrown their usefulness. He happens upon an aging cow, for example, and learns that she can no longer produce milk. She and the other animals join Jack on his travels in search of fortune. When the group happens upon a band of robbers, Jack and these formerly valueless creatures foil the evildoer's lawless plot and save the day.\n\nSeveral of Davis's writings are based on personal sources. In his novel Thirteen Miles from Suncrest, he presents a slice-of-life story set in the mountains of North Carolina early in the twentieth century. The story's narrator, Medford Henry McGee, was born in the year 1900, and in a journal given him on his tenth birthday, he chronicles his experiences between the years 1910 and 1913, recording the gradual encroachment of the \"modern world\" into the western regions of North Carolina. Judy Sokoll, writing in School Library Jour-nal, observed that \"Medford is a captivating narrator—sensitive, trusting, loving, natural, and filled with wide-eyed curiosity about the world. All of the characters are wonderfully created and the sense of a simpler time is masterfully crafted.\" A Publishers Weekly critic likewise praised the work, noting that \"the novel's themes—hardship and tragedy set against the strength and beauty of family love—prove affecting and timeless.\"\n\nSee Rock City: A Story Journey through Appalachia represents another of Davis's forays into the history of his native North Carolina. Transporting readers back to 1948, the year Davis entered kindergarten, the book follows the author's life and the tales of his family through his second year of college. Audiobooks such as Braces and Grandma's Boy also draw from the narrator's youth, telling coming-of-age stories that focus on a boy growing up in a close-knit, multigenerational family. Mama Learns to Drive—which like many of Davis's works was produced both in an audio and print version—returns readers to the 1950s, as Davis introduces his Appalachian-born mother and contrasts her willingness to embrace life's challenges as a young woman with his more recent recollections of her elder years. Discussing the eight vignettes recorded in the book version, published as Mama Learns to Drive, and Other Stories: Stories of Love, Humor, and Wisdom, Susan Hepler wrote in School Library Journal that readers will \"envy\" Davis's \"freedom and the coziness of his family life, school and community,\" and a Publishers Weekly contributor praised Grandma's Boy, noting that \"consummate story teller Davis\" uses \"plenty of down-home warmth and humor\" to recount his visits, as a boy, to his grandmother's rural home in the hills of North Carolina."
