        "text": "Our wonderful husband, father, and grandpa, Donald Davis, passed away peacefully on July 13, 2023. Don was born in Helena, Montana, on April 5, 1926, to parents, Guy and Margaret (McDonald) Davis. He and the family lived on the family ranch in Blossburg, Montana. Don was the youngest of his brother, Dan, and two sisters, Rose and Lucille. He attended grade school in Blossburg and graduated from high school in Elliston, Montana. He joined the military in March of 1945 and was honorably discharged in December of 1946. He returned to Snowshoe and worked on the ranch.\n\nOn February 12, 1950, he married Ava Brantner in Deer Lodge, Montana. They lived at Snowshoe and had two sons, James and Thomas. Their youngest son, Steve, was born when they were on the ranch at 3 Mile. In 1967, the family moved to Deer Lodge and Don went to work on the Williams and Tavenner Ranch north of Deer Lodge. When the ranch was sold to the Ward family, he stayed on and managed it for them until the fall of 1996 when he semi-retired and he and Ava moved to Deer Lodge.\n\nUpon full retirement he developed new interests. One was shooting pool with his grandson, Jim, and good friends in Deer Lodge and Arizona. When he got a guitar and started taking lessons, it started a whole new life for him and Ava. They met so many new and dear friends as they started ‘jamming’ in Montana and Arizona. They loved going to the Thursday Night Jammers.\n\nDon was a soft-spoken man, but you knew when he meant business. Dad was good at everything he did, whether it was dragging calves to the branding fire, team roping with friends, or growing hay and grain. He will be greatly missed.\n\nDon was preceded in death by his parents; brother, Dan; sisters, Rose and Lucille; and son, James.\n\nDon is survived by his wife of 73 of years, Ava Davis of Deer Lodge; son, Thomas and wife, Vicky and their son, James and wife, Brandy Beck Davis, all of Deer Lodge; son, Stephen and wife, Patricia O’Connell Davis of Corvallis, MT, and their daughters, Bridgid Jarrett (Clay), Heather Gray (Tim), and Meaghan Price (Brad); eleven grandchildren, fourteen great grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nA graveside service will be held at 11:00 AM on Monday, July 24, 2023, at the Avon Cemetery in Avon, Montana. A reception will follow at the Elks Lodge 1737, 230 Main St. in Deer Lodge. In lieu of flowers, memorials in honor of Don are suggested to an organization of the donor’s choice.\n\nPlease visit the sidebar to offer the family a condolence or to share a memory of Don. Longfellow Finnegan Riddle Funeral Home and Crematory has been privileged to care for Don and his family."
