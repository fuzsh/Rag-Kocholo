Buster Davis arranged and directed numerous productions composed by Jule Styne, including Funny Girland Bells Are Ringing. His musical Doctor Jazz, for which he wrote the music and lyrics and served as Musical Director and Vocal Arranger, had a short run on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre in 1975.\n\nMr. Davis also wrote special material for many television shows, including the Bell Telephone Hour featuring the Buster Davis Singers and the Art Carney Show.
