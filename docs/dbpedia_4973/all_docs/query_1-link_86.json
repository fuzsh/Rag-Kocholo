        "text": "Davis, Donald Eugene, age 90, of Oxford, Ohio passed away peacefully on March 11, 2024. Born on February 23, 1934 in Columbus, Ohio to the late Corol and Clinton Davis. Donald grew up in Grove City and attended Hamilton Township High School, graduating in 1952. On November 29, 1952 he married the late Margaret Jean (nee Alexander) Davis who went before him on November 1, 2008; devoted father of Lisa Elaine (nee Davis) Hemenway and Ronald Eugene (Heather) Davis; cherished grandfather of Courtney Young, Trevor Davis, Zachary (Erin) Hemenway and loving great-grandfather of Owen Young. Don was a beloved husband and his family were the cornerstone of his life. He proudly served in the United States Navy from 1952-1956, then spent many years in retail. He and Jean moved to Oxford, Ohio in 1980 where he managed the Hueston Woods Marina for seven years before he finally retired. Don was an active member of the Oxford Senior Citizens for over ten years and had been attending Oxford United Methodist Church for many years. He enjoyed boating, reading and fishing but his true passion was teaching the word of God through Bible study. Don will be remembered as a very loving father and grandfather, and will be deeply missed by all who knew him. The family would like to thank the staff and nurses of Jamestowne Rehabilitation Facility for their tremendous care and support.\n\nDonations in Don's name may be made to the Butler County SPCA or a veteran's charity of your choice.\n\nA memorial service to honor Donâ€™s life will be held at 4:00pm on Friday, April 12, 2024 at Paul Young Funeral Home, 5086 College Corner Pike, Oxford, Ohio. Pastor Caleb Henry presiding. The family will receive friends from 3:00pm until the time of the memorial service."
