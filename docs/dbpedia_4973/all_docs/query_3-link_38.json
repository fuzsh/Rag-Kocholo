        "text": "I was born in Paris in the early 1980s, and it wasn’t until I reached my teenage years that the urge to discover a new city started growing in me. Looking back now, I realize there were three main reasons for that. First, I grew up in a psychologically difficult environment. Second, my teenage years were spent discovering a passion for films, video games, and music, all of which were decidedly American-centric. And third, I had the inner belief at the time that France was reactionary, backward-looking, boring, and snobby. (As you can see, I was already very opinionated—call it the curse of being born French!) And so, by the time I reached my late teens, I felt a strong need to leave Paris and France behind.\n\nIt turned out, quite conveniently, that in the year 2000 the only undergraduate music program in the world with a film scoring major was at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Basking in the luxury of having parents who could afford to send me to a private American music school, I flew to the United States in the summer of 2001 to start college. And for the following four years, I didn’t give it another thought.\n\nIn the end, Los Angeles felt like the most logical choice for someone who wanted to start a career as a film composer. First, I needed a work visa, and the surest bet at the time was to find a job assisting another composer in the hope they would sponsor you. Second, most working composers I knew of lived in or around Hollywood, including so many of my heroes: John Williams, John Powell, Thomas Newman, Lalo Schiffrin, Bill Conti, Don Davis, John Debney, Hans Zimmer… Third, I had been told by some of my peers at Berklee that I would quite likely hate Los Angeles because “Europeans” (whatever that meant) found it “superficial”, “artistically boring” and “culturally poor”. Hearing this strengthened my revolve to give it a shot, if only to prove the naysayers wrong—I figured I would at least try it and see for myself.\n\nAs a result, I can trace the huge majority of jobs I ever had to that move to Los Angeles in September 2005. By November, I had my first gig as an assistant, for music editor Micha Liberman; that led, a few months later, to meeting composer John Frizzell, who I assisted for six weeks; which then led to working full time for composer William Ross. This job, in turn, gave me a jumping board to expand my career in many varied directions, running the whole gamut of music-related jobs such as studio runner, music technician, music editor, programmer, studio manager, orchestrator, arranger, copyist, librarian, musician, conductor, producer… the list is long.\n\nWorking for Bill Ross also meant that I finally obtained my work visa. This gave me the time I needed to slowly build my own network in Los Angeles. Eventually, after many years of hard work, patience, tenacity, and (yes) luck, I scored my first short film; my first feature film; my first TV movie; and my first TV series. All of these projects were from clients then located in LA, and it’s highly doubtful that I would have managed to get them if it weren’t for me being in LA as well.\n\nOver the next decade, my network kept expanding, and my clients are now spread all around the world: America, of course, but also Asia and Europe. These clients, whom I all first met in Los Angeles, know me and trust me. That trust means they hire me back when their projects allow, and recommend me to their peers when opportunities strike. And the work is, more and more, routinely done remotely over Zoom, including meetings, spotting sessions, and music reviews. As a matter of fact, even my LA-based clients have embraced the advantages of meeting remotely instead of wasting time driving around the city. While some of them do come to my studio in West LA, these visits are a rare occurrence compared to how things used to be 5 or 10 years ago. Nowadays, we mostly meet in person for lunch or drinks. (Which is an important side of the business, by the way.)\n\nYet even though I just had five incredibly successful years, and I’m currently in the middle of the busiest composing slate of my solo career, I can’t help but wonder how the move to Paris will affect my ability to get future work. Since I’ve turned freelance, I never had to think about the importance of being in LA to find work because, well… I was always here. Has that ever played a role in me being considered for a gig? Did the fact that I was a « Hollywood composer » help me in selling my services to directors, producers and companies based out of town or overseas?\n\nAnd in the future, will being in another city, in another time zone, make my LA-based clients think twice about hiring me?\n\nIn a vacuum, these critical questions are quite difficult to answer. So when I realized I would switch my home base to Paris, the first decision I had to make was to figure out how public I was going to be about the move itself. The stigma about « leaving » LA is that, surely, if you are leaving, it must mean that you are quitting the business for good. As if the only place you could be a successful media composer is in Hollywood! There are plenty of successful artists who do not live in LA—or at least do not live full time there. Still, the fear is real. Over the years I’ve seen and heard of people moving away and not telling anyone, pretending they were still in town to alleviate their own fears of being considered a quitter. Who was I going to be? After all, although you can hear many positive stories about composers having successful careers away from Hollywood, the lingering feeling is that it might not apply to you. So should I tell my LA acquaintances, colleagues, and clients? Or should I « ghost-move » and act as if I still lived full time in California?\n\nEvidently, since you’re reading this article on my very public blog, the choice I made is obvious. But it wasn’t an easy one to make. The truth is that change is hard. But another truth is that I don’t think you can succeed in any endeavor if you don’t fully commit to it. While you have to believe things will somehow work out, at the same time you have to work for the things you believe in. So if I want the relocation to Paris to be successful, then I have to do it fully. And that can only happen if I do it transparently.\n\nIt turns out that clients and colleagues I’ve discussed the move with all share one defining trait: they all seemed very enthusiastic about it. « You’re moving to freaking Paris! » said one. « Paris is my favorite city, I so wish I could move there! » said another. « French and European cinema are the best! » said a third one. « You can write music while looking at the Eiffel Tower! Imagine that! » even said a fourth one. (I don’t know how serious he was.)\n\nOn a more down-to-earth level, many clients told me they didn’t see it as a deal breaker. Many said that as long as I could come to LA for important meetings or recordings, it wouldn’t make a big difference where I was working from. I don’t know if they were trying to be nice or were simply humoring me. But I have to take their well wishes at face value. Because the truth is that the remote and solitary nature of composing music inherently means that I can get the job done from anywhere in the world. After all, as one producer told me, « it’s not like we meet every day at your studio anyway… »\n\nAll that being said, I’m well aware that there’s a difference between theory and reality. I tend to be over-analytical, and I don’t like leaving anything to chance. After all, my career is the result of two decades of hard work. It’s too precious to carelessly let it meander. I must actively work to insure it continues to thrive as it adapts to a new environment. As such, one of my first goals in the near future will be to demonstrate to my LA-based clients that—although I may have decided to move closer to my family—I am not leaving Los Angeles behind: as far as I’m concerned, I know it will always play an essential part of my career. And who knows where all of this will lead? I could very well find myself moving back at a not-so-distant point in the future. We live in a mobile world, after all.\n\nIf I’m honest, I’d say the situation is both exciting yet stressful; life-affirming yet anxiety-inducing. But I intend to explore the possibilities with openness and optimism. And being public and honest about it will be a big part of the experience. Over the next few months, on my social networks as well as, I hope, on this very blog, I’ll try to document how different (if at all) life in Paris might be for a media composer. And while I’m going to give myself some time to adjust, I already have many projects in the pipeline I’m impatient to undertake—for which being located in Europe will actually be an upside.\n\nI hope you’ll join me for this ride. See you on the other side."
