        "text": "Don A. Davis, 71, a man of many nicknames, left this world for his eternal yurt on April 18, 2023 in Casper, WY. His family was by his side, recalling memories and listening to his favorite music.\n\nDon was born in Oregon to Fred and Hazel Davis. Don was the oldest of five, with all the qualities of a firstborn child. His family settled in Casper where he began establishing his legacy, graduating from Natrona County High School (with only a few marks on his permanent record) and pursuing a successful professional journey.\n\nDon knew Randisue in high school, but their stars didn’t align until after graduation. They married, Randisue being his voice of reason, the yin to his yang, and they created a beautiful family and life together. Kelly, Brianne, and Alicyn softened his edges and brightened his eyes. The Fab Five enjoyed many camping trips, creating memories for years to come. Don was blessed with three sons (in-law), always exclaiming “Son-in-laws: they kiss your daughters and drink your beer!”\n\nDon’s real joy came from his grandchildren. Spending weekends on his mountain, turning grandsons into men. Afternoons were spent with ATV and dirt bikes rides, cooking in the dutch oven, and hiking with his various walking stick creations. He was a presence at band and choir concerts, sporting events, and Sunday dinners, but drew the line at recorder concerts.\n\nAfter four decades, Don retired as president from WLC, which he jokingly referred to as, “a land surveying company with engineers.” Don and Randisue enjoyed many retirement vacations across the country on walkabouts to visit national forests, parks, and battlefields. His biggest retirement project, though, consisted of planning, designing, and building a yurt at his retreat on Casper Mountain. He gathered family together for a roof-raising ceremony in 2018. His fire pits were his glory and getting his whole family together on the mountain was his euphoria. Winters didn’t stop his enjoyment of Casper Mountain. At his last tally mark, he had 214 snowshoeing expeditions since he started recording, with an average of 70 each season.\n\nDon is preceded in death by his parents, stepmother, Violet Davis, and beloved samoyeds Moon, Kheta, and Bailey.\n\nDon leaves behind Randisue, his wife of nearly 46 years, three daughters: Kelly (Jeff) Hover, Brianne (Ken) Watkins, and Alicyn (Josh) Dugan, eight grandchildren: Trent (Rylee) and Brady, Abagail, Benjamin and Charlotte, and Grace, Asher, and Eliza, two great-grandsons: Gentry and Jenson, his brothers Jim and John, sisters Julie and Melissa, nieces, nephews, and a plethora of life-long friends that were more like family.\n\n“Short naps and Little kids. Long Life and Longer Laughs. Love, Life, and Legacy.’ - Don Davis.\n\nHe certainly leaves a meaningful legacy.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, a memorial account has been established in Don’s memory with the Continental Divide Trails Coalition: https://continentaldividetrail.org/in-memory-of-don-davis/\n\nServices will be held at 10:00 a.m. on Mon. Apr. 24, 2023 at First Christian Church in Casper. Pastor Bryan Elliott will officiate."
