        "text": "Composer Don Davis underscores the beauty of a world below, by David Hirsch\n\nOriginally published in Starlog Explorer #7, June 1995\n\nText reproduced by kind permission of the author David Hirsch\n\n“The technological revolution hasn’t helped film music all that much,” ob­serves composer Don Davis, lament­ing the fate many of his contemporaries have become doomed to suffer. Studios, needing to see quick return on their investments, especially in television, keep decreasing post­ production time. As new technology narrows the gap between the shooting and airing of a TV episode, or a film premiere, composers are finding the pressures greater in their quest to create the perfect underscore.\n\nFor Davis, the challenge is greater still, as he has never been satisfied with shortcuts in the creation of his rich orchestral works which have graced such series as BEAUTY & THE BEAST and SEAQUEST DSV. The results have been some of episodic television’s most memorable and emotional music, all the aftermath of meticulously hard work. As Davis notes, “Composers who can get the job done have prevailed while others who have held their ground, for artistic reasons, have fallen by the way side.”\n\nHis gift, as with many other successful writers, has been a keen musical sense that allows him to quickly sift out what the needs are for each project, and an ability to clearly produce each harmonic phrase in detail.\n\nDavis says his writing sense developed from the time he spent on what he calls “serious composing,” in effect, music not meant for film. He started writing while per­forming as a trumpet player for jazz and big band groups in high school. “To be perfectly honest, I don’t know what youthful folly ac­tually steered me in this direction,” he muses. “Performing definitely led me into writing. There seemed to be a pretty definite progression into film composing and scoring because most of the guys I worked with were peripherally involved in that area.\n\n“Actually, I was heading into film and TV-type stuff, but was sidetracked into writing serious music. That’s fairly unusual, most guys start out as serious composers and go into film as a practical thing. I decided to be impractical and do the serious thing.”\n\nHyper Scores\n\nWhile in college, Davis began developing several working relationships, scoring the usual crop of student-made films. Producer/editor Bruce Stubblefield, one of his schoolmates, and director Todd Durham eventually hooked up with low-budget pro­ducer Earl Owensby to film HYPERSPACE. “That’s when things started to happen for me,” Davis says. “I did a couple of things in college for the same people. I wasn’t really working for Earl, I was working for the di­rector and the producer/editor. They saw this as a springboard for their careers. The whole point was to get something to start us off. I was already scoring at that time. I had done some TV episodes like HART TO HART, which was actually my first credited job.\n\n“HYPERSPACE was a send-up of a number of SF films, in particular STAR WARS and WAR OF THE WORLDS. They had a character called Lord Buckethead, who was clearly a parody of Darth Vader.”\n\nReleased in 1985, Hyperspace starred then-unknown comedian Paula Poundstone as Karen, a cashier at an Aamco Trans­mission Repair Shop who’s pursued by the in-the-dark Lord who’s in search of secret enemy transmissions. Actually, he’s not even on the right planet! Karen’s savior isn’t her boss Roy (Leon Rippy from NEXT GEN­ERATION’s “The Neutral Zone’’), but Max the Terminex Exterminator. Chris Elliott (CABIN BOY) also stars as a scientist battling local UFO-loonies instead of the real aliens.\n\nFor composer Davis, the many jabs at STAR WARS, like the TIE Fighter-esque supermarket shopping cart battle, provided an overabundance of visual inspiration. Despite the low budget, Davis wasn’t forced to record the score with synthesizers. “Before HYPERSPACE, it was normal to try and eke out an orchestral score. Now, automatically, it’s synth (synthesizer). The costs of recording have gone up so much since then, I don’t think we could do that kind of orchestral score for that amount of money now. For the budget, it turned out pretty well. It sounds cheesy now because it wasn’t the 90-piece London Symphony Orchestra recorded at Abbey Road. We did what we could, and I think what makes it funny was that it was ‘feel good’ cheap.”\n\n“They originally shot HYPERSPACE in 3-D, but I never saw it. That was bizarre because there was no reason for it. They just sold it that way when they raised the money.”\n\nDavis’ career continued to develop while scoring a variety of TV series and features. He also orchestrated scores for other composers including Joe Harnell on “V.” However, his biggest exposure came from being in the right place at the right time. “Lee Holdridge did the pilot for BEAUTY & THE BEAST and wasn’t interested in an extended obligation. So, he struck a deal with the producers to do the pilot and the first six episodes. Then, he would choose his own successor.\n\n“They went through a number of differ­ent people including Christopher Young (HELL­RAISER). It had a lot to do with Lee wanting to keep it ‘in the family’ in terms of his agents. He was represented by an agency called Bart-Milander (now Milander Schleussner Kaufman). I was, what they called in agent-speak, a ‘side-client.’ I didn’t have enough status to be a full client, but they were aware of me through my asso­ciations with their other clients, Alf Clausen (THE SIMPSONS) and Mark Snow (THE X-FILES), as their orchestrator and co-composer. They were negotiating things on a play-as-it-comes basis, which I think most agencies do when developing new clients. I hadn’t actually worked for Lee before, though while I was doing HYPERSPACE, I did get a call from him to orchestrate BEASTMAS­TER. I had to say no, which was disappointing because I really wanted to do it. I just didn’t have time to do both.\n\n“There was a big shake-up at the agency at that time and a partner, Charles Ryan, accepted a position at the ICM Agency to start up their music department. He took a bunch of clients with him, many of whom were the people Lee was considering. Lee’s a very loyal guy. He remembers the people who have helped him along the way and I’m sure my staying with the agency played a factor in the ball swinging into my court. On the basis of him listening to my work, I became ‘The Chosen One’ by Lee and the producers.\n\n“We had many discussions about what would be good musically for BEAUTY & THE BEAST. He didn’t insist I do anything in par­ticular, though I suspect the music became more grandiose and florid as the show be­came more so. The series started really quite dark, more action-oriented. Shortly after I came on, it grew more fantasy-oriented. The show was evolving all the time.\n\n“The producers were big on character themes. They had one of the most spectacu­lar writing staffs in TV history. As these writers would come up with a new personal­ity, they would nudge me and say, ‘How about a theme for this character?’ Each character would establish their own identity, even recurring tunnel dwellers like Mouse. It seemed pretty successful.”\n\nFor two years, Davis met the weekly challenge to create BEAUTY & THE BEAST’s musical needs. “Nothing is easy. It was a lot of writing, hard work. I don’t use an orches­trator. I don’t sketch (writing the basics), I write to the full score page. It got to the point where I could create a certain amount of music in a week, about 20 minutes. If the score was longer, I would delegate some music to Bill Ross, who acted as co-composer in those situations. We would get to­gether and discuss character themes I wrote for a particular show. In a few instances, there was so little time that I would have him do half the show and we would split the credit. He also did two completely on his own, one in the second season and one in the last. His career skyrocketed after BEAST scoring THUMBELINA, COPS AND ROBBERSONS and THE LITTLE RASCALS. I’m very proud of that!”\n\nBeauty’s Music\n\nThe most frustrating time for Davis on BEAST was at the start of the show’s final season when Catherine was killed off. “It was unfortunate,” Davis observes. “Linda Hamilton, who played Catherine, wanted out. She felt she had developed the character as far as it could go. As strong an actress as she was, I think it was absolutely the right decision for her to make. Besides, she was pregnant and wanted to start a family. Who could tell her not to do that?”\n\nAs production began on Catherine’s last episode, the two-hour season opener “Though Lovers Be Lost,” panic apparently set in at the front office. “I think that they were starting to realize, after writing the script and getting network approval, that killing Catherine wasn’t a great thing to do.” One of the key moments in the story was when Catherine dies in Vincent’s arms. For the composer, this one three-minute se­quence proved to be the most difficult scene to score during his entire tenure on the series. “That was a convoluted situation I really didn’t see coming. It hit me over the head and now, having been around a bit longer and with more experience, I can look at it with a clearer head.\n\n“Shortly after I came on, executive pro­ducer Tony Thomas, who was very busy with a slate of successful sitcoms like GOLDEN GIRLS, had delegated the musical and dubbing decisions to supervising producer Steven Kurzfeld. He had his own particular view of what the music should be, particularly in that a sparing use of Lee’s theme would be more effective than a liberal use. If you plastered it all over, it would lose its ef­fectiveness. So, we had pretty much been doing what we wanted and, suddenly, along comes this two-hour episode where they kill off the lead character!\n\n“It wasn’t a situation the producers viewed lightly. When I spotted the show with Steve (for music placement), I didn’t realize what they had riding on it. They had pretty much thrown the show away and they were starting to understand that. From then on, they began to take steps to avoid the se­ries going down the tubes. There were seri­ous problems with the episode, too, which required some re-editing and re-shooting. Eventually, I ended up with only a week-and-a-half to write about 50 minutes of music. I had spotted the show with the same producer and my directive was the same: ‘Sparing use of the theme.’ For the finale, we discussed what was going to happen when Catherine died in Vincent’s arms. The consensus was that it should be a blast of emotion like Pagliacci.\n\n“We scored the show and dubbed it. The executive producers looked at it and made quite a number of changes, one being the fi­nale in particular. Tony Thomas saw that scene as being gentle, so he asked me to do it over. After some discussion with him, and the other producers. I was basically told to ‘tone it down.’ which I did. Still, it wasn’t what he had in mind.\n\n“At that point, we were into the first six one-hour episodes and I was busy and, frankly, tired of re-doing it. I asked Lee Holdridge to do it, which he was happy to do, but discreetly. He did a great job and the producers liked it. That was the cue that ended up in the show”.\n\n“What I find strange is that the story has since surfaced that it was the producers who asked Lee, and not me. That’s not true. I never told the producers I had done that. It was basically because I didn’t have the time to keep re-doing one scene.”\n\nFor all his trouble over the last season. Davis was rewarded with an Emmy award for the episode “Time to Heal.” Previously he had been nominated for “To Reign in Hell.” Of the winning episode, the composer notes, “That story wasn’t particularly a knockout. The reason I put it on the ballot was that the show didn’t have much dia­logue or sound effects. Catherine had died and they were hoping to introduce a charac­ter who would replace her. Diana, as played by Jo Anderson, was a detective trying to figure out who killed Catherine, and she started to dig up all this evidence about a person named Vincent. She reckoned he would eventually show up at Catherine’s grave so she had a stakeout there.\n\n“Something happened in another subplot and Vincent was mortally wounded. He goes to Catherine’s grave to die, and Diana takes him home, nursing him back to health. Until he gets better, he doesn’t say anything and with no one to talk to, neither does Diana. So, there’s a lot of music and it’s not com­peting with anything. I’ve sat on those Emmy panels and you watch the shows. If you can’t hear the music, you can’t judge it.”\n\nToony Tunes\n\nHis third Emmy nomination came from his next association with BEAST creator Ron Koslow on MY LIFE & TIMES. The show’s imaginative format followed the events ex­perienced by one man, but told in flashbacks by his elderly self in the 21st century. Davis earned a nomination for “The Collapse of ’98,” a story set during the economic de­pression of 1998. “Lee Holdridge did the pilot and two other episodes. I did two. then Alf Clausen did one. Unfortunately, the show was pretty much cancelled after only two airings. I was surprised the network dumped it so soon.”\n\nSince then, the composer has scored a variety of TV series and films, including the cop comedy SLEDGE HAMMER! and A STONING IN FULHAM COUNTY, wherein Ron (Vincent) Perlman played an Amish man.\n\nOne of his greatest musical challenges was working on the TINY TOONS ADVENTURES, a show that tested the mettle of many com­posers. “It was intentionally a throwback to the Bugs Bunny / Road Runner Warner Bros. concept in which every action is acknowl­edged in the music. Every time someone was walking, the footsteps would be caught with a musical statement like a pizzicato musical phrase (i.e. plucking of strings). It takes a long time to map that out. I’m not a slow writer, but the best I could manage on TINY TOONS was one minute a day! Plus, on that show in particular, they talked about the ‘Carl Stalling-style.’ He was a monster as a composer, because he didn’t blow anything off: he wrote very expressive music that was often manic, and quoted a lot of sources in a creative manner. I did a total of five TINY TOONS. It was definitely a learning experi­ence. Carl Stalling developed his style over 20 years. His early stuff was mostly re-ar­ranged tunes. It wasn’t until 1945, when the Bugs Bunny character evolved that he de­veloped that style. It was a style that really made you reach beyond your abilities. TINY TOONS was an incredible challenge.”\n\nMore animated adventures awaited Davis when he went on to do Steven Bochco’s short-lived primetime cartoon CAPITAL CRIT­TERS. “They didn’t want the same approach, at first, when I went in. They wanted it to be scored like a live-action show, which sounded great until you got into it and dis­covered what they really wanted was TINY TOONS. Actually, there was a happy medium. This show needed moments where you hit the mark, but other times you could play it as a drama. That was like a cool breeze.”\n\nRough weather was ahead when Davis was called in to score an episode of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. “Well, they had been doing NEXT GENERATION for a number of years with Dennis McCarthy and Jay Chattaway just trading off shows. The producers wanted them for DEEP SPACE NINE and as production started, they realized that they needed someone else. For some reason they brought in John Debney (SEAQUEST) and my­self. I think it had something to do with the head of the music department at Paramount, David Grossman, being aware of both of us. Dennis, I believe, also suggested us.\n\n“When I came in to score ‘Face of the Enemy,’ I had, of course, heard all the rumors about how they didn’t like ‘up front’ music. However, you figure they called me to bring in my perspective. I had also been apprised that, when Dennis and Jay entered the show, the producers eventually steered them into the direction they wanted. So, I went in feeling it simply wasn’t right to steal somebody else’s ideas.”\n\nWith Counselor Troi forced to masquer­ade as Romulan aboard a Warbird, Davis chose to accent the drama with his usual sweeping motifs, a far cry from the average NEXT GENERATION scores the producers de­manded. “In a situation like that, you have to play the drama as you see it. I didn’t con­sider it a typical show. On the other hand, I guess they weren’t real happy with what I came up with. I was pleased with it, even though I didn’t get the performances I would have liked. All my rehearsal time was eaten up by the producers changing this and that”.\n\n“It’s obviously not a very creative situa­tion. Despite the show’s success, I think THE NEXT GENERATION suffered from this stilted directive that every composer got. As creative situations go, there wasn’t much there.”\n\nMore fulfilling musically was his stint last season on SEAQUEST. “I was involved on the show since the pilot, helping John with his busy schedule, and when he was off doing WHITE FANG II for Disney, he asked me to score several episodes. The show had its problems dramatically last season, which made it hard to score because you were imposing drama that sometimes wasn’t there. That’s changing this year, the show’s going through many changes for the better. John was scheduled to score the two-hour opener and I’m probably going to do the first one-hour show since their production time overlaps. I may continue to do more shows whenever he gets too busy.”\n\nGenre Notes\n\nMeanwhile, Davis keeps himself occupied doing orchestration work on feature films. Previously, he has done ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES for Michael Kamen and in 1994, Randy Newman’s MAVERICK and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER for James Homer. “Things are changing in film scor­ing. It’s much less structured now in terms of who does what and why. There used to be a kind of stigma against orchestrators. When I first got into the business in ’79 or ’80, if you told somebody you orchestrated, even on a major film, they would give you a blank stare back. Now you get more respect for having done that. I think that has more to do with the fact that schedules are shrinking exponentially. As a result, it has become more of a team effort. Nobody can write an hour of music in two weeks, so you have to delegate some responsibility.\n\nfinal edit). Actually, they should remove that term from the vocabulary. They don’t ‘lock’ a film anymore. The stakes are higher in features so they test screen them. Somebody makes a flippant remark on a reply card and they’ll alter the film. When you have $30 million riding on a movie, people get ner­vous and take these screenings very seri­ously. I think I would too.\n\n“Film composers have always shot them­selves in the foot by accepting conditions we should have never accepted. That goes all the way back to Alfred Newman and Max Steiner (KING KONG). Even then, composers had two to three months to write scores and they should have insisted on more time.\n\n“There’s a certain inevitability to this downward spiral although there’s still a lot of great work being done. John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith are still writing at an in­credibly high level even after all these years. James Homer is an exceptional composer. I know many fans like to bash him. You can bash a score on how it comes off on a CD, but I defy anyone to bash a Horner score on how it comes off with the film in a dramatic sense.\n\n“John Barry is the most essential com­poser because, frankly, he’s a lousy musical composer, but as a film composer, he’s bril­liant. He comes up with a simple melody which, by itself, doesn’t mean a whole lot, but without exception, elevates the picture. I would have played DANCES WITH WOLVES much darker and more dramatic with ethnic American Indian stuff. Instead, Barry came up with this score that was on the order of his OUT OF AFRICA music and I believe it turned the film into a blockbuster. If that’s true, they couldn’t pay him all the money that he’s worth. There’s a brilliance to his simplicity.”\n\nfilm composer. “A good example is John Debney, who is very active in television and features. I have a suspicion that the people hiring him for HOCUS POCUS and WHITE FANG Il aren’t aware that he scored episodes of SISTERS. It’s a stupid stigma that someone who does TV is a TV hack.”\n\nAs for Don Davis, he has proved time and time again that he’s no hack. If allowed to soar, his music can, and will, elevate the story to new heights. It is only a matter of time before his star will shine, too."
