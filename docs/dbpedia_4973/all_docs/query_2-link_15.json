        "text": "Born and raised in rural Snow Hill, North Carolina, Don Davis has spent his life heeding the call to serve. Don attended the United States Air Force Academy and was commissioned as an officer, and served in uniform for 8 years. There, Don coordinated Air Force One operations at Andrews Air Force Base and supported families of military members killed in action as a mortuary officer.\n\nWhile stationed at Air Force ROTC Detachment 600, Don returned to eastern North Carolina as an assistant professor of Aerospace Studies at East Carolina University instructing national security affairs and leadership courses. He earned his doctorate in education and has continued to teach and mentor students for 20 years. Upon leaving the Air Force, Don continued his commitment to public service â€“ becoming the youngest Mayor of his hometown, Snow Hill, at age 29.\n\nIn his six terms as a Senator in the state legislature, Don has served as a champion for eastern North Carolina. In his tenure, Don fought and won teacher pay raises, a $1 billion investment to expand high-speed internet access, tax exemptions for military pensions, and $215 million in funding for the ECU Brody School of Medicine which serves the surrounding 19 rural counties."
