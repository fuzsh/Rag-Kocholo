        "text": "Don S. Davis passed away yesterday, June 29, 2008, of a heart attack.\n\nDavis was beloved by many Stargate fans for his many years playing George Hammond on Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. Davis first appeared as Major General Hammond in the SG-1 pilot “Children of the Gods”. He continued playing the no-nonsense-with-a-heart-of-gold general regularly through Season Seven, although he made guest appearances up through Season Nine’s “The Fourth Horsemen Part 1 & 2”. He also provided the voice for the Hammond puppet in Season Ten’s special “200”th episode, and will appear in the forthcoming Stargate: Continuum movie.\n\nDavis was born August 4, 1942. As Davis himself put it, he was: “born and raised in the Missouri Ozarks in Aurora, Missouri….a beautiful area with picturesque towns and farms set among rolling hills, which are crisscrossed by many rivers and contain a large number of magnificent lakes.” After graduating from Southwest Missouri State College with a Bachelor of Science in theater and art, Davis proudly served in the United States Army, eventually reaching the rank of captain. After his military service, he received a masters degree, and later a doctorate in theater, teaching for many years before acting full time on film beginning in 1987.\n\nDavis was also an accomplished artist. Some of his work in sculpture, paintings, drawings, and set design can be seen at donsdavisart.com. According to the official statement, a family memorial will take place in a few weeks scattering Davis’s ashes into the ocean. Any donations may be made to the American Heart Association.\n\nSolutions’s deepest condolences go to Don Davis’s wife Ruby, his family, friends and colleagues, especially his fellow cast and crew mates in the “Stargate family.”\n\n—Article written by Solutions editor “Aurora Novarum”"
