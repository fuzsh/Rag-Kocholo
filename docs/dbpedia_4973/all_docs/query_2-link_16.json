        "text": "Donald Romain Davis (born February 4, 1957) is an American composer, conductor, orchestrator and trombonist known for his film and television scores. He has also composed opera, concert and chamber music.\n\nDavis has collaborated with well-known directors including The Wachowskis, Ronny Yu, and Joe Johnston in genres ranging from horror, to action, to comedy. His best known works include music for The Matrix franchise, and the television series Beauty and the Beast and seaQuest 2032.\n\nDavis has been nominated for eight Primetime Emmy Awards, winning twice for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series. He has also won four BMI Film Music Awards.\n\nEarly life and education[]\n\nDavis was born in Anaheim, California. He began playing trumpet and piano at the age of nine, and started writing music at twelve. As his affinity for music grew, so did his aspirations, and soon he was composing and arranging orchestral charts for local jazz ensembles that he also performed with.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Davis enrolled at UCLA. He continued his study of musical composition with tutor Henri Lazarof. Additionally, he learned orchestration from Albert Harris.\n\nCareer[]\n\nDuring their orchestration lessons, Harris introduced Davis to the TV composer Joe Harnell, who supported Davis during his search for work—his first job was working for composer Mark Snow's TV show Hart to Hart. He has worked as an orchestrator and conductor for Michael Kamen, Alan Silvestri, James Horner, and Randy Newman.\n\nDavis was nominated for the Emmys in 1990 for Beauty and the Beast and won in 1995 for SeaQuest DSV. He wrote scores mostly for television series up until 1995, in which he wrote a few of the cues for the animated Disney motion picture A Goofy Movie. He continued to score television series until the two then young directors, the Wachowskis, hired him to score their neo-noir film Bound. It was reasonably successful at the box office. Bound was the film which led Davis into becoming the composer for the entire Matrix trilogy. Subsequently, Davis has composed scores for films such as Universal Soldier: The Return, Jurassic Park III (recommended to the filmmakers by John Williams, the composer of the scores for the first two films in the series), House on Haunted Hill, Behind Enemy Lines, and The Unsaid. In 2004, he produced the music score for the BBC science fiction documentary series Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets, released as Voyage to the Planets and Beyond in the United States.\n\nDavis' magnum opus is the Matrix franchise: The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions, and The Animatrix. It was set apart from other film scores of its time for its atonality and avant garde style of composition, with influences from polytonal minimalist works by John Adams and cluster-like as well as aleatoric techniques prominent in the works of composer Witold Lutosławski.\n\nIn addition to orchestrating and conducting his own scores, Don Davis has done orchestration work for many other composers. He was the conductor for the movie Flowers in the Attic, whose score was composed by Christopher Young, and for the TV documentary Eagles: Hell Freezes Over. He arranged music for The 86th Academy Awards as well. He is also regular orchestrator for Randy Newman.\n\nDon Davis' political opera, Río de Sangre, premiered at the Florentine Opera Company on October 22, 2010. Excerpts of the opera had previously been performed in Los Angeles with the Los Angeles Master Chorale on November 6, 2005, and the New York City Opera on May 13, 2007.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nDavis currently[when?] splits his time between Southern California and British Columbia, Canada. He has been married to Megan MacDonald since 1986, and they have two children together.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Director(s) Notes 1984 Hyperspace Todd Durham 1988 Blackout Doug Adams 1991 Session Man Seth Winston Short film 1992 Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation Various Composed with Steven Bramson, Bruce Broughton, Albert Lloyd Olson, Richard Stone, Stephen James Taylor & Mark Watters 1994 A Little Tailor's Christmas Story Allan Rich Short film 1996 Bound The Wachowskis 1997 Warriors of Virtue Ronny Yu 1998 The Lesser Evil David Mackay 1999 Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying The Matrix The Wachowskis Universal Soldier: The Return Mic Rodgers House on Haunted Hill William Malone 2001 Antitrust Peter Howitt Valentine Jamie Blanks Jurassic Park III Joe Johnston Original Jurassic Park themes by John Williams The Unsaid Tom McLoughlin Behind Enemy Lines John Moore 2002 Long Time Dead Marcus Adams Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever Kaos N/A 2003 The Matrix Reloaded The Wachowskis The Animatrix Various Composed with Machine Head & Photek The Matrix Revolutions The Wachowskis 2004 Mighty Times: The Children's March Robert Houston Documentary short 2006 The Marine John Bonito 2007 The Good Life Steve Berra Ten Inch Hero David Mackay 2017 Tokyo Ghoul Kentarō Hagiwara A Symphony of Hope Brian Weidling Documentary film 2018 Beyond the Sky Fulvio Sestito\n\nOrchestration work[]\n\nYear Film Composer Notes 1986 Police Academy 3: Back in Training Robert Folk Credited as additional orchestrator. 1987 Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol 1988 The In Crowd Mark Snow 1990 Die Hard 2 Michael Kamen 1991 If Looks Could Kill David Foster Hudson Hawk Michael Kamen Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves Ricochet Alan Silvestri 1992 Death Becomes Her The Muppet Christmas Carol Miles Goodman\n\nPaul Williams\n\nUncredited 1993 Cop and a Half Alan Silvestri Last Action Hero Michael Kamen Uncredited Hocus Pocus John Debney We're Back!
