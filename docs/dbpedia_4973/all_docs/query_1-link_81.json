Davis grew up in a family of storytelling folks in the mountains of Western North Carolina and has continued their tradition throughout his career. He has performed throughout the U.S. and abroad, authored 19 books, and released over 50 audio recordings. Davis is a recipient of the NSN ORACLE Circle of Excellence and Lifetime Achievement awards.\n\nHis stories often left listeners limp with laughter at the same time they struggled with a lump in the throat. – New York Times"
