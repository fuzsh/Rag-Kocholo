        "text": "All of my teachers have helped me to become the musician I am today. In terms of opening new pathways I would say that my graduate school teacher Russ de Luna helped me to find my voice as an English horn player. I always thought it was such a treat to learn from the Solo English horn of the San Francisco Symphony. I remember him telling me the story of how the first week of the job were performances of Symphonie fantastique for the Keeping Score documentaries, and how there were cameras everywhere. What I learn from stories like that is to embrace change and to take challenges head-on.\n\nI was always a good student in my academic courses, and I very well could have chosen a career not in music and do very well, but I always found such satisfaction from music. It was my last two years of high school, and I had the opportunity to play in some school orchestras, band and orchestra camps, and TMEA events, and though I had fun in band, playing in an orchestra was way more novel to me, so I decided to go to school for music. As an oboist straight out of high school I knew nothing about reedmaking, and my undergrad professor Dr. Andrew Parker was extremely helpful in meeting me where I was, and the TAs Dr. Matt Lengas and Aiden Dugan were very helpful in teaching me about reedmaking.\n\nI think it would be great to see more concerts that involve multimedia. It doesn’t have to be anything state-of-the-art or groundbreaking, it could easily just be a short film or animation that can show a visualization of the music in a way that holds meaning. I also think tickets can and should become less expensive, and dress codes for audience members should eventually fade out.\n\nI don’t give up, nor do I ever think about giving up. I acknowledge when I can’t do something in the moment, and if that means setting it down and trying the next day, then that is perfectly ok."
