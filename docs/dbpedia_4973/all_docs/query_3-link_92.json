        "text": "Country singer headed to Durango for performance at La Plata County Fair\n\nCountry singer Suzy Bogguss is no stranger to Durango stage – she’s a virtual regular at the Community Concert Hall at Fort Lewis College. And now, fans can catch her Aug. 9 at Friday at the Fair, during the La Plata County Fair.\n\nWe had a chance to catch up with Bogguss in an interview that included everything from a jam-packed touring schedule to a cookbook she wrote.\n\nThe following interview as been lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: You’re doing a bunch of shows. Is it still fun?\n\nA: It is. I think having the breaks that we had back there in 2020, I think it refreshed everybody and kind of reminded us of how much we love our job. And, you know, ever since we started back in 2021, I’ve just been loving every date. It’s this funny thing when we all were trying to reach out from home and doing livestreams and that sort of thing. I had one that went on for a really long time. In fact, I still do it once a month, but I did four years straight every Wednesday. Because I am traveling a lot, I finally had to say, OK, we’re going to do it once a month now. That reaching out to people kind of got rid of a layer of things in between us. ... And, of course, you know, Durango has been so good to me for years and years and years of continually bringing us back to the college. There’s a gratitude I think that most of us performers are feeling, especially those of us who started out as troubadours. We still love the road.\n\nIf you go\n\nWHAT: Friday at the Fair presents Suzy Bogguss with special guest Tim Sullivan.\n\nWHEN: Aug. 9. Gates open at 6 p.m.; Tim Sullivan, 6:45 p.m.; Suzy Bogguss, 8 p.m.\n\nWHERE: La Plata County Fairgrounds Rodeo Arena, 2500 Main Ave.\n\nTICKETS: $30-$65. Available online at https://tinyurl.com/mv9t97sa.\n\nMORE INFORMATION: Visit https://tinyurl.com/mv9t97sa and www.suzybogguss.com.\n\nQ: You’ve published a cookbook. How did that happen?\n\nA: I’ve always loved to cook since I was a little kid. Being the youngest, it was like that was self-defense to learn how to cook, because my siblings are quite a bit older than me and my parents both worked, so I would come home from school and I’ll just be like, Oh my God, if I have to wait until all these people get home, I’m gonna starve to death. So I started learning to cook when I was about 9, and it just was something that I always loved, and it turned into my way that I take care of my friends and my family and nurture people. My soup cookbook came about because I’ve been having a party every year for many, many years, and it’s on my birthday, because that’s a good way to get some great musicians to your house to entertain you for your birthday. I make these gigantic pots of soup, and usually I make one that’s kind of friendly to all different diet situations, and then I make one that’s kind of ethnic, or from some place that I’ve been – Brazil or Thailand or someplace like that. And I’ll make another kind of soup that’s kind of risky. I’ve never had a fail yet, but I’ve gotten down to the wire where it’s two hours before and the black beans are still hard as rocks. The cookbook is full of pictures of all the years of my buddies – the Kim Carnes, and the Keb’ Mo’s and everybody – who comes to the party every year and entertain me and while I cook for them. So that’s how the book came about. And there’s 52 recipes. There’s one for every week.\n\nQ: Who influences you musically?\n\nA: I started out with being really into the country rock time period, which was Emmylou Harris, and everything from the Eagles and Michael Martin Murphey, all that stuff. Michael Martin Murphey was my first concert, and he’s a pal, and I have his phone number, so is that weird or what? ... But I think I started out with Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris – my first people that I wanted to emulate. And then as time went on, I got in the Bonnie Raitt and more of the kind of popular folk singers and people, because I was going to school in Illinois, and there were lots of people in Chicago that were making great music. So I would get in trouble for taking my mom’s car to Chicago and just go hang out and haunt some of the folk clubs up there, see John Prine and Steve Goodman and all these people. And then, eventually, it just kind of took over my art degree and I ended up doing that full time.\n\nQ: Do you have any dream collaborations? Is there anyone you haven’t worked with who you’d really love to?\n\nA: So many. I have tons and tons. Right before the lockdown, I was touring with Pam Tillis and Terri Clark, and that was so much fun. We didn’t really ever get to record anything – I would like to record with both guys. And then the last two years before this year, I was with Kathy Mattea, and we’ve guested on each other’s records through the years, and that’s always been a lot of fun. And of course, we had a Grammy nod with “Teach Your Children” with Alison Krause and Graham Nash, so we have had a chance to work together. Vince Gill has been on so many of my albums, but I’d love to sing a duet with him. ... I got to make a whole album with Chet Atkins. I can’t really complain about the collaboration thing. This last album that I put out in November, I had Colin Linden playing guitar (from) Blackie and the Rodeo Kings – if you don’t know that group, you need to check them out. But he’s just the most amazing slide electric guitarist. You know, he quit school, and as kid went down and studied under Muddy Waters and all these guys down in the South. ... It’s just the kind of thing where you’re like, I can’t believe I get to make music with people.\n\nTerms and condition of the show\n\nGeneral Admission does not include seating, so camp chairs are welcome.

I really like challenging myself, so I went to make a record in New York with Jason Miles. And Jason is a jazz producer, and he also was the keyboard player for Miles Davis. So I mean, we’re talking real jazz, right? And I went in there with five songs, and I called my husband from the studio, and I was like, ‘Oh my God, I don’t know what I’m doing. What am I? Why am I trying to sing jazz?’ ... And it ended up just being such a wonderful experience. I ended up learning how to write songs in that style. The stuff that you learn from collaborations is unbelievable.\n\nQ: Why do you keep doing this? What keeps you going?\n\nA: The folks. I mean, I’m such a ham bone. When we were locked down, I was so sad because I couldn’t hear people clapping, I had to just look at little hearts going up. I love the whole energy exchange of a live program. I think that there’s just so much to that of just whatever is happening right now with serendipitous never gonna happen just like this again. And that’s what keeps me going. I mean, it’s like every day is different, and I feel fortunate for that.\n\nkatie@durangoherald.com"
