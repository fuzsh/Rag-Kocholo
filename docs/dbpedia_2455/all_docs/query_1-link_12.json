        "text": "I’m thankful for the time I’ve spent at Stockdale High School. I’ve met great people, had some awesome teachers, and had plenty of fun at rallies and football games! The school has a wide variety of clubs and electives for students to choose from. Pretty good AP and Honors courses, too. Like any school, Stockdale also has its issues. Some of the library staff can be rude towards students and there are fights pretty often. Also, not to mention the lunch food and the bathrooms? Naaaasty sometimes!\n\nI mentioned meeting a lot of great people but I’ve also met some rude ones too. Mean people who think that they’re better than any and everyone and look at you like you actually did something terrible to them. Like, hurt their entire family or something. But those kinds of people are everywhere so not really Stockdale’s fault, LOL. Also my friend got suspended without any valid reason one time. Thankfully she was able to undo it but, seriously? Seriously.\n\nOverall, my experience with Stockdale High School has been pretty good in my three years here. Academic wise, there are very good classes with teachers that are very determined to teach their students well. Club/activity wise, I wish there were more clubs, but I heard the administration makes it very hard to create new ones. I wish the school would put more focus on the arts instead of just the sports.\n\nMy experience at this school is pretty boring. I believe that this school is merely focused on the involvement of students but do not encourage it enough. This school also says that they care about a students feelings but they never truly acknowledge them. I believe that this school has a lot to improve and build on, but the academics make up for it. This school has great academic opportunities.\n\nThe academics at Stockdale High are outstanding, as well as the various clubs the school offers. The school contains many drive and intelligent students, as well as offers a great music program. However, the safety, or rather lack of safety, at Stockdale is very concerning for the students. The staff is underprepared for various situations and has handled past threats in an awful manner. The faculty at Stockdale are rude and look down upon students and parents. The school could have easily been considered the best in comparison to other schools in the district, however, it has faced a major downfall.\n\nStockdale High School is great academically, but fails to meet the need of the majority of students that have different learning abilities. Not everyone can be taught a subject in the same way because not everyone can grasp a concept from just one example. Other than that, Stockdale High School is on par with pretty much every other high school in America.\n\nThe school offers (and excels in) a lot of extracurricular activities and sports. There's also a lot of AP and Honors classes available. My biggest complaint is that \"advanced\" classes are not actually that rigorous, and it seems like they allow a lot of kids to take these classes even if they're not quite suited to a high-level class. The class is more so just a title as opposed to a higher standard of education. I don't know why they do that, but that's my observation.\n\nMy experience was fine. I made some great friends, and had a few good teachers. But the school district and administrative were not very communicative and honest with their own staff, nor students and parents. We recently had a school shooting scare, and the district handled it very poorly. So when it comes to real life worries, they handle it very poorly.\n\nStockdale High is a great school with very kind people. There are many different clubs, sports, and opportunities. The diversity is also great, giving you the ability to see different personalities and perspectives. However, there are some issues. At the beginning of this school year, most people’s schedules were flawed and in need of fixing. The school was also implementing a new way of distributing books and schedules. No one was informed on these changes. As a result everyone was left confused and it made the whole process chaotic. Stockdale has brought me lots of joy throughout my years of high school, but some changes need to be made.\n\nFirst and foremost, the faculty and staff at Stockdale are incredibly dedicated and passionate about their roles as educators. Their unwavering commitment to student success is evident in every interaction. Teachers go above and beyond to ensure that each student receives the support they need to thrive. They create a stimulating learning environment that encourages critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration.\n\nBeyond the classroom, Stockdale High School offers an array of extracurricular activities that cater to every interest and talent. Whether it's joining one of the numerous clubs, participating in sports teams, or engaging in community service initiatives, students are encouraged to pursue their passions and develop their leadership skills. These activities not only enhance the overall high school experience but also prepare students for life beyond graduation."
