He participated in the AIME and received USNCO Honors. He is especially  talented at driving away others with corny chemistry jokes, especially his  teammates, which is rather concerning. Additionally, after witnessing the  plight of one of his coaches when she attempts to read complex, multisyllabic  answer choices, Alor has learned to listen carefully. Always one to figure out  how to maximize his chances of winning without preparation, Alor plans to  develop an optimized guessing strategy that will magically beat the odds.\n Emaad Sohail is a senior at Stockdale High School. He has  participated in high school Science Bowl since his freshman year and  participated in the national competition in his junior year. In the fall, he  plans to attend UCLA with a pre-computational and systems biology major. When  not doing homework or studying, Emaad enjoys watching shows and reading, as  well as taking walks in the local park. Currently, his favorite series are One  Piece and Haikyuu. Emaad has an older sister named Eesha who also attends UCLA  and participated in Science Bowl when she was in high school, as well as an eight-year-old  younger brother named Aden, who is in second grade.\n Ishaan Brar is a senior. He is the president of Stockdale  Forensics Club, and is involved with Math Club, National Honor Society, and is  an Eagle Scout. His favorite subjects are biology, history, and chemistry. His  (very optimistic) long term plan is to pursue MD Ph.D.. He would like to  research the intersections of genetic modifications and auto-immune diseases.  His current scientific research centers on inventing improved catheters, for  which he won fourth in biomedical engineering at the Intel ISEF competition. He  has been awarded the Prudential Award for his volunteer work with the  underserved. His claim to fame are his ability to sleep in any situation,  incredibly fast reading speed, and massive science fiction nerdiness.\nKabir Rahal is a junior who, despite his atrocious computer  science skills, hopes to figure out a way to control this phenomenon known as  “clientside,” which is common on discord servers and has recently caused him  much grief. Kabir has attended Nationals four times, and unfortunately, his  friends say that this number is “more times than he can count,” clearly a  testament to his subpar counting skills. Other questionable abilities of his  include baking, where he terribly burnt cookies which were then used as  frisbees to solve projectile motion problems to help his teammate Alor practice  his physics skills. Kabir is also notably a mineral enthusiast, and hopes to  qualify for USESO camp so he can lick halite with his favorite IESO bronze  medalist, Alec Zhu. Kabir hopes to become a doctor one day, and in the  meantime, is very intent on reading Vander’s Physiology instead of memorizing  the chemical formula for geocronite, named after the legendary Geoffrey Wu.\n Rhea Sharma is a sophomore who, despite being a passionate  car and Formula One enthusiast, has not gotten her learner’s permit. Her other  talents include painting, surfing, dozing off during her first period honor’s  chemistry class, and incorporating her skills of biology to inform her  seven-year-old cousin that eating an earthworm does not count as dinner. In  Rhea’s natural habitat, you can either see her roaming around Bakersfield with  her friends or curled up with her Campbell’s Biology Book. Rhea has attended  nationals three times. She has aspirations of going to UCLA and going on to  become the next Elon Musk (minus the car part) of biotech.",
