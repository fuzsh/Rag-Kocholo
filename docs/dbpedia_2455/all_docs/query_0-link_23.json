        "text": "Our Goals\n\nAcademic Excellence\n\nOur students will experience exceptional teaching and maximize their academic abilities as they learn to thrive in a highly-rated private school setting taught entirely in English.\n\nOur students will successfully participate in rigorous schoolwork, which will prepare them for advanced high school classes and, ultimately, admission to top-ranked universities.\n\nPersonal Growth\n\nOur students will live with a safe and supportive American family who will welcome them into their homes and hearts.\n\nOur students will build confidence and strong work habits, improving their academic performance and preparing them for high school and university success.\n\nCultural Development\n\nOur students will have educational and social experiences that will facilitate fluency in English and develop an understanding of American culture.\n\nOur students will learn from academic field trips to cultural sites, museums, art galleries, and important American monuments, allowing them to understand the similarities and differences of global cultures.\n\nStudent Success\n\nHighly qualified teachers will ensure all international students understand the American education system. Each teacher will provide exceptional instruction that challenges the students academically, to work diligently, and to think critically. Students at Stockdale Christian School are held to the highest standards academically and behaviorally.\n\nInternational students will be welcomed by their new classmates and quickly develop new friendships that will help each student feel like an essential part of a new school community.\n\nFINANCIAL POLICY 2024-2025\n\nThe school will issue an invoice for the tuition amount and any additional required fees once the student has been accepted as a student, and has received the appropriate student visa.\n\nAll funds should be paid electronically within three days of receiving the invoice, and a receipt will be returned once the tuition payment transaction is complete.\n\nInternational students will not be allowed to attend classes until tuition has been paid in full."
