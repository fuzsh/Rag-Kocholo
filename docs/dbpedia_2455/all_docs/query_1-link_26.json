        "text": "Educating tomorrowâs teachers and scientists\n\nThe B.S. in Natural Sciences offers a broad foundation in all four of the natural science areas (Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics). The disciplinary concentrations add depth preparation in two of the four areas, while the foundational science concentration adds teaching credential coursework to this foundation. Although this degree program has been developed for prospective middle and high school science teachers, it also serves as excellent preparation for employment in any area of business, industry, or government where scientific skills are in demand.\n\nThis degree program offers the required subject matter content to help prepare prospective science teachers for subject matter certification in California by taking the California Subject Matter Examinations for Teachers (CSET) in Science. For students who already have a degree and would like to be certified as subject matter competent in the sciences, please see www.cset.nesinc.com for information on the CSET Exams."
