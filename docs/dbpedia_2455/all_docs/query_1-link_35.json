It was originally designed to meet the needs of Panama-Buena Vista Union School District staff but it is now open to the public. The Lab is a revolving door for teachers, aides, and classroom volunteers who come to complete projects for classrooms. However, since we are now open to the public, we have visitors from churches, scout groups, daycares, etc., who utilize our lab also.\n\nThe lab offers a wide variety of curriculum tools such as:\n\nLaminating machines (various widths)\n\nLamination materials (various qualities/thicknesses)\n\nArt Supplies\n\nPoster Machine\n\nCopier\n\nPaper Supplies\n\nVariQuest Die Cutting Machine\n\nBook Binding Machine\n\nCurriculum Files/Books\n\nIdea Books, Magazines, & Clip Art Catalogs\n\nReady to go Posters for the classroom"
