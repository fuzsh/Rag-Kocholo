        "text": "Summary:\n\nStockdale High is a public high school located in Bakersfield, California, serving grades 9-12 with a total enrollment of 2,298 students. The school is part of the Kern High School District, which is ranked 850 out of 1,560 districts in California and has a 2-star rating from SchoolDigger.\n\nStockdale High consistently ranks among the top high schools in California, ranking 296 out of 2,335 schools in the 2022-2023 school year and receiving a 4-star rating from SchoolDigger. The school's academic performance is significantly higher than the district and state averages across various subjects, including English Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science. For example, in the 2022-2023 school year, Stockdale High had 71.96% of students proficient or better in English Language Arts, compared to the South High at 57.25%, Bakersfield High at 49.01%, and West High at 50.28%. Stockdale High also maintains a consistently high four-year graduation rate of 95.7% and a low dropout rate of 2.5%.\n\nWhile Stockdale High's overall performance is exceptional, the school faces some challenges. The school has experienced a notable increase in chronic absenteeism, from 4.8% in the 2018-2019 school year to 12.2% in the 2022-2023 school year. Additionally, the school's performance for students with disabilities and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, while still strong compared to the district and state, is not as high as its overall academic performance. By addressing these areas, Stockdale High can continue to maintain its strong academic standing and ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed.\n\nDetail:"
