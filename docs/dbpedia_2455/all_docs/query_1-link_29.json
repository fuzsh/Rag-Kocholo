        "text": "At Stockdale Christian School we have three primary goals for each of our students. First, we want each student to BELIEVE in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and then we want to help that relationship grow. Second, our teachers help each child recognize Godâ€™s divine design in their lives and push them to ACHIEVE academic and co-curricular goals built on excellence. Finally, our students are taught the importance of loving their neighbor and are given opportunities to SERVE courageously in their community and beyond.\n\nOur desire as a school is to walk alongside you in the parenting journey, believing in the scripture that tells us to train up a child in the way they should go so that when they are old, they will not depart from it.\n\nChristian education is an investment into the heart and mind of your child, and it is an investment that every parent should prayerfully consider.\n\nWe look forward to having the opportunity to serve your family!"
