This program is designed to meet the needs of all students on all different academic levels. This program takes into account the whole child and the child’s current levels of functioning. From students demonstrating need for academic support who are significantly below grade level to students showing the need for challenge who operate significantly above grade level, DISCOVER has programs to meet each student’s needs."
