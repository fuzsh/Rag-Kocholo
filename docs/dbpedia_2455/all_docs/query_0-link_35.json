High school teams face off in twn categories of the competition over two days — Speech, interviews, essays, mathematics, economics, science, music, art, social science and literature.\n\nAn “Oral Super Quiz” also takes place as part of the event. It’s a pressure-packed 90-minutes of excitement, run like a TV quiz show. Team members have ten seconds to collaborate and answer each question. Running totals are displayed on large, visible flip cards, bringing about enthusiastic reactions from the audience.\n\nAcademic Decathlon Coaches Meeting\n\nThursday, August 29, 2024 • 4:00 p.m.\n\nZoom Meeting • https://kcsos.zoom.us/j/3532714515\n\nAcademic Decathlon Online Essay\n\nMonday, January 13, 2025\n\nVirtual Competition • Link will be provided prior to event\n\nAcademic Decathlon Interview Day\n\nWednesday, January 22, 2025\n\nVirtual Competition • Link will be provided prior to event\n\nAcademic Decathlon Online Objective Testing\n\nJanuary 29, 2025\n\nVirtual Competition • Link will be provided prior to event\n\nAcademic Decathlon Speech & Super Quiz\n\nSaturday, February 1, 2025\n\nStockdale High School, Bakersfield\n\nRegistration"
