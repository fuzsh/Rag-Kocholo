Together, we are Bellevue.\n\nThe youth mental health crisis in America awakened me to take action, not to cower in fear. Research shows that early intervention and treatment can make a difference for our young people. That’s why I’m on a mission to support and bring the best mental health support for our kids through the Bellevue Schools Foundation. They deserve a chance to thrive and succeed and they need to know they are not alone.”\n\nSee 2023-2024 BSF Investments at Bellevue High School and Districtwide\n\nMs. Strazulla’s staff and teachers have put in a lot of efforts in creating a safe and happy environment at school for the kids.
