Evaluation metrics for all 106 of the high schools included in this study are shown in the 2020 San Antonio public high school rankings presented below.\n\nMost Texas high schools offer a four-year curriculum at a single campus, but some school districts have chosen to operate separate campuses for ninth grade students or for ninth and tenth grade students. In this analysis, the performance metrics for Texas high schools that are a part of these multiple campus arrangements are combined and the schools are evaluated in the same manner as the four-year, single-campus high schools. Other independent school districts and some charter districts operate schools that teach more than four grades. The STAAR assessment student performance metric used in this best Texas high schools ranking is for all grade levels taught at those schools.\n\nUnlike some other San Antonio high school rankings this analysis examines only the most current academic performance data available and no consideration is given to student demographics, changes in student performance over time on the STAAR tests, and other such factors or to subjective factors such as anonymous self-selected reviews and statistically invalid online opinion surveys. Additional information about how the performance of these San Antonio public high schools was evaluated and ranked in this analysis is presented in the Methodology description at the bottom of this page.\n\nTo provide additional perspective regarding each schools’ academic performance, an academic performance index that indicates the relative performance of each Texas high school was constructed based on the four evaluation factors used in this analysis. Each school also has been assigned an academic performance score based where it is ranked in the academic performance index. The top 10 percent of the high schools included in this study received an academic performance score of 10, high schools in the next lower, ninth decile received a score of 9, and so on.\n\n2020 San Antonio public high school rankings\n\nThe data presented in this table can be sorted by clicking on the table headings.

The first of these metrics, the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) score is the scaled score of all STAAR assessments administered to district students during the 2018-2019 school year. The Advance Placement / International Baccalaureate (AP/IB) and the SAT and ACT college admission tests metrics are the number of students meeting college-ready criteria specified in the Texas Success Initiative (TSI), a state-legislated program to improve student success in college.\n\nWithin each evaluation category, the top rated Texas high school was awarded the maximum points allocated to that category and all other schools were awarded a proportional number of points based on how their individual scores compared to the score of the top rated school. Scores from both evaluation categories were then added together to arrive at the school's academic performance index. Performance on STAAR tests: 60 points\n\nA maximum of 60 points was awarded based on the percentage of a school's students meeting the TEA's achievement standards on the STAAR reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies subject assessments. The STAAR score shown in the table above is calculated by first adding equal weightings of the percentage of assessments on which students’ performance mastered grade level, met grade level and approached grade level, dividing the sum by 3 and rounding it to the nearest whole percentage. The TEA refers to this as the raw STAAR component score. This raw score is then adjusted or “scaled” by using a conversion table to align letter grades and raw component scores of Texas public school districts and campuses. Because the precision of the scaled STAAR star is significantly diminished by this process, the raw STAAR component score is used in this analysis to measure relative performance on the STAAR tests. College readiness indicators: 40 points\n\nA maximum of 20 points was awarded based on percentage of students in grades 11-12 participating and successfully completing AP/IB courses. The school with the highest scores on the College Board AP examinations or IB examinations in English language arts, mathematics, science and social studies was awarded the maximum points for each subject area category. A maximum of 20 points also was awarded to the school with the top SAT and ACT scores.\n\nLooking for the best real estate agent to assist you in buying a home in the Dallas suburbs?"
