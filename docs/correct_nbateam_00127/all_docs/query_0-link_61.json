        "text": "On the things that are becoming an issue in the labor talks: “I don’t know the ins and outs of the flex cap. I think it’s a pretty clever term by Commissioner Stern. The main issues for us are the revenue sharing amongst the big market teams and the small market teams. That will really lead the discussion to what share the players will share with the owners. The league maintains that the revenue sharing is an internal matter and they will take care of it themselves. We think it’s a huge part of the bigger picture, the big collective bargaining discussion. Once we sort of see how the revenues are going to be split amongst the teams I think that will be a huge, huge advantage to getting a deal done.”\n\nKnicks guard Roger Mason doesn’t dispute that NBA teams are losing money but he says it’s not because of the collective bargaining agreement that expired last week. With the raging debate on the NBA’s claim that it lost $260 million this past season, Mason, the head of the players’ negotiating team, was quoted on a blog on day six of the lockout yesterday that is sure to rankle NBA commissioner David Stern. “We’re not here questioning their books,” Mason said. “Do we think 22 teams lost money because of the system? No, we don’t feel like the system is the reason 22 teams lost money.”\n\nShane Battier on If he thinks a new deal will get done in the NBA: “I’m cautiously optimistic that we will get something done before missing any games. We all know what’s at stake. We can’t afford to go through what the NFL is going through and we can’t afford to lose the fans. I just think we have a perspective after going through this in ’99 that it’s in the best interest of everybody to hammer out a fair deal.”\n\nShane Battier joined WFAN in New York with Joe and Evan to talk about the season Memphis had, what kind of teammate Zach Randolph is, what he made of LeBron James’ failures in the NBA Finals, if he thinks a team loaded with stars like Miami is the way to go, whether or not he thinks a new CBA will get done, and what he thinks the main issues are right now in the labor talks. Whether or not they knew they would go as far as they did in the playoffs: “We knew that we had a favorable matchup in the Spurs. Did we think we could beat them and take the Thunder in second round to seven games? I’d be lying to say I knew that was going to happen. We knew we had a chance against the Spurs. We felt that we matched up great against them. We were younger and we were more athletic. After we won that first game in San Antonio, we all looked at each other and said ‘hey guys we can do this.’ We went on a magical run, the city was behind us, it was simply electric, and it was a fantastic lightning in a bottle run for us.”\n\nShane Battier’s question, directed to Players Association executive director Billy Hunter, was simple: The NFL’s union leader, DeMaurice Smith, had agreed to take $1 in salary for the length of the NFL lockout. Will you do it too, Billy? The mere suggestion seemed to offend Hunter, players witnessing the exchange privately told Yahoo! Sports. After Hunter told Battier he hadn’t given it much thought, members of the union’s executive board came to Hunter’s defense. Hunter had taken the union from the red to the black in his term, done a good job, they said. Hunter never did give Battier a firm answer, nor would he answer the question for Yahoo! Sports on Wednesday.\n\nBattier seemed more certain about basketball criteria concerning his future. “I don’t have to start and play 40 minutes,” he said. “I just want to have a role and be one of the guys a coach can lean on.” Whether Battier stays or not, Wallace sounded more inclined to continue augmenting the Grizzlies’ young core with veteran contributors. Wallace said a designated shooter won’t be found in the draft, especially given the Griz only own a late second-round pick."
