        "text": "Shane Battier (@ShaneBattier), a PCA National Advisory Board Member, led Duke to the 2001 NCAA National Championship while distinguishing himself as the 2001 Academic All-American of the year. He also helped win two NBA championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013, but is more renowned for being a “no stats all-star” due to his unselfish play and ability to make his teammates better.\n\nIn this video, Battier shares that although leaders can have several personalities, all leaders work hard. Leadership for athletes is not about talent, but about attitude and daily work ethic. That means working hard even when no one is noticing. Whether or not you are a vocal leader, an exemplary work ethic builds your credibility.\n\nJrNBA"
