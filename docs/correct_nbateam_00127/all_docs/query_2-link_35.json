        "text": "so 82games just updated the plus/minus information for teams so now battier actually has some minutes played on memphis and guess how our ol' friend is doing.\n\nhttp://www.82games.com/1011/1011MEM.HTM\n\nyep, a solid +8.8 net plus/minus. he has played 457 minutes (a little less than 10 games) and is +96 on the court. so basically +10 per 48 minutes. very impressive.\n\nnote: i would've checked earlier on basketballvalue which updates all the time but memphis appears to have disappeared. not only does no team information pop up, but anyone who played there and was traded doesn't show up on their new team (i.e. thabeet) and no one traded there shows up on their old team (i.e. battier). also, knickerblogger's stats page only has 29 teams right now. the missing team? memphis.\n\nLol @ plus/minus...I thought this simplistic stat was debunked a long time ago as not being an accurate reflection of what actually happens on the court, which is why you have to watch the games. So Battier has more of a positive impact than Tony Allen even though Allen by practically everybody's admission is playing and head shoulders above Battier. And guess who's #1 in the link provided above....wait for it...wait for it...the great Hamed Haddadi, lol! That's all you need to know to understand that plus/minus is worthless. Jared Jeffries had some amazing +/- once upon a time too."
