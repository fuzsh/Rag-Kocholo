        "text": "Shane Battier is coming back to Memphis. No, not to run for mayor or anything. To join the raucous good fun at Staxtacular, the shindig Shane and Heidi Battier — along with Brian Cardinal and his wife, Danielle — started 13 years ago to raise money for the Stax Music Academy.\n\nThe event is Saturday night at the Stax Museum. Y’all should definitely come. I spoke with Battier by telephone about his return to Memphis, and his time with the Grizzlies.\n\nQ: How do you feel about coming back?\n\nA: “We’re excited. Memphis will always hold a very special place in our hearts, it’s where we broke into the NBA, where we started our adult life, where we made many friendships that we still hold dear today. The NBA world is transient. After being in the league for 15, 16 years, when you find deep relationships, you treasure them. We love Memphis, we will always be Memphians even though we live in Miami now. It will be a real treat to come back.”\n\nQ: You and Pau Gasol joined the Grizzlies as rookies in 2001. Does that feel like a lifetime ago?\n\nA: In many regards, it does. In other regards, it feels like yesterday. I have a picture of me and Pau, I think on our first day, on media day. Pau was absolutely baby-faced. We didn’t know anything. Not that we know anything now, but we really didn’t know anything then. Obviously, Pau has gone on to win multiple championships, he’ll be a Hall-of-Famer, and I guess I did OK, too.”\n\nQ: Back then, did you know Pau was going to be this good?\n\nA: “No doubt. He was special. The first time I played against him, it was at Rhodes College in a pickup-up game, we were playing on the side hoops. We were playing against Big Country. And he kicked Big Country’s butt. This kid was unlike anything I’d ever seen, his length, his touch, his athleticism. I’m proud of him. He’s had a tremendous career.”\n\nQ: You were the faces of the franchise as rookies. What was that like?\n\nA: “We didn’t know any better. We were just kids hoping and trying to get a few wins. We were in survival mode in basketball terms. We didn’t think about the ramifications of being the face of a franchise, or building a culture. We were just trying to win some games, and rally the fans. It was a really pure, simple time.”\n\nQ: Then Hubie Brown arrived. What was that like?\n\nA: “That was a tour de force. Morale was low on the team. I don’t know if the franchise ever thought we could win. I graduated from Duke as the all-time winningest basketball player, 133 wins, 15 losses, nobody had ever topped that. The Grizzlies had the lowest winning percentage of any team in the four major league sports. I went from the best to the worst, the the penthouse to the outhouse. I don’t know if the Grizzlies as a whole, if anybody believed we could win. But the first thing Hubie told us was, `Look, we can win. We’re going to have a philosophy, we’re going to have a system, and we’re going to win.’ It started with the guys on the floor, but it permeated through the entire franchise. He was our Luke Skywalker. and our Yoda, and everything he said came true. I love Hubie. He’s the closest thing to a grandpa that I ever had. Whenever I see him, I give him a huge hug and he kisses me on the cheek.”\n\nQ: Those teams never won a playoff game, but looking back, is it remarkable you went to the playoffs three straight years?\n\nA: “It was. I’m proud of those teams. We would have liked to win a playoff game, but we maximized what we were capable of and that’s the hope of any team. It was about Hubie and the platoon system that he implemented. We had a bunch of really good players. Pau was our only great player, but we had a bunch of really good players, and it translated.”\n\nQ: You were traded to Houston, but returned to Memphis in 2011 to help the Grizzlies defeat the Spurs in the playoffs. What do you remember about that?\n\nA: “That was the most surreal period of my career and my personal life, as well. I had so many emotions coming back to Memphis. I didn’t know how I was going to fit professionally. I was going into free agency, I was leaving my wife on bed rest. I was by myself in Memphis with my old buddies. It was surreal to be back. I was lucky that I was going back to a city that had a lot of love for me. If I had been traded to Utah or Boston or Oklahoma or some city that I had no connection to, I can’t imagine how I would have struggled. The city really saved me.”\n\nQ: And then you made the shot to give Memphis its first playoff win.\n\nA: “I’m a very cautious player. That was probably the most aggressive I’ve been, like, `I’m just going to shoot this dagger shot right now.’ And it went in. I wanted to scream and holler but I tried to be cool. I was fired up. I knew what it meant to the city, you could feel the collective burden coming off. `Yeah, we can win in the playoffs.’ And then doing it against the Spurs. It really was a Hollywood ending.”\n\nQ: And on top of that, you then drove to Houston to be there as Heidi delivered a baby.\n\nA: Eloise. She's going to be seven in April.\n\nQ: Some thought you’d run for office. You did some television. Now you’re with the Miami Heat front office. How is that?\n\nA: “I’m enjoying my role. Once you’re in this game, it pulls you back. I love it. I had an opportunity in Miami, an organization I love, to be involved with a game that has been my entire career.”\n\nQ. Give me a few works about some former teammates. Start with Pau Gasol.\n\nA: “Intelligent. Hall of Fame.”\n\nQ: Jason Williams.\n\nA: “White Chocolate. That sums it up.”\n\nQ: Lorenzen Wright, who is no longer with us.\n\nA: “Memphis. He was Memphis. You could feel it. You could feel what basketball meant to the city through Lorenzen.”\n\nQ: James Posey.\n\nA: “He was the straw. He made our team go.”\n\nQ: Marc Gasol.\n\nA: “Passion. Passion and strength. Marc is a presence and has a strength about him that’s unmistakeable.”\n\nQ: Finally, tell me about Staxtacular. How did this come to pass?\n\nA:.”Brian Cardinal and I, it was nearly 15 years ago, we were sitting around saying we should do something for the city, find a cause. Danielle and Heidi really led the charge. It was the perfect venue and it was the perfect mission, to use basketball as a platform to raise awareness and raise a lot of money for an impressive group of kids. We’r’e really looking forward to Saturday. It’ll be special to be back.”"
