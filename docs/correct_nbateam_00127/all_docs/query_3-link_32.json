        "text": "The Detroit Pistons parted ways with coach and team president Stan Van Gundy a little more than a week ago in the first phase of a restructuring of the team’s front office. At that time, several names had cropped up to take on a role with the Pistons, including Turner Sports analyst Brent Barry.\n\nAccording to Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, the Miami Heat have granted the Pistons permission to talk with executive and former Heat player Shane Battier about a position in Detroit’s new-look front office:\n\nBattier has been the Heat’s director of basketball development and analytics since Feb. 16, 2017, a role that has had him largely working behind the scenes in the team’s front office, as well as handling community appearances. The position was created for his return to the franchise.\n\nA move to Detroit’s front office would represent somewhat of a homecoming for the former Heat forward, who was born and raised in Birmingham, Mich., just outside of Detroit.\n\nBattier, whose affinity for analytics dates to his playing career, traveled with the Heat this season on trips that general manager Andy Elisburg did not make. He is listed below Heat president Pat Riley, Elisburg, vice president of player personnel Chet Kammerer, vice president of player programs Alonzo Mourning and assistant general manager Adam Simon on the team’s organizational chart.\n\nESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that others around the NBA are among the candidates for the Pistons’ front office job, including NBA executive Kiki VanDeWeghe, Memphis Grizzlies executive Ed Stefanski, Houston Rockets executive Gersson Rosas, Brooklyn Nets executive Trajan Langdon and current Pistons GM Jeff Bower. Per Wojnarowski, Bower is handling the team’s current Draft preparations."
