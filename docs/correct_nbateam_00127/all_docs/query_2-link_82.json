        "text": "Shane Battier was an original member of the Memphis Grizzlies, having been drafted by the franchise in 2001 as it relocated from Vancouver to Tennessee. In 2006, the Grizzlies traded him to Houston for Rudy Gay. But the Rockets sent him back this season, for Hasheem Thabeet. In the interim, Memphis didn't make a single postseason.\n\nBattier's back, and so are the playoffs for Memphis. And Shane came up huge for the Grizzlies, nailing the game-winning three-pointer over the San Antonio Spurs with 10 seconds left in Game 1.\n\nIt was quite a turn of events, as Memphis looked like it was choking away a sure win by missing free throws and giving up open dagger threes to Matt Bonner. But Tony Allen sparked a run to get Memphis back in play, and Battier pushed the Grizzlies back on top. San Antonio struggled to get a good shot off at the other end, with Richard Jefferson eventually bricking a three with time expiring."
