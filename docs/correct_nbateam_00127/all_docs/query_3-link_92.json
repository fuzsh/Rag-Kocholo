        "text": "Moreover, almost no former NBA players are currently employed by NBA team analytics departments. One of the very few, it should come as no surprise, is Shane Battier, Miami’s vice president of basketball development and analytics, who played for Morey in Houston from 2006-10 — and was the subject of a Michael Lewis (of “Moneyball” fame) profile in the New York Times in 2009 extolling the Rockets’ Way. (Lewis wound up writing a book about Morey as well, so, one guesses he was a fan.) The reason it matters is this: NBA teams, rather consistently over the last decade, have chosen the next generation of team executives from video rooms and/or their own or other teams’ front offices. And analytics people now dominate those front offices. So it shouldn’t be a surprise that less than a third of NBA teams are run by Black or minority executives:\n\nThe rules were simple and were part of the reason that he chose Wade: Morey could only select inactive players through the 2K draft, unless they currently play for the Rockets. So James Harden, shockingly rated at 79 overall, was certainly an option for Morey. And that’s exactly who he took to complement Wade in the backcourt. The Rockets are known for their distinctive small-ball style of play, and Morey took that same approach to the game, though the league had not yet reached that type of modernity yet. Shane Battier (former Rocket) was next, followed by the likes of Nikola Mirotic, Jameer Nelson and Marcus Camby.\n\nMiami stands as one of the most analytics-friendly teams in the league, a skill that can in-part be attributed to Battier. So how did Battier get schooled in the world of analytics? Rockets general manager Daryl Morey deserves a share of the credit. “I was lucky to play for Daryl Morey and Sam Hinkie, who taught me how to look at the data,” Battier told The Athletic’s Kelly Iko and Mo Dakhil. “Analytics is like blackjack. When the dealer has a five showing, what do you do? You double down. Why? Because the book tells you that is the best play at the time and gives you the most chance to win the hand and win money.”"
