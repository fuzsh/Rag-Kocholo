        "text": "Is there any chance Marc Gasol might not be back in Memphis? Wallace: “It’s not in my wildest dreams.” Where is Rudy Gay going to fit back in with the team? Hollins: “He’s going to be the starting small forward.” What’s the situation with Shane Battier? Wallace: “Shane’s going to be a guy who is in great demand by a wide variety of teams.”\n\nThe Bulls continued Wednesday to cast a wide net, contacting representatives for Caron Butler, Grant Hill, Shane Battier, Kurt Thomas, Jamal Crawford, Josh Howard, T.J. Ford, Keith Bogans and several others. Because no deals can be signed until Dec. 9, Wednesday marked a day for all teams to start gauging the market and seeing what options and interest exists. The Bulls appear to be attempting to upgrade at shooting guard while expressing interest in bringing Bogans back with his $1.73 million option, likely in a reserve role."
