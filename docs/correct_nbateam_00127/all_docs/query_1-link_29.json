He was a great player, great ambassador for the team and city, and was a super nice guy.\n\nThat being said, we got the better end of the Rudy trade. If you put Rudy alongside Ron Artest, Yao Ming, Luis Scola, and Tracy McGrady, then they would probably be the second best team in the West (behind the Lakers).\n\n2009 Avg Stats:\n\nRudy Gay - 18.9 pts, 5.5 boards, 1.7 assists, .7 blocks, 1.2 steals, 2.6 TOs, 37 MPG\n\nShane Battier - 7.3 pts, 4.8 boards, 1.9 assists, 1.0 blocks, 1.2 steals, 1.0 TOs, 33 MPG\n\nRudy also makes $4 million less.\n\nJust keep in mind, battier shoots the ball about 3-10 times a game while rudy gay shoots the ball 12-24 times a game. That could make a big difference in overall scoring totals, otherwise battier has the better statistics minus .7 rebounds, but battier plays 4 less minutes per game.\n\nPost: #11\n\nRE: Shane Battier....\n\n(04-27-2009 06:57 PM)tmoneyinmphs Wrote:\n\n(04-27-2009 01:35 AM)UofMtigers2014 Wrote: As I've said since the trade for Rudy Gay, when the Grizzlies traded away Shane Battier...they traded their defense, clutch shooting, and leadership...as well as hope.\n\nThey also traded away their spot in the playoffs with houston in that deal.\n\nThat trade really upset me. Shane battier is a pro's pro. He takes the game seriously and never gives half a$$ effort. Shane does everything. He defends tough covers. He makes open shots including 3's. He is smart on helping defensively. Makes smart passes. He just does it all, but mainly he does whatever the team needs him to do. IMO, he is a great team player. Houston couldn't make the playoffs till they got him.\n\nIt's tough for me watching pau gasol at la. That trade turned them from a .500 club to a championship contender.\n\nI forgot where, but there was an article on Battier a couple of months ago about his preparation for games. Unlike anything I've ever seen in terms of the cerebral approach. He understands his physical limitations, and makes up for it by putting himself in the right position statistically on the floor at any given time. He also knows how to give up 25 points to a player and know that that actually helped his team (i.e. to Kobe) because of how much effort that player has to expend and how that drains the other team. It's utterly fascinating, and although it doesn't always translate in wins, when he sticks to his game and executes his unique approach to it, he knows he did everything he could to help his team win and can leave the floor with his head held high.\n\nEdit: here it is -- http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/magazi...ier-t.html\n\n(This post was last modified: 05-01-2009 09:42 AM by kabluey.)\n\nPost: #12\n\nRE: Shane Battier....\n\n(04-28-2009 01:09 PM)marktheapostle Wrote:\n\n(04-27-2009 09:36 AM)BARTLETTTIGER Wrote: What do you want to say, even with Shane Battier still on our team, we would not have been more than five to six games better with him.

His persona made many people like the Grizzlies even if they did not like the NBA. The Grizzlies have not had an identity since.\n\nHe makes one hate Duke less. Or at least respect their basketball program slightly more because of how he handled himself in Memphis and handles the game. At least me anyway.\n\nPost: #15\n\nRE: Shane Battier....\n\n(04-28-2009 01:09 PM)marktheapostle Wrote:\n\n(04-27-2009 09:36 AM)BARTLETTTIGER Wrote: What do you want to say, even with Shane Battier still on our team, we would not have been more than five to six games better with him.

What I think Memphis Grizzlies has missed most since he got traded to the Rockets is his leadership. His persona works anywhere because Shane Battier is a what you see is what you get kind of person, which says volumes about his parents and his upbringing. No matter where he goes, I will root him because he plays the game basketball ultimately the right way.\n\n(This post was last modified: 05-05-2009 07:27 AM by BARTLETTTIGER.)"
