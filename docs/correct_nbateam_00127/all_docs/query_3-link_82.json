        "text": "Lon Babby, a PCA-Phoenix Board Member, is a Senior Advisor for the Phoenix Suns (@Suns). He is best known for his time as an NBA agent for some of the game's most respected sportsmen: Tim Duncan, Shane Battier, Ray Allen and others. He also spent over 35 years as an attorney, starting with the Washington Redskins, and is known today as one of the 100 most powerful people in sports.\n\nIn this video, Babby discusses Shane Battier (@ShaneBattier), a PCA National Advisory Board Member who led Duke to the 2001 NCAA National Championship while distinguishing himself as the 2001 Academic All-American of the year. Battier helped win two NBA championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013, but is revered more as the “no stats all-star” due to his unselfish play and ability to make his teammates better.\n\nBattier's former NBA agent, Babby, describes how without being the star, Battier was consistently well respected for his unique abilities. Battier was a vocal leader and someone who could lead by example. As Babby notes, its not often in sports when you find leaders who can lead in multiple ways. For this reason, Battier was highly regarded and respected by everyone around him. This shows to every athlete, regardless of talent level, that they can make a difference and be one of the most respected on the team through leadership and work ethic, not just talent.\n\nJrNBA"
