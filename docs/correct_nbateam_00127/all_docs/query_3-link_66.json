        "text": "Jonathan Givony\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nMatt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nJoseph Treutlein\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nEric Weiss\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: The ultimate role player who is capable of doing a little bit of everything. Plays the 3 and the 4 effectively. Has good size and strength, but lacks ideal quickness and explosiveness. Arguably the most fundamentally sound player in the League. Can score in a variety of ways, but functions primarily as a jump shooter. Isnt a one-on-one player and tries to score by playing his role in an offense rather than asserting himself unnecessarily. Might be the best defensive forward in the NBA. Does the little things. Extremely high basketball IQ. A coachs dream. Has been a winner since his youth, garnering the Naismith award as a senior at Detroit Country Day high school and the Wooden Award as a senior at Duke. Possesses great leadership skills. Comes through when it counts. Becomes an extremely valuable asset to the Rockets when he is knocking down his perimeter shots. Plays a ton of minutes.\n\nOffense: Extremely sound and efficiency offensive player. Gets more than half of his offense as a spot up shooter. Very good in that role. Will hit shots from three point range with very good consistencymost of his shots come from behind the arc. Never takes a shot without his feet set. Very selective. Very predictable off the dribble. Tends to go to the rim when he drives right and pull up when he drives left. Wont assert himself off the dribble very often. Great finisher at the rim despite his lack of athleticism. Knows how to use fakes and protect the ball with his body to finisher with contact. Could should a better percentage from the foul line, although he rarely gets there. Passable ball handler. Good offensive rebounder. Great passer. Not turnover prone. The ideal system role player. Scores all his points in the flow of the offense. Doesnt do anything outside of himself.\n\nDefense: Probably the most fundamentally sound defender in the game. Wont reach unless he knows hell get enough of the ball to keep the play in front of him. Not afraid to get on the floor to grab loose balls. Gets in a good stance and moves his feet. Will block shots just by maintaining good position. Always gets his hands up on shooters. Understands the nuances of contesting shots. Great help side defender. Always knows his rotations and will slide over to protect the basket when his teammates get beat off the dribble. Loves to try and take charges. Calls dont always go his way. Will commit smart fouls at the rim when he knows a player isnt good from the line. Great defensive intangibles. Amazing awareness."
