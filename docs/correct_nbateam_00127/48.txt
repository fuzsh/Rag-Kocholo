Today has been a very busy day for NBA General Managers and executives. Memphis Grizzlies GM Chris Wallace pulled the trigger on a trade that will help the Grizzlies improve their playoff chances. The Memphis Grizzlies acquired Shane Battier for Hasheem Thabeet and a first-round draft pick.

Battier is not a name that jumps off the page, but he is well-respected throughout the NBA. The Grizzlies have a hole at the Small Forward position with Rudy Gay out due to injury. Sam Young is a solid role player, but Battier is a glue guy that every young team needs.

Battier is back in familiar territory. In 2001, Battier was selected fifth overall by the Grizzlies. Battier played six seasons with the Grizz before being traded to the Houston Rockets in a draft day trade that helped the Grizzlies land promising star Rudy Gay.

The Grizzlies may have a legitimate chance of making the playoffs with the decline of the Utah Jazz and other teams in the Western Conference. The addition of Shane Battier will add defense and maturity to Grizzlies Roster. Role players such as Tony Allen and Shane Battier are defensive players who have the capability to score 10 to 12 points with no problem.

Battier is an ambassador of the community and shows great leadership off the court. Battier presents himself with professionalism. It would greatly benefit the younger players on the Grizzlies roster to see how Battier conducts himself on a day to day basis.

By losing Hasheem Thabeet the Grizzlies did not lose much to gain a quality player. General Manager Chris Wallace is often scrutinized for his judgement, but today he made a great roster move that can help enhance his team's playoff chances.

Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Gerald Wallace and Aaron Brooks may steal all recent trade headlines, but the acquisition of Shane Battier to the Memphis Grizzlies will gain notice when the Grizzlies are making a playoff push in late March.
