        "text": "Artist Info\n\nSamuel Frederick Brocas\n\nBest noted for his drawings of views of Dublin, Samuel Frederick Brocas was the son of Henry Brocas senior (1762 – 1837), a Dublin-based landscape watercolourist, engraver and illustrator who became Master of Landscape and Ornament at the Royal Dublin Society art school. Samuel's three other brothers, James, William and Henry also became artists.\n\nWhile he almost certainly received basic tuition from his father, on drawing and painting, Samuel obtained his main art instruction at the Dublin Society's School, where he won a medal for flower-painting (1801), etching (1802) and figure drawing (1807). Thereafter, he started practising in Dublin as a landscape artist, working in both oils and watercolours. He exhibited in Dublin in 1804, 1809 and 1812. Between the years 1828 and 1847, he also contributed numerous outdoor views to the RHA exhibitions. In his final years, he became a member of the Society of Irish Artists and showed at their first exhibition in 1845. His main work - a set of twelve views of Dublin - involved close collaboration with his youngest brother Henry. Samuel did the drawing, while Henry did the engraving.\n\nIn addition to his Dublin pictures, Samuel Brocas also excelled at animal art, rural scenes and commercial illustrations for magazines, periodicals and publishers of the time. The two Dublin views in watercolour by Samuel Brocas in the collection are: View of Dublin from near the Four Courts, 1818 (NGI.2440), and a View of Trinity College and College Green, 1818 (NGI.2558). The NGI also holds a total of 14 Dublin views after Samuel Brocas, engraved by his brother Henry. Other art museums that hold works by Samuel Brocas include the Victoria and Albert, and the British Museum."
