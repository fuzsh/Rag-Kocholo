        "meta_description": "Fur trader and translator George Bonga was one of the first Black people born in what later became the state of Minnesota. His mother was Ojibwe, as were both of his wives. Through these relationships, Bonga was part of the mixed racial and cultural groups that connected trading companies and Native Americans. He frequently guided white travelers and traders through the region. Comfortable in many worlds, Bonga often worked as an advocate for the Ojibwe in their dealings with trading companies and the United States government.",

Northstar: George Bonga.\n\nhttp://www.tpt.org/northstar/MakingChange.html?quick_link=george_bonga#\n\nIt appears that Geo. Bonga and his brother Stephen and perhaps other family members were attached to Protestant missions in Ojibwe country. George was associated with ABCFM missions and Stephen was translator for Alfred Brunson when he worked up the Methodist missions in the late 1830s. The Bongas attended Mackinaw Mission before it folded in 1836. I believe that George Bonga conducted an ethical practice but I cannot validate my hunch. The family was strongly associated with mixed-blood Ojibwe politics and entrepreneurial activities and did not seem to have a strong connection to \"African-American\" institutions of the time, despite what you may read on M.L. King day in the funny papers. It appears that he was treated as a colleague by others in fur trade management but he does not seem to ever have achieved the status of \"factor\" or head of business but was middle management, working up transportation, storage, workers, and record-keeping for whatever annually assigned sub-region of the \"Fond du Lac\" trading region he was to supervise.\n\nIt is not true that George Bonga went into lodge keeping as his major occupation after 1842. The old Am Fur Company was not entirely dead yet, just morphed into new configurations and the old workers were hired by new entrepreneurs. The big change was the loss of the old Lake Superior supply route, once the LaPointe warehouse was closed in late 1840s. After that time, goods were commonly brought to Minnesota Territory's Ojibwe up the Mississippi through St. Paul to the Crow Wing area for distribution.\n\nGeorge Bonga worked for Henry Rice in the \"fur trade\" and then the \"Indian trade\" for many years roughly 1846 to at least 1853 and perhaps as late as the Civil War as a sub-contractor in northern Minnesota, in competition with some old former AFCo Ojibwe traders (perhaps the Aitkins who were rumored to be running liquor at that time). I assume he was working as an independent contractor in the post-Civil War period. I think he worked for Joel Bassett but am not yet sure of this. He is listed in the 1870 census as a \"dry goods merchant\" in Cass County and probably died 30 Nov 1874 at Leech Lake. [Chronology above is probably in error as to death date.]\n\nAfter the pre-treaty fur trade collapsed with the advent of annuity payments and the severe drop in demand for fur, many former fur traders became Indian traders who provided goods not only to the villages for cash but also to the U.S. Government which in turn distributed them at annuity payment time. Fur trading continued, but the business was generally conducted on a credit & money basis, not on a credit & furs basis as it once had been.\n\n_______________\n\nThe \"white man\" who was murdered in late fall 1836 was Alfred Aitkin, mixed-blood son of AFCo Ojibwe trader Wm. A. Aitken who had a long history in Ojibwe country and who was the principal supplier of goods in northern Minnesota in the 1830s from the St. Louis River to the Canadian border and the Red River and south to Sandy Lake on the Mississippi. Aitkin organized a \"posse\" to capture the murderer. The failure of the legal system to punish the killer became a major theme affecting Indian-white relationships in Ojibwe country and perhaps beyond. Mixed bloods felt betrayed and began to be more aggressive in working for rights through treaty provisions, esp. land grants.\n\nThe murder was considered to be the result of either a love triangle or a misguided lover seeking revenge for being spurned. The crime was intentional."
