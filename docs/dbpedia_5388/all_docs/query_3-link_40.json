        "text": "We recommend that you bring several forms of ID to ensure that DCVRD employees are able to verify your identity.\n\nFor a printable version of the below requirements, please review our Identity Guidelines Information Sheet.\n\nDuring your visit, you will be required to complete an identity verification questionnaire at our self- service kiosks. (Read more under “How do the on-site kiosks work?”)\n\nIf the kiosk is able to authenticate your identity, you will be required to present at least ONE of the following forms of primary photo ID (which must be original, valid, unexpired, and undamaged.):\n\nState-issued driver’s license or non-driver’s ID card\n\nPassport or passport card\n\nPermanent resident card\n\nEmployment authorization card\n\nDepartment of State card\n\nMilitary ID Card\n\nLaw enforcement ID (must also present DC Superior Court subpoena)\n\nGovernment employee ID (applies only to licensed social workers or government representatives with pre-existing approval from the State Registrar)\n\nIf the name on your identification does NOT match the name on the certificate, you must prove evidence of a legal name change, like an original marriage certificate or an original sealed legal name change order.\n\nIf the kiosk is able to authenticate your identity but you do not have a primary photo ID, you will be required to present TWO FORMS of alternate identification from the list below (which must show your full name, current address and/or signature where appropriate):\n\nValid, unexpired employment ID card (with photo) WITH a pay stub (dated within last 60 days)\n\nExpired (within last 5 years) state-issued driver’s license, non-driver’s ID card or passport\n\nPhoto ID from a school in a U.S. state or territory (within last 3 years) WITH a report card, transcript or other proof of school enrollment (within last 3 years)\n\nDepartment of Corrections or Federal Bureau of Prisons photo ID or probation/discharge papers with photo\n\nSocial Security card\n\nVehicle registration/title\n\nU.S. Selective Service card\n\nVoter’s registration card\n\nFederal Census records\n\nCourt documents\n\nPay stub (within last 30 days)\n\nUtility bill (dated within last 60 days)\n\nValid DC ONE card\n\nW2 or federal tax return from the previous year\n\nDD214 military discharge/separation document\n\nLegible printed copy of primary/secondary photo ID\n\nIf the kiosk is unable to authenticate your identity, you will be required to present any combination of THREE (3) forms of identification from Primary list above and the additional list below. At least ONE (1) of the THREE (3) forms must be from the Primary list above and all identification must show full name, current address, and/or signature where appropriate.\n\nSocial Security card\n\nVehicle registration/title\n\nUtility bill (dated within the last 60 days)\n\nSealed court documents\n\nW2 or filed US tax return from the previous year\n\nDepartment of Corrections or Federal Bureau of Prisons photo ID or probation/discharge papers with photo\n\nWhen you order certificates in person at the DCVRD office, you’ll use kiosks (computers with touch screens) to place the order\n\nYou’ll choose English or Spanish (or ask staff for assistance if you need another language) and select the certificate you want to purchase.\n\nThen you’ll choose your relationship to the person on the certificate, check if you’re entitled to order that birth, death, or domestic partnership certificate and show proof of this relationship. You’ll answer questions about the certificate holder, like full name, gender, parents’ names, date of birth or death.\n\nThe kiosk will ask four to five questions about your identity. Then to further prove your identity, you’ll need to show the required ID as detailed above. If you don’t answer enough of the kiosk questions correctly, you’ll have to present additional ID as detailed above.\n\nFinally, make your payment by credit or debit card, check, cash, money order or voucher payment. Be sure to keep your kiosk receipt. When your number is called, you’ll need to bring it, your ID and any other supporting documents up to the counter to pick up your certificate.\n\nIn most cases, yes; however some requests may require a search into DCVRD archives, which are stored off site.\n\nWhile most of archived records (pre-2009 birth and pre-2005 death) have been digitized, some originals must be ordered from DC Archives or the Federal Records Center. These requests typically take two to three weeks after you clear identity and entitlement verification and pay the associated certificate fee.\n\nA record cannot be identified as available prior to purchase because under District of Columbia statute (D. C. Code § 7-231.27(a)(2)), the fee associated with a certificate is for the DCVRD office to search the records to determine if a record is on file. This non-refundable fee includes one copy of the certificate if the record is found. If the record is not found, you will be issued a Certificate of Search.\n\nPlease review our return of fees policy. This information will be helpful should you notice an error on your certificate and wish to immediately amend it.\n\nYou can complete a survey to provide your feedback. Please follow the link below that applies to your experience.\n\nDC Vital Records Division Survey – Walk-up Customers\n\nDC Vital Records Division Survey – Remote Order Customers ( Coming Soon )\n\nYou can provide feedback regarding the service you received from the DCVRD or a data provider (a medical facility, physician or funeral services provider) by clicking here for an Ask the Director form.\n\nTo file a complaint with a licensing board regarding the service you received, contact the applicable board via the websites below.\n\nDC Licensed Data Provider Type(s) of Vital Records Services Provided Licensing Board Contact Information Medical Facility Reports birth, death, and fetal death data to DC Health using an electronic system.
