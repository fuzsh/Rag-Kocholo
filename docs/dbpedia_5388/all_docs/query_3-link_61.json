        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Maryland State Archives is the central repository for state government records of permanent value. The Archives operates with a broad legal mandate to acquire and care for both public and private records relating to the history of Maryland from initial settlement in 1634 to the present.\n\nThe Guide to Government Records is the finding aid created to assist users in their search for particular records. The guide describes record series that have been created by state, county, and municipal agencies. Each record series has a unique identification number. State records are identified by the prefix S, county records by the prefix C, municipal records by the prefix M, and transfer records (see below) by the prefix T.\n\nRecords can be grouped and sorted in three ways: by series, by agency, and by record type.\n\nPlease see the introduction tab for tips on making your search as resourceful as possible.\n\nOnce you have selected a display type, you can refine your search using filter criteria. For example, you can select a specific category, choose a record series such as land records, specify paper or microfilm or electronic records only, or choose all the records of a particular agency. Filter criteria can be combined to refine your search.\n\nView our Inclusivity in Cataloging Statement\n\nChoose Your Display Type"
