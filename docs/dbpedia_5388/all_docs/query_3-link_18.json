        "text": "I don’t believe that there was or is a town with that name. The closest I could find is Wonsosch (in kreis: Schubin, Posen). Nowadays it is located in Poland and called Wąsosz (in province: Kujawsko-Pomorskie).\n\nDo you have any links to online documents for your gf-il that contain the name of this town?\n\nrmirandaw\n\nThank you for posting your request on History Hub!\n\nWe searched the JewishGen Communities Database and located another potential match:\n\nHowever, we can not be certain if this is the correct one. The multiple languages in use in this region at that time, the paucity of standardized spelling, and the fact that many American officials were unfamiliar with the relevant spelling conventions can lead to a great variety of spellings in the records.\n\nIn regards to the differing country of origin on his American paperwork, that may be attributed to the frequently shifting borders of Eastern Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries. As you may already know, in 1874 what is now known as Poland was split between Russia and Germany.\n\nWe hope this is helpful. Best of luck with your family research!\n\nWith the info on the naturalization doco, I found the following departure of the Wieland from Hamburg on 21 May 1893 with a possible 20 year old Felix: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3Q9M-CSG9-V9SN-F?i=570 (#485)\n\nThe Wieland arrives in New York on 3 Jun 1893 - https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-G1D7-9Q98?i=530 (#547, another spelling variant).\n\nIn his naturalization papers Felix mentioned that he’d traveled from Russia via Bremen, but this specific voyage of the Wieland only had Hamburg and Havre as ports of embarkation. Of course he could have traveled to Hamburg from Bremen. If this is the right guy, then his last residence would have been in Plock.\n\nBTW I would have liked to have had a look at the family in the 1900 census, but it won’t show itself (The 1910-1950 census years are not an issue). Have you had better luck, or is there a possibility that the family might have visited the “old country” around 1900? At the moment the first US event that I have been able to find online is son Joseph’s death in 1908 (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:S3HT-DHPK-RM?i=140), so there is a bit of a gap between 1893 and 1908 regarding documentation.\n\nHi Sylvia. I apologize for not responding sooner. I am a college student, and also have an elderly mother-in-law with Alzheimer’s Disease. Sadly, we just can’t manage her care at home anymore and had to move her into an assisted living facility. It’s been challenging trying to help her adjust. This week, she developed a blood clot in her lower leg and has to have a procedure done to protect her heart. Needless to say, I haven’t had much time to myself for much of anything. I really do appreciate the work you've done to help me. I should be able to get back to it in the next few days. I thank you for your patience as well.\n\nrw\n\nHi Sylvia. I'm sorry, I thought I had replied to your question earlier today. Anyway, I have been up to my eyeballs with family issues and haven't had an opportunity to look closely at any of this. I do appreciate your efforts-and your patience-on my behalf and hope to have time soon to study what's been given. If you have more info, that would be great. This does appear to be my husband's great grandfather, but as I said, I am just now able to take a close look. Thank you so much.\n\nrw\n\n@rw\n\n#1 Ah yes, the mystery of the (temporary) disappearance of your own replies… Apparently this is just one of the various new “features” of this recently upgraded website that make my life a little harder. I’m still hoping for a rollback to the previous version … :-)\n\n#2 I understand that life can interrupt less important stuff. Unfortunately too many people on this website seem to disappear after their initial question. I can live with this when I’ve only spent a short amount of time on putting a reply together. However, in your case I’d had a rather big play with Felix’ background. The result needs to be thoroughly checked by someone who can actually read Russian and Polish, but I think that it will answer your original question: “Is the town of Wonszas the same as Warsaw?”. Presently I am quite convinced that this is NOT the case.\n\nReturning to that “probable” immigration, remember that it mentioned that Felix’ last Polish residence had been in Plock. So I decided to search within its voivodeship (“province”) and found a family from a small village called Wąsosze!\n\nFYI For its location enter the following coordinates in Google: 53.173, 20.52.\n\nSome brief info can be found in wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C4%85sosze,_M%C5%82awa_County .\n\nAnd this is that family:\n\nPiotr Portzuski b 1853 -\n\nAkta stanu cywilnego Parafii Rzymskokatolickiej w Kuczborku, 1853 birth certificate: https://www.szukajwarchiwach.gov.pl/skan/-/skan/9f3800b51b5cdc8efbccf4870a4d1ddb4afd1da907e0b02b420da3779562af5e\n\n(s of Hipolit & Ewa Edelman, FYI their 1843 marriage in the Roman Catholic parish in Kuczbork:\n\nhttps://www.szukajwarchiwach.gov.pl/en/skan/-/skan/57322a9182675de512cdf04e139d16e4b83a31bdd6dbb3d164ad2c1b59aa1af1 (#7))\n\nX 1873 parish Szreńsk (Mława, Mazowieckie)\n\nAkta stanu cywilnego parafii rzymskokatolickiej Szreńsk powiat mławski, 1873 marriage:\n\nhttps://metryki.genealodzy.pl/index.php?op=pg&ar=13&zs=0616d&se=&sy=1873&kt=2&plik=020-021.jpg (#21)\n\nOr: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3Q9M-CSVC-KC35?i=676\n\nApolonia Scholastyka Rościszewska b 13 Feb 1852 Ługi (parish Szreńsk, Mława, Mazowieckie)\n\nAkta stanu cywilnego parafii rzymskokatolickiej Szreńsk powiat mławski, 1852 BC:\n\nhttps://metryki.genealodzy.pl/index.php?op=pg&ar=13&zs=0616d&se=&sy=1852&kt=1&plik=028-033.jpg (#28)\n\n(d of Teofil & Józefa Zembrzuska)\n\nChildren (there could be more):\n\nFeliks Potrzuski b 13 Jan 1874 Wąsosze (parish Wieczfnia Kościelna, Mława, Mazowieckie) –\n\nAkta Stanu Cywilnego Wieczfnia Kościelna, 1874 birth certificate:\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-L9GF-Y1CH?i=6 (#7)\n\nStanisław Potrzuski b 24 Dec 1875 Wąsosze X1907 to Stanisława Sokalska\n\n1875 BC: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-99GF-Y5H2?i=74 (#144)\n\nKonstancja Potrzuska b 12 Jul 1878 Wąsosze\n\n1878 BC: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-L9GF-YYBB?i=48 (#92)\n\nJan Potrzuski b 24 Jun 1880 Wąsosze, d 23 Sep 1880 Wąsosze\n\n1880 BC: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-99GF-YYSN?i=48 (#92)\n\nFranciszek Potrzuski b 7 Oct 1881 Wąsosze\n\n1881 BC: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-L9GF-YBGD?i=73 (#142)\n\nLeon Potrzuski b 20 Mar 1887 Wąsosze X1924 to Czesława Kwiatkowska\n\n1887 BC: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QSQ-G9GF-YNF6?i=29 (#53)\n\nVarious documents handed in for his 1924 Marriage: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3Q9M-CSS2-Z911-7?i=185\n\nPossible 1908 passenger list to Baltimore: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-89SD-HZCS?i=362 (#25)\n\nPelagia Potrzuska 20 Oct 1889 Wąsosze\n\n1889 BC: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-99P3-ZJQV?i=76 (#148)\n\nWanda Potrzuska b 8 Oct 1892 Wąsosze, d 29 Mar 1893 Wąsosze\n\n1892 BC: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-L9P3-8B5?i=77 (#134)\n\nWładysław Potrzuski b 16 Apr 1895 Wąsosze\n\n1895 BC: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-99P3-832D?i=41 (#78)\n\nEnjoy, Sylvia"
