        "text": "About\n\nTake your seat at the legendary Jungle Inn nightclub for an electrifying musical telling the story of jazz through its self-proclaimed inventor: Jelly Roll Morton. Returning to the New York stage for just two weeks, Jelly’s Last Jam features Nicholas Christopher (Sweeney Todd) as Jelly, John Clay III (Choir Boy) as Jack the Bear, Alaman Diadhiou as Young Jelly, Joaquina Kalukango (Paradise Square) as Anita, Tiffany Mann (Be More Chill) as Miss Mamie, Okierete Onaodowan (Hamilton) as Buddy Bolden, Billy Porter (Pose) as Chimney Man, Leslie Uggams (American Fiction) as Gran Mimi, as well as original Broadway cast members Mamie Duncan-Gibbs, Stephanie Pope Lofgren, and Allison M. Williams who reprise their roles as the Hunnies.\n\nEncores! Jelly’s Last Jam is led by visionary director Robert O’Hara (X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X) with Tap Choreography by tap icon Dormeshia, Choreography by Edgar Godineaux, and Guest Music Director Jason Michael Webb (MJ, Choir Boy) leading the iconic Encores! Orchestra, who perform onstage in this engagement.\n\nWritten by Tony-winner George C. Wolfe (Rustin, Shuffle Along), the original 1992 Broadway production secured eight Tony nominations, three wins, and a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book. Crafting showstopping numbers and piercing ballads alike from Morton’s own music, lyricist Susan Birkenhead (BOOP!) and composer Luther Henderson create a uniquely compelling musical backdrop for a show that brilliantly utilizes two of this country’s most potent forms of storytelling—jazz and musical theater.\n\nCasting and programming subject to change.\n\nThis production includes explicit racial and sexual language and simulated violence. Not recommended for audiences under age 13."
