        "text": "Fredrick Paul Nelson was born April 28, 1941 in Lewistown MT to William & Edith Nelson. Fred attended schools in Sanford MT and later attended Northern Mt College in Havre MT.\n\nFred and Carol were married in 1967. They spent several years teaching in various small MT communities, settling south of Chinook.\n\nFred acquired a teaching position at KG Schools retiring in 2004. Not being one to stand idle, he became the computer tech for the KG Schools. He enjoyed the job immensely as computers were his passion.\n\nIn 2003 Fred and Carol moved to a small place south of Gildford. He took great pride improving the place and making it look nice. His pride and joy was his shop where he spent countless hours fixing, repairing and puttering.\n\nFred Nelson passed away suddenly at home, December 17, 2023.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Carol; sisters, Ginny, Alice, and Betty; and brother, John."
