        "text": "Laws and regulations governing the creation and requirement of marriage records were enacted by the Territorial, and later State, government. In the early years of the Territory, these laws and regulations were few and far between. It was not until 1866, that a record of licenses or witnesses was required or that the content of marriage certificates was regulated. Washington State marriage laws have been amended many times since then.\n\nSome laws have changed over time or have been repealed due to cultural changes. For example, interracial marriage was illegal in Washington Territory from 1854 until 1868. The legal age for marriage has also changed over time. Originally, persons born female had to be 16 years old and persons born male had to be 21 years old (or 12 and 16 with parental consent). Currently, both parties must be 18 years old (or 17 with parental consent).\n\nOriginally, there was no requirement for information to be included on the certificates. Since 1866, required information has been the names of the couple prior to marriage, residences of the couple, date of the marriage, place of marriage, name of the officiator, names of two witnesses and the license issue date and location.\n\nCertificates from 1952-2002 also include the places of birth of the couple. Certificates from 1952-1999 include the ages of the couple and certificates from 1999-2002 include the dates of birth of the couple.\n\nIn 2002, the county-level certificate form was discontinued, and King County began recording marriage certificates using the state-level form. The Washington State marriage certificates contain different information than the King County marriage certificates. State Law (RCW 70.58.055) requires that marriage certificates filed with the state contain the same information that appears on the U.S. Standard Certificate of Marriage. For a complete list of information that appears on Washington State marriage certificates (1968-present), please see Table 6 of WAC 246-491-149.\n\nAfter the officiator returned the certificates to the county, they were recorded by the appropriate county agency at the time [Probate Court (1852-1891); County Clerk (1891-1947); County Auditor (1947-1969); and Recorder's Office (1969-present)]. Originally, this was done by transcribing them into ledger volumes known as the Record of Marriage Certificates. For some of the earliest marriages, these ledger volumes are the only record of marriage that still exists.\n\nSince the ledgers contain transcriptions of the certificates, the information in them is usually the same as it was on the original form. Because of differences in legibility, it may be useful to consult both the original certificate (if it still exists) and the volume. The Record of Marriage Certificates volumes date from 1853 to 1923.\n\nKing County Archives holds volumes from 1853 to 1888. Puget Sound Regional Archives holds volumes from 1888 to 1923. After 1923, certificates were bound in volumes rather than transcribed.\n\nMarriage certificates are organized roughly by the date they were returned to King County. Until 1927, certificates were required to be returned within 3 months of the marriage. Since 1927, certificates have been required to be returned within 30 days of the ceremony. Many certificates were still returned and filed well beyond the time limit required by law. There are isolated cases of officiators waiting as long as 14 years to return certificates after marriages were officiated.\n\nVarious indexes and registers exist that help users determine dates of marriage and how to locate marriage certificates.\n\nOnline Index, 1855-1989\n\nWashington State Digital Archives online platform. This index links each entry downloadable digital images of the certificates. You may also order certified copies on this site.\n\nOnline Index, 1979-present\n\nKing County Recorder’s Office portal Landmark. This index contains the names of the couple, the date of the marriage and the certificate number (last 6 digits of the instrument number). Entries are sporadic between 1979 and 1982, and the index excludes 1985 and 1986.\n\nIndex of All Marriage Records, 1853-1900\n\nTranscribed and available as a pdf. This is the most complete index for marriages through 1900 because it lists all types of King County marriage records that were filed between 1853 and 1900: certificates, transcriptions, returns, license affidavits / applications, and licenses. It also includes a record of marriages that were never recorded, and thus never previously indexed.\n\nThe index contains information about 10,507 marriages performed in King County between 1853 to 1900. Entries contain the name of the bride, the name of the groom, and the date of the marriage. For entries from 1891-1900, maiden names of brides (when different than at time of marriage) are also included in the notes field. Additional columns list what types of records exist for each marriage.\n\nYou can download a copy of the index that’s organized alphabetically by the name of the groom. You download a separate copy that’s organized alphabetically by the name of the bride.\n\nPhysical Indexes, 1853-1990\n\nKing County Archives holds the original marriage certificate indexes dated from 1853 to 1983 and microfilmed copies from 1853 to 1990.\n\nEntries from 1853 to 1894 include the name of one party.\n\nEntries since 1894 include the names of both parties.\n\nEntries from 1853 to 1922 also include the certificate number and the recorded volume and page number.\n\nEntries from 1923 to 1947 include date of marriage and individual who officiated the marriage.\n\nEntries since 1947 also include the date of license issuance and omit the recorded volume and page number or the officiator's name.\n\nThese records may be searched semi-alphabetically by volume (which usually includes a span of a few years).\n\nIndex of State-level Certificates, 1968-2004\n\nAvailable on microfiche at the Washington State Library at Tumwater. Contact the Library for assistance accessing these records. Searching this index might be most helpful if you are unsure of the county where the license was issued.\n\nCopies of these indexes are also available at the Seattle Public Library Central Branch.\n\nLists of Filed Certificates, 1889-1916\n\nThese lists contain information about marriage certificates that were filed in Probate Court (1889-1891) or with the County Clerk (1891-1916) during the given time periods (one month from 1889 to 1913 and one day from 1914 to 1916). King County Archives holds the original lists.\n\nLists from 1889-1890 contain the names of the couple and the license issuance date.\n\nLists from 1891-1896 were not retained.\n\nLists from 1908-1913 contain the names of the couple and the license number.\n\nLists from 1914-1916 only include one surname associated with the marriage and the license number.\n\nCertificate lists don't include unique information that cannot be found in other marriage records, but they can be useful for researching marriages with missing documentation. These lists were usually typed, so they may provide a more legible reading of each party's name compared to other handwritten documentation. Lists dated from 1897 to 1901 also include correspondence and receipts from other Washington counties in situations where a couple used a King County license to marry in another county or when they used a different county's license to marry in King County.\n\nIn 1866, the Legislative Assembly of Washington Territory passed the Act to Regulate Marriages. This is the earliest year that any records related to marriage licensing exist in King County. Although there were legal marriage requirements prior to this year, there were no official forms or recordkeeping to document that the laws were upheld. These records were kept by the County Auditor from 1866 to 1969 and by the Recorder's Office since 1969.\n\nOriginally, applying for a license consisted of submitting a witness affidavit. This form was signed by a credible person other than the parties seeking the license, swearing that there were no legal impediments to the marriage. If either of the parties were under legal age, the parent or guardian also signed an affidavit giving consent for the marriage. The couple then took the form(s), known as Marriage License Affidavits, to the Auditor to apply for the license. The Auditor kept and filed the forms, and they recorded the affidavits by transcribing them in the Marriage License Register.\n\nSometime between 1880 and 1895, the witness affidavit was standardized and replaced with the Marriage License Application. The longstanding presumption was that these records did not have enduring historical value, and license applications filed between 1896 and 1988 were legally destroyed. King County Archives challenged this practice, and marriage license applications filed from 1989 and going forward are designated as archival documents.\n\nBasic information gathered from applications dated from 1896 to 1917 is available in the Marriage License Register. Information from applications dated from 1983 to 1988 is indexed and available on the Washington State Digital Archives platform.\n\nOriginally, no official limit regulated the time between license application and license issuance. Since 1939, marriage licenses have been issued no earlier than three days after the license application has been filed. This three-day waiting period was put in place to give couples time to reconsider a hasty marriage.\n\nMarriage License Affidavits, 1866-1894\n\nOriginally, two types of affidavits that were submitted in application for a license: the witness affidavit and the consent affidavit. The witness affidavit was required for all marriages and included the names of the couple, the date of the affidavit, and the signature of a credible witness acquainted with the couple. The consent affidavit was only required in situations where either party was under age, and it was signed by the parent or guardian giving consent to the marriage. Witness affidavits exist from 1866 to 1879 and correspond to nearly all recorded marriages for those years. Parental consent affidavits exist from 1866 to 1894.\n\nKing County Archives holds the original forms and maintains a searchable name index of affidavits that did not result in marriages in King County. Transcriptions of the forms and a corresponding index are also duplicated in the Marriage License Register.\n\nMarriage License Applications, 1895\n\nThese records date from June 1895 to December 1895. They include the name, age and residence of each party, as well as the name of a credible witness acquainted with them and the date of the application.\n\nKing County Archives holds the forms and a maintains a searchable name index of applications that resulted in marriages in King County.\n\nMarriage License Applications, 1989-present\n\nThese applications include the name, age, signature, birthplace, mailing address, and marital status of each party. They also include the signature and seal of a notary public. The signature of the parent or guardian is included in situations where either party is under legal age. These records are indexed on the King County Recorder's Office online portal Landmark.\n\nThe King County Archives holds original license applications filed between 1989 and 2013. The King County Recorder's Office holds applications from 2014-present, and you can order copies through their online portal Landmark."
