        "text": "On October 8, 1871, a fire broke out in a barn on the southwest side of Chicago, Illinois. For more than 24 hours, the fire burned through the heart of Chicago, killing 300 people and leaving one-third of the city's population homeless.\n\nThe \"Great Rebuilding\" was the effort to construct a new, urban center. Big businesses, innovative buildings, and a new style of architecture were the results.\n\nThe Great Chicago Fire started on the evening of Oct. 8, 1871. While there is little doubt that the fire started in a barn owned by Patrick and Catherine O'Leary, the exact cause of the fire remains a mystery. From the barn at 137 DeKoven Street, on the city's southwest side, the fire spread north and east, into the heart of Chicago's business district.\n\nRain put out the fire more than a day later, but by then it had burned an area 4 miles long and 1 mile wide. The fire destroyed 17,500 buildings and 73 miles of street. Ninety thousand peopleâone in three Chicago residentsâwere left homeless by the fire. While only 120 bodies were recovered, it is believed that 300 people died in the blaze.\n\nChicago's summer and fall in 1871 were unusually dry, with only one-fourth the normal amount of rain falling between July and October. Many of the city's wooden buildings and sidewalks had dried out in the summer's intense heat.\n\nOn the first night of the fire, strong southwesterly winds fanned the flames high into the sky and created convection spirals, or \"fire devils.\" Fire devils spit burning debris in all directions, causing more buildings to burn.\n\nBuildings often had a single layer of fireproof material on the outside, hiding the wooden structure beneath. The Waterworks, on Pine Street, was just such a building. Its wooden roofing shingles had been replaced with slate, but the structure itself was pine . When a burning ember struck the roof in the first hours of the fire, the Waterworks was quickly destroyed. It was the main source of water for the city's understaffed fire department.\n\nOn the first Sunday after the fire, the Rev. Robert Collyer spoke to his Unitarian congregation outside the ruins of Unity Church on Dearborn Street. \"We have not lost, first, our geography. Nature called the lakes, the forests, the prairies together in convention long before we were born, and they decided that on this spot a great city would be built.\" Unity Church was rebuilt the following year.\n\nThe fire destroyed the cityâs business district , but it left the stockyards and the new packing plants on the South Side untouched. Known as the âHog Butcher of the World,â Chicagoâs stockyards processed more meat than anywhere else on Earth.\n\nMost of the wharfs, lumberyards, and mills along the Chicago River survived, as did two-thirds of the grain elevators to the west. The industries surrounding agriculture and trade kept the cityâs finances as stable as possible, and employed thousands of people.\n\nMost railroad tracks were not damaged. This allowed shipments of aid to come pouring in from across the country and around the world. Book donations collected in England became part of Chicago's first free, public library. The Chicago Public Library opened its doors on Jan. 1, 1873. Its original building was a water tank on LaSalle Street that had survived the fire.\n\nIn 1956, the Chicago Fire Academy was built on the site where Mr. and Mrs. O'Leary's barn once stood. The school trains new firefighters to this day."
