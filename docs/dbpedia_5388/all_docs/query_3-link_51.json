        "text": "Deconstructing the 14th Amendment\n\nThe 13th Amendment, ratified in December 1865, made slavery illegal throughout the United States. But it did not address other fundamental questions about the status of newly freed African Americans. Were they citizens? Did they have the same rights as other Americans? To resolve these issues, Congress passed the 14th Amendment, which contained key provisions on the definition of citizenship, the protection of civil rights, and the power of the federal government.\n\nBirthright Citizenship\n\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\n\n— 14th Amendment, Section 1\n\nFrom the nation’s founding, African Americans regarded themselves as citizens. When the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1788, it did not restrict citizenship based on race. However, it only counted enslaved people as 3/5ths of a person, rather than as full citizens, in state populations.\n\nThe 14th Amendment revoked the Black Codes by declaring that states could not pass laws that denied citizens their constitutional rights and freedoms. No person could be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process (fair treatment by the judicial system), and the law was to be equally applied to everyone. This represented a major shift in power between the states and the federal government. For the first time, civil rights were to be protected at the federal level, not left to the states.\n\nRepresentation and Voting Rights\n\nThe 14th Amendment also included provisions relating to voting and representation in Congress. It amended the 3/5ths clause in the Constitution, stating that population counts would be based on the “whole number of persons” in a state—all people would be counted equally. It also protected the right to vote “for all male citizens age 21 or older,” though it would take another amendment to the Constitution (the 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870) to ban voting restrictions based on race. Women would not secure the right to vote until the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.\n\nReconstruction and the 14th Amendment\n\nCongress passed the 14th Amendment on June 13, 1866, and sent it to the states to be ratified. But changing the Constitution to fulfill the promise of equality for African Americans would not be an easy process. Slavery, which defined Black people as property, not as citizens, had shaped the United States since its founding. In order for the 14th Amendment to become the new law of the land, it would need more than a ratification—it would need Reconstruction.\n\nWhite Resistance\n\nTwenty-two states ratified the 14th Amendment within a year after it was passed, out of a total of 28 needed to make the amendment part of the U.S. Constitution. But most southern states, led by the same white men who had passed the Black Codes, refused to ratify an amendment that defined African Americans as equal citizens. Black men and women who attempted to exercise their rights and freedoms faced resistance, violence, and retaliation from their fellow white citizens.\n\nOn May 1, 1866, mobs of white civilians and police attacked the Black community in Memphis, Tennessee. The first major outbreak of racial violence after the Civil War, the Memphis Massacre lasted three days and resulted in the deaths of 46 African Americans. National outrage over the incident helped fuel support for passage of the 14th Amendment.\n\nBy 1875, when the Civil Rights Act was passed, the 14th Amendment was already under attack. Over the next two decades, the 14th Amendment’s power to protect the constitutional rights of African Americans would be undermined by legal challenges that reestablished the primacy of states’ rights, allowed racial segregation, and relegated Black people to second-class citizenship.\n\nLimiting the 14th Amendment: Segregation and Unequal Protection\n\nWhite supremacists opposed to Black equality and citizenship used violence, terror, and voter suppression to retake control of southern state governments. Efforts to combat southern racial violence lost momentum within the federal government and finally resulted in the withdrawal of federal troop protection of African Americans living in the South. Supreme Court rulings restricting and overturning 14th Amendment civil rights protections reinforced Southern efforts to restrict the rights of African Americans. Racial discrimination and segregation consequently characterized the day-to-day lives of African Americans.\n\nColfax Massacre and Cruikshank Decision\n\nOn April 13, 1873, white Democrats in Louisiana angry about their defeat in the election attacked Black Republicans gathered for a meeting at the Colfax Parish Courthouse in Louisiana. Approximately 150 African Americans were killed, forty of whom were executed after they surrendered.\n\nIn March 1876, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. Cruikshank overturned the convictions of the white men who attacked Black citizens in Colfax, Louisiana. The Court ruled that the 14th Amendment only applied to actions taken by the state, not to actions taken by individuals. As a consequence, none of the white attackers were punished for their role in the Colfax Massacre.\n\nAfrican Americans repeatedly challenged the emergence of segregation. They staged protests, brought claims to the courts, and produced publications highlighting and opposing the discrimination and violence they faced. They argued the passage of the 14th Amendment gave them the same civil rights and equal protection as any other citizens.\n\nIda B. Wells\n\nIn 1883, Ida B. Wells was working as a schoolteacher in Memphis, Tennessee, when a white conductor forced her off a train for refusing to move out of the first-class car. Citing her rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1875, Wells sued the railroad company for damages. The Circuit Court of Shelby County ruled in Wells’s favor, stating that she was “refused the first-class accommodations to which she was entitled under the law”; however, the Supreme Court of Tennessee later reversed the decision on appeal. Wells went on to become a prominent journalist and civil rights activist whose campaign against lynching brought worldwide attention to racial violence and injustice in the Jim Crow South.\n\nBlack Lives Matter\n\nOne hundred and fifty years after the 14th Amendment defined African Americans as equal citizens under the law, the promises of full racial equality remain unfulfilled. Protests over the violent and discriminatory treatment of Black people by the justice system, sparked by the killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and too many others, gave rise to the nation’s largest civil rights movement. In taking on issues of racial profiling and police brutality, Black Lives Matter activists have compelled Americans to reckon with legacies of white supremacy, violence, and social injustice that have persisted for generations. They have demanded answers to questions that are at the heart of the 14th Amendment: Who is included in “We the People”? Whose rights does the law protect? Whose lives matter?"
