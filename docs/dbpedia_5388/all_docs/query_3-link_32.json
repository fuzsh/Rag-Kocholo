        "text": "Harry Houdini claimed Appleton, Wisconsin as his hometown. He even told people he was born here. Ehrich Weiss, later known as Harry Houdini, was actually born on March 24, 1874, in Budapest, Hungary. He immigrated to the United States with his family in 1878 and settled in Appleton. Houdini’s father, Samual Weiss, served as the rabbi for the Zion Reform Jewish Congregation.\n\nHoudini cherished his childhood memories of the town. “I usually dreamt of Appleton, Wisc.,” he wrote in a letter to his brother. “I ran for a camera, as usual, and knew in my dream that I had none in Appleton, still I searched for it and stopped every once in a while to feast my eyes on our parents so calmly drinking and chatting.” The happy times in Appleton did not last long. Rabbi Weiss lost his job in 1882, and the family moved to Milwaukee.\n\nIt wasn’t until the 1980s that Appleton fully embraced its native son. The city built Houdini Plaza and Houdini Elementary School. Residents celebrated Houdini’s birthday. They watched magicians perform his famous escapes at public events. The Outagamie Museum opened Houdini exhibits, created a Houdini walking tour of downtown, and even founded a Houdini research center.\n\nThe Outagamie Museum, now called the History Museum at the Castle, assembled a large Harry Houdini collection at that time. Today, the Museum holds handcuffs, lockpicks, keys, tools, and a straitjacket used by Houdini. Rare scrapbooks, photographs, posters, and advertisements document his life and career."
