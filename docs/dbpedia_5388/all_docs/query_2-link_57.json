Ms Westra Valley View Shout out to Ms Westra who is one of my Favorite teachers that my son has had at Valley View, though it was her first year of having her own class, i knew from the beginning she was going to be a great teacher, and I wasn't wrong, we've became close by the end of the year. Thank you for giving little angel your kindness and care every day when he was with you, I will forever appreciate you! Nurse Kelly Valley View Nurse Kelly, you're the heart beat of our school at Valley View. Whether it's putting on band-aids, stopping a bloody nose, or holding on to ice packs, our children are safer because of you! Thank you for all that you do for the children health and wellness! Susan Goins Valley View Mrs. Goins has been a part of our son’s life for over 3 years now and there is truly no one like her, we are so thankful for her. She never gives up on him or any of the kids even when most others would’ve, even when there’s been times I’ve almost felt like giving up myself she still shows up day after day full of optimism and kind words for her students and their parents alike. I can’t imagine learning and navigating autism without her guidance and flexibility. We could not do it without her. A big shoutout to the rest of the staff as well as everyone is always so friendly and encouraging of him, we love his school! Victoria Boogaard Valley View Mrs. Boogaard is the kindest, most attentive teacher. My little one adores her. She looks forward to seeing her every single day. She's come out of her shell so much because of her comfort level with Mrs. Boogaard. She has been communicative and helpful with anything my husband and I have needed. Truly a fantastic teacher and human being. Westbrook Valley View By far my daughter's favorite teacher. Couldn’t ask for better. I hear nothing but good things DAILY. 💞💞 Ms. Claire Verona Ms. Claire, my daughter and I appreciate you so very much. Thank you for all you do!!!!! Ms. Salina Verona You are amazing and so very appreciated, keep doing what you do!!! Much love. Frederick Jankowski Verona Thank you for making music fun for my child, he loves your class. Jodi Ellenwood Verona Mrs. Ellenwood is by far one of the best educators I have ever been witness to. She has an ability to set expectations with students and hold students to those expectations. She is firm with students and also develops lasting relationships with students that make them want to be in her class and learn. The students in her class want to behave and learn from her because they know she cares about them. Mrs. Ellenwood is who I think about when I think about what ALL teachers at BCPS should look like to be successful. Jodie Ellenwood Verona Thank you for being an amazing teacher. You have made a positive difference in so many lives! We appreciate you! Katie Cape Verona She works hard but, gets a rough deal from the students. Mrs. Ellenwood Verona She always goes above and beyond for her students- all students. She shows them love while teaching the students to push themselves to be better. She always puts herself last. Most importantly she believes in all the kids and try’s to show them their true potential. The love she has and shares with her students is pure! She treats all the students with care and deserves so much more. I’ve seen her teach and she CARES! Thank you Mrs. Ellenwood! Mrs. Parshall Verona Thank you for being a great teacher and working around the students' needs. Natasha Hagar Verona Very caring, understanding, teacher. Natasha Hager Verona Mrs. Hager is a master at giving each student what they need. She has an incredible way of making all her students feel like they are important. Students in her class want to behave well and learn because of the relationship she builds with them. She is open to suggestions when it comes to meeting students individual needs and will try anything if she thinks it will help kids learn more effectively. Mrs. Timeya Gray Verona In my humble opinion, teachers have one of the most important jobs in the world. You educate the leaders of tomorrow. You help them as they navigate and befriend a classroom full of students who are both very different and very similar to them in a variety of ways. You help them make sense of what is sometimes a scary, yet beautiful and loving world. You are likely one of the most important adults in your students’ lives right now. Thank you for educating, loving, supporting, encouraging, challenging, and caring for our children, your students, the leaders of tomorrow. Ms.Begg Verona Even though my student is no longer in her class she still checks up on him. She also helped after school with an essay even though she is not his teacher. She is an amazing teacher. I can't thank her enough for all the support she shows him. Mr Crawford WK Prep I really appreciate how patient he is with my son. No matter how disrespectful or rude my son was to him. He made sure he let him know. Young men don’t act that way and to have some respect for others. Now, they are very close and he goes to Mr. Crawford to get help with his work. They have their own little bond and I appreciate it. He keeps me updated on his progress and let me know what changes have been made. He told my son I’m always here to help you and now he goes to him for everything pertaining schoolwork. He is the best ❤️ Calvin Williams WK Prep Mr Williams has been an outstanding support for ALL students at WK Prep- we would be lost without him. Mr Williams WK Prep Mr Williams runs a tight ship which is needed but he also cares very deeply for his students and their success in school and their future he is a wonderful individual. Mr.Williams WK Prep I like the way that he handles my son and tried to push him to be a better young man. He’s always on top of things. I love that he is always patient and he always follow up with me on everything. My son also likes him and opens up to him a lot. He is the best ❤️all praise to him. Mrs. Young WK Prep Mrs. Young is always on top of it. She lets me know how my son is doing, and if there is anything he needs. I can contact her to relay messages to him, or to ask her anything. Mrs. Young rocks and deserves a day of recognition. Mrs. Young if you see this. We love your help and am happy that my son has you as a teacher. YOU ROCK!!!! Ms Jordan WK Prep She is a caring person and a wonderful role model who really cares for the students Dustin See Thank you for being my son's safe space, for being his champion. I'll never forget the huge hug you gave him at a back to school night, when he ran into your arms and you picked him up. He wasn't always the easiest kid to love, and I appreciate your dedication to learning about his needs."
