Entitled: "Battle of Quingua." Showing battle scene with American troops in the foreground advancing on Filipino troops behind earthworks. The Battle of Quingua was fought on April 23, 1899, in Quingua (now Plaridel, Bulacan, Philippines). The engagement was a two-part battle that started General Elwell S. Otis' Bulacan and Pampanga offensive a day early. The first phase was a brief victory for the young Filipino general Gregorio del Pilar when he stopped the advance of the American Cavalry led by Major J. Franklin Bell. In the second phase of the battle, Bell was reinforced by the 1st Nebraskan Infantry who routed the Filipinos, but not before they repelled a cavalry charge that killed Colonel John M. Stotsenburg. The Philippine-American War (1899-1902) was an armed conflict between the United States and Philippine revolutionaries. The conflict arose from the struggle of the First Philippine Republic to secure independence from the United States following the latter's acquisition of the Philippines from Spain after the Spanish-American War. The war was a continuation of the Philippine struggle for independence that began in 1896 with the Philippine Revolution. Fighting erupted between United States and Philippine revolutionary forces on February 4, 1899, and quickly escalated into the 1899 Second Battle of Manila. On June 2, 1899, the First Philippine Republic officially declared war against the United States. The war officially ended on July 4, 1902. Kurz & Allison chromolithograph, 1899.
