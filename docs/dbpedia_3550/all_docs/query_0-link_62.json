In 1899, the historic Barasoain Church in Malolos City (Bulacan\\\\\\'s capital city) is the birthplace of the First Constitutional Democracy in Asia.\n\nBulacan is also the cradle of the nation\\\\\\'s noble heroes, of great men and women; among them: Marcelo H. del Pilar\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Great Propagandist,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and General Gregorio del Pilar\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Hero of Tirad Pass.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\n\nBulacan is also home to many of the country\\\\\\'s greatest artists, with a good number elevated as National Artists; among them: the legendary poet Francisco \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Baltazar\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Balagtas, the musician Nicanor Abelardo, and the nationalist sculptor Guillermo Tolentino.\n\nToday, Bulacan is among the most progressive provinces in the Philippines. Its peoplethe Bulakeño (or Bulakenyo)are highly educated, enterprising and industrious.\n\nBulacan is well-known for the following industries: Marble and Marbleized Limestone, Jewelry, Pyrotechnics, Leather, Aquaculture, Meat and Meat Products, Garments, Furniture, High-Value Crops, and Sweets and Native Delicacies, and a wide variety of high-quality native products.\n\nDubbed as the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Northern Gateway from Manila,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Bulacan is indeed an ideal investment destination owing largely to the following factors: Strategic Location; Highly Productive Human Resources; Abundant Natural Resources; Well-Developed Infrastructure Support; Reasonable Cost for Doing Business; Effective Government and Private Sector Partnership for Investments; Favorable Peace and Order Situation; and Attractive Investments Incentives.\n\nBulacan has fast become an ideal tourist destination, owing to its vital role in Philippine history, and its rich heritage in culture and the arts. The province is popularly known for its historical sites; nostalgic old houses and churches; idyllic ecological attractions; religious attractions; colorful and enchanting festivals; swimming and various themed attractions; and a wide selection of elegant native crafts and sumptuous delicacies. It is also home to numerous resorts, hotels, restaurants, and other recreational facilities.\n\nThe Province of Bulacan, Philippines offers everything that you can ever hope for. An ideal and peaceful community. A committed government. A haven for business and investments. A perfect vacation getaway.\n\nHow to get there\n\nBy Air\n\nManila, Cebu, Davao, Clark, Subic, and Laoag are the international gateways. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Manila is the premier gateway. It is served by more than 30 airlines which fly to different cities around the world. The Mactan International Airport (MIA) in Cebu handles regular flights from Japan, Singapore and Australia as well as chartered flights from Hong Kong, the United States and other major travel capitals.

In the late 1700s, the dreaded Chinese private Limahong used Lusong Point on the western sides as the landing place to launch his conquest of Luzon. In the Philippine Revolution of 1896, Bataan joined the other provinces in Luzon, which revolted against Spanish rule.It was during World War II, however that Bataan attained prominence that would find its place in the annals of world history.

Another is the Pampanga river, cutting across a rich valley floor, famed for irrigation, the generation of hydroelectric power, and the mitigation of flood damage.\n\nNueva Ecija is also the agri-tourism pilot site in Central Luzon due to the presence of the Central Luzon State University in the province.\n\nIts other worthwhile attractions include the Minalungao National Park, Rizal Hot Spring, Burburayok Springs and Pajanutic Falls, Barrio Puncan in the town of Carranglan, among others.\n\nBrief History\n\nIn 1705, Spanish Governor General Fausto Cruzar created the province and named it Nueva Ecija after his hometown Ecija in Seville, Spain.\n\nIn 1818, Nueva Ecija annexed a long strip of territory facing the Pacific Ocean in the east that extended from Palawan (now in Isabela) in the north to Infanta in Tayabas (now Quezon) in the south. In 1848, it acquired the towns of Gapan, San Isidro, Cabiao. San Antonio and Casiguran were separated from Nueva Ecija and annexed to Tayabas. Palanan was transferred first to Nueva Ecija then to Isabela. With the subsequent separation of Infanta and Polilio Island, Nueva Ecijas isolation from the sea became complete.\n\nNueva Ecija was one of the first eight provinces that took up arms against Spanish rule in 1896. During the Filipino-American War, General Emilio Aguinaldo retreated to the province and, on May 9, 1899, made Cabanatuan the temporary seat of his government until it was moved to Bamban, Tarlac. General Antonio Luna was killed on June 5, 1899 in the convent of the towns church.\n\nAmerican forces, after occupying Nueva Ecija in 1899, established the provincial seat of government in San Isidro. Other provincial capitals had been Baler (now in Aurora), Bongabon, and Cabanatuan. On June 19,1965, Republic Act No. 4475 created the city of Palayan as the new capital.\n\nHow to get there\n\nFrom Manila via NLEX, take Sta.

Pampanga has always enjoyed the title \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Culinary Center of the Philippines\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It is populated by resourceful hardy folk who are justifiably proud of their famous Kapampangan cuisine. The capital, City of San Fernando, is world famous for the annual Lenten re-enactment of the crucifixion of Christ. It is also famous for its Giant Lantern Festival where huge lanterns measuring 20-ft in diameter rise to the occasion to thrill thousands of people with their kaleidoscopic interplay of sounds and colors. The province has remnants of a long and colorful history. It has centuries-old houses, a booming night life center and a myriad of tourist destinations, the site of world-class resorts, casinos, duty-free shopping and golf courses in Clark.\n\nBrief History\n\nPampanga was already the site of thriving settlements along riverbanks or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"pampang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" before the Spaniards came. The inhabitants were referred to as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kapampangans\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the people by the river bank\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Martin de Goiti explored Pampanga and was established in 1571. In 1754, a strip from Dinalupihan to Orion, was ceded to Bataan. In 1848, the province lost five towns to Nueva Ecija and San Miguel to Bulacan. By 1860, its northern district was made into a separate comandancia. This district was made a part of Pangasinan in 1874, and the towns of Mabalacat, Magalang, Porac and Floridablanca were returned to Pampanga. Since the early 20th century, the province has been a hotbed of agrarian troubles, mainly because of its many estates under powerful landlords. During World War II, Pampanga was the base for a guerilla unit known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hukbalahap\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which resisted the Japanese. The huks later formed the nucleus of local communist insurgency after the war, but it was suppressed in the early 1950\\\\\\'s. It resurfaced as the New Peoples Army in the 1960\\\\\\'s. Pampanga was the home province of Diosdado Macapagal, 9th President of the Philippines, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, incumbent and 14th President of the Republic.\n\nHow to get there\n\nFrom Manila it is just a 1 hour ride by car or bus to through the North Luzon Expressway exiting via San Fernando, Angeles or Dau Toll Plaza.\n\nTourist Attractions\n\nHistorical\n\nJuan D.

Arayat\n\nArayat\n\nA dormant volcano with an area of 3, 715.28 hectares. Legend says it is the home of Mariang Sinukwan, a fairy who protects the mountains vegetation and wildlife. At the foot of the mountain is Mt. Arayat National Park, a picnic site with lush foliage, natural waterfalls, two swimming pools, and a countless variety of unique and interesting flora and fauna.\n\nCandaba Swamps\n\nCandaba\n\nA bird sanctuary and a haven for bird watchers, to which thousands of birds migrate from China to flee the winter.\n\nCandaba Swamp is near the towns of Candaba, San Miguel and San Ildefonso, c.50 km north-north-west of Metro Manila, in Pampanga and Bulacan Provinces, central Luzon. It is a complex of freshwater ponds, swamps and marshes with surrounding areas of seasonally flooded grassland, arable land and palm savanna on a vast alluvial flood plain. The entire area is usually flooded in the wet season, but most of it dries out during the dry season (late November to April) and is converted into rice fields and plantations of watermelons. The main area for waterfowl is an impoundment of about 300 ha, with a mixture of open shallow water, small islands, and rafts of floating vegetation, adjacent to the Pampanga River about nine kilometers north of Baliuag. However, this area is now drained earlier in the year than in the past, and it no longer attracts many waterfowl. The isolated Mt Arayat, which rises to 1,023 m and has disturbed lowland forest on its slopes, is adjacent to Candaba Marsh but is not included in the IBA. Most of the flood plain has been converted to privately owned agricultural and residential land except for the core area of approximately 500 ha. The impoundment is used as a fishpond during the rainy season, and then drained in January or February to be used for agriculture. Candaba Swamp acts as a natural flood retention basin holding wet season overflow from the Maasim, San Miguel, Garlang, Bulu and Penaranda Rivers, and draining into the Pampanga River. The swamp was a traditional waterfowl hunting area in the past, and some hunting of ducks and rails, although now illegal, still occurs. It is also a favourite spot for local and visiting bird watchers and naturalists, and possibly has some potential for nature oriented outdoor recreation and conservation education as there are few other places so close to the metropolitan area of Manila that support as much wildlife.\n\nThe Bird Sanctuary of Candaba is a paradise waiting to be discovered hopefully by bird watchers and not by bird hunters. Migratory egrets and indigenous birds like the rare salaksak and batala can be observed especially during dry months when the fishponds turn to rice fields - when large numbers of egrets descend on shallow pools teeming with snails and small fish. The best time to visit the swamp is from October to January when these wintering birds make Candaba their home during harsh temperatures.\n\nReligious\n\nSan Guillermo Parish Church\n\nBacolor, Pampanga\n\nOne of Pampangas oldest churches. It features fascinating works of architecture, such as its classic altar in antique carved design and décor blending with religious frescos reminiscent of neoclassical works of European art.\n\nHoly Rosary Cathedral\n\nAngeles City, Pampanga\n\nLocated at the intersection of Sto. Rosario and Sto. Entierro Streets, the Holy Rosary Church was constructed from 1877 to 1896 by the townspeople of Angeles by forced labor system known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"polos y servicios\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" imposed by the Spanish colonial government. From 1899 to 1900 the church was used by the US Army as a military hospital. In 1896 - 1898, the backyard of the church became the execution grounds to the Spanish forces in shooting down Filipino rebels and suspects. It has a beautiful transient and measures 70m. long, 20m. wide and 12m. high. The dominant element of façade is the symmetry created by recessed arched windows which are in harmony with the segmented ones.\n\nApalit Parochial Church\n\nApalit, Pampanga\n\nLocated at the town plaza, it was built in the year 1629 - 1630 and designed in Baroque architecture. The painting on the ceilings and dome are filled with beautiful paintings and are worth studying. The style of the façade is reminiscent of European neo-classic churches. It was rebuilt by Father Antonio Redondo between the years 1876 - 1880. Its towers were finished in 1896 by the Rev. Toribio Fanjul, who purposely made them low to minimize the effects of earthquakes.\n\nSan Guillermo Parish Church\n\nBacolor, Pampanga\n\nIt is one of the oldest and largest churches in Pampanga. It was constructed by the Augustinian friars in 1576 on the lot of Don Guillermo Manabat, a rich landlord believed to be the founder of Bacolor. The church was restored by Fr. Manuel Diaz in 1897. The church measured 56m. long, 15m. wide and 12m. high. It has a central nave and an ample and well-lighted transept with windows. The main retablo, side retablos and pulpit are gilded with gold leaf. The richness of the decoration of Bacolor is indicative of the advanced stage of its baroque style. In spite of the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo which half-buried the church on Oct. 1, 1995, masses are still held every Sunday morning.\n\nBetis Catholic Church\n\nGuagua, Pampanga\n\nThe jewel in the crown is the Betis Church (Santiago de Galicia Parish), built in the early 1700s and repaired continually throughout the 1800s. The unadorned exterior does not prepare the visitor for what he\\\\\\'s about to witness inside: the main altar (retablo) with ornate carvings and saints peering out of their niches like ancient dolls, and the paintings on the ceiling that attract comparison with the Sistine Chapel. NCCA declared this church a National Treasure, one of only ten churches in the country bestowed that honor. The main attraction is the original ceiling mural done by the famous painter Simon Flores (1839-1904). Not to be missed are the original Simon Flores painting of the Holy Family, the artesian well (dug in\n\nChurch of Magalang\n\nMagalang, Pampanga\n\nSan Bartolome Church - Established by the Augustinians in 1605, it was the scene of the encounter between the followers of Andres Malong led by Melchor de Vera and the Spanish troops in 1660. Moved to San Bartolome in 1734, the church was swept by Parua river in the flood of 1863. It was re-established in Barrio San Pedro on December 13, 1863. The 3-aisle church is made of stone and wood. It is 55m. long, 21m. wide and 7m. high. Interplay of arches, as seen on the main entrance, doors and niches, pediments and fenestrations, including those of the bellowers and adjacent convent suggest a touch of baroque.\n\nMinalin Church\n\nThe Minalin Church (Sta. Monica Parish), located on the town\\\\\\'s highest ground called burul (the town had moved to its present site due to flooding, hence \\\\\\'minalis,\\\\\\' later corrupted to minalin) but despite its elevation, silt from the river has already invaded its beautiful church. The peeled palitada reveals the original red brick walls, giving the church its unique old-rose touches. The ancient mural paintings in the adjoining convent, one of which is a primitive-looking map with details of trees, ducks, crows, a boat, a hunter and a crocodile. A detail not to be missed are the corbels and beams in the convent and high up in the church\\\\\\'s ceiling, with carvings that some say depict pre-Hispanic pagan deities like naga (serpent), dapu (crocodile) and galura (eagle), but Siuala ding Meangubie believes they depict only one creature, bulig (mudfish).\n\nMetropolitan Cathedral of San Fernando\n\n(City of San Fernando)  The present church may have been built by the end of the 18th century, constructed most probably by Fr. Sebastian Moreno, its parish priest in 1756, and was restored in 1808. The church measures 70m. long, 13m. wide and 11m. high. The round majestic dome rising from the rotanda of the transept is reminiscent of the baroque style with some renaissance touch. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of the City of San Fernando, Pampanga. President Emilio F. Aguinaldo and his cabinet viewed the Phillippine Revolutionary Army from the windows of the convento on October 9, 1898. The church and the convento were burned by the Philippine Revolutionary Army on orders of Gen. Antonio Luna on May 4, 1899. It was again destroyed by fire in 1939, and later restored by Architect Fernando H. Ocampo.\n\nPampanga Agricultural College\n\nMagalang, Pampanga\n\nLocated at the foot of Mt. Arayat, this state-owned college is the center for agri-based education in the province.

A mixture of four distinct groups - the Pampangos, Ilocanos, Pangasinenses and Tagalogs - share this province and living together resulted in offering to the visitors the best cuisine of the places where their ancestors had come from, namely Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Zambales, Pangasinan and the Ilocos Region. Tarlac is also best known for its fine foods and vast sugar and rice plantations. That it has fine cooking to offer is largely due to the fact that it is the melting pot of Central Luzon. Its myriad of historical sites, fine foods, vast sugar and rice plantations, and a beautifully landscaped golf course plus so many other attractions all make the province of Tarlac one of the best places to visit in Central Luzon.\n\nBrief History\n\nOriginally, Tarlac was a part of the provinces of Pangasinan and Pampanga. It was the last Central Luzon province to be organized under Spanish regime in 1874. During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, Tarlac was one of the first eight provinces to rise in arms against Spain. It then became a seat of the first Philippine Republic in March 1899 when Emilio Aguinaldo abandoned Malolos, Bulacan, then the capital. It only lasted for a month, though, as the seat was moved to Nueva Ecija in Aguinaldo's attempt to elude the pursuing Americans. On October 23, 1899, Gregorio Aglipay, military vicar general of the Revolutionary Forces, called the Filipino clergy to a conference in Paniqui. There, they drafted the Constitution of the Philippine Independent Church. They called for the Filipinization of the clergy, which eventually led to a schism in the Roman Catholic Chuch in the Philippines. Tarlac was captured by American forces in November 1899. A civil government was established in the province in 1901. During World War II, Camp O' Donnell in Capas became the terminal point of the infamous \\\"Death March\\\", involving Filipino and American soldiers who surrendered in Bataan on April 9, 1942. The Camp was so overcrowded that many allied prisoners who survived the gruelling march died here of hunger and disease. In the early 1950s, Tarlac was the hotbed of the Huks, a local communist movement. It was suppressed later only to resurface again in 1965. Tarlac is the home province of former President Corazon C. Aquino and her husband, Benigno, whose assassination at the Manila International Airport in 1983 started the protest movement against the Marcos dictatorship, which culminated in the EDSA Revolution of 1986.\n\nHow to get there\n\nAll buses from Manila going to the Ilocos region and Baguio pass through Tarlac. Most of these buses make rest stops along the highway at the town's many restaurants. Philippine Rabbit in Manila has buses that leave for Tarlac every 10 to 30 minutes. For fast and convenient travel, take the North Luzon Expressway from Manila; exit NLEX spur road past the Dau Toll Plaza to take the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway all the way to Tarlac City.\n\nTOURIST ATTRACTIONS\n\nCapas National Shrine\n\nCapas, Tarlac\n\nThe shrine was the first prison camp for the men who survived the \\\"Death March\\\" in the hands of the Japanese during the last world war in 1942. The Camp O' Donnell Memorial Monument was built by the organization known as \\\"The Battling Bastards of Bataan\\\" to honor those American men who died at Camp O'Donnell, while prisoners of the Japanese. The Cement Cross is a replica of the original cement cross built by the POWs. The monument is located in the Capas National Shrine, in Capas, Tarlac, Philippines,adjacent to the memorial for the Philippine Army dead. The \\\"Cross\\\" was built as a memorial to the thousands who died in that camp. It is as much a part of Bataan as the participants in that battle. The inscription on the base of the \\\"Cross\\\" reads \\\"Omnia Pro Patria\\\": All For Country. On the wall behind the \\\"Cross\\\" are inscribed the names of the men who died at Camp O'Donnell. The original \\\"Cement Cross\\\" is now on display in the National Prisoner of War Museum, at the Andersonville National Historic Site, Andersonville, GA. It was brought to this country by Bataan survivors.

Domingo Death March Marker\n\nCapas, Tarlac\n\nThe site where about 60,000 Filipino and American prisoners of war cramped like sardines in closed box-cars were loaded to start the second phase of the tragic Death March. There were already more than 30,000 of these defenders of democracy and freedom who perished from the inhuman treatment they were subjected to during the trip from Abucay and Mariveles, Bataan to San Fernando, Pampanga. The survivors started their tortuous journey here to Camp O' Donnel.\n\nBamban Park\n\nBamban, Tarlac\n\nThe park was carved along the hilly area near the national highway in Tarlac and is quite visible from the road with its imposing grotto of Virgin Mary pedestalled on a hill. One has to hurdle a 100-step stairway before reaching the grotto. The area is characterized by stretches of roadside mini-restaurants and bonsai farms - all catering to commuters bound for the north. People visit the place to pay homage to the Blessed Mother or do mountain trekking on the side.\n\nCamp General Servillano Aquino\n\nTarlac City, Tarlac\n\nFormerly called Camp Ord, named after Lt. Col. James Ord, the place is now the home of the 5th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army. The complex was donated on September 30, 1940 by the Campania General Tabacos de Filipinas to the Commonwealth of the Philippines and was accepted on October 11, 1940, in behalf of the donee, Jorge D. Vargas, the then Secretary to the President. Adding to the historical significance of the place is the Eisenhower tree planted on July 4, 1939 by Lt. Col. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Chief of Staff of Marshall Douglas MacArthur, the military adviser of the Philippine Commonwealth.\n\nCentral Azucarera de Tarlac\n\nTarlac City\n\nThe City of Tarlac takes pride in having a large sugar mill called Central Azucarera de Tarlac.

Mariano Un Ocampo III. The DOST then prepared a project proposal entitled \\\"Establishment of a Village-based Essential Oil Extraction Industry\\\" which they presented to then Pres. Corazon C. Aquino.\n\nIn no time, the residents had been planting seedlings in their own backyards and helping care for the trees that the government had planted in public orchards. Initially, 10,000 seedlings were planted along the roads of the entire town. They harvested the first mature blooms five years later. Anao Ylang Ylang Primary Cooperative was organized in 1998 which served as the core gorup in the overall implementation of the ylangylang livelihood program.\n\nTo ensure the sustainability and ownership of the Program, the Sangguniang Bayan enacted several municipal ordinances. Among them are the prohibition and penalizing the indiscriminate cutting of trees along roads and other government-owned areas; the guaranteeing of ownership of ylangylang planted along roads; requiring all applicants of a municipal permit or license or clearance to purchase and plant ylangylang and adopting \\\"Aroma Anao\\\" as the trademark/brand name of the ylangylang products in the municipality, as registered with the Intellectual Property Office.\n\nThe present administration is very diligent in looking for possible marketing strategies for the \\\"Aroma Anao\\\" products and viable agricultural lots for growing ylang-ylang seedlings.

Lubigan, San Jose, Tarlac\n\nIn the early months of 2001 under the leadership of Governor Jose \\\"Aping\\\" Yap, a project was launched to find a place in the province where people and nature can co-exist in harmony with each other. Soon after, a 278-ha forested land that would eventually serve as a sanctuary for environment and nature lovers was established.\n\nLocated at an altitude of 308 meters above sea level, 30 kilometres from Tarlac City, the said place boasts of perfect climatic condition with natural ecosystem for plants, disterocarp trees, convenient habitat for native and migratory birds and wild animals. The place is a perfect place for camping holidays.\n\nOn April 12, 2004, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo issued Proclamation No. 602 officially declaring the Tarlac Ecotourism Park as \\\"Ecotourism Park and campsite.\\\" Vic Yap, in-charge of Special Projects Office, facilitated the construction of concrete roads, electricity, water system, eco-park buildings and other amenities for the campsite.

Lubigan, San Jose, Tarlac\n\nThe Monasterio de Tarlac was established in 2003 as the hermitage house for five (5) monks of the Priory of the Servants of the Risen Christ (SRC), a congregation of monastic brothers (more appropriately addressed as Frater) led by its Prior, Frater Ronald Thomas Cortez, SRC or Fr. Archie to his friends. The congregation has a total population of thirty (30) Fraters all over the country as of 2007 - all destined to a life of monasticism and contemplative life. The rather solitary and prayerful life in the monastery took an unexpected turn when it became the fitting shrine of the authentic relic or fragment of the True Cross upon which Jesus Christ was crucified and died in Golgotha, according to Christian tradition.\n\nThe historic moment came in 2005 during the World Youth Day in Cologne, Germany when Msgr. Volker Bauer of the Diocese of Essen, Germany offered to turn over to Prior, Fr. Archie, the Sacred Wood since the monastic life was slowly fading in Europe. On January 30, 2007, the Silver Reliquary containing portion of the Cross was flown in by Msgr. Bauer in the Church of the Risen Christ at the monastery in San Jose, Tarlac where its dedication was officiated by His Excellency Most Rev. Fernando Filoni, D.D., Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines, together with Tarlac Bishop Florentino F. Cinense, and a host of other clergy.\n\nThis particle of the True Cross was originally located in a church in Germany until the advent of communism which outlawed the practice of Christian faith thus giving way to Catholic churches being converted into museums and warehouses. Many of these pieces of the Wooden Cross were kept in secret places by Christians of old only to be distributed in later years to churches around the world. The reliquary is known to be the only one in the entire continent of Asia.\n\nTo accommodate the growing hordes of devotees to the shrine in Tarlac, the Prior decided to celebrate the Holy Mass daily (except Thursday) at 10:00 in the morning after which the faithful is allowed to the reliquary to pay their homage and be blessed with spirituality.\n\nTwice a year, the silver-guilt reliquary is laid open for public viewing on January 30, the date it was enshrined, and on September 14, when the entire Christian community celebrates the anniversary of the dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and for which the Vatican officially named the day in 1963 as the Feast of the Triumph of the Cross. Atop the imposing altar is the inscription in Latin: Ave, Crux, Spes, Unica which means Hail, the Holy Cross, Our Only Hope. It is traditionally believed that more healing takes place during these dates.\n\nThe sprawling monastery with dormitory and viewing decks offers a commanding view of the mountainous terrain of the towns of Tarlac nearby and the imposing 30-ft. Statue of the Risen Christ. The priory is open to the conduct of spiritual renewals such as retreats and recollections for both students and adults. The fraters would be happy to conduct one for individuals or groups.\n\nThe veneration of the True Cross finds its origin in the legend of Helena. According to Christian tradition, when Emperor Constantine granted religious freedom to Christians in the Roman Empire in 313 A.D., his mother, Queen Helena, later in 326 A.D. made pilgrimage to the Holy Land to locate those places sacred to Christians and find the Cross of Jesus. With the help of Christians there, she found many places where Jesus lived, and carried out his ministry. Queen Helena had churches built in many of these sacred sites (e.g., the Tomb of the Holy Sepulchre, the Calvary, the Nativity, etc.). She also found the True Cross, buried under a pagan temple, the nails, and the title that was affixed to the Cross. She is said to have verified the true cross among the three that were unearthed through miracles (a dead girl was restored to life when touched by the True Cross) . She left part of the Cross in Jerusalem, gave part to her son in Constantinople, and took part back to Rome where the Church of the Holy Cross of Jerusalem was built. Pieces of the Cross were venerated as holy relics, and fragments were given as gifts to many churches in Europe. Sixteen centuries later in 2007, a fragment of the True Cross found its place in the Church of the Risen Christ in a peaceful and quiet Monasterio de Tarlac.\n\nHow to Get There\n\nFrom Manila, take the North Luzon Expressway, exit Sta.
