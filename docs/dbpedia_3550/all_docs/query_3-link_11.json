        "text": "The period from the 15th to the 17th centuries CE in the Southeast Asian region has been termed as the ‘Age of Commerce’. It is characterised by marked delineation of societies, unprecedented urban expansion and the formation of states largely derived from a vibrant sea-borne trade not only within the countries of the region but also with China in the east and India and the Arab states in the west. Historical and archaeological sources indicate that the 15th century set the stage for the entry of Southeast Asia into the maritime economy that linked east and west prior to the arrival of the Europeans in the 16th century CE. What was the impact of this regional trade in the Philippines? Recent archaeological research has generated a significant corpus of data from terrestrial and submerged sites during the Philippine protohistoric period (c. 9th – 16th centuries CE). This paper will present the archaeological investigation results of three shipwrecks (Pandanan, Lena Shoal and Santa Cruz) and three terrestrial sites (Tanjay, Cebu, Calatagan) in an attempt to elucidate the process of how foreign archaeological materials were brought into the Philippines and if these materials used by the existing local societies during that period.\n\nIn the early 1830s and 1840s, a British colonial official by the name of Colonel James Low uncovered evidence for an early culture with Indic traits in a river system known as the Bujang Valley. On the west coast of the Thai-Malay peninsula, the Bujang Valley is today located in the Malaysian state of Kedah. However, it wasn't until just before World War II that excavations took place, conducted by H. G. Quaritch Wales and his wife Dorothy. Their discoveries and subsequent publications led to the first real attempts to explain the origins and extent of this civilisation and its place within the larger South and Southeast Asian world. In the intervening years between Quaritch Wales's excavations and the present day, considerably more research has taken place within the Bujang Valley, though this has not been without controversy. Recently claims and counter-claims regarding the antiquity of Hinduism and Buddhism at the site have arisen in some quarters within Malaysia. It therefore seems pertinent that this material be re-evaluated in light of new scholarship and discoveries as well as the prevailing paradigms of interactions between South and Southeast Asia. This paper presents an updated reading of this material and argues that the Bujang Valley should be seen as a cosmopolitan trading port with substantive evidence for the presence of Hinduism and Buddhism.\n\nStudies of trade routes across Southeast Asia in prehistory have hitherto focused largely on archaeological evidence from Mainland Southeast Asia, particularly the Thai Peninsula and Vietnam. The role of Indonesia and Island Southeast Asia in these networks has been poorly understood, owing to the paucity of evidence from this region. Recent research has begun to fill this void. New excavations at Sembiran and Pacung on the northern coast of Bali have produced new, direct AMS dates from burials, and analytical data from cultural materials including pottery, glass, bronze, gold andsemi-precious stone, as well as evidence of local bronze-casting. This suggests strong links with the Indian subcontinent and Mainland Southeast Asia from the late first millennium BC, some 200 years earlier than previously thought. Sembiran and Pacung on the northern coast of Bali: a strategic crossroads for early trans-Asiatic exchange. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275020269_Sembiran_and_Pacung_on_the_northern_coast_of_Bali_a_strategic_crossroads_for_early_trans-Asiatic_exchange [accessed Apr 26, 2015].\n\nStudies of trade routes across Southeast Asia in prehistory have hitherto focused largely on archaeological evidence from Mainland Southeast Asia, particularly the Thai Peninsula and Vietnam.

This paper takes a multidisciplinary approach in studying the site by discussing the recovered artifacts and tracing significant literary works penned since the Spanish occupation up to the contemporary period. The findings, which demonstrated vast settlements, widespread industrial work, sustained trade relations with China and Indochina, and uniform burial styles were indications of environmental, cultural, political, industrial, and philosophical realities and activities which existed around the area."
