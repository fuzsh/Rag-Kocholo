        "text": "was the first independent republic in Asia by Asians. It was born during a war for independence and lasted for only two (2) years. The Malolos Congress and Malolos Constitution\n\nEighty-five (85) Filipinos met in a revolutionary congress at Barasoain Church, Malolos, Bulacan starting September 15, 1898. It was headed by Dr. Pedro A. Paterno.\n\nThe constitution of the First Philippine Republic was also called the &quot;Malolos Constitution&quot; because it was written in Malolos, Bulacan. Its real author was Felipe G. Calderon, a famous Filipino lawyer. It was approved by the Malolos Congress on November 29, 1898 and proclaimed by General Aguinaldo on January 21, 1899. The First Philippine Republic\n\nOn January 23, 1899, the First Philippine Republic was inaugurated at Barasoain Church, Malolos Bulacan. It was a solemn and happy time. The Filipinos wanted to show the world that they had their own government at last.\n\nAguinaldo was sworn in as president of the First Republic at the church altar.\n\nThe official newspaper of the government was called El Heraldo de la Revolution. General Antonio Luna and other Fili- pinos ran an independence newspaper called La Independencia. There were other free papers in Manila and in Cebu.\n\nThe new government also had diplomats abroad. The first filipino diplomat was Felipe States. Agoncillo. He was sent to Paris and Wash- ington to work for recognition of Philippine Independence. Failure of the First Philippine Republic\n\nEnded on the day when Aguinaldo was captured by the Americans. It takes more than parades and fiestas to become a truly independent country, we had to fight for it. The Americans Start the War\n\nThe Americans started the Filipino-American war. This was the war of independence by the Filipinos against the Americans who wanted to make the Philippines a colony of the United States. -Americans start the war and pretended that Filipinos had brutally attacked them. In February 4, 1899, an American sharp- shooter, Private Robert W. Grayson of the First Nebraska Volunteers, shot and killed a Filipino soldier that kick started the shooting incident between the Filipinos and Americans. The Filipino-American War. The Filipinos fought a war of independence again. This time it was against the Americans, their former allies. It was the second fight for Independence by the Filipinos.\n\nAt daybreak of February 5, 1899, the American navy bombarded the Filipino positions in Manila.\n\nOn March 31, 1899, the Americans cap- tured Malolos, which was then the capital of the First Philippine Republic. Aguinaldo fled to Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, and finally to the mountains of Northern Luzon.\n\nIn Negros, Generals Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta organized the &quot;Republic of Negros&quot; on November 27, 1898. At first, the American invaders helped them. But later, the American government toppled it.\n\nIn the Battle of San Mateo, Rizal on December 19, 1899, the famous hero of the American Civil War, General Henry C. Lawton was killed by Filipino troops. Guerilla Warfare The Filipinos fought with old rifles and guns, bamboo and bolos. The Americans fought with machine guns, automatic rifles, and Cannons, plenty of ammunition and supplies. Aguinaldo ordered the Filipinos to fight a guerilla warfare. During the day, they hid, and they only fought in surprise attacks. Aguinaldo&#039;s guerrilla warfare in 1899 to 1901 was earlier than Mao Zedong&#039;s Chinese guerrillas in the 1940s and Ho Chi Minh&#039;s Vietnamese guerillas in the 1970s. Filipino Victories in the War of Independence Massacre of Balangiga- (September 29, 1901)\n\nthe bolomen of Gen. Vicente Lukban wiped out the American garrison at Balangiga, Samar. U. Army General Jacob Smith ordered his men to burn homes and crops and kill even children. The U. President ordered the court-martial and disgraceful exit of Gen. Smith. Lukban became a hero and one of the builders of the new nation. The Battle of Quingua (now Plaridel), Bulacan- (April 23, 1899)\n\nFilipino sharpshooters led by the young General Gregorio del Pilar stopped a U. cavalry charge. Due to this victory, Aguinaldo chose del Pilar to guard his retreat. The town now bears the famous hero&#039;s name. The Battle of San Mateo – (December 19, 1899)\n\nThe Filipino &quot;Geronimo&quot;, General Licero Geronimo, and his snipers killed U. General Henry Lawton. Thus, General Lawton, the hero who had defeated Geronimo, the Apache Indian chief, met his end with another hero, a &quot;Filipino Geronimo”. Battle of Alaminos- (January 17, 1900) -Filipino guerrillas ambushed an American train at Alaminos, Laguna, and captured many war materials. The Battle of Pulang Lupa was Marinduque&#039;s &quot;finest hour&quot;-(September 13, 1900) -Lt. Col. Maximo Abad and his troops defeated the U. Army in the bloody battle of Pulang Lupa, near Sta. Cruz, Marinduque. Capt. James Shield and dozens of his soldiers were captured. The Battle of Mabitac – ( September 17, 1900)"
