        "text": "By Kristine Marie Althea Barranta, John Bertrand Faigao, and Amelia Mendiola\n\nEach town, province, and city has a history. It symbolizes and defines our identity as a country. While some are well-known, others are fading with time. The current generation will soon lose sight of the splendors of history as time passes. Should history be forgotten, and so will the youth have no past or future as ignorance shall bear the fruit of incompetence. Errors will therefore continue to occur until someone decides to halt the perpetual loop. Oscar Wilde’s once said, “Anybody can make history; only a great man can write it.” However, it appears that the current generation is rewriting history since they are oblivious of how Bulacan has been shaped by history.\n\nTeenagers nowadays would typically have no clue whenever history is in question, and the Battle of Kakarong de Sili is a prime example of the youth’s ignorance of the aforementioned Bulacan history. Adolescent naivety is often blamed for their reliance on misinformation and the lack of critical thinking, but we also need to be mindful of the fact that mankind does not make necessary efforts to promote history and gets barely enough recognition. And this is precisely the situation that the Battle of Kakarong de Sili is going through right now — its history is gradually being forgotten over time as the only historical figures that individuals are able to recall are Dr. Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Aguinaldo, and Marcelo H. del Pilar and the rest of the historical figures. Hence, this raises the question of how Bulakenyos can preserve the history of the Battle of Kakarong de Sili since history had a significant influence on the formation of our province as history is something that we should never forget?\n\nThe Community’s Origins\n\nOne of the most significant tales from the Philippines’ past is that of Kakarong de Sili, where, prior to Pandi’s declaration of independence in 1946, people from various parts of Bulacan came together in the remote barrio of Bigaa (now Balagtas) during the Philippine Revolution. In December of 1896, they formed a new republic, known as the Republika ng Kakarong. According to a book, Himagsikan ng mga Pilipino laban sa Kastila, written by Gen. Artemio Ricarte in 1927, the Spaniards appeared to be unaware of the recently established community. Both the Spanish and Philippine armies rose up in a rebellion in Cavite during the said period. According to Bobot Tecson, a historian, he further explained that because of the strong forces of the Filipinos in Cavite, the Spanish Forces prioritized the fight first before proceeding in other provinces that revolted against the colony.\n\nNasabi naman nila kasi doon malakas eh. Hindi muna nila nilusob yung…tinapos muna nila.\n\n[They said the [Cavite] was too strong. They didn’t get into it before they did.]\n\nEusebio Roque and His Popularity that Gained Many Followers\n\nHowever, little did they know, a new force arose in Bulacan, led by Eusebio Roque, a well-known mystic from the town of Bocaue. He is also known as the blacksmith of a powerful amulet, commonly called an agimat. His popularity rose in different provinces, such as Nueva Ecija, Batangas, and Laguna. Because of these, he gained numerous followers from different municipalities around the area of Pandi, such as Bustos, Plaridel (formerly Quingua), Angat, Marilao, and Sta. Maria, among others. He chose the barrio of Kakarong since the place was steep and rich in water, with resources coming from the mountains of the Sierra Madre. He performed different ritual acts and was fluent in speaking Latin.\n\nAccording to Isagani Giron, a historian, during an interview in a short documentary film entitled “MAESTRO: Ang Pasyon ni Hen. Eusebio Roque” in 2019, Sebio was considered by his followers as the “Messiah of Kakarong’’ because his long hair resembles Jesus Christ.\n\nSi Sebio nga raw, ay mukhang Kristo. So, nagbibigay siya ng ostia kapag nagkakaroon ng pakikipaglaban. Siya’y nagdadasal, so ang nakagawian ala-Kristo itong si Sebio.\n\n[Others had pointed out how Sebio resembles Christ. He would pray and give ostia whenever a battle would occur as he has a Christ-like habit.]\n\nWhen the Kakarong Republic was formed, Roque, also known as Maestrong Sebio, served as the Brigadier General, while Canuto Villanueva served as the supreme chief of the new republic. Another book, Philippine History by Maria Christine N. Halili, stated that around 6,000 people, including women and children, lived in Kakarong. All of them were enlisted as members of Balangay Dimasalang, a group of Katipunan in Bulacan. They also built a fort called Real de Kakarong. It has streets, a police station, a factory that has various armed equipment such as bolos and riffles, and some repair shops. In short, it was a huge community led by the Katipuneros. Maestrong Sebio had his remarkable days as he formed the first republic in Bulacan. However, his destiny and the fledgling nation he founded will be altered by an occurrence.\n\nThe Battle for Freedom\n\nAs the population grew in Kakarong, problems began to emerge, such as lack of food and equipment in the fort of Kakarong de Sili. In line with this, Felipe Estrella, Roque’s right hand, was given the command to go to San Rafael to get all of the things which had been stored in Hacienda Buenavista, located in Tambubong. However, on the New Year’s day of 1897, the Spanish forces made their surprise attack in the Kakarong de Sili, launching a massive strike in the community. Tecson explained that they killed everything that they saw, civilians, animals, and others. They also burned the houses of the new republic.\n\nMeanwhile, other soldiers retreated and escaped from the battlefield. Maestro Sebio managed to flee to the town of Bustos, but was captured and arrested by the Spaniards. Soon after, he was executed in Bulakan, Bulacan on January 16th. As a result, around 1,100 of Katipuneros fought for freedom from the colonizers. Sebio was only 32 when he was executed. Furthermore, the Republic of Kakarong was dissolved after the fight, and the republic lasted for a month.\n\nIn honor of their bravery and patriotism, a monument of Inang Filipina (Mother Philippines) was erected in 1924 by the Kakarong Lodge no. 168 of the group named Legionarios del Trabajo. In 1968, in celebration of the 22th founding anniversary of the town of Pandi which became independent from the town of Balagtas, they erected the historical marker of the National Historical Commission on the site of Inang Filipina. They also erected a mural in 1993 by A. Bulaong which shows the actual event of the Kakarong de Sili. Real de Cacarong was named after the fort where the republic was formed.\n\nFollowing Kakarong de Sili: 127 Years Later\n\nIt has been 127 years since the Republic of Kakarong was formed, especially the Bulakenyos who do not know the significance of the Kakarong de Sili’s rich history. In fact. Elmer Jacinto, a tourism officer of Pandi Tourism Office, claimed that the park’s grounds were covered in dried leaves and left untidy every day before it was opened, which meant there were no barriers. While the paint used to create the brief description of the historic site was drying, the details were gradually disappearing. Furthermore, Jacinto claims that people are too preoccupied with celebrating typical holidays like New Year’s Day to be aware of Kakarong’s rich past.\n\nHindi siya naipo-promote dahil may kasabay po siya na mas mahalagang okasyon… ’yun kasi ang pinopokus nila ay yung countdown at fireworks display. Kaya ang hirap sa part namin.\n\n[The history] wasn’t promoted well because the event happens to be celebrated on the same day, which is also important. Their focus is the new year’s celebration, so it was so hard on our part.]\n\nJacinto further says that Bulakenyos are only familiar with well-known historical occurrences such as the Malolos Republic, Marcelo H. Del Pilar, and Gregorio Del Pilar, among others. Another factor is a lack of transit solutions. The shrine is situated 25 kilometers from the capital, and the lone jeep from Sta. Maria that travels to Real de Cacarong is rare compared to other jeepneys. Commercial establishments are not present in the park because it is a tranquil location without transportation. And because the place was very far from the center, only residents of Real de Cacarong or bikers frequent the place unlike other historical places in the province. These factors caused Kakarong de Sili’s valuable history to gradually fade into oblivion.\n\nThe Revival of Kakarong de Sili\n\nJacinto expresses that it is a must to pay tribute to Kakarong de Sili stories through writing and visiting the Inang Filipina shrine.\n\nIpina-require namin, with the help of the supervisor ng DepED Bulacan, na before mag-tour ang estudyante — private or public; bago sila lumabas ng Pandi — mai-tour muna ang estudyante sa Inang Filipina Shrine.\n\n[We ask that the student be given a tour of the Inang Filipina Shrine before they leave Pandi and before they embark on any tours, either private or public, with the assistance of the DepED Bulacan supervisor.]\n\nIn his recent statement, Jacinto believes that literature might be useful in promoting local historical sites. He is convinced that promoting through writing can help both persuade and attract people, and it also allows for greater communication.\n\nAnother thing na program namin para mas makilala tutal, parang ang gusto ng karamihan- tayo ay underrated history, ay isama po siya sa mga blogger- historian blogger. Nakipag-coordinate na rin po kami dito sa history, yung parang Sama Ka na samahan po ng mga historian dito sa Bulacan na i-feature po ang Inang Filipina Shrine.\n\n[Adding it to the list of historian bloggers is another programme we have in place to gain greater attention because, as it turns out, that’s what most people want — we are underappreciated historical figures. In order for the Inang Filipina Shrine to be highlighted, we have also organized historical events such as Sama Ka, a group of historians here in Bulacan to feature the Inang Filipina shrine.]\n\nSo, we’re making an effort na yung aming local newspaper ay gawin po naming national — sa tulong ng Daily-Inquirer, Manila Bulletin — na ma-isama yung kwento ng labanan ng Kakarong de Sili.\n\n[We’re making an effort to make our local newspaper to make it national — with the help of Daily-Inquirer, Manila Bulletin — to include the story of the Battle of Kakarong de Sili.]\n\nKaya ang initiative namin is bukod doon sa sinasabi naming promotions, sa social media, we’re discussing na ‘to sa mga blogger- yung historial blogger, na maisama po ang Inang Filipina Shrine para sa kanilang mga content.\n\n[Therefore, in addition to what we were saying about the social media promotion, we are discussing it with bloggers — the historical bloggers — about including the Inang Filipina Shrine into their work.]\n\nJacinto also believes that the shrine is not well known to the general public, which is why efforts are being made to increase public awareness of the Inang Filipina Shrine.\n\nPero, we’re doing an actions na maging tourism center po ng Pandi ang Real de Kakarong.\n\n[We are also taking steps to turn Real de Kakarong into a major Pandi tourist center.]\n\nTecson asserts that they established SAMPAKA (Samahang Pangkasaysayan ng Bulacan), a group of historians of Bulacan, with the help of Dr. Jaime Veneracion, a historian who founded their organization, which allows them to construct, investigate, study, and converse about re-establishing connections with the past.\n\nGinawa namin, nagtayo kami ng SAMPAKA dito sa Bulacan para nga magsaliksik, pag-aralan, pag-usapan.\n\n[What we did was, we built SAMPAKA in Bulacan to conduct research, study, and initiate discussions.]\n\nHe further added that the best way to promote history is to have different platforms that illuminate the current situation. In response to the question of how they promote history, he also stated that they do a lot of research, studies, and promotion.\n\nSa pamamagitan ng pananaliksik at imbestigasyon, ito yung ilan sa mga ginawa namin: palatuntunan, paggunita, programa, pagkilala, pagpapahalaga, pagpaparangal, balik tanaw kung sino sila … yung mga bayani natin, a[t] tsaka yung mga naganap.\n\n[These are just a handful of the actions that we worked out: a programme of gratitude, restoration of our heroes identity, acknowledgment and looking back at who they are.]\n\nTinuturuan namin ang mga bata tungkol sa nakaraan para makilala nila ang ating mga bayani, lalo na ‘yung hindi kilala. Nagsasagawa kami ng mga seminars at gumagawa ng libro taon-taon para balikan at ingatan ang nakaraan.\n\n[We teach children about our past and educate them in recognizing our heroes — especially the unsung ones. We held several seminars and published books annually to help us to look back and preserve the past.]\n\nIn Tecson’s point of view, he stated that having a lot of research helps them discover the unknown. It is their belief that having a lot of investigation and studying history can help them to remember the sense of our identity. He also concluded that having knowledge is crucial. It facilitates our search for new learnings that expands our understanding of ourselves as individuals within our society.\n\nSa pamamagitan ng pananaliksik at imbestigasyon ay nadi-discover namin ang hindi pa kilala at dahil sa pag-aaral at imbestigasyon ng ating kasaysayan ay naaalala natin kung sino tayo at nakadadagdag kaalaman din ito sa pagkatuto na makakatulong sa ating lipunan.\n\n[Through research and investigation, we discover the unknown. Also, by studying and investigating our past events, we could better recall and understand ourselves. That can help to gain knowledge that could help our society.]\n\nTaon-taon, tuwing birthday nga, tuwing kamatayan nung mga bayani halimbawa, yung storya sa Biak na Bato,\n\n[Every year, we produce books to commemorate the birth and death of our heroes, such as the Biak na Bato story.]\n\nEstelita Dumalag, a student who lives in Pandi, believes that funding is required in order to preserve historical places and promote history.\n\nUsapang budget– hindi talaga masasabi na halimbawa sa ibang park, example na lang yung sa circle ‘di gano[o]n ka-ganda pero masasabi mo din kaaya-aya, na inaalagaan naman. Sa ganyang paraan namin na pro-promote ang history.\n\n[So when we talk about budget, it’s hard to determine how it would compare to other parks. The park in the circle, for instance, isn’t attractive, but you can also say that it’s pleasant and well-kept. That is how we promote our history.]\n\nDumalag also concluded that there are few things that can be done to support Kakarong de Sili, such as showing respect and acknowledgment by going to the shrine more frequently and developing a better comprehension and awareness of the tale of Kakarong.\n\nYung Siling Bata na sinasabi ko, kung alam mo yung lugar na ‘yun, yung Virginia na school, ‘di kasi siya dati na-iaapply yung mga gano[o]ng bagay lalo sa mga field trip. Pero ngayon ina-adopt nila, yung importansya ng pagbisita sa Inang Filipina Shrine.\n\n[The Siling Bata I mentioned, if you are familiar with the Virginia school, was not accustomed to applying for such things, particularly on field trips, but they have now adopted the importance of visiting the Inang Filipina Shrine.]\n\nNapansin ko sa mga bata dito, pati sa mga pamangkin ko na nire-require ng mga teachers na pag-aralan nila ang story ng Kakarong.\n\n[I have noticed that the children here, even my nieces and nephews’ instructors, are required to learn the stories of Kakarong de Sili.]\n\nBinibigyan namin sila ng pagkilala kung sino sila, maliban do[o]n, kinikilala namin ang hindi kilala,\n\n[We give them recognition for who they are, and other than that, we recognize the unknown,]\n\nAs mentioned by Tecson, history should be reinstated and prioritized since students should know the significance of history and how it affects us. He also realized that books play a significant role when it comes to information, and that is why they publish books every year because they provide us with deeper information, experience, and insight that may help us remember the past.\n\nKaya karamihan ng mga estudyante ngayon, wala masyado alam. Ayun ang gusto namin ibalik, tinanggal ang history eh.\n\n[As the students nowadays are ignorant of our historical events, that’s why we wanted to bring back history subjects.]\n\nNagpasa rin kami ng petisyon para maibalik ang history majors.\n\n[We even submitted a petition to reestablish history majors.]\n\nHistory Shapes Us of Who We Are\n\nJacinto worries in dismay about the lack of patriotism among the current generation because of how they disregard the grandeur of history.\n\nYung heroism kasi o yung pagkamakabayan po ng kabataan ngayon, parang nawawala.\n\n[The patriotism in today’s youth doesn’t seem to be present these days.]\n\nNot only do young people not know about the Battle of the Kakarong de Sili, but we are more concerned about the rise in historical illiteracy. This is because the educational system uses memorization to teach students about history. Memorization is a useful tool for learning the fundamentals of a subject, but its benefits are temporary. Although it is helpful, it does not retain the information and comprehension that a particular subject offers. It lacks the critical thinking skills necessary to discern between what is and is not factual. Furthermore, students who memorize will grow accustomed to the idea that studying history is just about memorization and will eventually come to regret the importance of the legacy that history has left behind.\n\nJacinto presses,\n\nSo kung tatanungin, kung bakit kailangan[g] itong bigyan ng importansya at halaga, kasi ka-akibat tayo kung ano tayo ngayon dahil sa nakaraan natin.\n\n[If one were to question why it should be valued and given importance, the answer would be that our past has shaped who we are now.]\n\nTecson, in line with this, agrees as well.\n\nPara ‘di makalimutan at sa gano[o]n matuto tayo[n]g mahalin ang ating bayan at igalang.\n\n[We learn to love and respect our nation by keeping in mind and act accordingly.]\n\nIt is frightening to think that some heroes may not have gotten the commendation and praise they deserve, despite the bravery and selflessness they showed in contributing to our victory, which we are still celebrating today. And despite the fact that the names of the Kakarong de Sili heroes are not as well-known as the others, their bravery and heroism changed us.\n\nAs explained by Tecson,\n\nYung ginawang pakikipaglaban ng mga tao sa Kakarong at pagkakaisa, ‘yun ay dahil upang ipakita at ipadama yung pagmamahal nila sa bayan; yung pakikipag-isa, pagmamahal, pakikipaglaban, kaya ka nakikipaglaban ‘di ba? Para sa prinsipyo mo. Gusto natin maging malaya, ayaw natin na tayo maging alipin.\n\n[People’s passion for their country is demonstrated by their battles and unity in Kakarong; after all, that’s why they fight, right? For your principle, that is. We do not want to be slaves; we want to be free.]\n\nThe Katipuneros gave their lives in defense of us and shed blood, sweat, and tears; we hope to be able to return the favor someday for their unwavering commitment to our nation’s prosperity.\n\nThe Story of Kakarong de Sili Will Live Forever\n\nWe cannot allow the lack of enthusiasm to commemorate the historical Battle of Kakarong de Sili to affect us, because if we do, how likely are we to be the people’s ray of hope? If we put up with the disdain for the preservation of Pandi’s past, how can we make our nation proud? The efforts that the Pandi heroes made for us would be wasted for nothing. Therefore, we can honor the historical heroes by visiting the site of their heroic deeds, spreading awareness through a historical reenactment, and providing the guest speakers with a platform to educate the present generation about Pandi, Bulacan. By learning to preserve history, we can gain a greater understanding of how earlier societies handled similar scenarios, which is why we should never repeat the mistakes made by history in the past. Therefore, the accounts of those who experienced the horrors of history serve as a constant reminder to us of the scars that history has inflicted upon them, and it is something that we must never forget.\n\nThe only objects that have endured and can aid us in understanding our past are history and the artifacts that are still in existence. It needs to be maintained in order for it to continue to be relevant in the future. To do this, it must educate the public, especially the younger generation, and help them fully comprehend and learn about the historical events that have occurred in our country. However, without the support of our government, which is essential to maintaining the past, none of this could be accomplished. It is necessary that our government allocate more funds and support the historical sites that are still unrecognized and underappreciated, like Kakarong de Sili. Their contributions to our freedom and our victory would not have been possible without them.\n\nReferences:"
