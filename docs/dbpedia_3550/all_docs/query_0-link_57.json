        "text": "1\n\n6\n\nReadings in the Philippines BS COMPUTER ENGINEER History\n\nTsk Performance 2021\n\n“ BULACAN ”\n\n(“The gateway to the northern Philippines”)\n\nHistory\n\nThe name \"Bulakan\" was derived from the Tagalog word \"bulak\" which is cotton in English. When the Spaniards first came to the country's shore, they found cotton, among others, growing abundantly in many places in Luzon, particularly in Bulakan.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the Spaniards, Bulakan, as well as the rest of the towns of Bulacan province, was consisted of small scattered settlements of villages each then called \"barangay\", a word derived from the name of the boats used by the early seafaring Malays who went to various islands of what we now called Philippines. These predecessors of our ancestors settled in different parts of the archipelago, and their villages and barangays swere each headed by a petty chieftain who bore the title \"Gat\" as is Gat-Maytan, Gat-Salian, and \"Gat-Dula\", and \"Lakan\" as in Lakandula. These early settlers lived along the seashores and rivers, thus they were called \"tagailog\", meaning people who dwell near the rivers or other waterways. From this term \"taga- ilog\" came the word \"Tagalog\".\n\nThe early Tagalog were peaceful, honest, industrious and hardworking and were engaged in farming, fishing and handicrafts, especially weaving.\n\nFrom the original thriving native settlements or villages called \"barangays\", the Augustinian founded most of the towns in the province of Bulacan, including the town of Bulakan which was founded in 1572 and one of the 385 towns founded by the Augustinians throughout the Philippines. Another account of the founding of Bulakan town points to Father Agustin de Albuquerque, O.S., as the first minister and founder of Bulakan.\n\nthe Spanish regime to keep gold, religious statues, and ornate jewelry hidden from the sight of treasure hunters. Likewise, it is in this tunnel where revolutionaries and Spaniards were buried during the war. This was also Gen. Tanaka’s (Japanese Imperial Army) last battlefield. Battle of Quingua Monument\n\nFilipinos are well-known to be courageous and freedom lovers. The people of Plaridel are no exception. The marker commemorates the historic Battle of Quingua (Plaridel at present) where the Filipinos triumphed over the American forces in their fight for freedom. Likewise, it also commemorates the death of Col. John Stotsenberg a prominent figure of the Philippine-American war.\n\nMarcelo H. del Pilar Shrine Marcelo H. del Pilar—patriot, writer, editor of the revolutionary paper La Solidaridad—is honored with this monument in Bulacan where he lived most of his life. The shrine is under the management of the National Historical Institute.\n\nBarasoain Church A national shrine, the historic Barasoain Church is the site of the Constitutional Convention of the first\n\nPhilippine Republic, making the Philippines the very first Asian Government to promulgate a Constitution. It was the Seat of the First Philippine Republic on Sept. 15, 1898 to the last week of Feb. 1899 under the presidency of Pedro Paterno. In its convent the Universidad Literaria Cientifica de Filipinas was first housed. It also boasts of a light and sound museum under the management of National Historical Institute.\n\nBarasoain Ecclesiastical Museum\n\nA museum managed by National Historical Institute showcasing a collection of municipal antiques and priceless array of artifacts.\n\nBulacan Museum\n\nThe Museo ng Bulacan (Bulacan Museum) houses a collection of valuable relics and mementos, articles, documents and handicrafts of the Philippine revolution. Located in Malolos to promote the cultural heritage and tradition of the province. It is under the management of the Provincial Government of Bulacan.\n\nNative Customs\n\nMention Bulacan and one gets the impression the whole province is dotted with candy factories and the Bulaqueños have made a pastime of eating dessert. But there’s so much more to\n\npropagandist Marcelo H Pilar and his nephew Gen. Gregorio Del Pilar; revolutionary patriots Mariano Ponce, Pio Valenzuela and Maximo Viola; Gen. Anacleto Enriquez and his brother Vicente; Katipunera Trinidad Tecson; the 21 Women of Malolos. Religion and Ceremonies\n\nRoman Catholic was the dominant religious affiliation in Bulacan comprising (90%) of the household population. Other religions were Iglesia ni Cristo (3%), Evangelical (2%), United Methodist Church (0 %), and jehovah's Witness (0%) Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto Shrine Located in Barangay Graceville. An exact replica of Our Lourdes in France. It has a land area of 20 hectares.\n\nMadre Alessadra House of Prayer Located in Purok 8, Barangay Tungkong Mangga. Augustinian Contemplation Nun. Designed to assist solitude and reflection, prayer and dialogue, and welcome and friendship, the retreat house is a place where individuals and groups can spend time to experience the loving and assuring embrace of God.\n\nSt. Joseph the Worker Parish Church Located in Barangay Poblacion I. Built in 1854, a strapping symbol of Christian devotees unwavering religious faith.\n\nPaombong, Bulacan has one of the longest Holy Wednesday and Good Friday processions in the country. A way of repentance and sharing in the sufferings of Christ, worshippers whip themselves or have themselves crucified.\n\nMeyto Shrine (Calumpit bulacan) this is the cradle of Christianity in the province, where the first Catholic Mass was held by the Augustinian friars, armed with cross in 1572.\n\nFeast of the Holy Cross of Wawa Bocaue, bulacan a festival held on the first Sunday of July observed in honor of the Holy Cross of Wawa (Mahal na Krus sa Wawa) which is said to have saved the life of an old woman who was drowning. The main feature of this fiesta celebration is the Pagoda which, glides along the Bocaue River. The Pagoda is a\n\ngailydecorated structure riding on a huge banca. People from all walks of life enjoy the ride on the Pagoda feasting on sumptuous food while the music play. Foods and Products\n\nThis is one of the two most popular products of Eurobake, a well-known bakeshop located at Macarthur highway near boundary arch of Malolos-Guiguinto towns. Its difference from ensaymada kampampangan is that the Malolos versions has added salted egg and ham on larger version. The pasty has a creamy cheesy taste with added kick of salted egg.\n\nThe other offering and flagship product of Eurobake is still the inipit. This pastry is made from two flat chiffon cakes, pressed and laden with custard in between. Hence, inipit or \"pressed\". It's like eating a mammon with leche flan inside. Tough a bit pricey compared to its size, the quality of the product is still there, as they say.\n\nSan Miguel town at north of Bulacan is known for their pastillas made from carabao's milk. A pasalubong shop at highway near a bus stopover\n\nthese mushrooms taste like chicharon. I resisted eating only few of these, but I can't help to finish all the contents. It's very addicting! Hoping to buy other flavors when I had a chance to see these nearby. Before crossing the bridge leading to Bustos town, I searched for a bakery selling \"putok Baliuag\". I got curious on what is its form and taste. After walking from the town plaza and passing by the old town hall (now a museum), I saw this bakery called Lin-Mers. At their countertop, I noticed these little buns labeled \"Putok Special\". I knew this is what I'm looking for. The appearance is just like your ordinary pandesal bought at local bakeries, but the taste is milky, reminding me of pinagong from Sariaya, but still pandesal dough was used. I'd say this pandesal version is milky and heavy in tummy.\n\nSanta Maria town is best known for poultry products as well as chicharon-making industry. I've seen Jennie's brand in several TV shows and luckily, my officemate bought this product for our team building. I happily exclaimed that this snack is what I sought for. The seasoned crackling is addictive. There are other variants and flavors available, but I prefer the classic one.\n\nSingkaban (Decorated bamboo arch)\n\nBamboo art is also a leading handicraft business in Malolos, Hagonoy, and Meycauayan, areas that are just 30 minutes to an hour away from Amaia Scapes Bulacan in Sta, Maria. A celebrated art, elaborately designed bamboo arches adorn streets and church doors during town fiestas. One will also see these Embellished bamboo arches during Santacruzans and parades. Every second week of September, grand bamboo arches are displayed on the streets to celebrate the Singkaban Festival.\n\nBuntal weaving\n\nBuntal refers to the fiber obtained from the stalks of the talipot palms. The fiber is mainly used in weaving hats and bags. These craftworks are commonly sold in Baliuag public market, and the prices depend on the size, color, and complexity of the design. Based on the book ‘Baliuag Then and Now,’ which was written by Rolando Villacorte, the weaving industry in the town is more than a hundred years old. It started when Mariano Deveza, a Lucban, Quezon native, went to Baliuag with a bag of buntal fibers in tow. This sparked the\n\nremoval of the friars and the secularization of the parishes, active Filipino participation in the affairs of the government, freedom of speech, of the press and political freedoms.
