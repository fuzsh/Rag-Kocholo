        "text": "Aling Pining's Crispy Pata (La Loma, Quezon City)\n\nOne of Metro Manila's BEST Crispy Pata can be found in a Garage. I found about Aling Pining's Crispy Pata in a FB Comment a few months ago. The Commenter just said the best Crispy Pata can be found in a Garage in Halcon Street in La Loma. With Just Halcon Street as the address we went to La Loma 2 weeks ago in search of Halcon Street Crispy Pata. When we arrived at Halcon Street we just asked the people there where we can buy Crispy Pata. We passed by it already it turned out. It was indeed just a garage. It had a small sign. Halcon Street Crispy Pata was Aling Pinings Crispy Pata. An Old Lady was the one frying the Crispy Pata. While a middle aged woman was the one accepting orders. We bought a Crispy Pata (P400) and we were on our way. At home we were eager to finally taste the Crispy Pata. It did not disappoint. The trip to La Loma was worth it. Is it the best? My mom said the one in Marinduque is still the best. For me? Well i need to go back to\n\nBacolod's Central Market (Bacolod, Negros Occidental)\n\nI have been to Bacolod countless times already but it was only last March 10, 2011 that i got the chance to visit Bacolod's Central Market. From what i saw and remember what was written on the Marker of the Central Market, it was built in 1938 by a certain Don De La Rama. The Central Market is located in the center of Bacolod and can entered from 4 streets, namely Gatuslao, Gonzaga, Luzuriaga and Bonifacio Streets. We went straight to the meat section of the Central Market to look for Longaniza (Chorizo is how they call it in Negros). The Longaniza we were looking for is the small one, we bought some Longaniza before in Talisay and it was very delicious and we were hoping that they would have it too in Bacolod. We found a Longaniza stall in the Meat Section, it was being sold for P25.00 for a Dozen. We bought several to take home. We also bought some Batuan at the nearby stall for P80.00 a Kilo. We were also looking for Kuakoy. We found it being sold by an old lady just outsid"
