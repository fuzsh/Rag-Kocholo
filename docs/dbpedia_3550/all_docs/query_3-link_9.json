        "text": "Industry History\n\nThe Philippine jewelry-making trade has been in existence since the early 16th century. Historical records indicate that jewelry-making dates back to the late Stone Age as evidenced by bracelets, pendants and beads from that era. It is believed that skill in making jewelry has been acquired the early Filipinos from their Asian neighbors like the Chinese.\n\nTraditionally, jewelry-making is a home based industry intended to be a source of livelihood for the family. It has become an industry worthy of government attention and support. Given proper support, the industry can contribute to national economic development by increasing the sector's export receipts and maximizing the country's position as a top producer of gold.\n\nII. Industry Profile\n\nSub-sectors in the jewelry industry\n\nTwo sub-sectors comprise the Philippine Jewelry Industry. These are the fine jewelry sub-sector and the costume jewelry sub-sector. The Philippine fine jewelry industry is engaged in the production of two major product categories, namely:\n\nprecious metal jewelry; and\n\npearls, precious and semi-precious stones.\n\nPrecious metal jewelry refers to ornaments made of gold and silver that may or may not be mounted with gemstones. Precious metal jewelry can be in the form of rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, brooches, pendants, tie-pins cuff links; and decorative items such as spoons, forks; and office items such as pen and paper holders.\n\nPrecious metal jewelry made of gold is the major product of the Philippines. Silver jewelry comprise a smaller portion of the business but is steadily increasing.\n\nPearls, precious stones and semi-precious stones are unworked or worked pearls, cut and polished diamonds and colored gemstones such as emerald, rubies and sapphires in loose form. They vary according to size, color, cut, clarity and luster as in the case of pearls. Precious stones are defined as diamonds, emerald, rubies and sapphires with some addition of pearls. All other gems are considered as semi-precious.\n\nNotwithstanding the availability of raw materials and the capability of local manufacturers to meet local demand, imported jewelry items still abound in the local market. Usually, these jewelry items are made of gold coming from Italy, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nNo official statistics as to the size of the domestic market for jewelry exist. There is also no reliable data on how much of the locally-available jewelry are made domestically or originated from foreign sources. In 1994, De Beers places the Philippine diamond jewelry market at US $62 million. If it is safely assumed that 50% of all jewelry are made with diamonds while the other half are gold and silver set with other stones, then the market size is estimated to be around US$120 million. This can be higher considering that diamond jewelry accounts for only 20-30% of the total jewelry market In this case, the market size for jewelry in the Philippines could be as high as US$ 200 million.\n\nThere are six areas in the country where majority of jewelry manufacturing firms are located and these are Benguet, Metro Manila, Cebu, Davao, the Caraga Region, and Bulacan. The jewelry industry in the Philippines is a fragmented one composed of cottage-type small firms with little investments in new technology like modern tools and equipment.\n\nIn Bulacan, jewelry making is concentrated in the town of Meycauayan. There are about 2,000 jewelry manufacturers in the province. A local association, the Meycauayan Jewelry Industry Association, Inc. (MJIA), was formed in 1985 to oversee and assume the lead role in the development of the jewelry industry in the province. The MJIA has grown from an original membership of 37 to the current 106.\n\nIII. Export Performance and Potential\n\nIn 1994, the Philippine exported a total $13 million worth of jewelry products. However, total world demand for jewelry products during the same year was a high $18 billion. Philippine ex[port during the year accounted for only 0.07 percent of total world demand. The comparative advantages of the local jewelry industry, therefore, was not maximized as the local industry performed below capacity in so far as the availability of gold and workers (around 100,000 at that time) is concerned.\n\nExport earnings of the industry increased from $1.74 million in 1984 to $10.9 million in 1996, reflecting an annual growth rate of 30%. The table below shows the industry's historical export performance.\n\nIV. Industry Characteristics\n\nThe Philippine jewelry industry is a fragmented industry composed of around 10,000 cottage-type firms. Majority of manufacturers are small, 5 -10 - person operations with minimal investment in modern tools and equipment. Only a few dozen of these firms have more than 50 workers.\n\nOnly a few of the firms in the industry are corporations as majority are single proprietorship. Most of the large firms are family-owned. Foreign equity which is considered minimal comes mostly from USA, Italy, and Switzerland.\n\nMost jewelry manufacturing firms are located in Metro Manila, Bulacan, Davao, Cebu, Caraga Region, Benguet Province (Baguio).\n\nOnly the few firms who have invested in modern tools and equipment are exporting their products. Regular exporters number around 25.\n\nBoard of Investments (BOI) registered exporters account for around 505 of the exports. The leading exporter is Fralpa Manila (formerly Midasco), a Swiss-owned firm.\n\nA. Factor Characteristics\n\nRaw Materials\n\nGold is the major raw material used in the jewelry industry. Other materials used include silver and precious and semiprecious stones. Gold, silver and some semi-precious stones are locally available.\n\nThe Philippines has an abundant supply of gold as it is ranked number fourteen in the list of the world's top gold producers with an output of 28.4 tons in 1995. The country is also ranked as Asia's thrid largest gold producer. The gold production performance is expected to increase with the implementation of the Mining Act that allows firms with 100% capitalization to venture into mineral exploration.\n\nSources of gold for jewelry production include the Central Bank which sells 24 carat gold in grains and thin sheets with selling prices based on the daily LME price plus an estimated 2% to 3% processing fee. Gold is also available from local miners and/or small refiners, although quality of the material coming from these sources cannot be assured.\n\nSilver is common in Baguio while pearls are abundant in Southern Philippines. Precious stones are yet to be discovered in the Philippines while semi-precious stones such as jade and onyx are known to exist although sources are largely undeveloped due to lack of state of the art technology.\n\nWith these raw materials in the country, manufacturing of jewelry may be done without importation.\n\nEquipment and Technology\n\nThe technology utilized in the jewelry industry is generally labor-intensive since production is manual and volume requirements are low. Most tools are hand operated although a few local jewelers have already acquired casting machines wax injectors which characterize a higher volume of production.\n\nB. Regulations and other government interventions\n\nThe Philippine Export Development Plan prepared through the initiative of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) included fine jewelry among the original fourteen (14) export winners with the end view of harnessing the industry's full export potential.\n\nRepublic Act 8502 otherwise known as the Jewelry Industry Development Act of 1998 features tax and duty relief to jewelry manufacturing including importation of gemstones and raw materials components and equipment.\n\nIn line with the government's thrust to promote technology upgrading, metal working equipment were given zero tariff rates. Jewelry firms may also rent the modem equipment found in common service facilities for their own production.\n\nAmong the salient features of R.A. 8502 are the following:\n\nEntitlement to a zero duty on imported raw materials which include precious metals, loose gems, gemstones, jewelry parts, accessories and supplies;\n\nExemption from the imposition of excise tax;\n\nEntitlement to zero duty on imported capital equipment, including spare parts and tools;\n\nEntitlement to a deduction from taxable income equivalent to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of expenses incurred in training schemes;\n\nEntitlement to gold and silver sales by the Central Bank of the Philippines;\n\nAuthority to buy silver and gold directly from other sources without specific authority from the Central Bank of the Philippines. However, this shall not include sale of gold and silver from small-scale miners;\n\nInclusion of locally-manufactured products in the government's tourist duty free shops; and\n\nEligibility to other incentives provided for by other special laws such as:\n\nRepublic Act No. 7844 (Export Development Act of 1994)\n\nRepublic Act no. 7916 (Special Economic Zone Act of 1995);\n\nRepublic Act No. 7227 (Bases Conversion and Development Authority);\n\nExecutive Order 226 (BOI Omnibus Investment Code), among others.\n\nOther incentive packages are available to investors. Registration with the BOI entitles a firm to have an income tax holiday and partial duty exemption for equipment whose tariff rates have not been lowered to zero.\n\nC. Industry Association\n\nThere are three major association in the jewelry industry. These are Guild of Philippine Jewelers, the Philippine Association of Pearl Producers/Exporters, and the Meycauayan Jewelry Industry Association (MJIA).\n\nMJIA was established in 1985 and was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 20, 1986. From an original membership of 37, the association now has a membership of 106. MJIA was formed with the objective of playing a lead role in the development of the jewelry industry in Bulacan. To date, the MJIA has been an active partner of the government in the development of the industry. MJIA has its office on Meycauayan, Bulacan.\n\nMJIA is composed of the different exponents of the jewelry industry in Bulacan. It includes contractors, manufacturer, gold dealer, semiprecious precious stone dealer, corridoras and dealers of tools and equipment.\n\nD. Industry's competitive advantage\n\nAnother advantage is the support of the Philippine government to the industry. This support comes in the following forms:\n\nZero or low tariff rates on metal working equipment;\n\nProvision of funds for the establishment of training centers cum common service facilities;\n\nConduct of training programs by foreign consultants in key regional sites to upgrade the technology of the sector to international standards; and\n\nPassage of R.A. 8502 otherwise known as the Jewelry Industry Development act of 1998 which removes all taxes and duties presently levied on jewelry products and their raw materials to enable the local industry to get a firmer hold of the local market.\n\nThe Jewelry Industry in Bulacan: A Brief Situationer\n\nThere are about 2,000 registered and unregistered jewelry manufacturers in Bulacan mostly located in the municipality of Meycauayan which is considered as the center of fine jewelry production in the Philippines. Based on trends established in the Jewelry Industry Study for the province conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), 97% of the firms are single proprietorship. The oldest firm was established in 1957 while other firms were organized between 1968 and 1973. Almost all of the firms are Filipino-owned. More than half of the firms belong to the micro and cottage category.\n\nMarketing Aspect\n\nJewelry manufacturers in Bulacan produce every conceivable products provided that there were orders for them. Rings continue to top the list of products manufactured followed by earrings, necklace and ladies terno.\n\nPrice depends on the gold contents of the total weight of the item and the type of stone embedded in the piece.\n\nA variety of methods is used in selling jewelry products. Most manufacturers dispose their products using combinations of direct selling, sales outlet and agents. Most manufacturers do not promote their products formally. Among the firms that participated in the industry study, only 23% have their company brochure while a mere 30% have joined fairs and exhibits and fairs.\n\nAlmost all of Bulacan jewelry manufacturers dispose their products in the local market. Serving as market for the products are Metro Manila and the neighboring provinces.\n\nMarketing plans include establishing display outlets, increasing market linkages, lay away plan, participation in trade fairs, going into exporting and conducting quality study. Other marketing strategies utilized include selling on \"made to order\" basis, employing trusted agents, promotion through word of mouth, direct selling and after sales service and keeping trust.\n\nProduction Aspect\n\nMost of the jewelry firms are operating on job order basis. Jewelry manufacturers produce items that varies in type and design which explains the difference in monthly output of jewelry shops. Rings top the list of items being produced followed by bracelet, earrings, necklace, lady's terno, pendants, antique, bangles and tambourine. To accommodate rush orders, jewelry manufacturers subcontract job orders to other firms if existing capacity cannot handle such orders.\n\nA variety of machines and equipment are used in the production of various types of jewelry. For mass production of jewelry items, casting machines are utilized while basic hand tools are used in manufacturing personalized items.\n\nTraders of raw materials thrive in the Meycauayan area, the municipality being the center of fine jewelry production in the Philippines. Other sources of raw materials include Baguio, Davao and Hong Kong. Purchase of raw materials is done on cash and credit basis.\n\nFinancial Aspect\n\nThe monthly cash requirement of jewelry manufacturers depends on factors such as number of workers, existing job orders and fluctuations in the prices of raw materials. Monthly cash requirement may range from P10,000 to P 1,000,000.\n\nCost components\n\nRaw materials constitute the biggest cost in the manufacture of jewelry products (60-70%). The rest of the cost goes to labor and overhead.\n\nWorker Compensation and Training\n\nDifferent modes of compensation are utilized in the Bulacan jewelry industry. Office workers and marketing personnel are paid on a monthly basis with the latter getting commissions from time to time. Production workers such as goldsmiths are paid on a piece work basis. Other workers like those involved in buffing and plating are paid on daily basis.\n\nWorkers in the jewelry industry are not covered by employment contracts. As a result, no formal employee-employer relationship exists. According to the Bulacan Jewelry Industry Study, most of the workers treat their workers as members of the family. Non-monetary compensation provided to workers include medical support, food allowance, one cavan of rice every December and bonus equivalent to 10% of production.\n\nLess than half of jewelry manufacturers provide training to their workers. These training include proper customer relation, production efficiency, designing, quality consciousness and skill upgrading on polishing and plating. A number of reasons were cited behind the inability of firms to provide training to their employees: lack of time and funds for training, adequacy of worker skills during the time of hiring and the lack of interest of the workers themselves.\n\nStrengths\n\nOrganized and active industry association;\n\nGovernment-supported;\n\nNetwork of supporters (\"huge\") domestic and international;\n\nHas training center (common service facilities);\n\nMeycauayan is declared as industry cluster for fine jewelry by government;\n\nHas own industry plan not just of MJIA; it concerns whole industry;\n\nFine craftsmanship;\n\nAvailability of a large pool skilled and creative workers (Meycauayan);\n\nExistence of MMJ/MPCI services; and\n\nStrong/active local market promotion.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExport market potential;\n\nAccess to technology improvement Programs;\n\nPhil, is South East Asia's 3rd largest gold producer;\n\nPassage of the Jewelry Act of 1998 (RA 8502) still lacks DOF signing;\n\nMJIMPCI's plan to become a jewelry bank;\n\nAPEC funding for hallmarking and assaying facilities;\n\nGreen aid (Japan) to assist in pollution problem;\n\nAbundance of raw materials; and\n\nTie up with URC BSC major in Jewelry Technology (June 2000).\n\nFor Inquiries:\n\nMeycauayan Jewelry Industry Association, Inc.

It is said that the birthplace of fireworks in China. Legend has it that Chinese cook accidentally mixed 3 common ingredients: potassium nitrate, sulfur and charcoal and which he lighted the mixture, a mass of colorful flames-burst forth. The cook also noticed that if the mixture was burned when enclosed in the hollow of a bamboo stalk, there was a tremendous explosion.\n\nFrom China, fireworks moved on to the West through explorers. Stories have it that Marco Polo brought this new invention to the West from one of his many trips to China.\n\nThe first application of this technology was for entertainment. Slowly the theory took root. The loud sound was perfect for chasing away evil spirits and celebrating weddings, victories in battle or competition, eclipses and religious ceremonies. Movies that need explosion and bursting also use fireworks for the effect.\n\nHistory of Pyrotechnics in the Philippines\n\nIn the Philippines, the pyrotechnics industry had its roots in Bulacan. It was Valentin Sta. Ana who first learned the craft of making fireworks from the parish priest of Santa Maria Town in 1867, Spanish Regime. It was said that the parish priest used kwitis or stick rockets to wake up parishioners for the start of Misa de Gallo Only specialists were allowed to manufacture, use and handle fireworks, but the priest taught Valentin the basics of fireworks making until he mastered the craft.\n\nHe passed on his skill to his children, Valerio, and Fernando Sta. Ana. In 1938, the Sta. Ana brothers opened the Santa Ana Fireworks Factory in Balasing Santa Maria, Bulacan. By 1941, they moved further East to Pulong Buhangin. After the war, the company broke up, and Valerio's brother Fernando put up his own company, Victory Fireworks, which continue to manufacture fireworks to this day. Mr. Fernando Sta. Ana is the one considered as the country's Father of Modern Fireworks and Pyrotechnics (1938).\n\nEarly fireworks factory owned by the Sta. Anas includes Universal Fireworks. Their workers also learned the technology fireworks making that gave birth to the mushrooming of factories in Santa Maria, Bocaue, Baliuag, Norzagaray and Angat.\n\nFireworks factories in Cavite and Laguna were in fact, originated from Bulacan For some time in 1966, fireworks and its industry was legalized in response to a tragedy that happened in Meycauayan City, Bulacan that killed 26 people. It was in Pyrotechnic the hope that similar tragedies might be prevented through close supervision by the government that the industry was legalized.\n\nIn 1972 when Martial Law was enforced and fear of using the technology of fireworks in rebellious activities against Marcos government, the fireworks industry was again made illegal. The industry then thrived underground and the manufacture of fireworks declined.\n\nAfter seeing that Filipinos persisted in their use of fireworks for festivities and celebrations, the Republic Act 7183 - an act regulating the sale, distribution, and use of firecrackers and pyrotechnic devices and also known as Firecrackers Law was passed in 1992.\n\nBulacan is noted as a leading manufacturer of pyrotechnics in the Philippines. It is estimated that about 500 manufacturers are producing pyrotechnic products, particularly concentrated in the areas of Bocaue, Santa Maria, Baliuag, and other neighboring municipalities of the province. Some of them have already joined the Macau International Fireworks Display Competition.\n\nManufacturers and dealers grew rapidly in Bulacan relatively because of the high profits generated. It is important to note that the number of players in the industry varies with the season that usually dictates market conditions. Demand for pyrotechnics is closely related to the general economic health of the country. On average, May and December are peak months because of fiestas, Christmas, and New Year's Eve celebrations. It was observed that high economic growths result in higher demands for pyrotechnics during these months.\n\nTowns that Host Most of the Pyrotechnic Enterprises\n\nIt is Santa Maria that hosts most of the pyro-manufacturing factory but Bocaue became the center of trade due to its strategic location.\n\nBaliuag, San Rafael, San lldefonso, Norzagaray and Angat also host Pyrotechnic enterprises.\n\nProduct Lines\n\nAerial Fireworks - 3 to 12 inches in diameter shells good for occasions like New Year Celebrations, Fiestas, Weddings, Anniversaries, Jamborees, Coronations, Festivals\n\nBangers or firecrackers\n\nFountains, lucis or pailaw\n\nSky Rockets and parachutes\n\nWaterfalls\n\nMeasures have been taken by the Pyrotechnic Board to Address the Needs of the Industry\n\nConduct of the first Pyrotechnics Technology Improvement Seminar (6 days) for Manufacturers, Dealers, and Regulators. The Provincial Government of Bulacan (PGB) commissioned experts from Canada and America in June 1999 who introduced the safe technology of making fireworks.

Overview\n\nHistory of the Industry\n\nDuring the last century, travelers had already made reference to marble and stone in the Philippines Sir John Bowring in 1859 once commented: \"Finely variegated marbles exist in the province of Bulacan, and some have been used for ornamenting the churches but their existence has excited little attention.. . \". He also said: \" On the Quingua from Baliuag up to its stream, we passed several quarries where we saw the thickly packed strata of volcanic stone which is used as a building material.\"\n\nSpanish \"conquistadores\" utilized Romblon marble in churches for the altar, fonts, flooring and the like six holy-water fonts in San Sebastian Church, Manila bear an inscription showing their Romblon provenance. Philippine marble became synonymous with Romblon, at least for local uses. However, during the last century, stone architecture had not been fully developed in the Philippines.\n\nThe first impetus given to local marble exploitation was after World War II when memorial stones were required by the Rattle Monuments Commission This was followed hv the development of the Antipolo-Teresa deposits with its proximity to the main market, Manila and the establishment of the cement industry in Bulacan which led to the opening of the marble quarries in the area In the last decade, mineral exploration gained momentum and the presence of marble deposits were reported from a number of areas.\n\nMai hie was first exported in 1061 \\o Guam and Hong Kong. Presently, most of our marble exports arc in the form of worked marble, specifically marble slabs and tiles (polished, semi-polished or unpolished) The rest arc unworked marble in the form of blocks marble chips, dust or powder and marble novelties.\n\nProduct Description\n\nMarble is a metamorphosed limestone found in many localities in thick and extensive beds. It is a crystalline rock composed of grains of calcite, or more rarely, dolomite. It may be specifically described as a re-crystallized calcareous rock with a high or low degree of impurities Some deposits of marble are composed entirely of silica and silicate materials, iron oxide, and sulfide minerals and organic matter. The individual grains may be so small that they cannot be distinguished by the eye. or maybe coarse and show clearly the characteristic calcite cleavage Marble is generally tougher than most limestone as the grains of calcite in the latter are usually less firmly cemented Like limestone, marble is characterized by its softness and its effervescence with acids. When pure, marble is white in color but it may show a wide range of colors due to various impurities that it contains Iron oxide may impart colors of tan, red or brown. Carbonaceous matter causes a gray to black color\n\nSimply stated, marble is any calcareous rock produced by nature that is capable of taking a good polish Thus, commercial marble includes some limestone.\n\nProduct Classification\n\nThe Philippine marble stones are classified under the following categories:\n\nProduct Substitutes\n\nSeveral materials that have common uses similar to those of marble tiles and slabs include granolithic, vinyl, ceramic and cement tiles, mactan stones and the like and parquet.\n\nComparative prices of other construction materials vis-a-vis the marble tiles reveal that granolithic and ceramic tiles are more expensive than the commonly-bought marble varieties (Bulacan and Romblon marble). Parquet flooring and vinyl tiles meanwhile are valued at much lower prices than marble while cement tiles and mactan stones are sold at about the same rate as the ordinary marble. Generally speaking, marble, per se, can be less expensive than the other construction materials, However, the cost of installation makes it appear to be the most expensive\n\nPerhaps the real competitor of marble is marble itself Depending on variety, availability, and usage, one could easily substitute a certain marble type for another of a similar color.\n\nProduct Standards\n\nMarble is a product of nature and is not always subject to the standards of uniformity and consistency that apply to manufactured building materials.\n\nFor the selection of marble for a particular construction, two groups of properties are important: the functional and aesthetic qualities. The functional properties refer to the qualities of marble that determine its structural soundness. These properties include hardness, elasticity (in relation to the amount of pressure the marble could withstand without buckling) and porosity. Porosity becomes especially significant in damp climates because the absorption of water drives out the minerals in the stone and can be lead to unattractive discoloration.\n\nMarble Deposits\n\nA raw estimate of Philippine marble ore reserves indicates the presence of 6.7 Billion tons of marble and limestone deposit. Out of the 17 provinces where marble may be found, active quarry operations have mainly centered in Bulacan for the past 25 years. About 70% of marble blocks used as raw materials by industrial marble exporters all over the country arc sourced mainly in Bulacan, either from Meycauayan City, San lldefonso, San Rafael, Dona Remedios Trinidad, San Miguel, Norzagaray and San Jose del Monte City. These areas have been proven to be a good source of deposits with famous colors such as tea rose and the capistrano beige.\n\nA total number of 80 deposits were identified and inventoried under the geological survey component of the EC-sponsored project for the marble industry. The highest concentration of good deposits was found in Bulacan and Romblon.\n\nMarble Exports and Performance\n\nPhilippine marble export is classified as worked and unworked. The ratio of volume between these 2 categories is 4:1 in favor of unworked.\n\nWorked marble includes tiles, slabs, countertops, other special works and novelty items Unworked marble covers blocks, granules, and chips.\n\nThe industry showed a strong export growth in 1986-90 with an average rate of 24%. It registered negative growth from 1992 onwards with -12%, -8.21% and -1% respectively. These industry \"temporary\" setbacks were caused by the transition period of devolution of permits due to implementation of Local Government Code and the proclamation/declaration establishing the Biak-na Bato area as National Park and Mineral Reservation in April 1989.\n\nIn terms of volume, Philippine exports of marble grew by 37% from 56,618 MT in 1994 to 77,694 MT in 1995.\n\nII. Prospects Of The Industry\n\nIn 1993, the DTI has developed the Medium Term-Philippine Export Development Plan (MT-PEDP). The five-year plan contains detailed strategies for enhancing export growth. Through market diversification, further tariff liberalization, improved infrastructure, product development, and stable macroeconomic policies, the Government intends to achieve export growth rates of more than 18% annually in this period.\n\nUnder this plan, fourteen \"export winners\" were chosen from among 154 promotable products on the basis of these criteria: high worldwide potential, less sensitivity to protectionist measures of importing countries and minimum requirements for efficient infrastructure, production capability and high skilled labor.\n\nMarble has been identified as one of the 14 export winners. As such, it is expected to contribute significantly to achieving the country's target of US $ 28B by 1998, to account for 30.4% of GNP.\n\nTo realize this goal, the government has paved the way toward a conducive export environment by providing integrated support mechanisms that will address major concerns of the industry. This support mechanism should help fast-track and sustain export growth and enable the export winners, such as Marble, to achieve specific targets Assistance is provided to high growth potential export products that have shown sustained growth. The marble industry's target by 1998 is US $ 80M, growing at a projected rate of 50% per annum.\n\nThe prospects for the marble industry had always been bright and rosy. Philippine share in world market is projected to increase from 1% in 1992 to 4.5% in 1998 and export earnings from US$10M in 1992 to US$ 150 M by 1998.\n\nTotal production is expected to increase from 300,000MT in 1993 to 450,000 MT in 1998 or 50% increase.\n\nCompetitive Advantage\n\nQuality and color of marble\n\nFinish\n\nThe hardness of the stone\n\nFor more information about the industry, please contact the following:\n\nConcerned Provincial Government Office\n\nProvincial Cooperative and Economic Development Office (PCEDO)\n\nBulacan Trade and Business Assistance Center\n\nProvincial Capitol Compound, Guinhawa\n\nCity of Malolos, Bulacan 3000 Philippines\n\nAtty.
