        "text": "During the Philippine-American war, Col. Jon Stotsenburg was one of the American officials and he was killed on 23rd of April in year 1899 in the course of the Battle of Quingua.\n\nThe Battle of Quingua happened in Agnaya, Plaridel formerly known as Ugnayan , Quingua. The engagement was a two-part battle that started Elwell S. Otis' Bulacan and Pampanga offensive a day early.\n\nAnd it was also one of the biggest monumental battles that can beseen in the Philippine diorama. “Di lang talaga siya siguro napapansin.” Mr. Vince Plaridel Tourism Head said in an interview.\n\nMany Filipinos died that time, and 2 of them was Juan Evangelista who was 17 years old and volunteer Pablo Mariquiz, but sill they killed Col. John Stotsenburg before they died with honor for their country.\n\nThat’s why the American government decided to build and locate the Stotsenburg’s monument in Agnaya, Plaridel in the place where he was killed. And this monument became one of the tourist spot in Plaridel, Bulacan.\n\n“Wala lang siguro sa conscious mind natin na puntod pala ng amerikano yung nanadun.” Mr. Vince said.\n\nAnd according to him, it is now their initiative, because of having some visitors coming from different learning cities, like from Korea, Vietnam, Laos and even from Canada, especially now that Plaridel was known to be study area of students from different country .\n\n“That’s why ipinatayo natin yung mural, para marecognize the Filipinos na nakapatay kay Col. Stotsenburg.” Vince said.\n\nAnd they made a mural behind the monument, showing how great Filipinos are, who fought for their freedom.\n\n--“Ang pag-dakila at pag paparangal sa mga Pilipinong nakipaglaban at nakpatay kay Coronel John Stotsenburg ay nag papaalala sa atin na tayong mga Pilipino ay patuly na maninindigan at tumitindig para sa ating kalyaan.”\n\n“I want something different, standout, something that you as a Bulakenyos would be proud of.” Joe Clemente, the Ciudad Clemente Resort owner said in an interview on January 13, 2014.\n\nClemente described his place in one word as ‘fantastic’ one. He said that everyone who sees his place says it is really fantastic.\n\nThe Ciudad Clemente Resort was then an ancestral house built for almost 75 years and continuously developed and the other part of it was restored based on the original design.\n\nMost of the rooms in his resort were made of original knickknacks from different ancestral houses, like mahogany, molave and narra and even the gathering of materials was certainly planned. “It’s a matter of choosing the right wood, the right decors and depende sa kung ano yung gagawin mo, kumbaga it runs from your blood.”He even said that if you have the love you have the foresight to see that.\n\nHe said that he made the restoration of that ancestral house because he wants it to be a reposition of arts and cultures.\n\n“Every now and then nagbabago ang desighn pero sa ngayon sabihin nila greenhouse yung mga green architecture pero after that it depends kung ano yung papatok sa panglasa ng mamayan.” Clemente said.\n\nBut still the people will be the one to distinguish if wha king of fashion for their house would be for the 20th century onwards, because we all know that we have our own different types of approach in terms of fashion.\n\nIn added to the restoration of his resort he also put a museum in some rooms in the resort. Where youca see a collection of famous Bulakanyo artist even seniors and also the award winners and “It is something na you as a Bulakanyos would be proud of.” Clemente ended.\n\n\"Para may mapanuod yung mga studyante ng BSU\", Joel Dela Cruz said in an interview, explaining why did he did this kind of activity held at the parking lot of the CIT building.\n\nHe said that it was his first time to organize an exhibit like this. because in his four years in IT he never saw any actin=vity like this, so he take this as an opportunity to do that.\n\nAnd this exhibt was joined by 13 car owner and five of them were all BSU students. And he said that he gathered all the car owner through facebook.\n\nAnd as a prize or giveaways for everyone who joined the exhibit, he gave a certificates and freebies.\n\nAnd as a result, this exhibit will be repeated at their college week.\n\n\"To light and to serve as the light of the University and at the same time we try to see to see the light dun sa pasko.\", the CSSP dean said in a statement, explaining why 'parol and pasko' was their choice to baethe theme of their activity held at the Valencia Hall of BSU.\n\n\"Parang gagawa ka ng ilaw, susunduin mo si kristo kasi sya yung nagcreate at hinahahamon ka nya kaya tumutugon ka through creativity\" Mr. Marwin dela cruz said\n\nThis contest was activity done by the Local Student Council and their college just support it. And Mr. dela cruz said that he doesn't want to take the credit from them, because that was theirs and also for their college.\n\nAnd they try to see to it that students will have full of activities to do. And according to him their college has 16-20 activities for the year.\n\nRunning naked with the theme of; Sino nakinabang sa nawawalng buwis ng bayan, the members of APO addresses their own feeling and the issue that they like to share with others, at the BSU on December 4, 2013.\n\nThey chose to run naked, because for them it was more catchy.\n\n\"So alam naman nationg aware tayong lahat na tinamaan tayo ng bagyo, lindol, nakikisimpatya tayo sakanila at tumutulong din tayo sa maliliiit nating paraan\" Jay Ron Paul Sanchez, the grand chancelor of APO said in a statement.\n\nBut he explaned that we still have to remember and do not forget the issue about the PDAF, and he added that \"Gusto natin magkaroon ng konting pasundot sa mga audience na wag nilang kalimutan yung issue about sa PDAF.\" Sanchez ended,"
