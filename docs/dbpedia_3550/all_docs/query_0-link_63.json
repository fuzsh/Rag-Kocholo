        "text": "SANDIGANG KASASAYAYAN:\n\nApo Gusting: Tanglaw at Gabay tungo sa Pagbabagong-buhay\n\nIntroduction\n\nA joyous event was held on February 13, 2024 because our beloved Bishop Dennis C. Villarojo, DD formally announced and presented the Diocesan Shrine of St. Augustine in the City of Baliuag.\n\nCome and let’s revisit the colorful history of San Agustin Parish and the deep faith and devotion of the Baliuageños to their patron saint, Apo Gusting.\n\nAccording to the old records of the said parish, the town of Baliuag was established on May 26, 1733 which was separated from the towns of Angat and Quingua (now Plaridel). Father Juan de Albarran was the first pastor of the Parish. It can be inferred from this that Baliuag was previously visited by Quingua and Paco which are covered by Bayan ng Angat.\n\nOne year later, at the meeting of the Augustinians on May 15, 1734 Baliuag was formally made and recognized as a Vicariato / Pueblo where Father Manuel Baceta was appointed Prior/Vicar. It is not surprising that the chosen patron of Baliwag is San Agustin because in the town from which it was drawn, the one who is being worshiped is his mother, Santa Monica.\n\nOne of the important documents kept is the census in the year 1732. According to it, Baliwag has a population of 1,189 which is enough to form a Parish. But if you check the census books made by the Augustinian priests, the census began in the year 1729. So we can say that in 1729 the formation of a new Reduccion that was divided from the town of Angat began and Quingua. It is also clearly stated in the First Book of Baptism in the Parish that the record of previous baptisms before the year 1733 can be found in the two towns where it originated.\n\nAccording to Rolando Villacorte, in his book Baliwag: Then and Now, the small Ermita de Santa Barbara in Barrio Balanti (now Barangay Santa Barbara) served as a small church and shelter for the first Augustinian missionaries. This is probably where the sacraments were first held while the larger prayer house was being built in the Poblacion being built.\n\nChurch of Wood and Thatch: The First Church\n\nThe first Church of San Agustin made of wood and stone may have been started to be built between 1733-1734.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Church of San Agustin is not far from the architecture and structure of Augustinian Churches: it usually faces a lake, river, or sea. Some of the famous Churches in this location are the Basilica of San Martin de Tours, in Taal, Batangas; the Cathedral of San Andres in Parañaque City, and the Basilica of Señor Santo Niño in Cebu City.\n\nThis is because the bodies of water were the best route for the missionaries to different parts of their territory. It also serves as transportation to bring goods or materials to be used in the construction of buildings.\n\nRock Church: The Second Church\n\nMeanwhile, Padre Gregorio Giner established the first stone church from 1769 to 1773. During these times, the church of Santa Monica in Angat was also established through Padre Gener. The Angat Stone Church was started to be built for fifteen years from 1758-1773. During his tenure Father Fausto Lopez repaired and beautified the bell tower and facade of the church that were damaged during the strong earthquake that lasted 30 seconds (7.4 magnitude) on June 3, 1863.\n\nBetween the years 1863-1877 the ruins of the second Church were repaired. Because of its unique architecture and perhaps one of the newest structures completed that year, an engraving featuring the church’s facade and the Plaza was published in El Oriente magazine on August 26, 1877.\n\nEarthquake of 1880: The Third Church\n\nBaliwag was not spared from the severe earthquake of July 20, 1880. This caused severe damage to several parts of the convent, especially the bell tower where the fourth floor was damaged. The fachada with its baroque design collapsed and had to be rebuilt. Padre Tomas Gresa is recognized as the leader in the revival and inauguration of the new Church. The right and left sides (transepts) were added to follow the Cross Shape that remembers the salvation of Jesus on the Cross.\n\nThe Third Church is planned to have an altarpiece designed in Barcelona, ​​Spain. La Illustracion Espanola y Americana, a cultural magazine in Madrid, published a silver Tabernacle that was also customized in Barcelona.\n\nIt can no longer be determined if the built Shrine reached Baliwag, but the design of the altar was never started due to the departure of the Spanish in 1898.\n\nPhilippine American War\n\nDuring the Philippine-American War, the Church was turned into a garrison and hospital by the American army led by General Henry Lawton. Although a garrison and a hospital were serving, it was not an obstacle to continue the worship of the believers every day of the week. Due to the departure of the Augustinian Priests, this is also the time of transition to Filipino Secular Priests.\n\nPeace Time – Post World War\n\nBaliwag was fortunate and was not destroyed by the second World War. Most of the Archival documents were not obtained by the OSA, so they remained in the Church. However, many old Church items were lost after the Second World War such as Chandeliers, Stations of the Cross and some Mass items are not known to be intact today. May 1951, six years after the Second World War, the town of Baliuag once again celebrated the Town Festival under the leadership of Parish Priest Ruperto Del Rosario. This is perhaps a thanksgiving for the end of the dark ages.\n\nEvery festival that the townspeople were excited about became colorful. Even the believers from the countryside do not miss the Novena Masses of Apo Gusting as their gratitude for the good harvest, good health and the miracles they have achieved. Due to intense devotion to Apo Gusting, a large image of San Agustin was placed on the pediment (1966) of the church by Bishop Amado Paulino, then the Parish Priest of Baliuag, who seems to be in the highest part of the town, observing and knowingly watching over and assures that the people are full of God’s blessing.\n\nDuring the tenure of Bishop Leopoldo Arcaira (1969-1987), the popular piety was further enriched when he printed the Novena in Honor of San Agustin, which continues to be used even in other churches in the country. A native of Tanza, Cavite, there is no denying that Bishop Arcaira’s devotion to Apo Gusting, known to them as Tata Usteng, is close to his heart.\n\nMons. Feliciano Palma (1987 – 2001) emphasized that devotion to Apo Gusting must be accompanied by acts of piety. He had the Parish Pastoral Center and Multi-Purpose Hall built where each church organization had a space for their activities and meetings. He also revived the Saint Augustine Charity Clinic. Mons. Enrico Santos (2001-2013) continued and further enriched the charities. These are currently ongoing – Bata Kalinga, Christian Brotherhood, Alay ng Layko sa Bayan (ALAYB), Saklolo and Saklola even the Scholarship Program.\n\nNew Millennium – Current Times\n\nLed by Mons. Andres S. Valera, the original design of the altarpieces was restored. It was blessed during the Patron Festival 2016 as a special offering by Sir Knight Jorge Allan R. Tengco who has a special devotion and love for San Agustin.\n\nThe communion rails were also re-attached in 2020. In order for believers to better know the life of Apo Gusting and the Augustinian Saints, the Augustinian Procession is held every August. The Virgin of Consolacion is also worshiped in the Retablo Menor. The Major Relic of San Agustin will also visit our Parish in 2018.\n\nThis was wholeheartedly accepted by the Baliuagenos and considered a rare blessing. The said relic is a large part of Apo Gusting’s bone. Four years later, the Order of the Augustinians Discalced granted a rare grace to enshrine a relic of Saint Augustine as a gift for Baliwag. The said project is led by the Tengco Family who contacted and begged the Order for this blessing.\n\nThe current Parish Priest and now the first Rector of the Shrine, Rev. Fr. Narciso S. Sampana with Rev. Fr. Prince Lenrick Marcelo. On November 13, 2022, the Cofradia de San Agustin was established to further intensify the devotion to Apo Gusting under the guidance of Rev. Fr. Virgilio Cruz. There was a Lakbay-Kabalanan in every Vicariate of the Diocese, International Shrine of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage-Antipolo, National Shrine of Padre Pio – Batangas, and San Agustin Church-Intramuros.\n\nThe purpose of every pilgrimage is to better know the devotion to San Agustin in his Shrine in Baliuag. The National Historical Commission of the Philippines also recognized the Parish’s important contribution to the History and Culture of the Country, so the Historical Monument was inaugurated on August 28, 2023.\n\nBased on the Vocabulario Lengua Tagala (1800), the word Baliuag means “deep”. Perhaps the Lord chose this name for this town because of the deep faith in God that can be traced in the holy works and charities preached by San Agustin, Apo Gusting who is the guide and torch towards regeneration.\n\nWhether it’s a father or an old man in the town of Baliwag, there is definitely San Agustin watching.\n\nWritten by: Bro.
