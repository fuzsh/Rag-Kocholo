Gregorio del Pilar on April 25, 1899. The bridge commemorates the bravery displayed by the Filipinos as they victor in the battle against the American forces.\n\nThe Battle of Calumpit, alternately known as the Battles of Bagbag and Pampanga Rivers, was fought from April 25–27, 1899, in Calumpit, Bulacan, during the Philippine-American War. Taking place after the Battle of Quingua, the fighting around Calumpit saw US forces under General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. once again face General Antonio Luna‘s main force, with whom they had clashed during the fall of Malolos on March 31, 1899."
