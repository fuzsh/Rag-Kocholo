        "text": "​Plaridel is one of the well known town in bulacan. Because of its old name quingua that is now named as Plaridel, it came from the name of a popular hero here in bulacan, marcelo del pilar. It is also the place where the battle of quingua happened.\n\nBattle of quingua, one battle that really made the town of paridel a popular one. It is a battle between the americans which is governed/commanded by Pablo Tecson of San miguel, bulacan. As we, plarideleños can see in barangay of Agnaya, the walls of it has the carvings showing the happenings in the battle of quingua. The st.james was built by augustinian friars of malolos and named as “encomiendo binto”. Jose j. Mariano is the former mayor of the town of plaridel, he has a friend named congressman pedro magsalin, who sponsored the bill to change the name of the town quingua to plaridel. The bill was passed by the phil congress and approved by pres. Manuel quezon. On dec. 29, 1936, the town was renamed as Plaridel in honor of the great hero of bulacan, marcelo del pilar. The town of plaridel was composed of 19 barangay it includes agnaya, bagongsilang, banga I, banga II, culianin, sanjose, parulan, dampol, lagundi, lalangan, sta. Ines, sto. Nino, sipat, tabang, poblacion, rueda, bulihan and lumang bayan. The parish church of santiago apostol was used to have a shooting for certain tv shows like darna, zaido, iglot, nita negrita, broken vow and others. The most awaited event in town of plaridel during the feast is the Salubong Festival or horse festival celebrated annually every december 29. It is called as salubong because plarideleños are welcoming the st. James greatest equestrians replica from sipat. It is also called the horse festival because people are letting the calesas have a parade along the road of plaridel.\n\nThe history of plaridel is really a great one to treasure. There are many life events that already happened in this town not only the most popular Battle of quingua but many more. We plarideleños should have the knowledge and know about the history of our own town, plaridel, to let other people know that we are treasuring every memorable happenings that has happened in our town."
