        "text": "During the Philippine-American war, Col. Jon Stotsenburg was one of the American officials and he was killed on 23rd of April in year 1899 in the course of the Battle of Quingua.\n\nThe Battle of Quingua happened in Agnaya, Plaridel formerly known as Ugnayan , Quingua. The engagement was a two-part battle that started Elwell S. Otis' Bulacan and Pampanga offensive a day early.\n\nAnd it was also one of the biggest monumental battles that can beseen in the Philippine diorama. “Di lang talaga siya siguro napapansin.” Mr. Vince Plaridel Tourism Head said in an interview.\n\nMany Filipinos died that time, and 2 of them was Juan Evangelista who was 17 years old and volunteer Pablo Mariquiz, but sill they killed Col. John Stotsenburg before they died with honor for their country.\n\nThat’s why the American government decided to build and locate the Stotsenburg’s monument in Agnaya, Plaridel in the place where he was killed. And this monument became one of the tourist spot in Plaridel, Bulacan.\n\n“Wala lang siguro sa conscious mind natin na puntod pala ng amerikano yung nanadun.” Mr. Vince said.\n\nAnd according to him, it is now their initiative, because of having some visitors coming from different learning cities, like from Korea, Vietnam, Laos and even from Canada, especially now that Plaridel was known to be study area of students from different country .\n\n“That’s why ipinatayo natin yung mural, para marecognize the Filipinos na nakapatay kay Col. Stotsenburg.” Vince said.\n\nAnd they made a mural behind the monument, showing how great Filipinos are, who fought for their freedom.\n\n--“Ang pag-dakila at pag paparangal sa mga Pilipinong nakipaglaban at nakpatay kay Coronel John Stotsenburg ay nag papaalala sa atin na tayong mga Pilipino ay patuly na maninindigan at tumitindig para sa ating kalyaan.”"
