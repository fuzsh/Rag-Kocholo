Truly a melting pot of the past and the present, the old and the new, the countryside and the urban. Bulacan is noted as the land of heroes, beautiful women, progressive cooperatives, and small and medium-scale industries. It is also known for excellent craftsmanship in making jewelry, leather craft, buntal hats, pyrotechnics, bone in-laid furniture and garments. Bulacan also has emerged into a reputable resort haven of Luzon. Just a few minutes north of Manila by car, Bulacan resorts provide an accessible and welcome respite from the pressures of city life.",
