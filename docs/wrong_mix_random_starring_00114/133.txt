NEW YORK — Kanye West says he has nothing but respect for Beck. The Grammys? Not so much.

West paid a visit on Ryan Seacrest and his “On Air” radio show Wednesday to expound on his post-Grammy diss of the surprise Album of the Year winner.

The rapper walked up the steps at the Staples Center in Los Angeles as Beck was accepting his award Sunday night but retreated before re-enacting his interruption of Taylor Swift at the 2009 VMAs. During an aftershow on E!, West ranted that Beck should “respect artistry” and turn over his statue to fellow nominee Beyoncé.

West told Seacrest of his stair-climbing antics: “It was kind of a joke like the Grammys themselves.”

And the post-show tirade?

“This is our Super Bowl, you know, and someone’s gotta be mad that Marshawn didn’t get the ball,” he said. Marshawn being Beyoncé in this scenario but Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch in actual life.

As for “respecting artistry,” West explained he was upset that Beck didn’t mention other nominees as worthy in the category during his speech.

Melissa Rivers writing a book about her mother

NEW YORK — Melissa Rivers has found a way to work through her grief for her mother, sparring partner and closest friend, Joan Rivers.

She’s written a memoir. Crown Archetype announced Wednesday that “The Book of Joan: Tales of Mirth, Mischief, and Manipulation” will come out May 5. According to Crown, an imprint of Penguin Random House, the book will feature jokes, stories and advice. Melissa Rivers said in a statement issued through Crown that laughter had “less side effects than Prozac” and was “a lot cheaper than therapy.” She also said that she had written a book she hoped would make her mother laugh.

Joan Rivers died last September after she went into cardiac and respiratory arrest during a throat procedure.
