Kanye West was presented with the Video Vanguard award by Taylor Swift at Sunday night’s MTV Video Music Awards.

The award marked the rapper’s music video output over the course of his career. Accepting the accolade, West thanked Swift for “being so gracious” and presenting him with the award. Both Kanye and Taylor made reference to their infamous falling out at the 2009 VMAs. “I’mma let you finish, but Kanye West has had one of the greatest careers of all time,” Swift joked.

During his 13 minute-long acceptance speech, West discussed his bewilderment with award shows: “I still don’t understand award shows. I don’t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sell records, sell concert tickets, to come, stand on a carpet and for the first time in their life, be judged on the chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser.”

He continued: “I don’t know what I finna lose after this. It don’t matter, though; It’s not about me. It’s about ideas. New ideas. People with ideas. People who believe in truth. And yes, as you probably could’ve guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020 to run for president.”
