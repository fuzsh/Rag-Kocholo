        "text": "Kanye West announced he was running for president in 2020 during the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday.\n\nThe bold declaration came at the end of an epic acceptance speech for a lifetime achievement award.\n\nTaylor Swift honored the star with a gushing introduction that was a nod to their first encounter, in which the 38-year-old famously rushed the stage when Taylor Swift accepted an award back in 2009, claiming that his friend Beyonce was a more worthy recipient.\n\nTo wrap up his speech on Sunday, Kanye simply said: 'As you probably could’ve guessed by this moment, I have decided, in 2020, to run for president.'\n\nHe had, however, announced earlier in the epic speech that he had smoked a joint before heading up on stage.\n\n‘Y'all might be thinking right now, “I wonder did he smoke something before he came out here?” And the answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off,’ he said.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHe added: ‘I don't know what's gonna happen tonight what's gonna happen tomorrow bro but all I can say to my artists is just worry about how you feel at the time.’\n\nKanye’s lengthy monologue jumped swiftly from topic to topic, from Justin Timberlake’s FutureSex/LoveSounds and award shows to discussing fresh juice at the market and the future of millennials.\n\nKanye's announcement that he would run for president comes almost ten years to the day that he attacked President George Bush on national television during a live segment.\n\nOn September 2, 2005, Kanye and Mike Meyers appeared at a telethon benefit for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and almost immediately Kanye appeared to go off script.\n\n'I hate the way they portray us in the media,' said Kanye.\n\n'If you see a black family, it says, \"They're looting.” You see a white family, it says, \"They're looking for food.\" And you know that it's been five days because most of the people are black.'\n\nMeyers took over soon after that, but when he went to take a breath at one point, Kanye said; 'George Bush doesn’t care about black people.'\n\nHe then walked off stage.\n\nPresident Bush later called the comment 'one of the most disgusting moments' of his presidency, while many others came to agree with what Kanye said, especially when little was done in New Orleans in the weeks, months and even years following Katrina.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with Today, West said; \"I would tell George Bush in my moment of frustration, I didn't have the grounds to call him a racist. I believe that in a situation of high emotion like that we as human beings don't always choose the right words.'\n\nKanye came under fire again in 2013 for comments he made about President Obama and Jewish people.\n\nWhen asked how he felt President Obama was doing in office during a radio interview he said; 'Man, let me tell you something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing.\n\n'That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that.'\n\nThat comment was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League, who said; 'There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government.'\n\nAnd while he was acknowledged with the Video Vanguard Award at this year's Video Music Awards, his previous antics at the star-studded ceremony certainly loomed large in everyone's minds.\n\nThe prize has previously been won by acts including Michael and Janet Jackson, Britney Spears, U2 and George Michael, with it last being presented to Beyonce in 2014.\n\nThe All Day rapper is familiar with the award, having given it to his friend and long-time collaborator Hype Williams in 2006 for his achievements as a 'film maker'.\n\nKanye, father to two-year-old daughter North, has been making music videos since 2003 beginning with his first single, Through The Wire.\n\nSince then he has worked on several iconic music videos including 2004's All Falls Down, 2005's Gold Digger featuring Jamie Foxx, 2007 Daft Punk collaboration Stronger, 2011's All Of The Lights featuring Rihanna and the infamous 2013 Bound 2 video starring his wife Kim Kardashian.\n\nKanye last performed at the VMAs in 2013 when he played single Blood on the Leaves.\n\nRegardless of how much history Kanye has made at the award show, his best known appearance was when he interrupted Taylor at the event six years ago while she accepted the Best Female Video Award to insist Beyonce should have won the accolade.\n\nRushing the stage, Kanye took the microphone from the blonde singer and infamously said: 'Yo Taylor, I’m really happy for you, Imma let you finish but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time…one of the best videos of all time!'\n\nThe rapper was then subsequently booed off the stage by the audience in attendance.\n\nKanye and the 25-year-old singer have since put their differences aside and were even pictured together at the Grammy Awards back in February.\n\nBut just before hitting the stage at the VMAs on Sunday, Kanye showed his lighter side as he was spotted by fans pretending to nap on Kim's arm during Taylor's speech, introducing his Vanguard Award.\n\nKanye spoke about that moment in his speech, and how being a father has changed his behavior.\n\n'First of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award this evening, thank you. And I often think back to the first day I met you also,' said Kanye.\n\n'I think about when I'm in the grocery store with my daughter and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice, and at the end they say oh you're not that bad after all.\n\n'It crosses my mind a little bit when I go to a baseball game and 60,000 people boo me, it crosses my mind a little bit. And I think If I had to do it all again what would I have done?\n\n'Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of hennessey and given the rest to the audience? Yall know yall drank that bottle too.\n\n'If I had a daughter at that stage would I have went on stage and grabbed the mic from someone else’s.\n\n'You know, this arena tomorrow, its going to be a completely different set up, some concert, something like that. That stage was gone, but the effect had on people remained.'\n\nThe Style hitmaker recently revealed to Vanity Fair that it was Kanye's 'Big Brother' Jay-Z who insisted that the two superstars start afresh.\n\nSpeaking about the situation in the new issue of Vanity Fair magazine, she said: 'I feel like I wasn't ready to be friends with (Kanye) until I felt like he had some sort of respect for me, and he wasn't ready to be friends with me until he had some sort of respect for me - so it was the same issue, and we both reached the same place at the same time.\n\n'I became friends with Jay Z, and I think it was important, for Jay Z, for Kanye and I to get along ... And then Kanye and I both reached a place where he would say really nice things about my music and what I've accomplished, and I could ask him how his kid's doing.'\n\nKanye also took some time to talk about awards in his speech on Sunday, saying; 'I still don’t understand awards shows. I don’t understand how they get five people who worked their entire life, one sold records, sold concert tickets, to stand on a carpet, and for the first time in their life to be judged on a chopping block, and have the opportunity to be considered a loser!'\n\nHe then went on to point out how upset he was to see Justin Timberlake and CeeLo lose Grammy Awards over the course of their careers."
