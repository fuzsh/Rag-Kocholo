        "text": "Just as the nominees for the big four categories at the upcoming 2022 Grammys were revealed in late November, the CEO of the Recording Academy shocked everybody tuning in by admitting that for the first time ever, there would be 10 possible winners in the most competitive fields—Album, Record and Song of the Year, as well as Best New Artist. The 10 efforts that ended up being nominated for Album of the Year included a large number of commercial successes, as well as a handful of less massive, but no less beautiful, works of art.\n\nBecause of a rule change that benefited producers, featured artists and songwriters, some very lucky stars are actually competing against themselves for the honor, which remains a rare sight. Kanye West is one such musician, as he earned two Album of the Year nominations at the sixty-fourth ceremony, with his work as a star and a producer recognized by the Recording Academy. With a pair of new nods, West now counts 10 total nominations in the Album of the Year field, an incredible accomplishment, despite the fact that he hasn’t won yet.\n\nWest’s album Donda is up for Album of the Year, and it marks the fourth time one of his own full-lengths competed for the trophy. He is also included in the running as a credited producer and songwriter on Lil Nas X’s Montero, as he worked on the single “Industry Baby,” which became a huge hit for the main musician and featured rapper Jack Harlow.\n\nForbesChris Brown, DaBaby And Taylor Swift: Artists Competing Against Themselves For The Album Of The Year Grammy\n\nWith 10 titles vying for the Album of the Year, the race is more competitive than ever before, but does West have a real shot at winning the category he’s worked so hard to dominate? At the moment, Donda doesn’t appear to be a frontrunner. In fact, a New York Times NYT report suggests that the latest full-length from the rapper almost wasn’t nominated at all. A last-minute decision to expand the field from eight to 10 nominees allowed for Donda and Taylor Swift’s Evermore to sneak in. That suggests that voters aren’t rushing to give the hitmaker the win for this specific title.\n\nIt seems like West’s best shot at finally taking home Album of the Year at the Grammys is with Montero. The first full-length and second release from Lil Nas X was met with widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike, and it performed well on all Billboard charts. The rapper produced the No. 1 smash “Industry Baby,” which is also nominated for a separate award, though West isn’t included in that category. Montero may have a difficult time competing against releases by Billie Eilish (Happier Than Ever), Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga (Love For Sale) and Olivia Rodrigo (Sour), but it is certainly in the conversation.\n\nIn the past, West has been nominated for his own albums Graduation, Late Registration and The College Dropout, and now he can add Donda to that list. As a producer and songwriter, he has also competed for the trophy on all of the following releases: Drake’s Views, The Weeknd’s Beauty Behind The Madness, Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter III, Mariah Carey’s The Emancipation Of Mimi and Alicia Keys’ The Diary Of Alicia Keys.\n\n2022 might not be West’s year to win Album of the Year at the Grammys, but the fact that he was included twice is important. After several years away from the top categories at music’s biggest night, the rapper is back in a major way, and his nods show that he is still creating the kind of work that voters love, and that they deeply respect him. If he doesn’t snag the trophy this year, he could be back to compete again soon."
