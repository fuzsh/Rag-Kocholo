        "text": "The bad blood between Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian appears to live on well into the pop star's 11th studio album, “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.”\n\nWhen the album was released on April 19, Swifties quickly dissected the lyrics on the extended LP, which included a total of 31 songs.\n\nTwo songs, “thanK you aIMee” and “Cassandra,” appeared to reference the long-standing feud surrounding Kardashian, Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, and Swift, adding more chapters to the cataclysmic saga involving the three of them.\n\nTo recap, issues between the trio started in 2009 when Ye interrupted Swift on stage at the MTV Video Music Awards. The two briefly mended fences, but in 2016, he released a song called “Famous” that had a vulgar lyric about Swift. The pop star's team said that Ye \"did not call for approval,\" E! News reported at the time.\n\nKardashian, who was Ye's wife at the time, became involved in the drama when she claimed the pop star knew about the song ahead of time by releasing a video recording of Ye allegedly talking to Swift on the phone about the song. Since then, Swift has penned multiple songs reflecting on the fallout between them and the backlash she received for being painted as a liar.\n\nSo when Swift announced her secret double album, fans immediately noticed the unique stylizing of the song \"thanK you aIMee,\" which spells \"KIM\" in capitalized letters. But nothing could have prepared them for the scathing lyrics, written by Swift and frequent collaborator and producer Aaron Dessner, that suggest how the musician feels about the situation now.\n\nSwift begins \"thanK you aIMee\" by telling her foe that she imagines there is a \"bronze, spray-tanned statue of you/ and a plaque underneath it that threatens to push me down the stairs at our school.\"\n\nSwift reveals in the chorus that she has no intentions of forgiving \"aIMee.\" Instead, she sings, \"Screamed, 'F--- you, Aimee' to the night sky as the blood was gushin’/ But I can’t forget the way you made me heal.\"\n\nThe Grammy-winner then references her mom, Andrea Swift, in one of the song's most startling lines. She says, \"Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman/ But she used to say she wished that you were dead.\"\n\nMany fans found the most compelling clues that indicate the song is about Kardashian in the third verse. \"I don’t think you’ve changed much/ And so I changed your name and any real defining clues/ And one day, your kid comes home singin’/ A song that only us two is gonna know is about you,\" Swift says.\n\nBillboard reported in January 2023 that Kardashian shared a video on her joint TikTok with oldest daughter North West of the duo singing along to Swift's \"Shake It Off.\" The clip has since been deleted.\n\nThe references to Kardashian and Ye are slightly more subtle in \"Cassandra.\"\n\nSwift recalls in the opening verse the day she was walking in her house and \"got the call,\" seemingly referring to Ye phoning her to discuss the \"Famous\" lyrics.\n\nSwift likens the public reaction to her seemingly supporting the controversial lyrics to getting stones thrown at her and hearing cries to \"burn the b----.\"\n\n\"When the truth comes out, it’s quiet,\" she said, which could refer to the full audio from the phone call later being released.\n\n\"So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say/ Do you believe me now?\" she asks in the chorus. Kardashian previously used a snake emoji to refer to Swift on Instagram and the singer turned it into a symbol of her rebirth during her \"Reputation\" era.\n\nIn the bridge, Swift says, \"They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time/ That I was onto somethin’/ The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line/ They all said nothin’/ Blood’s thick, but nothin’ like a payroll/ Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul/ You can mark my words that I said it first.\"\n\nFans think the \"family\" Swift alludes to could be the wider Kardashian family and how they feel about Ye following his divorce from Kardashian in November 2022.\n\nTODAY.com reached out to Kardashian and Ye for comment on the songs but did not hear back.\n\nIf you need a refresher on everything that has happened to lead to these two biting tracks, read on for a timeline of the key moments in their feud.\n\nSeptember 2009: Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift at the VMAs\n\nThis is the moment that started it all. A 19-year-old Swift won the award for Best Female Video at the MTV VMAs for “You Belong With Me.” Just as she took the stage to secure her Moon Man, Kanye West approached and grabbed the mic.\n\n“I’ma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!” he said. Swift was left stunned on stage.\n\n“I was really excited, because I’d just won the award, and then I was really excited because Kanye West was on stage … and then I wasn’t excited anymore after that,” she told reporters afterward.\n\nSeptember 2009: Taylor Swift says Kanye West apologized for VMAs incident\n\nTwo days after the VMAs, Swift appeared on ABC Radio to say West apologized for stealing her moment at the VMAs.\n\n“Kanye did call me and he was very sincere in his apology, and I accepted that apology,” she shared.\n\nSeptember 2010: Taylor Swift performs a new song, ‘Innocent,’ at the VMAs\n\nA year after West stole the mic from Swift, she took the same stage to perform a song called “Innocent” that would be on her album “Speak Now” coming in October. The lyrics include this line, which fans believe is Swift addressing West: “It’s OK, and life is a tough crowd / 32 and still growing up now / Who you are is not what you did / You’re still an innocent.”\n\nJune 2013: Kanye West seems to take back his apology to Taylor Swift in an interview\n\nThe New York Times interviewed Kanye West in a story tied to the release of his 2013 album “Yeezus.” Asked about Taylor Swift, the VMAs incident and if he has regrets, West said: “If anyone’s reading this waiting for some type of full-on, flat apology for anything, they should just stop reading right now.”\n\nWhen the reporter pointed out that he did already apologize for the VMAs, he responded: “Yeah, I think that I have like, faltered, you know, as a human. My message isn’t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure.”\n\nAugust 2015: Taylor Swift addresses where she stands with Kanye West\n\nSix years after the VMAs incident, it seemed West and Swift had put their feud to rest. Swift said in the Sept. 2015 edition of Vanity Fair: “I feel like I wasn’t ready to be friends with him until I felt like he had some sort of respect for me, and he wasn’t ready to be friends with me until he had some sort of respect for me — so it was the same issue, and we both reached the same place at the same time.”\n\nAugust 2015: Taylor Swift presents award to Kanye West at the VMAs\n\nIn late August, Kanye West and Taylor Swift found themselves, again, where it all started: at the VMAs. Swift appeared on stage to present West the Video Vanguard Award, which is like a lifetime achievement recognition from MTV.\n\n“I first met Kanye West six years ago — at this show, actually,” she said. “Since then, we had a lot of time to talk about a lot of different things. It seemed like everyone in the world knew about our infamous encounter at the VMAs. But something you may not know is that Kanye West's album ‘College Dropout’ was the very first album my brother and I ever bought from iTunes when I was 12 years old. I have been a fan of his since I can remember because Kanye defines what it is to be a creative force in music, fashion and, well, life. So I guess I have to say to all the other winners tonight: I’m really happy for you. I’ma let you finish, but Kanye West has had one of the greatest careers of all time.”\n\nFebruary 2016: Kanye West releases a song, ‘Famous,’ with a vulgar Taylor Swift lyric\n\nWest’s album “The Life of Pablo” came in early 2016. The record included a song called “Famous,” with a lyric referencing Taylor Swift: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex, why? / I made that b— famous.”\n\nFebruary 2016: Taylor Swift seems to address Kanye West in Grammys speech\n\nA few days after the release of “The Life of Pablo,” Swift was at the Grammys accepting her album of the year award for “1989.” In her speech, she seemed to address Kanye West.\n\n“I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame,” she said. “If you just focus on the work, and you don’t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you’re going, you’ll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world.”\n\nJune 2016: Kim Kardashian says Taylor Swift approved of ‘Famous’ lyric\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Kim Kardashian — who was married to Kanye West at the time — appeared in a GQ cover spread. In the interview, she told a reporter that Swift “totally approved” of the controversial lyric in West’s “Famous.”\n\n“She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn’t. I swear, my husband gets so much s— for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved,” she said.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for Swift issued a lengthy statement to GQ:\n\n“Taylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West. However, that does not change the fact that much of what Kim is saying is incorrect. Kanye West and Taylor only spoke once on the phone while she was on vacation with her family in January of 2016 and they have never spoken since. Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do. Kanye West never told Taylor he was going to use the term ‘that b—’ in referencing her. A song cannot be approved if it was never heard. Kanye West never played the song for Taylor Swift. Taylor heard it for the first time when everyone else did and was humiliated. Kim Kardashian’s claim that Taylor and her team were aware of being recorded is not true, and Taylor cannot understand why Kanye West, and now Kim Kardashian, will not just leave her alone.”\n\nJune 2016: Kanye West’s ‘Famous’ music video includes sculpture of naked Taylor Swift\n\nKanye West released a music video for “Famous” that included sculptures of various stars in the nude or beneath a blanket, including Chris Brown, Donald Trump and Taylor Swift. The concept for the music video was inspired by Vincent Desiderio’s painting “Sleep.”\n\nJuly 2016: Kim Kardashian posts video footage of Kanye West’s phone call with Taylor Swift\n\nIn an effort to defend her then-husband, Kim Kardashian uploaded to her Snapchat a video that she said was taken prior to the release of “The Life of Pablo.” It showed Kanye West on speaker phone with Taylor Swift, and she appeared to give approval of the lyrics to “Famous.”\n\n“As a friend, I want things that make you feel good,” West says in the video.\n\n“If people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘He called me and told me before it came out … Joke’s on you, guys. We’re fine,’” Swift also says.\n\nThe video quickly went viral on social media, with many siding with Kardashian and tweeting the hashtag “#KimExposedTaylorParty” and using snake emoji.\n\nIn response, Swift had said in a now-deleted Instagram post: “I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be part of, since 2009.”\n\nAugust 2017: Taylor Swift announces a new album, ‘Reputation,’ that seems to hint at Kanye West feud\n\nTaylor Swift famously went off the grid after Kim Kardashian leaked her phone call with Kanye West and avoided the public eye for about a year. In August 2017, she deleted all content from her social media and surprise announced a new album called “Reputation.” The album evoked dark imagery and a dramatic use of snakes, which fans took to mean as Swift reclaiming accusations of being a “snake” when Kim Kardashian leaked that phone call.\n\nNovember 2017: Swift releases a song, ‘This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,’ seemingly about Kanye West\n\nWhen “Reputation” dropped in November 2017, a track called “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” appeared to address Kanye West and the leaked phone call.\n\nThe lyrics included the lines: “There I was giving you a second chance / If only you weren’t so shady / But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand / And therein lies the issue / Friends don’t try to trick you / Get you on the phone and mind-twist you.”\n\nSeptember 2019: Taylor Swift reflects on the Kanye West feud in Rolling Stone\n\nYears after the phone-call leak, Taylor Swift opened up about her public disagreement with Kanye West in a profile story for Rolling Stone.\n\n“The world didn’t understand the context and the events that led up to it,” Swift told the magazine. “Because nothing ever just happens like that without some lead-up. Some events took place to cause me to be pissed off when he called me a b—.”\n\n“That was not just a singular event,” she went on to say. “Basically, I got really sick of the dynamic between he and I. And that wasn’t just based on what happened on that phone call and with that song — it was kind of a chain reaction of things.”\n\nMarch 2020: The full video of Taylor Swift and Kanye West’s phone call leaks\n\nAn unedited, 25-minute version of Taylor Swift and Kanye West’s phone call that Kim Kardashian posted years before was leaked online in early 2020. In the video, West shares a planned lyric along the lines of “I made her famous,” but neglects the “b—” reference that ended up in the final song. In fact, in the unedited phone call, Swift even appears to be happy that West doesn’t use such language: “I thought it was going to be like, ‘That stupid, dumb b—.’ But it’s not,” she is heard saying.\n\nShe does tell West that she’s glad the reference isn’t “mean” but would like to mull on it before giving her approval: “I need to think about it, because you know, when you hear something for the first time, you just need to think about it. Because it is absolutely crazy. I’m glad it’s not mean, though.”\n\nVariety transcribed the full conversation and posted it in article shortly after it leaked.\n\nMarch 2020: Kim Kardashian reacts to leak of full phone call — and Taylor Swift’s rep responds\n\nShortly after the full phone call between Taylor Swift and Kanye West leaked online, Kim Kardashian tweeted a response to provide her side of the story.\n\n“To be clear, the only issue I ever had around the situation was that Taylor lied through her publicist who stated that ‘Kanye never called to ask for permission,’” her tweet said. “They clearly spoke so I let you all see that. Nobody ever denied the word ‘b—’ was used without her permission.”\n\nTree Paine, Swift’s longtime publicist, then responded to Kardashian’s tweet. She re-shared her original response to the leak and added, “P.S. who did you guys piss off to leak that video?”\n\nDecember 2023: Swift calls the phone call a 'fully manufactured frame job'\n\nFor the first time in years, Swift opened up about the recorded phone call between her and Ye in an interview with Time magazine.\n\nAs the magazine describes it in Swift’s Person of the Year cover story, which was published Dec. 6, that moment went on to “shape the next decade of both artists’ lives.”\n\nSwift reflected on the feud in conversation with the cover story’s writer, journalist Sam Lansky — and then Swifties took it one step further.\n\n“I had all the hyenas climb on and take their shots,” she said about her headspace at the time.\n\n“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” she added. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”\n\nFollowing Swift’s remarks in her interview, Swifties flooded Kardashian’s Instagram with snake emoji — the same snake that become the symbol of Swift’s “Reputation” era — and wrote how the “swifties are coming for blood” and more in the comments.\n\nSwift similarly had her comments filled with the emoji after the edited phone call was released.\n\nIn the midst of all the snakes on Kardashian's page, one person wrote, “Lmao i’m so happy Swifties are finally clapping back to get their revenge.”"
