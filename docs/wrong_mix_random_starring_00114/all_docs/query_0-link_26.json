        "text": "Taylor Swift can’t help but laugh about her feud with Kanye West.\n\nDuring the Seattle stop of her Eras tour, Swift performed her song \"This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,\" which is widely believed to be about her beef with West and then wife Kim Kardashian.\n\nAfter singing the line, \"Here’s to you, cuz forgiveness is a nice thing to do,\" the 33-year-old let out a hearty laugh as the crowd cheered along.\n\nShe paused to recover and said, \"I can’t even say it with a straight face,\" before launching into the final chorus of the song.\n\nSwift laughing and saying the \"I can’t even say it with a straight face\" line are both featured on the original recording of the song, from her 2017 \"Reputation\" album, which came on the heels of a fresh dust up in her feud with West.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT'S CELEBRITY FEUD HISTORY: FROM KANYE WEST TO KATY PERRY, AND BEYOND\n\nIn 2016 West released his track, \"Famous,\" in which he made the \"Shake It Off\" singer famous and referred to her as \"that b—ch\" in the lyrics.\n\nWest claimed he had Swift’s permission to mention her in the song, which she denied.\n\nThen Kardashian, married to West at the time, released a recording of the conversation in which she apparently does ok the lyrics, and called the singer a \"snake\" on social media.\n\nDuring her \"Reputation\" release and tour, Swift embraced the snake label and used snakes in her tour and promotional imagery.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe feud goes back even further, to 2009, when West interrupted Swift's acceptance speech for best video by a female artist at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nSwift and West seemed to have settled things before he released \"Famous,\" reigniting the issue for a time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn 2020, both artists released albums on the same day, \"Folklore\" for Swift and \"Donda\" for West, but it didn't seem to spark any new issues between them."
