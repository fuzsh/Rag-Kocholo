When Beyoncé does win for Video of the Year later that night, she brings Taylor on stage to finish her speech.\n\n\"Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you and I'ma let you finish, but Beyoncé [Knowles] had one of the best videos of all time,\" Kanye West says as he grabs the mic during Swift's very first VMA win (for the Roman White-directed clip \"You Belong With Me\"). The cameras cut to a stunned Beyoncé, but what they don't show is the rapper's reaction as the audience boos him throughout his tirade: He throws them the finger. Swift shakes it off in time to give a live performance, and the night ends well for both her and Beyoncé. (West's outrage turns out to be premature as Beyoncé lands Video of the Year. Green Day is another big winner, taking three trophies, including Best Rock Video for \"21 Guns.\") But the repercussions for West extend long past awards night. Social media explodes in support of Swift, with fans and stars alike leaping to her defense. Katy Perry tweets, \"F--- u Kanye. It's like you stepped on a kitten.\" Even President Barack Obama calls West \"a jackass.\" West apologizes on his blog, on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and in a phone call to Swift. But the hits just keep on coming. His tour with Lady Gaga is cancelled, his 808s & Heartbreak album is snubbed at the upcoming Grammy Awards (where Taylor Swift wins Album of the Year for Fearless), and he's continually hounded by the paparazzi over the VMAs incident. His pal Mos Def encourages him to leave the country and when he finally does return, he secludes himself in Hawaii while he works on a new album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Looking back on the controversy, he's not as remorseful, calling himself a \"soldier of culture\" who will always stand up for art.\n\nCategories\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nIncidents\n\nMTV\n\nMusic Videos"
