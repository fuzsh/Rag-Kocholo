        "text": "MTV announced today that on August 30, Kanye West will become the next recipient of the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. He joins the ranks of Video Vanguard honorees alongside the likes of Beyonce, Madonna, Janet and Michael Jackson, Zbigniew Rybczynski, Wayne Isham, and Kevin Godley and Lol Crème.\n\nWait, what? Who are those last people? How did they win this prize? What is this prize, even?\n\nA very good question. Below, a Q&A guide to the mysterious, vaguely defined, secrecy-shrouded anointment known as the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.\n\nWhat is the Video Vanguard Award?\n\nAccording to MTV's 2013 explainer on what the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award is, the Video Vanguard Award is given to \"forerunners in the music video sphere\" and \"innovators.\"\n\nIs it for lifetime achievement?\n\n... Maybe? Until 1991, it was known as the Lifetime Achievement Award. But sometimes MTV still gives out a Lifetime Achievement award instead of a Video Vanguard Award—like in 1994 and 2003, when the Rolling Stones and Duran Duran respectively won Lifetime Achievement Awards. This is as it is; and as it is, it shall be. What MTV does not explain will simply remain unexplained.\n\nWho wins the Video Vanguard Award?\n\nSometimes, people who direct music videos—like Hype Williams (2006), Mark Romanek (1997), and Julien Temple (1987), among others. Other times, people who star in music videos. The explanation for why it's sometimes one and sometimes the other is simply the sound of one hand clapping."
