        "text": "By Charlotte Graham\n\nKanye West’s latest controversial stint, which really isn’t that controversial or crazy at all, is his recent declaration that “If [the Grammys] want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us.” In reference to his surprisingly self aware joke-storming of the stage upon Beck’s win of Album of the Year, West said, “Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should have given his award to Beyonce.” This of course has many people accusing West of egoism and arrogance yet again, but West has a point: the Grammys don’t seem to get what great music is.\n\nBecause music is an art form, “great music” is entirely subjective. Thus, the act of deciding what the greatest music of the year has been is always going to be criticized by some. There are people out there who would say that “Morning Phase” truly was the greatest album of the year, and it would be an understatement to say that Beyonce has had her fair share of Grammys and musical recognition. Beyonce is no underdog, and Beck is not untalented. The reason for the backlash is that the Grammys have a history of ignoring the obvious winner in favor of a safer choice. Beck was a safe choice, and the heaps of Grammys piled on Sam Smith were all very safe choices. The true problem might lie with the nominations.\n\nHistorically speaking, the Grammys haven’t had the greatest success with giving out awards that reflect what the fans want, or even nominating the artists who many believe deserve it. But music awards aren’t about the fans, and they aren’t necessarily about recognizing great music either.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Grammys want to make sure that they make money and keep their pedigree without causing too big of a stir with Middle America, that great tuner-inner come awards season. The disconnect between the Grammys and so many young people today comes from the simple fact of who decides the nominations, and who decides the winners. The Grammys, much like the Oscars, have a voting system that makes it very difficult for lesser known or less commercially successful artists to do well. It’s rare for a non-Katy Perry to be nominated, and even rarer for a small artist to win.\n\nRoughly one hundred and fifty “musical experts” first decide who is eligible to be nominated. After the nominations are sent out, voting members of the Grammys are permitted to vote for the four general categories, and then up to twenty of the genre categories. One might wonder who these “experts” would be, and what constitutes a musical expert over an avid fan of any genre. To become a voting member you have to apply, and you have to be either a “credible music industry individual” or someone nominated for a Grammy some time in the previous five years. This means that Sir Mix-a-Lot, who won for 1992’s “Baby Got Back,” could theoretically vote for country music albums. This also means that classical composers could be voting for rap or hip-hop albums.\n\nIt is the rap and hip-hop genres with which the Grammys have their greatest difficulty. Even ignoring the faulty system for determining who gets nominated and who goes home with the award, the Grammys still rarely recognize true artistry in these categories. The most obvious example of the Grammy’s great misunderstanding of the musical zeitgeist was when in 2014 Macklemore won four Grammy Awards for his contributions to the rap genre, including Best Rap Album for The Heist.\n\nIn this, Macklemore beat out rap heavyweights Drake, Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Kendrick Lamar; all of whom put out some of their best work that year, with Drake and Lamar in particular having albums generally agreed upon to be their greatest efforts thus far. Macklemore himself acknowledged his theft of the award, specifically from Lamar, when he posted a rather obsequious instagram dedicated to Lamar, in which he apologizes for winning. When the guy who won is actually saying sorry for his win, there has to be something wrong.\n\nComplex magazine recently released a very helpful video showing the extent of the division between what the Grammy’s think great rap/hip-hop music is and what passionate fans of the genre think great rap/hip-hop music is. The video notes that with Macklemore’s four Grammys, he now has more Grammys than Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G., DMX, Busta Rhymes, KRS-One, Rick Ross, Snoop Dogg, Mos Def, Run DMC, Public Enemy, Big Pun, Young Jeezy, Ja Rule and Kendrick Lamar combined. Of course, after Lamar’s two wins at this years Grammys (for a song which most of his fans view as one of his weakest), this statistic would be skewed. But the fact remains that the Grammys seem to just not get what great music is, especially with the genres they are so out of touch with.\n\nIn his speech about the plight of the Grammys this year, West continued to say that “… when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in their face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you’re disrespectful to inspiration.” It’s easy to write West off as an egomaniac who likes to rant, but what he is saying rings true. The Grammys regularly smack artists in the face, and the divide between the Grammys and the fans is becoming bigger and bigger with each year."
