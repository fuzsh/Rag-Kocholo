        "text": "The ever-volatile Kanye West has been on a tear lately with his trademark scattershot, mad lib-inspired missives delivered between songs during the West Coast leg of his Saint Pablo tour. Last month, he delivered a rant on the politics of streaming services in Seattle. Earlier this week in San Jose, he touched on a different kind of politics, offering a highly dubious explanation for why he would have voted for Donald Trump. And on Saturday night in Sacramento, West committed the most egregious sin yet, at least in the eyes of the Internet: taking shots at Jay Z and Beyonce.\n\nFirst, he alleged that he was tipped off before the VMAs that MTV had promised Beyoncé a win for her “Formation” video in return for her performance at the ceremony.\n\n“I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for ‘Formatio’ over ‘Hotline Bling’ and ‘Famous.’” They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage. Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt.\n\nThis is not a super unreasonable move on the part of MTV given the man’s history with this event in particular, but still, if true, that had to have been deflating. He wasn’t done, though:\n\nBeyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over “Hotline Bling.” In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal. But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh. I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career, I’ve been sitting here to give y’all the truth.\n\nOn Beyoncé's husband, and the assassins allegedly in Beyoncé's husband's employ, West had this to say:\n\nJay Z, call me, bruh. You still ain’t calling me. Jay Z, call me. Aye, bruh, I know you got killers. Please don’t send them at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man. I’m not trying to be the man. I just am a man, the same as anybody here. I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal. We all equal. This is the vibes, bro. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again.\n\nHe then moved on to Hillary Clinton, Google, and Mark Zuckerberg, because why not:\n\nThe Saint Pablo tour is more relevant than radio and if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton. You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gonna win over and over and over and then you wake up [and] you still can’t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nFinally, the 2020 presidential candidate wrapped things up with this bizarro-world verison of “Change We Can Believe In,” which he should probably not run as the voice-over to his campaign ads:\n\nI’m not scared. I’m here to change things. I am here to change things. And things won't change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with. My vision. I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, press get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press. Get ready, get ready. Because the show’s over.\n\nNo, seriously. After reportedly beginning his set 90 minutes late, West dropped the mic, ending the performance after 15 minutes and three songs, and Ticketmaster was offering attendees full refunds on Sunday morning. The Beyoncé allegations are the most lurid, of course, but it’s his plaintive, boombox-holding plea for Jay Z's ear that bums me out the most. Remember “Run This Town”? “Never Let Me Down”? Hell, even Watch the Throne and those unending “Paris” finales on tour seem like a million years ago. We're glad Kanye's allegedly found a new collaborator, but Drake, my man, you’ve got some big shoes to fill."
