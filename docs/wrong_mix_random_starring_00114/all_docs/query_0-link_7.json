        "text": "Twitter/@elevatordeity\n\nIf you think Taylor Swift and Kanye West kissed and made up after the VMA Awards debacle 14 years ago, then you're dead wrong ... and there's now video to prove it.\n\nAs part of her sold-out Eras Tour, Taylor was performing on stage at Lumen Field in Seattle, Washington Saturday night and cranking out \"This is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.\"\n\nThe tune was inspired by the phone recording incident back in 2016, when Kanye said he gave Taylor a heads up before releasing his song, \"Famous,\" which included the lyric, \"I made that bitch famous.\" Taylor begged to differ.\n\nTMZ/Getty Composite\n\nKim Kardashian West Responds to Taylor Swift Over Old Kanye Video\n\nCheck out the clip of Taylor addressing the issue all these years later ... the pop star begins to laugh uproariously after singing the lyrics, \"Cause forgiveness is the nice thing to do.\"\n\nTaylor finds the whole notion so funny she can barely compose herself, admitting, \"I can barely say it with a straight face.\" She then continues playing as the crowd goes wild.\n\nBy the way, Kim Kardashian -- Kanye's wife at the time --jumped to his defense, using snake emojis to call Taylor a \"snake\" after Swift said she was blindsided by the lyric."
