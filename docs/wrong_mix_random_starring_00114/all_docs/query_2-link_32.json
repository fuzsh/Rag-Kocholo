        "text": "Kanye West won a Grammy on Sunday night (14 March) – and many fans were surprised by his victory, given what he did to one of his awards last year.\n\nThe rapper won the prize for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album at the 2021 ceremony for his gospel record Jesus Is King, marking his first Grammy victory in eight years.\n\nThe triumph comes just six months after West shared a video on social media in which he appeared to urinate on one of his 21 previous Grammys.\n\nAlongside a video of a trophy in a toilet, West captioned the post: “Trust me ... I WONT STOP.”\n\nRead more:\n\nThe post came as West compared the music industry to slave ships and announced he would not release any new music under his current contract.\n\nMany fans expressed bemusement that West won another Grammy after his show of disdain for the awards last year.\n\n“KANYE WEST WON A GRAMMY AFTER PEEING ON A GRAMMY HOLYGODDDDD,” tweeted one person.\n\nAnother said: “Kanye West: the only artist that can piss on a Grammy and go out and win another. Sensational.”\n\nWest sparked concern over his multiple social media outbursts last year. His ex-wife Kim Kardashian, with whom he is currently going through a divorce, defended him and pleaded for compassion from his fans, the media and the public.\n\n“As many of you know, Kanye has bipolar disorder,” she posted on Instagram. “Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand.”\n\nMegan Thee Stallion, Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift all scored top awards in what was an eventful (albeit socially distanced) ceremony.\n\nTrevor Noah hosted the event from the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Despite a modified format due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the evening included several energetic performances from Harry Styles, Cardi B, BTS, Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa, and more.\n\nThe ceremony also made a couple of new entries into Grammys history, as Beyoncé became the female artist with the most trophies and Taylor Swift became the first woman to score three wins in the Album of the Year category. Harry Styles also took home his first Grammy."
