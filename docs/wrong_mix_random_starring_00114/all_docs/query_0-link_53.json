        "text": "After winning four awards Sunday at the 56th Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, Seattle rapper Ben Haggerty — who goes by the handle Macklemore — posted an \"apology\" to fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar on the photo-sharing site Instagram. He wrote, \"You got robbed. I wanted you to win. You should have.\"\n\nMacklemore was referring to his award for best rap album, for \"The Heist,\" a win that came as a shock to rap insiders, since the competition included favorite Lamar and Kanye West, one of the most famous and accomplished rappers alive.\n\nOne might say the apology was even more surprising than the win, especially given the (continuing) firestorm it ignited on social media.\n\nBut for those who follow American popular music, it was more like deja vu. Sixty years ago, jazz pianist Dave Brubeck apologized to Duke Ellington for getting on the cover of Time magazine before Ellington.\n\n\"I was so hoping that they would do Duke first, because I idolized him,\" Brubeck told a reporter. \"He was so much more important than I was.\"\n\nIn Brubeck's case, the embarrassment came in part from his admiration for an elder. But the subtext, as with Macklemore, was also race. Brubeck, like Macklemore, was white; Ellington, like Lamar, black.\n\nThanks to slavery, racism and segregation, America has an ugly cultural history that has resulted in a succession of travesties. The first jazz record, for example, was made by a white group (Original Dixieland Jazz Band, 1917).\n\nWhite musicians historically have earned 10-fold to 100-fold what black musicians have, playing the same music. \"Stan Getz the money,\" black tenor saxophonist Lester Young once quipped about his successful white stylistic heir. And Elvis Presley, not to mention the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, made millions playing music \"borrowed\" from black culture.\n\nEven in our more enlightened, post-Motown era, when black musicians from Smokey Robinson to West also can and do make millions, the paradigm persists. Black innovation; white imitation; white wealth; black anger; white guilt.\n\nIn his brilliant analysis of minstrelsy, social historian Eric Lott has dubbed this paradigm \"Love and Theft,\" which unpacks the curious fascination — and envy — white people have had from the start with black culture.\n\nMacklemore was operating squarely in this paradigm, one that should be familiar and comprehensible to all Americans, even if they haven't thought about it.\n\nWhat they likely haven't thought about is who and how and why people vote in the Grammys, which are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.\n\nTo be a voting member, you must have participated — as an artist, engineer, producer, writer of liner notes, etc. — in making a recording. The folks who vote in the Grammys are part of a trade organization meant to honor not only artistic excellence, but also craftsmanship — and, yes, success.\n\nThat's why, every year, millions of fans shake their heads, wondering, \"Why didn't my favorite cool, new band win a Grammy? They're so much better!\"\n\nAnd the reason for that — other than in the \"best new artist\" category, which Macklemore handily won — is that the Grammys are not about your favorite cool, new band no one has ever heard of. They are about excellence, craft and success.\n\nThat said, Grammy voters also tend to behave like investors — they flock to a perceived winner. Which probably explains Macklemore's wins in three rap categories — best song and best performance (for \"Thrift Shop\") and best album.\n\nDoes he owe anyone an apology? Maybe. Maybe not.\n\nBut one thing for sure, it's nothing new.\n\nRap fans have been heavy-handed with criticism of Macklemore's success. With a more pop-oriented brand of rap informed as much by indie rock as traditional hip-hop, he's dominated mainstream radio with hits like \"Thrift Shop,\" \"Can't Hold Us\" and \"Same Love.\" Despite a rise from underground rap to mainstream star that took more than a decade, Macklemore has become an easy punchline in the rap world, often dismissed as a gimmicky pop act. Some of the harshest criticisms, unfairly, have focused on his race, and the leg up that it may have given him over his black peers - think pieces are plastered all over the Internet - and he's discussed the role his race may have played, once telling Rolling Stone that being white helped his success. \"We made a great album,\" he said, \"but I do think we have benefited from being white and the media grabbing on to something. A song like 'Thrift Shop' was safe enough for the kids. It was like, 'This is music that my mom likes and that I can like as a teenager,' and even though I'm cussing my —- off in that song, the fact that I'm a white guy, parents feel safe. They let their 6-year-olds listen to it. I mean, it's just ... it's different. And would that success have been the same if I would have been a black dude? I think the answer is 'No.'\" LOS ANGELES TIMES\n\nThe Rap on Macklemore"
