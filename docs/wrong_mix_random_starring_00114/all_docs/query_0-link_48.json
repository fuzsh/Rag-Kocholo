According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented for \"albums containing at least 51% playing time of tracks with newly recorded rapped performances\".[4] Award recipients often include the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists.[5]\n\nAs of 2023, Eminem holds the record for the most wins in this category, with six. Lauryn Hill was the first female artist to win in this category, when she won in 1997 with the Fugees. The duo Outkast and rapper Tyler, The Creator have both received the award twice. Jay-Z holds the record for the most nominations, with eleven. Drake became the first non-American winner in this category when he won in 2013. The Roots have received the most nominations without a win, with five. Eminem and West are the only artists to win the award in consecutive years, with Eminem achieving the feat twice. In 2016, Drake's If You're Reading This It's Too Late became the first mixtape to get nominated for the award, and in 2017, Chance the Rapper's Coloring Book became the first mixtape to win the award. Cardi B became the first solo female rapper to win for Invasion of Privacy.[6]\n\nRecipients[edit]\n\nYear Recipient(s) Work Nominees Ref. 1996 Naughty by Nature Poverty's Paradise [7] 1997 Fugees\n\n· Fugees, producers The Score [8] 1998 Puff Daddy and the Family\n\n· Puff Daddy And The Family & Stevie J. producers No Way Out [9] 1999 Jay-Z\n\n· Joe Quinde, engineer/mixer Vol. 2...
