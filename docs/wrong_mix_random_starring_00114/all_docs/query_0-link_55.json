        "text": "Ryan Moys began his career in the music industry playing in bands and recording demos before eventually making the move to study audio production at the Art Institute of Seattle. Ryan spent the next several years working as a freelance engineer at local recording studios and clubs in Seattle. Eventually making his way back to the Philadelphia area where he grew up, Ryan became the personal engineer for Grammy Award winning record producer James Poyser (Jimmy Fallon Show, Erykah Badu, Common, The Roots, D’Angelo) and continues to work alongside James on various gold and platinum selling album projects. Ryan has served as a local fixture at the famed Philadelphia recording studio, Larry Gold’s TheStudio, where he recorded and mixed numerous major label and independent clientele projects and recorded string arrangements for artists such as Kanye West under award winning arranger and composer Larry Gold. During his 15 year career, he has earned an impressive credit list with artists such as Common, Joss Stone, Anthony Hamilton and Jill Scott. In 2009 he received a Grammy Award for Kirk Franklin’s “Fight of My Life” album. Ryan has also recorded and mixed scores for feature films such as VH1’s “Totally Awesome” as well as mixing concert TV series for VH1, MTV, and TVOne."
