        "text": "WASHINGTON — Kanye West took home the Visionary Award at the B.E.T. Honors on Saturday during an evening of surprise freestyles at the Warner Theater near the White House.\n\nThe awards celebrate black luminaries in fields including entertainment, education and technology. Among the other winners were Usher, who received the musical arts award; John W. Thompson, the chairman of Microsoft, who received the technology and business award; Johnnetta Betsch Cole, director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Art and the first black female president of Spelman College, who received the education award; and Phylicia Rashad, known for her role as Clair Huxtable on “The Cosby Show” who received the theatrical arts award.\n\nMr. West was dressed in an all-black suit designed by Balmain — a tidbit he was sure to note in his acceptance speech — and was accompanied by his wife, Kim Kardashian.\n\nThis is the eighth year the awards have been given out. The attendees spanned the worlds of music, politics and media. The singers Patti LaBelle and Mary J. Blige, performed before guests like Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.; Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C.; Wolf Blitzer of CNN; Esaw Garner, the widow of Eric Garner who was killed by a New York City police officer; and Philippe Dumont, the president of Viacom.\n\nWayne Brady, of “Whose Line Is It Anyway?,” hosted the ceremony, which will be broadcast on Feb. 23.\n\nDuring his acceptance speech Mr. West spoke about the significance of ownership in the media, saying: “Our power, our oil — since we don’t own any oil — is our expression, is our influence. Don’t ever let them take that away from you.”"
