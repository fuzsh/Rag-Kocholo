        "text": "After storming the stage when Taylor Swift was awarded the Best Female Video Award at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, Kanye West shares that he had needed to flee the country. The infamous moment saw him take to the stage as Swift was delivering her acceptance speech, saying, \"Taylor, imma let you finish, but Beyonc√© had the best video of all time.\"\n\nWhile sitting down with Drink Champs for part two of their interview with the rapper, West touched on what happened after the cameras stopped rolling. The rapper went on a \"personal exile\" to Japan, explaining \"All of America hate me, 'you was wrong! You wrong for this one! You won't win this!' Everybody telling me, 'you shouldn't have run on stage. You were rude, God forbid!'\" the rapper said.\n\nWest's Drink Champs interview also saw him addressing his mental health and how other people perceive him. The rapper has been open about his diagnosis with bipolar disorder, and the stigmas he faces along with it. He comments that detractors will brush him off with the construct that he's \"crazy,\" to which he says, \"And I could do all these things... and I'm a tell you like this, for Britney Spears for anybody.... okay, 'I'm crazy, but what y'all gonna do about it?'\""
