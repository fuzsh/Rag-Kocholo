        "text": "Kanye West received 4,037 votes in Arkansas as part of his failed 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nVotes for the 43-year-old rapper accounted for 0.34 percent of the 1.1 million ballots cast in the state, where Donald Trump .\n\nWest received 56,543 votes across the country, according to reports. He and his running mate, Wyoming preacher Michelle Tidball, appeared in 12 states. Efforts to get him on the ballot in Arkansas and other states were assisted by lawyers and activists with GOP ties.\n\nWest, who once praised Trump and said the two share “dragon energy,” said in an interview with Forbes that he no longer supported the president. He also insisted that his campaign was not a stunt to drum up interest in an upcoming album.\n\nWest tweeted on Election Day: \"Today I am voting for the first time in my life for the President of the United States, and it's for someone I truly trust...me.\"\n\nThe campaign might not be West's last. He tweeted \"KANYE 2024\" early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed information to this report."
