        "text": "Kanye West made a surprise appearance at the 2022 BET Awards to honor Lifetime Achievement Award winner Sean 'Diddy' Combs.\n\nKenneth 'Babyface' Edmonds took to the stage to present the award to Combs, but he threw fans for a loop when he brought out Kanye West.\n\nWest took to the stage in his now-signature boots with a large coat, black glasses, black hat and black face mask before taking to the mic and honoring Combs.\n\nFans were treated to another surprise too when Mariah Carey took the stage to do a duet with Latto for her hit song Big Energy, which features a sample from Carey's hit song Fantasy.\n\n'How do we crown our kings? How do we appreciate our kings? To think how far we could just make it off of inspiration,' West began.\n\n'To hear the way somebody chopped a sample in. We are rushing in to see who could get the bad boy mixed tape and play back the original version of Benjamin's over an end over,' he added.\n\n'Me sitting at M crib. To puff without knowing. That statement is not legally binding,' West said with a laugh.\n\n'To go to New York and think that because I saw the videos, everybody had on Leath jackets. To see Puff in real life. Just like me tapping free as a little kid. I just need to meet this man. This is my favorite artist. You see what I'm saying?' he added.\n\n' You know back then it was so many rules to hip hop. He broke all of them. Broke down all the doors. Understood contracts in a way a lot of us still don't. Understood money in a way a lot of us still don't. I go to him for advice to this day. He inspired so many of my choices. So many of my life choices. My wife choices. And here we are. Thanks for that, Puff,' he joked.\n\n'You understand getting snuck into the club at 17 years old. In Chicago. Thinking we was part of Bad Boy. This man was so famous, it was just good enough for me to be Chicago's version of puff. You know, I took a little hiatus. I said I wanted to declare myself legally dead for a year. Nobody messing me. You know, I just want to be off the grid. Puff is pretty persistent. But I had to think. It's like people, they get amnesia. Like I should never have to call more than one time,' he said.\n\n'Any of us in this room, if Puff ever needed us, we need to jump and be there. This man has been through and survived a lot of stuff. Broke down a lot of doors so we could be standing. I know for me, that I could be here today. He broke down so many doors of classism, taste, culture, swag. Puff, if I never told you I love you, you're my brother,' he concluded.\n\nThe 2022 BET Awards got off to a great start on Sunday, when Jazmine Sullivan won the first award of the night, Best Female R&B/Pop Artist.\n\nJanelle Monae presented the first award, with Sullivan beating out Ari Lennox, Chlöe, Doja Cat, H.E.R., Mary J. Blige and Summer Walker at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nThe singer delivered a passionate plea to all of the men to support them, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n'Hey thank you all. I love you too. As always, I do this for the women. For my sisters especially. It's a hard time right now for us. I want to speak directly to the men. We need you all. We need y'all to stand up. Stand up for us. Stand up with us,' she began.\n\n'If you have ever benefited from a woman making one of the toughest decisions of her life, to terminate a pregnancy, you need to be standing with us. This is not just a woman's This is everybody's issue. We need your support more than ever, okay, fellas. Y'all got us? We've got y'all. You all have got us? Thank you so much,' she concluded.\n\nWill Packer and Idris Elba presented the Best New Artist, which was won by Latto, who beat out Baby Keem, Benny The Butcher, Muni Long, Tems, Yung Bleu.\n\n'Oh, my god. Can y'all hear me? Oh, my go. I said I wasn't going to cry. Thank you, god. Thank you, mom. And we are watching. Thank you, mom. Thank you to my team. Oh, my go. Oh, my go. Never give in. A man policing my body,' she began.\n\n'Hey, baby, I know you're watching too. Thank you, baby. I said I was going to cry, yell. I'm so grateful if you know me and my story. It's been a long time coming. I am so appreciative,' she added.\n\n'My first award. And it's my first award by black entertainment television, period. Shout out to all the other artists in the category, you deserve it just as much,' she concluded.\n\nMarsai Martin presented the Best Collaboration award, which was won by Wizkid Featuring Justin Bieber and Tems for their son Essence.\n\nThey beat out 'Every Chance I Get,' DJ Khaled Feat. Lil Baby & Lil Durk'Family Ties,' Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar, 'Kiss Me More,' Doja Cat Feat. SZA, 'Way 2 Sexy,' Drake Feat. Future & Young Thug and 'Whole Lotta Money (Remix),' BIA Feat. Nicki Minaj.\n\nTems accepted the award and said, 'Thank you, BET. Thank you, everyone. I want to -- this award is for Africa. I just want to say the great thing is happening out of Africa right now. I just want to -- this is dedicated to Africa and Nigeria. Thank you.'\n\nThe Chi stars Luke James and Kandi Burruss presented the Dr. Bobby Jones Best Gospel/Inspirational Award, which was won by We Win by Lil Baby X Kirk Franklin\n\nThey beat out 'All In Your Hands,' Marvin Sapp, 'Come To Life,' Kanye West, 'Grace,' Kelly Price, 'Hallelujah,' Fred Hammond, 'Hold Us Together (Hope Mix),' H.E.R. & Tauren Wells and 'Jireh,' Elevation Worship & Maverick City Music.\n\nKirk Franklin accepted the award, stating, 'So blessed to have an opportunity. I've been blessed to be in front of the most beautiful people in the world, my people. My entire career. My people are the most talented, the most gifted, the most anointed.'\n\n'And my job is to not only serve you but my job is to also serve the next generation. I have up here the next generation. And one thing that I have always had a problem with and it comes to our elders,' he said.\n\n'A lot of times they will hold a position until they die and they don't pass the baton and they die with the baton. So many of us died in financial poverty. Those that had the wealth did not pass the baton,' Franklin added.\n\n'So many black churches died in ignorance because the pastor would not step down and pass the baton. So tonight because I have been blessed, I want to be a blessing to the next generation. Maverick city deserves this baton. This award. Maverick city. The next generation of gospel music. Give it up for then. Give it up for them,' he said, handing the award to Maverick City.\n\nMartin stars Tisha Campbell and Carl Payne presented the BET Her award, which was won by 'Good Morning Gorgeous' by Mary J. Blige.\n\nShe beat out 'Best Of Me (Originals),' Alicia Keys, 'Have Mercy,' Chlöe 'Pressure,' Ari Lennox, 'Roster,' Jazmine Sullivan, 'Unloyal,' Summer Walker & Ari Lennox and 'Woman,' Doja Cat.\n\n'Thank you. Wow. Wow. Thank you so much, everybody. How are y'all doing? Good to see y'all. Give me a little bit of time. I won't take long,' she began.\n\n'It's a blessing to still be doing what I love and to be in this category with all these amazing women who write songs that empower is a true honor. People always ask me, do I ever get used to winning awards and been nominated. I always say no because no matter how hard you work and even if you think you deserve it, you just don't know how it's going to go sometimes,' she said.\n\n'So this is always an unexpected gift and blessing. Thank you. Almost done. These moments, these moments I never take for granted. Three years ago I was here receiving the lifetime achievement award and normally receive that award, that means you're about to retire or be done and here I am today by the grace of god still winning, still nominated,' she said.\n\n'It's hard work on me every single day. It's my priority. It's not easy. But I have to look in the mirror and say good morning, gorgeous. No matter what I see that mirror, I have to say something to make me believe in myself. I thank god for the courage to do that and I thank god for everything. You are the greatest. Thank you to all my fans. I am -- I've beyond appreciate you. Bet, thank you so much for always being there for all of us,' she said, while also thanking H.E.R. and Lucky Daye for writing the song with her.\n\nEva Marcille presented the Best International Act award, which was won by Nigerian singer Tems.\n\nShe beat out Dave (UK), Dinos (France), Fally Ipupa (DRC), Fireboy DML (Nigeria), Little Simz (UK), Ludmilla (Brazil), Major League DJz (South Africa) and Tayc (France).\n\n'BET, thank you so much for this.

I just want to use this opportunity to speak to every single young, old, whatever, every single woman watching this,' Tems began.\n\n'Every single girl watching this at home.

As you're watching me, I want you to imagine yourself as me because you are meant to be here too,' she said.\n\n'I am dedicating this to every single young woman, every artist, everybody that is striving and dares to dream.
