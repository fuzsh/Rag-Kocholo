        "text": "Taylor Swift couldn’t help but laugh at her old feud with Kanye West during a show in Seattle, Washington on Saturday.\n\nSwift has been adding “surprise songs” to the setlist of her Eras Tour shows, and this one was “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” from the album Reputation. The song has always been rumored to be about the feud between her and West that began at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when Swift won Best Female Video for “You Belong With Me,” off the Fearless album. West infamously jumped onstage, took the mic, and interrupted Swift to say that “Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time.”\n\n“Forgiveness is a nice thing to do,” Swift sang before letting out a loud cackle. She took a few moments to compose herself, laughing some more, and said, “I can’t even say it with a straight face,” before launching back into the song.\n\nThere was a time before West completely and totally went off the deep end that Swift did indeed think forgiveness was a nice thing to do. Well, not anymore. Now he’s losing billions of dollars of sneaker money, and she’s cackling all the way to the bank."
