Kanye West rented the entire Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia to work on this album in private and made constant recordings of his production process where he was in a \"jail cell\" type of space to later make several closed-door performances with a limited amount of audience.\n\nThe album became instantly viral because of its particularity in performance antics, attire, and song list"
