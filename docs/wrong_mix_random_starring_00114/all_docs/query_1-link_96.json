        "text": "Taylor Swift's ongoing feud with Kanye West was front and center again at the 58th annual Grammy Awards on February 15 when she hit back at his new lyrics about \"making her famous,\" but these two have been making headlines over their falling out for nearly seven years.\n\nClick through for a review of what went wrong between Swift and West.\n\nThe interruption heard round the world\n\nIt all started in September 2009, when Kanye West couldn't contain his frustration at Beyonce not winning the Video of the Year award at the MTV VMAs. He rushed the stage, grabbed to microphone from winner Taylor Swift and vented his frustrations.\n\nWest apologizes via \"Leno\"\n\n\"It was rude, period,\" Kanye West said on \"The Jay Leno Show\" about hijacking Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2009. He even shed a few tears.\n\nSwift discusses the incident on \"The View\"\n\nTaylor Swift herself hit the talk show circuit, fielding questions about the VMAs incident from the ladies of \"The View.\" She got a phone call from Kanye West after she told the hosts she had not heard from him personally.\n\nBarack Obama weighs in\n\nKanye West was widely criticized for his VMAs outburst. President Obama even called him a \"jackass\" in an off-the-record comment. West apologized to Swift two days later.\n\nWest reflects on his actions a year later\n\nAfter some time outside of the U.S. to reflect on his behavior, Kanye West struck a reserved and regretful pose during a visit to Ellen DeGeneres' talk show in 2010.\n\nFour years later, Swift won't let it go\n\nWhen the nominations for the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards were announced, Taylor Swift joked on Twitter that she'd hang on tighter to the mic if she won an award again.\n\nSwift mocks West with gift to Ed Sheeran\n\nApparently Swift just couldn't move on from the Kanye West incident. In August 2013, pal Ed Sheeran revealed on Instagram that he'd received a gift of homemade jam from Taylor Swift with a label that made light of her feud with West.\n\nSwift and West kiss and make up\n\nAll seemed to be forgiven between the two in 2015, when MTV enlisted Taylor Swift to present Kanye West with the Video Vanguard Award. She even stood by his wife, Kim Kardashian, as he went on an 11-minute rant that ended in a declaration he'd run for president in 2020.\n\nWest reignites the feud with \"Famous\"\n\nDuring Kanye West's impromptu listening party for his new album, \"The Life of Pablo,\" friends, family and fans are the first to hear his lyrics about Taylor Swift claiming, \"I made that b***h famous.\" He immediately defends the track on Twitter, insisting he is not dissing Swift and had actually cleared it with her -- a claim Swift's camp quickly shot down.\n\nTaylor uses the Grammy stage for revenge\n\nWhen Taylor Swift accepted the Album of the Year award at this year's Grammys on February 15, she snuck a clear reference to Kanye West's new lyrics about her into her speech, advising other women to ignore and defy anyone who would try to diminish or co-opt their successes.\n\nBy Ned Ehrbar"
