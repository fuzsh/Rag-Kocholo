        "text": "Christian music powerhouse for KING & COUNTRY and rap superstar Kanye West were among winners Friday night in a Dove Awards ceremony that — like most programs in 2020 — looked far different than the year before.\n\nDuring a Dove Awards that urged unity and shared stories of healing, the show honored for KING & COUNTRY with Artist of the Year — top award of the night.\n\nThe recognition marked a pinnacle for the brotherly duo who've climbed in the last half-decade to top of the Christian music ranks, earning Grammy Awards, topping Billboard's Christian Airplay chart and collaborating with icon Dolly Parton. It's the first Artist of the Year win and second nomination for the Australian-raised, Nashville-based group.\n\n\"We just heard the news about the Artist of the Year award,\" Joel Smallbone, one-half of for KING & COUNTRY, said in a video message Friday — the same day they celebrate the release of a new \"A Drummer Boy Christmas\" album. \"We're very grateful. [We] loved seeing you all finding new ways, in times like this ... to come together and do something new, do something fresh. Love seeing the diversity and the representation. Good on you.\"\n\nHe added, \"We're proud to receive this award.\"\n\nDove Awards 2020:: A complete list of winners\n\nThe 51st annual Gospel Music Association Dove Awards played Friday evening in a format fit for 2020. The show embraced pre-taped performances and artist interview segments in a Trinity Broadcast Network slot typically reserved for replaying a live awards program in front of an arena-sized audience at Lipscomb University in Nashville.\n\nIncluded Friday was a victory for West, the cultural figure, best-selling rapper and U.S. presidential candidate who ventured into Christian music last year with his much-anticipated album \"Jesus Is King.\"\n\nSince dropping last October, the project dominated Billboard's respective gospel and Christian charts. West earned three nominations and one Dove Award —Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year for his track \"Follow God.\"\n\n\"Turns out that 'Jesus Walks' was just a foretaste of Kanye West launching head-on into gospel music,\" genre mainstay CeCE Winans said in introducing one category. \"He took his mainstream audience to the church, staying atop the Billboard gospel charts for almost a year.\"\n\nAdditional winners Friday night included Tauren Wells, a first-time Contemporary Christian Artist of the Year recipient; Tasha Cobbs Leonard expanded her career Dove wins to four with Gospel Artist of the Year; Americana-tinged family act We The Kingdom scored New Artist of the Year; Nashville-produced movie \"I Still Believe\" earned Inspirational Film of the Year; and breakout worship tune \"Way Maker\" took Song of the Year.\n\nArtists such as We The Kingdom, Jonathan McReynolds and Jeremy Camp delivered pre-taped performances from the Trinity Broadcast Network studio in Hendersonville, Tennessee.\n\nFor KING & COUNTRY enlisted LaCrae and Tony Williams for a fittingly theatrical show opener, \"Amen.\" Leonard sang an explosive version of her song \"Release The Sound\" and Leeland teamed with Mandisa and Nigerian worship songwriter Sinach to bring \"Way Maker\" to life.\n\nThe show closed with Wells representing his new Contemporary Christian Artist of the Year honor by circling singers Christine D'Clario, Jekalyn Carr and Jenn Johnson in a round for 2020 single, \"Famous For (I Believe).\"\n\nUnlike Nashville-based country programs such as the ACM Awards and CMT Awards before it, the Doves didn't host live acceptance speeches from winners (no pre-election day appearance from West, either).\n\nThe decision to omit speeches comes a year after gospel favorite Kirk Franklin said he would boycott the Dove Awards for editing an acceptance speech during the 2019 broadcast. The two-hour show cut his remarks to \"send prayers up\" to the family of Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old who was shot and killed in her home by a Fort Worth police officer. Dove Awards leadership apologized to Franklin after he shared his frustrations via social media.\n\nThe show instead interviewed leading and fast-rising voices in Christian music for segments on faith during the pandemic, ways to stay encouraged, how to kill time during lockdown (hitmaker Zach Williams says he \"never\" wants to see another puzzle again) and the power of music in a year defined by a global health crisis and social unrest.\n\n\"We have to understand that there’s a fight that comes with favor,\" said Pastor Mike Jr., a Christian artist who performed \"Big,\" a fist-pumping modern praise song, \"and if we can all come together an realize what God is doing in this season is unique, we can be the change we desire to see.\""
