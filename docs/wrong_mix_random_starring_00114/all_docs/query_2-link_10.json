        "text": "Taylor Swift barely had a chance to accept her award for Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 13 before Kanye West rushed the stage, grabbed the microphone out of the startled teen's hands and aired his objections. \"I'm sorry, but Beyonc√© had one of the best videos of all time!\" the rapper complained, referring to the undeniably danceable \"Single Ladies.\" Swift, who had won the award for her high school love song \"You Belong With Me,\" was hurt. \"I was standing onstage, and I was really excited because I'd just won the award, and then I was really excited because Kanye West was onstage,\" she told People magazine. \"And then I wasn't excited anymore after that.\"\n\nWest has made a habit of airing his displeasure at awards shows. He walked out of the 2004 American Music Awards after losing the Best New Artist title to country singer Gretchen Wilson. (\"I was the best new artist this year,\" he complained backstage.) Two years later, West crashed the stage of the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards and launched into a profanity-laced rant after losing in the Best Hip-Hop Artist category to Justice and Simian. West said his \"Touch the Sky\" video was better because it \"cost a million dollars. Pamela Anderson was in it. I was jumping across canyons.\" He later apologized, explaining that he had enjoyed \"a little sippy sippy\" before the ceremony."
