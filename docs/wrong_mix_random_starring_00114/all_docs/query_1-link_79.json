        "text": "It has been 11 years since one of the most jaw-dropping moments of award show history involving both Kanye West and Taylor Swift.\n\nFor those who may not remember, allow us to take you back in time. It was the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and Taylor Swift had just won the Best Female Video Award for “You Belong With Me”.\n\nAs she ascended on stage to accept her award, she was interrupted by Kanye West—who refused to take off his sunglasses—loudly protesting that Beyoncé Knowles should have won instead, for her “Single Ladies” music video.\n\n“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’mma let you finish,” West began. “But Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”\n\nSince then, many have taken Swift’s side in the incident, claiming that West should have kept his opinions to himself. But now, it looks like West has spoken out about the real reason as to why he decided to take the stage back in 2009.\n\nAppearing on Nick Cannon’s podcast Cannon’s Class, the rapper opened up about his 2016 hospitalisation, his presidential campaign but most importantly, the controversy surrounding the notorious on-stage moment.\n\n“Right now, God is giving me the information,” he said. “If God ain’t want me to run on stage and say Beyoncé had the best video, he wouldn’t have sat me in the front row. I would’ve been sitting in the back.”\n\n“It wouldn’t have made it so ridiculous of an idea because I had never heard of this person before,” West admitted. “And ‘Single Ladies’ is, like, one of the greatest videos of all time. I was only drinking Hennessy because I didn’t want to go to the awards show because it was a set-up.”\n\nAnd while this is one of the few times West has addressed the on-screen moment, Swift has previously come forward to share how his actions impacted her.\n\nDuring the release for her album ‘Lover’, Swift released some of her personal diary entries as part of the deluxe edition of the album; one of the entries including her reaction to West’s speech.\n\n“Ahh… the things that can change in a week,” she wrote in the diary entry. “If you had told me that one of the biggest stars in music was going to jump on stage and announce that he thought I shouldn’t have won on live television, I would’ve said, ‘That stuff doesn’t really happen in real life.'”\n\n“Well… apparently… It does,” she ended the note."
