        "text": "Kanye West was a producer first and a rapper second â barely.\n\nAfter signing to Rocafella Records, his beats helped shape Jay-Zâs seminal 2001 LP, The Blueprint, and he sang the hook for featured track âNever Changeâ; a hook intended to be an in-house nod more than a potential creative manoeuvre. That West wasnât considered a rapper-and-producer was no oversight on the part of the Rocafella founders, Damon Dash and Shawn Carter: they admitted that the hook was a pay-off to stop West sending his beats to anyone else, which eventually resulted in a lack of funds and attention for his first LP, The College Dropout.\n\nTwo weeks after his now-infamous car crash in the October of 2002, West wrote and recorded âThrough the Wire,â rapping through a broken jaw held together by strings of metal. âThrough the Wireâ would first appear on 2003âs Get Well Soon... mixtape alongside songs that would become future releases of Kanye-as-rapper, including âJesus Walks.â West shelled out $35,000 of his own money, shot the video himself and, rather than choosing to premiere it in his hometown of Chicago, the video was shown in Jayâs 40/40 Club, New York City, in the November of 2003.\n\nWith an awareness of (and perhaps sentimentality towards) his early audience, and of how to maximise the critical reception and monetization of his music as product, it was the first of many moves from the Kanye who spent three summers locked away making beats, to the present day manifestation of Kanye as superstar.\n\nWestâs aesthetic imperative has been evident from the jump. His appearances on the 2004 Video Music Awards and the 2005 Grammy Awards were the first of many line-blurring exercises between what constitutes a music video and a live performance.\n\nDuring the 2004 Video Music Awards, Chaka Khan (sampled on âThrough the Wireâ), John Legend and Syleena Johnson joined West onstage for a three-track medley. The curation of talent which would become a recurring theme of Westâs live performances and studio recordings was clear: the linearity of âJesus Walksâ is repeatedly cut into with shots of a proud Jay-Z, BeyoncÃ© and Queen Latifah, sat in the audience as West is followed by a 32-strong choir through the crowd, all in-shot and holding lit candles.\n\nFor the 2005 Grammy Awards, forcing the audience into âacting like yâall never seen a ghost or something,â he emerges from a chapel backdrop for the resurrection of a winged Yeezus; a choir procession grieves over him, accompanied by the hymn âIâll Fly Away,â led by John Legend. Moments before, a dancing silhouette, unmistakably West, falls onto a praying angel, and a screech of tires and crunch of steel hark to The Accident.\n\nA projection of doves and a time-lapse of rushing clouds dominate the stage-as-set, taken directly from the end of the first of the music videos and with the enduring emblem of the second: West all haloed up in a wooden box, his coffin.\n\nSince the patent, the impact of each premiere has gradually become more and more embedded with commerciality. Like Jay-Z, too, Westâs commerciality in turn is embedded with the aim of singular creative control, but to manoeuvre himself into a position to demand it, he needed a foothold of proven quality and access to knowledge of the industry. (In his time at Nike, interning at Italian clothing brand Fendi and the potential of an impending Apple Music co-sign, heâs closer than ever to one of his idols, Steve Jobs.) The patent, then, has become one such manoeuvre: live, in play and repeated.\n\nBeyond the investment, these multi-screen performances have become effortlessly re-watchable, too. Performances such as those on Saturday Night Live are no longer just consumed live, with the majority of views now after the fact. The effect of this becomes its longevity: if the performance hasnât provided lasting talking points, itâs failed. Part of this live development is that West has become increasingly selective about who is allowed to occupy his personal, performative space.\n\nThe light flickers at the mention of Donda, and the opening chords chime. The tiptoeing backwards, reaching for the light switch, is a personal solar system in gentle spin, acting as vessel between mother and daughter. (Ross does his utmost to disrupt the space, though, by lying on the floor and making jokes about Westâs wife, Kim. The weight of the experience and symbolism seems lost on him.)\n\nAlong with the thunder, the flickers are reminiscent of Steven Spielbergâs 1982 film Poltergeist, in which TV sets and windows frame the howling of the dead. The light box is stage, vessel and coffin at once, for a figure so often torn between life, death and the chance of re-birth.\n\nThe introduction of the light box into his live performances, in its monochromatic starkness, also signalled a shift in emotion, attitude and taste. Before DONDA and the patent came his fifth LP, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy; the release, promotion and tour for which was awash with striking colors that made up four, George Condo-painted album sleeves, including his favourite red (a dominant, âThrillerâ jacket-shade that evokes a satisfyingly grandiose pop culture familiarity). Heâd rock this in his âPowerâ performance on Saturday Night Live, in red leather apparel and his own Nike Red Octobers, against subtle shades of silver and gold.\n\nPost-DONDA, the color is stripped away. The lead single of Yeezus, âNew Slaves,â was premiered through a guerrilla-style marketing campaign; projecting his face onto 66 buildings around the world with only a few hours notice. With each rushed assembly unsure of what to expect, the close up of Westâs face with those uncensored lyrics, of his role on a planet dominated by white supremacy, the projection as performance rendered the sonic and visual stark and inseparable.\n\nPhotographer Nick Knight co-directed the charged âBlack Skinheadâ video and remained a key part of its promotional campaign. In a press release accompanying the projections, itâs outlined how Knight worked on the âNew Slavesâ visuals, âexperienced by millions across the globe via guerrilla outdoor projections and online viral capturesâ. The latter feels of particular importance. Through people sharing their own recordings of it, the song and video were premiered to the world: a unique viral marketing project and a far cry from dropping it on a VEVO account.\n\nCompared to the interactive music video, the âBlack Skinheadâ performance on Saturday Night Live is, at key moments, barely indistinguishable from the former. The Dobermans are back from the âJesus Walksâ video, this time as a three-headed Cerberus; eyes so white theyâre iridescent, their barking syncing intermittently with the heavily rumoured sample (then mysteriously cut from the credits) of âThe Beautiful Peopleâ by Marilyn Manson, the industrial kick drums leading the charge. A silhouette bounces on his toes like a boxer before a clash, the stage bathed in flickering ambers, oranges and reds as price labels scroll through the backdrop; occasionally fixating on a âNOT FOR SALEâ sign, mirroring his lyrics: âWant me to stay at ease / fuck you and your corporation, yâall ni**as canât control me.â\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan hoods would be incorporated into the backdrop for the Saturday Night Live performance, but in black as opposed to white. Flipping the imagery of white power is a theme that West loves to revisit. In the Nick Knight-directed video for âBound 2,â Westâs initial idea of âwhite-trash T-shirtsâ bursts into technicolor; majestic stallions, a Harley Davidson motorcycle, he and Kim clad in all American double-denim (a style revisited in the video for âFourFiveSecondsâ).\n\nThese are themes depicted by American white supremacist imagery, with a difference: with West repeatedly referring to himself as a God. In caring that the structures of power reinforced by white supremacy are not typically associated with people that look like him, heâs attempting to change the way his audience processes these images.\n\nIn taking these risks, though, he is not without his problems. In flipping the âwhite trash t-shirtsâ for the Yeezus tour merchandise he would use the Confederate flag, a symbol that carries a painful and loaded history. Heâs deliberately positioning himself as vulnerable to criticism: on a tectonic fault line, with tremors ominous and imminent.\n\nThe Yeezus LP credits read like a film end-reel, from Mike Dean to Evian Christ, Arca to King Louie. Cathleen Cher, who worked on the Yeezus tourâs creative process, believes that West âhas a knack for sourcing diverse groups of top-notch creative talent to help him develop and realize his visions. Even more noteworthy is the trust he has in these people. He listens and respects peoplesâ opinions and truly believes in their abilities. He is eager to learn from them, and puts people together in a way that forces them to learn from each other. He understands the necessity of collaboration: Iâve heard him humbly state a number of times that âEverybody needs helpâ.â\n\nWhen you unpack the fact that the LPâs name was meant to be read as âYe Is Us,â and with Cherâs words re-applied to the recording process, the papyrus scroll of idiosyncrasy continues to unravel. âOne of the most recognized and most parodied songs on the album, âI Am A God,â was specifically written in hopes that those who listen to it will sing along and say those exact words: âI am a Godâ â a misinterpreted attempt to instil confidence,â says Cher.\n\nâMostly unnoticed, the very first audible sensation that the audience is exposed to is Mozartâs Requiem played backwards. Symbolic of the unease in which the show starts, this same piece is replayed forward in its recognizable state at the end of the show â a point when the mood takes a turn for the better; and the section of the show that is supposed to reflect Kanyeâs life in the present day.â\n\nWhen West chooses someone to occupy his personal space, it goes deep. Virgil Abloh is DONDAâs creative director. After the two met in their hometown of Chicago in 2002, Abloh graduated in 2005 with an architecture and design degree and joined West in Los Angeles to work on the DONDA project, alongside his DJing and OFF/WHITE clothing line. The 2010 Runaway film began as an idea between West and Abloh after exchanging movie stills, and before the writing and recording of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\n\nShot in Prague, Runaway tells the story of Griffin (played by West) and a fallen phoenix (played by Selita Ebanks). In not accepting the ways in which humanity treats eccentricity and difference, the phoenix escapes the planet and leaves Griffin haplessly headed towards the jet stream. The film shares themes with the âPowerâ music video: filmed in a single shot video tableau, a moving painting that slowly reveals itself to the viewer with continuous camera movement.\n\nâWalked away inspired by his wordsâ is something that British grime MC Skepta touches on in his 2015 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, after describing the time he spent with West after Ablohâs introduction: that the most important thing is âto make the world better so that the younger generation, those that look up to you, donât have to go through what we went through.â Discussion is the motivation and lasting change is the goal, with the music as by-product: West was already in the UK working on his seventh LP SWISH when he was due to perform at the 2015 BRIT Awards.\n\nGrime has nearly always had a bad press in the UK, since it often reflects society's racial insecurities back onto itself. More recently, it's been exacerbated with the enforcement of Form 696 (explained in this short film for Noisey by Skeptaâs brother and fellow grime MC, JME). Since the genre has long struggled to exist visibly, for some of its key players to be on stage at the BRITs was to take it to a level barely possible before â and not without West. (An hour or two before the gig, Virgil sent a text to Skepta saying that West wanted Skepta and his â30 goonsâ on stage with him.) That dozens of black men, in all black everything, invaded a space expected for one and typically given to whites, positioned West as a vessel for visibility and change in an industry tangled with disturbing racial undercurrents.\n\nAfterwards, grime star Wiley summed it up best: âKanye West opened a door thatâs closed to most of us. There's no way or JME or or Stormzy were gonna get onstage without Kanye doing that. The doors are still shut in a way, and what he did wonât just happen again next year, but people will be more open-minded about the people he got into the building and onstage.â\n\nThe shock of the BRITs performance was also perhaps in part a response to the jumbled lead-up to âAll Dayâ emerging into the world. In the August of 2014, a strange, minute-long recording of âAll Dayâ was leaked (an unplanned leak, too, unlike the âNew Slavesâ campaign). On December 1st, the leak was edited by an unknown source to become a second, longer, âphantomâ leak, which caused Twitter to blow up for a matter of hours before being dispelled by âexpertsâ (listed as a radio rip, but with no DJ shouting over it). The BRITs performance came with no âBlack Skinheadâ-style press release, no indication of what track he was going to play, no prior warnings. The themes behind SWISH were (and largely are) still a mystery.\n\nUnusual as it is for an artist to premiere the full version of a new track live on an awards show - in most instances, the performance is of the biggest hit the artist has had in the past year â it didnât deter West. The uncensored recording from the BRITs performance would become the official music video, now on YouTube, accompanied by two mammoth flamethrowers that could scorch the o-zone layer and made Lionel Richieâs face do this.\n\nA recurring motif in Westâs televised performances is less of how the camera pans across and acknowledges the audience as he performs: more specifically, itâs of whom the camera chooses to focus on. The looks of low-key shock and indifference from Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Jessie Ware and Daniel Radcliffe flipped the portrait of the onstage energies so hard that they inspired the bridge-sample of Skeptaâs â â#SHUTDOWNâ single, which dropped days after the BRITs: âA bunch of young men all dressed in black dancing extremely aggressively on stage, it made me feel so intimidated and it's just not what I expect to see on primetime TV.â That West shouted out Skepta in the final seconds of âAll Day,â in thank you and recognition, tied him to the song-as-spectacle.\n\nLike the performances of âPowerâ on Saturday Night Live and âBound 2â on Later with... Jools Holland (regardless of proximity, theyâre still cast in the dark and remain unacknowledged throughout), the general absence of the audience in shot contributes to the illusion that it is, in fact, a re-watchable music video.\n\nWest has used the audience as a prop before, like during the âBlood on the Leavesâ performance at the Video Music Awards. The intro has the camera fixed on a shot of his face, reminiscent of âNew Slaves,â but after the drop itâs performed silhouetted onto grayscale forest backdrop. The arms trying to reach out to and claw at Wests feet are those of the crowd. With the BRITs performance of âAll Day,â whether or not the broadcasters were told to focus on celebrity reactions is irrelevant.\n\nThe audience was, again, used as a deliberate visual mechanism to enhance a performance for which he knew heâd get a strong reaction. Ralph Lauren and Kim would appear in appreciation, and the camera would often seek out Jay-Z and BeyoncÃ© as key reference points of approval whenever they are in attendance, but this isnât new. The shock and awe of a Lionel Richie is new.\n\nWith West choosing to rap uncensored (an out of character choice, given his penchant for clean edits on American television), broadcasters were caught off guard: the live video on British terrestrial television would have segments where the audio was blanked out. The following May he performed âAll Dayâ again, without a dress rehearsal, at the Billboard Awards. The public and in-house reaction to the BRITs performance lead to the previously uncensored version now being heavily muted throughout the Billboard Awards, which led to criticism of the spectacle overall as opposed to the UK outrage shown at lyrical content. West is, in light of his past performances, a victim of the standards that he and others have placed on him.\n\nIt begs the question that - maybe, with the first fully uncensored edit of an awards show performance of his being hosted in the U.K. - he was using it as a testing ground; before he took the performance back to the States.\n\nItâs a recurring antagonism for him. In an interview with film director Steve McQueen for Interview, West insisted that, âPeople are strategically trying to do things to mute my voice in some way, or make me look like Iâm a lunatic, or pinpoint the inaccuracies in my grammar to somehow take away from the overall message of what Iâm saying.â\n\nâBound 2â on Later with... Jools Holland is equally jaw-dropping in its insularity. The crowd are eye-level and close, as Hollandâs studio set-up dictates, yet hidden in darkness. Both the music video for âBound 2â and this performance share a different intro to the recorded album cut. The Wee - âAeroplane Repriseâ synth sample which plays during Charlie Wilsonâs vocal parts is now an unfiltered piano; Wilson provides his signature adlibs for West, exuding joy at the clean edit. Only when West holds his arms out during the bridge, reviving himself when he changes the lyrics from âJeromeâ (a reference to the â90s TV show Martin) to âUncle Charlieâs in the house, watch ya mouth,â does he acknowledge, like during the BRITs, who heâs thankful to be with.\n\nSimilar to the ways in which Michael Jackson redefined how pop fans thought about music performance on television, with developed storylines and bold cinematography, Westâs shorter music videos feel more like art installations: attempting to redesign the lens through which people view music videos, allowing for a wider scope for others to follow suit, and through working with one main visual collaborator over the course of an album (Nick Knight on Yeezus, Nabil Elderkin on 808s & Heartbreaks and most recently Spike Jonze, with a simplicity that he has on lock, like a smart-phone portrait orientation, for SWISH).\n\nNone of the above relationships, though, compare to the one that West has with Mike Dean, a classically trained musician who made his name producing for Selena and Pimp C. Since his first involvement in Westâs 2004 release âTwo Words,â his role as West's âmusic directorâ cannot be understated. In an interview with NPR, as well as touching on the studio sessions in which Nicki Minaj and West co-wrote her âMonsterâ verse, he refers to himself and West as being âlike a band for good.â\n\nAfter becoming frustrated at the experience of seeing others perform poorly onstage with West, Dean took it upon himself to replace them on keys and guitar, alongside another keyboardist and a DJ on Serato. With Tony Williams on back-up vocals (a first cousin of Westâs, who has featured on at least four tracks per each album since The College Dropout) and Bon Iverâs Justin Vernon, this completed the setup at last weekâs Glastonbury 2015 headline set.\n\nThe set-up was characteristic of his light box; a colossal platform harnessing a square grid of spotlights above, reminiscent of a performance of âOnly Oneâ on Scandinavian channel Skavlan; illuminating fog and smoke in pre-set harmony. Midway through âTouch The Skyâ West would tell Dean to stop the track, reappearing soon after on an illuminated, crane platform similar to his Coachella performance in 2011; soaring above the crowd to a euphoric crowd led âSky high / Iâm, Iâm sky high.â (The move feels like a knowing nod to Michael Jackson, who used it for the first time during his 1996-97 tour, for âBeat Itâ and âEarth Song.â)\n\nPreferring live instrumentation, Dean balances out Westâs sampling background. Symbolised by his penchant to play the MPC during âRunawayâ and elaborating on existing samples, it becomes another creature entirely; fitting the new, industrial, more unfiltered edits of Yeezus and their live performances. (The live version of âColdâ features the Foreigner sample of âCold As Ice,â with Dean on a screaming guitar hook.) Whenever rock star Kanye West is on stage, purposefully alone, Dean is orchestrating behind the scenes.\n\nAs the lights went out on the Pyramid stage, Westâs auteurism both divided and confirmed his long-term goal of the multi-faceted live experience. He creates music videos with live performances in mind â and then flips them back on themselves for the highest social and monetary impact. With the growth of the later he can go further and create, collaborating with an array of curated, trusted thinkers. With all of this, and most vividly in moments of adversity, Kanye West creates art within a brutally self-carved enclave â and when he thrives, he exhales loudly: âBut I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph / Make music that's fire, spit my soul.â"
