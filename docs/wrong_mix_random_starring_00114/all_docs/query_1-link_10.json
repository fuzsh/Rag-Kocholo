        "text": "A chance meeting changed Rihanna's life.\n\nThe singer was just 15 years old when she met producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing with his wife in Barbados. Rogers recognized Rihanna's potential, and invited her to an audition in his hotel suite.\n\nShortly after her 16th birthday, Rihanna left her home country for the U.S. to record a demo, which included her breakthrough hit \"Pon de Replay.\" The demo found its way into Jay-Z's hands, and Hov signed the teen artist to Def Jam and the label expedited her 2005 debut album, aptly titled Music of the Sun.\n\n\"When I left Barbados, I didn't look back,\" Rihanna told Entertainment Weekly in 2007. \"I wanted to do what I had to do [to succeed], even if it meant moving to America.\"\n\nTwenty years later, Rihanna is a renowned entertainer-turned-mogul. She has sold over 40 million albums worldwide, garnered over 12 billion Spotify streams, achieved 14 Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers, and won nine GRAMMY Awards. Even her business ventures have been a massive success, as her Fenty Beauty brand is worth $2.8 billion.\n\nThough it's been close to a decade since Rihanna's last studio album, 2016's ANTI, she reminded the world of her reign with her 2023 Super Bowl halftime show — which also marked her first time taking the stage in five years. Performing hit after hit while unveiling a baby bump, her 13-minute set became one of the most-watched halftime shows of all time with over 121 million viewers.\n\nIn honor of Rihanna's 36th birthday on Feb. 20, GRAMMY.com is revisiting the monstrous hits, ambitious projects, brow-raising visuals, and iconic collabs that propelled her to international stardom — and why it's all put her in a league of her own.\n\nA New Island Girl In Town\n\nTrue to her Carribean heritage, Rihanna's dancehall-inspired debut single \"Pon de Replay\" earned the then 17-year-old Barbados native her first entry on the Hot 100 at an impressive No. 2. Her official introduction to the world also hit No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart; she boasts 33 on the tally, second behind only the Queen of Pop herself, Madonna.\n\nFollow-up single \"If It's Lovin' That You Want\" stalled at No. 36 on the Hot 100, but still whetted fans' appetite — as did her debut album, Music of the Sun, which is mostly comprised of dance-pop and dancehall tracks with hints of R&B (like \"Willing to Wait\"). Plus, her reimagining of Dawn Penn's 1994 reggae classic \"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\" is still so fun to listen to after all these years.\n\nA mere eight months later, Rihanna's sophomore effort, 2006's A Girl Like Me, arrived to an eager audience. Defying the sophomore slump, she celebrated her first No. 1 with the ubiquitous lead single \"SOS,\" which famously samples Soft Cell's 1981 hit, \"Tainted Love.\" While A Girl Like Me is filled with high-energy, danceable tracks (including the nostalgic \"Break It Off\" with Sean Paul), Rihanna's second single was the melodramatic ballad \"Unfaithful.\"\n\nPenned by then-labelmate Ne-Yo, \"Unfaithful\" peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100. More importantly, it showed a different side to Rihanna, proving that she could channel deep emotion when the performance calls for it. It also marked Rihanna's first time veering away from her \"girl next door\" image, as the song's subject matter deals with infidelity.\n\nA Girl Like Me contains many fan favorites, from the laid-back \"We Ride\" to standouts \"Dem Haters\" and \"Kisses Don't Lie.\" The latter is a reggae-rock hybrid that sounds like a catalyst for some of Rihanna's edgier tunes like \"Breakin' Dishes\" from 2007's Good Girl Gone Bad era. Touching ballads\"Final Goodbye\" and \"A Million Miles Away\" showcase her voice beautifully, foreshadowing later big-vocal numbers like \"Love on the Brain.\"\n\nAn Icon In The Making\n\nRihanna was a familiar face by 2007, but with the arrival of her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad, she graduated from cookie-cutter pop star to bonafide icon.\n\nProduced by Tricky Stewart, the LP's juggernaut lead single \"Umbrella\" featuring Jay-Z skyrocketed to No. 1 in 17 countries. Between striking images of Rihanna's silver-painted silhouette in the accompanying video and the now-iconic \"ella-ella, eh, eh, eh\" hook, \"Umbrella\" thrust the then 19-year-old into another stratosphere. Her confident delivery also commanded attention in a way fans and critics hadn't heard before.\n\nThe transformative era also birthed the gritty \"Shut Up and Drive,\" on which Rihanna channels her inner rock star. The next two singles cracked the top 10: an affectionate duet with Ne-Yo, \"Hate That I Love You,\" which showed off Rihanna's softer side, and the party-starting, Michael Jackson-sampling \"Don't Stop the Music,\" which cemented her place in the digital era.\n\nThe melancholy \"Rehab\" is a clever metaphor for lost love, co-written by Timbaland and Justin Timberlake. Despite being Good Girl Gone Bad's lowest-charting single, Timberlake heralded the song as \"the bridge for her to be accepted as an adult in the music industry.\"\n\nGood Girl Gone Bad remains Rihanna's best-selling album and marks her greatest reinvention as she adopted a more rebellious sound. She also won her first GRAMMY in 2008 (Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Umbrella\") and scored four other nominations, including Record Of The Year. The album's reissue spawned two more No. 1s: \"Take a Bow\" and \"Disturbia,\" the latter of which acts like a prelude to Rated R, which saw Rihanna exploring darker themes.\n\nNine months before the release of 2009's Rated R, Rihanna was assaulted by then-boyfriend Chris Brown. On the deeply personal album, she translated her pain into art. Through lead single \"Russian Roulette\" and bitingly catchy anthems \"Stupid in Love,\" \"Fire Bomb,\" \"Photographs,\" \"Cold Case Love,\" and \"The Last Song,\" Rihanna explored her angst and confusion.\n\nBut to focus solely on the domestic violence incident undermines Rihanna's artistic vision.\n\nFollowing three multi-platinum albums in a three-year span, Rihanna's rebranding as a rebel at heart reached its apex. The singer had grown in leaps and bounds while taking musical risks, even penning nine of Rated R's 13 tracks (she had no writing credits on Good Girl Gone Bad).\n\nThe road to Rihanna's most badass anthems — including \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" — can be traced back to Rated R. Case in point: Her bravado is loud and clear on \"Hard,\" \"Wait Your Turn,\" and \"G4L.\" On \"Rockstar 101,\" which features legendary rocker Slash, Rihanna declares her power: \"Six inch walker/ Big sh— talker/ I never play the victim/ I'd rather be a stalker.\"\n\nBadgal RiRi returned to her dancehall roots on her fifth No. 1 \"Rude Boy,\" which offsets the album's harrowing motif. Final single \"Te Amo\" didn't chart, but garnered a great deal of attention as the Latin-infused Stargate production depicts Rihanna being enticed by a female love interest.\n\nRated R showcased Rihanna's undeniable star power, and allowed her to shed her good-girl image once and for all.\n\nA Partygoer's Dream\n\nFollowing the career-pivoting Rated R, 2010's Loud offered a welcome return to the West Indian artist's earlier sound. The album feels like one big celebration of life, as evidenced by Rihanna's fire-engine red hair and No. 1 singles \"Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"What's My Name?\" (the latter of which was Rih's first collaboration with Drake).\n\nBest described as \"Don't Stop the Music\" 2.0, the effervescent \"Only Girl\" marked her eminent return to the dance floor and took home a GRAMMY for Best Dance Recording in 2011. While \"What's My Name?\" may not outshine Rih and Drizzy's other collabs — including 2011's \"Take Care\" or 2016's \"Work\" — the second she sings, \"Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me,\" it's impossible not to whine your waist to the riddim.\n\nEasily one of Rihanna's most overlooked hits, \"Cheers (Drink to That)\" is built around an unexpected sample of Avril Lavigne's 2002 hit \"I'm With You,\" but it works surprisingly well as a party anthem. That same carefree spirit can be heard in the feminist track \"Raining Men,\" which features Nicki Minaj — their first of two collabs, as they joined forces again for \"Fly,\" the final single off the rapper's iconic Pink Friday album.\n\nA playful ode to sadomasochism and bondage, \"S&M\" contains some of Rihanna's most provocative lyrics: \"Sticks and stones may break my bones/ But chains and whips excite me,\" she declares on the chorus.\n\nBanned in 11 countries upon its release, the accompanying video features Rihanna tied up in pink rope, dancing with a blowup doll, and donning a Playboy bunny-esque costume as damning newsreels about herself flash across the screen. But Rihanna's love of kink made her an even bigger star: \"S&M\" produced a remix with Britney Spears and earned Rihanna her 10th No. 1 single. With this feat, she became the youngest artist to attain the most chart-toppers in a five-year span.\n\nOn \"Man Down,\" Rihanna's patois is in full effect as she takes listeners through a gripping tale about murdering her abuser. \"What started out as a simple altercation/ Turned into a real sticky situation,\" she laments in the opening verse, amplified by siren noises in the background. There's something so satisfying about Rihanna's Bajan accent as she unfurls \"Rum-pum-pum-pum\" repeatedly over an intensifying reggae beat that would make Sister Nancy and Bob Marley proud.\n\nNominated for Album Of The Year at the 2021 GRAMMYs, Loud is Rihanna's second most commercially successful LP — and for good reason. It was especially refreshing to see Rihanna emerge from one of the darkest periods of her life as exuberant as ever.\n\nAn Unapologetic Queen\n\nSonically and thematically, Talk That Talk doesn't break new ground, but Rih's DGAF attitude is front and center with plenty of sexual innuendos: Songs like \"S&M\" and \"Rude Boy\" seem pretty tame next to \"Cockiness (Love It),\" which features longtime friend-turned-boyfriend A$AP Rocky on its remix. \"Suck my cockiness/ Lick my persuasion/ Eat my poison/ And swallow your pride down, down,\" she commands in the tantalizing chorus.\n\nAt just over a minute long, \"Birthday Cake\" leaves nothing to the imagination (\"It's not even my birthday, but he wanna lick the icing off\"). Rihanna controversially released a full-length version in the form of a remix with Chris Brown.\n\nOn an album that mostly sees Rihanna singing about her sexual fantasies, \"We All Want Love\" pulls back the curtain as it reveals her desire for true love: \"And some say love ain't worth the buck/ But I'll give my last dime/ To have what I've only been dreaming about.\"\n\nHer longing continues in \"Where Have You Been,\" which flaunts Rihanna's versatility, flipping Geoff Mack's 1959 country song \"I've Been Everywhere\" into an infectious EDM banger. Lead single \"We Found Love\" is undeniably the biggest hit to stem from the Talk That Talk era, spending 10 consecutive weeks atop the Hot 100.\n\nBoosting Calvin Harris' career, \"We Found Love\" presents one juxtaposition after the other: dark yet gleaming, euphoric yet sobering, fraught yet hopeful. Rihanna relies on more than just evocative lyrics to tell her story; accompanying synthesizers and alarm bells help to paint a picture as well. Met with controversy, its intense visuals portraying a drug-fueled, toxic relationship — and featuringwhat many speculated was a Chris Brown look-alike — earned RiRi a GRAMMY for Best Long Form Music Video in 2013.\n\nSeven years into an already extraordinary career, 2012's Unapologetic became Rihanna's first album to debut at No. 1 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart. Its lead single \"Diamonds\" resonated in an equally major way, giving Rih her 12th No. 1 on the Hot 100.\n\nWritten by Sia, the power ballad kicked off another exciting era for the Barbadian singer, who unleashes an impassioned vocal performance. One of Rihanna's most precious offerings to date, \"Diamonds\" emerged as a self-love mantra due to its uplifting \"Shine bright like a diamond\" chant.\n\nVocally, Rihanna's strength lies in her ability to evoke raw emotion à la \"Stay.\" Featuring Mikky Ekko, the stripped-down, slow-burning piano ballad narrowly missed the top spot on the Hot 100 but gave Rihanna her 24th top 10 hit, surpassing Whitney Houston's record of 23 in 2013.\n\nHer swagger is boisterous in \"Phresh Out the Runway,\" \"Jump,\" and strip club anthem \"Pour It Up,\" but \"Nobody's Business\" really drives home the album's theme of being unbothered. Her decision to join forces with Chris Brown yet again perplexed fans and critics alike, though the track itself is an irresistible production that features a genius interpolation of Michael Jackson's \"The Way You Make Me Feel.\"\n\nFurther down the track list, \"Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary\" is as autobiographical as it gets, and further taps into Rihanna's emotionally vulnerable side. \"Mr. Jesus, I'd love to be a queen/ But I'm from the left side of an island/ Never thought this many people would even know my name,\" she pleads in the seven-minute two-parter.\n\nUnapologetic spawned fewer hit singles compared to Rihanna's previous efforts. Its win for Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2014 GRAMMYs, however, proved that Rihanna's reign wasn't letting up anytime soon.\n\nWhile recording her then-forthcoming album, ANTI, Rihanna delivered what is arguably the single most unapologetic moment of her career: \"Bitch Better Have My Money.\" The backstory is almost inconceivable given Rihanna's awe-inspiring billionaire status, but in 2009, Rihanna faced bankruptcy due to her accountants mishandling her funds — and thus \"Bitch\" was born six years later in 2015.\n\nWith lyrics like \"Your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car\" over a cryptic-sounding trap beat and an accompanying video depicting kidnapping and torturing her debtors, \"Bitch\" is not for the faint-hearted. The one-off single is so quintessentially Rihanna that it notably kicked off her Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nAn In-Demand Collaborator\n\nWhile bestowing hit after hit on her own, Rihanna generously lent her distinct voice to some of her biggest peers. 2008 marks one of the earliest instances of her Midas touch: She flirts with funk in Maroon 5's underappreciated \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" before hopping on T.I.'s \"Live Your Life,\" which shot straight to No. 1 on the Hot 100.\n\nIn 2009, Rihanna joined Jay-Z and Kanye West for the militant \"Run This Town,\" sounding defiant as ever in the intro. She was called upon again for West's horn-laden \"All of the Lights,\" flying solo on the hook followed by a star-studded choir that included Alicia Keys, John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John. Both larger-than-life productions won GRAMMYs for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2010 and 2012, respectively.\n\nIn between joining forces with Hov and Ye, Rihanna assisted Eminem in \"Love the Way You Lie,\" which struck a nerve with many for its gut-wrenching lyrics shedding a light on abusive relationships. (Rih recorded an equally moving sequel for her Loud album.) Three years later, the two confronted their inner demons in \"The Monster,\" and their musical chemistry scored a GRAMMY in 2015 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.\n\nAmid smash collabs, Rihanna and Coldplay's intricate \"Princess of China\" number gets lost in the shuffle, but it speaks to her charm as it's the band's first album (2011's Mylo Xyloto) to feature another artist. Another overlooked jam, her sultry \"Can't Remember to Forget You\" duet with Shakira sees both stars trade lines about struggling to let go of an undeserving lover.\n\nOn paper, a collaboration between Rihanna, Kanye West, and Sir Paul McCartney may seem strange, but the unlikely trio is further proof that opposites attract. Their \"FourFiveSeconds\" is a pop-folk hybrid with a universal message about carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. It's yet another example of Rihanna's willingness to push past her comfort zone to create something unique.\n\nA year later, Rihanna got listeners on their feet by way of the Taylor Swift-penned \"This Is What You Came For\" with Calvin Harris. Understated compared to the duo's previous megahits (\"We Found Love\" and \"Where Have You Been\"), Harris' signature DJing style and Rih's ethereal vocals are a perfect match.\n\nIn 2017, Rih, DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller dropped the song of the summer with \"Wild Thoughts,\" which heavily borrows from Carlos Santana's 1999 GRAMMY-winning \"Maria Maria.\" It may be DJ Khaled's song, but RiRi owns it from the very moment she utters, \"I don't know if you could take it/ Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked.\" The bop reached No. 2 on the Hot 100.\n\nShe spits bars in Kendrick Lamar's \"Loyalty\" and \"Lemon\" with N.E.R.D., the latter of which comes close to rivaling your favorite rappers' verses: \"You can catch me, Rih, in the new La Ferrar'/ And the truck behind me got arms/ Yeah, longer than LeBron/ Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz.\"\n\nNo matter what genre Rihanna touches or what artist she links up with, she brings her full self to each session whilst completely immersing herself into the music — taking on different personas to make the collab well worth it.\n\nAn Artist Fully Realized\n\nWith 13 No. 1s and twice as many top 10 hits under her belt, Rihanna set out to create timeless music instead of chasing a radio-friendly formula with her 2016 magnum opus, ANTI.\n\nBut that shift began with 2015's criminally underrated \"American Oxygen.\" Her most political statement at the time, the goosebump-inducing lyrics detail Rihanna's journey as an immigrant, foreshadowing her then soon-to-be massive Fenty Beauty success. \"We sweat for a nickel and a dime/ Turn it into an empire,\" she sings in the chorus.\n\nReleased four years after Unapologetic — her longest gap between albums at the time — ANTI illustrated Rihanna's greater desire for quality over quantity. \"I needed the music to match my growth,\" she told Vogue in 2016 about the making of ANTI. \"I didn't want to get caught up with anything the world liked, anything the radio liked, anything that I liked, that I've already heard. I just wanted it to be me.\"\n\nThe black-and-white, red paint-splattered album cover signals a rebirth, featuring a real-life image of Rihanna as a child. ANTI lives up to its name in its first 40 seconds, via opening track \"Consideration.\" The minute she declares, \"I got to do things my own way, darling,\" it's apparent that ANTI is not your average Rihanna album.\n\nLead single \"Work\" is the closest to pre-ANTI Rihanna on an album that defies expectations. But the dancehall masterpiece is one of a kind for Rih's refusal to water down the Jamaican patois (different from her native language of Bajan Creole) — proving that she is fully aware of her impact as one of the biggest Caribbean-born artists to make it in the U.S.\n\nMany non-understanding listeners described it as \"gibberish\" at the time. Yet, the general public didn't seem to mind: About a month after its release, \"Work\" became Rihanna's 14th and longest-running chart-topper on the Hot 100. Weeks later, ANTI became her second LP to top the Billboard 200 chart. Subsequently, Rihanna held the No. 1 spots on the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 simultaneously, her second time achieving such an impressive feat.\n\nRead More: How Rihanna's \"Work\" Reinvigorated Dancehall\n\nANTI is full of pleasant surprises that show off her artistry. Rihanna comes out of left field with the Prince-inspired \"Kiss It Better,\" the album's second single, which sees the superstar falling back on addictive sex that \"feels like crack\" to justify a destructive relationship. \"Same Ol' Mistakes\" is a cover of psychedelic rock band Tame Impala's \"New Person, Same Old Mistakes\" — her first time remaking another artist's song for her own album since \"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\" on Music of the Sun. The Western-themed \"Desperado\" lends itself particularly well to covers by country artists, while the Dido-sampling \"Never Ending\" conveys the uncertainty she feels about entering a new relationship.\n\nElsewhere on ANTI, Rihanna drunk dials an ex (\"Higher\"), compares smoking weed to her lover (\"James Joint\"), and chastises a guy for getting emotionally attached after their fling (\"Needed Me\"). The latter song contains one of Rihanna's most empowering lyrics: \"Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?/ F— ya white horse and ya carriage,\" she asserts in the pre-chorus.\n\nHer voice sounds stronger than ever on \"Love on the Brain,\" a doo-wop ballad resembling Etta James. But Rihanna makes it her own thanks to the bluntness of lines like \"It beats me black and blue but it f— me so good.\"\n\nThe deep cuts on ANTI aren't merely fillers, and even rival some of the album's biggest hits. For instance, \"Sex with Me\" is featured on the deluxe edition as a bonus track, but managed to crack the Hot 100 at No. 83 and reach No. 8 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. Furthermore, the deluxe edition consists of 16 tracks, half of which topped the Dance Club Songs chart — smashing the record (previously held by Katy Perry's Teenage Dream) for the most No. 1s from a single album.\n\nAccolades aside, ANTI is proof that magic happens when an artist of Rihanna's caliber follows their own instincts in pursuit of creating a body of work — one that can outlast them and continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nEver since ANTI, Rihanna's devoted fanbase has been begging for a new album, with Rih playfully trolling them with responses like \"I lost it\" and Instagram captions that read, \"Me listening to R9 by myself and refusing to release it.\"\n\nHer much-awaited return to music came at the tail end of 2022. The hitmaker twice contributed to the GRAMMY-nominated Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack: \"Born Again\" and \"Lift Me Up,\" the latter of which helped Rihanna score her first Oscar and Golden Globe nominations in 2022 and 2023, respectively. With the glorious \"Lift Me Up,\" she found herself in the top 10 for the first time since 2017's \"Wild Thoughts.\"\n\nWhile the world is still anticipating her ninth studio album, Rihanna — now a mom of two boys — continues to make her own rules and move at her own pace. But as she's proven time and time again, it's always worth the wait.\n\nThe Rihanna Essentials: 15 Singles To Celebrate The Singer's Endless Pop Reign\n\nIn the world of hip-hop, fashion is more than just clothing. It's a powerful means of self-expression, a cultural statement, and a reflection of the ever-evolving nature of the culture.\n\nSince its origin in 1973, hip-hop has been synonymous with style — but the epochal music category known for breakbeats and lyrical flex also elevated, impacted, and revolutionized global fashion in a way no other genre ever has.\n\nReal hip-hop heads know this. Before Cardi B was gracing the Met Gala in Mugler and award show red carpets in custom Schiaparelli, Dapper Dan was disassembling garment bags in his Harlem studio in the 1980s, tailoring legendary looks for rappers that would appear on famous album cover art. Crescendo moments like Kendrick Lamar’s performance at the Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2023 runway show in Paris in June 2022 didn’t happen without a storied trajectory toward the runway.\n\nBig fashion moments in hip-hop have always captured the camera flash, but finding space to tell the bigger story of hip-hop’s connection and influence on fashion has not been without struggle. Journalist and author Sowmya Krishnamurphy said plenty of publishers passed on her anthology on the subject, Fashion Killa: How Hip-Hop Revolutionized High Fashion, and \"the idea of hip hop fashion warranting 80,000 words.\"\n\n\"They didn't think it was big enough or culturally important,\" Krishnamurphy tells GRAMMY.com, \"and of course, when I tell people that usually, the reaction is they're shocked.\"\n\nYet, at the 50 year anniversary, sands continue to shift swiftly. Last year exhibitions like the Fashion Institute of Technology’s Fresh, Fly, and Fabulous: Fifty Years of Hip-Hop Style popped up alongside notable publishing releases including journalist Vikki Tobak’s, Ice Cold. A Hip-Hop Jewelry Story. Tabak’s second published release covering hip-hop’s influence on style, following her 2018 title, Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop.\n\n\"I wanted to go deeper into the history,\" Krishnamurphy continues. \"The psychology, the sociology, all of these important factors that played a role in the rise of hip-hop and the rise of hip-hop fashion\"\n\nWhat do the next 50 years look like? \"I would love to see a hip-hop brand, whether it be from an artist, a designer, creative director, somebody from the hip-hop space, become that next great American heritage brand,\" said Krishnamurphy.\n\nIn order to look forward we have to look back. In celebration of hip-hop’s 50 year legacy, GRAMMY.com examines iconic moments that have defined and inspired generations. From Tupac walking the runways at Versace to Gucci's inception-esque knockoff of Dapper Dan, these moments in hip-hop fashion showcase how artists have used clothing, jewelry, accessories, and personal style to shape the culture and leave an indelible mark on the world.\n\n*The cover art to Eric B and Rakim’s* Paid in Full\n\nDapper Dan And Logomania: Luxury + High Fashion Streetwear\n\nDapper Dan, the legendary designer known as \"the king of knock-offs,\" played a pivotal role in transforming luxury fashion into a symbol of empowerment and resistance for hip-hop stars, hustlers, and athletes starting in the 1980s. His Harlem boutique, famously open 24 hours a day, became a hub where high fashion collided with the grit of the streets.\n\nDapper Dan's customized, tailored outfits, crafted from deconstructed and transformed luxury items, often came with significantly higher price tags compared to ready-to-wear luxury fashion. A friend and favorite of artists like LL Cool J and Notorious B.I.G., Dapper Dan created iconic one-of-a-kind looks seen on artists like Eric B and Rakim’s on the cover of their Paid in Full album.\n\nThis fusion, marked by custom pieces emblazoned with designer logos, continues to influence hip-hop high fashion streetwear. His story — which began with endless raids by luxury houses like Fendi, who claimed copyright infringement — would come full circle with brands like Gucci later paying homage to his legacy.\n\nAthleisure Takes Over\n\nHip-hop's intersection with sportswear gave rise to the \"athleisure\" trend in the 1980s and '90s, making tracksuits, sweatshirts, and sneakers everyday attire. This transformation was propelled by iconic figures such as Run-D.M.C. and their association with Adidas, as seen in photoshoots and music videos for tracks like \"My Adidas.\"\n\n*LL Cool J.

This popular headwear became a symbol of casual coolness, popularized by hip-hop pioneers like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C. The simple, round shape and the Kangaroo logo on the front became instantly recognizable, making the Kangol an essential accessory that was synonymous with a laid-back, streetwise style.\n\n*Dr. Dre, comedian T.K.

The Los Angeles Raiders' gear became synonymous with West Coast hip-hop thanks to its association with the group's members Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube, as well as MC Ren.\n\n*Slick Rick in 1991.

His trendsetting signature look — a fistful of gold rings and a neck heavily layered with an array of opulent chains — exuded a sense of grandeur and self-confidence. Slick Rick's bold and flamboyant approach to jewelry and fashion remains a defining element of hip-hop's sartorial history, well documented in Tobak's Ice Cold.\n\nTupac Walks The Versace Runway Show\n\nTupac Shakur's runway appearance at the 1996 Versace runway show was a remarkable and unexpected moment in fashion history. The show was part of Milan Fashion Week, and Versace was known for pushing boundaries and embracing popular culture in their designs. In Fashion Killa, Krishnamurpy documents Shakur's introduction to Gianni Versace and his participation in the 1996 Milan runway show, where he walked arm-in-arm with Kadida Jones.\n\n*TLC. Photo: Tim Roney/Getty Images*\n\nWomen Embrace Oversized Styles\n\nOversized styles during the 1990s were not limited to menswear; many women in hip-hop during this time adopted a \"tomboy\" aesthetic. This trend was exemplified by artists like Aaliyah’s predilection for crop tops paired with oversized pants and outerwear (and iconic outfits like her well-remembered Tommy Hilfiger look.)\n\nMany other female artists donned oversized, menswear-inspired looks, including TLC and their known love for matching outfits featuring baggy overalls, denim, and peeking boxer shorts and Missy Elliott's famous \"trash bag\" suit worn in her 1997 music video for \"The Rain.\" Speaking to Elle Magazine two decades after the original video release Elliot told the magazine that it was a powerful symbol that helped mask her shyness, \"I loved the idea of feeling like a hip hop Michelin woman.\"\n\nDiddy Launches Sean John\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs’ launch of Sean John in 1998 was about more than just clothing. Following the success of other successful sportswear brands by music industry legends like Russell Simmons’ Phat Farm, Sean John further represented a lifestyle and a cultural movement. Inspired by his own fashion sensibilities, Diddy wanted to create elevated clothing that reflected the style and swagger of hip-hop. From tailored suits to sportswear, the brand was known for its bold designs and signature logo, and shared space with other successful brands like Jay-Z’s Rocawear and model Kimora Lee Simmons' brand Baby Phat.\n\n*Lil' Kim.

This iconic moment solidified her close relationship with the fashion designer, and their collaboration played a pivotal role in reshaping the landscape of hip-hop fashion, pushing boundaries and embracing bold, daring styles predating other newsworthy moments like J.Lo’s 2000 appearance in \"The Dress\" at the GRAMMY Awards.\n\nLil Wayne Popularizes \"Bling Bling\"\n\nJuvenile & Lil Wayne's \"Bling Bling\" marked a culturally significant moment. Coined in the late 1990s by Cash Money Records, the term \"bling bling\" became synonymous with the excessive and flashy display of luxury jewelry. Lil Wayne and the wider Cash Money roster celebrated this opulent aesthetic, solidifying the link between hip-hop music and lavish jewelry. As a result, \"bling\" became a cornerstone of hip-hop's visual identity.\n\nJay-Z x Nike Air Force 1\n\nIn 2004, Jay-Z's partnership with Nike produced the iconic \"Roc-A-Fella\" Air Force 1 sneakers, a significant collaboration that helped bridge the worlds of hip-hop and sneaker culture. These limited-edition kicks in white and blue colorways featured the Roc-A-Fella Records logo on the heel and were highly coveted by fans. The collaboration exemplified how hip-hop artists could have a profound impact on sneaker culture and streetwear by putting a unique spin on classic designs. Hova's design lives on in limitless references to fresh white Nike kicks.\n\nDaft Punk and Pharrell Williams.

Designed by Vivienne Westwood, the hat quickly became the talk of the event and social media. A perfect blend of sartorial daring, Pharrell's hat complemented his red Adidas track jacket while accentuating his unique sense of style. An instant fashion moment, the look sparked innumerable memes and, likely, a renewed interest in headwear.\n\nKanye’s Rise & Fall At Adidas (2013-2022)\n\nMuch more than a \"moment,\" the rise and eventual fall of Kanye’s relationship with Adidas, was as documented in a recent investigation by the New York Times. The story begins in 2013 when West and the German sportswear brand agreed to enter a partnership. The collaboration would sell billions of dollars worth of shoes, known as \"Yeezys,\" until West’s anti-semitic, misogynistic, fat-phobic, and other problematic public comments forced the Adidas brand to break from the partnership amid public outrage.\n\nSupreme Drops x Hip-Hop Greats\n\nSupreme, with its limited drops, bold designs, and collaborations with artists like Nas and Wu-Tang Clan, stands as a modern embodiment of hip-hop's influence on streetwear. The brand's ability to create hype, long lines outside its stores, and exclusive artist partnerships underscores the enduring synergy between hip-hop and street fashion.\n\nA$AP Rocky x DIOR\n\nSelf-proclaimed \"Fashion Killa\" A$AP Rocky is a true fashion aficionado. In 2016, the sartorially obsessed musician and rapper became one of the faces of Dior Homme’s fall/winter campaign shot by photographer Willy Vanderperre — an early example of Rocky's many high fashion collaborations with the luxury European brand.\n\nA$AP Rocky's tailored style and impeccable taste for high fashion labels was eloquently enumerated in the track \"Fashion Killa\" from his 2013 debut album Long. Live. ASAP, which namedrops some 36 luxury fashion brands. The music video for \"Fashion Killa\" was co-directed by Virgil Abloh featuring a Supreme jersey-clad Fenty founder, Rihanna long before the two became one of music’s most powerful couples. The track became an anthem for hip-hop’s appreciation for high fashion (and serves as the title for Krishnamurphy’s recently published anthology).\n\n*Cardi B. Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage*\n\nCardi B Wears Vintage Mugler At The 2019 GRAMMYs\n\nCardi B has solidified her \"it girl\" fashion status in 2018 and 2019 with bold and captivating style choices and designer collaborations that consistently turn heads. Her 2019 GRAMMYs red carpet appearance in exaggerated vintage Mugler gown, and many custom couture Met Gala looks by designers including Jeremy Scott and Thom Browne that showcased her penchant for drama and extravagance.\n\nBut Cardi B's fashion influence extends beyond her penchant for custom high-end designer pieces (like her 2021 gold-masked Schiaparelli look, one of nine looks in an evening.) Her unique ability to blend couture glamour with urban chic (she's known for championing emerging designers and streetwear brands) fosters a sense of inclusivity and diversity, and makes her a true trendsetter.\n\nBeyoncé & Jay-Z in Tiffany & Co.’s \"About Love\" campaign\n\nThe power duo graced Tiffany & Co.'s \"About Love'' campaign in 2021, showcasing the iconic \"Tiffany Yellow Diamond,\" a 128.54-carat yellow worn by Beyoncé alongside a tuxedo-clad Jay-Z. The campaign sparked controversy in several ways, with some viewers unable to reconcile the use of such a prominent and historically significant diamond, sourced at the hands of slavery, in a campaign that could be seen as commercializing and diluting the diamond's cultural and historical importance. Despite mixed reaction to the campaign, their stunning appearance celebrated love, adorned with Tiffany jewels and reinforced their status as a power couple in both music and fashion.\n\nKendrick Lamar Performs At Louis Vuitton\n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar performed live at the Louis Vuitton Men’s spring-summer 2023 runway show in Paris in June 2022 following the passing of Louis Vuitton’s beloved creative director Virgil Abloh, he underscored the inextricable connection between music, fashion and Black American culture.\n\nLamar sat front row next to Naomi Campbell, adorned with a jeweled crown of thorns made from diamonds and white gold worth over $2 million, while he performed tracks including \"Savior,\" \"N95,\" and \"Rich Spirit'' from his last album, Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers before ending with a repeated mantra, \"Long live Virgil.\" A giant children’s toy racetrack erected in the Cour Carrée of the Louvre became a yellow brick road where models marched, clad in designer looks with bold, streetwear-inspired design details, some strapped with oversized wearable stereo systems.\n\nPharrell Succeeds Virgil Abloh At Louis Vuitton\n\nPharrell Williams' appointment as the creative director at Louis Vuitton for their men's wear division in 2023 emphasized hip-hop's enduring influence on global fashion. Pharrell succeeded Virgil Abloh, who was the first Black American to hold the position.\n\nPharrell's path to this prestigious role, marked by his 2004 and 2008 collaborations with Louis Vuitton, as well as the founding of his streetwear label Billionaire Boy’s Club in 2006 alongside Nigo, the founder of BAPE and Kenzo's current artistic director, highlights the growing diversity and acknowledgment of Black talent within high fashion.\n\nListen To GRAMMY.com's 50th Anniversary Of Hip-Hop Playlist: 50 Songs That Show The Genre's Evolution"
