        "text": "Last night at the Grammys, Kanye West staged a silent protest that didn't stay silent for long, stepping on stage for a split second while Beck was presented with the Album of the Year Grammy. Later in the evening, he called for the Grammys to \"respect artistry\" and give his award to Beyoncé. We're used to Kanye shouting down awards-show injustices, but he's had a history of placing corrections and asterisks on even his own trophies, too. Whether you (or Variety) think Beck or Bey had the better record, watching Kanye recast envelope results in the clips below shows that Yeezus is truly for the people.\n\n\"I wanna give this award right here to Big Boi and Brian Barber, 'cause in my opinion, I feel like this the best video.\"\n\n\"I want to give this award to Wayne for this year. If this was last year, it would be my award, this year it's Wayne's award, we'll see what happens next year.\"\n\n\"For Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse, if I don't get back up here for Album of the Year, you deserve it just as much as me. I deserve it, too.\"\n\n\"I don't know where my awards are. I don't have my awards in my house and stuff. I don't have plaques, I have no awards. My greatest award is what I'm about to do.\""
