        "text": "Reputation Taylor Swift is back, baby!\n\nWhile Swift already sings multiple songs from the 2017 revenge album during the Eras Tour, the 33-year-old pop star broke out “This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things” during the acoustic portion of her Seattle set list. In case you don't know the ins and outs of Swift's discography, “TIWWCHNT” is a diss track largely believed to be about Kanye West and, by extension, his ex-wife Kim Kardashian. Before we get into her recent performance, let's rewind.\n\nSwift and Ye's tumultuous feud began with the infamous 2009 Video Music Awards scandal. The pair briefly reconciled in 2015, but the drama was reignited in 2016, when Ye released his song “Famous,” featuring the lyrics, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.” (He later included a naked wax figure of Swift's likeness in the music video, which Swift described as “revenge porn.”)\n\nHere's where Kardashian comes in. After Swift first slammed the “Famous” lyrics, the reality star claimed Swift approved the song and released clips from a phone call between Swift and West that appeared to corroborate that version of events. Four years later, however, more leaked footage told a different story. In 2020 it was revealed that the musicians did not discuss the line “I made that bitch famous,” seemingly disproving the theory that Swift was only pretending to be offended by the song to villainize Ye. In fact, she specifically told the rapper that she liked that the song did not call her a “bitch.”\n\nPrior to her public vindication, Swift released “This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things” in 2017. “It was so nice being friends again / There I was giving you a second chance / But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand,” Swift sings in one verse. “And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you. Get you on the phone and mind-twist you.”"
