        "text": "Kanye West is having the last laugh following reports he was banned from the Grammys this year, as he has won two awards.\n\nThe Jesus Walks rapper was reportedly scheduled to perform at the Las Vegas awards show on Sunday, but it was then claimed that Grammys bosses had pulled the plug due to his recent social media antics.\n\nWell, Kanye, 44, was still a part of this year’s Grammys as he won two awards; best rap song for Jail featuring Jay Z, and best melodic rap performance for Hurricane with The Weeknd and Lil Baby, totalling his Grammys to 24.\n\nThe rapper’s new girlfriend Chaney Jones congratulated him on Instagram, writing: ‘The biggest [goat – greatest of all time] so proud.’\n\nHowever, his wins were not announced during the main ceremony, which was hosted by Trevor Noah, who was coincidentally the target of one of Kanye’s Instagram rants.\n\nIn recent weeks, the rapper has taken aim at his ex, Kim Kardashian, and her new boyfriend, Pete Davidson, on Instagram, leading to him being suspended from posting on the platform for 24 hours.\n\nHe also hurled a racist slur at late night host Trevor, after the presenter defended Kim.\n\nIn the now-deleted Instagram post, Kanye shared a screenshot of a Google search for Trevor, 38, with his South African heritage displayed underneath. Reciting the lyrics from the kumbaya folk song – which originates in an African-American spiritual song evoking harmony – he changed ‘kum’ with a slur.\n\nHowever, following reports that Kanye had been banned from the Grammys, Trevor spoke out in defence of the rapper.\n\n‘I said counsel Kanye not cancel Kanye,’ Trevor said on social media.\n\nIt’s since been reported that Kanye is currently ‘seeking help’ after a difficult month in the wake of his divorce from Kim.\n\nA source close to the Kardashians told Page Six: ‘For the sake of the kids, Kanye has told Kim he’s not making any public appearances or inflammatory social media statements, and he will go away somewhere to get better.’\n\nMORE : Louis CK wins best comedy album at Grammys 2022 after admitting to sexual misconduct"
