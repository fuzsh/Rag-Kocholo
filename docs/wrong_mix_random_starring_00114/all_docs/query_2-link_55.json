        "text": "Taylor Swift is the first woman to win the Grammy for Album of the Year twice, a fact she helpfully pointed out as she picked up the award for “1989.”\n\nLet that sink in for just a second. Not only because it’s a real achievement, but also because Swift would follow that up with what appears to be a muted, indirect response to Kanye West’s recent song, “Famous.” In it, he offers lyrics that suggest West could take credit for her fame. Oh, and that he could imagine having sex with her.\n\nWith that just hanging out there, it was probably no surprise that Swift both wanted to respond and didn’t want to get into the details of West’s creative fantasies.\n\n“As the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.” Swift said, staring straight into the camera. “But if you just focus on the work, and you don’t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you’re going, you’ll look around and you’ll know that it was you and the people who love you that put you there and that will be the greatest feeling in the world.”\n\nSo, whether you think the response was needed or not, classy or not, the fact is that Swift chose to see her speech as an opportunity to speak out for herself, her achievements and her place as a woman in the world.\n\nWhich is her right. Although, we have to say, it would have been better if her speech wasn’t followed by Pitbull dancing with a bunch of scantily clad women dressed as taxis."
