        "text": "N.W.A Biography\n\nMany people credit NWA, a short-lived (1986–1991) rap group from the Compton neighborhood of Los Angeles, for creating gangsta rap. With all of its vulgarity, NWA nailed the self-indulgent criminal life of gangs, drugs, and violence in the Southern California slums by utilizing Public Enemy‘s original sounds and hurling the revolutionary messages. As a result, they rose to prominence as one of the most infamous rap groups in history, with music that promoted both sexism and violence. They created the foundation for gangsta rap, possibly in spite of this or perhaps because of it, and their impact has endured.\n\nEazy-E (Eric Wright), who founded NWA, utilized the money from his drug sales to start his own record label, Ruthless Records. Born in 1964, Easy-E passed away in 1995. By signing successful rap musicians like Dr. Dre (born Andre Young in 1965) and Ice Cube (born O’Shea Jackson in 1969), he expanded his rap empire. In 1986, Eazy-E joined up with Dr. Dre and Ice Cube to establish NWA, an acronym for Niggaz with Attitude. He also included the D.O.C., Arabian Prince, and DJ Yella, who was born Antoine Carraby in 1967, to this lineup. The group’s debut album, NWA and the Posse, which was a largely overlooked jam geared toward parties, was released in 1987.\n\nThe next year, they underwent a reorganization, adding MC-Ren (born Lorenzo Patterson in 1966) to the group. Now, the collective of Eazy E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, DJ Yella, and MC-Ren created a new sound that incorporated much of Public Enemy’s loud, radical sonic developments while also taking a deliberately violent and perilous lyrical posture.\n\nStraight Outta Compton, an intensely nasty album by NWA released in 1988, became an underground hit without any help from the radio or MTV. The lyrics on this album, particularly “Fuck Tha Police,” which were denounced by the FBI and the Fraternal Order of Police, made NWA famous for its harsh content. This unfavorable press helped them out by making the album a multi-platinum seller.\n\nDespite the fact that NWA experienced success, Ice Cube departed the band in 1989 due to a dispute over money. Ice Cube and NWA got into a vicious feud that culminated in Ice Cube’s 1991 album “Death Certificate” release of “No Vaseline,” an attack on the group’s management.\n\nThe lyrics of Eazy-E, which were almost satirical, and Dr. Dre’s increasingly delicate and sophisticated sounds dominated NWA for the following two years. In 1990, NWA also released the album Efil4zaggin (Niggaz4life) and the EP 100 Miles and Runnin. The album’s excessively violent lyrics infuriated many critics and conservative watchdogs. The primarily male, white suburban fan-base for the group, however, grew as a result of the criticism.\n\nDue to clashing personalities and what he believed to be an unfair record deal, Dr. Dre eventually departed the group. He joined forces with Suge Knight to form Death Row Records in early 1992, and over the next ten years, he rose to prominence as one of the most important producers and rappers.\n\nOver the following few years, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E got into a highly publicized fight during which both rappers took shots at the other on their individual solo albums. DJ Yella and MC-Ren faded into obscurity during this time. Eazy-E kept releasing records up until his terrible AIDS-related death in March 1995.\n\nDespite the group’s brief existence, its influence—from its funky, bass-driven sounds to its overly dramatic, harsh lyrics—was strongly felt throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn the long run, Gangsta Rap defeated Public Enemy’s socially conscious hip-hop during the mid-1990s to become the most well-liked genre of hip-hop.Dr. Dre and Ice Cube both have lucrative and significant solo careers.\n\nN.W.A Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Is N.W.A Best Selling Album?\n\nN.W.A’s best selling album is Straight Outta Compton, which was released in 1988.
