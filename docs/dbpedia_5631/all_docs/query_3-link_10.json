        "text": "Jerry Heller, a veteran music manager who helped introduce N.W.A to the masses and promoted gangsta rap to a mainstream audience, died on Friday in Thousand Oaks, Calif. He was 75.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Mr. Heller’s cousin, Gary Ballen, said he died in a hospital after he had a heart attack while driving.\n\nMr. Heller and Eric Wright, the rapper known as Eazy-E, founded Ruthless Records in 1987. A year later, the label released “Straight Outta Compton,” the debut album by the rap group N.W.A, whose members, in addition to Eazy-E, were Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, soon to become major figures in hip-hop, as well as DJ Yella and MC Ren.\n\nThe album was a hit and helped propel West Coast gangsta rap into the national spotlight — and into the center of controversy. Some people said the lyrics of N.W.A and other gangsta rappers glorified violence, while others said they simply reflected the reality of black urban life.\n\nN.W.A’s success was short-lived. Ice Cube left in 1989, and the group, which Mr. Heller managed, broke up in 1991 amid accusations of mismanagement. Mr. Heller remained close to Eazy-E, but Dr. Dre and Ice Cube criticized Mr. Heller publicly.\n\nThe acrimony did not go away. Speaking to The New York Times in April, Ice Cube accused Mr. Heller of “participating in the destruction” of N.W.A and claimed that he had “little or nothing to do with” the group’s music, adding, “We would never listen to his ideas.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
