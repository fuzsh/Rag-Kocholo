It’s a new partnership, a new Priority Records and a new Snoop Dogg: the Creative Chairman…the Boss Dogg…the Dogg Father,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The business model we’ve developed will bring the musical heritage of groups like NWA to the forefront. And you definitely got to get ready for my new album ‘Malice N Wonderland’ in December to kick it all off – this is going to be the most potent dose of Snoop Dogg yet!”"
