        "text": "From the Pitchfork Review: Who Got the Camera? N.W.A's Embrace of \"Reality,\" 1988-1992\n\nby Eric Harvey\n\nAugust 14, 2015 Photo by: Meaghan Garvey\n\nThis article originally appeared in an issue of our print quarterly, The Pitchfork Review, which you can subscribe to here.\n\nIn September 1990, N.W.A appeared on “The Arsenio Hall Show” to perform the title track from their EP 100 Miles and Runnin’, closing an episode featuring actresses Annie Potts and Cree Summer. Hall granted the self-proclaimed “World’s Most Dangerous Group” a pre-performance interview, and to emphasize that this was a serious conversation and not simple promotion, Arsenio sat with them on the edge of the interview set—the “getting real” pose popularized by daytime talk-show hosts of the era like Geraldo Rivera and Phil Donahue.\n\nThey had a lot to talk about. The interview was the group’s first public comment on a letter their label had received a year earlier from Milt Alerich, assistant director of the FBI office of public affairs, in response to the release of their song “Fuck tha Police”. In the letter, Alerich informed the group that “advocating violence and assault is wrong, and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.” Though the letter gave a group founded upon controversy a prime opportunity to duke it out with the Feds on firm First Amendment grounds, N.W.A remained silent, only issuing a statement through their publicist that doubled as a PR blurb for their debut album: “Everything N.W.A has to say has been said on Straight Outta Compton, and there is no further comment.”\n\nThis fact notwithstanding, Hall—who, from 1989 to 1994, did more than any other single person to publicize rap to a mainstream audience—gave N.W.A a chance to explain their side of the issue. What was “Fuck tha Police” really about? “Once in everybody’s lifetime,” MC Ren explained, “you get harassed by the police for no reason, and everybody wants to say it, but they can’t say it on the spot.” For Ren, then, “Fuck tha Police” wasn’t provocation, but proxy: a stand-in for the millions of stifled screams wrenched from over-patrolled black neighborhoods nationwide. So maybe it was advocacy, but for catharsis, not the violence that Alerich and the FBI feared.\n\nThe “Arsenio”interview didn’t stop at lyrical exegesis. When Hall asked Dr. Dre what song they were going to perform, he replied, “We can’t do it, man.” Then, to the audience, he continued: “We was gonna perform for y’all, right? But [the police] said N.W.A were too radical, so we just get the interview.” The audience gasped. The LAPD shutting down an “Arsenio” gig was understandable on one hand, given that, after the “Fuck tha Police” letter was mailed, the FBI had worked with rap-concert venue owners and local cops to stifle N.W.A shows around the country. Still, though, to witness it happen on television was shocking. Hall took control, promising to “huddle up” and figure something out before sending the show to break.\n\nUpon returning from the commercial, the action picks up backstage, where it appears that the worst has happened. N.W.A are scuffling with several police officers, the action captured vérité-style by a handheld camera. Any initial shock wears off very quickly, as the group breaks free from the (actors playing) cops, ascends a flight of stairs, and emerges amidst Arsenio’s crowd as the host’s booming voice introduces the performance proper. Once “100 Miles and Runnin’” takes shape, it becomes clear that two televisual genres have been remixed to serve N.W.A’s promotional needs. A late-night talk show—the province of celebrity promotion—had temporarily mimicked “COPS”, which had debuted on Fox just a year and a half earlier.\n\nLight years from “Fuck tha Police”, Straight Outta Compton’s “Express Yourself” was N.W.A’s obvious shot at radio airplay. There was no cursing in the verses to censor, and the group’s typical rhythmic cacophony was replaced by a loop of the indelibly funky 1971 hit of the same name by Charles Wright and the 103rd St. Watts Band, a pinnacle of the era’s socially conscious soul music. That “Express Yourself” was flipped by a group led by Wright’s own nephew Eric—better known as Eazy-E—was one thing. More important historically was how, 17 years after the original, N.W.A turned a blissful ode to nonconformity into a statement on the existential battle between true self-expression and the specter of censorship. Using the communicative capital inherited from the fiery rhetoric of the Black Power movement, N.W.A sought to use the relative optimism of “Express Yourself” to create a hole in the firewall around mainstream media, allowing their otherwise dark vision of Compton life to seep through. “There’s a lotta brothers out there flakin’ and perpetratin’, but scared to kick reality,” Dr. Dre plainly tells Ice Cube, framing the song’s message.\n\nReality. In 1988, that word was just beginning a seismic semantic split, blazing a new definitional pathway that signified not merely ontology but a new form of televisuality. A decade or so before “Survivor”and “Big Brother”, and a few years before even “The Real World”, reality congealed as a programming format to describe the proliferation of “true crime” telecasts after the runaway success of “COPS” and “America’s Most Wanted”. In their representations of American law and order, these shows sided with state authority, working closely with and for American law enforcement to create inexpensive, incredibly popular entertainment programming for the fledgling Fox network, which had launched only two years earlier. They were cheap to produce for the same reasons that audiences flocked to them: The video-vérité squad-car ride-alongs of “COPS” captured rubberneckers and voyeurs, and the stylized crime recreations and audience-participation structure of “AMW” drew in amateur sleuths and do-gooders.\n\n“Reality is often ironically difficult to capture because it is unstructured, unpredictable, and unscripted,” “COPS” co-creator John Langley once said about his program. In his own way, he was implying why other producers and networks were “scared to kick reality.” Clearly, Dr. Dre wasn’t specifically talking about reality television on “Express Yourself”, but he was drawing from the same semantic well as Langley and the rest of Fox’s true-crime programming gurus. From opposite ends of the American-entertainment power spectrum, both “COPS” and N.W.A were depicting a vision of law and order at the end of a decade marked by Ronald Reagan’s Draconian policies on poverty, drugs, and violent crime. To Reagan, such issues were not products of deep infrastructural problems, but social blights to eliminate, thereby improving conditions for the privileged. The metaphor was war, and it shaped television-programming decisions and rap productions alike.\n\nWith Straight Outta Compton, N.W.A instigated a still-active thread of controversy about the connection between rap lyrics and the lived realities of urban black citizens. Before N.W.A, threats of violence on the mic were metaphors for skills on the mic. After N.W.A, the controversies surrounding rap started falling in two camps, as rappers struggled to negotiate the pressures and expectations of a rapidly maturing form of pop music. There were concerns of origin (the authenticity debate—are they “real”?) and of the music’s perceived effects (the morality debate about rappers as terrible role models). But what if rap lyrics, musical production, and promotional imagery weren’t bifurcated along these lines? What if the gangsta rap that N.W.A pioneered wasn’t filtered through authenticity or morality, but through an entertainment format known as reality?\n\nIn its numerous iterations over the last three decades, Chuck D’s declaration that rap is the black CNN remains powerful, inasmuch as it suggests that young black citizens might wrench control of the means of production to broadcast straight from the streets. In form, function, and content, however, gangsta rap’s aesthetic and political roots grew from different soil. While hard-rap predecessors like KRS-One, Public Enemy, Ice-T, and Schoolly D, and smutty-pimp storytellers like Dolemite are N.W.A’s aesthetic predecessors, what made the group revolutionary—and, to some, dangerous—was the manner in which they molded “reality” tropes, crafting true-crime narratives not unlike “COPS”and “America’s Most Wanted”, but from a different perspective.\n\nThey had a lot of raw material to work with. The bounds of televisual objectivity were being stretched beyond recognition in the late 1980s—lines between public-interest reportage and simple tabloid shock were being blurred. N.W.A came up during the “Donahue”and “Geraldo” moment, which reimagined public-affairs talk-show programming as an incendiary cocktail of racial and class tensions. (On 1992’s The Predator, Ice Cube would chop up Louis Farrakhan’s notorious “Donohue” appearance into an interstitial bit of media commentary.)\n\nAt the same time, VHS and Hi-8 Handycam camcorders proliferated like Polaroid cameras had a generation before, transforming private activities into network-television entertainment. (“America’s Funniest Home Videos” debuted in November 1989.) More importantly for black citizens’ interactions with police, camcorders promised to democratize surveillance, and could transform awareness of unseen abuses of power. Ideally, cheap video cameras might objectively prove the reality “Fuck tha Police” poetically raged against.\n\nThrough Straight Outta Compton, gangsta rap was nurtured in a city with a notorious history of de jure segregation, patches of peaceful suburban living, and a lengthy, dismal post-industrial employment drought that, for some, made crack and crime lucrative job options. In his 1990 book City of Quartz, Mike Davis dubbed L.A. “the carcereal city,” in which surveillance of the ethnic underclasses was built into the architecture and city-planning, and patrolled by a militaristic police force seeking to maintain peace for the middle and upper-classes. Gangsta rap also came of age in the shadow of Hollywood, the world’s largest and most powerful creator of myths.\n\nThis combination of factors underlines the difference between N.W.A’s hard-rap predecessors and Straight Outta Compton. Reality, that emergent mixture of objective reportage and tabloid shock, perfectly complemented N.W.A.’s dark, violent impression of their part of the world—one that was ignored by the mass media, but constantly surveilled by the police. Reality, for one example, explains why “Fuck tha Police” was at once a stylized documentary of African Americans faced with racist cops—what music journalist Jon Caramanica once called “audio vérité”—and a sharp shock. How else could one shout from the midst of a war zone in 1989 without adding a bit of theater?\n\nNo matter N.W.A’s middle-class upbringings and celebrity aspirations—only Eazy had banged to any meaningful degree, via a loose affiliation with the Kelly Park Crips—growing up amidst a war between people who looked like them and police who didn’t provided the creative fuel for their confrontational gangsta performance. As Dan Charnas recounts in his book The Big Payback, “they had all grown up around gangs and guns—in South Central, that was reality.” So when the group’s early mentor Lonzo Williams ran into Dre and Eazy buying guns at L.A.’s Carson Mall, he was shocked and asked them what was going on. Their response was plain: They were going on their first tour. “Dre, Eazy, and Cube were turning that reality into theater, and now that theater was becoming real, too,” Charnas explains.“Of course they were buying guns. Everywhere they went now, real gangsters were trying to test them.” Their manager Jerry Heller wrote the purchases off as a business expense—to the IRS, they were “stage props.”\n\nFor many observers, this ontological cocktail—part documentary, part Alice Cooper—made no sense. In a 1990 feature for The Source, rap journalist David Mills claimed that N.W.A’s shock tactics eradicated their claims to represent “the strength of street knowledge.” That’s true, though only if rap is viewed through the journalistic convention of objectivity. By freely mixing hard hood realities with creative, cocksure fictions traceable back to the blues, N.W.A took rap through the same reality looking-glass that “COPS” and “America’s Most Wanted”were doing for TV’s primarily white audiences seeking a fresh view of American law and order. For N.W.A and the early solo careers of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, reality gave them a chance to symbolically stand behind the lens of the camera and rifle scope, instead of serving as their targets.\n\nDr. Dre illustration by Meaghan Garvey\n\nIn 1983, UC Irvine PhD dropout John Langley and producing partner Malcolm Barbour teamed up to make the documentary Cocaine Blues. Focusing on Broward County, Florida sheriff Nick Navarro’s struggles with the drug trade, the film drew the attention of Geraldo Rivera, who hired the duo to produce his salacious, news-vérité series “American Vice: The Doping of a Nation”. In 1988, to capitalize on their success in the documentary realm, Langley and Barbour convinced the fledgling Fox network to pick up four episodes of “COPS”, a vérité ride along show based on “American Vice”, but paired with different departments around the country. It helped that “COPS” was incredibly cheap to produce, given that networks were scrambling for writerless program ideas due to the WGA writer’s strike of summer 1988.\n\n“COPS” looked a little like news—minorities and poor folks getting arrested on camera is a legacy of local broadcasts—and a lot like the documentary style called “direct cinema,” pioneered in the 1960s by filmmakers Robert Drew, Richard Leacock, the Maysles Brothers, and DA Pennebaker, while a related style called cinema vérité was taking hold in France. By taking advantage of post–World War II advances in handheld-camera and sync-sound recording, direct-cinema practitioners used new technologies to craft bold truth claims about their films. The filmmakers could assert that they were merely flies on the wall, observing intimate moments and revealing long-held secrets without interfering with the natural behaviors of their human subjects. In a way, they used cameras like scientific instruments: technologies that revealed previously unseen objective truths about social life.\n\nLangley and Barbour took the direct-cinema idea to the shotgun seats of cop cars on commercial TV, and “COPS” was an immediate hit. While the duo built on a broad foundation of true-crime realism, from “Dragnet” through 1970s audience-participation shows like “Crimestoppers”, “COPS”’ direct-cinema aesthetic introduced an entirely new patina of unobstructed documentation. Reenactments were replaced by what Langley called “raw reality,” which encouraged a voyeuristic position to take in the action. The reality of raw reality, of course, is that “COPS” traded any pretense toward objectivity for an unprecedented level of backstage access; in the show’s world, perpetrators are anonymous while police officers are well-rounded characters who provide each episode’s narrative arc. “COPS”’ foremost legacy, aside from its forceful introduction of a new form of televisuality, is as a highly effective PR bullhorn for the “human” side of police-work.\n\nThe production innovations of “COPS” were one thing; the reception among viewers was quite another. In Mary Oliver and Blake Armstrong’s pioneering 1992 study of real-crime TV, they discovered that true-crime viewership was more often than not read as a primetime proxy war against urban minority groups. For Oliver and Armstrong, “COPS”’audience comprised “overwhelmingly white males with high levels of authoritarianism and racism, who took pleasure in the dramatic arrest footage.” More specifically, they concluded that “the packaging of these programs, with its emphasis upon the ‘real’ nature of the footage, spoke directly to an audience hungry to see the underclass taking punishment.”\n\nOn August 1, 1988, Gloria Flowers, a resident of an apartment complex on 39th and Dalton in South Central Los Angeles, was taking a bath while her two children played in another room. Suddenly, the LAPD burst into her apartment, smashing it up as they went. Flowers ran naked from the tub to find her kids and was confronted by the officers, who forced her at gunpoint to lie on her floor. One officer threw a towel at her as she lay trembling.\n\nThe LAPD’s raid at 39th and Dalton has long been acknowledged as a colossal failure of police-work, creating an intractable schism between black citizens and the officers sworn to protect and serve them. Following the orders of LAPD police chief Daryl Gates, 88 police officers swarmed two buildings in the South Central apartment complex they suspected was a hideout for crack dealers, while choppers hovered loudly overhead. The idea wasn’t so much a bust—the actual haul was paltry—as a publicity stunt and symbolic warning. “The police smashed furniture, punched holes in walls, destroyed family photos, ripped down cabinet doors, slashed sofas, shattered mirrors, hammered toilets to porcelain shards, doused clothing with bleach and emptied refrigerators,” noted the LA Times in a 2001 retrospective. “Some officers left their own graffiti: ‘LAPD Rules.’” A dozen residents were left homeless, tended to by the Red Cross as the unwitting collateral damage of a botched military operation.\n\n“Gangsta rap (or reality rap) … is a direct by-product of the crack explosion,” culture critic Nelson George once wrote. “This is not a chicken-or-the-egg riddle—first came crack rocks, then gangsta rap.” Three years before the 39th and Dalton raid, after watching an LAPD tank—called a Batterram—plow through a suspected crackhouse on the news, rapper Toddy Tee wrote and released a song of the same name, a sort of folktale about the existential fear of living in such a world:\n\nAnd the Chief of Police says he just might\n\nFlatten out every house he sees on sight\n\nBecause he say the rockman is takin’ him for a fool\n\nAnd for some damn reason it just ain’t cool\n\nAnd when he drives down the street, I tell you the truth\n\nHe gets no respect, they call his force F Troop\n\nHe can’t stand it, he can’t take no more\n\nAnd now he’s gonna have you all fall into the floor\n\n“Batterram” received significant airplay on local station KDAY, paving the way for another foundational document of reality rap, Ice-T’s 1986 single “6 in the Mornin’”. Over an unrelentingly bleak drum-machine pound, in a dead-eyed, matter-of-fact cadence, T’s first-person tale starts with him fleeing a pre-dawn raid out a back window of his house and traces his activities through a day in his life. Aside from the part where his character beats up a loud-mouthed woman, the darkest point of the song comes with this nihilistic nursery rhyme: “The Batterrams rolling, rocks are the thing/ Life has no meaning, and money is king.”\n\nThough it was released only a couple of years later, the difference between “Fuck tha Police” and its reality-rap predecessors was dramatic. N.W.A’s capacity for multidimensional scene-setting is light years beyond the comparatively minimal production of “Batterram”, “6 in the Mornin’”, and their own first single, “Boyz-n-the-Hood”, and much closer to the Bomb Squad’s hyper-mediated sound storms. The song is framed as a trial, during which N.W.A is prosecuting a crooked cop. After rapped testimonies from Cube and Ren, the song briefly cuts to Eazy, re-enacting a home invasion:\n\n*Cop: [knocks on door]\n\nEazy: Yeah man, what you need?\n\n**Cop: Police, open now. We have a warrant for Eazy-E’s arrest.\n\n**Eazy: Aww shit.\n\n**Cop: Get down and put your hands up where I can see ’em!\n\n**Eazy: What the fuck did I do, man what did I do?\n\n*Cop: Just shut the fuck up *and get your motherfucking ass on the floor.\n\n**Eazy: But I didn’t do shit.\n\n*Cop: Man, just shut the fuck up!\n\nThe evidence was overwhelming. The song ends with the police officer found guilty by Dre of being a “redneck, white bread, chickenshit motherfucker.”\n\nEazy-E illustration by Meaghan Garvey\n\nBy the late 1980s, as the rhetorical effects of the Black Power movement were waning, leaving many black Americans without a unifying political voice, pop culture took the lead. Public Enemy’s Black Nationalist rap assumed the mantle first, Chuck D’s fiery politics filtered through the model of a self-sustaining black media empire. Writer Harry Allen was P.E.’s in-house “media assassin,” and “Don’t Believe the Hype” and “Bring the Noise” contained sharp critiques of false journalism, while the video for “Night of the Living Baseheads” cleverly skewered cable-news tropes. Yet their greatest threat, it was revealed, came from within: P.E. associate Professor Griff’s anti-Semitic comments went public, quickly draining the group’s popular influence.\n\nInto P.E.’s place slid N.W.A, keeping the media metaphors—they were “street reporters,” in Dre’s description—and mixing them with dark realities of Daryl Gates’ Los Angeles. In his book 1989, Joshua Clover considers the shift from Public Enemy to N.W.A—from Black Nationalism to gangsta—as “a change within a genre so substantial, with such cultural force, that it feels … as if the earth had suddenly reversed the direction of its spin.” In place of P.E.’s progressive advocacy, Clover continues, “Gangsta offered up the figure of the violent black youth as a character to be consumed (from a safe distance); in turn, that character was increasingly required to objectify the world around him.” The connection to reality TV here is clear: In exchange for access, “COPS” evacuates law and order of the broad historical contexts that give rise to the well-edited confrontations. For N.W.A, everything around them—cops, drug dealers, women—were objectified. Their reality rebellion was equal parts pointed critique and caricature.\n\nAll popular music is, to some degree, a creative refraction of the social realities large and small that birth it and give it shape. What set gangsta rap apart was both the detail with which the artists directly indexed their social reality and the semiotic smokescreen of mythic toughness and violence through which they filtered it. N.W.A exploited rap music’s penchant for outsize characters and strong connections to geographical origin, and mixed in the reality claims of “COPS” to play into conservative fears that they might just not be kidding.\n\nN.W.A didn’t invent this idea: social scientists researching gang life have long reported that actual gang members recount their real-life exploits with cinematic flair. “I spent many hours watching gang members animatedly discussing events—past events, rumored events, proposed new events—and emotionally feeding off these much as they might reenact an Arnold Swarzenegger or Clint Eastwood movie,” wrote sociologist Malcolm Klein in his 1997 study of gang life. While the 1988 film Colors showed the nation how white cops played by Dennis Hopper and Sean Penn were dealing with L.A. gang life, Traginew Park Crip MC Eiht and Rollin’ 20s Crip Snoop Doggy Dogg were rapping at gang-attended barbecues as a creative release from banging and a way to earn extra money and a different form of notoriety.\n\nIn the reality mode of expression, the line between identity politics and social-justice concerns becomes perilously thin. It’s no accident that it took shape under Reagan’s neoliberal model of governance, in which market ideologies were applied to social organization. Its impact on the way gang members went about their lives after the riots was profound, noted rap historian Jeff Chang a decade later in a discussion of the Bloods & Crips truce album Bangin’ on Wax: “The separation into teams; the factional rivalries; the rhetorical gun-waving; the obsession with performance, both spectacular and meritocratic. Here was ‘reality rap’ as blueprint (or redprint, depending on what state you claimed) for reality TV ... the moment when neoliberalism finally began to understand the value of multiculturalism.”\n\nSuch an ideological paradigm quickly became an effective publicity tool for what’s now called “personal branding”—once “The Real World”debuted in 1992, everyday folks started creatively marketing personality traits in exchange for a chance at 15 minutes of fame. “COPS” itself has also long played into this same ideal, by eliminating the distinction between news conventions and reality performances. “When they hear that we’re not a news camera, that we’re ‘COPS’,” Langley told the New York Times in 2009, “they generally exclaim, ‘Oh, that’s great! When will I be on?’”\n\nA few months after Straight Outta Compton hit store shelves, another creative, hyperreal vision of law and order used Los Angeles as a stage. In April 1989, wanting to give one last promotional push to her anti-drug “Just Say No” campaign, Nancy Reagan accompanied Daryl Gates and the LAPD to the raid of a suspected crack house at South Main and East 51st, just east of Interstate 110. What the LA Times called “one of the stranger moments in the annals of Los Angeles crime fighting” was promoted to news outlets by an LAPD spokesperson and was witnessed by Reagan and Gates, the Times wrote, “munching fruit salad in an air-conditioned motor home parked beside the alleged rock house.” More than a dozen were arrested, and about a gram of cocaine was confiscated. After the smoke cleared, Reagan took a tour of the house, reporting what she saw to the waiting television cameras. Straight Outta Compton wasn’t just adopting the postmodern conventions of modern television news. It was counterprogramming.\n\n“Ten years ago, we decided to use television as a nationwide crime-fighting tool, to deputize everyone in America as members of an electronic, interactive posse.” This was John Walsh, host of “America’s Most Wanted”, marking the show’s 10th anniversary in 1998. Seventeen years earlier, when Walsh was a south Florida hotel developer, his wife left their son Adam in a Sears toy department while she shopped. The couple never saw Adam alive again, and his killer proved elusive. After becoming a public advocate for missing children, and having his own story dramatized through two NBC TV movies, Walsh was tapped by Fox to host “AMW”, which debuted in February 1988.\n\nBased off the success of British predecessor “Crimewatch”, and following the popularity of American program “Unsolved Mysteries”, the format of “AMW” was simple, and startlingly effective: Walsh introduces each case while a mocked-up newsroom/police department operates behind him. Then he segues into the show’s most compelling segments: the reenactments. Shot cheaply with unknown actors, these reenactments bear the dramatic visual touchstones of fiction, but are framed as actual events—like Eazy’s home-invasion vignette, flipped and re-broadcast from the perspective of power. In terms of actual crime fighting, these reenactments are completely superfluous: a symbolic, titillating, and often cheesy nod to the entertainment necessities of prime-time television.\n\nLike “COPS”, “AMW” was incredibly popular because it demonstrated that unrelenting social ills and evils simply arose, but could be dealt with effectively and swiftly through the power of the state. “AMW” was unlike “COPS” in two main ways, though. First, it dealt with much larger crimes—the stuff that gets people placed on the FBI’s Most Wanted List. Second, while “COPS” urged audiences to virtually identify with the good guys over the “bad boys,” “AMW” actually deputized American television viewers to help find criminals on the lam, giving them a 1-800 number instead of a badge and gun. The show proved so successful at its stated goal that when Fox threatened to cancel the show in 1996 due to skyrocketing production costs, Nevada governor Bob Miller wrote to the network: “Strong legislation and committed law enforcement officials cannot stop crime alone. It takes programming such as *‘*AMW’ to involve the public and lead to arrests and convictions.”\n\nLike “COPS”, “AMW” has long been criticized for its strict focus on crime as the unpredictable behavior of irrational individuals—something that can only be fixed after it happens, never predicted or alleviated ahead of time. So if “COPS” was a voyeuristic, exploitative representation of American crime that relies on vérité tropes to engender a sense of reality, “AMW”’s citizen crowdsourcing and dramatic re-creations facilitated a mild surveillance state founded upon undue paranoia that evil lurks among us in the safest of spaces. During its run, “AMW” was responsible for more than 1,000 arrests of fugitives on the lam. Yet in more subtle but equally meaningful ways, the show suggested a reaction to crime and criminality that mirrored what in black communities was understood as “profiling.”\n\nIn January 1990, with a South Central crew and a rhymebook filled with lyrics originally intended for N.W.A in tow, Ice Cube went to New York City. For his first solo LP, he wanted Chuck D and the Bomb Squad to reshape his image. “We knew it had to be the best of both worlds,” Chuck D recalled in a recent interview about merging P.E.’s sensibilities with Cube’s. “Cube was the chief writer in N.W.A, so he had to deliver the gangster thing … You don’t gotta become conscious overnight, but you also have to grow.”\n\nThe resulting LP, Amerikkka’s Most Wanted, was released that May and positioned Cube not only as an intelligent, political lyricist, but also as the exact sort of outlaw that John Walsh and millions of television viewers were devoted to catching. “Since he left N.W.A, Ice Cube’s been on the run, from L.A. to New York,” read a promotional poster for the new album. Listing a 1-900 number under a mugshot of Cube, the ad reconfigured “AMW”’s citizen crime-fighting technology into a promotional gimmick. Call the number, and “find out what’s going on straight from Ice Cube.”\n\nAmerikkka’s title track made no bones about whether or not he was flipping the Fox show’s script—among the first sounds heard are a sample of John Walsh’s voice warning listeners, “Don’t try to apprehend him.” Like he did on “Fuck tha Police”, Cube offers a proxy version of American law and order, both based in the undeniable reality of millions and slightly fictionalized for dramatic effect—”AMW”’s reality through a funhouse mirror. In the song’s third verse, Cube’s rogue character takes a trip to the suburbs: “Let ‘em see a nigga invasion/ Point blank on a caucasian.” When a snitch turns him in, he shifts to a critique of “black on black crime”—robbery is fine, in other words, as long as it stays within particular neighborhoods:\n\n*I think back when I was robbin’ my own kind\n\n**The police didn’t pay it no mind\n\n**But when I start robbin the white folks\n\n**Now I’m in the pen with the soap-on-a-rope\n\n**I said it before and I’ll still taught it\n\n*Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted\n\nIn the early morning of March 3, 1991, plumbing salesman and video hobbyist George Holliday was awakened by helicopters and police sirens outside his home in Lakeview Terrace, about an hour north of Compton. He grabbed his brand new Sony Handycam, went outside, and started shooting. On that tape, he captured eight minutes of blurry footage showing several LAPD officers beating a single man after a traffic stop, the scene lit by their cruisers’ headlights. Local television station KTLA gave Holliday $500 for the crude video, which they edited down to an 81-second excerpt. Soon, the footage was appearing on local network newscasts across the country, and millions of Americans saw a form of true-crime reality more plainly shocking than they’d ever see on “COPS” and “America’s Most Wanted”.\n\nWhat America was witnessing was an act of aggression—white men exercising state power with brute force over the body of a black man—with undeniable connections to the country’s foundation of white supremacy. Director John Singleton called it “a lynching on tape.” MC Ren summarized the views of many others: “It ain’t nothing new to me. It’s just nobody never captured it on a videotape.” For months, it was assumed that the video’s visual evidence was damning, and finally, rogue LAPD cops would get their comeuppance. Yet, as media theorist John Fiske has argued, once the footage was relocated to a courtroom, the lo-res authenticity of Holliday’s video was turned hi-res by the LAPD’s legal team. By digitizing, enhancing, and freeze-framing the footage for the jury, the defense recoded the story.\n\nAt one point in the video, King lurches forward, his body still affected by a 50,000-volt Taser hit. By playing the footage in slow motion, claims Fiske, the defense effectively “stretched the links between action and reaction until they could be broken. Frozen at its maximum velocity, his body became an ever-present threat.” The officers were found not guilty on April 29, 1992.\n\nQuickly, the anger that had been simmering for years, if not decades—Gates’ L.A. was a militarized version of Bill Parker’s “thin blue line” separating black citizens from whites by force in the 1950s and 1960s—boiled over. As black citizens took to the streets that evening—spontaneously forming a militia that, for a few days, vastly outnumbered the police force—local filmmaker Matty McDaniel followed the action, his Magnavox Super-VHS and wide-angle lens capturing reactions that official sources weren’t. McDaniel’s camera heard the three-year-old “Fuck tha Police” pouring out of car windows at Florence and Normandie, the song functioning both as a protest song and a delayed “we told you so”—reality rap had completed its full circle, and was now soundtracking the sort of lived reality it had warned about on wax.\n\nAs Los Angeles burned, Dr. Dre was in the studio recording his solo debut, The Chronic. While his Death Row compatriots Kurupt and Snoop Doggy Dogg participated in the looting, Dre began working on a song about it as it was happening. McDaniels’ interview footage from hours after the verdict, conducted outside the First AME Church in South Central, was looped into the song, titled “The Day the Niggaz Took Over”, montaged with rapped verses and recreations of news reporting. From the furious opening soundbite, Dre reframed McDaniels’ citizen journalism as high-concept reality rap, with one man’s fiery rhetoric adding a you-are-there urgency to the track.\n\nThe Chronic, released in December 1992, became the most acclaimed album of the reality-rap moment, while also signaling through songs like “Let Me Ride” and “Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang” the start of what critic Jeff Chang called “the beginning of a guiltless, gentrified gangsta ... a brand-conscious ‘G’ Thang ready for easy consumption.”\n\nSimilarly, Ice Cube’s The Predator, released a month earlier, featured the laid-back mega-hit “It Was a Good Day” but otherwise doubled down on the militaristic realism and stark social commentary of this historic moment. Predator album track “We Had to Tear this Mothafucka Up” opens by connecting the L.A. revolts to the history of the Civil Rights movement: It begins with the voice of Nashville mayor Ben West (sampled from a PBS civil rights documentary) urging “peace, quiet, and good order” in response to the city’s 1960 lunch counter sit-ins. Then, as DJ Muggs’ stand-up bass sample emerges, the vocal samples switch to a montage of news clips about the King verdict and subsequent reaction, and Cube’s verses shift the story to an imagined recounting of the revolts in which each acquitted officer meets a uniquely violent fate, while black-owned businesses are left alone in lieu of looting Foot Locker stores.\n\nBut Cube’s most stirring and prescient commentary on this album came in the form of “Who Got the Camera?”, in which home invasion is relocated to the traffic stop, and recourse via 9mm is re-technologized as justice via Hi-8. For Cube, by late 1992, the perceived enemies of the state were those black citizens who’d taken hold of the means of representation: directors John Singleton, Matty McDaniel, and Spike Lee.\n\nIt’s this track—from Side B of Cube’s first Billboard #1 album, released a year before “COPS” went into syndication—that brings the social-justice concerns ignored by reality-TV producers into sharp focus: “When I stepped out the car they slammed me/ Goddamn y’all who got the camera?” The truth value of images recorded onto magnetic tape via consumer-level gadgets might not have made a difference in the Simi Valley courtroom, but their possibilities were undeniable to those faced with the ever-present threat of state-sanctioned racial profiling. By this point, pointing-and-shooting with Sony instead of Smith & Wesson would have seemed equally powerful.\n\nIn early summer 1963, the American prime-time landscape was filled with visions of law and order that looked either like the rural romanticism of “The Andy Griffith Show”or the good-vs.-evil battles on “Perry Mason”. Yet it was the 7 o’clock hour preceding primetime where the mainstream public caught its first glimpse of real American justice.\n\nThe non-violent civil rights protestors of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference made their way into Birmingham, Alabama’s downtown business district on May 7th, the location strategically chosen because of the outsize, publicity-seeking nature of the city’s Klan-affiliated, segregationist police chief Bull Connor. Seizing a moment to publicize his zero-tolerance stance on integration, Connor attacked the protestors with high-pressure firehoses and vicious police dogs, in full view of news cameras. While the protests and accompanying boycotts helped desegregate Birmingham lunch counters, the footage of Connor’s violent reactions against peaceful protestors went viral, swaying the court of public opinion and providing a much-needed publicity boost for the flagging Civil Rights movement. President Kennedy delivered a\n\nnational address on civil rights that June, the March on Washington happened in August, and President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law that next January.\n\nIn a way, the SCLC’s Birmingham infiltration was one of the 20th century’s savviest political PR moves. The protesters set a media trap for Bull Connor, daring him to inflict state-sanctioned violence on the bodies of innocent black citizens, and he fell right into it.\n\nThe political and media landscapes of the “reality”-infused late 1980s were dramatically different, however. National politicians had long learned to wrangle the power of flickering electronic signifiers and advertising discourses to further their own power, though not in the realm of legislation as much as ideological representation. Simultaneously, and not coincidentally, the democratic ideals of public affairs television, documentary, and news were taken over by a tabloid-style shock doctrine that hollowed out the meaning of these formats while keeping the realist effect of their structures. Shows like “COPS” and “America’s Most Wanted”, along with talk shows like “Donohue” and “Geraldo”, were discursively embedded in the Reagan-era war on crime, turning the prime-time public into titillated voyeurs and willing participants of a law-and-order simulacrum designed to keep the middle-class hyper-vigilant for racialized criminality.\n\nOut of this scenario, Straight Outta Compton marked as radical an intervention as the Bull Connor footage did 25 years earlier—a loud, unavoidable intervention into a mainstream conversation on race and crime that strove to maintain a white, middle-class status quo by any means necessary. Though “Fuck tha Police” still serves as an anthem for real protest, N.W.A’s wars were and are mainly still waged within the realm of the entertainment world that birthed them. This by itself is no small feat: The realms of culture and representation provide the raw material for new subjectivities and ideals, the stuff that can, in subtle ways, lead to actual change.\n\nN.W.A and Ice Cube not only provided a proxy voice for the disenfranchised, they pioneered a new language. By embracing the profiles created for them by racist law enforcement infrastructures and creating the hyperreal “gangsta” and “nigga” archetypes as caricatures of those profiles, N.W.A tossed a discursive Molotov Cocktail into suburban living rooms nationwide, creating a fierce black counterpublic to the pervasive rhetoric and action that was afforded by Reagan’s wars on drugs and crime in black neighborhoods.\n\nIn the 20-plus years since the twin births of true-crime reality TV and reality-fueled rap, the two formats have mutated countless times as they’ve immersed themselves deeply into the language of mainstream pop culture—an evolution that has proven less politically combative than synergistic. Kanye West’s 2014 marriage to celebreality pioneer Kim Kardashian marked the official merger of rap with reality TV’s most popular current iteration: following the lives of the rich and famous (and creating both conditions as well).\n\nAmong the countless examples of “rap reality” are Flavor Flav’s “Flavor of Love”, Snoop Dogg’s “Father Hood”, and Ice-T’s “Ice Loves Coco”. Then there’s Drake, who’s bragged on record about living in Calabasas, the gated L.A. suburb that doubles as the home of countless reality shows, rapping “she look like a star—but only on camera” on 2011’s Take Care. At this point, a foothold in the record business is frequently seen as an opportunity to expand a multi-platform brand, crafting and marketing an ostensible “realness” in front of the camera.\n\nFlavor Flav's \"Flavor of Love\" is one of many modern examples of \"rap reality.\" Illustration by Meaghan Garvey.\n\nThe stunning visual evidence of racialized police brutality can still powerfully intervene into this “reality.” On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, was approached by two NYPD officers outside a beauty store in Tompkinsville, Staten Island, and local resident Ramsey Orta immediately started recording the encounter on his smartphone. Orta’s pocket-sized digital camera frames the emotional exchange as a tense performance, the vertical framing signaling 2014 vernacular video as much as George Holliday’s blurry zoom and night-vision aura historicizes his 1991 Rodney King footage. As white plainclothes officer Daniel Pantaleo applies a violent chokehold that would wrench Garner’s last words from his lungs—“I can’t breathe!” he repeated eleven times—Orta’s own voice is heard: “Once again, police beatin’ up on people … ” before he is visually and aurally cut off by another officer telling him to move back. It’s noteworthy, particularly to the majority of Americans who don’t see similar actions on a regular basis, that Orta wasn’t screaming these words. He doesn’t know Garner will die, and his tone reflects a mundane frustration at white police assaulting a black man. This again.\n\nUnlike the Rodney King tape, the Eric Garner video showed a police officer killing an unarmed black man in broad daylight. The coroner deemed it a homicide, and the clip went viral online, but even such a blatantly violent and tragic video proved unconvincing evidence to even bring Pantaleo to trial. More than two decades after Ice Cube asked “Who Got the Camera?”, the answer is “everyone, everywhere, at all times.”\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the murder of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, many observers were shocked that in 2014’s media-saturated world, no one had managed to capture it on video. Yet despite the countless technological innovations to have emerged since 1991, the legal weight of such damning imagery seems to have somehow lessened. The reasons for this are numerous, arising as much from America’s foundational ideology of white supremacy over black citizens as it does Americans’ modern feeling of impotence to affect lasting change amidst a polarized political landscape and the increasing mediatization of everyday life.\n\nCan rap respond? At a very basic level, yes. The one factor connecting rap and police work, as true in 2015 as it was in 1988, is that they both rely on representation—of black bodies and black lives—as the source of their power. The story of reality rap from 1988 to 1992 was one in which the means of representation was overtaken by the surveilled, as Straight Outta Compton emerged from the fringes of political power and the global center of mythmaking. Yet in the years before and since, an array of far more insidious technologies and practices have created fictionalized representations to track, map, and isolate black citizens: wall-mounted cameras, on-street police “profiling,” gang-affiliation databases, as well as segregationist housing policies and the laws that support them. Most recently, police departments have started embedding cameras in cop uniforms and combing through Big Data sets of subjectively coded crime statistics, sending extra patrols to those neighborhoods where violations are predicted to happen next.\n\nShould rap respond? Some have, more haven’t, and most won’t. Yet silence in the face of racist surveillance tactics doesn’t represent a failure of rap any more than a camera fails for not perfectly capturing the entirety of a busy city sidewalk. Like a camera, rap is a tool of representation that can be put to many ends. Yet at the same time, what has always made rap unique from other forms of cultural expression is its bold approach toward representation, through a mixture of objective reality—street names, neighborhood affiliations, housing units, and intersections—and the fantasies and parallel lives that are back-projected onto these spaces. There is a middle ground to be found here: No, rappers shouldn’t have to feel compelled to issue creative rebuttals to state-sanctioned, technologically abetted representations of their own lives. But it’s also the case that, well before and well after N.W.A, rappers have built for themselves an artful pressure-release valve that millions like them can use when they’re finding it hard to breathe.\n\nThis article originally appeared in an issue of our print quarterly, The Pitchfork Review, which you can subscribe to here."
