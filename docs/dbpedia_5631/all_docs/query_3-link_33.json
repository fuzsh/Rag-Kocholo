        "text": "Ice Cube stands in defense of N.W.A. after a conversation on social media went left.\n\nOn Monday (Sept. 25) the West Coast rapper invited fans to engage in a digital Q&A session on X. Opening the virtual floor to ask anything, the 54-year-old fielded inquiries on music, life, and more.\n\nIn the thread, however, things got dicey. A user on the app questioned N.W.A.’s purpose, alluding to the group holding responsibility for societal shortcomings and a shift in Hip-Hop.\n\n“Was NWA part of the agenda to destroy conscious rap which was growing in popularity at the time, and promote sex violence and gangster behavior amongst the youth?” asked the account.\n\nAnother user followed up asserting “Unfortunately music did play a part with the crack being pumped into our black and latino neighborhoods.”\n\nThe “No Vaseline” performer issued a response to all X accounts in the initial thread:\n\n“Bullsh*t,” wrote Ice Cube. “Crack was in the neighborhoods a decade before gangsta rap. In the 70s they called it freebase. So was heroine, weed, Mollys, gangbanging, drive bys, pimping and hoing, dropping out of school, young girls getting pregnant, cussing and the using the word Ni**a. It was all here before NWA.”\n\nThe Barbershop actor recently announced plans to release his eleventh studio album. He shared the news exclusively on Chuck D’s RAPstation, confirming the music was in the works.\n\n“I’m working on an album that hopefully I can finish in [the] next couple of weeks and schedule to put it out and yeah, I’m digging what I’m doing,” explained the Los Angeles representative. “The name of the record is called Man Down and, you know, it’s a pretty good record. I like it. It’s dope.”\n\nView the full thread on X and Ice Cube’s response below.\n\nMore from VIBE.com\n\nTony Yayo Says Biggie Was A Better Rapper Than Ice Cube, O’Shea Jackson Jr. Responds\n\nIce Cube Announces New Solo Album Titled 'Man Down'\n\nESPN Announces 'The Crossover' Doc Celebrating Sports And Hip-Hop's Close History"
