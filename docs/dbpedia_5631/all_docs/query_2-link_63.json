        "text": "SAN ANTONIO (WOAI) - Legendary rocker Gene Simmons of KISS commented further in the ongoing war of words between rock and roll and hip hop and NWA's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe iconic rap group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame April 8 alongside various other rock artists including Cheap Trick, Deep Purple and more.\n\nSimmons originally responded to NWA's induction with a tweet that read, \"Let me know when Jimi Hendrix gets into the Hip Hop Hall Of Fame. Then you'll have a point @icecube.\"\n\nIce cube immediately responded with tweets of his own to comment on Simmons's response.\n\nStopping by for an interview with local lifestyle host, of , Gene Simmons weighed in on comments made by the iconic rapper and member of NWA.\n\nIn the interview, Simmons was asked what his favorite current artist was and Simmons responded swiftly.\n\nSimmons responded, \"My favorite is Ice Cube and NWA. What's the big deal? I know Cube, we get along fine. He thinks NWA belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I don't. I think Led Zeppelin should be in the rap hall of fame. Why can't you disagree? I don't agree. I don't agree that Madonna should be in there, it ain't rock.\"\n\nHe added, \"And if you ask these artists what kind of music they make, you walk up to Cube and ask what kind of music do you make? We're hip hop artists, ok, I agree with you. If you ask Madonna, she'll say I'm a dance artist or a disco artist. Ok, that's cool. They won't say we're rock artists.\n\nHe concluded, \"It ain't rock!\"\n\nWhen asked if Run DMC was a rock artist when they collaborated on a track with Aerosmith:\n\nSimmons added, \"The Aerosmith track because it's Aerosmith, was rock. So you can take a rock track and what you do on top of it doesn't matter. As long as it has guitar, bass, drums, it's rock.\"\n\nSimmons further clarified and stood by his original words that NWA was not rock and roll."
