        "text": "In 1988, Los Angeles hip hop group N.W.A unleashed their debut album Straight Outta Compton on the world.\n\nIt was a monster.\n\nIt sold millions of copies, shone a light on the incredible West Coast scene, and launched the careers of Eazy E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube.\n\nFull of expletives and violent lyrics, it’s credited with pioneering the gangsta rap genre.\n\nIt’s also an album that has a legendary connection to Australia.\n\nIn 1989, triple j was the only radio station in the world playing N.W.A's highly controversial track, ‘F**k Tha Police’.\n\nIt’s one of the most powerful songs ever written about racial profiling and police brutality, but it also uses the F word. A lot.\n\nBecause of its content, most radio stations refused to play it. It seems weird now to censor explicit language, but at the time swearing in music wasn’t as commonplace.\n\n‘F**k Tha Police’ caused such outrage that it made international headlines.\n\nIn 1990, Ice Cube spoke to the ABC’s Andrew Olle about the intense backlash.\n\n\"We got banned from a lot of arenas, we got a letter from the FBI, we’ve been in all kinds of newspapers and on TV, we had to do press conferences and just run through the ringer,\" the rapper said.\n\nDespite the furore, the album hit a raw nerve with American music fans.\n\n\"We didn’t get any airplay at all but we still managed to sell 1.7m records,\" Cube said.\n\nAs far as Ice Cube was concerned, he was just trying to shed light on the experience of young black Americans.\n\n\"It’s meant to tell the truth and let the world know what’s going on where I live,\" he told Olle.\n\n\"I come from a middle-class black area with a lot of drugs and a lot of problems.\n\n\"The war on drugs in Los Angeles has become a war on black people. It’s like the police vs young blacks.\n\n\"The song really brings out the frustrations that the young black community have with the police and the whole police department.\"\n\nBut Cube rejected criticism that the song promoted violence towards law enforcement.\n\n\"I want people to pay attention to the song and think about what’s going on,\" he said. \"To get past the lyrics and the bad words, to really understand where we’re coming from.\n\n\"There’s a lot of gangs and there’s a lot of drugs and basically the police say if you’re young and you’re black you’re involved in that which is not the case. If you dress a certain way or you look a certain way you’re harassed by police.\"\n\nF**kin' with me 'cause I'm a teenagerWith a little bit of gold and a pagerSearchin' my car, lookin' for the productThinkin' every n***a is sellin' narcotics\n\n\"There’s a lot of good police out there and there’s a lot of bad police. The sooner people realise that there are bad police out there the better off everybody will be.\"\n\nIn 1989, triple j really championed the song, and it ruffled a lot of feathers.\n\n‘F**k Tha Police’ happily bounced across the airwaves for six months until a couple of politicians and the West Australian police noticed.\n\nABC Management subsequently banned the song, which led to station-wide strike action.\n\nIn protest of this blatant censorship, triple j put another N.W.A. song on repeat and left the building.\n\nIt's an historic moment that will forever connect Australian music fans to N.W.A.\n\n‘Express Yourself', was played on a loop for 24 hours, 350 times in a row, instead of regular programming.\n\nBut none of this might have happened if Ice Cube had emptied his dorm room rubbish bin.\n\nIn 2018, Cube told Double J’s Zan Rowe that the song which started a global furore nearly didn’t see the light of day.\n\nDr. Dre didn’t want to do the track.\n\n\"He had to turn himself in to the county jail every weekend,\" Cube explained. \"And he was like, ‘Look man, I gotta deal with these damn sheriffs and I damn sure don’t want them to hear that I’ve got a song out called ‘F**k Tha Police’. So we ain’t doing this one'.\n\n\"I was like, 'Damn, it’s such a great song'. I just put it in my notebook and forgot about it.\"\n\nIce Cube was still in school at the time.\n\nOne day in his dorm room he and a friend were flipping through his notebook, when Cube came across the original idea for ‘F**k Tha Police’.\n\n\"I pulled it out of my notebook, I ripped it out, I balled it up and I said to my friend, 'Dre don’t want to do this one so I’m gonna throw it away'. And he went in the trash, pulled it out, straightened it back up. He was like, 'Hell no, you gotta do this one!'\"\n\nBut Cube knew he’d have to get Dr. Dre on board for it to happen.\n\n\"Dre is the Wizard of Oz,\" Cube said. \"He is the Pied Piper. If he says don’t do it, we’re not doing it. So, I just put it in my notebook and let it sit there.\"\n\nIn 1987, production began on N.W.A's debut record Straight Outta Compton.\n\nCube said while they were developing concepts for the album he showed Eazy-E his idea for 'F**k Tha Police'.\n\n\"Eazy was like 'We doing this shit!'\n\n\"Dre by then didn’t have to turn himself into the jail so he was more open.\n\n\"That’s how it ended up coming about.\""
