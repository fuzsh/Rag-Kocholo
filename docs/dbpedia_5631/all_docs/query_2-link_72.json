        "text": "N.W.A. entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Friday, with the groundbreaking quintet that reflected the rough streets of Los Angeles in a style known as gangster rap, defiant against those who have suggested rappers didn't belong in the institution.\n\nThey joined the rock hall in a ceremony at Brooklyn's Barclays Centre with 1970s-era rock acts Cheap Trick, Chicago, Deep Purple and Steve Miller.\n\nN.W.A.'s rough-hewn tales tilted the balance toward West Coast rap in the late 1980s on songs like Boyz-N-The Hood, F—- the Police, and Straight Outta Compton.\n\nFollowing the act's breakup, Dr. Dre became one of music's most in-demand producers and a billionaire with a high-tech headphone company. Ice Cube has since moved between music and a successful acting career.\n\nFor all their success, some traditional rockers have resisted the inclusion of rap acts into the hall, most prominently Kiss leader Gene Simmons, whose band was inducted in 2014.\n\n\"I want to say to Gene Simmons, hip-hop is here forever,\" said MC Ren. \"Get used to it.\"\n\nRock 'n' roll is not just a musical style but a spirit that connects people, be they bluesmen or punk rockers, Ice Cube said.\n\n\"Rock 'n' roll is not conforming to the people who came before you but creating your own path in music and in life,\" he said. \"That is rock 'n' roll and that is us.\"\n\nNamed for one of N.W.A.'s best-known songs, the movie Straight Outta Compton told the band's story and was one of the biggest box office winners of 2015.\n\nProof in the ghetto\n\nThey were inducted by Kendrick Lamar, who said N.W.A. members \"proved to every kid in the ghetto that you could be successful and still have your voice while doing it.\"\n\nThe other inductees were '70s rockers, but with divergent styles.\n\nChicago was known for a brassy, jazz-rock fusion in its early days and settled into a comfortable career penning pop hits. Among their favourites were Saturday in the Park, 25 or 6 to 4 and If You Leave Me Now.\n\nHe joined the band for a verse of Does Anyone Really Know What Time it Is?.\n\n\"If you think Chicago was your mom's band, man I want to party with your mom,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe pride of Rockford, Illinois, Cheap Trick's career soared in the late 1970s when a live album recorded before a gleeful Japanese audience added excitement to tracks like Surrender and I Want You to Want Me. Turning up the volume for the night, they performed both songs.\n\nThey were inducted by a fellow Midwesterner, Detroit's Kid Rock, who noted that most bands in attendance that night consider themselves great live acts.\n\nCheap Trick live\n\n\"Then you go and see Cheap Trick,\" he said. \"That's when you think, we kind of suck. I better step up my game.\"\n\nThe rock hall also paid tribute Friday to two recently deceased rockers, with David Byrne and the Roots collaborating on David Bowie's Fame and Sheryl Crow singing the Eagles' New Kid in Town to honour the late Glenn Frey.\n\nMetallica drummer Lars Ulrich described seeing the night's first inductees, Deep Purple, when he was nine years old and taken to their concert in Copenhagen. He said it changed his life.\n\n\"Almost without exception, every hard rock band of the last 40 years — including mine — traces its lineage back to Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple,\" Ulrich said. \"They are always considered equal. In my heart, I am bewildered that they are so late in getting into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\"\n\nThe band was without one of its founding members, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, who stayed away because current members wouldn't agree to play with him. But the inductees regarded him warmly in their speeches and paid tribute musically — performing Smoke on the Water with the signature riff that the guitarist created.\n\nUlrich called it the guitar riff \"that has actually been banned from playing in music stores to preserve the sanity of the staff.\"\n\nSteve Miller lashes out\n\n\"If you listened to the radio, you listened to Steve Miller,\" said the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach, who inducted Miller with his partner Patrick Carney.\n\nBut it seems Miller's appearance almost didn't happen.\n\nAccording to several reports, the 72-year-old rocker ripped into the rock hall when speaking in the press room afterwards.\n\n\"The whole process is unpleasant,\" he said, saying it needs to be \"changed from the top to the bottom.\"\n\nMiller said he didn't feel the artists being honoured were respected, adding he was allowed two tickets only with extra ones costing thousands more dollars.\n\n\"I said 'I'm playing here, what about my band, what about their wives,\" he said.\n\nMiller continued even after a publicist tried to wrap things up.\n\nThe organization issued a statement afterwards on Friday.\n\n\"Rock and roll can ignite many opinions. It's what makes it so great. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was honoured to induct Steve Miller tonight and congratulates him.\""
