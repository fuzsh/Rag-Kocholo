        "text": "The First Tee of Northwest Arkansas in Lowell has named Elizabeth Prenger as its new executive director, the nonprofit announced Tuesday (Aug. 15).\n\nShe will lead operations at the organization while continuing her role in development and community relations as director of outreach, according to The First Tee.\n\n“Elizabeth has been a key part of the success of this program, and we were thrilled to promote her to this critical position,” Chris Woodard, board president, said in a press release. “We have some big ideas and goals in our future, and we need a leader who can see them through.”\n\nPrenger joined the organization in 2013. Before that, she was executive assistant for two years at National Institute for Excellence in Teaching, a nonprofit focused on education reform.\n\nShe was a political consultant for four years before that in Washington, D.C., and in Little Rock.\n\nShe has a communications degree from the University of Arkansas and is working toward becoming a Certified Fund Raising Executive.\n\n“I’m honored to continue the momentum that has made this program soar over the past 12 years,” Prenger said in the release. “Our previous executive director, Mike Shea, has left us with a wonderful teaching facility and large programming presence in Northwest Arkansas and I am determined to take the organization to the next level. Thanks to the support of our programming staff, volunteers, board of directors, donors and The First Tee families, we have a bright future ahead of us.”"
