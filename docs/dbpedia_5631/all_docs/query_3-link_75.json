        "text": "When you’re on top,everyone wants a shot at the title. It happened to Run-DMC, it happened to LL and it happened to NWA. It just so happens that most of the songs shitting on Compton’s favourite sons are hilarious and seem surprisingly consistent in the accusations of the crew being a pack of fake sissies who ‘enjoy the company of other men’ in the Biblical sense. I’m sure there a few more that I’ve missed a couple but this is a good start to proceedings.\n\nRomeo and Master Rhyme\n\nThe record that spawned ‘Compton’ N Tha House,’ Romeo and Rhyme went to high school with Eazy so it’s safe to say that this is pretty personal. If you want to imagine how part two of this record might have have played out, refer to the comment section of my 2015 post with special guest Master Rhyme.\n\nNothin But A Fan\n\nA.Z. (Mob Style)\n\nAzie Falson responded to ‘Real Niggaz’ in a typically laid-back fashion, notable for this doozey: ‘Y’all man left, cos y’all were fuckin’ one another.’\n\nDon’t Dis Nobody\n\nPretty Tone Capone\n\nThe lead MC from Mob Style didn’t take too kindly to N.W.A. taking his crew’s shine as the ‘The World’s Most Dangerous Group’ and may or may not have been involved in putting a shoe in the lads when they performed as The Apollo. In theory, I should have asked him about it when I interviewed him in 2015, but it seemed in poor taste to ask him to start snitching on himself at the time.\n\nMarked For Death\n\nKidnapped\n\nTim Dog\n\nBefore he was swindling lonely white women out of their savings with dreams of releasing a five CD Greatest Hits box set, Timothy Blair was making a name for himself with one of the best marketing gimmicks of the early nineties – declaring war on Compton. He stayed true to this cause later in his career when he turned his attentions to Snoop Dogg on ‘Bitch With A Perm.’\n\nFuck Compton\n\nStep To Me\n\nChoice\n\nScore another point for the second’Niggaz With Activator’ reference and yet another Eazy-E lookalike as the original Rapping Stripper confronts a bootleg NWA in a boxing ring in a song that I assumed was penned Willie Dee until the part she compares him to ‘Chester the Child Molester.’ Just for added lulz, Choice claims that Too $hort ate her out on tour in the third verse, which is not for the faint of heart considering that she once boasted about having ‘a pussy ’bout the size of Bolivia.’\n\nThe Payback\n\nH.W.A\n\nMC Ren is a target for once on this effort from 1990, being described as being recruited to the crew ‘to make up space/cos they needed the look of a monster face.’ Baby Girl then proceeds to call out Dr. Dre for hitting a woman with a chair in public and claims that ‘Yella you’re bi, and go both ways.’ Despite calling Eazy-E ‘a little-ass midget’ who ate her out and made her sick from the smell of is Activator on this song, Ruthless were more than happy to sign these three broads a couple of years later in the hopes that Slut Rap would make it big. Sadly, they were too far ahead of their time and terrible at rapping.\n\nThe Conflict\n\nDresta\n\nAs one of Eazy-E’s most loyal buddies once Dre jumped ship, it’s understandable that Dresta didn’t take too kindly to the brief NWA reunion with Snoop long after E’s death.\n\nFuck NWA\n\nUltramagnetic MC’s\n\nAfter their boy Tim Dog went at NWA, it’s tough not to read this as an answer to ‘Real Niggaz,’ despite to direct references to Eazy, Ren or Dre. But Ultra have never been about calling out names directly, as they were pioneers of the kind of subliminals that could burn your soul slow.\n\nYou Ain’t Real\n\nIce Cube\n\nHahahahahahahahahahahhahahahaha. The most effective diss record in the history of rap? Just might be.\n\nNo Vaseline\n\nBonus: Tarrie B\n\nIt was pretty ballsy for Eazy-E’s Comptown signee Tarrie B to go off on Dr. Dre on her Power of a Woman LP, and she apparently copped a beating from the good Doctor after calling him a ‘faggot’, exposing his wife beating ways and, most hurtfully, accusing him of employing Ultimate Breaks and Beats a little too freely."
