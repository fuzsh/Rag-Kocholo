He works closely with top organizations in Arkansas, including its largest employers, state leaders, educators, local government officials and chambers of commerce. The initiatives he’s most proud of are those that set up NWA for inclusion and growth: the Bella Vista bypass, the Health Care Transformation Division and EngageNWA. A native Arkansan, Nelson enjoys being able to balance an exciting career with the low-stress lifestyle of NWA.\n\nAmy shapes the overall look of the Council’s communications. In her current position, she aids the Council in designing reports, presentations and more to ensure the Council is presenting a modern and bold look. Amy has worked in communications and design for over a decade. Amy’s experience reaches beyond design. Raised in Arkansas politics, she studied in performance arts and has operated a small business.

With a master’s in business and background in marketing and communications, he sees the benefits of collaboration to help foster a circular economy in Northwest Arkansas. While Lee enjoys the lakes, rivers and trails in NWA, he’s also well versed in the art of auctioneering as a state licensed auctioneer.\n\nRyan’s focus is on supporting the health care system in our area and ensuring its future development to keep our population healthy and strong.

She is focused on building diverse, cross-sector community action and bridging experiences and has been instrumental in uplifting Welcoming Week NWA as a signature regional initiative. Monica brings decades of community development and social justice organizing experience across difference. She practiced human rights law in England and was admitted to the bar in the Turks & Caicos Islands. Monica was born in London to immigrant parents and has lived in many different communities around the world. She speaks fluent Gujarati, and conversational Hindi, and is working on her French speaking skills. Monica believes that localized community action and racial solidarity are foundational for building belonging, bridging and justice for all.\n\nSerafina is dedicated to building a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem in Northwest Arkansas. As the executive director of StartupNWA, she is focused on cultivating a thriving innovation economy by offering valuable resources for founders – through increased access to capital and talent, relationship building, and elevating good ideas and success stories.

He lives in Bella Vista with his wife and three sons and loves to hunt, fish and just about any excuse to be in the outdoors.\n\nAlicia is responsible for both social listening — staying on top of regional happenings, news and announcements via social media — and managing FindingNWA’s social media marketing and advertising campaigns. She’s built an engaged audience (over 110,000 strong) and is dedicated to inspiring and spreading the love of NWA, from its professional opportunities to its staggering natural beauty.\n\nAs executive director of Groundwork, Duke works with community partners across sectors to address housing affordability in the region.

Justin has worn many hats over the years and is no stranger to NWA. Being a Bentonville native, Justin is excited for the constant growth and diversity happening in the community. Don’t be surprised if you turn on the TV and see Justin pop up in a commercial, TV show or even a film. Justin is an avid performer when it comes to film and theatre. Every now and then you might even catch him performing in a live show.\n\nStacey works on Council member relations, but she also provides support to the Council’s health care transformation division and other initiatives. The cross-functional nature of her role lets her really take in the breadth of the organization’s impact and all the community members it touches.\n\nKamron is a native of Northwest Arkansas and is excited by all the growth that has happened in the region during her lifetime. She works in all aspects of the Council overseeing the day-to-day office duties, working with Council membership, monitoring certain financial records and preparing for meetings with members, partners and guests.
