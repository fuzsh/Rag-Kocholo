        "text": "Before we begin this, let us be clear: American Songwriter does not condone violence. Not against peaceful American citizens, not against law enforcement.\n\nHowever, as the country and its people witnesses yet another video in which police brutally murder a non-violent, non-threatening citizen—this time Tyre Nichols—it’s important to understand the emotion and the experience that underlies the rap song “Fuck Tha Police” by N.W.A.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nBelow, we examine the protest track “Fuck Tha Police” from N.W.A.\n\nThe Song’s History\n\n“Fuck Tha Police” is a protest song from the rap group N.W.A. The song dropped in 1988 as part of the group’s LP, Straight Outta Compton. The origin of the song is also a prominent scene in the group’s collective biopic, also named Straight Outta Compton.\n\nThe lyrics for the song talk about police violence and police brutality, along with racial profiling. These are felt all too often in Black neighborhoods and have been for decades. In fact, some police reformists, including the NAACP, allege that the police department itself was created as a means to find and punish runaway slaves.\n\nSince the song came out, the title continues to play a role in contemporary culture, appearing on T-shirts and in other political arenas. Big-name groups like Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Rage Against the Machine, and even the Insane Clown Possee have been part of covers.\n\nThe Content\n\nThe song parodies the courts by presenting N.W.A. producer and DJ, Dr. Dre, as a judge who is hearing various trials prosecuting the police department. The rappers in N.W.A., from Ice Cube to MC Ren and Eazy-E, each take the stand to testify before Judge Dre. Each rapper criticizes the police.\n\nAnd the end of the song, the police are found guilty of being redneck, white-bread, chickenshit motherfucker[s] despite the fact that “officers” in the song say that the rappers were lying. Dre orders him from the court.\n\nTo open the track, the booming-voiced Ice Cub raps:\n\nFuck the police comin’ straight from the underground\n\nA young nigga got it bad ’cause I’m brown\n\nAnd not the other color so police think\n\nThey have the authority to kill a minority\n\nFuck that shit, ’cause I ain’t the one\n\nFor a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun\n\nTo be beatin’ on, and thrown in jail\n\nWe can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell\n\nFuckin with me ’cause I’m a teenager\n\nWith a little bit of gold and a pager\n\nSearchin’ my car, lookin’ for the product\n\nThinkin’ every nigga is sellin’ narcotics\n\nYou’d rather see me in the pen\n\nThen me and Lorenzo rollin’ in the Benzo\n\nBeat a police outta shape\n\nAnd when I’m finished, bring the yellow tape\n\nTo tape off the scene of the slaughter\n\nStill getting swole off bread and water\n\nThe FBI and Censorship\n\nAfter the song was released, the FBI wrote to N.W.A.’s record company saying that it did not approve of the song, alleging it misrepresented police. Many believed its claim—claims that continue to be harder and harder to discredit in the wake of George Floyd’s murder and now Nichols’ at the hands of police.\n\nIn his autobiography, former N.W.A. manager Jerry Heller, who split with the group acrimoniously, wrote that the letter was actually from a “single pissed-off bureaucrat with a bully pulpit” named Milt Ahlerich, who was falsely representing himself as part of the FBI. Nevertheless, Heller removed any important documents from the N.W.A. offices in case there was an FBI raid.\n\nIn 1989, Australian radio station Triple J was playing the song (the only radio station in the world at the time to do so) for around six months. Soon the Australian Broadcasting Corporation banned the song. Triple J staff went on strike and put N.W.A.’s “Express Yourself” on a continuous loop from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nIn 2011, New Zealand musician Tiki Taane was arrested on charges of “disorderly behavior likely to cause violence to start or continue” after performing the song at a club.\n\nToday\n\nWhile the song may seem offensive to some, even brash and harsh, it’s important to note that it comes from a place of creativity and expression. Those who feel anger at the song may not have the same experience as those who wrote it and perform it.\n\nArt is a form of expression, even if it causes discomfort. And as time passes and more and more people are found killed at the hands of police—from Floyd to Nichols to Breonna Taylor to countless others—maybe, just maybe, the song has always been truthful in its original intent and message.\n\nWith clarity can come change.\n\nPhoto by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images"
