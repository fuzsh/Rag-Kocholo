        "text": "Thatâs Iceberg Slim.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nMake some noise for Iceberg Slim, please. [applause]\n\nIce-T\n\nLot of people donât know, Iceberg made an album, which he didnât rhyme, which thatâs from the album Reflections. See, and the thing with Iceberg Slim was he told stories, but it was the front, the A and the B side of the game. It wasnât always you win, you lose. Because thatâs what the game really is. Itâs not a always win situation. All my friends in the penitentiary and all of them dead, I know thereâs a B side to this game. So my thing was if Iâm going to talk about the streets, I got to show you both sides of it.\n\nI had an epiphany because I was admiring Iceberg Slim and Iâm trying to do everything. Iâm trying to pimp. I remember when the girls that we used to have that we used to boost with us, we had girls that boost with us and girls we steal jewelry with, and then I decide I tried to pimp on them and they was trying to run like a motherf-----r. They was like, âOh, Ice is trying to pimp on me.â Iâm like, âCome on, baby, you sitting on 20,000. You got to come on.â So Iâm trying to push them that way. Pimping is difficult. [laughter]\n\nJeff Mao\n\nSome have said it ainât easy.\n\nIce-T\n\nIâm really just trying to do what Iâm admiring, this hustling and this game and people say, âWell, you cut for this, you got light eyes and youâre not really fascinated.â Iâm not really fascinated with pussy if itâs not aimed at me. Itâs like you could have a bunch of guns in this room, but if theyâre not aimed at me Iâm not worried about it. All the women can have all the pussy in the world, but if that shitâs not aimed at me, like itâs coming for me, f--k it. Itâs not my pussy. [laughter] I could be around a lot of girls and they donât fascinate me. Iâm like cool, you know? You just want me to hit on you so you can laugh about it, but Iâm not hitting on you unless I know you trying to f--k me, for real.\n\nBut anyway [laughter]. One day I got this epiphany, Iâm like, âIceberg Slim isnât just a pimp and a player, heâs a writer.â Heâs a writer. Thereâs so many hustlers and players in the world, but who knows their name? Iâm not going to be known, because players have these dreams of, like Cube says, âLooking at the Goodyear blimp,â and parades. This is the delusions that players have. I was like, if Iâm going to be known, if I want to go down in the books, I canât just live the game, I have to document the game. And thatâs how Iâm going to be known about the average cat on the street. Thereâs a lot of Ice-Ts out here. They just ainât made no records. They just ainât wrote no books. So I said Iâll document the game. When you listen to my music, donât listen to it like a rap record. Listen to it like me telling you stories over music. But itâs not meant to dance to. We intentionally used beats that you couldnât dance to, because youâre supposed to sit back and listen to me kick game. Thatâs what all my records are about.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nI mean, yeah. That makes complete sense, actually. Because I was going to ask you, at some point in this conversation, sort of the conventional musical format of a certain era of hip-hop from this city is like P-Funk style beats and things like that. Youâve consciously shied away from that.\n\nIce-T\n\nConsciously.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nYeah.\n\nIce-T\n\nOnce I find out somethingâs easy, I donât want to do it no more. Chuck D says Ice-T is the only person he knows that does things that jeopardize his entire career, to stay awake. âIâm Your Pusherâ was the first rap record with a singing hook. It was a hit. I never did it again. Because âIâm Your Pusherâ had a Curtis Mayfield hook, and it hit, I thought it was cheating. Iâm like, âThatâs too easy. I canât, f--k that, no more singing hooks.â\n\nBecause I just think itâs too easy. And Iâm not going to do something I see somebody else do. So Iâm trying, because real players, you want to be original. I want to pop open some shit you never seen. I want to introduce you to things. If I pop up in this motherf-----g Gucci jacket and a n---a in the front row got one on, Iâm going to burn this shit backstage [laughter]. You dig? Because that ainât fly. Itâs like them shits was on sale, son. Whatâs happening? My music always steered away from what normal people was trying to do. It always had to have its own lane. It always had to sound different.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWhen did cats start calling you Ice? Iceberg Slim was obviously an inspiration to you.\n\nIce-T\n\nIce comes from, âSave some more of that ice stuff T,â because I wasnât letting people call me Tracy. They would call me Tray, they called me Crazy Tray. Tracy starts fights. I go in a new neighborhood, they like, âOh Tracy? n---a thatâs a bitch name.â I gotta swing on a n---a I just met, you know? [laughter] I never really had no problem. Iâm six feet tall, 210, Iâm not worried about nobody. You know what Iâm saying? Iâm not a little guy thatâs worried. Iâll get busy. I just try to avoid conflict. So we took the Tray and it turned into T, and then people you say, say some more of that Ice stuff, T. Ice-T is really Iceberg T. My real homies call me Berg. Bishop Juan said, ân---a, you Ice, Iceberg. n---a, you know that name is wanted in the streets. N---s want to be Ice, everybody wants to be Ice, n---a. But you got that name and you got a brag n---s canât shut you down, n---a. You got it, thatâs your name until you gone, motherf----r.â I named my son little Ice. His name is ICE with all capital letters because he doesnât have a name, he has a title. Yeah, church. You know, the key to being ice cool is when you win, you donât get that happy. When you lose you donât get that sad. Itâs like, âIce, you just won the lotto,â Iâm like, âWord.â âIce, somebody just wrecked your car,â âDamn.â [laughter] Thatâs how you become Ice, you dig?\n\nJeff Mao\n\nSo when did the actual hip-hop style of rhymingâ¦ You say you were kicking the street rhymesâ¦\n\nIce-T\n\nHip-hop, hip-hop started for me, after I came out the military. I went in the military because I was a teen parent. I came home and the two things was happening. The dance situations with Bay 5, Wreckinâ Cru, Uncle Jammâs. Shit was popping off. And my homies who had gone from small time criminals to big time criminals, and they say, âLook man, we stealing, we hitting these jewelry spots. This is the lick, this is what you do.â I was from the military so I had no training but for that shit. Iâm like, âAll right, come on, letâs go get money.â While we getting money, we would get the money, and then we would go to these parties. Then because we was getting so much money, we was the best dressed motherf-----s at the party.\n\nWhen you would go to Uncle Jammâs Army, you would see somebody like Ice-T show up with 40 people, girls and guys, all Fila draped head to toe, with the jewels on and the perms popping. You like, âWhat are these, are these some hybrid gangster-pimp-hustler-young LA players?â Thatâs where it started. I wanted to do parties like them, and I found out that I would get more attention from these little rhymes I had written. You got to remember, nobody had ever made no money rapping yet. No one had bought a car rapping yet. When I tell my friends I want to rap, they like, âN---a you better get this money man, all that old rap bullshit.â N---s talk down on it. I was like, âCool.â I remember I would still go to Uncle Jammâs Army and I would ask Rodger [Clayton] and stuff like that. Eventually they let me get on the mic. I went up there saying whatever I had to say. That was my first taste of standing in front of large audiences.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nTodayâs been declared Uncle Jammâs Army day in Los Angeles, all right. What did Uncle Jammâs Army mean? What does it mean to this city? How important was that movement?\n\nIce-T\n\nYou got to remember, back then even for adults, there werenât a lot of clubs like now, you have lots of clubs, night clubs and things like that. There werenât and if you were 16 to 21, you couldnât get in it. Well, 20 you couldnât get into a club. If you was black, and even 20, you wasnât getting into the Hollywood clubs. You had a few places you could go. They tapped the market that was... The other option is a house party. And a house party in LA is a potentially death trap, because basically what you do in a house party, most people out here that have houses, the house party is in the garage, and itâs in the back, and they put the turntables back there, and then they have red lights and shit. That whole driveway is a kill zone. Itâs dangerous, right. The motherf-----s drive by and they blast in that driveway, you can get it. Very few people even let you into their house.\n\nWhen we was in high school, they would take these index cards, and it would say, date, gate, mate, rate, and late. Date is where, gate is... I mean, the date is when, the gate is where, the mate is whoâs throwing it, and the rate is how much it costs. Then they would have a name of a song at the top, like Big Payback. Iâm not going to that f-----g party [laughter]. Shitâs called the Big f-----g Payback. They would hand out these index cards and thatâs where the parties would be. This is before the flyers. When Uncle Jammâs Army came out, all of the sudden you start seeing these flyers up on the post of the streets. Then they had radio commercials. You knew it wasnât a house party. Then once you went to one, it was more girls and more action than ever.\n\nThe one thing about an Uncle Jammâs Army party is it was not a concert. See, if you go to a concert, you come in like this, and you expect people to perform. Uncle Jammâs was a dance. You went there to catch. There were girls there, and there were guys there, so youâre out there trying to pick up. It was more of a mating situation going on out there, than a... If you go to a concert tonight, you ainât expecting to meet nobody unless you finna play the parking lot, you dig what Iâm saying, or the girls bathroom, some old pimp shit, I know how [laughter]. Give you all n----s secrets and shit. The best place to pick up chicks is in front of the girls bathroom at any club. Just stand there, you gone get to see them in the white light, they probably left they man for a hot second, and if you intercept them right there, you can get more numbers then you just work the averages [laughter]. Just stand there. Donât waste your time running through the whole club. Just stand right by the girls bathroom [applause]. But you got to pose to be chose. You got to be fly, you got to catch them looking first, you dig? When they look a little too long, you say, âBitch, Iâm in a orange suit, you know, I ainât no UPS man. Whatâs happening?â [laughter] Thatâs another game. Back to this.\n\nUncle Jammâs Army was a dance, not a concert. Itâs the music played continuously. The dance floor was just packed with people. Back then they was doing the freak, which is basically just dry humping to a rhythm. Love the freak, run that back. Some n----s is still doing the freak. Some n----s done never learned no new dances, thatâs all they know is just the freak. They come to the party to push up on you.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nNow, thereâs always this documentation of New York hip-hop history, where itâs the cats from uptown came downtown to do parties and thatâs where you have this scenes intermingling. Was there an equivalent of that in LA?\n\nIce-T\n\nNo, in New York you had the hip-hop scene which went downtown to the upscale people, Andy Warhol and people like that got ahold of it. They had a thing out there where they called a truce with the street gangs in order to party. Thatâs what the Zulu Nation did. We said, âLook, weâre not going to be able to have these parties if yâall act up.â Thatâs one thing we know about clubbing is that once somebody gets shot, or something happens the girls stop coming. Thatâs the end of the party. Ainât no party with a bunch of dudes, you know what Iâm saying, ainât going to happen. We used to run clubs, we had clubs up in Hollywood later. Water The Bush, United Nation, and I used to tell them that this club is based on pussy per square foot, you dig? If you stock the pond with enough women, the guys are going to come. If we put ugly girls in this club, they gone buy beer. If you put hot chicks they buy champagne. This is basic business here yâall, ya donât understand. The girls get in free because they donât spend money anyway, and the guys pay to impress.\n\nWhen you take it down to a high school level, you still need a lot of girls. Girls ainât coming where somebody could get hurt. They like, âNah, nah, Iâm cool.â You have to keep a lid on the nonsense. Hereâs the problem. Everybody in LA donât go everywhere in LA, right. See, Iâm sitting in Inglewood, I donât come to Inglewood âcos I got all this blue on. You understand what Iâm saying? We from another part of LA. Different people wonât cross different lines. If you from Compton, they never cross Manchester. Compton is 10 square miles. People stay in they little sectors in California, especially the guys. When Uncle Jammâs threw a party, it was so big, it would draw people from all the different neighborhoods, all different gang sets. You have a potential powder keg.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWell what about Radio? Because this is one of the places that you really made your home.\n\nIce-T\n\nOh, now Radioâs a whole ânother thing. The Radio was a club down by MacArthur Park that was run by a Russian named Alex Jordanoff and a white guy named KK and they were the first club that really played hardcore hip-hop to upscale white, kind of new wave crowd. Glove played there. Glove, my DJ who played on the song âReckless,â he played there. Egyptian Lover spun there. But they would bring New York acts. And thatâs also where they shot the movie Breaking. That was a real scene. But when the movie company came in, they didnât want to pay Alex and call it the Radio so they called it the Radiotron. Thatâs that Hollywood bullshit and they figured a way to cut him out of what he created. But it was the first really hardcore New York-ish hip-hop club in LA\n\nNow Uncle Jamâs Army wasnât playing rap because there was no rap records. They were playing techno. So I called Uncle Jammâs like the first rave. They were doing a rave and didnât know what it was. It was all DJs and local DJs who were really nobodies but became stars in the world of Uncle Jammâs Army. Egyptian Lover just told me the night he became Egyptian Lover. Iâm like, âWow.â It was a very erotic experience that turn him into Egyptian Lover. He was like, âIâm the Egyptian motherf-----g Lover right now.â So people were being born in there.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWell, when do you feel like you really started to find your voice then as an MC? I mean, we know the track that sort of set it off butâ¦\n\nSpeaker: Ice-T\n\nI didnât know what I was doing. I was just trying to get out of trouble. I seen rap as a vehicle. I saw Run DMC play and they had lasers and I was like, âYo, this shit is rock & roll. This is gonâ be big.â This is me only playing in garages. So when I saw somebody... See, when somebody takes it to another level, it lets everyone else know there is another level. A lot of kids may never have thought of acting and then they see me acting and then they go, âDamn. Thatâs somethinâ I could do.â When Barack Obama became president, itâs like, âDamn. That can be reached.â We put these limits but thereâs really no limit. I mean, speaking of acting, they told me the other day, they said, âDo you know youâre the longest running black actor in television history?â\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWow.\n\nIce-T\n\nI was like, âHow the f--k did that happen?â But 19 years on SVU.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nThatâs amazing.\n\nIce-T\n\nItâs amazing. So I donât know. I started making records... I did one record called âThe Coldest Rap.â It was all right. Then I got with Unknown DJ who was another guy that was part of the scene and Unknown, I was trying to get him to do a record on Hen Gee and Evil E, my DJs and stuff. He was like, âYou gotta do a song. You gotta do a song.â So I did a song called âYa Donât Quit.â Then I did another song and my boy Randy Mac was like, âTalk that shit you be talkinâ though. F--k this hip-hop shit. Talk that shit.â Iâm like, âNobody wants to hear that shit.â Thatâs when we did â6 In The Morninâ.â [applause]\n\nThe B side wins again, â6 In The Morninââ is just an adventure of one personâs journey but itâs really... I write faction. Itâs a fictional story using factual occurrences but the occurrences couldâve happened from a lot of different people, but it makes a good adventure. So all the things in the story happened but maybe not to me but Ice-T lived this adventure. I knew this song was a hit because I got a call from the Fillmore West in the Bay and they were like, âYo, would you do a concert?â Iâm like, âI only got one song.â They like, âNah, nah. They feelinâ you up here in the Bay. They know all your music. They playinâ you on KMEL,â and all this. Iâm like, âWord?â Iâm like, âOK, cool.â Then four days later, they called me back and they said, âWe want you to do another concert.â Iâm like, âI just signed up to do one.â They said, âThatâs sold out.â Iâm like, âAre you kiddinâ me? I just sold out a show?â\n\nLA is a weird place. You could be famous but they wonât let you know it. [laughter] They like, âI know this n---a. This n---a went to school with my cousin. F--k him. He ainât no star. I see this n---a standinâ in front of the liquor stores and shit. F--k him.â [laughter] But then you go to the Bay, they rolling the carpet out for you because you... First off, they love the LA n----s. Then you coming in there. Iâm selling out shit. So thatâs something you have to adjust to when you from LA. LA donât really break artists. LA is really hard. They usually wait for you to break somewhere else and then they claim you. Like âOh, Kendrick Lamar, heâs the biggest artist in Texas and shit. Thatâs us! Thatâs us!â Heâs from LA, you motherf-----s. Theyâll claim you. But here, they front on you. LA people know. So yes, â6 In The Morninââ was my first big hit.\n\n[music: Ice-T â â6 In The Morninââ / applause]\n\nThe funny thing is now when I do performances and I got to come out, I got to come out, I got to go, âSix in the morninâ, police at my door.â I got to find that voice. âFresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor.â âOut my back!â I got to go there. [laughter]\n\nJeff Mao\n\nI was going to ask you about that actually. You have this register. I mean, I guess itâs for different songs and different materials which voice you decide to employ, right?\n\nIce-T\n\nYeah. You know, when youâre a solo artist, your voice is an instrument. So the worst thing is listen to a solo rapperâs album where every song sounds the same. So I can yell on some records. Like songs like âYou Played Yourselfâ or âHigh Rollers,â Iâm kind of using this voice. [changes voice] âThis is it. Dope from the fly kid. The ice mic is...â So you got to have all... Because you try to match the voice to the energy of the song so thatâs essential to me.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWhen you described in your pre-professional music days doing what you were doing, robbing jewelry stores, whatever it was, you mentioned the adrenaline rush.\n\nIce-T\n\nYeah.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nThat was unlike anything else. But how is performing? How did that relate to that? What wasâ¦\n\nSpeaker: Ice-T\n\nThat was different. This shit is not... Nothingâs like that. Nothing. I mean, if you ever... Iâm sorry to say it but thereâs nothing thatâs going to give you the rush of putting your life on the line. So when you moving through a store, you holding people ransom and shit, this shit is some other shit! You on some ole... Whooo! You know? And then when itâs over, youâre like, âDamn.â Hopefully you get away but, no, a lot of criminals are hooked on that high. Thereâs a rush that goes along with that but Iâm cool with not having that rush no more. Iâm cool. I said Iâve completed my PhD in testing the system and I lived to tell and I got away with enough felonies for everybody in this room so Iâm cool. Iâm not going to break the law. I donât break the law. I donât jaywalk in New York. Iâm going to tell you right now, Iâm not a religious person. What I do know is somethingâs going on. I donât know what it is but I know thereâs something going on. Iâm afraid to pick a religion because I donât want to end up in heaven or whatever and a Hare Krishna guy says, âRemember me in that f-----â airport? You f-----â asshole.â So I donât know which one, so I ainât picking one. But I know something is going on. But I believe honestly now, the way my life has changed, that if I break the law or I cross you or even lie to you with the intent to take advantage of you, Iâll die. I believe Iâll suffer instant karma. Because, I got away. Iâm so lucky in my life today. I got a beautiful kid. I got a beautiful life. For me to go back in that dark world, I canât do it. I can do it with my music. I can revisit those thoughts and the ways of thinking, âcause theyâre very familiar to me. But I donât want that. Iâm in search of peace. Iâm in search of helping my friends.\n\nBut I also tell people, the funk... That part, Iâm very familiar with that and seasoned in that too. So, if you choose to go there, you f-----g with a vet in that department. You understand? But thatâs not what I wish. I like to just be around people that I love and positive energy now.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWhen did you first learn about the existence of a parental advisory sticker?\n\nIce-T\n\nWell, back when we were put... That was by the time I had got my record deal and I was at Warner Brothers. And they come at me and they go, you know, they got the PMRC, Tipper Gore is out there saying rap records are f-----g up people and the same bullshit that been going on seen the birth of rock & roll. I was like, âWhatever.â They said, âThey wanna put a sticker on the record to let people know that thereâs bad words,â or whatever. I was like, âCool.â My thing was I was never trying to bait and switch you. Iâm never trying to sell you something and then youâre shocked. My attitude is if you open up a Stephen King novel and the cover is a body with a knife in it, donât get mad when you turn the first cover and somebody gets whacked. I mean, thatâs... So my album covers had guns and imagery of street shit. So, do not enter. The album cover says donât enter if this is not what you want. Donât become offended. So, I didnât mind a sticker. But it was the first record ever stickered, another first.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nRight. I mean, do you think that... Let me ask it this way... When you found your voice as an artist doing music that documented the streets, did you know immediately by necessity that you were gonna have to be dropping knowledge within that fabric?\n\nIce-T\n\nOh. Once I found out that people liked that, I was like, âOh man,â itâs like I hit a home run. I got an abundance of this shit. I could do this shit all motherf-----g day, you know? It was gonna be harder for me to rap like a rapper, to rap about parties and bullshit that didnât matter to me. That shit was... how many records could I make about that? Thatâs why now you listen to the rappers, they like, âI got a car, I got a watch, I got a car, I got a watch. Check this out, I got a watch, I got a car.â [laughter] You know? âI f----d a girl, I got a car. I f----d a watch. I got a car.â [laughter]\n\nBecause they ainât... you know, âIâm in the kitchen, Iâm cooking birds.â They have a small amount of experience. So, thereâs lack of content. So, I would read a lot of books. Iâm watching movies. Iâm trying to take in... Like even after... Right before I make a record, Iâm taking in all the information I can so that Iâm able to express a lot of knowledge. But because I had been in the game. You gotta remember, I started rapping when I was 27. I was no kid. So from 18 to 27, I was on the street. So, I had real shit to talk about.\n\nThatâs why I listen to these little n----s say, âYeah, Iâm 14.â N---a, you ainât never even, only bird you saw was at Popeyeâs n---a, like stop it. They ainât been in no...Get the f--k outta here. A lot of Scarface shit. So, you know... And then I also come from a zone where the n----s that was around me wouldnât allow me to lie. So, I got homies that really been there. And n----s tell me, âIce, you ainât gotta lie because the shit we did was too real.â So keep it within the realms of reality. You ainât got to say you killed 50 n----s. You ainât killed 50 n----s, you probably would, but you havenât. So donât say it. I kind of, like, didnât know you could lie. I didnât know you could take pictures with girls that werenât yours. I didnât know you could stand in front of cars that werenât yours. I didnât know you could wear other peopleâs jewelry. I didnât know that was okay. I thought like... Thatâs not allowed in the street. n----s like, âN---a that ainât your rope n---a.â Like come on n---a. Like whatâs good? So, I was always reaching for being real. It was imperative. Itâs paramount. We canât fake the funk. Somebody will check you. And you know, for me to be from LA and to be doing this shit so long, and never have been challenged. Youâve never heard nobody come out at me, ever. That says a lot âcause n----s know. Mothaff-----s woulda came at my head. âOh yeah, that n---a Ice T...â Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And theyâd be like, âIce-T,â then theyâd say, âNo thatâs Ice and... ooh, oh, thatâs who them n----s... OK, cool, chill, Iâm sorry. I take that back.â So, you know.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nBut, at the same time, itâs like you are documenting this and also providing a lesson, like you said, both sides of the game.\n\nIce-T\n\nThe game is... Rap was just a stepping stone man. I just wanted out. I wanted the big house. I wanted the fly shit. I wanted everything every other hustler wants. Rap was just a way out. It was like a low hanging fruit. Like, âOh, I can get out of it by telling stories about the shit I did? Oh, come on, thatâs a lick.â And then, when Iâm doing that, I get a call to be in New Jack City. Iâm scared shitless. I canât act. I canât act. Iâm like are you kidding me? And the way it happened, Iâm in a club and Iâm hollering at some girls and Mario Van Peebles said he heard me in the bathroom talking shit.\n\nI was in the bathroom talking shit. Iâm like, âYeah, the problem is man, n---a, if they could put me under a microscope and find one molecule in me that gave a f--k then n----s could angle me you know? But they canât figure me out âcos I donât give a f--k about these mothaf-----s.â So, he said, âWhoever said thatâs gonna be my movie.â So then, he walks up to me. Iâm talking to some females and shit, campaigning [laughter]. So he comes and says, âI want you to be in a movie.â I thought that was that Hollywood bullshit. You know, when you see somebody from Hollywood, you walk up to âem, âWe should work.â Thatâs that bullshit. Iâm like, âYeah, yeah, you be in the movie. Here. This is who they are, blah blah blah blah.â So he said, âCall Warner Brothers tomorrow.â So I call Warner Brothers, they ask me to come there. And he was on the up and up. So I read the script, Scotty. Iâm like, âYo dog, this is like all the lines.â He goes, âYeah.â And Iâm like, âYo this is a cop.â Heâs like, âYeah.â Iâm like, âThis n---a got dreads, I got a perm.â I was more upset about the hair than the cop [laughter]. So I call up the homies. Iâm like, âYo they want me to be in a movie man. You know what Iâm saying? They want me to play the police. How you feel about that?â N----s like, âWord. Could I be in the movie?â So then, Iâm like OK, so Iâm gone call, you know, talking to my boys in the jail now, you know, I respect them. Like, âYeah, you know, I know you in the bowels of the devil and whoop de whoop, and we reached you with that money but they want me to be in this movie. They want me to play the police. How you feel about that?â âWord. If I was out, could I be in the movie?â So, you know, the homies wasnât giving me no guidance. Right? So, of course, Iâm getting my hair done at Good Fredâs and the girls, Iâm telling the girls they wanna, they was like, âYeah n---a, you better be in that movie because this is an opportunity. And yâall up here complaining about the conditions in the hood. Now you got an open door. If you donât take that Ice, youâs a real life sucka. And plus, we know, when you make it you gone keep it 100 and you gone tell...â Well, they didnât say 100 back then, âbut you gone keep it real and you gone tell mothaf-----s whatâs going on down here, not like these other mothaf-----s. And if you donât do the movie, donât come the f--k back up in here.â So I did the movie. And the movie made 87 million dollar. I got paid 23 thousand dollars. Welcome to Hollywood. You know, but that was the door that led me to the next movie, which was Ricochet with Denzel Washington. Thatâs when I thought I was going to get paid, right? Joel Silvers, the producer, heâs one of the biggest producers in Hollywood, he does The Matrix, so Iâm walking in there like Iâm finna get paid, jack, itâs Denzel, this shit is on, son. Itâs for real. I walk in there, I say, âYeah man, Iâm going to get paid on this movie.â He goes, âUh, Ice-T, youâve done one movie.â So I took it in the ass one more time. It was like... thatâs a figure of speech [laughter]. But that movie I made double the money for less the work. The first movie I really got paid was Tank Girl [laughter].\n\nJeff Mao\n\nTank Girl. Yes.\n\nIce-T\n\nI played a kangaroo [laughter]. Yeah. Because you trying to get checks and it ainât working, so Iâm making a movie with Keanu Reeves called Johnny Mnemonic. Keanu Reeves had just done the runaway bus jumped off the gauntlet, so heâs hot. Iâm up to here, Iâm getting paid. I get a call from my manager. He goes, âYo, they want you to play a stripper in Arizona.â Iâm like, âWord? Hell f-----g yeah, Iâm with that.â So that night I did like 1,000 sit-ups [laughter]. Because I always been kind of in shape, you know what Iâm saying? So I was like, âOK, I got to get my LL Cool J buffness on now. Watch this.â So Iâm in there trying to get swole real quick. And the next day they send me a picture of a kangaroo. And they say the movieâs called Tank Girl. Iâm like, âKangaroos? Look at this. What kind of stripper am I? What, I got a pouch? What the f--k has happened?â [laughter] Iâm sitting there, and so Iâm like, Lori Petty, this and that. And they told me Stan Winston was doing it, and I was like, âOK, I donât know, am I going backwards?â When they told me how much money they was paying me, I was like [hops around the stage like a kangaroo / applause] You know what Iâm saying? I got a check for that, you know what Iâm saying? Itâs like a million dollars. You n----s would hop for a million dollars too. I was like... And people were like, âYou selling out.â Let me tell you, selling out is when you do something that goes against your integrity. I wasnât selling slaves, the f--k you talking about? I have nothing against kangaroos. Nothing whatsoever [laughter]. You know? Nothing. So I was like yâall, I can do the movie and itâll pay for some things. It allowed me to build a recording studio.\n\nI follow Orson Welles, and Orson Welles said he didnât like to act, he acted in order to be able to direct. So I learned from that that sometimes you got to do what you got to do to be able to do what you want to do. To fund what you... So I was like, I could take that money, I could build my recording studio, and then I donât got to spend money on budgets. This is a move right here. You got to know how to make those moves. That led me to more and more movies.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nAnd doing your own thing with the music. Continuing to do your thing with the music.\n\nSpeaker: Ice-T\n\nDoing my music, but now from my crib. I had a house now in the hills, I got a studio called the Crack House that everybody in LA recorded in. I got a situation. Now Iâm moving forward.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWas that like around the O.G. album cover? Is that what that was? Or was that a different?\n\nSpeaker: Ice-T\n\nThe O.G. album cover, this was after O.G.. This is when we started _ The Seventh Deadly Sin_ and some of the other records, we recorded 100% in my house.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nNice. When did O.G. as a term, when was the first time you heard that?\n\nIce-T\n\nI heard it, thatâs a gang term. O.G. just means the originals of a particular set, like not the second generation, the people who invented the set. Since Iâm an older cat, I was around when a lot of these sets were born. They had Hoover Crips, 7459 Hoover Crips. I donât even know if there was a â60s back then. There wasnât a â40s. The different gangs just happened. You didnât have a Front Hood, you just had the regular â60s and they had the [inaudible] gangsters. But some of these gangs came out of nowhere, like they would just be born. So the people who start those sets would be the O.G.s, original Gangsters. Then in LA we also use it for just original, the O.G. 501âs, jeans, those O.G. Chuck Taylors. Anything that was the originalâ¦ O.G. white K-Swiss. That first shit, thatâs that O.G. shit. OK? What happened was I knew the term, and I come out, I had three albums out. I had Iceâ¦ I had Rhyme Pays, Iceberg, and Power. When N.W.A dropped, up to that point the term gangsta rap hadnât been coined. When Cube came out, and in the first verse of Straight Outta Compton, he says, âFrom a gang called n----s with attitude,â see? He didnât refer to N.W.A as a band, a rap group. He referred to them as a gang. The press called it gangsta rap. So I said, âOK, if this is gangsta rap, Iâm the original gangsta.â And thatâs where the O.G. album came from.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nIâd like to show a clip actually. Thereâs a ton of great performances from your career online, but I would like to show one.\n\nIce-T\n\nPlease donât show no old shit of me looking goofy [laughter]. This is such a distinguished interview at this point. Donât play no stunt real in this.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nNo, this on point.\n\nSpeaker: Ice-T\n\nIâm nervous now.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nCan we show the âO.G.â performance?\n\n[music: Ice-T â â99 Problemsâ / applause]\n\nIce-T\n\nWell, whatâs your question. You know that was the first version of it.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nYeah.\n\nIce-T\n\nUh, I was sitting with Brother Marquis from 2 Live Crew. And he was telling me how he missed âWoop There it Is.â Now, âWoop There it Isâ was a big hit record back in the day. âWoop! There it is.â And what that was was a song that... And the DJs from Magic City made that record.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nOK.\n\nIce-T\n\nAnd, when the girls would strip, and when they would bend over and you could see it, they go, âWoop! There it is!â Thatâs where it came from. And Marquis was like, âN---a they saying that shit right in my face.â That was the phrase that pays. Right? And right after that he says, âMan I got 99 problems and a bitch ainât one.â Iâm like, âWhat the f--k did you just say?â And he said it again. And I said thatâs a song. So, you know, in my mind I went. I got DJ Ace and I went to make a record, and the song was all about different types of girls. âI got a hoe from the east, I got a hoe from the west, I got a hoe that likes the jacket off, and rub it in her chest, I got a bitch in the north, a bitch from the south, a bitch that loves to suck it long and hold it in her mouth, a bitch with hair, bitch with none, bitch with a knife, bitch with a gun...â So, Iâm naming off all these different bitches. But at the end I go, âAnd I love âem all, I love âem crazily and they love me back, thatâs why they stay with me, so if you having girl problems, I feel bad for ya son, I got 99 problems and a bitch ainât one. Hit me!â Now, thatâs the song. That was on the Home Invasion album. Itâs like my fifth album, I think. So Chris Rock is my friend. Chris Rock and me became brothas from New Jack City. So, Rick Rubin was with Chris Rock and he was like, âYo man Iâm about to work with Jay Z, I need some ideas,â and Chris Rock said, âYou gotta do this record.â So they took it to Jay Z. Jay Z listened to it and he put his spin on it. And you know, I got paid. They paid publishing for it, you know. And the record came out. The cold thing that got me with Jay... He didnât only take the â99 problems and the girl ainât one.â He took the âhit me.â The hit me got me more than the rest of it! âCos he goes, âIf you having girl problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems and the bitch ainât one. Hit me!â The n---a took my hit me. That... The hit me. Like this n---a went in like, âIâm taking that too n---a.â [laughter] But, you know, it was music. Now people like, well why Jay Z didnât give you a shout out? You know. He could have said that?\n\nJeff Mao\n\nHe gave you the publishing rights?\n\nIce-T\n\nThat ainât really Jay Zâs get down. Jay Z just does his thing. I woulda liked if he had said, yo coulda said my name in it, like DJ Khaled at the end, âIce!â You know? Do something. You know, I mean Jay Z super, super duper. You know? I remember I met Jay Z. Big Daddy Kane brought Jay Z over my house back in the day and Jay came over. He was wearing a little backpack and shit like he was... He was rapping with this guy named Jazz. He had a record out called âHawaiian Sophie.â He was a little young kid. And he was just sucking the game up. And we would talk, and Jay was listening to every... See, like we got f----d for our publishing. Jay Z didnât. He was a student to where every G that he would be around, he would take their game and apply it. So, you gotta take ya hats off to Jay Z âcos Jay Z was just that smart. I remember we put him in a Bentley, him and Dame got in my Bentley. And they was like, âWhy this Rolls got a B on it?â Iâm like, âYou n----s is from the hood, for real. You know. This is a Bentley.â But they was my n----s you know. And at first we took Jay Z off to Sway and Tek and that was the first time I seen somebody just rap like that without writing. He was just... Made a rhyme up in his head. He sat there for a minute and stuff. But heâs like a prodigy. Heâs a special person. He has that ability. Everybody canât do that. So respect to Jigga.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nAnd you actually reclaimed the song by redoing it.\n\nIce-T\n\nWe did it Body Count.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWith Body Count, right.\n\nIce-T\n\nYeah. We did it on the blood... No, no, on the Manslaughter album. We remade the record just for the hell of it. The record label wanted to do it. They like yo, we wanna bring it back, you know. Iâm not somebody right now thatâs in search of any kind of credit. I mean, Iâve had a very extreme life, a very extreme career. Iâve gotten my share of everything. People say, âWell you donât get enough respect.â Iâm like if I got more respect, mothaf-----s would carry me around. Like, you know what Iâm saying? Iâm good. Iâm good. You know? I donât feel anybody owes me shit. When Dre got a billion dollars, people called me up, âDid Dre give you some money?â Iâm like, âWhat the f--k Dre supposed to give me some money for?â Dre paid me the $20 dollars he owed me. You know what Iâm saying? People think that thatâs how this game goes, but no, itâs like you eat what you kill. You know what Iâm saying? You know, you gotta go out here and bust your ass. Thatâs why I got so many different jobs, because I like fly shit. I want fly shit. And it just donât come from sitting on your ass. So, when I figured out I could do a little acting, do a little rapping, create another band, write a couple books, produce some TV show, do all theâ¦\n\nJeff Mao\n\nDirecting.\n\nIce-T\n\nDirecting. Iâm just trying to do everything. Youâre only here for a short period of time man. You know, you gonâ sleep whether you want to or not. You gonâ pass out, and between that bust yo ass. You know what Iâm saying? Sleeping is not a choice. You will go unconscious. So, when that happens, go unconscious. Then, when you get yo ass up, get back to work. You dig what Iâm saying. But just sitting around. You know, I used to go to work. I would get up at 5:00 in the morning, Iâm on the set busting my ass. Man, I had n----s calling me at 1:00 in the afternoon, âYo, yo, I f----d up.â Yeah, you f----d up, n---a, you woke up at 1:00 in the afternoon, n---a. What is really good? You was out all night and all that,â and, ya know, it requires a grind. This week grind, I came out here, I came out here Saturday, rehearsed, did the Loud Wire Music Awards Tuesday. Got on a plane Wednesday. Flew back to New York, did Law & Order Thursday, Friday. Got back on the plane this morning. Got here an hour ago. Iâm sitting here. Imma do Uncle Jammâs Army. Get on a flight back to New York because I gotta be back on the set Monday at 5:00. So, you know, you gotta be willing to put in that level of work. Itâs not, itâs not, itâs not, it just doesnât drop outta the motherf----g sky.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWell, I mean, ya know,the thingâ¦\n\nIce-T\n\nI like this couch. See Iâm so glad that you had some luxury so we could luxuriate during this shit, but I mean Iâm lacking, I mean I thought a cold glass of water or some shit should be within arms reach or something for a player. But, you got Red Bull. And, this is a Red Bull event. So, we gonna blow this up. And, Redville, Red Bull, you need to be cutting me a motherf----g check âcos [holds up can] I, I, I believe I have wings [laughter]. And, you know, I got a daughter now. I got a one-year old daughter so I ainât turning down no kinda work, no kinda work. You, you know, I mean I got to hustle the rest of the way out, man. I gotta a little daughter. Her mama she got, they got... That little girl got expensive taste already, you know what Iâm saying, so, I gotta hustle.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nYeah, no doubt. I think weâre gonna open it up for questions if anybody has someâ¦\n\nIce-T\n\nLetâs do some questions, âcos I done rambled enough. And, the thing of it is, I can answer questions about so many different things. Whether itâs music, whether itâs film, television, streets. I know a lot of shit.\n\nAnd Iâll tell you the truth, I think my brand is honesty. I think, you know, people go, âIce, even if Ice is doing a lemonade commercial, that motherf----r does not give a f--k and heâs just being Ice,â ya know. So, once you find out that thatâs what your brand is, itâs a blessing âcos you just do you and you donât have to fake the funk.\n\nSo, letâs answer some ques... Who? Who? Theyâre dark out there. Itâs like the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nDo we have a question for Ice?\n\nIce-T\n\nJust yell it.\n\nAudience Member\n\nMy name is Kevin Clark, from Okayplayer.com. I just wanted to ask you, if you had to define your style using your favorite video game, what would it be?\n\nIce-T\n\nDefine my style?\n\nAudience Member\n\nYeah, your rap style orâ¦\n\nIce-T\n\nResident Evil.\n\nAudience Member\n\nCan you elaborate, like, why?\n\nIce-T\n\nItâs just that, you know, I just wander through the hip-hop game, you know, looking to find the right room where Iâm supposed to be and motherf-----s is jumping out at me and I got a shotgun.\n\nAudience Member\n\nAlright, thanks, bro.\n\nIce-T\n\nWhat kinda question was that? [laughter]\n\nAudience Member\n\nI know you love video games.\n\nIce-T\n\nYou, but ya know, yeah, yeah, but I, yeah, that was my favorite game. Itâs my favorite game. Question.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nAlright, whose next?\n\nAudience Member\n\nI got a question.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIs there another mic?\n\nIce-T\n\nTwo. Thatâs good.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nThere are two mics and weâll alternate.\n\nIce-T\n\nGo. Yes, sir. Yes, sir\n\nAudience Member\n\nAlright, respect guys. Been a fan since Colors came out when I was in elementary school. Gotta question. The Art of Rap documentary was incredible, an incredible contribution to hip-hop culture. I wanted to know if you had any other documentaries planned for the future and, if so, what would be the topic?\n\nIce-T\n\nNow Art of Rap was done... I was sitting at home, I was just watching TV and I, I mean, I just felt hip-hop was going on a severe turn downward. You know, it was lack of skills and it just... I said, you know what? A documentary is supposed to document things. So, lemme see can I grab the hip-hop I remember, the people that were a part of my life, while theyâre still alive. And, if you notice, at the end of the Art of Rap, how many people had passed, we had that scrolling of all the people that weâd lost in hip-hop. And, Iâm like, you not gonna be able to get Dr. Dre, Afrika Bambaataa, you ainât gonna be able to get all these people. So, I wanted to capture that. And, I just said, look, weâre not gonna talk about beef, cars, money. We gonna talk about the craft. And, I think we came off with a great project.\n\nNow we have the Art of Rap tour, which has been touring for the past three years, where I try to pick people that represent the craft. My man, Hen Gee, is doing the Art of Rap Latino, trying to go down into Mexico and represent that. Thatâs not... Iâm not gonna do another one. Thatâs for you to do. People say, âWell you didnât reach the south,â or thisâ¦ I only try, I only deal with my journey and at the end of that I had a 3 hour movie, which had to get cut to 90 minutes to get in Sundance. That meant I had to cut some of my friends out. That was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.\n\nBut, my future is, I wanna do film and direct. I got a movie that Iâm, I wrote and Iâm working on now called The Dark which is a kinda horror movie, kinda a little Dexter, a little Saw, a... Because with the success of Get Out, I think people are ready for that. So, itâs a revenge based movie. Thereâs an old movie called Dr. Phibes with Vincent Price. You know itâs gotta be Ice-T. Itâs gotta be Resident Evil. Itâs gotta be dark side. Like, Cube, he went and did a lot of comedies and stuff, and I take my hat off to that, but now I canât do no motherf-----g comedy. So, I gotta, I gotta do a movie that when you see it, people go, âYo! This shit, I donât know if I like that shit, like, yo, Ice f----d with me bad,â like. I wanna f--k your head up. So, itâll have a weird cult side to it.\n\nI talked to Quentin Tarantino about helping me with the film and he said, âI canât help you, Ice. First off, youâve been making movies your whole career. What are all these albums? These are movies.â And, he says, âIf I help you, people are gonna give me the credit.â He said, so you go do the movie when itâs time, ya know, itâll be the shit. So, thatâs my next thing, a feature film. Itâll be very bizarre, youâll probably hate it.\n\nQuestion.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHi. Thank you so much for coming out. I wanted to know if you... With suicide thatâs happening right now with the millennials, I wanted to know if you are involved in any non-profit organization of youth and music and the importance of it or would you like to be part of that?\n\nIce-T\n\nIâm not against it. I mean, I noticed that, you know, kids are going through lots of suicide and things of that nature. I think with the Internet, a lot of that is fueling the fire, a lot of the bullying and things of that nature, but, you know we talking about music, I mean, I was listening to three different records the other day talking about I wanna die. You know, thatâs kinda like suicide music, you know what Iâm saying? I never said that... Even âPac and Big were writing ready to die records and Iâm like, thatâs one topic you wonât ever hear me talk about. Iâm not trying to jinx myself. Iâm trying to live around this motherf----r.\n\nBut, I would be, you know Iâm not against it. I have so many charities and people... Most my money has always gone toward gang prevention and intervention because thatâs the closest thing to me. I think when you pick a charity, you have to pick something that you are really involved with. Like people that are into cancer, they usually have lost somebody to cancer. Or different things like that, AIDS. Well, most of my friends have died out in these streets. So, thatâs really where my heart is, is with gang prevention and intervention. But, Iâm willing to talk later. You could talk to my people.\n\nAudience Member\n\nYes, I actually got a card here for an upcoming event for you. So, Iâd like to give that to you.\n\nIce-T\n\nThatâs beautiful. Hold on to that and weâll do that later, OK? Are you going to the Uncle Jammâs party?\n\nAudience Member\n\nDamn right. Yes.\n\nIce-T\n\nIt was a trick question. Thatâs where you can hand me that, at the party.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOK, I will. Thank you.\n\nIce-T\n\nOK.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI got a question going back to Club Radio.\n\nIce-T\n\nYes, sir.\n\nAudience Member\n\nGlove and I were talking on the way over here, and I wanna thank you, and my question is, I was always amazed at how you kept the violence outside the club. I just always remember you saying, itâs about the music, itâs about the music.\n\nIce-T\n\nWell, it wasnât that hard at Radio âcos the hood didnât really know the Radio existed. The Radio was, like, in the cut at MacArthur and the only cats that really knew, it was word of mouth. Like I had to bring, I remember I brought Spike and all my homies over there and Iâm like, âItâs a club by MacArthur Park, and theyâre like, âWhere?â Iâm like, âItâs hip-hop.â Theyâre like, âWhere?â Iâm like, âThereâs white bitches.â âWeâre okay, letâs go. Where we going B. Pick me up.â And we got there and I just showed up and it was a place to practice my craft and Alex kinda made me the head of the stage. Do you know how Glove got his name? Do you? Not by me, by Alex. Glove was bringing the equipment in. And Alex said, âYo I need a DJâ and Glove said, âI could DJâ and he goes, âYou need a DJ nameâ and he had on gloves. He said, âYou the Glove tonight.â True story, am I wrong, Glove? Thatâs how it happened. And then Glove was spinning every night and I just kinda became the rapper, and we just became friends.\n\nI remember one night, Madonna was there and they were like, âThere is this girl downstairs that says she can singâ and Iâm like, âWho is she? Madonna. Never heard of her.â She had this one record called, âPhysical Attraction,â sheâs new. So we take her downstairs and she shows me the album cover, Iâm like, âOK come on, you gonna go.â And what I would do is, I would introduce people at the Radio like they were the biggest shit. Iâm like, âJust from a world tour, her helicopter just landed in the parking lot. Itâs about to go down yâall, Madonna!â I would do this for anybody and then if you sucked Iâm like, âIâm never gonna introduce you again.â\n\nSo Madonna came out, she start singing, âSexual Attractionâ and at that time, I had a girlfriend named Lisa. So I ended up becoming part of Madonnaâs show. Sheâs dancing, next thing you know, sheâs taking off my shirt and playing with me and shit, and Iâm just going along with it and my girl was pissed. Iâm like, âThat was part of the show, Iâm just part of the show.â But I was feeling it, that shit was fun. But Madonna went on, she was there with Jellybean Benitez that night. She went on and actually me and her ended up signed to the same label, Sire, so it was interesting.\n\nI ran back into her once she was super mega wealthy, and stuff and I said, âMadonna,â she remembered Ice and... It was good shit back in the day, the Radio. But we never really had a violence factor at the Radio. Uncle Jammâs army, on the other hand, got gangster. Once the Rolling â60s found out that the Sports Arena was close, was just like catch the five and catch that bus, you could just ride right up to the... You could pull right up in front of the Sports Arena, it was on. And they would come deep. I remember it got pretty heavy. But nobody ever got killed at an Uncle Jammâs army party so thatâs one plus. You might get stomped the f--k out but no one ever got murdered.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOnce.\n\nIce-T\n\nNo gunfire. Right? Nobody ever got shot so... Yes sir.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI said once.\n\nIce-T\n\nSomebody got shot?\n\nAudience Member\n\n[inaudible]\n\nIce-T\n\nGid.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhatâs up man?\n\nIce-T\n\nWhatâs up, baby? Where did they get shot? I remember Rory got his assâ¦\n\nAudience Member\n\nAt the shrine.\n\nIce-T\n\nAt the shrine. But not... It wasnât indoors? It was outdoors. It wasnât inside your shit. The one thing about throwing a party is, once you let the people out, a lot of people are outside that never came to the party. LA is an inherently dangerous place. Especially when you bring people from all over to one place. You got cats that never seen each other and are sworn enemies.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nReal quick, do you recall much about Breakinâ and Enterinâ? I know everyone talks about Breaking. But the documentary, Breakinâ and Enterinâ was before that...\n\nIce-T\n\nIt was a guy named Topper Carew, wanted to do a little thing on breakdancing and it was a documentary, a girl named Kelly Minter was involved with it. And they just kinda ran around... Egyptian Lover was in it, Glove was in it, and it was one of the early documentaries about the LA scene. The good thing about it, all of us are friends and it was easy to get. Just even like, getting me here, if Gid and these guys call me, Iâm not gonna say no. If it wasnât for them I wouldnât had the... See the thing of it is, is like, Gid and them didnât give me my first record deal, but they gave me the first chance to see hope, like, there is something else. Because Gid and them knew, when they was dealing with me, I was one foot in the grave and the other one on a banana peel, we was... I wasnât gonna be a rapper, but they were the first people in the streets that was getting money legit. I was doing the numbers. Everybody else wasnât doing the numbers, but I was in there looking and when they would do the Biltmore or something, Iâm like, âThese n----s got $200,000 up in this motherf----r,â so I was figuring it out and I knew I could never really be a part of them, but I was aware that, that was a hustle and it was inspiring. Question.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIâm a little short so I gotta take this out. First off, thank you so much for coming out here, it has been amazing to hear you talk. My name is Kelsey, I write for Earmilk and Iâm also a host of a radio show and I love to ask all artists who come on my show the same question and I would love to ask you. When exactly did you first fall in love with hip-hop and I know that you have talked about Iceberg really influencing your style and everything, but when was it like a time when you were just like, âYo, this is it. This is the shit. hip-hop is amazingâ and not just as a career, but just the music itself?\n\nIce-T\n\nI was in the army and when you are in the army, you are with people from all over the country, and the guys from New York had tapes. They had the tapes of Flash and they had tapes of the radio stations and I was like, âYo thatâs coolâ and of course I think the record that broke everybody was âRapperâs Delightâ and when âRapperâs Delightâ came on, hip-hop is just some kind of amazingly fun sounding thing. Hearing people rap like that was amazing. Now I thought I could do it. The trick with hip-hop is, itâs a culture, but itâs tangible. Itâs not like if you go to an opera and you can see an opera or watch somebody figure skate and you say, âI can never do itâ but with hip-hop, with a little practice, you could do it. So with a rapperâ¦ Now, to be a rapper, you have no practice just say any motherf-----g thing [laughter]. Just f--k it. It donât even gotta be on beat. Just... âPercocet. Molly. Percocet.â F--k it. But with a little practice, you could be a DJ, with a little practice you could be a breakdancer, so it wasnât so far outta reach. But it was when I heard âRapperâs Delightâ because I had... Previous to that, I used to write gangbanger rhymes. And I would write rhymes at Crenshaw, before I even knew what hip-hop was.\n\nWanna hear a gangbanger rhyme? A pre-hip-hop rhyme? Here go one. This is when I used to live in this area with my man Franzell in Triangle Park and we was like a... We had convinced them n----s at Crenshaw that we had 100 people, but it was just three of us in a gang. But we had them scared. But it went like this... Now this is five years, ten years before anybody had ever heard of rap. Itâs, âFall into a party on a Saturday night, and I left the pad, down and out for a fight, had on a waistline leather, Leviâs cuffed, under the coat, I knew I was buff because I was driving that iron, getting ready for the set, and I was packing a punch a n---a never forget, the ring in my ear was hanging halfway to the floor and I was so tight, I walked sideways out the door, now the hooptie was lifted, front, side and rear, glass was all tinted, wasnât none of it clear, it was Cragered down,â Cragerâs. âIt was Cragered down, with a cold ass pearl, deep as diamond tucking the goddamn world, I had quadraphonic headphones with a tone you could fix, under the seat, I had a â30 at six, now on the way to the party, I was scraping and hopping because I knew by tonight, there was gonna be some popping, when I got to the set, I just lay it on the ground, the Buddhist came to check it out from Chinatown, and when I fell in the party there was women for days, I was looking crazy in some hellified ways, I just walked in the corner, listening as they talk, first James Brown record I jumped up and crip walked, now I was walking so hard, couldnât no one compete, I was about to turn out the party with my goddamn feet, but then some n---a went and got out of line and his nose, my fist had no trouble to find, after driving the iron so hard all that day, I punched his grill in, in one hell of a way, but his partners fell out and so did mine, squabbling went on for quite a long time, then all of a sudden I heard some popping, I knew not to soon this fight would be stopping, I seen â22s, â38s and a â45, I knew not too much would be left alive, n----s broke out in a goddamn rage, I even think I seen a sawed off gage, but cuz, I was sent from hell not heaven, I broke out with the chrome plated 357, and the name of the game is simply survival, at the end of the night ten was dead on arrival, and me and my partners, we was gone like the winds, police blamed it on the Crips or the Brims, but some n----s knew in the corner in the dark, them crazy n----s reside in Triangle Park, they go by the name of Bronet, Zel and Tray and they belonged to the association called the EPA,â we called ourselves the Eliminators Pimping Association [laughter]. Thatâs some shit, I would do that at Crenshaw and entertain people, so when I read âRapperâs Delightâ Iâm like, âI could do it,â the problem is, thatâs not syncopated to a beat. So it took a while for me to learn how to rhyme on beat. Some people still think I canât do it, but thatâs when I fell in love because it was something that came out that I thought I was already good at.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you so much.\n\nIce-T\n\nThank you. OK.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nWe got one more?\n\nIce-T\n\nLetâs do three more?\n\nJeff Mao\n\nThree more?\n\nIce-T\n\nLetâs do three more. I mean you know, make it beautiful. Always add, give them a little extra. OK, yes sir?\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhen I was growing up, I grew up on three people that mentored my life forever and they all came from the hip-hop world. One of the guys was named Steve Jano, he used to sell mixtapes with Sir Jinx and Dr. Gray at the [inaudible] swap meet. One of my greatest mentors, and I learned my work ethic from this gentleman. The second person I learned my work ethic from was Rodger Clayton. If it were not for this guy, I wouldnât have the work ethic and the drive I have in my life today, and I thank his family for creating who I am today.\n\nIce-T\n\nThatâs real talk. Respect Rodger, rest in peace, my dude.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI grew up with Egyptian Lover and Arabian Prince and the first place where they DJd at was The Cave in Lennox, California. And the second thing is a question. How did the Soulja Boy beef start?\n\nIce-T\n\nWanna get there?\n\nAudience Member\n\nHuh?\n\nIce-T\n\nYou wanna do that?\n\nAudience Member\n\nYeah.\n\nIce-T\n\nAlright this is what happened. It was a mistake. I did a mixtape with some of my friends and you know, I was in the mix booth getting ready to rap and right before I go in, they poking the line, they like, âMotherf----s donât wanna hear you, n---a. They wanna hear Hurricane Chris and Soulja Boy,â now you canât tell a n---a like me that. So me thinking... Iâm in a studio, I just went on an Ice-T rant. Nowadays, you canât even rant because motherf----s got cameras and telephones and everything around you, like I could be in the studio and Iâm talking to you, and I look over, and the homie got a camera, âWhat the f--k is that?â âN---a, this is hood TV n---a...â âTurn that shit off.â I might segue into a murder at any moment, you know what Iâm saying? But that moment they were talking shit, so of course I was like, âMan f--k [inaudible],â they taped it and they put that at the beginning of their mixtape. It was never meant to get out, it was just me talking shit. It wasnât personal. So by the time people heard it, it sounded like I just woke up out my bed and went in on dude. I donât even know dude. So later it came out and he said some shit like that to me and my son was like, âYou gotta reply, you gotta reply,â so I said some more shit but... Thatâs why I donât say names. Because this shit turns into something thatâs bigger than what we are out to do.\n\nI have nothing against Soulja Boy, I have nothing against anybody really. I have an opinion. Just like if you ask Celine Dion about singers, Iâm sure she has an opinion, but itâs not hate, itâs not, âI donât want this cat to eatâ or whatever. Heâs a kid, whatever, itâs not that deep. But the Internet will turn it into something deep and try and make it into more, because thatâs what they feed off, nowadays. So I had to learn my lesson.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI just have a quick thing to say...\n\nIce-T\n\nYouâre Soulja Boyâs father? You came to kill me?\n\nAudience Member\n\nNo.\n\nIce-T\n\nYou came to kill me.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIâm just a student of the game. Will hip-hop go back to its roots?\n\nIce-T\n\nNo.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThatâs where it deserves to go back to, the roots.\n\nIce-T\n\nYou could say that forever. One thing I learned from Quincy Jones is, itâs not going backwards, things will always go forward. You aint getting rid of smartphones, you aint getting rid ofâ¦ Shit will continually go forward and if you donât progress with it then you are gonna be a dinosaur. You donât have to be a fan of it, but that is the future. Let me tell you about hip-hop. Hip-hop follows the drug. Whatever the drug is, thatâs what hip-hop sounds like. I come from the crack era. Thatâs where Wu-Tang Clan comes from. DMX. Thatâs that [shouts] because coke has you amped. Like, âYo! F--k that! Wow!â Right? Now n----s is on cough syrup. So itâs a sedative, they are the... Theyâre dancing like this, they just like, âYo, yo, yo...â And theyâre on prescription medicine. Thatâs heroin, so itâs kinda like a sedative. So if you come yelling at these new rappers, you like, âYou f-----g up my high.â They just want a molly, Percocet, molly, Percocet. So until the drug changes, the music is gonna sound like that. So you gotta get to talk to the drug dealers.\n\nAudience Member\n\nExactly. Thanks for your time.\n\nIce-T\n\nWe need crystal meth to be big and then music will get back amped [laughter]. Iâm just making jokes, you dumb motherf-----s.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThanks for the time, Ice.\n\nIce-T\n\nBut itâs true, the music does follow the drug, track the movement. OOKkay. Two more.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nI think we got, yeah two more.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHow you doing, sir?\n\nIce-T\n\nYour the last one, sweetheart. Let her go, letâs end with the woman.\n\nAudience Member\n\nLadies first.\n\nIce-T\n\nLadies first. See thereâs a gentleman left in California.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI donât think this... itâs not on. Or is it? OK. Hi, OK so I write conscious rap and this is kind of an interesting segue from what you just said, but right now a lot of people donât listen to conscious rap until youâve actually made a name for yourself and if the beat slaps, people are gonna listen to it, so it doesnât really matter what you are saying. Did you ever experience, during your time at, with your music career, having to change the way your music sounded so that the community would vibe with it?\n\nIce-T\n\nI come from a different era, where if the record wasnât on the radio, kids wanted it. They went to record stores. I had a girl over my house and she was looking at the gold and platinum records and she says, âYou sold a lot of records, when?â I said, âWhen people used to go to the record store.â She says, âWhatâs a record store?â 21-year-old girl. So youâre in a different era now. That being said, I never got played on the radio. I never got, KDAY, they never f----d with me. When Chuck says, âToo black, too strongâ he meant for BET. BET never f----d with me, they never f----d with Cube, they never f----d with KRS One. So the lane you are taking, you know who is gonna embrace you? White people. And when the white people embrace you, like I said, the black people are like, âSheâs heard. Sheâs ours.â Theyâll come. Have you been to a reggae concert?\n\nAudience Member\n\nYeah.\n\nIce-T\n\nItâs all white people. Itâs all white people, because white people are more interested in the black struggle than black people because black people are like, âI been through that shit, I know what you talking about, I donât need you to tell me how f----d up it is.â But white people are like, âWow, Iâm learning.â Real talk. I believe, I predicted the future. If you wanna go... Iâm just gonna say this, before this. If you wanna go see Ice-T predict the future, go to the Internet, put in, âIce-T predicts iTunes,â and five years before iTunes came out I predicted the exact format that theyâre working on right now. Everything from my house. Now my next prediction. If a 21-year-old Public Enemy came out, a young one, real young, not 30, kids. If a young like... J. Cole and them are kinda close but they are not as militant as KRS One. A real militant, young kid, and a Lauryn Hill. A rebirth of that young, powerful black woman, speaking about soul... Can you sing?\n\nAudience Member\n\nOh...\n\nIce-T\n\nOh, shit. There you go. âWell thatâs nice, go back A&R, move her and take her out of here,â you need to sing. Singing or you need to hookup with the right singer, somebody thatâs hitting. But if your lyrics are that potent and that heavy...\n\nAudience Member\n\nCompton?\n\nIce-T\n\nTo that potent and that heavy.\n\nAudience Member\n\nCompton.\n\nIce-T\n\nCompton?\n\nAudience Member\n\nI think [inaudible].\n\nIce-T\n\nOh shit, some Crips is in here. OK, but it could happen.\n\nAudience Member\n\nDoes it matter whether Iâm a female or a male?\n\nIce-T\n\nIt doesnât matter. A woman is needed right now.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you!\n\nIce-T\n\nA woman is needed because you got the Nicki Minaj, you got the Cardi B, youâve got the Remy Ma but Laurenâs gone and she was the biggest. The hottest. So that female with that powerful, the Queen Latifah, that shit. It could really hit, but you need the right music. You gotta have a song behind it because now everythingâs melody based. Itâs not the boom bap. Thatâs my opinion... Ya know run with it. But it could work right now cause itâs needed. But donât expect radio to give you any play. Donât look for help. Just keep grinding. Just keep grinding. And when it pops, itâll pop.\n\nBut, the worst thing you can do is think somebodyâs gonna help you. Anybody in here that wants to be successful, the thought somebodyâs supposed to help you or care. Your dream is your dream and only your dream. No matter how much you sit in front of me and tell me about your dream, itâs not my dream. Itâs your dream and no ones gonna push for it like you. You could sit me and I could say, âYeah, I hear you. I feel you. I feel you.â Five minutes later Iâm back into my shit. Iâm into mine. I gotta deal with whatâs mine. So whatever is yours, you gotta go for it. Nobody, not even your man is gonna want it as much as you and if you donât have that drive itâs not gonna happen. Itâs just not gonna happen.\n\nOK, one last question.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nMan, thank you so much. I needed to be around a shit talking motherf----r tonight boy, I tell you.\n\nIce-T\n\nA real player, thatâs what Iâm talking about.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHey listen, Iâm a Vietnam veteran from that era. I heard you spoke upon yourself being in the military. What was that like for someone like you and how long did you stay in and what branch of service?\n\nIce-T\n\nI was 25th infantry.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOh fun.\n\nIce-T\n\nI was at Scholfield barracks. I mean, I went into the military because I had a daughter.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOK.\n\nIce-T\n\nAnd I had a daughter in high school and you know I wasâ¦\n\nAudience Member\n\nCompton.\n\nIce-T\n\nCompton!\n\nAudience Member\n\nHeâs in the dark.\n\nAudience Member\n\n[inaudible]\n\nIce-T\n\nOK.\n\nAudience Member\n\n[inaudible] ask a question, when heâs through.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHold on bro.\n\nAudience Member\n\n[inaudible]\n\nIce-T\n\nOK. So you... Letâs get back to the question\n\nAudience Member\n\nYou were 25th infantry.\n\nIce-T\n\nYes sir. Yes sir. I went into the army because I had a daughter. I was on the street. I wasnât really gonna make any good decisions at that point so I went. It was a enlistment office right next to Magnificent Brothers on Crenshaw. And I walked up in there and said, âI wanna get in,â I went in for the enlistment bonuses.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOK. There ya go.\n\nIce-T\n\nIt was cool for me, I mean I wanted to do it. The only way youâre gonna make it through the military is if itâs something that you... Were you drafted?\n\nAudience Member\n\nI was drafted so I was one of those haters man, I didnât want to be there.\n\nIce-T\n\nRight. I wanted to do it. So I did like two years in, two years out. I was pretty healthy. I was pretty athletic. And I felt I could do it. Two years in, then I realized it wasnât for me cause one of my sergeantâs told me, he said, âYouâre here, because you canât make it in civilian life.â And I was like, âWowâ. Thatâs what really... I said, âNah, nah, nah this ainât the only thing I can do.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThere yeah go.\n\nIce-T\n\nNext two years I got planned on getting out, and when I got out I came right home, got in trouble.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOK.\n\nIce-T\n\nIt was... A good experience for me because it taught me how to deal with hard things like going through, ya know training and things like that.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIce-T\n\nI think you need a reference point to f----d up, so you need to know whatâs f----d up so you donât bitch about everything.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThere ya go!\n\nIce-T\n\nOnce you been to Vietnam thereâs nothing really a motherf----r could really do to you to bother you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nMy life is easy yeah. Everything is cool.\n\nIce-T\n\nItâs either that or the penitentiary.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWell ya know, by not wanting to go they say, âWell listen, if you donât go with us you going to the penitentiary for 45 months,â I said, âWait a minute I only weigh 130 pounds,â at that time, ya know I was pretty light. So I didnât want to go in there and be somebodyâs bitch. So, give me the 24 months instead of the 45 in the penitentiary. I had to go to the war and it was two years of f----d up shit man.\n\nIce-T\n\nWell see, even though I was in the military I never went downrange. I have to take my hat off to you for your service versus mine, which was just 4 years of training.\n\nAudience Member\n\nRight, right.\n\nIce-T\n\nWe gotta respect the different levels of it. But it was a great experience for me.\n\nAudience Member\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIce-T\n\nI still kinda operate on a military basis.\n\nAudience Member\n\nRight, right.\n\nIce-T\n\nLike everything has to be planned out, thought out, timed out. So I carry a lot of that with me.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThatâs cool man because, it was the worst two years of my life but it made me a better person now and thatâs the cool thing about it. I appreciate you bro.\n\nIce-T\n\nAbsolutely. OK. Letâs wrap it up. Compton?\n\nAudience Member\n\nYo Ice. I got one quick question.\n\nIce-T\n\nThis is my boy Spike.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nOK, so this is officially our last one. Keepin it lovely.\n\nIce-T\n\nOne of my homies. He just came back from the joint, this is one of my boys that was in the streets with me early in the game. He just did 26 years in prison, heâs home. Give him a round of applause [laughter]. Weâre not applauding for the prison weâre applauding for him being home.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThe question I was gonna ask you was something that was intricate. Youâve always been a real solid friend, and, a person that I always looked up to. Especially in the early years when we grew up. Youâre a few years older than me, but, I never forget... And I talked to some scared straight programs when I was in prison. I used to always use you as a role model to the kids in a way where... Choices. In life, we make choices. Ya know I made a lot of choices and some of the choices landed me down the road that I went thorough.\n\nBut I never forget, when you and I were younger and in the hustle and bustle you had made your mind up and nobody knew. Youâre talking about the pre-Radiotron days and stuff like that. The decision that always stuck in my heart and my head even when I was doing all those years, was I remember talking to you and you said, âSpike Iâm not doing that no more,â and nobody knew except you, based on the dreams you had. Based on what your life choices were gonna be. But that is something that always stuck with me and I always would give that to the kids and I would say, âI had a friend,â without having to ya know, put your name out, âI had a friend that always made the choice, and now as an adult, and as a more mature adult through my experiences. He told me one day that, Spike Iâm not doing this no moreâ\n\nIce-T\n\nBreaking the law.\n\nAudience Member\n\nBreaking the law. Choices. My question to you is, that was embedded in you... How is it that at that time you was able to break away through those choices? Thatâs the thing in life that everybody has to decide. In life right and wrongs a thin line like a milli-line.\n\nIce-T\n\nThe choice came to me for two reasons. One, my dad. My dad taught me whatever youâre gonna do, you gotta be a professional. If youâre gonna be legit, youâre legit. You donât deal with criminals, you donât cross that line. If youâre a criminal, you donât deal with legit people. You donât straddle the line, youâre picking one or the other. If weâre criminals weâre in the underworld and we keep all our shit secret. We donât talk. We donât take pictures. You know you and I have years of our lives that are un-photographed because we played by the code... Once I decided to step on the other side of the line I told you Iâm done.\n\nNow one of the reasons it made me done was all of the players that I admired were going under. Iâm looking at all these hot cats that I admired, Iâm like, âThey going under and they calling me from the joint like, Ice donât come here man. This ainât no place for no player man. They donât know nothing about no Dom Perignon up in here. They donât know nothing about no filet mignon, you ainât cut for this Ice. You got to,â and then, once I started to try to rap, people saying, âIce, you got action. You got action. You know, white people like you. You can cross, you can get outta this situation.â And once I knew I had that chance, I had to make that decision.\n\nAnd at that point Iâm like... âCos you know the kinda shit we would do. We would hit a lick, weâd have money and then weâd go broke. Well Iâd hit my last lick and I said this is what I gotta live off at this point. We werenât drug dealers, we were rappers and stuff. So we didnât have a consistent hustle, it was like we would be sitting around right now between licks until a score came and then weâd have to go outta town whatever, make the move. I was done. Iâm like, âIâm not doing that no more, I canât leave with yaâll. Iâm gonna stay here,â and I went broke. You remember when I stopped rapping.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI remember that very well, when you had to....\n\nIce-T\n\nAnd I went broke. And I was still hustling.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI remember that.\n\nIce-T\n\nAnd sometime you would come through and ya know, throw a n---a a few dollars. Ya know, so it was like withdrawal and it was a hard moment when you broke, trying to pursue something else and you know you can snap your fingers and go get a hundred thousand to go do something. But I had made that decision man and I donât know itâs just a moment. Itâs just a moment in your life where you just say I gotta make another decision, I gotta change.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWell I wanna thank you for that and that also is intricate in my life now. You know they needed to know that you the real deal. Man, a lot of people will say stuff just for the window dressing but from me to you, you the realest deal Iâve ever known in my life. Thank you.\n\nJeff Mao\n\nI wanna thank everybody for coming out tonight and wonât you join me please, in thanking once again, Ice-T.\n\nIce-T\n\nThank you everybody. See you at the party.\n\n[applause]"
