Legendary home to some of the most ground-breaking, forward-thinking music in modern history, Priority Records has returned to once again push boundaries and shift culture. Established in 1985, Priority helped bring West Coast rap to prominence with legendary groups like N.W.A., Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg and Eazy-E while also handling distribution for labels like Rap-A-Lot, Ruthless, Death Row, No Limit and Roc-A-Fella. The iconic label celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2010.

Original LP reissue of N.W.A.'s 1988 multi-platinum hip hop masterpiece Straight Outta Compton which ranks across the board as one of the greatest debut albums of all time. One of the hardest hitting albums of any genre, the groundbreaking gangsta rap release introduced us to luminaries like Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube and had an enormous impact on the evolution of West coast hip hop and music in general with street anthems like "Straight Outta Compton," "Express Yourself" and the only record ever condemned by the FBI, "Fuck Tha Police."

"This was the start of gangsta rap as well as the launching pad for the careers of Ice Cube, Eazy-E and Dr. Dre. While Public Enemy were hip-hop's political revolutionaries, N.W.A. celebrated the thug life...Ice Cube's rage, combined with Dr. Dre's police-siren street beats, combined for a truly fearsome sound on "Express Yourself" and "Straight Outta Compton." But it was the protest "Fuck Tha Police" that earned the crew its biggest honor: a threatening letter from the FBI." - #6 on Rolling Stone's '100 Best Debuts of All Time' - Priority
