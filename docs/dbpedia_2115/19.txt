Kyle Martin was born into a radio family. His father, Charley Martin, began at KSO radio in Des Moines in the early 60’s before moving to Denver Colorado at KHOW radio.Â

In 1985 Kyle enrolled in Drake University’s school of Journalism and Mass Communication. While at Drake he began working at KIOA 940 radio in Des Moines. Taking a full load of classes and working overnights at KIOA was quite a challenge.

He graduated from Drake in 1989. In October of 1990, KIOA began broadcasting on the FM dial with an all new lineup that included Kyle on overnights as “The Midnight Rambler”.

In 1993, Kyle moved to afternoons at top 40 KCCQ in Ames. He continued there until 1995 where he moved to mornings/program director at a new music station in Grinnell/Newton called KRTI. In 1997, an oldies/classic rock format called Kyle back to Ames at a brand new station called KLRX(Clear 96.1). In 2002, he had an opportunity to return to an oldies format at KBIZ in Ottumwa.Â Eventually KBIZ switched to a news/talk format.Â News Talk was a new challenge for Kyle, he actually had to use his journalismÂ degree.

In 2017, Kyle was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a disc jockey.

Since 2004, Kyle has hosted the morning show at KFJB.Â Kyle is married to Amy and has 3 daughters, Peyton, Abby and Grace.Â He is also a proud grandpa to granddaughters Kiyah & Saige.
