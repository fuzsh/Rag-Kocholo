        "text": "This article aims to introduce to a general audience the genre known as “Shoegaze” (which is sometimes attributed to the genre “Noise Pop”) and will delve into the history, artists and characteristics of the genre. Accompanied with this is a mix to offer musical example, from the origins/traditional sound of Shoegaze to the new, modern takes on the genre.\n\nShoegaze: What is it?\n\nIn the Late 80s and early 90s, a wall of sound cascaded across the UK. It evoked a wave of emotions while remaining so very vague and undefined. Blended and blurred, this cacophony of noise introduced the possibilities beyond traditional sound. It left you in a trance, all at once in a dream and awake. A lost language before it even began and yet, somehow, it conveyed so clearly the agony of the mundane while dreaming in melancholia-inspirations. The noise reminisces and loses itself to nostalgic memories. This is what Shoegaze is all about. It may sound artsy or altogether overly poetic, but that’s the point. Want to give a song a listen? Here’s a classic Shoegaze song everyone just getting into the genre needs to hear:\n\nTechnically-speaking, Shoegaze refers to a sub-genre of alternative, indie rock. Still, what’s so special about it?\n\nThe Basics\n\nShoegaze is all about nostalgia and dreamy emotions. Rather than being like another song, a good Shoegaze song feels more like a memory of a song. The melodies and music are there, but all of it blends together in a cacophony of noise and reverb to feel like somethinng completely different from traditional sounds. Confused? Don’t worry, we’ll get to the 7 Qualities and Characteristics of Classic Shoegaze later, but for now, let’s talk history.\n\nWhere does the term come from?\n\nBands such as My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Lush and The Jesus and Mary Chain led the charge, all while never moving an inch. Their dreamy, misty enveloping sounds kickstarted the genre we now call “Shoegaze,” although “Dream Pop” is another name that means the same thing. The term “Shoegaze” originally came from an insult by critics on the artists who played the genre, while “Dream Pop” referred to the bands’ propensities towards the blended, vague and dreamy style musically. Shoegaze as a term specifically referred to\n\n“[various] bands’ motionless performing styles, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor while they played.”\n\naccording to AllMusic’s overview of Shoegaze. The focus on effects pedals and instrumentation is what was important here, not the visuals of performance. Jude Rogers quotes Ride’s lead singer in his article about resurging interest in Shoegaze around 2007, saying\n\n“‘We didn’t want to use the stage as a platform for ego, like the big bands of the time did, like U2 and Simple Minds,’ says Mark Gardener, then Ride’s lead singer.”\n\nMark is referring to the other bands of the time that were big and in the spotlight, not other Shoegaze bands. It was never about show. Rather, it was about introspection and personability, about\n\n“present[ing] ourselves as normal people, as a band who wanted their fans to think they could do that too.”\n\n-Ride’s then lead-singer.\n\nInfluences, History, Development\n\nInfluences included artists like Cocteau Twins, Dinosaur Jr and Sonic Youth, all which included elements of Shoegaze and had certain songs that would line up well with the genre, though they wouldn’t have been considered Shoegaze or Dream Pop at their times since the term had not been invented yet. The thing that sets Shoegaze specifically apart from these bands and artists like them is that hazy, dreamy quality. Shoegaze’s post-punk influences and 80s pedal effectors combined with the sociopolitical constructive idealism of political involvement resulted in the mood and sound the genre carries. In a 1991 article by The New York Times, Simon Reynolds expressed that\n\n“Struggling independent bands used to live off unemployment benefits [in the UK], but during the 80s, the Government waged a war of attrition against this bohemian “dole culture” and pressured claimants into joining Government-sponsored job training programs.”\n\nTo the rebellious, punk-influenced artist, that leads to trivial, mundane expression, and the music during those early years in the 90s showed the discourse. A desire for more led to the atmospheric, dreamy qualities of Shoegaze.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine during the rcording of their 1991 album: “Loveless”\n\nAs a side note, personally, that is why I love the genre. It recognizes the monotony of mundane desk-job culture and dreams to escape it. It believes in a reality more filled with emotion and not so dictated by common formalities and structured systems. Also, it embodies the emotions inside and creates a wall of sound that is overwhelming, never ending, droning and expressing both a state of positivity and pessimism. The recognition of both is the important note there. It recognizes, processes and emulates the good and the bad. It is forever lost in nostalgia and evokes those personal moments into your mind. Jude Rogers puts it best, saying,\n\n“[Shoegaze was] the sound of jangly indie fed through layers of distortion, overdrive and fuzz; of delicate souls turning themselves up to 11.”\n\nShoegaze is easy to pick out and hear, but defining it’s specific musical qualities to others seems to be a challenge for most people I encounter, so let’s take a look at the characteristics that make up the genre and define exactly what makes Shoegaze so dreamy!\n\nThe 7 Qualities and Characteristics of Classic Shoegaze:\n\nGuitars — A STAPLE of the genre is guitars. It wouldn’t be Shoegaze without these.\n\nEffects Pedals — This would specifically refer to using effects like Distortion, Reverb, Echo, Reverse, Tremolo and possibly Chorus. Although today, with advanced DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) and programs of their caliber, anyone can create the same effects without needing effects pedals.\n\nEnveloped, Soft Voices — Often, songs in Shoegaze include soft, murmured voices that get consumed and merged within a forming Wall of Noise. That leads us to our next quality!\n\nBlended, Blurred Wall of Noise — Usually a result of combinations of the above characteristics, an overwhelming wall of noise is created from all the effects and sound coming from the guitars, effects and voices. This is one of the signature characteristics of the genre.\n\nDroning Melodies — Par of what creates this wall of noise and adds to it is the melody or constant droning chords overlaid by the effects.\n\nMajor 7th Chords — As far as technical notes are concerned, Major 7th Chords leave the listener feeling unresolved. They leave things open, able to continue or change and progress. This leads into the final characteristic.\n\nNostalgic, Rebellious and/or Melancholic Emotions and Lyrics — If the overall feeling of a song you are listening to leaves you feeling nostalgic, (or perhaps melancholic?) or perhaps it depicts an emotion of reminiscence, it likely has at least one of the above elements of Shoegaze, whether the genre of the song is or isn’t that.\n\nThe characteristics vary, and they become more ambiguous as you start to describe what Shoegaze means. In researching this topic, learning the history of the genre and hearing the differences within multiple songs, I’ve come to realize Shoegaze is a spectrum. The more of those 7 qualities you include into a song, the more it will reflect the classic sound of Shoegaze. The further away from these 7 qualities you stray, the less it will sound like classic Shoegaze.\n\nRachel Ann Goswell (vocalist and guitarist) and Neil Halstead (singer, primary lyricist, and guitarist) from Slowdive.\n\nI have come to the understanding that although the terms Shoegaze and Dream Pop were originally referring to the same exact thing, they now mean something slightly different in modern Shoegaze. Often, when I talk to people about the genre, I tend to use “Shoegaze” to refer to the more hazy and distorted sound of guitars while “Dream Pop” seems to be attributed to the more bloopy, tremolo-based sounds.\n\nYou might be wondering, “what happened to Shoegaze in the first place? Why haven’t I heard of it before?”\n\nShoegaze had a significant run in the UK, but it didn’t make it in the US. You may have heard of My Bloody Valentine, but what about bands such as Swervedriver or Slowdive? How about Moose? Pale Saints? The genre was lost to obscurity, almost poetically when you consider the idea of Shoegazing songs reminiscing more as a memory of a song rather than being one outright.\n\nBut why? The answer is quite simple.\n\nGrunge\n\nGrunge found its way into popular culture during the 90s, and so the Shoegazing lasted a little under a decade. While Shoegaze was wildly popular in the UK for its ideals and sociopolitical context, it did not fit exactly with the ever-changing political climate of the United States. Remember the aforementioned Dinosaur Jr and Sonic Youth bands? Their influences into the coming decade rippled not only into Shoegaze, but also into Grunge. For that reason, the two genres are two sides of the same coin. The major difference between the two genres is their delivery. Both are rebellious; actions taken against the political climate of the times, and both delve into introspection and introversion, the small moments, but one is based on the memory and one is based on the now.\n\nSo is that it? Is this the end of Shoegaze as it, like so many other aspects of humanity, is lost to the abyss of obscurity and music nerds? Not quite. There is one more point in this story of Shoegaze, one last string to tie up.\n\nModern Shoegazing: Nu-gaze\n\nMany things in life recycle when the time is right. Shoegaze is no different. This is why “Nu-gaze” formed. Jude Rogers describes this in his 2007 article, “Diamond gazers,” as a sort of resurgence of the overdriven, overlapping distorted noise brought to us by the Shoegaze of old, to put it in my own words. Nu-gaze, in turn, is where Shoegaze evolved into what you hear today. Artists like Snail Mail, Eerie Summer, Soccer Mommy, The Horrors and Mac DeMarco all fuel into this continuing revival, which technically started in the late 2000s/early 2010s.\n\nEerie Summer’s profile picture on Bandcamp.com, a popular platform for indie artists.\n\nWhat I have noticed is that most Nu-gaze music leans more into the bloopy Dream Pop range, but every once in a while, they go back to the Shoegaze roots. What I don’t know is if Nu-gaze has any of the same culture as “The Scene That Celebrates Itself,” yet another term used to describe Shoegazing groups. Julian Cope expresses why this name came about for Shoegazing in his 2007 review of Slowdive’s album, Souvlaki:\n\n“THE SCENE THAT CELEBRATES ITSELF…That was a media term that really focused on the fact these bands tended to be seen together and often seemed to be getting wasted in each other’s presence…round up the usual suspects? : pre-Popscene Blur, The Boo Radleys, Catherine Wheel, Chapterhouse, Curve, Lush, Moose, Pale Saints, Revolver, Ride, our heroes for today Slowdive, Swervedriver, and Thousand Yard Stare.”\n\nClosure\n\nUltimately, Shoegazers are introspective, reminiscent dreamers looking to express this through the music and sounds of the genre. Whether it’s emotionally frustrated, blissfully unaware, dangerously optimistic or simply nostalgic, the sound and messages are often things we can all relate to and also define conflicting, complex emotions. Understanding that, take one last look at this quote as we wrap things up.\n\n“We presented ourselves as normal people, as a band who wanted their fans to think they could do that too.”\n\n- Mark Gardener\n\nWant to listen to some Shoegaze and give it a try?
