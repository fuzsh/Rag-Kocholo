Originally from New Braunfels, Texas, Offerman grew up on a horse ranch. Home schooled by her father in the tack room of their barn, she gravitated towards music at a young age. Offerman started playing piano at the age of four which eventually led her to pursue other instruments such as violin, accordion and more. When she was 11, Offerman's accordion teacher asked her to join their polka band where they traveled across Texas performing. Offerman graduated from Berklee College of Music at the age of 19 and signed her publishing deal with Universal Music Group Publishing about five years later. Offerman was featured in The Highwomen's \"Redesigning Women\" video, inked her record deal with Universal Music Group in 2020. She was named Pandora's Ones to Watch for 2023, included in CMT's \"Next Up\" class of 2023 as well as being named CMT Next Women of Country. Offerman has spent most of 2023 on the road touring with Parker McCollum, Ian Munsick and Tyler Hubbard. She's performed at C2C Festival in London as well as dates with George Strait. In 2024 she heads back out on the road with labelmate Parker McCollum on his \"Burn It Down\" tour. For more information go to www.catieofferman.com."
