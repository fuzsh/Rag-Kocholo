        "text": "It’s not the funniest joke in the world – the one where you die laughing – yet here is a jester that is no joke, but his band is. Kyle Jester & the Jokers will play some old school blues Friday night at the Hong Kong Inn in Ventura, but will Batman make a cameo to see more jokers than he’s ever seen?\n\nThat’s a heavy question for another time in a more meaningful place.\n\nWell, here’s what we know: Jester is from San Diego, but now lives in the Bay Area. So, chances are excellent that he’s no Dodgers fan. He plays his brand of the blues up and down the West Coast on guitar and fronting those jokers.\n\nJester survived five years with Candye Kane, and played with Earl Thomas and Thomas Yearsley of the Paladins, as well as Hot Roux from Ventura, the West Coast Playboys and Billy Watson, who is playing the same venue a week later. While playing the blues, Jester did something few other blues players have ever done, and it’s a sure cure for the blues. He put his wife through medical school. When’s the last time you saw a doctor with a tip jar?\n\nJester doesn’t have to hustle as hard as he used to anymore. Now he can just have fun. And he can supply witty answers to an email interview since the phone company gave others the blues by not working.\n\nHow's the blues business? What's the latest with you?\n\nThe blues business is rough. It's harder than ever to get folks to leave their homes, and as more and more clubs close down, the ones left have to filter through more and more musicians/bands soliciting to play their venue. And all this while the venues work on thinner and thinner margins, leaving many without the booking agents and promoters they afforded in years past. The result is that there's fewer venues, fewer fans, and it's harder and harder to communicate with venue owners and managers, even when you have an established line. I'm pretty confident that we're watching the blues genre die in front of us, literally and figuratively.\n\nYou play with a zillion band. Is that what it takes to remain a working musician these days?\n\nPlaying as a sideman allows for minimum stress, so I'll always take gigs with other bands that I respect. On top of that, I like seeing other frontmen at work and learning their songs. That keeps it fresh. I'm honestly not sure how career musicians are making it right now. I do plenty of gigs where I can't pay myself and all the pay goes to the band, and I take the tips and CD money.\n\nWhy blues and not punk rock, polka, folk rock or something else?\n\nI heard the honesty in blues music pretty early — age 15 or so. All my buddies were into Primus and Nirvana, and I was into Wolf and Muddy and BB. I had a \"Live at Newport\" compilation on tape that really brought me in, had BB doing the best live version of 'Outside Help' I've heard to this day, plus Big Mama Thornton and Eddie Cleanhead — that cassette really brought me in.\n\nWhat's you brand of the blues?\n\nI absolutely love traditional blues from the women of the '20s, the Delta/Piedmont stuff, pre-war Chicago, all the way through Texas into the '70s. Anything after the 1970s, I am far more discerning with, as I'm not a fan of rock blues. It never hit me at the depth that honest, simple earlier stuff did. So now when I hear a blues station on satellite radio, I really only dig about 10-20 percent of it. Lots of new blues music is simply rock music, and for me, misses the mark.\n\nAll that said, for current artists, I love hearing James Hunter, Ben Hernandez (Malachi Henri & the Lights), Rusty Zinn (both his blues and reggae albums are great), and Alvin Youngblood Hart (as well as his South Memphis String Band). My tastes are moving from electric stinging blues to acoustic roots music a bit.\n\nHow did you get to be the guitar player? Was that always your instrument of choice?\n\nI got a guitar at age 14 and learned all kinds of songs by the Cure and Squeeze (Hey, it took a year to figure it out.), Within a year, I was alienating myself into music.\n\nThere's a line on your web bio that I found prophetic: 'I took a break from music to support my wife.' How many musicians actually make a living playing music?\n\nLess and less. I like to point out the band California Honeydrops for bypassing the \"blues scene\" for the most part while still playing mostly blues and jazz. They've done great and they deserve it, in my view. The blues genre is no longer a path to touring level unless you are already established. I am super lucky that my wife of 12 years decided to go into medicine early on in our marriage and I have the choice to not hustle as much as some.\n\nWhat was your big break or have you had it yet?\n\nWhen I was 24, I told myself that I'd play until my birthday in December and if I wasn't \"making it\" I would start community college or something. It was about two days before my birthday that Candye called inviting me to be her guitar player, duet vocalist and band leader. I'd say that was my break. Looking back, I'm not sure I deserved that spot. But I had been playing in a three-piece band with her husband, Thomas Yearsley from the Paladins (he was out of the Paladins trying to make the marriage work) and she wanted to pare down to a three-piece with her in front.\n\nTell me a Candye Kane story.\n\nPlaying with Candye was eye-opening in many ways. We toured Europe and the United States three to four times a year each, and this was before she got sick and had a bit of an epiphany. When I played with her, she was known as hard to work with and she went through band members quite a bit. Because of this, I don't have many respectful stories to share, so I'll leave it there, Why does my brain remember negative memories so well!?\n\nWhat's the strangest gig you've ever played?\n\nThe strangest gig was probably a tiny barn in Germany on a small hill with absolutely nothing around for miles and miles except rolling hills. No towns, no structures, but a couple in the distance. We wondered if it was the wrong place, or if the show was canceled as there was simply nobody around. Well, we set up in this barn that looked like it was still used as a proper barn and then we took off to the hotel to shower and eat. Driving back out, we see what looks like a mini Woodstock, half people and half cars. Some drove eight hours to get there. That was a happy strange one, whereas the grand opening of a Vons grocery store in Encinitas, California, was strange in a completely different way.\n\nWho's the drunkest person you've ever seen (that wasn't you)?\n\nWhen I first started playing, I had a gig with a harmonica player who did a weekly jam in Bonsall, California. The bass player he used would get so drunk during this Sunday afternoon show that he regularly knocked amps and drum stands over. Sometimes he'd be swaying to the music a bit, and then just sway too hard and go over my amp. We learned just to bring crappy equipment and go with it as it wasn't going to change on his end anytime soon.\n\nWho goes to a Kyle Jester gig? Do they dance or stare or drink to excess?\n\nI seem to attract music lovers and dancers more than drinkers. My show is a vocal show as much as a guitar show, and I pull from obscure sources, so I don't sound like the radio. I play as quiet as possible when I can, too, so the rocker crowd might not get what they want for the entire night. But I'll also attempt to channel some Paladins or Red Devils here and there. As I like to say, high energy, low volume.\n\nIf you could have a dream gig with anybody, who would that be with?\n\nWhen I'm home, I listen to a mix of mellow newer music and greasy roots music. And as a singer and guitar player, I like different things for many different reasons. As much as it would be cool to play with Lazy Lester or Otis Rush or someone of that caliber, for me it probably would be Gillian Welch, the Americana artist. I love her and David Rawlings. And after thinking on this question for a few minutes, the answer may have surprised me as much as anyone.\n\nWhy do you have to do this?\n\nI have to sing. I'm not sure if non-singers/non-musicians understand, but when I sing, I'm pretty much going in front of people and screaming whatever words I want at the top of my lungs. When simplified like this, you might be able to understand how it can be so therapeutic. I'll attract more cops yelling at people on the street. I predict that I'll be down on the corner of my hometown busking when all the venues have closed and gone.\n\nGETTING THERE:\n\nKyle Jester & the Jokers at the Hong Kong Inn, 435E. Thompson Blvd., Ventura, Friday, 8 p.m.\n\nCOST: $10\n\nINFO: 816-9663\n\nIf I had a faster car, a richer girlfriend or even one with a job, here’s where I’d be lurking in the back this week:"
