        "text": "Whether you just learned youâre pregnant or your little oneâs arrival is around the corner, youâre probably curious about baby names. Some of the most powerful and unique baby boy names are the short ones, offering beautiful meanings and snappy sounds. For a little inspiration, weâve included 250 short boy names ranging from popular and simple monikers to unique and international options.\n\nPopular Short Boy Names\n\nShort boy names seem to be trendy these days, with many mini monikers dominating the list of the most popular names in the United States in recent years. Even some short international baby names are trending, such as Liam and Luca, so you have plenty of options.\n\n1. Liam. As the Irish short form of William, Liam is the most popular boy name in recent years. Itâs a great choice if you like a classic name but want to put a fun and short spin on it.\n\n2. Noah. The second-most popular short name for boys is Noah, a Hebrew moniker that means ârest, repose.â It started gaining popularity in the 1970s and took off in the 1990s.\n\n3. Jack. Cute, short, and sweet, Jack is one of those classic names that never go out of style. Though itâs a diminutive of John (meaning âYahweh is graciousâ), you can also link Jack to the French boysâ name Jacques, meaning âmay God protect.â\n\n4. Levi. As a Hebrew name, Levi means âjoined, attached,â which is a very cute meaning for your little boy, who will surely be attached to you!\n\n5. Owen. Owen is originally a Welsh name that connects to the Latin moniker Eugenius (a.k.a. Eugene). Itâs the perfect short baby boy name as it means âwell-born.â\n\n6. John. A true classic, John is a name that's been around for centuries and still makes it in the top 10. Itâs a Hebrew name that means âYahweh is graciousâ in reference to the Hebrew god.\n\n7. Leo. Leo was originally a gender-neutral name popular at the turn of the century. It made a comeback 100 years later and started rising in popularity again in the early 2000s. It derives from a Greek word meaning âlion.â 8. Luke. As the English form of the Latin name Lucas, Luke means âfrom Lucania,â a historical region in Southern Italy. Itâs been one of the more popular short guy names since the 1970s.\n\n9. Ezra. The Hebrew and biblical name Ezra has been around for a long time, but it wasnât until the 2010s that it really started to make waves. Though itâs always been a short name for boys, it became a gender-neutral name in 2018.\n\n10. Luca. If you like the short baby boy name Luke but prefer an international twist, consider cute Luca. This is the Romanian and Italian form of Lucas, so it also means âfrom Lucania.â Interestingly, the name Luca is starting to lose popularity in Italy but is one of the trendiest names in the United States.\n\nShort Unique Boy Names\n\nUnique baby names offer your little one a bit of individuality to help them stand out from the crowd. There are plenty of short unique boy names you could choose from that are both rare and cool, such as Shaw or Ever.\n\n11. Alva. You might not know anyone with the name Alva, as it dropped off the records in the 1960s. It used to be quite a popular name for both girls and boys and was the middle name of Thomas Edison. Itâs a variant of Alvah, which means âhis highnessâ in Hebrew.\n\n12. Cree. Cree is rare as a given moniker, as it comes from an indigenous tribe of the same name spanning the borders of Canada and the United States. Itâs a unisex name and a great option for short boy names.\n\n13. Ever. This might top our list of unique short boy names, as itâs very rare. Itâs an English name that simply comes from the word ever, though derived from the Old English word Ã¦fre.\n\n14. Hayes. If you like the idea of last names as given names, you might consider Hayes. Former president Rutherford B. Hayes bore this name, and it comes from an Old English word meaning âfence, enclosure.â\n\n15. Lorn. Lorn is a short and unique boy name that had a brief moment of popularity in the United States in the 1960s. It comes from the Scottish place name Lorne, and because it was the title of the first governor-general of Canada, itâs been a common given name in Canada for quite some time.\n\n16. Nash. Despite rising in popularity in recent years, Nash is still a unique name. It comes from the Middle English phrase atten ash, meaning âat the ash tree.â If youâre a fan of the folk-rock band Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, you might like this option!\n\n17. Rian. The name Ryan is definitely a common and classic short name for boys, but Rianâthe Irish form of the nameâis unique, only used in the United States since the late 1970s. So, if you're hunting for a classic name with a rare twist, try Rian or even RÃ­an.\n\n18. Shaw. As an English and Scottish surname, Shaw has two options when it comes to meaning. It either derives from the Old English word sceaga meaning âthicketâ or the Gaelic name Sitheach meaning âwolf.â\n\n19. Vere. Both a Norman surname and derived from a Gaulish word, Vere means âalder,â as in the tree, so itâs a cute option for a nature baby name.\n\n20. York. If your family has English roots, the short baby boy name York could be a cute option. Itâs the name of a city in northern England derived from words meaning âyew,â âboar,â and âvillage.â\n\nMore Short Unique Boy Names\n\nKeep the uniqueness going with these short unique boy names that will surely make your little one stand out from the crowd:\n\nChoosing a baby name can be fun yet also overwhelming. Watch this video for some exciting facts that could help you find the perfect baby name!\n\nShort and Simple Boy Names\n\nShort baby names seem to be extra cute. These simple boy names are those classic monikers that you probably grew up with, often short forms for traditional titles like Alex for Alexander or Matt for Matthew. Short and snappy, they give a cute yet simple spin to a classic name.\n\n31. Alex. The short form of Alexander, Alex is a common name for guys. As a Greek name, Alexander means âdefending man.â You might recognize the name from Alexander the Great, the king of Macedon in the fourth century BCE.\n\n32. Alan. Common and simple, Alan has been a staple in the United States for a long time, hitting its popularity peak in the 1950s. It comes from the Brittany region of France and means âlittle rockâ or âhandsome.â\n\n33. Ben. You really canât go wrong with the name Ben, which is a common staple in many countries across Europe, plus the United States and Australia. Itâs the short form of Benjamin and Benedict, which mean âson of the right handâ and âblessed,â respectively.\n\n34. Kyle. Popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kyle is an excellent short boy name for those wanting something simple yet cool. It comes from several Scottish place names, deriving from the Gaelic word caol, meaning âchannel, strait.â\n\n35. Kurt. You might think that Kurt is short for Curtis, but itâs actually the German form of Conrad, so it means âbrave counsel.â One famous bearer of the name was the late musician Kurt Cobain.\n\n36. Lou. The short baby boy name Lou gives you a little bit of everything: a cute, classic, and timeless moniker. It comes from the French name Louis, which connects to the German moniker Ludwig, meaning âfamous battle.â\n\n37. Matt. Though a short and simple boy name, Matt has a significant meaning. As the short form of Matthew, it derives from a Hebrew name meaning âgift of Yahweh,â referring to the Hebrew god.\n\n38. Ryan. As mentioned above with short unique boy names, Ryan is quite a common moniker. Though the Irish version Rian offers a bit of rarity, Ryan is still an Irish name on its own and means âlittle king.â\n\n39. Tony. If youâre looking for a simple boy name with a lot of meaning, consider Tony, the short form of Anthony, which derives from the Roman family name Antonius. You might recall the Roman emperor Mark Anthony, also known for his relationship with Cleopatra.\n\n40. Zack. For a bit of nostalgia, consider the name Zack, a popular 1990s sitcom name thanks to Zack Morris from the series Saved by the Bell. Zack is the short form of Zachary, which connects to the Hebrew name Zekharyah, meaning âYahweh remembers.â\n\nMore Short and Simple Boy Names\n\nA simple name never goes out of style, and there are plenty of common and appealing short names for boys out there. Here are a few more for you to consider:\n\nClassic Short Names for Boys\n\nOld-fashioned boy names only get cuter as they get shorter!
