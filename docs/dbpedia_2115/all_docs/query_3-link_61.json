        "text": "Do you have a regimen for writing?\n\nNot having too much ambition is my highest priority because I find that my favorite part of writing songs is the actual writing of a new song. And ambition thwarts that, seemingly. When Iâm rhyming words and figuring something out start to finish is when Iâm at my happiest, creatively. Iâm always ambitious within the song, but Iâve found that when other things get involvedâseeking credit or recognition for what Iâm doingâit can really befuddle my creative juices. It sounds hokey perhaps, but itâs a matter of purity. The dumber and more in my bubble I stay, the better it all turns out.\n\nMost of the things that have happened commercially for me have been because someone else finds me; itâs not because Iâm pitching, âThis would be a good song for thatâ. So I realized that the greatest thing I can do is just stay in tune, as far as being able to continue writing songs, because who knows? Theyâre useful in and of themselves.\n\nDo you find yourself consciously having to work against that instinct of ambition or chasing money?\n\nWell, thereâs a Jekyll-and-Hydeness. As much as I just described the monk character, thereâs also a coyote character that can come out from playing live music for 30 years on the night of a gig, and be like, âNo, Iâm taking the money.â Or, âI have seniority. Youâre 21 years old, you asked us way out here to play this show, and eight people cameâweâre taking the 76 dollars.â So thereâs a pirate ethos there, too, that is brutal. And thatâs not the same human that writes the songs, as far as I can tell. Thatâs the survivalist. Sometimes you have to take life into your own hands in those situations. But thatâs the least fun part, worrying about money.\n\nAnd Iâve done the opposite, where there was a gig where someone was lazily collecting donations, but not enforcing it. I spent four hours there, I was the fourth of four acts, and 15 years older than anyone else. Those are the times when you realize what a rodeo clown your life has really led you to beâwhere youâre like, âI must really love playing music.â At the end of that night, the person who is mildly suggesting that people put a dollar in the pot told me, âWell, we only made $55, and to split it betweenâ¦â I kind of cut them off and was like, âItâs fine, I donât need any.â So, there are abstract expressionist principles that vary, chameleon-like, depending on the weather and the mood of the protagonist.\n\nBut I see that as part of the art, too. Because thereâs no management, thereâs no one telling one what to do when youâre in this self-run ship.\n\nI was thinking about singles, and how much of a band or artistâs setlist can be dictated by maybe their record label. I can make a record and only play two songs [from it], and move on quickly. Then when people buy the record, theyâre like, âWhat are all these other songs?â Which, to me, is a good thing because itâs like opening a box and you donât know whatâs in it.\n\nSome people donât want to play songs live that arenât recorded yet because itâs confusing for people. I personally love to see one of my favorite artists play a song that I donât know. During the song, Iâm having the experience ofââIs this a cover song? Did they write this? Could they have written this?â And then finding out itâs a new original song. Itâs like seeing live art or live athletics.\n\nI value the freedom to be able to play whatever the hell I want very, very much. And I think thatâs a huge ingredient to having no resentment of wanting songs to flow and keep coming.\n\nThereâs a lot of people canceling tours these days, and an ongoing conversation about how itâs becoming less viable to make a living as an artist. Does your faith in an arts career ever get shaken? Have you ever had to have a so-called âregular jobâ at the same time?\n\nIâve had jobs, maybe not that regular in a while. I actually like having a little bit of part-time work, so that Iâm not mistaking myself for some kind of rock royalty. I donât want to be that MTV Cribs person sitting around in fancy sweatpants like âI really made it,â while theyâre Venmoing their gardener to do all their dirty work. Thatâs disgusting to me. Thatâs what not to become.\n\nI am a scavenger by trade, anyway. I picked up four brand-new bungee cords that still had the tags on them off of the highway the other day, and used them to tarp my old truck that has a rust issue. I consider that a successful life.\n\nLiving off the fat of a land that is at times so affluent and so waste-producing; itâs kind of easy to get by, if you donât measure success by the same definition that everyone else does. We laugh when we go to the 50%-off stand at the grocery store, and are eating cookies from Christmas a month and a half later. To me, thatâs fun. Thatâs a joy.\n\nWhat does success look like for you when making a record or a piece of art?\n\nWhen a friend who has known me for years writes to me, when Iâve sent them one of my records, and tells me what they thought of it. That they listened to it is a success. That after 20 years, theyâll still be like, âI wonder what this is going to be.â And if they like it, or if they still find what Iâm doing interestingâto me, thatâs fantastic.\n\nIt might be a treat to experience a positive record review, but that would probably last a day or so. And thatâs fine; thatâs not why Iâm doing it. Iâm doing it to roll the boulder of it all forward, and I know Iâve succeeded if the songs keep coming, because itâs all building off of each other. All the songs are building off of the other songs, and itâs kind of this ongoing tale.\n\nDo you ever feel like youâve made something, finished it, and failed?\n\nBecause I also make visual art, I know how hit-or-miss pictures can be. Itâs kind of an amateurâs perspective to say, âI made a bad picture, Iâm a bad artist.â Each oneâs special, like how people compare their songs to children; you could never pick a favorite. The duds kind of provide the background for the standout songs. Sometimes the standout songs are a little too pretty, and that can be boring. I like something thatâs clunky and misshapen just as much. Iâm happy even to make a bad song. Thereâs something there, and sometimes I just have to listen to it several times to know what was actually going on to appreciate it. I believe in being an observer or a witness to your own stuff, and some of them are going to be less understood than others.\n\nYour style of writing varies record-to-record. For example, the writing on Explains is very unique to that record. I know you like Lil Wayne, and thatâs kind of a Wayne-esque record, right?\n\nYes, for sure.\n\nAre you consciously setting up exercises or rules for how you write something?\n\nI canât really tell. Iâm just re-approaching it as new as possible every time. Things that Iâm listening to end up making their way into songs, and sometimes I wonât realize it until later. I like that the songs can kind of be a net for what Iâm into in other peopleâs music.\n\nWith Lil Wayne, I was trying to think about what would be my equivalent, in a sense ofââWell, I canât talk about Fendi or my Gucci sneakers or whatever. What would mine be? Oh, Iâm such a dork; mine would be my favorite candy. Alright, Iâm going to say that.â And it feels good to say that because it feels like me.\n\nSo Iâm always putting my own spin on it, and putting myself in there, and by doing that, songs feel cathartic. Youâre kind of saying, âLook at me,â but hopefully not just showing something thatâs obvious. Hopefully someone can learn something new about this person theyâre listening to, and thereâs something connective about that sharing.\n\nThereâs a fine line between stage fright and, âEveryoneâs looking at me, and Iâm fine with that.â Early on, I learned to embarrass myself before someone else could embarrass me. I think a lot of where Iâm coming from is a sense of showing vulnerability, or displaying how uncool I am.\n\nEarlier you said something about keeping yourself dumb. I think it does take courage to play the fool.\n\nMy card is The Fool, in The Birthday Book. My friend sent me screenshots of my date this past birthday; I was like, âThat makes so much sense.â\n\nIâm kind of obsessed with the Fool archetype. This person whoâand Iâm not saying this is youâis all alone, and making observations that are often nonsensical, sometimes profound, and is outside of things enough to offer a lens on whatâs happening.\n\nHey! I resemble that remark!\n\nWhen writing, is there a goal of getting to an idea, or are you just following your pen?\n\nI like to start with an album title, and one usually firms up once I find some sort of trend or color or anything. Once I put an album title over top in quotes, I can usually have at least four songs already that Iâm like, âYeah, this would be on this album.â And there might be four other songs that Iâm putting to the left or to the right for a different record.\n\nIâm the most productive when Iâm working on a few ideas or a few records simultaneously. Thatâs when I feel best because then I can have two different moods that Iâm working on. A lot of times, itâs almost a novelty record and the more âauthentic selfâ record being written simultaneously. Sometimes Iâll record the novelty record first to get over the fear of the proverbial diving board and be like, âSee, you still know how to make a record,â and then Iâll make the real one that is less whimsical. Like Be Gulls.\n\nBe Gulls was a side thing, but it became too confusing. I just make Be Gulls t-shirts now, and mostly donât make Little Wings t-shirts. Itâs kind of the stunt-double band name for Little Wings. Itâs this complicated camouflage mythology that is to stay unknown as long as possible, which is where I feel like I thrive the most.\n\nIâve experienced becoming locally well-known in a neighborhood that I lived in once upon a time, and I watched my writing freeze and dry up. If someoneâs waving to me on the street, and Iâve made a big enough fool of myself close enough to where I live that people on a day-to-day basis know that I was that guy up on stage singing, it kind of ruins my practice, and I have to move to another town. Iâve done that before. It froze up and it scared me, and I thought it was gone. Then I learned the lesson that, for me, maintaining a certain level of anonymity is power.\n\nEver heard of this character Superman? I have to mostly live my life in the Clark Kent character, and then, in a David Blaine way, mysteriously appear and play these songs, andââHow did he remember all those words?â And, âWhat!? Did he just talk about a diaper with artificial excrement in it?â And then, âWhere did he go?â âI donât know, but his weird friend was selling merch, and I bought this t-shirt that is not his band name.â Itâs all obfuscation. Thatâs whatâs interesting and exciting to me.\n\nSo Be Gulls is kind of a third skin on top of Little Wings to keep Kyle Field safe?\n\nAnd Iâve already shed it. It originated on a Little Wings album called Grow. We had a skit called âThe Be Gullsâ; they were Central Coastâs greatest band. It was kind of Spinal Tap-esque, in our more Hobbit, Shire way.\n\nThen I was like, âLetâs make an actual Be Gulls record to expand the mythology.â It didnât sound that different from a Little Wings record. Itâs a little worse than a Little Wings record. Which is good. The Be Gulls should not be better than Little Wings, certainly. [laughs]\n\nGrow is a very trippy record.\n\nYes. I didnât really know how to use the four-track, which I think is to its benefit. I had the mic just way too hot all the time. When I was singing, the hiss would go away, but then when thereâs less sound, the hiss is almost like a character on the record.\n\nI was talking to my friend Greg Olin about that record recently. He was like, âYou could never do that again. You could never achieve that sense of lostness; you know too much now.â Iâm still pretty bad at recording. Itâs interesting. Iâve been recording on a similar machine in my back room, and I get some funny results. Iâm trying not to get very good at all.\n\nDo you think thereâs value in keeping limitations, and avoiding becoming an expert?\n\nYes. I can go get perfection. I can pay for perfection. If I want to record some songs, I can go to a, quote, real studio. Thatâs kind of like buying a couch. Everyone knows what theyâre doing, thereâs going to be no mistakes. That sterility is sometimes not that fun after youâve experienced the things that can happen to a song when something goes slightly wrong. All of those things are really exciting to me. Itâs like its own character.\n\nYou employ characters in your songs a fair bit, like Scuby and Mr. Natural. Do you design characters from scratch, or are you putting a different name on someone who already exists?\n\nI donât really feel the need to create a new story or narrative per se. For me, itâs more cathartic to disguise something that really happened, and leave the listener wondering who itâs really about. Iâve heard other songwriters say, âMy songs are not based in reality; this is not about me, this is not about anyone else, this is an invented thing.â And Iâm always like, âThatâs too bad. Because when I thought you were too insecure to actually say it straightforwardly, and that you were using your powers of creativity to turn it into a myth and put a different name on it, I understood what you meant. I could relate.â\n\nI know who Scuby is. Everyone knows who Scuby is, in a way. I see it as this romantic, hopefully universal language or tale that resonates and canât completely be described. Thatâs why you can get lost in it. Thatâs why itâs a pleasurable escape, and a theme song for your own life. Thatâs how I use songs.\n\nWeâve talked a lot about obfuscation, but it seems important to you that there is connection and relating.\n\nI think so. And, I think the fool is also the trickster. If Iâm smiling with my eyes, but saying something menacing or dark, itâs interesting, and it has your attention. Weâre complex creatures; so a song-and-dance-person in this day and age should reflect that."
