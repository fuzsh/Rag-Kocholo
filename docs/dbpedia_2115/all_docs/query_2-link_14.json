        "text": "Printed inside his yearbook directly below his senior portrait are Kyle Harvey's parting words to the class of 2011 at Ventura High School in California: \"See You When I am Famous!!!!!!!!!!!!\" And his foresight could not have been clearer.\n\nNow known mononymously as KYLE, the chart-topping, multi-platinum rapper's sophomore studio album, See You When I am Famous!!!!!!!!!!!! is appropriately named in honor of his high school year book quote. Earlier this year, KYLE tapped Rich The Kid & K Camp for, \"YES!,\" the explosive first single from his forthcoming LP, which the New York Times noted that, \"KYLE is perhaps the only rapper working who could pull these choices off — he's chipper, melodic, soft-touch and a little wry…\" KYLE followed \"YES!\" with the R&B-laced single, \"What It Is,\" released on his 27th birthday, the Hit Boy-produced \"Bouncin\" and the breezy \"momma I made it\" anthem \"Money Now,\" featuring Tyga and Johnny Yukon, all released ahead of the album's debut.\n\nThe Ventura, CA native skyrocketed to stardom with the 8X RIAA platinum-certified breakout single \"iSpy\" featuring Lil Yachty, which to date, has amassed over 2 billion streams and 500 million video views. The infectious song earned KYLE an MTV VMA nomination, a #1 spot on Billboard's Rap Songs chart, while peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. KYLE's now platinum-certified debut album LIGHT OF MINE was released on his 25th birthday in May 2017 and featured special collaborations with the likes of 2 Chainz, Alessia Cara, Khalid and longtime friend and collaborator Kehlani, who appears on the platinum-certified, song of summer \"Playinwitme.\" KYLE celebrated the release of LIGHT OF MINE with a main stage performance at Coachella before making his acting debut, starring in the Netflix hip-hop comedy The After Party.\n\nIn 2019, KYLE surprised fans with a deluxe edition of his debut collection, which included his second RIAA-certified collaboration with Lil Yachty, \"Hey Julie,\" as well as the standout tracks \"F You I Love You (feat. Teyana Taylor),\" \"SUPERDUPERKYLE (feat. MadeinTYO)\" and \"Moment (feat. Wiz Khalifa).\"\n\nRapidly becoming a seasoned actor, KYLE followed his acting debut with a widely popular stint hosting the first season of Fuse's animated hip-hop series, Sugar and Toys. The series was recently picked up for a second season and will see KYLE reprising his role as host. KYLE will also return to the big screen, in the upcoming crime-drama movie, Cherry, directed by The Russo Brothers (MARVEL Franchise) and starring Tom Holland (Spider-Man).\n\nHaving rapidly become a seasoned actor, KYLE followed his acting debut with a widely popular stint hosting the first season of Fuse's animated hip-hop series, Sugar and Toys. The show, known for its unique blend of humor, animation, and hip-hop culture, resonated strongly with audiences, earning widespread popularity and was renewed for a second season with KYLE reprsing his role as host. KYLE also made a noteworthy return to the big screen with a role in the crime-drama movie \"Cherry.\" Directed by The Russo Brothers, renowned for their work in the MARVEL Franchise and starring Tom Holland (Spider-Man) in the lead role. KYLE's multifaceted talents were on full display, adding an extra layer of anticipation to the project and solidifying his standing as a versatile force in entertainment.\n\nThen starting 2022 as he means to go on, he dropped full length album It's Not So Bad in January. His first-ever self-released LP, it represents the beginning of an exciting new chapter in the story of KYLE, as he begins the transition towards becoming a truly independent artist. Later that year, KYLE released the short film Allie & I, directed by Tomás Whitmore, a captivating exploration of the highs and lows of new romance, skillfully subverting expectations through an abstract lens and delving into the complexities of relationships against the backdrop of social media and influencer culture. This marked a significant milestone in his career, demonstrating his commitment to pushing artistic boundaries and engaging his audience on multiple levels. It served as a visual complement to his musical endeavors, providing fans with a deeper insight into his narrative and creative vision."
