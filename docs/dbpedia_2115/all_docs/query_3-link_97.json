        "text": "Jack Black announced on social media that he’s canceling Tenacious D‘s current tour amid blowback against band partner Kyle Gass, who made a controversial comment at the band’s concert in Australia on July 14 related to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Black presented a cake to Gass on stage to celebrate the latter’s 64th birthday. When Black then asked Gass to make a wish, Gass responded: “Don’t miss Trump next time.”\n\n“I was blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday,” Black wrote in a follow-up statement. “I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form.”\n\n“After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold,” Black added. “I am grateful to the fans for their support and understanding.”\n\nTenacious D was performing at Australia’s ICC Sydney Theatre the day after the assassination attempt on Trump when Gass made his comment, much to Black’s surprise. The comment was not a rehearsed bit. Information on the remaining tour dates and how fans can access refunds will be provided at a later date.\n\nTrump was struck in the ear by a live bullet during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pa. after a gunman opened fire from an elevated position outside the venue, the U.S. Secret Service confirmed. The Secret Service “neutralized” the shooter, who died. One person in the crowd was killed by the gunfire, and two others were critically injured.\n\nIn addition to their current tour, which is now canceled, Tenacious D had also been scheduled to play a series of October concerts to support Rock the Vote, the nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to building the political power of young people."
