        "text": "FCS\n\nNICHOLLS STATE\n\nAT CENTRAL ARKANSAS\n\nWHEN 2:30 p.m.\n\nWHERE Estes Stadium, Conway\n\nRECORDS Central Arkansas, 8-1, 7-0 Southland Conference; Nicholls State, 5-4, 5-2\n\nCOACHES Steve Campbell (21-11 in third season at UCA, 48-19 in fifth overall); Tim Rebowe (8-12 in second season at Nicholls State and overall)\n\nSERIES UCA leads 8-2\n\nLAST MEETING UCA defeated Nicholls State 34-31 in 2015\n\nRADIO KUCA-FM, 91.3, in Conway; KKPT-FM, 94.1, in Little Rock\n\nINTERNET ucasports.com/watch\n\nWHEN UCA HAS THE BALL UCA hopes to run first. Five backs have significantly contributed to the team’s rushing total this season, led by freshman Carlos Blackman and senior Antwon Wells. Blackman has rushed for 497 yards on 111 carries through 9 games and Wells for 422 yards on 96 carries. Wells leads UCA with seven rushing touchdowns. UCA is second in the Southland Conference with an average of 36.8 points a game. UCA is ranked 5th of 11 Southland teams in total passing yards with 2,175, and UCA junior quarterback Hayden Hildebrand is the conference’s second most efficient passer. He has completed 62.0 percent of his passes with 15 touchdowns and 6 interceptions. His top receivers are seniors Desmond Smith (47 receptions, 667 yards, 3 TDs) and Jatavious Wilson (45-680-3). Smith is tied for the Southland lead in receptions.\n\nWHEN NICHOLLS STATE HAS THE BALL Freshman quarterback Chase Fourcade leads the Colonels’ offensive attack. He has passed for 1,887 yards through 9 games with 13 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. He has thrown all but three of the team’s passes this season. Five Nicholls State receivers have caught 16 or more passes this season, led by senior receiver C.J. Bates with 41 for 540 yards and 5 touchdowns. The Colonels also have a multi-faceted rushing attack that includes five running backs who have rushed for at least 147 yards this season, led by senior C.J. Okpalobi with 502 yards and 5 touchdowns and freshman Dontrell Taylor with 248 yards and 3 touchdowns.\n\nWHAT’S AT STAKE UCA is 7-0 in the Southland for the first time since it joined the conference in 2006. … The Bears have a seven-game Southland winning streak, second in the conference to Sam Houston State’s eight-game streak. … Nicholls State, at 5-2 in the Southland, is currently tied for third with Southeastern Louisiana, which hosts Abilene Christian today.\n\nUAPB AT TEXAS SOUTHERN\n\nWHEN 2 p.m. Central\n\nWHERE BBVA Compass Stadium, Houston, Texas\n\nRECORDS UAPB (1-8, 1-6 Southwestern Athletic Conference); Texas Southern (3-6, 3-4)\n\nCOACHES Monte Coleman (18-60 in ninth season at UAPB and overall); Michael Haywood (3-6 in first season at Texas Southern and 13-21 in third season overall)\n\nSERIES Texas Southern leads 24-18-1 LAST MEETING Texas Southern defeated UAPB 24-20 in 2015\n\nRADIO KUAP-FM 89.7, in Pine Bluff\n\nINTERNET uapblionsroar.com\n\nWHEN UAPB HAS THE BALL After scoring 45 points in an overtime victory over Alcorn State in Week 3 and dropping a couple of close games the following two weeks, the Golden Lions have now scored a combined 31 points in their past four games. Until they scored a touchdown early in the third quarter against Mississippi Valley State last week, the Golden Lions had gone scoreless for six quarters. Injuries have UAPB on its third starting center of the season and have caused Coach Monte Coleman to shuffle his offensive line throughout the season. It’s no surprise that the 42 sacks allowed by the Golden Lions are the most in the Football Championship Subdivision. Quarterback Brandon Duncan’s 61.8 percent completion percentage is good for third in the SWAC and 27th in the FCS and his 22.33 completions per game leads the SWAC and is 14th in the FCS.\n\nWHEN TEXAS SOUTHERN HAS THE BALL Texas Southern quarterback Averion Hurts is the older brother of Alabama starting quarterback Jalen Hurts. Averion Hurts is in his second season as the Texas Southern starter after playing two seasons at Kilgore College, a junior college in Kilgore, Texas. Although the Tigers are a respectable 3-4 in the SWAC’s Western Division, their defense is more their calling card. The Tigers are seventh in the 10-team league at 22.3 points per game offensively, but are second in the conference, giving up just 27.4 points on defense.\n\nWHAT’S AT STAKE Thanks to an unequal distribution in the quality of teams, neither the Tigers nor the Golden Lions figure to factor into this season’s conference race. By virtue of residing in the Western Division, the best the Golden Lions or the Tigers can hope for would be to play spoiler. And that will have to come next week. The Golden Lions close out the season hosting Prairie View A&M (6-1 SWAC), while the Tigers play Grambling State (6-0).\n\nDIVISION II\n\nOUACHITA BAPTIST\n\nAT HENDERSON STATE\n\nWHEN 1 p.m. Central\n\nWHERE Carpenter-Haygood Stadium, Arkadelphia\n\nRECORDS Henderson State 8-2, 8-2 GAC; Ouachita Baptist 6-4, 6-4\n\nCOACHES Scott Maxfield (88-42 in 12th season at Henderson State, 116-54 in 16th season overall); Todd Knight (90-91 in 18th season at Ouachita Baptist, 118-123-2 in 24th season overall)\n\nSERIES Henderson State leads 43-40-6 RADIO KHTE-FM, 96.5, in Little Rock; KUOA-AM, 1290, in Siloam Springs; KUOA-FM, 97.7, in Fayetteville/Springdale; KAMD-FM, 97.1, in Camden; KYRC-FM, 93.5, Hot Springs/Bismarck; KNAS-FM, 105.5, in Nashville; KQORFM, 105.3, in Mena; KARN-AM, 920, in Little Rock; KAFN-FM, 93.7 and KAFNAM, 690, in Benton; KWPS-FM, 99.7, in Hot Springs; KYXK-FM, 106.9, in Arakadelphia\n\nINTERNET hsusports.com, obutigers.com\n\nLAST MEETING Henderson State won 21-17 last season\n\nLAST WEEK Ouachita Baptist beat Oklahoma Baptist 51-28; Henderson State beat Southern Nazarene 40-7\n\nCOMMENTS This is the first time since 2009 in which neither team in this game has earned at least a share of a conference title.
