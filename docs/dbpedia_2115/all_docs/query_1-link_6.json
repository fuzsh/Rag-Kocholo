Sometimes the tougher the challenge, the greater the creativity. In my corporate days, I confess I would always argue my budget was never enough. If I had £100 to spend, I’d want £1,000. If I had £1,000 I’d need £10,000. Now, venturing into the world of book writing, I can have any size of marketing budget I want – after all, I’m in charge. But it turns out that I’m quite difficult to get approval from! In a world where paid campaigns dominate, the absence of a budget can initially feel like a setback. Without the luxury of financial resources, I find myself attempting to explore alternative avenues - tapping into the power of so-called organic reach. But who would have though crafting compelling content that resonates with audiences would be so difficult 😉 ? The attention span on social media can be a nano second! Research tells me that ‘It's about embracing the ethos of 'doing more with less' and finding creative ways to amplify your message without breaking the bank.’ Brilliant, that’s a great help. The research also tells me that ‘Selling something to your target audience and not blowing the budget is a journey that requires resilience, tenacity, and a willingness to embrace failure.’ I’m mastering that last one. So, I’d welcome any suggestions about marketing your own products on a no/low budget. Or you could be kind enough to like, comment and share. That helps a lot - thank you. And of course, this attempt at a thought-provoking post is in itself a thinly veiled and shameless plug for my new book, Eyes of Devilla.
