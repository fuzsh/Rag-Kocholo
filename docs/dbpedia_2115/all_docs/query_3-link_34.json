        "text": "by Kerry Torpey on May 3, 2018\n\nArts & Entertainment\n\nby Ryan Cox ’18\n\nA&E Staff Emeritus\n\nThe Providence College Pep Band is part of Friartown’s heart and soul. I got a chance to talk to three of the seniors—Kasey Cardin ’18, Sam Mahoney ’18, and Kyle Van Dzura ’18—about their memories with the “best band in the land.”\n\nRyan Cox: What motivated you to join?\n\nKasey Cardin: I wanted to be involved with music in some way at PC, and I saw the Pep Band everywhere. I fell in love with them when I came to Accepted Students Day.\n\nKyle Van Dzura: I saw the Pep Band at Accepted Students Day, and I knew right away that I needed to be a part of it. Even passing Friar fans notice how much the band acts like family.\n\nRC: What are some of your favorite songs from the Pep Band?\n\nKC: “Can’t Stop” by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band played it when I went to Accepted Students Day, and I got goosebumps when I got to play it at my first rehearsal.\n\nSam Mahoney: I really enjoyed “September,” “Jungle Boogie,” and “Thriller.” They always remind me of the band from now on.\n\nKV: “Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine” by James Brown. It’s the first tune I learned how to solo on, so it holds a special place in my heart.\n\nRC: What are some of your favorite Pep Band memories?\n\nKC: I always wanted to storm the court, so getting to do that at the Villanova game was awesome. We are so lucky to get to do all these incredible things for free.\n\nSM: I always enjoyed traveling, especially to Raleigh and Charlotte. I got to perform at the NCAA National Hockey Championship and actually watch the Friars win that game.\n\nKV: The 2018 Basketball Big East Tournament. I took a half day from student teaching and took a six-hour bus ride to New York. I’m not saying I’m a good luck charm, but when I arrived the team was down by 17 against Xavier and we went on to win in overtime. It was one of the best games I’ve ever seen.\n\nRC: What are you going to miss the most?\n\nKC: What isn’t there to miss? The worst part is you only get four years.\n\nKV: I’ve met my roommates, best friends, and girlfriend because of Pep Band. The games are fun, but it’s the members that make the Pep Band the best band in the land.\n\nRC: What advice would you give to anyone interested in joining?\n\nSM: There’s room for everyone. Everyone in the group has different talents that all contribute to the ensemble."
