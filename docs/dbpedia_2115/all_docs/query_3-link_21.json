Based out of Los Angeles, she loves discovering new music she can obsess over and will take any opportunity to talk all things animals or aliens. Alt and pop punk are the soundtrack to her daily life so don' try talking to her when she has headphones on.\n\nDJing is a lot better than Jeff Regan’s former job as a hole watcher. “No joke!” he says. “I had to stand outside an empty oil tank all day and write down who walked in and out of the hole.” At Alt Nation, he’s occasionally called upon when there’s a need for someone to watch the paint dry, but mostly it’s his skills on the mic that are taken advantage of.\n\nMadison regrets to admit her first concert was Julian Lennon. As to being a DJ, she says, “I was too ugly to be in the movies,” however, Howard Stern himself has told her she’s cute. If she weren’t a DJ, she’d be a babysitter...or a hooker.

Upon being fired from that he made his way back to Los Angeles where he found work in radio.\n\nAlso appears on SiriusXMU"
