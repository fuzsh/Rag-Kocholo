        "text": "Kyle Landry is a pianist, arranger, improviser, and composer from Methuen, Massachusetts, who currently resides in Southern California. His career in music spans over 15 years, and he holds a degree in Music Composition from the Hartt School of Music, in Connecticut, USA.\n\n​\n\nHe is known for making full use of all 88 notes on the piano, with an emphasis on arpeggios. His passion for playing has generated a dedicated fan base on YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, and Spotify. Much of his work is a result of his love for arranging songs for solo piano. Some of the most popular arrangements include video game, movie, and anime music.\n\n​\n\nKyle cites his number one musical influence as Frédéric François Chopin, but he absorbs musical understanding from as many creative sources as possible. Inspirational sources include: J.S. Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Franz Liszt, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Peter Tchaikovsky, Scott Joplin, George Gershwin, Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson, Hiromi, Joe Hisaishi, Nobuo Uematsu, Koji Kondo, Grant Kirkhope, Nikolai Kapustin, among many others."
