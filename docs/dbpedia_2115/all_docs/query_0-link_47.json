        "text": "I’ll admit that I’ve always had an affinity for sad, slow songs over the years, and the contents of my old iPad reflect that preference. Even I enjoy an uptempo barnburner once in a while, however, and on some nights when the moon is full and the feeling’s right, the old tablet decides that it’s in a mood to groove, and the energy levels get cranked up a few notches. That appears to be the case tonight: As I embarked on another unexpected round of travel, the iPad decided to kick things into high gear and deliver some good-time energy through the speakers. The question now: Was it any good?\n\nThe normal concept of LITS is simple: Hit the shuffle button on my old iPad, listen to ten songs chosen by whatever random number generator Apple uses (which could end up being anything from sizzling singles to deep album cuts to songs not even remotely related to country music), make a snap judgement on how good or bad the songs are, and produce a highly-subjective ranking of the impromptu playlist.\n\nIs this silly and without purpose? Absolutely, but it’s also a chance to potentially introduce folks to some different songs/artists, and potentially introduce people to some great material that they had forgotten or missed. Without further ado, let’s hit the play button and see just how wacky my musical library really is.\n\nThe Playlist\n\n#1: The Temptations, “Get Ready”\n\nWe’re starting off with a retro vibe today, and honestly it’s a song that hasn’t aged terribly well, especially in the wake of trends like Boyfriend country. I’ve always been a fan of the production here: The horns and piano give the song some serious muscle and drive, and the strings offer higher-pitched support to complement the lower-pitched horns. The sound may have some serious energy and force behind it, but it’s that force that gives me pause today when the lyrics are considered. The narrator here is a lovestruck suitor that’s decided to pursue the object of their affection whatever the cost (and regardless of what the other person actually thinks about the arrangement), culminating in the “get ready” hook that comes across as far more commanding (perhaps even demanding) than it should. Lead singer Eddie Kendricks has a solid falsetto that, while I can’t comment on how it stood out then, it certainly stands out from musical acts now, but neither his performance nor the solid harmony work of the other Temptations are enough to counter the pushy nature of the narrator (much like the country artists that defined the Boyfriend country era). It’s got a catchy sound, but I’m not sure I’m sold on the speaker’s attitude, and its ranking here will likely suffer because of it.\n\n#2: Sugarland, “Little Miss”\n\nHonestly, this song feels like the inverse of “Get Ready”: The production is really nothing to write home about, but the writing is a fair bit stronger. The pieces here are what you might expect: An acoustic guitar to carry the melody, a piano to bring some warmth to the track (a departure from the instrument’s usual role), some electric guitars serving in a support role in the background, and a standard drum set keeping time. The resulting sound isn’t terribly catchy or compelling, but at least it suits the more-serious nature of the track. The protagonist here (not the narrator, as they are merely delivering the story as a third party) is a woman who has fallen on hard times romantically, but demonstrates their inner strength and resilience by giving much of themselves and swallowing their pain to keep it from changing who they are. It’s not the healthiest behavior choice, but it’s certainly a relatable one, as we all know someone (or are someone) who is forever supporting others at the expense of themselves. The song helps it case by ending on an optimistic note, showing that the main character, despite their over-devotion to others, has found the time and space to work through their grief and is ready to get back in the romance game once again. Jennifer Nettles does a good job showing us the humanity and the toughness of the protagonist, and uses her charm and charisma to convince the audience that this person should be respected rather than pitied, and that better times are indeed in store for them. (Kristian Bush is…here, I guess, contributing a sparse few notable words to the performance.) It’s a solid song from a group that I feel like has been forgotten a lot faster than I expected, and is probably one of their tracks that best deserves to be remembered.\n\n#3: Clay Walker, “Live, Laugh, Love”\n\nNow this is an entry I can get behind! I’m a huge fan of the production here, with its use of Spanish guitars, accordions, xylophones, organs, and hand-played drums (and even a triangle?!) to give the sound an exotic-island-esque flavor…and then drops in a fiddle-and-steel combo and blends the whole thing together perfectly into an upbeat, carefree mix that you can’t help but rock out to as it plays (the extended outro alone is worth the price of admission). It stood out on the radio back in the day, and stands out in even more in today’s sea of nihilistic, electrified, booze-soaked party tracks (heck, the only thing the narrator is drinking in here is “happiness”). Speaking of the narrator, instead of encouraging the user to stop thinking about everything besides what’s in their glass, the message here is to focus on the things that really matter and make you happy (in this case, family, nature, and home). There’s a simple joy behind this song, and it comes to life thanks to Walker’s lively, cheerful performance, where he applies every bit of his copious charisma to sell the listener on his lifestyles choices (and he succeeds, to say the least). In my opinion, Clay Walker is one of the most underrated country stars of the 1990s, and he released a ton of great material that deserves to be remembered. This one is as good a place to start as any.\n\n#4: Kelsea Ballerini, “Love Me Like You Mean It”\n\nIn hindsight, Ballerini’s radio debut was both a period piece and a sign of things to come. At first listen, this might seem like Rule 63 applied to Bro-Country, with its heavy synthetic beat, token banjo, Grady Smith’s favorite clap track, and its gushing over a generic “boy with your hat back.” However, this was less a copycat track and more of an answer song: The narrator here already dealt with their share of “losers, liars and users…that are playing the game,” and they’re looking for something deeper and more meaningful that a short, superficial fling. If the target of this track wants to pair up, the narrator wants them to “love me like you mean it,” and Ballerini balances the speaker’s openness and interest in love with a seriousness that demands real emotion and commitment (there’s an edge to her delivery, but the punch is pulled a bit—she doesn’t want to scare or overwhelm the other person, but she does want to put them on notice and set her expectations early). Looking back, the song feels like a response to Bro-Country, but set to a beat and spoken in a language that the Bro-Country purveyors could understand. It was an early sample of what Ballerini could (and would) deliver, and revisiting it was more of a treat than I expected.\n\n#5: Shenandoah, “I Wanna Be Loved Like That”\n\nThe tempo is slowing a bit, but the good vibes continue on with our next pick. This is a piano ballad that treads dangerously close to saccharine territory, leaning on overdone tropes (Rebel Without A Cause! Mom & Dad! Old man carrying a torch after their partner’s death!) to tug at the heartstrings and provide a model of the sort of relationship the narrator is looking for. However, I would argue this song never feels sappy or cheesy despite its subject material, and the main reason for that lead singer Marty Rayborn’s heartfelt performance behind the mic. He just sounds so passionate and sincere as he delivers his lines, and you can’t help but believe him when he says “I want to be loved like that.” The production builds up a little over time with the addition of drums and electric guitars, but it feels like a natural progression to the song’s climax rather than appearing forced or over-the-top. I don’t feel the band is terribly well represented here (I don’t think the group ever had as strong a signature sound as, say, Diamond Rio did), but they create a suitable atmosphere for the track that toes the line between genuine and gooey. All in all, I wouldn’t call it a top contender for the top spot, but it’s a pretty decent song nonetheless.\n\n<insert nonexistent YouTube video here>\n\n#6: Garth Brooks, “Mr. Right”\n\nBrooks was often painted as the man destroying country music with his rock-tinged influences (a claim that gets more laughable every year), but the man could drop a stone-cold country song when he wanted to, and “Mr. Right,” an album cut from 1992’s The Chase, was exactly that. With its prominent fiddle and steel guitar, tinkling piano, restrained drum set, and even a relative-slick electric guitar, this track has a good-time Western swing vibe to it, and features none of the louder, rougher elements that became his calling card in later years. The narrator can feel a bit sketchy as a character (he’s up for anything from a one-night stand to a forever love, and can feel a bit too forthcoming in his advances), but Brooks’s legendary everyman charisma helps dispel any reservations the listener might has, and makes you think he’d truly be up for whatever the other person is game for. The song is admittedly a bit short (it clocks in at a hair over two minutes), but its bright tone and rapid tempo make it a real ride from start to finish, and is yet another one of tonight’s entries that is guaranteed to get you moving. Is it enough to be a top contender for the night’s top spot? Well, that depends on what the rest of the list has to say…\n\n#7: Shenandoah, “Church On The Cumberland Road”\n\nNow this just isn’t fair: Not only does Shenandoah get a second entry on the list, but said entry is one of my favorite songs of the 1980s. There’s nothing terribly novel going on with the production (it’s mostly guitars and drums, with a piano sprinkled in at key moments), but it’s a song with some serious tempo and energy behind it, running nearly as fast as the 95 MPH the narrator’s ride is traveling. Raybon puts on another master class behind the mic: The narrator has partied far too hard and is now in danger of standing up his bride-to-be at “the church on the Cumberland Road,” but there’s both emotion and urgency (panic?) infused in his delivery here, and the audience is encouraged to think of him as the classic country music bad boy: He lives too fast and too hard, but he wants to do the right thing and has his heart in the right place. The second verse has always been a personal favorite of mine, as the speaker talks about the state of their compatriots (somewhere there’s a drawing I did many years ago of a person draped over a road sign because younger Kyle thought the line was “Bobby’s got his head hanging over the sign“) and berates the driver for not doing a good enough Richard Petty impression. Well, it may or may not have been fast enough to save a wedding, but it might have been enough to end the horse race in this post early. This is a rollicking good time of a song, and I can’t think of too many worthy competitors to it.\n\n#8: The Statler Brothers, “This Ole House (Live)”\n\nAnd the (up)beat goes on! The Statler Brothers had plenty of their own hits, but their cover of Stuart Hamblen’s 1954 spiritual classic turns out to be quite the sugar rush itself. Don Reid is the primary lead singer (brother Harold gets to open the verses) and sounds for all the world like a preacher at a revival sermon, and the barbershop quartet harmonies of the group remains as strong as ever nearly forty years after the group formed. The production leans into the revival motif of the track, with a driving piano and drum set producing a mix that absolutely crackles with energy as it speeds through its subject matter. The song is missing a bunch of verses and is here and gone in just over a minute-and-a-half, but it’s quite a trip for that short period of time, and the narrator’s description of the past and present state of their house do a nice job letting you visualize the scene and feel the strength of the speaker’s convictions. It’s probably not a contender for the crown tonight, but it was certainly fun while it lasted.\n\n#9: Charlie Daniels, “Drinkin’ My Baby Goodbye”\n\nWait, Daniels had other songs beyond “The Devil Went Down To Georgia”? Yes, and this 1986 track was actually his second-most popular song on the country charts. The sound here is pretty standard for Daniels’s work: Rougher, rock-tinged electric guitars, tinkling barroom pianos, and of course his signature fiddle during a lot of heavy lifting in between verses and choruses. The tempo here, however, is about as fast as you would ever hear Daniels go, and the combination produces a driving, energetic atmosphere that propels the song forward. The writing is nothing to write home about (neither party involved comes out looking great, and the description we get makes the relationship seem pretty toxic and not really worth drinking over), and Daniels’s performance as an oft-criticized, repressed narrator who thinks that drinking himself into a stupor will show his ex exactly who get along without who feels like a precursor to the Ex-Boyfriend junk that we’ve been buried in recently, but it doesn’t feel quite as nasty as Morgan Wallen’s recent rants, and there’s at least a hint of self-awareness here (deep down Daniels seems to know that his behavior won’t do or change anything, but he’s going to do it anyway). It may not make much noise in today’s rankings, but it’s a decent bunch of noise nonetheless.\n\n#10: Mark O’Connor, “The Devil Comes Back To Georgia”\n\nWell, this was an unexpected bit of synergy! Lots of people know “The Devil Went Down To Georgia,” but not as many recall the 1993 sequel from fiddle player Mark O’Connor, complete with an all-star vocal cast of Johnny Cash, Travis Tritt, and of course Daniels himself. The story is basically a repeat of the previous tale (the Devil challenges an out-of-practice Johnny to get the golden fiddle back, but Johnny whips themselves back into shape and wins the second bout in the end), and the production choices and song structure are so similar that it wouldn’t feel out of place in the current Plagiarism (sorry, “interpolation”) trend, but this track at least maintains the continuity of the story and even builds on it slightly, meaning it feels like it truly honors the legacy of the original. Production-wise, the song is as fiddle-driven as you would expect, and O’Connor proves himself to be Daniels’s equal on the instrument, ripping through impressive riffs with the ease you expect from an expert musician (sound-wise, this might actually be better than the original). All three of the vocalists deliver solid, credible performances in their roles, and while Tritt needed some help from some echoey effects to sound truly demonic, no one here is mailing it in just to cash a paycheck. It can be tough to make a sequel that truly equals the original, but if I’m honest, this sequel might actually surpass its predecessor. Is it enough to make a big splash on this list? It’s time to find out…\n\nThe Results\n\nI can’t fight the weight of history here. “Church On The Cumberland Road” has always been a personal favorite of mine, and if I were to make a list of my Top 10 favorite songs ever, it has a strong chance of making the cut. Still, I think this was a fairly strong list from top to bottom with few disappointments, and it shows that while I tend to prefer slower, deeper, more meaningful songs these days, I still enjoy a fast-paced musical dash now and again, and there have been quite a few good ones made over the years. In truth, it’s all about finding something that reflects your mood and your feelings, and any song of any speed has a chance to fill that role.\n\nWas Chris Stapleton going for ‘creepy’ on this track? Because creepy is definitely the vibe I’m getting.\n\nBack when I started this blog, Stapleton was considered outside the mainstream as a country artist and struggled to get consistent airplay. These days, his commercial success is finally starting to catch up to his critical success, but he can still be pretty inconsistent (“Joy Of My Life” stalled out at #25 on Billboard’s airplay chart, and then “White Horse” made it to #2 and nearly broke into the Top 10 on the Hot 100), and he’s never felt like he’s reached his potential for stardom within the genre. I’ve never truly connected with Stapleton’s material, and that trend continues with “Think I’m In Love With You,” a bizarre blend of Boyfriend Country and nostalgic longing that feels far sleazier than it should and doesn’t sit well with me at all.\n\nThe production here leans into the “dangerous love” theme that Aaron Watson and pretty much nobody else has used successfully over the last few years, and unfortunately this mix doesn’t add Stapleton’s name to that list. The most notable thing here is the instrument that anchors the sound: I talk about acoustic and electric guitars a lot, but bass guitars rarely get attention on the blog (mostly thanks to my treble-heavy listening setup). The bass breaks through here, however, and it gives the song a serious groove on the low end that the other instruments (electric guitar, keyboards, a massive string section) can play off of and fill in the holes around it. (The drums are noticeably prominent in the mix as well, likely to help support the bass and let the song maintain its rhythm even when said bass gets overshadowed.) The perplexing choice, however, is just how dark of a direction they chose for this mix: The minor chords far outnumber the major ones, and and the bass’s prominence and the general neutral-to-dark instrument tones give this song an ominous feel in addition to a sensual one. It might have worked if it had support from the writing, but instead the framing of this as a long-lost romance feels makes this feel sleazy and even a bit cringey, like the narrator really needs to find something better to do with their time. As good as the groove is, it’s badly misused and feels out of place here.\n\nVocally, Stapleton falls into the trap that Jake Owen is forever getting himself caught in: He’s a talented vocalist with charisma to burn, but he’s a little too good at filling the narrator’s shoes and emphasizes their negative personality traits without bringing his own positive qualities to the performance. Of course, the song does him no favors by keeping him trapped in his lower register and forcing him to keep the volume low, giving him few opportunities to show off the vocal power that is his calling card (he gets one incoherent scream where you have no idea what he’s saying, and that’s it). He delivers a lot of sensuality in his performance (something most artists in this genre seem completely incapable of doing) and the tension that underlies his restrained performance gives you the sense that there’s some serious passion bubbling underneath the surface, but he leans a bit too far in that direction, and instead of sounding enthralled and romantic, he just sounds super horny, as if the physical attraction was all that was driving him (despite the fact that the writing desperately tries to say that this is real love, right down to the hook). Stapleton’s talents are badly misapplied and squandered here, and the relationship here ends up feeling shallow and unimportant as a result.\n\nDespite all the earlier negativity, I think the writing might actually be the worst part of this song. For one thing, there’s barely enough lyrics here for it to qualify as a song: We get a verse, a verse/bridge hybrid, and no less than four complete rounds of an uninspiring chorus to fill the rest of the time. The framing here is awful: The narrator has decided that they would like to continue a long-lost romance long after the statute of limitations has passed, declares “I think I’m in love with you” in a way that feels too sudden to be believable (as if they just woke up one day and decided they wanted to do this), and spends the rest of the song proclaiming that this person actually means everything to them (like any good Boyfriend country singer) and whining about not being able to do everything they want to with them (which Stapleton’s performance insinuates is mostly sexual stuff). We never actually get a sense of what the relationship was really like back in the day (was it serious, or just a fling? All we know if that the narrator didn’t take it seriously), we never get any details about the other person in the relationship or how they feel (or felt) about the narrator, and we never get a sense of how the speaker plans to make it work this time around (sure, you might “wanna make your dreams come true,” but it’s going to take a lot more than unbridled passion to make that happen). I’ve never been a fan of nostalgia-based tracks like this one, and the lack of details makes the song feel like an empty shell that the listener has to fill in with their own life experiences. I don’t know if the narrator’s former partner cares about this old relationship, but I sure as heck don’t.\n\n“Think I’m In Love With You” is a doughnut of a song, with a lot of sugar and sprinkles on the outside and absolutely nothing at its core. With its foreboding sound, half-baked lyrics, and a misguided vocal performance from Chris Stapleton, this track sits at the uncomfortable intersection of nostalgia, sex jams, and stale Boyfriend country, none of which the audience is terribly interested in hearing. It’s a real disappointment coming from someone with Stapleton’s talent, and it makes me think that his airplay inconsistency will likely continue into the near future. Even generational vocal talents have a shelf life in Music City, and if Stapleton wants to maintain his position as the critical darling of the industry, he’ll need to do a lot better than this.\n\nRating: 4/10. Think I’m gonna pass on this one.\n\nWait, lemme get this straight: Radio stations didn’t want to put Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em” on the airwaves, but they had no issue adding this 80s-pop retread to their playlists?\n\nOfficially Gwen Stefani has never had a single on country radio before, but she’s appeared as a featured artist twice with husband Blake Shelton on “Nobody But You” and “Happy Anywhere.” In 2024, however, she’s taking the lead role, releasing “Purple Irises” as presumably the lead single for her next project (although her last actual release was a 2021 EP, and she hasn’t released a full non-Christmas album since 2016). Whether or not this song was worth dropping, however, is a tougher question: It’s a song that’s hard to read thanks to mediocre execution, and really doesn’t do a great job interesting the user in what it has to say.\n\nThe production here is the biggest surprise, especially in the wake of the Beyoncé controversy I referenced earlier. The debate over what is and isn’t “country” has been raging for decades and I tend to fall on the big-tent side of the issue (even when it leads to disasters like the Bro-Country era), but when I hear the deliberately retro-pop stylings of the synthesizers and the clean, vaguely-robotic electric guitars (along with some rougher axes in the back of the room that have more of a rock vibe to them) , “country” isn’t the first (or second, or third) genre that comes to mind. Aside from that, we get the standard offerings: An acoustic guitar helps open the song and provides some background support, a clean, sharp-sounding drum set anchors the mix, and that’s basically it. The brighter instrument tones and echoey audio effects are a confounding element, as they overwhelm even the regular minor chords to give the song an upbeat, energetic vibe that clashes badly with the writing (the narrator’s anxiety struggles to break through the noise) and leaves the listener confused about how the song is actually trying to make them feel. I think that a restrained approach that put the lyrics first would have been the better play here, because as it is I’m just not sure what this song really wants to be.\n\nTo Stefani’s credit, I think she does a better job reflecting the unease within the writing than the producer does, but she gets overwhelmed by the sound (especially on the bridge) and fails to make the narrator’s tale compelling in any way. I’m not really familiar with Stefani’s earlier work with No Doubt or as a solo artist, but despite being in her mid-fifties her vocals sound really impressive here, and although she’s caught between the lyrics and the production, I think she makes an honest effort to try to stay true to the intent of the writing. That said, an honest effort and a successful one are two very different things, and while she certainly seems concerned about the long-term prospects of her relationship, she’s fighting against a sound that gets top billing in the recording, and just can’t get the audience to share in her feelings. (As for Shelton, his role here is pretty minimal—his harmony is replaceable and nothing to write home about, and his lines during the second verse don’t actually say that much and are stretched to the limit to fill the available space.) I’ve certainly heard worse turns behind the mic than Stefani’s, but I’ve also heard a lot of better performances too.\n\nIf I had to describe the lyrics in one word..honestly, I’m not sure which one I would use: Anxiety? Insecurity? In the narrator’s words, “overthinking”? The speaker here is confronting the passage of time in the context of a long-term relationship, and they’re concerned that time will make them less attractive and lead to their partner deciding to leave them for someone else (in fact, they’re not quite certain why their partner came around in the first place). It’s a broadly-relatable idea and not a bad concept for a song, but the execution here is lacking: There are moments where lines feel far too short for the rhythm, the hyper-focus on the problem makes the narrator feel over-the-top and even a little whiny, and the frequent floral metaphors do not fit the song at all. The “purple irises” hook doesn’t seem to have any connection to the topic at all (after ten minutes of Google searching, it seems that the color and type of flower here could signify just about anything), and trying to force this theme into the track leads to nonsensical lines like “blooming into the change” and “leaving love stains.” We do get a glimpse of the partner’s point of view from Shelton’s lines, but it’s pretty short and generic, and doesn’t offer the perspective that both the narrator and the listener really need. It simply doesn’t convince the audience to truly care about the protagonist’s plight, and when it’s paired with such an ill-fitting sound, the message just can’t break through.\n\n“Purple Irises” is yet another example of a song that can’t quite figure what it wants to be, and thus ends up being nothing at all. Pairing pensive lyrics with a danceable beat that drowns out whatever Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton are trying to do leaves you with a song that’s pulling you in two different directions, and failing to make much of a point as a result. I think there’s a kernel of a good idea here that could have been built upon with better execution, but as it is it’s just kind of a mess that fails to leave much of an impression on the listener. Stefani and Shelton might be the genre’s premier power couple right now, but they’ll need to release better material than this to keep that title long-term.\n\nRating: 5/10. Don’t waste your time looking for this one.\n\nUsually double-video posts mean a long, annoyed rant at the state of the industry. This one…well, at least it will be long.\n\nThere have been a lot of rumors about a potential Nintendo Direct presentation dropping this month, but given all the first-party trailers that the company has been tossing out on YouTube lately (how many more Princess Peach: Showtime! costumes can their be?), I think if such a presentation is happening, it’s not going to be the full-fledged Direct people were hoping for. As part of their information dump, the company dropped back-to-back videos yesterday detailing the new releases for the next season of the main Splatoon 3 game and what the game’s Side Order paid DLC was going to be all about. It was nice to finally get some information about a DLC package that was coming out relatively soon (and whose Wave 1 features were so underwhelming), and it helped cover for a season announcement that felt a bit underwhelming in itself. Overall, my reaction is pretty mixed, but at least now I feel more comfortable in actually purchasing the DLC.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about the new Fresh Season trailer, and if it wasn’t clear before, this season made it painfully clear that the season update model was not a good idea for this game, at least with its current content level. The game decided to stretch its deployment of second kits for weapons to cover the entire two-year release cycle, which means that inevitably some people would be waiting those entire two years for their favorite weapon to get an alternate loadout. Sure, we finally got the .52 Gal Deco, New Squiffer, and Custom E-Liter 4K, but with one season left after this, I found myself thinking more about the weapons that weren’t here than the ones that were: The Custom Hydra Splatling, the Bamboozler 14 MK II, the Nautilus 79, the Glooga Dualies Deco, and the Custom Range Blaster. (If there’s one thing I would fault Nintendo for here, it’s shortchanging splatling players by not giving them a second Hydra, Nautilus, or Heavy Edit kit until the last season. Someone had to be last, but a single weapon class shouldn’t have been ignored this badly.) I do think that there will be some surprise third kits coming in a separate update (we got some in both Splatoon and Splatoon 2), but I think Nintendo is going to have to rethink their content distribution cycle for the next game.\n\nAs far as the kits we did get, they were…okay, I guess? The Custom Explosher kit took the most heat for its Splash Wall/Triple Splashdown combination, but I don’t think the kit is as bad as the Internet is making it out to be: The wall gives you some cover from longer-ranged weapons (*cough* pencil *cough*), and the splashdown can ward off short-range weapons that try to rush you (which is exactly what they will try against something as slow as the explosher). I actually like that kit better than I do the one for the new Recycled Brella 24 Mk I: Angle Shooter offers some combo potential but is mostly useless, and while Big Bubbler (which was confirmed in a later tweet) provides some defense for a weapon that will be playing without its shield, I’d rather have something that offers some offensive capabilities as well, such as a Kraken Royale. The .52 Gal Deco is basically dead on arrival thanks to its Splattercolor Screen (Nintendo had better fix that special once and for all in the next balance patch), but the main weapon is strong enough that a .52 with no special at all would still be an above-average weapon in the current landscape. Nintendo played it very close to the vest with this trailer and didn’t show off a lot of the sub and special weapons (Custom E-Liter has beacon, Foil Flingza has Suction Bomb, and that’s pretty much all we saw – the .52 Deco’s kit had to be revealed in a later tweet), so there’s still some room for pleasant surprises, but given Nintendo’s track record, I’m not holding my breath.\n\nThe last two new main weapon classes arrived this season (Douser Daulies FF and Recycled Brella 24 Mk I), and while the former didn’t have a ton of details revealed (it’s got, er, long range and relatively low damage?), the brief look at the new Brella revealed a lot: Its shield launches and regenerates quickly and has a decent amount of health (about 300 HP from my analysis), so this is a weapon that’s going to be launching the shield at opponents early and often, and will usually be playing without it. The pellet count of its shots appears to be less than a Splat or Tenta Brella, but they’re a bit more concentrated, so the hope is that its damage output and time-to-kill will be a bit more consistent than its siblings. I’m a little concerned because a shield-less Brella is generally a dead Brella, but this thing seemed to have decent range and ink efficiency, so if it poses a bit more of a threat than other Brellas, maybe that can compensate for the frequent lack of its shield. It’s something that I’ll experiment with, but I don’t see it replacing my other Brellas as go-to-weapons.\n\nIn terms of the new maps being added, I think the dev team really nailed the atmosphere, but whether or not the stages are any good remains to be seen. Marlin Airport marks the return of fan-powered platforms similar to Ancho-V Games from the first two Splatoons, but it also looks pretty wide open and its size is unconfirmed, so the threat of it being another long-range-favored hallway-type map still looms. Similarly, I like the background of the new Salmon Run stage Bonerattle Arena (it looks like something out of a Mad Max movie), but the layout itself looks kind of…basic? Standard? I think it will be fine to play on, but given how little I notice the background scenery when I’m actually playing the mode, I think it’s a little overhyped right now. (The fact that only one PvP map was announced concerns me a little bit, but given how shaky the map design has been in Splatoon 3, maybe just getting one main map is for the best.)\n\nAs for the Fizzbangs…yeah, they don’t look all that interesting to me. They make for a nice fireworks show during a Splatfest match or two, but I feel like the novelty will wear off really quickly unless they’re tied to more significant changes to the event. Splatfests have been taking a lot of heat for feeling stale after three iterations of the game (note to Nintendo: Where are all the Big Runs that could break up this monotony?), so I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more Splatfest changes dropped in the lead-up to the season, but on their own I’m not impressed.\n\nOverall, I’m feeling pretty meh about the upcoming season, with fewer maps, unremarkable kits, and none of the quality-of-life extras that could have helped bolster the season’s output. It puts a lot more pressure on Side Order to succeed, but I’m finally starting to feel more positive towards the DLC now that we’ve finally been given an idea of what it actually is.\n\nI’m so unfamiliar with this genre that I’ve been calling Side Order a “roguelike” instead of the roguelite it technically is, but in fairness I’m not sure we could have noticed the difference based on the meager information we had going into this trailer. In roguelike fashion, we are tasked with climbing a 30-floor spire, collecting chips that strengthen our abilities along the way. Failing to complete a floor results in the loss of everything you’ve collected, but the items will be converted into a currency that can be used to purchase more-permanent upgrades, such as more lives. I like that the objectives seem a bit more varied than “waste everything that ventures into your sight line,” and the color chip system adds some variety and individuality to your builds, letting you put together builds that fit your weapon and your playstyle (although the trailer didn’t really talk about how weapons were selected or changed). Some of the enhancements seemed a little overpowered on the surface, but some of the clips that showed weaker weapons trying to take out a tough enemy looked really frustrating, so I think the upgrades will help make the game feel more fluid and satisfying (and perhaps let the game up the difficulty level a bit in response). The gameplay loop of ‘choose floor, select chips, complete objective’ is easy to understand while being open enough to keep the game from getting stale (so it looks like floors could feel like Salmon Run one match and a ranked battle the next), and the difficulty options should help accommodate players of various skill levels.\n\nSo yeah, after waiting forever and declaring that I wasn’t buying the Splatoon 3 DLC until I was reasonably certain it would be worth it, I think I’m ready to put my money down on Side Order now. The Splatoon community has felt like it’s been fading over the last few seasons, but this could give it an extra spark of energy, similar to what Octo Expansion did for Splatoon 2. There’s a lot riding on how well it performs in both sales and gameplay, but from what I’ve seen now, I think it’s got a fighting chance.\n\nThe Splatoon 3 release schedule is running out fast, so the game doesn’t have much time to apply its final coats of polish and finally prove that it’s a better game than Splatoon 2. I’m still on the S2 bandwagon and the seasonal updates we’ve been getting haven’t move me off of it, but Side Order could be the thing that finally pushes me into the S3 camp for good. As far as the seasonal update, its ultimate fate is going to depend on the yet-to-be-announced balance changes that will be coming next month (Snipewriter nerfs? Splattercolor Screen fixes?). A single-player expansion will only buy you so much goodwill in a multiplayer-focused game, so let’s hope that the developers can stick the landing with their last official updates.\n\nA clickbait title? Perhaps…but the answer depends on how much blame a platform should shoulder for how it’s used.\n\nI spend a lot of time on the Internet these days, reading articles, watching videos, and of course making my own contributions (stories, blog posts, videos) to the current content avalanche. Something that struck me recently was a Vox article by Rebecca Jennings that discussed the outsized importance that branding and self-marketing now plays in succeeding in any sort of artistic endeavor. Everyone, including the “65-year-old mom [of one of Jennings’s interviewees], who’s an accountant,” is being told to spruce up their profile and put themselves out there to build enough of a “following” to make the gatekeepers of the powers that be pay attention.\n\nThe article came out literally a day after I discussed the role that consumer-created content would play in the wake of layoffs in both the music and gaming spaces:\n\n“A common theme across some of the articles I’ve read lately is how promotional and marketing positions are either facing the ax now or are being eyed for the chopping block…Have you noticed how often I’ve mentioned in reviews of new artists that said artist leveraged a large social media following to secure a record deal? Instead of going out and looking for musical acts to discover, it seems like record companies are sitting back and letting social media do the work for them.”\n\nThis change may be exacerbated by the layoffs, but it’s been happening for a while, and according to Jennings, it’s affecting more than just music: If you’ve got a book or other creative work that you’d like to sell, you need to show the suits in power that you’ve already got an audience that’s willing to pay for it. Investors yearn for minimal risk and maximal ROI, and having an existing fanbase behind you helps achieve both.\n\nOkay, sure, but I’m several paragraphs into this rant and haven’t even said the word “TikTok” yet. What’s its role in all of this, and with Spotify and its manipulable playlists sitting right there, why aren’t they the platform with their name in the title? Well, TikTok is considered the fastest-growing social media platform right now, and most of the new artists that have appeared on the radio lately have a strong connection to the platform:\n\nAshley Cooke? She “went to TikTok where she built a thriving fanbase” during the pandemic.\n\nChase Matthew? His first taste of fame came from a viral TikTok hit in 2021.\n\nBryan Martin? His own viral TikTok smash conveniently predated his record deal.\n\nTigirlily Gold? Once they started posting their work to TikTok, they “amassed a ton of attention and signed with Monument Records.”\n\nTikTok is the place where more and more people are starting to hang out (especially the coveted teenage demographic), and so the record labels are over there too, watching to see who emerges from the sea of content to rack up major views and thus has the audience to warrant an investment in. With that criteria in place, the creator falls into the trap that Jennings highlights, and is forced to market themselves as aggressively as possible to maximize their visibility and boost their following.\n\nNow, building up an audience on social media isn’t necessarily a bad thing: As Jennings points out, “theoretically, anyone can go viral and bypass the traditional gatekeepers of creative success.” The problem is that the next step after a social media explosion seems to be a major-label deal, which sends you straight into the arms of those traditional gatekeepers on Music Row and on the radio. You can probably guess what happens next: Nashville stuffs its latest victim signee into the bland template that is the current country music meta, and we get a “debut” that sounds like every other track that came before it. Occasionally I seek out an artist’s material that predates their radio debut, and I’m usually taken aback by how much better those songs are than the one we’re getting served on the airwaves (I mean, there’s a good reason some of this stuff goes viral!). So yeah, anything and anyone can potentially find success, but if it just pushes artists to join the big corporate machines of Music Row and lose any trace of originality, what have we really gained?\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that TikTok is completely blameless in what’s going on. Matthew Patrick does a nice job breaking down the ramifications of viewing short-form content in a passive scroll, as we usually do on TikTok or with YouTube Shorts, and one of their takeaways is that if a creator (whether they are a musician, actor, subject matter expert, video game player, or something else) is reduced to a 60-second clip containing very little identifying information, it minimizes their role and their identity, to the point where most people never know who the creator was at all. In musical terms, we may latch on to a viral hit that comes across our feed, but unless that person is continuously feeding us new material (or is doing something else to catch our attention, like wearing a flashy jacket), they’re stuck as a one-hit wonder whose name the viewer never knew to begin with.\n\nThis isn’t a fate that anyone wants, so naturally it pushes artists to find ways to make their success more sustainable, and the first people that come to mind (at least in the country sphere) are the mega labels on Music Row. In this way, TikTok becomes less of an new path to success and more of a feeder system to the old path. Sure, Nashville doesn’t have to use social media this way, but TikTok could also do more to avoid being just a minor league for rich and powerful media companies.\n\nNow, could this change in the future? Absolutely: TikTok has been steadily extending its video length limit over the last few years in hopes of better monetizing the content, and in doing so it gives creators more time to form a connection with the viewer and hopefully convince them that their content is worth coming back too. (It’s kind of ironic that TikTok is trying to become YouTube while YouTube is simultaneously using Shorts to try to become TikTok.) If people move from being fans of songs to becoming fans of artists, this could help the artist find success on their own terms, and they can make music (and ideally money) the way they want to, instead of getting stuffed into the same mold as every other artist on a major label. Labels could adjust their strategies as well: Scouring social media for talent isn’t a bad thing, but they could also recognize that great musicians aren’t always great marketers, and do more to seek out undiscovered talent wherever it may be on display. It’s a more-expensive proposition with no guarantee of success, but it’s not like every (or even many) of their social media discoveries has panned out either.\n\nTikTok may not be “killing” country music, but it certainly feels like a weapon that’s being miswielded by major labels right now. There’s got to be a way to do this so that artists can bring their best selves and best stories to the stage without also having to being the best carnival barker on the Internet, and labels can find the profits they crave by discovering the best talent and letting that talent do what it does best. Money talks and likely always will, but I’d like to think that quality still matters, and letting people play to their strengths rather than forcing them into unfamiliar/uncomfortable roles feels like a much more reliable road to success.\n\nNow if you’ll excuse me, I have a YouTube Short to post. After all, you gotta keep those viewers engaged!\n\nWait…has country music realized that it might actually have something to say?\n\n2023 was a rotten year for mainstream country overall, but it felt like their was a slight uptick near the end of the year, as the Ex-Boyfriend movement started losing steam and other trends rose up to challenge it (the whole Rebel Without A Cause trend is okay, the Plagiarism trend not so much). The genre seems a bit unsettled right now, and artists seem to be experimenting with different ideas (such as—gasp!—stepping back from the beer/truck meta) to see where the next big hit will come from. In some cases, this means adding a bit more depth and meaning to their material, and while it’s still early, I get the sense that the idea is starting to catch on. Case in point: Dan + Shay, the poster children of the Boyfriend country era (and an act that’s felt a bit directionless since then), chose to pivot from their super-slick, pop-tinged presentation and release the title track from their Bigger Houses album as its second single. Yes, “Bigger Houses” is a bit lightweight and far from groundbreaking, but its steps towards thoughtfulness are a notable step above what they’ve been dumping on us to date, and I’m curious to see if this signals a bigger shift in the duo’s future direction.\n\nThe production here is notable for just how un-Dan + Shay it sounds: This is a fully acoustic arrangement featuring a guitar, mandolin, and dobro, with the latter two filling any empty space between lyrics and covering the bridge solo. There are no electric axes, no keyboards, no percussion of any sort…how in the world did Dan + Shay sneak this thing past the censors down on Music Row? (One interesting note: I have no idea who Bryan Sutton is, but the YouTube video credits him with playing every instrument on the track, which makes me think he deserve top billing along with the vocalists.) The resulting sounds feels more organic and less manufactured than their previous releases, and the calm, reflective atmosphere that it creates does a good job inviting the listener to ruminate on the subject matter. (The instrument tones are fairly neutral and there are regular minor chords included, hinting at the disappointment waiting behind the “virtues” of workaholism and consumer culture and encouraging folks to step back and take a closer look at their life goals.) It’s a significant change for the pair’s sound, and in this case I think it’s a change for the better, as the smaller arrangement doesn’t make the sound feel smaller too, and its better fit leads to a better focus on what really matters in the song. I’m not sure what convinced Dan + Shay to go this route (Dan Smyers actually has producer credits on this track), but I’d argue it was the right call.\n\nWhile the sound may change, the vocals are the same: Shay Mooney handles the lead duties as always, and Smyers is limited to harmony work that is so replaceable not even Brian Kelley can tell who was behind the mic (good thing Smyers contributed on the production side, because he didn’t help much here). The big question for Mooney is this: After years of being one of the faces and voices of the Boyfriend country era, can he grow out the role of endless suitor à la Thomas Rhett and come across as a mature, experienced speaker who’s got something worthwhile to share? It’s a question that can’t be answered with a single song, but I think Mooney does a good job selling the story here. Dan + Shay have been active for over a decade now, and so Mooney has the track record to go along with his charm and charisma (on a side note, I feel like his higher voice pairs really well with this kind of acoustic, almost bluegrass-like production), and he makes the narrator’s revelations feel genuine, heartfelt, and naturally found. I wasn’t terribly fond of his romantic overtures, but he’s not bad in the role of a settled-down, seen-it-all protagonist, which is good sign for the continued success of the duo.\n\nThe writing here tries to serve as a reality check for folks running on the capital-worshipping, clout-chasing hamster wheel that modern society has become: More money and more stuff isn’t the key to happiness, and things like family can provide the sort of satisfaction that “bigger houses” can’t. It’s not exactly a new idea, and even home-based tracks like “Buy Dirt” allude to it, but it’s still an important thing to remind people about. In an era where personal branding is everything and people are actively punished for not having money, it’s far too easy to get caught up in the pursuit of money and status and projecting your “country” cred for all the world to see (a particular problem in this genre, with artists forever posturing with their beer and their trucks, while also trying to sell you said beer and trucks). It’s important to remember that “bigger houses” or a “shined up Chevy” aren’t really the point; it’s whether or not you are happy and content with where you are and where you’re going. (I appreciate the use of the shiny Chevrolet here, since it’s an item and a metaphor that most listeners will understand.) The proposed solution here is more of a traditional one (Family! Kids! Pets!), and in truth there are lots of other ways to find joy in life, even a “shined up Chevy” (the shiny ’56 Chevy in my father’s garage certainly makes him happy). The key, however, is that chasing fame and fortune just for the sake of appearing happy and successful won’t actually get you there, and you should instead identify and focus on the things in life that will. It’s a little tired and a little cheesy, but it’s still important.\n\nIf “Bigger Houses” is a signal of a change in direction for Dan + Shay, then I think I’m on board with it. With its traditional production and more-meaningful writing, you would never guess that this was a D + S song if it wasn’t given away by the solid (and identifiable) vocal performance. We’re only a month or so into the year, but I’ve heard enough surprises in my reviews thus far to wonder if something fundamental is shifting underneath Music City and the genre at large, and the powers that be have finally decided to put a little more effort into their releases, and dial back the mass-produced mediocrity that has plagued country music in recent years. I’ve been around long enough to know that a truly major shift in a positive direction is probably wishful thinking, but I suppose a guy can dream, right?\n\nRating: 7/10. Another good score? I’m starting to think I’m going soft on y’all.\n\nGame demos have to walk a fine line to entice both new and old players, and I’m not sure this one pulled it off.\n\nWith the Switch having a massive install base while also seemingly in its twilight years, the time was ripe for Nintendo to start bringing the most long-forgotten of franchises out of mothballs and cash in on the tail end of the Switch’s lifespan. Advance Wars 1 + 2: Re-Boot Camp, Super Mario RPG, Another Code: Recollection, Luigi’s Mansion 2, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door…I once said that the Switch’s end goal was to include every game that had ever been released, and Nintendo certainly did its part to make that happen.\n\nMario vs. Donkey Kong, which drops in a couple of weeks, falls into this same category. This game was originally released for the Game Boy Advance back in 2004, and while the series continued on afterwards in some shape or form for the next decade or so (the last game mentioned by Wikipedia appeared in 2016), it was mostly relegated to the background as Nintendo’s bigger franchises and spin-offs took center stage. Much like with Paper Mario, Nintendo decided to return the series closer to its roots for its Switch release, giving Mario vs. Donkey Kong a new coat of paint and a playable demo to entice on-the-fence players to give it a try.\n\nI hadn’t played a Donkey Kong game aside from the early-eighties arcade version, but I’d also heard good things about the ’94 and ’04 releases, so I decided to take the plunge and see how the demo looked and felt. In the end, however, the biggest takeaway from the demo was similar to what I found in the Live A Live demo: There simply wasn’t enough content to truly evaluate the game or its potential, and what was did get felt a bit underwhelming due to its presentation.\n\nThe demo consisted of four levels pulled from the initial world of the game: Three standard levels where you had to find a key and a Mini-Mario toy to proceed, and one where you had to lead a group of Mini-Marios around the stage to collect some letters and bring them all back to their toy box. The levels are exactly what you’d expect from an introductory world: They’re basic, straightforward, and lacking in any sort of real challenge, letting you complete the whole thing in about ten minutes (20 if you try it again in two-player mode, which didn’t seem to make much of a difference). I certainly appreciate the way the game tries to ease new players into the game (and the addition of casual mode certainly helps here), but the demo leaned a little too far in this direction (we didn’t even get a boss fight), and ended up being a bit of a snoozefest overall, especially the Mini-Mario-leading level. There are a lot of levels being advertised in the game (over 130), and there were some intriguing mechanics and obstacles hinted at in the closing montage, but the demo itself doesn’t give us a great look at what the game might entail, and how challenging it might get. Without getting to play some of those levels, the game leaves us with a lot of unanswered questions about how the game will play as it goes along, far too many for me to feel completely comfortable picking up the game.\n\nAs far as the controls go, Mario has many of the same moves that you might expect from his platforming titles: While he can’t run, he can jump, climb, pick up enemies and items (in a nod to Super Mario Bros. 2, he can ride on some enemies such as the mechanical Shy Guys), triple jump, backflip, and swing off of wires. The major new mechanic that might surprise non-Mario vs. DK players is the handstand, which allows Mario to defend against attacks from above while moving across a platform. It all seems pretty interesting, but the demo doesn’t give you a reason to use many of these moves: You swing off of some wires, you pick up some trash cans, and that’s pretty much it. Once again, it seems that the focus was on showing off the basics and getting players acclimated to the standard controls before throwing them into the deep end of the move pool, but I feel like it didn’t give us the full picture of what Mario could do, and how much fun it could be to do it. (I mean, how bad would it have been to throw in the brick-dropping stage that they keep showing in their trailers to at least have people try the handstand?) What’s worse is that the movement (especially the jumping) can feel awkwardly stiff when controlling your character. For example, you don’t have the control over your jump momentum that you do in the mainline Mario games: If you try to turn back, you’ll still jump out about halfway before suddenly spinning around and going back. The game seemed to feel more natural using the D-Pad rather than the Control Stick, and while that’s not necessarily a bad thing, it does take a little getting used to.\n\nAll in all, I don’t think the Mario vs. Donkey Kong demo does a great job selling the full game to its players. I understand wanting to ease people in and give them some surprises to discover, but you’ve got to hook them enough to actually buy the game first, and this demo gives away so little of the game that it doesn’t give you a sense of whether it will be worth the $50 you’ll need to lay out for it. I still may pick up the game and try it out (if nothing else, it gives me something else to stream besides Splatoon 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe), but this demo didn’t move the needle for me, and with its focus on simple, easy-to-understand mechanics and level design, I suspect that many experienced players didn’t get a whole lot of anything out of it either. A demo has its work cut out for it if it wants to appeal to a wide range of gamers, and this demo, much like Donkey Kong when he tumbles from the girders, simply doesn’t stick the landing.\n\nAcknowledging a problem is only useful if you actually do something to correct it.\n\nIt’s officially been thirty years since Tim McGraw leaped into the country music stratosphere with Not A Moment Too Soon, and while such longevity in a notoriously youth-oriented business is impressive, it’s been a long time since he held much influence with the genre. He hasn’t had a number one single since before the launch of this blog (2016’s “Humble And Kind”), and while he’s managed to reach the top five on the radio with recent releases like “7500 OBO” and “Standing Room Only,” the middling showings of these tracks on the Hot Country Songs chart and the Hot 100 indicate that there’s not of ton of real enthusiasm behind him anymore. Perhaps McGraw has noticed the cooling reception as well, because he’s kicked his Standing Room Only album to the curb after only one single (heck, the Poet’s Resumé EP came out just three months after the album) and is now bringing radio a new single called “One Bad Habit.” It’s the sort of song that uniquely aggravates me because it combines a self-awareness of the narrator’s problems with a lazy, uncaring attitude that doesn’t plan to do anything about them, and with its poor framing and execution, this is a less-than-stellar addition to McGraw’s own resumé.\n\nThe production here is a pretty bad fit for this song on all sorts of levels. There are no surprises in the arrangement: You’ve got your guitars, your drums, your keyboards, a steel guitar whose primary goal is to legalize the song’s use of the ‘country’ metadata tag on Spotify (to the song’s credit, it at least gets a fair bit of airtime, but it fades into the background over time as the guitars crank up the volume, and it doesn’t feel like it adds much to the sound or influences its direction), and that’s pretty much it. (Something that sounds like a string section jumps in on the first chorus, but there’s no credit for it on the YouTube video, so it may just be a soundalike synthesizer.) What really bothers me, however, is the tone of the mix: The instrument tones are neutral at best and bright at worst, and with its prominent beat and guitar solo, the overall atmosphere feels celebratory and borderline-inspirational, as if the narrator is thanking their lucky stars for getting away with what sounds like a pretty dysfunctional relationship. This doesn’t strike me a situation worth celebrating, and the fact that the sound tries to make this mess into an anthemic, arena-ready tale really rubs me the wrong way. Even if you’re stuck within the constraints of a restrictive meta, you should be able to put together a better mix than this mess.\n\nAs for McGraw, he sounds pretty comfortable delivering his lines here, and I think that’s the biggest problem I have with him. The song is not technically demanding by any stretch of the imagination, but it requires a heavy lift from the artist on the charisma side because of the song’s lyrical deficiencies (we’ll get into these a lot more a bit later). It’s all on the artist’s performance to show that the speaker not only understands the bad/awkward situation that they’ve put their partner in, but that they’re not taking advantage of their partner’s feelings, and that they at least aspire to eventually be a better version of themselves for the other person (even if they may never get there). Unfortunately, we don’t get any of that from McGraw, who just sounds happy that he hasn’t been called out or punished for his behavior, and doesn’t seem motivated at all to try to make things better. It’s not a good look for a guy who should know better than this, and it leaves this entire track in a real bind.\n\nAll right, let’s figure out just what makes the writing so darn bad here. The narrator self-identifies as your typical country bad boy who drinks too much, stays out all night, and generally makes life hard on their partner, who is supposedly the perfect person save for their taste in significant others. We’ve gotten lots of these kind of songs over the years (the Outlaw movement in particular was known for talking about the women who stuck with the singer despite their antics), so what makes this one so bad? I have two major issues with it:\n\nThe song is very open about how the narrator’s bad habits are negatively impacting the relationship (the speaker openly admits “I couldn’t blame her if she wanted to [leave]”), which is great, but knowing that there’s a problem and actually doing something about it are two very different things. Usually with songs like this, there’s a sense of improvement on the part of the narrator: Either they want to be a better person to hold up their end of the relationship bargain, or the partner is somehow ‘saving’ the narrator with their presence and love (often with a heavy dose of religious imagery thrown in). There’s nothing like that here: The speaker is happy/relieved about the fact that they haven’t been dumped, and plans to keep pressing their luck and “hope she never breaks [the habit]”. Heck, we don’t get any idea at all about how the partner feels about all this; their perspective is considered unimportant and ignored. I get some serious flashbacks to Adam Craig’s awful “Just A Phase,” and that doesn’t make me happy.\n\nI’m also really bothered by the way the relationship is framed as an “addiction,” all the way to the “one bad habit” title/hook (which is honestly pretty weak anyway). Someone who’s addicted to drugs, alcohol, or smoking doesn’t perform these behaviors because they want to—they do it because they have to, despite the significant damage and negative consequences that arise. If you’re telling me that your partner is addicted to you, you’re admitting that you’re bad for them and that this relationship will eventually lead them to intense pain and suffering…and if you’re saying that and then telling me you’re just going to let things ride and take advantage of the situation, you’re not saying much for your character or your likeability. (Statements like “She could put me down like a cigarette if she wanted to” are also laughably absurd, because if it’s truly an addiction, giving it up is never that simple or easy.)\n\nIt’s this combination of knowing this a bad situation for the other person, knowing that they are powerless to break away from it, and doing nothing to change it themselves that really irritates me, because if you wouldn’t do everything you could to get your partner to stop performing a self-destructive act, I question whether you have any feelings for them at all.\n\n“One Bad Habit” is a misguided track that’s missing some key ingredients (especially empathy) that has made similar tracks work in the past, and as a result it’s not that interesting or pleasant to listen to. With its ill-fitting production, self-centered lyrics, and a just-kind-of-here performance from Tim McGraw, this is a song that tells its story in the worst way imaginable, and doesn’t give us a reason to form an emotional attachment to the characters. It’s a notable misstep from an artist who can’t afford to make too many of them at this stage of their career, because the radio is not addicted to McGraw anymore, and they will let him go in a heartbeat if they aren’t impressed.\n\nRating: 4/10. Hard pass."
