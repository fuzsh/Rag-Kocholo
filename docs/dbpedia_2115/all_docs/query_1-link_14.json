        "text": "Hey LinkedIn fam! I wanted to take some time and tell you all about the great experience I had this week at #Afrotech! This was my first time ever attending a conference like this and it has been one of the greatest decisions I’ve made this year. It was so inspiring connecting with people who looked like me and have shared experiences of navigating corporate America. I really enjoyed networking with people who genuinely wanted to uplift, advise, and extend opportunities and knowledge to other black professionals. Some of my favorite moments of the conference were: 1. Stopping by the National Basketball Association (NBA) booth and getting to take a picture with the Larry O’Brien Trophy. I’m hoping the Houston Rockets can win the championship in a few years and maybe I’ll get the chance to recreate this picture haha 2. Getting to support my sister Brittany Ohalete at the CareFreeBlack Girl Afrotech Cookout where she was selling pieces of her brand and original artwork. To say the event was a success for her would be an understatement. She had one of the biggest selling days of her creative journey thus far. I’m really proud of her for pursuing her creative interest and hobbies outside of the corporate space and look forward to watching this next chapter in her life. 3. Getting to see some of my fellow brothers Mikos Adams, George Okpamen, PharmD, MBAc , and Atarhe Clarke of the Eta Mu Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and connecting with other members of the NPHC. There were so many NPHC members at the conference and I really enjoyed meeting a lot of y’all and glad everyone is doing well! 4. And last but not least, I had a GREAT enriching and positive conversation with Kwesi Robertson at the Synchrony mixer on Wednesday about our journeys navigating corporate America as black men and the different mental health obstacles that brings, how we go about the journey of overcoming them, and applying what we’ve learned to create healthy boundaries for ourselves in the workplace. It was my favorite conversation of the conference and I really appreciate him for not only taking that time to speak power to me, but also using his experiences to make sure he’s a better leader in the workplace for his team and giving them the leader many of us didn’t have when we first started our careers. While it is true that hurt people tend to hurt people, there are people who utilize empathy and emotional intelligence and make sure they’re not continuing the cycle of hurt people hurting people. Your first few managers can really determine the trajectory of your career and not everyone is lucky enough to not land a toxic manager, so kudos to you for doing the work! I really enjoyed AFROTECH and I’m so glad I made the decision to drive down 2 hours to attend. Thank you for creating a space like this for us, I definitely will be attending again!"
