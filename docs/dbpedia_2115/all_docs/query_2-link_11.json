        "text": "Looking for Kyle, the Fractures character?\n\nKyle Pfeiffer (born June 9, 1990), known professionally as Blacklite District, is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, rapper, and record producer from the Black Hills of South Dakota. Blacklite District's sound relies heavily on the influence of hip hop, pop, and classic hard rock. He occasionally collaborates with Filipino animator Rainimator on his Minecraft animated Music Video Series, starting from mid-2017.\n\nBiography[]\n\nKyle began writing music as a way to cope after the death of his mother, Tina Pfeiffer, on May 3, 1999.\n\nBlacklite District rose to international YouTube fame in 2018 with the release of his song \"Cold As Ice\", which ended up getting 100 million streams and hit #35 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart. He followed it up with a string of other viral hits, including \"The Struggle\", \"Just So You Know\", and \"Goodbye\". Combined, he has gotten over 300 million streams globally across YouTube and Spotify, and was awarded YouTube's Sliver Creator Award in November 2019 for passing 100,000 subscribers on his channel as of January 28, 2020.\n\nOn June 9, 2020, Blacklite District rereleased the animated video for his single \"Falling\", which peaked at #3 on YouTube's trending chart, and got 1.5 million streams in its first three days of release. The song went Top 30 in South Africa and Turkey.\n\nBlacklite District has released multiple independent projects over the years, with his official debut album, You're Welcome, planned for release on July 17th, 2020 through his own AK19 Entertainment, LLC label. \"Over This\" was released as the first official single from the album on January 24, 2020, followed up by \"Falling\" on February 21, \"Wishing Dead\" on April 3 and \"Go Home\" on May 14 as the second, third and fourth singles respectively. It has been confirmed that Pfeiffer will release singles from the album consistently throughout early 2020 leading up to the album.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nWhile the name Blacklite District started as a band, Pfeiffer decided to use it as his official stage name after his song \"Cold As Ice\" went viral on YouTube. In an interview, Pfeiffer stated that many \"fans thought that it was my name as a solo artist, so I just went with it.\"\n\nPfeiffer is known for his wide range of music styles and genres in his music. He grew up on hard rock acts such as Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, Mötley Crüe, and Guns N' Roses. He later got into newer acts at the time like Avenged Sevenfold and Linkin Park. In later years, he got into new age rap music and cites artists like Juice WRLD, Post Malone, and XXXTentacion as influences on his sound."
