        "text": "Some companies have been financially struggling significantly lately, and the challenges have been too much for huge retail chains like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Tuesday Morning, The Body Shop and Christmas Tree Shops, which all declared bankruptcy and closed their stores. Well other types of retailers aren't immune from that fate, and national upscale grocery store Foxtrot and Dom's Kitchen & Market this week filed for bankruptcy and suddenly closed all of their locations.\n\nThe chain, which was geared toward urban consumers and sold everything from freshly made sandwiches and baked goods to organic wine, surprised customers on Tuesday by closing all of their stores. The company announced the news to corporate employees on a conference call that morning, revealing that all 33 locations across the U.S. would shutter at noon.\n\nFollowing the news, the immediate closures were rather hectic. One witness wrote on X, \"All Foxtrot coffee shops in Dallas closed mid-morning while customers were still inside. If this sounds bananas, it is.\" Another revealed that employees at a store in Washington D.C. were giving out free bottles of wine."
