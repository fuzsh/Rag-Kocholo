        "text": "In the bohemian pocket of Ocean Beach, Kyle Rising, the 27-year-old lead singer of rock/reggae group Sensi Trails, uploads a video performing a solo cover of the legendary The Doors song âPeople Are Strange.â Almost overnight, it receives 11 million views. Thousands of comments label Rising the reincarnation of The Doors frontman Jim Morrison.\n\nIn the video, Risingâs voice is musically synonymous with the late icon of â60s psychedelic rock. But Risingâs vintage clothes and shaggy hairstyle echo the aesthetics of Morrisonâs heyday as well. With both the look and voice combined, he was bound to go viral.\n\nâIt was a huge catapult into this new sort of brand that has essentially always been there,â Rising says. âBut itâs now coming to the surface.â\n\nThe video brought in followers and fans across age groups. Whether it was a social media algorithm or a community built from a love of rock music, Rising found his platform growing exponentially. This new audience nudged him toward new music and a new sound.\n\nBorn and raised on the East Coast, Rising migrated to San Diego five years ago in his van, drawn by the cityâs connections to reggae music. Heâs now working to weave his various inspirations into a solo album while also playing shows with Sensi Trails. And, of course, heâs continuing to build his social media\n\nfame by leaning into the vintage-inspired image that launched his stardom.\n\nDuring their set at a Music Box summer show this year, Sensi Trails transformed the venue into a time machine, taking the crowd to the late â60s. Flared leather pants, heeled boots, funky patterns, and screens with neon psychedelic graphics swaying behind the band helped them channel midcentury rock counterculture.\n\nâIt was something that I wish I had. I wish I couldâve seen these artists from back in the day,â Rising says. âSo I want to sort of recreate it for people nowadays to have.â\n\nWith his debut solo single, âShe Freaks Me Out,â Rising continues to connect with people both on-and off-screen through his timeless talents and the power of nostalgia.\n\nIn fact, his ode to a foundational era in rock music has made him popular not only with his broadening audience, but with his own idols."
