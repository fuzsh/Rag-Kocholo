        "text": "Sampling both Funkadelic and ’70s British prog rock band Gentle Giant, the opening track to “Utopia” is one of the few tracks that Scott isn’t joined by a featured artist. Scott is also the sole producer on the record but it does credit a long list of songwriters. The track is written by: Scott, Andy Votel, Derek Shulman, Ebony Oshunrinde, Edward Hazel, George Clinton, Kerry Minnear, Mike Dean, Noah Goldstein and Ray Shulman.\n\n‘Thank God’ features performances from Kenyan-American artist KayCyy and American rapper Teezo Touchdown. The track additionally includes a line from a young child, presumably Scott and Kylie Jenner’s daughter Stormi, who says “That’s right, daddy” after Scott sings: “The storms are minor but you know she’s living major.”\n\nThe track is produced by Scott, Kanye West, Allen Ritter, BoogzDaBeast, WondaGurl and FNZ. It’s written by KayCyy, Allen Ritter, Ebony Oshunrinde, Isaac Boni, Jahmal Gwin, Kanye West and Michael Mule.\n\nThe first slowed-down track to appear on “Utopia” features melodic crooner Sampha and Bon Iver (aka Justin Vernon, who also appears in the production credits). It was written by Scott, Sampha and Bon Iver along with Buddy Ross (who worked on Frank Ocean’s “Blonde” and “Endless”), Dua, Ebony Oshunrinde, Vegyn and Wesley Glass. It was produced by Scott, Bon Iver, Wheezy, WondaGurl, Vegyn and Buddy Ross.\n\nScott reunites with Drake on ‘Meltdown,’ the seventh track on the album, and is their fourth collaboration behind “Pussy and Millions,” which appeared on Drake and 21 Savage’s collaborative album “Her Loss” last year. The track was produced by Coleman, BNYX, Boi-1da, Vinylz and Tay Keith. It was written by Drake, Scott, Vinylz, BNYX and Boi-1da.\n\n‘Delresto (Echoes)’ once again features Bon Iver, this time alongside Beyoncé. Although they don’t appear on streaming credits, Hit-Boy and umru are both credited as the song’s producers alongside Scott. The track was written by Scott, Allen Ritter, Beyoncé, Hit-Boy, James Blake and Mike Dean.\n\nScott is the sole performer on ‘I Know?’ and is both a songwriter and producer. The track was also written by Buddy Ross, Kobe Hood, Ozan Yidlrim, aka OZ,(who also produced Scott and Drake’s ‘Sicko Mode’) and Scotty Coleman. OZ and Coleman are also credited as producers.\n\nRapper Westside Gunn and James Blake are featured artists on “Lost Forever,” where Blake’s lulled vocals introduce the track and Gunn kicks it up. The song was produced by Scott, Dominic Maker, Blake and the Alchemist. The Alchemist and Scott are also credited as songwriters alongside Gunn, Blake, Douglas Ford and Elliot Baker.\n\nBad Bunny and the Weeknd join Scott over a Latin-influenced drumbeat on ‘K Pop,’ the first and only single off ‘Utopia.’ It was produced by BNYX, Boi-1da, Jahaan Sweet and the Weeknd collaborator Illangelo. It was written by all three performers along with BNYX, Boi-1da, Jahaan Sweet, Bigram John Zayas and Carlo Montagnese.\n\nSignaling the end of “Utopia” is ‘Telekinesis,’ clocking in at nearly six minutes with features from SZA and Future. It also boasts the longest list of songwriters on the tracklist: Scott, SZA, Future, Edgar Nabeyin Panford (who was nominated for album of the year for his work on Kanye West’s ‘Donda’), Jahaan Sweet, Jahmal Gwin, Kanye West, Nima and Paimon Jahanbin, along with Detroit-based soul and folk artist Victory Boyd. It was produced by Scott and BoogzDaBeast."
