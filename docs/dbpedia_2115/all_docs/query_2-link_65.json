        "text": "Who is Morgan Wade? Well, the up-and-coming country singer has caught the attention of music fans, including The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Kyle Richards.\n\nRead on to find out more about the 28-year-old singer-songwriter.\n\nMorgan Wade's Music Career\n\nMorgan Wade grew up in Virginia and worked on her music during college. Following the release of Puppets with My Heart back in 2018 independently, Morgan released her debut album, Reckless, in 2021 through the Thirty Tigers/now Sony Music Nashville label, and then in 2023 dropped her sophomore release, Psychopath.\n\n“I realized the more authentic you are and the more you pour yourself into your songs, and most importantly if you’re being honest, people will connect to that,” she said about her music, according to her website. “I want every song to get the credit it deserves.”\n\nMorgan has also toured extensively, including tour dates lined up through October 2023 and beyond. \"Thank you all for making this such a fantastic year,\" she said about her time on the road playing for fans.\n\nIn 2022, she was nominated for Emerging Act of the Year at the Americana Music Honors & Awards. She was also nominated for New Female Artist of the Year at the 2023 Academy of Country Music Awards.\n\nHow did Kyle Richards and Morgan Wade become friends?\n\n“I heard Morgan on the radio — I heard ‘Wilder Days,’” Kyle previously said about becoming a fast fan of Morgan's music. “And then I went to all of the others. And I was like, ‘Wow, this girl’s really blowing me away with her voice and the lyrics.’ And I looked her up on Instagram and I was like ‘Oh.’ I don’t know, the tattoos and everything, I wasn’t expecting all that. So I followed her and then I kept listening to her music on, like, repeat. And then she sent me a DM asking me why I was following her.”\n\n\"I just didn’t expect someone from Beverly Hills, ya know? My friends freaked out,\" Morgan added about becoming pals with Kyle.\n\nKyle Richards' Appearance in Morgan Wade's Music Video\n\nEarlier this year, Kyle starred alongside Morgan in her music video for her single, “Fall in Love with Me.\"\n\nIn an Instagram post released when the video premieres, Kyle and Morgan described the video as “campy and fun.\" Their joint Instagram post stated that it is “also important and representative of all kinds of love, even in the country space, in any space.”\n\n“[Kyle] and I trusted the process of making a piece of art that stands boldly beside this music,” the Instagram post continued, “and I’m proud of that.”\n\n“I’ve done several music videos, and every time there’s someone in it with me, [people] always assume we’re dating or something’s going on,” Morgan explained in the behind-the-scenes look at the making of the clip. “If you get on the internet, you see people are obsessed with us being friends and why we’re friends… [so] we thought it would be, you know, kinda a good idea to poke fun at that and kinda troll the trolls a little bit.”\n\n“If they’re gonna talk,” Kyle added, “you might as well give them something to talk about.”\n\nKyle Richards' Involvement in a Morgan Wade Documentary\n\n\"We were in Paris shooting the documentary that you guys probably heard about online,\" Kyle said during a Amazon Live (according to E! News) in September 2023. \"There's just so many things out there online. I'm like, 'Why do people just make things up, invent things about the trip?' They see that there's a camera there, and they completely ignore that there's a camera there and act like we were I don't even know what. I'm like, 'There were cameras there! Just get your act together.' But yes, it was a great shoot.\"\n\nKyle went on to add that the trip to Paris documented the European leg of Morgan's tour: \"It was all great. It was just a fun, fun girls trip.\"\n\nIn addition to hanging out in Paris, Kyle and Morgan also met up in Aspen when the singer was playing a show. “Best time with the best people,\" Kyle said about the trip.\n\nMorgan Wade's cameo in the RHOBH Season 13 trailer\n\nNext up for Kyle, in addition to the Morgan documentary, you can catch her in Season 13 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. More details on the new season below which will give viewers insight into Kyle and Morgan's friendship (check out the trailer above)!\n\nWhen does RHOBH Season 13 premiere?\n\nKyle and fellow returning cast members Dorit Kemsley, Garcelle Beauvais, Crystal Kung Minkoff, Erika Jayne, and Sutton Stracke will be back on our screens and welcoming newbie Annemarie Wiley will make her RHOBH debut when Season 13 premieres on October 25 at 8 p.m. ET/PT."
