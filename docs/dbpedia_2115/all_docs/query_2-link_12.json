        "text": "…Seriously?\n\nA serious question for you: Has country music lost confidence in itself? Does it think that it can’t come up with a novel song, sound, or story on its own anymore, and that it has to lean on popular music of the past, regardless of the genre, as a crutch to produce a palatable product for the populace? Because that’s the sense that I’m getting, and while it was limited to a line or a riff or even an overall theme before, now artists are producing cheap parodies of past hits that aren’t funny or interesting in the least, parodies that only serve to highlight the lack of talent and creativity of those involved.\n\nThe latest example of this farcical movement is “Chevrolet,” which rips off and repurposes Dobie Gray’s 1973 hit “Drift Away” for a buzzword-filled nothingburger telling the same old picking-up-a-country-girl story that you’ve heard a hundred times before. That Dustin Lynch would be involved in an effort like this is not surprising: His career has been fading for a while now (“Party Mode” stalled at #17 in 2022, and “Stars Like Confetti” spent ten months on the charts in 2023 just to settle for being a Mediabase-only #1), and the trick has been a common one lately amongst artists on the margins who want to reverse their fortunes (see: Jake Owen’s “On The Boat Again”). Seeing Jelly Roll here is a bit of a surprise given how well he’s been doing the last few years, but pairing a weaker artist with a stronger one to prop up the former is another trick Music City is pretty fond of, such as with Riley Green & Luke Combs’s “Different ‘Round Here.” Big names aren’t enough to salvage this drivel, however, and we’re left opening 2024 with an early contender for the worst song of the year.\n\nOn some level, I’m kind of amazed at how the producer on this track has managed to make the production less interesting than the original. Both arrangements are fairly simple, but the slick electric guitar, string section, and light-touch percussion of Gray’s song give the song a smooth flow and a breezy feel that truly invites the listener to “drift away.” In contrast, Lynch’s song features sharper, louder drums and a textured acoustic guitar that don’t let the song go down as easy, and the instrument tones create a fairly neutral atmosphere that doesn’t feel romantic in the slightest. The bar crowd noises in the background make the song feel even rougher and more unpolished, and while there’s a dobro here, its potential is completely wasted, as its own tone isn’t different enough from the acoustic guitar to stand out or add anything to the track (unlike Gray, who somehow got their hands on a 90s-era neotradtional electric axe to flavor the chorus riffs). In the end, this comes across as a bland mix that could have been used to back any song of any type, and it contains none of the seasoning or synergy that the original sound provided for “Drift Away.” Its only purpose is you remind you that you could be listening to a much better track instead.\n\nI opened my “Stars Like Confetti” assessment of Lynch like this: “As far as Lynch goes, could somebody check this man for a pulse? The man has all the charm and charisma of a hat stand, and he struggles to inject any sort of feeling or emotion into his lines…and he’s only able to muster up a slight volume increase when he tries to ramp up the intensity on the chorus.” Unfortunately, the same could be said for his performance here: His voice follows the flow of the “Drift Away” sound rather than reflecting what he’s actually talking about, and he has so little credibility (and sounds so slimy) that when he talks about meeting this supposedly-perfect country girl in an urban setting, you simply don’t believe him. (He’s like an annoying co-worker who’s forever telling tall tales about their exploits, one who makes you roll your eyes with each story and reply “Yeah, sure.”) As far as Jelly Roll goes, his inclusion on the track is more of a business decision than an artistic one, and he sounds like he’s only here for the paycheck: His flow is rough and keeps falling behind the beat, and there’s absolutely zero feeling behind it. (The pair’s voices don’t pair particularly well either, and while both artists have some decent vocal chemistry with background vocalist Madeline Merlo, they don’t have a whole lot with each other.) It’s yet another example of Lynch’s off-putting (lack of) personality, and a checked-out Jelly Roll just makes the song feel even more meaningless than it already is.\n\nFun fact: It only took one songwriter (Mentor Williams) to write “Drift Away,” but three to put together this empty shell of a parody (Williams is also given writer credits on this track). Plagiarizing Williams’s lyrical structure is bad enough by itself, but to do it to tell a story this generic and sketchy is an absolute travesty. The narrator has stumbled across a countrified partner in some sort of metropolitan setting who wants to escape, and the chorus throws all the required buzzwords and topics together (six packs, dirt roads, Brooks & Dunn name drops, the nighttime cruising, and of course the “Chevrolet”) into a word salad that has all the charm and wit of refrigerator-magnet poetry. The speaker displays no redeeming qualities, the hook is neither clever nor memorable (and probably had its naming rights sold like a football stadium), and the writing can feel rough at points as the writers try to force ideas to fit in the “Drift Away” template. Turning a 70s classic into a reheated leftover from the Metro-Bro era just makes my blood boil, and anyone who was actively involved in writing this garbage should be permanently banned from ever writing a song again, since it’s pretty obvious that they have no ideas of their own to offer.\n\n“Chevrolet” needs to be hauled to the nearest junkyard and left to rot, as a warning to anyone who dares to cynically co-opt an existing hit to line their own pockets. From ill-fitting production to vapid, generic lyrics to unimpressive vocals from both Dustin Lynch and Jelly Roll, this song serves no purpose aside from reminding us all of a better song that we’d rather be listening to. If you really want to honor an older artist and/or cash in on a familiar riff or sound, then just sing the original freaking song! Don’t try to shoehorn a new story into an old framework just to fit the current radio meta and line your own pockets, because you’ll just make yourself and everyone involved look like mercenary morons. Either sing your own song or sing someone else’s—don’t try to split the difference."
