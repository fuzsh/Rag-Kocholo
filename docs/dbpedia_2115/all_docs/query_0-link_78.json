        "text": "Today, country music duo Muscadine Bloodline have released a brand new single, “Tickets to Turnpike.” The single features Turnpiek Troubadours’ very own Kyle Nix on the fiddle. Their new album, The Coastal Plain, will be released on August 1th via Stancaster Music/Thirty Tigers.\n\nThe duo shared, “This song is special to us because we have always looked up to Turnpike Troubadours. Over the years we have been able to cross touring with them off our bucket list. It means a great deal to have Kyle Nix from Turnpike on the track as well. Seemed very fitting and makes it that much more special to us.”\n\nListen to “Tickets to Turnpike” below and pre-order The Coastal Plain here.\n\nThe Coastal Plain is the fourth full-length album from Muscadne Bloodline, produced by the band themselves alongside their long-time collaborator Ryan Youmans (known for his work with Jelly Roll, among others), and stands as the duo’s most authentic project to date. Drawing deeply from their personal histories, they craft narratives reminiscent of the people and landscapes of their southern Alabama upbringing. Containing 14 tracks, the album includes previously released singles such as “Mary Riley,” “Earle Byrd From Mexia,” “Weyerhaeuser Land,” “Low Hangin’ Fruit,” and “10-90,” all of which showcase a distinctive sound that weaves together influences from classic country, roots, and gospel — creating a rich tapestry of storytelling and musical heritage.\n\n“In a way this record feels like an ode to ourselves and the fact that we’ve finally found our sound, which is hopefully something that will end up inspiring other artists down the road. Our motto for the last few years has been, ‘Make what we love, and everything else will take care of itself.’ We just want to stay adventurous and keep evolving and keep elevating our game, and because of that the music is the strongest it’s ever been,” Muscadine Bloodline shares about The Coastal Plain.\n\nIn addition to the powerhouse vocals from Muncaster and Stanton (vocals, guitar), The Coastal Plain also features the duo’s longtime touring band—Justin Rowton (bass), Weston Stewart (guitar) and Zoltan Tobak (drummer).\n\nThe pair are road warriors and are currently on tour with multiple opportunities across the country to catch their high-energy live show. They will be performing headlining shows and renowned festivals this year like Windy City Smokeout, Under the Big Sky Festival, Greenville County Music Festival and more.
