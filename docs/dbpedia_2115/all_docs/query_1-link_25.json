        "text": "— Shane Thornton was set to leave Tuesday on a road trip, one he hopes will take him nearer his goal of becoming a successful singer/songwriter in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nThe young 25-year-old singer from Cabot, who is\n\nknown as “Big Shane,” was set to join Bobby Cutshaw\n\nand his band Common Ground the next day for about a\n\nmonth’s tour.\n\n“Our first show is Aug. 3 and 4 in North Dakota,”\n\nThornton said Friday during an interview at his moth\n\ner’s house just outside Cabot. “I will play bass [guitar] and sing a few songs. [Cutshaw] lets his musicians come out front and sing some lead. He likes to showcase his band members.” Information on Cutshaw’s website shows the band will\n\nplay at several venues in Wisconsin and Minnesota dur\n\ning August.\n\n“I’ll play with him for five or six weeks and then come\n\nback home for two weeks,” Thornton said. “If he keeps\n\nme, then I’ll go back on tour with him after that. If he\n\ndoesn’t keep me, I plan to move to Nashville permanently\n\nand work on my own career.” Thornton described Cutshaw as “hard-core country.\n\n“He’s sent me close to 100 songs to learn,” Thornton said. “I’ve still got a lot to learn.” Thornton has already released one compact disc,Big Shane Thornton: Runnin’ From the Best of Me, which was produced in 2011 by Jim Wallis of Maumelle and recorded in the Signature Recording Studio in Maumelle and the Raney Recording Studio in Damascus on the Oblivion Records label. Thornton wrote most of the songs on the CD; some were co-written with Wallis.\n\nSeveral radio stations in Arkansas, including KSSN 96 FM Homegrown Country Show in Little Rock and KWOZ 103-3 FM and KZLE 93.1 FM in Batesville, are playing Thornton’s CD. Fans can find the album at the Hastings Book and Music Store in Jacksonville and Batesville, and on iTunes and CD Baby.\n\nThornton grew up in Batesville and attended Cabot schools. He is the son of Debby and Danny Cullum of Cabot and the late Rickey Thornton.\n\nThornton said he has been earning money as a singer/ songwriter for about six years. Not only does he perform his own music, he does a variety of other artists’ music, “from Alan Jackson to Aaron Tippin to Billy Ray Cyrus before he was Miley’s dad,” Thornton said with a laugh.\n\nHe even does music by Prince and rock ’n’ roll greats from the ’60s.\n\n“I began vocally training him when he was 2,” said his mother, who is also a musician. “When he was 6 weeks old, I entered him in his first beauty pageant. I kept on entering him in pageants, waiting for the day when he would get to compete in talent.”\n\nAmong the titles the young Thornton would earn were Little Mr. USA, Little Mr. Arkansas and Little Mr. Universe.\n\n“I was a cute kid,” Thornton said with a grin. Among the talent competitions he would win was the Cabot Idol contest in 2005.\n\nThornton comes from a musically inclined family. Hisfather, who died in 2000, played music, and his mother was a backup singer and aspired to sing Patsy Cline’s songs. His stepfather plays music as well and has often been part of Big Shane’s band.\n\n“I wouldn’t be where I am today without him,” Thornton said of his stepfather. “My stepdad is my dad. I loved my real dad, and I love Danny.”\n\nThornton wrote his first song when he was 16. Titled “Please Don’t Take My Heart,” the song was recorded by Texas country singer Tim Cooper.\n\n“My stepdad was touring with Tim, and I got the opportunity to get on stage with him,” Thornton said.\n\nOver the years, Thornton has tried to make it into several national contests.\n\n“I tried out for American Idol in 2006 in San Antonio but didn’t make it,” he said. “Then two months later, I triedto make it on Nashville Star at Billy Bob’s in Fort Worth, Texas. I didn’t get that, either. I did songs that no one knew. It was my fault; it was poor song choices.”\n\nHe hopes to do better in Nashville.\n\n“I’m proud he’s moving to Nashville,” his mother said, adding that his stepfather is having “a real hard time” about Thornton’s move. “It’s something he should have done a long time ago.\n\n“Shane has a God-given talent. He can sing any genre of song and keep it in that genre. I feel like God has a plan for each of us. God is leading him in a different direction than appearing on American Idol. God says he is going to be all right.”\n\nThornton, who plays a variety of instruments, has made many appearances at local clubs throughout Arkansas and has performed for many benefits. At the end of each of his shows, Thornton, his mother and his stepdad sing three-part harmony.\n\nAmong the charities Thornton favors are cancer research, anything for kids and homeless shelters.\n\n“Something a lot of people don’t know about me is that I lived in homeless shelters with my mom when I was young,” Thornton said.\n\n“We had a real tough time when he was 6 until he was 8,” Debby said. “I was a single mom, working two jobs. I was laid off. We even lived in a car for a little while.”\n\nThornton said his ultimate goal is “to make my daddyproud … both of them.\n\n“And I want to buy my mom an $11 million house,” he said with a smile. “I want to perform, and I want to write.”\n\nHis latest song, “Just a Move,” is based on this trip to Nashville.\n\n“I made a deal with Mom,” Thornton said. “If music doesn’t work out for me, I promised her I would become a preacher. When I was a kid, I was at church every day - I mean every day.\n\n“I really love God. I love the idea of God. I love every aspect of God. I love everything he’s done for me. I didn’t have to wake up this morning, but I got to. And that’s enough for me.”"
