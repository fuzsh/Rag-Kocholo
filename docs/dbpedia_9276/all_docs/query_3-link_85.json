        "text": "How to Pay for Things in Albania: Card or Cash?\n\nAlbania is a beautiful country with a rich history, culture, and nature. It is also a very affordable destination for travelers who want to explore a hidden gem in Europe. But before you pack your bags and book your flight, you might be wondering how to pay for things in Albania. Do you need to carry cash or can you use your card? What is the currency and how can you exchange it? Is it safe to carry cash in Albania? In this article, we will answer all these questions and more, so you can enjoy your trip without any hassle.\n\nThe Currency of Albania\n\nThe official currency of Albania is the **lek** (plural lekë), which is divided into 100 qindarka (singular qindarkë). The lek is abbreviated as ALL or L. The exchange rate as of January 2024 is about **1 EUR = 103,5 ALL** or **1 USD = 95.1 ALL**.\n\nUsually the locals use this website to check the currency exchange rate: HERE\n\nThe lek comes in banknotes of 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 lekë, and coins of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 lekë. The banknotes feature prominent Albanian figures and landmarks, while the coins feature the double-headed eagle, the national symbol of Albania.\n\nHow to Exchange Money in Albania\n\nIf you need to exchange your foreign currency to lek, you have several options in Albania. The most common and convenient way is to use one of the many **exchange offices** (këmbim valutor) that are located all over the country, especially in major cities and tourist areas. These exchange offices usually offer better rates (similar to the website that we have posted here) and no commissions, and they accept most major currencies, such as euro, dollar, pound, etc. Some of them are open 24/7, while others have regular working hours. You can easily spot them by their signs that display the exchange rates. Before you exchange your money, make sure to ask the staff if they charge any commission or fee, and count your money carefully.\n\nAnother option is to use an **ATM** (bankomat) to withdraw lek from your debit or credit card. There are many ATMs in Albania, especially in urban areas, and they usually accept Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, and Cirrus cards. However, you might have to pay some fees, such as withdrawal fee, conversion fee, or foreign transaction fee, depending on your bank and card provider. You should also check the daily withdrawal limit and the exchange rate offered by the ATM. Some ATMs might offer you to choose between local currency or your home currency, in which case you should always choose local currency, as it will give you a better rate.\n\nA third option is to use a **bank** (bankë) to exchange your money or withdraw lek from your card. There are many banks in Albania, such as Raiffeisen Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank, Tirana Bank, etc. They usually offer a lower exchange rate and charge a higher commission than exchange offices, but they might be more reliable and secure. You will need to show your passport or ID card to exchange your money or use your card at a bank. The banks are usually open from Monday to Friday, from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm, and some of them are also open on Saturday, from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm.\n\nHow to Pay for Things in Albania: Card or Cash?\n\nNow that you know how to get lek, you might be wondering how to pay for things in Albania. The answer is that you can use both card and cash, depending on the situation.\n\nIn general, you can use your card in about 80% of places in Albania, such as hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, shops, museums, etc. However, in some places where you need to pay small amounts of money, such as street vendors, taxis, buses, etc., you will have to use cash. Therefore, it is advisable to always carry some cash with you, just in case.\n\nWhen you use your card, you might be asked to choose between local currency or your home currency, in which case you should always choose local currency, as it will give you a better rate. You might also have to pay some fees, such as conversion fee or foreign transaction fee, depending on your bank and card provider. You should also check the daily spending limit and the exchange rate offered by your card. You should also keep your receipts and check your statements regularly for any errors or frauds.\n\nWhen you use cash, you should be aware of the denominations and the value of the lek. You should also try to have some small change with you, as some places might not have enough change for large bills.\n\nIs It Safe to Carry Cash in Albania?\n\nOne of the common concerns that travelers have is the safety of carrying cash in Albania. The good news is that Albania is a very safe country for tourists, and it has one of the lowest crime rates in the world related to tourists. You are unlikely to encounter any serious problems, such as robbery, theft, or violence, while traveling in Albania. However, as in any other country, you should still take some precautions to avoid any unpleasant situations.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe hope that this article has answered your questions about how to pay for things in Albania. As you can see, you can use both card and cash in Albania, depending on the situation. You can also exchange your money easily and safely in Albania, using exchange offices, ATMs, or banks.
