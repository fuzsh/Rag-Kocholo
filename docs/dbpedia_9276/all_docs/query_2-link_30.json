Then here are some helpful facts about cash and card payments in Albania.\n\nWhere can I buy Albanian leke?\n\nThe Albanian lek is a minor currency.

We offer a hassle-free online ordering process with the added benefit of free delivery for orders over £750.\n\nShould I exchange money before I travel to Albania?\n\nYes! If your next adventure takes you to Albania, having some leke on hand before you travel is a great idea.\n\nYou can exchange currency once you’re there. However, having some Albanian money on hand when you arrive is convenient for expenses like transportation or a quick snack.\n\nCan you swap GBP to lek in Albania?\n\nYes. Swapping your GBP to lek in Albania is definitely doable. However, the availability of GBP-to-lek exchange services could be limited or have higher fees, especially outside major cities or tourist areas.\n\nHelpful tip: To avoid high fees, having some local currency on hand before travelling is a smart idea. This will add some peace of mind as soon as you touch down in Albania.\n\nIs Albanian lek a closed currency?\n\nThe Albanian lek (ALL) isn’t considered a fully “closed” currency.

You can use Euros in Albania, especially in touristy areas.

In Albania, using cash is a smart choice. While card works well in many places, having some Albanian lek in your pocket is super useful for local markets and smaller spots.\n\nMany local shops, smaller supermarkets, and taxis only accept cash or local cards. Street vendors only accept cash.\n\nIs it better to use cash or credit card in Albania?\n\nHaving a mix of cash and credit cards when visiting Albania is a good idea.\n\nCard payments are common in many places, which offers convenience.

The food scene is quite impressive, relying on organic and fresh ingredients.\n\nYou can enjoy a coffee at a cozy local cafe for around 140 leke, roughly £1.10.\n\nA meal in a mid-range restaurant will set you back between 1,400 – 2,00 ALL, around £11 – £16.\n\nFor a special treat, if you’re in Tirana, the capital city, indulging in a meal at a fancy fish restaurant might be around 3,500 ALL, approximately £27.\n\nAlbania truly shines when it’s about treating your taste buds and being kind to your wallet.
