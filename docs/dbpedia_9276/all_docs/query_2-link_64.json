        "text": "This static currency converter provides the European Commission’s official monthly accounting rate for the euro and the conversion rates as established by the Accounting Officer of the European Commission in line with article 19 of the Financial Regulation.\n\nThese rates are used to calculate amounts for the reimbursement of expenses, travel or subsistence costs for external people participating in meetings, interviews etc. at the request of the European Commission.\n\nThe converter also allows general users to get monthly currency conversion rates, from the current month back to 1994.\n\nThe rates indicated are the market rates for the second to last day of the previous month as quoted by the European Central Bank or, depending on availability, provided by the delegations or other appropriate sources close to that date.\n\nInforEuro provides rates for current and old currencies for countries both inside and outside the European Union. For each currency, the converter provides the historic rates of conversion against the euro (or, until December 1998, against the ecu). These exchange rates are available in electronic format from March 1994 in the form of downloadable files.\n\nThe information on this page is strictly informative in nature and intended only for the purpose of the implementation of the EU budget. No warranty of accuracy can be given and the European Commission shall not assume any responsibility in connection with the rates published. This publication does not give users any rights and any inquiries from the general public will be disregarded.\n\nContact us for further information: tresorerieec [dot] europa [dot] eu (tresorerie[at]ec[dot]europa[dot]eu)"
