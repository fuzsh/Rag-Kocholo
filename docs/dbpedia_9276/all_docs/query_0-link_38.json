        "text": "Description\n\nThe lek is the official currency of Albania. The official currency symbol: L. The currency’s name is derived from Alexander the Great, whose name is shortened to Leka in the Albanian language.\n\nTwo lek banknotes have been issued in Albania. The first lek was introduced in 1926. The National Bank of Albania (Banka Kombëtare e Shqipnis) issued notes in denominations of 1, 5, 20 and 100 franka ari, followed by 2, 5 and 10 lekë and 100 franga in 1944. In 1945, the People’s Bank of Albania (Banka e Shtetit Shqiptar) made overprints on 10 lek, 20 lek and 100 frangas banknotes of the National Bank. Regular notes in the values of 1, 5, 20, 100, and 500 franga were also issued in 1945. The lek was chosen as the primary currency unit in 1947, with notes printed in 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 lek denominations.\n\nThe second lek was introduced in 1965 by the Banka e Shtetit Shqiptar in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 lekë. In 1976, the second series of banknotes was issued after the country changed its name to the People’s Socialist Republic. The third series of banknotes were issued in 1997, which introduced the 2000 lekë denomination. In 2019, the Bank of Albania issued a new series which introduced the 200, 5,000 and 10,000 lekë.\n\nThe 1000 Albanian lekë note front design features the portrait of Pjetër Bogdani (1625 – 1689), was a writer and clergyman who is a prominent figure of old Albanian literature. He is author of the “Çeta e profetëve” (Cuneus prophetarum). The portrait is presented against a background with a symbol of the sun, which was used in Bogdani’s work, and the croquis of the black two-headed eagle (element of the National Coat of Arms).\n\nThe reverse of the note illustrates a view of the Catholic gothic church of Vau and a stylized symbol of the sun. The lettering of the note is presented in the Albanian language. This note is part of the 2001 – 2011 series, and its color is green on a multicolor underprint.\n\nText: BANKA E SHQIPERISE, 1000 NJEMIJE LEKE, PJETER BOGDANI 1625-1689, BANK OF ALBANIA 1000"
