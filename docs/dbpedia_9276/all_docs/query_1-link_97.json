The official currency of Albania Lek was introduced into circulation in 1926, so almost 100 years ago it is divided into 100 qindarka, although currently they are not used in circulation and can only be found sporadically. The rate is not stable, so we recommend checking the current quotations frequently. The value of Lek is relatively low compared to the currencies of the main world economies, although in recent years the exchange rate has been quite stable - the exchange rate against the US dollar or euro changes depending on economic conditions as well as inflation and the monetary policy conducted by the Bank of Albania."
