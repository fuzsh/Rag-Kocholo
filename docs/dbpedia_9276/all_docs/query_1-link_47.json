        "text": "Albanian Lek - ALL\n\nOverview\n\nThe official currency of Albania is the Lek (ALL). The currency symbol for the Lek is L. The lek is divided into 100 qindarka; however, the qindarka is no longer produced. In 1947 the Lek was chosen as the main denomination. So far, four editions of the Lek have been printed by Albania.\n\nEconomy\n\nAlthough Albania is seen as a poor country, their economy is improving at a fast rate.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Albania showed 2.8% economical growth in the year 2009.\n\nAgriculture products are vegetables, fruit, grapes, dairy products, potatos, maize, wheat, and sugar beets.\n\nAlbania relies on the import of most goods and the country does not do much export.\n\nCurrently Albania&#8217;s economy is undergoing macroeconomic restructuring, which is led by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe tourism industry is booming and it is starting to contribute a huge amount to the country&#8217;s GDP.\n\nIn 2008, oil and gas were discovered in Albania, which are helping to improve the country&#8217;s economic status.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1926, the Lek was introduced by the Albanian King Ahmet Zoghu. Bronze, nickel, and silver coins were minted and distributed in denominations of 5 and 10 qindar.\n\nIn 1956, the Lek was redistributed and was available in denominations of 1 lek and 5 qindar, 10 qindar, 20 qindar, and 50 qindar.\n\nIn 1991, and 1992 the Lek was reintroduced with added denominations of 200, 500, and 1,000 Lek notes.\n\nIn 1997, a newly printed series of Lek banknotes were made available.\n\nSince 2002, there have been special issues of the Lek; for example, in 2005 the 50 Lek was designed for the 85th anniversary of the capital Tirana.\n\nGeneral Information"
