        "text": "Albanian Lek (ALL) is the official currency of Albania.\n\nIt is issued and managed by the Bank of Albania, the country’s central bank.\n\nThe lek is subdivided into 100 smaller units called qindarka, although qindarka coins are no longer in circulation due to their low value.\n\nThe lek was introduced in 1926, replacing the Albanian gold franc at par. Since then, the currency has undergone several changes and revaluations.\n\nThe current series of banknotes in circulation are in denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 lekë.\n\nCoins are available in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 lekë.\n\nThe value of the Albanian Lek has experienced fluctuations over time, affected by various factors, including political changes, economic conditions, and inflation."
