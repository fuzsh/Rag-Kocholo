        "text": "Albania has a different currency from the rest of Europe. Therefore, it is always good to prepare yourself before traveling. I travel to Albania regularly, and I always bring currency with me, so that I am prepared for my holidays in Albania.\n\nWhat is the best currency to take to Albania? The best currency to take to Albania is the euro. The Albanian currency is called LEK. However, you can only exchange LEK inside Albania. If you take euros in cash to Albania, you can exchange it at a currency exchange agency. Moreover, airport taxis and many hotels accept euros.\n\nThe Albanian currency is not available abroad. Moreover, many tourists are used to paying by card everywhere. However, in Albania the locals pay everything in cash. And since Albania is not a part of the European Union, you may pay extra for a card withdrawal.\n\nWhat currency do I need for Albania?\n\nFor your travel to Albania, the best currency to bring is the euro. Because many hotels quote their prices in Euros. And upon check-out, you can settle the bill with euros. Moreover, you can find currency exchange agencies on every street in the cities, so you can exchange the euros for Albanian LEK easily.\n\nHowever, if you do not have euro, then best alternatives are US dollars or pounds. Because euros, pounds or us dollars are easy to buy and sell in Albania. Avoid bringing rare currencies, like Polish Zloty, Swedish Krona or Macedonian Dinar, because these are difficult to sell in Albania and therefore more expensive to exchange.\n\nAlbania’s national currency is the LEK, but euros are widely accepted in touristic places. The taxi from the airport and your hotel will most likely quote their price in euros. Most hotels will allow you to settle the bill in euros or LEK, as you prefer.\n\nIn Albania, paying in cash is more popular than paying by card. In your country, you are probably used to paying by card. Maybe you don’t even carry cash, because you are used to contactless payments. However, this is different in Albania.\n\nThere are many local places in Albania, where you can only pay in cash. Although it is true that larger hotels, International shops or travel agencies will allow card payment. There are many small supermarkets, souvenir stores, beach shops and little bakeries, that only accept cash. In fact, Albanian people prefer to pay in cash for their purchases. You will see that the Albanian people always have a small wad of cash in their pocket.\n\nMoreover, many Albanian people carry foreign currencies in cash, like euros or pounds. Since many young Albanian people work abroad, they send foreign money home to their parents. Therefore, you can find a currency exchange agency of the corner of every street. So, if you have some cash euros, pounds or US dollars, you will easily be able to get some Albanian LEK, whenever you need it.\n\nIt is best to always carry some cash money with you in Albania. When you arrive, it is best to bring euros in cash. So that you can pay the taxi or the bus at the airport in cash. Once you arrive at your accommodation or hotel, you can ask them if you can pay with cash euros. Once you settle into your hotel, walk around the neighborhood to find a currency exchange agency. So that you can exchange some euros for LEK for your travels.\n\nIt is a good idea to exchange some of your foreign currency for Albanian LEK on the first day of your holiday. Some of the local shops, do not use a till. At the little shops along the road, you can only pay in cash. You will probably laugh, when they give you a handwritten receipt with your purchases.\n\nFor some touristic expenses, you will need cash LEK. Many castles and national parks in Albania charge their entry fee in cash LEK. Moreover, if you drive a car, you will need to settle some car parks in cash LEK as well. Be sure to carry some cash LEK, so that you can try the local foods, like Byrek pastry on your trip.\n\n*****INSIDER TIP****\n\nIn Albania, it is cheaper for foreigners to exchange cash money, than to withdrawing money from a cash machine. Therefore, you will save money, by bringing some cash foreign currency on your trip. Let me explain in more detail, in the paragraph below.\n\nCan you use credit cards in Albania?\n\nYou can use a credit card in Albania at ATM machines, in hotels, luxury restaurants and at international shops. However, paying by card in Albania can be quite expensive for foreigners. Therefore, you will save money if you bring foreign currency in cash.\n\nLet me explain why paying by card is expensive in Albania. Within the European Union, banks must clearly communicate their fees. Because the EU has a regulation that forces banks to inform the customer about their exchange rates and withdrawal fees.\n\nHowever, since Albania is not a part of the European Union, these transparency rules do not exist in Albania. Therefore, many Albanian banks have their own exchange rates and withdrawal fees. If you withdraw money, it may cost you €4 – €5 for every 100 euro you withdraw. The same applies when you pay by card somewhere.\n\nMoreover, not all the ATM machines will inform you clearly about their withdrawal fee. Some ATM machines will show their fees and ask you if you would like to continue with your transaction. However, some ATM machines do not inform you about their fees. So, you will only see these hidden fees, when you check your bank statement afterwards.\n\nNot all the Albanian banks have high fees. But unfortunately, because there are no transparency rules and regulations, you won’t know for sure until you check the balance on your bank account after the cash withdrawal.\n\nWhat type of money is used in Albania?\n\nThe money used in Albania is the Albanian LEK (ALL). The Albanian currency is only available within Albania. Therefore, it is smart to brings some cash euros, which you can exchange. Moreover, Euros are accepted in most hotels, airport taxis and travel agencies.\n\nAlbanian currency to euro\n\n1 euro = 125 LEK\n\nAlbania currency to USD\n\n1 US dollar = 110 LEK\n\nAlbanian currency to GBP\n\n1 pound = 140 LEK\n\nIt is smart to exchange some of your foreign currency into Albanian LEK, because you can get better prices in Albanian LEK. Moreover, many local places only accept Albanian LEK, for instance: local bakeries, beach shops, souvenir shops, parking places, castles and museums.\n\nThe Albanian currency are all very large amounts. There are notes of 100 LEK, 200 LEK, 500 LEK, 1000 LEK, 2000 LEK and 5000 LEK. Therefore, you will immediately feel very rich in Albania. However, 200 LEK only buys you a cup of coffee.\n\nMake sure that you spend your remaining Albanian LEK before you go home. Because you cannot exchange Albanian LEK abroad.\n\nWhere can I change Albanian currency?\n\nThe best place to change Albanian currency is in a currency exchange agency in Albania. Because you cannot change Albanian currency abroad.\n\nSince, you cannot change Albanian currency outside Albania, it is best to bring some foreign cash. So that you can exchange it in Albania. Make sure to bring some euros, pounds or US dollars for currency exchange. Do not worry about finding a currency exchange agency, because they are everywhere in the cities in Albania.\n\nThe Albanian LEK is a small currency, which is very difficult to exchange outside Albania. Therefore, exchange small amounts of cash at the time. And at the end of your holiday, either spend or exchange the remaining LEK before you leave.\n\nTips for currency exchange in Albania\n\nCurrency exchange is very cheap in Albania.
