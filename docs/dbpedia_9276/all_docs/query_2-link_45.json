        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to Albania - or planning to move there to live, work or study - you’ve got an exciting time ahead. As the Albanian Lek (ALL) is the official currency in Albania you’ll need to find convenient ways to spend in ALL while you’re there.\n\nThis guide walks through how to use the Wise card in Albania for convenient and secure transactions, and offers some handy hints about making your money go further when you’re abroad.\n\nCan I use the Wise card in Albania?\n\nIf you are a resident of Australia and have a Wise card - or if you’re thinking of getting one - you’re probably wondering: can I use my Wise card to pay for things in Albania?\n\nThe answer is yes, you can use the Wise card for everyday spending in Albania. You can use the card to pay for things in Albanian Leks with competitive exchange rates and low transaction fees. This guide walks through how you’ll be able to use your Wise card to help manage your travel spending.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wise card is not yet available for residents of Albania. You may find that Revolut is a better option for residents; check whether Revolut is available below.\n\nSee alternatives to Wise\n\nWhat happens if I move to Albania?\n\nYou can continue using your Wise card until it expires, but you will not be issued a new card as Wise does not offer the card in Albania. You may be able to continue using other Wise services, such as money transfers.\n\nYes. Access to ATMs shouldn’t be a problem during your stay in Albania.\n\nIt’s good to know that Albania is well developed and ATMs can be found in most towns and cities - you’ll only usually run into a problem if you’re heading somewhere really off the beaten path. If that’s the case, plan in advance and stock up on ALL from an ATM while you can.\n\nGenerally having and using a low cost ATM card when you’re in Albania is convenient, reliable and secure. You can take out cash little and often to avoid the need to carry too much at any one time, and spend with your card in stores and restaurants. Keep more than one way to pay in your pocket at any given time, so you’re prepared no matter what happens.\n\nThe Albanian Lek (ALL) is the official currency in Albania.\n\nYou can exchange your AUD before you leave Australia if you’d like - but bear in mind that you won’t be able to spend AUD in Albania. If you arrive with cash in your pocket you’ll need to exchange it locally, which may come with unexpected costs, and take time out of your trip unnecessarily.\n\nA better plan for lots of people is to get a travel card for spending in ALL while in Albania, with low costs and secure transactions."
