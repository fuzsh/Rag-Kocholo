        "text": "Movies may be an escape from reality for some, but they are also deep reflections of our culture and our inner lives as human beings.\n\nWhen we gather to watch a film, it’s a collective experience and one that can have a profound impact on our emotions and our thoughts. We can peer into other worlds, both real and imagined.\n\nCinema therapy uses this impact as a catalyst for healing. Clients watch a film with the intention of seeing themselves reflected. They may relate to the characters or find that their experience is quite different. This information can be brought to a therapy session and used to explore the client’s inner world.\n\nLet’s explore how this therapy works and what the benefits are, plus we’ll add a few suitable recommendations.\n\nBefore you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Positive Psychology Exercises for free. These science-based exercises explore fundamental aspects of positive psychology, including strengths, values, and self-compassion, and will give you tools to enhance the wellbeing of your clients, students, or employees.\n\nWhat Is Movie and Cinema Therapy?\n\nIn ancient Greece, the theater was used as a means of catharsis. It was believed that audiences would experience relief when they shared the emotions of the players. A catharsis or purging of emotion would result through this process of empathy, and audiences would leave the theater with a feeling of purification (Wu, 2008).\n\nFreud renewed the concept of catharsis with his theory that unearthing and releasing repressed emotions would lead to relief and eventual happiness (Wu, 2008).\n\nIn more modern times, therapists have used bibliotherapy in a similar fashion. The therapist suggests a book to the client that contains characters living through a similar experience. The client reads the book and discusses it with the therapist, using the story to gain insight into their own choices and thoughts.\n\nCinema therapy was developed as an offshoot of bibliotherapy and follows in the footsteps of these older practices using movies instead of theater or books.\n\nHow Does Cinema Therapy Work?\n\nThe therapist assigns a film to a client, choosing it specifically to reflect a core aspect of the client’s work.\n\nThe client watches the film independently and brings their input to the next session. This tool can also be used for couples and families (Dermer & Hutchings, 2000).\n\nBirgit Wolz (n.d.), PhD, MFT, is a psychotherapist who writes about cinema therapy and facilitates cinema therapy groups. She has identified five guidelines for choosing a film for your client.\n\nLaughter as medicine\n\nWolz (n.d.) suggests that films can be chosen as a way to laugh about and create distance from a problem a client may obsess over. Rather than a pure escape, it is an opportunity to find a fresh perspective.\n\nCrying for emotional catharsis\n\nSometimes we are going through a grieving process, but allowing ourselves to feel the emotions fully can be difficult. A movie may provide the emotional release needed.\n\nGaining hope and encouragement\n\nA movie may provide a hopeful and uplifting solution to the problem, providing the client with inspiration and optimism.\n\nQuestioning negative beliefs and rediscovering your strengths\n\nBy following a character through their ups and downs, a client may feel less alone and find that they also share the strengths that the character discovers.\n\nImproving communication\n\nCharacters often show where communication can break down. Choosing to watch a film with a partner, friend, or family member may create an opportunity to improve communication.\n\nAfter selecting and assigning the movie, the client moves into the observation stage. They are encouraged to watch the movie actively, noticing what they feel and think in the process. Researchers have presented four main stages that occur during the process of cinema therapy (Sacilotto et al., 2022).\n\nIdentification\n\nThe client identifies with the character because of their shared behavior and goals and notices the character’s feelings and emotions.\n\nCatharsis\n\nThe client may find that they learn through the character’s experiences.\n\nInsight\n\nThe client internalizes the character’s experience and develops a connection between their shared experience.\n\nUniversalization\n\nThe client no longer feels as alone because they see their own experience reflected.\n\nCulture should also be considered, and clinicians should choose movies where the clients will see their own culture and identities represented (Dunham & Dermer, 2020).\n\n3 Benefits of Using Movie Therapy\n\nWhile simply watching a movie will not necessarily create significant change, there is some clinical evidence that movies followed by a therapeutic session have beneficial outcomes (Egeci & Gencoz, 2017).\n\nOutcomes are improved when the clinician carefully considers a client’s preferences, goals, interests, and comprehension ability (Sacilotto et al., 2022).\n\nThe primary benefits of movie therapy are insight, catharsis, and feeling less alone. Clients relate to the characters in the films and understand themselves in new ways. And similar to the experience of connection found in group therapy, they feel they are not alone in what they are experiencing.\n\nDoes movie therapy help with depression?\n\nCase studies have shown that cinema therapy can be a beneficial tool in increasing optimism and decreasing hopelessness in individuals with depression. Movie therapy helped clients become more aware of the causes of their depression and aided in initiating change (Heston & Kottman, 1997; Powell, 2008).\n\nMovie therapy also has the potential to help individuals discover and develop their strengths (Niemiec, 2020). A therapist could have a client take a strengths survey and identify their top strengths. Then they could choose a movie with a character who either exemplifies or is developing these strengths. Niemiec (2020) provides a list of movies based on character strengths.\n\nA Look at Movie Couples Therapy and Family Therapy\n\nMovie therapy research has relied primarily on case studies and is mostly descriptive.\n\nThe reason for this is because of the need to choose films that will uniquely suit the client’s needs.\n\nWhile many couples and families have similar issues when they arrive in therapy, they differ enough that completing a large-scale study would be difficult.\n\nOne small study that examined six couples applied several different films that explored problem-solving abilities, managing stressful situations, not recognizing a partner’s point of view, lacking skills in recognizing or expressing thoughts and feelings, and a general tendency toward negative attributes (Egeci & Gencoz, 2017).\n\nThese researchers found that the participants moved through the stages of identification and catharsis; however, not all of them found insight. Nonetheless, the movies were helpful in facilitating discussion and providing an opportunity to relate to their problems in a new way.\n\nIn another small study, pre-adolescent children whose parents were going through a divorce were given movie therapy to help process their feelings around the separation (Marsick, 2010).\n\nThe study found that through the use of movies and follow-up sessions, the children were better able to identify and express their feelings, experienced a catharsis of anger and sadness, developed coping skills for dealing with parental divorce, and felt less alone (Marsick, 2010).\n\n“Cinema Therapy” is a popular YouTube channel run by licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and professional filmmaker Alan Seawright. They discuss movies as an opportunity to explore relationships and mental health topics. In this episode, they are discussing family dynamics through the Harry Potter series.\n\nResources From PositivePsychology.com\n\nPositivePsychology.com has wonderful free resources for clinicians and coaches to integrate into their practice. For cinema therapy sessions with individuals, tools for investigating thoughts and identifying strengths would be especially beneficial.\n\nWe share several strength finding tests, which are important aspects of movie therapy.

It can be useful for breaking through resistance and for facilitating a conversation.\n\nCinema therapy can be used in individual sessions, in groups, with couples, or with families. It has been shown to be beneficial in aiding communication and breaking down barriers to intimacy. Families may find it helpful to process big changes like moving or divorce, and couples may find it helpful for relationship difficulties.\n\nIn a group setting, clients may learn to see new points of view and feel less alone in their process. Movies can be a powerful way to bring people together and provide a stepping stone to seeing others’ perspectives.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this article.
