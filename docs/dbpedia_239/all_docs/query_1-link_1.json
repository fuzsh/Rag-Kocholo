        "text": "The category of film one chooses or can write is called a genre, they are identifiable types, categories, classifications or groups of films that contain conventions (Dercksen, 2015), in other words, Film genre are the categories in which the film being taken into consideration fall into. In this paper, a range of visual narratives and how they communicate effectively to a specific audience will be analyzed. These three visual narratives are; the horror film genre, the Film Noir/ Gangster Genre as well as the genre Science Fiction.\n\nHorror is defined as a representation for the need of suppressing uncomfortable and disturbing desires (Strinati, 2000).

The Iconography of Film Noir can be found in the clothing of the characters which consist of suits and/or snap-brim hats which were seen in the movie Goodfellas. The primary moods of film noir were melancholy, evil, guilt, desperation and paranoia (Dirks, 2018). Film noir films showed the dark side of humans (Dirks, 2018) which is seen in the boisterous and drunk behaviors of the characters in the I’m funny how scene of Goodfellas. The lighting in Film Noir films can be describes as expressionistic (Dirks, 2018) meaning that it was close to the lighting that would be found in real life. The camera angles of these"
