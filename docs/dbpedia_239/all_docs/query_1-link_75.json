        "text": "Looking to brainstorm new characters? Perhaps, you want to flesh out existing characters or pair them against another character to maximize drama and develop deeper character arcs. Writing a compelling character is easier said than done. However, it’s helpful to consider tried-and-true character archetypes to ensure every character behaves in a way that is unique, consistent, and believable. In this post, we’ll identify the various character archetypes that you can use to enhance your own characters. Plus, we’ll include plenty of iconic character archetype examples from your favorite movies and TV shows. Lastly, we’ll define which character archetypes can be paired to maximize either harmony…or conflict. Let’s get started.\n\nWHAT IS AN ARCHETYPE?\n\nUnderstanding character archetypes\n\nCharacter archetypes are great building blocks for your stories.\n\nYou don’t want to make your characters too one dimensional, but understanding why people seem to gravitate to a particular set of character traits will help you analyze human behavior.\n\nWhich leads to crafting better characters in your scripts. But what exactly does archetype mean?\n\nARCHETYPE DEFINITION\n\nWhat is an archetype?\n\nAn archetype is a consistent and typical version of a particular thing. It can be a human, an object, or a particular set of behaviors, but the point is that it fits into a time-tested mold that embodies a pure form.\n\nA character archetype is the core traits, values, and decision making patterns of a particular type of person.\n\nWhat does a character archetype do?\n\nAllows for a variety of different characters\n\nSolidifies the values for a particular character\n\nEstablishes a unique skill set for the character\n\nIt’s important to understand that there is a difference between a story archetype and a character archetype.\n\nYou can take classic archetypical characters and place them into a narrative chain of events that plays against the associated story archetype.\n\nA quarterback who needs to get to the playoffs is old hat, but a quarterback who is thrown into a murder investigation and gambling plot is relatively fresh. This is how the filmmakers behind The Last Boy Scout handled their archetypical characters.\n\nArchetypical Characters in The Last Boy Scout\n\nIn fact, this is one of the best ways to make sure that your story is a bit more fresh and a bit less tired and derivative.\n\nWhy do character archetypes exist?\n\nHuman beings tend to find their place within a group dynamic based around their strongest personality traits.\n\nYou may have a group of friends with similar interests but often one will be the “social butterfly” while another will be the \"homebody.\"\n\nYour friends will begin to identify each other by these consistent traits.\n\nYou’ve now defined yourself by a character archetype.\n\nWhen writing your own scripts, you may have a desire to use a character archetype for your hero, or for your villain.\n\nOther times you may want to build an ensemble with many archetypes.\n\nHere is a scene below that feature multiple character archetypes:\n\nArchetypical Characters in Inception • Read Entire Scene\n\nIt’s also important to note that, not every character fits into a tiny little box.\n\nWe all have a certain percentage of different character traits. Which of them dominates the majority of our personality? Which traits manifest less often?\n\nTake Michael Scott from The Office:\n\nCharacter Archetype Examples • Michael Scott\n\nMichael could be considered a leader, or perhaps a wildcard. Most characters will show signs of multiple character archetypes, but there is still a way to make a sound determination.\n\nThe simplest way is through the process of elimination.\n\nIndiana Jones, for example, fits into three different character archetypes, but when you go through the process of stripping them away one at a time, what do you get? Would you still have Indiana Jones?\n\nIndiana Jones Embodies Multiple Character Archetypes\n\nEventually, you’ll learn that there is a dominant character archetype that best exemplifies each particular character.\n\nThere are situation like Game of Thrones where a character may begin a seducer, but then walks the path of redemption to the warrior, like Jamie Lannister.\n\nThese particular archetypical characters can be applied to heroes, but they can also serve as character archetypes for villains.\n\nOften, the same character traits can be used for different reasons…\n\nYou can use your charm for good, or far evil.\n\nAlso, many characters (especially in comedy) will attempt to fit into a character archetype that seems the appropriate for their personality...\n\nBut they really only possess the negative traits associated with the type.\n\nOften, these characters fall into the unlisted character archetype:\n\nThe Fool.\n\nThis is true with shows like Veep, where the leader is a poor leader, the rebel is a poor rebel, and the caregiver can’t seem to get anything right.\n\nSeason 6 Recap | Veep\n\nYou don’t forfeit the label just because a character consistently fails to live up to the positive traits for particular archetypical characters.\n\nARCHETYPE Examples LIST\n\nComplete character archetypes list\n\nAnother important thing to keep in mind is how the archetypical characters on this list interact with one another. We’ve divided this into categories:\n\nAllies\n\nEnemies\n\nNow, this doesn’t mean that you can’t have incompatible archetypes on the same team or vice versa, because that will often lead to logical conflict. While this is great for storytelling, certain personality types have a much easier time connecting with others.\n\nSome will have more harmonious interactions while others will have more chaotic interactions.\n\nLike in this scene from The Avengers.\n\nThe Avengers at their low\n\nThey all share anger at the moment, but each of them show it in their own way. Don't shy away from these interactions in your stories.\n\nCHARACTER ARCHETYPES LIST\n\n1. The Leader\n\nOur first character archetype is The Leader.\n\nCommonly, this character archetype is forceful, a person of action. They’re confident, motivated, and brave.\n\nWhich is beneficial for staying active and building story momentum but they can often be arrogant and domineering. This is great for generating a lot of natural conflict.\n\nHere's a video breaking down how to create a dynamic Leader in your story:\n\nArchetypal Characters — The Leader • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nThe Leader — Allies\n\nThe Warrior\n\nThe Caregiver\n\nLeaders want to be surrounded by team players, and more often than not the team players are those who care about rules and standards.\n\nThat normally translates into strong, reliable relationships with both the strong will of a warrior, and the responsible approach of the caregiver.\n\nThe Leader — Enemies\n\nThe Rebel\n\nThe Wildcard\n\nThe leader has a plan, and wants to stick to that plan.\n\nNaturally, anyone who seems to throw caution to the wind or rely heavily on improvisation will get under the skin of any leader.\n\nA true leader knows that they are responsible for more than their own skin, so anyone who is a cavalier will inevitably gum up the works.\n\nThe Leader — Common Professions\n\nKing/Queen\n\nPresident\n\nCEO\n\nQuarterback\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Leader Archetype Examples\n\nGandalf — Lord of the Rings\n\nSelina Meyer — Veep\n\nJack Aubrey — Master & Commander\n\nCHARACTER ARCHETYPES IN MOVIES AND LITERATURE\n\n2. The Caregiver\n\nOur next character archetype is The Caregiver.\n\nCommonly, this character archetype prioritizes the needs of others. They want to make the world right. They’re kind, generous, and supportive.\n\nThey will often have meaningful conversations with your protagonist.\n\nBut they can often be meek, vulnerable and an easy target for a villain to capture or manipulate.\n\nArchetypal Characters — The Caregiver Archetype • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nThe Caregiver — Allies\n\nThe Leader\n\nThe Professor\n\nThe caregiver will often connect with those who have a lot of responsibility or a lot of weight on their shoulders.\n\nThey will connect with a professor often because they are willing to overlook negative traits and cast them aside as “necessary evils.”\n\nThe Caregiver — Enemies\n\nThe Seducer\n\nThe Wildcard\n\nThe main thing a caregiver can’t abide is when characters take advantage of others. This means the seducer is automatically a problem area.\n\nThe caregiver will stomach a rebel under the right circumstances, but if they do not enjoy the antics of a wildcard.\n\nThe Caregiver — Common Professions\n\nTherapist\n\nTeacher\n\nDoctor/Nurse\n\nNanny\n\nThe Caregiver Archetype Examples\n\nJohn Watson — Sherlock\n\nSam Wise — Lord of the Rings\n\nGary Walsh — Veep\n\nDr. Stephen Maturin — Master & Commander\n\nCHARACTER ARCHETYPE EXAMPLES IN MOVIES\n\n3. The Seducer\n\nOur next character archetype is The Seducer.\n\nCommonly, this character archetype is charming, a person of charisma. They’re confident, persuasive, and sly.\n\nOften debonair, they’re provocative and mysterious but they can often be manipulative and a bit jaded.\n\nFor a quick example, look no further than Han Solo.\n\nArchetypal Characters — The Seducer • Han Solo\n\nThe Seducer — Allies\n\nThe Rebel\n\nThe Castaway\n\nOften the seducer will get along with others who look out for their own neck, but also for those who have a vulnerability to be manipulated.\n\nSeducers need someone impressionable and that is where the castaway can be a powerful unwitting agent on behalf of the seducer.\n\nThe Seducer — Enemies\n\nThe Leader\n\nThe Professor\n\nOften, a leader and a professor can see right through the seducer. They won’t trust one, and know the seducer will take the shortcut if available.\n\nThe Seducer — Common Professions\n\nSpy\n\nLawyer\n\nSalesman\n\nGambler\n\nDetective\n\nThief\n\nThe Seducer Archetype Examples\n\nEames — Inception\n\nJack Vincennes — L.A. Confidential\n\nDan Egan — Veep\n\nCHARACTER ARCHETYPE EXAMPLES\n\n4. The Castaway\n\nOur next character archetype is The Castaway.\n\nCommonly, this character archetype is observant from a safe distance, a bit of a loner. They’re devoted, loyal, and introspective. But they can often be gullible and emotional.\n\nConsider Brian, the brain, from a film populated with archetypical characters — The Breakfast Club.\n\nArchetypal Characters — The Castaway • Brian the Brain\n\nThe Castaway — Allies\n\nThe Leader\n\nThe Wildcard\n\nThe Castaway is looking to be inspired, and because of this they often find themselves with a headstrong leader or a rather fluid Wildcard.\n\nAnything else is just too “middle of the road,” and will reinforce the idea that things are cemented and have no room for change on the surface.\n\nThe Castaway — Enemies\n\nThe Professor\n\nThe Warrior\n\nBoth the Professor and the Warrior will look at the Castaway and see someone who is a bit parasitic. The Castaway is too weak in their eyes.\n\nThe Castaway — Common Professions\n\nOffice Worker\n\nDriver\n\nGardener\n\nArtist\n\nCook\n\nThe Castaway Archetype Examples\n\nFrodo — Lord of the Rings\n\nAmy Brookheimer — Veep\n\nRelated Posts\n\nHow to Write a Sitcom Script →\n\nPulp Fiction Script Analysis →\n\nHow to Write a Musical →\n\nCHARACTER ARCHETYPE EXAMPLES\n\n5. The Rebel\n\nOur next character archetype is The Rebel.\n\nCommonly, these archetypal characters are energetic and individualistic, a thrill seeker. They’re street-smart, capable, and brave.\n\nBut they can often be cynical and quick tempered.\n\nThink of how Tyler Durden in Fight Club brought an entirely new perspective to the Narrator's world.\n\nTyler Durden — The Archetypical Rebel\n\nThe Rebel — Allies\n\nThe Seducer\n\nThe Castaway\n\nThe Rebel is generally interested in self-preservation and bending the rules to get what they want. The Seducer has skills useful to the rebel.\n\nThe Castaway is open minded and just cynical enough to attract the good will of a Rebel, and they share a penchant for questioning the status quo.\n\nThe Rebel — Enemies\n\nThe Leader\n\nThe Professor\n\nThe Rebel will see these two as old guard, and unwilling to redefine methods and approaches toward goals.\n\nA Rebel is often much more guess and check, whereas a Professor is more scientific, and the Leader more loyal to institutions.\n\nThe Rebel — Common Professions\n\nCriminal\n\nFighter Pilot\n\nAdventurer\n\nSpy\n\nCowboy\n\nMercenary\n\nMechanic\n\nThe Rebel Archetype Examples\n\nReiben — Saving Private Ryan\n\nMaverick — Top Gun\n\nWill Hunting — Good Will Hunting\n\nJonah Ryan — Veep\n\nCHARACTER ARCHETYPE EXAMPLES\n\n6. The Wildcard\n\nOur next character archetype is The Wildcard.\n\nCommonly, this character archetype is unpredictable, a person of improvisation. They’re often brutally honest, humorous, and creative.\n\nBut they can often be sarcastic, impulsive, and meddlesome.\n\nDespite his loyal friendship, Walter in The Big Lebowski could be a Wildcard in any scene at any time.\n\nWriting archetypes like Walter must be a blast\n\nThe Wildcard — Allies\n\nThe Warrior\n\nThe Castaway\n\nThe Wildcard pairs well with a Warrior because they both are all about the action, and they often needs one another’s skill set.\n\nThe Castaway and Wildcard have some common traits, one of which is their tendency to be more impulsive and fluid.\n\nThe Wildcard — Enemies\n\nThe Leader\n\nThe Professor\n\nThe Wildcard is all about doing what they want when they feel like it and everything is based around instinct. This is tough on a Leader.\n\nIt is also tough on a Professor who does so much research that someone who lives unprepared can seem ludicrous.\n\nThe Wildcard — Common Professions\n\nBlue collar\n\nArtists\n\nBeautician\n\nFreelancer\n\nVagabond\n\nGypsy\n\nTraveler\n\nThe Wildcard Archetype Examples\n\nWalter — The Big Lebowski\n\nMike McLintock — Veep\n\nCharlie Kelly — It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nDoc Holliday — Tombstone\n\nCHARACTER ARCHETYPE EXAMPLES\n\n7. The Professor\n\nOur next character archetype is The Professor.\n\nCommonly, this character archetype is literal, droll, and very often a genius. They’re logical, problem solving, and candid.\n\nBut they can often be socially oblivious and rigid.\n\nSpock from Star Trek just might be the perfect archetype example. He prioritizes logic above all but what makes this character even more interesting is his half human side that is constant conflict.\n\nSpock • Archetype Examples\n\nThe Professor — Allies\n\nThe Caregiver\n\nThe Leader\n\nThe Professor is often a flawed social being, and that often translates into a Caregiver being the only person with the patience to stand them.\n\nThe Leader is often someone who takes their work seriously, which will earn the respect of a Professor more than almost anything else.\n\nThe Professor — Enemies\n\nThe Seducer\n\nThe Wildcard\n\nThe Professor will get tired of the smooth antics of a Seducer, and the unpredictable actions of a Wildcard. Everything a Professor does is thought out, so a Wildcard may get in their way too much.\n\nThe Professor — Common Professions\n\nInstructor\n\nDetective\n\nEconomist\n\nEngineer\n\nPathologist\n\nThe Professor Archetype Examples\n\nSherlock Holmes — Sherlock\n\nGreg House — House\n\nKent Davidson — Veep\n\nCHARACTER ARCHETYPE EXAMPLES\n\n8. The Warrior\n\nOur next character archetype is The Warrior.\n\nCommonly, this character archetype is courageous, self-sacrificing, a person of honor. They’re strong willed, involved, and have a code.\n\nBut they can often be stubborn and obsessive — just like Sarah Connor in The Terminator franchise.\n\nSarah Connor — The Archetypical Warrior\n\nThe Warrior — Allies\n\nThe Leader\n\nThe Professor\n\nA warrior needs something to fight for, and often that can be a leader rather than a cause. Warriors are driven by honor and by a code, which means they respect those with a code of their own like a professor.\n\nThe Warrior — Enemies\n\nThe Caregiver\n\nThe Castaway\n\nGenerally, the warrior will see a nurturing soul or a searching soul and see their traits as a complete waste of time. The caregiver is too worried about consequences while the castaway is too lethargic for a warrior.\n\nThe Warrior — Common Professions\n\nSoldier\n\nPolice Officer\n\nFire Fighter\n\nLawyer\n\nJournalist\n\nMissionary\n\nThe Warrior Archetype Examples\n\nAragorn — Lord of the Rings\n\nRyan — Saving Private Ryan\n\nBud White — L.A. Confidential\n\nBen Cafferty — Veep\n\nSTORY ARCHETYPE EXAMPLES\n\nCharacter archetypes in ensembles\n\nWhile character archetypes are meant to interact with one another, each and everyone of them can be used as a main protagonist.\n\nJust because the Leader has many of the classic traits associated with a main protagonist, that doesn’t mean the Castaway cannot be the main protagonist for their own story.\n\nHowever, when your story features a group, squad, or team you will often build that team based on their unique character traits.\n\nWhen behind enemy lines, your commando team needs a green beret, marine, driver, sapper, sniper, and a spy.\n\nThese are specialities that make-up a winning team, because you need a different skill set for each problem you encounter.\n\nThese skill sets (like professions) will often connect to certain archetypes.\n\nLet’s take a look at a few examples of movies and series that used the ensemble cast and how they went about applying character archetypes.\n\nCharacter Archetypes | Game of Thrones\n\nLet’s take a look at the archetype examples in Game of Thrones.\n\nGame of Thrones Season 5 Recap\n\nCersei/Daenerys — The Leader\n\nSamwell/Jorah — The Caregiver\n\nJamie/Euron — The Seducer\n\nTyrion/Sansa — The Castaway\n\nBronn/Arya — The Rebel\n\nThe Hound — The Wildcard\n\nDavos/Varys — The Professor\n\nJon Snow/Brienne — The Warrior\n\nCharacter Archetypes | The Avengers\n\nLet’s take a look at the archetype examples in Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nArchetypal Roles in Infinity War • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nCaptain America/Black Panther — The Leader\n\nScarlet Witch/War Machine — The Caregiver\n\nIronman — The Seducer\n\nHulk/Gamora — The Castaway\n\nThor/Loki — The Rebel\n\nStarlord/Spiderman — The Wildcard\n\nDoctor Strange/Vision — The Professor\n\nBlack Widow/Thanos — The Warrior\n\nCharacter Archetypes | Inception\n\nLet’s take a look at the archetypical characters in Inception.\n\nDifferent Archetypes in Inception\n\nCobb — The Leader\n\nAriadne — The Caregiver\n\nEames — The Seducer\n\nFischer — The Castaway\n\nSaito — The Rebel\n\nMal — The Wildcard\n\nYusuf — The Professor\n\nArthur — The Warrior\n\nCharacter Archetypes | Saving Private Ryan\n\nLet’s take a look at the archetype examples in Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan.\n\nMachine Gun Nest | Saving Private Ryan\n\nMiller — The Leader\n\nHorvath — The Caregiver\n\nMellish — The Seducer\n\nUpham — The Castaway\n\nReiben — The Rebel\n\nJackson — The Wildcard\n\nWade — The Professor\n\nRyan — The Warrior\n\nCharacter Archetypes |Ocean’s Eleven\n\nLet’s take a look at the archetype examples in Soderbergh’s Ocean’s Eleven.\n\nBuild a Crew | Ocean’s Eleven\n\nDanny Ocean — The Leader\n\nRusty Ryan — The Caregiver\n\nFrank Catton/Saul Bloom — The Seducer\n\nLinus Caldwell — The Castaway\n\nBasher Tarr — The Rebel\n\nVirgil/Turk Malloy — The Wildcard\n\nReuben Tishkoff/Livingston Dell — The Professor\n\nYen — The Warrior\n\nUp Next\n\nHow to Write Better Dialogue\n\nYou've written a pretty good script, but you know it could be great.
