        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n17 Aug 2022, 08:02\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nRobert De Niro will be starring opposite himself in an upcoming gangster drama from Warner Bros. titled Wise Guys.\n\nThe acting legend will be teaming up with Rain Man director Barry Levinson on the new movie and will definitely be earning his paycheque after playing both the main characters.\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, De Niro will be taking on the part of Vito Genovese and Frank Costello- two Italian American gangster bosses at the head of their respective families in the 20th century.\n\nThe movie will follow the two characters after Genovese tried (and failed) to assassinate Costello in 1957, leaving him ultimately injured and looking to retire from the mafia.\n\nDe Niro and Levinson have previously worked together on films such as The Wizard of Lies, What Just Happened and Wag the Dog.\n\nThe actor will also be reuniting with Nicholas Pileggi, co-writer of Martin Scorsese’s classic Goodfellas, as well as Irwin Winkler who will serve as producer on the new film.\n\nIt’s set to be a busy year for De Niro, who will also be joining the star-studded cast for crime drama Amsterdam.\n\nThe actor will appear in the highly anticipated period movie, which follows three friends caught in a murder investigation in the 1930s, alongside the likes of Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, Anya Taylor-Joy, Rami Malek and John David Washington.\n\nDavid O. Russell will be at the helm as director for the new movie, which will mark his first film since 2015’s Joy- he has also previously worked with Bale in The Fighter and American Hustle.\n\nInitially, the film was due to hit cinemas in November this year, but it was announced yesterday (16th August) that it is being brought forward by Disney and will now be released on 7th October."
