        "text": "The box-office success of the white male bodybuilder as star has been one of the most visible aspects of recent American action cinema. The visibility of the built male body, in both film and advertising images, represents part of a wider shift in the male image, and in the range of masculine identities, that are on offer in western popular culture. In terms of the action cinema more specifically, the figure of the bodybuilder as star can be contrasted to the male stars of the Hong Kong action tradition, in which an elaborate, quick-fire, physical performance has come to form a central part of the visual pleasure that is on offer. The distinction is that between images of the body in action, so central to fight-films, and images of the top-heavy, almost statuesque, figure of the bodybuilder who essentially strikes poses within an action narrative. This distinction clearly has implications for the kinds of action, and the sorts of display, that action films offer. American films showcasing the western kickboxing star Jean-Claude Van Damme, for example, are increasingly moving away from the emphasis on contact fighting found in his Hong Kong films, replacing this with an emphasis on the built muscular body. As is perhaps already apparent, the moves through which bodybuilders became movie stars through the 1980s, whilst other male stars began to build their bodies, offers a site through which to explore the changing articulation of masculinities in the contemporary action cinema. This needs to be set against a cinematic context in which narratives of fatherhood and family life, in films as diverse as Parenthood, The Good Father, Parents and The Stepfather, have proved extremely popular. Images of the built male body, that is, form only a part of the new visibility that surrounds male bodies and masculine identities within both popular culture and academic inquiry."
