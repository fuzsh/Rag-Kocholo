        "text": "Overtly political films have never been popular in American cinema. As Phillip Gianos once put it: \"The United States has developed over the years a richer film vocabulary for gangsters, cowboys and mummies raised from the dead than it has for citizens and presidents.\" In the world of Hollywood, he writes, \"politics is not consequential; politics is not interesting; happiness is purely an individual matter; things will be all right. This is what virtually all American films tell their audiences.\"\n\nHowever, one major American director ― Frank Capra ― did indeed devote a major part of his career to the exploration of American political culture. No major American filmmaker, save Capra, has dealt seriously with central themes of citizenship, responsibility and participation in civic life; certainly no one has confronted the internal contradictions of America in a more powerful and revealing way ― both personally and artistically.\n\nWhat we aim to explore here is the rise and eventual collapse of Capra's project to develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action, as well as connect the failure of his project with some fundamental contradictions of the American conceptualisation of political life.\n\nFrom Mr. Deeds to Mr. Smith\n\nDuring the mid-thirties until the early-forties Frank Capra, the son of illiterate Sicilian immigrants, lived out the American dream by becoming the one of the most popular and successful men in America. Capra was not only the best paid director in Hollywood, he was the only director whose name was featured above the title, and the only one given free rein in production. Capra presided over the Golden Age of film, before the advent of television, when over ninety million people went to the movies at least once a week. The unparalleled cultural dominance of Hollywood film during this period led Neal Gabler to call cinema a \"new civic religion,\" binding a fragmented American society together during the depression and the Second World War.\n\nIn his early career, Capra was best known for his witty romantic comedies that reconciled class divisions through the force of love. The most successful was It Happened One Night (1934), in which a manly proletarian hero brings a snobby rich girl down to earth and gains her devotion, her father's approval, and her money, all without compromising any of his independence or integrity.\n\nHowever, Capra was not content to be a director of lightweight fare. Immediately after the huge financial and critical success of It Happened One Night, he suffered a major physical and psychological breakdown, torn by doubts about his own creative ability and personal worth ― an identity crisis that reflects characteristic American cultural anxieties about authenticity and status. As Capra reports in his lively but often unreliable autobiography, The Name Above the Title¸ he was rescued from his depression by a visit from an anonymous \"little man\" who chided him for not making use of his talents to better the lot of humanity. In response, Capra self-consciously resolved to inspire his fellow citizens by reaffirming and updating national myths in his films.\n\nThe first of his \"depression trilogy,\" Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), established the basic formula. In it, Longfellow Deeds, a naïve country boy (played by Gary Cooper), inherits a fortune and goes off to experience life in New York, where his basic American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the cruelty and hypocrisy of the city. He also meets a street-wise media woman, Louise Bennett (Jean Arthur), who first manipulates him for her own ends but ends up falling in love with him. Moved by the plight of his fellow citizens, Deeds decides to give away most of his fortune ― though prudently keeping two million dollars for his own use (he may be charitable, but he is no saint). He is then accused of being crazy and taken to court by venal lawyers, but wins everyone over in a stirring speech (later quoted extensively by Ronald Reagan). In it, Deeds says: \"From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there'll always be leaders and always be followers … And I say the fellows who can make the hill on high should stop once in a while to help those who can't.\" Capra's (and later Reagan's) appeal to charity and individual goodness ― combined with a distaste for the complexities of political life ― struck a chord with most Americans.\n\nIn Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), Capra expanded on his pet themes, making them more obviously political. Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), the son of a crusading newspaperman, is a sweet and childlike Western everyman who imitates birdcalls and spends his spare time as a boy scout leader. He is elected to the senate as a stooge for crooked special interests led by a greedy boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold). His fellow senator, Joseph Paine (Claude Rains), was his late father's best friend but has now has been corrupted, and counsels Smith to learn to compromise his ideals as well. Smith responds, memorably, that lost causes are the only ones worth fighting for.\n\nMeanwhile, our hero has been taken up by a savvy newspaper woman, Clarissa Saunders (again played by Jean Arthur), who aims to exploit his innocence for publicity purposes, but falls in love with him instead, and encourages him to stand up against the lobbyists and special interests. Smith duly tries to expose the plots of the political bosses, but is made to face trumped up charges on the floor of the Senate, where he fights back through a filibuster. In contrast to Deeds, who convinced the court of his integrity with his arguments, the Senate is unmoved. Smith collapses from exhaustion, and is only victorious because Paine, overcome by guilt, tries to commit suicide and then tells the truth.\n\nAfter the completion of the film, the US Senate, furious at its portrayal as a nest of corruption, denounced it as un-American, and there were demands that it not be released. But Capra's portrait of the depraving influences of governmental power appealed to an American public traditionally leery of politicians and official authority; similarly, the story of a lone hero struggling against all odds for what he knows to be right evoked the American myth of the rugged individual, reliant solely on his own moral compass for direction.\n\nThe film also tapped an equally American faith in the sacred rule of law, which allows Smith his right to be heard before the full Senate (just as Deeds had his say in court). And of course, the movie featured the necessary ― though completely unbelievable ― happy ending, along with the message that love can conquer all. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was a great success both at home and abroad. The London Sunday Graphic called it the best American patriotic film ever made, which could only be equalled by \"Mr. Capra Goes to America.\"\n\nIn these two films, Capra and his collaborators built a myth of the American everyman hero as \"the honest and forthright fellow ― confused, inconsistent, but always sincere ― who believes in the basic goodness of people and has the courage to fight hard for principles.\" Each film utilised the same sets of oppositions: small town innocence against the wise-guy corruption of the city; the integrity and decency of the individual everyman versus the power and venality of \"special interest groups\" run by rapacious \"bosses\"; the necessity of charity as a prophylactic against greed; faith in the legal system and suspicion of the compromises of politics; love as the solvent of cynicism and the conqueror of class divisions. Each movie focused above all on the lonely and courageous stand of an honest innocent hero against corporate evil.\n\nThe United States, Capra's political films said, was a place where virtuous political action, love, naivety, bravery, integrity and charity went hand in hand with a faith in the individual and a deep distrust of official authority. But neither of these hugely popular films really touched on the fundamental problem that was to preoccupy Capra in his next, and crucial, work: the problem of reconciling heroic individualism with the practice of collective action.\n\nMeet John Doe\n\nMeet John Doe (1941) was the third and most ambitious of Capra's political films. It was, he says, \"aimed at winning critical praises.\" It was also to be the first effort by Capra as a completely independent producer. Capitalising on his previous successes, he had started his own film company ― symbolically called Liberty Films ― and was backing the John Doe project with his own money. Furthermore, while filming Capra also organised a new experimental and utopian work environment, a kind of Santa's workshop where unemployed craftsmen could freely utilise supplied tools and space to discover new inventions. These would be the property of the shop, with half of the profits ploughed back into the expanding enterprise. (The sleeping partner in Capra's shop was another paradigmatic American self-made man, Howard Hughes.)\n\nBoth in his movie and his professional life, Capra was aiming high, experimenting with new artistic and social forms where his own individual independence could ― he hoped ― be reconciled with the necessities of group life.\n\nMeet John Doe was to be a movie that dealt not with heroes, but with the masses, the John Does, who are described this way in the continuity script:\n\nIf anybody should ask you what the average John Doe is like, you couldn't tell him, because he's a million and one things. He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small. He's simple and he's wise … He's the man the ads are written for. He's the fellow everybody sells things to. He's … the world's greatest stooge and the world's greatest strength.\n\nPrior to release, the film had a huge publicity build-up that conflated the lead character with the American public, and even with America itself. One ad proclaimed that John Doe is \"3,000 miles wide and 1,000 miles tall,\" and superimposed a sketch of the character over a map of the United States. Another showed John Doe's silhouette fleshed in with line drawings of hundreds of tiny figures. The text announced, \"One Man in a Million! … A Million Men in One!\" Yet another portrayed a giant John Doe bending to greet a field of miniatures, with the headline reading, \"John Doe … Meet America.\" At some theatres life-sized cardboard cut-outs of John Doe extended a hand to greet the incoming public.\n\nIn many respects, the storyline of John Doe follows the well-tested plots from Deeds and Smith. A rural innocent, John Willoughby (Gary Cooper) is thrust into a corrupt political arena where he is first manipulated and then helped by a cynical newspaper woman, Ann Mitchell (played by Barbara Stanwyck), who has fallen in love with him. He is suborned by a political power-broker and newspaper owner, D.B. Norton (again played by Edward Arnold), who makes him a media star for his own nefarious purposes. The naïve hero finally realises he is being duped and stands up for himself against the forces of evil.\n\nBut a closer look shows significant differences from the earlier plots. One is that, in John Doe, the hero does not have a solid base in family and community. Instead, he is a hobo, an ex-baseball pitcher with a bad arm; in Capra's words, he is \"a drifting piece of human flotsam as devoid of ideals as he was of change in his pocket.\" By beginning with an amoral and rootless individual, Capra touches on a central American ambivalence about social life. In the United States a strong ideal of individualism correlates with real fluidity in social status and spatial mobility, a frontier mentality, a Protestant cosmology and capitalist entrepreneurism. Like the standard assumptions of classic social contract theory and Western liberalism, this ideal posits that individuals exist prior to the social world. What this means, as Hervé Varenne has put it, is that for Americans, \"individualism is natural, community problematical. Society has to be built.\"\n\nThe American faith in individualism and concomitant anxiety about the demands of sociality nurtures fantasies of escape from all social entanglements and mundane responsibilities ― fantasies expressed in characteristic images of lone cowboys, survivalists holed up in the wilderness, desert island paradises and so on. In his romantic comedies, like It Happened One Night, Capra had been content to play along with these American fantasies. Instead of ideas, his films showed \"only a sense of dissatisfaction, and urge to escape ― on to the open road with the daughter of a millionaire, back to small-town simplicity on a safe income.\" Even in Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith, Capra did not confront the problem of how a free agent could achieve a social conscience. Instead, he simply assumed that his heroes were upright because they had been born into a traditional community and family, and so detested the immorality of modernity.\n\nBut in John Doe, Capra wished to go deeper, to inquire into the nature of the relationship between the demands of the community and individual freedom. By making his hero a presocial tramp, Capra wanted to show how an ultimate individualist could be induced to give up freedom and accept the necessary but burdensome obligations and responsibilities of participation in civil life.\n\nTo highlight the issue, he paired his hero with a true outsider, the Colonel (played with brio by Walter Brennan), who believes that \"the world's been shaved by a drunken barber\" and that the best strategy is to opt out of social life completely. According to the Colonel's Rousseauean philosophy, relationships, responsibilities and social participation inevitably lead to status competition and envy, turning the free individual into \"a Heelot\" (the \"Heelots\" are \"a lot of heels\") driven by desire for possessions and status, and burdened down by regulations and duties. In the film, the Colonel responds to all talk of \"love\" or \"community\" with cynicism, and continually seeks to lure John back toward the masculine, unsocialised life of hobo freedom.\n\nUnfortunately for the coherence of the plot, the Colonel's message of anarchy is presented with such conviction that it undermines the overt message of participation. Although he recants at the movie's end, the Colonel's seditious argument remains powerful and discordant. (This incoherence is reflected Capra's own experience. In his daily life, Capra attempted to present himself as complete independent, conspicuously denying the role of his family in helping him gain success, and ignoring the contributions of others in making his projects.)\n\nJohn's initial attraction to the social world is money and luxury ― which the Colonel warns him is only the first step toward becoming a \"Heelot.\" Nonetheless, Willoughby accepts the job of pretending to be a non-existent \"John Doe' made up by Ann Mitchell as a publicity stunt in order to keep her job in Norton's paper, which is being \"streamlined\" for a modern era by Norton's employee, the hardbitten newspaperman Connell (James Gleason). The imaginary John Doe has vowed to commit suicide on Christmas to protest the miserable state of the world. By reading speeches prepared by Ann, making use of her saintly dead father's diaries, the fake John Doe inspires the growth of grass-roots \"John Doe clubs\" based on simple values of neighbourliness and voluntarism.\n\nCapra thus takes on another issue he had previously skirted: the role of popular political action in the American context. As noted, Capra's earlier movies had already shown his deep suspicion of political professionals and official government (along with his faith in the law). The John Doe movement is likewise determinedly anti-institutional; politicians are not allowed to join; there is no official organisation or hierarchy; the John Doe clubs \"ask for nothing\" from government agencies and rely solely on the personal kindness of members toward one another to transform society. This too is an attitude deeply rooted in American culture ― one that has its roots in a shared premise of egalitarianism.\n\nIt was Alexis de Tocqueville who argued that the highest value held by the citizens of the United States is equality. Every individual in America, Tocqueville said, is believed to be the moral equivalent of all others, with an equal potential and right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness ― an ideology, it should be stressed, that continues to be eagerly embraced even by those at the very bottom of the socio-economic order as well as by the rest of the society. This pervasive faith helps explain why the United States has never been friendly to the emergence of distinct social groups with self-consciously different ways of life, and accounts as well for the massive popularity of Capra's earlier comedies in which class differences are dissolved by love and good fellowship.\n\nBecause Americans consider themselves to be equivalent, there is considerable resentment reserved for those who make claims to be superior in any way. This applies in particular to the minions of the state, and to those who wield political authority in \"the name of the people.\" Partly this is because the United States was founded by means of an anti-state revolution; it remains the least centralised modern nation, with the least amount of governmental intervention in the lives of citizens. As egalitarian individualists, Americans continue to view central state organisation with great trepidation, fearing curtailment of individual liberty.\n\nWithin this context, Americans believe that political organisation in its ideal form ought to be a personal matter spontaneously achieved between neighbours meeting over the back fence, inspired solely by love and friendship ― otherwise it risks the dangers of bureaucratic rationalisation and entanglement with corrupting official state power. The John Doe clubs exemplify the ideal small-scale form of communal participation, arising outside of official channels and reliant solely on the good fellowship of its members to draw isolated individuals out of themselves and into social life.\n\nThis is illustrated clearly in the effect of the clubs on John Doe himself. During the course of the movie, the hero slowly becomes more socially committed, first as a result of his growing love for Ann, who in turn begins to love him, in large part because she hears the voice of her father in the inspirational speeches she has written (confusions between paternal and sexual love abound in the movie). But the turning point comes when John realises the common humanity he shares with the humble members of the clubs who come to listen to him speak:\n\nI could feel that they were hungry for something. Do you know what I mean? Maybe that's why they came. Maybe they're just lonely and wanted somebody to say hello to. I know how they feel. I've been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life.\n\nRealising his own need for others, John is now committed to the ideals Ann had put in his mouth in his first speech. The struggle of the John Does throughout history, the speech said, has always been to gain freedom. But this can only be accomplished through cooperation; average Americans therefore need to seek out their neighbours and help each other as teammates; they must tear down the fences that separate them (the Colonel's response is, \"Why if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence, he'd sue you!\"). The speech ends as follows:\n\nThe meek can only inherit the earth when the John Does start loving their neighbors. You'd better start right now. Don't wait till the game is called on account of darkness. Wake up, John Doe, you're the hope of the world.\n\nThe rule of the mob\n\nMeet John Doe reaches its dramatic turning point as Norton plots to make use of the Doe movement's popularity to launch his own bid for the presidency. Norton is an American fascist who commands a uniformed private army of disciplined motorcyclists. Willoughby/Doe discovers Norton's plan and threatens to expose him at the huge public rally where he is supposed to announce his support for Norton's candidacy. Norton derides him: \"You're the fake! We believe in what we're doing!\" John responds that the John Doe idea is \"bigger than whether I'm a fake … It may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world!\" And he vows to speak out, \"in my own words this time.\"\n\nHowever, where Deeds and Smith had their chance to represent themselves to the public, Doe does not. The unscrupulous Norton exposes Doe as a fraud to the crowd of club members. In a remarkable and frightening scene, the cheering crowd are transformed into a violent mob. Egged on by Norton's planted henchmen, they turn on Doe, who is unable to defend himself, since his microphone has been disconnected by Norton. (The depiction of the media is another complex and self-contradictory aspect of the film. The message is that control over information by the powerful suborns democracy. Yet, at the same time, the movie industry in which Capra worked is itself a huge corporate enterprise.)\n\nEven when Willoughby/Doe does manage to speak personally to some of his most loyal supporters, they brutally repudiate him. The humiliated Doe is battered and bruised by the mob, Ann stands helplessly weeping, and Connell offers a cynical toast: \"You can chalk up another one to the Pontius Pilates.\"\n\nThis was hardly the sort of uplifting tale Capra had told in his earlier movies, where Deeds and Smith had each stood up alone for their beliefs and had won out against all odds. Instead, as Capra explored the relationship between the individual and social movements, the message was that the public are nothing more than \"decent, credulous sheep,\" and a \"fickle, easily manipulated and easily stampeded herd\" who blindly destroy their own capacity for brotherly unity. Capra had often said that \"the people are right … people's instincts are good, never bad.\" But for him the moral of this movie was that \"people can become mobs, and one of the occasions they can become mobs is when they become disillusioned, when somebody has tricked them.\"\n\nHaving reached this juncture, Capra was at an impasse. As he would later write in his autobiography: \"But now, what happens to John Doe? to the thousands that believed? to the forces of evil? We didn't know.\" His inability to end the film became infamous in Hollywood. Five different endings were scripted. In all of them, John decides to redeem himself by actually committing suicide, as the false note had promised, and mounts to the top of City Hall on Christmas eve. But in none of the alternative scripts does the redemptive suicide in fact occur. As Capra wrote, \"my argument against that is that his blood would be on the souls of the John Does.\"\n\nHe first released a print in which Norton, moved by Doe's willingness to sacrifice himself, repents and offers to confess his wrongdoing to the public, but this sentimental ending was rejected by the audience. Capra finally settled on a script suggested, he said, in a letter by an anonymous \"John Doe\" who was incensed with the way the ordinary man was shown in the film. In this final version, Ann entreats John not to die, reminding him that Jesus had already sacrificed himself for the ideal of brotherly love. But the last straw in persuading John to live is the arrival of John Doe club members, who ask his forgiveness and beg him to continue to lead them. When John relents, Connell has the last word: \"There you are Norton! The people! Try and lick that!\" The film ends with the \"Ode to Joy\" from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the pealing of church bells.\n\nBut despite Capra's blatant use of a kind of \"hieratic register\" meant to hush all doubts, it was obvious that the ending was not successful. Belying Connell's defiant words, the people had hardly triumphed: Norton remained powerful and the so-called people's representative had no message to give other than his willingness to die. The failure was obvious to Capra himself. The movie he had hoped would lead him into the future had instead: \"fizzled into the Great American Letdown\":\n\nWhat our film said to bewildered people hungry for solutions was this, \"No answers this time, ladies and gentlemen. It's back to the drawing board.\" And the people said, \"Oh, nuts!\"\n\nThe inadequacy of Meet John Doe had a profound effect on Capra's career. Afterwards, his independent production venture failed miserably, as did his idealistic scheme for a collective workshop. His next (and last) successful film, It's a Wonderful Life (1946), retreated completely from politics toward a saccharine apotheosis of private life and small town nostalgia. This film, with its dark subtext of hopelessness and its use of a literal deus ex machina to save the suicidal protagonist became the iconic American movie during the Reagan years, broadcast over and over again during the Christmas season. It remains Capra's most famous and beloved work.\n\nHis attempt to return to political discourse in State of the Union (1948) produced a movie not only of poor technical quality but also of unrelieved cynicism, confusion and weariness. The hero (Spencer Tracy) is a successful businessman who decides to run for political office, only to discover that he has nothing to offer and is merely a phoney interested only in self-aggrandisement. \"I have no cause,\" he admits. Capra was speaking for himself. His attempt to construct a political myth for America had come to naught, as had his bid for creative independence and his plans for a utopian community. He had nothing more to offer, and never again produced any work of merit.\n\nPolitics and the individual\n\nIn his old age, Capra warned American filmmakers: \"Forget all politics. Because if you politicize yourself, what you do is cut yourself in half.\" How did America's foremost political filmmaker come to such a conclusion, and what does his trajectory tell us about the problems of political cinema in America?\n\nThere are many reasons, personal and social, for Capra's withdrawal from political filmmaking. One could argue that the grandiosity that led him to try to reformulate the American myth hid a fragile sense of identity; in Meet John Doe he was confronted with the limits of his narcissism, and found he really had no message; that he, like his hero, was empty of content. His long decline and depression was the inevitable result. Equally, one could note the repressive and censorious American political climate of the era and Capra's fear of being persecuted ― not an unrealistic anxiety. His screenwriter for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Sidney Buchman, was indeed blacklisted and driven into exile.\n\nBut also responsible for Capra's impasse are the logically incoherent implications of the premises that he operated from ― premises that prevail very widely in American political theory. They can be synopsised as follows: \"People alone are amoral, together they achieve morality, but as soon as that togetherness is organized politically they become immoral.\"\n\nThis view of politics resonates with Alexis de Tocqueville's widely accepted notions about the nature of the American experiment. To recapitulate, Tocqueville believed that in the American world of proudly egalitarian individualists \"no man is obliged to put his powers at the disposal of another, and no one has any claim of right to substantial support from his fellow man.\" As we've already pointed out, the egalitarian value of personal independence lies behind the suspicion of central authority so notable in Capra's films and in American culture in general.\n\nCapra and Tocqueville both assumed that the egalitarian individualist is inevitably disconnected from the world of society and politics. In fact, the major theme of American social thought, and of Capra's movie, is how to relate the isolated individual to the larger social whole. Here is where the fundamental problem lies, since it is presumed that the asocial individual does not have any moral core. As Tocqueville argued, without a larger social and moral framework within which to locate their identities, Americans \"increasingly let themselves glide with the stream of the crowd and find it hard to maintain alone an opinion abandoned by the rest.\" In other words, despite their affirmations of independence, Americans are actually unable to stand up for themselves. And because America is a place where \"men are weak, isolated and changeable,\" without firm social positions, rules and precedents, it follows that \"when ambitious men have once seized power, they think they can dare to do anything.\"\n\nTocqueville believed that the tendency toward tyranny that he found beneath the surface in the United States could be offset by training in civic virtue, which occurred in institutions like the jury system and in the numerous voluntary associations of neighbours and co-workers that he saw proliferating in the United States. But all this would come to naught without some kind of religious faith:\n\nDespotism may be able to do without faith, but freedom cannot … How could society escape destruction if, when political ties are relaxed, moral ties are not tightened? And what can be done with a people master of itself if it is not subject to God?\n\nTocqueville's analysis of American culture thus rests on the premise that the ordinary individual in American democratic society has no moral compass, and will follow wherever led. The citizen can really only be rescued from tyranny by faith. This is the same fear and the same unrealistic solution found in Meet John Doe. Capra's earlier political movies about heroic individuals worked because he was able to set them against society and against politics, and thereby stay within the boundaries of the individualist paradigm. But when he sought to express the development of a moral sense through participation in a political community, the ideological framework within which he worked, and which he shares with Tocqueville and other social theorists of American culture, inevitably led him to portray the American public as a dangerous and mindless mob who end by crucifying their own representative, portrayed as an everyman as empty of content as are the people he embodies. The only ones with inner conviction, it seems, are the power-hungry Nortons of the world.\n\nMeet John Doe, then, is a failure as a film for just the reasons that it is immensely interesting as a social document. Mainstream cinema requires a coherent story line and a conclusion in which ambiguities are resolved. Because of the inner contradictions of the issues Capra tackled in Meet John Doe, those conditions could not be met except by recourse to an unconvincing deus ex machina. Neither can they be met in Tocquevillian social theory about American citizenship, which similarly posits a moral vacancy at its very core."
