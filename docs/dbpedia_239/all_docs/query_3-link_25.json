        "text": "Why a film about Benjamin Franklin?\n\nDavid Schmidt: I’ve spent every working day with Franklin for more than four years, and I’m still drawn to him because there is no other individual you can learn about who gives you a fuller picture of 18th-Century America. This is a period of momentous change in science, technology, literature, politics, and government, and Franklin had a central role in all those revolutions. He lived such a long, prolific, and well-traveled life, and he seems to have had something to say about just about everything.\n\nAnywhere I turn to in his biography, I find myself eager to know more about him and the people with whom he shared his century. Franklin was an indentured laborer in his youth, an enslaver in middle age, an abolitionist at his twilight, and his changing relationship to servitude reveals so much about the evils of slavery and the slow struggle to end it in the United States. Through his role as a postmaster and printer, he exchanged news, ideas, and theories with well-connected and ingenious people on his continent and in Europe. Much of that correspondence survives and has been painstakingly cataloged, which means thought is preserved and shared through the centuries.\n\nFor decades, Franklin was the British Empire’s biggest booster in America; then he gave everything he had to win American Independence. In one capacity, he was a diplomat who met with American Indian delegations in North America — Haudenosaunee, Wyandot, Shawnee, Delaware, Miami, etc. — and in another he negotiated in Paris with European delegations — French, British, etc. He’s the scientist who unlocked electricity, gave it the vocabulary we still know it by, and won himself international fame in the process. And he invented bifocals and the lightning rod, which are saving time and saving lives at this very moment. He was already 70 when he signed the Declaration of Independence. So, if you understand Franklin you have seven full decades of backstory about America before the United States, as well as how he was central to the creation of the American Republic.\n\nFinally, there’s his example — not the “work hard,” “spend less,” “go to bed early,” and all that famous stuff he didn’t always do — but the example of being curious, looking for ways to improve yourself and your community, then acting and actually making change. Franklin could admit he was wrong, he could listen, he could compromise, and he was open to changing his mind. He preached “useful knowledge,” and I think knowing Benjamin Franklin’s story is very useful for any of us wanting to better understand who we are.\n\nKaty Haas: Ken often tells people we don’t time our films for current events or make films in response to the news; our focus is always historic. But digging into the life, work and times of Benjamin Franklin while also listening to the daily news of the last few years – I kept thinking how his story can be a lens for understanding some of our current events and political divides. There are a lot of conversations and debates he was a part of that were similar or related to those we are having today. So many questions of law and governance immediately bring up the Constitution. Benjamin Franklin was there, part of the discussions of the structure of our government. And when we look into what the founders really were thinking and saying, you see they were not all in agreement about what we now know as this foundational document, the Constitution. There were many questions in society that are mirrored in current American discourse today – questions around justice and equity, governance and policy. For me, knowing more about this history and the lives of the people who lived it helps my understanding of where we are now.\n\nWhat were you surprised about in Franklin’s life?\n\nKaty: There is an amazing book by one of our interviewees, Sheila Skemp, (Benjamin and William Franklin: Father and Son, Patriot and Loyalist) that begins with two parallel stories of Benjamin Franklin and his son William on July 4, 1776; Benjamin was signing the Declaration of Independence, William was in jail in Connecticut as the last Royal governor in the colonies. I was struck by the stark contrast and division in their lives that was brought about through the American Revolution. The personal elements of Franklin’s story, the parts that felt very human—his family and fallibility—really gave me a different lens not only to understand him as a person, but the times he lived in. It opened my eyes to more of the complexity and the contention of the Revolution and how politics were shaping individual lives in 18th-Century America.\n\nDavid: There’s so much I didn’t know. I didn’t know Franklin enslaved people. I didn’t know he profited from slavery through ads and notices in his newspaper. I knew he was a scientist, and I knew his kite experiment. But I didn’t understand just how groundbreaking his work was, nor that the fame he gained through his science opened so many doors to him later in life. We’re still operating under the parameters Franklin laid out for the field of electricity in the middle of the 18th Century. It’s amazing when you think about it.\n\nBut what surprised me most is what surprised Katy. I didn’t know about his son, William. I didn’t know him at all, and I definitely didn’t know how prominent he was. We know about John Quincy Adams, why don’t we know anything about William Franklin? Well, he chose the losing side in the American Revolution, which wrote him out of the popular telling of our nation’s creation story. He was the last Royal Governor of New Jersey and he stayed loyal to King George III, which made him public enemy number one to the self-proclaimed Patriots of the United States. But William loved America; he just saw a different future for his country than his father did.\n\nSome think Franklin was America’s greatest diplomat. What were his accomplishments?\n\nDavid: Ken would say there’s no question he’s the greatest because without Franklin’s diplomatic work there might not even be a United States. So how could anyone top that contribution?\n\nWhen Franklin left for France at the end of 1776 to try and win French support for the American Revolution, the war was going horribly for the Americans. The British had taken New York City and were threatening to capture Philadelphia. Thomas Paine described it best when he said, “These are the times that try men’s souls.” The Americans had no money, no uniforms, no gunpowder, and the odds of victory looked very long—unless they could get the backing of England’s great rival, France.\n\nEnter Franklin off the coast of France, arriving as the beloved, international celebrity who had tamed lightning. He was immensely popular in Paris, and he used that to his country’s advantage. But his mission — to lobby the French monarchy to supply America’s republican rebellion — was a tall order to say the least. With patience, delicacy, and discretion, Franklin wore down the powers that were at Versailles. He and his colleagues initially secured clandestine aid in the form of money, uniforms, firearms, ammunition, and supplies. And then, after the great American battlefield victory at Saratoga, Franklin secured a formal Treaty of Alliance with France in 1778.\n\nWithout that Treaty of Alliance, there would have been no Battle of Yorktown. Washington’s Continental Army and American militias were there in force, armed and supplied to a significant degree via French aid, but so were the French Army and the French Navy — who together outnumbered the Americans. Franklin’s work in Paris got them there.\n\nAfter Yorktown, Franklin was part of the delegation that secured the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which ended the Revolutionary War and officially secured American Independence. Those negotiations were conducted in Paris behind the French monarchy’s back, and Franklin somehow managed to get away with the betrayal without souring the relationship. The Americans got just about everything they wanted from the peace arrangements, and the final treaty set the course for the future history of the United States.\n\nKaty: Part of what was driving Americans away from England towards revolution was the depletion of resources from the Colonies by Britain - in exports and taxation. And what Franklin does, really, is get all the funds and resources for the American Revolution from France. He already had years of experience representing the interest of colonies to Parliament and the King of England, as well as having traveled and being familiar with different modes and norms in different cultures, and he goes to France already famous and with an international reputation. He is well received and comfortable traveling in different social circles. And this all goes over well in France, he is popular, and he is a very good representation of America in France, and he gets badly needed resources and support from France for Washington and his army.\n\nYou credit Franklin with this ability to change his mind, to recognize he was wrong. Can you give examples?\n\nKaty: My favorite Franklin aphorism may be, “The wise and brave dares own he was wrong.” As a young man, Franklin had a list of virtues he tried to uphold, and would keep track and note when he fell short. He was willing to see himself as flawed, but through a lens of how he might be better. Maybe this comes in part from his work as a printer, and the practice of making corrections both to the writing and in the ‘errata’ when something was incorrect in a publication. It is also a very science-minded approach to seeing the world that he applied to his hypotheses and inventions - often building upon the work done by others for his own inspiration and expecting that others might provide improvements to build upon his designs.\n\nBut I think it is really important to consider how his views changed about other people. He enslaved and published advertisements for enslaved people in his paper and published some really ugly words about people of color. Listening to public thinkers, family and friends, and being open to other experiences and ideas, he changed his mind, he acknowledged he was wrong, and he eventually became president of an abolitionist society in Pennsylvania. I think it is really important to look at him as an example – not to pardon early problems or to give too much credit to his conversion – but to remind ourselves to strive to be better, more tolerant and admit when we are wrong.\n\nDavid: I also like the Poor Richard aphorism Katy quoted because owning error is the first step to self-improvement. There’s so much evidence in our recent history of the ill-gotten personal success that can come from doubling down on mistakes and lies, but Franklin offers another model. You can do more good for more people if you’re open to change. And in our day and generation, we can be more patient and welcoming than we often are to those in the process of changing their minds. Shaming does not convince as easily as shepherding or offering a good example. Franklin preferred the Socratic Method where you ask questions until your partner in dialogue finds the error in their reasoning, and maybe that’s the best approach. For me, the patience and empathy of people I respect has given me the runway to become a better person. I have been wrong a lot in this life, and I know there are things I’m wrong about now. But the only way for us to improve is to make room for ourselves and for others to learn and to grow.\n\nWhy did it take Franklin so long to recognize that slavery was wrong?\n\nDavid: I can’t know for sure, but I suspect Franklin knew slavery was wrong all along. I grew up hearing that the Founders didn’t know the evils of slavery, but that just doesn’t make sense to me. They had to know because they lived with it intimately. They were born into a society with an economy that revolved around slavery, and many were not willing to give that up because it was what they knew and they were doing just fine in that system. All generations struggle to break from accepted customs and ways of life even though they know them to be immoral. When Franklin was living in Philadelphia and relying on slave labor, he had to think about slavery and enslaved people daily. If enslaved laborers did his laundry or made his food or worked in his print shop, he interacted with them all the time and knew them and their humanity on a personal level. So to me, I don’t think it’s that he learned slavery was wrong, but that his lived experience made him realize it was a wrong he could no longer tolerate.\n\nIt could be that his time in London and Paris — cities that did not wholly rely on race-based, inherited chattel slavery to function — proved society could manage in alternate systems. Or maybe his intellectual circles in Europe or Philadelphia increased his appetite for antislavery rhetoric. But at some point, when he was no longer personally reliant on slave labor and when abolitionism was beginning to show its strength on both sides of the Atlantic, Franklin joined the abolitionists. It mattered for the movement that he did. When Benjamin Franklin gave his name and his clout, he bolstered the antislavery cause.\n\nI take Franklin’s changing relationship to slavery as an opportunity to ask myself whether there are immoral systems today that I accept or exploit. Can I give them up? Can I speak out against them? And what could the alternatives be? Franklin asked those questions of himself, and I think we all can too.\n\nKaty: Franklin lived in Philadelphia when he enslaved people in his own home. The city was founded by Quakers and had a strong cultural emphasis on tolerance and acceptance that was much broader-minded than in other parts of the colonies. He knew activists like Benjamin Lay who were very openly antislavery, and he published their work. During her life, his wife Deborah supported the education of Black children, and encouraged her husband to visit a school in Philadelphia dedicated to that purpose. Franklin had been an indentured laborer himself, and ran away from his apprenticeship, which was illegal and dangerous. There is ample evidence as to why and how he might have changed his mind and his actions earlier in his life, and I am not sure any answer can really satisfy as to why he hadn’t sooner.\n\nIn a letter he wrote just before he died, he harkened back to the length of time people had been trying to end slavery in America, mentioning both publications he printed and abolitionist publications from before he was born. He was writing in support of abolition, but even in his support, he doubted its success. I still find encouragement in knowing there have always been people standing up for what is right in spite of pervasive wrongs, and appreciate Franklin quoting Bacon, “a good motion never dies.”\n\n“To John Wright, Philadelphia, Nov. 4, 1789.\n\nI wish success to your endeavours for obtaining an abolition of the Slave Trade. The epistle from your yearly meeting for the year 1758 was not the first sowing of the good seed you mention; for I find by an old pamphlet in my possession that George Keith near 100 years since wrote a paper against the practice, said to be “given forth by the appointment of the meeting held by him at Phillip James’s house in the city of Philadelphia, about the year 1693,” wherein a strict charge was given to Friends that they should set their negroes at liberty after some reasonable time of service, &c. &c. And about the year 1728 or 29 I myself printed a book for Ralph Sandyford, another of your friends of this city, against keeping negroes in slavery, two editions of which he distributed gratis. And about the year 1736 I printed another book on the same subject for Benjamin Lay, who also professed being one of your Friends, and he distributed the books chiefly among them. By these instances it appears that the seed was indeed sown in the good ground of your profession, though much earlier than the time you mention; and its springing up to effect at last, though so late, is some confirmation of Lord Bacon’s observation that a good motion never dies, and may encourage us in making such, though hopeless of their taking an immediate effect.”\n\nDavid, you grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia, and worked in Colonial Williamsburg. How did that influence your take on Franklin and on history overall?\n\nDavid: I lived in Williamsburg, Virginia, from my earliest memory until I graduated high school. On the Virginia Peninsula — the land between the James and York Rivers off Chesapeake Bay — history was on display everywhere. My house was four miles from Jamestown, the first permanent British settlement in what became the Thirteen Colonies, and ten miles from Yorktown, where those colonies won Independence to officially become the United States. We were also about 25 miles from Old Point Comfort, where the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia.\n\nBut the site on the Peninsula that was the biggest part of my daily life was two miles from home at Virginia’s pre-Revolutionary capital, Colonial Williamsburg. Their slogan when I was a kid was “Where History Comes to Life,” and I ate it up. My elementary school’s playground shared a brick wall with the Governor’s Palace at Colonial Williamsburg, and we took field trips to the historic area all the time. Outside of school and throughout my childhood, I worked in Colonial Williamsburg — mostly taking on the character of a 1770s child or playing the fife in the Colonial Williamsburg Fifes and Drums Corps. I got to inhabit a version of 18th-Century America; I walked it, I heard it, I smelled it.\n\nThat experience definitely helped when making Benjamin Franklin, but there was a lot more to learn or to relearn. Working on this documentary made clear that history is everywhere, even when it isn’t interpreted in such an immersive way as it was in my hometown. But it was also a reminder that Colonial Williamsburg is a special place. We would have struggled to make this film if they hadn’t opened their doors and allowed us to film in their print shop, their blacksmith, their residences, coffeeshop, and jail (gaol).\n\nI was really lucky to have all that history at my fingertips, but history is all around us everywhere. In your town or in its vicinity, humans have lived, died, suffered, and thrived for centuries. You can learn a lot about your present by connecting with your past. I did, and I wish that opportunity for everyone."
