        "meta_description": "Fred Zinnemann, Austrian-born American movie director whose films were distinguished by realism of atmosphere and characterization and were often grounded in crises of conscience. They included High Noon (1952), From Here to Eternity (1953), A Man for All Seasons (1966), The Day of the Jackal (1973), and Julia (1977).",

        "text": "Films of the late 1930s and 1940s\n\nZinnemann’s first assignments for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), with which he signed in 1937, were installments in the Crime Does Not Pay series and short subjects such as That Mothers Might Live (1938), a study of 19th-century Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweiz’s pioneering efforts in hospital sanitization, which won an Academy Award for best one-reel short subject. The director’s first B-films for the studio were Kid Glove Killer (1942), a mystery that starred Van Heflin as a police chemist who solves a murder, and Eyes in the Night (also 1942), in which Edward Arnold played a blind detective. The Seventh Cross (1944) followed; a taut thriller, it featured Spencer Tracy as one of seven escapees from a concentration camp in Nazi Germany.\n\nMGM then assigned Zinnemann to Little Mister Jim (1946) and My Brother Talks to Horses (1947), a pair of comedic vehicles for child star Butch Jenkins. Zinnemann’s next project, The Search (1948), was considerably more prestigious. The first film shot in Germany following the conclusion of World War II, it was the moving story of an American soldier (played by Montgomery Clift, in his second film) stationed in Berlin who tries to adopt a nine-year-old concentration-camp survivor and apparent orphan whose mother is scouring the war-torn city hoping to find him. Ivan Jandl, the nonprofessional actor who played the orphan, received a a special Academy Award, and Zinnemann (best director) and Clift (best actor) also were nominated. Act of Violence (1949) was much darker. In it Robert Ryan played a disabled army veteran who seeks revenge on a former officer who betrayed his platoon while being held as a prisoner of war.\n\nFilms of the 1950s\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nThe Men (1950), written by Carl Foreman and produced by Stanley Kramer, also dealt with crippled war veterans, but this time the emphasis was not on vengeance but on the long, laborious process of healing. Marlon Brando, in his film debut, gave a powerhouse performance as a paraplegic vet whose bitterness over his injury threatens to poison the entire ward and drive away his loyal fiancée (Teresa Wright). Zinnemann’s next film, Teresa (1951)—the story of an Italian war bride who encounters prejudice when she accompanies her U.S. soldier husband home—introduced another set of Hollywood newcomers, Pier Angeli (in the title role), Rod Steiger, and Ralph Meeker.\n\nAnother Kramer production, the distinctly unconventional westernHigh Noon (1952), proved to be one of Zinnemann’s most prominent contributions to film history. In one of his most iconic roles, an aging Gary Cooper played a highly principled town marshal whose retirement and wedding (to Grace Kelly) are interrupted by the imminent return of a notorious gunman seeking revenge on the marshal, who had sent him to prison. Unlike the typical marshal in a movie western, Cooper’s Will Kane, anxious, conflicted, and afraid, seeks help from his deputy and other townspeople only to be left to face the threat on his own. (This desertion under pressure was widely interpreted as analogous to the behaviour of some in the Hollywood community during the era of the House Un-American Activities Committee’s investigation of communist activity.) Unbowed, Kane, a man of conscience, stays to fulfill what he sees as his responsibility rather than fleeing. Partly because Cooper had a bleeding ulcer during filming and was in excruciating pain, the anguish the marshal suffers is palpable throughout the 85 minutes of the story’s fictional action, which corresponds directly to the film’s running time, a device that is used to exciting effect. Cooper’s memorable performance earned him an Academy Award for best actor, and Zinnemann’s direction, Foreman’s screenplay, and the film all were nominated.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

It used five members of the original cast, including Julie Harris, Ethel Waters, and Brandon deWilde.\n\nZinnemann’s next project, From Here to Eternity (1953), the screen version of James Jones’s enormously successful best seller about a group of U.S. soldiers in Hawaii on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack, was among the most-anticipated film releases of the early 1950s. The star-studded cast included Clift as a rebellious private, Frank Sinatra as his charming but luckless wise-guy buddy, Burt Lancaster as their sympathetic sergeant, Deborah Kerr as the sergeant’s mistress and wife of his commanding officer, and Ernest Borgnine as the loathsome military jailer Fatso. The film was a huge hit and won eight Academy Awards, including best picture, best director (Zinnemann), best supporting actor (Sinatra), best supporting actress (Donna Reed as Clift’s love interest), best screenplay (Daniel Taradash), and best black-and-white cinematography (Burnett Guffey). Clift and Lancaster were also nominated, for best actor, as was Kerr, for best actress.\n\nZinnemann chose to film Oklahoma! (1955), his adaptation of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II’s hit 1943 Broadway musical of the same name, on location in Arizona. The most expensive musical produced to that time, Oklahoma! was a departure from Zinnemann’s usual fare, but he was well served by leads Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones, and the film was generally successful with audiences and critics alike. More in the vein of Zinnemann’s usual subject matter was the low-budget, high-intensity drama A Hatful of Rain (1957), which starred Don Murray as a heroin addict whose pain is shared by his wife (Eva Marie Saint) and brother (Anthony Franciosa). Zinnemann then began what seemed a perfect project for a director of his sensibility—adapting Ernest Hemingway’s novel The Old Man and the Sea. In the midst of filming, however, he withdrew, leaving The Old Man and the Sea (1958), with Spencer Tracy, to be finished by John Sturges, who received the directing credit. Zinnemann’s last film of the decade, the earnest and probing The Nun’s Story (1959), starred Audrey Hepburn in an Academy Award-nominated (for best actress) portrayal of a nun who braves the terrors of a mental hospital in Belgium, the rigours of the Belgian Congo, and the brutality of the Nazis before finally leaving her order to join the Resistance. Zinnemann (best director) and the film were also nominated for Academy Awards."
