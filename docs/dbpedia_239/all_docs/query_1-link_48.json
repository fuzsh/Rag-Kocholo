        "text": "I’m going to cover other aspects of film in additional top one hundred lists, but the very final list that will analyze actual films as a whole is this one here. Short films have their own forms of constraint: you have to attract viewers, get points across, and have all ideas come to fruition in a limited amount of time. What is that duration, you may ask? Well, different institutions, companies, critics, and academics will have their own specifications, but I follow the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science rules: any work that is forty minutes or less constitutes as a short film, and anything longer is a feature.\n\nSome other regulations are as follows. I have covered “featurettes” — an older term used for the films in between shorts (one to two reels) and features (five or more) from the early days of cinema — in my ‘30s list, so you won’t find the films that made that list here. I also won’t have anything before 1920 here, since those have been covered in my list of one hundred important early films (anything from 1878 to 1919), but rest assured that you will find some silent classics here. Otherwise, anything is fair game. Live action, animation, and documentary shorts will all be found here. I didn’t include shorts in any of my other lists, so all sorts of works will be here. As long as these films are forty minutes or less, they can apply here.\n\nWhat I will say is that you will find some great short stories, animated blips, or short subject documentaries, but you will also see that this list will contain the most amounts of experimental works out of any that I have written. Avant-garde filmmakers could really create their own worlds in these shorts, and you’ll find that many of their results are impossible to ignore. Nonetheless, whether these works are strange, normal, illustrated, vérité, concise or expansive, they are all incredible, and worthy of being spotlighted for a multitude of reasons. Here are the best one hundred short films of all time.\n\n99. The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes\n\nThe works of Stan Brakhage are largely interpretational, but something like The Act of Seeing with One’s Own Eyes feels a little bit more direct, especially with the dissections of real corpses at a morgue. You can view the morbid side of things, as these are all souls that have ended; these bodies are now not meant to be lived in, but rather explored now as artifacts. I think Brakhage would have opted for something more profound, like how the internal mechanisms of the human body is a work of art. Back in 1971, there weren’t many opportunities to see the insides of ourselves in such a way, but The Act of Seeing with One’s Own Eyes is still a fantastic analysis of biology fifty years later.\n\n98. Your Face\n\nBill Plumpton’s animated exercise Your Face is all about the science of cinematic juxtapositions. A ballad is sung by a sketched man, whose face distorts and transforms into a variety of nightmarish incarnations, which makes the song sound a little haunting (more than endearing); this is when you may realize that the vocals are actually slowed down to the point of a slight warping (they’re actually by Maureen McElheron). It’s only three or so minutes long, but Your Face is mightily impactful; how can something this meaningful be this, well, unnerving? I personally find this short sweet, as if it embraces all of the good and the occasional bad within a loving relationship; for better or for worse, and in sickness and in health, right?\n\n97. The Seahorse\n\nLike any other work by Jean Painlevé, The Seahorse is more or less just an educational documentary, but it’s the way that he made his films that make them special. We get just a quarter of an hour to look at how seahorses live, survive, and get made. It’s as rudimentary as a documentary can be. However, each and every lesson gets turned into a brilliant excuse to just watch more of The Seahorse’s breathtaking cinematography, as we cannot fathom what the next step will look like. Using seahorses — one of the prettiest species of fish out there — as the focal point also doesn’t hurt, as Painlevé uses their illuminated bodies to make dazzling artworks against the pitch black backdrops of the ocean floor.\n\n96. The Big Shave\n\nBefore Martin Scorsese took off as one of the greatest auteurs in American film history, he was already showing what he could do with the excessively graphic short The Big Shave. This is an exercise in tension and patience, as we watch a gentleman willingly decimate his own face by shaving too deeply. How much can we take as viewers? Well, Scorsese seemed to cap out the audience’s tolerance back in 1967 at about six minutes long, but maybe the viewers of today’s desensitized would could go for longer. For what it’s worth, Scorsese displayed how much he could do with so little, even before he had a chance to prove himself.\n\n88. Day & Night\n\nPixar excels at its three dimensional animation; ever since Toy Story changed the animation medium, every studio has followed suit ever since, without quite comparing with the prestigious company. However, if Pixar was to ever indulge in two dimensional projects, Day & Night is probably as close as they will ever get. Two silhouettes are made up of different dimensions that contrast those of the other; not only do we have a wholesome show, but we also get some interesting visual contrasts to boot. It might not be apparent at first, but Day & Night is Pixar’s declaration of the studio’s mastering of the cinematic medium, showing that they understand the relationships between visuals and sounds in this aesthetic showcase.\n\n87. Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life\n\nWhat two natures can go better together than the wholesome emotions of Frank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life, and the unorthodox works of literary giant Franz Kafka? Amalgamate both worlds together, and you get the wittily named Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life: starring the only person who could be as charming as he is baffling, Richard E. Grant. Grant plays Kafka, who is experiencing writer’s block when working on The Metamorphosis (this title is especially relevant); so, he learns to embrace the conventional as a means of finishing a project, in one of the strangest dilemmas ever put to screen. The biggest oddity is that this is all the work of one Peter Capaldi, otherwise known to many as “the Doctor”, who actually won an Oscar for this experiment.\n\n86. The Inner Eye\n\nSatyajit Ray is a master of cinema in all aspects, so it only makes sense that even a short film of his would be worthy of celebration. The Inner Eye is a powerful documentary about modern art legend Benode Behari, who went completely blind. We get a synopsis of his career and influence on British Indian art, as well as a capturing of who he was when the film was made. Interestingly enough, The Inner Eye is both a podium for the artist to express himself in a whole new way, as well as a metaphysical reincarnation of his art — in a whole new way — for audiences across the world.\n\n81. The Way Things Go\n\nWith the use of websites like YouTube and other content holding platforms, the idea of a Rube Goldberg machine is not a foreign one; we’ve seen these never ending systems used as GIF images, endless loops, and even music videos. Still, there’s something special when such a creation is shot cinematically (rather than by one’s smartphone, let’s say), and the half hour The Way Things Go is one particularly magnificent example. Created in a way that you get a statement on industrialism and the banality of working hard over smartly, The Way Things Go is as meaningful as it is entertaining. Out of any art film of this nature, this one is one of the greats.\n\n80. The Heart of the World\n\nGuy Maddin’s fixation on silent cinema has always translated into his works, with some examples being more blatant than others. When it comes to the six minute The Heart of the World, this fascination is on full display. Feeling like a throwback to Metropolis with society’s split between its heart and mind (in various metaphorical ways), The Heart of the World is still full of Maddin’s eccentricities, and it feels like a historical artifact from a completely different dimension. Furthermore, Maddin is all about cinema first and foremost, hence his constant reworking of the medium’s various forms of old and new. The finale here is one that feels dear to him as a filmmaker, and transcendent of the very art form he continuously seeks to destroy.\n\n77. Luxo Jr.\n\nOn one hand, Luxo Jr. is far from the greatest achievement of Pixar; its two minute story of a “parent” desk lamp and the titular “child” lamp can only tell so much. However, it’s the amount of work put into this short (which is one of the firsts of its kind, and the bar placement truly mattered) that makes this film so extraordinary. See Luxo Jr. less of a story and more like the experiment that it is, and you’ll see what I mean. Remember this is from 1986 when you notice the precise details on both lamps, the natural flow of their cables, and the usage of these appliances as a clever light source on a round object (the round ball Luxo Jr. plays with). You see CGI animation being pushed to its limits here, with shadows, reflections, movement, and just enough of a narrative to show how brilliant this then-new studio was bound to be.\n\n73. Wasp\n\nBefore Sean Baker was displaying impoverished areas of America that needed light shed on them, Andrea Arnold was serving a similar purpose over in Britain with her zeitgeist-churning short Wasp. Arnold’s powerful first project is more of an exhibition of the uphill battles of the lower class than an explicit story. A single mother, trying to provide for her four kids whilst still continue her own life as a young woman, is trying her best to juggle throughout these twenty six minutes. The titular wasp lingers around like the angel of death, or the weight of debt, or the nagging of responsibility, as it aims to strike at just the most effective moment. Arnold places us in a difficult position: is this a terrible mom, or is she deserving of a new life just as much as her kids are? The wasp, too, is trapped and awaiting freedom, and handling adversity poorly. Wasp is short, yet so effective.\n\n71. Rejected\n\nDon Hertzfeldt inadvertently helped make internet meme culture what it was when his absurd animated statement Rejected became the P2P viral sensation it was born to be. All walks of life were being shown this video file of spoons being too big, the betrayal of a silly hats club, and a “fish stick” with a bleeding anus. Were these actually proposed advertising bits that were tossed out and unloved? Luckily not: Hertzfeldt is extremely against this kind of promotional sellout behaviour. It was a message about the death of artistry within business. Part of this once mysterious short was a series of laughs that shaped all of us when the internet was still this endless playground of possibility. Rejected’s finale is a meta decimation of the animated medium that caves in on itself: what is unwanted by all is technically nonexistent.\n\n66. At Land\n\nOnce Maya Deren was onto her third film At Land, she was experiencing an identity crisis: who am I, and how am I representing myself through my art? She is washed up on the shore at the start of this short, unaware of how she got there. She finds new people and versions of herself, and cannot place a finger on how she knows (or if she knows) any of them. At Land isn’t an exploration as much as it is the aftermath of the years of one’s life that have just zipped past. In her signature groundbreaking surreal style, At Land is another Deren triumph: this authentically feels like a dream that has been captured on celluloid somehow, and Deren has gifted it to us to make our own.\n\n62. Land Without Bread\n\nIf you look at how prolific Luis Buñuel was as a director, it will feel strange to know that he had stopped directing for fourteen years between the ‘30s and ‘40s. His final release in the first phase of his career is the ethnofiction statement Land Without Bread, where Buñuel took the impoverished conditions of the streets of Spain and mixed them with his surreal creations. The result is a nightmarish look at systemic imbalances, as if one of Buñuel’s insane visions was a part of our reality (I’d argue that real life is much, much worse). Even after the break in his filmography, Buñuel would all but ease up on his disdain for the upper class from here on out.\n\n61. The Phone Call\n\nThere are a number of recent shorts that miss the mark with what concise storytelling they could get away with (usually, not enough character building is done, or the build up to one specific, obvious scene feels forced). One of the much better examples is the Oscar winning film by Mat Kirby called The Phone Call. You only ever see one side of the conversation between a crisis hotline worker and a widower on the verge of committing suicide; you're left wondering and fearing the same thoughts that the counsellor is experiencing, and you can only read her true feelings through her expressions. There’s enough hidden or subliminal information that makes The Phone Call even more moving than it already is.\n\n57. The Lunch Date\n\nI adore shorts where an entire story, world, and lifetimes can be established in as little time as possible. The Lunch Date is the kind of film that is shown in film school to present concise and effective writing, and it’s easy to see why. In twelve minutes, we have two characters displayed (a judgmental woman who has missed her train, and a guy just wanting to have his lunch). We’re given a predicament: the man appears to have stolen the woman’s salad, and he is completely guiltless. By the twist at the end, you’ll feel like you've known these two for ages. Many feature films can’t figure it out in over one hundred minutes. The Lunch Date needn’t much time at all to stick.\n\n52. Talking Heads\n\nIt’s amazing what the best simple premises can achieve. Krzysztof Kieslowski had one motive when making Talking Heads: to see how different answers to the same questions can be if you ask various generations. He asked a handful of participants (from young to one hundred years old) what they desired to achieve with their lives. The kids dream big, but the elderly look back and analyze how it all went (for better or for worse). Every age in between is all over the map. Talking Heads is so basic in its hypothesis, but its end results are an exquisite look at the different perceptions of time, what is valuable in life, and when our ambitions for ourselves will change.\n\n51. The House Is Black\n\nEven short films can be difficult to finish, and you will find a number of examples on this list. One such case is The House Is Black, where the leprosy crisis in Tebriz is put on full display. There is anger towards the neglect that society around Tebriz exhibits towards these sufferers, but also hope in religion. Still, the lack of help for these lives being featured without any hinderances was surely the wake up call that many people needed back in 1963. Forugh Farrokhzad was on her way to becoming one of Iran’s greatest cinematic voices, when she tragically died young in a car accident. The House Is Black was only a hint of what was to come, and even then she delivered one of the great documentary shorts.\n\n49. Illusions\n\nA major topic of the film industry is the lack of diversity, which has clearly been a major problem for, well, the entire duration of cinema. Jump forty years ago to Julie Dash’s Illusions, which is also a flashback to forty years before during the Golden Age of Hollywood, and that’s eighty years of problematic history in just analyzing this film alone (going even further back would only result in more prejudicial horrors). In Dash’s ingenious short, you have an African American woman who has passed off as caucasian in order to work within the film industry. The idea is that film itself is an illusion of moving pictures, but it’s a damn shame that persons of colour have to perform their own miracles in order to be recognized.\n\n48. The Music Box\n\nYou have to have at least one Laurel and Hardy classic on a list of shorts, and The Music Box may be their finest hour (well, half hour). The amount of nonsense that is derived from what is meant to be a simple installation of a player piano is endless. All of the shenanigans feel effortless as well, as if Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were able to control the speed of objects in order to have the greatest slapstick timing. When you feel like a shtick has gone far enough, some resolution will occur and surprise you, reminding you of a hurdle you felt like you had already moved away from. Yes, The Music Box is the comedy duo performing at their peak level, and not once does its hilarity let up.\n\n43. One Froggy Evening\n\nOh, what a sadistic short One Froggy Evening is, and yet it is sublime in its hilarity. Why do we enjoy the agony that the unnamed man experiences with his talented singing frog, who only sings whenever he feels like it, and when no one else is watching? Perhaps it is the irony that we can get away with hearing this frog when no one else can, and that the man is “proven” to be insane when he has done nothing wrong, that makes this evil short so amusing. It also helps that the frog has a fantastic selection of songs that we can enjoy, even if it always results in the damage of another.\n\n37. J’Attendrai le suivant…\n\nIt’s amazing what the right words can do. Anyone can be sold on an advertisement, speech, or even a haiku. One of the shortest, well, shorts on this list, J’Attendrai le suivant… establishes its setting and players at extreme speeds (its build up, climax, and resolution all exist within four minutes, credits included). A passenger is entertained by a stranger with something major to say: he wants to share his life with someone to cure the mundanity of existence. This grows into a brilliant twist, that will have you feeling like you were a part of this whole illusion. We only live once, but there will always be a next train to redirect us.\n\n31. Steamboat Willie\n\nTechnically Plane Crazy was the very first film featuring good old Mickey Mouse (particularly when he wasn’t completely innocent), but Steamboat Willie gets all of the love for being one of the first animated films with synchronized sound. Walt Disney was working with his brother Roy Oliver, as well as Ub Iwerks (the designer of Mickey himself) on this short, of which feels like a Buster Keaton work in a cartoon realm (only if Keaton was mischievous and fully expressive, mind you). Steamboat Willie is frozen in time as a logo and artifact for Disney, but the short itself is more of a product of its time, rather than entirely synonymous with the animation studio as it is now. Nonetheless, this is where the magic truly began, and it remains intriguing in both film history and Disney’s origins.\n\n28. A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness\n\nSharmeen Obaid-Chinoy has forty minutes to give us the confessions of a Pakistani girl who has been permanently disfigured and traumatized once she survives an honour killing by her own family (including her father). It’s impossible to watch A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness without feeling infuriated, even just seeing what has happened to a poor young adult with her entire life ahead of her. Furthermore, it is how society has placed her in the wrong for not forgiving her father and uncle for their attempted murder that will really send you through the roof. It’s not easy to watch A Girl in the River at all, but it is a must for all to witness and understand: injustice and double standards exist everywhere.\n\n26. Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story\n\nTodd Haynes’ first project ever is an independent film opus of epic proportions, which ushered in the second age of, well, The Carpenters. Karen Carpenter’s tragic passing from cardiac arrest (caused by her struggles with anorexia nervosa) was already grim, but there was a new perspective surrounding her entire career and death after Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story. Told entirely with Barbie dolls, and shot with the lowest quality equipment possible (which gives the film this uncomfortable feeling in 2021, especially considering its deterioration), Superstar is an inventive approach to tackling a serious topic that no Hollywood studio would be allowed to share. Considering its copyright issues and dismal nature that most services wouldn’t want to come anywhere near, Superstar is now passed around online, and each upload diminishes the quality of the film even more so. Karen’s ghost can be felt, and Superstar’s underground legacy is impossible to shake off.\n\n24. C’était un rendez-vous\n\nClaud Lelouch’s highly exhilarating short film C’était un rendez-vous is very basic in what kind of a film it is on paper: a camera is mounted onto a car that is speeding across the streets of Paris before most people are awake. The feeling is so liberating: you’ll feel like you are soaring throughout the film. Done in one shot, C’était un rendez-vous feels like it could only have either succeeded or fail; there is no second chance. You may be left wondering what it’s all for, but it won’t matter when you’re coasting at insane speeds that you may never experience in your actual life. Once you see the resolution and get that satisfying answer, C’était un rendez-vous transforms from an experience to a sensation.\n\n21. Hedgehog in the Fog\n\nFear can amplify anything around us for the worse, and Yuri Norstein’s magnum opus — the adorable and relatable Hedgehog in the Fog — knows this all too well. The titular woodland mammal is trying to find his best friend, but the inability to see around him has him lost and confronted by other beings and objects that only make this confusion worse. Despite the worst events that happen, the Hedgehog strives to keep going. Once a resolution is met, there is still the next dilemma: wondering about incidents that one has come across, which open up new doors of worry and fear. In a way, Hedgehog in the Fog is very bittersweet, and a reminder that solutions are always around the corner, but so is the next obstacle.\n\n16. Ritual in Transfigured Time\n\nTypically, Maya Deren’s works could be described as surreal, or of a dream world that feels like it can be accessible. I feel like Ritual in Transfigured Time is a little different: as if it is pulled straight out of a dimension where hours, space, and other relationships we share do not exist. Like the shattering of a film set, common performances and positions don’t apply. Dances are either combined together (to create a busy, claustrophobic environment) or become frozen in time. In every way, the concept of motion pictures gets tested: at times, the two parts cannot coexist. It may be safe to call Ritual in Transfigured Time a filmic dream, but, in reality, its true nature is far more fascinating: the disruption of what we know about cinema.\n\n15. The Hand\n\nStop motion animation is created by the tiny movements of figures (or other creations) by an artist’s hands. What would happen if the creator and their creation fight (particularly in the medium where one grants the other life)? The Hand is a sensational short by Jiří Trnka. The film is both imaginative and frightening: you won’t be able to stop feeling astonished by the creativity of the film, even during its more morbid, sadistic moments. The Hand feels like a cartoon for adults: all of the possibilities in the world, but catered to audiences that have felt backstabbed by “the man”. They say you shouldn’t ever bite the hand that feeds you, but Jiří Trnka’s opus is far more original than that maxim.\n\n14. One Week\n\nSome of the best silent films are the ones that are relatable, but the works that are metaphorically relatable yet conceptually unique are some of the finest of their time. One Week is such an example. You understand that Buster Keaton (the groom) and Sybil Seely (the bride) are newlyweds and are trying to jumpstart their life together. So, One Week presents a house that can be built in the length of time featured in the title. Of course, problems arise, and they’re all hilarious, but these are all build ups to the outrageous climax (which carries multiple punches). One Week is incredibly inventive comedy that presents its iconic stars at the top of their game.\n\n13. La cabina\n\nSo a man wants to make a quick phone call in a booth in Antonio Mercero’s La cabina. That’s that. However, he seems to be stuck inside, and all of his attempts to break out are complete failures. What starts out as a minor pesky incident turns into the darkest fears of many, as if one is buried alive and no one can help. Well, in La cabina’s case, he becomes the latest news story: he is given the wrong kind of attention. You think it stops there, but that’s only the beginning. La cabina is relentless with where it is willing to go, and its many different twists and turns are impossible to predict.\n\n12. Blood of the Beasts\n\nWhen people hear the name of Georges Franju, they think of his horror classic Eyes Without a Face. However, that is far from his scariest film. No. That honour would go to Blood of the Beasts: one of the most disturbing cinematic experiences I’ve ever had. This documentary of the unethical, torturous practices that go on in slaughterhouses is certainly not for the faint of heart, but Franju refuses to shy away from the truth that he sets out to reveal. Often listed as a reason why people have gone vegan, Blood of the Beasts is a side of the meat-eating argument that all must be aware of: this goes beyond meal preferences.\n\n9. Window Water Baby Moving\n\nStan Brakhage’s experimental shorts are known usually for their lack of sound of any sort, and that silence couldn’t be any louder than in the highly emotional journey found in Window Water Baby Moving. Brakhage films his then-wife Jane giving birth to their first daughter at home (after Brakhage was told filming wasn’t allowed in the hospital). Stan and Jane quarrelled with this idea: Jane didn’t want to really be on camera, and Stan couldn’t watch the birth without filming. The end result is a breathtaking capturing of the miracle of life. With no audio track, you can still “hear” the newborn’s cries, the gasps of relief, the cries of joy, and the wall of silence itself. Some amazing events leave rooms speechless to the point that you can hear a pin drop. Window Water Baby Moving is one of the only films to have that impossible “sound” as its score.\n\n8. The Red Balloon\n\nLive action shorts that carry their own miniature narrative worlds (and also weren’t experimental) weren’t too common after the silent era (and the comedy films of the Golden Age of Hollywood), so going back in time to find the best short story films of this nature feels a bit like a daunting task. The best example you can find is The Red Balloon, which feels like a Pixar story long before the studio was even a concept. The titular symbol is universal at this point, and the immediate draw for viewers. The unforgettable conclusion will bring you back to feeling like a child again; as for younger viewers, The Red Balloon will take them to a place of bliss they never knew existed.\n\n7. World of Tomorrow\n\nOver ten years after Rejected, Don Hertzfeldt would present us with another short (outside of the It’s Such a Beautiful Day “trilogy”) that would take the world by storm. This time, he wasn’t a part of meme culture. No. He was a highly respected filmmaker that was considered a science fiction game changer, with one of the most touching depictions of isolation in recent filmic memory. World of Tomorrow features his usual quirks (this time, the joyful ramblings of a young child are turned into a futuristic world), but it also places his awareness of existential dread and the beauty of devastation right at the forefront. You may giggle at first, but World of Tomorrow may possibly have you feeling more seen than any other film lately has.\n\n4. La Jetée\n\nChris Marker is a world renowned film essayist, whose documentaries and think pieces are untouchable. However, he was also a photographer and writer first, and that plays into the greatest narrative he ever created. La Jetée is a short story told almost entirely with still images, yet they all feel like they have movement in your mind. A picture can say a thousand words, so this tome of context tells the story of a Paris after a hypothetical third World War. Time travel is possible, and the world is in a huge disarray even outside of this capability. At the heart of this miasma is a story of love, and Marker’s sci-fi romance is one of the greatest takes of adoration in cinematic history.\n\n1. Meshes of the Afternoon\n\nAlexander Hammid had worked on a few films by the time his then-wife Maya Deren had come up with her first cinematic project: Meshes of the Afternoon. They both star in the film together, and they were both behind the camera as well as co-directors. This was Deren’s child through and through, as she wrote, produced, and edited the film entirely herself. She desired to tell the story of a never ending dream that couldn’t be broken no matter how many times one woke up; reality could barely play a part in this vision. Told without sound, Meshes of the Afternoon only had its visuals to guide us. Deren opted to take us into the deepest corridors of our psyche.\n\nA variety of clues are left in this repetitive cycle of images, where a different path or amount of ground covered is explored each and every new version of the story. Still, there isn't any concrete certainty in Meshes of the Afternoon. What you get instead is the experience of an alternate reality crammed into fifteen minutes: the knowledge that there is this endless loop of unconsciousness, death, discovery, mysticism, and rebirth. On the topic of reincarnation, Meshes of the Afternoon was gifted new life by an added score by experimental musician Teiji Ito in 1959; Ito was Deren’s last husband until her death, and this unique circle of the film’s origin (Hammid) and its conclusion (Ito) is coincidentally reflective of the theme of endlessness and rediscovery through the familiar in the film.\n\nThe rest is history. Meshes of the Afternoon’s fractured storytelling, unnatural existences, and astounding vagueness has affected so many filmmakers and artists that dared to go further. The mirror-faced reaper alone has been referenced often, even in Janelle Monáe’s “Tightrope” music video (amongst other sources); the mainstream has also been blessed by Deren’s innovations. The film itself was made right in the middle of Hollywood’s quest to tell bigger, longer, and more ambitious stories. Here was a short that was even ten percent the length of other opuses at the time, but with all of the spark, scale, and everlasting effect of these larger works. All it took was a brilliant artistic mind, and that’s exactly what Deren had when she created Meshes of the Afternoon: the greatest short film of all time."
