        "text": "You’d have to be living under a rock to not just be unfamiliar with, but not have an understanding of, the game-changing HBO series, The Sopranos. The series not only shaped the foundation of almost every drama series airing today but remains, in my humble opinion, the most influential and greatest television series of all time.\n\nWith a series this important to the landscape of television, it’s a surprise that there had yet to be an inside-look documentary on the series and the individuals involved in creating this masterclass of television. As the series turns 25 this year, that longing for a documentary is no more with the release of Alex Gibney’s Wise Guy: David Chase and The Sopranos. A film that captivates cinephiles with an in-depth look at the uniqueness of the show and its creator David Chase.\n\nWise Guy: David Chase and The Sopranos chronicles David Chase’s journey, from his childhood to his early days of hustling and bustling in television, and his desire to direct a feature film inspired by his relationship with his mother that ultimately turned into The Sopranos. From the seat where Tony Soprano and Jennifer Melfi spoke weekly about Tony’s relationships, Chase’s therapy sessions dive into his creative process and meticulous attention to detail, which, while effective, would sometimes be a turn-off to members of the Sopranos team.\n\nThe term “understood the assignment” is often used to describe various entities, and it feels right to describe Alex Gibney’s direction on Wise Guy: David Chase and The Sopranos as someone who understood the assignment. His direction encapsulates the legacy of the series with his seamless use of interviews with key cast members, archival footage, and behind-the-scenes clips that create an in-depth and rich analysis. In doing so, Gibney is able to mirror the dynamic visual style The Sopranos offered on a weekly basis.\n\nThe film doesn’t shy away from diving into some of the off-set troubles that hit James Gandolfini and, unfortunately, his untimely death. While it’s hard not to shed a tear during those moments, Gibney brings the audience back in with the great actor and human being Gandolfini was, and the kind gesture he gave his cast members towards the final season of the show.\n\nI am quite confident that any fan who dives into this documentary will want answers to the series finale. A finale that I still consider one of the greatest of all time. While Chase doesn’t offer a full yes or no to Tony’s outcome, he discusses the inspiration for not just the final sequence but the entire episode, and that inspiration comes in the form of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nIf there is a deterrent, it may be the film’s near 2.5-hour run time, and what may be thorough to some may lag for others. Familiarity with The Sopranos is required, so the film may not create new fans, but it sure will spark the fire for fans to revisit this magnum opus.\n\nWise Guy: David Chase and The Sopranos never loses focus on its goal: providing THE in-depth celebration of television’s most groundbreaking series. So next time you watch shows like Breaking Bad, Succession, or the latest dramatic mini-series, realize that none of those would exist without The Sopranos and its continued enduring influence on media and pop culture."
