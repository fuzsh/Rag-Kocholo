        "text": "In this article we present the list of 12 Countries That Produce the Best Movies in the World. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Countries That Produce the Best Movies in the World.\n\nThe United States, India, and Japan rank near the top of the list of the countries that produce the best movies in the world according to moviegoers the world over.\n\nThe global box office has sagged in recent years given the Covid-19 pandemic shuttering movie theaters across the globe as well as the rise of streaming services like Netflix. The movie industry has also been surpassed by the gaming industry in total revenue in recent years.\n\nGlobal box office revenue slumped to $11.8 billion in 2020, before rebounding to $21.3 billion last year. Despite that 80% rise, ticket sales in 2021 were still just half what they were in 2019 before the pandemic hit.\n\nWhen it comes to movie producing countries, the United States has been far and away the global leader for decades. According to data compiled by The Numbers, the U.S. has produced nearly 23,000 movies that have earned over $609 billion at the box office. That’s 5x more movies produced and 11x the revenue generated than any other country.\n\nDoes that mean the United States should automatically top the list of the countries that produce the best movies in the world? Finding a fair methodology to rank the best movie-producing countries is challenging given the disparity between different countries in the number of movies produced, which for the most part leads to the top movie producing countries inevitably producing the most standout movies as well. And we didn’t want this list to simply be a rehash of which countries have the biggest movie industries.\n\nBy the same token, ranking which countries produce the best movies based solely on one or a few standout movies, if using for instance the number of Oscar wins for best international film, also doesn’t seem overly accurate. A country could produce one great movie that takes home the award, but little else of substance, while another country could produce a number of high-quality movies but not have that one big winner.\n\nGiven the entirely subjective nature of which movies are best, we decided to turn to the people instead and let them have their say. This methodology is by no means perfect either, and the data can be tainted in a number of ways, but in general it gives a good representation of which countries produce movies that people from all parts of the world want to see.\n\nBefore we get to the countdown, we loaded up OpenAI’s artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, to find out what questions people ask about the movie industry and then recorded the associated answers to those questions.\n\nQuestion 1: Which countries have the largest and most successful film industries?\n\nChatGPT’s Answer: There are a number of countries that have large and successful film industries, including:\n\nUnited States: The U.S. film industry is one of the largest and most successful in the world, and generates significant revenue from the production, distribution, and exhibition of films and television shows.
