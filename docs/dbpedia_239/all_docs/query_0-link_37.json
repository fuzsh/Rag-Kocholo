        "text": "Oh, and in 1997 they were both, of course, in L.A. Confidential. Apart from that, they are like chalk and cheese. Guy Pearce doesn't work out, preferring stretching and yoga. He seems to quite enjoy nattering to journalists and lives quietly at home in Melbourne with Kate, his wife of five years, a dog and two cats rather than roaring on down to Malibu to romance his latest co-star (most recently, in Crowe's case, Meg Ryan).\n\nPearce laughs at how different they are. 'It's all about different energies. I'm not interested in the big summer blockbuster stuff. The whole saga and scenario that goes along with Hollywood, I don't feel I have the energy to get into that. I feel a lot more comfortable doing intimate type things. I have a little place in West Hollywood but I don't have the inclination to deal with uprooting and going to Los Angeles. I get to feeling so anxious there it drives me mad.\n\nLike Memento, his new film, written and directed by Londoner Christopher Nolan (his first film was Following). Made in Pasadena, Los Angeles, Memento is about a man called Leonard Shelby, who is suffering from a rare case of memory loss. Pearce is Shelby, who looks like a cool blond Californian casualty, until you strip him down to find his body is tattoed with aide memoires and his pockets stuffed with polaroids of people with captions saying things like 'do not trust this man'. It is not easy to track down your wife's killer when you've lost your memory.\n\nWe met at the American Film Festival in Deauville, France, where Memento won the International Critics' Award, to talk about memory and other things. 'Since doing this film I've questioned the whole memory thing a lot more,' says Pearce. 'I have real paranoia about my own memory. I don't know if it's because my mother told me that my father, who passed away when I was just eight, had a real photographic memory.\n\nPearce was also pushing another film at the festival, the big studio picture Rules Of Engagement, co-starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson, in which he plays a military lawyer. He remarks that he's disappointed with the film, as they changed the ending from the original script to please test audiences. It was not the film he set out to make. Hence his preference for smaller, more intimate films like Memento. 'Every now and again you get a script that is delightfully different and inspirational, but often it's given to a director who has made some iffy films and you don't quite trust the hands the script is being placed in. The Memento script is exactly as you see in the finished film, Chris (Nolan) being both writer and director. I was practically jumping up and down in my seat when I read it and when I saw it. And it is also my first film that goes backwards. See it yourself and see how it progresses!'\n\nPearce is an unflashy guy with gentlemanly manners and a neat physique packaged inconspicuously into jeans and a grey V-neck. No longer the blond Leonard Shelby, his hair is now short, dark and bitty from too many Napoleonic wigs being gummed on while playing the dastardly Fernand Mondego in his new film, The Count Of Monte Cristo, with Jim (Thin Red Line) Cavaziel in the title role. 'At the start of Monte Cristo you see me sort of young and fresh, but I turn into a pompous, pretentious dandy,' says Pearce. 'The period called for the pre-muttonchop hairdo look and varnished nails.' He flashes a hand with suspiciously long nails for a bloke. 'False, all false, but you'll notice the nails on my left hand, the \"neck\" hand, are shorter so I can still play the guitar, but I don't play very well at the best of times - even though I have a small studio at home in Melbourne where I record demos and write songs.\n\n'In Australia, before Priscilla, I was best known as a musical theatre actor. Music is still very much part of my life. It'd be great to do a concert one day. I got a bit of practice last year playing a singer-songwriter who Lili Taylor falls for in an independent film called A Slipping Down Life. I could really understand that character, in contrast to some of the other films I've made.'\n\nAfter he'd wooed the world in a frock in The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert, he switched to sporting LAPD duds to play Ed Exley, a college-educated cop loathed by most of his fellow officers in L.A. Confidential. He then slipped on 19th-century US Army officer gear to eat a little human flesh with Robert Carlyle in Ravenous. It was one of those roles he says he didn't really understand, and it must also have been a bit rich for a diehard vegetarian. 'My wife has been studying natural medicine for some time so we're more into herbs than steaks.'\n\nThe son of a test pilot who was killed in a crash, Guy was born in Ely, Cambridgeshire, and brought up by his schoolteacher mother and stepfather on a deer farm near Melbourne. 'They run a business farming deer for the horns. They fall off naturally and are used for medicines and aphrodisiacs in places like Brazil. We still have family in the UK, in Newcastle where Mum's brother lives, where I go and crash on the couch sometimes.'\n\nAfter toying with the idea of a career in body building (as a teenager he won the Mr Junior Victoria title), he left his 'toffy' private school - where he met his wife and where it was expected he'd become a doctor or a lawyer - determined to become an actor. He applied to NIDA, Australia's top acting college. 'NIDA turned me down but I wasn't bothered because I was making good money working behind a bar. Then I got a screen test for Neighbours. I went along for a laugh - I'd never done any acting before so I had nothing to lose. And luckily, for the moment, it looks like I still have nothing to lose.'\n\nHe's just finished a film in Australia, Till Human Voices Wake Us, with Helena Bonham Carter and directed by Michael Petroni, an Australian who's been living in America for the past eight years. 'Helena uses an Australian accent and there's a quality about this film that's very Australian in its look, but Michael didn't want it ocker, so neither of us has a strong Australian accent,' he says. 'This film is the first thing I've done at home since 1995 apart from a play at Melbourne at the start of the year and a film for Australian television in 1997. There's a kind of sensibility in Australia that I sort of configurate into. Kate and I have talked about going to live somewhere else - like Italy, but we don't talk Italian and we love it here. Anyway, making movies you get to travel a lot, although Kate doesn't usually come on set when we're shooting. She feels a bit like a shag on a rock on set, which I totally understand, and I can get very grumpy when I'm working.\n\n'It seems now that the road between the casting agents in America and Australia is a lot freer. Look at Heath Ledger and Hugh Jackson. Communication is much easier between the two places than it was in Mel Gibson's day. Maybe it's got something to do with the American studio take-over in Australia. Now Warner and Fox are there, everybody's coming over to make their movies in Australia. I feel quite cool about staying home.'"
