        "text": "In addition to the long-standing armed conflict opposing the Houthis to the government, new conflicts have emerged over the past years.\n\nTwo criteria need to be assessed in order to answer the question whether a situation of armed violence amounts to a non-international armed conflict.\n\nFirst, the level of armed violence must reach a certain degree of intensity that goes beyond internal disturbances and tensions.\n\nSecond, in every non-international armed conflict, at least one side to the conflict must be a non-state armed group which must exhibit a certain level of organization in order to qualify as a party to the non-international armed conflict. Government forces are presumed to satisfy the criteria of organization.\n\nInternsity of violence\n\nVarious indicative factors are used to assess whether a given situation has met the required intensity threshold, such as the number, duration, and intensity of individual confrontations; the types of weapons and military equipment used; the number of persons and types of forces participating in the fighting; the number of casualties; the extent of material destruction; the number of civilians fleeing; and the involvement of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nYemeni Government v. the Houthis\n\nFrom January 2011 onwards, against the background of the Arab spring, peaceful protests started to spread across the country to request the resignation of then President Saleh. The Houthis and tribal leaders supported the protests. After dozens of protestors were reportedly killed and many more injured during a demonstration in Sana’a on 18 March 2011, President Saleh declared a state of emergency. The violence further escalated towards the end of May, when fierce fighting erupted between forces loyal to the President and tribal forces. Artillery caused heavy damage and thousands fled the city. Both sides reportedly used weapons such as AK-47 automatic rifles, sniper rifles, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars. In addition, airstrikes were also carried out by the Yemeni Air Force and the Yemeni Navy against armed groups around the capital and in the south. The escalating violence was not limited to the capital: Houthis took advantage of the chaos in Yemen to seize more territory in the north, in particular by taking full control over Saada province.\n\nArmed clashes continued during the summer in various parts of Yemen. After expressing concern over the worsening humanitarian situations in Yemen in June, August, and September 2011, the Security Council adopted Resolution 2014 (2011) in October 2011 to call on all parties to sign the transition initiative brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). While Saleh signed the agreement proposed by the GCC to step down from power and to transfer power to Abdrabbo Mansour Hadi on 23 November 2011, the Houthis felt marginalized and ignored. They have taken advantage of the chaos in Yemen to continue fighting with government forces and tribal groups in northern Yemen and systematically expand their control. This resulted in September 2014 in the seizure of Yemen’s capital Sana’a, supported by some of Saleh’s allies. Afterwards, the Houthis expanded their control south to Ibb province and west to al-Hudayda.\n\nThe takeover of Sana’a followed a new wave of protests demanding for a new government and the implementation of the transition accord. However, the Houthis took advantage of the situation of instability in Yemen to expand their power. Another important factor that helped them was their alignment with several local tribes and government forces loyal to former President Saleh, driven by the existence of a common enemy. The political situation in the capital remained very unstable. A UN-brokered peace agreement with the Houthis – the Peace and National Partnership Agreement (PNPA) – was concluded. While the agreement envisaged that the Houthis would have been included in the government, it was never implemented and tensions between the Houthis and President Hadi re-emerged in Sana’a. Hadi was placed under house arrest and later fled to Aden on 21 February 2015. On 19 March 2015, the situation of violence reached a new peak when fighting broke out between military units loyal to Saleh and Hadi's forces in Aden. Consequently, President Hadi fled the country and sought refuge in Saudi Arabia, where he asked for help. Accordingly, a Saudi-led coalition intervened on the side of the Yemeni government in 2015.\n\nSince the intervention of the coalition took place at the request of the internationally recognised government, and the classification of the conflict does not change. This means that the coalition becomes a party to the pre-existing NIAC between the Yemeni Government and the Houthis.\n\nThe coalition immediately launched an air offensive to counter the Houthis' territorial expansion. This offensive was met with fierce resistance. The escalation of the situation led the UN Security Council to adopt Resolution 2216, which confirmed support for Hadi's government and called on the Houthis to withdraw from the areas they had seized. The coalition's main objective was, with support of Southern Resistance forces, to retake Aden from the Houthis. After an intense battle, they succeeded on 17 July 2015. Throughout 2015, the coalition conducted multiple campaigns of airstrikes across the country, reportedly including the use of cluster munitions. For example on 12 May an airstrike on a market and neighboring lemon grove in Zabid, south of Hodaida, killed at least 60 civilians, an airstrike conducted on 4 July on a village market in Muthalith Ahim killed over 65 people and on 24 July an airstrike on homes in the port city of Mokha killed at least 65 civilians.\n\nSince then, fighting has continued between the Yemeni government, supported by the coalition, and the Houthis. More than 150,000 people are reported to have been killed between the coalition's intervention in March 2015 and June 2019. This indicates the continuing nature of the conflict. Of those 150,000, nearly 15,000 civilians were killed in attacks directly targeting civilian gatherings or buildings. Furthermore, reports indicate that nearly 9,000 (60%), from over 7,000 separate incidents, were caused by air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition. Moreover, since the start of the coalition’s airstrike campaign, over 24,600 airstrikes were carried out.\n\nBy the end of 2021, beginning of 2022, the fighting has escalated between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition. In the context of their attempt to capture Marib, the Houthis have carried out direct attacks on Saudi Arabia and, for the first time, on the UAE. In response, the coalition conducted airstrikes on Yemen leading to a record number of civilians casualties in January 2022, according to Hans Grundberg, Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Yemen. One of these airstrikes hit a Houthi-run detention facility, killing 91 detainees and injuring 236 people.\n\nOn 1 April 2022, the warring parties to Yemen’s conflict agreed to a two month ceasefire agreement, starting with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. UN special envoy Hans Grundberg explained that the truce could have been renewed with the agreement of the parties. He also added that ‘The parties accepted to halt all offensive military air, ground and maritime operations inside Yemen and across its borders; they also agreed for fuel ships to enter into Hodeidah ports and commercial flights to operate in and out of Sanaa airport to predetermined destinations in the region.’ On 3 October 2022, the parties to the agreement failed to consent to its renewal. While the government has blamed the Houthi rebels for the end of the agreement, the opposition forces refused to comment.\n\nOn account of the frequency of armed attacks and armed confrontations, the number of casualties, the number of people forced to flee ongoing hostilities, and the types of weapons and military equipment utilized, it is possible to conclude that there is a non-international conflict between the Yemeni government and the Houthis.\n\nHouthis v. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) took advantage of the security vacuum during the 2011 uprising to seize power in and around several cities in southern Yemen. In the period 2011-2012, this resulted in several small Islamic emirates being declared by AQAP.\n\nAQAP took advantage of the situation to declare war against the Houthis, who adhere to a fundamentally different form of Islam. Notably, when the Houthis started their campaign towards southern Yemen, AQAP began to carry out numerous attacks against the Houthis. This reportedly resulted in 149 attacks between late September 2014 and mid-December 2014. The fighting between the two sides took place mainly in the mountains of Al Bayda, where the Houthis took the upper hand, as well as in Taiz and Marib. During the following years, confrontations between the two sides continued, with AQAP trying to secure territory in southern Yemen and the Houthis trying to seize power in southern Yemen.\n\nEnmity between AQAP and other Islamist groups has greatly weakened AQAP and caused a decrease in their activities. The number of engagements has roughly halved compared to the 2015-2017 period, when they were fiercely resisting the Houthis. In 2018 and 2019, they have focused on IS and other Islamist groups. This has weakened them to such an extent that they have adjusted their strategy and are pushing back as an anti-Houthi movement. Despite the number of engagements dropping, proportionately the focus has clearly returned to fighting the Houthis. Although greatly reduced, confrontations between the two sides continue to take place.\n\nOn account of the frequency of armed attacks and armed confrontations, the number of casualties, the number of people forced to flee ongoing hostilities, and the types of weapons and military equipment utilized, the required degree of intensity has been reached since September 2014. The fighting has continued and hence there is a non-international conflict between the Houthis and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nYemeni Government v. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula\n\nDuring the 2011 uprising, AQAP reorganized in order to take advantage of the vacuum in Yemen. They created Ansar al-Sharia (AAS, “Supporters of Islamic Law”) to gain a foothold in Yemen itself and distinguish their international terrorist activities from domestic objectives. This enabled them to assume control over several towns in the south of Yemen, such as Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan Governorate. This was accompanied by an outbreak of armed violence in the south of Yemen between a combination of Yemeni security services and local militias (kown as Popular Committees) on the one hand, and AAS fighters on the other hand. The situation escalated and the confrontations continued.\n\nAfter President Saleh signed the transition initiative, President Hadi was elected in February 2012. Following his inauguration, AQAP intensified its attacks on government targets. For example, on 21 May 2012, a suicide bomber attacked a military parade in Sana’a killing 96 members of the Government’s armed forces and wounding over 200 people. As a reaction, airstrikes were carried out by the Yemeni Air Force and the Yemeni Navy against AQAP in the south. Moreover, in May 2012, when the Government-linked forces ousted AQAP from Abyan,\n\nThe levels of armed violence remained significant throughout 2012, 2013, and 2014, in particular in the south where the government attempted to drive out AQAP. The escalation of the situation led the UN Security Council to adopt Resolution 2216, which condemned the growing number of AQAP attacks in Yemen.\n\nAQAP, when it suited them, joined the larger structure of a common anti-Houthi front. In this way, they took advantage of the fact that the fighting was largely concentrated against the Houthis to seize control over different governorates and cities. For instance, only a week after the Saudi-led coalition began attacking Huthi-Saleh forces from the air in 2015, AQAP moved into the eastern governorate of Hadramout. They seized the provincial capital, Mukalla, without resistance. AQAP remained in power for over a year, as the coalition was fighting the Houthis elsewhere. In April 2016, AQAP was driven out of Mukalla by the Government-aligned forces. Despite this loss of territory, AQAP was still able to carry out deadly attacks against Government-related targets and to hold certain territories in the governorates of Hadhramaut, Shabwa and Abyan.\n\nAs discussed earlier, AQAP has been weakened in recent years, leading to a reduction in its activities. Nevertheless, they remain involved in hostilities with the Yemeni government on a smaller scale. For instance, it was reported that AQAP carried out attacks in Al Bayda and Shabwah in June 2021. Although there have been no recent reports of activities between the two sides, given the unstable situation in Yemen, it is premature to conclude a declassification of the NIAC between the Yemeni Government and AQAP.\n\nOn account of the frequency of armed attacks and armed confrontations, the number of casualties, the number of people forced to flee ongoing hostilities, and the types of weapons and military equipment utilized, the required degree of intensity has been reached since March 2011. The fighting has continued, although AQAP seems to have recently entered a phase of retrenchment in which they are less active, and hence there is a non-international conflict between the Yemeni Government and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nYemeni Government v. the Southern Transitional Council\n\nThe Southern Transitional Council (STC) was established in May 2017 by Aydrous al-Zubaidi. The STC seeks independence for southern Yemen, as it existed before the unification of Yemen. The Houthi/Saleh alliance being a common enemy, the Hadi Government and pro-independence fighters have fought on each other's side. However, significant ideological differences between them increasingly emerged and this gave rise to the formal emergence of the STC. From May 2017, tensions between the two sides began to increase, with multiple rallies and counter-rallies. In January 2018, this culminated in a direct confrontation between STC forces and Hadi loyalists in Aden. These clashes resulted in dozens of people killed. On 30 January, the STC reportedly took control over Aden. Nevertheless, tensions remained and resulted in regular clashes between STC forces and Hadi Government forces in Aden and in al-Dhale and Taiz governorates. On 7 August, Prime Minister Hadi's guards reportedly fired on people in Aden, to which the STC responded with an offensive the same day. More than 40 people were killed. In this offensive, STC forces seized control over government military bases in Zinjibar and al-Kawad. The government launched counter-attacks and recaptured bases in the Shebwa Governorate and also regained control of Zinjibar. In addition, on 28 August, government forces advanced into Aden, leading to clashes in the eastern part.\n\nClashes between the two sides continued until Saudi Arabia mediated the Riyadh Agreement on 5 November 2019, which would bring an end to the fighting. Nevertheless, some minor clashes erupted in January 2020, indicating that tensions between the STC and the Yemeni government had not yet subsided. Throughout 2020, tensions continued to be present, which from time to time escalated into confrontations and then temporarily de-escalated again. The same evolution occurred in 2021 and continues to this day.\n\nOn account of the frequency of armed attacks and armed confrontations, the number of casualties, the number of people forced to flee ongoing hostilities, and the types of weapons and military equipment utilized, the required degree of intensity has been reached since January 2018. The fighting has continued, although not always with the same intensity and on the same scale, and hence there is a non-international conflict between the Yemeni Government and the South Transitional Council.\n\nOrganization\n\nA series of indicative factors are used to assess whether armed groups exhibit to required degree of organization, such as the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms, the ability to procure, transport, and distribute arms, the ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, the ability to negotiate and conclude agreements, e.g. cease fire or peace agreements. If the criterion of a minimum organization of the armed groups is not fulfilled, there is no armed conflict.\n\nThere are multiple armed groups and tribal militia active in Yemen. While for many of them not enough information is available to analyse their degree of organization, the Houthis, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and the Southern Transitional Council undoubtedly have a sufficient degree of organization.\n\nThe Houthis\n\nOriginally founded to promote Zaidi Islam, the Houthis have been involved in a non-international armed conflict with the government since 2004. While little is known about the group itself apart from its leadership figures, they control significant parts of territory in Yemen, including the capital Sana’a since September 2014, which indicates that they are sufficiently organized to sustain military operations over a long period of time and to act as de facto authorities. This conclusion is reinforced by their ability to launch attacks on strategic targets such as oil facilities and airports in both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Moreover, they succeed in arming themselves on a large scale with ballistic missiles and other modern weaponry, such as drones, despite international arms embargoes. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that they were able to procure and provide military training as well as engaging in the negotiation of cease fire agreements and other political negotiations. They even have their own television station, which was used to announce their plans to take over Sana'a and to call on their supporters to take to the streets to protest against the government.\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula\n\nAl-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) was formed by the merger of the Yemeni and Saudi branches of al-Qaeda in 2009. In 2011, an offshoot of the group, Ansar al-Shari’a Yemen, seized control over large areas in the south, declaring them ‘Emirates’. However, the exact relationship between Ansar al-Shari’a Yemen and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is not known, with many considering that the former is a simply naming exercise in order to attract more local fighters and to separate their foreign policy goals from their domestic goals. Little information is available about the group. Nevertheless, their ability to control territory in the south, then declare them Emirates and then govern them, is a strong indication of AQAP's organisational capacity. Moreover, their ability to sustain concerted military operations against both government forces and Houthis suggests that the group exhibits the required degree of organization. They have also cooperated as an organisation with the anti-Houthi forces and actively participated in the popular resistance fronts formed in Abyan, Aden, Al Dali, Lahij, Shabwah and Taizz. It should be noted that recently AQAP became weakened and more fragmented, which might indicate that the organizational threshold is not met any more. However, this conclusion seems to be premature at the moment.\n\nThe Southern Transitional Council\n\nThe Southern Transitional Council (STC) was established in May 2017 by Aydrous al-Zubaidi. It was a reaction against the Hadi Government’s failure of governing over south Yemen. Immediately, a 26-seat council was installed and presided by former Aden governor Aydrous al-Zubaidi. With the emergence of the STC, the separatist movement gained ground and became an organised resistance movement not only against the Houthis, but also against the Government. The fact that their structure is so state-like and that there is a clear leadership, shows that they are an organized entity.\n\nLittle information is available about the military structure of the STC. However, we know that the ‘Security Belt’ forces, a paramilitary formation trained by the UAE, was incorporated in the organization and became the STC’s military wing. They had one leader in charge of running this military wing, Munir al-Yafei, indicating the existence of a command structure. Moreover, they had the ability to control territory in the south, in particular in and around Aden. Furthermore, given their continuing engagements with both government forces and Houthi forces, we can assume that they possess the ability to sustain concerted military operations. In addition, their involvement in the Riyadh accords illustrates their ability to speak with one voice and to negotiate ceasefire agreements and other types of political settlements."
