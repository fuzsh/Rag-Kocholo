Yemen's $1.5 million PPCR investment plan is building on the country's existing efforts, the goals of its national adaptation plan, and its strategic program for climate resilience under PPCR that has been designed to reduce the vulnerability of its coastal populations. Its aims are to support investments that mainstream and enhance climate resilience planning and action.\n\nThe program will also help integrate climate resilience and adaptation planning and capacity into Yemen's water and agricultural sectors. PPCR investments will enable the knowledge generation of human and ecological adaptation to climate change in diverse areas and provide a framework to integrate this knowledge at the regional and national levels."
