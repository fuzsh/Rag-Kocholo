        "text": "Conflict background\n\nThe Houthis took over Sanaa city on 21 September 2014, culminating the group’s advance from its stronghold in the northern governorate of Saada to the country’s capital. The group’s advance was facilitated by their partnership of convenience with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and forces still loyal to the long-serving autocrat. Having defeated the main IRG units to the north of the city, Houthi supporters initially entered the capital under the guise of protests against the wildly unpopular cabinet decision to lift fuel subsidies. The protests, which started in August, quickly took a violent turn, reaching a tipping point in September when Houthi and Saleh troops took to the streets, forcing the cabinet’s resignation.\n\nThe United Nations managed to reach a temporary de-escalation between the sides, brokering the Peace and National Partnership Agreement (PNPA) between the IRG and the Houthis. Based on the agreement, a new cabinet was appointed in October with the participation of the Houthis, but tensions continued until President Abdurabbuh Mansur Hadi and Prime Minister Khalid Bahah resigned in January 2015. In response, the Houthis withdrew from the government, placing Hadi under house arrest before he managed to escape to Aden in February. After Hadi’s escape, Houthi-Saleh forces launched a campaign towards the new IRG capital under the guise of counter-terrorism operations, following simultaneous suicide bombings on two Shiite mosques that killed at least 142 people. Islamic State in Yemen (ISY) claimed the attack.\n\nUpon the Houthi forces reaching Aden and conducting several airstrikes on the city, the Saudi-led Coalition announced its intervention in the civil war, starting a country-wide bombing campaign marked by initial strikes on the Houthi-held capital. The Sanaa region was subject to heavy Coalition airstrikes over the seven years that followed, with several incidents causing mass civilian casualties. Most notably, airstrikes that hit a funeral gathering in October 2016 – purportedly targeting high-profile political and military figures – caused over 600 civilian casualties.\n\nOn the ground, the fighting did not reach Sanaa city. The frontlines’ closest proximity to the capital was in February 2016 when the IRG launched a counter-offensive to the northeast of Sanaa governorate, managing to push through al-Jawf and reach the bordering district of Nihm, about 40 kilometers from the capital. This put the IRG forces and loyalist tribes within artillery range of the city’s outskirts, including Sanaa airport, but this was the closest they got to the capital. The front remained deadlocked for most of the next four years, interspersed with brief upticks in fighting as one or the other of the sides sought to break the stalemate. In January 2020, an IRG campaign to advance on Sanaa backfired and Houthi forces were able to reverse their previous losses, advancing into al-Jawf and Marib.\n\nHowever, clashes did break out in Sanaa in December 2017 after long-running tensions between the Houthis and Saleh escalated following the former president’s declaration that he was ready to start a new page with the Saudi-led Coalition and end their partnership. Initially, Saleh’s forces managed to capture several positions in and around the city, but were soon overwhelmed by the superior Houthi forces, despite supportive Coalition airstrikes, leading many units to defect to the Houthi side. Saleh died as he tried to escape the city, and his remaining forces were quickly defeated.\n\nSince then, airstrikes remained the most consistent threat to the region, although the overall number of strikes fell after the end of the Houthi-Saleh clashes. The only exceptions were two periods of intensive airstrikes on Sanaa and Amanat al-Asima: January to March 2020 and December to January 2022. The first coincided with the heavy ground fighting in Nihm as control over the district went back and forth between IRG and Houthi forces, during which Coalition jets provided air support. The second came in the lead-up to the UN-mediated truce in 2022 when Coalition jets retaliated for a series of Houthi drone and missile attacks on the United Arab Emirates, marking the deadliest period since 2019.\n\nThere have been no more coalition airstrikes on the region since 26 March 2022 despite the expiration of the UN-mediated ceasefire six months later. However, the start of US-led strikes on Yemen in response to the Houthi Red Sea attacks hit several sites in the Sanaa region in early 2024. The al-Daylami Air Base adjoined to the Sanaa Airport was a repeat target starting 11 January, along with the al-Hafa military camp in the south of the city, while anti-ship missiles were struck in the wider governorate.\n\nRegional Context\n\nAs the largest city in Yemen and the former seat of the government, Sanaa had the country’s main airport and housed most of the institutions of power. These have since been split between the northern city and the IRG’s new capital in Aden, with the ones remaining in Sanaa suffering severe damage from the years of Coalition bombing. The airport closed early in the conflict, only accessible for humanitarian flights, before a partial re-opening in 2022 as part of the UN-mediated ceasefire. Currently, the only available commercial flights are to the Jordanian capital, Amman. The facility was a regular target for airstrikes during the aerial campaign, damaging the runway and terminals as the Coalition accused the Houthis of using the airport to assemble, store, and launch unmanned aerial vehicles (more commonly known as UAVs) and missiles into Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe bombing campaign has caused widespread damage across the city and wider region. This includes the historic Old City, a UNESCO world heritage site, and civilian homes and properties. The Sanaa region has been the second most bombed governorate in the country after Saada, with Sanaa city the most targeted city during the conflict. The airstrikes have, though, ceased since the start of the UN-mediated truce in April 2022 and, despite its expiration, there have been no more bombings.\n\nOn the ground, having consolidated their control over Sanaa and the local administration, security incidents have been limited since the Houthis captured the region. As in other areas under their control, the group has taken a hardline in response to any protests or opposition to their rule, arbitrarily arresting activists and opposition figures, torturing detainees, and threatening family members. In the deadliest incident, at least 44 people were killed when a fire broke out at an overcrowded detention center for migrants in March 2021. The fire reportedly started when guards fired tear gas into a crowded hanger trying to end a protest by the migrants over ill-treatment and abuses by the authorities.\n\nOutside the city, resistance to Houthi rule has resulted in periodic clashes with local tribes, especially in response to Saleh’s call to rise up against his former allies in December 2017. As in other Houthi-controlled governorates, the violation of tribal norms has resulted in armed violence, but the violence has been short-lived as the Houthi response has usually been disproportionately punitive."
