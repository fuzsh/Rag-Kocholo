        "text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Two suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a ship in the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait that links the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea, authorities said Friday.\n\nThe Houthis did not immediately claim the assaults, though they follow a monthslong campaign by the rebels targeting shipping through the Red Sea corridor over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAfter a recent two-week pause, their attacks have resumed following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, amid renewed concerns over the war escalating to a regional conflict.\n\n“The operations are ongoing — our operations toward occupied Palestine to target the Israeli enemy, our operations at sea, the inevitable forthcoming response, as well as coordination with the axis in any joint operations,” warned the Houthi's secretive leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi. \"The decision to respond is a collective decision, at the level of the entire axis and at the level of each front individually “\n\nIn the first attack, a rocket-propelled grenade exploded close to the ship Thursday, according to the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center. Two smaller craft, with men aboard wearing white and yellow raincoats, launched the RPG, the UKMTO said.\n\nThe second attack came early Friday, with a missile “exploding in close proximity to the vessel,” the UKMTO said. “The vessel and crew are reported to be safe.”\n\nThe private security firm Ambrey, which said the vessel had a private security crew onboard, described the ship as being hit by a drone that caused no injuries or physical damage.\n\n“The vessel was assessed to be aligned with the Houthi target profile,” Ambrey said. “The vessel was assessed to have been targeted earlier in the day.”\n\nThough the Houthis did not immediately claim the attack, it sometimes can take hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults, while claiming others that apparently haven't happened.\n\nThe Houthis have targeted more than 70 vessels with missiles and drones in a campaign that has killed four sailors. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the time since. Other missiles and drones have been either intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or splashed down before reaching their targets.\n\nThe rebels maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain as part of the rebels’ campaign they say seeks to force an end to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the war — including some bound for Iran.\n\nSince November, Houthi attacks have disrupted the $1 trillion flow of goods passing through the region annually while also sparking the most intense combat the U.S. Navy has seen since World War II.\n\nThe Houthis also have launched drones and missiles toward Israel, including an attack on July 19 that killed one person and wounded 10 others in Tel Aviv. Israel responded the next day with airstrikes on the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida that hit fuel depots and electrical stations, killing and wounding a number of people, the rebels say.\n\nAfter the strikes, the Houthis paused their attacks until Saturday, when they hit a Liberian-flagged container ship traveling through the Gulf of Aden.\n\nMeanwhile on Thursday, U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor fighter jets arrived in the Mideast from a base in the United Kingdom, authorities said Thursday.\n\nU.S. Central Command posted images online of the fighters, saying their presence in the region was “to address threats posed by Iran and Iranian-backed groups.”\n\nThe U.S. has declined to say where the aircraft landned due to host nation sensitivities.\n\nCentral Command later said it destroyed two Houthi anti-ship cruise missiles and one Houthi ground control station, as well as a drone boat in the Red Sea."
