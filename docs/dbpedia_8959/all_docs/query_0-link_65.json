        "text": "Historical background\n\nThe Houthis engaged in six rounds of war with the regime of Ali Abdullah Saleh between 2004 and 2010, known as the Saada wars. During the Youth Uprising in 2011, they gained popularity and became known as Ansar Allah. They later formed an alliance with their former arch-enemy Saleh, overrunning the capital Sanaa in September 2014 and signing the Peace and National Partnership Agreement (PNPA) with then-President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi – a power-sharing agreement that granted the Houthis access to government institutions.\n\nOn 6 February 2015, the Houthis issued the ‘Constitutional Declaration,’ dissolved the parliament, and established the Supreme Revolutionary Committee (SRC) under the leadership of Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, Abdulmalik’s cousin. They subsequently marched southwards in response to deadly bombing attacks against Zaydi mosques in Sanaa, which they attributed to the Islamic State. The Houthi-Saleh forces surrounded the southern port city of Aden triggering fierce clashes with the remnants of the Yemeni army and poorly armed resistance forces. In response, the Saudi-led Coalition launched Operation Decisive Storm on 26 March in support of President Hadi’s Internationally Recognized Government (IRG).\n\nThe conflict dragged on until back-channel talks between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia facilitated a United Nations-brokered nationwide ceasefire, leading to the Kuwait Talks in April 2016. Yet, the breakdown of the talks in August 2016 marked a new phase of military and political developments. The Houthis and Saleh established the Supreme Political Council (SPC), led by then-President Saleh al-Sammad. Separately, the Houthis intensified aerial warfare, culminating in their first strike on Riyadh in February 2017. Tensions with the GPC escalated, resulting in clashes throughout 2017. Eventually, on 2 December, Saleh broke the alliance with the Houthis and engaged in dialogue with Saudi Arabia. In the ensuing battle of Sanaa, the Houthis eliminated Saleh and initiated a campaign to purge the GPC leadership.\n\nIn 2018, the Houthis consolidated their control over state institutions. However, in April, SPC President al-Sammad was killed by a Coalition airstrike and replaced by Mahdi al-Mashat. Around the same time, the Coalition launched a decisive offensive on the West Coast, besieging al-Hudayda. However, the Stockholm Agreement, established on 13 December 2018, effectively halted the Coalition’s advance.\n\nThroughout 2019, the conflict in Yemen reached a stalemate, with decreased cross-border political violence due to talks between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia. However, in early 2020, the Houthis advanced into al-Jawf governorate, posing a threat to the IRG by approaching the capital of Marib governorate, while resuming cross-border attacks. Between 2020 and January 2022, they dedicated substantial resources to capture Marib, but fell short of their objective and reacted to this setback with missile and drone attacks against the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, exposing their vulnerabilities and forcing them into a stalemate.\n\nIn light of these developments, the UN secured a truce between the Houthis and the IRG, which lasted from 2 April to 2 October 2022. Since the end of the truce, the Houthis have regularly engaged in tit-for-tat clashes on the frontlines, while also targeting economic infrastructure with long-range drones. Despite threatening a new escalation on several occasions, the Houthis have continued to engage in negotiations over the release of prisoners, the re-opening of transportation routes, and a new ceasefire. In a historic event, on 9 April 2023, a Saudi-Omani delegation, including Saudi Ambassador Muhammad Bin Said al-Jabir, visited Sanaa and met with SPC President Mashat, setting the stage for a major prisoner exchange. This diplomatic gesture was reciprocated in September, with the first visit of President al-Mashat to Riyadh. The talks culminated in December, with the UN announcing that the warring parties committed to measures to implement a nationwide ceasefire plan."
