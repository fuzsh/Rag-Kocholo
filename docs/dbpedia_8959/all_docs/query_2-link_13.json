        "text": "The Houthis’ attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea and the subsequent responses overshadow the progress made in 2023 for peace in Yemen. After months of bilateral talks between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia to end the conflict that started eight years ago, a peace agreement seemed to be within reach. On 23 December 2023, the United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, announced that representatives of the Houthi movement and the internationally recognized government committed to “a set of measures to implement a nationwide ceasefire.” Among other provisions, the UN roadmap included the payment of public sector salaries, a resumption of oil exports, the opening of roads in Taizz and other provinces, and an end to restrictions on air and sea ports in Houthi-controlled areas.\n\nThe war in Yemen is estimated to have directly killed over 160,000 people since March 2015, when a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia intervened to restore the internationally recognized government ousted by the Houthis. A nationwide UN-mediated truce came into effect in April 2022 as a result of several compounding factors: an unprecedented military balance amid warring parties, a regional détente between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and Riyadh’s desire to exit the war. Meanwhile, Houthi and Saudi representatives started engaging in direct talks to build mutual trust, sidelining the fragmented anti-Houthi camp re-organized under the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC).\n\nOverall, the truce has contributed to a significant de-escalation, with the activity of the warring parties decreasing by 70% in 2023 compared to the year prior. However, a low-intensity conflict has since surfaced, continuing to threaten civilian lives and uphold consistently severe violence. For instance, the share of violent events that targeted civilians more than doubled in 2023, with over 1,120 events recorded by ACLED last year alone. Behind these patterns are several factors, including the increasing repression of the Houthi-led Sanaa-based government against the last shreds of local opposition; the increased mobility spurred by the truce, which led to frequent landmine and explosive remnants of war incidents; and an over 55% increase in the violence against migrants attempting to cross the Yemen-Saudi border.\n\nAlongside these domestic developments, the Houthis have increasingly shifted their strategic focus toward the Red Sea. Since at least September 2022, Houthi leaders have made explicit threats to international sea routes, amid reports of a renewed militarization on Yemen’s western coast. Yet, the outbreak of the conflict in Gaza, on 7 October 2023, offered the group an opportunity to demonstrate its stated support for Palestine, which resulted in a sequence of attacks against Israeli targets. Since 19 October 2023, the Houthis launched 14 drone and missile attacks toward Israel’s southern port of Eilat, mostly intercepted by Israel and the United States. In a further escalation, they declared Israeli-linked vessels and ships heading to Israeli ports as military targets on the ‘Gaza front,’ leading to one successful hijacking and 19 drone and missile attacks on commercial vessels in November and December, 2023.\n\nHistorically, the Red Sea maritime axis — stretching from the Bab al-Mandab strait to the Channel of Suez, two strategic chokepoints for global trade — has been characterized by maritime safety, despite occasional piracy incidents originating from the Horn of Africa. The war in Yemen turned this region into an active conflict area. ACLED records over 250 political violence and interception events affecting the Red Sea and its ports since 2015. However, major disruptions to shipping lanes occurred only as a result of the recent Houthi escalation.\n\nApproximately 30% of container trade and 12% of global oil transit through the Red Sea. The risk of Houthi attacks prompted companies to redirect half of the vessels that regularly navigate this route through Southern Africa. Longer journeys boosted freight rates and reduced global shipping capacity, also causing a severe impact on Israel’s economy. But they also affected Yemen, drastically reducing maritime traffic through the port of Aden and driving an increase in insurance war premiums.\n\nWhat to watch for in 2024\n\nThe domestic situation in Yemen remains tense despite the recent announcement of an imminent roadmap under UN auspices. A regional escalation in the Red Sea could nevertheless derail ongoing peace efforts and lead to a resurgence of the conflict. This intricate situation results in domestic, regional, and international actors finding themselves in diverse predicaments.\n\nThe Houthis are likely to capitalize on attacks in the Red Sea. As of September 2023, they faced unrest and protests by public-sector employees demanding salary disbursement. The Israel-Gaza conflict conveniently redirected popular sentiments, boosting the group’s regional and domestic standing. Additionally, it provided leverage against Riyadh. Arguably, the Houthis may persist with attacks in the Red Sea until a ceasefire allows humanitarian aid in Palestine, all the while seeking to secure a peace deal with Saudi Arabia. Overall, they might try to establish a balance of ‘controlled deterrence’ to avoid further international retaliation, while responding to direct US attacks with targeted operations.\n\nFurther, the Houthis can leverage their dominant position in domestic military affairs as an additional card at the negotiating table. Conflict escalation in Yemen is unlikely amid ongoing negotiations, but frontline activity may swiftly resume if talks collapse. In such a scenario, the Houthis could gain the upper hand in the oil-rich Marib governorate or in Shabwa.\n\nTensions in the PLC between government loyalists and supporters of the secessionist Southern Transitional Council mirror a regional divide between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are both vying for influence in the Red Sea. Riyadh’s Vision 2030 roadmap plans tourism projects on the Red Sea coast and an expansion of exports through the Jeddah port, while the traditional oil-driven economy is increasingly reliant on exports from the western Yanbu facility. Abu Dhabi envisions a ‘string of ports’ strategy which entails the indirect control of the maritime infrastructure in southwestern Yemen through local proxies, combined with direct military control of select islands of strategic importance — such as Perim and Socotra. Two United Arab Emirates-based companies, DP World and AD Ports, are spearheading the establishment of port infrastructures in Africa and along the Red Sea coast.\n\nRiyadh and Abu Dhabi hold diverging visions on Red Sea security. In the recent past, Saudi Arabia embraced a multilateral approach through the creation of an alliance of eight Red Sea littoral states. To this end, Saudi officials reportedly oppose US military strikes against the Houthis, expressing concerns about potential retaliation on Saudi oil infrastructure and prioritizing the pursuit of a peace deal in Yemen. Unlike Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi invested in bilateral agreements, and it advocates for a designation of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), while fostering US military intervention to solve the Red Sea crisis. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also hold different strategies in Sudan, where Emirati support to the Rapid Support Forces has derailed Saudi-hosted peace talks.\n\nYet, Gulf countries share a common goal of countering Iranian influence in the Red Sea with Israel and the US. Until now, Tehran’s involvement in the Red Sea has been mostly indirect, providing political and material support to the Houthis. Nonetheless, the Biden Administration and Tel Aviv see Iran as being “deeply involved” in planning and enabling attacks on commercial shipping. Already in 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of military intervention if Iran blocked Bab al-Mandab strait. Israeli efforts intensified after the Abraham Accords in 2020, leading to the alleged attack of the Iranian military ship Saviz with limpet mines and increased cooperation with the US to patrol the region.\n\nFor its part, Washington presents itself as a guarantor of freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. The Biden administration faces the predicament of containing Houthi threats while safeguarding the peace deal in Yemen and avoiding a regional escalation. To maintain this precarious balance, it launched Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational naval partnership consisting of over 50 warships deployed in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, while issuing targeted designations to counter Iranian financial assistance to Houthi forces. In a further escalatory step, Washington and allied countries launched direct strikes on Houthi strategic assets in Yemen on 12 January 2024, retaliating for the group’s previous attack on US warships."
