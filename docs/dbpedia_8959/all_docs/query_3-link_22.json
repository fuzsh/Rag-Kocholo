        "text": "header2 Key Developments in 2017\n\nThe Houthi-Saleh alliance collapsed in December when the two factions began to clash in Sanaa, Saleh made peace overtures to the Saudi-led coalition, and Houthi forces finally killed the former president in an attack on his convoy. However, the overall conflict continued unabated.\n\nAlthough rebel forces—which allegedly drew material support from Iran—controlled the capital and much of the country’s north and west, the Hadi government and its allies attempted to press in on this territory from all directions, particularly from their base in the southern port of Aden. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) maintained informal spheres of influence, while the militant groups Islamic State (IS) and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) held pockets of territory in the southeast.\n\nThe United States, in addition to aiding the pro-Hadi coalition, increased the frequency of direct attacks on suspected AQAP and IS targets in Yemen after President Donald Trump took office in January.\n\nMore than half of the Yemeni population was considered food-insecure by the end of the year, and the country also faced the largest recorded outbreak of cholera in modern history, with both problems exacerbated by the Saudi-led blockade of Yemeni ports and airports. The Saudi-led air campaign—supported by the United States and some European governments—continued to strike civilian infrastructure and population centers, repeatedly hitting medical facilities.\n\nJournalists and activists continued to be detained arbitrarily, including one of Yemen’s most vocal political activists, Hisham al-Omeisy, who was arrested by the Houthi-controlled National Security Bureau in August."
