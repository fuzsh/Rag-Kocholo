        "text": "Economy\n\nThe public sector is the largest employer in the city, with tens of thousands of jobs in the central and local administration. Industrial and commercial activities are also present. The city’s industrial production is dominated by light industry, especially textile, clothing, shoes, home products, and plastics. Heavy industry includes steel and other metal production. Handicraft production is also an important source of income. Jewellery, traditional daggers and belts, brassware, and agricultural tools continue to be produced in small workshops in the city. Sana’a is an important commercial center with large wholesale and retail sectors focused on a number of markets and malls. Real estate and construction are also an important sector in the city. Sana’a was once the center of the Yemeni tourism industry. The Old City of Sana’a is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Tourism has virtually ceased during the war.\n\nThe capital governorate historically had the highest share of local revenue in its local authority budget, reflecting its importance as an industrial and commercial center in the national economy. Seventy-two percent of its 2014 budget was funded from central grants and subsidies, and 28% from local revenues. The main sources of local revenue came from citywide shared revenues and taxes, notably sales tax, zakat, income tax, and profit tax. The city also derived income from assets and sales of goods and services. Following the establishment of the General Zakat Authority by the de facto authorities, the city of Sana’a stands to lose zakat, previously an important source of income.\n\nIn 2014, the poverty rate in Sana’a city was 13.4%. More recent estimates suggest the rate has spiked to almost 80% as the suspension of government salaries has hit the public sector workforce in the capital, and rampant inflation and the general implosion of the economy have taken their toll.\n\nLocal governance\n\nThe local council of the city of Sana’a is composed of 20 councilors in addition to the appointed mayor of the city. There are seven vacant seats in the council, with four deceased councilors and three who are abroad, leaving 13. The local council does not convene regularly and its meetings are confined to the administrative board consisting of the mayor, the secretary general of the council, and heads of the three committees. As for the executive offices, they are functioning regularly despite the lack of salaries and the shortage of operational budgets.\n\nAccess to basic services\n\nThere are nearly 3 million people (approximately 80% of the population) in need of assistance in Sana’a city. Sixty-four percent of them are in dire need (status December 2022).\n\nHealth services are available in public hospitals and health facilities, which rely on support from donor organizations and fees charged for services. Even with donor support, services are at a bare minimum and do not meet the needs of the population. Large numbers of IDPs – approximately 250.000 (status December 2022) – who have fled to Sana’a from other governorates have placed additional strain on health services and other infrastructure.\n\nNext to the governorate of Sa’adah, the capital has sustained the highest number of airstrikes and 227 schools have been damaged. Teachers are not receiving regular monthly salaries in the city, which has disrupted education. There are attempts to run some of the schools in the governorate on a fee basis, but parents have largely rejected these efforts. Teachers receive a small stipend from the de facto authorities.\n\nAs of 2017, 70% of households in Sana’a city had access to potable water. Water services in the city have been damaged by airstrikes and have been only partially restored. The sewage system does not cover all districts.\n\nDemographics\n\nDistrict Size (km2) Population (Female) Population (Male) Population (Total) Old City 2 61,479 68,868 130,348 Shu’aub 15 208,334 235,788 444,122 Azal 15 105,992 118,770 224,761 Assafi’yah 10 97,944 122,143 220,086 As Sabain 31 274,139 325,593 599,732 Al Wahdah 8 70,976 85,930 156,906 At Tahrir 3 54,457 69,417 123,874 Ma’een 11 271,517 330,670 602,180 Al-Thowarah 22 150,467 177,851 328,318 Bani Al Harith 269 220,591 245,423 466,015 TOTAL 385 1,515,889 1,780,453 3,296,342\n\nFigures are based on the 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview Yemen, OCHA. Population figures include the number of IDPs and residents.\n\nResources relevant to Capital City of Sana’a"
