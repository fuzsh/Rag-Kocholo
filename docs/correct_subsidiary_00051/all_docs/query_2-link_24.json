        "text": "NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Continuing its hostile efforts to take over Quickturn Design Systems, Mentor Graphics Corp. said Monday it increased the offering price in its tender offer to $14 cash per share from $12.125.\n\nThe amended offer, which is set to expire at midnight Jan. 11, matches the $253 million stock transaction proposed by white-knight Cadence Design Systems, with which Quickturn agreed to merge on Dec. 9.\n\nMentor (MENT), which makes electronic hardware and software for telecommunications, automotive, electronics, computer, semiconductor and aerospace companies, also said it changed the number of shares it is seeking in Quickturn to 2,100,000.\n\nCombined with the 591,500 shares of Quickturn (QKTN) that Mentor already owns, that would bring Mentor's stake in Quickturn's stock to 14.9 percent, the maximum amount that can be acquired without triggering Quickturn's \"poison pill,\" a strategic move by a takeover target to make its stock less attractive to an acquirer.\n\nMentor said it will consider increasing its offer if, during negotiations with Quickturn, that seems necessary.\n\n\"The board will assess the Mentor offer and advise shareholders accordingly,\" a Quickturn spokesman said after Mentor increased its offer early Monday. The spokesman said the board also will \"assess\" the Cadence deal.\n\nIn a statement, Quickturn said it is urging all stockholders to take no action on Mentor's revised offer until its board made a recommendation.\n\n\"Mentor's proposed transaction is more compelling than the proposed Cadence merger and doesn't suffer from the Cadence deal's drawbacks,\" Walden C. Rhines, Mentor's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. \"Our deal offers all cash, greater certainty as to timing and importantly no antitrust risk.\"\n\nMentor filed suit Dec. 15 against Quickturn, a maker of diagnostic tools that test semiconductor designs, to try to stop the proposed stock-swap merger with Cadence (CDN), which makes semiconductor and computer system design software.\n\nOfficials at Quickturn were not immediately available for comment on Mentor's increased bid.\n\nAiming to remove Quickturn directors\n\nA special meeting of Quickturn shareholders will be held Jan. 8 to consider Mentor's proposal to remove Quickturn's current board and replace it with five new directors nominated by Mentor.\n\nIf that proposal is approved and Mentor nominees win the election, Mentor said it would encourage the new directors to auction Quickturn to the highest bidder and to execute a merger agreement with that bidder. Mentor said such an agreement could be executed within 30 days of the nominees' election as directors of Quickturn.\n\nIn afternoon trading Monday, Mentor shares were up 3/32 to close at 7-23/32 on the Nasdaq exchange. Shares of Quickturn were down 3/8 at 14-3/16. Cadence stock was unchanged at 27-5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n-- From staff and wire reports"
