Unless the context otherwise requires, each reference in this Agreement to shares of Parent Common Stock and to the Shares shall include the associated Parent Rights (as such term is defined in Section 3.2(a) hereof) and associated Company Rights (as defined in Section 2.2(a)), respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or the Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares then the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares. (b) The \"Exchange Ratio\" shall be (i) $14.00 divided by (ii) the average closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock (as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions reporting system) during the five trading days immediately preceding the second business day prior to the Closing Date. (c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Acquisition shall be converted into one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. (d) At the Effective Time, each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share held by Parent, Acquisition or any subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to exist and no shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered with respect thereto. Section 1.9. Dissenters and Appraisal Rights. The holders of the ------------------------------- Shares will not be entitled to dissenters and appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Section 1.10. Exchange of Certificates. ------------------------ (a) From time to time following the Effective Time, as required by subsections (b) and (c) below, Parent shall deliver to its transfer agent, or a depository or trust institution of recognized standing selected by Parent and Acquisition (the \"Exchange Agent\") for the benefit of the holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with this Article I: (i) certificates representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8, and (ii) cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock and such cash are hereinafter referred to as the \"Exchange Fund\"), in exchange for outstanding Shares. 3 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the \"Certificates\") and whose shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.8: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and, if applicable, a check representing the cash consideration to which such holder may be entitled on account of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article I and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.10, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 1.10. (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.10(f), until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor without interest (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.10(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. (d) In the event that any Certificate for Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in 4 lieu of fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a suitable bond or indemnity. (e) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.10(c) or 1.10(f)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares; subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the date hereof that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. (f) No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall upon surrender of his or her Certificate or Certificates be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the average closing price for Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions reporting system for the five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time by the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company upon the expiration of twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as the case may be and any applicable dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. (h) Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares or Parent Common Stock as the case may be for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Section 1.11. Stock Options. ------------- (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option or warrant to purchase Shares (a \"Company Stock Option\" or collectively \"Company Stock Options\") issued pursuant to the Company's 1988 Stock Option Plan, 1990 Stock Option Plan, 1992 Key Executive Stock Option Plan, 1993 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan, 1996 5 Supplemental Stock Plan, as amended, 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended, 1994 Outside Director Stock Option Plan, Key Executive Stock Option Plan, SpeedSim, Inc. 1995 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, or other agreement or arrangement, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into options or warrants, as applicable, to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.11. All plans or agreements described above pursuant to which any Company Stock Option has been issued or may be issued other than outstanding warrants are referred to collectively as the \"Company Plans.\" Each Company Stock Option shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder of such Company Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option or warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective Time at a price per share equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (y) the product of (i) the number of Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code (\"incentive stock options\" or \"ISOs\" ) the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Company Plan and that the agreements evidencing the grants of such Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 1.11 after giving effect to the Merger). Parent shall comply with the terms of the Company Plans and ensure, to the extent required by and subject to the provisions of such Plans, that Company Stock Options that qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options of Parent after the Effective Time. (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options assumed in accordance with this Section 1.11. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to any Company Stock Options held by persons who are directors, officers or employees of the Company or its subsidiaries and shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding. (d) At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be effected any necessary amendments to the Company Plans to give effect to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.11. 6 ARTICLE 2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition, subject to the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Schedule (the \"Company Disclosure Schedule\") delivered by the Company to Parent in accordance with Section 4.15 (which exceptions shall specifically identify a Section, Subsection or clause of a single Section or Subsection hereof, as applicable, to which such exception relates) that: Section 2.1.

When used in connection with the Company or its subsidiaries, the term \"Material Adverse Effect on the Company\" means any circumstance, change in, or effect on (or circumstance, change in, or effect involving a prospective change on) the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (a) that is, or is reasonably likely in the future to be, materially adverse to the operations, assets or liabilities (including contingent liabilities), earnings or results of operations, or the business (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding from the foregoing the effect, if any, of (i) changes in general economic conditions or changes affecting the industry in which the Company operates, (ii) stockholder class action litigation arising from allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement, (iii) of the public announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated hereby on current or prospective customers or revenues of the Company (provided that such effect is direct and that the Company shall have the burden of proving such direct effect), or (iv) any action or inaction required of the Company by Parent under Section 4.1, or (b) that would reasonably be 7 expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
