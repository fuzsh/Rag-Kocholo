During the past few years, the use of Hardware Description (or Design) Languages (HDLs) and digital simulation have advanced to a point where the concurrent development of software and hardware can be contemplated using simulation environments. This offers the potential of 50% or greater reductions in time-to-market for embedded systems. This paper is a tutorial on the technical issues that underlie software-hardware (swhw) co-simulation, and the current state of the art. We review the traditional sequential hardware-software design paradigm, and suggest a paradigm for concurrent design, which is supported by co-simulation of software and hardware. This is followed by sections on HDLs modeling and simulation;hardware assisted approaches to simulation; microprocessor modeling methods; brief descriptions of four commercial products for sw-hw co-simulation and a description of our own experiments to develop a co-simulation environment.},\n\ndoi = {},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/288313}, journal = {},\n\nnumber = ,\n\nvolume = ,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Sun Sep 01 00:00:00 EDT 1996},\n\nmonth = {Sun Sep 01 00:00:00 EDT 1996}\n\n}"
