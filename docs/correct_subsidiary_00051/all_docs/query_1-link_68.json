        "text": "In late August 2022, Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing (âGRAMâ), needed commercial-scale, ultra-low-temperature capacity units at -50Â°C delivered in-house immediately to store forthcoming raw materials. A typical timeline for commercial-scale cold-capacity solutions can run months at a time, which would not meet GRAMâs needs. GRAM is a leading parental contract and development manufacturing organization that meets clinical and commercial fill-and-finish needs.\n\nUnits were needed to store vaccines for a potential fast-growing disease threat that required very rapid operational readiness. While GRAM had existing ultra-low temperature cold-wall freezers rated for -80Â°C, the existing freezers could not meet uniformity requirements at -50Â°C.\n\nFurther complicating the situation, the available space for the new freezers was limited, so the storage solution would require substantial density in a smaller-than-usual footprint. Lastly, due to the value of the stored product, the solution would need to offer operational redundancy.\n\nGRAM also wanted a solution that would offer integrated redundancy so they could avoid the extra expense and footprint needed to keep just-in-case back-up freezers running. GRAM reached out to FARRARâ¢ to help them meet the challenge. FARRAR offers walk-in and reach-in ultra low temperature solutions for manufacturing, freezing, and storage of medicines, vaccines, and other life science products.\n\nBoth companies joined forces to execute within an extremely aggressive, six-week timeframe. After an initial phone call onAugust 24, the two organizations worked to finalize a purchase order before meeting for the first time in person on August 31.\n\nDuring their initial meetings, the teams firmed up all project details, including freezer logistics, timeline, and implementation.\n\nBased on their needs and discussion with FARRAR, GRAM selected three 190-cubicUltra Low Chamber (ULC) units which provide multiple benefits:\n\nPrecise temperature control â The only forced-air/convection-cooling capabilities on the market, the ULC units enable precise temperature control\n\nSmall footprint â These 190-cubic-foot units fill the space of a conventional smaller 150-cubic foot unit, requiring only47 sq. ft./4.36 m2 of space\n\nFast temperature recovery â The ULC units offer the industryâs fastest temperature recovery from door opening\n\nSustainable â Designed with energy balance and sustainability in mind, these ULCs offers dynamic refrigeration control and low energy consumption (0.33kWh/cubic foot per day)\n\nRedundancy â The units offer 2N redundancy as each chamber is equipped with a dedicated refrigeration system that can cool the entire unit should one of the refrigeration systems go down\n\nQuick-Turn Manufacturing\n\nFARRAR was able to support this delivery schedule due to the modular design and innovative project delivery of the manufacturing and service staff.\n\nInstallation Preparation\n\nThe GRAM team prepared to receive the freezers by lining up riggers that would lift them directly into the second story of their facility. Having pre-determined specific shelf locations for the three freezers, the team then brought electrical power to the locations. They also ensured that Environmental Monitoring System cabling and sensors were at-the-ready to terminate into the equipment to allow quick equipment power-up and to start cooling down to set point immediately.\n\nQuick-Turn Set-Up Installation and Qualification\n\nThe units were shipped on September 9, and the installation team started freezer set-up on September 12. FARRAR supported GRAM with expedited installation qualification/operational qualification (IQOQ) documentation so that immediately following start-up and commissioning, GRAM was able to execute IQ/OQ validation to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards."
