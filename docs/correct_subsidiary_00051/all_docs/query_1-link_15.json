        "text": "The OrCAD X Platform from Cadence incorporates Cadence Allegro X technology into a PCB design solution suited for quick-turn projects. It provides features like real-time insights, simplified manufacturing, and live DRCs. With user-friendly features including cloud-connected workspaces and ECAD/MCAD collaboration, engineers can seamlessly navigate schematic capture, circuit simulation, and PCB layout. General parameters encompass features like 3D Visualization, CAD modeling, collaboration, and BOM management. The software offers a free trial, supports English language use, and provides multi-user licenses for cloud-based access.\n\nThis platform supports AI Placement and Routing to automate component placement, power plane creation, and critical signal routing, enhancing design exploration. Automated Documentation maintains consistency in PCB assembly and fabrication documentation, while Supply Chain Insight offers real-time pricing, availability, and risk assessment for a vast array of parts. Additionally, the PCB Layout solution ensures a user-friendly experience, reducing the learning curve."
