AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this \"Agreement\") dated as of December 8, 1998, is by and among Quickturn Design Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\"), Cadence Design Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Parent\"), and CDSI ACQUISITION, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\"Acquisition\"). WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Acquisition have each (i) determined that the Merger (as defined below) is advisable and fair and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and (ii) approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes it is intended that the Merger qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"); WHEREAS, certain officers and employees of the Company have entered into employment and non-competition agreements, effective upon consummation of the Merger, as an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement; and WHEREAS, the Merger is intended to be treated as a \"pooling of interests\" for financial accounting purposes. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and Acquisition hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1 THE MERGER SECTION 1.1. The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined below) ---------- and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), Acquisition shall be merged with and into the Company (the \"Merger\"). Following the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the \"Surviving Corporation\") and the separate corporate existence of Acquisition shall cease. At the election of the parties, the Merger may be structured so that the Company shall be merged with and into Acquisition with the result that Acquisition shall become the \"Surviving Corporation.\" The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent, as the sole stockholder of Acquisition, hereby approves the Merger and this Agreement. SECTION 1.2. Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions set -------------- forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.3), a Certificate of Merger substantially in the form of Exhibit E (the \"Certificate --------- of Merger\") shall be duly executed and acknowledged by Acquisition and the Company and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as a properly executed copy of the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL or such later time as Parent and the Company may agree upon and as set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being referred to herein as the \"Effective Time\"). SECTION 1.3. Closing of the Merger. The closing of the Merger (the --------------------- \"Closing\") will take place at a time and on a date (the \"Closing Date\") to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article 5, at the offices of Xxxxxx, Xxxx & Xxxxxxxx LLP, Xxx Xxxxxxxxxx Xxxxxx, Xxx Xxxxxxxxx, Xxxxxxxxxx 00000, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. SECTION 1.4. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the --------------------- effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Acquisition shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. SECTION 1.5. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Certificate --------------------------------------- of Incorporation of Acquisition in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law. The bylaws of Acquisition in effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law. SECTION 1.6. Directors. The directors of Acquisition at the --------- Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such director's successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified. Section 1.7. Officers. The officers of Acquisition at the Effective -------- Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such officer's successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified. Section 1.8. Conversion of Shares. -------------------- (a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company (individually a \"Share\" and collectively the \"Shares\") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares held in the 2 Company's treasury or by any of the Company's subsidiaries and (ii) Shares held by Parent, Acquisition or any other subsidiary of Parent) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and shall become a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Parent (\"Parent Common Stock\") equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (the \"Merger Consideration\"). Unless the context otherwise requires, each reference in this Agreement to shares of Parent Common Stock and to the Shares shall include the associated Parent Rights (as such term is defined in Section 3.2(a) hereof) and associated Company Rights (as defined in Section 2.2(a)), respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or the Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares then the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares. (b) The \"Exchange Ratio\" shall be (i) $14.00 divided by (ii) the average closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock (as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions reporting system) during the five trading days immediately preceding the second business day prior to the Closing Date. (c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Acquisition shall be converted into one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. (d) At the Effective Time, each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share held by Parent, Acquisition or any subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to exist and no shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered with respect thereto. Section 1.9. Dissenters and Appraisal Rights. The holders of the ------------------------------- Shares will not be entitled to dissenters and appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Section 1.10. Exchange of Certificates. ------------------------ (a) From time to time following the Effective Time, as required by subsections (b) and (c) below, Parent shall deliver to its transfer agent, or a depository or trust institution of recognized standing selected by Parent and Acquisition (the \"Exchange Agent\") for the benefit of the holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with this Article I: (i) certificates representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8, and (ii) cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock and such cash are hereinafter referred to as the \"Exchange Fund\"), in exchange for outstanding Shares. 3 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the \"Certificates\") and whose shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.8: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and, if applicable, a check representing the cash consideration to which such holder may be entitled on account of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article I and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.10, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 1.10. (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.10(f), until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor without interest (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.10(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. (d) In the event that any Certificate for Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in 4 lieu of fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a suitable bond or indemnity. (e) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.10(c) or 1.10(f)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares; subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the date hereof that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. (f) No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall upon surrender of his or her Certificate or Certificates be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the average closing price for Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions reporting system for the five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time by the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company upon the expiration of twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as the case may be and any applicable dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. (h) Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares or Parent Common Stock as the case may be for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Section 1.11. Stock Options. ------------- (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option or warrant to purchase Shares (a \"Company Stock Option\" or collectively \"Company Stock Options\") issued pursuant to the Company's 1988 Stock Option Plan, 1990 Stock Option Plan, 1992 Key Executive Stock Option Plan, 1993 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan, 1996 5 Supplemental Stock Plan, as amended, 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended, 1994 Outside Director Stock Option Plan, Key Executive Stock Option Plan, SpeedSim, Inc. 1995 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, or other agreement or arrangement, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into options or warrants, as applicable, to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.11. All plans or agreements described above pursuant to which any Company Stock Option has been issued or may be issued other than outstanding warrants are referred to collectively as the \"Company Plans.\" Each Company Stock Option shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder of such Company Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option or warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective Time at a price per share equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (y) the product of (i) the number of Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code (\"incentive stock options\" or \"ISOs\" ) the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Company Plan and that the agreements evidencing the grants of such Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 1.11 after giving effect to the Merger). Parent shall comply with the terms of the Company Plans and ensure, to the extent required by and subject to the provisions of such Plans, that Company Stock Options that qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options of Parent after the Effective Time. (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options assumed in accordance with this Section 1.11.
