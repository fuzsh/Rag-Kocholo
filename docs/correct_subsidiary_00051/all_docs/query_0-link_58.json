        "text": "Mentor Graphics raised its unsolicited takeover offer for Quickturn Design Systems from to US$14 cash per share, or about $253 million, to match a competing offer from rival engineering software competitor Cadence Design Systems.\n\nMentor (MENT), based in Wilsonville, Oregon, said it's seeking 2.1 million Quickturn shares. Mentor already owns 591,500 Quickturn shares (QKTN) and said the additional stock would give it a 14.9 percent ownership stake in the company -- the maximum amount that can be acquired without triggering Quickturn's anti-takeover defenses, or poison pill.\n\nBoth companies publish computer programs that let electrical engineers design and test semiconductor circuits on workstations.\n\nThe Mentor bid comes on the heels of an acquisition offer from Cadence, another design software firm friendly to Quickturn. On 9 December, Cadence (CDN) offered to buy Quickturn for $14 a share, an offer that Quickturn accepted.\n\nMentor's filed a lawsuit on 15 December against Quickturn in Delaware Chancery Court, charging that Quickturn directors breached fiduciary duties. Mentor also is asking the court to block Cadence's offer.\n\nDonald Trump and Silicon Valley's Billionaire Elegy\n\nVenture capitalists Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen claim the tech industry, California, and the country are doomed if we don’t embrace the former president.\n\nRealPage Says Rental Pricing Tech Is Misunderstood, but Landlords Aren’t So Sure\n\nThe software company has pushed back hard against claims that its algorithms helped make rent in the US too damn high. Property owners and managers aren't entirely convinced.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Anthropic Used Thousands of Swiped YouTube Videos to Train AI\n\nCreators claim their videos were used without their knowledge.\n\nOpenAI Slashes the Cost of Using Its AI With a ‘Mini’ Model\n\nWith competing models—including many free ones—flooding the market, OpenAI is announcing a cheaper way to use its AI.\n\nHow to Get Rich From Peeping Inside People’s Fridges\n\nForget the S&P 500. Look at the ice cream. This investor visits homes around the world to see where diets—and economies—will go next."
