        "text": "The BSDArchitect New Edition is an updated version of the Design-for-Test (DFT) boundary scan synthesis tool. The new edition saves weeks in the design, verification and test of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), integrated circuits (ICs) and SoCs. The tool was redesigned to meet the new challenges of testing complex ICs and provide full integration into complete DFT flows such as automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) and built-in self test (BIST).\n\nDriven by the increased complexity of printed circuit board (PCB) and packaging design technology, boundary scan has become the standard methodology for testing of complex PCBs. With the migration to large SoC designs with internal and third-party IP, embedded memories and embedded software, boundary scan is now required to control complex test functions such as internal scan, BIST, and system debug. The tool automatically generates an IEEE 1149.1 compliant test controller and boundary scan circuitry, allowing designers to reduce the amount of time and resources that would be required to manually implement the circuitry.\n\nThe tool generates synthesizable RTL descriptions of the boundary scan circuitry, Boundary Scan Description Language (BSDL) files and verification testbench. It supports a fully flexible architecture, generating circuitry to support any combination of boundary scan, including private instructions. This allows support of any configuration of boundary scan, from the simplest implementations for board-level test to a full SoC test controller for internal test, manufacturing test and software debug.\n\nKey Features:\n\n Automatic synthesis of the design's IO pads to further reduce the ASIC implementation time.\n\n Support of complex IO pads such as open collector outputs and low-voltage differential inputs and outputs.\n\n Automatic generation of DC parametric tests.\n\n Direct control of memory BIST architectures, including MBISTArchitect and Memory BIST-In-Place.\n\nMentor Graphics Corporation, 8005 SW Boeckman Road, Wilsonville, OR 97070.
