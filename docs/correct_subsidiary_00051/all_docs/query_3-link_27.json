        "text": "Growing design complexity, sizes and shrinking turn-around times are representative of impending veri.cation crises for the electronics industry. To address the void in productivity from veri.cation solutions of today, Quickturn introduces a set of integrated, processor-based simulation acceleration solutions. These hardware accelerators _ Palladium and CoBALT, feature software-like compile times, scalable gate capacities, and functional congruence across all engines with a.exible upgrade path on the performance curve. The use model for these engines is simple_a single design model is compiled to target the multiple accelerator engines. Users can perform high performance simulation or debug interactively with complete design visibility on the Palladium and CoBALT accelerator engines. A design bug identi.ed during simulation acceleration on a Palladium or CoBALT engine can be debugged off-line on the software engine, thus freeing the accelerator for other users. Performance statistics from customer benchmarks validate the claims of high simulation throughputs offered by these unique and powerful high performance verification solutions."
