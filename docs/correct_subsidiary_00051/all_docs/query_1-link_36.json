It offers significant improvements to ease of use, performance and automation. Our product suite includes applications for schematic, PCB layout, simulation and data management. OrCAD X Capture, a schematic design solution for electrical circuit creation and documentation, is one of OrCAD's most popular products. PSpice®, our virtual SPICE simulation engine integrated into Capture, allows you to prototype and verify your designs using industry-leading native analog, mixed signal, and advanced analysis engines. OrCAD X Presto and OrCAD X PCB editor are two PCB layout tools that allow designers to easily collaborate between ECAD/MCAD teams and build better PCBs faster. OrCAD X Presto is our new, simplified interface for novice designers, electrical engineers and PCB designers focused on quick turn PCB designs.\n\nPricing\n\nPricing Starts At:\n\n$107 USD/month\n\nPricing Information:\n\nOrCAD X is offered in both term and perpetual licensing. Term licensing is based on a 12 month period and reduces the upfront product cost while providing access to all services. It includes support, software updates, and OrCAD X Cloud subscription. Perpetual licensing has a higher upfront cost, but allows indefinite use of the purchased version. It includes the first year of maintenance which covers support, software updates, and OrCAD X Cloud subscription. Unlike a term license maintenance must be maintained to provide continual access to support, software updates, and access to new product versions.\n\nAdditional features and license options will affect the price.\n\nFree Trial:\n\nYes\n\nIntegrations\n\nCompany Details\n\nCompany:\n\nCadence Design Systems\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1988\n\nHeadquarters:\n\nUnited States\n\nUpdate This Listing\n\nProduct Details\n\nPlatforms\n\nSaaS\n\nWindows\n\nOn-Premises\n\nType of Training\n\nDocumentation\n\nLive Online\n\nVideos\n\nCustomer Support\n\nPhone Support\n\nOnline\n\nOrCAD X Features and Options\n\nPCB Design Software\n\n3D Visualization\n\nAutorouting\n\nCollaboration Tools\n\nComponent Library\n\nDesign Rule Check\n\nDifferential Pair Routing\n\nSchematic Editor\n\nElectrical Design Software\n\nCAD Tools\n\nChange Management\n\nCollaboration\n\nCompliance Management\n\nDocument Generation\n\nDrag & Drop\n\nElectrical Parts Catalog\n\nFunctions / Calculations\n\nOne Line Diagram\n\nPLC Tools\n\nReusable Designs\n\nSymbol Library\n\nEngineering Software\n\n2D Drawing\n\n3D Modeling\n\nChemical Engineering\n\nCivil Engineering\n\nCollaboration\n\nDesign Analysis\n\nDesign Export\n\nDocument Management\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nMechatronics\n\nPresentation Tools\n\nStructural Engineering\n\nCAD Software\n\n2 1/2-Axis Milling\n\n2D Drawing\n\n3-Axis Milling\n\n3D Modeling\n\n4-Axis Milling\n\n5-Axis Milling\n\nCivil\n\nCollaboration\n\nDatabase Connectivity\n\nDesign Analysis\n\nDesign Export\n\nDocument Management\n\nElectrical\n\nHole Making\n\nMechanical\n\nMechatronics\n\nPresentation Tools\n\nSimulate Cycles\n\nSpiral Output\n\nStructural Engineering\n\nToolpath Simulation\n\nUser Defined Cycles\n\nSimulation Software\n\n1D Simulation\n\n3D Modeling\n\n3D Simulation\n\nAgent-Based Modeling\n\nContinuous Modeling\n\nDesign Analysis\n\nDirect Manipulation\n\nDiscrete Event Modeling\n\nDynamic Modeling\n\nGraphical Modeling\n\nIndustry Specific Database\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation\n\nMotion Modeling\n\nPresentation Tools\n\nStochastic Modeling\n\nTurbulence Modeling\n\nOrCAD X User Reviews\n\nWrite a Review\n\nFeatures\n\nDesign\n\nEase\n\nPricing\n\nSupport\n\nLikelihood to Recommend to Others\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nProduct Review\n\nSummary: OrCAD X has been developed with future in mind with several additional features like cloud enablement, live BoM and workspace. Features like Part Authoring, DRC browser, Integrated 3D, LiveDoc, Single exports are great enhancements from the current version. These additional features will help us to work more efficiently and collaboratively in our projects.\n\nPositive: Crypted simulation models (PSpice).\n\nIntegrated pre-layout signal integrity analysis.\n\nIntegrated impedance and coupling analysis.\n\nQuick and dynamic updates of copper under placement and routing.\n\nSupport for multi-board systems and assemblies.\n\nVersion control, templates, and component libraries stored in cloud.\n\nNegative: Mastering a new software tool can feel like learning a new language – it takes time and effort. However, these investments in learning can impact project timelines and overall productivity.\n\nRead More...\n\nFeatures\n\nDesign\n\nEase\n\nPricing\n\nSupport\n\nLikelihood to Recommend to Others\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nFinally an Easy to use GUI\n\nSummary: Powerful tool with great local support in Germany. Like all PCB tools the prices went up, but it is worth the price.\n\nPositive: Finally we get an easy to use GUI with the powerful Allegro engine under the hood. The cool features like constraint manager, DRC and DFM checks are still included. I like the new Shaddow mode.\n\nNegative: Unfortunately Artificial Intelligence is a cost option. We could really use this automatic place and route for several easy designs, too have more time for the critical ones.\n\nRead More..."
