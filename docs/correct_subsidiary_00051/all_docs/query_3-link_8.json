Cadence® licenses its leading-edge electronic design automation, or EDA, software and hardware technology and provides a range of services to companies throughout the world to help accelerate and manage their product development processes. Cadences products and services are used by companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and electronic systems, including semiconductors, computer systems and peripherals, telecommunications and networking equipment, mobile and wireless devices, automotive electronics, consumer products and other advanced electronics. These industries are experiencing a general economic slowdown. This slowdown led Cadence to record in 2001 worldwide restructuring and asset impairment charges totaling $61.6 million, inventory write downs of $18.9 million and acquired intangibles write-offs of $25.8 million.\n\nCadences headquarters are located at 2655 Seely Avenue, San Jose, California 95134. Its telephone number at that location is (408) 943-1234 and its web-site can be accessed at www.cadence.com.\n\nFactors Driving The Electronic Design Automation Industry\n\nDuring the last decade, the worldwide electronics industry has experienced expansion, driven largely by the communications, business productivity and consumer electronics markets. Ever-decreasing silicon manufacturing process geometries coupled with the move to 300mm wafer production is driving integrated circuit cost decreases, volume increases and increasingly higher complexity for providers of electronics devices. At the same time, the development of more comprehensive integrated circuits complicates effective integration of components into complete electronic systems. From a design perspective, todays complex ICs are system-on-a-chip, or SoC, devices. These SoC devices, as described in more detail below, contain one or more processors, memory and application-specific logic. Designing these SoC devices requires the convergence of what have previously been distinct domains for embedded software, digital logic, analog circuitry and printed circuit board, or PCB, design. This design convergence is changing the way companies create designs for these devices. These market and technology forces pose major challenges for the global electronics design community, and consequently create significant opportunities and challenges for EDA tools and services providers.\n\nThe electronics industry is faced with increasing complexity of electronic devices. Design teams face major challenges in the migration to deep submicron design and SoC design.\n\nDeep submicron design refers to the design of integrated circuits that will have feature sizes smaller than 0.25 micron. IC feature sizes for wires, transistors and contacts decrease with each advance in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Each successive move to a smaller feature size (e.g., decreasing from 0.25 microns to 0.13 microns and smaller) requires introducing new capabilities throughout the entire design\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\nand manufacturing flow to account for new physical effects. For example, at 0.13 microns signal integrity issues such as crosstalk, IR (voltage) drop, and substrate noise have become critical.\n\nSoC design refers to implementing an entire electronics sub-system on a single integrated circuit. Smaller feature sizes make it more economical to put additional circuitry on a single die. The ICs fabricated on these dies include one or more processors (microprocessors and digital signal processors), a high-performance bus, numerous memory devices and peripherals, custom digital logic, custom analog logic and millions of lines of software code. Such devices offer benefits in terms of price, performance, power and size. However, they are extremely difficult to design.\n\nThese trends pose significant new challenges for electronics design teams. Specifically, deep submicron design requires designers to take into account many physical effects they previously ignored. SoC design requires new approaches to managing complexity and its related risks. The electronics industry addresses these challenges in a number of ways, including the use of new EDA tools, the upgrade of design methodologies, and offering integrated front-to-back design solutions.\n\nCadence Electronic Design Automation Tools\n\nCadence offers the most comprehensive set of EDA tools in its industry. Cadence tools improve designer productivity and design quality throughout the electronic design process.\n\nSystem-level Design Tools\n\nCadence system-level design tools help design teams optimize their designs and provide a smooth path to detailed hardware design. The Cadence Virtual Component Co-design, or VCC, solution lets designers capture and verify system behavior independent of hardware and software implementation. Designers can then map the behavior to a variety of architectural implementations and analyze the results of each. Using this rapid exploration tool, teams can optimize their overall system-level design including critical hardware/software partitioning. VCC is also an ideal environment for platform-based design. For those portions of the behavior that are algorithmic in nature, the Cadence Signal Processing Worksystem solution provides a specialized environment for capturing and analyzing floating-point and fixed-point algorithms. It also serves as a system-level testbench environment, especially for communications and multimedia applications.\n\nFunctional and System-level Verification Tools\n\nDesign teams need a range of simulation and hardware-based acceleration tools to verify the functionality of their designs. Cadence offers a comprehensive set of simulators and emulators for behavioral, register-transfer-level and gate-level functional verification. Cadences digital simulators include the NC-Verilog® simulator for the Verilog® language, NC-VHDL for the VHDL® language and NC-Sim, which simultaneously supports both languages. These simulators provide designers with the simulation performance and capacity they need to verify the functionality of complex designs. The Cadence Verification Cockpit provides an environment for creating testbenches, analyzing results and debugging designs at a transaction level. Cadence also provides standards-based transaction verification models for use in this environment.\n\nFor design teams that need to accelerate simulations and/or verify designs at the system-level, the Cadence Quickturn® division offers acceleration and emulation solutions. PalladiumTM and CoBALT Ultra Design Verification Systems are built with 0.12 micron, custom silicon technology and are used for both simulation acceleration and in-circuit emulation. MercuryTMPlus utilizes custom field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, and is used specifically for in-circuit emulation. Cadence also offers application-specific solutions that provide a complete verification environment for key applications such as 3G wireless communication, Packet over SONET networking, and other popular applications. The use of Quickturn solutions enables design teams to identify hardware and software problems that they would otherwise not find until the design is implemented in silicon.\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAutomated Digital IC Design Tools\n\nCadences unified synthesis/place-and-route system, or SP&R, provides a complete implementation path from register-transfer level, or RTL, through final layout for the most advanced designs. The SP&R system consists of Physically Knowledgeable Synthesis, or PKS, physical synthesis for front-end logic design and Silicon Ensemble® PKS, or SE-PKS optimization-place-and-route for back-end physical design. PKS provides simultaneous logic synthesis, placement and global routing. Silicon Ensemble-PKS provides a complete place-and-route environment, including the ability to re-optimize a designs logic to meet new physical constraints. These tools have common timing, optimization, placement and routing engines to ensure single-pass accuracy as the design progresses from RTL to final layout. The SP&R flow supports power optimization, test synthesis and datapath compilation capabilities for automated digital design. With the CadMOSTM suite of tools, Cadence now also offers an enhanced solution for signal integrity problems  such as crosstalk  that become more prevalent and critical at 0.13 micron and below designs. For leading-edge physical verification, Cadence offers the AssuraTM physical verification toolset created specifically for deep submicron designs.\n\nIn December 2001, Cadence acquired Silicon Perspective Corporation, which produces the First Encounter® full-chip virtual prototyping solution. Design teams use the First Encounter solution to plan the physical implementation of large, hierarchical designs.\n\nCustom and Analog Design Tools\n\nCadence offers a comprehensive line of analog and mixed-signal design tools. Cadence Analog Design Environment is a front-to-back analog design automation solution for full-custom analog, digital mixed-signal and radio frequency, or RF, integrated circuit design. Within that environment, designers can use the Cadence Spectre® Circuit Simulator. RF designers can use the Cadence Spectre RF simulator on desktop workstations to perform full-chip, transistor-level circuit simulation of RF designs with 5,000+ devices.\n\nThe Cadence Virtuoso® suite of custom IC layout tools provides a comprehensive set of layout capabilities including layout editing, placement, routing and physical verification for analog, custom digital mixed signal and RF ICs. Virtuoso Custom IC Layout includes correct-by-construction, connectivity-driven automation that dramatically boosts designer productivity over manual custom-layout techniques. Virtuoso Custom IC Layout is integrated with the Cadence Assura physical verification toolset, which offers automated, interactive physical and batch IC layout verification, extraction and layout enhancements for manufacturing. The Assura tool utilizes hierarchical processing techniques to significantly reduce verification cycle times and provide effective debugging capabilities.\n\nFor years, analog/mixed-signal design teams have been seeking to move to a top-down approach. Cadence AMS Designer enables them to do so. It is a mixed-signal environment and analog/mixed-signal simulator, the latter of which is based on the Cadence NC-Sim and Spectre simulators.\n\nPrinted Circuit Board Design Tools\n\nCadence offers a range of integrated PCB design solutions for both individual and team-based environments. For teams creating leading edge designs, Cadence provides a full front-to-back flow. Products include Allegro®, PCB layout, Concept® HDL schematic capture, PCB librarian expert, SPECCTRA® autorouter and SPECCTRAQuestTM for design and analysis of high-speed digital systems. Recent product introductions focus on the challenges of integrating high-speed ICs into a board system. A new constraint management system targets the problem of escalating electrical constraints by allowing engineers to capture, manage and validate high-speed design rules at all stages of the design cycle. Advances in signal integrity and power delivery technologies enable engineers to analyze the interconnect from silicon to package to board.\n\nFor individual productivity in the Windows-based PCB design market, Cadence offers the OrCAD® product line of integrated tools. Products include OrCAD Capture® schematic entry, PSpice® analog and mixed signal simulator and OrCAD Layout®.\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFor IC packaging design, the Cadence Advanced Package Designer and Advanced Package Engineer environments integrate electrical analysis and physical design through all phases of development, bridging the gaps between IC design, package design and package analysis.\n\nThird-Party Tool and Partner Support\n\nCadence supports the integration of third-party design tools through its Connections® Program. The Connections Program provides other EDA companies with access to Cadence products to ensure that Cadence tools work well in any design environment. To date, more than 130 companies have integrated their tools with Cadence software. Additionally, Cadence manages relationships with foundry and library provider partners to support customer-owned tooling, or COT, solutions for its customers. Cadence also assists and supports library providers in the integration of Cadence design and verification tools and model formats into COT library solutions.\n\nElectronic Design Automation Services\n\nTo complement its tools, Cadence provides a range of electronic design services that help optimize design team productivity. These include educational, support, design, verification, application service provider, or ASP, and methodology services. Cadences educational services include Internet, classroom and custom courses, the content of which ranges from how to use the most recent tool features to the latest design techniques. Support services include product maintenance and updates, and telephone and Internet-based technical support. Cadence also offers custom support services, which may include one or more of its standard support services plus account technical management, application and educational services and metrics reporting. Maintenance and support agreements are offered to customers either as part of Cadence product license agreement or under a separate maintenance agreement.\n\nDesign Services (Tality)\n\nIn 2000, Cadence separated its electronics design services group into a new company named Tality Corporation. Tality filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for Talitys initial public offering, or IPO. Talitys separation from Cadence was substantially completed on October 4, 2000, and the electronic design services business operated as a subsidiary of Cadence. In April 2001, Cadence announced the withdrawal of the Tality IPO registration statement. Tality was reorganized during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2001, and is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cadence.\n\nTalitys engineering services and intellectual property are used for the design of complex electronic systems and integrated circuits. Tality focuses its offerings primarily on the communications market. Targeted segments of this market include wireline and wireless communications infrastructure and consumer communications products. The engineering services extend from product concept through manufacturing to help communications companies implement their product plans. Talitys business has been adversely affected by the general slowdown in the economy and the electronics industry specifically. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.\n\nVerification and ASP Services\n\nCadences Quickturn division offers verification and ASP services through TtME® (Time-to-Market Engineering) services and the QuickCyclesTM programs. The TtME staff provides customers with consulting services, project services and/or complete turnkey services. QuickCyclesTM allows customers to access Quickturn verification systems on a pay-as-you-go basis, either on the customer site or remotely over a high-speed, secure network connection.\n\nMethodology Services\n\nCadences Methodology Services group offers a variety of services to help customers address electronic design challenges. It leverages Cadences cumulative experience and knowledge of design practices to improve productivity. Cadence has begun offering virtual computer aided design, known as VCAD, through which\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nengineering teams at one or more Cadence locations provide technical support through a virtual private network to customer design groups located at the customers design sites.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nCadence generally uses a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers to license its products and market its consulting and design services to prospective customers. Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales as well as post-sales support for software products. The Cadence Methodology Services group provides on-site capabilities to help customers improve productivity with Cadence and other EDA products. Due to the complexity of EDA products and the electronic design process in general, the sales cycle is generally long (three to six months or more). During the sales cycle, the Cadence direct sales force generally provides technical presentations, product demonstrations and on-site customer evaluations of Cadence software. Cadence also uses traditional marketing approaches to promote its products and services, including advertising, direct mail, telemarketing, trade shows, public relations and the Internet.\n\nCadence markets and supports its products and services internationally through its subsidiaries and various distributors. Cadence markets its emulation hardware and consulting and design services in Japan through a wholly-owned subsidiary. Since the reorganization of Cadences distribution channel in Japan in 1997, Cadence has licensed its software products through Innotech Corporation, in which Cadence is an approximately 15% stockholder as of December 29, 2001.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nCadences investment in research and development was $327.5 million in 2001, $292.4 million in 2000, and $244.9 million in 1999, prior to capitalizing software development costs of $30.2 million, $28.4 million, and $25.7 million, respectively. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of Cadences capitalization of certain software development costs.\n\nThe primary areas of Cadences research include SoC design, the design of silicon devices in the deep submicron range, high-speed board design, architectural-level design, high-performance logic verification technology and hardware/ software co-design.\n\nCadences advanced research and development group, Cadence Laboratories, is focused on new technology. This group is chartered with identifying and developing prototype technologies in emerging design areas that will offer substantially improved alternatives to current EDA solutions.\n\nCompetition\n\nIn the EDA products industry, Cadence currently competes with three large companies: Avant! Corporation, Mentor Graphics Corporation and Synopsys, Inc. In December 2001, Avant! and Synopsys announced their intention to merge, and if this merger is completed, the combined company could improve its competitive position with respect to Cadence. Cadence also competes with numerous smaller companies, a number of which have become publicly-traded companies or have combined with other EDA companies. Cadence also competes with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to internally develop their own EDA products. Many manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as Cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments. In the electronics design and methodology services industries, Cadence competes with numerous electronic design and consulting companies as well as with the internal design capabilities of electronics manufacturers. Other electronics companies and management consulting firms continue to enter the electronics design and methodology services industries.\n\nThe EDA product market and the commercial electronic design and methodology services industries are highly competitive. If Cadence were unable to compete successfully in these industries, it could seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition. To compete in these industries, Cadence must identify and develop innovative and cost-competitive EDA products and market them in a timely manner. It must also gain industry acceptance for its design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts,\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\ntechnical solutions, prices and response time, or a combination of these benefits, than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers. Cadence cannot assure you that it will be able to compete successfully in these industries.\n\nProprietary Technology\n\nCadences success depends, in part, upon its proprietary technology. Cadence generally relies on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in technology and products. Despite precautions Cadence may take to protect its intellectual property, Cadence cannot assure you that third parties will not try to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these safeguards. Cadence also cannot assure you that the rights granted under its patents will provide it with any competitive advantages, patents will be issued on any of its pending applications, or future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect Cadences technology. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect Cadences proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as U.S. law protects these rights in the United States. Many Cadence products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. Cadence may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future. The Cadence design services business also requires it to license the software or other intellectual property of third parties, including that of competitors. Cadences failure to obtain for its use software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights, could seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nManufacturing and Distribution\n\nCadence software production operations consist of configuring the proper version of a product, outsourcing the recording of the product on magnetic tape or CD-ROM, and producing customer-unique access keys allowing customers to use licensed products. Software and documentation are generally made available to customers electronically by secured electronic delivery, and to selected customers by electronic distribution over the Internet. User manuals and other documentation are generally available on CD-ROM, but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format.\n\nCadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware emulation products in San Jose, California. Subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies, including all individual printed circuit boards and custom integrated circuits, and supply them to Cadence for qualification and testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product.\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of March 2, 2002, Cadence employed approximately 5,600 persons, with approximately 2,975 in sales, services, marketing, support and manufacturing activities, 1,800 in product development and 825 in management, administration and finance. None of Cadences employees is represented by a labor union, and Cadence has experienced no work stoppages. Cadence believes that its employee relations are good.\n\nFactors That May Affect Future Results\n\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones Cadence faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to Cadence or that Cadence currently deems immaterial also may impair Cadences business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, Cadences business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. Unless specifically noted, references to Cadence in the discussion below are references to Cadence and its subsidiaries.\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCadence is subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries, and\n\nthe current downturn or any future downturns may reduce Cadence revenue\n\nPurchases of Cadences products and services are highly dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by integrated circuit manufacturers and electronics systems companies. The integrated circuit industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The integrated circuit and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both these companies and their customers products and a decline in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. During these downturns, the number of new design projects may decrease. Certain integrated circuit manufacturers and electronics systems companies announced a slowdown of demand and production in 2001 which has continued in 2002. Services and hardware revenue is expected to continue to be adversely affected by the general slowdown in the economy and in the electronics industry specifically. The current slowdown and any future downturns may reduce Cadences software and maintenance revenue and further reduce its services and hardware revenue and harm its results of operations.\n\nFluctuations in quarterly results of operations could hurt Cadences business and the market price of its\n\nstock\n\nCadence has experienced, and may continue to experience, varied quarterly operating results. Various factors affect Cadences quarterly operating results and some of them are not entirely within Cadences control, including the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to sell products. See Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  Critical Accounting Policies. Cadences quarterly operating results are affected by the timing of significant orders for its software products because a significant number of contracts for software products are in excess of $5.0 million. The failure to close a contract for the sale of one or more orders of Cadences software products could seriously harm its quarterly operating results.\n\nCadences quarterly operating results are affected by the mix of license types entered into in connection with the sale of software products. Cadence has three basic licensing models: term, subscription and perpetual. Term and perpetual licenses generally recognize the revenue for such licenses at the beginning of the license period, while subscription licenses recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Cadences mix of software license types based on total contract value was approximately 50% term licenses, 40% subscription licenses and 10% perpetual licenses. Should different conditions prevail so that the mix of Cadences license types were to change to a higher proportion of subscription licenses, Cadences software license revenue in that period would decline because a greater portion of revenue would be recognized over time. That decline could have a material impact on the results of operations in the quarter of the change in mix.\n\nSales of Cadences hardware products depend, in significant part, upon the decision of the prospective customer to commence a project for the design and development of complex integrated circuits and systems. These projects often require significant commitments of time and capital. Cadences hardware sales may be delayed if customers delay commencement of projects. Lengthy hardware sales cycles subject Cadence to a number of significant risks over which Cadence has little or no control, including insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results.\n\nIn addition, Cadence bases its expense budgets partially on its expectations of future revenue. However, it is difficult to predict revenue levels or growth. Revenue levels that are below Cadences expectations could seriously hurt Cadences business, operating results and financial condition. Also, because of the timing of large orders and its customers buying patterns, Cadence may not learn of revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter, which could cause even more immediate and serious harm to the trading price of Cadence common stock. Many of Cadences services engagements are terminable with little or no advance notice and without penalty. Since a significant portion of\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthe costs of services is labor-related, Cadence may not be able to reduce its costs in a timely manner to respond to an unanticipated revenue loss when one or more projects are terminated.\n\nCadence believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its results of operations may not be meaningful. Therefore, stockholders should not view Cadences historical results of operations as reliable indicators of its future performance. If revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts and investors, the trading price of Cadence common stock could decline dramatically.\n\nThe lengthy sales cycle of Cadences products and services makes the timing of its revenue difficult to\n\npredict and may cause its operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly\n\nCadence has a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends at least three to six months. The length of the sales cycle may cause Cadences revenue and operating results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter. The complexity and expense associated with Cadences business generally requires a lengthy customer education and approval process. Consequently, Cadence may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent Cadence from pursuing other opportunities.\n\nIn addition, sales of Cadence products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of:\n\n Customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures;  The timing of customers budget cycles; or  The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes.\n\nIf customers experience delays in their approval or project commencement activities, Cadence may not learn of, and therefore be able to communicate to the public, revenue or earnings shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter.\n\nCadences failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make its products uncompetitive\n\nand obsolete\n\nThe industries in which Cadence competes experience rapid technology developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements. Currently, the electronic IC design industry is experiencing several revolutionary trends:\n\n Migration to Deep SubMicron: The size of features such as wires, transistors and contacts on ICs is shrinking due to advances in semiconductor manufacturing processes. Process feature sizes refer to the width of the transistors and the width and spacing of the interconnect on the IC. Feature size is normally identified by the headline transistor length, which is shrinking from 0.25 microns to 0.13 microns and smaller. This is commonly referred to in the semiconductor industry as the migration to deep submicron. It represents a major challenge for all levels of the semiconductor industry, from IC design and design automation to design of manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process itself. Shrinkage of transistor length to such infinitesimal proportions (for reference, the diameter of the period at the end of this sentence is approximately 400 microns) is challenging fundamental laws of physics and chemistry.  The ability to design very large ICs, in particular integration of entire electronic systems onto a single chip instead of a circuit board (a process that is referred to in the industry as SoC), increases the complexity of managing a design that at the lowest level is represented by billions of shapes on the fabrication mask. In addition, systems typically incorporate microprocessors and digital signal processors that are programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of the silicon chip and the related embedded software on the chip.\n\nIf Cadence is unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments and the evolution of these changes, Cadence may lose its competitive position and its products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete. To compete successfully, Cadence must develop or acquire new products and improve its existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments in its\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nindustries. Cadence must also be able to support a range of changing computer software, hardware platforms and customer preferences. There is no guarantee that Cadence will be successful in this respect.\n\nCadence has historically suffered losses in its electronics design services business\n\nThe market for electronics design services is relatively new, rapidly evolving and sensitive to customer budgetary constraints and engineering capacity. Tality has historically suffered losses, and it incurred significant expenses in connection with its separation. If Tality fails to increase its revenue to offset its expenses, Tality will continue to experience losses. Talitys failure to succeed in the design services business may seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe success of Cadences services businesses depend on factors that are difficult to control\n\nIn order to be successful with its services, Cadence must overcome several factors that are difficult to control, including the following:\n\n Cadences cost of services personnel is high and reduces gross margin. Gross margin represents the difference between the amount of revenue from the sale of services and Cadences cost of providing those services. Cadence must pay high salaries to attract and retain professional services personnel. This results in a lower gross margin than the gross margin in Cadences software business. In addition, the high cost of training new services personnel or not fully utilizing these personnel can significantly lower gross margin, and it is difficult to adjust staffing levels quickly to reflect customer demand for services.  A substantial portion of these services contracts is fixed-price contracts. This means that the customer pays a fixed price that has been agreed upon ahead of time, no matter how much time or how many resources Cadence must devote to perform the contract. If Cadences cost in performing the services consistently and significantly exceeds the amount the customer has agreed to pay, it could seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nCadences inability to compete in its industries could seriously harm its business\n\nThe EDA market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive. If Cadence were unable to compete successfully in these industries, it could seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition. To compete in these industries, Cadence must identify and develop innovative and cost competitive EDA software products and market them in a timely manner. It must also gain industry acceptance for its design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts, technical solutions, prices and response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers. Cadence cannot assure you that it will be able to compete successfully in these industries. Factors that could affect Cadences ability to succeed include:\n\n The development of competitive EDA products and design and methodology services could result in a shift of customer preferences away from Cadences products and services and significantly decrease revenue;  The electronics design and methodology services industries are relatively new and electronics design companies and manufacturers are only beginning to purchase these services from outside vendors;  Due to budgeting constraints or excess engineering capacity, electronics manufacturers often choose to perform design and methodology services internally, rather than purchase these services from outside vendors;  The pace of technology change demands continuous technological development to meet the requirements of next-generation design challenges; and  There are a significant number of current and potential competitors in the EDA industry and the cost of entry is low.\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn the EDA products industry, Cadence currently competes with three large companies: Avant! Corporation, Mentor Graphics Corporation, and Synopsys, Inc. In December 2001, Synopsys and Avant! announced their intention to merge, and if this merger is completed, the combined company could improve its competitive position with respect to Cadence. Cadence also competes with numerous smaller companies, a number of which have become publicly-traded companies or have combined with other EDA companies. Cadence also competes with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own EDA products. Many manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as Cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments. In the electronics design and methodology services industries, Cadence competes with numerous electronic design and consulting companies as well as with the internal design capabilities of electronics manufacturers. Other electronics companies and management consulting firms continue to enter the electronic design and methodology services industries.\n\nCadences failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or adequately protect its\n\nproprietary rights could seriously harm its business\n\nCadences success depends, in part, upon its proprietary technology. Many of Cadences products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, and Cadence may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future. Cadences design services business also requires it to license software or other intellectual property of third parties, including that of competitors. Cadences failure to obtain for its use software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights, could seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nAlso, Cadence generally relies on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in technology and products. Despite precautions Cadence may take to protect its intellectual property, Cadence cannot assure you that third parties will not try to challenge, invalidate, or circumvent these safeguards. Cadence also cannot assure you that the rights granted under its patents will provide it with any competitive advantages, patents will be issued on any of its pending applications, or future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect Cadences technology. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect Cadences proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as U.S. law protects these rights in the United States.\n\nCadence cannot assure you that its reliance on licenses from or to or restrictive agreements with third parties, or that patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections, will be enough to be successful and profitable in the industries in which Cadence competes.\n\nIntellectual property infringement by or against Cadence could seriously harm its business\n\nThere are numerous patents in the EDA industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not always economically practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others. As a result, from time to time, Cadence may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect its rights or defend a customers rights. These claims, regardless of merit, could consume valuable management time, result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays, all of which could seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition. In settling these claims, Cadence may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may not have terms acceptable to Cadence. Being forced to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition. Any potential intellectual property litigation could force Cadence to do one or more of the following:\n\n Pay damages to the party claiming infringement;  Stop licensing, or providing services that use, the challenged intellectual property;  Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or  Redesign the challenged technology, which could be time-consuming and costly.\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIf Cadence were forced to take any of these actions, Cadences business and results of operations may be harmed.\n\nCadence obtains key components for its hardware products from a limited number of suppliers\n\nCadence depends on several suppliers for certain key components and board assemblies used in its hardware-based verification products. Cadences inability to develop alternative sources or to obtain sufficient quantities of these components or board assemblies could result in delays or reductions in product shipments. In particular, Cadence currently relies on IBM for the hardware components for Cadences CoBALTTM, MercuryTMPLUS and PalladiumTM products. Other disruptions in supply may also occur. If there were such a reduction or interruption, Cadences results of operations would be seriously harmed. Even if Cadence can eventually obtain these components from alternative sources, a significant delay in Cadences ability to deliver products would result.\n\nCadence expects to acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate them or the companies it\n\nhas recently acquired\n\nCadence has acquired numerous other businesses before and is likely to acquire other businesses in the future. While Cadence expects to analyze carefully all potential transactions before committing to them, Cadence cannot assure you that any transaction that is completed will result in long-term benefits to Cadence or its stockholders, or that Cadences management will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively. In addition, growth through acquisition involves a number of risks. If any of the following events occurs after Cadence acquires another business, it could seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition:\n\n Difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit;  The substantial diversion of managements attention from day-to-day business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and then integrating an acquired business;  The discovery after the acquisition has been completed of liabilities assumed from the acquired business;  The failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;  The failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business;  Difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business in, for example, distribution, engineering and customer support areas;  Unanticipated costs;  Adverse effects on existing relationships with suppliers and customers; and  Failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which Cadence has limited previous experience.\n\nCadences international operations may seriously harm its financial condition because of several weak\n\nforeign economies and the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations\n\nCadence has significant operations outside the United States. Cadences revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 45% for fiscal 2001 and 44% for fiscal 2000. Cadence also transacts business in various foreign currencies. Recent economic and political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies in certain parts of the Asia-Pacific region have had, and may continue to have, a seriously harmful effect on Cadences revenue and operating results.\n\nFluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of other countries in which Cadence conducts business could seriously harm its business, operating results and financial condition. For example, if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges into U.S. dollars, it will take more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of U.S. dollars than before the rate increase. If Cadence prices its products and services in the foreign currency, it will receive less in U.S. dollars than it did before the rate increase went into effect. If Cadence prices its products and services in U.S. dollars, an increase in the exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for Cadences products and services\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncompared to those products of its competitors that are priced in local currency. This could result in Cadences prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency. Cadences international operations may also be subject to other risks, including:\n\n The adoption and expansion of government trade restrictions;  Volatile foreign exchange rates and currency conversion risks;  Limitations on repatriation of earnings;  Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;  Recessions in foreign economies;  Longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;  Difficulties in managing foreign operations;  Political and economic instability;  Business interruptions from terrorism, military operations and war;  Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  Tariffs and other trade barriers; and  U.S. government licensing requirements for exports which make licenses difficult to obtain.\n\nCadence expects that revenue from its international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue.\n\nExposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of a Cadence subsidiary. A subsidiarys functional currency is the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations, including product pricing, expenses and borrowings. Cadence uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency put options to help protect against currency exchange risks. These forward contracts and put options allow Cadence to buy or sell specific foreign currencies at specific prices on specific dates. Increases or decreases in the value of Cadences foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses on these forward contracts and put options. Although Cadence attempts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, significant exchange rate movements may hurt Cadences results of operations as expressed in U.S. dollars.\n\nForeign currency exchange risk occurs for some of Cadences foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency. The primary effect of foreign currency translation on Cadences results of operations is a reduction in revenue from a strengthening U.S. dollar, offset by a smaller reduction in expenses. Exchange rate gains and losses on the translation into U.S. dollars of amounts denominated in foreign currencies are included as a separate component of stockholders equity.\n\nFailure to obtain export licenses could harm Cadences business\n\nCadence must comply with U.S. Department of Commerce regulations in shipping its software products and other technologies outside the United States. Although Cadence has not had any significant difficulty complying with these regulations so far, any significant future difficulty in complying could harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nCadences failure to attract, train, motivate and retain key employees may harm its business\n\nCompetition for highly skilled employees is very intense. Cadences business depends on the efforts and abilities of its senior management, its research and development staff, and a number of other key management, sales, support, technical and services personnel. The high cost of training new personnel, not fully utilizing these personnel, or losing trained personnel to competing employers could reduce Cadences gross margins and harm its business and operating results. Competition for these personnel is intense, particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the Silicon Valley area, where Cadences principal offices are located, and the other locations where it maintains facilities. To attract and retain individuals with the requisite expertise, Cadence may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Cadence may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm its operating results. If Cadence does not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications, it will not be able to grow its business and its\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\noperating results will suffer. Cadences failure to attract, train, motivate and retain key employees would impair its development of new products, its ability to provide design and methodology services and the management of its businesses. This would seriously harm Cadences business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nIf Cadence becomes subject to unfair hiring claims, Cadence could be prevented from hiring needed\n\npersonnel, incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending itself\n\nCompanies in Cadences industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. These claims could prevent Cadence from hiring personnel or cause it to incur liability for damages. Cadence could also incur substantial costs in defending itself or its employees against these claims, regardless of their merits. Defending itself from these claims could also divert the attention of Cadences management away from its operations.\n\nErrors or defects in Cadences products and services could expose it to liability and harm its reputation\n\nCadences customers use its products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity, each of which has its own specifications. Because of the complexity of the systems and products with which Cadence works, some of its products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, its customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in Cadences software or the systems Cadence designs, or the products or systems incorporating its design and intellectual property may not operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:\n\n Loss of current customers and loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share;  Failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;  Diversion of development resources to resolving the problem;  Increased service costs; and  Liability for damages.\n\nAnti-takeover defenses in Cadences charter, by-laws, and under Delaware law could prevent an acquisition\n\nof Cadence or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for Cadence common stock\n\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that apply to Cadence and its Certificate of Incorporation could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of Cadence. For example:\n\n Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner, unless specified conditions are met.  Cadences Certificate of Incorporation allows Cadences Board of Directors to issue, at any time and without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However, the rights of holders of any Cadence preferred stock that may be issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of its common stock.  Cadence has a rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill, which would make it difficult for someone to acquire Cadence without the approval of Cadences Board of Directors.\n\nAll or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of Cadence common stock and could delay, prevent or allow Cadences Board of Directors to resist an acquisition of Cadence, even if the proposed transaction was favored by a majority of Cadences independent stockholders.\n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\n\nItem 2. Properties\n\nCadences headquarters are located in San Jose, California, and Cadence owns the related land and buildings. Additionally, Cadence owns buildings in India and land and buildings in Scotland. The total square footage of Cadences owned buildings is approximately 984,000 square feet.\n\nCadence leases additional facilities for its sales offices in the United States and various foreign countries, and its research and development and design services facilities in the United States and in foreign countries including the United Kingdom and India. Cadence subleases certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been involved in restructuring activities.\n\nCadence believes that these facilities and the undeveloped land it owns adjacent to its current headquarters are adequate for its current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of Cadences operations.\n\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations matters.\n\nCadence filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on December 6, 1995 against Avant! Corporation and certain of its employees or agents for misappropriation of trade secrets, copyright infringement, conspiracy and other illegal acts involving intellectual property.\n\nOn January 16, 1996, Avant! filed various counterclaims against Cadence and Joseph B. Costello, Cadences former President and Chief Executive Officer, and with leave of the court, on January 29, 1998, filed a second amended counterclaim. The second amended counterclaim alleges, inter alia, that Cadence and Mr. Costello had cooperated with the Santa Clara County, California, District Attorney and initiated and pursued its complaint against Avant! for anti-competitive reasons, engaged in wrongful activity in an attempt to manipulate Avant!s stock price, and utilized certain pricing policies and other acts to unfairly compete against Avant! in the marketplace. The second amended counterclaim also alleges that certain Cadence insiders engaged in illegal insider trading with respect to Avant!s stock. Cadence and Mr. Costello believe that they have meritorious defenses to Avant!s claims, and each intends to defend such action vigorously. By an order dated July 13, 1996, the court bifurcated Avant!s counterclaim from Cadences complaint and stayed the counterclaim pending resolution of Cadences complaint. The counterclaim remains stayed.\n\nIn an order issued on December 19, 1997, as modified on January 26, 1998, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction barring Avant! from any further infringement of Cadences copyrights in Design Framework II® software, or selling, licensing or copying such product derived from Design Framework II, including, but not limited to, Avant!s ArcCell products. On December 7, 1998, the District Court issued a further preliminary injunction, which enjoined Avant! from selling its Aquarius product line. Cadence posted a $10.0 million bond in connection with the issuance of the preliminary injunction. On July 30, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction.\n\nOn July 25, 2001, Avant! was ordered to pay Cadence $194.6 million in criminal restitution after Avant! entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the Superior Court of the State of California of conspiracy to take and use Cadences trade secrets. This conspiracy included the theft by Avant! and certain individuals of Cadence intellectual property, including software code, as well as other trade secrets. As of December 29, 2001, approximately $196.0 million, consisting of all of the restitution award plus interest was received. This amount was recorded in restructuring, asset impairment and unusual items in Cadences Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOn September 7, 1999, the District Court ruled on the parties Motions for Summary Adjudication, and granted in part, and denied in part, each partys motion regarding the scope of a June 6, 1994 Release Agreement between the parties. The court held that Cadences copyright infringement claim against Avant! is not barred by the release and that Cadence may proceed on that claim. The court also held that Cadences\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\ntrade secret claim based on Avant!s use, prior to June 1994, of Cadences Design Framework II source code is barred by the release. On May 15, 2001, the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments by both parties on their appeals from the District Courts order. On June 11, 2001, the Ninth Circuit certified a question of California law to the California Supreme Court and stayed the case. On October 31, 2001, the California Supreme Court agreed to accept such certification.\n\nIn February 1998, Aptix Corporation and Meta Systems, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Quickturn Design Systems, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Quickturn infringed a U.S. patent owned by Aptix and licensed to Meta. In June 2000, the District Court entered judgment in favor of Quickturn, dismissing the complaint and declaring the patent unenforceable. The Court also granted summary judgment to Aptix, denying Quickturns abuse of process counterclaim. On September 8, 2000 the Court ordered Aptix to pay $4.2 million to Quickturn as reimbursement of attorneys fees and costs it incurred in the litigation. Aptix appealed the Districts Courts judgment and posted a $2.0 million bond to secure the judgment. On June 8, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Courts dismissal of Quickturns abuse of process counterclaim. On November 5, 2001, the Federal Circuit vacated the District Courts judgment of unenforceability, but affirmed the District Courts dismissal of Aptixs and Metas complaint and the award of attorneys fees and costs.\n\nOn January 7, 1999, in a suit captioned Mentor Graphics Corporation, et al. v. Lobo, et al., Delaware Chancery Court, New Castle County, Civ. Action No. 16843-NC (Mentor II), Mentor filed and served an amended complaint asserting claims against Cadence, Quickturn and the Quickturn Board of Directors for declaratory and injunctive relief for various alleged breaches of fiduciary duty purportedly owned by Quickturn and its Board of Directors to Quickturns shareholders in connection with the merger between Quickturn and Cadence. Mentor further alleged that Cadence aided and abetted Quickturn and its Board of Directors in those purported breaches. Mentor has not prosecuted the matter since January 1999. In May 2000, Mentor advised the Delaware Chancery Court of its objection to the settlement of a companion action brought on behalf of certain Quickturn shareholders, and sought an award of attorneys fees related to its prosecution of Mentor II as well as the prior related action, to which Cadence was not a party. Settlement of the companion action is conditioned upon approval of the Chancery Court and Mentors not being awarded attorneys fee for Mentor II. In an order dated August 17, 2001, the Chancery Court denied Mentors fee application. Mentor has indicated that it will appeal this order.\n\nOn July 21, 1999, Mentor filed suit against Quickturn, which action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C 99-5464. Mentor has alleged that Quickturns MercuryTM and MercuryTMPlus hardware emulation systems infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 5,777,489 and 5,790,832, allegedly assigned to Mentor. At Quickturns request, Cadence was added as a defendant. Quickturn and Cadence are vigorously defending themselves against Mentors claims, and have filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of these patents.\n\nOn March 24, 2000, Mentor and Meta and several founders of Meta filed suit against Quickturn and Cadence and a former Quickturn employee in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C-00-01030. The suit alleges infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,574,832 allegedly assigned to Mentor, misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of confidence, and seeks unspecified damages, injunctive relief and the assignment to Mentor of a patent previously issued to Quickturn. Quickturn and Cadence are vigorously defending themselves against these claims, and have filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,754,827, 5,999,725 and 6,057,706 allegedly assigned to Mentor.\n\nOn September 11, 2000, Mentor filed a complaint against Quickturn and Cadence in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C-00-03291, accusing Quickturn and Cadence of infringing U.S. Patent No. 5,574,388, purportedly owned by Mentor, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Cadence and Quickturn are vigorously defending themselves against Mentors claim, and have filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement of this patent. The parties have agreed to consolidate this action with Civil Action Nos. C 99-5464 and C 00-01030, described above, for purposes of discovery and pre-trial motions. A trial date has been set for October 7, 2002. Meanwhile, on November 3,\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\n2000, Mentor filed a motion for preliminary injunction, asking the Court to prohibit the sale of Quickturns MercuryPlus emulation systems prior to trial of this action. The Court denied the motion for preliminary injunction on August 30, 2001, stating that Quickturn and Cadence had raised substantial questions regarding the validity of U.S. Patent No. 5,574,388. However, the Court also stated that Mentor had demonstrated likelihood of success in proving that Quickturns MercuryPlus emulation systems infringe Claims 1 and 5 of the patent. Mentor subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment that Quickturns MercuryPlusTM emulation system infringes Claims 1 and 5 of U.S. Patent No. 5,574,388. Mentors summary judgment motion will be heard on March 22, 2002. Quickturn and Cadence believe the Court will ultimately conclude that no such infringement exists.\n\nOn November 2, 2000, Mentor and Meta filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Quickturn and Cadence in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (Case No. C-00-1489) seeking a ruling that Mentors proposed design verification approach (in which IC designers would use U.S.-based computer terminals to operate SimExpress emulation systems located overseas) will not infringe Quickturns patents and will not violate the permanent injunction entered by the Oregon District Court on July 7, 1999 in Civil Action No. C-96-00342. In January 2001, Quickturn and Cadence filed a Motion to Dismiss the action, based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On May 1, 2001, the Court provisionally granted Quickturns motion to dismiss. Cadence and Quickturn believe that Mentors complaint is without merit.\n\nOn April 30, 1999, Cadence and several of its officers and directors were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Spett v. Cadence Design Systems, et al., civil action no. C 99-2082. The action was brought on behalf of a class of stockholders who purchased Cadence common stock between November 4, 1998 and April 20, 1999, and alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On September 18, 2000, the District Court granted Cadences Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs Claims with leave to amend. Plantiffs did not amend their complaint, and on November 29, 2001 an order was filed dismissing the claims with prejudice and granting judgment in favor of Cadence and the individual defendants.\n\nOn February 25, 2000, Cadence and several of its officers were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Maxick v. Cadence Design Systems, Inc., File No. C 00-0658PJH. The action was brought on behalf of a class of shareholders of OrCAD, Inc., and alleges violations of Section 14(d)(7) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 14d-10 thereunder. The lawsuit arose out of Cadences acquisition of OrCAD, which was completed in August 1999. The parties have settled the matter for the payment of $1.25 million by Cadence. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nIn early 1999, Cadence entered into negotiations with Intelect Communications, Inc. (since renamed TeraForce Technology Corporation), and Intelects wholly-owned subsidiary, DNA Enterprises, Inc., with respect to a potential purchase of substantially all the assets of DNA. The transaction was not consummated and, in July 1999, Intelect and DNA filed suit against Cadence in a Texas state court alleging breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty, seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Cadence has answered, denying liability. In January 2002, the court denied Cadences Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and set a trial for March 2002.\n\nOn November 22, 2000, a former design services customer, Uniden Corporation, filed an action for fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract in the State Court of Texas against Cadence and other corporate defendants, seeking compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount. The suit was filed after Cadence demanded payment of approximately $1.0 million for design services rendered to Uniden. Cadence since has filed a counterclaim to recover the approximately $1.0 million owed for services rendered. The parties agreed to dismiss voluntarily the actions pending in the State Court of Texas and to re-file in the State Court of California, County of Orange. Uniden refiled its complaint on July 2, 2001 in Orange County, California. Cadence filed its answer and counterclaim on September 12, 2001.\n\nOn December 28, 2000, a former design services customer, Scanz Communications, Inc. and Scanz Communications, LLC (Scanz) filed an action for various causes of action in the Los Angeles Superior Court of California against Cadence and Tality Corporation and Tality, LP, seeking compensatory and\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\npunitive damages in an unspecified amount. The suit was filed after Cadence demanded payment of $4,657,556.17 for design services rendered to Scanz. Scanz filed a first amended complaint on April 2, 2001. Following demurrers by Cadence that were sustained in part, Scanz filed a second amended complaint on July 10, 2001 to which Cadence and Tality filed their answer on October 10, 2001. Scanzs remaining causes of action are fraud, breach of contract, intentional interference with contract, unfair business practices and negligent misrepresentation, for which Scanz seeks damages in the tens of millions of dollars.\n\nOn June 7, 2001, Cadence, Tality Corporation and Tality, LP filed a cross-complaint against Scanz alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment, and seeking declaratory relief. On July 12, 2001, Scanz filed an answer to Cadences cross-complaint denying all allegations. Trial in this matter is scheduled for September 23, 2002. Cadence intends to vigorously defend the claims alleged by Scanz.\n\nManagement believes that the ultimate resolution of the disputes and litigation matters discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on Cadences business, operating results or financial condition. However, were an unfavorable ruling to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations for such period.\n\nItem 4.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the five-year summary of selected financial data and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All references to years represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted. Except for the historical information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Cadences actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause actual results or performance to differ materially or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below in Results of Operations, Disclosures About Market Risk, and Liquidity and Capital Resources.\n\nOverview\n\nGeneral\n\nCadence provides comprehensive software and other technology and offers design and methodology services for the product development requirements of the worlds leading electronics companies. Cadence licenses its leading-edge EDA software and hardware technology and provides a range of services to its customers throughout the world to help them optimize their product development processes. Cadences products and services are used by companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits and electronic systems, including semiconductors, computer systems and peripherals, telecommunications and networking equipment, mobile and wireless devices, automotive electronics, consumer products and other advanced electronics\n\nIn late 2000, both the U.S. economy in general and the electronics industry in particular began to experience a slowdown, the severity of which increased during 2001. This economic slowdown adversely affected the electronics industry, and in particular, negatively affected Cadence sales of design services through Tality and sales of hardware emulation products. The electronics industry slowdown, especially in the semiconductor industry, could potentially reduce Cadences revenue and harm its results of operations throughout 2002.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nCadence has acquired numerous businesses and is likely to do so in the future. These acquisitions are described in more detail in In-Process Technology and in the notes to Cadences Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn December 2001, Cadence acquired Silicon Perspective®Corporation, or SPC, a privately-held design technology firm, for approximately 6.8 million shares of Cadence common stock, valued at $132.5 million. SPC provides electronic design tools that bridge the gap between front-end logic designers and the back-end physical design process. The purchase price could increase if certain predetermined performance goals are achieved in fiscal 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn February 2001, Cadence acquired CadMOS Design Technology, Inc., a privately-held design tools firm, for approximately 3.6 million shares of Cadence common stock, valued at $92.7 million. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. CadMOS provides solutions to the noise problems experienced in ultra-deep submicron processes. The purchase price will increase up to an additional 488,970 shares if certain predetermined performance goals are achieved over the three years following the acquisition.\n\nTality Separation\n\nOn July 17, 2000, Cadence announced its plan to separate its electronics design services group into a new company named Tality Corporation. Tality filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for Talitys IPO. Talitys separation from Cadence was substantially completed on October 4, 2000, and the electronic design services business thereafter operated as a subsidiary of Cadence. As a result of the separation in the third quarter of 2000, Cadence recorded deferred stock compensation resulting from Tality option grants and sales of Tality restricted stock. On October 9, 2000, Cadence announced the\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\npostponement of Talitys IPO due to unfavorable market conditions. As a result of the postponement of the Tality IPO, Cadence wrote off $2.8 million of IPO-related expenses in the first quarter of 2001. In addition to the $2.8 million, Cadence also expensed $2.0 million of Tality separation costs in 2001, related primarily to information systems separation, legal and consulting fees. On April 17, 2001, Cadence announced the withdrawal of the Tality IPO registration statement. Tality was reorganized and restructured during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2001, and is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cadence. See Unusual Items  Tality IPO-Related Expense and Separation Costs.\n\nRestructurings and Assets Impairments\n\nIn 2001, Cadence announced a worldwide restructuring plan targeted at reducing workforce and consolidating facilities and assets. The restructuring plan was initiated primarily due to the severe downturn in the economic environment in the electronics industry, particularly in the United States. The restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing excess personnel and capacity costs within its Tality subsidiary, dedicating Cadences resources to growth areas, and focusing on profit contribution. Cadence recorded $61.6 million of restructuring charges associated with the worldwide restructuring plan. Cadences restructuring plan and associated costs consisted of $20.8 million for reduction in personnel, $22.7 million to downsize and close excess facilities and $16.6 million of asset impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. Management estimates that the restructuring will result in annualized cost reductions of approximately $70.4 million in employee salary and benefit costs and $47.6 million in facility costs.\n\nThe restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of 705 employees, which were predominately Tality employees. While employee reductions are across all business functions, operating units and geographic regions, Cadences wireless communications-related areas within Tality were affected more than other areas. In addition, the number of temporary and contract workers employed by Cadence has been reduced.\n\nIn February 2002, Cadence announced a further restructuring of its Tality business to increase its focus on communications IC design and intellectual property used in wireline communications equipment and to no longer provides board-level, mechanical and packaging services for data and telecommunications equipment. As a result, Tality will reduce its headcount by approximately 200 people. The reductions will result in the closure of its Ottawa, Canada; Lowell, Massachusetts; and Noida, India design centers. A restructuring charge of approximately $25.0 million will be taken in the first quarter of 2002 for severance, facility closure and related asset impairments.\n\nAvant! Restitution Award\n\nOn July 25, 2001, Avant! Corporation was ordered to pay Cadence $194.6 million in criminal restitution after Avant! entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the Superior Court of the State of California of conspiracy to take and use Cadences trade secrets. This conspiracy included the theft by Avant! and certain individuals of Cadence intellectual property, including software code, as well as other trade secrets. As of December 29, 2001, approximately $196.0 million, consisting of all of the restitution award plus interest was received. This amount is recorded in restructuring, asset impairment and unusual items in Cadences Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nCadences critical accounting policies are as follows:\n\n revenue recognition for its various business units;  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities;  accounting for income taxes; and  valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill.\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRevenue recognition.\n\nCadence derives revenue from three sources: (i) product revenue, which includes software licensing and hardware sales, (ii) maintenance revenue from software and hardware and (iii) services revenue. As described below, significant management judgments and estimates are made and used to determine the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of Cadences revenue for any period if different conditions were to prevail, such as a different mix of license types or a different payment history, each as described below.\n\nCadence applies the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by Statement of Position 98-9 Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products and sales of hardware where the software is not incidental.\n\nCadence recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in the arrangement. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is defined as the value of each element of an arrangement if sold separately and is established when a software vendor demonstrates a history of having sold the element separately and of collecting on that element from a representative sample of arrangements on a consistent basis. If vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier.\n\nCadence sells software using three license types. These license types are:\n\n Term licenses  software licensed for a specific time period, generally two to three years, with no rights to return or exchange the licensed software;  Subscription licenses  software licensed for a specific time period, generally two to three years, with no rights to return and limited rights to exchange the licensed software for unspecified future technology; and  Perpetual licenses  software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software.\n\nFor term and subscription licenses, Cadence uses a signed contract as evidence of an arrangement. For perpetual licenses, hardware sales and maintenance renewals, Cadence uses a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. Sales through its Japanese distributor are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction-by-transaction basis. For services, Cadence uses a signed statement of work to evidence an arrangement.\n\nSoftware is delivered to customers electronically or on a CD-ROM. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon installation.\n\nCadence assesses whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. Cadence uses installment contracts for term and subscription licenses for which it has established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments, products or services. The time periods of installment contracts are equal to or less than the time period of the licenses and are generally collected quarterly. If different conditions were to prevail and Cadence no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on term licenses, then revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized ratably over the term of the licenses. This change would have a material impact on Cadences reported results. For example, approximately 50% of Cadences software license revenues were derived from term licenses in 2001.\n\nCadence assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including the customers past payment history and its current credit-worthiness. If Cadence determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nassured, Cadence defers the revenue and recognizes it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment.\n\nProvided all the related conditions discussed above are met, Cadence recognizes revenue for each software license type as follows:\n\n Term licenses and Perpetual licenses  revenue associated with licensed software is recognized upon the effective date of the license; and  Subscription licenses  revenue associated with licensed software is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the effective date of the license.\n\nMaintenance revenue consists of fees for providing technical support and software updates. Cadence recognizes all maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term regardless of the software license agreement type. For term and perpetual licenses, customers renew maintenance agreements annually.\n\nServices revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing methodology and design services. Fixed-price methodology and design service contracts are accounted for using contract accounting, which is generally the percentage-of-completion method rather than the completed-contract method, and time and materials contracts are accounted for on a monthly basis as work is performed. In addition, for small fixed-price-projects, such as training classes and small, standard methodology service engagements of approximately $10,000 in size or less, revenue is recognized when the work is completed. Cadence has a history of accurately estimating project status and the cost to complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail where accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. This change would have a material impact on Cadences reported results\n\nEstimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.\n\nManagement specifically analyzes accounts receivable and also analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, changes in customer demand and sales returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and or expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.\n\nCadence has effected restructurings of its business units in the past and has established reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost (as required by accounting standards) against outstanding commitments for leased properties that it has vacated. These reserves are based upon managements estimate of the landlords willingness to negotiate a termination fee, the time require to sublet the properties and the amount of sublet income that might be generated between the date the property was vacated and expiration of the lease for each of the vacated properties. These estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly and may result in a substantial increase to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates.\n\nCadence assesses the need for reserves on inventory based on forward projections of sales of hardware products that are updated monthly. As a result of these projections, all inventory value in excess of 12 months sales projections (except for inventory expected to be used in ongoing service and maintenance of the installed base of customer owned systems) is reserved. Once inventory is reserved, the reserve can only be relieved by the subsequent sale or scrapping of the inventory.\n\n25\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAccounting for income taxes.\n\nIn preparing its consolidated financial statements, Cadence is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves estimating actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheet. Cadence then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely, Cadence must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent Cadence establishes a valuation allowance for provision or increases this allowance in a period, Cadence includes an expense within the tax provision in its Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Cadence recorded a valuation allowance for 2001 due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits, before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which Cadence operates and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or Cadence adjust these estimates in future periods, Cadence may need to establish an additional valuation allowance, which could materially impact financial position and results of operations.\n\nValuation of intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nCadence periodically reviews long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to these assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and For Long-lived Assets to be Disposed Of.\n\nFor assets to be held and used, including acquired intangibles, Cadence initiates its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows (without interest charges) that the asset is expected to generate. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail, material write downs of net intangible assets and/or goodwill could occur.\n\nIt is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future gross revenue, the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies, or both, could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these costs and result in a write-down of the carrying amount or a shortened life of acquired intangibles in the future.\n\nIn 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets became effective and as a result, Cadence will cease to amo"
