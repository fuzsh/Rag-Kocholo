        "text": "Well-Known Executive Tapped to Drive EVE Sales to New Level\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., and PALAISEAU, France — (BUSINESS WIRE) — January 11, 2010 — EVE today named well-known sales executive Ron Burns to the position of vice president of sales, based in EVE-USA’s San Jose, Calif., headquarters, and reporting to Dr. Luc Burgun, its chief executive officer (CEO) and president.\n\nBurns brings to EVE a distinguished career with more than a 20-year proven record of success in executive management, sales and marketing. Most recently, Burns served as general manager of Wipro Technologies’ Semiconductor and System Solutions Business Unit. Prior to Wipro, he served as vice president of worldwide sales at Teja Technologies, which was acquired by ARC in 2007.\n\n“Ron possesses a blend of experiences that make him unique in the industry,” notes Dr. Burgun. “His solid management skills and proven understanding of the sales process, particularly in the field of hardware-assisted verification tools, makes him ideally suited to lead our experienced and talented team. We welcome Ron and look to his leadership to move us into the next level of success.”\n\nBurns’ past engagements include vice president of marketing at Axis, sales and vice president of marketing at InTime Software and worldwide sales vice president at Forte Design systems. Additionally, he had a long tenure at Quickturn Design Systems, at that time it was the leader in emulation, as area sales director. Burns holds a MBA from Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif., and a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of South Florida in Tampa, Fla.\n\n“Joining EVE at this time is exciting,” comments Burns. “Since my tenure at Quickturn nearly a decade ago, we’ve continued to see design complexity increase exponentially, and in parallel, the nature of design has become highly collaborative through distributed, often global, design centers.”\n\nBurns continues: “EVE’s ZeBu-Server, with modular capacity up to one-billion gates and ability to serve up to 25 concurrent users, is just one of the technologies where EVE is uniquely positioned to help companies accelerate their time to profit. It’s clearly an interesting and challenging set of opportunities ahead for the industry. I look forward to joining the EVE leadership team as we partner with our clients to win together.”\n\nAbout EVE\n\nEVE is the worldwide leader in hardware/software co-verification solutions, including hardware description language (HDL) acceleration and extremely fast emulation, with installations at nine of the top 10 semiconductor companies.
