(USA) Inventor\n\nKumar, Vinod\n\nLenka, Prakash Kumar\n\nShakrani, Harsh Anil\n\nAbstract\n\nEmbodiments included herein are directed towards a voltage-temperature drift resistant and power efficient clock distribution circuit. Embodiments may include a current generator and a voltage generator configured to receive an input from the current generator. Embodiments may also include a regulator which may be configured to receive a reference voltage from the voltage generator as an input and to generate regulated voltage as output. The clock distribution path may operate on a regulated voltage, the regulated voltage having a value proportional to a threshold value associated with a plurality of devices included in the clock distribution path.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nG11C 11/4076 - Timing circuits\n\nG06F 1/10 - Distribution of clock signals\n\nG11C 11/409 - Read-write [R-W] circuits\n\nH03K 3/011 - Modifications of generator to compensate for variations in physical values, e.g. voltage, temperature\n\nH03K 3/012 - Modifications of generator to improve response time or to decrease power consumption\n\n2.\n\nMethod, product, and system for protocol state graph neural network exploration\n\nApplication Number 17490426 Grant Number 12038477 Status In Force Filing Date 2021-09-30 First Publication Date 2024-07-16 Grant Date 2024-07-16 Owner Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

In particular, the approach uses machine learning models to identify different states and ways to transition from one state to another. Actions are selected by machine learning models as they are being trained using reinforcement learning. This online inference also is likely to result in the discovery of not yet discovered states. Each state that has been identified is then used as a target to train a respective machine learning model. As part of this process a representation of all the states and actions or sequences of actions executed to reach those states is created.

The feedback loop includes a receiver to sample a signal and produce a sampled signal sequence. The feedback loop also includes a first pattern counter to detect and count occurrences of a first pattern in the sampled signal sequence, and a second pattern counter to detect and count occurrences of a second pattern in the sampled signal sequence. Control circuitry coupled to the receiver adapts a parameter value of the receiver to minimize a difference between a first ratio and a second ratio. The first ratio is a target ratio. The second ratio is between a first counted number of occurrences of the first pattern in the sampled signal sequence and a second counted number of occurrences of the second pattern in the sample signal sequence.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nH04B 1/16 - Circuits\n\n79.\n\nMethod, product, and system for automated, guided, and region-based layer density balancing\n\nApplication Number 17219675 Grant Number 11687694 Status In Force Filing Date 2021-03-31 First Publication Date 2023-06-27 Grant Date 2023-06-27 Owner Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

The approach disclosed herein operates on a region-by-region and layer-by-layer basis to perform parameterized layer balancing. In some embodiments, the process comprises determining densities of respective layers in respective regions, evaluating each layer and region to determine whether operations need to be taken to balance those layers in the corresponding regions, determining what those actions should be, and then implementing those actions. Additionally, in some embodiments, the process may operate in different orders and may be associated with a looping flow until a layout being processed has been balanced.\n\nIPC Classes ?\n\nG06F 30/392 - Floor-planning or layout, e.g. partitioning or placement\n\nG06F 30/398 - Design verification or optimisation, e.g. using design rule check [DRC], layout versus schematics [LVS] or finite element methods [FEM]\n\n80.\n\nMethod, product, and apparatus for a multidimensional processing array for hardware acceleration of convolutional neural network inference\n\nApplication Number 16946674 Grant Number 11687831 Status In Force Filing Date 2020-06-30 First Publication Date 2023-06-27 Grant Date 2023-06-27 Owner Cadence Design Systems, Inc.
