Our PCB CAE tool, Cadence Allegro, provides us with requisite capability in both the design and validation efforts, even providing “Cat’s Eye” signal integrity analysis required High speed Gigahertz backplane fabrics, such as VPX and OpenVPX, VITA 46 and 65, and Cpci Serial respectively. Our design team is well versed in all aspects of signal integrity. Our validation covers signal speed, crosstalk, and jitter simulation, and EMI/RFI mitigation. NIS through the use of their parent company Electronic Integration Technology Inc. (EIT) offer component programming; quick turn prototype development; flying probe or in-circuit testing (ICT) and X-ray for effective defect analysis; conformal coating; depot repair; execution of customers’ acceptance test plan (ATP) and environmental stress screening (ESS).\n\nExamples of Backplanes Developed"
