        "text": "Quickturn Design Systems has unveiled the Mercury design verification system at the 35th Design Automation Conference (DAC). This electronic design automation (EDA) tool incorporates Quickturn's fifth generation field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based emulation technology and a new mode of operation that delivers event-driven simulation performance.\n\nMercury includes a host of features and capabilities including the SimServer embedded, mixed-level simulation engine; a scaleable IMPX inherent multiplexed partial crossbar architecture; a Full Vision debug environment; and a three-level memory solution. The emulation system's embedded processor accepts designs at any level of abstraction. This enables verification in one continuous environment.\n\nMercury is a configurable computing technology application. It can map an algorithm directly into hardware by arranging logic, memories, and connections in parallel, problem-specific configurations. According to Quickturn, this eliminates the memory bottlenecks and instruction processing overhead of conventional computing.\n\nMercury is shipping in limited quantities and is offered in two chassis options. The Mercury SE series scales from 500,000 to 2 million gates in increments of 500,000 gates. The Mercury E series scales from 1 to 10 million gates in 1 million gate increments. The price for an entry-level Mercury system is $395,000."
