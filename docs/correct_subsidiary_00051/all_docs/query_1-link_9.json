        "text": "Quickturn Design Systems, Inc. (San Jose, CA) and Advanced RISC Machines (Cambridge, United Kingdom) jointly announced a strategic technology and marketing partnership. The companies hope that the partnership enables ease of design verification of Advanced RISC Machines' (ARM) array of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) cores and peripheral blocks with the user's design in Quickturn's emulation and cycle-based simulation products.\n\nAs part of the agreement, ARM has become an intellectual property (IP) partner in Quickturn's Affinity Partnership Program.\n\nThe goal of this relationship is to provide verifiable IP in the form of ARM's central processing unit (CPU) cores and peripheral blocks for use with verification products. The offering will include CPU cores and multimedia peripherals.\n\nThe ARM architecture is suited for implementing designs in the multimedia and portable market segments. Examples of designs in these segments include digital cameras, game machines, digital TVs, TV set-top boxes and intelligent terminals, as well as handheld PCs, PDAs, pagers, cellular phones and the emerging smart phone products.\n\nQuickturn is working with Affinity IP Partners to enable designers to emulate and simulate IP blocks easily with proper internal visibility and debug flexibility. Quickturn is a member of the Virtual Socket Interface Alliance (VSIA) whose goal is to provide an open standard for portable IP."
