        "text": "Advisor\n\nKeith’s career includes twenty-two years in the Semiconductor industry. He helped build and run three landmark startups, LSI Logic (now part of Broadcom), Chips & Technologies (now part of Intel), and Quickturn Design Systems (now part of Cadence. He was directly involved in two IPOs with Morgan Stanley, and has completed five successful M&A transactions on both the buy side and sell side during his Semiconductor career. Following this he spent over ten years in early stage venture capital, most of that with Fremont Group – San Francisco where he was a General Partner in their technology VC fund. Keith has served on over two dozen boards, and been a Trustee of the $2.9B Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation in Madison WI, where he also helped establish a technology accelerator/incubator at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. He has been an invited speaker at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and at the Harvard Business School where Quickturn Design Systems is a case study. His companies have twice won the annual Instat Kachina Award for best financially managed company in the Semiconductor Industry. The most fun thing he has ever done was a tour at sea observing flight operations for F-18A Super Hornet jets on board the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, “somewhere” in the Pacific Ocean. Keith earned an ME degree in Electrical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology – NJ, and an MBA in Finance/International Business from the University of Wisconsin – Madison."
