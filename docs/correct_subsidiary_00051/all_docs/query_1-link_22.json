He established DCD with his colleagues in 1999 - they all studied at The Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland. When he graduated in 1999, he got some interesting job posts from big companies from USA, Japan and Western Europe. But he figured out, why not open my own? That it was 1999, so the IP Core market was pretty young, he was pretty young, too – so it must have been good. That was DCD’s origins, we’re celebrating 20 years anniversary this year, being the same one of the first companies that built the IP Core market.\n\nJacek Hanke is not only the CEO, but also one of the company’s leading engineers, with more than 20 years market experience. He mastered dozens of different architectures which have been utilized by institutions like e.g. Swansea University, John’s Hopkins University, Sony, Bombardier, Caterpillar, Siemens, GE, Motorola etc. Jacek Hanke was also a Project Leader in several other projects which lead to design:\n\n+ World’s Fastest 8051 IP Core (the DQ80251 is more than 75 times faster than the original invented by Intel)\n\n+ deeply embbeded and fully scalable 32-bit CPU, named the D32PRO\n\n+ 100% safe crypto CPU, the CryptOne.\n\nJacek Hanke has been awarded with the various awards like e.g. Microentrepreneur of the Year by Citi Bank & Kronenberg Foundation or National Champion by European Business Awards etc. « Less\n\nJacek Hanke\n\nJacek Hanke is the CEO in Digital Core Design.

The same goes with CPUs and other electronics. We use some specific ASICs or FPGAs for years, cause they just are there. And what to do if they become obsolete and manufacturer decided not to offer them anymore?\n\nDCD’s got an answer. Use 1:1 replacement for EOL, which is 100% compatible with an original chip. Both FPGAs and ASICs offer great variety of solutions which can be efficiently and effortlessly utilized in the final design. Here’s a FAQ to help you move forward.\n\nJacek Hanke, DCD’s CEO says that the experience his company gained during last 20 years is priceless. – Among 70 different architectures one can easily find obsolete and hard to find discontinued electronic components – he says. Basing on hitherto experience, we can say that:\n\n1:1 replacement for most popular architectures that are no longer available is not an issue\n\nHaving it provided as HDL Source code, will make it valid, never obsolete and ready to use with any future technology,\n\nindustrial IP Cores might be used either as a replacement for an original architecture or as a main CPU in embedded 8/16/32-bit applications,\n\nin these obsolete parts a wide set of peripherals can be utilized to enhance functionality\n\nRead the rest of What the FAQ with obsolete & EOL parts?\n\nPosted in IP Core Market | 1 Comment »\n\nEnabling 400G Networking with 56G Ethernet PHY IP\n\nMay 6th, 2019 by Sanjay Gangal\n\nSanjay Gangal interviewed Rita Horner, Senior Technical Marketing Manager of Synopsys at EDACafe headquarteers.\n\nSG: You attended the IP-SOC conference here yesterday, and you did a presentation there.\n\nRH : Yes, we had a very interesting day yesterday at IP-SOC.\n\nSG: Tell us what was your presentation was about.\n\nRH : I presented on the 400G adoption, and the new networking data centers enabled by the 56G PHY.

And so it was in the first week of November in San Francisco when 175,000 people came to town to be part of the company’s DreamForce confab.\n\nI made the mistake of being on the Streets of San Francisco on Tuesday, November 7th, and was witness to the madding DreamForce crowds – particularly the lucky 50,000+ of them headed to AT&T Park where Alicia Keyes and Lenny Kravitz were waiting to entertain the VIPs of the SalesForce world.\n\nAlthough the traffic was debilitating on that Tuesday night, the sheer scale of the SalesForce presence (now very obvious in San Francisco as their towering mega-temple is about debut) provided such an interesting compare and contrast to my adventures on the following morning.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 8th, I had the good fortune to attend a Press and Analyst briefing at a low-slung building in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe hosts of that event were the leadership and evangelists of a small, laser-focused group called Silicon Catalyst – an incubator that intends to pave the way for the semiconductor super stars of the future. The folks at Silicon Catalyst hope that one of the companies in their carefully vetted portfolio may become the SalesForce of tomorrow, the mega-force in technology that dominates cities, skylines, and baseball parks.\n\nRead the rest of Silicon Catalyst: Leading the Renaissance in Hardware\n\nTags: ACP Semiconductor, Active Layer Parametrics, AEPONYX, Alex Wright-Gladstein, Ayar Labs, Chaos Prime, ClopTech, GMK, Mamoon Rashid, Nick Kepler, On Semiconductor, One Silicon Chip Photonics, Power Down Semiconductor, ProbiusDX, Raul Camposano, REX Computing, Rich Goldman, Rick Lazansky, SalesForce, Silicon Catalyst, Spark Microsystems, TI, Xceler Systems, Zeno Semiconductor\n\nPosted in Uncategorized | No Comments »\n\nMethodics: Integrated IP/Lifecycle Management Tools for the Enterprise\n\nDecember 21st, 2017 by Peggy Aycinena\n\nSan Francisco-based Methodics has been addressing both the enterprise data management and IP reuse/lifecycle management markets for over 10 years.\n\nThe company’s strategy of integrating their lifecycle management tools with products like Perforce version control software and Subversion from Apache, means they dovetail with industry standard solutions. As a natural outgrowth from that, Methodics’ IP-related offerings also work at the enterprise level, helping the customer’s distributed team coordinate and catalog IP use, and keeping track of third-party IP use as well.\n\nIn my recent phone call with Methodics CEO Simon Butler, it was clear the company is seeing the fruits of their many years of hard labor come to fruition.\n\nRead the rest of Methodics: Integrated IP/Lifecycle Management Tools for the Enterprise\n\nTags: Apache, Cadence, DAC, ESD Alliance, Mentor Graphics, Methodics, Perforce, Simon Butler\n\nPosted in Uncategorized | No Comments »\n\nHappy Talk: CEOs, Celebrity, Seasoning\n\nDecember 14th, 2017 by Peggy Aycinena\n\nIt’s an honor and a pain to interview a CEO, particularly the CEO of a publicly traded company.\n\nAn honor, because the CEO’s organization has decided your track record as a journalist warrants a few minutes of time with the company’s leadership. A pain, because the more highly paid the CEO, the larger the organization, the bigger the market cap, the less unvarnished the truth you’ll hear during the interview.\n\nIt’s guaranteed, while interviewing a high-flying CEO, that you’ll hear that everything is great with the company. The customers love the company’s products, can’t live without them, and assist and insist on helping the company produce its next release.\n\nRead the rest of Happy Talk: CEOs, Celebrity, Seasoning\n\nTags: Davos, Google Camp\n\nPosted in Uncategorized | No Comments »\n\nREUSE 2017: Opportunity knocks, Who’s answering\n\nDecember 7th, 2017 by Peggy Aycinena\n\nThis week on Thursday, December 14th, the second annual edition of REUSE 2017 will unfold in Silicon Valley. It’s a gathering crafted specifically for the vendors of IP blocks, and now whole sub-systems, those pieces of the puzzle which allow the vendors’ customers to design and produce electronic products more efficiently and with better results.\n\nIt goes without saying that IP is a pivotal part of the semiconductor supply chain today. Organizations like Arm and Synopsys reap huge benefits from being among the principal suppliers of that IP. But there are hundreds of IP companies in the world – big, medium, and small – that also provide IP.\n\nPotentially, they could all be participating in something like Reuse 2017. Arm, for instance, is participating in the conference, along with dozens of smaller companies. Synopsys, however, is not.\n\nRead the rest of REUSE 2017: Opportunity knocks, Who’s answering\n\nTags: Achronix, Aldec, Andes Technology, Aphion, Archband, ARM, Avery Design Systems, CAST, Certus Semiconductor, ChipEstimate.com, City Semiconductor, Corigine, DAC, eFabless, FlexLogix, Intel, Intrinsic ID, IP-SoC, Menta, Mixel, Mobile Semiconductor, Mobiveil, Moortec, NSCore, NVM Engines, OmniDesign, Open-Silicon, QuickLogic, Reuse 2017, RISC-V, Samsung, Semi IP Systems, SiFive, Silicon Creations, Silvaco, Sintegra, SmartFlow, Sofics, Sonics, Surecore, Synopsys, True Circuits, Uniquify\n\nPosted in Uncategorized | No Comments »\n\nSonics: Leading the industry by example\n\nNovember 30th, 2017 by Peggy Aycinena\n\nSan Jose-based Sonics is a long-established IP vendor specializing in On-chip Networks [NoC] and Energy Processing Units [EPU]. Co-founded by CEO Grant Pierce and CTO Drew Wingard, the company has 150 parents and has “supported customer products that have shipped more than 4 billion SoCs.”\n\nCurrently Grant Pierce is an exceptionally busy man. Not only is he leading Sonics, he’s also serving as Chair of the ESD Alliance. It’s a fortunate circumstance to have Pierce leading the Alliance; his point of view is exactly what’s needed to help shape what was originally an EDA-focused organization into something that embraces the full set of constituencies driving electronic system design today. Pierce is strongly committed to new technologies and the small companies that drive the innovation.\n\nPierce and I spoke by phone in late November. He is clearly very enthused about the company and the ESD Alliance.\n\nRead the rest of Sonics: Leading the industry by example\n\nTags: Aart de Geus, ARM, Design Automation Conference, Drew Wingard, EPU, Gary Smith, Grant Pierce, IoT, Joe Costello, MIPS, Moortec, NoC, Reuse 2017, Robin Saxby, SoftBank, Sonics, Tallwood\n\nPosted in Uncategorized | No Comments »\n\nIP-SoC 2017 – Headliners include de Geus, Saxby\n\nNovember 16th, 2017 by Peggy Aycinena\n\nDr. Gabriel Saucier has a lot to be proud of. The Grenoble-based organization she founded, Design and Reuse, is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its flagship conference: IP-SoC.\n\nTo celebrate, IP-SoC 2017 is showcasing two of the biggest names in the IP industry – Synopsys CEO Dr. Aart de Geus and ARM founder Sir Robin Saxby. That’s pretty news worthy and a distinct reflection of the significant role Design and Reuse has played for more than two decades in promoting the wide-spread development and reuse of semiconductor IP.\n\nOf course, it’s also worth noting that de Geus and Saxby will not be the only speakers with deep expertise in the technology.\n\nRead the rest of IP-SoC 2017 – Headliners include de Geus, Saxby\n\nTags: Aart de Geus, ARM Holdings, Design-and-Reuse, Gabriel Saucier, Grenoble, IP SoC 2017, RISC-V, Robin Saxby, Synopsys\n\nPosted in Uncategorized | No Comments »\n\nArm Momentum: Segars embraces exciting times\n\nNovember 9th, 2017 by Peggy Aycinena\n\nSimon Segars has been CEO of UK-based ARM Holdings since 2013. When he first joined the company in 1991, he was employee No. 16, and was there when the company went public in 1998.\n\nLast year, Japan-based SoftBank purchased ARM for $32 billion, just a few days after the Brexit vote, and took the company private. This year, SoftBank sold 25-percent of ARM to Saudi Arabia, in a deal that was part of the company’s (and kingdom’s) Vision Fund juggernaut.\n\nSimon Segars has more than survived all of this change. He is still CEO of the most ubiquitous IP provider in the world, and now also has a seat on the Board of Directors of SoftBank.\n\nAs I prepared for my phone call with Segars last week, I was pretty sure he would decline to answer the bulk of the questions on my list. Surprisingly, however, he answered all of them, with ease and on the record. We started with the most astonishing news of all: ARM has changed its name.\n\nRead the rest of Arm Momentum: Segars embraces exciting times\n\nTags: Advanced RISC Machines, ARM Holdings, ARM TechCon, Bob Gardner, EDA Consortium, ESD Alliance, Masayoshi Son, RISC-V, Saudi Arabia, Simon Segars, SoftBank, SoftBank Vision Fund\n\nPosted in Uncategorized | No Comments »\n\nUltraSoC: Sangiovanni-Vincentelli now leads Board\n\nNovember 2nd, 2017 by Peggy Aycinena\n\nU.C. Berkeley Prof. Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli has just been named non-Executive Chairman of UltraSoC, an IP provider based in Cambridge. He was in Rome when we spoke this week by phone about the news.\n\nUltraSoC CEO Rupert Baines was also on the conference call, dialing in from the UK, while I was in Silicon Valley. The conversation began with a discussion of Sangiovanni-Vincentelli’s ongoing research work in Singapore.\n\nThree sentences, four geographies: What more proof is needed that the semiconductor industry is indeed global?\n\nRead the rest of UltraSoC: Sangiovanni-Vincentelli now leads Board\n\nTags: Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Atlante Ventures, Cadence, CEVA, Coadasip, Elvees, HiSilicon/Huaweei, Imagination, ISO 26262, Lauterrbach, MIT, Movidius, Netspeed, NRF CREATE, RISC-V, Rupert Baines, SiFive, Singapore, Sondrel, Synopsys, Technical University of Munich, U.C.
