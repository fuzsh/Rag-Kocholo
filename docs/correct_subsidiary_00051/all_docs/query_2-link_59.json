        "text": "EDA’s acquisition era arrived close on the heels of the EDA era. SDA merged with ECAD to form Cadence in 1987, and the new company’s first acquisition was in 1989. The company has made nearly 40 acquisitions to date. Synopsys incorporated in 1986, and its first acquisition was in 1990. The company has made more than 100 acquisitions to date. Mentor Graphics metamorphosed from a dying CAE company into a vibrant EDA company around 1993, and its first post-metamorphosis acquisition was in 1997. The company made at least 15 acquisitions before being acquired itself in 2017 by Siemens. All three of these leading EDA companies entered the acquisition derby in an attempt to outgrow the other two competitors in the EDA arena – growth being measured in total revenue.\n\nThe acquisitiveness of these three big EDA companies manifested a microcosmic EDA industry that produced little EDA startups designed for the chief purpose of being acquired. The late Jim Hogan started his EDA journey at Cadence more than 30 years ago. He was both a consultant whose advice was widely sought by the EDA community and a developer of EDA startups, groomed to be acquired by one of the big three EDA companies, first through Cadence’s Telos Venture Partners and later through his own Vista Ventures, founded with his friend Scott Becker. Hogan would find some bright, entrepreneurial engineers with an idea, fund or get funding for them, and then harvest his investment sometime later by finding a buyer for the company. I had the privilege of being one of Jim Hogan’s many friends. Hogan passed away in 2021.\n\nBelow is a list of the acquisitions made by the big three EDA companies, listed by date, by the acquired company’s name, and by the purchased technology. These lists are not exhaustive, but show the diversity of the tools and technologies offered by these EDA startup companies.

that specializes in fluid-dynamics, combustion, and multi-physics simulation tools for a much broader list of industries than just EDA. For EDA applications, Ansys offers RedHawk-SC, a power integrity tool that’s popular with IC designers. Ansys added RedHawk to its software portfolio when it acquired Apache Design Solutions in 2011.\n\nMentor Graphics Acquisitions\n\n2015 Calypto Design Systems – HLS tools\n\n2015 Tanner EDA – AMS and MEMS integrated circuits\n\n2014 Berkeley Design Automation – AMS circuit verification\n\n2014 Nimbic – Electromagnetic simulation software\n\n2010 CodeSourcery – GNU-based software development tools\n\n2010 Valor Computerized Systems – PCB systems manufacturing\n\n2009 LogicVision – Testing for IC manufacturing\n\n2008 Flomerics – CFD\n\n2007 Sierra Design Automation – Place and route (P&R) software\n\n2004 Project Technology – Executable UML\n\n2002 IKOS Systems – Hardware emulation\n\n2002 Innoveda – PCB and wire harness design\n\n2002 Accelerated Technology – RTOS and embedded software development\n\n1999 VeriBest – PCB design\n\n1995 Microtec Research – Real-time operating system (RTOS), software development\n\n1995 Exemplar Logic – Logic synthesis\n\n1994 Model Technology – VHDL simulation\n\n1994 Anacad Electrical Engineering Software – Analog and mixed-signal design\n\n1993 CheckLogic Systems – Automatic test pattern generation\n\n1990 Silicon Compiler Systems – Logic synthesis, IC design tools\n\n1990 Context Corp – Documentation systems\n\n1989 Descartes Automation Systems – Place and route tools\n\n1989 Performance CAD – Timing analysis\n\n1989 Trimeter Technologies’ assets – Logic synthesis\n\n1988 Tektronix CAE and CASE Divisions\n\n1988 Contour Design Systems – Analog IP libraries\n\n1984 Synergy DataWorks – Hardware acceleration\n\n1983 California Design Automation – PCB design\n\nSome of the acquisition histories listed above intersect with my own career. I worked for several of the companies listed above including Cadence, Denali Software, and Tensilica. In addition, the VeriBest PCB design software acquired by Mentor Graphics in 1999 incorporates the remnants of the PCB tools that were originally developed by Cadnetix, where I worked as a design engineer from 1982 to 1985.\n\nIn compiling these acquisition lists, I was struck by the tremendous collective effort people have put into the EDA tools we use today. It gives one pause. For some of the acquisitions listed above, the engineers working for the acquired companies found new positions with one of the big three EDA companies. Other acquisitions were technology acquisitions, which means the people at the acquired company hit the streets to look for new employment. The above lists therefore paint an accurate picture of the roiling, dynamic nature of the EDA industry, akin to the popular novel and TV series “Game of Thrones,” but with slightly less bloodletting.\n\nReferences"
