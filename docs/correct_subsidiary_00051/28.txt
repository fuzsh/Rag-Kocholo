BRACKNELL, United Kingdom--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 18, 2001-- Quickturn, a Cadence company (NYSE:CDN - news), announced today that ARM (LSE:ARM)(Nasdaq:ARMHY), the industry's leading provider of 16/32-bit embedded RISC processor solutions, has selected the Quickturn MercuryPlus(TM) verification system to verify the ARM926EJ-S(TM) core.

ARM chose the market-leading MercuryPlus system to ensure its design team had the necessary emulation tool to thoroughly -- and quickly -- verify the new core's complex design.

``We selected the Quickturn system after careful evaluation,'' said Simon Segars, vice president of Engineering at ARM. ``With MercuryPlus, we can boot real-time operating systems and applications on our industry-leading processors, which allows us to perform more in-depth verification earlier in the design cycle. The unique 512MB memory card on the MercuryPlus was also very useful, as it allowed us to easily verify designs incorporating large amounts of memory.''

Gary Wilkins, vice president of Quickturn Europe, said, ``ARM continues to deliver industry-leading RISC microprocessor solutions, so it's only fitting the company chose Quickturn's industry-leading technology to verify the ARM926EJ-S core. ARM clearly understands the return on investment companies enjoy by getting their high-quality products to market quickly.''

The ARM926EJ-S core will be integrated into a wide variety of Java-technology enabled-devices, such as web-enabled PDAs, smart phones, set-top boxes, and in-car information solutions.

About MercuryPlus

The MercuryPlus in-circuit emulator is designed to deliver the verification capabilities most important to today's design teams: fast design compilation, high debugging productivity, and high capacity. The centerpiece of the MercuryPlus emulation system is a new technology based on custom field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) optimized for emulation. Higher performance and capacity have resulted from a shift from standard FPGAs to a silicon architecture optimized for emulation. The new MercuryPlus architecture was designed to be highly scalable for increased capacity, to incorporate special on-board debugging logic, and to provide for much higher speed and predictable interconnection routing as compared with commercial FPGAs. These advantages combine to create a system that can enable a significantly faster turn-around time and increased designer productivity.
