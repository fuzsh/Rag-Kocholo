        "text": "ARK-4 e/CFW for the PSP and PS Vita.\n\nNew, updated, improved and modern Custom Firmware for the PSP and PS Vita's ePSP. Simple to use and full of unique features, ARK CFW aims at keeping the PSP experience fresh. Being a successor to PRO and ME, ARK is now the most feature-complete CFW for the PSP, having all features from classic CFW as well as unique and exclusive new features not found anywhere else.\n\nJoin the PSP Homebrew Community Discord\n\nWe are located in the #ark-cfw channel\n\nInstallation Guide located in WIKI\n\nARK-4 WIKI\n\nTable of Contents (Quick Links)\n\nFEATURES:\n\nInstallation on PSP\n\nInstallation on PS Vita\n\nChangelog\n\nWarnings\n\nCore system for unsigned code execution heavily updated from traditional CFW with robust patching algorithms and improved API.\n\nHeavily optimized Inferno 2 Driver compatible with all known PSP formats (ISO, CSO, ZSO, JSO, CSOv2 and DAX).\n\nPopcorn controller for custom PS1 games with support for external configuration files and anti-libcrypt protection.\n\nBuilt-in No-DRM engine Stargate, fixes many anti-CFW games. Expandible via other NoDRM plugins.\n\nPlugin support for PSP games and homebrew, PS1 games and VSH (XMB), including the ability to enable and disable plugins per-game.\n\nRegion Free playback of UMD Video on all PSP models. Change the region of your UMD drive on-the-fly.\n\nCompatible with all PSP models on firmwares 6.60 and 6.61.\n\nCompatible with all PS Vita models on firmware 2.10 up to 3.74 OFW or Henkaku, including support for the Adrenaline pspemu mod.\n\nCompatible with 6.60 Testing Tool and 6.60 Development Tool firmwares for testkit and devkit units (inlcuding CEX2DEX converted units).\n\nUpdated cIPL compatible with all PSP models, including toolkits, for truely permanent CFW.\n\nCan be fully installed and booted on memory stick via Time Machine.\n\nCan be used to unbrick any PSP model using Despertar del Cementerio Version 10 in combination with a Pandora Battery or Baryon Sweeper.\n\nResistant to bricks, easy to recover from bad configurations, various recovery methods including being able to load DC via cIPL without any special device.\n\nCustom game launcher with built-in game categories, file browser, FTP server and client, modernized look and more.\n\nBuilt-in extensions allow the CFW to be managed entirely via the XMB.\n\nCompatible with PRO Online and Xlink Kai.\n\nCompatible with Legacy Homebrew via eLoader and Leda, including with the classic KXploit format.\n\nOTA updates. Fully updateable via the internet.\n\nCompiling ARK ( For Developers )\n\nBuild script will allow you to use the correct SDK that ARK was built with.\n\nDocker container: docker pull docker.io/krazynez/ark-4:latest\n\nThese are utilized either with cloning the repo or using the Docker container\n\nRelease: ./build.sh\n\nDebug: ./build.sh --debug\n\nManually: install the oldest possible SDK (ideally the one used to compile M33), then run make\n\nUse -h or --help to show all available flags\n\nInstallation On PSP\n\nThe instructions are as follows:\n\nMove or copy ARK_01234 folder into /PSP/SAVEDATA/ folder.\n\nMove or copy ARK_Loader folder into /PSP/GAME/ folder.\n\nLaunch ARK Loader. It will install ARK modules on PSP Flash and boot the CFW.\n\nAt this point ARK will work as a Live CFW, meaning that ARK Loader will need to be run every time the console is turned off or rebooted.\n\nTo convert ARK into a Permanent CFW you can use either cIPL or Infinity, along with the Full Installer for a complete permanent experience.\n\nPermanent CFW via cIPL\n\nNew cIPL: works with every retail model (1K, 2K, 3K, Go and Street) on firmware 6.61.\n\nClassic cIPL: works with 1g and early 2g on firmware 6.60 or 6.61 as well as Testkits on 6.60 Testing Tool.\n\nDevTool cKBOOTI: works with DTP-T1000 (devkits) on 6.60 Development Tool.\n\nInstaller will choose the correct version according to your model.\n\nMove or copy ARK_cIPL folder to /PSP/GAME/ and run the program.\n\nPress the corresponding button in the installation page to install or remove the cIPL patch.\n\nWarning: unlike classic cIPL, the new cIPL method can't be easily uninstalled. To revert to offical IPL, use ChronoSwitch to reinstall 6.61 OFW.\n\nFull Flash Installation\n\nThis allows you to install and use all of ARK's features on the console's internal flash memory, allowing you to entirely remove the ARK_01234 savedata folder or memory stick.\n\nCopy ARK_Full_Installer to /PSP/GAME/ and run it from ARK. It will install some extra files into the console's flash.\n\nIf the Custom Launcher is not available (i.e. you delete the ARK savedata or remove the memory card), PRO Shell will take its place.\n\nWhen no savedata folder is available the default ARK path used to store settings will be ms0:/SEPLUGINS/.\n\nEven if files are stored in the console's flash memory, the ones in the savedata folder will still take priority in loading.\n\nTime Machine and Despertar del Cementerio\n\nTime Machine allows the ability to boot the 6.61 firmware and ARK entirely from the Memory Stick.\n\nDespertar del Cementerio allows the ability to revive a bricked PSP when used in combination with a Pandora or Baryon Sweeper.\n\nTo install DC-ARK you must first format the memory stick leaving enough space for the boot sector. You can use PSP Tool to do this.\n\nYou can install DC-ARK either using a PSP or a PC (Windows, Mac and Linux).\n\nOn PSP you need to be running a CFW to install DC-ARK (ARK itself or any other).\n\nCopy the ARK_DC folder to the /PSP/GAME/ folder and run the installer from the XMB.\n\nFollow the instructions to install DC-ARK and create a magic memory stick.\n\nOn PC, you need Python 3 and run MagicMemoryCreator with admin/root priviledges.\n\nOn compatible models, you can use Advanced VSH Menu to create a Pandora Battery.\n\nUse a Pandora or Baryon Sweeper in combination with your newly created Magic Memory Stick to boot up Despertar del Cementerio.\n\nFrom here you can either boot ARK from memory stick, install 6.61 Firmware with ARK on the Nand or install 6.61 Official Firmware\n\nInstallation On PS Vita\n\nStandalone (Official PSPEmu)\n\nWorks on Firmware 3.60 up to 3.74, requires Henkaku/h-encore or any native hack.\n\nDownload and install NoPspEmuDrm (you can use AutoPlugin).\n\nCopy FasterARK.vpk from PSVita/ folder anywhere on your vita and install using VitaShell.\n\nOpen FasterARK and wait for the install process to finish.\n\nBoth ARK and ARK-X bubbles will appear in Live Area.\n\nUse the ARK bubble for PSP games and homebrew. It can play PS1 but with limitations related to sound playback.\n\nUse the ARK-X bubble for PS1 games without any sound limitations.\n\nOnce ARK bubbles are installed, you can delete FasterARK.\n\nTo exit from a game or homebrew back to the custom launcher, press L+R+Down+Start (on ARK-X use L2+R2+Down+Start or L1+R1+Start+Down for VitaTV).\n\nNOTE: Some features are not available in standalone installations, mainly the official Sony XMB and Force Extra RAM setting (needed for PRO Online).\n\nNOTE: If you want to have an ARK bubble that works on Official Firmware you must use ChovySign with a valid license. Instructions in Wiki.\n\nAdrenaline (Patched PSPEmu)\n\nWorks on Firmware 3.60 up to 3.74, requires Henkaku/h-encore and Adrenaline (https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/Adrenaline).\n\n(Skip this step if Standalone is already installed) Install ARK_01234 folder into /PSP/SAVEDATA/ folder.\n\nInstall ARK_Loader folder into /PSP/GAME/ folder.\n\nUse Adrenaline Bubbles Manager to create an autoboot bubble for ARK Loader: https://github.com/ONElua/AdrenalineBubbleManager/releases\n\nNote: this does not permanently modify Adrenaline in any way.\n\nUpdating ARK\n\nThere are three ways to update ARK:\n\nOption 1: Use the System Update feature in the XMB. Requires your PSP/Vita to be connected to the internet.\n\nOption 2: Copy the UPDATE folder to /PSP/GAME/ and run it.\n\nOption 3: Copy ARK_01234 folder and (on PSP) run ARK Loader again to install new flash0 files.\n\nARK-1: original port/rewrite of PRO CFW for the PS Vita. Codenamed PROVITA. Source code can be found here: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-1-PROVita-\n\nARK-2: dynamic patching allows it to work with most of PS Vita firmwares. Source code can be found here: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-2\n\nARK-3: device-specific runtime allows ARK to run in multiple scenarios (ePSP and ePSX). Source code can be found here: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-3\n\nARK-4: ported to the original PSP. Huge amounts of improvements and fixes over previous versions.\n\nNote: this is a simplified changelog, for a full version you can visit here: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\n\nARK comes with no warranty whatsoever. It was designed to be noob-proof, however it is possible for the universe to create an even greater noob capable of using ARK to destroy the Earth (or his PSP). I cannot be held responsible for this.\n\nARK may cause ejectile malfunction if your hard drive is not hard enough.\n\nIf this software malfunctions, you can turn it off and on again."
