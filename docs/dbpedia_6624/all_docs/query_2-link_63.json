        "text": "Come to the sister site on Tactics Ogre: LUCT at luct.tacticsogre.com\n\nDecember 29th, 2023: Landon\n\nI was very pleased with my purchase of Japan's Tactics Ogre: Reborn Collector's Edition. It is an amazing package including the game, soundtrack, playmat, and other great items. It was a challenge preordering from Japan, including the long shipping time frame, but everything worked out well. I put over 200 hours of play time in Tactics Ogre: Reborn this year and loved every minute.\n\nApril 29th, 2023: Landon\n\nI have enjoyed playing Tactics Ogre: Reborn this year and just finished attacking Heim in the Chapter 4 Chaos route. There is a ton of content left to play as I have not started the Palace of the Dead or Hanging Gardens. Also, I recently got a Tactics Ogre poster from Japan framed for the gaming wall! I placed it next to my framed set of Tactics Ogre tarot card set, which was the preorder item for Playstation Portable's Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together.\n\nAugust 17, 2022: Landon\n\nThe North American Square Enix Store offers two special pre-order items for fans of Tactics Ogre: Reborn. Individuals may pre-order the Tactics Ogre: Reborn Tarot Card Set, originally part of the Japan-only Tactics Ogre: Reborn Collector's Edition. The Tarot Card Set is pre-ordering for $49,99 and includes 22 Major Arcana cards, a pouch with the Knights of Godscale emblem, and a rubber play mat featuring the map of the Valerian Isles.\n\nIn addition to the Tarot Card Set, individuals may pre-order The Art of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together Artbook with a planned release of May16, 2023. This $39.99 artbook pre-order appears to be a North American release of the Japanese Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together Wheels of Fate Artbook.\n\nAugust 4th, 2022: Landon\n\nTactics Ogre: Reborn finally received an official release announcement and trailer! The highly-anticipated strategy game remake is coming to PS4, PS5, Switch and PC (Steam) on November 11th, 2022. Significant updates were confirmed in the announcement including rerecorded music, enhanced AI, redesigned battle system, and much more.\n\nPre-ordering Tactics Ogre: Reborn Digital Deluxe copies for PS4. PS5, and PC include the game and its full soundtrack. Standard Digital Edition pre-order copies of Tactics Ogre: Reborn include a digital mini soundtrack featuring three songs from the game. There does not appear to be information available for pre-ordering Switch versions.\n\nJuly 27, 2022: Landon\n\nNew information was released for the upcoming Tactics Ogre: Reborn video game. Tactics Ogre: Reborn is a remastered version of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, previously released in North America for PlayStation and later as a remake for PlayStation Portable. An article on Polygon states that the planned release date for Tactics Ogre: Reborn is November 11th, 2022, for Sony's PlayStation Store.\n\nPlayers can expect multiple improvements from the previously released PSP remake including improved graphics, auto save, updated AI, quality-of-life features, and a new class system specific to each unit. Tactics Ogre: Reborn is shaping up to be an exciting release for fans of the Ogre Battle series and an approachable entry for newcomers. It is unclear if Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be available on other platforms, but there is a possibility for at least a PC release.\n\nJuly 3, 2022: Landon\n\nTactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis released on May 7th, 2002, and recently celebrated its 20th anniversary! Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis continues to be a beloved strategy game by many people. Surprisingly, used copies of Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis sell for around $100 each. I believe the increasing interest in retro gaming continues to introduce new and old players to Tactics Ogre games. Also, there are rumors of a new version of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together called Tactics Ogre: Reborn planned for an upcoming release. While information about the game is sparse, it could be a fully remastered version. I look forward to hearing more about Tactics Ogre: Reborn in the coming months.\n\nIn addition, it is hard to believe this website is 20 years old too. I have met and communicated with some amazing people over the past two decades through the old Proboards community and via email. It is nice to receive emails from longtime fans sharing their appreciation for keeping this website running and love for Tactics Ogre games. I hope fans of the Tactics Ogre series continue to find the information on this website informative and helpful.\n\nJanuary 9, 2020: Landon\n\nHappy New Year to you and your family. I have made a small update to the Characters page. Gustavo, a fan of this website, contributed tips for some of the recruitable characters. I liked his suggesions for Orson, Elrik, and Eleanor in particular. Thank you Gustavo for your contribution.\n\nMay 13, 2019: Landon\n\nHello everyone and I hope you are having a nice start to summer. I wanted to let you know that my old email address is gone. You can reach me by sending a message at this contact portal.\n\nMy blog and website at My Weekly Grind contains information about various restaurants and events around Charlotte, NC. I also write articles on the Magic: The Gathering card game related to finance, collecting, and deck strategy. Additionally, there is a section of the website dedicated to travel tips and information on Japan. If you ever have an interest in traveling to Japan now or in the future, I have a 10 day travel guide and plenty of tips for planning a trip. Thank you for visiting today.\n\nJuly 18, 2017: Landon\n\nI wanted to take a moment and thank everyone for their continued support visiting tacticsogre.com. It has been over 16 years since this site was created to support the games in the Tactics Ogre series. It pleases me to know fans have enjoyed visiting the site while playing TKOL and LUCT for so many years. I still have every intention to keep this site running as well as luct.tacticsogre.com. I also want to apologize for the downtime as the site was moved to a new server. Feel free to send me an email with questions, comments, or just to say hello.\n\nMarch 4, 2012: Landon\n\nHello everyone, I made a small update in the characters section by changing the images for Berevra. Bradberry451, a member of our forums, contributed the correct images for the mermaid. I hope many of you still find the information here and our sister site helpful.\n\nMay 27, 2011: Landon\n\nI would like to take a moment and say thank you to everyone that continues to visit this site and the LUCT sister site. We continue to receive about 150 - 200 unique users a day. I hope all of the fans are enjoying LUCT on the PSP and their multiple playthroughs of TKOL. I may finish adding area images to the maps section at some point, but for now enjoy the weath of information provided.\n\nJanuary 18, 2011: Landon\n\nHappy New Year to everyone. As many of you know, the remake of Tactics Ogre: LUCT is available for purchase on February 15, 2011. Recieve a 22 card tarot deck with a pre-order from either Amazon EBGames or Gamestop. I have also added a new link to the Ogre Battle 64 Archive.\n\nAugust 16, 2010: Landon\n\nAs some of you may know by now, Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together is coming out on PSP as a remake with bonus material. One of the site fans informed me that the release date is listed as March 31, 2011. He was also kind enough to provide links to the official site and a site containing the latest game information and screenshots called Tactics Ogre Wheel of Fortune. Thus far, it has been confirmed that there is one new recruitable character and a new Rogue class. The links page also received an update thanks to fan submissions for Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen related websites.\n\nJune 2, 2010: Landon\n\nI have replaced Bearsman's walkthrough with one created by Shotgunnova. His walkthrough contains a more robust and complete guide to the game. Thank you to Shotgunnova for allowing the site to host a copy of the guide. I will also begin adding pictures to the Map section of each location using Shotgunnova's work in the coming weeks.\n\nApril 4, 2010: Landon\n\nLast week marked this site's ninth year anniversary. In other news, Nintendo has put Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Calibur on the Wii Vitural Console for 1000 Wii Points. I highly encourage everyone to get a copy who may have missed it on the Nintendo 64. I have removed all dead links found in the links section. Please send me an email if you happen to know of any other Ogre Battle Saga sites worth linking. If you are a webmaster for one of the past Ogre Battle Saga sites and would like assistance with hosting, please let me know as well.\n\nApril 26, 2009: Landon\n\nOgre Battle can now be purchased on the Wii Virtual Console for 800 Wii Points ($8). I highly recommend picking it up. The game is a throwback to the original unit strategy games and has a great story as well as multiple endings. In case you do not own a Wii, look for a copy on the PSX or SNES. I have renewed this site for one more year. Thanks again to all of the fans for their support over the many years. I still enjoy receiving emails from visitors.\n\nJanuary 27, 2009: Landon\n\nAccording to rumors, Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen will soon hit the Wii Virtual Console. However, there are no recent updates on the site.\n\nSeptember 21, 2008: Landon\n\nThe site luct.tacticsogre.com is functional again. You must leave out the www. to access it. Thanks for your patience in fixing the technical difficulties. If you have any further questions or comments feel free to send me a e-mail.\n\nSeptember 14, 2008: Landon\n\nI have switched hosts for the site. The subdomain should be up and running in a few days. I would like to thank everyone for their patience during the partial downtime of the site. My new hosts are much better and no further problems should occur. Thanks again to the fans who sent me e-mails, posted on the forum, and care about this site. It would not be here without you.\n\nMarch 17, 2008: Landon\n\nI want to let everyone know that the site has been renewed for another year and will continue to be available for fans of both TKOL and LUCT. There are no new updates except that I have heard a rumor of another Ogre Battle Saga game in the works for the Wii. The forum remains fairly inactive but many members check it everyday (including myself) so don't be shy to create a new thread or post.\n\nNovember 28, 2007: Landon\n\nThere are no recent updates to the site, but I thought it would be fun to share some information and offer suggestions on recent related games. Rumor has it that Square is interested in bringing a new Ogre Battle Saga game to the Nintendo Wii. Obviously, if this happens it would not be released for at least another year or two. There are some new games out for the Nintendo DS that anyone who was a fan of TKOL would enjoy. Heroes of Mana is a RTS game with plenty of regular and bonus missions to keep strategy fans happy. The game is well produced, but issues with AI and movement tracking can make it frustrating at times. I have been playing it and going online to get new missions. I find the game very fun and it actually takes some thinking to plan attacks. Final Fantasy XII: Reverant Wings is a new RTS hybrid out for the Nintendo DS. It has a higher production value than Heroes of Mana and continues the story from XII on the PS2. The game is a hybrid because of the battle system. Supposedly less strategy is involved in the game but there are 100 missions to please any strategy fans. For more information on either game check out reviews found on your favorite gaming site.\n\nSeptember 9, 2007: Landon\n\nIt has been a long time since the last update. I hope everyone is doing well now that school is in session and the summer has come to an end. No major chances have occured on the site. The forum has been more active lately so come on by and leave a post or two. Feel free to e-mail me with any questions or comments.\n\nMay 8, 2007: Landon\n\nI have made a little update to the Maps section. Urodela and Sufrir now have images of the levels that were given to me by Destina Faroda on the message boards.\n\nApril 16, 2007: Landon\n\nAs some of you know I am a student at Virginia Tech. I am sure you are all aware of the news stories about the events that occured this morning at my college. I appreciate the warm concerns of members of the forums and other friends I have. However, at least one of my friends was killed. I am awaiting the official annoucement from the college and police for additional names of friends. Please think about them and their loved ones. I will be fine, but I know it is extremely hard to cope with losing someone very close to you. Thank you to everyone who has given their support to my college and other students.\n\nApril 2, 2007\n\nI know it has been a while since the last update, so here is some current news. The site was renewed last month for another year of hosting. Thanks to the fans, I have kept this site running for 5 years now. The fifth birthday was a week ago. I am also pleased to announce this site is #1 on Google search for both \"Tactics Ogre\" and \"Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis.\" It has finally surpassed the Atlus site, which is pretty awesome. This site and the sub-domain for the PSX game continue to receive a few thousand unique visitors a month. Another interesting fact is that the majority of the visitors are international people using translating sites to view the pages. I think it is really cool that the fan base is so diverse.\n\nFor those of you that may have some interest in meeting me in the near future, I will be attending Animazement in Durham NC next month and Anime Mid-Atlantic in Richmond, VA in June. If you would like to meet up at either anime conventions, just drop me an e-mail. In addition to those, some of you may know that I am the President of the Animation Society at Virginia Tech. If any of you are interested in the club or Virginia Tech you can shoot me an e-mail or visit the site www.vtas.org.\n\nJanuary 31, 2007\n\nI have done a small update. Asghard from the message board submitted the information on obtaining the Circlet of Wisdom. It can be found listed under the Special Items part of the Secrets section.\n\nJanuary 1, 2007: Landon\n\nHappy New Year to everyone and thanks for your support this past year! For those of you interested in seeing the original page for this site, take a vist to www.tacticsogre.netfirms.com I have not changed it since the beginning and the relics are still there. Obviously there have been some improvements over the past four years. I still check my e-mail quite often and can found on myspace and facebook. Once again thanks for visiting and enjoy the rest of the holiday season!\n\nNovember 16, 2006: Landon\n\nI hope everyone is enjoying/about to enjoy their Thanksgiving break. I will be going to AnimeUSA this weekend so if anyone sees this and wants to meet up then please send me an e-mail! As always no real updates for the site other than a few words for thought. I have been playing a fair amount of Battlefield 2142 between school work. If you have the game then feel free to send me a buddyrequest. My name in the game is Agent-OS (yes with a - ). For those of you that want it, Best Buy is selling it on black friday for $24.99. If you have any suggestions or things to add to the site then drop me an e-mail as I check it about once a day.\n\nSeptember 27, 2006: Landon\n\nNot much has changed other than college work has been piling up and the site is still here. If you have any ideas about new content or want to include something on the website just e-mail me! I appreciated the myspace adds from some of yall. If you would like to myspace friend me here is my profile. In case some of you did not know, I am a big anime fan and run the club at Virginia Tech. We have Animefest (48 hours of anime) coming up Oct 13th weekend. Everyone is welcome and more information can be found here. I will also be attending AnimeUSA in November so feel free to contact me about meeting up and having some fun!\n\nJuly 17, 2006: Landon\n\nI will be attending Otakon this year in Baltimore, MD the weekend of August 5th. I thought it would be a cool idea to give fans who are also attending the convention a chance to meet me! There will be atleast 20,000 people there so it should be a great time. If you are attending and would like to meet up just drop me an e-mail.\n\nJune 30, 2006: Landon\n\nI noticed something on Ebay the other day that is worth mentioning. There is an auction up for a brand NEW copy of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together for sale! I cannot believe this game is new after coming out in the late 90s. Here is a link to the very rare auction. Auction for NEW Tactics Ogre: LUCT\n\nJune 9, 2006: Landon\n\nI did a major update to the Codes section of the website. Thanks Vicente for sending then to me. It now contains gameshark codes to modify character stats and an inifinite goth code.\n\nMay 31, 2006\n\nThe site reached four years last month! That is quite an achievement. Also I have fixed some small errors that were pointed out. Thank you to everyone who continues to support this site. It is here for you to enjoy!\n\nMarch 11, 2006\n\nI am posting an update here just to show I am still alive and everything. The site has had some random downtime due to the host in the past month as well. The forums have been slow lately so come on over and post to spice it up. Feel free to e-mail me about any questions and comments.\n\nJanuary 11, 2006\n\nI just purchased another year of hosting and domain use for about $75. This site will be around for one more year so fans can enjoy it once again. Around 4400 unique visitors come to this site on a monthly basis which is quite good for the amount of updating I do. I also answer every e-mail I recieve so feel free to drop me a line. The message board is suffering a bit so feel free to post if you are new to the site or missed signing up on it before.\n\nNovember 8, 2005: Landon\n\nI have taken off the affiliates on the site to make it clean again. The links have been on for a long time and I felt like they needed to go. This site is for fans by fans and I want to make it as enjoyable as possible to visitors and fans of the series. Even though the site is not updated too much these days I doI check my email on a regular basis so feel free to send me any comments or questions.\n\nSeptember 15, 2005: Landon\n\nI really have nothing special to say beside the fact that an update was due. If anyone wants to write a guide for the site or has in the past fell free to send it to me for review. If I find it useful and not repeat information it will go up. I have not updated the content on the site since the information is plentiful. The hits for the site are still around the average (200 unique people a day and about 6000 a month). I encourage all visitors to check out the message board and join in on discussions with other fans of the series.\n\nAugust 5, 2005: Landon\n\nI have finally found a way to make website t-shirts available for everyone at a minimal price of around $15 including shipping. The images below here are the 2 used for the shirt and the 4 links are the actual shirt I purchased last week for $15 including shipping. I was going to make a shop on www.cafepress.com but they charge even more for the shirts that way. If you want a shirt, copy the images I have provided here, go to www.cafepress.com and create a custom white t-shirt or any other shirt, and add the images to the front and back! Please drop me an email if you do order one or make a post on the message board. I would like to know how many are made. If you have any questions just ask. Also check out the new Walkthrough for Paths A and B posted in the FAQs and Guides section. Thanks again Cheesedude for submitting it.\n\nShirt images:\n\nhttp://www.tacticsogre.com/tshirt-1.jpg\n\nhttp://www.tacticsogre.com/tshirt-2.jpg\n\nhttp://www.tacticsogre.com/tshirt-3.jpg\n\nhttp://www.tacticsogre.com/tshirt-4.jpg\n\nFront:\n\nhttp://www.tacticsogre.com/front2.jpg\n\nBack choice 1:\n\nhttp://www.tacticsogre.com/tobacker2.jpg\n\nBack choice 2:\n\nhttp://www.tacticsogre.com/tobacker.jpg\n\nAugust 3, 2005: Landon\n\nI have added a new walkthrough in the FAQs & Guides section. It is a walkthrough for both paths A & B with strategies for each battle. Thanks Cheesedude from the boards for submitting the guide. I have also been thinking of a way to offer website t-shirts at a cheaper price than before. I ordered a custom shirt through cafepress.com to see how it looks. It was $15 including shipping. I will make it available to everyone for order once I get the shirt and see if it is worthwhile.\n\nJune 20, 2005: Landon\n\nI have added some fascinating information on the sales figures regarding the games in the Ogre Battle Saga. This word document found in the FAQs and Guides section has data on the GBA and N64 Ogre Battle games along with other GBA and N64 games. I highly recommend you check it out since this information is extremely hard to find. I would like to thank Tetra for submitting it. I also cleaned up the main page.\n\nMay 21, 2005: Landon\n\nOur message board was updated to Proboards Version 4 the other week. It went through a bit of a change and now has some cool new features such as quick reply that were added to it so check it out. Nothing else has been updated as there is already a ton of content. I would like to add images of the stages with treasure locations to the map section, but I do not have the time to do so. If anyone else out there would like to contribute some images for it I would appreciate it and give due credit. On another note I have been playing Guild Wars in what little free time I have due to a summer job and my user name on it is Alex Stromgald. Say hey to me if you see me on and maybe we can quest together. I would also like to say congradulations to all the High School and college graduates around this time and good luck in your next steps in life.\n\nApril 3, 2005\n\nI have added two new map images for Harmonia and Charadrius so check them out and thanks to Mog Eder for making them. This month celebrates our 3rd year aniversary which is great! Thanks to all the fans for their contributions of FAQs and information to the site and for visiting. The frequent visitors and message board use has increased by a large margin in the past two months. I never ask for $ contributions nor do I expect to get any, this site is made by fans for fans. If you ever feel the need to be generous and need to buy a new computer, using the links to affliates for purchasing will help pay for the hosting. Also there is a new sponsor link added. It is my friend's new service that offers custom made computer cases that you can carry around as a suitcase. For more information check out his site.\n\nFebruary 24, 2005: Landon\n\nA new FAQ was posted on Gorgons so check it out. Thanks to TreasureFinder for submitting it. I have also added a new link to Destina's Ogre Battle Webcomics under Ogre Battle Saga in the links section.\n\nFebruary 2, 2005\n\nThe message board is five away from 1000 members! Come join in on the excitement as we hit a milestone. I am currently taking a break from updating the website since I finished the massive map project. I have no other project ideas in mind except maybe revamping a section. I think most people can agree with me that this site has a ton of information already. I just renewed the hosting fee for this year at a price of $62 from my own pockets. As said in the past, I keep this site going to help fellow gamers and for the Ogre Battle Saga that I love so much. If you have any ideas on future projects for the site let me know.\n\nJanuary 10, 2005\n\nThe map section is finally finished! It took too many hours but I got everything done. If you find any mistakes please e-mail me. Also the new Zelda game \"Zelda: The Minish Cap\" comes out today so go get yourself a copy.\n\nJanuary 4, 2005\n\nJust as promised I completed Arena, Bison and Belleza in the map section. I plan to have everything done by January 15th when I go back to school.\n\nDecember 31, 2004\n\nI have uploaded Ardea and Aquila in the map section. I will hopefully have them all done by next weekend. I hope everyone has a great new year.\n\nDecember 6, 2004: Landon\n\nSorry for the lack of updates. I have been with school and exams are starting next week. I plan to finish the map over Christmas break since I will have almost a month off. I frequent the message board atleast four times a week so share some information on the latest games, news, hobbies, and everyone's favorite game Tactics Ogre: TKOL.\n\nNovember 1, 2004: Landon\n\nHey everyone, I have updated Haena and Harmonia in the map section. I just got back from AnimeUSA this past weekend. It was a lot of fun and I meet some really cool people. If you go to conventions and are planning to go Katsucon or AMA 5 let me know. The board has had a tremendous increase in activity this past week so go check it out! We would love your imput!\n\nOctober 9, 2004: Landon\n\nI updated Formido and Sotavento on the map. I have been pretty busy because of school. However, I still answer all the email I recieve. If you have a problem with tracking down the game, need help with something in relation to it, or want to share something interesting with me, feel free to send me an email. I will hopefully do more work on the site this coming week."
