Depending on your carrier and network conditions, you might not be able to use mobile data for Remote Play.\n\nIf your device is connected to Wi-Fi®, you'll continue to use Wi-Fi when you start Remote Play.\n\nLaunch PS Remote Play on your mobile device, and then select Sign In to PSN.\n\nSign in with the same account that you use for your console.\n\nSelect Settings at the upper right corner of the screen, and then select Mobile Data > Use Mobile Data.\n\nSelect OK.\n\nHow to start PS Remote Play from your mobile device\n\nYou'll take the following steps each time you connect to your PS5 console or PS4 console from your mobile device.\n\nTurn on your console or put it into rest mode.\n\nLaunch PS Remote Play on your mobile device, and then select Sign In to PSN.\n\nSign in with the same account that you use for your console.\n\nSelect PS5 or PS4.\n\nThe app searches for the console that you’ve signed in to using your account, and then connects to the console automatically. After it connects, the screen of your console displays on your mobile device and you can start using PS Remote Play. If multiple consoles are found, select the console that you'd like to use.\n\nFrom the second time onwards, you'll be able to select the console that you connected to previously.\n\nYour mobile device won't be able to search and connect to your console if it's been a while since you last signed in. Before trying to connect remotely from outside your home, check that your device connects properly while you're near your console.\n\nDuring Remote Play, you may see \"Remote Play connected.\" at the top of your screen. This message appears when another user logs into your PS5 console while you're using Remote Play. When that user logs out of your PS5 console, the message disappears."
