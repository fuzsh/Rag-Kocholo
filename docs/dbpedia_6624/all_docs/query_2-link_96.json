        "text": "The PlayStation 5 is looking to dominate the console landscape with its incredible library of games. Sure, the best Xbox Series X games and best Switch games are no slouches, but PlayStation exclusives are held to a higher standard. Of course, nearly every third-party game under the sun makes its way onto the PS5 eventually, and even some former Xbox exclusives too, making it the best place to play this generation.\n\nAnd there are plenty more great titles on the way — don’t forget to check out our list of the best upcoming PS5 games that will come out later this year.\n\nAction & Adventure\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man 2\n\n88%\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nHack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nInsomniac Games\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nOctober 20, 2023\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated sequel from Insomniac Games, raises the bar in every aspect. It shines on the PS5, delivering stunning visuals, and the gameplay matches that excellence with numerous enhancements. From improved combat to web-swinging through the city, sid-quests, and more, everything is better than ever.\n\nThis grand sequel seamlessly juggles a plethora of ideas, creating an overwhelming, yet sleek adventure. Even with a 100% completion goal, it’s a manageable 35-hour journey. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 not only lives up to its predecessor, but surpasses it, crafting an emotional and inclusive superhero experience that’s unique to the world of video games.\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 - PlayStation Showcase 2021: Reveal Trailer | PS5\n\nAlan Wake 2\n\n91%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nRemedy Entertainment\n\nPublisher\n\nEpic Games\n\nRelease\n\nOctober 27, 2023\n\nIn the spine-tingling world of Alan Wake 2, Saga Anderson delves into the eerie investigation of ritualistic murders in a quaint town, while Alan Wake himself weaves a sinister tale that shapes reality. These two enigmatic heroes find themselves intertwined by fate and compelled to embrace their latent powers.\n\nRemedy Entertainment’s long-anticipated Alan Wake 2 delivers a genuinely frightening survival horror experience. The game masterfully blends mind-bending narratives with engrossing survival horror gameplay inspired by Resident Evil remakes. Despite some initial technical hiccups, it stands as Remedy Interactive’s most confident and fully realized creative vision. It explores the depths of horror, both in our everyday nightmares and the chilling stories we craft to confront them. For those who relish compelling and hair-raising narratives, Alan Wake 2 is a must-play where the less you know, the more spookier it becomes.\n\nAlan Wake 2 – Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2021\n\nGhost of Tsushima: Director's Cut\n\n95%\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nSucker Punch Productions\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nAugust 20, 2021\n\nServing as an enhanced version of one of the best PS4 games, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut is a must-play. In this open-world action-adventure, you play as a samurai warrior Jin Sakai who seeks revenge after a group of Mongols left him for dead. Referred to as the “Ghost” after surviving the encounter with the Mongols, Sakai explores the island of Tsushima to recruit allies for battle. It includes fast-paced action, a beautiful open world to explore, and even a dedicated multiplayer mode called Legends. The Director’s Cut also features the Iki Island story expansion, taking place after the events of the base game.\n\nGhost of Tsushima Director's Cut - Announcement Trailer | PS5, PS4\n\nGod of War Ragnarök\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nHack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nSIE Santa Monica Studio\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nNovember 09, 2022\n\nIt’s always impressive when a sequel to a highly-acclaimed game can actually live up to its predecessor. That’s the case with God of War Ragnarok, which successfully rode the hype train all the way to launch, landing to rave reviews. The action-adventure sequel pulls it off by largely sticking to the formula established in God of War (2018), but it makes some key changes to help make it stand out. The biggest of those comes from its refined combat, which makes chopping up enemies with the Leviathan Ax and Blades of Chaos even more satisfying. Your mileage may vary when it comes to story, but God of War Ragnarok is undoubtedly a triumphant return for Kratos.\n\nGod Of War Ragnarok - PlayStation Showcase 2021 Reveal Trailer | PS5\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nRespawn Entertainment\n\nPublisher\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nRelease\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor is a sequel to 2019’s excellent Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and expands on it in almost every way. The story feels more ambitious and personal at the same time, as all of the worlds players can explore as Cal are more densely packed with content than before, and combat has been refined to be even more fun thanks to new stances and perks players can use.\n\nIt’s an entirely single-player Star Wars adventure and a meaty one at that. This game can easily keep you entertained for 20 hours or more and tells the most engaging Star Wars narrative since Andor. This is one of the best Star Wars games ever made, so fans of the franchise shouldn’t miss out on it.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor - Official Teaser\n\nLies of P\n\n87%\n\n3.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG)\n\nDeveloper\n\nRound8 Studio\n\nPublisher\n\nNEOWIZ\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 18, 2023\n\nLies of P, the quirky Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike game with a Timothée Chalamet look-alike, is a surprisingly competent addition to the genre. Drawing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Bloodborne, it immerses players in a fascinating world with a unique twist on Soulslike gameplay. While some boss fights can be frustrating, they add to the game’s charm and overall appeal. Lies of P has a captivating setting and distinctive gameplay systems, and it has a place among the genre’s top contenders like Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Code Vein, and Nioh. Despite its unusual premise, the game’s confident execution earns it respect and a strong recommendation for fans of FromSoftware-style titles.\n\nResident Evil 4\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Puzzle, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nCapcom Development Division 1\n\nPublisher\n\nCapcom\n\nRelease\n\nMarch 24, 2023\n\nBefore you jump in for your hit of nostalgia, you should know that this isn’t 2005’s Resident Evil 4. Instead of putting out a shot-for-shot remake — a truly transformative remake that isn’t afraid to throw out what didn’t work and put its own creative spin on everything from story to level design to its wildly improved combat. Capcom delivers everything you want in more in this stellar revisit to one of the most iconic titles in the Resident Evil series.\n\nResident Evil 4 - Announcement Trailer\n\nLike a Dragon: Ishin!\n\n3.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nRyū Ga Gotoku Studios\n\nPublisher\n\nSega\n\nRelease\n\nFebruary 21, 2023\n\nA remake of 2014’s Ryuu ga Gotoku Ishin! (released only in Japan) Like a Dragon: Ishin! takes place in 1867, during Japan’s regime-changing Bakumatsu era, and stars Sakamoto Ryoma, a character resembling former Like a Dragon series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. This new-to-the-West Like a Dragon installment will be a romp for longtime fans and newcomers alike.\n\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! | Announcement Trailer\n\nThe Last of Us Part I\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nNaughty Dog\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 02, 2022\n\nWhile the original The Last of Us for PS3 still holds up, technology has advanced tremendously since the game first launched in 2013. That’s why Naughty Dog and Sony decided to remake this game, exclusively for PS5 (and PC at a later date). What you get is a revamped version of what was already one of the best games ever made. Of course, visuals have been overhauled, with its characters mirroring their counterparts from The Last of Us Part II. Beyond that, a slew of gameplay improvements, such as smarter AI, have been implemented, making the game feel more immersive. It also utilizes the PS5’s best features, including haptic feedback. Full stop, this is the definitive version of The Last of Us.\n\nThe Last of Us Part I - Announce Trailer\n\nThe Last of Us Part II: Remastered\n\n99%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nNaughty Dog\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nAnd once you’re done with Part I you can roll right into The Last of Us Part II Remastered. The PS4 version did get a PS5 patch, but this version is built specifically for the new hardware. It looks and runs better, but the real treat are the new additions. There’s a host of cut content you can explore and hear little dev diaries about to learn about the process of making the game, plus a survival mode. This small roguelike mode lets you play as various characters taking on waves of enemies in contained maps to really dive deep into the excellent combat mechanics.\n\nThe Last of Us Part II Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nStray\n\n83%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Indie\n\nDeveloper\n\nBlueTwelve Studio\n\nPublisher\n\nAnnapurna Interactive\n\nRelease\n\nJuly 19, 2022\n\nStray is one of the most unique games to have launched in a while, offering an emotional story and a cute, cuddly feline protagonist. This cat game has taken the industry by storm, but it’s not just a meme. Stray really is fantastic and deserves all the praise it has received. It includes light platforming, puzzles, and some stealth segments that are approachable, yet satisfying, allowing players of all skill levels to enjoy. Beyond its easy-going gameplay are its stunning visuals that are gorgeous, yet stylized, making it hard to look away. There’s a lot going for Stray, and it’s one that all players should check out, even if you aren’t a cat-lover.\n\nSTRAY | Teaser Trailer\n\nThe Callisto Protocol\n\n68%\n\n3.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nStriking Distance Studios\n\nPublisher\n\nKrafton\n\nRelease\n\nDecember 02, 2022\n\nThe Callisto Protocol is a survival-horror game set in a maximum-security prison on Jupiter’s moon, Callisto. Players take on the role of a character trying to escape the prison while facing off against a variety of terrifying enemies. The game features intense, atmospheric gameplay and high-quality graphics that create a truly immersive experience. It also has an intense story and the survival horror element ensures the players will be on the edge of their seat. With the AAA development team at Striking Distance Studios behind it, it’s a thrilling adventure for horror and sci-fi fans.\n\nThe Callisto Protocol - Cinematic Trailer Reveal\n\nHorizon Forbidden West\n\n88%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nGuerrilla Games\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nHorizon Forbidden West is the culmination of all the things Guerrilla Games has learned over the years. It’s an open-world action RPG with a stellar story, well-written characters, and incredibly satisfying gameplay, making it hard to put down. It’s a game that looks expensive, featuring some of the most beautiful visuals we’ve ever seen. The gameplay mechanics have been refined from its predecessor, making it much easier to traverse the world, defeat enemies, and progress through the story. For instance, the implementation of a glider is a huge improvement, as it means the main character, Aloy, can get around with ease. And of course, there aren’t many games like Horizon, giving it an edge over the competition. Taking down massive mechanical dinosaurs is just as cool as it sounds, as is exploring the sprawling open world this game has to offer. Guerrilla Games is at the top of its class and we can’t wait to see what the team does next.\n\nKena: Bridge of Spirits\n\n80%\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nEmber Lab\n\nPublisher\n\nEmber Lab\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 21, 2021\n\nKena: Bridge of Spirits isn’t a big-budget, Sony-published game, but it sure feels like one. The PlayStation console exclusive is actually an indie game developed by Ember Lab, an animation studio-turned-developer. You probably wouldn’t know that at first glance, because it’s one of the best-looking games we saw in the PS5’s first year. A vibrant color palette, detailed character design, and cinematic cutscenes that rival the best CG animated films all come together to make this the kind of statement debut that can’t be ignored. On a gameplay level, Kena is just as polished. It’s a tightly designed adventure game that draws inspiration from franchises like Zelda, Dark Souls, Uncharted, and Pikmin. Every little system, from its satisfying mobility tools to its deceptively tough combat, is elegantly built, making every single tool feel purposeful. But the real star of the show is the Rot, a gaggle of tiny creatures that follow Kena around. They can be commanded like Pikmin and used to find secrets and help out in battle. It’s a game that feels timeless, drawing on classic adventure tropes, while still inventing its own original ideas that make it stand apart.\n\nGhostWire: Tokyo\n\n76%\n\n3.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nTango Gameworks\n\nPublisher\n\nBethesda Softworks\n\nRelease\n\nMarch 25, 2022\n\nHailing from Tango Gameworks, the studio that created The Evil Within series, comes Ghostwire Tokyo, a game that plays nothing like the developer’s previous projects. Ghostwire Tokyo still features spooky elements but is more of an action-adventure than a horror game. In it, you play as a character who can utilize magic to defeat ghosts in an open-world rendition of Tokyo — hence the name. It’s a first-person shooter, sort of, only you use spells to take on enemies. It also features light RPG mechanics, with a robust skill tree that rewards you for your efforts. Ghostwire Tokyo is super stylized and is an underrated gem on PS5.\n\nGhostwire: Tokyo – Official E3 Teaser\n\nNo Man's Sky\n\n69%\n\n3/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, SteamVR, PlayStation VR, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Meta Rift, PlayStation VR2\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Simulator, Adventure, Indie\n\nDeveloper\n\nHello Games\n\nPublisher\n\nHello Games, 505 Games, Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nAugust 09, 2016\n\nThere isn’t anything like No Man’s Sky. In this game, pretty much anything you can see, you can explore — from any area on a planet to other worlds and even other solar systems. In this space-exploration game, you have access to a practically endless list of planets to visit, each with its own weather, wildlife, and inhabitants. But exploration isn’t the only thing you can do in this game. No Man’s Sky blends survival, combat, resource management, and even multiplayer action, culminating in one of the most ambitious games of all time.\n\nNo Man's Sky - Paris Games Week 2015 Trailer (Official)\n\nRPGs\n\nDiablo IV\n\n89%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up\n\nDeveloper\n\nBlizzard Entertainment\n\nPublisher\n\nBlizzard Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nJune 02, 2023\n\nDiablo IV brings the series back to its roots with a darker tone and aesthetic while also keeping the combat and looting grind as enthralling as ever. Diablo‘s Sanctuary is rich with grisly lore, and this has never been more apparent than in Diablo 4. The big villains are ambiguous in their motives but decidedly evil in their methods, and they’re played brilliantly throughout the campaign. Moreover, the graphical fidelity, music, and sound design are all top-tier, which is surprising given its frustrating always-online nature.\n\nDiablo IV Official Gameplay Trailer\n\nBaldur's Gate 3\n\n81%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), Mac, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Google Stadia\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Strategy, Turn-based strategy (TBS), Tactical, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nLarian Studios\n\nPublisher\n\nLarian Studios\n\nRelease\n\nOctober 06, 2020\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is a massive turn-based fantasy RPG that captures the experience of playing Dungeons & Dragons better than any other video game. Character creation is top-notch and combat impresses, boiling down the complexities of D&D battles to an easy-to-understand, but deep system. We’re still early on in our adventure, but Baldur’s Gate 3 appears to be a major hit and a midyear contender for Game of the Year.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 - Official Announcement Trailer\n\nElden Ring\n\n84%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG)\n\nDeveloper\n\nFromSoftware\n\nPublisher\n\nBandai Namco Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\nSomehow, Elden Ring exceeded expectations, building upon its predecessors and featuring an incredible journey full of mystery and unease. That’s one of this game’s greatest strengths: It encourages you to explore by littering items and awe-inspiring boss battles all around the world while keeping you on the edge of your seat. This isn’t just Dark Souls in an open world. Every inch of this game feels meticulously crafted, with plenty of secrets to uncover. Of course, the game’s exploration is a selling point, but so is its combat, which feels like an impressive evolution from the Souls games. It’s not perfect, but developer FromSoftware absolutely knows what it’s doing when it comes to making an action RPG and we hope the studio continues creating open worlds like this one. Elden Ring is an absolute gem, throwing surprises at you every time you play.\n\nTales of Arise\n\n86%\n\n5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nBandai Namco Entertainment\n\nPublisher\n\nBandai Namco Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 10, 2021\n\nThe RPG genre is changing. Traditional, turn-based combat is slowly swapping over to more real-time action. We saw it in games like Final Fantasy VII Remake, but it was especially noticeable in Tales of Arise. The latest game in the classic Tales series was a significant change of pace for longtime fans with its retooled combat. Sometimes, a big change like that can be a cause for concern. Luckily, no worries were needed here: Tales of Arise is one of the best JRPGs in recent years. Developed by Bandai Namco, Tales of Arise tells a weighty story about government tyranny in a divided world. A party of heroes come together to save the day, but more importantly, they just get to hang out and become friends. The game features delightful party chats that reveal each character’s specific quirks. Most notable of all is the game’s gorgeous art style, which takes inspiration from watercolor paintings. For fans of the genre, Tales of Arise is an instant classic that pushes RPGs further into the future.\n\nFinal Fantasy XVI\n\n3/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG)\n\nDeveloper\n\nSquare Enix\n\nPublisher\n\nSquare Enix\n\nRelease\n\nJune 22, 2023\n\nFinal Fantasy XVI isn’t as impressive as some past installments in the series but it’s still a really enjoyable, beautiful action RPG hybrid that continues Final Fantasy’s long legacy of drastically changing things up with each new mainline entry.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XVI – Awakening Trailer | PS5\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\n93%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nSquare Enix Creative Business Unit I\n\nPublisher\n\nSquare Enix\n\nRelease\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\nIf you prefer the slightly more tactical combat from the new Final Fantasy VII games, Rebirth has more content than you could ask for. Following up on Remake, the crew is now out in the open world of Midgar, which is jam-packed with side quests, collectibles, monsters, and more. The main story is just as personal and nail-biting as before — especially at the end. But make sure you don’t skip over the excellent Queen’s Blood card game. That alone could suck up a dozen hours of your time if you get hooked on it like we did.\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH – First Look Trailer\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla\n\n76%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Google Stadia\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nUbisoft Montreal\n\nPublisher\n\nUbisoft Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nNovember 10, 2020\n\nAnytime a new console comes out, players are looking for the biggest games they can find that will push their new box to its limits. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is exactly that kind of game. The Viking epic is Ubisoft’s biggest, most ambitious open-world game yet, and it’s sure to wow players on sheer scope alone. There’s no shortage of things to do in the game’s massive re-creation of England. Between raids, settlement building, drinking contests, Viking rap battles, and more, it’s a game that will keep players occupied for a very long time. The campaign itself gets up to the 60-hour mark and completionists will spend well over 100 hours exploring everything the game has to offer. It’s a perfect game for anyone who’s hoping to buy fewer games with more content now that new releases cost $70.\n\nDemon's Souls\n\n87%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up\n\nDeveloper\n\nBluepoint Games\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\nThe “souls-like” phenomenon has spawned countless games over the years, from Bloodborne to last year’s standout Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Dark Souls is often credited with creating the genre of frustrating action games, but that’s not exactly true. The trend started with Demon’s Souls, FromSoftware’s 2009 action RPG. For those who are worried that the game hasn’t aged well in the past decade, the new Demon’s Souls remake for PlayStation 5 restores the game to its former glory. The new version is still the hyper-difficult game fans of the original grew to love (and hate), but it brings a few tweaks to the table. A new Fractured mode reverses the game’s map, creating a mirror mode for the game. New items, weapons, and armor are added to the mix to freshen up fights. There’s even a photo mode, which allows players to better take in the remake’s huge graphical boost. It’s a great starting point for anyone looking for a history lesson in one of gaming’s most polarizing genres.\n\nScarlet Nexus\n\n74%\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nBandai Namco Studios\n\nPublisher\n\nBandai Namco Studios\n\nRelease\n\nJune 24, 2021\n\nScarlet Nexus looked like it would be one of the PS5’s first big games. The action RPG got a massive spotlight in Sony’s PS5 reveal stream. Despite an eye-catching trailer, it got a little lost in the mix next to games like Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Horizon Forbidden West. It seemed like it could be destined for hidden gem status and that’s exactly what happened. Scarlet Nexus was a surprise hit of summer 2021, bringing a unique blend of complex action and brain-twisting sci-fi storytelling to consoles. The selling point of Scarlet Nexus is its combat. Players can use telekinesis to hurl objects at enemies, which goes hand in hand with fast-paced slashing. Players can bring along allies, each of which has a different elemental power that augments the standard move set. One ally may add electric powers to your move set, while another can temporarily slow down time. It’s the kind of game that lets players rack up some astonishing combos, which makes it perfect for players who love games like Astral Chain and Bayonetta.\n\nLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth\n\n84%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nRole-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nRyū Ga Gotoku Studios\n\nPublisher\n\nSega\n\nRelease\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\nLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is a remarkable entry in the series because it manages to give two larger-than-life protagonists equal roles and care in a single game. Both Ichiban and Kiryu are on deeply personal quests that intertwine in a larger conspiracy. This is the first time the series has ventured out of Japan, but the game still retains the heart and soul of the franchise, walking a fine between silly and serious thanks in part to tremendously funny and heartfelt performances from its actors. But arguably, its greatest strength is the turn-based combat, which builds upon the excellent foundation of the last game.\n\n『龍が如く８』ティザートレーラー\n\nShooters\n\nRemnant II\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nGunfire Games\n\nPublisher\n\nGearbox Publishing\n\nRelease\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nStep into a realm of relentless survival and unyielding battles in Remnant II, the eagerly awaited follow-up to the acclaimed Remnant: From the Ashes. Humanity’s remnants confront an onslaught of otherworldly beasts and omnipotent adversaries across harrowing dimensions. Rally solo or join forces with a pair of companions to plumb the enigmas that guard against reality’s annihilation. Skill and camaraderie prove paramount as you forge an unbreakable front against the brink of extinction. Beneath its seemingly typical third-person shooter experience, Remnant II boasts captivating mechanics — the game weaves combat akin to Souls titles with firearms, entwining them within a roguelike framework of ever-changing quests. Gunfire Games’ sequel resonates with the essence of its predecessor, making it a treasure trove for Remnant devotees and newcomers alike.\n\nRemnant 2 - Official Announcement Trailer\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II\n\n80%\n\n3.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter\n\nDeveloper\n\nInfinity Ward\n\nPublisher\n\nActivision Blizzard\n\nRelease\n\nOctober 28, 2022\n\nWhile this year’s Call of Duty installment is a bit of a mixed bag of gorgeous visuals and classic multiplayer despite pacing issues and some ugly UI choices. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II gives COD fans what they want — another COD game. If fast-paced warfare and detailed weapon customization are your jam, this is the first-person shooter for you (at least until Warzone 2.0 drops.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II - World Gameplay Reveal Trailer\n\nOverwatch 2\n\n65%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter\n\nDeveloper\n\nBlizzard Entertainment\n\nPublisher\n\nBlizzard Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nOctober 04, 2022\n\nOverwatch 2, the not-so-new and definitely improved free-to-play Overwatch “sequel,” has given the series new life for hardcore fans and newcomers alike. New heroes Junker Queen and Sojurn have joined the fight, old heroes have learned new skills, and there are already new character releases on the horizon. Overwatch 2‘s specific brand of objective-based shooter isn’t for everyone, but if it’s up your alley you’ll be playing this title well into the new year.\n\nOverwatch 2 - Free to Play Trailer - Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2022\n\nReturnal\n\n85%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nShooter\n\nDeveloper\n\nHousemarque\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nApril 30, 2021\n\nWhen the PS5 launched in November, it seemed like Sony was firing on all cylinders. While Microsoft had no real exclusives to pair with the Xbox Series X, Sony came out the gate with Demon’s Souls, Astro’s Playroom, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and more. That momentum ground to a halt over the next few months … that is until Returnal. The third-person shooter is a haunting action game that feels like the first real next-gen game. Part of what makes it feel so far beyond what we’ve seen so far is its Dualsense support. It takes full advantage of Sony’s unique controller to deliver a more immersive experience. The haptic feedback simulates everything from rain to the icky sensation of an alien parasite attaching to the main character’s body. The adaptive triggers are used to control different firing modes depending on how far they’re pressed down, doubling the functions of a single button. The built-in speaker drops helpful sound cues that let players know when their alt-fire has recharged, cutting through an otherwise busy sound mix. For those who really want to see what this generation is capable of, Returnal is the starting point.\n\nControl: Ultimate Edition\n\n87%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nRemedy Entertainment\n\nPublisher\n\n505 Games\n\nRelease\n\nAugust 27, 2020\n\nControl was a massive fan favorite when it originally launched in 2019. Remedy Entertainment’s off-kilter action game offered some mind-bending telekinesis and a bizarre story straight out of Twin Peaks. The game even landed a coveted Game of the Year nomination at the 2019 Game Awards. Now, next-gen console owners can get an Ultimate Edition of the game, which contains all of its DLC in one package. Control: Ultimate Edition frankly makes the game even better. While the original Control suffered from some tech hiccups and an unstable frame rate, the next-gen version runs much more smoothly. New tech means that the game looks better than ever too thanks to ray-tracing. For players who missed out the first time around, the next-gen version is a perfect excuse to jump back into one of the more inventive AAA games to launch in the past few years.\n\nDEATHLOOP\n\n84%\n\n3.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nArkane Studios\n\nPublisher\n\nBethesda Softworks\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 14, 2021\n\nEnjoy your time with Deathloop on PS5 while you can; this is one of the last times you’ll ever play a Bethesda game on a Sony console. The publisher’s games will be Xbox console exclusives from now on since Microsoft owns Bethesda. Due to a deal that existed pre-acquisition, Sony was able to lock down Arkane Studios’ latest game as a timed console exclusive for PS5, which is a bit of good foresight in retrospect. It’s the last hurrah for a long history between Bethesda and Sony. And what a send-off it is. Deathloop is one of the PS5’s most critically acclaimed titles. The first-person shooter is a clever stealth action game that combines the assassinations of Hitman with the supernatural powers of Dishonored. That’s all tied up in a roguelite gameplay hook where players relive the same day over and over. Each run is about collecting intel as Colt tries to figure out how to take down eight “visionaries” in one day and break the time loop. The game also features a creative (though polarizing) multiplayer mode where players can invade one another’s games and cause chaos. That’s all topped off with tight shooting and Arkane’s signature level-design strengths, making this a must-own PS5 game.\n\nTiny Tina's Wonderlands\n\n70%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nGearbox Software\n\nPublisher\n\n2K Games\n\nRelease\n\nMarch 25, 2022\n\nSet in the Borderlands universe, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands leans into fantasy themes while still incorporating shooter mechanics. This game borrows from the Borderlands games, featuring a similar leveling system and art style, but throws you into dungeons and pits you against dragons. Much like the Borderlands games, Wonderlands is funny, with well-written characters portrayed by beloved actors such as Andy Samberg, Will Arnett, and Wanda Sykes. Of course, Wonderlands is still a first-person shooter, so expect to collect all sorts of wacky guns and other weapons, including melee (for the first time in the series). This is certainly a game we’d recommend if you’re looking for a less intense experience, especially if you plan on playing with friends.\n\nTiny Tina’s Wonderlands – Official Announce Trailer\n\nResident Evil 2\n\n88%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nCapcom Development Division 1\n\nPublisher\n\nCapcom\n\nRelease\n\nJanuary 25, 2019\n\nIn 2022, Capcom released PS5 versions of modern Resident Evil games, including a remake of the second installment. The Resident Evil 2 remake is easily one of the best in the series, featuring revamped gameplay, enhanced visuals, and story tweaks. Most importantly, the remake redefined the gameplay from the 1998 original, making it more approachable while preserving the scares. Everything from the combat and puzzles to exploration and story in Resident Evil 2 is top-notch, making it one of the best survival-horror games ever made. The Ps5 version offers even better performance and visuals, with 4K resolution, ray tracing, and an increased frame rate. If you own the PS4 version, you gain access to the game on PS5 at no additional cost.\n\nResident Evil 2 Remake – Special Message from Producer “H”\n\nStrategy\n\nHITMAN 3\n\n86%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Google Stadia\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Tactical, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nIO Interactive\n\nPublisher\n\nIO Interactive\n\nRelease\n\nJanuary 20, 2021\n\nOver the past few years, IO Interactive has been knocking it out of the park with its Hitman series. The stealth action game got a huge boost of adrenaline in 2016 with the first game in a sort of rebooted trilogy called World of Assassination. Hitman introduced an ingenious puzzle element to the long-running series, allowing players to find creative and outrageous ways to take out targets. The series has only stayed consistent since, and now Hitman 3 offers a perfect capper to the trilogy. Hitman 3 doesn’t shake the formula up in many ways, instead opting to double down on what’s made the previous games so enjoyable. The levels are better than ever, offering sprawling sandboxes filled with challenges and surprises. The game’s murder mystery Dartmoor level is especially noteworthy, bringing a classic whodunnit movie setup to the game. Hitman 3 essentially acts as a house for all three games as players can import progress and levels from Hitman and Hitman 2, making it a must-own “complete edition” of the series.\n\nUnicorn Overlord\n\n80%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nReal Time Strategy (RTS), Role-playing (RPG), Strategy\n\nDeveloper\n\nVanillaware\n\nPublisher\n\nSega, Atlus\n\nRelease\n\nMarch 08, 2024\n\nThe talented minds at Vanillaware shifted genres completely with Unicorn Overlord and knocked it out of the park. This tactics game almost plays more like a tutorial in coding than anything else. Each squad of units can be given various conditions on how to react to different things since you don’t control them directly. You can tell your healers to heal specific units when they fall below certain thresholds or tell other units to only attack enemies with the lowest HP. If you enjoy tweaking every aspect your army and watching them crush the opposition, no other game quite gives you the level of control this one does.\n\nUnicorn Overlord — Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4\n\nPlatformer\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart\n\n89%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nShooter, Platform, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nInsomniac Games\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nJune 11, 2021\n\nEarly on in a console’s lifespan, each exclusive is heavily dissected. We’re always looking for how games push hardware in ways that truly make “next-gen” come to life. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart will be remembered as the first game that showed us the true potential of the PS5. While games like Returnal showed off what the DualSense controller is capable of, Drift Apart is more of a graphical powerhouse that uses the console’s solid-state drive to nearly eliminate load times altogether and fuel a gorgeous superhero spectacle. While we could wax poetic all day about how beautiful the game is, that doesn’t overshadow the fact that the game is just plain fun. Like other entries in the series, it’s an action-packed platformer filled with creative weapons. Notable new additions in Ratchet’s arsenal include a Topiary Sprinkler that turns enemies to shrubs and the new and improved RYNO-8, which pulls references from other Sony games into Ratchet’s dimension. It’s a colorful, exciting game that contains all the thrills of a summer blockbuster.\n\nIt Takes Two\n\n89%\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nPlatform, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nHazelight Studios\n\nPublisher\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nRelease\n\nMarch 25, 2021\n\nIt Takes Two might be the best multiplayer game of its kind. The two-player adventure game is a labor of love by Hazelight Studios and director Josef Fares. Rather than pitting players against each other, it’s a pure co-op game in which players solve puzzles and platform together. Each level features entirely new mechanics that keep things fresh throughout the 12-hour adventure. It’s a game that was designed from the ground up with multiplayer in mind and that shows. Good co-op games are hard to come by. While there are tons of multiplayer games out there, few ask players to work together to progress through an authored story. It Takes Two is a rare example of a game that cares about multiplayer mechanics as much as it cares about narrative. The story is a romantic comedy about a couple on the verge of divorce who are turned into tiny dolls. They must work together to both get back to normal and repair their relationship. It’s a clever narrative framework that pairs perfectly with a genre that’s built on good communication and cooperation between players. It’s a multiplayer game that’ll save your friendships, not destroy them.\n\nSackboy: A Big Adventure\n\n77%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nPlatform, Adventure\n\nDeveloper\n\nSumo Digital\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\nSackboy: A Big Adventure got a little lost in the 2020 shuffle. The game launched the same week as the PS5 and Xbox Series X, which meant it had to fight for attention. Sackboy was simply too small of a name to compete with franchises like Spider-Man and Assassin’s Creed. It even had to contend with Astro’s Playroom, a similar flavor of platformer that was free for PS5 owners right out the gate. The more time goes on, however, the more it becomes clear that Sackboy: A Big Adventure is already the console’s most criminally underappreciated game. The LittleBigPlanet spinoff is a traditional 3D platformer not unlike Super Mario 3D World. Players run, jump, grab power-ups, and everything you’d expect from the genre at this point. Sackboy excels in both charm and creativity, offering a simply delightful adventure. Had it been released at any other point in the year, it would have turned heads for its Nintendo-esque polish. Now that we’re past the PS5’s opening honeymoon period, it’s as good a time as any to revisit it and see what it has to offer.\n\nAstro's Playroom\n\n86%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPlayStation 5\n\nGenre\n\nPlatform\n\nDeveloper\n\nSIE Japan Studio\n\nPublisher\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\nConsole pack-in games can be a mixed bag, but Astro’s Playroom is one worth checking out. The free title is a pseudo-sequel to Astro Bot Rescue Mission, one of the best games virtual reality (VR) has to offer. While Astro’s Playroom doesn’t utilize the PSVR at all, it acts as an introduction to the new DualSense controller, showing off how its haptic feedback can work in games. Cheekily set in the inside of a PlayStation 5, players platform their way through areas based on the console’s design like a cooling fan-themed beach. In addition to running and jumping, the game introduces a slew of mechanics built around feedback. Jump into a spring and players can feel it coil as they press the adaptive triggers down. It’s a very short adventure, and one that’s more or less meant as a tech demo, but it’s not one to miss, especially considering that all PlayStation 5 owners will have it from the get-go.\n\nPuzzle\n\nCocoon\n\n90%\n\n4/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nPuzzle, Adventure, Indie\n\nDeveloper\n\nGeometric Interactive\n\nPublisher\n\nAnnapurna Interactive\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 29, 2023\n\nCocoon, crafted by the designer behind Limbo and Inside, invites players into a mesmerizing realm of insect-like creatures navigating worlds within worlds. This puzzle game, deceptively simple ,yet profoundly unique, showcases Director Jeppe Carlsen’s talent for intricately designed challenges. It offers an experience both grand and intimate, teleporting players into the minds of these enigmatic insects. Cocoon is a striking journey, celebrating the remarkable efficiency of Earth’s tiny creatures. While occasionally routine, it beckons players to fathom the instinctive intelligence of bugs.\n\nCOCOON - Reveal Trailer - Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2022\n\nTetris Effect: Connected\n\n93%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Meta Quest, Meta Quest 2, PlayStation VR2\n\nGenre\n\nMusic, Puzzle, Indie, Arcade\n\nDeveloper\n\nMonstars, Resonair\n\nPublisher\n\nEnhance\n\nRelease\n\nMay 14, 2020\n\nIf there’s a console with Tetris on it, it automatically becomes one of the best puzzle games on that system. Even if you’ve played Tetris on every console for the past three decades or more, Tetris Effect is something different. The perfect gameplay isn’t tampered with, but the audio and visual experience surrounding it is amplified to crazy heights. If you didn’t think you’d ever get emotional playing a game about falling blocks, give this one a try and see. If not, well, who doesn’t love Tetris?\n\nTetris Effect: Connected Announce Trailer | Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Windows 10 PC\n\nSports & Fighters\n\nStreet Fighter 6\n\n88%\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nFighting, Arcade\n\nDeveloper\n\nCapcom\n\nPublisher\n\nCapcom\n\nRelease\n\nJune 02, 2023\n\nStreet Fighter 6 feels like the most significant revelation for the fighting game genre since Street Fighter 2. No matter the skill level, all types of players will find something to enjoy here. The core fighting gameplay felt as amazing to play as ever, bolstered by a flashy new Drive Gauge system. Those who enjoy the series for its hardcore, competitive elements will like that, as well as its multiplayer Battle Hub mode. That said, Street Fighter 6 is also the friendliest fighting game ever for newcomers to the genre. New modern controls, as well as a meaty RPG World Tour mode that teaches the ins and outs of many of the game’s characters and mechanics, means there’s a ton of enjoyment to be had no matter one’s skill level.\n\nStreet Fighter 6 - Announce Trailer\n\nNBA 2K24\n\n64%\n\nPlatforms\n\nPC (Microsoft Windows), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nGenre\n\nSimulator, Sport\n\nDeveloper\n\nVisual Concepts\n\nPublisher\n\n2K\n\nRelease\n\nSeptember 08, 2023\n\nEach sports game brings something special to the table, but NBA 2K24 might be the most full-featured sports simulation out there. The game will always be basketball, but there are so many modes and options to make this game feel endless. You have the MyCAREER mode where you take your custom character through their own path in the NBA, the MyTEAM system that will scratch your old basketball card collecting itch, and MyNBA, which lets you replay some of the most iconic games in the history of the sport. With both the NBA and WNBA included, this is the only basketball game you need on PS5.\n\nNBA 2K24 | Official Gameplay Trailer\n\nSam Hill is a journalist and the gaming guides editor at Digital Trends.
