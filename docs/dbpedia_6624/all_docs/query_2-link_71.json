        "text": "The past year was an incredible one for video games, offering everything from predictable blockbusters to some very big surprises. We immersed ourselves in adventures like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, braved the horrors of Diablo IV, thrilled to amazing remakes like Dead Space and Resident Evil 4, and enjoyed the astonishing, fun-for-all-ages Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Here are the games to which we lost hours and hours in the past year—we think you’ll love them, too.\n\nHi-Fi Rush\n\nRated T; PC, Xbox Series X|S\n\nThe bright, animated, music-fueled action of Hi-Fi Rush makes it one of the buzziest games of 2023. Upon its surprise release at the end of January, it received universal praise for its brilliant anime-inspired visuals and traditional action gameplay interwoven with a soundtrack that literally drives everything: Platforms and the world move to the music, the main character snaps to the beat, and everything attacks according to the time signature. If you manage to time your attacks to the beat, you do more damage and earn better ratings, but no matter what, everything you do keeps in time to the music. The result is a game that’s both fun and sonically satisfying in a way few games are, and it’s a visual treat, too.\n\nMetroid Prime Remastered\n\nRated T; Nintendo Switch\n\nMetroid Prime fans have been waiting (and waiting …) for Metroid Prime 4 since its announcement in 2017. But in the meantime, Nintendo and developer Retro Studios are giving players both old and new a chance to play a significantly improved version of the 2002 original with the release of Metroid Prime Remastered. The Remastered edition’s most obvious improvement is its majorly overhauled visuals, which bring things largely in line with what modern players expect from the Nintendo Switch. But the biggest change is the addition of dual analog control options, a major shift from the single-stick, lock-on control scheme of the original release. Metroid Prime was always a better adventure and exploration game than a shooter, and despite the new control scheme in the Remastered version, that hasn’t changed. But this is still one of the more iconic, lesser-played gems of Nintendo’s early-’00s library, and the $40 price tag is very reasonable.\n\nFire Emblem Engage\n\nRated T; Nintendo Switch\n\nFire Emblem Engage is a turn-based strategy game that focuses on its deep, intricate combat system more than on its plot, which is formulaic and fairly predictable. Luckily, Fire Emblem’s plot has always been tangential to the gameplay, which in this installment is the best that fans have gotten in years. The turn-based battles take place on large grids, and on player and enemy turns the units move around the map like chess pieces. Each type of unit has strengths and weaknesses to exploit. Engage also adds an impressive amount of complexity to the optimization of each character, across a wide menu of class options for any character, upgradable weapons, and the assignment of Emblem Rings, which hold the souls of past Fire Emblem heroes and give any character access to new abilities and better stats. We wouldn’t recommend it as the first game to try in the series unless you’re a serious strategy-game nerd. But if you are that nerd, Engage is a must-play.\n\nDead Space (2023)\n\nRated M; PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nThe original Dead Space terrified players with its horrifying combination of Aliens and 28 Days Later influences set within the survival-horror gameplay of classics like Resident Evil 4. Now, remade with modern technology, Dead Space feels even more vital, interesting, and fun. It puts players in the role of space engineer Isaac Clarke as he travels with a rescue team to find the deep-space mining ship USS Ishimura. But Clarke and his team find the Ishimura overrun by horrific necromorphs—transformed and mutated crew members that Clarke can stop only by cutting them to pieces using makeshift engineering tools like the Plasma Cutter and the saw-firing Ripper. The remade Dead Space is often stunning, frequently scary, and always fun—if you have the heart and the stomach for its graphic horror violence and frequent scares.\n\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty\n\nRated M; PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S\n\nIf you enjoyed Dark Souls (or disliked it) and thought it would be better with much faster combat and a Later Han Dynasty setting (think the Three Kingdoms), Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty deserves your attention. Wo Long’s Chinese-fantasy trappings set it apart from Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and even Wo Long developer Team Ninja’s recent Nioh games, and the soap-opera-tinged story starts things off with appropriate melodrama. But the real difference here lies in Wo Long’s combat and movement: Both allow for far greater speed and maneuverability than we’re accustomed to seeing in games like this. Over-committing to attacks or ignoring your surroundings is still brutally punished for the most part, but aggression is rewarded in Wo Long in a way that encouraged us to push ourselves against our opponents. Like the Souls games, Wo Long supports cooperative multiplayer, and it even frequently pairs you with an AI-controlled companion when you’re playing solo. This is great news, because Wo Long is often pretty punishing.\n\nLike a Dragon: Ishin!\n\nRated M; PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S\n\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! is technically a remake of a 2014 game, but the original was released only in Japan as an obscure entry in the acclaimed series known as Yakuza in the West. Set at the end of the Edo period and the twilight of the samurai class, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is an action-RPG that follows main character Ryoma, a ronin who seeks to solve a murder mystery by pursuing the practitioners of a specific style of swordsmanship. The game’s strange yet delightful simulation elements depict a ronin’s life as both bloody and wonderfully mundane, and it’s unlike anything we’ve ever played. One moment, Ryoma was brawling with bandits on the street, dancing around enemies with a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other. Shortly after, he was chopping wood for the elderly, moonlighting as a geography teacher, or running a farm. It’s easy to get lost in the copious side quests and minigames that bring this Japanese society to life, and when we weren’t goofing off in town, Like a Dragon: Ishin! had one of the most captivating storylines we’d played through in a while—though it did require sitting through some very long cutscenes.\n\nDredge\n\nRated E; PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S\n\nDredge is a laid-back, cozy fishing adventure—until you get to the part about the Lovecraftian nightmares. Developer Black Salt Games takes a pretty competent fishing-boat game complete with markets, an economy, and upgrades, and mixes in the deep-sea horrors of Cthulhu. Dredge grabbed us harder than we’d expected. While the controls are a little finicky, and the goals can be opaque on occasion, the desire to pursue more upgrades and new fish types mixes well with the threat of supernatural terrors waiting for unwitting sailors who venture where they shouldn’t, looking for secrets that should stay buried. And despite how the game might look, it’s not an endless exercise in fishing with bits of story—most players will take 10 to 12 hours to see the horrors Dredge has to offer.\n\nHave a Nice Death\n\nRated T; PC, Switch\n\nHave a Nice Death stars the Grim Reaper himself as he seeks to retake control of the most diabolical hell you can think of: a giant office bureaucracy of the damned. It’s a cute conceit, and it’s paired with an absolutely beautiful hand-drawn and hand-animated black-and-white aesthetic and a distinctive sense of humor—think The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy combined with the work of Edward Gorey. But Have a Nice Death is actually a challenging roguelike action platformer where you must dash past enemy attacks and defeat the unruly denizens of Death Inc. with a variety of setting-appropriate weapons, including a whole host of scythes, along with some cloak-oriented magical abilities. Thankfully, developer Magic Design Studios has included a difficulty setting to make things a little more approachable for people who don’t like a painful challenge.\n\nResident Evil 4 (Remake)\n\nRated M; PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nResident Evil 4 revolutionized both action games and horror games back in 2005, and now it’s back with the same remake treatment that developer Capcom has given to the other mainline Resident Evil titles. The results are fantastic, with gorgeous redone visuals, a fleshed-out story and characters, and some big surprises in store for fans who have played and replayed the original release on numerous other systems. The game plays with modern-feeling controls and side quests and goals that tie more directly into Resident Evil 4’s systems and progression. But be ready for a challenge—and some pretty graphic violence to go along with that M rating.\n\nDead Cells: Return to Castlevania\n\nRated T; PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S\n\nThe latest Dead Cells expansion, Return to Castlevania, dragged us in again. Dead Cells and its rewarding gameplay loop—try, learn, die, repeat—have received a stream of major updates since it launched nearly five years ago, and the latest crossover involves the legendary Castlevania series, which inspired many indie hits, including Dead Cells. The Return to Castlevania expansion adds a bangin’ new soundtrack, atmospheric new areas to explore, iconic bosses to fight, and more unique items that add a fun gameplay twist, including Death’s scythe and a spell that summons a swarm of bats. We finally fought through hordes of skeletons and werewolves to reach the big bad himself (that’s Dracula), who immediately melted us with that very same swarm of bats. Guess we’ll just have to keep trying.\n\nTerra Nil\n\nRated E; PC, Mac, Linux\n\nAt first Terra Nil looks like plenty of other strategy games, but in reality it inverts the inherently colonial nature of society/city builders completely. Set on a ruined planet, Terra Nil charges you with building the tools to undo an ecological collapse wrought by humans, to reintroduce a sustainable amount of biodiversity and climate to the region, and then, ultimately, to remove all traces indicating that you were ever there at all. You have a finite pool of resources to build with, and you can gain more only by efficiently utilizing the space around you. This restriction leads to what is essentially a puzzle-like set of challenges, and if you don’t rehab the space around you well enough, you may just have to restart the map you’re on. Despite that added bit of stress, Terra Nil is a remarkably chill way to play in the world-building genre without having to invest in an economics degree to keep track of everything.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\n\nRated E; Nintendo Switch\n\nIf you use social media at all, we probably don’t need to tell you much about The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. This title builds on the giant open world full of exploration and experimentation that 2017’s Breath of the Wild brought to The Legend of Zelda by introducing a powerful building system. This system lets you combine weapons into new tools and to attach ingredients to your arrows for wild new effects, and it allows you to construct vehicles of many, many shapes, sizes, and uses. Tears of the Kingdom also brings the problem-solving inventiveness of games such as Minecraft and Fortnite to Zelda, to always-surprising effect. The result is frequently impressive if not always predictable, but there’s also a Zelda game here, with a sweeping story that remixes and refines the themes and story beats that the series has become known for. After around 40 hours with the game, we were still only scratching the surface, as we were constantly pulled between progressing the story and clumsily attempting to get our Hylian degree in mechanical engineering.\n\nWarhammer 40K: Boltgun\n\nRated M; PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nIf you haven’t kept up on the past several years of PC games, Warhammer 40K: Boltgun might look kind of, well, old. But that’s the point. Boltgun takes the grim, ridiculous space fantasy of the Warhammer 40K universe—which is full of galaxy-spanning orc hordes, brutal holy warriors, and pestilence-spewing alien swarms—and throws it back to ’90s-era shooters, à la the original Doom and Duke Nukem 3D. This concept is now common enough in game development to have a name, the “boomer shooter,” a hilariously evocative and appropriate moniker. These are games that feel like how players remember ’90s shooters: loud, chunky, violent, and straightforward. They were also accessible and a lot of fun, which perfectly sums up Boltgun. It’s outlandishly, cartoonishly graphic but also stylish, hilarious, and full of in-jokes for people who might have grown up playing games that looked a lot like this.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\nRated T; PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nA sequel to 2019’s hit Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is set five years after the original (and around the same time as the Disney+ show Obi-Wan Kenobi). This title takes the exploration and action of the previous game and expands it in every direction for a graphically stunning showpiece for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Survivor is the rare sequel that starts you off with every ability from the prior game and adds from there, which helps it create new puzzle and combat experiences to complement what the previous game built. It has great characters, an interesting story, and a huge world (galaxy?) to explore, and it’s an expansive, incredible Star Wars experience.\n\nDead Island 2\n\nRated M; PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S\n\nWe’ll get this out of the way first: Dead Island 2 is really, really gross. Developer Dambuster Studios went so far as to give its bespoke “dismemberment tech” a cute acronym: FLESH, which stands for Fully Locational Evisceration System for Humanoids. It’s an apt description of what you’re seeing and doing in the game. Dead Island 2 is an action RPG that doesn’t quite offer an open world but is full of big spaces in an earthquake-ravaged Los Angeles that also happens to be in the middle of a nightmarish zombie outbreak, and it fully commits to the mayhem that premise suggests. You do some pretty horrible things to the undead here, using an escalating collection of weapons that you can modify with more and more outrageous upgrades, from electricity to, well, explosions. Dead Island 2 isn’t for the weak of stomach, and it’s absolutely not appropriate to play in front of young children or squeamish partners or roommates, but it’s a great-looking, consistently fun zombie playground.\n\nOctopath Traveler II\n\nRated T; Steam, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch\n\nWe weren’t sure about Octopath Traveler II initially. The first entry in the series disappointed with uninspired characters and a barren plot that we spent hours in, waiting for it to get good (it never did). But Octopath Traveler II takes everything that was actually great about the original and turns it up a notch, offering engaging turn-based combat with layers of strategy, beautiful environments to explore, and one of the best video game soundtracks out there. And at some point in the last few hours of gameplay, we realized that it didn’t matter whether the dialogue was cheesy or whether the plot culminated in some grand fight for the fate of the world—we were just enjoying the vibes. Octopath Traveler II is about the journey, not the destination.\n\nAdvance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp\n\nRated E; Nintendo Switch\n\nAdvance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp is an enjoyable remake of the first two Advance Wars games, scaled up for HD graphics and smoother playing than the originals offered on the Game Boy Advance. This turn-based tactical-warfare game offers rock-paper-scissors gameplay involving soldiers, aircraft, and tanks; you also build up strategic reserves of troops and resources during a session, and you use commanding-officer powers, which give either team temporary advantages such as added movement points, bolder defenses, or stronger attacks. Online multiplayer is limited to people on your friends list, but you can play up to three other opponents in local battles over Wi-Fi. Options for building and sharing your own maps, three levels of difficulty, interstitials with fun animation and voice acting, and a varied collection of quick-play maps add to the game’s replayability.\n\nSystem Shock 2\n\nRated M; PC, PS5 (announced), Xbox Series X|S (announced)\n\nSystem Shock’s 1994 PC release sold only modestly well, but it would prove to be one of the most influential first-person games of all time, directly inspiring (and employing some of the creative leads of) games like BioShock, Deus Ex, 2017’s Prey, and countless other games. Set on a space station enslaved by a rogue AI and overrun by robots, mutants, and cyborgs, this “immersive simulation” game—designed to allow open-ended problem solving and gameplay decisions within a first-person shooter shell—has been in remake development hell for years. But the new version is finally here, and while it’s been remade in modern tech, this updated System Shock’s design and trappings are gloriously rooted in the ’90s, complete with “edgy” cyberpunk aesthetics and weird, creative gameplay possibilities that manage to feel fresh almost 30 years later.\n\nStreet Fighter 6\n\nRated T; PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S (out now)\n\nPlaying Street Fighter 6 left us feeling transported back to a ’90s laundromat, pumping quarters into the most exciting game a generation of kids had ever seen. A new, simplified set of controls lets more casual players perform the series’ tricky special moves via single button presses, which means new players can keep up with expert players (though dedicated fans shouldn’t worry—you can stick with the classic controls). Street Fighter 6 also includes an open-world-inspired adventure mode that lets you create and fully customize just about any kind of fighter you can imagine. You then take your created challenger into Metro City, where you challenge other fighters, meet the Street Fighter cast and study their techniques, and unravel a growing mystery. But the real stars of the show are the characters, which are as diverse and cool as in any entry in the series since the second installment wowed the world more than 30 years ago. This is the best Street Fighter has felt in decades, and it plays great with either a controller or a fighting stick. It’s stylish and fun, top to bottom.\n\nDiablo IV\n\nRated M; PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S\n\nIt’s been a long 10 years since Diablo III hit PCs, and the classic action-RPG franchise has returned to form. Diablo IV brings the influential series fully into the modern era, with a heavier emphasis on story (including cutscenes featuring your custom character) and a sweeping, beautiful, and often haunting soundtrack. Deceptively simple to play, Diablo IV has you select from five different character classes—the melee-focused barbarian, the ranged-magic sorcerer, the undead-army-summoning necromancer, the shape-shifting druid, and the shadow-dwelling, bow-wielding rogue—each of which have their own abilities and class-specific tools and treasures. You make your way through the world of Sanctuary as you seek to stop Lilith, a demonic goddess with a dark plan. To interact with the world, you merely click with your mouse, whether you’re opening a chest or a door, crawling into a cave, entering a dungeon, or smashing a skeleton to pieces, but things expand from there. And this is the first Diablo game to be designed from the start for playing on a controller, which works amazingly well, even on PC.\n\nFinal Fantasy XVI\n\nRated M; PlayStation 5\n\nLet’s get this out of the way first: The PlayStation 5–exclusive Final Fantasy XVI is a big departure from one of the most popular and influential game franchises of all time. To be fair, many of the elements that have made Final Fantasy an international institution—the beautifully designed characters, the high drama, the sweeping soundtrack—are still present. But Final Fantasy XVI is also heavily influenced by Game of Thrones, as it has a new, darker tone that involves profanity and graphic violence.\n\nBut the bigger change lies in how it plays—rather than asking you to control a party of adventurers, or even loosely coordinating them, Final Fantasy XVI’s gameplay is entirely oriented around controlling and outfitting a single character, game protagonist Clive. And continuing the evolution of the series, the action is no longer turn-based, instead reflecting an active combat resembling that of games like the recent God of War revival. Still, Final Fantasy’s DNA is here. Final Fantasy XVI is suitably epic, the characters are interesting, the magic is breathtaking, and the combat is fun.\n\nOxenfree II\n\nRated T; PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, mobile via Netflix\n\nOxenfree II’s charming illustration style, which evokes 2D adventure games from the ’80s and ’90s, belies a story that exists somewhere between Stranger Things and a thoughtful John Hughes coming-of-age story. Lead character Riley returns to her island hometown to take a job investigating strange phenomena, and what she finds is a mystery that could be the plot of a David Lynch movie, complete with an abandoned island, mysterious radio signals, and a protagonist with a melancholic past. Oxenfree II is on PlayStation, Switch, and PC, but it’s also the first original game from Netflix, so you can download it via the Netflix app for iOS or Android for free with your subscription. You can learn more about Oxenfree II in our review.\n\nPikmin 4\n\nRated E; Nintendo Switch\n\nNintendo’s Pikmin 4 is the kind of game we haven’t seen a lot of over the past year: something safe for kids that doesn’t feel too simple for adults. It’s silly and full of friendly characters, and its small-scale perspective lends some childlike wonder to every object, from screwdrivers to plant pots to classic Game Boy consoles—but it also has jokes about management culture and scientific mishaps for the grown-ups. It’s an action puzzle game where you direct a helpful species of plant-like humanoids named Pikmin, who aid in repairing your ship and finding your lost rescue crew. Plus, Pikmin 4 adds the truly adorable Oatchi, an alien rescue pup. The game’s only real stumbling block is a slow start, as the first several hours are especially tutorial-loaded. But Pikmin 4 is a big game full of fun stuff that parents and kids can enjoy together.\n\nRemnant 2\n\nRated M; PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nWhereas its predecessor, Remnant: From the Ashes, was a minor hit in 2019, Remnant 2 generated a ton of buzz and sales upon its release, with more than a million players buying the game in its first four days on sale. Plus, now it’s on Game Pass for Xbox and PC. Remnant 2 blends the methodical, action-RPG style of games like Dark Souls with third-person shooters, and it drops everything into a world full of secrets and wild possibilities. While the gameplay is fun and the visuals are great, Remnant 2’s coolest feature is its unpredictability: After a brief tutorial, the world you start in (and where you start in it) is randomly selected, and you may find secrets that a friend playing in the same level never does. The sense of discovery and community around discovering Remnant 2’s secrets is its biggest asset, but take your time and be careful—it’s dangerous out there.\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3\n\nRated M; PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\n\nIf you’ve been craving an epic fantasy adventure where you can save the realms, find legendary treasures and villains, romance your companions, and, well, roll around as a big block of cheese for a while, your hopes and dreams are answered. Baldur’s Gate 3 continues the legendary PC RPG series based on the Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms setting and has already generated years of buzz after an extended period of early access. The buzz is well earned—Baldur’s Gate 3 is a huge game with an enormous amount of freedom and possibilities, along with an epic story and plenty of interesting characters to meet (and romance). Plus, you can play with up to three friends, and there’s split-screen cooperative play.\n\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon\n\nRated T: PC, Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nIt may have “VI” in the title, but we promise that you don’t need to have played any of Armored Core VI’s predecessors to understand or have fun with this tactical, fast-paced action game. Armored Core VI puts you behind the controls of a giant robot suit in a colony world full of even larger dangers—we’re talking skyscraper-sized enemies and mechanical terrors the size of small cities. To deal with those challenges, Armored Core VI gives you free rein over the shape of your robotic body. You can swap out different weapons, arms, heads, bodies, and even legs. That last option can dramatically alter the way the game plays: Digitigrade (meaning, well, chicken-style) legs allow for fast running and huge jumps, standard bipedal legs are more generally maneuverable, and tank treads turn you into a rolling weapons platform on the ground. Add to that an easy-to-grasp-but-difficult-to-master aerial-combat component, and Armored Core VI provides a fast-paced, dynamic, especially fun bit of mech combat that rewards experimentation. And it’s also available on last-generation consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nStarfield\n\nRated M; PC, Xbox Series X|S\n\nThe first game in eight years from the developer behind The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4 finally made its debut in 2023. Starfield takes the foundation that developer Bethesda Game Studios established in Skyrim and Fallout and expands it in every direction, with customizable spaceships, a rotating cast of characters, a mystery involving alien technology, and a thousand planets to explore. Starfield features gameplay that mixes the skill selection and leveling up of an RPG with the action of a first-person shooter and sets it against the backdrop of a beautiful, often terrifying vision of space that feels both familiar and tantalizingly full of surprise. Oh, and you can build platypus-shaped spaceships.\n\nThe Crew Motorfest\n\nRated E; Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC\n\nThe Crew Motorfest is an open, island-spanning car festival full of spontaneous challenges and organized races alike. If that premise sounds familiar, it’s probably because you’ve played titles in the hit Forza Horizon series, and to be honest, we’d be hard-pressed to describe any meaningful differences. That’s not a bad thing—the next Forza Horizon game is years away. The Crew Motorfest sets you loose to explore and advance as you see fit in a beautiful Hawaiian setting, with a wide variety of car types—from old-school vans and roadsters with no GPS or navigation all the way up to futuristic supercars—to enjoy. It’s pretty, the racing is fun, and you have a lot to dig into here.\n\nMortal Kombat 1\n\nRated M; PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC\n\nThe Mortal Kombat games have set the modern standard for fun, full-featured single-player experiences in addition to the one-on-one fighting that the genre is known for—assuming that you’re cool with a lot of wildly over-the-top graphic violence. Mortal Kombat 1 (named because it involves a complete reset of the series’s timeline and characters) brings 30 years of history to bear with reimaginings of the cast as well as so-called Kameo fighters, tag-team assistants that include hilariously faithful re-creations of old friends and foes. If you’re planning on playing alone, Mortal Kombat 1 has you covered and then some, with a single-player Kampaign that essentially unfolds as a deliriously over-the-top, pulpy, fantastic martial arts epic—including a conclusion that is so wildly beyond anything the series has done before, it practically begs to be replayed again and again. In a year full of amazing competitive fighters, Mortal Kombat 1 makes a strong case as the people’s fighting game, and players with the stomach for it will find something pretty special here.\n\nLies of P\n\nRated M; Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nLies of P is one of 2023’s dark horses, a game that seemingly came out of nowhere to get people excited (a lengthy demo that released in June probably helped). Lies of P takes the methodical, punishing action role-playing style of games like Dark Souls and Elden Ring and places it within a dark, magical, steampunk reimagining of the Pinocchio fairy tale, complete with a blue fairy and many, many diabolical puppets. It takes full advantage of the Victorian dystopia of its premise and spirals out from there, leading to something that pulls in the best bits of its inspirations. It’s very fun, very rewarding, and honestly kind of hard. It isn’t for everyone, but you can try the game for yourself via the previously released demo, and conveniently, this game is another Xbox Game Pass release.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\n\nRated M; Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC\n\nCyberpunk 2077 was the most anticipated game of 2020, but after multiple delays, its arrival was accompanied by a pile of technical problems and a game that wasn’t what everyone expected from the team behind The Witcher 3 and its expansions. However, with the release of Cyberpunk 2077’s first and only expansion, Phantom Liberty, developer CDProjekt seems to have delivered on just about everything it promised and then some. All Cyberpunk 2077 owners (on PC, Xbox Series X and S, and PlayStation 5, anyway) will get the major graphical improvements and complete overhaul of the game’s role-playing game skills and systems. But Phantom Liberty’s political conspiracy involving the president and a secret agent played by Idris Elba is exactly the kind of story addition that Cyberpunk 2077 deserves. It’s a dystopic, Blade Runner–esque future not afraid to have some fun with itself, with amazing and terrifying cybernetic augmentations and abilities to go with its gun-based combat. But bad news for Xbox One and PS4 players: Phantom Liberty isn’t available on older consoles.\n\nForza Motorsport\n\nRated E: Xbox Series X|S, PC\n\nRather than immediately placing you in the cockpit of a million-dollar supercar, Forza Motorsport has you take a cool but earthbound car, race it, upgrade it, and build a relationship with it. In an annoyingly effective bit of marketing terminology, developer Turn 10 is calling the game a “CaRPG.” Still, the term succinctly explains what Forza Motorsport is doing: As you race, you receive points based on how well you take turns, how you deal with crowds of other drivers on the track, and just about everything else you can think of, and your score at the end contributes to leveling up the car you’re driving. That in turn gives you access to better parts and more demanding races. Most important, Forza Motorsport is a lot of fun to drive, with an especially responsive physics model that makes even the slightest tweaks to your car’s tire pressure or suspension yield real results on the track, if you decide to go that way. It’s also gorgeous, and it’s on Game Pass.\n\nSonic Superstars\n\nRated E; PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC\n\nSonic the Hedgehog is having a moment—which you’ve probably realized if you have kids who’ve forced you to watch either of the two recent Sonic movies and put the new series on your list—and Sonic Superstars is taking advantage of it. Superstars features a cast of characters familiar to longtime fans in 2D side-scrolling levels that evoke Sonic’s 16-bit era, albeit with the addition of local cooperative play for up to four players. Each character has their own abilities, from Tails’s helicopter-like flight to Knuckles’s climbing and gliding to Amy’s hammer and double jump, which should lead to some fairly goofy co-op possibilities. In our time with the game, it felt about how we expected a Sonic game to feel, which in our case was mostly a good thing—and every level hides enough secrets to warrant repeated play-throughs.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder\n\nRated E; Nintendo Switch\n\nIt’s been more than a decade since we’ve seen a genuinely new take on the classic, two-dimensional Super Mario Bros. formula, but Nintendo has made it worth the wait. Super Mario Bros. Wonder adds online play to the four-player formula it established with New Super Mario Bros back on the Wii. It also adds absolute chaos to the mix by moving the setting to the bizarre and unstable Flower Kingdom, where chaos seeds will often completely change the levels you’re playing in and the characters you’re controlling. Nintendo has been on a hot streak over the past year, but Super Mario Bros. Wonder still stands apart—it’s weird, relentlessly inventive, and often laugh-out-loud funny, adding up to one of the best games of 2023.\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2\n\nRated T; PlayStation 5\n\nThe full sequel to one of the best superhero games of all time does not disappoint. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 lets you play as both Miles Morales and Peter Parker as Spider-Man, and they each have their own unique combat abilities that are a blast to master. The open-world rendition of New York City expands from the first game’s Manhattan focus to include Queens and Brooklyn, and it’s endlessly fun to traverse thanks to the most satisfying web-shooting and wall-crawling mechanics of any Spider-Man game. It’s also approachable for all skill levels thanks to basic controls that are introduced gradually. You don’t have to be familiar with the previous games to enjoy the latest entry, but we still recommend them—they’re brilliant, they’re less expensive these days, and they still play beautifully.\n\nDave the Diver\n\nRated E10+; Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac\n\nIn Dave the Diver, you play as the titular Dave, an ordinary guy whose relaxing beach vacation is cut short when he gets invited out to sushi with a friend—only to learn he must go and catch the seafood himself. When Dave begrudgingly accepts the errand, his friends take this as a sign to throw him into restaurant management. (You know, the natural course of action.) This game is engaging yet cozy, and it weaves mechanics that feel more akin to what you’d find in a traditional action-adventure game with restaurant-simulation elements. It’s also a great option if you don’t have access to a fancy gaming rig or console, thanks to its gentle system requirements.\n\nAlan Wake 2\n\nRated M; Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC\n\nImagine a supernatural murder mystery drawing equally from Stephen King’s ’80s-era horror, David Lynch’s Twin Peaks, and network procedurals like Criminal Minds, and then throw all that into a third-person action-horror framework reminiscent of Resident Evil. What you get is Alan Wake 2. This title is set 13 years after its predecessor, but you don’t need to have played the original to understand what’s happening here. Co-protagonist and FBI agent Saga Anderson seeks to unravel the supernatural murder mystery in front of her while determining just what role the long-missing horror novelist Alan Wake has to do with it. Alan Wake 2 has proven to be one of the past year’s biggest critical darlings, and we’ve had plenty of fun with it, but if you’ve ever gotten stuck on more eccentric puzzle games, you might want to keep Google handy to get you unstuck every now and then.\n\nJusant\n\nRated E; Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC\n\nJusant is a beautiful, often haunting action puzzle game that puts you in the climbing gear of a nameless explorer seeking to find a lost society as a brutal sun burns away all of the mysterious planet’s water. There’s more than just climate anxiety here, thankfully. There’s a lot of wonder and whimsy in the environments you attempt to climb, and the unique control scheme—you pull the appropriate triggers on either side of the controller to grab a handhold with the corresponding hand in-game—went a long way toward drawing us in to Jusant’s world and story. And at around six hours or so of playtime, Jusant won’t demand more than a couple of your afternoons to see it through, which makes it the perfect palate cleanser, especially if you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, where it launched on its release day.\n\nSuper Mario RPG (2023)\n\nRated E; Nintendo Switch\n\nSuper Mario RPG was the plumber and friends’ first foray into turn-based, story-driven role playing. The result was an always goofy and always interesting blend of Mario mechanics and Final Fantasy-style gameplay, with a surprisingly epic story and plenty of brand-new characters and companions. This new version is absolutely gorgeous and still very funny, judging from our time with the game so far, and it has some much-appreciated quality-of-life improvements over the 1996 release that make it a painless way to experience one of the Super Nintendo’s weirder classic games. Though you’ll find plenty of reading here, this game still might be a great choice for a younger child’s first RPG—or a great opportunity for lapsed RPG fans to dip their toe back into this kind of game.\n\nThis article was edited by Caitlin McGarry."
