        "text": "We’re still making it through 2023 and a surprising number of games have already been killed off, as devs have announced their impending deaths. Normally, we’d reserve this list for the end-of-the-year round-up, but we’re ringing the death knell early because, with 15 games already lined up for public execution, we need to start paying our respects now. So, let’s get right into it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 03/08/2023 6:30 p.m. ET: We’ve added 12 more games to this article that have already been taken offline, will no longer receive updates, and/or are scheduled to be delisted in the near future. This brings our total number of dead or soon-to-expire games to a whopping 27. That’s a lot of death.\n\nUpdate 05/03/2023 5:35 p.m. ET: Another couple of months have gone by, which means we’ve updated this story with another crop of games that have unceremoniously died in some way, shape, or form. This time, we bring word of the untimely demise of an additional nine games. Pour one—or 36—out, folks.\n\nUpdate 06/09/2023 1 p.m. ET: Here we are again. A month later and we’re updating this story to include more games that have been laid to rest in some capacity. RIP to these seven games. Our total’s now 43. Y’all will be missed.\n\nUpdate 08/04/2023 2:15 p.m. ET: It’s been about two months since we last updated this article, and 11 more games have croaked in the interim. Now, our total of games that died in 2023 is up to 54. Wow, we’re getting close to 100.\n\nUpdate 11/28/2023 4:45 p.m. ET: Just like that, three months have come and gone. A lot has happened in that interval—specifically, a lot of games have been taken offline forever, so we figured it was high time to update this list of games that met their ends in 2023. Before we were at 54 dead games. Today we added six more, pushing the total to 60. Is 2023 over yet?\n\nDreams, PlayStation’s ambitious game-creation toolkit, will no longer receive regular updates after September 1, developer Media Molecule announced in an April 11 blog post. This doesn’t necessarily mean the game is dead. The studio confirmed that Dreams will remain playable after September 1, with folks still able to make and share their creations in the game for the foreseeable future. However, Media Molecule clarified that it wants to put its energy into “an exciting new project” that has yet to be disclosed. As such, new events and updates for Dreams are over, and a May 22 server migration will limit storage for in-game content to just 5GB, which will effectively make preserving files a hassle as you’ll need to be intentional about what you save. This is especially true since Media Molecule is removing Dream’s archival feature as well. Here’s a detailed breakdown of everything that’s changing in Dreams. It may linger for a time, but I’m thinking it’s time to pour one out for Sony’s fanciful creation toolkit.\n\nDid you know there was a virtual reality Nerf game? It sounds vaguely familiar to me, but I certainly didn’t know it was already delisted from the Meta Quest store. According to a blog post about the future of the competitive multiplayer FPS Nerf Ultimate Championship, the Oculus Quest exclusive was removed from the digital storefront on March 1. Sorry new Quest owners, but you can’t buy it now. Not that you’d want to anyway as once August 31 passes, Nerf Ultimate Championship will get taken offline and no longer launch on the VR headset. This is primarily because the developer, Secret Location, is shutting down and “will no longer have resources to continue supporting the game.” So, for those who happen to still own it, you’ve got a few more months to shoot some VR Nerf guns.\n\nThis only hurts PlayStation players, but it’s still disappointing to see all the same. Sony announced on February 1 that the PlayStation Plus Collection, a catalog of 19 of the company’s top-tier games (like Bloodborne and God of War), will no longer be offered come May 9. It’s not as if these games will get yanked offline; you can still purchase them from the PlayStation store, and if you’ve already downloaded them, they will remain accessible in your library. It’s just that all of them won’t come folded into the neat package that is PlayStation Plus anymore. By subscribing for a handful of dollars a month, you could download any of these games. But soon, you’ll have to buy them individually, which could run your wallet anywhere from $20-$60 depending on the game. That’s the bummer here. Sony had something good in this introductory collection that acclimates new PS5 owners to the company’s pedigree of developers. Unfortunately, that idea will be killed come early May.\n\nAnother game that has already been quietly killed off, LizardFactory’s Among Us-like multiplayer RPG Wolflord - Werewolf Online is no longer available on the Steam store. In a rather heartbreaking update, the developer said that due to “health problems, mental problems, and financial problems,” the game became a rock that was “too heavy [to] keep pulling.” LizardFactory cited other issues with Wolflord - Werewolf Online’s development that made the project no longer viable as well, including “interpersonal problems” such as the need to recruit new players and prevent community toxicity. Folks seeking refunds should be able to get them, and the studio has “arranged with the new owners” to ensure that current players will get into the new version of the game, whatever form that takes. Unfortunately, it’s also entirely possible that whoever the new Wolflords are will shelve the IP for good, as it won’t be in LizardFactory’s hands anymore.\n\nIt hasn’t been a great start to the year for battle royale games as yet another one, Proletariat’s free-to-play magic shooter Spellbreak, will shutter in “early 2023.” There isn’t an exact date on when the servers will get turned off, but company CEO Seth Sivak explained in a Reddit post that because the game was “not able to break through and reach a sustainable place,” Spellbreak’s development was no longer viable. On top of the unceremonious shutting down, the entirety of Proletariat was absorbed into Blizzard to support World of Warcraft’s development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s not lost on me that a lot of the entries on this list are free-to-play, games-as-a-service titles. I think that’s indicative of the state of the genre which has been dominated by other tentpole releases such as Apex Legends and Fortnite. There just aren’t enough hours in the day or players in the world to sustain so many live-service games when they’re developed to almost function like secondary jobs, replete with daily login bonuses and enough challenges to complete that you feel as if you’re clocking into a digital workplace after clocking out of your real workplace. It’s only the start of the year, though, so while a handful of games have already died, maybe the end of 2023 won’t look so bloody."
