When i start games in some bigger emulator like Playstation 1, PSP, Wii U they run just fine but I can’t able to quit the emulator with pressing esc button. I have to force shut down my pc to boot batocera again.\n\nAnyone knows how to quit running emulator and get back main screen of Batocera?\n\nAs Joinski said, use the built-in hotkeys on your controller.\n\nBut if you absolutely must use the keyboard, usually Alt + F4 works. Not all emulators respect this though, depending on the emulator (the reason to use a game pad in the first place…)."
