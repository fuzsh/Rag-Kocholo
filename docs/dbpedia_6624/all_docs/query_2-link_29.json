        "text": "Sony PlayStation\n\nOverview\n\nThe Sony PlayStation application is an emulator for the Sony PlayStation game console.\n\nDue to its high resource requirements, the following devices are minimally recommended for running this application:\n\nModern PC or Mac\n\niPhone 11 or iPad 9th Generation (or newer)\n\nXbox Series X|S gaming consoles\n\nNewer Android devices with a highly performant processor (high single core speed)\n\nAdding Games (Feed Editor)\n\nDue to large Disc image sizes, adding PlayStation games in the Feed Editor must be done manually (versus using auto-detection).\n\nSee the Disc and Archive-based Items section for the list of steps required to add a PlayStation game in the Feed Editor.\n\nBIOS Files\n\nIn addition to Sony PlayStation Disc images, a set of PlayStation BIOS files must be specified globally within the feed (See the Feed Properties Dialog and Sony PlayStation Feed Properties sections).\n\nThe BIOS files specified must be one of the following three sets:\n\nThe BIOS files originally used on the PlayStation 1.\n\nFile Hash (MD5) Description scph5500.bin 8dd7d5296a650fac7319bce665a6a53c PlayStation 1 Japan BIOS scph5501.bin 490f666e1afb15b7362b406ed1cea246 PlayStation 1 USA BIOS scph5502.bin 32736f17079d0b2b7024407c39bd3050 PlayStation 1 Europe BIOS\n\nThe PlayStation 1 BIOS file used on the PlayStation Portable.\n\nFile Hash (MD5) Description PSXONPSP660.bin c53ca5908936d412331790f4426c6c33 PlayStation Portable\n\nThe PlayStation 1 BIOS file used on the PlayStation 3.\n\nFile Hash (MD5) Description ps1_rom.bin 81bbe60ba7a3d1cea1d48c14cbcc647b PlayStation 3\n\nSettings\n\nThe Sony PlayStation Application includes a custom settings dialog.\n\nTo access these settings, display the \"Pause\" screen and select the \"PlayStation Settings\" option (See screenshot above).\n\nPlayStation Settings Tab (Session Only)\n\nThe PlayStation Application's \"settings\" tab is detailed below. It is important to note that the settings on this tab are Session only meaning they will not persist between gaming sessions.\n\nField Description Analog mode Enables Analog mode on the PlayStation DualShock controller. Some games will automatically force this mode. However, this setting allows for forcing the controller into analog mode. Swap controllers (ports 1 and 2) Swaps controllers 1 and 2. This is necessary in some games as they require the use of both controller ports (even during a single player game). Reset Disc This resets the state of the CD that is currently mounted. This is only required if a game does not automatically support creating a game save prior to requesting a disc swap. In those particular cases, the only way to resume the game on the other disc is to do the following:\n\nPlay the game to the point where it requests a disc swap.\n\nCreate a save state at this point (requires cloud-storage to be enabled).\n\nExit out of the game and subsequently load the game with the requested disc.\n\nRestore the save state once the game is loaded.\n\nFinally, open the pause menu, and enable the \"Reset Disc\" option.\n\nAt this point, the game should continue.\n\nAdvanced Settings Tab\n\nThe PlayStation Application's \"advanced\" tab settings are detailed below.\n\nField Description GPU Resolution Controls the resolution to render each scene at internally.\n\nThis option will only affect 3D rendered items (not 2D). This improves the clarity of the visuals, primarily noticeable on larger screen resolutions.\n\nNOTE: This setting significantly increases the required resources, and will result in performance issues on a large number of devices.\n\nControls\n\nThe emulator supports up to four controllers. The keyboard and gamepad mappings are listed in the tables below.\n\nKeyboard\n\nKeyboard support is only available for controller one.\n\nName\n\nKeys\n\nComments D-pad Circle Cross Triangle Square L2 L1 R1 R2 Start Select The Right Shift Key. Show Pause Screen\n\nGamepad\n\nGamepad support is available for all controllers.\n\nName\n\nGamepad\n\nComments D-pad D-pad When Analog Mode disabled. Left analog When Analog Mode enabled. Right analog When Analog Mode enabled. Circle Cross Triangle Square L2 L1 R1 R2 Start Not available for Xbox and not recommended for iOS (see alternate)\n\nPress the Menu (Start) Button. Start\n\n(Alternate) and Hold down the Right Trigger and click (press down) on the Right Thumbstick. Select Not available for Xbox and not recommended for iOS (see alternate)\n\nPress the View (Back) Button. Select\n\n(Alternate) and Hold down the Right Trigger and click (press down) on the Left Thumbstick. Show Pause Screen and Not available for Xbox and not recommended for iOS (see alternate 3 or 4)\n\nHold down the Left Trigger and press the Menu (Start) Button. Show Pause Screen\n\n(Alternate) and Not available for Xbox and not recommended for iOS (see alternate 3 or 4)\n\nHold down the Left Trigger and press the View (Back) Button. Show Pause Screen\n\n(Alternate 2) and Not available for Xbox and not recommended for iOS (see alternate 3 or 4)\n\nHold down the X Button and press the View (Back) Button. Show Pause Screen\n\n(Alternate 3) and Hold down the Left Trigger and click (press down) on the Left Thumbstick. Show Pause Screen\n\n(Alternate 4) and Hold down the Left Trigger and click (press down) on the Right Thumbstick.\n\nMemory Card Storage\n\nThe PlayStation application supports preserving state from Memory Cards between sessions. This state is persisted in the browser's local storage or optionally to cloud-based storage. State information will be persisted whenever the pause screen is displayed (or the game is exited). Therefore, the pause screen should be displayed periodically to ensure the state is properly persisted.\n\nFeed\n\nThis section details how PlayStation application instances can be added to feeds.\n\nType\n\nThe type name for the PlayStation application is beetle-psx.\n\nFeed Properties\n\nThe table below contains global PlayStation feed properties. These properties must be specified in the props object of the feed's Feed Object.\n\nProperty Type Required Details\n\nItem Properties\n\nThe table below contains the properties that are specific to the PlayStation application. These properties are specified in the props object of a feed item.\n\nProperty Type Required Details uid String Yes\n\nA unique identifier for the particular game (must be unique across all PlayStation games).\n\nThis identifier is primarily used to associate persistent state with the game.\n\ndiscs Array of URLs Yes\n\nArray of URLs to one or more (for multi-disc games) PlayStation game discs.\n\nThe PlayStation application only supports .CHD and .PBP disc file formats (.ISO, .BIN, and .CUE are not supported).\n\nzoomLevel Numeric No A numeric value indicating how much the display image should be zoomed in (0-40).\n\nThis property is typically used to hide the black borders that are present on some PlayStation games. analog Boolean No Enables Analog mode on the PlayStation DualShock controller. Some games will automatically force this mode. However, this setting allows for forcing the controller into analog mode. multitap Boolean No Enables multi-tap functionality when enabled (4 controllers). skipBios Boolean No Skips the PlayStation BIOS animation that is displayed when starting a game. disableMemCard1 Boolean No Whether to disable the use of memory card 1 (memory card 0 will still be available).\n\nExample\n\nThe following is an example of a complete feed that consists of a single PlayStation application instance (type value of psx). The discs property value contains a URL that points to a Dropbox location that contains the excellent homebrew game Magic Castle by KAIGA. The uid property value contains a unique identifier for this specific game (must be unique across all PlayStation games).\n\nIt is also worth noting that the PlayStation BIOS locations (psx_bios) is specified globally within the Feed Object's props object.\n\nReferences"
