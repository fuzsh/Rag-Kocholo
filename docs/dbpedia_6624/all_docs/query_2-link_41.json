        "text": "But in 2022 Sony could easily have the highest end handheld. The biggest difference to Vita is that now they have a huge selection of PS4 games they could draw from to have handheld graphical showcases without breaking the bank. The time gap between PS2 and PSP wasn't that big, so now they would have the advantage of several more years to have that PS4 equivalent handheld.\n\nWasn't this how Vita was pitched? PS3 experiences on the go? Sure, the PS4 library as of 2022 is better in many ways but Sony has to bother porting it first. They ported everything to PS4 sooner than to Vita.\n\nAnd is there even a point? The Switch was about as high end a competitively priced portable could have been in 2017. The rumors surrounding the upcoming Switch model seem to suggest that Nintendo is continuing this approach. There wasn't room for Vita against the underpowered 3DS, so there's even (a lot) less room now.\n\nWhat's stopping it? I remember this discussion about a portable PS4 5 or 6 years ago. People were like, \"no. That won't be possible for 5 or 6 years.\"\n\nI do think it's pointless unless it can run digital PS4 games natively.\n\nA portable able to deliver a graphics experience on par with PS4 (for the price of a PS4) is something I think we can expect in a not so distant future. If not the \"New Switch\" (DLSS and all) then the one after that.\n\nActual PS4 hardware in portable form? No. A PS4 Slim consumes up to about 150W playing a game. The Switch maxes out at about 8W during a stress test with Breath of the Wild, max display brightness, and every wireless protcol turned on. Sony would have to reduce power consumption by about 95% while scaling down the physical size of the components. About one third of the Switch's volume (and most of its weight I would guess) is the battery.\n\nWasn't this how Vita was pitched? PS3 experiences on the go?

There wasn't room for Vita against the underpowered 3DS, so there's even (a lot) less room now.\n\nVita had a whole host of issues, one of them being that Sony tried to Nintendo it up with touchscreen gimmicks in Uncharted Golden Abyss, Near, and other me-too stuff like that. It was all over the place instead of focusing on Sony strengths. Because of that it didn't really get that \"PS3 on handheld\" vibe going.\n\nNow fast forward to the pandemic. Imagine if Sony still had a viable handheld when everybody was suddenly looking into COVID-19 safe entertainment, including handhelds. The early 2010s were bad timing for Vita, but the 2020s are obviously not the same as the 2010s anymore. We can't just look at the past and assume that everything will always be the same. Just because the Vita flopped, doesn't mean Sony couldn't find success with a new handheld.\n\nI think one of the fallacies here is that people think the answer is to take all of those console experiences that people know and love and port them to a handheld where people will love them more.\n\nI think in reality whilst some console games really do port well I dont think all of them do. Nintendo has a Knack for understanding handheld gaming holistically and I think this would be the approach Sony would need to take for a Vita 2 to work.\n\nBefore even thinking about the console if I was Sony I'd build (or repurpose) a few studios with the intention of making focussed handheld tests. Test the ideas and then figure out if the console is viable with the tested ideas.\n\nBut in the same way people would raise an eyebrow if Nintendo said they were going to pivot to single player, prestige story driven games (like Sony). Or focus on multiplayer online experiences (like major 3rd parties or MS) Sony pivoting to handheld would be them moving out of their comfort zone. It's not just a case of taking the console content and downsizing it, that only works sometimes.\n\nI hate putting it this way because I feel like it sounds bad, but I do not foresee it being much of a relevant competition to the switch whatsoever, it has to go through the same woes that the switch went through of building a market and proving that it does have a relevant market willing to buy games on, and first party support a plenty to make it different enough to compete in anyway. Sony cannot reliably compete as their target seems to be a different type. Nintendo seemingly shaped that half of the gaming coin (console space) in their favor and you can tell they are taking their sweet time with it and riding it. Entering the market would seem to be difficult.\n\nThat said I would love something that directly competes with Nintend's portable device in their bread and butter turf the, uh, portable market, has interesting offerings that aren't really like the switch or differentiate it enough from the switch and will be there day 1 in a heartbeat.\n\nDo it sony, the 7 of us will buy it, but do it\n\nDo it\n\nA modern APU from Intel or AMD can have similar power to vanilla PS4. Especially if we wait till next year's version.\n\nYou can look at GPD Win3, Aya Neo, and a few others. Issue is that they are $800+ and they barely run say Cyberpunk on 720p/low and dip below 30fps.\n\nAnd that still will need games ported.\n\nA lot of the price for those comes from them being low volume too, though. I can imagine a mass market version of the Aya Neo would be cheaper\n\nAnd didn't Cyberpunk run like that on a PS4 anyway? lol\n\nBut still, I don't see such a thing happening for Sony. I do see it for PC gaming though, especially once APU's get better. Or even once they start putting mobile GPUs on the things.\n\nI do think the best scenario would be a PS4 portable. Have it run all PS4 games digital only, and have it be a remote play device for PS5. It sells as a way to play last gen games which are still popular but also as an accessory to PS5. This may be possible on 7nm but maybe 5nm? I've seen some AMD APUs get close to PS4 level in a 10-25W package but that doesn't include ram.\n\nhow hard would be to port the basic PS4 OS, functionality to LP Ram? Like does it need to match the bandwidth at 180GB/s or could it be lower, like 50-100GB/s?\n\nI do wonder how energy efficient AMD could go if they made a PS5 APU but stripped down to match PS4. Like Zen, Navi, etc but 8 cores @1.6Ghz, 1.8 TFs, etc.\n\nanything else would probably require too much work so if that's not possible then I imagine it's not possible.\n\nI do wonder how energy efficient AMD could go if they made a PS5 APU but stripped down to match PS4. Like Zen, Navi, etc but 8 cores @1.6Ghz, 1.8 TFs, etc.\n\nSorry to dig this up, but in the wake of the Steam Deck, looking at the specs of this thing, it is basically a stripped-down PS5. It has the same Zen2 / RNDA2 architecture. In theory, it should be compatible out of the box, just with much lower performance.\n\nI would really like something like a PS5 portable, that just plays all the PS4 / PS5 games in my library, using the same cloud saves, just at 720p and some other minor downgrades.

Well I suppose they could in theory but it would be a biiiig handheld with nooo battery life\n\nfor ps cloud is their answer. Now xbox on the other hand absolutely should enter the handheld market and I think they will in the next 12-18 months. But I've made several threads on the matter and everyone thinks that's stupid so what do I know\n\nSo with switch selling like hotcakes and for 5 years straight it proves that handheld gaming is very much alive so what if sony enter the market again?\n\nBrand new PSP 2022, play all your ps4 games in 1080p 30fps and ps5 games in 720p 30fps for 399$. Format - Digital\n\nHow would it fare? Is it even technologically feasible? Will it affect Switch? Should this be purely portable or hybrid like switch\n\nTo answer the questions in order.\n\nIt would fare terribly in terms of sales, it would be very hard to produce and secure enough parts to produce it and convince publishers to develop titles for it.\n\nIt probably wouldn't affect the Switch at all.\n\nIf it were a hybrid it would bite into the PS5's sales which is something wouldn't want.\n\nAt this point streaming technology is reasonably good enough that people are coming around to the idea of using them instead of buying dedicated portable consoles and right now, given the currently crippled chip market, producing and releasing new hardware without guaranteeing or securing millions in orders would be a very risky endeavor.\n\nIt's worth remembering that despite the Switch's success even they struggle to gain as much third-party support as Microsoft and Sony. I think Sony would have a very uphill struggle doing any better.\n\nThe Switch is a hybrid though, is the Lite selling well?\n\nSurprisingly for the market in Japan the OG Switch is actually doing better than the Lite. Although a lot of this is attributed to the fact the standard Switch has been out a lot longer and had that much more time to have advantage in sales.\n\nYou would think the slimmer handheld only Lite model would be a more viable option for mainly workers that travel frequently and commute often but the the numbers are telling a different story entirely.\n\nEDIT: Dammit I didn't realize this was a thread from much earlier this year. Sorry for replying to such an old post but in anyways I still stand by what I said.\n\nSteam Deck had me thinking about this recently. I'm not too interested in the idea of another Sony handheld that Sony has to provide first-party development resources for but just doesn't, which is what happened with the Vita. The Switch is both the home and handheld console so Nintendo's resources don't need to be split across two platforms but the same would be true for Sony if they somehow had a handheld that simply had access to the same library as the home console (like Steam Deck), at reduced graphical/performance settings. Not sure when we'd get to the point where they could have such a handheld for whatever the current PS console is though.\n\nIt's a lot easier to take hardware intended to be low power and connect it to a TV than to take something designed as a powerful TV console and make it very tiny and low-power and actually keeping compatibility. Hardware with the capabilities of PS4? Feasible. Actual PS4 hardware in the size of Switch? More difficult.\n\nSteam Deck isn't much bigger than a Switch. And I imagine Sony know how to make handhelds better than Valve and could get it to around the same size.\n\nBut no, a new PlayStation handheld just isn't happening. There's too much competition now and they can't afford to split their focus between 2 devices in 2 different forms.\n\nA digital only portable that plays new and existing PS4 games on the go is the only product that has a remote chance of success, as there are enough people out there with significant digital libraries to make it appealing. Market it as a Steam Deck style \"accessory\" and they might do pretty well. But even that isnt a sure thing - in this very thread, you have people noping out at a digital only handheld, despite the fact that PS4 Bluray discs would likely be taller height wise than the entire handheld, and that creating cartridge based media containing the same games that already exist on BD is just not going to ever happen.\n\nAs for doing the Switch hybrid thing, they literally can't do that, as Nintendo went to a place that they can never follow. PlayStation hardware is consistently on the high end tech wise at launch, and they just released a console that will be impossible to replicate in a true handheld format for years to come due to heat/battery life/cost considerations. That would lead to splitting development once again between home console and handheld, and we've already seen how that plays out twice at this point - the handheld gets the short end of the stick.\n\nGiven the way that tech is advancing, I'd say the next Sony portable (if they ever actually do one) will be a streaming device that leverages some kind of cloud functionality to play all your games (not necessarily PSNow). That would allow them to keep the base hardware powerful while still allowing portable (or \"portable\", depending on your local internet quality) play.\n\nSorry to dig this up, but in the wake of the Steam Deck, looking at the specs of this thing, it is basically a stripped-down PS5. It has the same Zen2 / RNDA2 architecture. In theory, it should be compatible out of the box, just with much lower performance.\n\nI would really like something like a PS5 portable, that just plays all the PS4 / PS5 games in my library, using the same cloud saves, just at 720p and some other minor downgrades. Do it, Sony!\n\nJust because their the same architecture doesn't mean they'd be compatible out of the box. Every single game would have to be ported to the thing. Nothing in this realm is automatic, and when you're going that far, why bother sticking with a power hungry x86 cpu when you can get an equivalent arm processor with less power consumption.\n\nit will never not be incredibly disappointing that they followed up the psp (good library, ass to control a lot of the time) with a console that was a great design but left to die very quickly. it still held its value to me as an indie machine, but the potential of it was huge.\n\nI loved the Vita but I'd never make the mistake of buying a Sony handheld now unless it was already a success. plus if the steam deck is good to control there will be very little need for another portable console for a long time.\n\nI'd love it but ps tried this twice and failed miserably so they will not be going back for a long time if ever to this market\n\nalso Ps5 games, even if the could run in potato mode on a handheld, wouldn't have all the fancy controller gubbins that has been sold as the 'no limits' experience. Well I suppose they could in theory but it would be a biiiig handheld with nooo battery life\n\nfor ps cloud is their answer. Now xbox on the other hand absolutely should enter the handheld market and I think they will in the next 12-18 months. But I've made several threads on the matter and everyone thinks that's stupid so what do I know\n\nThe PSP failed? It sold more than the 3DS or the 360….\n\nEven if it played all your digital PS4 games without requiring re-purchase? Because a portable PS4 is what OP is talking about(ignoring PS5 pipedream).\n\nI'd certainly prefer digital only over being big enough to insert a blu-ray.\n\nEdit: MS has a way better chance at this with their BC solution not being tied to set hardware config. Sony would be stuck either putting PS4 chips directly into a portable machine, or get devs to update old games to run on the portable hardware.\n\nI thought the PS5 already proved you don't need PS4-specific hardware to play PS4 games? Seems like if Sony made a literal clone of the Steam Deck hardware along with the work they did for PS4->PS5 they could get extremely good compatibility right off the bat. It would be like if Valve already had confirmed compatibility for like 5000 games at launch. MS could do basically the same. Storage will be somewhat of an issue though with these gen 8 game sizes\n\nSony could quite easily bring out a handheld which is ridiculously powerful but it wouldn't be able to play anything from the back catalogue because of x64 vs arm.\n\nIf sony invested in a handheld that say had a snapdragon 888 in it, and developers put millions in to games for that hardware, then what you play would absolutely trounce what your currently seeing on mobile and even the switch. And a snapdragon 888 wouldn't chew through battery that much. Put in a modest 7000mah battery and you're easily getting 4-5 hours off one charge.\n\nIt is doable, just not in the sense of being able to play ps4. The architectures of those consoles simply don't lend themselves to efficient mobile chipsets.\n\nThey would need to start again like Nintendo did with switch.\n\nRDNA 2 with 18 CUs and PS4 clocks on 5nm + Zen 2 octo-core @ ~1.8 ghz would definitely draw a lot less power than PS5, but probably not quite get us to practical handheld range unless it was like a GPD win 3 tier thing that lasts 2 hours while weighing 70% more than the switch.\n\nAnother shrink after that? Might be possible to get your PS4 compatibility. It's easier to get PS4 tier power than it is to design a device that could literally run PS4 software. Quad core mobile CPUs can easily outperform PS4, but it's easy to imagine things fucking up unless it has 8 physical cores, 7 of which are running game tasks, even if the overall power is equivalent otherwise.\n\nYou don't need PS5 power to drive PS5 games at 720p30 and Steam Deck is a thing.\n\nLet's not kid ourselves though. I have an aya neo which on paper isn't too dissimilar to a steam deck and you aren't playing ps5 quality titles on it at 720p 30 unless you turn everything down to low. And then, we'll, it looks nothing like a ps5 game anymore, it doesn't even look as good as ps4 titles. The aya neo in my opinion power wise, sits somewhere between a 360/ps3 and a ps4/xbox1. I don't think the steam deck is much different. What can't be denied though is that the steam deck is much better price wise!"
