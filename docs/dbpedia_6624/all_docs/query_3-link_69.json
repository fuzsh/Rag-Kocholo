        "text": "VOICE OVER: Ty Richardson WRITTEN BY: Ty Richardson\n\nThe PSP saw a wealth of titles, and these are the ones we continue coming back to. For this list, we'll be looking at the PSP games we believe have aged the best. Our list includes “Resistance: Retribution” (2009), “God of War: Ghost of Sparta” (2010), “Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake” (2010), “LocoRoco” (2006), and more!\n\nWelcome to MojoPlays, and today, we’re taking a look at the 10 PSP Games That Are Still Worth Playing! The PSP saw a wealth of titles that helped the device sell millions upon millions of units. These are the ones we continue coming back to. What’s your favorite PSP game? Did it make our list? Let us know down in the comments!\n\n“Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy” (2009)\n\nYes, we do have “Dissidia Final Fantasy NT” on PS4 and PC, there are two problems: one, microtransactions, and two, support has ceased as of 2020. The original “Dissidia” remains supreme in the series for the simple fact that it didn’t hold content hostage. On top of that, it was truly a unique take on a “Final Fantasy” fighting game, combining the format of arena fighters with RPG elements. But what has us crawling back to “Dissidia 012” specifically is the expanded roster of characters. Plus, Tifa isn’t trapped behind a paywall, so there’s that.\n\n“LocoRoco” (2006)\n\nIf you’re ever feeling down, you absolutely need a few CC’s of “LocoRoco”. This tilt-&-tumble title was just constant cuteness wrapped up in a digital bundle of joy! Roll your LocoRoco around and grow or shrink to navigate the level and rescue all of your fellow companions. Between its bright colors and upbeat score, it’s simply impossible to have a bad time when playing this classic. All three games in the franchise - remasters of the original “LocoRoco”, “LocoRoco 2”, and a port of “LocoRoco Midnight Carnival” - are currently available to download on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.\n\n“Resistance: Retribution” (2009)\n\nOh, how we long for the day “Resistance” returns so that Sony can quit acting like “Call of Duty” is the “be all, end all” of FPS games. If we’re not getting ports, remasters, or remakes of the original “Resistance” games, can we at least get “Retribution”? Sure, it’s the black sheep of the franchise with its third-person camera, but it presented a different kind of experience compared to the explosive PS3 games. The health system made it feel a bit more arcade-y, the cover system was streamlined a bit by removing the lack of requiring an input, and the multiplayer was just as fun as the main games. Also, big shout-out to the checkpoint system: one of those rare cases where pacing is perfect!\n\n“Star Wars: Lethal Alliance” (2006)\n\nMost would flock to the “Battlefront” PSP games - “Elite Squadron” and “Rogue Squadron”, but we’d take “Lethal Alliance” for variety’s sake. In all honesty, “Lethal Alliance” did not get as much love as it should have. Some might scoff at the idea of a “Star Wars” game that doesn’t give you a lightsaber, but what it does without it is surprisingly fun. Those familiar with the Kyle Katarn games or “Star Wars Bounty Hunter” will enjoy the basic shooting mechanics and unique story about a Twi’lek mercenary hired to help bring down the Empire. Perhaps the LucasArts of today will revisit the story by hiring a studio to remake it.\n\n“Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake” (2010)\n\nWhile this was simply a handheld port of the PS3 game “Fat Princess”, “Fistful of Cake” is, more or less, the superior version of the game even if there were some visual sacrifices. For starters, “Fistful of Cake” offers up four new modes to the already addictive multiplayer in the form of Demolition, Jailbreak, Dilapidation, and Grim Reaper. These same modes would help expand the single-player campaign as well as six exclusive maps ”. This port alone is why we’d love to see one of the many Sony live service games supposedly being developed become “Fat Princess”.\n\n“Pinball Heroes” (2009)\n\nIf you haven’t heard of “Pinball Heroes”, we don’t blame you, as this was a game you could only download through the PSP’s PlayStation Store. Developed by Sony San Diego Studio, the studio behind “MLB: The Show”, “Pinball Heroes” was a collection of pinball tables based on various PlayStation titles including “Fat Princess”, “Uncharted”, “PAIN”, “ModNation Racers”, “High Velocity Bowling”, “Hot Shots Golf”, “WipeOut”, and “Motorstorm”. Each table was crafted with a clear understanding of how each game played, featuring different mechanics and events that truly captured the spirit of each IP. If you want to experience this classic for yourself, it is available for ten bucks on PlayStation Store and includes both PS4 and PS5 ports.\n\n“Patapon” series (2008-11)\n\nSpeaking of PSP classics ported to modern hardware, the “Patapon” games have somewhat made their way to modern consoles. This trilogy of games task you with commanding a tribe of creatures - the Patapon - and help them survive an unforgiving world of ghastly creatures and environments. Simply input one of a few commands to the beat of their rhythm. It does get hectic between matching their beat to give commands and trying to keep them alive in general. While you can play the first two games on PS4, “Patapon 3” is sadly stranded on the PSP…for some reason. Let’s hope we can get that fixed in the near future, especially since we can play PSP games on next gen consoles now.\n\n“God of War: Ghost of Sparta” (2010)\n\nThe first “God of War” PSP game, “Chains of Olympus”, was a promising start to Kratos’s life on Sony’s handheld. But between the two, “Ghost of Sparta” is the favorite among fans. The way it expands on the lore and Kratos’s story is excellent, and while the supposed “lack of innovation” was railed on by critics, we have to ask what exactly was there to “innovate” on when the combat is already solid and still holds up? It’s “God of War”; as long as the combat rocks and tells a fantastic story, that’s all we need.\n\n“The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky” (2011)\n\nHave you played “The Legend of Heroes” games? If not, hurry up and get a move on - they’re incredible in just how they build their worlds, write their characters, and keep amping up the stakes “Trails in the Sky” is no exception as it will pull you into its narrative within the first hour thanks to its retro design and mechanics. You wanna talk about one of the most underrated JRPGs today? They’re right here, man! And Trails is not a bad start.\n\n“Daxter” (2006)\n\n“Daxter” is perhaps the poster child of “stranded PSP games” as it is one of the very, very few Sony first-party games to never be ported forward, backward, anywhere. Taking place prior to the events of “Jak II”, “Daxter” focuses on the ottsel and his time as an exterminator in Haven City. What follows is a brilliant action-platformer, featuring hilarious writing, tight combat, and an assortment of insanely fun “dream sequences”. We have all four of the PS2 “Jak & Daxter” games available on PS4. Why is “Daxter” left out in the cold?"
