        "text": "The fifteenth in a series of articles I’m writing, looking at all the games available in a particular genre on Vita. The articles will highlight all Vita-native games, as well as any backwards-compatible PSP and PS1 titles which can be downloaded in English (i.e. from the EU or NA stores), as well as some commentary on how well those games run on Vita and whether they fill any missing gaps in the library.\n\nPuzzle games have been popular since the beginnings of the videogame industry right through to the present day and the same can be said of their popularity on handheld consoles – Tetris on the Game Boy is the best-selling title on that machine with a staggering 35 million copies sold, showing how well the genre adapted to on-the-go play. This popularity has endured throughout the following console generations – both DS and PSP shot puzzle franchises into the mainstream consciousness with Professor Layton and Lumines respectively, while even GBA and 3DS were home to hidden gems such as Kuru Kuru Kururin and Pushmo.\n\nOn Vita, the list is as good as any handheld – from classics of the genre to modern interpretations with their own ideas, there’s a fantastic selection here that’s worth celebrating. For this article, I’m going to be focusing only on those games that feature puzzles as their main mechanic, rather than titles that throw in a few puzzles while featuring the majority of the gameplay in a different style. That means 2D platformers will only make the cut if they have a heavy puzzle presence (think Teslagrad) and games like Resident Evil and Uncharted with a large focus on something else (horror/third person shooting) won’t be included – with that said, let’s get started!\n\nVita-native games\n\nAs always, the best place to start is with Vita’s launch lineup which included multiple puzzle games, but most notably an exclusive that remains one of the most acclaimed titles on the platform to this day – Lumines: Electronic Symphony.\n\nMixing block-falling gameplay in the vein of Tetris with rhythm-based gameplay where blocks are only eliminated once a Time Line crosses them, the game acts as an evolution of its PSP predecessors (sadly unavailable for Vita) and provides the same killer soundtrack and addictive gameplay with a few tweaks to make it easily the best version to date. This wouldn’t be the only dose of block-falling gameplay that we’d get on the handheld though (not even the only rhythm-based one as Magical Beat exists), as a fully-fledged Tetris game entitled Tetris Ultimate – a port of a title that was originally made for 3DS. The game received positive reviews for its fun customisation options and online modes making it a solid pick, and if you don’t mind importing, there’s also Puyo Puyo Tetris, a SEGA-developed title that mixes Tetris with the popular Puyo Puyo series.\n\nJust like block-falling games have been popular for a long time, so too have block-smashing games in the vein of Breakout. Again, Vita has been home to plenty of these block-breakers – starting with BreakQuest: Extra Evolution very early in the console’s life, which was an expanded version of a beloved PlayStation Mini that received a positive critical reception. If you’d prefer a bit more story, then you could try Twin Breaker: A Sacred Symbols Adventure which takes the basic gameplay idea and experiments with it in new and interesting ways (while also incorporating a narrative penned by Colin Moriarty), or again if you don’t mind importing then there is the adorable Hello Kitty: Block Crash V which is perfectly easy to play whether you understand Japanese or not.\n\nLumines wasn’t the only stand-out puzzle game of Vita’s launch lineup though – Touch my Katamari was the latest entry in the series at that point, incorporating touch controls with the ever-popular ball-rolling design which required you to think up ways to scoop up ever-larger items. It’s a bonkers premise but thanks to its colourful visuals, killer soundtrack and solid design it stood out as one of the console’s key exclusives (despite some frustrating issues with DLC). Another colourful Vita puzzle game from 2012 that’s worth mentioning is Super Monkey Ball: Banana Splitz, a similarly bespoke entry in a long-running franchise where you have to guide a monkey in a ball around labyrinths without falling off the map – it was tough as nails, but very enjoyable.\n\nThe Monkey Ball design template was somewhat copied in Chronovolt, an early PS+ game that received some negative feedback for its imprecise controls. It went for a more muted colour palette than its inspiration, but thankfully if you’re looking for colourful Vita puzzle games there are plenty of choose from – take for example Frobisher Says!, a free-to-play title inspired by Warioware with a vibrant and unique aesthetic. There’s also things like Lemmings Touch (a modern version on the classic formula, also seen in Bombing Busters which apes Bomberman), NekuBuro Catsblock (another match-three game except this time with adorable cats), Sokoban Next (a 3D version of the classic puzzle idea), Sunflowers and SwapQuest, all of which offer bite-sized pieces of puzzling fun with bright and lively visual design.\n\nGiven the relative power of the Vita compared to mobile hardware at the time, it was commonplace for popular iOS and Android games to make their way across to Sony’s handheld early on. These include Angry Birds Trilogy, a compilation of three of the mega-successful bird-flinging mobile games adapted to console (this was followed up by Angry Birds Star Wars, a crossover with the mega-popular media franchise); Fruit Ninja (another incredibly successful title where you slash at fruit with the touchscreen); Furmins (an average puzzle game from Super Stardust developer Housemarque); Jacob Jones and the Bigfoot Mystery (of which sadly we only ever got the first episode) and Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon (sequel to a critically-acclaimed mobile-only title). Perhaps even more notable are Hitman GO and Lara Croft GO, bite-sized mobile versions of the popular console series.\n\nVita also found itself home to multiple titles which were either ported across from the PlayStation Minis platform or PlayStation Mobile, or sequels to such games. These included Coconut Dodge Revitalized (a simple game where you dodge coconuts as a crab); No Heroes Allowed: No Puzzles Either! (a solid free-to-play version of one of PSM’s most popular games); The Quiet Collection (adorable adventure-esque titles where you’re just trying to get some peace and quiet); Stardrone Extreme (a clever gravity-shifting asteroid title); Surge Deluxe (a lively block-matching game from the ever-reliable FuturLab) and Treasures of Montezuma 4 (which is now the only available version given the free-to-play Blitz has been delisted).\n\nPuzzles can come in many different forms and it was fairly common to see narrative-driven games with heavy puzzle elements show up on Vita. The earliest example of this I can think of is Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward which released in 2012 as the sequel to the DS game 999 – rather interestingly, this title came to Vita itself a few years later in The Nonary Games, a collection which included both 999 and Virtue’s Last Reward. The trilogy was capped off with Zero Time Dilemma and all three games see you having to solve cryptic puzzles to escape locked rooms, all the while following a twisting narrative of betrayal. They were very well received and remain some of the most beloved titles on the platform.\n\nIf you’re after good stories, you could also check out some of the Double Fine/LucasArts titles such as Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle and Grim Fandango, all of which were lovingly brought across from older platforms to Vita – alongside Double Fine’s own Broken Age which was clearly heavily inspired by these classics. A similar franchise from back in the day is Broken Sword, which brought its latest entry The Serpent’s Curse to Vita via two downloadable entries following a successful Kickstarter campaign and its influence can be seen in Demetrios – The BIG Cynical Adventure (that originally started life as a Broken Sword fan mod). Narrative also plays a roll in other point ‘n’ click puzzle-adventures such as Dreamlands: Aisling’s Quest, Machinarium and Mr Pumpkin Adventure.\n\nOf course, a game doesn’t have to strictly adhere to adventure elements to successfully pull off a narrative. Take for example The Unfinished Swan, an under-rated puzzle title where you have to find your way around by throwing paint balls, or Attractio which casts you as a contestant in a futuristic game show with a gravity-shifting gun that’s more fun than it seems. You could also pick one of the many 2D indie-esque titles from Nippon Ichi such as A Rose in the Twilight, HTOL#NIQ: The Firefly Diary or The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince (the latter of which sadly has to be imported) or try out the brilliant Papers, Please, a document-checking sim where you have to decide who to let in at the border (there’s also its obvious imitator Need a Packet?).\n\nThen there’s things like Octodad: Dadliest Catch, an adorable game where you play as an octopus pretending to be a dad that has one of the sweetest tales I’ve ever seen in a game, or Factotum 90 which sees you controlling a pair of walking robots while being guided by a companion. Dying Reborn meanwhile mixes puzzles with horror elements (much like Whispering Willows) while Level 22 combines stealth with puzzles similarly to Spy Chameleon (and a very humorous story too boot). Speaking of funny stories, MonsterBag is a Vita exclusive that is a bizarre mix of light-hearted puzzle solving and more profound moments while if you speak Japanese, you can import Catherine: Full Body, which is the sometimes haunting but often hilarious tale of a man’s descent into madness following infidelity. On the other end of the scale, Metropolis: Lux Obscura offers a very dark story in with some light match-three puzzle gameplay.\n\nThen there are 2D platformers that combine puzzle elements in with their more traditional gameplay – the obvious examples for this being Limbo and Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty but there are plenty more to choose from on Vita, my favourite of the bunch being the lovely Hue. You also have the choice of things like Fez, Thomas Was Alone (a critically-acclaimed title that I didn’t think much of) and The Swapper, all of which received a lot of attention upon release, as well as more hidden gems like Teslagrad, Metrico and Nihilumbra – or if you’re into importing you could try Rabi x Laby: Puzzle Out Stories. Other games like Dokuro, Still Time, Twin Robots and Type:Rider probably aren’t worth the effort, but at least the options exist and offer their own clever ideas at times.\n\nOther Vita games focus on training your brain by having you crack their puzzles – the most obvious example being Smart As…, a Sony-published brain-training game and obvious attempt to cash in on the success of similar titles seen on the DS. Some brain workouts come from word spelling seen in things like Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey and Spellspire while others come from doing simple crossword-esque puzzles (and similar) which have become the specialty of Lightwood Games with their massive POWGI offering including things like Block-a-Pix, Crossovers, Mixups, Pic-a-Pix, Word Search and Word Sudoku (Sometimes You also offered up the unique Active Neurons).\n\nWhen the Vita came along, it offered new ways to create games with its extra hardware bells and whistles and certain titles made full use of this to create unique puzzle experiences. Take for example Murasaki Baby, a bizarre title where you guide a girl by holding her hand through the touch screen which works surprisingly well (even if the game is a bit disappointing), while Escape Plan similarly uses all of the handheld’s new bells and whistles in unique and clever ways (something that Sony repeated with Open Me!, an augmented-reality puzzle game about opening boxes). Even indie devs got in on this action, with Sir Eatsalot being an ambitious title that incorporates the front and rear touch in natural ways, while others such as Doodle Devil (as well as Doodle God and Doodle Kingdom) simply use the touch screen to great effect.\n\nThen there are some games that just offer their own unique ideas irrespective of hardware features – examples include things like Bridge Constructor which has you constructing bridges with a limited number of parts capable of holding up certain weights of vehicles going over them; Gunhouse which involves match-three gameplay to create turrets to defend a house and Poltergeist: A Pixelated Horror, where you have to scare the residents of a house as a ghost to get them out. Titles like Baseball Riot and Tennis in the Face meanwhile have you using physics to get projectiles around a screen (a little like Angry Birds) while Puddle uses physics in a similar way except with water. Meanwhile, Neon Junctions is a first-person puzzler where you have to connect electricity by laying blocks which I quite enjoyed.\n\nI have to give a special mention to Mekorama, which successfully apes the Captain Toad formula of controlling a little character around diorama-like levels by changing the perspective that’s apparently a really good time, with similar 2.5D perspective-shifting offered from Back to Bed, Lumo and Q*Bert Rebooted (please don’t ever play the latter game, it’s awful). Other well-received puzzle games I’ve yet to mention include Dreamwalker, Fat City, King Oddball, Mousecraft, Semispheres and Waking Violet, all of which offer their own take on how to tease a player’s brain (if you’re into importing, I hear that Mahjong Fight Club is very good, although the western-released Mahjong Gold and Mahjong Royal Towers should do you just fine too).\n\nThen there’s the games I just couldn’t fit in mentioning anywhere else yet – like The Bridge (an absolutely bonkers puzzle trip) and Koi (a disappointingly simple game). There’s a whole range of stuff here that I could talk about for paragraphs more but to keep this article readable, I’ll just list them here – A Virus Named Tom, Azkend 2, Dreii, the Energy games (Balance/Cycle/Edge/Invasion), Gem Legends and Gem Smashers, Germinator and Ms Germinator, Grass Cutter, the Sparkle games (1, 2 and Unleashed), Squares and Super Blackout.\n\nBackwards-compatible PSP games\n\nWhile perhaps the most recognisable PSP puzzlers (Lumines) are sadly absent from the store, this is more than made up for with other often-forgotten titles, none more prominent than Sony’s own efforts such as No Heroes Allowed!\n\nThis trilogy (consisting of What did I do to deserve this, My Lord?!, What did I do to deserve this, My Lord?! 2 and the aforementioned No Heroes Allowed) pits you as an evil overlord trying to summon the God of Destruction who needs to defend himself by digging tunnels underground and breeding monsters. It’s definitely part-simulation, but the focus here is on being as efficient as possible and there’s an undeniable puzzle element to the way the blocks are destroyed – it’s wholly unique and quite a lot of fun. Elsewhere, you could look into Locoroco and its sequels Locoroco 2 and Midnight Carnival, and Sony also published the unique puzzle game Echochrome (unfortunately only available on North American PSN) and its spin-off Echoshift, featuring artwork inspired by MC Escher and high-concept gameplay ideas involving camera manipulation and time control.\n\nAnother Sony PSP puzzle offering was yet another version of Lemmings, this time without the extra control bells and whistles that Touch had, offering a nice core experience for those looking to save the little critters. Speaking of puzzle IP’s that received PSP entries, it’s worth noting that Me & My Katamari was the first ever handheld game in the aforementioned quirky franchise that overcame control issues (lacking a second analogue stick) by providing a content-rich experience that easily matched its console counterparts. There’s also Bomberman Land and Bomberman Legacy should you want to blow things up, Super Monkey Ball Adventure should you want even more ball-rolling and if even this isn’t enough, there’s two Mercury titles available through the North American store as well as Fading Shadows in Europe.\n\nPSP also birthed a few modern classics too, most notably Puzzle Quest; Challenge of the Warlords (which is available on NA PSN). A simple match-three game where you use chains to build up the power of a warrior, it was followed by multiple sequels and has recently been remastered for Switch, showing its enduring popularity all these years later. If you’re looking for something similar, Capcom Puzzle World contains multiple popular puzzle games but most notably Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo which has you matching blocks to cast hadoukens as your fighter – an interesting concept that proves to be supremely addictive at the same time.\n\nAside from this, there are numerous games that offer various puzzle challenges – things like 7 Wonders of the Ancient World, Carol Vordeman’s Sukodu, Luxor: Pharaoh’s Challenge and Mawaskes Puzzle. If you don’t mind diving into the PSP Minis library there’s a solid offering here too – things like Arctic Adventures and Kahoots, alongside clever ideas like Cubixx where you have to cut away the sides of block. I suppose titles like Supermarket Mania also have a puzzle element as you have to serve all the customers within the time limit – but I would count this as more of an arcade/simulation title (it’s still a lot of fun, whatever it is).\n\nAs a final note, I want to highlight a couple of the more creative and under-rated puzzle games that came to PSP and are definitely worth checking out on Vita. One is Crush (which was eventually re-released for 3DS where it was similarly ignored) where you shift the world’s design from 2D to 3D in order to find a way out of each level which is a fantastic concept (somewhat similar to Fez) that was executed really well. The other is Exit 2, a sort of 2D platformer where you have to help Mr ESC overcome obstacles to escape a building – I barely ever see this one mentioned, but it’s a lot of fun (its predecessor Exit was also available on PSN for a while but has sadly been delisted).\n\nBackwards-compatible PS1 games\n\nThanks to its huge commercial success as a console, the PS1 was host to numerous puzzle-centric IP’s both well-known and obscure over the years – and many of these can be bought on Vita through PS1 classics.\n\nMost notably, if you have a North American PSN account you can access Bust-A-Move 4 (aka Puzzle Bobble 4, the latest in the long-running series where you shoot bubbles from a pointer to match three and make an ever-dropping line disappear. Largely seen as one of the best entries in the franchise, it remains fantastically playable to this day – something that can be also said about Pac-Man, the arcade classic which is available through the Namco Museum titles on the American Store. There are five versions available and each contain different titles, from Dig Dug to Pac-Mania, giving you potentially endless hours to whittle away should you give them a try (Mr Driller was also available as a separate PS1 classic at one point, but has since been delisted).\n\nYou can also get Bomberman from the North American Store (unfortunately none of these games are available in Europe for some reason), also known as Bomberman ’94, which is a port of the well-received SEGA Genesis original and offers plenty of bomb-dropping fun true to the original design. Another popular arcade game from that era is Frogger and while you unfortunately can’t get this game for Vita, you could for a while buy Sheep, which is exactly the same in gameplay terms except for – you guessed it – sheep instead of frogs. Other less well-known puzzlers from the PS1’s library include Blockids and Sorcerer’s Maze, the latter of which is yet another Breakout clone.\n\nAs mentioned though, PS1 was as much defined by the obscure, forgotten titles as it was bigger names and there’s no more obscure a PS1 game than Intelligent Qube (or Kurushi as it was known in Europe). In this, 3D blocks roll towards you and you have to ‘clear’ them by placing marks on the stage where they’re going to roll – it’s hugely addictive and greatly ignored, which is a real shame. Another forgotten PS1 puzzler is Kula World in which you roll a beach ball around a grid-shaped world finding keys and opening locks – great to chip away at on the go on Vita which has definitely given it a new lease of life (I should also mention that if you have a Japanese PSN account you can get Devil Dice, which is just as good now as it ever was – a real shame this one wasn’t re-released in the west).\n\nAs a final note, the Tomb Raider games – although technically 3D platformer/adventure/action titles – contain a heavy emphasis on puzzle solving that more than makes them worthy of inclusion of this list. You can get all of the first five entries, from the original game right through to Chronicles providing a stream of content. There’s also 2D platformers like the two Oddworld games as well as a pair of Tomba! titles that again aren’t pure puzzlers, but are worth including here for the amount of brain-teasing sections they include.\n\nConclusion\n\nSolving puzzles appeals to such a basic human instinct – seeing a problem and having a desire to find a solution – so it’s hardly surprising to see that they’ve flourished as a form of videogames. Right back from the origins of the industry, puzzle games have been prevalent and many classics of the genre such as Tetris are still as relevant now as they’ve ever been, although due to their casual-friendly nature we have seen quite a few shift over into the mobile space to appeal to a wider audience.\n\nWith that said, Vita hit the ground running with puzzlers thanks to the likes of Lumines and Katamari and kept this going throughout its life – whether it revivals of things like Lemmings, to ports of modern-day smash hits like Angry Birds, to bespoke new experience like Escape Plan or even narrative puzzlers like Zero Escape, the handheld offers an impressive selection that’s well worth checking out. As usual, throw in a few backwards-compatible hits like Kurushi, No Heroes Allowed and Super Puzzle Fighter and you’ve got a library that’s going to keep anyone entertained – so if you like having your brain teased, then there’s no better place than Vita."
