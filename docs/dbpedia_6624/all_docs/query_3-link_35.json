        "text": "Handheld gaming has come back in a big way this past generation. Nintendo formerly held the crown as the king of the dedicated handheld market with its unfathomably successful DS line, which would eventually combine into a home console with the equally impressive Switch. PlayStation attempted to get into this market with the PSP and PS Vita but appeared to bow out of that competition when the latter failed to achieve much success. However, the new PlayStation Portal device could provide players with an alternative to Nintendo’s aging system.\n\nIf you’re debating between the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation Portal, here’s a full breakdown of how the two devices stack up.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nNintendo Switch Vs. PlayStation Portal specs\n\nWhen it comes to specs, let’s start with the easy comparisons.\n\nThe PlayStation Portal wins out in most spec categories, specifically in screen size and resolution. It can output in full 1080p HD while the Switch, in handheld mode, can only reach 720p at a smaller screen size. The only edge you could give the switch is the option to get an OLED screen for greater colors. The only downside to the Portal here is that it can’t be used for any cloud gaming, while there are a few games you can stream on Switch. Battery life isn’t a big differentiator, but is slightly higher in the Portal, but will be game-dependent.\n\nThe real thing to consider here is that the PlayStation Portal cannot be used without a Wi-Fi connection to your PS5. This is a remote-play device, meaning it cannot function on its own like the Switch. You won’t be able to whip out your Portal on a bus ride or plane without a connection to your PS5 as you could with a Switch. This also makes input lag a potential factor since streaming games from your console will mean the responsiveness will vary based on your own home internet speeds.\n\nNintendo Switch vs. PlayStation Portal graphics\n\nGraphically speaking, the PlayStation Portal has the Switch beat just looking at raw numbers. We already discussed how it can display games at 1080p over the Switch’s 720p, but beyond that, the PS5 has some of the most technically impressive-looking games on the market. The Switch, while absolutely having its own catalog of visually impressive games, is running much weaker and older hardware and simply can’t output the same level of fidelity.\n\nNintendo Switch vs. PlayStation Portal games\n\nSpeaking of games, this one will all come down to personal preference.\n\nIf you’re are PlayStation fan, or simply want the biggest possible library of games to play, the Portal can run any game the PS5 can. That includes all the first-party exclusives, plus just about every third-party game released. The only major omissions would obviously be Xbox and Nintendo exclusives.\n\nThe Switch’s library is undoubtedly great, but also heavily dependent on Ninteno’s first-party games such as Mario Wonder and Tears of the Kingdom. It arguably has just as high-quality games as PlayStation, but targets different audiences. Third-party support, while not absent, is much more limited and usually stripped down in terms of graphics and performance.\n\nNintendo Switch vs. PlayStation Portal price\n\nThe Nintendo Switch has remained at $300 for the base model and $350 for the OLED model for its entire lifecycle, with no signs of dropping until a new system is released.\n\nThe PlayStation Portal on its own costs $200, but does require you to either already own or purchase a PS5. PS5, with the new slim models, now costs either $450 for the digital version or $500 for the disc version.\n\nNintendo Switch vs. PlayStation Portal reviews\n\nOur review of the PlayStation Portal was mixed. We appreciated its low price, comfort level, sharp display, and integrated features from the DualSense controller, but disappointed that it has a very limited use case."
