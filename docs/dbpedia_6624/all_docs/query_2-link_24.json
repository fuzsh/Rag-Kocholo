        "text": "It is useless to talk about the success of smartphones. This industry has reached a position where big companies are also creating different applications to earn profit. Do you remember Nintendo’s changes? In the past, the Japanese had no desire to develop video games on smartphones, but later they changed their policies entirely. As a result, the smartphone application industry has gained much popularity. Therefore, many studios or biggest mobile game companies have turned to developing mobile games.\n\nWhich are the best mobile game companies among all these gaming studios?

There were no computer games then, and Yamauchi tried to make money by producing and publishing a Japanese playing card called Hanafuda. In 1959, Nintendo made a deal with the Walt Disney Company that allowed them to use Walt Disney cartoon characters on their cards. They also received an offer to sell their playing cards in toy stores along with this contract. By 1961, Nintendo had sold more than 1.5 million cards, and the company’s stock was among the best-selling and most expensive stocks.
