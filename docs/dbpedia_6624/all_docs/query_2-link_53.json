        "text": "The folks at Modojo love handheld gaming enough to specialize in it, but with that much love comes an equal amount of hate, and thus we have their list of ten things they hate about the DS and PSP, five apiece. I'm largely in agreement with the whole thing--that analog nub is enough to make me want to kick things--but I do quibble with a few of their choices, specifically the \"Quirky Titles\" complaint for the DS:\n\nI like quirky games and innovation just as much as the next guy. I love digital comic-type graphic adventures. Warioware Touched is genuinely fun for about 45 minutes. It's just that, sometimes, I want to play an adrenaline-fueled racer or a baseball game. Unfortunately, if that's your cup of tea, you may be sorely disappointed. Nintendo's handheld entry offers unparalleled panache - but not as much palpitation.\n\nNow, I understand what he's saying, but given that every other console out there is positively choking on the non-quirky types of games he's craving, I don't feel at all sorry that he can't play Juiced on his DS. When we start getting our choice of titles like Touch Detective, Hotel Dusk, or Electroplankton on other platforms, then I'll start bemoaning the \"limited\" range of DS offerings. Until then, I shed no tears.\n\n10 Things I Hate About You [Modojo]\n\nHe Made a Movie About Humans Rising Up Against AI.
