        "text": "The best gaming handheld options have evolved since the early days of the Game Boy, but there's arguably never been a better time to pick up a portable. Not only are we finally at the stage where you properly play PC games using the likes of Valve's Steam Deck, but hybrid solutions like the Nintendo Switch serve as both a mobile machine and a home console.\n\nAgain, times move swiftly, and the best gaming handheld today can do so much more than its ancestor from even a decade ago. Overall, we still think the Switch has an edge in terms of widespread appeal, as everyone can get on board with playing the latest Mario or Pokémon outing during travel. However, there are more options than ever to suit a variety of playstyles and budgets, including powerful handheld gaming PCs and budget emulation devices that'll run the classics with ease.\n\nBefore choosing any old portable, it's worth thinking about the games you actually want to play. Whether your backlog lives on Steam, Xbox Game Pass, the Epic Game Store, or Nintendo’s eShop, it's possible to play more games than ever on a portable console or PC. To help you narrow things down, we continually test the best gaming handhelds for your consideration, and you'll find our favorites rounded up below. We've even included our top emulation devices for running your old backups, just incase you're looking for a retro kick.\n\nThe quick list\n\nThe best gaming handheld\n\nNintendo's mighty console arguably sparked a new era of handheld gaming, and the Nintendo Switch OLED model adds to the terrific formula. It's not the highest spec console by today's standards, and a lot has changed within the console realm since the original's 2017 debut. Nevertheless, it's hard to deny its portable prowess and incredible library, two factors that make it our top on the go system in 2024.\n\nFeatures: While we've given the top spot to the Nintendo Switch OLED model specifically, many of its strengths are included with the original version too. It's lightweight, retains support for physical game cartridges, and still comes armed with removable Joycons and a docking station. However, If you pick up the OLED model over the Switch Lite or original version, your eyes will be in for a treat. The new display boasts superb contrast and colours that transform epic adventures like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom into pure eye candy, and the slightly larger 7-inch screen makes all the difference.\n\nDesign: The OLED Switch almost looks the same as its predecessor, but there are a few key difference that help it stand out. For starters, the OLED screen itself is slightly larger and features a slimmer bezel, something that helps give it a visual edge over other handhelds out there. Its also got an improved kickstand round the back, which is sure to please anyone who's had a near miss using the flimsy flap included with the original.\n\nPerformance: Sure, the Switch's innards aren't exactly impressive, but they ultimately get the job done. The NVIDIA Tegra X1 SoC within packs enough of as punch to provide 1080p 30fps visuals, and playing in handheld mode reduces the burden in some demanding games. That said, you won't have to worry about performance for the most part, as Nintendo's library caters to the hardware to ensure a smooth experience. If you are fussy when it comes to frame rates, you're probably in the market for a handheld PC instead.\n\nGames: Naturally, The Nintendo Switch OLED has access to an extraordinary library of games, and it's one of the only handhelds on this list with first-party titles. While handheld PCs have storefront versatility on their side, the Switch has Zelda, Mario, Pokémon, and various other heavy hitters that'll distract some players from ever thinking about the wild west of Steam. Arguably, the Switch's catalogue of adventures is reason enough to invest in the hardware, and it's the reason the platform is still going strong six years later.\n\nRead more: Nintendo Switch OLED review\n\nThe best gaming handheld for most players\n\nThe original model set a new standard for handheld gaming PCs when it arrived in 2022, but the new Steam Deck OLED takes the handheld to even greater heights. Now a platform in its own right, Valve's latest portable system blends fantastic, speedy OLED visuals with the same great software and hardware we all know and love, along with some additional improvements sprinkled in.\n\nFeatures: Both the original version and the Steam Deck OLED have plenty of tricks up their sleeve, and are effectively a fully fledged PC crammed into a handheld shell. That means you'll be able to play games usually available to your rig using integrated controls, haptic feedback, a gyroscope, and dual touchpads. If you're more into consoles than traditional desktop setups, you'll definitely vibe with what the Deck has to offer.\n\nUnlike the model we first tried a few years ago, the Steam Deck OLED, as the name implies, has a shiny new OLED display. Compared to LCD, switching screen type means you'll be able to enjoy excellent contrast and colors that'll put many full blown gaming monitors to shame, not to mention it's also 90Hz.\n\nDesign: Weighing in at 640g, the Steam Deck OLED is noticeably lighter than its predecessor, even if it's still one of the chonkiest handhelds around. That said, its ergonomic shape means it'll fit in your hands nicely, and If you played a lot of Wii U before the Switch arrived, you'll be familiar with Valve's high-up symmetrical stick layout. Plus, it pretty much follows the modern PC controller playbook in terms of buttons, so you won't have to get used to any weird configurations.\n\nPerformance: Again, the Steam Deck isn't the most powerful handheld PC around, but it still offers decent performance considering its price. Value's custom AMD APU is capable of running a chunk of your library at over 60fps when using its 800p screen, and you'll even be able to play on a bigger screen using a Steam Deck dock. For the most part, you'll have to make do with low settings to boost fps to an acceptable level when running new releases, but you'll still notice the visual difference compared to Nintendo Switch.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Steam Deck OLED technically comes armed with a different AMD APU to the original. It's still RDNA 2, and the changes are better described as refinement that contribute to efficiency and power. Yet, during testing, we did find minor improvements when measured side by side with the LCD model, which might appeal to those of you looking to harness every frame during portable play.\n\nGames: Not every game on Steam is compatible with SteamOS, but over 10,000 games are marked as either Steam Deck Verified or Playable. That means you shouldn't experience any game breaking bugs while playing, but the system is more of a handheld helping hand than a performance guarantee. Compatibility woes aside, you'll have access to a plethora of games from the get go if you pick up a Steam Deck, and that's remarkable given you can grab the LCD version for $399.\n\nRead more: Steam Deck OLED review\n\nThe best handheld gaming PC\n\nIt's far from perfect, but the Asus ROG Ally is an exceptional handheld gaming PC that delivers better performance than the Steam Deck. It also boasts full PC compatibility thanks to the fact its a Windows device, but that's ultimately both a blessing and a curse when it comes to the overall experience.\n\nFeatures: Just like the Steam Deck, the Asus ROG Ally is a 7-inch handheld clad with integrated controls. However, the Ally takes things up a notch by including an 120Hz 1080p display, and a newer AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor. That combo enables it to deliver slicker visuals and surprisingly high frame rates, particularly in demanding games.\n\nDesign: The ROG Ally is one of the better looking portable PCs around, and it feels pretty nice in the hands too. Weighing in at 608g, it's actually slightly lighter than the Steam Deck, but still feels rugged and packs extra aesthetic quirks like RGB thumb sticks. Its white, form fitting shell stands out compared to the Deck, while its overall shape and curves provide comfortable access to its buttons, triggers, and asymmetrical sticks.\n\nPerformance: The Z1 Extreme APU hiding within the ROG Ally has swiftly become the new chip to beat. For the most part, you'll be able to boost fps far beyond the realms of the Steam Deck in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Starfield. However, it doesn't quite reach the same heights as premium contenders like the Ayaneo 2S, and you may struggle to actually take full advantage of the 120Hz screen. That aside, if you're looking for a more affordable handheld PC that can maintain frame rates at 1080p, this is it.\n\nGames: Being a Windows handheld PC, the Asus ROG Ally has can run every application that your conventional rig can. In other words, you can install and run multiple storefronts like Steam, the Epic Game Store, PC Game Pass, and GOG all without having to rely on workarounds or compatibility layers (unlike the Steam Deck). That's not to say you won't encounter performance hurdles or issues relating to controller compatibility, and it's worth noting that Windows handheld optimisation can be an issue in itself when trying to jump between apps and games.\n\nRead more: Asus ROG Ally review\n\nThe best premium gaming handheld\n\nThe Ayaneo 2S will make your wallet weep, but it offers up incredible frame rates in even the most demanding games. That said, It suffers from the same drawbacks as other Windows handhelds, so keep that in mind before investing in this portable powerhouse.\n\nFeatures: If you love feature-packed devices, you'll dig what the Ayaneo 2S has to offer. It may look like other handheld gaming PCs at a glance, but it wields a 1200p display, Ryzen 7 7840U APU, up to 64GB RAM, and a 4TB SSD (depending on model). Upon closer inspection, even the handheld's exterior has something to prove, as it's equipped with three USB-C ports rather than one. That particular boon means you don't need a dock to use the portable as a desktop PC, and that's rather fitting given its capabilities.\n\nDesign: Arguably, the Ayaneo 2S sings from the same sheet as the Asus ROG Ally in terms of design. Similarities include an asymmetrical thumb stick layout with RGB lighting underneath, but small differences like its bezel-less screen and curvier design provide it with a more premium vibe. At 667g, it's pretty weighty, but we found it to be comfortable to use for extended periods.\n\nPerformance: The Ryzen 7 7840U is a pretty powerful chip, and it enables the Ayaneo 2S to smash the portable performance ceiling. It's the only handheld we've tested to date that can run Cyberpunk 2077 at 60fps using 800p low settings, which is a mean feat given how demanding CD Projekt Red's RPG is. Just keep in mind that just like the Asus ROG Ally, Windows related shenanigans can hamper performance if and when quirks and bugs occur, and it'll be up to you to investigate.\n\nGames: With risk of sounding like a broken record, Windows handhelds can run anything a conventional PC can. Therefore, the Ayaneo 2S has a pretty chunky library that extends across Steam, the Epic Game Store, PC Game Pass, and more. You may have to wrestle with controller settings and other Windows options on occasion to actually get up and running, but that's all par for the course if you're into PC gaming anyway.\n\nRead more: Ayaneo 2S review\n\nThe best handheld for emulation\n\nThe RG35XX Plus may be a clone of the Miyoo Mini Plus but what Anbernic has achieved here is remarkable. It looks the same, but is slightly longer and uses stronger tech on the inside. It's not going to rival the likes of the Retroid Pocket 4 Pro or the Steam Deck anytime soon, but if you want solid power in a Game Boy-style package, the RG35XX Plus is a worthy contender with an excellent budget price.\n\nFeatures: If you want a shining example of how to do upgrades, the RG35XX Plus is where it's at. Gone is the Quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 paired with the PowerVR chipset and 256MB of RAM found in the original model, and in its place comes the meatier platter of the H700 quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 paired to 1GB of RAM. This upgrade blows the original RG35XX out of the water when it comes to emulation. Instead of middling emulation you'll find in every budget device, up to and some PSP is now playable, all for just 64 bucks. Not bad, eh?\n\nLet's be honest here, the Anbernic custom Linux operating system is boringly plain, it does the job. Games and emulators are front and center, and that's fine given the cost of the device. Updating the system is an exercise in pain most will avoid if possible, while the option to output the device to a TV or monitor via mini HDMI is a nice little touch.\n\nDesign: Not much has changed from the original model, which itself was a clone of the Miyoo Mini Plus. What I will say is that Anbernic employs a 'if it ain't' broke, don't fix it' mentality. It looks like a Game Boy, albeit with an extra menu and X and Y face buttons. The triggers are still uncomfortable, as is the case with all vertical handhelds, but that's not the end of the world. The slight size increase over the Miyoo Mini Plus really helps with comfort, too.\n\nPerformance: PSP works, but the entire catalog isn't playable. Don't expect to be playing God of War on this device anytime soon. That said, if you're gearing for some 2D PSP action or old game compilations, they work well. Dreamcast is also a nice surprise, with a large portion of the back catalogue running at a stable framerate. If you've got a hankering for some Marvel vs Capcom 2 or Crazy Taxi on the go, those options are very much a reality here.\n\nGames: While the RG35XX Plus has its limitations, you'll be able to emulate a majority of the classics using this dinky handheld. From the 8-bit glory days of the NES and Game Boy to even to some 3D experiences like Dreamcast and PSP, you'll be able to explore video game history with something that's smaller than old video game cartridges. Just keep in mind that since we're talking about emulation, you'll have to supply your own collection of legally obtained ROMs.\n\nRead more: Anbernic RG35XX Plus review\n\nThe best budget handheld\n\nJust like the Evercade EXP, the Super Pocket by HyperMegaTech can run all the platform's wonderful cartridges. However, unlike its more sophisticated sibling, this handheld is actually more like Game Boy in terms of design, and since it only costs $59 / £49, it'll set you back less than most PS5 or Nintendo Switch games.\n\nFeatures: One of the wonderful things about the Super Pocket is that it truly strips things back to basics. Sure, there's a menu that'll enable to you choose between either the handheld's built in collection or a connected Evercade cart, but the rest is pretty much as plug and play as things get. That means you'll be able to use the platform's carts without having to deal with downloads, patches, visual settings, or other modern shinanigans.\n\nDesign: Available in both Capcom and Taito flavors, you'll be able to either choose between two different colorways, or even splash out on both if you're collecting. The actual layout is pretty much in line with every other Game Boy-inspired handheld out there, with the usual D-pad and four button set at the front accompanied by some rear bumpers for games with more complex controls. As the name suggests, it's also pocket sized, so as long as you're wearing pants, you'll be able to easily take it on your travels.\n\nPerformance: Evercade performance is usually pretty on point, and the same goes for the Super Pocket. Whether it's handling an old arcade game, a classic console favorite, or even a modern indie release, this tiny handheld pulls it off without emulation inaccuracies or annoying hiccups. That might not sound to impressive to anyone who's used to emulating, but remember this dinky device costs less than most new Switch games.\n\nGames: Depsite its fantastic budget price tag, you'll be able to play a plethora of games using Evercade cartridges. While that means picking up physical releases separately, that's all part of the appeal, and there's 300 games out there across 35 boxed carts. Of course, unlike other Evercade handhelds, the Super Pocket also has a built in library, meaning you'll either have 12 Capcom classics or 18 Taito arcade adventures to play right off the bat.\n\nRead more: Super Pocket review\n\nThe best retro gaming handheld\n\nMiss the glory days of the Game Boy? Well, the Evercade EXP is a modern handheld that runs retro classics using shiny new cartridges. It's a must have for anyone that's looking for a truly plug and play experience, not to mention the fact it's helping preserve physical gaming and access to old favorites.\n\nFeatures: Equipped with a 4.3-inch display 480p display, the Evercade EXP is a retro console through and through. The console's main selling point is its growing library of available cartridges, which come with integrated emulators designed specifically for their included games. Each release features a collection of oldies by publishers like Capcom and iREM, and the experience provided is ultimately pretty authentic.\n\nDesign: In spite of its Game Boy cartridge vibes, the Evercade EXP looks pretty modern. That's largely thanks to its clean white colorway and landscape layout, but its D-pad and traditional face buttons feel like consoles from the past. Naturally, that's a good thing when you're revisiting Sega Mega Drive and SNES games on different hardware, and the setup avoids feeling uncanny.\n\nPerformance: The Evercade platform is renowned for providing accurate access to classic games, and the EXP is no exception. Sure, methods like FPGA can provide 100% accuracy compared to emulation, but Blaze's built in emulators are the next best thing, especially if you'd rather not mess around with ROMs and settings. Even some official releases come with slow down and slightly off sounding music, so the fact the Evercade delivers almost perfect ports is pretty spectacular.\n\nGames: There are now over 300 games across 35 Evercade cartridges that'll work with the EXP, and the company has even more on the way. Better still, some of the carts actually feature brand new retro releases rather than classics, meaning you'll be able to tap into the indie scene without going near a PC or modern console.\n\nRead more: Evercade EXP review\n\nThe best remote play handheld\n\nLike it or not, the PlayStation Portal isn't going to win in a fight against most other handhelds. However, it will provide you with a comfortable, reliable way to play PS5 games using remote play, and while other devices can provide the same service, Sony's official solution currently holds the crown. For how long is a different matter entirely, but we'll let it enjoy its victory for now.\n\nFeatures: The PS Portal is effectively an 8-inch LCD screen sandwiched between two halves of a DualSense controller, and that's a tasty setup for anyone solely looking to play PS5 games. While the handheld itself fully relies on the PS5 in terms of gameplay, it will furnish your fingers with full-sized controls, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers, so it'll feel like you're playing your PlayStation 5. I mean, that's because you are, but it'll feel more authentic than using an alternative third-party device.\n\nDesign: Again, the PlayStation Portal simply looks like tablet fused together with a Dualsense, and its overall aesthetic is in keeping with the PS5's vibe. Naturally, that means its going to look fantastic next to your console setup, but it also prioritises ergonomics over portability. This makes sense given that it's designed to be used at home within reach of your PS5, rather than venturing with your in your backpack.\n\nPerformance: Your milage will vary based on your broadband connection, but if you use a reliable network, you'll be able to stream PS5 games with next to no lag. You will potentially run into issues if you choose to also download games to your console while playing, but you shouldn't experience any issues if you avoid doing that. Naturally, frame rates and visual performance is intrinsic to whatever you're actually trying to play using the PS5 itself, meaning any shortcomings are its fault rather than the handheld's.\n\nGames: The Portal will be able to stream any game you can run on your PS5, meaning it technically has access to your entire library. You won't be able to stream games using Sony's cloud gaming service, and apps like Netflix and Crunchyroll are also off limits, so keep that in mind if you're hoping for a handheld solution to those features. Just keep in mind that when you use the PlayStation Portal, you're effectively just playing your PS5 using a wireless screen, meaning you're not getting access to an entire new platform.\n\nRead more: Logitech G Cloud review\n\nThe best mobile gaming handheld\n\nThe Razer Edge won't be for everyone, but it certainly caters to mobile gaming fans looking for a more console-like experience. Thanks to its powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 processor and included Kishi controller, this portable can run all the latest Android games and save you from wrestling with virtual on screen controls.\n\nFeatures: The Edge is effectively a small Android tablet that is made to fit its included Razer Kishi controller, meaning it feels more like a tailored way to play mobile games. Most of the device is dominated by an extra wide 144Hz AMOLED screen that's also a big bigger than what most gaming phones can offer.\n\nDesign: As touched on above, the Edge is mostly screen, and rounded bezels help give it a unique, if not slightly obscure look. It's pretty lightweight compared to chonky handhelds like the Steam Deck, but almost feels like a smaller Switch in terms of size and weight.\n\nPerformance: The Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 within the edge makes short work of both Android games and emulated classics, with frame rates maxed out in each app we tried. Active cooling means there's a better chance of running demanding romps like Black Desert without scaling back settings, and Call of Duty Mobile happily runs at 120Hz. If you're looking for higher spec experiences, apps like GeForce Now will provide cloud access to PC games, and connectivity is pretty robust over Wi-Fi compared to some smartphones.\n\nGames: There's a good reason the Edge is our favorite mobile gaming handheld, and it's thanks to its Google Play access. You should be able to run every game on the storefront, and Razer's integrated button mapping software will let to bridge the gap between on screen and physical controls. Of course, Play Store compatibility also means you'll have access to emulators and streaming services, so you can, in theory, run games from multiple platforms.\n\nRead more: Razer Edge Review\n\nThe best cloud gaming handheld\n\nThe realm of cloud streaming has a long way to go, but the Logitech G Cloud serves as a reliable way to access services like GeForce Now and Game Pass Ultimate. Its integrated controls and 1080p screen help win us over in spite of its inherent caveats, and there are benefits to ditching native hardware when gaming on the go.\n\nFeatures: Armed with a Snapdragon 720G CPU, the Logitech G Cloud uses the power of streaming to bring games to its 1080p 60Hz display. It comes with all the usual bells and whistles you'd expect from a portable, namely Bluetooth 5.1, Wi-Fi, USB-C charging, and a microSD card slot, but there's not much else going on under the hood. That's to be expected given it's effectively just a tablet with rather nice buttons and thumb sticks attached, and that's not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the experience at hand.\n\nDesign: At least from the front, you'd be forgiven for thinking the G Cloud was a fully fledged gaming handheld. While it's hard to deny its similarities to a tablet, its white and yellow aesthetic and array of buttons and thumb sticks really look the part, and the device feels just as nice in the hands. Each button is clicky and responsive, not to mention its 1080p touch screen is bright and surprisingly vivid. Weighing in at just 463g, you'll also immediately notice a different compared to hearty handhelds like the Steam Deck, with the lightness ultimately contributing to overall comfort.\n\nPerformance: Admittedly, measuring G Cloud performance is a little tricky given it's not really running games by itself. However, while testing the streaming handheld, we found its connectivity to be reliable, and services like GeForce now delivered a high end PC grade experience to our fingers and thumbs. We inevitably had to keep our testing indoors to actually achieve this, but it serves as an excellent way to play games in bed if that's your cup of tea.\n\nGames: The G Cloud itself isn't solely to blame, but games selection is a bit of a sore spot when it comes to streaming. Not only will you need to pay for multiple services depending on the releases you're looking for, but not every title is available on their respective storefronts. Using Steam Link will provide you with everything installed on your gaming PC, and we managed to turn the G Cloud into a makeshift PlayStation Portal. Nevertheless, your selection is going to feel pretty narrow compared to some handhelds out there, at least for the time being.\n\nRead more: Logitech G Cloud review\n\nThe best Android handheld\n\nOut of all the Android handhelds we've tried, the Ayn Odin 2 sets the bar higher with excellent emulation capabilities and delightful hardware. In fact, if you're not fussed about running PC games, we reckon this handheld makes for a killer alternative to the Steam Deck.\n\nFeatures: Armed with a large 7-inch 1080p display and a Qualcom Kyro chip, the Odin 2 has visuals and power on its side. It also comes with Android 13 installed, meaning you'll be able to install all your favorite emulators and apps without workarounds. That's a huge win for anyone who prefers to play their old physical collection on a modern device, as you'll have everything at your disposal to enjoy the classics using modern console hardware.\n\nUnlike many of its rivals, the Odin 2 comes armed with hall effect joysticks, meaning stick drift should never be an issue. It's even got a few back buttons for good measure, which makes up for the fact the face buttons aren't the best.\n\nDesign: Just like most handhelds out there right now, the Odin 2 opts for a horizontal approach. Those of you who love the Gameboy might not vibe with that, but anyone who usually games on a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck will feel right at home. Despite its broader approach to layout, it avoids feeling too heavy or clunky, not to mention its curved body is a win in terms of ergonomics.\n\nPerformance: From the PSP and Dreamcast to much newer systems, the Odin 2 makes short work of most emulation tasks. You'll be able to run most of the demanding greats on this handheld at full speed without much issue, and while mini PCs like the Steam Deck still have an edge, it won't leave you longing for better performance in most scenarios. You won't even have to dial back resolution, resulting in an experience that isn't available on original hardware.\n\nGames: Since the Odin 2 is an Android handheld, you'll be able to run the latest mobile games without a hitch. However, most players eyeing up Ayn's handheld are going to have emulation on their mind, and we can confirm this portable will happy run most retro games from the 8-bit era right up to more demanding 32-bit releases. Put it this way, we've yet to run something on this device that isn't at the very least playable, and what we'd expect from a premium emulation machine with powerhouse guts.\n\nRead more: Ayn Odin 2 review\n\nJargon buster: gaming handheld terms explained\n\nJust like with other gadgets and gizmos, deciphering gaming handheld jargon can be overwhelming. While not every portable console out there features complicated innards, devices like the Steam Deck can feel like a technical minefield. So, to help keep you in the know with commonly used terminology, we've got a handy glossary of words and a simplistic breakdown of what they mean:\n\nAPU: Short for \"Accelerated Processing Unit\", these all-in-one chips serve as both a handheld CPU and GPU, providing both graphics and processing power to conserve space.\n\nSystem on a chip (SoC): Just like an APU, a system on a chip can perform multiple functions rather than using separate components. For example, some cheap emulation devices out there use an SoC to mimic the functionality of entire classic consoles like the NES.\n\nEmulation: A word used to describe when software mimics another console to run a specific game. Emulators for a whole host of retro systems are available and will work on many gaming handhelds as well as PCs, smartphones, and even other new-gen consoles, but 100% compatibility and performance are never a guarantee.\n\nFPGA: Short for \"Field Programmable Gate Arrays\", this term refers to systems that can mimic retro consoles using hardware rather than software. Compared to standard emulation, FPGA devices can perfectly replicate the circuitry within an old device, in turn maximizing compatibility and stability. For example, the Analogue Pocket uses the same tech to act exactly like an original Game Boy.\n\nHall-effect joysticks: Also known as hall-sensor joysticks, this is a phrase that describes the technology used to sense thumbstick movements. Unlike the sticks used with the likes of the Switch, these alternatives use a contactless design and magnets instead of a physical gimbal, which in turn avoids issues like stick drift.\n\nHandheld gaming PC: A generic term used to describe portable devices that feature integrated controls and components similar to a PC or laptop. Most options out there will come with Windows 11 pre-installed, meaning you can technically run most games you'd normally play on a desktop computer. The Steam Deck is the exception to this as it runs a custom version of Linux, but you're still looking at full system functionality in a console-shaped package.\n\nROMs: A historic term that refers to \"Read-only Memory\" chips traditionally used to store games on cartridges. Backups of these old games are referred to ROMs for this reason, so you'll often hear the word used to describe the files used by emulation software.\n\nWatt Hours (Wh): Often used to measure battery life, Watt Hours are commonly used to highlight how long a device will run on a single charge. Your mileage will vary depending on the game you're running, but you can effectively use the figure to measure how long your handheld will last at a specific wattage.\n\nBest gaming handheld - FAQ\n\nWhich handheld has the best games?\n\nMost gaming handhelds feature support for different storefronts. For example, if you're looking to play the latest Mario and Zelda adventures, you'll have to opt for a Nintendo Switch, while portable PCs like the Steam Deck serve as a portable to your Steam backlog. Whether or not Nintendo games are better than PC is up for debate, and you should pick the handheld that has games appealing to your personal tastes.\n\nWhat is the best portable device for gaming?\n\nIn terms of power, handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, and upcoming Lenovo Legion GO are the best. That said, not everyone is looking to boost fps or play Steam games, which is why cheaper handheld consoles like the Nintendo Switch have a wider spread appeal.\n\nIs the Steam Deck worth it in 2024?\n\nThe Steam Deck is a fantastic option for players with an existing Steam library, as lots of games will work with Valve's portable PC. That said, alternatives like the Asus ROG Ally and upcoming Lenovo Legion GO boast full PC compatibility and better specs, so it's worth weighting up your options and budget.\n\nWhat is the best alternative to the Switch?\n\nOut of all the handhelds available right now, the Steam Deck is probably the best alternative. While you won't be able to access the usual collection of Ninty romps, you will have free reign over Valve's vast storefront. That also means you'll be able to run the latest games and plenty of indie capers either on the go or using a docking station at home.\n\nHow we test gaming handhelds at GamesRadar+\n\nWe've got a expert team of gaming handheld enthusiasts on standby who put the newest portable devices through their paces. While benchmarks vary depending on the type of device being reviewed, we typically use a set selection of games to test performance while evaluating aspects like specs, features, and design. Doing so enables us to make recommendations, share what we like and dislike about each handheld gaming PC and console, and judge whether it's good value for money.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about how we all the tech, peripherals, and accessories we review , check out our Hardware Policy for more information."
