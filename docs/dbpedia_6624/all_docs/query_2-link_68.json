Watch our new gameplay showcase to see it in action. Note: This contains some spoilers!\n\nWe hope you enjoy discovering all that Hades II in Early Access has to offer! It already includes more environments, foes, and fully-voiced characters than the full version of the original game, and we have more in the works. An in-game development roadmap provides additional details about our update plans.\n\nFor owners of Steam Deck, Valve's portable gaming computer, we're pleased to report Hades II is Deck Verified!\n\nAbout Hades II\n\nHades II is a rogue-like dungeon crawler in which you'll battle beyond the Underworld of Greek myth using dark sorcery to take on the sinister Titan of Time. It builds on the best aspects of the award-winning original in an all-new, action-packed, endlessly replayable experience rooted in Greek myth and its deep connections to the dawn of witchcraft.\n\nAs the immortal Princess of the Underworld, you'll explore a bigger, deeper mythic world, vanquishing the Titan's forces with the full might of Olympus behind you, in a sweeping story that continually unfolds through your every setback and accomplishment. New locations, challenges, upgrade systems, and surprises await as you delve into the ever-shifting Underworld again and again. For more information, check our Hades II FAQ.\n\nAbout Early Access\n\nThis Early Access launch is an extraordinarily exciting moment for our team as we begin the process that we expect will help us realize this game's potential. As with the original, we designed Hades II for Early Access from the ground up, and look forward to hearing your feedback about all that we've built so far, and integrating that feedback into our plans for the rest of production! This is a game with many interconnected parts, and your feedback helps us ensure everything from the balance to the narrative are working as well as possible.\n\nShould you play in Early Access, or wait for the full game? For many players, it's a good idea to wait for the complete v1.0 before diving in, as Hades II will grow and improve during Early Access, and the true ending of the story won't be available until then. But, if you like the idea of seeing the game evolve over time, and watching the story unfold more gradually, then Early Access is probably for you!\n\nYou may also want to hold out for the v1.0 launch depending on which platform you'd like to play on, as Early Access is only on Steam and the Epic Games Store. We expect Hades II to eventually be available for PC, Mac, and console platforms (though cannot confirm which platforms yet).\n\nThe Hades II Original Soundtrack\n\nMusic has always been essential to the experience of each title from Supergiant Games, and Hades II is no exception, with an original soundtrack by our award-winning composer Darren Korb crafted to fit the bewitching theme and variety of all-new characters and environments.\n\nNow available alongside the game (and for free streaming on our YouTube channel!), the soundtrack is already nearly as expansive as the original, with close to two-and-a-half hours of new music... and still more tracks to be added as development continues. Note: We recommend first experiencing our soundtracks in-game prior to listening on their own!\n\nWhat's Next\n\nWe're planning our first Major Update for later this year! Please note while we'll be monitoring feedback and reports carefully, this Major Update will take some months following our initial launch. Beyond that, we expect to be in Early Access at least through the end of 2024 in order to build out the remaining content we have planned.\n\nAs we take stock of the state of the game and what you think of it, we'll gain a clearer sense of just how close we are to the finish line. For now, it's too early to say when our v1.0 launch will be. Yet even though Hades II won't be complete for some time, we hope you really enjoy it as soon as you start playing.\n\nLastly: Thank you. This year our studio turns 15 years old, and for all this time we've remained small and independent, working on one major new project after another. None of this would have been possible without the support of our players over the years. So, whether Hades II is your first Supergiant game, or you've been with us since the Bastion days, we're grateful you could join us.\n\nUpdate, April 26: Thank you very much for your patience as we conducted the Hades II Technical Test. The Test helped us identify and address a number of key technical issues we weren't able to find before, in preparation to launch Hades II in Early Access. We plan to start winding down the Technical Test on Monday, April 29, after which point it will no longer be available in participants' Steam libraries. However, we plan to launch Hades II in Early Access relatively soon after that, so please stay tuned! We hope you share our excitement for Early Access, and really appreciate your support and encouragement during the Technical Test!\n\nWe're getting close to launching Hades II in Early Access! As noted in our latest Development Update, a key step prior to that is our Hades II Technical Test, which we plan to begin shortly.\n\nAbout the Hades II Technical Test\n\nWe're conducting the Hades II Technical Test prior to our Early Access launch to help us find and solve any technical issues we might have missed thus far, to ensure anyone who tries Hades II in Early Access can have a smooth play experience from the start. The Technical Test contains much less content than what's in store for the Early Access launch, and may be available only to a relatively small subset of players who express interest in participating.\n\nHow to Sign Up\n\nWe are using Steam Playtest to run the Hades II Technical Test. If you'd like to be considered for participation, you can sign up right now simply by heading to the Hades II Steam page, and clicking the button marked 'Request Access'.\n\nIf you're a content creator, you may also request a key using Keymailer, though please note that due to the nature of the Technical Test, we may not be able to honor all such requests.\n\nWho Gets to Participate\n\nA subset of players who request access will be invited to participate via an email from Steam with download instructions. We expect to start with a small player population, then grow it over time. So, even if you aren't invited to the Technical Test right away, you may still be invited later. Our process boils down to: invite some players, fix any problems they run into, invite more players, and so on. Once we're sufficiently confident that things are stable, we'll wind down the Technical Test, then launch in Early Access on Steam and the Epic Games Store relatively soon after. As the purpose of the Technical Test is to test the game with a relatively small audience, we may not be able to honor individual requests to participate. We will do our best to conduct the Technical Test as expeditiously as possible, then launch in Early Access, at which point the game will be available for anyone to purchase and play.\n\nTechnical Test Duration\n\nThe nature of the Test is such that we don't know exactly how long it will last, though our estimate is longer than a week, shorter than a month. We likewise don't know exactly when we will launch Hades II in Early Access, since that will depend on how long we end up having to run the Technical Test for.\n\nTechnical Test System Requirements\n\nHere are the minimum system requirements for the Technical Test: OS: Windows 10 64-bit (or Steam Deck) Processor: Dual Core 2.4 Ghz Memory: 8GB RAM Graphics: GeForce GTX 950, Radeon R7 360, or Intel HD Graphics 630\n\nTechnical Test Contents\n\nThe Technical Test contains the first major area of the game, and other early-game characters, systems, and content. (If you played the original game, imagine a version where you couldn't get past Tartarus even if you vanquished its guardian.) If you end up clearing the first major area a number of times, the game will gently suggest that you discontinue play, as Early Access shouldn't be far behind!\n\nNote that due to structural differences with the Early Access version of the game, save data from the Technical Test will not transfer.\n\nHow Technical Test Participants Can Help\n\nJust play! If you encounter crashes or other technical issues, the game will provide instruction on how to report those to us.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nThank you for your interest in Hades II and this Technical Test! It's important to us to start our forthcoming Early Access with as few technical issues as possible, so that the focus can be on getting your feedback on the game itself. We're very excited to share that game with you soon, and appreciate your patience and support as we prepare!\n\nBack when we first revealed Hades II at The Game Awards in 2022, we said to expect more information on our plans for Early Access sometime in 2023. It's time we shed some light on those plans!\n\nEarly Access Starts Next Year\n\nWe now can confirm we're planning for Hades II to launch in Early Access in Q2 2024 on Steam and the Epic Games Store. We'll have more details on the exact date, pricing, and system requirements closer to that time.\n\nThank you for your patience as we gear up for this launch! You may be wondering, why can't we launch in Early Access, like, right now?! The game looked pretty far along in the first trailer! The reason is, Hades II will have at least as much content from day one in Early Access as the original game did back when it launched in Early Access on Steam. And, even though Early Access inherently means a game is not yet complete, we still want to do everything we can to make sure Hades II is worth your while as soon as you can play it in any capacity.\n\nYou can add Hades II to your wishlist on Steam or the Epic Games Store and join our email mailing list to find out as soon as our Early Access is available.\n\nPrior to That: The Hades II Technical Test\n\nAlso in Q2 2024, shortly before we launch in Early Access, we're going to run a technical test with a limited sample of players. The purpose of this test will be to find and solve any technical or compatibility issues we might have missed, to ensure anyone who tries Hades II in Early Access can have a smooth play experience. To that end, this technical test will contain much less content than what's in store for the Early Access launch, and likely be limited only to a relatively small subset of players who express interest in participating. We'll announce more details about the Hades II Technical Test closer to when it's ready.\n\nMore About Early Access & Beyond\n\nEarly Access was vitally important to the entire idea behind the original Hades -- we decided it would be an Early Access game before deciding literally anything else about it, such as the Underworld setting. We've approached development of Hades II knowing Early Access will be no less important this time, though now knowing a bit more of what to expect from Early Access development, as well as more about what a Hades game needs to be. We believe the timeframe we're planning for will be the \"sweet spot\" where the game is far enough along that player feedback won't mostly consist of stuff we already know isn't there yet, but isn't so far along that it's too late in development for us to act on the feedback we receive.\n\nSimilar to how we approached Early Access with the original, following our Hades II Early Access launch, we'll have several Major Updates adding the rest of the game's core content and refining what's there based on player feedback. The story will expand with each update, as we introduce more characters, and deepen relationships with existing ones. This process will culminate in our v1.0 launch, which will feature the conclusion to the story and any other finishing touches.\n\nWe don't yet know exactly how long it will take us to get to v1.0 of Hades II, as our experience developing in Early Access has taught us (among many things) to expect the unexpected. For now, our focus is to keep building core content -- environments, characters, weapons, Boons, story events, music, and more -- as we gear up for our Technical Test and Early Access launch in Q2 this coming year. Thank you again for your patience and support as we work to ensure our first sequel meets our standards, and hopefully yours, too!\n\nNote: For all the latest details we can share about Hades II, please check our Hades II FAQ.\n\nWords cannot express how excited we are to unveil Hades II, our studio's fifth game and first-ever sequel! Meet the Princess of the Underworld in our reveal trailer, which premiered tonight at The Game Awards:\n\nIn Hades II, you'll battle beyond the Underworld using dark sorcery as you take on the sinister Titan of Time in an all-new, action-packed, endlessly replayable experience rooted in the Underworld of Greek myth and its deep connections to the dawn of witchcraft.\n\nAvailability & Early Access\n\nWe will announce when Hades II will be available and for which platforms closer to when it's complete. The game is in full production right now, though we have a lot left to build!\n\nLike its predecessor, Hades II will be available in Early Access for some time leading up to its full v1.0 launch. Expect more information on Hades II Early Access sometime in 2023.\n\nAdd Hades II to your wishlist on Steam or the Epic Games Store to be among the first to know about our Early Access when the time comes.\n\nAbout the Game\n\nHades II is a direct sequel taking place sometime after the events of the original game. No prior knowledge of the original Hades is needed, though there are plenty of connections!\n\nAs Melinoë, the immortal Princess of the Underworld, you'll explore a bigger, deeper mythic world, vanquishing the Titan's forces with the full might of Olympus behind you, in a sweeping story that continually unfolds through your every setback and accomplishment. New locations, challenges, upgrade systems, and surprises await as you delve into the ever-shifting Underworld again and again. Like her brother Zagreus from the original game, Melinoë is not a character of our own invention, and is based on an ancient Underworld deity thought to be related to Hades. What little ancient mythology exists about her was more than enough to make us want to explore her story and connection to her family, and in so doing, expand on our vision of the Underworld!\n\nRead our Hades II FAQ for answers to many of your questions about the game. Please note, much like with our past titles, we plan to leave many details for you to discover!\n\nWe also invite you to join our mailing list, which we'll use to occasionally email you with information about how Hades II is coming along and other news from our studio.\n\nAbout Supergiant Games\n\nWe are a small independent game studio based in San Francisco, CA. Since 2009, we have strived to make games that spark your imagination like the games you played as a kid. We now have more than 20 people on our team (a few more than on the original Hades), including all seven of the original members of the team that created our first game, Bastion, who have worked together in their respective roles on all our games ever since.\n\nWe work on one main new game project at a time, and Hades II is that project for the foreseeable future. The original Hades earned more than 70 Game of the Year awards following its v1.0 launch in 2020, and is our most successful game in every measurable way. Now, we are doing our best to make a sequel that lives up to its predecessor, and stands strong on its own merits. Your generous support is the reason we've been able to stick together as a team all this time, so thank you very much for believing in us and for your patience as we develop this game!\n\nLast Updated May 6, 2024: Here are answers to frequently asked questions about our fifth game, Hades II! This FAQ is a comprehensive source of official details we can share about the game. We plan to update it with new information through the course of development.\n\nWhat is Hades II?\n\nHades II is a rogue-like dungeon crawler in which you'll battle beyond the Underworld of Greek myth using dark sorcery to take on the sinister Titan of Time. Our studio's first-ever sequel builds on the best aspects of the award-winning original in an all-new, action-packed, endlessly replayable experience rooted in the Underworld of Greek myth and its deep connections to the dawn of witchcraft. Read our announcement and watch our reveal trailer:\n\nAs the immortal Princess of the Underworld, you'll explore a bigger, deeper mythic world, vanquishing the forces of the Titan of Time with the full might of Olympus behind you, in a sweeping story that continually unfolds through your every setback and accomplishment. New locations, challenges, upgrade systems, and surprises await as you delve into the ever-shifting Underworld again and again. See the game in action here (note this contains some spoilers):\n\nWhere can I play Hades II?\n\nHades II is now available in Early Access on: · Steam · Epic Games Store\n\nHades II is also Verified on Steam Deck, Valve's portable gaming computer.\n\nWe do not have a release date set for the completed Hades II v1.0, and expect to be in Early Access at least through the end of 2024. We expect for Hades II to eventually be available for PC, Mac, and console platforms (though cannot confirm which platforms yet).\n\nHow much does Hades II cost?\n\nWe are offering Hades II in Early Access for the retail price of $29.99 USD (with variance by region). Note that depending on the duration of Early Access and the scope of additional content we add to Hades II over time, we may raise the retail price at a later point.\n\nIf you purchase the game in Early Access, you'll automatically receive the complete v1.0 once it's available (you won't have to purchase the game again).\n\nWhat can I expect from Hades II Early Access?\n\nEarly Access means you can purchase and play a work-in-progress version of Hades II, and optionally contribute feedback and gameplay data that's invaluable to our team as we work to fulfill the game's potential. Feedback from our player community through the course of development was foundational to the design and vital to the quality of the original game, so we are reprising that type of process with Hades II.\n\nThe game already has at least as much content in Early Access as the original did back when it launched in Early Access on Steam. And, even though Early Access inherently means a game is not yet complete, we have done our best to ensure Hades II will be worth your while as soon as you play it.\n\nSimilar to how we approached Early Access with the original, following our Hades II Early Access launch, we'll have several Major Updates adding the rest of the game's core content and refining what's there based on player feedback. The story will expand with each update, as we introduce more characters and add events with existing ones. This process will culminate in our v1.0 launch, which will feature the conclusion to the story and other finishing touches.\n\nIf you start playing Hades II Early Access, we are committed to making sure your save data works all through development, including once we launch v1.0.\n\nShould I play in Early Access, or hold off?\n\nFor many players, it's a good idea to wait for the complete v1.0 before diving in, as we expect Hades II to grow and improve during Early Access, and the true ending of the story won't be available until then. But, if you like the idea of seeing the game evolve over time, and watching the story unfold more gradually, then Early Access is probably for you!\n\nYou may also want to hold out for v1.0 depending on which platform you'd like to play on, as Early Access is only on Steam and the Epic Games Store.\n\nWhere can I get tech support for Hades II?\n\nWe have a comprehensive Hades II Technical Support FAQ that's the best place to start if you're experiencing any issues with the game!\n\nHow does Hades II relate to the original game?\n\nHades II is a direct sequel, set in and around the Underworld of Greek myth after the events of the original game. Chronos, the Titan of Time and the wicked father of Hades and his brothers, has escaped his imprisonment in the depths of the Underworld to wage war on Olympus. Can Time itself be stopped?\n\nYou don't need to know anything about the original game or Greek myth to enjoy Hades II. But if you do know the ins and outs of the original game or the classical mythology that inspired it, you'll find plenty of connections, as well as plenty of new challenges you'll have to learn to overcome. We want for players to experience a strong sense of discovery in Hades II, whether they are experienced with the original game or not.\n\nWho is the protagonist of Hades II?\n\nIn Hades II, you play as Melinoë, the Princess of the Underworld, an immortal witch and sorceress with powerful magical abilities, deadly skill with a variety of shadowy weapons, and a score to settle.\n\nLike her brother Zagreus from the original game, Melinoë is not a character of our own invention, and is based on an ancient Underworld deity thought to be related to Hades. What little ancient mythology exists about her was more than enough to make us want to explore her story and connection to her family, and in so doing, expand on our vision of the Underworld.\n\nWhat's the connection between witchcraft and Greek myth?\n\nWitchcraft is integral to numerous Greek myths, including some of the most famous, as well as many that inspired the original Hades and of course this sequel. Central to this ancient and oft-feared and misunderstood practice is Hecate, the secretive goddess of magic, witchcraft, and the crossroads. She plays a significant role in classical mythology surrounding Hades and the Underworld, and has been an influential and deeply compelling figure in witchcraft, myth, and folklore in a variety of cultures for thousands of years... so much so that we felt we needed a whole new game to try and do her justice.\n\nAs with the original game, our aim is to be faithful to the spirit of the classical sources that inspired us, from Homer to Hesiod. This extends to our portrayal of witchcraft in this game, given its strong ties to many of the myths and characters at the heart of both Hades and Hades II. Mythological tales of ancient gods and heroes live on by being told and retold, adapted, and filtered through new points of view across time; we're excited to share ours once again.\n\nIs the game's soundtrack available?\n\nAbsolutely! Music has always been essential to the experience of each of our games, and Hades II is no exception, with an original soundtrack by our award-winning composer Darren Korb crafted to fit the bewitching theme and variety of all-new characters and environments.\n\nLike the game itself, the soundtrack is not yet complete, and we expect to keep adding to it through the course of Early Access development. Look for it wherever the game is sold, or stream it free on our YouTube channel or Spotify!\n\nWho is developing Hades II?\n\nWe are! We're Supergiant Games, a small independent game studio based in San Francisco, CA. Since 2009, we have strived to make games that spark your imagination like the games you played as a kid. We now have close to 25 people on our team (a few more than on the original Hades), including all seven of the original members of the team that created our first game, Bastion, and worked together on all our games ever since. We work on one main new game project at a time, and Hades II is that project for the foreseeable future.\n\nYou've never made a sequel before! Why now?\n\nThe original Hades is our most beloved game, and one that we loved building together as a team. Especially since it drew so much inspiration from classical Greek mythology, we always imagined the possibility of new stories in its world. But that in and of itself wasn't enough for us.\n\nWith each of our projects over the years, we've aimed to take on a new challenge that stretched our team's creativity and taught us more about how to make games well together. One such challenge we've long considered was to try and make a sequel that could somehow re-capture the sense of wonder and delight of its predecessor. Some of our all-time favorite games achieved this! The question is, can we? Hades II, with its new perspective on a shadowy and alluring aspect of Greek myth, is our opportunity to find out. We get to keep building on foundational ideas that have captivated us since Supergiant's early days, while expanding the world of Hades in ways we find very exciting, and hope you will, too.\n\nWhat languages does the game support?\n\nHades II contains English text and voiceover, and includes full text translations in the following languages: German, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.\n\nHow long has Hades II been in development?\n\nWe started working on Hades II in earnest at the start of 2021.\n\nWhat tech are you using to develop the game?\n\nWe've been using our own tech and tools ever since Bastion, our first game. With each project, we've made significant investments and improvements to ensure our tools are as efficient as possible for our team, and that our game runs as smoothly as possible for as many players as possible.\n\nIs Hades II a multiplayer game, or are there any plans for multiplayer?\n\nLike its predecessor, Hades II is a single-player game. We have no plans for multiplayer, as we are creating the gameplay and narrative of Hades II with a solo experience in mind.\n\nWho created your animated reveal trailer?\n\nWe collaborated with Studio Grackle on our animated reveal trailer for Hades II. We first teamed up with them for our Hades v1.0 Launch Trailer, and had such a good experience that we knew we wanted to work with them again to introduce Hades II to the world. The credits for the trailer, including voice talent for characters featured in it, are in the full description on YouTube.\n\nWill you work with Noclip again on a video documentary about Hades II's development?\n\nWe loved working with Noclip on their Developing Hell video documentary series about the making of the original Hades, filmed throughout the course of its development. We've kept in touch with Noclip about our plans, though presently aren't doing something like last time. We appreciate your interest!\n\nWhat if I have more questions?\n\nWe expect to keep updating this FAQ from time to time as development continues. Or if you'd like to discuss Hades II, one good place is our official Discord server, where you can chat with other players and get the latest news from our team. Thank you for your interest!"
