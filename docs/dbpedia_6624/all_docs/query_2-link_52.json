This new mode has been adapted for two players from the multiplayer format by using strategically-placed barbed wire to reduce the surface area of the combat zone.\n\n- New unlockable content: the Killzone: Liberation disc will link via the PSP browser directly to Killzone.com. Successful completion of an in-game level will allow the user to access the site and access extra content. Players without immediate access to wireless internet can record progress direct to memory stick allowing you to download the content when you're in a wireless hotspot.\n\n- Extra level in \"Challenge Game\" mode, Chapter 5 takes place in the underground labyrinth beneath Sedah City. Infrastructure mode is also included.\n\n- From Killzone.com: \"Squad sergeant Rico is missing – you must discover the truth of his fate over four high-tension missions consisting of over two hours of brand-new gameplay with new terrain to explore, new vehicles to control and swarms of Helghast to eliminate. Chapter 5 also comes with two brand new multiplayer maps for both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure Mode: Prison and Construction Site.\"\n\nPut the UCUS98646 or UCES00279 folder in the PSP/GAME folder. In the XMB you will now have a \"Killzone Liberation Installer\" icon. If you delete it, all the updates will disappear from the game. Start the game normally and scroll down to \"Downloads\". When the browser opens and tells you about not having enough memory (the official site has changed a lot after the release of Killzone 3, so it's their fault if it doesn't work anymore), just press the Circle button twice (one time to close the previous message, and another time on the blank page) and the update should start. Choose \"Yes\" when prompted, then it should exit automatically and restart the game. After that, you'll see the number of the new update in the main menu. To play Chapter 5, you have to finish the previous ones first. Also, the previous savegames won't be compatible after installing these updates.\n\nOriginal instructions from Killzone website 2018:\n\nStart Killzone: Liberation and go to the ‘Downloads’ option in the main menu. The PSP web browser will open. Cancel and exit the browser by pressing the ’Circle’ button. Killzone: Liberation will detect the new content and attempt to install it.You’re done! Note that there will now be a new “Killzone: Liberation Update” icon in the Memory Stick section of your XMB; please do not delete it, as this will prevent you from accessing Chapter Five.\n\n~Kiniro No Corda 3 DLC [ULJM05624]~\n\nContent:\n\nIncludes three extra scenarios which include the male characters of the cast, with special stills and love messages.

Read here for more info: http://taikotime.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-end-of-era-taiko-no-tatsujin.html\n\nContent:\n\nIncludes 44 new songs.\n\nNote: I've seen some messages here, and the FAQ, that say Bandai Namco disabled song downloads over PC, but I tried it today and it worked (they show up in the actual in-game play lists, not just that menu screen that shows which song files are present on your memory card). You *have* to make sure that you access Bandai Namco's download page from the download.htm file that the game installs in the psp\\savedata\\ppcd00765_taiko2_dl folder on your PSP's memory card; you can't just type in the normal URL to their download site, because it won't have the unique key necessary for your copy of the game to\n\nrecognize the songs you download. If you've accessed their site correctly--from the download.htm on your memory card--you'll see \"key=[long alphanumeric string]\" at the end of the URL in your address bar. This probably also means that songs that someone else downloaded will not work on your PSP; you have to use the download.htm that your copy of the game creates, and download them yourself. I think. n any case, if you downloaded the songs via PC some other way and they aren't working, start the game, re-run the menu item that installs the download.htm and other files on your card, load the download.htm from the card into your computer's browser, and then download the songs that way. Also, I'm fairly sure that if you do re-run the installer menu item in the game, it will invalidate any songs you already had downloaded, so you'll have to go download them again.\n\n~Taiko no Tatsujin Portable DX DLC [NPJH50426]~\n\nContent:\n\nIncludes 105 new songs and other stuff.\n\n~Tekken 6 Ghost Data Pack [ULUS10466]~\n\nNote: Ghost Data is not a DLC, it's someone else's Ghost Character, this mimics his/her battle style for you to battle against it. You can make your own and fight it too, you can upload yours to the internet so anyone can battle it. I don't know how many of these you can have at a time, so try it for your own.

Remember to include your main save data I need this for data exchanging.\n\n(as I said, too old for download and something)\n\nIs there any other way to create friend ghost data when you have one psp\n\nSadly no you need 2 psp it very irritating but there no other way.\"\n\nNEW: You can use the emulator PPSSPP for this!\n\n=============================\n\n|Nº |Character |Rank |Player |\n\n==================================\n\n|1 |Leo |Tekken God |sTriVing2win |\n\n|2 |Lars |Tekken God |sTriVing2win |\n\n|3 |Steve |Tekken God |sTriVing2win |\n\n|4 |Bob |Tekken God |secreTAgent+ |\n\n|5 |Heihachi |Tekken God |MR.]E[HT |\n\n|6 |Xiaoyu |Tekken God |MR.]E[HT |\n\n|7 |Devil Jin |Tekken God |MR.]E[HT |\n\n|8 |Asuka |Tekken God |MR.]E[HT |\n\n|9 |Bob |Tekken God |MR.]E[HT |\n\n|10 |Lili |Tekken God |MR.]E[HT |\n\n|11 |Christie |Tekken God |BANMODE |\n\n|12 |Jin |Tekken God |SIX PATHS |\n\n|13 |Bruce |Tekken God |MR.]E[HT |\n\n|14 |Yoshimitsu |Tekken God |MR.]E[HT |\n\n|15 |Marduk |Dragon Lord |MR.]E[HT |\n\n|16 |Steve |Tekken God |BANMODE |\n\n|17 |Lee |Rajin |c=[--------- |\n\n|18 |Armored King |Tekken God |rpL://(sic) |\n\n|19 |Steve |Tekken God |<R|R>Elvin |\n\n|20 |Kazuya |Tekken God |-Jakh- |\n\n|21 |Bob |Tekken God |ROB_17 |\n\n|22 |Kazuya |Tekken God |Poyohebat |\n\n|23 |Bob |Dragon Lord |c=[--------- |\n\n|24 |Dragunov |Tekken God |eninenoxis |\n\n|25 |Bruce |Warrior |+dArKSsIyAN+ |\n\n|26 |Miguel |Tekken God |Raykasha RVS |\n\n|27 |Christie |Tekken God |Maraxus |\n\n|28 |Lei |Tekken God |Maraxus |\n\n|29 |Bryan |Tekken God |..:Kenesu:.. |\n\n|30 |Lili |Tekken God |..:Kenesu:.. |\n\n|31 |Bryan |Vindicator |c'mON |\n\n|32 |Lili |Tekken God |allen |\n\n|33 |Bob |Tekken God |..:Kenesu:.. |\n\n|34 |Baek |Tekken God |rpL://(sic) |\n\n|35 |Anna |Tekken God |..:Kenesu:.. |\n\n|36 |Devil Jin |Tekken God |-Jakh- |\n\n|37 |Eddy |Tekken God |Maraxus |\n\n|38 |Jin |Tekken God |mc9!! |\n\n|39 |Kazuya |Tekken Emperor |c=(-->Gaijin |\n\n|40 |Mokujin |Tekken God |~ JECHT ~ |\n\n=======================================================​\n\nMalckyor's note: For you asking where's my ghost data.\n\nI'm not a Tekken player, so I don't have it because I suck in this game, but someday I'll learn how to play it then I'll make and share mine.\n\n~Tekken Dark Resurrection Ghost Data Pack~\n\nGhost files MIMIC a user's playing style based on collecting information on how the user fights.\n\nYou still can get the ghost data from players in this site where I got them (there are more than 1000+ ghosts):\n\nhttp://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/forums/ghostlist.php\n\nThanks for all the player that shared them, I'll gladly take them!\n\nI got here a few of the most downloaded ghosts in the community.

(Tenchu: Shadow Assassins won't work with these missions). Since the missions in the pack aren't labeled, if a particular mission isn't working for you, it probably wasn't meant for your game version/region.\n\nThanks to all the developers and level editors that submitted their custom maps over the years. We appreciate your support and hope you enjoy this final download.\"\n\nTenchuMissions was a project run by Omar Radwan and its purpose was to be a repository for creators to share their custom missions. It took the shape of a forum, where other users could comment on and rate entries. At some point after its initial closure, the Tenchu Missions website was hosted by OpenPublic Networks. Although the website itself has been down for a number of years, I managed to salvage the mission pack from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. My reason for preserving this pack is a vain and selfish one, as I myself provided many missions when the website was active which are preserved in this mission pack.\n\nTo play these you will need to place the missions in your PSP/SAVE directory, and they must be for the correct version of the game. Most of the missions are not marked with their correct version due to a lack of naming standard for uploads to tenchumissions.com.\n\n-By: SSJ4Pan\n\nNote: It seems that there are 4 official custom missions inside the japanese pack version in this file.\n\nThank you SSJ4Pan for these files, if you somehow manage to see this someday, know that I have these files too and I'll share them and the \"tora2ndprize 5.zip\" is damaged and can't be extracted.\n\n~The Eye of Judgment Legends & The Eye of Judgment Shintaku no Wizard DLC~\n\nContent:\n\nIncludes the following cards:\n\n* Master Pack\n\n- Child of Mourning (a rare fire demon)\n\n- Child of Okunada (a rare water character of the Merfolk race)\n\n- Hanzo the Leader (an ultra rare character from the Betrayer race)\n\n- Bash-ido Goblin (a common wood goblin)\n\n- Magical Interdiction (a powerful ultra rare spell)\n\n* Protector Pack\n\n- Lizard Shaman Novice (an ultra common fire lizard)\n\n- Summoner Mesmer (an ultra rare water warlord)\n\n- Child of Sanavaan (a rare undead earth character)\n\n- Child of Alchaera (a rare wood elf)\n\n- Yorga's Prayer (an ultra common but handy spell)\n\n* Saviour Pack\n\n- Lotus Queen (a common water character from the Plant race)\n\n- Child of Urmspa (a rare Biolith human)\n\n- Chief Ianna Reed (an ultra rare wood character from the Noble race)\n\n- Child of Yorga (a rare, sacred character affixed to no element)\n\n- Venoa Conference (a rare ritual spell)\n\n* Redeemable Cards\n\n- Commander Isshin Nagira (a rare wood character)\n\n- Dragon Rider (a rare character affixed to no element)\n\n- Flame Guru Ghallian (a rare fire character)\n\n- Oracle (a rare Biolith character)\n\n- Tino's Law of Heaven (a rare spell)\n\n~The Idolm@ster Shiny Festa Funky Note, Groovy Tune & Honey Sound DLC [NPJH50674]~\n\nIncludes the following addons:\n\n- First Print DLC: The World is All One!!\n\nThe DLC folder is universal, like SP.
