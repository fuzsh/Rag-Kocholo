        "text": "If you want to game on the go, then the ideal solution is to pick up one of the best handheld games consoles. As much as we love some of the best gaming consoles like the Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PlayStation 5, there is no denying the fact that they’re all pretty heavy and therefore very poorly suited for any kind of portable play.\n\nThankfully, there are now plenty of fantastic handheld alternatives on the market, ranging from those geared towards avid retro gamers to fully-fledged handheld PCs that allow you to play some of the best PC games while you're out and about. Unfortunately, so much choice can make the experience of picking a new system quite overwhelming, so we've created this list of our top picks for the best handheld games consoles in order to to simplify the process.\n\nEach of the entries on this list has been extensively tested and we have carefully considered a wide range of criteria, including offering options for PC gamers who want to make the most of their existing libraries and cheaper products that would be perfect for those on a budget. In addition to providing some expert buying advice, we carefully monitor the latest product releases to ensure that this list remains up to date.\n\nThe Quick List\n\nBest handheld games consoles in 2024\n\nThe best handheld games console overall\n\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED is the best model in the company's current console line-up. While it boasts the same internal specification as the stock Nintendo Switch, the screen has received a substantial upgrade. It is now a larger 7-inch OLED panel that helps the best Nintendo Switch games really pop.\n\nWith its $349.99 / £299.99 asking price, the Nintendo Switch OLED positions itself as much cheaper than many full home consoles. This lower price does have a tangible impact on performance, however, and I found that many recently ported games like Mortal Kombat 1 or Biomutant can really struggle to hold a consistent framerate. This was most noticeable while playing on a TV in docked mode, making it far easier to recommend if you're wholly concerned with portable play.\n\nWith this variant, you're also getting a greatly improved kickstand and upgraded speakers, which leads to a much better experience while playing in handheld mode. All of the original Nintendo Switch library is compatible with the Nintendo Switch OLED too and I've loved my time with the countless incredible exclusive experiences like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Splatoon 3.\n\nRead more: Nintendo Switch OLED review\n\nThe best budget handheld games console\n\nWith its affordable asking price of $199.99 / £200, the Nintendo Switch Lite is our top pick for those who are shopping on a budget. Its smaller form factor is perfect for portable play as it can be quickly shoved into a rucksack or even a large pocket when you're on the move. There are also a range of attractive bright colors to choose from including blue, pink, purple, grey, and yellow.\n\nThe design is constructed out of a thick plastic and, in our testing, proved more durable than the original Nintendo Switch model which is ideal if you're prone to dropping or scratching your systems. I take a Nintendo Switch Lite with me to the office every day in a small case in my rucksack and it looks practically good as new after about a year of ownership. Furthermore, the fact that the controllers are permanently attached to the system has the added benefit that they are impossible to lose while out and about.\n\nYou're getting a slightly smaller screen here, but it runs at the same 720p resolution as the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch OLED, so there is no performance or visual downgrade. If anything, I think that the smaller size can help the image look a little sharper.\n\nSo far, I've particularly enjoyed diving into retro fighting games like Ultra Street Fighter 2: The Final Challengers and Darkstalkers plus Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo from the excellent Capcom Fighting Collection - which lend themselves well to bursts of portable play. The one limitation of the Nintendo Switch Lite, however, is its complete inability to dock and play games on a TV when you're at home, so definitely bear this in mind before you buy.\n\nRead more: Nintendo Switch Lite review\n\nThe best handheld games console for PC gamers\n\nA powerful, portable gaming PC that can fit in your pocket is certainly an attractive proposition. While it can't really fit in your pocket thanks to its absolutely gigantic size, the Steam Deck does offer all of the power of a gaming laptop in a much smaller package. With its surprisingly modest starting price of $399 / £349 for the most basic model the Steam Deck packs in an awful lot of high-end hardware for your money.\n\nIt's available directly through Valve's Steam client and, regardless of the version you go for, runs Steam Deck Verified titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Apex Legends smoothly. As this device is powered by a modified version of the Linux operating system, not every game from your Steam library will work but there's a good chance that a sizeable chunk of titles you already own will be compatible straight out of the box.\n\nValve's first foray into the handheld hardware market isn't entirely perfect though, as our testing found that the battery life can struggle with more intensive titles. We found that a game like God of War really pushed the system to its limit, lasting just over an hour and a half while not plugged in. Given just how well many of the most demanding titles look and run on this device, though, this is a trade-off that we think is well worth making.\n\nRead more: Steam Deck review\n\nThe best handheld games console for retro gaming\n\nThe Super Pocket performs impressively well while playing older titles which makes it our top pick if you want a handheld console for playing retro games. There are currently two versions of the handheld console on the market: the green and black Taito Edition and the yellow and blue Capcom Edition.\n\nBoth versions include a unique built-in library of titles, focusing specifically on popular games from their respective publishers. I absolutely adore Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble from the Taito Edition in particular, but also have a big soft spot for Street Fighter 2: Hyper Fighting, Final Fight, and the original Mega Man on the Capcom Edition. I played all of the games across the two libraries during my testing and was hugely pleased with the smooth performance given the cheap price and small form factor.\n\nThe 320x240px IPS screen is certainly going to pale in comparison to the far more premium displays found on others systems on this list, like the Nintendo Switch OLED’s much higher resolution 720p display, but it's balanced out thanks to its 2.8” (~7cm) size. On the whole, games look fantastic and boast deep colors. There are even some decent display options (such CRT scanline filters and aspect ratios) that allow you to further to tweak their look to your liking in the software.\n\nEasily one of the most desirable features of the Super Pocket, however, is the Evercade cartridge slot. This grants Super Pocket owners access to a growing library of affordable Evercade cartridges that can pack everything from classic Namco arcade games to modern indie titles like Micro Mages and Foxyland.\n\nRead more: Super Pocket review\n\nThe best handheld games console for remote play\n\nThe PlayStation Portal is a brilliant companion device for the PlayStation 5. It enables PS5 owners to access their games remotely by streaming them over Wi-Fi (or a tethered mobile connection), beautifully translating big-screen games on its small and portable screen.\n\nWhat makes the Portal really shine is its slick design and varied feature set. This is effectively a PS5 DualSense controller with an 8-inch LCD screen squeezing into the middle. It maintaining the ergonomics, design, and features of the controller, sitting in your hands very comfortably and is easy to use if you're used to the layout. I'm also a huge fan of the excellent haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.\n\nThe screen is punchy and vibrant while the speakers are more than enough for most games. The downsides here are very minor and only extend to an irksome lack of Bluetooth support and the very slow battery charging speed.\n\nWhile it's not a handheld console by way of playing games natively (or streaming from the cloud), it superbly serves a very specific niche - which is to provide PS5 players with another way to play their PS5 remotely. I've especially enjoyed my time playing PlayStation exclusives like The Last of Us Part 2 and Spider-Man 2 away from my TV, but have also spent plenty of time with A Plague Tale: Requiem, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\n\nRead more: PlayStation Portal review\n\nHow to choose a gaming handheld\n\nThe easiest way to choose a gaming handheld is to think about the kinds of games that you would want to use it to play. If you’re interested in playing Nintendo published titles on the go, like Super Mario Odyssey or Mario Kart 8, then you’re going to need to choose the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, or Nintendo Switch Lite as these are the only platforms where such games are available.\n\nLikewise, if you want access to the latest PlayStation games and already own a PS5 with an expansive library, the PlayStation Portal is going to be your best bet. Do bear in mind, however, that the PlayStation Portal is a streaming-only device that requires a constant internet connection. If you need a device that can be played offline, consider the other options on this list.\n\nIf you want to play more PC-oriented games such as Valheim or Baldur's Gate 3 then a portable PC such as the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED is going to be the best choice. You should also consider a Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED if you’re most concerned about performance, as it features dramatically higher specs than the Nintendo Switch while maintaining a similar portable form factor.\n\nWhile all of the options on this list are able to play retro titles in some capacity, a dedicated retro handheld such as the Super Pocket could be the perfect option if you’re more concerned with playing older games and don’t want to break the bank. The Super Pocket offers an incredibly portable way to play retro games on the go, with a robust in-built library of titles right out of the box. It also offers compatibility with Evercade cartridges, allowing you to experience even more games down the line.\n\nBest handheld games console - FAQs\n\nIs the Nintendo Switch better in docked or handheld mode?\n\nYour experience with the Nintendo Switch will largely come down to personal preference. If you're out and about a lot, then handheld mode may be the way forward with the console. Even so, having the flexibility to play docked when you're at home can be a great added bonus. Obviously, with a Nintendo Switch Lite, you won't have the flexibility to enjoy the console docked, but you can still enjoy the same great games.\n\nAre handheld games consoles more affordable?\n\nHandheld consoles are fantastic if you're looking to save money and still get a high-quality gaming experience, but that doesn't always mean they are cheaper than a home console. If you're on a strict budget, the Nintendo Switch Lite or the Super Pocket are very budget-friendly. If you're after more powerful hardware, however, the price will start to climb and you may end up paying a similar figure for a handheld as you would for a home console like the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X.\n\nWhat's the best handheld console for kids?\n\nIf you're looking specifically for a dedicated handheld machine for kids, the Nintendo Switch Lite is a great option. Its small size and robust design is very well suited to little hands. It also lacks the ability to remove the controllers, meaning there are fewer things to break or lose.\n\nHow we test the best handheld games consoles\n\nEach of the handheld consoles on this list has been tested rigorously by a member of the TechRadar team. Our testing takes into account factors like the system's price and any unique features. We also test a range of games and software that suit the handheld in question. For example, we tested the PlayStation Portal with a range of popular PS5 titles including Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Helldivers 2, and The Last of Us Part 2. For the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite, we tested top Nintendo Switch games including Mario Kart 8 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in addition to a range of graphically demanding ports such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Xcom 2.\n\nWhile testing the Steam Deck, we assessed its performance and compatibility with a wide a range of Steam Deck Verified games from indie hits like Hades and Hotline Miami to huge adventures such as God of War. When it comes to the Super Pocket, we tested the built-in library in addition to an Evercade cartridge featuring games such as Burger Time and Sly Spy.\n\nTo take the example of Nintendo Switch OLED and Nintendo Switch Lite, that involved playing some of the most recent Nintendo Switch games in portable mode. In the case of handheld PCs like the Steam Deck, rigorous testing of our Steam library was involved including tests to determine how compatible popular titles were and how well they ran on the handheld.\n\nTested by\n\nThe team of expert reviewers behind this guide:"
