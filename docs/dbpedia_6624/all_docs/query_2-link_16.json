        "text": "I guess US$199 was the right price for a streaming LCD panel jammed between two halves of a Dual Sense controller as a second screen for one's PS5. Wild. Granted this is just first week's rollout. Hoarding around Black Friday for a Christmas/Holiday resale is a scalper's dream. I can only hope that Sony's fixes the sales tracking issues so that people are not buying multiple for resale Secondary markets in games suck. The important thing is to get 1 unit to each person that wants it, not to let parasitic secondary market scalpers make money off of gamers. Secondary scalping markets are all about speculation. ----- GamesIndustryBiz: \"PlayStation Portal has sold out two days after launch. Listings with inflated prices have started to appear online (Sophie McEvoy) The PlayStation Portal, which launched on November 15, has already sold out in the UK and the US. As noted by Eurogamer, it seems as though scalpers may have hoarded some of the supply as there are already listings for the device (which retails at ¬£199) on Ebay for between ¬£200 t0 ¬£290, with some reaching over ¬£300. The UK PlayStation Direct store says the PlayStation Portal is \"currently unavailable\" and to check back for more information on November 22, while the US store suggests early December for an update on when to expect more stock. Sony unveiled the PlayStation Portal earlier this year, a remote device that enables PlayStation 5 owners to play titles without using a TV screen via Wi-Fi. In its second quarter report for the financial year, the firm hoped the introduction of the PlayStation Portal may increase hardware sales during the holidays.

Still not sure how big the market is for a device like this. A device that cant stream games from the Cloud, can't natively run them and can only stream from your PS5. I just can't see a use case for it when we already have the likes of the Steam Deck, ROG Ally or the Nintendo Switch. Especially when you can buy a cheap tablet to do the exact same job as this $200 device or you can just sync your controller to your phone. It looks like a great device for the very niche use case but other than that, I'm not too sure. What are your thoughts on this device? Would you ever use one? #PS5 #Playstation #Gaming #Technology #GameIndustry #Streaming\n\nCurrent PlayStation chairman (and Sony president) Hiroki Totoki thinks the company needs to up its game on the PC front. At Sony's recent conference call, he mentioned opportunities to improve its operating profits. One possible solution would be putting first-party games on \"other platforms, like computers.\" Consoles will always take priority, but to him, a \"strong\" first-party title can \"be grown with multi-platform. I would like to go aggressive on improving our margin performance.\" Totoki's comments come as Helldivers 2 has become PlayStation's most successful PC game. It's the first PlayStation game to have a simultaneous PC and PlayStation 5 launch. Hey, PlayStation and Mr Totoki, if you are thinking of games that will sell like hotcakes on PC, may I recommend Bloodborne? And Ghost of Tsushima? You are welcome üòâ (source: https://lnkd.in/eYFTFkKr)\n\nSony‚Äôs portable PlayStation Portal is back in stock Sony‚Äôs PlayStation Portal is a bit of an odd, single-purpose device but it‚Äôs been flying off shelves since it came out in mid-November ‚Äî and right now it‚Äôs back in stock. The dedicated Remote Play device for the PlayStation 5 is available once again for its usual asking price of $199.99 from Sony‚Äôs PlayStation Direct storefront. The Portal‚Äôs sole focus is to stream games off of your PlayStation 5 via Wi-Fi and into your hands on its eight-inch touchscreen LCD. It‚Äôs not that different from using Remote Play on an iPad or a phone with a Backbone One controller, but the all-in-one solution does support the full suite of DualSense haptics ‚Äî including adaptive triggers and tilt controls. If you own a PS5 and like the idea of taking your...

From a report: \"Helldivers fans -- we've heard your feedback on the Helldivers 2 account linking update. The May 6 update, which would have required Steam and PlayStation Network account linking for new players and for current players beginning May 30, will not be moving forward,\" PlayStation wrote on its official account. \"We're still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable. Thanks again for your continued support of Helldivers 2 and we'll keep you updated on future plans.\" PlayStation's decision means that Helldivers 2 players on Steam won't have to link a PSN account in order to play. The unpopular policy, which would have seen new players confronted with a mandatory login beginning this week, resulted in Helldivers 2 being delisted in around 177 countries.

I of course prefer to play my PS5 in my living room on my massive 4K TV with surround sound, but that isn't always possible. I have a home, wife, and two kids and the reality is that the living room is a shared space. Whether that means the TV is being used for other things or I'm not able to hangout out in the living room, the PS Portal gives me access to my PS5 directly. From anywhere I have WiFi access. ‚è© Authenticity. The annoying thing about streaming your PS5 to your phone or Steam Deck is that you're missing out on DualSense features or tying up your phone. For me, I like having dedicated devices for things and clipping my phone into something to stream via an app is subpar to me. I vastly prefer a dedicated device. It also means my phone battery isn't draining faster. ‚è© Seamless Connection. I can wake my PS5 from rest using the PS Portal from anywhere and pick up where I left off in whatever game I was playing. Amazing. This also means I play my games more often because I can always hop on for a few minutes. --- All that being said, it's not a perfect device. There are a few things I want to see added or improved in a future device: üí• Screen. The LCD is fine and probably helped keep price down, but I really want an OLED next. Switch OLED and original PS Vita have me spoiled. üí• Multiple users. You can only use the PS Portal with your main user account and can't swap. Kind of annoying if you share the console like with kids. üí• Streaming content. You cannot access apps like Netflix, YouTube, etc with the PS Portal at all and you cannot stream PS+ games or PS3 games using the PS Portal. Bit odd. üí• Volume spectrum. The lowest setting is still kinda loud in a quiet room and full blast isn't loud enough. A bit more nuance would be nice. --- Overall, the PlayStation Portal is fantastic. It has led to less time mindlessly scrolling on social media because I can just play a game instead. I really, truly love mine! #gaming #playstation #playstationportal\n\nSony Removes 8K Claim From PlayStation 5 Boxes: Fans have noticed that, over the last few months, Sony quietly removed any mention of 8K on the PlayStation 5 boxes. \"I have been endlessly bitching since the PS5 released about that 8k Badge,\" writes X user @DeathlyPrice. \"It is false Advertising and Sony should be sued for it.\" Others shared their grievances via PlayStation Lifestyle and a Reddit thread. GameSpot reports: A FAQ on Sony's official site in 2020 stated that \"PS5 is compatible with 8K displays at launch, and after a future system software update will be able to output resolutions up to 8K when content is available, with supported software.\" But to date, the only game that offers 8K resolution on PS5 is The Touryst, which looks more like Minecraft than a game with advanced visuals. The reality is that 8K has not been widely adopted by video game developers, or even by filmmakers at this point. There are 8K televisions on the market, but it may be quite some time, if ever, before it becomes the standard for either gaming or entertainment. Read more of this story at Slashdot."
