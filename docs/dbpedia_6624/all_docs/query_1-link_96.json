        "text": "Exit\n\nPage: 1 2\n\nCompanions, inevitably, slow down Mr. ESC. Or is that Mr. ESC is too fast for the companions? Either way, they drag down the speed at which Mr. ESC can breeze through a level, yet they are the most motivational element for why he's there, and why people are playing the game. It's a bit annoying to deal with at first, but ultimately, it contributes to the overall challenge of the game. Like nearly everything in Exit, it takes time and patience to understand the pacing and rhythm of companions to get them through an obstacle.\n\nAll is not lost, however, for dealing with the challenges imposed by companion rescue, trials by failure, and slow animations. In one of the best uses of the PSP analog stick, Exit allows players to survey a level to find areas to send companions to perform certain tasks. By moving the analog stick, which behaves as a mouse, Mr. ESC can direct them to a point on the map, and with a press of the Triangle button, put them to work.\n\nChildren might not be able to move a box or climb over a safe in a flooded mall, but they can cross over brittle areas with weight limits and crawl into tight spaces to activate levers. Adults might not be able to get themselves up and over a box without assistance, but they are strong enough to help Mr. ESC move a heavy box. Young people are ideal companions, as their strength and weight levels are closer to Mr. ESC's. The ability to put them to work using the analog stick definitely balances out the slowness of their movements.\n\nOne of Exit's coolest features is the ability to download extra levels from the game's website using the PSP browser. Yes, homebrew users, you're going to have to upgrade to 2.5 to play this bad boy, but it's worth it. Currently, as of review time, there's only one downloadable stage (and the time limit is cranked up to \"Frantic\"), but there will be three more on the way, according to the icons on the site. It's a great way to extend the life of an already challenging game just a bit more. Hopefully, Taito/Ubisoft will unveil a few new extras as the year progresses to keep the replay value going.\n\nIt's fairly impossible to guarantee that Exit will garner the near-universal acclaim that Lumines, Ubisoft's last imported puzzle title, got during the PSP launch. For starters, there are slow elements to it, like the animations for moving up and down ladders, ropes, and stairs that will drive people absolutely insane. Sometimes the controls don't feel as responsive as they should...or maybe the programmers are trying to clue in players that there's another way to approach a jump. It seems to be a matter of perspective --in all honesty, even your trusty reviewer wasn't completely crazy about it during the process of writing the preview-- but the verdict here is that Exit is an excellent puzzle title that takes more time to grow on you than many short attention-spanned gamers might be willing to invest. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining, fun, and challenging title that can truly be played in the sorts of bursts that are natural to handheld gaming.\n\nEssential Links\n\nScreenshots: Exit\n\nScreenshots: Exit\n\nScreenshots: Exit\n\nPreview: Exit\n\nGame Information"
