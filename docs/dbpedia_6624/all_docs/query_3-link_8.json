        "text": "Games that Defined the Sony Playstation Portable (PSP)\n\nPresented by Rawblink w/ Racketboy & Ziggy\n\nThe handheld gaming market has traditionally been in Nintendo’s stronghold for quite a while. There have been a handful of formable opponents over the years, but Sony was the first to give a pretty strong fight (against Nintendo’s DS platform) with their first portable entry, the Playstation Portable.\n\nThe PSP was the first handheld console to really show strength as a modern 3D machine and it flexed its muscles with a lot of iconic games and properties. In addition to iconic games that felt like a proper on-the-go compliment to the PS2 (or even the PS3 later on), the PSP also had a healthy amount of original games that gave it its own personality and made even Nintendo loyalists a bit envious.\n\nBelow, we’ll cover the best PSP games that gave the system its personality over the different phases of its impressive lifespan and helped define its history.\n\nThis piece was heavily collaborative with our community as it was tricky to narrow this down and rank properly, but you’re welcome to share your opinions in the comments section below. Also, be sure to check out our recent Rare & Valuable PSP Games Guide for another side of the PSP’s library as well as the rest of our Defining Games series.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories\n\nThe Playstation Portableâ€™s main appeal at launch is that it opened up the possibility of a true 3D-console-like experience in a cutting-edge handheld. In the midst of the PS2 era, there wasnâ€™t a bigger presence in the mainstream gaming world than the Grand Theft Auto series and its open-ended action.\n\nSome of the most iconic sellers for the system (at least in the west). The appeal alone of â€œ3D GTA but Portableâ€ was enough to get players to jump back into two of the PS2’s most iconic locations.\n\nWith Liberty City Stories launching in 2005, Vice City Stories in 2006 each, and GTA Advance coming just a year prior in Fall 2004, these two made a case early on for the gap in power between the PSP and its competition. Back in 2005 the idea of playing a fully-realized open-world GTA on a handheld device was a pipe dream until Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories managed to recreate the feeling that made GTA such an iconic franchise.\n\nVice City Stories didnâ€™t rest on the laurels of its predecessor and pushed the PSP in all the right places to bring the Grand Theft Auto world to life in ways that seem impossible for the technologically limited PSP. This was thanks in part to a new game engine, resulting in a cleaner, more visually-stimulating handheld Grand Theft Auto.\n\nWhile both served as prequels to their console counterparts, both Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories provided a full-on GTA experience, including lengthy campaigns, side missions and even multiplayer modes.\n\nCheck for Grand Theft Auto Series on eBay\n\nCheck for Grand Theft Auto Series on Amazon\n\nGod of War: Ghost of Sparta & Chains of Olympus\n\nIf GTA defined the middle part of the PS2 era, God of War was the main buzz on the PS2 during the tail end of the PS2â€™s console reign. And just like the original God of War showed that the Playstation still has some life in its hardware, the portable versions managed to push the PSP hardware further as well.\n\nSimilar to GTA, both PSP God War games served as interim bits of story for fans (taking place before and after the first game) while still offering full God of War console experiences in portable form.\n\nThe same Greek myth-inspired hack and slash action that made a splash on the PS2 translated nearly flawlessly to the PSP. Despite the lack of a second analog stick, both games took full advantage of the hardware and showed that the PSP still had some juice under the hood coming out at 3 to 5 years into the system life. The first portable installment, Chains of Olympus impressed at its release and sold quite well, but you could tell some compromises were made for the platform.\n\nGhost of Sparta didnâ€™t massively shift the gameplay formula of the other PSP God of War exclusive Chains of Olympus, but it refined and improved the formula into a stunning package that is often regarded as one of the very best games on the PSP. Ghost of Sparta also thrives in the pacing and cinematic storytelling that deftly capture the feeling of playing a God of War game in the palm of your hand.\n\nIn addition to the epic opponents and fantastic worlds you’ll encounter, this hack and slash title also features some pretty tricky puzzles that you need to overcome if you are to progress through the levels. Both games were later ported to the PS3 in several God of War HD packs (Origins Collection and Saga) but like GTA, still run fine and show off what the PSP can do at its best.\n\nCheck for God of War Series on eBay\n\nCheck for God of War Series on Amazon\n\nCrisis Core: Final Fantasy 7\n\nThe definitive PSP exclusive that has yet to be ported anywhere else, Crisis Core was the long-awaited finale of Square’s original Final Fantasy VII expanded universe project â€œCompilation of Final Fantasy VIIâ€.\n\nCrisis Core puts players into the shows of First Class Soldier member Zack Fair and paints a prequel tale leading up to the events of Final Fantasy VII. The game featured a unique action RPG combat system and a hefty amount of side content. Despite being a prequel, it felt like a full entry in the series. It was also the most positively received of all the FF7 Compilation pieces resulting in it being one of the highest-selling games on the platform.\n\nTo this day, much like the Onimusha series, rumors as to why Crisis Core hasnâ€™t been ported tend to revolve around the likeness of Japanese pop star GACKT being used as the face of one of the key antagonists in the game. This has never been officially confirmed but as no other major reasons have been mentioned in interviews this tends to be the commonly held belief. As of the time of writing the FF7 Remake project is also in full swing under Square currently and there seem to be planning to at least retell Zack’s full Crisis Core story to some extent. Whether this means some type of remake remains to be seen but for any PSP collector Crisis Core is a must-own, with copies still very easy to come by.\n\nUpdate as of 7/7/22: This past June during the annual slew of games press conferences (in light of the actual E3 event being on hiatus this year) a slew of new Final Fantasy VII content surrounding the remake project got announced including the much-requested HD Remaster of Crisis Core, subtitled Reunion. The PSP version is still worth a look for lovers of the handheld but for those interested in the modern ports of the remaster they can be found here.\n\nCheck for Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 on eBay\n\nCheck for Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 on Amazon\n\nDaxter\n\nWhile Daxter, on the surface, seems like another console-to-portable supplement, Ready at Dawn (the same devs responsible for the PSP God of War titles) managed to once again craft a much more unique experience that put players directly into the shoes (fuzzy feet??) of the main series wise-cracking secondary protagonist. Story-wise, Daxter takes place before the second Jak game with players taking control of Daxter in order to break Jak out of jail after he becomes imprisoned before the second game begins.\n\nThe game features more precision platforming and unique dream sequences, some leaning heavily into almost Conker’s Bad Fur Day levels of parody. Fans of 3D platformers and the Jak series as a whole owe it to themselves to check Daxter out.\n\nDaxter also happens to be one of the more graphically impressive games on the system to complement some top-notch gameplay and puzzles. The cohesive package results in one of the very best games on the PSP. Currently, Daxter remains a PSP exclusive and was never ported elsewhere. It did however sell very well, making hard copies cheap and readily available.\n\nCheck for Daxter on eBay\n\nCheck for Daxter on Amazon\n\nMetal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, Portable Ops & Acid\n\nThe Metal Gear Solid franchise has been a mainstay on Sony platforms since the beginning of the Playstation and Sony would ensure that MGS would have a home on the PSP in one way or another. As youâ€™ll see, it took some experimenting before fans saw the best of what MGS could be on the portable, but the journey was worthwhile.\n\nAC!D/2: the mid-2000s were a time of decadence for the Metal Gear series. With the release of MGS3 reaching critical heights. Konami had several spin-offs and side games planned for the upcoming PSP. The original AC!D was a launch game set in an alternate universe featuring a very unique card battle strategy style of gameplay combined with Metal Gear-style stealth elements. A year later, the sequel would build on this concept (with copies of the game even going so far as to include a set of 3D glasses for gameplay segments) and improve many of the original game’s ideas, ironing out a good handful of flaws. The AC!D series, strange as it was, is worth a look for any fans of Metal Gear and unique card battle video game experiences. Sans temporary ports to mobile phones in PAL regions only, these games remain locked to the PSP.\n\nCheck for Metal Gear Solid: Acid on eBay\n\nPortable Ops/Plus: Portable ops was a more traditional take on Metal Gear for the handheld. Taking place after the events of MGS3. Players took on the role of Big Boss once again and were tasked with a variety of different mini-missions and built up what was, at the time, a new piece of the story. The only issue with this is that the game was eventually retconned due to Kojima not being directly involved with the writing, just overseeing the production. Peace Walker would eventually supplement this but as PW was 4 years away from Portable Ops 2006 release, it served as a solid entry on the handheld. It also included a major multiplayer suite. The multiplayer aspect was fleshed out and popular enough for its time that a standalone expansion title (Portable Ops Plus) that included online play, was released a year later and added more content along with the ability to transfer multiplayer data from original PO save files. While the multiplayer is most likely only able to be enjoyed locally these days, the original Portable Ops is arguably still worth a look for long-time Metal Gear fans looking to really dig into the series’ side stories and is a must-have for PSP owners.\n\nCheck for Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops on eBay\n\nCheck for Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops on Amazon\n\nPeace Walker: If thereâ€™s one Metal Gear game that would define the PSP, however, it is Peace Walker. As mentioned prior, Peace Walker was a full blown MGS experience, written by Kojima himself. The events in this game chronologically take place after MGS3 and Portable Ops and lead directly into what later would be Metal Gear Solid V. This game was a later PSP launch but took full advantage of the hardware including the multiplayer ideas presented in Portable Ops. The game was ported to the MGS HD pack released on 7th gen consoles but the bite-sized mission structure of the game arguably makes much more sense on handheld systems, making this another must-own for PSP and Metal Gear fans. While all are worth a look, if thereâ€™s one Metal Gear game every PSP owner should have its Peace Walker.\n\nCheck for Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker on eBay\n\nCheck for Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker on Amazon\n\nLumines Series\n\nStraight from the mind of the legendary Tetsuya Mizuguchi (Rez, Tetris Effect), the Lumines puzzle series combines psychedelic imagery and incredible sound design to great effect while serving as a launch title for PSP.\n\nWhile it might not have had the big marketing budget of the blockbuster names on the platform, it had a lot of early buzz and became a mainstay with a lot of PSP enthusiasts. One could argue that Lumines brought the puzzle genre back into the mainstream gaming world for the first time since Tetris was a killer app for the original Game Boy.\n\nPersonally, in the PSP era, I was a Nintendo DS fan and greatly enjoyed Mizuguchiâ€™s other puzzle gem, Meteos, but I was always secretly jealous of Lumines on the PSP as significantly more people talked it up.\n\nFeaturing a unique four-square block arrangement of puzzle-solving, like many of Mizoguchi’s games, the music and presentation combined with addictive gameplay was what made Lumines such a hit on the PSP. To this day, Lumines retains the legacy as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time.\n\nThe sequel would feature a slightly more pop-centric soundtrack but was still popular nonetheless. Though a remastered version exists on modern platforms, the original Lumines is still extremely cheap and easy to come by in physical form for the PSP and should be essential for puzzle fans and PSP owners.\n\nCheck for Lumines on eBay\n\nCheck for Lumines on Amazon\n\nLocoRoco Series\n\nLocoRoco and its sequel were hybrid 2D puzzle platformer games from Sony’s Japan Studio (previously known for Ape Escape). The nature of LocoRocoâ€™s hybrid gameplay has prompted some to refer to LocoRoco as a mix of Super Monkey Ball and Rayman). Players are actually put into the role of the planets that the titular creatures reside on and are tasked with guiding them on their journey to survive an alien invasion.\n\nThe core gameplay revolves around tilting the levels so the blob and liquid-like characters can reach their destinations. The gameplay was innovative and had a charming, comical, but sometimes dark personality to it. To top things off, LocoRoco visual style and catchy soundtrack helped solidify it as one of the big buzz-worthy hits in the PSPâ€™s middle years before the system really took off. For those gamers that werenâ€™t necessarily into the modern mainstream hits, Loco Roco was actually kinda a killer app of sorts for the PSP for a few years.\n\nOne of the most unique series on the system, sold quite well making it easy to pick up and an essential for players looking for a unique experience on the PSP. Â We eventually saw Loco Roco Remastered arrive on the Playstation 4, but it remains a classic on the PSP.\n\nThe simple controls and the rather short level design also make this game ideal for children or just adults that donâ€™t want a heavy commitment. But as you progress, Loco Roco will test your problem-solving capabilities and spatial intelligence. While the series might not have topped the list of most modern PSP owners, it is a great addition to round out a library and an underrated favorite for those that were heavy into the system.\n\nCheck for LocoRoco on eBay\n\nCheck for LocoRoco on Amazon\n\nPatapon Series\n\nJapan Studio essentially followed the innovative Loco Roco with another fresh and innovative series in Patapon. While the Director, Producer, and Designer were different between Loco Roco and Patapon, (and the gameplay also differed), the approach to the visual style and the innovative hybrid gameplay made them feel like they were close cousins of sorts.\n\nPataponâ€™s unique combination of rhythm and real-time strategy gameplay was another large hit on the PSP in the middle of its life span and was unlike any other game before it.\n\nOriginally launching in 2008, Patapon puts players in the role of a faceless god who beats a drum for the titular characters with the catch being that commands must be relayed in a rhythm game-style call-and-response input system.\n\nThe sequels would build upon the core mechanics of the original adding more troops and commands as well as multiplayer modes by the 3rd entry in the series. The first two games received PS4 conversions digitally but the 3rd remains a system exclusive. All three titles are relatively easy to find and serve as another unique experience for PSP owners and collectors.\n\nCheck for Patapon on eBay\n\nCheck for Patapon on Amazon\n\nMonster Hunter Series\n\nCapcomâ€™s Action RPG powerhouse built a great foundation on the PS2 before seeing adaptations on the PSP (and eventually other platformers). The Monster Hunter series needs little introduction to fans of the genre, but the PSP was arguably where the series began to flourish the most in its earlier days. Being able to play portably was a major addition to the addictive loop of the game.\n\nWhile Monster Hunter would take its time to grow audiences in the West, this was one of the highest-selling, system-pushing PSP series in Japan. Much in the way that World would lay the foundation for modern follow-ups like Rise today, the original portable entries available for the PSP would help flesh the series out and continue to build the framework for the future releases that would come to the 3DS in the next generation.\n\nCurrently, most of the western releases arenâ€™t terribly pricey and sold well enough so local multiplayer with a few friends is still a viable option if you donâ€™t mind looking into an older, but still well-loved, era of the Monster Hunter series.\n\nCheck for Monster Hunter on eBay\n\nCheck for Monster Hunter on Amazon\n\nJeanne D’ Arc\n\nOne of the strengths of the PSP was the quality lineup of RPGs it had to offer. Jeanne Dâ€™ Arc just happens to be one of the very best of the bunch â€“ especially if you enjoy Japanese turn-based strategy. Its interesting use of historical fiction presented with slick style is also icing on the cake.\n\nDeveloped by Level 5 (Dark Cloud, Ni no Kuni) Jeanne Dâ€™ Arc puts players in the role of the titular Joan of Arc in a loosely detailed adaptation of her involvement in the English occupation of France during the Hundred Years’ War in the early 15th century.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, this Strategy RPG utilized a new approach from Level 5â€™s more traditional turn-based fare in the past but functions much like some of Squares classics as well as Nintendo’s Fire Emblem series.\n\nThere are a handful of notable strategy RPG series across the platform but the combination of balanced strategy gameplay and interesting story adaptation make Jeanne Dâ€™ Arc one of the higher-quality titles to try out in the library. Only released in North America and Japan, the game remains exclusive to the PSP to this day.\n\nCheck for Jeanne D’ Arc on eBay\n\nCheck for Jeanne D’ Arc on Amazon\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions + Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together\n\nIf not Jeanne Dâ€™ Arc, then Squares strategy RPG classics are surely must-plays for the PSP. Based on their original PS1 versions (of which Tactics Ogre was originally a SNES game) both FFT and TO:LUCT feature a myriad of improvements and additions that make both of these the definitive versions of each to own.\n\nThe only downside is that, due to the PSPs UMD loading, some slow down can occur in various segments, especially in Final Fantasy Tactics. Despite this, both games are major staples in the Strategy RPG genre and fit perfectly on handhelds.\n\nEach received numerous script enhancements and revisions in the localization department and the development of both these enhanced versions was overseen by many of the original team members from both titles. War of the Lions did receive a mobile port but Let us Cling Together remains a PSP exclusive\n\nCheck for Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions on eBay\n\nCheck for Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions on Amazon\n\nCheck for Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together on eBay\n\nCheck for Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together on Amazon\n\nCastlevania Dracula X Chronicles\n\nWhile this release might not rank as highly to the mainstream gamers that the PSP was targeting, it resonated strongly with old-school gamers and that strong segment of PSP loyalists that appreciated its niche, classical game selection.\n\nRondo of Blood was, for a time, one of the oddest entries in the Castlevania series. The original PC Engine release, though praised by critics and deeper series fans, never saw a western release proper. Instead, released as Dracula X on the SNES, that version of the game would feature various cuts to the story and gameplay for the sake of conversion to the SNES. Not quite a bad port but not at all a worthy adaptation to the original.\n\nIt wasnâ€™t until the PSP remake release in 2007 that Rondo of Blood would get its due. Dracula X Chronicles featured a full-on 2.5D classical overhaul of Rondo of Blood. This version not only was translated into English for the first time, but with new voice acting and new stage challenges.\n\nOn top of all that, Dracula X Chronicles also gave fans the ability to unlock the PC Engine original and more importantly, yet hardly advertised as much, the ability to unlock Symphony of the Night (the direct sequel to Rondo). Taking this the extra mile, the Dracula X Chronicles compilation used the same voice actors for Rondo and SOTN, making the connection between them even stronger. SOTN also had some additional content compared to the PS1 original (but not quite as much as the Saturn port).\n\nAll in all, these bells and whistles made it a very attractive package and the ideal way to play this phase of the Castlevania timeline all in one place. Itâ€™s an essential release for Castlevania and PSP fans alike.\n\nCheck for Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles on eBay\n\nCheck for Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles on Amazon\n\nThe Ys series\n\nFalcomâ€™s Ys series would find a well-loved home on the PSP. Â After the series’ long-awaited return to consoles with the release of Ark of Napishtim (Ys VI) to PS2, the games would begin to be ported to Sony’s handhelds with Ark first then Oath in Felghana (a retelling of Ys III), Chronicles (I & II) and the next major entry, Ys Seven, all making appearances in the west throughout the lifespan of the PSP.\n\nThese action RPGs put the player in the role of adventure Adol Christen and often recant his wild adventures to become the legendary hero he is known for being. As the PSP features such a vast handful of entries in the series each has its own gameplay style.\n\nOrigins is the most unique as it is based around the original two series entries. Oath in Felghana plays much like Ark of Napishtim and Ys Seven featured a new more complex 3D style that involved character swapping and would be used in future remakes and new entries. With Ys gaining more modern exposure, the legacy would continue onto the Vita and other modern platforms, including PC in homage to Falcomâ€™s original releases, but these PSP entries are must-haves and would define the systemâ€™s ability to gather up games from more niche yet still beloved series.\n\nCheck for Ys Series on eBay\n\nCheck for Ys Series on Amazon\n\nWipeout Pure\n\nItâ€™s always nice to have a solid racer on a portable system and itâ€™s hard to choose a better franchise to fit the PSP than Wipeout. Its hue-infused futuristic take on the racing genre is only rivaled by Nintendoâ€™s F-Zero and Wipeoutâ€™s legacy for a killer soundtrack translates nicely to the PSPâ€™s strong media reputation.\n\nWipeout Pure is set an additional 100 years into the future than previous installments and happens to be one of the stronger entries in the Wipeout series and first on the PSP. The game originally launched around the North American PSP release and was widely praised by critics as a solid adaptation of the series.\n\nPure is also notable for being one of the first PSP games to allow for DLC. All of the DLC packs were free and released over the first few months of the game’s launch. Though the original site for the packs has been shut down, they have been preserved through third-party means and often included new tracks, vehicles, music and artwork for the futuristic racing classic.\n\nCheck for Wipeout Pure on eBay\n\nCheck for Wipeout Pure on Amazon\n\nRidge Racers\n\nOf course, the Wipeout series has traditionally also had the Ridge Racer series by its side on the Playstation platforms and the PSP is no exception.\n\nNamcoâ€™s Ridge Racer series would make its way to the PSP in a solid pair of entries. The first installment, simply called â€œRidge Racerâ€ (or â€œRidge Racersâ€ in Japan), would serve as both a launch title for the PSP and a bit of a â€œbest ofâ€ type entry for the series featuring tracks, cars and music from a variety of the previous titles. Despite not being especially original, Ridge Racer sold quite well on the PSP.\n\nThe follow-up, titled Ridge Racer 2 was released everywhere but the US. Similar to the first PSP installment, Ridge Racer 2 is less of a true sequel and more of a â€œbest ofâ€ compilation type game featuring even more content than the first installment.\n\nBoth Ridge Racer releases are essential for racing fans on the PSP. Even though Ridge Racer 2 wasnâ€™t commercially released in North America, it’s quite easy to import these days due to the high print run.\n\nCheck for Ridge Racer Series on eBay\n\nCheck for Ridge Racer Series on Amazon\n\nDissidia: Final Fantasy/Duodecim\n\nPart Power Stone part anime arena fighter, Squareâ€™s Final Fantasy fighting series took root on the PSP and offered one of the most unique and content-rich experiences on the handheld.\n\nServing as a celebration of the series, Dissidia allowed players to choose from their favorite hero or villain in the series up to FF XII at the time and go at it in big arena-sized 3D battles that spanned numerous series locations.\n\nInstead of just fighting till life bars dropped, the games featured a unique mechanic of struggling back and forth for life points. This encouraged more thoughtful gameplay than just dashing in and mashing buttons. The sequel, 012 Duodecim, despite having such an odd name, added more characters and content to the first and even came with all the main story content included in the original. The eventual arcade and PS4 follow-up were not as well-received due to major changes made in-game functionality but these first two mid to later-life PSP releases should be essentials for system owners and Final Fantasy fans all around.\n\nCheck for Dissidia: Final Fantasy/Duodecim on eBay\n\nCheck for Dissidia: Final Fantasy/Duodecim on Amazon\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront II\n\nLast but not least, a long time ago on a portable far, far away, Pandemic Studiosâ€™ Battlefront II sold quite well and offered most of the features of the console and PC versions of the same name, including the popular multiplayer suite of features.\n\nAllowing for up to 4 players wirelessly, Battlefront on-the-go was just as impressive at the time as many of the other console-to-handheld adaptations offered on the PSP.\n\nThis port of Battlefront II sold so well on the PSP that LucasArts actually made several spin-off sequels. While Renegade and Elite Squadron were not quite as well-received, both featured a slew of enhancements that built upon what was established in Battlefront II and are worth a look for Star Wars fans and PSP owners in search of a solid multiplayer experience.\n\nCheck for Star Wars: Battlefront II on eBay\n\nCheck for Star Wars: Battlefront II on Amazon\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nRatchet & Clank: Size Matters (eBay)\n\nSecret Agent Clank (eBay)\n\nKingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep (eBay)\n\nSilent Hill Origins (eBay)\n\nCrush (eBay)\n\nTekken: Dark Resurrection (eBay)\n\nGran Turismo (eBay)\n\nUntold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade (eBay)\n\nBurnout Legends (eBay)\n\nValkyria Chronicles series (eBay)\n\nMega Man Powered Up (eBay)\n\nMega Man X Maverick Hunter (eBay)\n\nOutrun 2006 Coast 2 CoastÂ (eBay)\n\nN+ (eBay)\n\nShin Megami Tensei: Persona Series (eBay)\n\nSyphon Filter: Dark Mirror (eBay)\n\nWhen you click on links to various merchants on this site and make a purchase, this can result in this site earning a commission.\n\nAffiliate programs and affiliations include, but are not limited to, the eBay Partner Network or Amazon Associates."
