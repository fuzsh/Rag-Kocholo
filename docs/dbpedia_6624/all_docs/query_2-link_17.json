How do I access the new release?\n\nPrevious owners of DOOM or DOOM II on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Epic Game Store, the Microsoft Store, Steam and Good Old Games will automatically receive the new version with a free update. It may already be updated by the time you read this!\n\n(NOTE: Free update is eligible for digital version owners.)\n\nHow do I access the original versions of the game?\n\nUsers on the below PC platforms will be able to access the original version of DOOM + DOOM II as follows:\n\nSteam users can use the Beta Participation property option to download and launch the original versions, or the last version that we launched in 2019 labeled \"previous-re-release\"\n\nGood Old Games users can install the original version of DOOM or DOOM II from “My Collection” via the GOG website and your “Owned Games” via the GOG Galaxy launcher. Once installed the original version can be launched directly from the installed Windows folder or shortcut, or the GOG Galaxy launcher\n\nIf you already owned DOOM or DOOM II on the Microsoft Store before today, you will be able to access the original version via “My Library” on the Windows Xbox app. Users who purchase the game from the Microsoft store from today-on after on only have access to the enhanced version.\n\nIf you already have the original version of DOOM or DOOM II installed on PC Game Pass, it will still be available in your My Games library\n\nWhat are the PC requirements for DOOM + DOOM II?\n\nSee the specifications below:\n\nPC Minimum Specifications (1080p/60 Hz)\n\n• Win 10 64-bit version\n\n• Intel Core i5-3570 @3.4 GHz or AMD Ryzen 3 1300X @3.5 GHz\n\n• 8GB System RAM\n\n• NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 TI (2GB) or AMD HD 7750 (1GB)\n\n• 1920x1080 Resolution\n\n• Minimum 2GB free space on hard drive\n\n• High speed broadband connection required for online play\n\nPC Recommended Specifications (4K/120 Hz*)\n\n• Win 10 64-bit version\n\n• Intel Core i5-6600k @3.5 GHz or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 @3.2 GHz\n\n• 8GB System RAM\n\n• NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 (8GB) or AMD RX Vega 56 (8GB) or Intel Arc A 280\n\n• 3480x2160 Resolution\n\n• Minimum 2GB free space on hard drive\n\n• High speed broadband connection required for online play\n\n*Compatible display required\n\nIf I already own DOOM or DOOM II on Steam, GOG or the Microsoft Store, will my saves carry over?\n\nSave games from the original version aren’t compatible with the enhanced version of DOOM + DOOM II. The original versions of the games are available if there are any saves you want to continue (see above for instructions). The enhanced release also allows you to play any campaign in any order, or you can use Level Select.\n\nHow do I play with friends on other platforms?\n\nThe easiest way to join a cross-play match with friends is using the room code system. The room code is a four-letter code that can be seen inside the pre-game lobby. Send this to your friends over text message, Discord or yelling very loudly and they'll be able to join through the Multiplayer Menu.\n\nNote that on some platforms, cross-play may be disabled at the system level. If you have problems joining cross-play matches, ensure that this option is enabled.\n\nWhat are the resolutions and framerates for each platform?\n\nPC: Maximum supported by video card/display\n\nSwitch: 720p at 60 FPS (Handheld), 1080p at 60 FPS (Docked)\n\nPlayStation 4: 1080p at 60 FPS\n\nPlayStation 4 Pro: Native 4K at 60FPS\n\nXbox One: 1080p at 60 FPS\n\nXbox One X: Native 4K at 60 FPS\n\nPlayStation 5: Native 4K at 120 FPS\n\nXbox Series X|S: Native 4K at 120 FPS\n\nWhat input devices are supported?\n\nController, keyboard and mouse are supported on all platforms, including consoles. Split-screen is available with mixed mouse/keyboard & controller.\n\nDo I need an always online connection to play the game?\n\nDOOM + DOOM II only requires an online connection to play online multiplayer game modes. Single player campaigns and local multiplayer via split screen, LAN or ad-hoc on Nintendo Switch can be played while offline.\n\nCan I send and receive game invites from the Epic Games Store launcher?\n\nSending and receiving game invites from the Epic Games Store is not supported. You can send and receive invites to your friends from the DOOM + DOOM II Multiplayer Menu.\n\nIs the Steam Controller supported?\n\nDOOM + DOOM II does not support the Steam Controller.\n\nHow do I create a mod?\n\nDoomTools offers an array of essential utilities for creating a DOOM WAD file (requires Java), Ultimate Doom Builder for level editing (requires Microsoft .Net Framework 4.7.2) and SLADE for WAD file editing.\n\nWe also recommend utilizing online DOOM community wikis such as DoomWiki.org, and Discords, such as UDB’s and SLADE’s.\n\nHow do I upload a mod?\n\nMod uploading is only available on PC. To begin, select a game from the Main Menu (e.g. DOOM II). Select \"MODS\" from the Menu and then select \"UPLOAD\" and follow the instructions given.\n\nHow come I only see Featured mods on Nintendo Switch?\n\nOnly Featured Mods are available on Nintendo Switch due to platform policies.\n\nOn the minimap, why do the Kill, Item and Secrets totals not increment for the Host when completed by another player?\n\nFor the host player, Kills, Items and Secrets don't count on the minimap if another player adds them. This is intended; the minimap shows only your total Kills, Items and Secrets - not the total for the entire party.\n\nKnown Issues / Behaviors\n\nIssue: When a LAN Host quits while a player is in session, the client will receive an Internet error icon\n\nIf a Host closes the LAN lobby while a client is still present, the client will be left in the lobby with the Internet error icon present. They must leave the lobby and are then appropriately returned to the Main Menu. This does not occur on Online Multiplayer, where the host closing the lobby will return clients to the Main Menu.\n\nAn example of how a client (Player 2) can get 'stuck' in a defunct lobby:\n\n1. Launch the application on two different devices\n\n2. Allow Player 1 to host a LAN match\n\n3. Allow Player 2 to join Player 1’s lobby\n\n4. Have Player 1 close the lobby\n\n5. Observe Player 2 is not returned to the Main Menu and must leave the lobby\n\nIf the host quits while the player is in session, the client become stuck in place with an internet error icon. They must quit back to the Main Menu themselves\n\nIssue: Browse Matches screen allows Players to join lobbies which closed due to loss of Network Connectivity\n\nOnce the Match Browser Menu completes its initial load, and the spinning Cacodemon element clears, it does not appear to update the list in real time. This allows Players to join dead lobbies, which can cause duplicate host instances if the original host creates a new room.\n\nFor example, here's such a scenario:\n\nPlayer A:\n\n1. Launch DOOM + DOOM II\n\n2. Setup a Multiplayer Lobby\n\nPlayer B:\n\n3. Launch DOOM + DOOM II\n\n4. Progress into the Browse Matches Screen, allow the loading element to clear\n\nPlayer A:\n\n5. Disconnect from the Network to be removed from the Lobby\n\nPlayer B:\n\n6. Observe: Player A's lobby is still joinable\n\nIssue: Leaving a lobby returns player to Add Players screen\n\nAfter creating or joining a multiplayer lobby (online, local, or LAN) when leaving the lobby the player will observe they are returned to the Add Player screen.\n\nFor example:\n\nHOST:\n\n1. Start DOOM + DOOM II\n\n2. Start any game\n\n3. Select Multiplayer\n\n4. Create any lobby type\n\n5. Leave lobby\n\n6. Observe returned to Add Players multiplayer menu\n\nCLIENT:\n\n1. Start DOOM + DOOM II\n\n2. Start any game\n\n3. Select Multiplayer\n\n4. Join any online lobby\n\n5. Leave lobby\n\n6. Observe returned to Add Players multiplayer menu"
