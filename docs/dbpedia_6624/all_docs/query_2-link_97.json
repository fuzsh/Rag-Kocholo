        "text": "Everything is proprietary\n\nThe PSP 3000 simply works with the cables you have. The hardware has a mini-USB port on the top of the system so you can move files or hook up accessories, and you can connect your PSP to your PS3 using any USB cable. In fact, one USB cable attached to your PS3 will let you both charge your controllers and connect to your PSP to move content.\n\nThat was a good thing, so of course it was time to get rid of it.\n\nThe PSP Go now uses a proprietary plug, which means no more generic USB cables. Your old chargers won't work either. In fact, the charging solution is rather tedious: you plug the cable into the PSP, and then into a block of plastic, and then you plug the power cable into the other side of the plastic, and then plug that into the wall.\n\nLet that sink in: the cable you use to charge the hardware comes in three parts. You don't own a single cable that will work with the PSP Go.\n\nIt gets even sillier, however. You can use the Bluetooth capabilities of the system to link a Dual Shock 3 to the system, in order to play with an actual controller. That's a pretty cool feature, right? The only problem is, without USB you need to connect the controller, and the PSP Go, to a PS3. So to sync the controller to the system you need another system, a USB cable, the proprietary PSP Go cable, and the controller. It's not exactly the most elegant solution, and in this situation the PS3 works as a $300 adapter.\n\nAgain, the reasons for this are obvious: retailers get to sell high-margin replacement cables, and that also benefits Sony. Those who lose out? The gamers.\n\nGetting started is a pain\n\nThis is petty, but I love new hardware. I love the look of it, I love the smell of it, I love taking it out of the box for the first time and playing a game. The problem is that the PSP Go doesn't want you to play with it. In fact, you need to carve out a significant amount of time before you get to the gaming.\n\nOn the PSP, Sony requires you to install each update before playing games. After the system was first powered on and connected to our wireless router, we were told that an update was required before we could go online and download a game. So we downloaded the update, which was a speedy affair. After the system rebooted, it told us that, although the system was plugged into a wall socket, the update could not be installed until the batteries were fully charged.\n\nSo the system had to charge, and then the update was installed. But then of course you have to download a game, since you can't use any of your UMD software, and that takes a while. But then the system disconnected from my network randomly because the 802.11b hardware doesn't handle being walked around my house very well, so I had to start completely over on the download.\n\nAll told, it took around three hours to get to playing an actual game. I passed the time by playing Gran Turismo on the PSP 3000. If you buy a PSP Go, I suggest bringing another video game along to keep yourself occupied while you wait for it to allow you to play something.\n\nNow, keep in mind that the update issue exists on the standard PSP, but if a game required the update you always have the choice of putting in an older UMD that doesn't. You can have the system up and running in minutes. Since you're locked into using Sony's servers to get games for the PSP Go, you'll be forced to get every update they decide to send out, no matter if the game requires it or not, and if your battery isn't fully charged that could take a while.\n\nIs there anything to like?\n\nLest you think we're simply going to bash the system for the entirety of this review, we'll bring up a few things that are good about the system.\n\nA smaller screen at the same resolution means that the image is brilliant, sharp and clear. The system is obviously smaller, not to mention thinner, so it's a little more portable. Both the d-pad and the face buttons are much \"clickier,\" although that's obviously personal preference. But for our money, the buttons feel great.\n\nThe other solid addition is the pause feature, and this is something we hope at some point makes the move to other PSP models. At any point in any game you can hit the PlayStation button, and save the game wherever you are. Then you can play another game, listen to a song, watch a movie, and come back to exactly where you saved when you're ready to play again. In the middle of a fighting game or mid-turn in a racing game, this is a great way to make up for games that don't have portable-friendly save systems. You can only have one save on one game at a time, but it's still a wonderful feature.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nIt's hard to pin down who exactly this system is for. People with unlimited gaming budgets? The Go is more expensive than the current PSP offerings, and it gives you fewer options about where you can get your games. Since Sony has stated publicly that the company is going to stick with MSRP for all of its releases, the digital versions of games may be the same price as their retail counterparts, but more likely will be more expensive in many circumstances.\n\nYou can't shop around for the best deal with your games, you'll never be able to sell a game, and the system is completely locked down when downloading a purchase. The controls are more cramped, and Sony has made sure you can only buy their cables. The wireless standard hasn't been upgraded, and the system is significantly more expensive than any of its competitors. When you close the system you see a big, beautiful screen you can't do anything with.\n\nIn other words, this system is for people who don't mind rebuying all their content, never buy used games, and don't mind paying more for less. If you're agoraphobic and the idea of driving to a physical store to buy a game is terrifying, this system is for you. So we're looking for a gamer who is both wealthy and frighteningly antisocial.\n\nThe rest of us will stick with our current hardware, thanks. If you sell a system that takes hours of setup, downloading, and charging before you can see what a game looks like on the screen, you have failed pretty spectacularly. I absolutely love my PSP, but this new iteration of the platform is what would happen if a facepalm was turned into a piece of hardware.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe screen is beautiful in action\n\nClicky, responsive buttons\n\nHardware is aesthetically pleasing\n\nThe pause function is great\n\nBluetooth headset, to use with your bluetooth headset, PS3 controllers, or to tether to your cell phone\n\nSound is strong using the built-in speakers\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe system can't download games while you're doing other things\n\nWay too expensive\n\nAbsolutely no way to play any of your existing games\n\nControls are cramped\n\nSmaller screen\n\nGames tend to be more expensive than retail\n\nNo competition in pricing for games\n\nNo way to sell games you buy\n\nNone of your cables or accessories will work, except for headphones\n\nScreen is wasted while closed, only shows clock, calendar\n\nThe Ugly\n\nWaiting hours to download a patch, charge your batteries, buy a game, download your game, and then install your game, and then finally... guess what? playing your game!\n\nYour system can already do what this system claims to do, and better. Minus the bluetooth and the 16GB of internal storage, this is a step back in every way\n\nIf Sony continues this trend, expect a $500 PS3 that doesn't play Blu-ray discs\n\nVerdict: Skip"
