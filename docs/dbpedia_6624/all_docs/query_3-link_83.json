BandaiNamcos Summon Night 5 is the continuing story of that order-keeping society, the Eucross, and the adventures their Summoners have keeping their world and the disparate races from the Otherworlds in balance. Players can choose to experience the story as rookie Summoners Folth or Arca, and one of four possible partners (their Cross), giving the games dialogue and feel a unique flavor on up to eight different playthroughs. What players see, and how the characters react depends on what characters are chosen at the beginning of each playthrough. But whatever choices a player makes, theyre in for a charming and sometimes tense Strategy-RPG adventure as they gradually unravel a plot that threatens the balance the Eucross is sworn to protect. The game features beautiful 2D and 3D art with battles presented in user-adjustable isometric perspective, and gorgeous animation that is a hallmark of BandaiNamco productions.\n\n74\n\nMetascore\n\nAngus hates Aliens\n\nRedneck Angus has to save the world from ...yeah you guessed it. At first glance, our hero Angus seems to be as dim as a glow worm's armpit, but to save the world he has to get from his cozy couch and get his guns in row, he is our only hope. Though the situation looks like a pretty straight forward run and gun scenario Angus has to make a lot of tactical choices along the way. He also has to choose his weapons with care, you never know when you run out of bullets. Angus hates Aliens is all about reaction and tactical choices against a plethora of different enemies. Every enemy and every situation requires Angus to think about specific approaches making this game more tactical than your usual shooter."
