        "text": "About\n\nCall of Duty: Zombies \"de-make\" powered by various enhanced forks of the Quake engine, in development since 2009. This hub repository serves as a place to host nightly builds as well as a means of bug reporting on a game-wide (non-component) scale. See the breakdown for source code and other components.\n\nThe game itself is feature-equivalent with Call of Duty: World at War on a generic level. Gameplay components are implemented with minor parity differences. Most World at War maps and their unique features are not yet represented. Various small additions and changes from Call of Duty: Black Ops are present as a means of gameplay smoothing, but not on a wide scale. NZ:P is, first and foremost, a Call of Duty: World at War remake.\n\nSupported Platforms\n\nLinux (x86, x86_64, armhf, arm64)\n\nmacOSâ\n\nNintendo Switch\n\nNintendo 3DS\n\nPlayStation Portable (both \"PHAT\" (PSP-1000) and \"SLIM\" (PSP-2000 and higher))\n\nPlayStation VITA\n\nWebGL\n\nWindows (x86, x86_64)\n\nSource Code"
