        "text": "This is a hub for various information about netplay. Most info was gathered from the guys over at /vr/, so if you have any questions or need someone to play retro games with, visit their IRC channel at #/vr/_Netplay on rizon.net & and their official website here\n\nNetplay, shouldn't be confused with LAN/local multiplayer and LAN tunneling programs, #Online Multiplayer Emulation and Online Services. The term 'netplay' is sometimes used as an umbrella term for online play, which can be confusing for some people unfamiliar with the term.\n\nGetting Started[edit]\n\nBefore you begin, here are some things to consider:\n\nEmulator netplay is NOT perfect. Desyncs WILL occur very often. Choppy/stuttery gameplay is also very common, and sometimes there is controller input lag. It comes with the experience.\n\nIt sometimes takes several consecutive tries for the game to stay synced well enough to enjoy some multiplayer action. Do not be discouraged and try again until it works.\n\nWhen using netplay, make sure not to have anything downloading (torrents, YouTube videos, etc.)\n\nTry not to move the emulator window around, or switch focus to windows other than the chat/Kaillera window and emulator, or you risk desyncing the game.\n\nIt's highly recommended to use a controller. Some emulators still register input from keyboards while you're chatting on separate chat windows.\n\nPort forwarding[edit]\n\nYou should note that some emulators and clients will require you to forward your ports. To do that, follow the Port Forwarding Guide For Netplay.\n\nLocal Multiplayer Netplay[edit]\n\nThis section will cover consoles that originally had local multiplayer, also known as couch multiplayer, where multiple controllers were hooked to the same console. Out of convenience, handheld consoles that required link cable or wireless within a small distance in the same room between two units will be considered local multiplayer as well.\n\nNetplay emulates local multiplayer allowing for players across the globe to play the same game as if they were in the same room.\n\nStreaming programs[edit]\n\nLocal co-op option if the game supports it with streaming software for playing with your friends over the internet replicating the fun of a couch co-op but without needing to be in the same physical location.\n\nParsec[edit]\n\nParsec is a program to allow streaming local multiplayer games to others over the internet. Parsec only supports hosting from Windows or macOS. Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and web browsers can connect to Parsec hosts however.\n\nSteam Remote Play Together[edit]\n\nSteam Remote Play Together can be used to allow games in Steam to be played with people through streaming. You can add emulators and any non-Steam games into your library by clicking \"Games\" from the title bar, and click \"Add a non-Steam game to my library\". Remote Play Together is supported on any device that can run Steam, and is the only option for hosting from Linux. Additionally, Android and iOS can connect to games via the Steam Chat app, making this the only option for iOS as a client.\n\nSunshine[edit]\n\nSunshine is self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight project (formerly Limelight).\n\nNVIDIA GameStream[edit]\n\nSimilar to Sunshine, it was using Moonlight project but in late 2022 NVIDIA announced that they have chosen to discontinue their NVIDIA GameStream technology.[1]\n\nNintendo Consoles[edit]\n\nNES[edit]\n\nRetroArch *: FCEUmm, QuickNES, or Nestopia[2] cores support netplay. Save states cannot be used during netplay, and bringing up the menu screen will cause disconnection.\n\nMesen: Mesen has a netplay feature, available by going to Tools -> Netplay. Hamachi (and other methods) or a port forward is required.\n\nVirtuaNES *\n\nMednafen *: FCEU core\n\nNestopia *\n\nRockNESX 2.0: A very old NES emulator. Has a very nice interface but the documentation doesn't indicate what ports it uses, so you're limited to using a VPN like Hamachi. The author did away with netplay in more recent versions.\n\nJnes: Still shows signs of being updated, but it absolutely HATES anything other than stock Kaillera. I'm not sure if it's possible to get it to work.\n\nSNES[edit]\n\nRetroArch *: Snes9x or bsnes cores.\n\nSnes9k\n\nMednafen *: bsnes core\n\nZSNES *\n\nMesen (and obsolete version Mesen S): Mesen has a netplay feature, available by going to Tools -> Netplay. Hamachi (and other methods) or a port forward is required.\n\nFightCade: SNES rollback netplay, experimental\n\nNintendo 64[edit]\n\nProject64 Netplay *\n\nProject64k *\n\nProject64 v1.7 *\n\nsimple64 (formerly known as \"m64p\")\n\nProject64KSE (specifically built for Super Smash Bros. and mods of it)\n\nGameCube / Wii[edit]\n\nDolphin: This guide should help, although it should be noted that netplay is not perfect. This is for playing with other Dolphin emulators.\n\nSlippi: The best option for Super Smash Bros. Melee specifically, as it features rollback netcode and online matchmaking for it.\n\nGame Boy[edit]\n\nTGB Dual Vol. 8.3.1 *\n\nRetroArch: SameBoy and TGB-Dual cores.\n\nGame Boy Advance[edit]\n\nMy Boy\n\nVBA-M\n\n3DS[edit]\n\nNo netplay support but some of the emulators support Download Play feature. See Nintendo 3DS emulators#Hardware features.\n\nNintendo Switch[edit]\n\nRyujinx\n\nYuzu\n\nOther[edit]\n\nNone of the existing emulators for the following Nintendo devices currently offer solutions for local multiplayer emulation through netplay. However, some of them have support for online gameplay modes that existed on the original console. Refer to the next section for more details.\n\nNintendo DS\n\nWii U\n\nSega Consoles[edit]\n\nMaster System[edit]\n\nKega Fusion *: Besides RetroArch, this is really the only one worthwhile netplay option for systems older than the Saturn. It emulates practically every single console and peripheral prior to the Saturn, all while allowing for some decent netplay capabilities on the side.\n\nMednafen *: SMS Plus core\n\nGenesis/Mega Drive & Peripherals[edit]\n\nGENS *: An acceptable alternative to Kega Fusion. While it only emulates Genesis/Mega Drive, Sega CD and 32X, it uses Kaillera for online multiplayer, which is helpful in case you get consistent desyncs while using Kega Fusion.\n\nMednafen *: Genesis Plus core is experimental but mostly functional; 2 players only.\n\nFightCade: Supports Genesis games.\n\nSaturn[edit]\n\nMednafen *\n\nDreamcast[edit]\n\nFlycast Dojo: Netplay fork of Flycast supports Dreamcast games. Also featured in FightCade for NAOMI & Atomiswave emulation.\n\nSony Consoles[edit]\n\nPlayStation 1[edit]\n\nDuckStation GGPO fork\n\nDuckStation Pull request for rollback netplay implementation\n\nMednafen *\n\nePSXe 1.60 *\n\nPlayStation 2[edit]\n\nPCSX2 (unofficial netplay build): Netplay has never officially been added to PCSX2, but someone tried making their own branch a few years ago to implement it. Only about seven fighting games work, and the project has since been abandoned.\n\nPSP[edit]\n\nPPSSPP and JPCSP supports multiplayer on the same network but only the JPCSP supports XLink Kai. See this section for more information.\n\nOther[edit]\n\nNone of the existing emulators for the following Sony devices currently offer solutions for local multiplayer emulation through netplay.\n\nPocketStation\n\nPlayStation 3\n\nPlayStation 4\n\nPlayStation Vita\n\nArcade[edit]\n\nThe many platforms that conform to the term \"arcade\" have got to be considered the most extensively researched and emulated platforms in existence. Choosing the right emulator is quite a daunting task since there are so many different versions that accomplish the same thing in almost imperceptibly different ways. Branching off from a standard official emulator that, by itself, is commonly regarded to leave much to be desired.\n\nMAME32 Plus Plus *\n\nKawaks 1.63 * (And later versions)\n\nKaillera\n\nFightCade: A matchmaking platform bundled with different arcade and home console emulators with P2P online play. Core multi-arcade emulator based off of FinalBurn Neo with a custom implementation of GGPO for rollback netplay. Also has support for NAOMI and Atomiswave games via Flycast * with delay-based netcode.\n\nGGPO: Arcade emulator built around netplay. Pioneered rollback netplay, widely considered to have the best multiplayer netcode available. It's so great that its used in some more recent commercial games. The only disadvantage is that you need to open ports to use it, and it's severely limited to games that were made or modified specifically to use this technology. Originally built on the same emulator as FightCade, FinalBurn Alpha.\n\nNullDC BEAR: A Serverless, self-contained package for online Retro Games, Supports: Naomi, Dreamcast, Atomiswave via custom build of NullDC. NES, SNES, PSX, Sega Saturn, Sega Megadrive, Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Color, Neo-Geo Pocket via Mednafen.\n\nMameHUB: Said to have a comparable netcode to GGPO, it's also capable of emulating console games through MESS. However, using MameHUB requires registration, and the frontend, is coded in Java, is an absolute resource-hog which heavily impairs your gaming experience if you're using a low-end computer. You can join a game that's already in session. Newer versions of MAMEHub use much fewer resources.\n\nOther Consoles[edit]\n\nAmiga[edit]\n\nFS-UAE: Netplay info and guides for FS-UAE\n\nAmigaLive project : FS-UAE Front-End\n\nNEC[edit]\n\nFor both the PC-Engine (US: TurboGrafx-16) and the PC-FX, check:\n\nMednafen *: Option for both accuracy and fast cores.\n\nRetroArch\n\nFightCade: Supports only Hu-Card games.\n\nOnline Multiplayer Emulation[edit]\n\nSee Revivial Projects\n\nSee Online Services\n\nSome consoles and systems offered during their lifetime options to connect to the internet (or similar services) to play against other people online.\n\nWhile most of these servers went defunct, some of them are (or were) still up and the emulators were developed far enough to be able to interface with the actual official servers. The others had replacement servers, that could host both real hardware players and PC emulator users. However in many cases emulator users were banned over cheating or concerns that emulation lag gave them unfair advantage (which is the case with Wiimfi's project, and some of its associated game mods that took it a step further to prevent the game from running on emulators).\n\nRequirements may include:\n\nimages of network certification files ripped from real hardware, which might be further complicated by the fact that the ones distributed online are much more likely to be banned. This is the case for Wii and Wii U online.\n\nif using custom servers, patching out the original URL addresses in the game to point at the newer servers instead. This is achieved either through Action Replay codes, or modifying the game's image with dedicated tools.\n\nSony Consoles[edit]\n\nPlayStation 2[edit]\n\nPCSX2: Has an option to connect to Sony's own servers (or replacement servers) provided the game is still up. Relevant links: How To Play PCSX2 Online (See Online PS2 games for what games still have servers up)\n\nPS2 can link to a private server by changing dns https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bbxOGm4dPxZ4Vbzyu3XxBnZmuPx3Ue-cPqBeTxtnvkQ/edit#gid=1383772811\n\nPlayStation 3[edit]\n\nHen PS3 or CFW capable of connecting a private server using the dns change method Pivate server list:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wn2EkQj_bZpgrT-xiDbqHkx91jcCHn34nXkl2Sv0GOs/edit#gid=0 RPCS3 provide server for ps3 and emulator play with other https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Netplay https://derole.co.uk/modnation/\n\nPSP[edit]\n\nAble to use psp to connect both PPSSPP servers to play online (not local) with another emulator https://myneighborsushicat.com/ https://socom.cc 1.Install plugin in CFW https://rentry.co/oemda or https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/wiki/pro_online/#wiki_prometheus_online_plugin 2.Change DNS for no CFW 3.Use the Xlink kai for Lan\n\nNintendo Consoles[edit]\n\nWii[edit]\n\nBecause Nintendo shut down its servers for Wi-Fi, it can't be connected to. Wiimmfi is the only option, but Dolphin will not be able to connect normally, as you require a normal Wii's files. This guide has instructions on how to get the certificates needed to connect to their servers, but do note that you cannot connect if you cannot run the game full speed. This also includes lag spikes that may occur. Your emulator will be banned from the servers if the game is unable to run full speed.\n\nIt's more recommended to connect via your Wii since you require files from it to play it on Dolphin, and it's risky to try with Dolphin regardless. CFG and USB Loader GX both support Wiimmfi without patching the game and do it on the fly. Looking into different custom servers than Wiimmfi is another option.\n\nWii U[edit]\n\nCemu: Supports online play pretty well, however custom servers are still not up so you'll have to risk your own Wii U's network certification files to use this feature.\n\nNintendo DS[edit]\n\nDeSmuME: Main version 0.9.7 used to include an option to connect to Nintendo's own servers, and later, the custom servers. It works pretty well. However, since the project maintainers had creative differences and decided further development on it is to stop, it was never developed any further and as such existed for a long while as unofficial forks requiring an Ethernet connection (though further workarounds were found to enable any kind of connection). Very recently, it was added back in that state to the main builds.\n\nmelonDS: A newer DS emulator by the developer who used to work on that feature, is planning online support.\n\nSega Consoles[edit]\n\nDreamcast[edit]\n\nFlycast: Auto-configured to connect to Dreamcast Live servers for games that are supported. Also supports networking for NAOMI arcade games.\n\nWhen trying to hit \"Homepage\" in game, ocasionaly crashes the emulator, but some games like PSOv1, Samba de Amigo and first revision of Jet Grind Radio are crashing only when exiting the browser. Planetweb browsers get stuck while loading pages.\n\nOther[edit]\n\nStatus of various other consoles and their emulation of online features down below, see #Hardware features and peripherals of each dedicated console/system page for more information about these.\n\nSatellaview (SNES): Custom broadcasts already can be emulated on bsnes-plus, still WIP.\n\nXBAND (Genesis/SNES/Saturn): SNES XBAND emulation revival WIP.\n\nGB Online Adapter (GBC/GBA): WIP.\n\nPhantasy Star Online (DC/GC/PC): Custom servers already up, emulation WIP.\n\nAndroid: Emulators can already connect online.\n\nSony online services (PS3): custom servers up for some games, RPCS3 can already connect these servers.\n\n3DS Nintendo Network (3DS): See Nintendo 3DS emulators#Hardware features.\n\nInactive online feature development:"
