RE: Appointment of European Union Special Representative for Tibet

Dear Members of the Council, Prospective Members of the Council, President Prodi, Commissioner Patten, Secretary General Solana, and President Cox,

We, the 265 participants from 46 countries representing the international Tibet support group movement gathered in Prague, respectfully call on the European Union (EU) to appoint at a senior level a Special Representative for Tibet without delay.

We make this call bearing in mind:

the two European Parliament (EP) resolutions calling for the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Tibet (15th January 1998 and 11th April 2002);

the allocation in the EU budget for such an appointment; and

the requests made by His Holiness the Dalai Lama for such an appointment in his address to the EP on 24th October 2001 and in his letters of 11th March 2002 to the Foreign Ministers of all 15 EU Member States.

The appointment of a EU Special Representative is in keeping with the EU’s approach to ensuring the effective implementation of EU policy and with its practice of promoting the resolution of conflicts in other regions, such as the Balkans, Caucasus and the Middle East. The value of creating such a position is well demonstrated by the US Special Coordinator for Tibet’s important contribution for that country’s policy formulation. The position has also played a central role in the development of multi-lateral strategies, the provision of humanitarian assistance, monitoring and promotion of human rights, and the development of diplomatic efforts.

The Tibetan struggle for freedom and human rights is a long-standing one, and its non-violent nature is exemplary in these times of increased violence and terrorism. Active multi-lateral engagement is necessary for the achievement of a lasting solution to this situation. The appointment of a EU Special Representative for Tibet would highlight the EU’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflicts. It would also demonstrate the European Council and Commission’s responsiveness to the strong and unwavering support for Tibet that exists among European citizens.

The situation of Tibet is now urgent. At the same time, the resumption of contacts between Envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government after 10 years and the change of leadership in China present an important new opportunity for movement on the issue of Tibet. In September 2003, the European Commission highlighted promoting dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Beijing as a priority for the EU’s bilateral political dialogue with China. As such, the EU’s immediate appointment of a Special Representative for Tibet is an effective and practical way for the member states of the EU to further the process of dialogue and negotiations between the two parties.

We thank you in advance for paying serious consideration to this issue and look forward to receiving your positive response to this widely supported proposal.

Yours sincerely,
