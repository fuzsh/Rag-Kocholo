        "text": "On October 21 more than 130 Tibet Support Groups (TSGs) from around the world signed a letter to the European Commission and other political leaders calling for the appointment of an EU Special Coordinator for Tibet.\n\nThe letter was signed and sent from the Fourth International Conference of Tibet Support Groups in Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nThe Conference, held 18 – 21 October 2003, was attended by 260 participants from 47 countries, including representatives from Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe text of the letter, TSG signatories and recipients follows below:\n\nLetter from the Fourth International Tibet Support Group Conference, Prague, Czech Republic, 18 – 21 October 2003\n\nc/o Keizersgracht 302\n\n1016 EX Amsterdam\n\nThe Netherlands\n\n21 October 2003\n\nRE: Appointment of European Union Special Representative for Tibet\n\nDear Members of the Council, Prospective Members of the Council, President Prodi, Commissioner Patten, Secretary General Solana, and President Cox,\n\nWe, the 265 participants from 46 countries representing the international Tibet support group movement gathered in Prague, respectfully call on the European Union (EU) to appoint at a senior level a Special Representative for Tibet without delay.\n\nWe make this call bearing in mind:\n\nthe two European Parliament (EP) resolutions calling for the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Tibet (15th January 1998 and 11th April 2002);\n\nthe allocation in the EU budget for such an appointment; and\n\nthe requests made by His Holiness the Dalai Lama for such an appointment in his address to the EP on 24th October 2001 and in his letters of 11th March 2002 to the Foreign Ministers of all 15 EU Member States.\n\nThe appointment of a EU Special Representative is in keeping with the EU’s approach to ensuring the effective implementation of EU policy and with its practice of promoting the resolution of conflicts in other regions, such as the Balkans, Caucasus and the Middle East. The value of creating such a position is well demonstrated by the US Special Coordinator for Tibet’s important contribution for that country’s policy formulation. The position has also played a central role in the development of multi-lateral strategies, the provision of humanitarian assistance, monitoring and promotion of human rights, and the development of diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe Tibetan struggle for freedom and human rights is a long-standing one, and its non-violent nature is exemplary in these times of increased violence and terrorism. Active multi-lateral engagement is necessary for the achievement of a lasting solution to this situation. The appointment of a EU Special Representative for Tibet would highlight the EU’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflicts. It would also demonstrate the European Council and Commission’s responsiveness to the strong and unwavering support for Tibet that exists among European citizens.\n\nThe situation of Tibet is now urgent. At the same time, the resumption of contacts between Envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government after 10 years and the change of leadership in China present an important new opportunity for movement on the issue of Tibet. In September 2003, the European Commission highlighted promoting dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Beijing as a priority for the EU’s bilateral political dialogue with China. As such, the EU’s immediate appointment of a Special Representative for Tibet is an effective and practical way for the member states of the EU to further the process of dialogue and negotiations between the two parties.\n\nWe thank you in advance for paying serious consideration to this issue and look forward to receiving your positive response to this widely supported proposal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAmigos de la Culture Tibetana Argentina, Argentina\n\nAustralia Tibet Council, Australia\n\nAustralian Tibet Society, Australia\n\nTibetan Community of Australia NSW, Australia\n\nAustralia in Tibet Ltd., Australia\n\nAustrian Committee for Tibet, Austria\n\nSave Tibet, Austria\n\nTibet Solidarity Forum, Bangladesh\n\nLes Amis du Tibet, Belgium\n\nCanada Tibet Committee, Canada\n\nGrupo de Apoyo a Tibet, Chile\n\nSociety for Croatia-Tibet Friendship, Croatia\n\nTSG Split-Croatia, Croatia\n\nLungta TSG, Czech Republic\n\nOlympic Watch, Czech Republic\n\nTibetan Community, Denmark\n\nTSG Denmark, Denmark\n\nAmigos del Tibet del El Salvador, El Salvador\n\nEstonian Mahayana Institute, Estonia\n\nCampaign for Tibet, Finland\n\nAide au Tibet, France\n\nAssociation France-Tibet, France\n\nAssociation France-Tibet 59/62, France\n\nAssociation Drome Ardeche Tibet, France\n\nClub Tibet de Strasbourg, France\n\nComite de Soutien au Peuple Tibetain, France\n\nComite de Soutien au Peuple Tibetain de l´Herault, France\n\nEco-Tibet France, France\n\nEtudiants pour un Tibet Libre, France\n\nMaison des Himalayas, France\n\nMaison du Tibet, Tibet Info, France\n\nMos Amis de l´Himalaya, France\n\nPasseport Tibetain, France\n\nReseau International des Femmes pour le Tibet, France\n\nTibetan Community in France and its Friends, France\n\nAutodetermination-Tibet, France\n\nLa Trans Himalayenne pour le Tibet, France\n\nAssociation of Tibetans in Germany, Germany\n\nInternational Campaign for Tibet, Deutschland\n\nTibet Forum, Germany\n\nTibet Initiative Deutschland e.V., Germany\n\nTibet Initiative Deutschland e.V.
