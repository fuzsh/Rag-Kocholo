        "text": "Contrary to the frat boy-styled shenanigans of American Pie, writer/director/producer/sometime actor Paul Weitz comes off as a bit of a nerd in person. Before you go getting all in a huff over the use of the word \"nerd\" keep in mind that it is not, I repeat, not intended as a slight against the man. Hell, I only spent in the neighborhood of half an hour with Mr. Weitz, so to outwardly label him as such would be rather judgmental on my part. Still, it can't be escaped that he exhibited slightly nebbish behavior during our conversation and that there is an inherent nerdiness residing at the core of just about every film he has directed and written to date. Hence the nerd application is somewhat justified.\n\nWeitz's latest cinematic endeavor is the very timely American Dreamz, a ribald parody of the current Bush administration, the seemingly never-ending Iraq war, and the Red, White, and Blue's undying obsession with American Idol. The four main storylines in the film revolve around an inept president who doesn't read (Dennis Quaid), a conniving \"trailer trash\" wannabe pop star (Mandy Moore), a self-centered British reality television host (Hugh Grant) and a purported terrorist-turned-karaoke master (Sam Golzari). It is the latter storyline that may evoke the most disdain from certain parts of the world, as the would be terrorist is painted out to actually be a Broadway show tune loving softie.\n\nDespite the serious digs at Middle Eastern terrorist cells and the current climate where messages of warning have been issued to certain Scandinavian countries, Weitz himself isn't afraid of any kind of jihad retribution a la Salman Rushdie. \"Here's the thing,\" he says with a slight chuckle. \"To be honest I was very careful not to have anything of a religious nature in the film. I was not particularly concerned about that. I think this movie is going to annoy a lot of people on some level. For example the Quaid character, which is modeled after Bush, has a fantasy element to it in that he kind of becomes redeemed during the course of the movie, he sort of becomes awakened. I'm sure that there will be a lot of people from the left side, which is probably where I'm leaning more towards myself, are gonna say that it wasn't scathing enough about that character. I think actually, sadly I've put myself in a position where if somebody wants to get annoyed with me there's any number of angles that they can take. I will say that it does not actually, to me personally, tread in the terrain of the kind of thing that would promote a fatwa against me. I was joking with Hugh Grant. When I finished the film I sent him an email saying I wanted him to see it because Hugh Grant and terrorists under the age of 25 are my core audience. The odd thing is that in the movie the show tune loving terrorist is in a way the most redeemed character in the film. So I don't imagine that that particular button will get pushed. I think there's other buttons that are more likely to get me in hot water with people.\"\n\nWatching American Dreamz one can't help but think of the progression that Weitz has made since he burst onto the scene in 1999 with American Pie. That film owed a lot to the gross-out tomfoolery of such classics as Animal House. That he followed this up with a poignant big screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel About A Boy proved that he was not a one-trick pony. Yes, there was the misstep of Down To Earth, but what did you expect? Remaking Heaven Can Wait with Chris Rock? Right. Then In Good Company touched upon the fears of losing your job to a young upstart, another \"serious\" malady afflicting the baby boomers in the new millennium. American Dreamz pointed political satire co-mingling with snaps at the vapid celebrity induced mire of reality television seems a logical (and conscious) progression from virginal teen comedy to parental comedy to socio-political comedy. Or was it?\n\n\"I mean in a way it's a progression in that the theme is a bigger theme,\" explains Weitz. \"To me the theme is if having a dream is part of an American core identity and is supposed to always be this good, positive thing. It was an examination of this idea that American's always have dreams and that's a great thing. It's sort of examining that if we all have dreams does that mean we can't deal with reality? To that extent it's a progression. In another way it's a regression. My last two films, In Good Company and About A Boy were sort of delicate and in certain ways much more sensitive movies. This one is, in a way, more akin to American Pie in terms of its broadness. But I really felt that the subject matter was so ambitious that, personally with my skill set, the way to handle them the best was to be really comedic about them. It's humanistic to the extent that characters that you might not think are redeemable, hopefully there's a possibility of getting invested in them. My personal problem with a lot of satire is that you don't care about the characters. But in the great satires like Nashville or Dr. Strangelove, you know you have this presidential character in Dr. Strangelove or the RAF pilot who Peter Sellers plays and your heart kind of goes out to them. You can kind of see why everybody, even if they're acting like an idiot, is acting in the way that they act. Butâ€¦there was something regressive about it. About A Boy and In Good Company were, in some ways, relatively worthy undertakings. They were in a vein of filmmaking that Hollywood to some degree respects, while this one felt like much more of an insane proposition.\"\n\nHelping Weitz to make the proposition less insane and in turn be more humanistic were a passel of actors that the director has called upon with increasing frequency. Grant, Quaid, Jennifer \"Stifler's Mom\" Coolidge, Chris Klein are all \"regulars\" in the Weitz cinematic universe. Does this mean that Weitz is striving for that classic DeNiro/Scorsese and Russell/Carpenter motif? \"I think the big secret of the auteur move of having the same actors in your films over and over again is that they're more likely to do your film. They know you, they know you're not crazy. You've had a good time working on a film before,\" confesses Weitz. \"I'm lucky to have these actors in it and I wouldn't have gotten it made without this group of actors. And the people I hadn't worked with before--Willem Dafoe and Marcia Gaye Harden--part of the reason that they wanted to work with me is that they'd seen Dennis Quaid in a movie of mine and they've seen Hugh Grant. It's really a great gift. On my part it's like I should be so lucky to have those two guys doing those two characters in a movie. First off, I can't imagine who else I'd want instead of them. Second off, it's easier to get a star if they've had a good experience working with you before. So it's all kind of self-serving. And it's also really fun. In this case it was very weird to have a seen with Chris Klein from American Pie and Hugh Grant. It was just such a weird combination. And even like Dennis Quaid and Hugh Grant. To see those guys in a scene together is so strange, 'cause Dennis is so American and Hugh is so British. So it was a weird folding together of the films that I'd done before.\""
