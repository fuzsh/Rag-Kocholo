        "text": "Dean “Deaner” Murdock (Paul J. Spence), the Canadian star of FUBAR: BALLS TO THE WALL has been denied entry into the US for SXSW, where the film is having its stateside premiere Monday at 9:30 pm. He is one half of the head-banging duo profiled in the film. The other half, Terry Cahill (David Lawrence) was allowed to cross the border. Murdock says, “I aint gonna take this personally; the f@#kin’ border guy who searched me was just doin’ his job, but f@#k why did he have to have such thick fingers? Giv’r to yer liv’r in my honor tonight, and fer f@#k’s sakes, wash yer denim before you cross the border.”\n\nCahill says, “It will be a total bummer partying without Dean here but sometimes when it comes to laws, you gotta do the right thing. Maybe I can find a Deaner dopple-banger in Austin who can hit those high notes.” Cahill plans to post an official video response on his twitter account later today. The trailer is below.\n\nFollow Murdock’s ordeal at his twitter page. He plans to have a cardboard understudy stand-in for him tonight."
