THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nANDERSON COOPER: As you probably know, the Sundance Film Festival going on right now in Utah was created by Robert Redford to give the small budget filmmakers a place to showcase their work, no matter how odd the film might be.\n\nPaul Clinton is in Park City with a most unique review.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nPAUL CLINTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Shotgunning beers from a stage is not the usual way to unveil a film.\n\n(on camera): But that's exactly what happened here at Sundance when \"Fubar\" a mock documentary by three young Canadian filmmakers premiered here, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) night screening (ph).\n\n(voice-over): Fubar fever has gripped the filmmakers relatives and friends. A group of them piled into an RV in Calgary for a 15- hour road trip down to Sundance. The filmmakers met up with their friends at Sundance, and are using the RV as their headquarters.\n\n(on camera): The is the quintessential Sundance movie in terms of, you know, done on a shoestring budget, and done by people with a dream of coming to Sundance, and low and behold, you're here.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Definitely.\n\nMICHAEL DOWSE, \"FUBAR\": Definitely made it with a lot of effort, a lot of passion, a lot of beer.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Straight up (ph). You didn't finish it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCLINTON: Now we are going to meet the stars of \"Fubar,\" Paul Spence and Dave Lawrence. This is Dave and Paul up here.\n\n(voice-over): They are not just stars, they're the film's creators. They maxed out their credit cards to make the film, and when the funds ran dry, Dave's dad mortgaged his house. Ironically enough -- DAVE LAWRENCE, \"FUBAR\": Definitely not the type of film for my father, trying to explain that we get dressed up and act like jackasses, and now we need some money to help -- to make it so that everyone can see us act like jack-asses.\n\nCLINTON: In the film, they are close friends, just like in real life.\n\n(on camera): So you guys have known each other, like, forever.\n\nLAWRENCE: Literally since we were born.\n\nPAUL SPENCE, \"FUBAR\": Well, literally since you were born.\n\nLAWRENCE: Right, because Paul was born three months before me.\n\nSPENCE: It was a lonely three months.\n\nCLINTON (voice-over): Now, back to the film. It's about more than hard drinking and hard rock.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, it's going to be pretty pathetic if you -- die because your pride.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nLAWRENCE: We knew that, like, if the film was just about, like, woo, party, like, bangers, that's it --\n\nCLINTON (on camera): Like \"Wayne's World.\"\n\nLAWRENCE: Yeah.\n\nSPENCE: Yeah, exactly.\n\nLAWRENCE: We knew that it would only hold, like -- we could do 20 minutes of sort of that kind of thing, but eventually you need a narrative.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fight me.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCLINTON (voice-over): The fight now is to get the film seen by a wider audience, but that's not the only battle.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSPENCE: No, no, no, no, no, no. You sit down! Yeah!\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON (on camera): They've gone into character.\n\n(voice-over): Just getting into Sundance makes this a story with a happy ending.\n\n(on camera): One, two, three.\n\nCROWD: \"Fubar\"!\n\nCLINTON (voice-over): Paul Clinton, CNN, Park City, Utah.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Coming out over here in five.\n\nCOOPER: I couldn't understand what those guys were saying, could you?\n\nJACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: No, I just did learn what Fubar means, though, unfortunately we can't share that with the folks at home. I had no idea.\n\nCOOPER: It's a term from World War II.\n\nCAFFERTY: Naughty.\n\nTO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com"
