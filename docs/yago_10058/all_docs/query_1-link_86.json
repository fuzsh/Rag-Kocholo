        "text": "A charity set up by a Hull dad who after one-punch brain injury turned his life upside down is trying to spread the word - through the power of song.\n\nPaul Spence, 37, was left with life-changing injuries after being knocked out in the toilets of a bar in Princes Avenue six years ago.\n\nHe was punched so hard he was left with severe brain injuries and struggled to recall large chunks of his past. Paul effectively had to rebuild his life and his debilitating condition took its toll on his family, causing the break-up of his relationship.\n\nHe set up PAUL for Brain Recovery to help others rebuild their lives after brain injury - and now the charity has released a song to raise awareness for brain conditions and mental health to coincide with Mental Health Awareness Week.\n\nThe charity, based at Wilberforce Health Centre, help 160 people per month who gained brain injuries after birth through providing one to one support to address issues such as mobility, anxiety and social isolation.\n\nLeigh North, who works at PAUL, said: “Brain injuries and mental health problems are often invisible as people can look ok on the outside but are actually suffering on the inside and need help.\n\n“The launch of the song has been amazing as anything to raise awareness of brain injuries and mental health just reduces the stigma around them and puts out a message that there is support out there.\n\nThe track released on May 10 and was written and performed by Paul Spence's sister in law. Lisa Spence, aged 36 and a mum of two said: “Everyone is affected by mental health issues at some point in their lives and I don’t think enough people talk about it enough.\n\n“The song lyrics are all about not judging someone by how they look, as you can’t always see that they have problems from the outside – it talks about how it’s important to talk, stand together and think about one another.\n\n“There’s been some really positive feedback and the record has touched a nerve for a lot of people that have listened to it.\n\n“I hope it makes people think.”\n\nLocal businesses helped to cover the cost of producing the song and the accompanying video, which can be viewed here.\n\nThe single called ‘Stand Together’ is now available on iTunes."
