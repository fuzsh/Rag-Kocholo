Q&A will follow the screening.\n\n14A - Advisories: Coarse Language & Substance Abuse.\n\nEight years after bursting out of their parents’ basement and into Canada’s collective consciousness, Terry (Dave Lawrence) and Dean (Paul Spence, also in this year’s PEEPERS) are back in FUBAR II. Ol’ Deaner’s cancer problems may have gone away, but the duo isn’t exactly living on easy street. When their friend Tron shows up with a plan to earn cash by working the pipelines in Fort McMurray, the boys jump in their car and head to the land of milk, honey and easy money.\n\nWith oil and Pilsner both flowing, Terry and Dean finally have time to focus on what really matters—women, rock ‘n’ roll and maintaining a healthy buzz. But with grown-up words like responsibility and consequences lingering around the bend, can the times stay good forever, or will they eventually start to suck?\n\nFUBAR writer-director Mike Dowse is back on familiar territory in this sequel to one of the most beloved films ever to come out of Alberta. Crack open a six-pack, grow a bad-ass moustache and get ready to give’r like you never gave’r before.\n\nPH"
