        "text": "13. GREEN CARD (1990)\n\nWritten and directed by Peter Weir. Starring Gerard Depardieu, Andie MacDowell, Bebe Neuwirth, Gregg Edelman, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Ann Dowd, Larry Wright, Ethan Phillips.\n\nPerhaps the most inconsequential entry in Weir’s filmography, “Green Card” is still an enjoyable enough romantic comedy. It’s your classic case of opposites attracting, with a slight twist: Gerard Depardieu (in his English-language debut) stars as a French man who enters into a marriage of convenience with an American woman (Andie MacDowell) so he can stay in the US. When they have to fake their love to the immigration department, a real one starts to grow. The box office hit took home the Golden Globe for Best Comedy/Musical Film and Best Comedy/Musical Actor for Depardieu, earning an Oscar nomination for Weir’s screenplay.\n\n12. THE CARS THAT ATE PEOPLE (1974)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Screenplay by Peter Weir, story by Weir and Keith Gow. Starring John Meillon, Terry Camilleri, Kevin Miles, Chris Haywood, Bruce Spence.\n\nWeir made his feature film debut with this underground classic that became a hit with drive-in audiences who undoubtedly enjoyed watching it within their own vehicles. “The Cars That Ate Paris” takes place in a fictional Australian town of just 148 people, who make their living by getting into auto accidents and salvaging any valuables from the wrecks. When a young traveler (Terry Camilleri) is injured and stays behind to work in the local hospital as an orderly, he soon discovers the eccentric secrets of the townspeople. Though it’s rough around the edges, it nevertheless established Weir as a major filmmaking talent on the rise.\n\n11. THE WAY BACK (2010)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Screenplay by Peter Weir and Keith Clarke, based on the memoir ‘The Long Walk’ by Slawomir Rawicz. Starring Jim Sturgess, Ed Harris, Saoirse Ronan, Colin Farrell, Mark Strong.\n\nThough it’s ostensibly based on facts, the veracity of Slawomir Rawicz’s memoir “The Long Walk” has been called into question, and when you see this film adaptation, you’ll see why. “The Way Back” tells a story that might be too good to be true, as a group of prisoners escape a Siberian gulag and trek 4,000 miles on foot to freedom during WWII. Weir fills the screen with several spectacular sights of the harsh landscape, courtesy of Russell Boyd. The human drama, meanwhile, is somewhat muted, despite strong performances from the likes of Saoirse Ronan, Ed Harris, Colin Farrell, Jim Sturgess and Mark Strong. An Oscar nominee for makeup.\n\n10. THE MOSQUITO COAST (1986)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Screenplay by Paul Schrader, based on the novel by Paul Theroux. Starring Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, River Phoenix, Conrad Roberts, Andre Gregory, Martha Plimpton.\n\nFollowing the success of their Oscar-winning “Witness,” Weir reunited with Harrison Ford for this captivating adaptation of Paul Theroux’s novel, written for the screen by Paul Schrader. “The Mosquito Coast” centers on an inventor (Ford) who becomes disenchanted with the American dream, so he uproots his family and decides to start anew in the jungles of Central America. Under Weir’s capable direction, the “Indiana Jones”/“Star Wars” star is riveting as a man whose obsession drives him to madness. Though it was ignored by the Academy, the film did manage to snag Golden Globe bids for Ford’s performance and Maurice Jarre’s score.\n\n9. GALLIPOLI (1981)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Screenplay by David Williamson, story by Peter Weir. Starring Mel Gibson, Mark Lee, Bill Kerr, Harold Hopkins, Charles Yunupingu, Ron Graham, Gerda Nicolson.\n\nWeir moved towards epic filmmaking for the first time with “Gallipoli,” a WWI drama that — along with fellow Aussie director George Miller’s “Mad Max” trilogy — helped turned Mel Gibson into an international star. He plays Frank Dunne, an idealistic young man who enlists in the Australian army along with his best friend, Archy Hamilton (Mark Lee). As they fight the bloody battle of Gallipoli in Turkey, the two soon learn the true price of warfare. A Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Film, it swept the Australian Film Institute Awards, winning eight prizes including Best Picture, Best Director for Weir and Best Actor for Gibson.\n\n8. THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY (1983)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Screenplay by Weir, David Williamson and C.J. Koch, based on the novel by Christopher Koch. Starring Mel Gibson, Sigourney Weaver, Bill Kerr, Michael Murphy Linda Hunt, Noel Ferrier.\n\n“The Year of Living Dangerously” is perhaps best remembered for its gender-bending Oscar win: diminutive Linda Hunt dressed in drag to play a male photographer and took home the Best Supporting Actress prize. But Hunt’s performance is far from the only notable quality of this sensual, evocative period drama. Mel Gibson stars as an Australian reporter covering Indonesia in 1965, when the rule of President Sukarno is crumbling and the Vietnam War is imminent. He begins a romance with a British attache (Sigourney Weaver) as the world around them becomes increasingly unstable. Weir earned a WGA nomination for his screenplay.\n\n7. THE LAST WAVE (1977)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Written by Peter Weir, Tony Morphett and Petru Popescu. Starring Richard Chamberlain, Olivia Hamnett, David Gulpilil, Fred Parslow.\n\nWeir followed up the mysterious “Picnic at Hanging Rock” with another haunting drama tinged with a hint of the supernatural. Richard Chamberlain stars as an Australian lawyer defending a group of aborigines accused of murdering a member of their tribe. Though he suspects the victim was killed for violating an ancient taboo, the defendants deny any connections to him. As he learns more disturbing aspects of the case, Chamberlain begins having apocalyptic visions involving water, making him fear for both his sanity and impending doom. With “The Last Wave,” Weir further established himself as a master of style, mood and tone.\n\n6. FEARLESS (1993)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Screenplay by Rafael Yglesias, based on his novel. Starring Jeff Bridges, Isabella Rossellini, Rosie Perez, Tom Hulce, John Turturro.\n\nFew films have captured the tightrope walk between life and death as poignantly and viscerally as “Fearless,” Weir’s endlessly fascinating character study. Adapted by Rafael Yglesias from his own novel, it features Jeff Bridges as a man who believes he’s invincible after surviving a terrible plane crash. Unable to connect to his wife (Isabella Rossellini) and family, he seeks out a fellow survivor (Rosie Perez in an Oscar-nominated role) whose infant died in the wreck, and together they find comfort in their shared experience. Weir gets masterful performances from his cast, particularly Bridges and Perez, who deal with grief in profoundly different ways.\n\n5. MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD (2003)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Screenplay by Peter Weir and John Collee, based on the novels by Patrick O’Brian. Starring Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Billy Boyd, James D’Arcy, Chris Larkin, Edward Woodall.\n\nIn adapting Patrick O’Brian’s high seas adventure novels, Weir created an epic in the grand tradition of David Lean, filled with fascinating characters and thrilling battle sequences. Set during the Napoleonic Wars, it stars Russell Crowe as a cocksure British sailor in hot pursuit of a French battle vessel. Paul Bettany costars as the ship’s surgeon, who questions the captain’s relentless quest. The film reaped 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Weir, winning for its cinematography and sound editing. Though he lost at the Academy, Weir did manage to take home the BAFTA for Best Director.\n\n4. WITNESS (1985)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Screenplay by Earl W. Wallace and William Kelly, story by Pamela Wallace, Wallace and Kelley. Starring Harrison Ford, Kelly McGillis, Josef Sommer, Lukas Haas, Jan Rubes, Alexander Godunov, Danny Glover, Viggo Mortensen.\n\n“Witness” is a thriller mixed with a love story, with some carefully observed cultural analysis thrown in as well. Harrison Ford stars as a Philadelphia police detective protecting a young Amish boy (Lukas Haas) who witnessed a murder. When it becomes clear Ford’s own bosses are involved, he goes into hiding in Haas’s isolated, technologically-devoid community to look after him and his widowed mother (Kelly McGillis), with whom he strikes up a tender love affair. The film brought Weir his first Oscar nomination for directing, earning additional bids for Ford in Best Actor and in Best Picture, winning for its screenplay and film editing.\n\n3. PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK (1975)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Screenplay by Cliff Green, based on the novel by Joan Lindsay. Starring Rachel Roberts, Dominic Guard, Helen Morse, Jacki Weaver.\n\nThere are few films as haunting and beautiful as Weir’s breakout hit, an evocative adaptation of Joan Lindsay’s bestselling novel. Set in 1900, “Picnic at Hanging Rock” involves a group of schoolgirls who travel with their teachers for an afternoon outing, only to have a few of them disappear without a trace. No explanation is ever given, and the story soon reveals itself to be more about sexual panic (typified by Rachel Roberts as the repressed headmistress) and the class system established by Europeans in Australia than about the mystery. Russell Boyd won a BAFTA for his atmospheric cinematography, which highlights our place in the natural world.\n\n2. DEAD POETS SOCIETY (1989)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Written by Tom Schulman. Starring Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Kurtwood Smith, Norman Lloyd.\n\nIt’s a story you’ve seen a thousand times: an inspirational teacher motivates his disaffected classroom to love learning and discover some new things about themselves in the process. But you’ve rarely seen it done as powerfully as it is in “Dead Poets Society.” Robin Williams stars as John Keating, a charismatic English professor at an elite boarding school in 1959. When tragedy strikes, Keating loses his job, and the students show their solidarity in a deeply moving, tear-jerking finale. The film won an Oscar for Tom Schulman’s screenplay and earned nominations for Best Picture, Weir in Best Director and Williams in Best Actor.\n\n1. THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998)\n\nDirected by Peter Weir. Written by Andrew Niccol. Starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor, Ed Harris.\n\nPerhaps no other film better predicted our obsession to document our lives with cameras than “The Truman Show,” a comedic drama about an ordinary man (a career-best Jim Carrey) who discovers that his life is actually the subject of a television show. Living in an idyllic hamlet populated by actors and overseen by a mysterious director (Ed Harris), Truman slowly realizes that his entire life has been a lie, and must decide if he wants to stay or try his hand at the real world. It’s a highly inventive satire about the nature of existence and the price of fame. Weir earned an Oscar nomination for his direction, as did Harris and screenwriter Andrew Niccol. As well, Weir took home the BAFTA for Best Director."
