        "text": "AUGUST 18th; LORD'S Day (Sunday); 2024.\n\nTHIS WEEK'S HYMN. “In The Garden” by Mr. C. Austin Miles (1868-1946). Mr. Miles was a Pharmacist. In 1892, he “abandoned” his career as a Pharmacist and began giving his full time to writing and publishing Gospel Songs. This Hymn first appeared in 1912. It is a favorite in the Care Facilities. Very many Residents can sing this Hymn without seeing the words.\n\nTHIS WEEK'S THANKSGIVING. I Timothy 2.1 says: “First of all, giving of thanks.” 1. Although there are sad features involved, still, there is much to be thankful for. Even a significant amount of the Residents would agree. Yet when Dr. Spence visited one Skilled Care, the sickness was such as that the Residents were unable to attend the Church Service. But the Activity Department contrived a plan. They brought Dr. Spence and his Son to the Chapel. They both were placed on the internal television system. Therefore although Dr. Spence and his Son conducted the Church Service in the Chapel by themselves, yet they were televised to all the rooms in the facility. Afterward, as Dr. Spence left, he remarked to the Assistant Activity Director that he thought it was great that notwithstanding the present sickness, the Church Service still went on. The Assistant said: “Your Church Service is important to us and to our Residents. I assure you, there were many hearing today. You are a favorite. Thank you for coming over.” It would be excellent if more Care Facilities had this commendable spirit. There are ways through these miserable lockdowns! THE LORD help us! 2. The Gentleman mentioned last week (who was lately seriously sick) returned to the Church Service yet again this week. The man is gaining ground and getting better! 3. A Lady who recently went through a prolonged illness is steadily improving. 4. Although last week's Church Services are now finished, they are very pleasant remembrances. Furthermore, it is hoped, they are a dear and living influence in the lives of the Residents. For last week, THE LORD gave another Day of Mercy. THE LORD blessed the Preaching of the Scripture. The Sermons were well attended. Not a few, despite much toil and trouble, consistently make it out of their rooms for these important occasions. Please pray that THE LORD will bless His Word to the souls of those who hear. 5. A Care Facility Owner, besides giving most generously, sent Dr. Spence Home with more than three boxes of fine foods. A hearty thank you to those who financially support the work in the Care Facilities. Judges 3.9 says: “And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised up a Deliverer.”\n\nSPECIAL THANKSGIVING. This month marks exactly 28 years since Dr. Spence commenced serving full time many Care Facilities in Southwestern Pennsylvania. We are specially thankful this month for the Goodness and the Grace of GOD in both opening up the door to these Homes and the sweet continuation of this Work for all these years. To GOD be the Glory! And may many souls be brought to JESUS and built up in the Christian Faith through these ongoing labors.\n\nTHIS WEEK'S PRAYERLIST. These Prayer Requests have been made in part by different Residents and Staff in the Care Facilities. 1. Many Residents are concerned for their Families. Some of these Families are passing through hard times. 2. Two Ladies who desire to walk again. 3. New Residents who have moved into different places. 4. Pray that other Care Facilities will receive more Residents. 5. Another Home that is able to take care of more Residents. Judges 3.10 says: “And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him.” *In the Thanksgiving and Prayerlist sections, the names of the people have been withheld to protect their privacy. Nevertheless, the Thanksgivings and Prayer Requests are real and actual.\n\nTHIS WEEK'S COLPORTAGE REPORT. 1. Last week, besides Dr. Spence's visits in his weekly Care Facilities, on one of his days off, he attended to Colportage work among Care Facilities he does not visit. For about 6 hours and 155 miles, 8 Letters and 90 Printed Sermons were distributed in 9 Care Facilities located in Weirton, West Virginia and Wintersville, Ohio. Some Notes on the day— First: In general, the Aides, Nurses, Activity Director, and Receptionists were pleasant, respectful, and cheerful. Second: In particular, in one place, the Nurse explained the arrangement of the two Care Facilities to Dr. Spence and invited him during his visit that day to do as he pleased. Third: Overall, it was a very good day. It was plainly evident that the Printed Sermons were put in places where they were desired and will be read. Now that this lesser work has been done, THE LORD do the Greater Work, take the Glory, and use these Sermons greatly to do lasting good to precious souls. 2. Would you read a King James Version Bible or New Testament? We also have the Book of Psalms in Braille. These dear Books are gently used. They come in different sizes. Many Residents have left these Books for Dr. Spence during the past years. If you or someone you know would use one or two of these Books, please contact us. The Books and postage are free."
