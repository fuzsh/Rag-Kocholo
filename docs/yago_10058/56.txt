Starring David Lawrence and Paul Spence. Rated 18A. Opens Friday, October 1, at the Cinemark Tinseltown

One round with Alberta hosers Dean and Terry (Paul Spence and David Lawrence, respectively) was enough for some viewers, no doubt. And yet, somewhere within the parka-clad, pilsner-swilling hearts of many Canucks between the coasts, curiosity welled regarding what Calgary’s finest might be up to eight years later. Fubar II takes care of that no problem, eh?

Things get off to a bongtastic start when the Deaner celebrates five years of being cancer-free—he’s already down to his last will and testicle—by drinking, snorting, and smoking everything in sight, leading to the total destruction of our pale pals’ (barely) rented bungalow. Pretty familiar shenanigans, but things turn interesting when the homeless buds take up an offer from the epically stoned Tron (Andrew Sparacino) of jobs up in The Mac, meaning the oil sands of Fort McMurray.

That surreal environment and headbangers like this with actual employment are two realities rarely depicted, so the sight of the Fuboys givin’r in such a lunar landscape is intriguing as well as raucously inappropriate. (Picture Bob and Doug McKenzie with blowtorches and big trucks and you get some idea.) A major dilemma arrives when Terry hooks up with a size-large strip-club waitress (Terra Hazelton), leaving Dean out in the cold—except for the trio’s side trip to the West Edmonton Mall.

Even as it edges toward a snowbound Christmas, director Michael Dowse’s largely improvised film has surprisingly dark twists, represented by someone’s worry that Dean’s illness could leave him “walkin’ around with an empty sack, like Santa Claus on Boxing Day”. As revolting as the Great White trashiness gets in Fubar II, you’ll want to see our guys make it to another year—or even another Roman numeral.
