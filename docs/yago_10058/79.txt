Fubar's Paul Spence, a.k.a. Deaner, hits the road with Nightseeker Back to video

It would be interesting to ask Calgary native Paul Spence about his complex relationship with Dean Murdoch, the moustached cancer survivor and committed metal head who the actor has played in two Fubar movies.

Interesting because the line between actor and character, already a bit fuzzy when it comes to faux documentaries, continued to blur as Spence made appearances and conducted media interviews for 2010’s Fubar II as the Deaner, complete with ’stache, stringy black wig and arsenal of new and inventive ways to drop the f-bomb.

Interesting, but impossible. Because it’s not Spence who comes to the phone to promote the Canada-wide Fubar’s Deaner on Tour, but the Deaner himself.

And, on this day, he’s in fine form: excited, foul-mouthed, occasionally perplexed and anxious to pontificate about his fledgling metal career as he plans for a raucous cross-country run with his band, Nightseeker.“Since I got famous I’ve got nesting zones all over the country,” he says. “People will invite me to their house. They say ‘We’ll give you a bus ticket and just come and party at our house, we’ll pay for the beer.’ Sometimes it’s just a guy having a birthday party and they want basically like a party professional. They’ll bring me in, I’ll hang out and this little nesting pad happens and I end up staying there two, three weeks. I was in Windsor for three days and I didn’t even know I was there.”

Such geographic confusion isn’t likely to relent in the next couple of weeks. Deaner is now in the midst of a tour that will eventually take him from Vancouver to Montreal, hitting a good number of small towns along the way.

“In places like Prince George, they told me I’m actually going to be able to meet Prince George, which is pretty cool,” he says. “In Lloydminster, they were like: ‘We’re going to give you a pass so you can party in Alberta and Saskatchewan all night.’ ”

Nightseeker, Dean explains, fits somewhere between Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden in the metal spectrum and will be playing a number of songs from the soundtracks of both Fubar films. The Deaner will be offering live commentary as Fubar II is screened.

He also sings and plays a newly purchased “warlock” bass, which he recently christened with a blood ceremony alongside his three bandmates.

“We got some fake blood and blessed it real good,” he says.

While he realizes heavy metal is not a genre that gets a lot of respect in some circles, he stands by his act’s live shows and is determined to prove the hipper-than-thou tastemakers wrong. Granted, the Deaner’s explanation of Nightseeker’s appeal is a touch cryptic.

“The tastemakers and the critics, they’ll be like ‘I like my music green,’ ” he explains. “Whereas, let’s say our music is so purple that it’s black. They’re expecting to not like it. But the show they are going to get — they’re going to have to like it. Nightseeker isn’t just about playing a bunch of songs, we put on a show. It’s kinda like … well, not the circus because the circus has a funny smell to it. Well, so do we but not as bad … well, you know what I mean.”

Sure.

But doesn’t the non-stop partying get to him sometimes, particularly given his fragile health? As Fubar fans know, the continuing story of Dean and his childhood pal Terry (played by Dave Lawrence) includes the former’s battle with testicular cancer. But his ability to withstand heroic levels of alcohol is well-chronicled in both films, which often leads to shotgun challenges while on the road.

“I won’t say no to a challenge, but because of what I’ve been through I don’t mind being defeated,” he says. “These days, I tend to sip my beers rather than chugging them. But I can still shotgun. I even get chicks coming up to me and saying ‘I bet you’ve never been out-shotgunned by a chick before.’ And I’m like ‘You haven’t met my mother.’ But it’s hard to say no to a chick, especially if there’s a lot of other people around.”

Which brings up another bonus of being famous: groupies. It’s a topic the Deaner seems unusually shy about discussing. He eventually acknowledges, though, that his “nesting zones” are often overseen by the fairer sex.

“You wouldn’t know this, but some of the nicest people you ever meet are in Kamloops,” he says. “It’s a really great nesting zone. I ain’t going to name names because I might get sued.”

The Fubar tour hits Toronto Dec. 1, Ottawa Dec. 2 and Montreal Dec. 3. For more information, visit myspace.com/deadlynightseeker.
