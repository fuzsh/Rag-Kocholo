His music memorializes places in New England, and celebrates the American character. We celebrate him, and wish to preserve this particular place in New England as a living tribute to his memory.\n\nEliza Morrison, Spring City, PA, 19475, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThe music of Charles Ives has always been tremendously moving and inspiring to me as a musician. Please preserve this cherished piece of Americana.\n\nlinda kouvaras, Melbourne, 3052, Australia, 2012-09-15\n\na unique piece of very important cultural history\n\nMartin Skews, Penryn, Cornwall, TR10 9BL, United Kingdom, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is to this day revered as one of the great American composers of the 20th Century. His contribution to American classical music is immeasurable and his memory deserves to be preserved and enduring. The eradication of his home would be nothing more than a desecration of his legacy, and the despicable act itself would represent and confirm the apparent attitude of our current zeitgeist towards 20th Century art and music; a disgraceful attitude of insouciance and insensitivity. He was an important man who left an important legacy. Preserve it. Do not destroy it.\n\nJ H, Sanibel, FL, 33957, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThe great American composer Charles Ives deserves to have his historical legacy preserved.\n\nKeane Southard, Northborough, MA, 01532, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is an American treasure.\n\nBob Hepburn, Philadelphia, PA, 19120, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nHistorical significance!\n\nRobynne White, Kilsyth, 3137, Australia, 2012-09-15\n\nHe left us a wonderful legacy so let’s preserve his history.

Musical and otherwise.\n\nSusan Daily, Branford, CT, 06405, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThis house is an important part of music history. It should be preserved for students of today and of future generations.\n\nMatthew Coleman, Bridgeport, CT, 06605, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is one of the most important composers ever, and certainly one of the top few most important American composers.\n\nCalvin Moore, La Grange Park, IL, 60526, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThis an important historical site that is irreplaceable if we lose it. It is a remnant of one the greatest artists to have ever lived, we cannot lose it due to mere money. It’s worth is incalculable, immeasurable.\n\nBruce Kinney, Amherst, NH, 03031, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nHistorical treasures, once lost, can never be replaced.\n\nHarold Weller, Las Vegas, NV, 89117, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is one of our nation’s preeminent composers. His home and workplace should be preserved out of respect for the musical legacy he left our country for present and future generations to learn and be closer to this great man.\n\nChris Mandra, Baltimore, MD, 21231, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is a part of the cultural fabric of the united states. It would be a shame to lose the ability to see his home as he lived in it. He was a pioneer and patriot and should be exalted.\n\nDaniel Goffus, Jackson Center, PA, 16133, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nOut of respect to what innovation he brought to music, our culture, and our country.\n\nJonathan Dore, Saffron Walden, CB11 4DW, United Kingdom, 2012-09-15\n\nDear Mr Tyler\n\nYou made a great effort to preserve this house for forty years after your grandmother died. Why throw that away now, when wellwishers around the world are so close to being able to match the offer you want? Once lost, the house can never be replaced.\n\nShari Ebert, Kankakee, IL, 60901, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nImportant to me as I am a musician, musicologist and a music educator!!! Charles Ives’ home needs to be protected as an historic landmark – his music was a landmark as well!!!\n\nTherry Neilsen-Steinhardt, Brookline, NH, 03033, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is THE american composer, and his traces are sacred to our national identity.\n\nSteven Ledbetter, Worcester, MA, 01610, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThis long-time home of the QUINTESSENTIAL American composer is a monument to the American spirit and American art.

His legacy deserves to be preserved.\n\nEllen Nordby, Surprise, AZ, 85387-2783, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nIf this site were merely the land where Ives once lived, perhaps this sale wouldn’t seem so tragic, but the fact that his belongings and work space are still intact — and could serve to give context to his creative accomplishments — makes a sale and possible destruction all the more devastating.\n\nKim Scown, New York, NY, 10019, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThis link to an icon of our cultural heritage should be preserved as a museum, not razed to promote another sterlized enclave for those who do not honor his enormous contribution to 20th C. art.\n\nJonathan Crane, Mililani, HI, 96789, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is one of the greatest American Composers. His music is uniquely American and there is not much of that in the Classical tradition. This house needs to be preserved and used as a place for modern artists to be creative.\n\nPhilip Gavitt, Saint Louis, MO, 63139, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives and his music were/are both national treasures, and this house belongs on the National register of Historic Places.\n\nGlendower Jones, Fayetteville, AR, 72701, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThis is a National Treasure! You may not know it but a lot of us do. Please think about this. Charles Ives is on of the major cornerstones of twentieth century music.\n\nHeather Thayer, Arkadelphia, AR, 71923, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nI am musician and understand the significance of Charles Ives. We need to preserve our history. People will travel to see his home in many many years to come.\n\nVance R. Koven, Boston, MA, 02124, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nAs a composer who thinks Charles Ives was not only *a* great American composer, but (so far) *the* greatest American composer, I believe that these traces of our nation’s cultural heritage should be preserved and presented in a public way to the country, as a reminder and, ideally, as a conveyor of a rich cultural heritage. There are scarcely any monuments to the great figures in American culture. No one should ask you to make a major financial sacrifice, but you should give a fair chance to those who would buy and preserve it, even if it takes them a while to raise the money. This is not so much a personal tribute as it is a signal to the nation that it has high cultural aspirations and a precedent for achieving them.\n\nJill Otoole, Pineville, LA, 71360, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is an important part of American music history. He’s writing has brought such beauty to this world.\n\nAnnette Nielsen, Charleston, SC, 29414, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nI am originally from Danbury, and Ives was a huge influence on my musical training – my college thesis was about his musical legacy!\n\nAndrew Desiderio, Philadelphia, PA, 19107, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives’ influence on American music is comparable to Whitman’s on poetry and Edison’s on science. Please do not let another vestige of our culture slip away into oblivion.\n\nJohn Page, Exeter, NH, 03833, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nPreserving Charles Ives house is a cultural imperative for all those who care about America, its heritage and its contribution to global civilization. It represents true American greatness at a time when that message is more important than ever. Can you imagine the Smithsonian selling off the Apollo 11 command module? This is just as significant. Please reconsider.\n\nEileen Clark, Brooklyn, NY, 11205, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nOver the years, many of us professional singers who cherish Charles Ives have been at this spot and performed at various Ives events in Conn. We cherish the hours that we can spend studying and performing the music of Charles Ives, unlike any composer that has lived to date. Perfectly American music, many layered, always encouraging us to think. Please allow the Charles Ives House to be in the hands of the Ives Society and not the hands of a private buyer. Preserve this place, in tact, for us, for those who have yet to learn about Charles Ives, and for yourselves to be proud of lifelong. Thanks, Eileen Clark, soprano\n\nMichael Shaffer, St. Simons Island, GA, 31522, United States, 2012-09-15,\n\nHe was America’s Beethoven.\n\nKJ Theil, Brooklyn, NY, 11223, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nIves’ home is an important piece of our musical history and needs to be preserved. A society is only as good as the things it values.\n\nDouglas Keilitz, New York, NY, 10024, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThe life, music, letters, and memos of Charles Ives has held a tremendous influence over my own journey as a professional musician. As a teenager, I was fascinated with the originality and experimental nature of Ive’s work; I could also relate to his younger years as he was trying to push against the walls of musical conformity. As a student at the Mannes College of Music in the 1970’s, I was aware of the townhouse Ives lived in on the same block (164 East 74th Street) as my school (157 East 74th Street). I have never taken the detour to see the West Redding house, and now I wish I have…especially since reading how intact it is. I hope you’ll consider, in an age where so much of the past is discarded, how important the life and works of your grandfather are, not just in the musical sense, but also in the developmental and cultural fabric that is America. History has proven time and again that it is not only the works of creative people that are important in our understanding of them, but also the environment in which they created these works. This house is a hugely important aspect of one of America’s most original creative geniuses…I hope and pray that you’ll reconsider your decision and find a way to work with the Charles Ives Society.\n\nJay Krush, Philadelphia, PA, 19103, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nAt a time when the accomplishments of our great artistic geniuses are being marginalized, any efforts at preserving their legacy and demonstrating their cultural importance as doubly important! Plus I LOVE the work of Charles Ives!\n\nVictor Rosenbaum, Brighton, MA, 02135, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nAs a musician, I feel that a place of such historic importance documenting the life and work of a great American composer should be preserved as a museum and for creative programs.\n\nPhyllis Whitehouse, Long Island City, NY, 11101, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nAs a musician, I support a project that will benefit musicians for a very long time in such an historic place.”\n\nRick Villodas, Danbury, CT, 06810, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nwe have to preserve the vanishing, beauty and history of upper Fairfield county.\n\nlubica horvath, rossland, V0G1Y0, Canada, 2012-09-15\n\nimportant heritage\n\nFoley Schuler, Muskegon, MI, 49441, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThe home of one of America’s greatest creative figures is a national treasure and must be preserved–and made available to the public and for future generations!\n\nCarol Heinick, Norwood, NY, 13668, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nThe arts should live on – vote Obama.\n\nMary-Elizabeth Poore, New York, NY, 10025, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is a most important composer in the fabric of American music. Preserving his home gives the respect the composer so rightly deserves. The Charles Ives foundation has the wish to honor Ives and his considerable contribution to our musical world, to maintain the home for music lovers of all ages to experience and enjoy.\n\nAlice Lindsay, Williamsburg, VA, 23185, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nGreat quartets…lots of energetic American music.\n\nChris Kies, Durham, NH, 03824, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is a premier icon of American (i.e. of the United States) music, and his legacy, incuding personal effects, papers, domicile etc. must be preserved for the sake of history and for all musicians of the future.\n\nRose Pruiksma, Lewiston, ME, 04240, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives’s cultural legacy, left behind in his music, resonates deeply with the students whom I regularly introduce to the beauties & challenges of his musical legacy. As part of my teaching, I always use images of the Ives house, emphasizing his New England roots (something else that resonates with my mostly New England area students). Ives’s music is an important piece of American history, and his powerful, individual musical vision has inspired many beyond him. Preserving the space in which he lived and worked will preserve an important piece of our collective history. Imagine Vienna without at least one of Beethoven’s houses, or one of Mozart’s dwellings. Ives is as important a figure in American music (& in twentieth-century music period) as any of the European composers for whom homes and work spaces remain intact, allowing individuals to experience a sense of the past by stepping into the composer’s sanctuary. It would be a grievous loss to our cultural heritage were this house to be sold in this way. A year after taking American music with me, one of my students (originally from Russia) came back to me looking for the exact recording of Charles Ives songs that I had used in class, because the music had stayed so powerful in his memory that he wanted to obtain his own copy. This small incident is only one testimony to the ongoing vitality of Charles Ives’s music.\n\nRandall Rick, Buraydah, 11512, Saudi Arabia, 2012-09-15\n\nI believe the Charles Ives house should be preserved as a study center and museum for both the general public and musicians to gain benefit from.\n\nAdam Gallant, Assonet, MA, 02702, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nI love the music of Charles Ives\n\nBeverly Ramstrom-Manning, Manchester, NH, 03103, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nAs a musician I believe this is an important historical part of our musical heritage.\n\nEmily Poworoznek, Durham, NH, 03824, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives was one of the preeminent American composers in terms of both his use of American themes and the enduring greatness of his music. In addition, he was a truly innovative composer. Having helped to save the Edward Hopper House in Nyack, NY, and having visited it many times since, I can attest to the humbling and inspiring impact of experiencing the surroundings that a great artist inhabited. You hold the keys to a great American treasure. I hope that you will reconsider its future, based on its unique potential to inspire future generations to new insights about Charles Ives, his music, and the American traditions that inspired him. Thank you.\n\nRodney Grondin, Rochester, NH, 03867, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives contributed so much to America’s music as an outstanding composer of his generation. Preserving his home as a musical legacy for future generations of composers serves as a wonderful and inspiring place as a study center and museum for musicians, composers – both present and future – and lovers of the arts. I am deeply saddened to hear of Ives’s house being disposed of in such a manner without regard to the man who contributed so much as a great New England composer.\n\nEric Chasalow Newtonville, MA, 02460, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nthere is no composer more important to the place of American Music in the world. Please allow some time to preserve this important legacy. Eric Chasalow, Irving G. Fine Professor of Music, Brandeis University.”\n\nChristopher Bell, EH91DT, United Kingdom, 2012-09-15\n\nA place of pilgrimage, an historic house, a connection with one of the most innovative composers in in early 20th Century\n\nApril Lindevald, Babylon, NY, 11702, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nAs a lifetime musician, I know that CharlesIves was a pioneer who shaped the face of American music for the last century, and appreciate the value of preserving his history, as we do for other great figures in our culture.\n\nSusanna MÃ¤lkki, Paris, 75012, France, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is not only a great American composer, but one of the great minds of the history of western music. His inventiveness and creative output has been an immeasurable inspiration for composers and musicians for a over century, and it still is.\n\nNardo Poy, New York, NY, 10040, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives was one of the most important American composers of the 20th Century snd as such, it would be a tragedy to have the home of this most important historical figure in the American arts demolished. Mr. Ives was an innovator not only in music, but was also considered an innovator in his other chosen field, insurance. Both, musicians and those in the insurance field, consider him one of the most important figures in their respective fields. It would be a great tribute to this great man if the house could be purchased and converted into a museum in his honor.\n\nJulie Stivers, Grand Rapids, MI, 49503, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nApart from loving his music, I also think that preserving the homes of very creative people is important to the cultural heritage of the country. Ives was truly a pioneer in American music and I would love to be able to visit his home.\n\nHelmut Zapf, Panketal, 16341, Germany, 2012-09-15\n\nCharles Ives is one of the important composers at the beginning if the 20.century and it was a great moment when I have been in the house in 2000.\n\nSasha Millwood, Cambridge, CB3 0JG, United Kingdom, 2012-09-15\n\nThis house was not only occupied by Ives, it was commisioned and designed by him. Save it from being replaced by another bland real-estate clone building.\n\nLisa Westerterp, Haarlem, 2023WK, Netherlands, 2012-09-15\n\nIves is one of the most original composers of American music. Of course his house needs to be preserved! Stephen Foster’s house can still be seen on the campus of U. of Pittsburgh\n\nvalÃ©rie Gabail, paris, 75006, France, 2012-09-15\n\nA house who has been hosting a creator is always some sort of a temple for me.\n\ndavid verdier, Paris, 75018, France, 2012-09-15\n\nSaving this house.\n\nVictoria Wolfe, East Islip, NY, 11730, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nFor shame, the almighty dollar has kidnapped your honor.\n\nMolly Grose, New York, NY, 10128, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nIt is such an inspiration to be able to see the homes of great artists.\n\nJackie Kahle, Wilton, NH, 03086, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nOur greatest American composer, we must preserve his house and our heritage\n\nAngela Mace, Durham, NC, 27708, United States, 2012-09-15\n\nAs a scholar of the Mendelssohn family, I regret very much the decision to tear down the Mendelssohn house in Berlin in the 1890s – please preserve this important piece of musical history!\n\nGianluca Cangemi, Monreale (PA), 90046, Italy, 2012-09-15\n\nLet’s put it simply: I care about the salvation of Ives’s House because I’m a human being! (and a music composer).\n\nalan page, Guildford, GU1 1PQ, United Kingdom, 2012-09-15\n\nIt’s an important cultural and historical artifact and to even consider demolishing it is simply appalling\n\nAnn Frederking, Ottawa, K1J 6G4, Canada, 2012-09-15\n\nThe music of Charles Ives is groundbreaking. Keeping the house for the Charles Ives Society is a very fitting tribute.\n\nHiroshi HATANO, Nibancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 1020084, Japan, 2012-09-16\n\nAt present we often feel everything through internet. But, you have a duty to leave great unknown composer Ives’s real life, his circumstance and his air.\n\nShannon Sullivan, Palm Bay, FL, 32907, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nThis is too beautiful to destroy.\n\nMaria Benotti, Essex, MA, 01929, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nI am a musician who loves Ives’ violin sonatas.

Jones, New York, NY, 10003, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nYou don’t have to be a musician to have a sense of awe when you encounter a place where something truly great was inspired. Why would you not want the “”Society”” to take it over and allow others to visit?\n\nclinton adams, parkville, MD, 21234, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nThis is important to America for the same reason that the birthplaces of great composers in Europe are important: people like Ives have exerted tremendous influence on the culture, and it is proper to preserve relics associated with them.\n\nHenry Hooker, Knoxville, TN, 37922, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nI am a musician and love and respect Charles Ives music. I also used to live in Philadelphia and played in the Reading Symphony. I have visited this house. It is too wonderful to destroy. It is a historic landmark of the utmost significance. Who could possibly even think of destroying it?\n\nRichard Schneider, New York, NY, 10025, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nIf all that matters to you is money, you will be unswayed by petitions or pleas no matter how numerous or eloquent. Your grandfather Charles Ives is a historical and cultural icon in American music. If you allow this home and studio to be wrecked for cash in your pocket from real estate developers, you will live the rest of your life in shame and infamy.\n\nJames Citron, Vernon, CT, 06066, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nCharles Ives is one of the most important “”classical”” composers who ever lived and his home should remain a national monument and museum for future generations to appreciate, just like those of the great European composers.\n\nCarol Rosenblith, Waban, MA, 02468, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nCharles Ives was so far ahead of his time â€“ his music embodies an essence and spirit of early twentieth century American life, and his unique and imaginative musical approach has had so much influence in the last 100 years – The home where so much music was created is a true treasure, and once lost, would be irreplaceable. Once gone, that link to the past would no longer be there to keep that past from being forgotten â€“ and that would be the real loss. At the end of the day, what we are and what we create all comes from – and is influenced by, for better or worse, – our past – and the better we understand our past, the better we will create for the future.\n\nS. Elizabeth Searle, New York, NY, 10024, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nBecause Charles Ives is a major (and, to many of us, beloved) American composer.

I hope you can find a way to preserve it for generations to come, rather than for a one-time personal gain.\n\nMarsha Johnson, Chelsea, MA, 02150, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nAs a singer married to a composer, this composer is especially significant. Also, my childhood piano teacher, re tired from W. Conn. state piano dept. helped to get a center created to his memory there, Howard Tuvelle. My husband grew up near Ives home and knew about him from a young age. This photo is so evocative…Ives was extraordinary for living his business life and composing original music for a very long period. Very few Americans can recognize his importance and this preservation could help to increase awareness about his contribution to American culture.\n\nDavid Perry, New Bedford, MA, 02740, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nI love some of Charles Ives music and would like to visit the house.\n\nSara Glidden, West Roxbury, MA, 02132, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nIves’ contribution to American music is invaluable – it is an important part of the American cultural legacy\n\nIan Shanahan, Dundas Valley, 2117, Australia, 2012-09-16\n\nIves is a composer of international importance – a milestone in the history of Western music.

I am stating this poorly because I cannot fully put into words what CEI has meant to me for the past 60 years (I am 78 years old).\n\nHollas Longton, Victoria, V8N 3W3, Canada, 2012-09-16\n\nI am a composer.

I am speechless about the fact that things like this can happen.\n\nBas Wiegers, Amsterdam, 1052 GT, Netherlands, 2012-09-16\n\nCharles Ives is one of the real geniuses of American music.

Do the right thing, Mr Tyler!\n\nMassimiliano Messieri, Borgo Maggiore, 47893, San Marino, 2012-09-16\n\nCharles IVES belongs to the history of music, his life, the choice to live and write in a house rather than all in the other also belongs to the history of music. Delete this means wiping out a culture, to delete a part of music history and much of the American musical culture. Unless this is not the beginning of a project to clear classical music….\n\nAndrew Deakin, Dalton in Furness, LA15 8RZ, United Kingdom, 2012-09-16\n\nThe music written by your Grandfather and equally the life he lived was an inspiration to me as a teenager 40 years ago. Ives importance as an American composer and cultural icon can not be over estimated. The house is central to our understanding and celebration of his life and work. But of course you know this already. Please, please do what is right. Thank you.\n\nKatherine Posner, Raleigh, NC, 27617, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nCharles Ives was one of the premier composers of the twentieth century.

Our society should be adamant about preserving every shred of his history that is left to us — not only for us but for the unborn who will love and need that history more than we.\n\nCharles Rudin, Allentown, NJ, 08501, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nIves was our first truly AMERICAN composer, and probably still our greatest.

The international reach of his influence continues across generations, his legacy as perhaps the first truly American composer is immense. It is quite unbelievable to me, living outside the UK but having lived in the USA and with an American Phd in Music that his house is not being preserved as an important historical landmark and place for celebrating his work and life.\n\nWilliam Eley, Portsmouth, NH, 03801, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nIves remains a monumental American artist, and using his home to remember him and support music is a unique, wonderful possibility – it must be done!\n\nD Williams, McKinney, TX, 75070, United States, 2012-09-16\n\nI’m a music teacher planning a lesson on Charles Ives for this week.

I discovered this when I wrote my undergraduate dissertation on nostalgia in Charles Ives’s music. The Ives house should remain as a document of his life and a monument to his achievement, as well as the birthplace of twentieth-century American modern classical music – Ives would meet and write to dozens of younger composers at this house.

Scholars and fans alike deserve the chance to know his history, study it and learn. What a sad thing if such a landmark property is lost! When there’s a will, there’s ALWAYS a way–even in our present economy. There are people out there who care about this. I am merely one of many.\n\nJohn Grimes, Newtonville, MA, 02458, United States, 2012-09-17\n\nDear Mr. Tyler: During the summer of 1968, at the age of 22 and just following my graduation from the Univ. of Miami, I drove from Florida to Hanover, NH to attend a music festival. Along the way, I had determined to see the Ives house and what collection of memorabilia might exist at the Danbury Public Library. At that time, the house, if I recall correctly, was in pretty poor condition and efforts were being made to preserve it as a landmark museum representing something of the best that our American culture has had to offer the world. Your great grandfather Mr. Ives was/is a legendary maverick individual who confronted the musical norms of his day with fresh, creative and original ideas that have made a deep mark upon the development of American music . He was in many ways my hero during that time and my visit to Danbury and to W. Redding where I caught a glimpse of the old house proved inspirational for the rest of my career to this day.\n\nI can’t tell you the countless young musicians of all fields (classical, rock, jazz) that have been gripped by the novelty and uniqueness of Mr. Ives’ iconoclastic vision of the musical soundscape that is Americxa. While his ideas were indeed novel, he came from a very solidly rooted New England tradition depicted by 19th century villages, old houses, an entrenched conservative yankee culture linking a previous era to the modern day world that was about to explode around us.\n\nThe fact he possessed both those old Yankee roots and another foot in downtown Manhattan Island where he worked in the insurance business, again speaks to the kind of unique transitional individual that he was among us. He had to balance the need for family survival with is rare and exceptional talents and love of music. He managed to pull it off although it cost him the price of good health in the end.\n\nTo sell the house into a future of anonymity and obscurity does a great disservice to the legacy of Mr. Ives. In other parts of the world, the homes and places where Handel, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Sibelius, Carl NIllson, Shostakovitch, etc. inhabited and worked have been preserved for future generations so that our progeny can get a real birdseye view of the good things in our history we should nurture and cultivate.\n\nThere is so much going wrong with the world today, but keeping alive Charles Ives’ legacy is not one of those things. On the contrary, it is something we as Americans can be extremely proud to say we have contributed to western civilization. Please do not sell this house into anonymity. Perhaps the preservation group will be able to up the ante some more and offer you something competitive with the most recent cash offer. In any event, kindly do not act in a rash manner. This is perhaps a much larger issue than you are inclined to see at this time. Thank you kindly for reading. Respectfully,\n\nJohn E.
