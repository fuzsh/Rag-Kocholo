        "text": "Trust celebrities to deliver the goods. 2008 was no different, as they went about their business of marrying, divorcing and clawing each other's eyes out in court with great passion.\n\nManjusha Radhakrishnan looks back at some of the stars who left an indelible impression in the past 12 months.\n\nHitched\n\nMariah Carey and Nick Cannon\n\nWhen: April 30\n\nThe way they like it? Their whirlwind romance and their hasty nuptials may have taken everybody by surprise, but their secret sunset ceremony at the popstar's Bahamian Windemere Island estate was a hit. At least the ceremony put to rest questions as to whether the 17-carat, $2.5 million (Dh9.18 million) engagement ring was just an attention-grabbing gimmick to up the sales of Carey's latest album.\n\nSanjay Dutt and Manyata\n\nWhen: February\n\nThe way they like it? Troubled Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt chose to stay away from the usual song-and-dance wedding extravaganza and chose to solemnise his vows at a court in Goa as per the Hindu rituals.\n\nThird time lucky?: Charlie Sheen and Brooke Mueller\n\nWhen: May 30\n\nThe way they like it? Clad in a Reem Acra gown, Mueller exchanged vows with her long time boyfriend Sheen in an intimate ceremony at a Beverly Hills estate.\n\nHe said: \"I was telling a couple of friends last night that this feels like my first real marriage. The first one was a show, the second one was a con, and this one is the real deal,\" Sheen was quoted in a popular magazine.\n\nPower packed couple: Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni\n\nWhen: February 2\n\nThe way they like it? Twice-divorced Sarkozy, who became the first bachelor president of France, altered his single status in a jiffy by marrying the supermodel-turned-songwriter Carla Bruni at a civil ceremony at the Elysee Palace. It took him just three months of dating the leggylicious model to pop the question.\n\nFinally they did it wedding: Beyonce Knowles and Jay Z\n\nWhen: April 4\n\nThe way they like it? Shrouded in secrecy, the superstar couple who have dated for the last five years made it official in an intimate rooftop ceremony in New York.\n\nThe longest survivor award: Morgan Freeman and Myrna Colley-Lee\n\nSurvival period: 8 years of dating plus 24 years of marriage\n\nTheir parting shot: The Academy award winner may have survived a car crash, but he was not able to salvage his three-decade long relationship with his college sweetheart Myrna. Perhaps that's because he was travelling with his mistress in the fated vehicle.\n\nNo frills quckie wedding: Jessica Alba and Cash Warren\n\nWhen: May 19\n\nThe way they like it? Here is one couple who said their \"I dos\" in a clinical courthouse in Beverly Hills. The highlights included getting married under an arch studded with fake white flowers, applying for a marriage licence, waiting 40 minutes for them to process it and having the witness provided by the court as their only guest.\n\nParty girl: Seven months later, they threw a big wedding reception. \"Everyone I know hates weddings. I've been to very big, beautiful and romantic weddings, but I would rather just throw a big party,\" was Alba's line of defence.\n\nJames Gandolfini and Deborah Lin\n\nWhen: September 1\n\nThe way they like it? A 20-minute ceremony at the Lin's hometown Honolulu in Hawaii and a church wedding at the\n\nhistorical Central Union Church was the beginning of their road to marital bliss.\n\nPete Wentz and Ashlee Simpson\n\nWhen: May 17\n\nThe way they like it: With the help of the wedding planner Mindy Weiss, Simpson brought to life her fairytale wedding. A private ceremony at her parents' Los Angeles home and an Alice In Wonderland themed reception is just scratching the surface of the extravagant affair. Even the ring bearer — English Bulldog Hemingway — was looking dandy in an Elizabethan collar coat.\n\nCall of the wild?: Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds\n\nWhen: September 27\n\nThe way they like it? At a remote lodge in British Columbia, Canada the handsome couple hung up their boots. Aside from the usual wedding fun, salmon hunting and horse back riding were also on the agenda.\n\nThey got married too\n\nJason Biggs and Jenny Mollen\n\nWhen: April 18\n\nNicole Appleton and Liam Gallagher\n\nWhen: February 14\n\nPreeti Jhangiani and Parvin Dabas\n\nWhen: March 23\n\nDitched\n\nRobin Williams and Marsha Garces\n\nSurvival period: 20 years of togetherness\n\nTheir parting shot: \"Irreconcilable differences.\" As in, Williams apparently can't tell the difference between a bottle of vodka and a bottle of water.\n\nWill they or won't they... split: Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon\n\nSurvival period: 5 years of marriage\n\nTheir parting shot: With no acrimony, bad blood or ugly custody battles between the two, this celeb-couple have decided to raise their three-year-old son together while living apart.\n\nCostliest divorce: Madonna and Guy Ritchie\n\nDate of marriage: December 2000\n\nSettlement amount: It was revealed that Madonna was to give Ritchie between £50 and 60 million (Dh267 — 321 million). The figure is inclusive of the value of the couple's country home, Ashcombe.\n\nHeather Mills and Paul McCartney\n\nDate of Marriage: June 2002\n\nSettlement amount: It was revealed that McCartney was to pay activist and former model Mills a whopping $48.6 million (Dh178.6 million).\n\nShortest marriage: Eddie Murphy and Tracey Edmonds\n\nMarriage date: January 1\n\nSurvival period: Two weeks\n\nTheir parting shot: They could not have chose a better one than New Year's day to profess their undying love for one another. At a private sunset ceremony on a private island off Bora Bora, Murphy got hitched in true fairytale style. But two weeks later, they decided to call it quits. By the looks of it, Murphy and Edmonds' New Year's resolution did not exactly read \"Till death do us part\".\n\nPink and Carey Hart\n\nSurvival period: 2 years of marriage\n\nTheir parting shot: Using technology to the best of her advantage, Pink posted this post-split message: \"The most important thing for you all to know is that Carey and I love each other so much. This break-up is not about cheating, anger or fighting. We are best friends, and we will continue to be.\" Then came her album and the hit So What that suggests otherwise.\n\nMarry in haste, repent at leisure: Kate Walsh and Alex Young\n\nSurvival period: 1 year\n\nTheir parting shot: Together for barely a year, this couple is a walking testament to the catastrophic results of quickies.\n\nThey parted ways, too\n\nEmily (Dixie Chick) and Charlie Robison\n\nSurvival period: 10 years of togetherness\n\nStar Jones and Al Reynolds\n\nSurvival period: Three years\n\nShania Twain and Robert Mutt\n\nSurvival period: 14 years of marriage."
