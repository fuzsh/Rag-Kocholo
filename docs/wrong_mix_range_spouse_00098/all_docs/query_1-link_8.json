Before Jason Lee became an actor, he was a professional skateboarder and is still friends with some of his former competitors, like Tony Hawk.\n\n\"Mallrats\" (1995) was about two friends who both got dumped by their girlfriends on the same day. They went to the mall to lick their wounds and ended up deciding to try to win their girlfriends back. Jason Lee played Brodie Bruce, one of the two friends.\n\n2.

Since playing Veronica in \"Clerks\", she has stayed active in the movie business as both an actress and a makeup artist.\n\nJeremy Michael London was born in San Diego, California on November 7, 1972. Jeremy may be familiar to fans of \"Party of Five\" (1994-2000) or \"Seventh Heaven\" (1996-2007). He had recurring roles on both shows.\n\nSadly, Kevin Smith has stated that he will not be doing any more \"Jay and Silent Bob\" movies, as his daughter is old enough to realize her father plays a walking, non-talking cartoon character.\n\n3. Ben Affleck worked opposite Jeremy London in \"Mallrats\" (1995). However, he also worked opposite Jeremy's twin brother, Jason, in another independent film. What film was it?\n\nAnswer: Dazed and Confused\n\n\"Dazed and Confused\" (1993) took place on the last day of school in 1976. It followed several groups of students, both freshmen and seniors, as they dealt with such heady issues as what they wanted to do with their future and how they would handle their present.\n\n\"Dazed and Confused\" was Richard Linklater's third film. His birthdate is July 20, 1960. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Richard used Texas as the backdrop for many of his early films, including \"Dazed and Confused\" (1993).\n\n4. \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001) was a veritable \"Ocean's Eleven\" (2001) in terms of the number of big names who appeared in the movie. Some of those big names had worked together previously on other projects. Which of the following movies had Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott and Shannon Elizabeth collaborated on, before \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\"?\n\nAnswer: American Pie\n\nAll three were in \"American Pie\" (1999) and \"American Pie 2\" (2001).\n\n\"American Pie\" (1999) was about a group of male high school seniors who were trying to lose their virginity. It followed them through several months as they schemed and stumbled their way to what they figured was their best chance at accomplishing their goal: prom.\n\n\"American Pie\" was the directorial debut of Paul and Chris Weitz. They were born in New York City, New York in 1965 and 1969 respectively. They've been working together in the movie business since the late 90s and are both credited writers of the Dreamworks movie \"Antz\" (1998).\n\nThere were two other notable movie stars in \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001) who had previously worked together. Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are both better known for their work in the \"Star Wars\" (1977, 1980 & 1983) movies.\n\n5. There were also several TV stars who had worked together before \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001). On what TV show could you have seen both Marc Blucas and Eliza Dushku?\n\nAnswer: Buffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nEliza Dushku starred in the short-lived \"Tru Calling\" (2003-2005) and guest starred several times on \"Angel\" (1999-2004). On both \"Angel\" (1999-2004)and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1997-2003) she played the rogue slayer named Faith.\n\nMarc Blucas played Riley Finn, Buffy's boyfriend during the fourth and fifth seasons of the show.\n\nAlthough both were recurring characters on the show, their main character arcs were in different seasons. As a result, they only appeared in two episodes together.\n\n\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" was about a teenage girl who discovered that she was this generation's \"chosen one\". She battled demons, vampires and monsters, all while trying to lead a normal life.\n\nEliza Dushku was born Eliza Patricia Dushku on December 30, 1980, in Boston, Massachusetts. Throughout her early career, she was usually cast in the \"bad girl\" role.\n\nMarc Blucas was born Marcus Paul Blucas on January 11, 1972 in Butler, Pennsylvania. Marc attended Wake Forest University on a basketball scholarship and even played professionally for one year in Europe.\n\n6. Which two \"Ocean's Eleven\" (2001) cast members have also made appearances in Kevin Smith's first five \"Jay and Silent Bob\" films (\"Clerks\" (1994) through \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001))?\n\nAnswer: Matt Damon and Casey Affleck\n\nMatt Damon has appeared in \"Chasing Amy\" (1997), \"Dogma\" (1999), \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001) and \"Jersey Girl\" (2004).\n\nCasey Affleck (Ben's brother) appeared in \"Chasing Amy\". Matt Damon and Casey Affleck also shared screentime in \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997).\n\nMatt Damon, born Matthew Paige Damon in Boston, Massachusetts on October 8, 1970, has been friends with Casey's older brother Ben since childhood.\n\nCasey Affleck, born Caleb Casey Affleck on August 12, 1975, in Falmouth, Massachusetts, married Summer Phoenix in 2006. Summer, an actress in her own right, is the sister of the late River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix.\n\n7. Kevin's 2008 film, \"Zack and Miri...\" also featured many stars. The title roles went to Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks. For what other director have Seth and Elizabeth worked together?\n\nAnswer: Judd Apatow\n\nSeth and Elizabeth were both in \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\" (2005). The film, much as the title suggests, was about a 40 year old man, who is also a virgin. His friends, one of them played by Seth Rogen, tried to help him rectify the horrible (in their eyes) situation by helping him meet different women. Elizabeth Banks was one of the women they tried to set him up with.\n\nJudd Apatow, born December 6th, 1967 in Syosset, New York, did not have much success in his first two solo television outings. \"Freaks and Geeks\" (1999-2000) and \"Undeclared\" (2001-2002) were both canceled before their first seasons ended.\n\n8. Justin Long and Brandon Routh also appeared as a couple in \"Zack and Miri...\" (2008). Justin may well be remembered best for being the \"I'm a Mac\" half of the \"Mac/PC\" commercials. Brandon Routh may well be remembered for his biggest role to date. That would be the critically-panned, underperforming reboot/sequel of which franchise?\n\nAnswer: Superman\n\n\"Hulk\" (2003) received a reboot starring Edward Norton.\n\n\"The Terminator\" (1984, 1991, 2003 & 2009) series is still going strong, although the John Connor character has now been played by three different actors, so far.\n\nThe latest \"Rambo\" (2008) movie was a sequel, not a reboot.\n\nBrandon Routh played the title role in Bryan Singer's \"Superman Returns\" (2006). It is considered a sequel and a reboot as the storyline ignores the events that take place in \"Superman III\" (1983) and \"Superman IV\" (1987) and picks up where \"Superman II\" (1980) left off. In it Superman returned to Earth after having left it in \"Superman II\" (1980). He found out that his love, Lois Lane, got married and had a child. He also did battle once again with Lex Luthor who came up with another plan to take over the world.\n\nBrandon was born Brandon James Routh on October 9, 1979 in Des Moines, Iowa. He married actress Courtney Ford in 2007.\n\n9. In 2004's \"Jersey Girl,\" Ben Affleck had two love interests. The first, was Jennifer Lopez, with whom he was involved at the time. The second (after Jennifer Lopez's character died) was Liv Tyler. Interestingly, he had starred with both these actresses in previous films. Can you identify the titles of those movies?\n\nAnswer: \"Gigli\" and \"Armageddon\"\n\n\"Gigli\" (2003) starred Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. In it, Ben played Gigli, and Jennifer played Ricki. They were both involved in the mob. Gigli wanted to be involved with Ricki, and that complicated things because she was a lesbian.\n\n\"Armageddon\" (1998) starred Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler, among others. In it, Ben played A.J. and Liv played Grace. A.J. worked for Grace's father, and was having a relationship with Grace. When her father found out, he did not approve. A.J. managed to prove himself to her father by being willing to sacrifice himself to save the world.\n\nBen Affleck was born Benjamin Geza Affleck-Boldt in Berkeley, California on August 15, 1972. Before he hit superstardom, he shared an apartment with his brother Casey and his friend Matt Damon. He married Jennifer Garner in 2005.\n\nJennifer Lynn Lopez was born July 25, 1969 in The Bronx, New York. She got her start as a \"Fly Girl\" (a background dancer) on the tv show \"In Living Color\" (1990-1994) She's had success as both a dancer, actress, singer and producer. She married her third husband, Marc Antony, in 2004.\n\nLiv Tyler was born July 1, 1977 in New York City, NY. She is the daughter of Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith. She started out as a model, and appeared in the video for the song \"Crazy\" by Aerosmith, before she started acting. She married Royston Langdon in 2003.\n\n10. Looking at only \"The Jersey Trilogy\", which of these actors has played the most characters?\n\nAnswer: Scott Mosier\n\nScott Mosier played a total of five characters in the three movies. He played three characters in \"Clerks\" (1994); Willam (this character was played by Ethan Suplee in \"Mallrats\" (1995)), Angry Hockey-Playing Customer, and Angry Mourner. He played Roddy in \"Mallrats\" and Collector in \"Chasing Amy\" (1997).\n\nBrian O'Halloran played three characters total. In \"Clerks\" he played Dante Hicks, in \"Mallrats\" he played Gil Hicks, and in \"Chasing Amy\" he played Jim Hicks-Executive No. 1.\n\nBen Affleck only played two characters as he did not appear in \"Clerks\". He played Shannon Hamilton in \"Mallrats\" and Holden McNeil in \"Chasing Amy\".\n\nScott Mosier was born March 5, 1971. He met Kevin Smith when they both attended film school in Canada. In the documentary \"An Evening with Kevin Smith,\" Kevin recounted that, at first, they didn't like each other (Scott thought Kevin was a jerk, Kevin thought Scott was a pretty boy). They soon learned they shared the same type of humor and became fast friends. Scott worked as producer on Kevin's first eight films.\n\nWhile Kevin Smith's films haven't been blockbusters by any means, they are relatively cheap to make and fare very well on the DVD market. Smith himself credits that fact as why he's still allowed to make movies.\n\nSource: Author d0gmamg0d\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor skunkee before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
