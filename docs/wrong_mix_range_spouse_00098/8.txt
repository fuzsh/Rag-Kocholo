She is a busy actress with a new film in the works.

But on Saturday, a pregnant Liv Tyler was spotted giving her undivided attention to the number one priority in her life - her family - as she made the most of her free time by enjoying a day out with her youngest son Sailor.

The beaming 38-year-old Leftovers actress had a smile on her face as she pushed her one-year-old tot in his stroller through New York City.

Liv looked radiant and in good spirits as she hit her stride, putting her bump on show in a black short-sleeve top while adding a summery pop with her comfortable floral print trousers.

The Armageddon actress looked fresh face, wearing her dark brunette tresses down in easy and low-maintenance waves which rested by her shoulders.

She protected her gaze behind a pair of sunglasses and had a leather purse slung over her shoulder.

Her little tyke sat comfortably in his stroller, enjoying the fresh air as he kept it comfortable in blue shorts and a lightweight top.

The daughter of rock legend Steven Tyler is expecting her third child imminently, her second with partner Dave Gardner.

They share son Sailor Gene, one and Liv has another child - son Milo William, 11 - with ex-husband Royston Langdon.

Dave is father to son Grey, eight, whom he had with ex-wife Davinia Taylor.

News of their engagement became public in September, nine months after the British-born sports manager secretly proposed.
