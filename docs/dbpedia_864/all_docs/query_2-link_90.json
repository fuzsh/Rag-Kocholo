        "text": "Human Ecology: Week 2\n\nHistorical Origins of Home Economics\n\nSocial forces in the development of home economics: Industrial revolution, trade unions, social reform, role changes for women and application of science to solve problems\n\nLate 19th century  Early home economists stressed the hygiene of food  Early Home Economists advocated for government inspections and pure food legislation (Food & Drug Act) 1880-  The profession of Home Economics was established  Professionalization movement. A growing number of women were seeking entry into professions.  Lake Placid Conferences. Discussed problems facing families and ideas how to solve them.\n\nFounders of Home Economics\n\n1. Ellen Swallow Richards. a. Founder of Home Economics b. First woman to join the faculty of MIT c. Themes: science, furthering women’s education and a belief of home as a source for social change d. Set up Rumford Kitchen and first school lunch program 2. Melvil Dewey. a. One of the first honorary members of AHEA 3. Wilber O. Atwater a. Detailed dietary studies across U. 4. Martha Van Rensselaer a. Founder and Co-Director of college of Home Economics at Cornell University b. Wanted to educate farm women about bacteria c. Wrote the first outreach bulletin 5. Flora Rose a. Scientist and nutritionist b. Created fortified breakfast cereals c. At that time, Human Economists focused more on nutrition issues rather than culinary aspects 6. Adelaide Hoodless a. Her child died (14 months) died from contaminated milk. It could have been prevented. b. Domestic hygiene c. Wrote the first Canadian Home Economics textbook in 1898 d. Founding member of VON, YWCA, Women’s institutes, Teaches’ colleges, National Council of Women of Canada McDonald Institute (U of G) 7. Alice Chown a. Advocated for women’s rights to higher education b. First Canadian to participate in Lake Placid Conferences c. Founded Women’s League of Nations Association\n\nd. Communal living e. Advocated for dress reform and sexual freedom 8. Lillian Massey Treble a. Believed education was key to social reform\n\n20 th Century World War I (1914 – 1918)  Higher food costs, scarce ingredients  ‘’War Menus’’ discouraged use of wheat, bacon and beef  Home economists o Rule of substitution o Meatless Mondays & Wheatless Wednesdays o Encouraged consumption of fruits and vegetables and decrease of food waste o U Bureau of Home Economics wrote many nutrition pamphlets (which formed the basis of the American Dietary Guidelines) 1920s  Kitchenettes became popular  Canned foods and pre-made meals  Sliced bread was invented (1928)  Children’s menus listed calorie counts  Crash diets  Ideal body shape: very slim\n\n1920s and 30s  Heart disease and cancer > TB, influenza  Antibiotics  Municipal water and Sewage Systems  Pasteurized milk  Appliances in domestic cleanliness  Farm women baked bread, raised chickens, grew vegetables, etc\n\n1930  Brescia offers BA in Home Economics (1937) o Women of colour were not welcome into the profession  AHEA narrowed their focus to household o AHEA president told women to not pursue a career  Great Depression o Economy collapsed o Home Economists helped women on how to stretch food budgets  No school o Classrooms became kitchens and children cooks  Teaching opportunities for Human Economics  Food guides warned mothers that one nutritional mistake could lead to night blindness and bowed legs  Human Economists produced booklets to teach about nutritional needs based on the family income\n\n Microwaves recipes  Diets and fat phobia  Home Economics field risk of closing due to declining in enrollments  1980s – 90s. Fat-free products  Name Change In the profession\n\n1990s  Celebrity chefs  Higher interest in food quality, variety, nutrition, and food safety  1994. International year of the Family\n\n21 st Century 2000  Name change again – Food and Nutritional Sciences  Low-carb diets  New food safety threats\n\n2010s  Diversity in recipes  Celebrities promoted false nutritional information\n\n2020  The pandemic highlighted the importance of Home Economics\n\nHuman Ecology: Week 2\n\nImportance of Systemic Thinking\n\nSystemic Thinking is looking at thinks with a wider perspective.  Ecosystem rather than species  Thinking in terms of relationships  Qualitative approach\n\nKey Concepts in General and Family Systems Theories\n\nGeneral Systems Theory\n\n Web of dynamic and complex relationships  Common patterns, behaviours, and properties  Describes but does not predict  Focus: processes o Ex. How systems adapt to inputs and generate outputs  Human systems are self-reflective, self-aware, and self-monitoring o Unlike other systems\n\nFamily Systems Theory\n\n All members are affected (mutual influence)  Problems need a holistic approach  Inputs are transformed into outputs o Food, information, etc. are transformed into behaviours, contributions, etc.\n\n Boundaries within family systems and subsystems  Hierarchy. o Families are part of a neighbourhood suprasystem  Neighbourhoods are part of community suprasystems  Rules reflect repeated patterns, be explicit (known to everyone) or implicit (develop over time)  Whole is greater than the sum of its parts  Adapt to outside interactions  Family within a system achieve different goals through different paths o Ex. University, Marriage, etc.  Feedback Mechanisms strive to maintain a balance o Positive Feedback results in changes in system patterns o Negative Feedback discourages change. Strives for balance (homeostasis)  Adaptability o Positively related to the resources available  Babies grow up o Negatively related to conflict  No communication leads to no outputs\n\nHuman Ecological Model a. Microsystem i. Settings for daily activities ii. Personal interactions iii. Ex. Family, School b. Exosystem i. Affect communities, organizations, and institutions ii. Ex. Programs, quality of education, and availability of resources c. Macrosystem i. Could barely exist in the individual, but still exerts influence ii. Ex. Cultural traditions, social structures, social media, government, economy d. Mesosystem i. Relation between Microsystems and other settings ii. Ex. School administration, church, work, etc. iii. Positive relationships within Mesosystems is beneficial in a child’s development e. Chronosystem i. Multiple environments affect and individual over time ii. Life transitions a. Normative. Puberty, Births, School entry, Deaths, etc. b. Nonnormative. Severe illness, Accidents, Inheritance, etc.\n\nSocial Ecological Model a. Goal: To promote health at an individual, physical, social, and political level over a period of time. i. Ex. Breastfeeding intervention\n\no Complementary, harmonized\n\nEffects of Societal Influences a) Work and role overload b) Workaholism c) Stress d) Work-life imbalance"
