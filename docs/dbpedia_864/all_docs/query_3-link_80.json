The ‘spinster’ teacher was not considered a potential ideal career teacher, in part, because women were not considered long-term workers. Until the mid-1940s, most school districts refused to hire married women teachers and so remaining single was the only option to continue in the profession. These career teachers were forced to deal with the same short shrift faced by young short-term women teachers though they were trying to establish themselves in the profession. Without established pathways and facing discrimination in employment, these never-married women persevered to have long careers and to make contributions to their professional associations. These teachers were in the forefront of women who broke the glass ceiling into what had been male preserves in the profession and in teachers’ associations. RESUME Cet article s’interesse aux activites professionnelles des enseignantes qui ne se sont jam...\n\nThis chapter provides a detailed account of the campaign to ensure that all Scottish girls took sewing as a school subject, followed by pressure to ensure that other domestic economy subjects such as cookery, laundry and hygiene were introduced into the girls’ curriculum. The working-class family was seen as the basic socialising unit, centred around the wife and mother who had received a moral, religious and domestic training, preferably in separate ‘female schools of industry’, where they learnt needlework and where possible, cookery, laundry work and cleaning, under the management of upper and upper-middle class women. Throughout the century there was also considerable opposition to this educational development. This was partly due to a belief that intellectual discipline was the best means of developing an intelligent, moral and cultured individual, but it also resulted from the inertia of custom, opposition of teachers and initial shortage of female teachers, lack of funding and the tradition of mixed elementary schools. The ensuing debate involved members of the nobility, gentry, school inspectors, civil servants, educationalists, the Churches, parents and middle-class women. The conflict between demands for a better intellectual education for girls and demands for a specifically domestic training for them led to ambiguities and inconsistencies on the part of both individuals and institutions. It was a subject women were prepared to speak out about and while conservative women wished to maintain the existing social and gender hierarchy at a time of political unrest, the movement was also supported towards the end of the century by middle-class feminists who wanted to raise the overall status of women’s domestic role. A campaign to introduce sewing into girls’ schooling began in the 1820s and in the 1850s an influential ladies’ society was formed for this purpose. Financial pressure was put on the denominational teacher training colleges by the London-based Privy Council. Two-year supplementary courses for pupils who remained at elementary schools after the age of 12 were introduced in 1903 and these finally achieved a syllabus in which the girls spent most of every afternoon in domestic economy. These various schemes impacted on the academic curriculum of both female pupils and female teachers and the appointment of female teachers was part of the feminisation of the girls’ curriculum, rather than a perception of school mistresses as equal academic and professional colleagues.\n\nIn 2009 a Globe and Mail pundit claimed that the current doctor shortage stems from increasing numbers of women in medicine. This opinion is widely held, despite articulate opposition from medical deans who characterized it as a new variant of the old \" sexist blame game \" (CMAJ 2008). In this ambivalent climate, we interviewed 10 women who entered the Canadian profession between 1945 and 1960, when strict limits on female students were established in most schools. Using semi-structured, in-person and telephone interviews, we found that they worked as much as their male colleagues. Several also raised three to five children; and negotiation of the domestic sphere usually fell to them. Most worked past age 65, and two are still working well into their eighties. Our findings will be set in the context of the existing literature on women in medicine. We will also examine the results of surveys on physicians' working hours, in which all specialties show a decline, including those that have not been feminized. We conclude that the women who entered the profession between 1945 and 1960 did not contribute to the current doctor shortage. Résumé. En 2009, une journaliste au Globe and Mail a suggéré que la pénurie actuelle de médecins au Canada a ses origines dans la féminisation croissante du corps médical. Cet avis est partagé par beaucoup de gens bien qu'il soit contesté par une opposition savante et bien articulée le présentant comme une nouvelle manifestation du sexisme traditionnel. Dans ce contexte d'ambiva-lence, nous avons interrogé dix femmes entrées dans la profession entre 1945 et 1960, période pendant laquelle des limites strictes entravaient l'admission des étudiantes féminines.
