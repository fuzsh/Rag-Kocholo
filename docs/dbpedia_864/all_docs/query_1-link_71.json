Brown. Published by the One Hundredth Anniversary Committee of Moose Jaw School District Number One. First Printing. Saskatchewan Government Printers. 1984. Moose Jaw incorporated as a town - population of 500 or more- in January 19, 1884 and as a city - population of 5,000 or more- November 20, 1903\n\nNOTE: Though the following city schools are technically not one room school houses, they were the pioneers of education in the cities of Saskatchewan.\n\nClasses were held in privately run classes as early as 1883 in the community of Moose Jaw, following the arrival of the rail in 1882. Meetings for the formation of a school began in 1883. Students in the North-West Territories during this era could attend the English Church Academy at Fort Garry, the Prince Albert Roman Catholic Church college or the Methodist schools in Victoria and Fort Edmonton.\n\nMOOSE JAW PROTESTANT PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1 OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES was legally incorporated on December 5, 1884. Classes were held in temporary quarters -church buildings, the Brunswick Hotel lean-to addition, upstairs in the Foley Block, a lean-to additionon the Moose Hotel, the second floor over a tinsmith shop- until a school building could be erected. The PROTESTANT PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1 OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES built a multi-room school, applying for a debenture April 2, 1889. School opened with two classes, the primary grades under Mr. J.N. MacDonald, and the senior pupils under Mr. William Rothwell. The name adopted was the MOOSE JAW UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT NUMBER ONE.1 As a union school, it could provide the standards to train teachers in the absence of \"NORMAL SCHOOL\" or UNIVERSITY, if the school had a principal graduated from a University and qualified therefore to train teachers. By 1901, the school is referred to as Victoria School, and in the spring of 1903, Dr. J.W. Sifton becomes principal of Victoria School taking over from Augustus H. Ball. Additional classroom space was needed, even after expanding VICTORIA SCHOOL to eight rooms, temporary quarters were found in many town buildings until additional schools could be built. The first public school kindergarten was initiated in 1906 at this school. June of 1968 saw the last classes held in VICTORIA SCHOOL.\n\nALEXANDRA SCHOOL began construction in May of 1905, and was ready for classes the following year. ALEXANDRA SCHOOL assumed the duties of a secondary or high school, allowing VICTORIA SCHOOL to teach the primary grades. In 1907, a four room additionwas added to the school. A ten week Normal School short course was provided.\n\nCENTRAL COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE opened in 1910 assuming high school classes and a short course in \"NORMAL SCHOOL\" course work.\n\nPROVINCIAL NORMAL SCHOOL had the ceremonies for the laying of the corner stone on October 2, 1928, and the school opened in 1930.

In 1910 and 1912 both, another two rooms were added, bringing the school up to six classrooms. As well two other classrooms were held in nearby rented buildings. PRINCE ARTHUR SCHOOL was built to replace CRESCENT SCHOOL. PRINCE ARTHUR SCHOOL served as an interim hospital during the flu epidemic of 1918.\n\nEMPIRE SCHOOL was an eight room school completed in 1910.\n\nKING GEORGE SCHOOL opened November11, 1912\n\nSASKATCHEWAN COLLEGE was proposed by 1906 by the Western Canadian Synod of the Presbyterian Church. SASKATCHEWAN COLLEGE opened in September of 1913, and shortly thereafter changed names to MOOSE JAW COLLEGE. MOOSE JAW COLLEGE opened as a residential boy's school, and the plans to make it co-educational did not come to fruition. When the Presbyterian Church of Canada passed to the United Church because of the 1925 church union, the classes soon discontinued as the United Church supported the public school educational system. The school ceased classes in 1926. In 1939, the building was sold to the Roman Catholic Church and re-purposed.\n\nST. AGNES ROMAN CATHOOLIC SEPARATE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 22 was established April 4, 1912, the new building opened for classes September 4, 1913.\n\nSISTERS OF SION private school for girls, and ST. LOUIS COLLEGE for boys offered high school classes in privately run schools.\n\nVANIER COLLEGIATE opened in 1967 to offer secondary classes to the children of Catholic rate payers.\n\nROSS SCHOOL was constructed over the years 1913-1914 and open for classes in June of 1914. Three years later, ROSS SCHOOL was re-purposed as a military hospital during the Great War until 1920. Older students attended either PRINCE ARTHUR or VICTORIA SCHOOLS, the elementary went to HILLCREST ROSS SCHOOL resumed classes in September of 1920, and it was at this time of teacher training at \"NORMAL SCHOOLS\" that ROSS SCHOOL became known as ROSS COLLEGIATE providing higher education. During the second World War, ROSS SCHOOL was taken by the Armed Forces in 1942 to be used as a military barracks. When ROSS SCHOOL resumed operations 1945 it taught elementary classes.\n\nHILLCREST SCHOOL was constructed in 1917 on Chestnut Avenue to take the primary grades when ROSS SCHOOL was converted to a military hospital. HILLCREST continued to operate until 1929, though it had opened as an interim school.\n\nWESTMOUNT SCHOOL classes initially operated out of the Westmount Presbyterian Mission on 12th Avenue Southwest until a new four room building could be built in 1920. The new building was ready to open in 1921, and additions were annexed in 1923, and 1928.\n\nCITY VIEW SCHOOL began in St. George's Mission of the Church of England and various cottage buildings for additional classroom facilities. New facilities were allocated in 1919. The new school was given the name WILLIAM GRAYSON and work began on it in 1925.\n\nA.E. PEACOCK TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\nBRIERCREST BIBLE COLLEGE held meetings in 1905, and the B.B.C. incorporated in 1937 in Briercrest, SK. The Caronport R.C.A.F. base was purchased, and the buildings became the BRIERCREST BIBLE COLLEGE.\n\nINTERNATIONAL BIBLE COLLEGE became established in Consul, SK in 1936. The school moved into Moose Jaw in 1942, and then relocated to Estevan. By 1962-1963, a new home was found in Moose Jaw for the school.\n\nALDERSGATE COLLEGE OF THE FREE METHODIST CHURCH adopted this name in 1959 following a merger of the HOLINESS BIBLE COLLEGE OF WINNIPEG and the MOOSE JAW BIBLE COLLEGE which had opened its doors in 1940.\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH SCHOOL, a six room school, opened in 1954.\n\nJOHN CHISHOLM SCHOOL provided education to those students with special needs and various handicaps which had previously been supported with instruction at ALEXANDREA SCHOOL. JOHN CHISHOLM SCHOOL classes began operating out of three classrooms at ROSS SCHOOL in 1956, until a new school was provided on Eleventh Avenue North west in May of 1966\n\nRIVERVIEW COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE was ready for classes in the fall of 1960.\n\nPALLISER HEIGHTS SCHOOL opened in 1958.\n\nBUSHELL PARK SCHOOL opened in the nearby Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Moose Jaw\n\nLINDALE SCHOOL opened in 1962.\n\nNursing schools were established at General Hospital (later Union Hospital) in 1906, and at Providence Hospital in 1920.\n\nVALLEY VIEW CENTRE originally named the MOOSE JAW TRAINING SCHOOL came to provide training for medical students wishing to serve in the health care field those who are physically or mentally challenged.\n\nC.F.B.
