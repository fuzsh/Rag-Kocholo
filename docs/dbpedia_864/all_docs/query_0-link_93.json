Marie, Ontario, band (Those) Rogues began their career in the early ’60s with regular shows at the Moose Hall in Thessalon, Ontario. They then began playing at The Peppermint Hall filling in for the Fireflies who were taking a trip. They then moved over to the former Knights of Columbus Hall. In 1964, the band recorded a ten song LP with local producer John Holt and a few acetates were given to each of the band members. A copy was sent to CKCY and received some moderate airplay. A disc jockey at CKCY asked the band if his daughter, Debbie Lori Kaye could sing with them. She auditioned and joined the band after which they toured for nearly a year before she left to be on ‘The Tommy Hunter Show’. This encouraged the band and producer Holt to journey to Toronto and record in a proper studio. Davey didn’t want to risk losing his job at Algoma Steel and stayed behind (he would later form another band called The Bishop’s Court Trio). (Those) Rogues went to Arc Studios in Toronto on February 26, 1967 with Marshall Shapiro engineering two songs. “(Wish I Could) See You Again” b/w “Girl” was released on Holt’s Algoma Records and the band achieved some notoriety when they came back home. They would even be the backing band for Bobby Curtola at the Sault Ste. Marie Memorial Garden. After the Rogues, Primeau would join many touring bands and artists back in the Soo including Cal McQuiggan And The Changes, Louis Cormier And The Acadians, The Sound of Evolution (1970), The Flipside (1972), Black Dirt Road and, finally, Seafox. Primeau continued playing part time until about 2003. A copy of the singles sold on Ebay for $2300 in 2007. with notes from Linnea Primeau and Terry Davey.

They learned to play music together as children while listening to their father’s record collection. They emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 2008. They managed to grab the front cover of the University of Winnipeg’s ‘The Uniter’ newspaper in 2018. The band won the Jim Beam National Talent Search in 2019. After being featured on Spotify’s ‘Fresh Finds’ list (2019), and ‘New Music’ list (2020), the 12/21 toured overseas in 2020 before the pandemic prevented them from returning to East Asian countries, and they returned to Canada. They were signed to Black Sheep Records, and Viva Records Philippines in 2021, and were featured on CBC Radio Manitoba which celebrated their label signing that year. In 2023, their song “Misery” was No.1 ‘Song Of The Year’ on Spotify’s ‘Fresh Finds Philippines’ list. The brothers were also nominated for ‘Punk Band Of The Year’ at the Manitoba Loud Music Awards, and also nominated at the Awit Awards for ‘Best Alternative Recording’ in the Philippines. The 12/21 toured Philippines again, where they made an appearance on Manila radio station Wish 107.5FM. The 12/21 have been featured on Spotify’s OPM Rising, New Music Friday, and Fresh Finds Philippines playlists, garnering over 150,000+ streams. They performed at Skills Canada’s opening ceremonies in 2023, and appeared at Canadian Music Week, The 12/21 has opened for some of the Philippines’ touring acts in Canada like Arnel Pineda (Journey), Ely Buendia (Eraserheads), Bamboo (Rivermaya), The Dawn, Yeng Constantino, Orange & Lemons, and Kamikazee.\n\nSingles\n\n2019 Thinking About You [DigiFile] (Black Sheep Manila – PHILIPPINES)\n\n2021 Bakit Mo Iniwan [DigiFile] (Black Sheep Manila – PHILIPPINES)\n\n2021 She’s Electric [DigiFile] (Black Sheep – PHILIPPINES)\n\n2022 Far Away [DigiFile] (Black Sheep – PHILIPPINES)\n\n2022 Break Me [DigiFile] (Black Sheep – PHILIPPINES)\n\n2022 Larawan [DigiFile] (Black Sheep – PHILIPPINES)\n\n2023 Misery [DigiFile] (Black Sheep – PHILIPPINES)\n\n2023 Aking Sinta [DigiFile] (Black Sheep – PHILIPPINES)\n\nAlbums\n\n2019 Hello Yellow [5-song DigiFile EP] (Black Sheep Manila – PHILIPPINES)\n\n13 ENGINES\n\nJohn Critchley (guitar, vocals) / Grant Ethier (drums, vocals) / Jim Hughes (bass, vocals) / Mike Robbins (guitar)\n\nFormed in the mid-80s as The Ikons, the members were York University students trying to get by on rock and roll and beer. The released a self-titled cassette in 1986 before making waves on Detroit radio where they would straddle the border town nightclubs between the Motor City and Windsor with a new name in honour of the motor trade – 13 Engines. While in Detroit they recorded two independent albums for Nocturnal Records – ‘Before Our Time’ (1987) and ‘Byram Lake Blues’ (1989). The latter spawning a college radio hit single in the song “Beached”. They soon came to the attention of SBK Records and their major label debut, ‘Blur To Me Now’, was produced by the late David Briggs (Neil Young, Alice Cooper). The album spawned two medium rotation singles with “Big Surprise” and “King of Saturday Night” allowing them the freedom to tour across the country. However, they would soon lost their US distribution deal with SBK and a disappointing promotional push in light of such label mates as Vanilla Ice making 13 Engines a low priority. EMI Canada kept the band on the high profile list and made a legitimate bubbling under hit of their next album ‘Perpetual Motion Machine’ in 1993 – which landed them a coveted spot on the first annual Tragically Hip ‘Another Roadside Attraction’ tour. The CD launched two heavily played singles/videos in “More” and “Smoke & Ashes”. As the alternative scene became more mainstream it seemed that 13 Engines’ time had come. They released ‘Conquistador’ in 1995 and called it a day; John Critchley runs a very successful recording studio in Toronto called Green Door, and has won a JUNO Award for his production work.\n\nSingles\n\n1989 Beached (Nocturnal)\n\n1991 Big Surprise (SBK/Capitol)\n\n1991 King Of Saturday Night (SBK/Capitol)\n\n1993 More (EMI) CDPRO-710\n\n1993 Ignition (EMI) CDPRO-711\n\n1993 Smoke & Ashes (EMI)\n\n1993 Bred In The Bone (EMI) CDPRO-809\n\n1995 Slow [2-song EP] (Nettwerk/EMI) CDPRO-9606\n\n1995 Beneath My Hand [7″ FlexiDisc] (Evatone/Sunsheets/EMI)\n\n1995 Personal Golem/Waterfall [7”] (EMI) SPRO-1131\n\n1995 Tailpipe Blues (EMI) CDPRO-1160\n\nAlbums\n\n1987 Before Our Time (Nocturnal) NOT-1\n\n1989 Byram Lake Blues (Nocturnal) NOT-2\n\n1991 Blur To Me Now (SBK/Capitol) CDP-96207\n\n1993 Perpetual Motion Machine (EMI) C2-80043\n\n1995 Conquistador (Nettwerk/EMI) 32349\n\n1996 Perfect Largeness – The Nocturnal Years (1987-1990) (Nocturnal) 466810\n\n2017 Brave New Waves Session [LP] (Artoffact) AOF-308\n\nas THE IKONS\n\n1986 The Ikons [cassette] (independent)\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1991 “Kings of Saturday Night” and “Suffocate” on ‘No Flies Here!” (SBK/Capitol) DPRO-5397\n\n1993 “More” on ‘New Stuff Two’ (MMS) NSCD-002\n\n1995 “Tailpipe Blues” on ‘Triple Scoop 3’ (EMI) 438358\n\n2 LINE FILLER\n\n1992-1994 line-up: Matt White (guitar, vocals) / Allan Shaw (guitar) / Kevin Mellors (drums) / Paul Schedlich (bass)\n\n1996 line-up: Matt White (guitar, vocals) / Jon Drew (drums) / Patrick Dupuis (guitar) / Simon Head (bass, vocals)\n\n1997 – 2000 line-up: Matt White (guitar, vocals) / Al Biddle (drums) / Colin Clark (guitar) / Mike Calder (bass) / Nick Pye (bass)\n\nFormed in 1991 in Pickering, Ontario by Matt White.

After the release of two singles and the recording of an aborted LP for a Montreal drug lord (who wanted the band to release a pop record), 222’s high tailed it out of Montreal to Toronto where they weren’t able to sustain themselves and dissolved. Chris Barry headed to England where he would team up with ex-Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock, then onto the Southern Death Cult before Ian Astbury laid claim to the name and Barry found himself broke and without a band. Barry returned to North America and reformed the 222’s in Montreal with former members Pierre Major and Joe Cerratto. Later, with the addition of Andre Gagne and Richard Paul, they became 39 Steps and released several albums as well as playing themselves in the Woody Allen movie ‘Hannah And Her Sisters’. A collection of archived material was released in 2007. The group reformed in 2012 and released a new vinyl LP on Rave-Up Records called ‘She Wants Revenge’. with notes from Mary Lou and Chris Barry.

Shortly afterwards, local guitarist Trevor Veitch, who had joined in on a number of occasions during the pair’s many ‘kitchen jams’, made it a trio. By January 1965, the trio made their debut at Vancouver’s Bunkhouse coffeehouse under the name The Bill Schwartz Quartet. By May 1965 the trio became 3’s A Crowd as suggested by Titcomb’s friend King Anderson. In June they appeared on the cover of the ‘TV Times’. The group then sent a demo tape to Sid Dolgay (ex-The Travellers) who had become a manager for his own company Universal Performing Artists (UPA). Dolgay invited the trio to Toronto to perform in Yorkville and soon became their manager. Through the remainder of 1965 the trio toured with occasional help of bassist Brian Ahern (ex-The Bad Seeds). By January 1966 they had found their way out to the Maritimes and were then joined by bassist Koblun (ex-Neil Young & The Squires). Koblun would leave for Los Angeles after receiving a call from Stephen Stills to join his new group Buffalo Springfield; The gig lasted a week (during which time Comrie Smith would fill in) and Koblun returned in time for a stint at Yorkville’s famed Riverboat Coffeehouse in Toronto. The final night’s performance was taped for CBC -TV’s ‘The Juliette Show’. Following an April 1966 run in Detroit, Michigan, Koblun left the band again from an apparent drug related problem and 3’s A Crowd had to re-hire Comrie Smith. By September the band won a JUNO Award for ‘Best Folk Group of 1966’ and soon received a recording contract from Epic Records in New York to record eight songs. A trip to New York ensued, and with a session drummer in tow, they proceed to record their debut single “Bound To Fly”. By the Fall of 1966 Koblun had regained his capacities as a musician and rejoined the group in time for “Bound To Fly” to become chart bound. In January 1967, the single was released in the UK at the same time Koblun left to re-join Buffalo Springfield. Smith is asked to replace Koblun for a third time. While playing in Ottawa in March of 1967 the band runs into singer/songwriter David Wiffen during his stint with Ottawa folk-act The Children. Both Wiffen and The Children’s drummer, Richard Patterson, climbed aboard 3’s A Crowd. With a new, invigorated line-up, the act toured and appeared on television several times with their second Epic single, “Honey Machine”, which profiles the act as a comedy troupe which caused a furor within the band. 3’s A Crowd soon ended their association with Epic Records. A summer tour took them across Canada and in August they appeared at the Mariposa Folk Festival with the likes of The Kensington Market, Buddy Guy and others. By fall of 1967 Koblun once again rejoined the band (having been kicked out of Buffalo Springfield and several other acts during the interim). 3’s A Crowd appeared at Expo ’67 in Montreal, Québec as representatives of the Ontario Pavillion. As luck would have it, Warner’s boyfriend, who was chaperoning Denny Doherty and Cass Elliott of The Mamas & The Papas, convinced the duo to stop by during the 3’s a Crowd’s performance. Cass Elliott fell in love with the act, telephoned ABC-Dunhill Records president Jay Lasker, and a demo session was quickly arranged in New York. While in New York, the band recorded three songs at Bell Studios with producer Rick Shorter and managed to squeeze in several gigs including one at the legendary Bitter End club. In October, 1967, 3’s A Crowd returned to Montreal to appear at the Canadian Pavilion Feature Stage at Expo ’67. However, Warner’s health had taken a turn for the worse and singer Colleen Peterson, a close friend of the group, substituted for her on this and later occasions. Dunhill signed 3’s A Crowd and, by mid-October, the band was whisked off to Los Angeles with their road manager, David McLeod, as sessions began in Studio 3 at Western Recorders with engineer Chuck Britz and Dunhill staff producer Steve Barri. Recording continued for nearly four weeks and shortly thereafter, the group returned to Toronto to appear on their own national CBC-TV special called ‘Our Kind of Crowd’ with guest spots by comedian Richard Pryor and, then, unknown folk singer Joni Mitchell. With another residency at Toronto’s Riverboat Coffeehouse, Koblun left the band for what would be the last time and was replaced by local bassist Wayne Davis. The preview single for their Dunhill debut LP – a two sided cover tune folk-fest with Murray McLauchlan’s “Coat of Colours” backed by Bruce Cockburn’s “Bird Without Wings” – entered the RPM charts shortly before year’s end. In February 1968 3’s A Crowd’s debut album, ‘Christopher’s Movie Matinee’, was released in Canada on RCA/Victor Records. With “Coat Of Colours” still charting, the group embarked on a tour of Western Canada. As the tour moved on through Vancouver and down the west coast into California, group members Patterson, Titcomb and Warner, along with Jim & Jean narrowly avoided being arrested at Buffalo Springfield’s famous Topanga Canyon drug bust. The next single was a cover of Dino Valenti’s “Get Together” and backed by David Wiffen’s “Drive You Away”. 3’s A Crowd then performed at Massey Hall with members of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. By late April the band had taped another TV show while “Get Together” would finally chart on RPM. Alas, by May, Warner had dropped out of the group permanently due to her continual health problems. With Colleen Peterson unable to join on a permanent basis, Veitch and Titcomb decided to pursue other career interests. With two concerned investors hoping to reap a return on their investment, the band’s manager Sid Dolgay then decided to create a new version of 3’s A Crowd. So, in July 1968 Wiffen and Patterson returned to Ottawa, where they were joined by the now available Peterson and guitarist Sandy Crawley (ex-The Children). The new line-up was made complete with the addition of guitarist/vocalist Bruce Cockburn (ex-Olivus) and bassist Dennis Pendrith. 3’s A Crowd returned to the road as opening act for The Turtles and Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, as well as a one-off engagement supporting The Grand Funk Railroad. During this period, investor Harvey Glatt produced a music video of the group performing Cockburn’s “Electrocution of The Word”, which was shown at the Youth Pavilion of Ottawa’s Central Canadian Exhibition. The band would also appear on investor Sid Banks’ CBC variety show entitled ‘One More Time’, as a means of recouping his investment. In early 1969, and the TV series behind them, Glatt booked the group on a spring tour of US Universities and Colleges. Unfortunately, Crawley had already been offered some acting work and dropped out. The remainder of the band took the gig and toured for two months through the Southern US. 3’s A Crowd’s final performance would be in April 1969 in Columbia, South Carolina; Colleen Peterson would remain there on an extended holiday, while the others returned to Canada to pursue separate projects. She would later move to Nashville and finally back to Canada for a mildly successful solo career before passing away from complications due to cancer in October 1996; Veitch was part of Tom Rush’s band but is best known for writing the English translation of Laura Branigan’s international hit “Gloria”. He would also do soundtrack work including music for children’s TV shows ‘Clifford the Dog’ and ‘The Care Bears’; Cockburn would sign a solo deal with True North Records and has gone on to record over 30 solo albums; Pendrith joined Toronto funk band Simon Caine for one album and then became an integral member of both Cockburn and Murray McLauchlan’s backing bands; Patterson rejoined several ex-Esquires in Ottawa as Canada Goose before freelancing for many Canadian name acts as well as managing the reformed Five Man Electrical Band. He died after a long illness on April 3, 2011; Wiffen moved briefly to Oakland, California to record his second solo album, ‘David Wiffen’, and has continued to this day as a successful solo artist; In August 1997 3’s A Crowd members Cockburn, Crawley, Patterson and Wiffen re-united at the Ottawa Folk Festival for a special reunion concert that included all the members of their previous band The Children.

In 1984, six months after their formation, they recorded and released a self-titled EP on Line Records. With a move to New York City instigated by ex-Montreal patriot and manager Steven Shipp (Bootsauce, Cycle Sluts From Hell), they answered a cattle call in 1985 for a band to appear in Woody Allen’s movie ‘Hannah And Her Sisters’. They sent a tape and photo, auditioned for Allen and ended up performing their song “Slip Into The Crowd” at CBGB’s in the film. After touring the EP and gaining MTV exposure, a full length album called ‘Slip Into The Crowd’ followed in 1987 on RCA Records out of New York. They were soon dropped by RCA and then signed to Chrysalis in 1989, but Chrysalis wanted another Slaughter to add to their roster and 39 Steps took exception to the insult. Despite recording a new record with Blondie’s Chris Stein, no album was released and a protracted two year battle ensued. 39 Steps decided to wait out the length of the contract. In 1991, Joan Jett saw the band and became a fan. The group still had control over the Chris Stein material and headed back into the studio with Jett’s producer John Alosa and engineer Glen Robinson (13 Engines, GWAR, VoiVod) to produce their long awaited follow up entitled ‘Neon Bible’ in 1993. The record was released on Joan Jett and Kenny Laguna’s Blackheart Records. “(All Roads Lead To) Babylon” was released as the single/video which received moderate rotation on MTV, but it seemed that 39 Steps aggro-rock had passed its prime with the onslaught of the grunge movement which effectively buried their final output – 1995’s ‘Nude In the City’ EP; Chris Barry would go on to form Pillbox in New York City before heading back to Montreal for new music project called Acrylic. In 2006 he formed The Throbbing Purple with drummer John Lalley (Bootsauce, Groovy Religion, Rusty) for one album. He also reformed the 222’s in 2012; Cerratto would go on to form Medicine Men. with notes from Mary Lou and Chris Barry.

The band added Smith and Di Cola in 1968. As time progressed they made the transition through every musical trend. They moved to Edmonton in 1973. In the spring of 1980 the band recorded their first single at Homestead Recorders with manager Larry Wanagas (k.d. Lang, Big Sugar, The Trews). The single, “Is There a Reason” b/w “Don’t Let Me Be Alone” was released and received airplay regionally. These were the days of six-nighters back-to-back across the country, with a solid fan base in several major cities. Tacoy Ryde was also becoming a full-fledged reggae band. They were now being booked to open for major reggae acts such as Jamaica’s Third World Band and England’s Steel Pulse. By 1982, the time was ripe to record an album. The band headed to Pinewood Studio in Vancouver with producer Claire Lawrence (Chilliwack, Hometown Band). The album consisted of original reggae material but upon completion, the band was unable to secure a record deal so the album was shelved and to this day remains unreleased. In late 1983, under pressure to change their name and move in a more pop direction Tacoy Ryde became JATO (which the band jokingly claim means ‘Jet-Assisted-Take-Off’) and signed with an upstart label from Vancouver, Parallel One, run by Gordon Sinclair and Scott Andrews. Their debut album was recorded by Bob Rock and produced by Declan O’Doherty at Little Mountain Sound in Vancouver. The singles “She’s Got” reached No. 74 on the national charts and “Lake Of Fire” reached No. 90. The album achieved minimal attention and with the demise of Parallel One Records not long after the band was put on hold in 1988. In 1990, without lead singer Woolsey, the band returned to their original name of Tacoy Ryde. The band forged ahead without a lead singer until meeting up with Al Brant while performing a tribute on Jimi Hendrix’s 50th birthday. Shortly after this, drummer Bill Hobson’s future wife, Dale Ladouceur, joined the band on Chapman Stick. By 1995 the band was a regular fixture on the Edmonton club scene. Tacoy Ryde soon began recording their debut independent CD. ‘Here’s The Picture’ was released in 2003 and songs like “Where’s Doug” and “Ojo Grises” ranked in the top 15 most played songs on CKUA Radio.

He moved to Toronto working to pay the bills in the gig economy, and spent his free time writing music. When the first COVID lockdown occurred in March 2020, he moved back to his parents house in Stittsville, Ontario. It was there that he wrote the song “Run Away To Mars.” He uploaded the song to social media in 2021 and he racked up worldwide streams of 400,000 in about 18 months. With its debut as a backing track to clips on TikTok, “Run Away To Mars” streams broke the 30 million stream barrier. Durocher soon signed a record deal with Capitol Records, and watched as the song charted high in Europe and South Africa, eventually reaching No. 1 on Billboard’s Adult Alternative Airplay chart at the beginning of 2023. The song has now reached over 130 million streams. Subsequent songs have debuted on the ABC-TV series ‘Grey’s Anatomy’, and TALK has written the theme song for the CBS-TV series ‘Tracker.’ Songs have also appeared in the Sony PlayStation video game ‘MLB The Show 2023.’ He has since toured Europe, as well performing at festivals such as Lollapalooza, Festival d’été de Québec, and the Calgary Stampede. TALK has opened shows for Imagine Dragons, as well as Shania Twain. He even did 26 shows in North America with Young The Giant and Milky Chance. In 2024 he toured the US and Canada, and was nominated for several JUNO Awards. with notes from Nick Krewen.\n\nSingles\n\n2021 Run Away To Mars [DigiFile] (Range/Capitol)\n\n2022 How To Save A Life [DigiFile] (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\n2022 Run Away To Mars (Strings Version)/Run Away To Mars (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\n2023 Afraid Of The Dark [DigiFile] (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\n2023 Spotify Singles [2 songs DigiFile] (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\n2023 I’m One OF The Rest (From The CBS Original Series “Tracker”) [DigiFile] (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\n2023 La Ziguezon (Live) (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\nAlbums\n\n2021 Talk To Me [5-song DigiFile EP] (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\n2023 A Little Bit Happy [3-song DigiFile EP] (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\n2023 A Little Bit Happy (Live) [4-song DigiFile EP] (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\n2023 Wasteland [4-song DigiFile EP] (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\n2023 Lord Of The Flies & Birds & Bees [DigiFile] (Doogood/Range/Capitol)\n\nTALL NEW BUILDINGS\n\nJian “Jean” Gomeshi (vocals) / Murray Foster (bass) / Tracy Jones (guitar) / Reno Manfredi (keyboards) / John Ruttle (drums) / Steve Lance [aka Steve Cohen] (drums; replaced Ruttle)\n\nTall New Buildings started as a high-school project in 1983 in Toronto, Ontario. The group soon split up during the first year of University and re-assembled when Ruttle took a year off so they could pursue their craft seriously. The performed on the Queen Street circuit and caught the attention of Main Man Productions who helped them cut a 12″ single for the song “Fashion In Your Eye’. It was released on High Rise Records and produced by Gordon Deppe (Spoons) at Sound Path Studio in Oakville, Ontario. The song received airplay on CFNY-FM and a rough video got attention from MuchMusic. Ruttle soon returned to University to complete his studies and was replaced by Lance. After struggling for another year, they were picked up by manager Jeff Rogers who got them signed to Sommersault Records (Candi & The Backbeat) where they released the 4 song EP ‘Breaking Her Walls’ in 1987. The EP broke through commercially on CFNY-FM and the video on MuchMusic reached No.5. Gomeshi and Foster would go on to form a cappella comedy group Moxy Früvous; Gomeshi would later be caught up in a national scandal in 2014.

Armand suggested adding an additional “L” to the name to make it unique and Les Tallmud was born.After months of rehearsals playing British Invasion standards from the likes of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and the Animals, they performed at their first gig at their high school, École St-Jean de Laval, in December 1965. After making the usually rounds at school dances, youth centres and other venues suitable for musicians their age they attract a manager in Jean-Claude Brosseau from the Association of Montreal Musicians. In 1966 they began getting professional booking through Pierre Gravel of the PG Granby Agency who soon became their new manager. The band released four singles between 1967 and 1968 but never quite hit the big time; Jean-Pierre Armand would form the duo Armand & Letourneau with Pierre Robert Létourneau.\n\nSingles\n\n1967 Avoir Raison/Un Autre Ami (Sonore) S-8007\n\n1967 J’ai cru a mon rêve/On est heureux (RCA Victor International Canada) 57-5737\n\n1968 As-Tu vu ma fille Mr. Jones/Nous sommes des rêveurs (Carrousel) CR-36\n\n1968 Prends ma guitare/À l’école (Carrousel) CR-51\n\nTAMBLYN, Ian\n\nBorn: Ian Gordon Tamblyn on December 2, 1947 in Fort William, Ontario\n\nIan Tamblyn grew up in Fort William, Ontario and then studied at Trent University where he graduated in 1971 before deciding to settle in Chelsea, Québec. Through his school years he played the coffee houses as a folk singer-songwriter. He decided to take his act ‘pro’ and released his first album, ‘Moose Tracks’, in 1972. The album was recorded in only one take at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education in Toronto, Ontario and limited to 200 copies on independent label Barge Records. After signing a deal with Ottawa’s Posterity records he released his self-titled, full-length, debut album in 1976. The record would win a JUNO Award for ‘Best Folk Music Recording’ in 1977. ‘Closer To Home’ followed in 1978 before Tamblyn decided to start his own North Track label imprint. The first album for his own label was ‘When Will I See You Again’ in 1980 which Tamblyn affectionately considers to be his real ‘first album’. ‘Dance Me Outside’ followed in 1983 and was recorded with the short-lived Ian Tamblyn Band featuring Brian Rading on bass, Dave Binder on guitar and Bruce Wittet on drums. In the late fall of 1986, Tamblyn received a commission from the Canadian Museum of Nature to present a concert celebrating their forthcoming bird exposition. Bird enthusiast and recorder, Monty Brigham, provided field recordings of birds while others were purchased through the sound library at Crawley films. The album based on this material, ‘Over My Head’, was recorded in less than a week, and has since sold over 100,000 copies. ‘Ghost Parade’ was released in 1987 and only on cassette as the industry began shifting to the more expensive medium of compact discs. In 1989 Tamblyn released his second album in a planned ‘environmental’ series called ‘Magnetic North’. Work began on it in 1984 when Tamblyn was asked to be an artistic observer on a scientific expedition to the Chukchi Sea – north of the Bering Strait – to study the feeding habits of gray whales and walrus. Tamblyn earned his diving license and worked with the scientists collecting samples. In off hours he collected audio sounds from the north and incorporated them into the album’s songs. The record was nominated for a JUNO Award for ‘Best Instrumental Album’ in 1990. In 1992 ‘Through the Years: ’76 – ’92” was released as a collection of Tamblyn’s first 15 years of commercial recordings and included five new songs. Tamblyn has continued on a steady path of recording instrumental music albums inspired by the environment and his further travel adventures to remote places such as the north shore of Lake Superior and the Nahanni River. In 2008 Tamblyn, along with other folk artists such as Bruce Cockburn released a 2CD tribute CD to Canadian songwriter and poet William Hawkins entitled ‘Dancing Alone’ which Tamblyn produced. He is currently finishing up his fourth album in the ‘Four Coast’ Project which has so far featured ‘Superior: Spirit & Light – Four Coast Project Vol. 1’ (2007), ‘Raincoast – The Four Coast Project Vol.2’ (2008) and ‘Walking the Bones – The Four Coast Project Vol. 3’ (2010) which is Tamblyn’s 34th album; Tamblyn is also a noted playwright. His works include: ‘Dream Children’ (1976), ‘Northern Affairs’ (1984), ‘Somebody Get Me a Job’ (1987), ‘Legends of the Northern Swamp’ (1990), ‘Land of Trash (1991), and ‘Day in the Night of Zephyr Fallutyn’ (1995; Tamblyn was given the prestigious Order of Canada in 2021 “…for his enduring contributions as a folk music icon, adventurer, and cultural ambassador for Canada.” with notes from Ian Tamblyn.\n\nSingles\n\n1976 One of These Days/Guitar Truck Drivin’ Man (Posterity) PT-101\n\n1976 Paris Afternoon/Holiday Parade (Posterity) PT-102\n\n1978 Take Me Home/Love Will Away (Posterity) PT-104\n\nAlbums\n\n1972 Moosetracks (Barge) QCS-933\n\n1976 Ian Tamblyn (Posterity) PTR-13002\n\n1978 Closer to Home (Posterity) PTR-13005\n\n1980 When Will I See You Again (North Track) NT-05\n\n1986 Over My Head (North Track) NTCD-1\n\n1987 Ghost Parade [cassette] (North Track)\n\n1989 Magnetic North (North Track/Holborne) NTCD-2\n\n1990 Magnetic North [re-issue] (True North) TNT-78\n\n1991 Days Of Sun & Wind (Voice & Guitar) [cassette] (North Track)\n\n1992 Through the Years: ’76 – ’92 (North Track) CD NT-14\n\n1994 Antarctica (North Track) NTCD-3\n\n1995 The Middle Distance (North Track) NT-17\n\n1996 Lost Visions, Forgotten Dreams / / Quêtes et Songes Hyperboréens (Canadian Museum Of Civilization)\n\n1997 The Body Needs to Travel (North Track) NT-20\n\n2000 Voice in the Wilderness (North Track) NT-21\n\n2002 When Will I See You Again/Ghost Parade (North Track) NT-22/23\n\n2002 Like the Way You’re Tinkin’ (North Track) NT-24\n\n2003 Closer To Home (Air Mail Archive – JAPAN) AIRAC-1019\n\n2004 Angels Share (Sea Lynx) 6-29048-06952-9\n\n2005 Machine Works (North Track) NT-26\n\n2007 Superior: Spirit and Light – The Four Coast Project: Vol.1 (North Track) NT-27\n\n2008 Antarctic Songbook (Students On Ice) ITCD-2008\n\n2008 Raincoast – The Four Coast Project: Vol. 2 (North Track)\n\n2009 Willisville Mountain (Sea Lynx) 6-25989-63332-4\n\n2009 Gyre (North Track)\n\n2010 In Dreams Behold – Celtic Project [Digi File] (independent)\n\n2011 Walking the Bones – The Four Coast Project: Vol. 3 (North Track) NT-34\n\n2014 Walking In The Footsteps (Sea Lynx) 8-89211-12545-6\n\n2014 The Labrador (The Four Coast Project: Volume 4) (North Track) NT-37\n\n2018 Let It Go (Sea Lynx) 0-61297-59734-5\n\n2021 A Longing For Innocence (Sea Lynx) 0-61297-74663-7\n\nwith THE IAN TAMBLYN BAND\n\n1982 Dance Me Outside (North Track) NT-07\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1979 “Guitar Truck Drivin’ Man” on ‘Collage’ (Bytown) BFFTF-1\n\n2000 “Gather Me Round” on ‘Hillside Festival Volume One 1999’ (Hillside Festival)\n\n2000 “Woodsmoke And Oranges” on ‘Canadian Roots 2000’ (Vogue) VRI-002\n\n2001 “The Quiet Place” on ‘The Ottawa Folklore Centre 25th Anniversary Album’ (independent) OFC006-25\n\n2008 “Tell Me That Story” and “Midnight Gambler” on ‘Dancing Alone – Songs Of William Hawkins [2CD] (True North) TND-519\n\nTAME AND TALKING\n\nJonathan Clark (bass) / Rob Greenway (drums) / Robin Brooks (guitar)\n\nA three-piece post-punk act from Toronto, Ontario that released one EP; Greenway has kept busy in the intervening years as vocalist, drummer, and CD graphic artist.

Swanson was a logger and railway safety inspector for the British Columbia government for many years. With his love of steam trains he invented the train horn that is now in standard use on locomotives all over the world. He was also responsible for Vancouver’s O Canada Horns including those on the British Columbia ferries and at NHL hockey games. He was also a poet and nicknamed ‘Bard of the Woods’ by those who knew him. During the 1930s he began writing down the stories and the balladry of those in the BC logging camps. He wrote four chapbooks of folk verse and ballads in the 1940’s and 1950’s. In 1969 he teamed up with Vic Couture to set a number of these works to music and under the name Tame Apes (which was an old loggers’ expression) they released an album called ‘Songs of the West Coast Logger’ in 1970. By the 1980s he did regular tours reading poetry and singing as part of a performing troupe. Swanson died in 1994 at the age of 89. Currently Swanson’s works carry on as part of a musical revue by the Other Guys Theatre Company under the title “Good Timber: Songs & Stories of the Western Logger”. with notes from the Other Guys Theatre Company.\n\nAlbums\n\n1970 Songs of the West Coast Logger (MCA) 7011\n\nTANAKA, Jimmy\n\nDrummer from Montreal, Québec.

He took a year off to decide what to do with his life, hopped in his car and drove until his trek landed him in Whistler, British Columbia. After doing odd jobs that were less than fulfilling he decided to head back to Québec and finish school. Canadian comparative literature failed to fill the void of his wanderlust and began seriously to contemplate a musical career. At the same time he decided to leave his small town existence in Cowanville, Québec. His musical pursuits led him to Calgary where he’d quickly developed a following from the locals — especially other area musicians. In 1996, Tariq released his first, independent, CD ‘Splat’, which did well on college radio and caught the attention of EMI who signed the songwriter to a deal in 1997. In 1997, he released his major-label debut, ‘The Basement Tapes’, which featured the first single/video for “Chevrolet Way”, which was filmed just outside Toronto by Huevos Rancheros’ videomaker Robert Cuffley. The second video/single was “Not a Just Waiter.”\n\nSingles\n\n1997 Chevrolet Way [3 mixes] (EMI) CDPRO-1511\n\n1997 (Not Just) a Waiter [3 mixes] (EMI) DPRO-1583\n\n2001 Liberal Guy/Liberal Guy (Edit) (Tariq/Page)\n\nAlbums\n\n1995 Splat (Funky Chicken) FUNCH-01\n\n1997 The Basement Songs (EMI) 55282\n\n2001 While You’re Down There (Tariq/FACTOR) THCD-2001\n\n2005 Goodbye Lonely (Tariq/FACTOR) THCD-2005\n\n2015 Moonwalker [5-song EP] (Headless Owl) 003\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1996 “(Not Just) A Waiter” on ‘Impact Music Volume Twelve’ (MMS) IM-012\n\n1997 “Chevrolet Way” on ‘Ear Conditioning’ (EMI) 833136\n\nTARRIS, Donn\n\nFormer member of 1970’s Vancouver, British Columbia act Airborne who released one album, ‘Songs For the City’, in 1977.

By the mid-1960s he found himself in two bands – Milestone and Susan Taylor & The Peytons. By 1968 he had gone solo and was soon signed to Columbia Records. The first single in late 1968 entitled “All That I Love” managed to barely scrape RPM’s Top 100 singles chart with a peak position of No.92. The follow-up, “If You Believe”, never made the Top 100 but managed a decent 6 week run in the summer of 1969 on RPM’s Weekly CanCon chart. The next three singles had no showing on the RPM charts. Tarry was soon without a label. By 1973 he had signed to Reprise Records and soon had a charted hit with the song “Rosalie” which peaked at No.8 on The RPM Top 100 singles chart in the summer of 1973 and managed a modest showing on the Country Chart as well. The follow-up, “Forgotten Man”, managed to reach No.52 on the RPM Top 100 chart. The third single, “Memories”, became Tarry’s second biggest hit peaking at No.13 on the RPM Top50 Pop Playlist Chart in early January 1974. Tarry passed away in his home town of Marmora, Ontario on April 15, 2013. with notes from Paul Weber.\n\nSingles\n\n1968 All That I Love/You’re Young You’ll Forget (Columbia) C4-2848\n\n1968 If You Believe/Such A Long Time (Columbia) C4-2863\n\n1969 Neighbours At the Zoo/A Dime’s Worth (Columbia) C4-2877\n\n1969 What’s Your Name/Earth Ran Away With The Spoon (Columbia) C4-2878\n\n1969 Sometimes You’re Up/Silent People (Columbia) C4-2922\n\n1973 Rosalie/Just a Feeling (Reprise/WEA) CR-4017\n\n1973 Forgotten Man (Reprise/WEA) CR-4020\n\n1974 Memories/Grow Back the Roots (Reprise/WEA) CR-4024\n\nAlbums\n\n1973 Michael Tarry (Reprise/WEA) RSC-8007\n\nTASSI, Madonna\n\nMadonna Tassi is a dance artist from Toronto, Ontario who released several singles in the 1980s through Spin Records.

The band worked to write original songs with the intent of recording, playing many Calgary landmarks along the way: The Long Bar, Ten Foot Henry’s, The National Hotel, and moving on to play bigger venues like Mac Hall Ballroom at the University of Calgary. Tau Ceti was the first Calgary band to headline at The Center for the Performing Arts. Along with vinyl output, they had two videos that received airplay on MuchMusic entitled “Radiation” and “San Francisco” which was added to regular rotation for several weeks. The band had some commercial airplay on CBC Brave New Waves and Calgary FM stations with the song “And I Wonder”. The group split up in 1987. Calnan currently lives in Houston, Texas working as an engineering designer, still playing with an original project, and is an endorsee for Pintech Electronic Drums; Gauthier has her own Internet company based in Montreal and has continued as a visual artist creating with oil and charcoal.

After relocating to Toronto in the fall of 1967 to try and catch a break they auditioned at The Hawk’s Nest for several agents. Terry Philion of Canada General Artists signed them and their first gig was opening for Mandala in Collingwood. They would perform all over Southern Ontario and even played Yorkville at El Patio. They opened shows for the likes of Grant Smith & The Power, Shawne & Jay Jackson And the Majestics, and the Guess Who (at the Canadian National Exhibition) in 1968. The same year they released a single on Boo Records but after it failed to stir interest the band parted ways and Jorma Larton returned to Sudbury to start University. The remaining members became The Tote Family and were signed to Yorkville Records. Following an unsuccessful set of singles they went through a line-up shuffle, changed their name again to SeaDog, and signed with the MUCH label. With notes from Jorma Larton and Doug Varty.

Needless to say they lost any fans they may have had. With a change in personnel, they regrouped as Bobby Taylor And The Vancouvers and were discovered at the Elegant Parlour by Diana Ross during an appearance in the city with The Supremes. She contacted her Motown Records label boss, Barry Gordy Jr., who immediately signed them to his fledgling Gordy imprint. He was so impressed he produced their first album personally. The album featured the American hit single “Does Your Mama Know About Me” which stayed on the Billboard Charts for ten weeks. The album also spawned two lesser selling singles in “Malinda” and “I Am Your Man”. The band split up in 1969 and Tommy Chong would go on to international fame as half of the comedy duo Cheech And Chong. Bobby Taylor, meanwhile, did a brief solo stint and would eventually end up working for Motown to discover a family act from Gary, Indiana called The Jackson 5; Taylor died of Leukemia in a Hong Kong hospital July 22, 2017.

Over the next ten years, Lauren worked hard to develop her craft and build her performing experience. Every Sunday she traveled from her Montreal home to Ottawa to study with a top-notch vocal coach, then spent hours practicing every day after school. To test her fledgling musical wings, Lauren performed at dozens of concerts and community festivals. She competed in prestigious singing contests, including the American Guild of Music vocal talent competition, where she won a record five gold medals in the R&B/Pop category. All the while, Lauren waited anxiously for the right time to bring her lifelong love of singing to the highest level. With her father as management partner, the two planned out her next move following her sixteenth birthday which was to record a pop album. As a team, they began to make important contacts. This lead to a meeting with established songwriter/producer John Farley (Roch Voisine, Melanie Stewart, Nancy Martinez, Martine St-Clair). Recognizing her talent, Farley began to work with Taylor to develop original material to suit her vocal style. With a professionally produced demo in hand, Taylor was signed to Montreal-based Soft Cell Records in September 1999. An album entitled “Let Me In Your Heart” followed on the heels of the first single “I Will.” The album would be re-issued in Japan on Avex Trax renamed ‘Dance With Me’ featuring a remix of the song ‘Without U’ by Zi-Zone.\n\nSingles\n\n2000 I Will (B’T Buzz/Soft Cell/DEP)\n\n2000 She’s Not The One [3 mixes] (B’T Buzz/Soft Cell/DEP) SFT2-4523\n\nAlbum\n\n2000 Let Me In Your Heart (B’T Buzz/Soft Cell/DEP)\n\n2000 Dance With Me (Avex Trax – JAPAN) AVCD-11841\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2000 “Without U” on ‘Abest Tracks ’00 12 (Avex Trax) AVCS-10381\n\nTAYLOR, Lydia\n\nOriginally from Sudbury, Ontario, vocalist Lydia Taylor’s musical career began while singing in various high school bands while growing up in Mississauga, Ontario. During the mid-1960s she was one of the first Go-Go dancers hired at the Brass Rail under the name Toby J. Scott. Her ambition was to be a singer, however, and she worked her way around the Southern Ontario music circuit as a member of the all-girl group The Starlettes. She would eventually leave to front a rock group called Trixter, and finally, a break came in the mid-1970s when she was initially signed to a publishing demo deal with RCA Records. After a lone single, “Love a Little Harder” (along with a French version of the same song), failed to make waves at radio in 1976, she was back to pounding the pavement in search of a record deal. Then, while performing in Toronto in 1978 she was spotted by Cliff Hunt, and signed to Hunt Management as well as Hunt’s label Falcon Records (which also featured Zon). She continued playing live while she and guitarist Richard Zwicewicz began writing songs. With a guest appearance on Helix’s song “You’re a Woman Now,” the duo entered Phase One studio in North Scarborough, Ontario where Zwicewicz and Robert Leth co-produced her self-titled debut for Cliff Hunt’s Falcon Records label in 1979. A touring band was assembled that included Zwicewicz (guitars), Dan Donovan (bass), Andy Artfield (keyboards), and The Stampeders’ Gibby Lacasse (drums), and the ensemble hit the road to promote the album. Taylor was then nominated for a ‘Top Female Vocalist of the Year’ at the JUNO Awards and eventually won. Next, the road tested Lydia Taylor Band returned to Phase One studio in 1980 to record a new album which was produced by Bob Gallo and Don Lorusso. 1981’s ‘Lydia Taylor Band’ album was released on Passport Records and spawned two singles – “Some Guys” and “Miracles”. Taylor would win a JUNO Award for ‘Most Promising Female Vocalist’ in 1983. The band’s sophomore release would be the Phase One recorded ‘Bitch’ EP in 1983 which also spawned two singles before Passport Records went bankrupt. A third cross-Canada tour followed and Taylor found herself opening for heavier female-fronted rock acts like Lee Aaron, Toronto, and The Headpins. But as new wave and synth-rock took over commercial radio Taylor’s brand of hard rock fell out of favour, and she wasn’t able to secure another record deal. Eventually, Lydia Taylor left the music business. with notes from Bill Carter, and Lydia Taylor.\n\nSingles\n\n1976 Love A Little Harder/Love A Little Harder (Instrumental) (RCA) PB-50226\n\n1976 Donne Moi Ton Amour/Donne Moi Ton Amour (Instrumental) (RCA) PB-50227\n\n1979 Do Wah Diddy/I’m A W.O.M.A.N.

Dean\n\nBorn: Richard Dean Taylor on May 11, 1939 in Toronto, Ontario\n\nDied: January 7, 2022 in Los Angeles, California\n\nR. Dean Taylor started his career in his home of Toronto in 1961 playing piano and singing with various groups at all the big Toronto clubs as well as recording several singles for the Audiomaster label that were poor quality and received little if no airplay. In 1962 he recorded the single/demo “At the High School Dance” for Amy-Mala Records which gained him a bit of attention to which Taylor took the advice of a friend and pursued his dreams in Detroit. Motown’s Brian Holland offered him a position as a ghostwriter for the label and later he would finally be recognized for this talent on such songs as “I’ll Turn To Stone” (The Four Tops), “Love Child” and “I’m Livin’ In Shame” (The Supremes), and “All I Need” (The Temptations). While developing his production techniques, Taylor recorded “Gotta See Jane” on his own which hit the Top 20 in England. Motown Records owner Berry Gordy Jr. decided to take a chance with Taylor on his newly established white artist’s label Rare Earth from which they released “Indiana Wants Me” in 1970. The song went to No.1 in Canada and peaked at No.5 on the Billboard Top40 September 19, 1970. Following the release of his debut album, “Gotta See Jane” was re-released and went Top 10 in Canada. R. Dean Taylor continued writing and producing for various artists throughout the ’70’s. He also had a U.K. hit single in 1974 (No.36) with “Window Shopping”. Taylor made a brief, unsuccessful comeback attempt in 1981/82; Taylor caught COVID-19 and spent the last year of his life at home with hospice treatment. He died January 7, 2022. with notes from Brian Salmons.\n\nSingles\n\n1961 At The High School Dance/How Wrong Can You Be?

The Girlfriends were a hit, recording for MGM Records in New York. When a similarly-named group saw them they changed their moniker to The Willows and scored big with “My Kinda Guy”. The Willows then opened several Canadian shows for The Beach Boys. The trio also sang their first national commercial for a popular teen beauty treatment. When ‘the show ‘Music Hop’ (and subsequently The Willows) came to the end of its run, Taylor became a choral singer for the likes of The Laurie Bower Singers and the Sycamore Street Singers. Following an appearance with Hagood Hardy’s Montage in 1969, Taylor was able to release a solo album in 1970 produced by Doug Riley entitled ‘I Don’t Know Where I Stand’. Stephanie Taylor would go on to do back-up vocal session work for a number of other Canadian artists including Larry Mattson, Cliff Edwards, The Johnny Burt Orchestra, and Eric Robertson (who she would marry). She also made regular TV appearances on ‘Keith Hampshire’s Music Machine’, ‘The Bobby Vinton Show’, and hosted ‘Canadian Express’ in 1978. In later years she returned to choral singing with both Hampton Avenue and The Canadian Singers; Stephanie Taylor died in 2009.

Meanwhile, she was also working part time as the singer in her own band Susan Taylor And The Peytons. After a prominent appearance during the Toronto Sound concert at Maple Leaf Gardens with other well known Toronto artists on September 24, 1966, Taylor was signed to Yorkville Records as a solo artist. Her first single was a cover of Tim Hardin’s “Don’t Make Promises,” which would peak at #29 on the CHUM chart during the week of March 27, 1967. A second Hardin song, “Reason To Believe,” would end up as the B-side to her follow-up single “If You Love Me.”\n\nSingles\n\n1967 Don’t Make Promises/Twelfth Of Never (Yorkville) YV-45005\n\n1968 If You Love Me/Reason To Believe (Yorkville) YV-45014\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1967 “Don’t Make Promises” on ‘Yorkville Evolution’ (Yorkville) YVM-33001\n\n1968 “If You Love Me” on ‘CTV’s After Four’ (Yorkville) YVM-33003\n\nTBTBT [aka Too Bad To Be True]\n\nJeremy Robinson (vocals) / Al Cox (vocals) / Ishaka Dodd (vocals) / Frankie Scarcelli (vocals)\n\nShort-lived R & B boy band from Montréal, Québec.\n\nSingles\n\n1993 One Track Mind (ISBA) CDNK-871\n\n1993 Get Down To It [6 song 12”] (Cold Chillin’ – EUR) PRO-A6797\n\nAlbums\n\n1993 Too Bad To Be True (ISBA) ISCD-2049\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1993 “One Track Mind (I-Roc-Ex House Mix)” on ‘Energy Rush’ (Quality) QCD- 2032\n\n1994 “One Track Mind” on ‘Awesome 3’ (PolyTel) 516-680-2\n\n1994 “Get Down To It” on ‘The Hit List’ (MCA) MCASD-11177\n\nTCHIR, Trevor\n\nFrom Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nAlbums\n\n2005 Wooden Castles Fall (Trevor Tchir) TPT-003V\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2010 “Avalon” on ‘Great Northern Revival: Notes From The Edmonton Underground Vol. 2’ (NoteBook)\n\nTCHUKON\n\nWarren “Slim” Williams (keyboards) / Kathleen Dyson-Oliver (vocals, guiar) / Harold Fischer (bass) / Ingrid Stitt (saxophone) / Eric Roberts (drums)\n\nTchukon was a soul act featuring some of Montreal’s best voices (including Kat Dyson of Kat Mandu) formed in 1984.

In July of 1990 Jeff Martin and Stuart Chatwood were coming from yet another failed Toronto band, and called their friend Jeff Burrows (who had just been fired from a band himself) to come and be part of a gig they had coming up back in Windsor. The Stickmen was born from that gig. Deciding from the beginning to do as much as possible for their career, they recorded and released an independent CD which got them a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music Canada, and eventually landed them a recording deal with EMI Music Canada. This was due partly to the fact that the CD stayed on Sam The Record Man’s independent charts for over a year, and partly to a series of showcase gigs for A&R reps from most of the major labels. Continuing with their conviction of doing things for themselves, Martin insisted that he be allowed to produce the first album but the label waffled, so he took the band to Vermont to record and produce four tracks to prove to the label executives he could do it. He came back with six completed tracks, and those combined with six from the independent release resulted in Splendor Solis, released in 1993. The hype about the band before the CD was released was quite vast, and the album did not disappoint; it received rave critical and public acceptance and eventually went platinum (100,000 copies) in Canada. Tea Party toured Canada constantly, headlining and as special guests of such luminaries as British psychedelic folk artist Roy Harper. Complications with the release in the US made manager Michael White rethink his strategy and he opted for exposure in Australia. The band played half a dozen gigs Down Under right after Christmas in 1993, helping to push the album to #33 on the Australian charts and warranting a return visit in April 1994; that trip saw seven of their eight gigs selling out. They used a similar approach in Europe, creating a buzz in select markets and then returning to play key gigs that helped build on the momentum; in this way they gained release in more than 20 countries, performing extensively all over the continent. Touring for the band ceased in 1994, and they returned to the studio to flesh out ideas that had popped up while on the road with producer Ed Stasium (Ramones, Living Colour). The results of absorbing different musical styles from their travels was 1995’s The Edges Of Twilight, which features some 31 different instrument sounds and outside help only in the form of a spoken intro to one track by Roy Harper. While some critics jumped on the band’s sound, comparing them to the Doors and Led Zeppelin, others offered even more rave reviews, and the album became an even bigger hit than the first. 1996 saw the band on the road extensively, all across North America, Australia and Europe, selling out everywhere and once again earning rave reviews for their live performance. At the end of 1996, EMI released a six-song, multi-media enhanced CD that featured four acoustic versions of songs from ‘The Edges of Twilight’, a remixed version of “Sister Awake” from the first album, a new song, and full-length videos for two songs, acoustic performances, interviews, and more. To promote this release, the band did a club tour where they brought computers into the room to allow people to view the multimedia track from the CD. In 1997 the band released its latest album, Transmission, featuring the hit single “Temptation”. The band continued to tour extensively to support the material. After the tour ended, Martin and his Australian wife moved out of their three-century-old gothic home in Montreal and into the anonymous hills of Los Angeles. For its fifth full-length album, ‘TRIPtych’, the band made a conscious decision to lighten up without losing its hard edge. The first single, “The Messenger”, followed by “Heaven Coming Down” managed to get them favourable airplay on Rock radio stations. Two more album followed in the 2000s – ‘The Interzone Mantras’ (2001) and ‘Seven Circles’ (2004) – before Martin announced in a press release in 2005 that Tea Party had split up and he would be pursuing a solo career. This was news to Burrows and Chatwood who were expecting to begin work another Tea Party album; Martin did indeed release solo material over the next five years (relocating his family to the UK); Burrows went on to work with Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee in The Big Dirty Band for the ‘Trailer Park Boys’ movie soundtrack before forming supergroup Crash Karma with members of Our Lady Peace and I Mother Earth; Chatwood did production and session work including music for Ubisoft Industries’ ‘Prince of Persia’ video console game; In April 2011 the trio announced they had patched things up and subsequently reunited for tour dates in 2011. The US right wing political group, meanwhile, had added confusion in the world market by naming themselves The Tea Party. The band briefly entertained the idea of selling off their website domain name but instead added a disclaimer: ‘No politics…Just Rock And Roll’. The band released its reunion album, their first in 10 years, ‘The Ocean At The End’ in September 2014.\n\nSingles\n\n1991 Let Me Show You The Door (independent)\n\n1993 The River (EMI)\n\n1993 Save Me (EMI)\n\n1994 A Certain Slant of Light (EMI)\n\n1994 In This Time (EMI)\n\n1994 Midsummer Day (EMI) CDPRO-790\n\n1995 Fire In the Head (EMI)\n\n1997 Touch (EMI)\n\n1997 Temptation (EMI) 884161\n\n1997 Babylon (EMI) CDPRO-1611\n\n1998 Release (EMI) PRCD-8451\n\n1999 The Messenger (EMI) DPRO-1904\n\n2000 Heaven Coming Down/Psychopomp (Live) (EMI) 887521\n\n2000 Walking Wounded (EMI) DPRO-2044\n\n2001 Soul Breaking (EMI)\n\n2004 Stargazer (EMI – AUSTRALIA) PR-578\n\n2004 The Writing’s On the Wall (EMI)\n\n2009 Temptation (Alternate Mixes) [4 mixes Digi-File] (EMI)\n\n2012 Fire In The Head (Live)/[split w/MOROCCAN KINGS] [7″] (veri.live – AUSTRALIS) VL-11\n\n2014 Water’s On Fire (Inside Out)\n\n2018 Black River (Coalition Music)\n\n2019 Way Way Down (Coalition Music)\n\n2020 Everyday Is Like Sunday (Coalition Music)\n\n2020 Isolation [Digi-File] (Eternal Discs)\n\n2021 Hole In My Heart [Digi-File] (Coalition Music)\n\n2021 Summertime [Digi-File] (Coalition Music)\n\n2021 Sunshower [Digi-File] (Coalition Music)\n\nAlbums\n\n1991 The Tea Party (independent)\n\n1993 Splendor Solis (EMI) 789419\n\n1995 The Edges of Twilight (EMI) 832350\n\n1996 Alhambra [EP] (EMI) 837240\n\n1997 Transmission (EMI) 855308\n\n1999 TRIPtych (EMI) 496545\n\n2000 Tangents: The Tea Party Collection (EMI) 7-2435 27682-2-6\n\n2001 The Interzone Mantras (EMI) 529721\n\n2004 Seven Circles (EMI) 595477\n\n2014 Icon (EMI/Universal) 0253760898\n\n2014 The Ocean At The End (Anthem/Universal)\n\n2017 Tx20 [4-song EP Digi-File] (Anthem)\n\n2019 Black River [EP] (Coalition Music)\n\n2021 Blood Moon Rising (Inside Out/Sony – Europe) IOMLTDCD-604\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1993 “Save Me” on ‘New Stuff Two’ (MMS) NSCD-002\n\n1995 “Inanna” on ‘Triple Scoop 3’ (EMI) 438358\n\n1997 “Temptation (Edit) (Tom Lord-Alge Mix)” on ‘Big Shiny Tunes 2’ (WEA) WTVD-36034\n\n1998 “Temptation (Remix)” on ‘Edgefest 98 Rarities & Collectables’ (EMI) DPRO-1738\n\n1998 “Heaven Coming Down” on ‘Big Shiny Tunes 4’ (EMI) 523067\n\n1999 “Life Line” on ‘Much @ Edgefest 1999’ (MCA)\n\n2001 “Walking Wounded” on ‘Big Shiny Tunes 6’ (Universal) 584097\n\n2001 “Heaven Coming Down” on ‘Oh What a Feeling 2: A Vital Collection of Canadian Music’ (CMC) 0885\n\nTEAR DROPS, Les\n\nClaude Bélisle (vocals) / Tony Coletta (vocals) / Jerry Côté (vocals) / Robert Ménard (vocals).\n\nFormed in 1958, Les Tear Drops quickly found success with the song “Je promets” in 1959.

They soon became The Teddy Boys and released one album entitled ‘On Air’ which spawned the hit single “He Only Goes Out With The Boys” and the less successful “1,2,3,4 (Love Affair).” George Marian left the group and Ostick was replaced by former Hott Roxx bassist Scott Shelson. The band then changed their name to Berlin. Following the release of Berlin’s ‘Young Warrior’ LP in 1982, the band wound up embroiled in a well publicized lawsuit with the American act of the same name.

They would hang around Star Records in Hamilton listening to the newest punk imports and by 1975 decided to put a band together. They named themselves after the title of the Flaming Groovies song. Star Records owner Paul Kobak saw the band’s enthusiasm and potential, and offered to manage them (leaving the store in the hands of musician Bob Bryden). Kobak would shuttle the band around in his car, acted as roadie and helped finance their road trips and early demos. As the band became busier and more popular, co-managers Jack Morrow John Brower helped with finding Teenage Head places to play – mainly in Toronto – and wanting the band to make money, the plan was to get a record out. Demos for “Picture My Face” and “Tearin’ Me Apart” were cut and they soon had a deal with Inter Global Music who shopped the band to CBS Records affiliate Epic. The songs were polished and released on Epic in May 1978. “Top Down” soon followed and the band found themselves the centre of attention at the ‘The Last Pogo’ in 1978 at The Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto, Ontario. Teenage Head had barely taken the stage when the police showed up to break up the over-capacity crowd. The entire event was captured by Colin Brunton and Head were immortalized without having played a note. In 1979, their self-titled debut, which was poorly recorded, distributed and released by Inter Global, failed to stir any attention and the record company soon folded. But the band’s frenetic live shows – including a memorable performance at the Heatwave Festival (a recording of which became 1984’s ‘Endless Party’) – drew capacity crowds everywhere they played, and the moderate radio exposure raised eyebrows at Attic Records. Their follow-up, produced by David Bowie alumnus Stacy Heydon, was ‘Frantic City’ which spawned the double-sided hit single “Somethin’ On My Mind” and “Let’s Shake” (though Attic had them re-record the latter with less offensive lyrics for radio ears). The album became a multi-platinum seller and was a battle cry for beer swilling, cottage hopp"
