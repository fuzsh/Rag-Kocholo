The chapter is also about the wide reach of the Euro-American ideology and practice of home science: how it was exported to other places, including Canada, New Zealand, Japan and territories of what used to be the British Empire. Euro-American-derived values and practices didn’t necessarily agree with the habits of the cultures into which attempts were made to insert them. Nonetheless, the transfer of new knowledge about germs and bacteria and nutritional science to other cultural contexts did benefit population health. The ‘academic kitchens’ that seeded themselves on the university campuses of different countries were participants in a general process of colonisation and hegemony that is certainly not unique to the field of household science.",
