        "text": "This research examines the work of four elementary music educators who strive to challenge the dominant paradigm of music education. I employed the methodology of a multiple case study to consider the discourses, practices and philosophies of these four educators. I observed in each school for an eight-week period for two full days each week, conducting semi-structured interviews at the beginning, middle and end of each observation process. At each school, I followed an observation protocol, in addition to completing three interviews and keeping a journal. In this work, I mobilise a tri-faceted lens that combines the theoretical frameworks of anti-colonialism, anti-racism and anti-racist feminism towards counterhegemonic goals. The teachers' diverse practices include critically engaging with issues of social justice, studying a broad range of musics, introducing multiple musical epistemologies, contextualising musics, considering differential privilege and subverting hegemonic practices. In many ways, these four individuals interrupt the traditional Eurocentric focus on Western classical music to explore different possibilities with their students. I argue that a truly radical music education involves shifting from a liberal to a critical paradigm. Drawing on the work of French philosophers Deleuze and Guattari, Russian literary theorist Bakhtin and music education philosopher Elizabeth Gould, I work to reread the findings of this study radically, and ultimately put forward tenets of a radical music education.\n\nThe field of music education has historically constructed &#39;professional&#39; music educator identity as divorced from historical, political, and moral commitments, categorizing these responsibilities as components of &#39;personal identity. This strategic dissection of identity is in direct opposition to the tenets of Social Justice Education (SJE). In an effort to move toward more inclusive curricula and classroom practice, there has been significant emphasis on multiculturalism over the last fifty years. While the aims of multiculturalism are noble, efforts at highlighting other cultures often become tokenistic in practice and, as such, do not engage with the social and political critique that are central to SJE. Previous research has centered on the merits and practical elements of teaching multicultural perspectives of music, as well as the socialization of pre-service music teachers into the professional field. Recently, however, a few scholars have begun to call for a crit...\n\nMusic education takes place in socio-political systems that institutionalise cultural hegemony and social stratication through perpetuating symbolically violent practices and unconscious assumptions regarding the purpose of music and music education in society. Education systems serve to perpetuate class divisions and structures, excluding the music and aspirations of many people through the imposition of an increasingly neoliberal ideology. This article discusses the pedagogical approaches of Musical Futures and Little Kids Rock, and their orientations to democratising learning in the school music classroom through incorporation of practices and perspectives in making and learning popular music, focussed around learner-led teaching and learning.\n\nIn a time that some have argued is “postracial” following the election and reelection of Barack Obama (see Wise 2010, for discussion), this paper argues that antiracism is a crucial theoretical framework for music education. I explore three areas of music education, in which such a framework can push toward change. The first area speaks directly to positionality and recognition of where students are situated in the matrix of domination (Collins 2000). Secondly, anti-racism encourages multicentricity and readily allows for multiple epistemologies or ways of knowing the world, in a manner quite contrary to a more ensemble-based paradigm. Finally, this critical theoretical orientation enables the pursuit of an equity agenda in the actual practice of teaching. In order to give practical context to these ideas, I draw on research from a multiple case study of four elementary music teachers in a large Canadian city. To varying extents, all four teachers employed an anti-racist orientation in their teaching. I use examples from three teachers in the field to illustrate how teachers used this orientation to implement differential recognition, encourage the use of multiple epistemologies, and pursue conversations about equity.\n\nThe structures of white supremacy are complex and present throughout all of public school education. Many of us believe that music education, by its very nature, reaches everyone and cuts across all cultural understandings (Forshaw 2021; Gellerstein 2021). This myth has been heavily romanticized in the profession and is one major way we miss seeing how white supremacy endures. This narrative stretches back to music education’s nineteenth-century roots in Boston in which school music was designed to civilize children through the teaching of a universal cultural literacy based upon moral character and “the public and social worship of God” (Mason 1844, iii). This assumed universality continues today and is based upon the values of the white, Christian teachers and students for whom it was designed.\n\nAmerican music education systematically discriminates against Blacks and other minorities. Scholars have suggested practices for diversifying pre-service programs and higher education faculty; however, little literature focuses on race, power, and privilege in K-12 classrooms. Less literature exists by minorities reporting effects of Eurocentric music teaching on minority students, even though psychology, sociology, and education researchers have published numerous studies on the phenomenon. The purpose of this article is to offer a new teaching model for music educators in a second grade general music classroom. The curriculum aims to use music as a tool to develop critical learners who engage in dismantling systems of hegemony that permeate the field. Moreover, this curriculum seeks to give voice to the silenced and marginalized experiences of People of Color in the field and to implore others to tell their stories. Paulo Freire's (1970) Pedagogy of the Oppressed is used as a theoretical framework to defend the author's ideals."
