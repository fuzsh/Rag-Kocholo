        "text": "THEME 1 - DEVELOPMENT OF SINGING\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.1 PERCEPTION AND PRODUCTION OF SINGING\n\n** Early Song Singing Infants Discover a Rule-Based System **\n\nStefanie Stadler Elmer (University of Zurich) stefanie.stadler@access.uzh.ch Daniel Muzzulini (Kantonsschule Alpenquai Luzern)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe phenomenon of early song singing allows studying the infants’ emerging productive musicality. Song singing consists in combining linguistic and musical elements. Both types of elements are vocal sounds differing in fundamental frequency, duration, intensity, and timbre. Here, we focus on children growing up with German as their native language. What does early song singing reveal about the young singer’s ability to adopt rule-based behaviour? The singing-before-speaking hypothesis expects musical features to prevail, whereas some music educators expect the linguistic elements to appear first. To address this question, the following steps are taken: We carry out microgenetic analyses of young children’s song singing using acoustical methods. We also analyze traditional German children’s songs in order to derive and formalize rules. Finally, a meta-analysis is carried out to match the theoretical rules with the children’s productions. Results show that musically stimulated children at the beginning of their second year are able to produce pitch patterns in structured time, to create songs that match well with culture-specific musico-linguistic rules. Melodic contour, phrase segmentation, metric and rhythmic patterns, their repetition and variation, as well as onomatopoeic syllable formation are major elements children use to create a stream of ordered sounds. Linguistic features such as word formation, however, are less prominent or even absent. Typical for emotional states of playfulness and wellbeing, musically stimulated young children’s vocalizations show more differentiations with respect to musical features than to linguistic ones. These children discover very early how to control pitch and intensity, which prepares them for pre-musical and singing-like vocalizations. Less musically stimulated children tend to focus primarily linguistic features. Altogether, results suggest that song timing rules provide a temporal framework for regular motor movements and for filling in linguistic elements that still may lack semantic meaning.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.1 PERCEPTION AND PRODUCTION OF SINGING\n\n** The Development of Singing Perception and its Relationship to Cognitive Development in Three Cohorts of Children Aged 5 to 9 Years **\n\nAmy Fancourt (Goldsmiths, University of London) a.fancourt@gold.ac.uk Christine D. Tsang (Huron University College at Western) ctsang33@huron.uwo.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nIntroduction: Berkowska and Dalla Bella (2009) have proposed a vocal-sensorimotor loop model of singing in which auditory pitch information is mapped onto vocal-motor movements during singing. This vocal sensorimotor loop model suggests that memory, motor skill, perception and feedback all contribute to singing ability. Many components of the vocal sensorimotor loop begin to develop during infancy, but take a long time to reach maturity (Tsang, Friendly & Trainor, 2011). When considering the development of the sensorimotor loop model of singing, it is important to consider how the ongoing maturation of cognitive abilities may interact with different components of the model. This pilot study focused on the role of perception in the development of singing and investigated the interplay between perception, language and cognitive ability in 3 groups of 5-9 year old children across 3 testing sites in the UK and Canada.\n\nMethod: Perception was measured using the ‘Vocal Auditory Motor Development Assessment’ (VAMDA). Perception was measured in two ways: 1. Ability to discriminate between two short melodies (synthesized ‘ba’ female voice). 2. Ability to detect a small pitch interval change (from 200 cents to 5 cents). The Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) was used to assess short term/working memory and The British Picture Vocabulary Scales (BPVS) were used to assess receptive vocabulary.\n\nResults: In all groups, there was a significant correlation between raw score on the digit span task and performance on the melody discrimination task, r (22) = .449, p<.05 (UK sample), r (24) =.510, p<.05 (Canadian sample). There was a significant correlation between raw vocabulary scores and performance on the pitch interval discrimination task, r (22) = .530, p<.05 (UK), r (24) =. 318, p<0.05 (Canada).\n\nDiscussion: The findings support the predictions of the sensorimotor loop model (Berkowska & Dala Bella, 2009) and show that cognitive and language ability interact with the capacity to perceive and discriminate changes in pitch and melody. The next step is to investigate how cognitive, language and musical perceptual ability may relate to pitch accuracy in singing production.\n\nSUB-THEMES: 1.1- PERCEPTION AND PRODUCTION OF SINGING (Relates to 1.2-MULTIMODAL (AUDIO/VISUAL/MOTOR) ASPECTS SINGING & 1.3-AIRS TEST BATTERY OF SINGING SKILLS)\n\n** Does an Icelandic Woman Know When a Japanese Toddler Sings? **\n\nMayumi Adachi (Hokkaido University) m.adachi@let.hokudai.ac.jp Helga Rut Gudmundsdóttir (University of Iceland) helgarutg@gmail.com\n\nAbstract:\n\nAdachi and Ando (2010) demonstrate that Japanese mothers can interpret a Japanese toddler’s linguistically ambiguous vocalizations as either talking or singing, depending on the context sampled. Similar interpretations have been confirmed with Japanese fathers (Adachi & Ding, 2011), Japanese college students (Adachi, 2010, 2011), Chinese college students (Ding & Adachi, 2011), and German mothers (Adachi & Falk, 2012). In the present study, we further explore this phenomenon with young Icelandic women, mothers and non-mothers. Twenty-one Icelandic women listened to the same 50 vocalizations used in the earlier studies and evaluated whether each vocalization sounded as talking or singing. Overall results indicated that Icelandic women interpreted the Japanese toddler’s vocalizations taken from infant-directed speech contexts more as though it were talking than as singing and those taken from infant-directed song contexts more as singing than as talking. We will report the vocal cues used by Icelandic women to differentiate two types of vocalizations in our presentation.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.2 MULTIMODAL (AUDIO/VISUAL/MOTOR) ASPECTS SINGING\n\n** The Effect of Restricted Facial Mimicry on the Perception of Emotional Song **\n\nLisa P. Chan (Department of Psychology, Ryerson University) lisa.chan@psych.ryerson.ca Frank Russo (Department of Psychology, Ryerson University) russo@psych.ryerson.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nDuring vocal communication, faces continuously move and express linguistic, musical, and affective information (Munhall et al., 2004; Thompson, Russo & Livingstone, 2010). Subtle mirroring of visual aspects of singing performance has been shown through use of facial electromyography of observers (Livingstone, Thompson & Russo, 2009; Chan, 2010). According to the facial feedback hypothesis, producing a facial expression of emotion leads to the experience of that emotion. Thus, by unconsciously mimicking facial expressions, observers may have rapid access to the performer’s intentionality. However, it is not known whether mimicry is necessary to understand emotion in song. To better understand the role of facial mimicry in emotional understanding, we examined aspects of facial animation of the observer and the effect of constraining facial movements on emotional and non-emotional judgments. It was hypothesized that the lack of facial mimicry would only hinder emotion-based judgments. Participants were given two judgment tasks (emotional, non-emotional) while their facial movements were either restricted by a clay-based mask (Mask condition) or not (No Mask condition). In the emotional judgment task, participants were asked to identify the emotional intent (happiness, neutral, sadness) and intensity of a singer. In the non-emotional judgment task, participants were asked to identify non-isochronous rhythms. Both groups did not differ in their performance of emotion identification. Interestingly, though, there was an effect of condition on average emotional intensity scores; participants in the Mask condition rated the emotions as significantly less intense than those in the No Mask condition. It was also found that both groups did not differ in their performance of rhythmic judgment. These results suggest that while facial mimicry may not be necessary to identify simple emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness), lacking the ability to mimic may dampen the intensity of perceived emotions, which may have effects on an observer's experience of musical performances.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.2-MULTIMODAL (AUDIO/VISUAL/MOTOR) ASPECTS SINGING (Relates to 1.3-AIRS TEST BATTERY OF SINGING SKILLS & 3.3-HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING)\n\n** Introducing RAVDESS: A New Database of Emotional Song and Speech **\n\nSteven Livingstone (Ryerson University)Katlyn Peck (Ryerson University) Frank Russo (Ryerson University) russo@psych.ryerson.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis paper introduces the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song. Our purpose in creating this battery was to provide researchers with a high-quality, freely-available set of audio-visual recordings of emotional speech and song in North American English. The battery consists of 12 highly trained actors, speaking and singing short statements with 9 different emotions, each with two emotional intensities. We report on psychometric evaluations, facial motion, and acoustic properties. The battery will allow researchers to assess the relative contributions of audio and visual channels, and to draw comparisons between response to emotional speech and song. With a Ph. D. in Computer Science and Bachelors in Physics and Information Technology, Steven Livingston brings an interdisciplinary skill set to singing research. Since completing his Ph. D. in 2008, he has undertaken a program of research dedicated to understanding the role of facial expressions in singing performance. In 2009, he provided the first time-course analysis of facial expressions in emotional singing. The study, which was done in collaboration with Bill Thompson and Frank Russo, revealed that performers’ facial expressions differentiated their emotional intentions. This research was continued under the supervision of Caroline Palmer and Marcelo Wanderley at McGill University, where he acquired extensive analytical techniques for the study of motion and auditory data. Steven has been an AIRS postdoctoral fellow since 2011, working with Frank Russo at Ryerson University on the development of facial mimicry in emotional singing.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.2 MULTIMODAL (AUDIO/VISUAL/MOTOR) ASPECTS SINGING\n\n** Is This Novel or Familiar? Infants' Looking Responses to Infant-Directed Speaking and Singing **\n\nSara Murphy (St. Francis Xavier University) x2009huv@stfx.ca Charlene Parker (Dalhousie University) Petra Hauf (St. Francis Xavier University) phauf@stfx.ca\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nIntroduction: By 6 months of age, infants become increasingly interested in their environment (Legerstee et al., 1987). Thus, it is important to understand how social partners should interact with infants so that infants can benefit from attending to these interests. Recent research on infant-mother dyads suggests that infant-directed singing promotes engagement and attention, while infant-directed speaking facilitates heightened arousal and infant learning (Nakata & Trehub, 2004).\n\nMethod: To further investigate infants’; responsiveness to these two vocal styles, the present study investigated 24 6-month old infants’ responses to infant-directed singing and speaking from a non-maternal source. Infants watched audiovisual stimuli presenting an adult engaging in infant-directed-singing and speaking of both familiar and novel lyrics. During the presentation, infants’ looking behaviour was recorded with respect to overall looking time, and looking time to the mouth and the eye regions.\n\nResults: Overall, looking time was significantly longer for episodes of infant-directed singing than for infant-directed speaking of familiar and novel lyrics, suggesting increased engagement in singing episodes. Analyzes of the proportional looking time for the mouth and the eye regions revealed that infants prefer attending to the mouth rather than the eyes when shown singing and speaking episodes of a familiar song. When the novel lyric was spoken, infants preferred attending to the mouth, however when the novel lyric was sung, infants attended to the mouth and the eyes equally long. This may indicate that infants are interested in emotional information when shown a novel song. Data from 12-month old infants is currently being collected to investigate developmental changes in relation to language onset.\n\nDiscussion: Findings could have implications for infant learning and adult-infant interaction, suggesting that infant-directed singing may promote emotional engagement, while infant-directed speaking may facilitate information processing.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.2 MULTIMODAL (AUDIO/VISUAL/MOTOR) ASPECTS SINGING\n\n** Regulating Infants' Emotions through Maternal Singing and Speech **\n\nNiusha Ghazban (Ryerson University) nghazban@psych.ryerson.ca Frank Russo (Ryerson University) russo@psych.ryerson.ca Sandra Trehub (University of Toronto) sandra.trehub@utoronto.ca Natalie Ein (Ryerson University) nein@psych.ryerson.ca Sabrina Aimola (Ryerson University) saimola@psych.ryerson.ca Jean Paul Boudreau (Ryerson University) dean@arts.ryerson.ca\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nBackground:The interaction between a mother and her infant has been described as an intricate ‘dance’ involving coordinated singing and movement. It is widely accepted that infant-directed (ID) speech, or motherese, is an effective means of communicating with infants and holding their attention. Infants similarly show a preference and respond to ID singing (Trainor, 1996). ID singing is a universally observed caregiving behaviour used by mothers to change and accommodate their infants’ emotional state (de l’Etoile, 2006; Trehub & Nakata, 2003). While both ID speech and singing appear to be equally successful in modulating infants’ attention and arousal (Nakata & Trehub, 2004), the consequences of maternal speech and singing to regulate stress are less clear. The current study examined infants’ behavioural and physiological responses to their mothers’ singing and speech following an acute stressor induced by mother’s still-neutral face.\n\nMethod: Forty-two, 10-month-old infants participated in this study. Using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure (Tronick et al., 1978), the mothers and infants engaged in a three stage interaction: 1) Face-to Face playtime; 2) Mother’s display of neutral still-face; and 3) the Reunion phase. The Reunion phase was controlled such that mothers re-engaged with their infants by either singing or speaking. Infants were subjected to three repetitions each of singing and speech for a total of six trials over a 30-minute session. Behavioural responses such as visual fixation, motoric activity and emotional valence were coded. Skin conductance levels were monitored via a sensor attached to the infants’ right foot.\n\nResults: Behavioural analyses revealed greater visual fixation on the mother during maternal singing (M = 11.50sec) than in maternal speech (M = 5.77sec), F (1,18) = 18.59, p<.001. During visual fixations on the mother, infants demonstrated significantly more “frozen” motoric activity during maternal singing (M = 7.02sec) than during maternal speech (M = 1.72sec), F (1,18) = 17.55, p<.01. Although the induction of stress as measured by skin conductance was comparable in singing and speaking conditions, F (1,8) = 1.08, p>.05, skin conductance level during the Reunion phase was lower during maternal singing (M=.160μΩ) than during maternal speech (M= .926μΩ])., F(4,60) = 2.87, p<.05.\n\nConclusion: This is the first study to directly examine the effects of maternal vocalizations in regulating infants’ stress, and our findings indicate that maternal singing provides a form of “homeostasis” in regulating infants’ stress more effectively than speech. The pronounced reduction in motoric activity while visually fixated on the mother during the singing condition is reflective of infants’ sustained attention as well as the relaxing outcomes of maternal singing, an observation consistent with Nakata & Trehub (2004). Ultimately these findings demonstrate the astounding effects of maternal singing and shed new light into the perplexing issues with socio-emotional development.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.2 MULTIMODAL (AUDIO/VISUAL/MOTOR) ASPECTS SINGING (Relates to 3.3-HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING)\n\n** A Novel Singing Therapy to Improve Communication of Facial and Vocal Emotion **\n\nFrank Russo (Ryerson University) russo@psych.ryerson.ca Steven Livingstone (Ryerson University)\n\nAbstract:\n\nHumans communicate by eye and by ear - via facial expressions, body postures and tone of voice. In Parkinson’s disease (PD) however this capacity is often blunted; patients exhibit deficits in the ability to produce and to respond to emotional facial expressions, emotional tone of voice and expressive movements. These deficits have been labeled the “masked face” syndrome of Parkinsonism, and have deleterious effects on patients’ ability to engage in interpersonal communication. In this talk, we describe a forthcoming pilot study that uses facial and vocal mimicry to retrain deficits in facial motor function and vocal expressiveness. By retraining expressive functionality, we aim to improve the smoothness of social interactions, quality of life and emotional wellbeing of PD patients. At a behavioral level, when neurotypical individuals are exposed to emotional facial expressions, even unconsciously, they spontaneously react with brief distinct facial movements. These spontaneous movements are regarded as a form of automatic mimicry, and have been shown to improve observers’ accuracy of emotional identification, to decrease emotional response time and to increase feelings of emotional empathy. In our lab, we have successfully used an emotional singing paradigm to reliably elicit spontaneous mimicry in neurotypical observers. The pilot study, funded by Parkinson’s Canada, represents a unique bridging across Themes 1.2 and 3.3. An imitative facial mimicry task will form the basis of the 13-week singing therapy. Twenty-four PD patients will be recruited and assigned to an experimental or control condition. In the experimental condition, patients’ facial motion and vocal output will be recorded while actively imitating audio-visual recordings of emotional singing. In the control condition, patients will be asked to observe the same recordings without any associated production task. Motion capture and acoustic analyses will be used to assess changes in facial motor expressive range and vocal capability. Pre- and post-assessments of facial and vocal recognition of emotion will be assessed using a standardized assessment battery for non-verbal emotion recognition that has been developed as part of research in Theme 1.2.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.3 AIRS TEST BATTERY OF SINGING SKILLS\n\n** Application of the AIRS Test Battery with Icelandic Preschool Children **\n\nHelga Rut Gudmundsdóttir (University of Iceland) helgarutg@gmail.com Bryndis Baldvinsdottir (University of Iceland)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe AIRS test battery of singing was administered to 5- and 6-year-old children (N = 42) in three Icelandic preschools. In this presentation the challenges and successes of administering the test to children of this age will be presented. Issues concerning the adaptation of the test to young Icelandic speaking children will be discussed. In this presentation the children’s performances will be reported on test item 6 which included singing back musical patterns. In order to ensure the consistency of the stimulus the musical patterns were pre-recorded using a child singer with a stable pitch production. The performances were analyzed using a descriptive method of classifying singing performances into categories: 1) Very secure singing, 2) Fairly good singing and 3) Imprecise singing. The criteria for the three categories used will be explained in detail and actual examples from recordings provided. Half of the children tested were in a preschool with a special music teacher (n = 22) and the other half without a music teacher (n = 22). Comparisons between the two groups on test item 6 indicated that there were equal numbers of insecure singers in both groups. However, there were more very secure singers in the group with a music teacher than in the group without a music teacher.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.3 AIRS TEST BATTERY OF SINGING SKILLS\n\n** Pre-school Children's Skills with the AIRS Test Battery **\n\nMike Forrester (University of Kent) Emma Borthwick-Hunter (University of Kent)\n\nAbstract:\n\nIntroduction: This study looks in detail at the early singing skills of pre-school children using the AIRS test battery. Given the possible constraints of the AIRS singing tasks, we examined various factors that may influence very young children’s confidence when singing. These included the setting of the testing, the presence of parents, using toys and puppets, and procedures for encouraging participation.\n\nMethod: 30 children aged 3-4 years were video and audio-recorded using the AIRS battery either in a school setting or in a child-development lab by four different testers. To examine the factors described above, alterations were made during the lab recordings with respect to the procedure and context of testing. Following recordings, audio and video analyses were conducted so as to establish the manner in which the setting, context and procedures influenced children’s singing.\n\nResults: Preliminary analysis indicates that (a) the presence of parents with 3 year-old children may hinder children’s performance; (b) participation by children is enhanced where the tester is more interactive; (c) the use of puppets can aid engagement; and (d) producing an informal setting further encourages children’s participation.\n\nDiscussion: The results highlight the importance of flexibility when testing very young children using the AIRS battery. A number of factors appear to impede or encourage children’s confidence when singing with these tasks. Establishing precisely children’s very early singing skills depends in part in providing a supportive environment for the display of their competencies. The nature of pre-school children’s individual differences calls for considerable flexibility on the part of testers. Future analysis of this data set will establish the details of their singing skills across the informal and formal settings realized in this work.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.3 AIRS TEST BATTERY OF SINGING SKILLS\n\n** Automated AIRS Test Battery: A New Methodology and Preliminary Data **\n\nBing-Yi Pan (University of Prince Edward Island) bpan@upei.ca Annabel J. Cohen (University of Prince Edward Island) airscohen@upei.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nTo standardize the delivery of the AIRS Test Battery of Singing Skills, an automated online system has been developed. It delivers the singing tasks of AIRS Test Battery through a browser with an interactive audiovisual interface, and records the participants’ audiovideo response for each task. An authority module is associated with collected data to control user’s right of retrieval, considering both confidentiality and collaborative sharing. Nearly 100 people across a wide age range (4 to 87 years) have been tested in PEI, and a protocol has been created for analysis of these preliminary data. The entire test will be translated to numerous languages and dialects (some of the translations and transplants are already underway – French, German, Cantonese, Mandarin) and so as to conduct testing worldwide over the Internet. The primary goal of AIRS is to determine the cultural, universal, and individual factors that influence the development of singing. The new automated AIRS Test Battery makes an important stride in this direction. In addition, the system can potentially support other experiments requiring on-line audio or audiovisual recording.\n\nSUB-THEME: 1.3 AIRS TEST BATTERY OF SINGING SKILLS\n\n** Musical and Non-Musical Content in Children's Favourite Tunes **\n\nBeatriz Ilari (University of Southern California) ilari@usc.edu Vivian Agnolo Barbosa (Federal University of Parana and Alecrim Dourado Formacao Musical, Brazil) Tiago Madalozzo (Federal University of Parana and Alecrim Dourado Formacao Musical, Brazil)\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nThe purpose of this exploratory study was to examine musical and non-musical contents in children’s favorite song renditions (AIRS Test Battery Component 6). Renditions of favorite songs sung by 23 middle-class Brazilian children aged 5-9, who completed the AIRS test battery, were assessed. Children’s songs were analyzed in two ways. First, they were examined in light of their musical contents (i.e., singing ranges, melodic accuracy, rhythmic accuracy, and use of expressive features) using 5-point Likert type scales. Second, song lyrics were categorized according to emergent themes. Two independent judges checked 50% of both musical and content analyses. Results suggest that most renditions could be placed between Welch’s (2005) phases 2 and 3 of singing development, with musically trained and older children scoring higher than their peers. In regards to contents, children’s song selections were quite similar to those found in previous studies (e.g., Campbell, 2010; Young, in press). These ranged enormously from traditional children’s songs to pop music, in both Portuguese and English. Interestingly, lyrics were based on typical children’s themes (i.e., animals, routines, acceptable manners), TV and film characters (i.e., Shrek), and ‘adult’ themes like love, sex and sorrow. This last theme was present particularly in songs sung by older children (mainly girls), with younger children singing more traditional children’s songs. Taken together, these results suggest both global and local aspects in children’s sung performances. While there might be similarities in children’s voices and song choices across cultures, local aspects pervade the repertoire that children choose to sing. These repertoires reveal multiple conceptions of children, childhood, and musical childhoods (Young, in press). Implications for music education are discussed.\n\nTHEME 2 - SINGING AND EDUCATION\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.1- LEARNING TO SING NATURALLY (Relates to 2.3- TEACHING THROUGH SINGING)\n\n** Children's Informal Musicking **\n\nJune Countryman (University of Prince Edward Island) jcountryman@upei.ca Martha Gabriel (University of Prince Edward Island) mgabriel@upei.ca Kate Thompson (University of Prince Edward Island) katethompson55@gmail.com Melissa MacRae (University of Prince Edward Island) mmacrae@upei.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis session focuses on children’s informal musicking. We will share findings from two in-progress research projects, one observing spontaneous musical behaviours of children in three day care centres (ages 2-4), and the other observing instances of spontaneous musicking on school playgrounds (ages 5-12). In both studies the researchers are documenting fragmentary vocal and rhythmic play as well as more sustained instances of musicking. We will use audio and video excerpts to illustrate various categories of this music-making. Several lines of theoretical inquiry hold analytic promise: 1) multimodal learning/ multiliteracies: we are interested in the idea that musicking is a literacy - a notion that the New Literacy Studies literature does not take up - and we want to chase the educational implications of that idea, aided by cognitive sciences research that confirms the importance of musical (particularly rhythmic) skills in language/literacy attainment; 2) play theories that consider the relationships between play and art (G. Bateson’s notion of ‘aesthetic engagement’) and play and sociocultural learning (Vygotsky ) and 3) notions of children’s identity construction.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.1 LEARNING TO SING NATURALLY\n\n** \"People of the Cloud\" in the Evergreen State **\n\nMaren Haynes (University of Washington)\n\nAbstract:\n\nFor the 2011-2012 academic year, I received a fellowship from AIRS to explore sung music performed by Mixtec people indigenous to Oaxaca, Mexico, who have immigrated to the Skagit Valley of Washington State, the majority as undocumented migrant laborers. My paper offers perspectives on Mixtec musical culture through the lens of this year-long field project and incorporates interdisciplinary theoretical approaches from Mixtec history (Ortiz, Stephens), linguistics (Flannery), anthropology (Nicholas), and children’s musical cultures (Campbell, Lum and Marsh). The resultant project offers comprehensive information detailing both musical and extramusical issues impacting the underserved and underrepresented Mixtec-speaking population in Washington State. My research highlights the fluidity with which Mixtec children navigate their binational musical and cultural identities. Through the lens of children’s music, I focused on music production and performance, use of technologies, and multigenerational informal music education in church and home settings. Attention to the church community provides a thorough overview of musical and sacred culture for Mixtecs in the Skagit Valley, illuminating community-based approaches to music acquisition and transmission. Through the lens of interdisciplinary research in singing, my paper attends to the identity and autonomy of the vibrant community historically, religiously and musically while simultaneously revealing unmet needs unique to multigenerational Mixtecs in northwestern Washington which hinder the community’s ability to prosper.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.1 LEARNING TO SING NATURALLY\n\n** How Singing is Learned by Brazilian Girls ages 5-11 **\n\nDaniella Gramani (Federal University of Paraiba) daniellagramani@gmail.com Caroline Pacheco (Federal University of Paraiba) carolbrendel@gmail.com\n\nAbstract:\n\nDifferent manifestations of popular culture grant many possibilities for one to be involved with Brazilian art forms. In order to understand singing development of children involved in the Maracatu de Baque Virado, we interviewed 4 girls aged 5-11, who were members of different groups situated within the Pina shantytown in Recife. The Nações (nations) de Maracatu de Baque Virado are musical and artistic groups that are normally connected to terreiros de candomble (Afro-Brazilian religion), especially in the city of Recife (circa 1.5 million inhabitants). These cultural manifestations are both dramatic and musical: the dramatic part is presented by the corte (court), and the batuque (musical ensemble) is responsible for the music. The latter is performed through songs (canto das loas) accompanied by percussion instruments. The master leads with the voice, and also directs the batuque. During the time of Carnaval, there is a dispute between the nations, and each year, one of them is the winner. Nações de Maracatu are normally composed by adults, yet some children may also participate as it happened here. All four participating children took part in the corte or batuque, played apercussion instrument called abê, and had a relative who is a member of the group. Interviews took place in the children’s homes, where we also interviewed parents and relatives. Thirteen sung renditions were recorded in both audio and video formats. Data are being analyzed with attention to previous work on music learning in Brazilian popular culture (Prass, 1998; Arroyo, 1998; Queiroz, 2005; Braga, 2005; Náder, 2006; Abib, 2006; Gramani, 2009). A musicological analysis is also being carried out, as a starting point to discuss how singing is learned and how children develop musically in these contexts.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.1 LEARNING TO SING NATURALLY\n\n** Children's Songs Fieldwork Project: Bahian Children Sing their Favourite Songs **\n\nAngelita Broock (Federal University of Bahia) angelbroock@gmail.com Beatriz Ilari (University of Southern California) ilari@usc.edu\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nChildren sing in many contexts of their everyday lives. They learn songs and musical games as they interact with teachers, family members and friends, whether in moments of leisure or formal learning (Campbell, 2002). Songs play important roles in many aspects of their lives. But, to this date, little is known about the songs that children choose to sing well as their functions and meanings. Furthermore, how these songs shape early musical preferences remains unknown. This is especially true in the case of Brazil, where research concerning music and children is in its early stages. The present study was conducted in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil with six 4- to 6-year–olds. Although five children participated in the Outreach Project \"Musicalização Infantil\" of the Federal University of Bahia, they did not know each other. Children were invited to meet with the researcher as in a focus group, and talk about music and sing. Eleven songs were collected: nine traditional folksongs and two pop songs (e.g., Xuxa, Skank). Sung performances included both individual and collective renditions. These musical selections are probably a result of what children learn at home or at school. However, it was also interesting that children chose to sing traditional songs over invented or pop ones. The fact that children were singing in groups and that the researcher was the music teacher of many, possibly influenced their selection. Likewise, it is also possible that this repertoire represents the stereotypical view of music teaching in the early years. As Campbell (2002) suggested, it is generally accepted that teachers, have a very similar repertoire, despite their own particularities. In Brazil, this also happens, with and usually this \"common repertoire\" contains songs of the folk repertoire. A full musicological analysis of songs, lyrics, contents, singing ranges and meanings attributed to selections will be presented at the meeting. Implications for music education will also be provided.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.1 LEARNING TO SING NATURALLY\n\n** Children's Songs Fieldwork Project: The Case of \"Folia de Reis Estrela do Oriente\" in Montes Carlos, Minas Gerais, Brazil **\n\nAngelita Broock (Federal University of Bahia) angelbroock@gmail.com Tiago Carvalho (Federal University of Bahia)\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nChildren's universe is highlighted by songs that play reflexive roles and are generative of cultural patterns, expressed socially (Blacking, 1995). Songs sung by children, in turn, have socializing aspects, allowing them to learn new things, negotiate and create modes of belonging. These songs can be derived from children's relationship with a group of experiences in contexts such as the family and the school or through the media. This paper presents the context of \"Folia de Reis Estrela do Oriente\", a traditional popular Catholic group that is associated with the \"festa de Reis\" (feasts of the Magi) in the Montes Claros city, Minas Gerais, Brazil. This group is composed by 50-to 60-year-olds, who include children and teenagers in the group, teaching them songs, dances and how to play musical instruments. This is a way to insert younger generation into the dynamics of \"Folia de Reis\" and to preserve the practice. The present study was conducted during a rehearsal of this group and the data collection was made through video and audio recordings, photographs and interviews with the group leader and participating children. Through observations, it was possible to identify some standards by which the repertoire is transmitted. At the same time, the interviews, as well as the body gestures of some children during the performance, showed an influence of common repertoires to particular musical universe, from genres such as \"pagode\", \"sertanejo\" and hip hop. Finally, it was noted that the transmission of songs in the \"Folia de Reis Estrela do Oriente\" was marked by intergenerational relationships in a group created and controlled by adults (Groppo, 2000), which emphasizes children. It is clear, therefore, that learning music in this context is not simply a transfer of songs, but also a negotiation with the musical universe peculiar to children participating in the group.\n\nSUB-THEMES: 2.1 LEARNING TO SING NATURALLY (Relates to 2.2-FORMAL TEACHING OF SINGING & 2.3-TEACHING THROUGH SINGING)\n\n** Formal Musicking in a Children's Choir: A Case Study **\n\nJune Countryman (University of Prince Edward Island) jcountryman@upei.ca Natalie Sullivan (University of Prince Edward Island)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis in-progress case study of a children’s choir seeks to uncover pedagogical moves that account for the great sound in this particular choir of children (N=21), ages 8 -13. We will share our initial observations about those pedagogical practices that are effective with children, as determined by the resulting choral sound, the children’s reactions, the comments by individual children and the opinions of the director. We will illustrate aspects of the conductor’s pedagogy through rehearsal video clips. We also analyze the singers’ experience of being a part of the choir, in terms of self-efficacy, skill development, aesthetic experience, belonging and communal identity. These insights are gleaned from semi-structured interviews with pairs of singers. We also examine several parents’ opinions of their child’s experience with the choir.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.1 LEARNING TO SING NATURALLY (Relates to 2.3-TEACHING THROUGH SINGING)\n\n** Children's Song: Contemporary vs. Historical Versions**\n\nChristopher Roberts (University of Washington) croberts777@aol.com\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn 2011, I presented my AIRS-sponsored research, which identified and described five different websites that held historical field recordings of children singing from a variety of cultures, transcribed 34 songs, and provided a classification system for the musical material. This follow-up study focused on three recordings from one website (Alan Lomax’s Association for Cultural Equity), tracing the ways in which the three songs have been used by adults interested in bringing music to children. The field recordings of children were compared with similar field recordings made of adults, as well as modern versions, both commercial recordings available for purchase and the “series textbooks” that are commonly used in K-5 music classrooms in the United States and Canada. Similarities and differences regarding instrumentation, performance style, and melodic and rhythmic nuance were noted. In addition, the opinions of children in one fifth grade class were solicited, in order to gain a perspective on the affective responses of contemporary youth to the sets of recordings. Findings included the following: (1) The children on the historical recordings were more likely to switch between singing and speaking within the same song, while adults tended to remain in either a spoken or sung modality; (2) The children on the field recordings incorporated more rhythmic syncopation than adults of the same time period; (3) Instrumentation on the contemporary recordings utilized technological options (e.g. computerized musical sound effects), critically altering the sonic experience of the songs; (4) Recordings intended for use in schools simplified the rhythmic complexities found on field recordings; and (5) The vocal quality of the child performers in the series textbooks maintained a purity of tone quality that was not found on the earlier recordings. The modern-day children had a variety of opinions concerning the recordings, with some young students preferring the historical recordings, while others favored the contemporary versions. In this presentation, sample recordings will be played in order to highlight the similarities and differences between the song versions and the contemporary children’s comments on the recordings will be provided.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.2 FORMAL TEACHING OF SINGING\n\n** Using Multimedia Technology to Teach North Indian Vocal Music **\n\nUtpola Borah (Ohio State University) utpola@gmail.com\n\nAbstract:\n\nIntroduction: The tradition of music education in Hindustani (North Indian) classical music known as the “guru-sishya parampara,” is a unique system of transmitting musical knowledge, which can be trace back to the Vedic period (1st-6th centuries BCE). The terms guru (mentor/master), sishya (pupil/disciple) and parampara (tradition) collectively refer to an oral tradition that transmits the art/music through a preceptor. In India it is the basis of transmission for all art forms and embodies the living and learning relationship between master and disciple in both formal and informal learning settings. Although the guru-sishya parampara is being supported by variety of institutional setting in India and abroad, currently many gurus (instructors) are employing multimedia technologies for teaching music.\n\nMethod: I will examine the progress of three students through recordings of video conferencing lessons and interviews with students and parents.\n\nResults: Indian classical music requires face-to-face interaction between pupil and student. The use of Skype facilitates learning in diverse geographical locations, as it is often difficult for students to find competent gurus outside (and even within) India. However, skype lessons require greater use of written materials and fixed lesson plans.\n\nDiscussion: Multimedia technologies do not replace traditional learning systems, but have great potential for the teaching and learning of many styles of music throughout the world.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.2 FORMAL TEACHING OF SINGING (Relates to 1.2-MULTIMODAL (AUDIO/VISUAL/MOTOR) ASPECTS SINGING)\n\n** From Learning to Performing: A Case Study of Indian Vocal Music **\n\nHans Utter (Ohio State University) utter.3@osu.edu\n\nAbstract:\n\nIntroduction: The tradition of music education in India (guru-sisya parampara) is currently being supported in a variety of institutional settings. My presentation examines the training methods of the Sangeet Research Academy in Calcutta, focusing on a single student. I will compare the student in class and in a performance setting, focusing on the non-verbal communication of physical cues such as gestures, head movements, and other facial expressions.\n\nMethod: The methods employed consists of collecting ethnographic data through interviews and audio/video recordings, participation in learning situations, and examinations of this data to assess the success of teaching/learning and performance through audience reactions and the self- assessment of the instructors and the artist.\n\nResults: Certain institutions are more suited than others in the production of highly qualified artists and performers. It was found that the preservation of individualized instruction and reliance on oral transmission at the Sangeet Research Academy was superior to a standardized curriculum. The emphasis on active learning and instruction modeled on performance contexts is conducive for the production of vocalists capable of artistic excellence.\n\nDiscussion: For North Indian classical vocal music, the system of oral transmission and individualized training appears to be necessary for the requirements of this art form. The ability to elicit emotional responses in audiences is increased.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.3 TEACHING THROUGH SINGING\n\n** The Verbo-tonal Method and the use of Music to Enhance French Phonetics **\n\nSandra Cornaz (Université Stendhal- GIPSA-Lab) sandra.cornaz@gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr Lionel Granjon Nathalie Henrich (CR1-CNRS) Sonia Kandel Christophe Savariaux Nathalie Vallée (CR1-CNRS)\n\nAbstract:\n\nIntroduction: Applied linguistic of foreign languages uses various methods to enhance the ability to perceive new phonemes. In Europe, the verbo-tonal method is commonly used. In order to improve the perception skills, the VTM suggests to underline acoustical characteristics of the second language sound which aren't perceived by the non native learner, but which are significant in the target one. To improve segmental correction, the VTM offers many tools. In this experiment, we tested the impact of two of them on auditory abilities. Firstly, the use of a facilitating sound context (i.e. a sound combination process). Then, the use of the frequency modification (i.e. the tone of the sound is inflected). The experiment was conducted in Italy in order to learn more about the verbo-tonal efficiency in the discrimination of the French phoneme /y/, which lacks in Italian. Three main hypotheses were tested. The first hypothesis assumed that /y/ is well differentiated from /i/ but not from /u/ because Italian native speakers perceived /y/ too low. The perceptual distance would be bigger between /y/ and /i/. Both the following assumptions result from this prediction. The second hypothesis assumed that there is a positive impact of a high class consonant on the front rounded vowel discrimination. The third hypothesis supposed that there is a positive correlation between high tones and unknown vowel /y/ perception.\n\nMethod: 35 participants were involved. Most of them studied Language and Literature at the University of Padova, and they had different academic qualifications. They didn’t have any musical aptitude. 23 participants had never been in contact with French and 12 were at a beginner or intermediate level. They completed a music and speech perception test in which they had to perform a two alternative forced choice paradigm task. They had to listen to six realizations of the referent phoneme (/i/ or /u/) used in both French and Italian vocalic system. Each of them was included in a syllable CV-type, the consonant being either /t/ or /p/. Subsequently, they heard a list of 324 items to compare, including the referent phoneme, the unknown phoneme /y/ and a common phoneme in both languages. In this task, /a/ was used as a distractor. Each item could have been produced on three tones: A2, C3, E3.\n\nResults: As results of this experiment, we ascertained that non native vowel discrimination ability is linked to (1) contrast, (2) co-articulation, (3) and tone. Sometimes the correlation works only when some of these conditions are correlated or, even the opposite, when the conditions aren't correlated. Globally, the experimentation leads us to the conclusion that the first and the second assumptions received support, pointed out that comparing /y/ to the contrast /i/ may have a positive effect on the discrimination ability of the non native vowel among Italian learners of French. We observe the same positive effect when /y/ is co-articulated with /t/. At the end, we noticed that a correlation between music and discrimination ability exists, but a highest vowel doesn't help to improve the discrimination of /y/. Music may be used to reinforce a perceptual distance between two sound-types already recognized as different by the learners.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.3 TEACHING THROUGH SINGING\n\n** Can Singing Aid Language Acquisition in Post-Puberty Learners? **\n\nHenrietta Lempert (University of Toronto) lempert@psych.utoronto.ca Assunta Ferrant (University of Toronto) Ju Hee Lim (University of Toronto) Rachel Williams (University of Toronto) Natalie Kwok (University of Toronto)\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nIntroduction: Children seem to absorb new languages with ease, whereas learning a foreign language is a major struggle for most adults. However, although adults perform at chance level when required to extract novel words from a continuous stream of spoken syllables, they evidence learning when exposed to sung syllables. But can singing facilitate language-learning in adults beyond aiding their perception of statistical regularities in the speech stream? If so, which aspects of language does it aid and how?\n\nMethod: We examine these issues with a novel language comprised of 14 words divided into three classes. The language comes in two versions, a suffix dialect (hifto wadim vabie) and a prefix dialect (ohift wadim ievab). In one learning condition, the study sentences are sung and in the other condition, spoken. Participants (Introductory Psychology students) repeat 24 study sentences according to condition and are tested for rule learning with 32 spoken sentences (16 legal sentences that did not occur during study trials and 16 illegal instances that violate one of the rules).\n\nResults: Currently available results for first language English females (n = 33) indicate a comparable number of false negative responses in the speaking and singing conditions (false negative = incorrectly rejecting a legal sentence). In the prefix dialect, correct rejection of illicit sentences did not differ on Trial 1 in the singing and speaking conditions (Ms = 8.9 and 8.4) but on Trial 3, performance was reliably superior in the singing than speaking condition (Ms = 11.0 and 8.9). In the suffix dialect, speaking was more likely than speaking to elicit correct rejections on Trial 1 (Ms = 9.1 and 7.4) but by Trial 3, performance in the two conditions did not differ (Ms = 9.2 and 9.1). The results suggest that perception of linguistic features differs in sung and spoken sentences and that the complementary use of both approaches is important for second language acquisition in adult learners.\n\nSUB-THEME: 2.3 TEACHING THROUGH SINGING\n\n** Ditty as Didactic Tool for the Teaching of French Phonetics **\n\nSandra Cornaz (GIPSA-Lab) Chrystèle Chovelon (Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régional, Grenoble) Nadia Jauneau-Cury (Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régional, Grenoble)\n\nAbstract:\n\nApplied Linguistics and speech therapy use musical texts in order to help learners being more familiar with phonetic aspects. Ditties seem an excellent basis because they are little songs - generally used for children – easy to memorize and to produce. First, rhythms, intervals and pitches are simple. Second, texts are short, rhymed and repetitive. Eventually, sounds and games play a bigger part than textual meaning. The problem is that teachers often simplify the form and/or the content, and mainly focus on the text. Thus, they pay little attention to music features, whereas they may reinforce segmental and supra-segmental aspects. Therefore, we suggest the use of a ditty especially formulated for the teaching and the learning of French phonetics. Our research leads to the conclusion that a close collaborative work between teacher and composer is required. In addition, our study showed that the composition of the ditty should follow a specific order of activities. (1) To begin with, the teacher (sometimes associated with the composer) writes the lyrics. In this goal, the choice of vocabulary will depend on the particular phonemes the teacher decides to teach. Also, the consonants should be selected in order to make the perception or the production of a given vowel easier, and vice versa. The teacher explains to the composer where are the stressed syllables. (2) Afterwards, the composer creates the rhythm, which shall faithfully result from the recitation or reading of the text. Then, he composes the music according to the textual meaning, if any, while taking into account supra-segmental and segmental constraints. Furthermore, the musical creation will depend on the learners’ competences in singing and music theory. Generally, we recommend the writing to be based on a limited vocal pitch range and on a simple rhythmic pattern, in such a way that every learner could sing it. The resulting ditty with a didactic purpose should retain all the characteristics of the genre, and at the same time, perfectly adapt to a phonetic teaching and learning situation. Consequently, the teacher may use the material without distorting an authentic genre, and overall, using music and singing to enhance skills in French phonetics.\n\nTHEME 3 - SINGING AND WELL-BEING\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.1 SINGING AND CROSS-CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING\n\n** The Impact of a Culture-Bearer on Inter-cultural Understanding **\n\nBenjamin Bolden (Queen's University) ben.bolden@queensu.ca Larry O'Farrell (Queen's University)\n\nAbstract:\n\nIntroduction: Global music experts such as Campbell (2004) suggest a ‘culture-bearer’ may be helpful in negotiating the challenges associated with learning and engaging with music from unfamiliar musical cultures and traditions. Burton (2002) describes a culture-bearer as “one raised within the culture who is a recognized practitioner of the culture’s music” (p. 178). The culture-bearer approach makes sense, but also raises concerns (Vaugeois, 2009). Will the culture-bearer be able to effectively communicate with the musicians, and enable them to gain meaningful understanding of the music? Is it possible for one person, in a protracted period of time, to reasonably provide adequate knowledge of an entire musical tradition, let alone adequate knowledge of the entire culture in which the musical tradition developed? An Ontario adult community choir was recently visited by a guest conductor who taught and conducted music from the African American Gospel tradition. This qualitative case study serves to examine the impact on choir members of working with a culture-bearer (the guest conductor) on repertoire from a particular musical tradition. Of primary interest is any inter-cultural understanding that choir members develop through their music making and learning in this context. The research is guided by the following questions: 1. How does working with an expert from a particular musical tradition impact choir members’ understandings of, a) that particular musical tradition, b) that particular culture in general. 2. How were such understandings communicated to the singers?\n\nMethod: Qualitative data will be collected through a focus group discussion and interviews with the choristers, and interviews with the guest conductor and regular conductor. Data analysis will involve open coding followed by axial coding of emergent themes (Strauss & Corbin 1990).\n\nResults: We have just begun data collection. Preliminary results will be reported at the AIRS conference in August.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.1 SINGING AND CROSS-CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING\n\n** Sustainable New Practices for an Endangered Species of Song **\n\nRena Sharon (University of British Columbia) rena.sharon@ubc.ca Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson (University of British Columbia) Gayle Shay (Vanderbilt University) Laurel Fais (University of British Columbia)\n\nAbstract:\n\nA massive trove of global Song is at risk of extinction as a performative modality. Art Song – the fusion of poetry and music – is a genre comprising over 100,000 songs, with contributions by upwards of 10,000 poets in over 100 languages in musical settings by 12,000+ composers. Much of the vast international repertoire is completely unknown. Though it is in continual growth as a compositional medium, its performance is increasingly confined to a shrinking “boutique” listener contingent who are comfortable in the relatively austere practices of the recital modality. In the emergent century of Opera, the Art Song genre may become relegated to an archival digital existence, disappearing from live performance venues within the coming decades. It would be a forfeiture of a collection that offers a tremendous delivery system for millennia of global poetry within a fascinating hybrid communication mode. This project studies the causes of audience attrition and the systemic cascade of consequences to the education and performance options for its artists. The Vancouver International Song Institute is a leading international nexus of innovation whose mandate addresses the erosion of Art Song receptivity with new strategies for training and accessible multi-media performance. A series of research studies from its experimental performance laboratories gather empirical data relating to cognitive shifts for performers and audiences when new elements are introduced to the traditional practices of the art form. The presentation includes video capture of comparative performance modalities, with measurement of changes in vocal production (e.g. vibrato, pitch, breathing) and artistic decision-making (e.g. note lengths, diction, dynamics). The discussion focuses on the impact to performance expressivity and audience cognition in performance options with diverse gestural and spatial parameters, as well as the philosophical implications of deviating from traditional recital formats.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.1 SINGING AND CROSS-CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING\n\n** Children's Voices on Singing in an Elementary Choral Music Program: A Two-Year Survey **\n\nLisa Crawford (University of Southern California) Lily Chen Hafteck (Kean University)\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nIntroduction: Singing is an important means of human communication (Welch, 2005), accessible to most human beings, and has been prevalent in music education. Through singing, students are able to develop self-expression and may be in closer touch with their feelings. Attitudes of children toward singing and choral participation have been studied by some researchers (Mizener, 1993; Rao, 1993) as well as topics concerning well-being through music education (Gick, 2010; Boyce-Tillman, 2000). The purpose of this study was to examine feelings children have about singing in their choral music program.\n\nMethod:In a school district in a large urban center of California, data were obtained via a non-gender-related survey questionnaire (N=749) from elementary students over a two-year period. Through open-ended questions, students were invited to express how they felt about singing in their spring concert and what they liked most about music activities. Additional fill-in-the-blank questions asked students about their music experience.\n\nResults:Results of the two open-ended questions revealed the highest percentage of elementary students focused on their feelings of happiness about singing as a group and sadness when family were unable to attend the concert across all grade levels. In this survey, one fourth grade student communicated her feelings this way: \"I felt like I was being lifted into the musical world of heaven and all the angels cheered as I rised. Then when I rose back up on the riser, I fell back into earth but I felt happier than I was when I went.\" 80% of students did not receive formal music training outside of the public school classroom and did not report participation in other formal or informal musical experiences.\n\nDiscussion: While these findings contradict some previous findings, this may be a result of socioeconomic concerns or methodological limitations of the survey instrument. An analysis of the survey and implications for music education will be presented.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.1 SINGING AND CROSS-CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING\n\n** Using Songs From Different Cultures for the Development of Voice **\n\nAlda de Jesus Oliveira (Federal University of Bahia) alda@sonare.com.br\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe author´s experiences with teaching and investigation in music pedagogy related to socio-cultural contexts, especially in Bahia, Brazil, are critically reflected in relationship to the preliminary data and field observations of the AIRS international study on cultural understanding applied since February 2012, with children from Brazil, Canada, China and Kenya. The author has participated in the AIRS International Project on Cultural Understanding, coordinated by Dr. Lily Hafteck, over a span of 12 weeks. Students of the Educational Center Santo Antonio (CESA) and “Dois de Julho” School (from the State of Bahia) have learned six traditional songs from each country, a total of 24 songs, together with background information about the songs and cultures. Teaching materials (songbook, CD, DVD and PowerPoint slides) provided the songs and information on cultural backgrounds in student´s native languages (English, Chinese and Portuguese). The song repertoire chosen included music that could represent the Brazilian essence and the traditional spirit of children´s play. Two classes of children from each school ages 10 and 11, are participating. The experimental class learned both the cultural information and songs while the control class only learned the cultural information. During the period of 12 weeks, the CESA students learned to sing all Brazilian and Kenyan songs, one Chinese song, and two Canadian songs. They have responded to a questionnaire before and after the study to assess their attitude towards the people from the four countries. A questionnaire on the opinion on the songs of each country was also administered after the unit. Interviews were conducted with both teachers and children. The research study is still in process at the “Dois de Julho” school. In addition to develop creative and performance based music skills, the study applied at CESA school have contributed to develop student and teacher´s capacities to deal with ambiguity, to explore new possibilities of singing and dancing, to express their own thoughts and feelings and understand the perspectives of others. In my opinion the students are becoming to more globally aware, collaborative, and responsible citizens. Through the use of effective and well organized communications devices (CD, DCD, book, scores, power point) the AIRS study connected students and teachers in today’s interconnected world. The native musical examples provided excellent models for the development of the voice, since the participating children could watch the native children, of their own age, singing and dancing, playing the original games themselves. At the final presentation the experimental classroom teacher said “I wish all the disciplines were as effective as this project was for the promotion of collaborative, concentrated, creative and positive emotions processes at CESA school.” Both teacher and students were able to learn and to critically interpret the media messages, and to convey their own ideas through the medium of artistic form, using well the artistic media and tools by incorporating the technology proposed by the AIRS project. Singing the selected songs learned by listening to the CDs and seeing the videos promoted the development of curiosity, imagination and creativity. For our satisfaction, they also developed their evaluation skills, since they were frequently comparing their own performances with the original recorded models of songs from each participating country. Through the use of songs from different cultures for the development of voice and for cultural understanding we could promote at the CESA school the collaboration among researchers, students, teachers (music and classroom), school principal and pedagogic supervisors, and above all, promote the use of media, both traditional and new, as a powerful opportunity to cultivate 21st century skills by articulating human expression through the development of the voice.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.1 SINGING AND CROSS-CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING\n\n** Can Music Change National and Racial Attitudes **\n\nFelix Neto (University of Porto)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis study assessed the effectiveness of a musical program at changing national and racial attitudes. The sample consisted of 268 participants who were attending public schools near Lisbon (Cascais and Setúbal), Portugal. Ten intact classes from sixth-grade took part in the study. Eighty five percent had the Portuguese nationality and 15% had a foreign nationality. In the current study we will consider only those participants with the Portuguese nationality, that is, 229 participants. Their mean age was 142.50 months (SD = 10.20, range = 129-182). For the purposes of the research national and racial attitudes measures were used. Three national attitudes measures were used: number of positive trait terms applied to Cape Verdean national group; number of negative trait terms applied to Cape Verdean national group; and overall evaluation of Cape Verdean national group. National attitudes towards the ingroup (Portugal) and another outgroup (Brazil) were also assessed. Two racial attitudes were used: explicit and implicit racial attitudes. Implicit racial attitudes were measured using racial prejudice Implicit Association test (IAT). The program consisted in introducing in the series of songs to be studied and learnt by the pupils during music courses at school a sub-series of Cape Verdean songs together with the regular Portuguese songs. The findings suggest that the cross-cultural musical program has not changed national attitudes toward Portugal (in-group) and Brazil (another out-group). However, in agreement with our hypotheses, participants exposed to the program have improved positive trait terms and affective evaluation attributed to Cape Verdean national group, and reduced negative traits attributed to Cape Verdean national group. Similarly, concerning the racial attitudes the results suggest that the cross-cultural musical program has improved both explicit racial attitudes and implicit racial attitudes. The change seems even higher for implicit racial attitudes than for explicit racial attitudes. The findings are discussed stressing their importance for future research.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.1 SINGING AND INTERGENERATIONAL UNDERSTANDING\n\n** The International Project on Cultural Understanding: An Overview **\n\nLily Chen-Hafteck (Music Education, Kean University, Union, NJ USA) lhafteck@ucla.edu\n\nAbstract:\n\nSince February 2012, some children from Brazil, Canada, China and Kenya have participated in the AIRS International Project on Cultural Understanding over a span of 12 weeks. They have learned six traditional songs from each country, a total of 24 songs, together with background information about the songs and cultures. The teaching materials included a songbook and PowerPoint slides that provide the songs and information on their cultural backgrounds in English, Chinese and Portuguese, and demonstration video and audio-recordings that were developed during more than one year by a team of AIRS researchers. Two schools in each country and two classes of children from each school, ages 10 and 11, participated. One class learned both the cultural information and songs while the other class only learned the cultural information. Children responded to a questionnaire before and after the study to assess their attitude towards the people from the four countries. A questionnaire on the opinion on the songs of each country was also administered after the unit on each country. Interviews were conducted with both teachers and children at the end of the research. Reports from teachers and researchers were also collected. Currently, the team is working on data analyses.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.2 SINGING AND INTERGENERATIONAL UNDERSTANDING\n\n** I Ain't No Damn Singer! Exploring the Musical Perceptions of Older Adults Involved in an Intergenerational Singing Program **\n\nJennifer Hutchison (Western University) lmckee@uwo.ca Carol Beynon (Western University) beynon@uwo.ca Rachel Heydon (Western University) rheydon@uwo.ca Dr. Susan O'Neill (Simon Fraser University) sao@sfu.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe nature of this study is aimed at identifying and exploring the learning outcomes of an intergenerational, multimodal curriculum that focuses on interactive singing. The program involved 20 residents from a retirement home and a Grade 2 class of 18 students from the local public school. The sessions explored songs across various themes that acted as links in fostering dialogue, musical discourse and shared learnings among the participants. After the program ended, interviews with children, residents, teachers, the school principal and retirement home staff were conducted through which participants were encouraged to share their experiences of the program as well as their personal musical experience and background. While extensive research details the mental and physical health benefits of intergenerational musicking, observational and narrative data from this study revealed a prevalent theme pertaining to seniors' perception of lack of confidence and musical inadequacy.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.3 HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING\n\n** Sing Me to Sleep: Aboriginal Resilience and Music **\n\nJean Emmerson (University of Saskatchewan) Jennifer Nicol (University of Saskatchewan) JAJ.Nicol@usask.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nThere have been calls from both Aboriginal (Lafrance, Bodor, & Bastien, 2008) and non-Aboriginal communities (Kelly, 2011) for greater support for parents experiencing vulnerability due to economic and social circumstances by “establishing programs that educate families on how to reconnect with one another and how to love one another again” (Lafrance et al, 2008, p. 314). Most parenting programs are not well-attended by families who are disadvantaged and marginalized (Nicholson et al., 2008). However, parent-child music programs have been found to be better attended, encourage positive interactions, develop children’s skills, and promote inter-family relationships with people in these circumstances (Ledger, 2011; Nicholson, Berthelsen, Abad, Williams, & Bradley, 2008). There is limited research on parent-child music programs with Aboriginal mothers (Williams & Abad, 2005). Parent-child music programs have been found to improve the quality of relationships and attachment between caregivers and children (e.g., Cunningham, 2011) and promote self-regulation (Creighton, 2011; Dissanayake, 2000; Longhi, 2009; Mackenzie & Hamlett, 2005; Nakata & Trehub, 2004; Papousek, 1996; Trainor, 1996), which is a precursor to resilience (Masten, Cutuli, Herbers, & Reed, 2009). Parent-child music programs have also been found to enhance language, cognitive, and social skills (e.g., Edwards, 2011). I am working with a local parent-child music educator to develop and implement a music program in an alternative high school. I am also seeking guidance from a Cree elder since there will likely be Aboriginal research participants; many young Saskatoon mothers are of Aboriginal heritage. In preparing for this study I have researched Aboriginal history, ethics, and issues, and AIRS presents an opportunity to share this work with others. Singing and physical contact with infants are primary in Aboriginal childrearing traditions (Whidden, 2007). This presentation explores how singing can support Aboriginal resilience and references ethical research with Aboriginal peoples.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.3 HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING\n\n** Vocal Strengthening Group Treatment **\n\nMerrill Tanner (University of Alberta/Glenrose Rehabilitation Hosptial) merrill.tanner@ualberta.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nIntroduction:A successful group vocalization program for people with Parkinson’s disease was studied and the method is now being utilized in the community and at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital for a variety of diagnoses. Presentation of the research results of the Ph.D. project will be followed by a group voice lesson with audience participation\n\nMethod:A group vocalization program for people with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) consisting of vocal exercises and choral singing was studied using a single group pretest-posttest research design. A total of 28 people with IPD participated in the study. The intervention program was twice a week for six weeks. The program included vocal warm-up, vocal exercises, singing exercises, choral speech, and choral singing with piano accompaniment. No individual treatment was offered, only group sessions.\n\nResults:Rigorous statistical analysis was used to correct for the 13 variables measured in this exploratory study. Statistically significant improvement (p< .001) was found in two of the eleven measures of “vocal ability” (average frequency during an oral reading task and maximum intensity range) and on the Speech Intelligibility Inventory: Self Assessment Form (p< .001 and effect size of .93), one of the two self-assessment questionnaire measures of “vocal quality of life”. Clinically relevant results were found for both “vocal quality of life” questionnaires and on three (maximum intensity range, maximum frequency range, and fundamental frequency variation during oral reading) measures of vocal ability.\n\nDiscussion:These results indicate that participants with a progressive neurological disease experienced some improvement in their vocal skills and improved vocal quality of life following participation in a short-term group voice program. Group interventions similar to this study are now offered in the Edmonton community and at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. The Glenrose offers a “vocal strengthening group” for people with voice problems due to Parkinson’s disease, stroke, brain injury, deconditioning, and other diseases.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.3 HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING\n\n** Buddy's Glee Club: Singing for Health and Wellness **\n\nAmy Clements-Cortes (Baycrest Centre, Toronto, ON) notesbyamy2@yahoo.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nIntroduction:The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits of participating in a choir facilitated by a music therapist on the health, wellness and successful aging of older adults. This study focused on older adults who were cognitively intact and/or diagnosed with dementia.\n\nQuestions: What if any are the benefits of the lived experience of singing in a glee club facilitated by a music therapist and music therapy accompanist as expressed by older adults attending day care programs? How can a glee club program best be implemented with older adults attending adult day care programs? What is the impact of singing on the physical and emotional dimensions of health?\n\nMethod:Participants completed an intake questionnaire on general health and wellness and a battery of pre and post test assessments on mood, self-esteem etc. Interviews were conducted with participants at the completion of the choral sessions. Choral sessions took place one time per week for one hour for a total of 16 weeks.\n\nResults:There were five large themes that emerged from the analysis of the interview and the researcher’s field notes including: friendship and companionship; simplicity; happiness, uplifting and positive feelings; relaxing and reduced anxiety; and fun. Below is a discussion with respect to each theme and direct quotes in italic font from participants.\n\nDiscussion: The majority of participants in this study benefited from attending the choir and thoroughly enjoyed many aspects of singing in a medium to large size group. Several participants commented that even if physical limitations such as throat pain or physical inability to sing inhibited them from singing all of the songs or words, the facilitators were very helpful in adjusting what was required and they enjoyed going to choir. The plans for Phase Two of the study will also be shared.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.3 HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING\n\n** Asthma in a Sample of Carleton University Students **\n\nCarina Daugherty (Carleton University) Mary Gick (Carleton University) mary_gick@carleton.ca\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nAsthma is caused by interference in airways due to muscle spasms, secretion of mucus, and inflamed tissues contributing to discomfort when breathing (Wade, 2002). Asthma is irreversible but can be managed, commonly with bronchodilators (Lord et al., 2010). Research on benefits of singing in asthma (e.g., due to controlled breathing) is inconclusive and lacking in adults (Gick, 2011). The present pilot study examined frequency and perceptions of singing in students with asthma. Participants (n = 93) from Carleton University, all diagnosed with asthma, completed an online questionnaire consisting of self-reported measures of well-being, and asthma history, severity, and control. Participants were also asked about activities (including singing) engaged in, or avoided due to asthma, and perceptions of these activities for asthma control. 65% of participants reported that they sing, and most (98%) exercised or played sports. Most (78.5%) participants reported that exercise or sports helped control their asthma, while only 21.5% of participants reported that singing helps control their asthma. Approximately 50% of participants reported at least sometimes avoiding exercise or sports due to asthma, while 19 % of participants reported avoiding singing due to asthma. Although singing and exercise/sports participation was not associated with asthma severity, participants reporting avoiding singing or exercise/sports due to asthma had significantly poorer asthma control (both ps < .01). Students avoiding exercise/sports scored lower on the vitality measure of well-being (p = .018); participants avoiding singing tended to have lower vitality (p = .110). Taken together, students with asthma sing less than they exercise and perceive it to be less beneficial for their asthma. Future research comparing students with asthma to those with other (or no) illnesses may determine whether the pattern of singing and exercise frequency and perceptions is common to all students. Singing interventions may help uncover the relationship between singing avoidance, and asthma control and vitality.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.3 HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING\n\n** Choir Singing as a Health Promoting Behaviour **\n\nJennifer Nicol (University of Saskatchewan) JAJ.Nicol@usask.ca Marya Stonehouse (University of Saskatchewan) Katie McCaw (University of Saskatchewan)\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nGrounded theory is an established research method used to generate mid-range theory that explains a social process, in this case, choir singing as a health process. The current study's purpose is to inductively generate an explanatory model that describes (a) the processes by which singing is experienced by choir members as a health promoting activity and (b) factors that might account for variations. In-depth semi-structured interviews with eight participants have been completed, fully transcribed, entered in NVIVO (a qualitative data management program) and analyzed. The findings of this first round of analysis informed successive interviews with additional participants. The proposed poster will present the emerging grounded theory in it successive stages of coding and analysis with the intent of both reporting findings and illustrating the research method.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.3 HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING\n\n** Singing and Health: A Research Initiative at the Centre for Arts in Human Development (CAHD) at Concordia University **\n\nLaurel Young (Concordia University) laurel.young68@gmail.com Tiana Malone (Concorida University)\n\nAbstract: poster\n\nAlthough previous research has indicated that singing can have positive health outcomes for the general population (i.e., improved mood, increased self-esteem/confidence, increased feelings of well being, improved respiration, positive impacts on the immune system, etc.) the relevance of these findings for many special needs populations have not been fully explored. Recent publications do indicate that some models of clinical practice are starting to emerge. However, these publications also reveal that more research is needed to support the efficacy of these practices, and that there are many populations for whom models have yet to be developed. The purpose of the first singing and health research project at the CAHD is to investigate the impact of a structured weekly singing group on the health and well being of adults with developmental disabilities. It is hoped that this will be the first of several projects conducted at the CAHD that will aid in the development of specific models of singing/vocal techniques that can be used in both clinical and non-clinical (i.e., community) contexts with individuals who have a variety of complex or special needs (e.g., individuals with cancer, physical disabilities, dementia, etc.). Furthermore, the results of this research and of future studies will be used to develop training workshops for music therapists, musicians, other health professionals, and/or educators who want to develop high quality and effective singing programs for persons with complex or special needs. This poster will provide an overview on this initiative as well as highlight relevant perspectives on singing and health from the field of music therapy.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.3 HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING\n\n** Exploring the Implementation of an English Model of Health Promotion on Singing Groups for Older Adults (Silver Song Clubs) in Italy **\n\nElisabetta Corvo (Canterbury Christ Church University) e.corvo210@canterbury.ac.uk\n\nAbstract:\n\nIntroduction:The aims of the research is to carry out an exploratory study in Italy (Rome) of the value of weekly singing activity for older people, exploring the implementation of a health promotion model based on singing groups for older adults (Silver Song Clubs - SSCs). The beneficial effects of music in terms of well being, increased quality of life and health of older people are supported by several pieces of research; SSCs are music based community interventions shown in the UK to be effective as a model of health promotion.\n\nMethod:The research was divided into two main parts. The main objective of Part A was to inquire into the status of the elderly in the city of Rome, and evaluate the role that music has had in their lives, through semi- structured interviews. Part B was focused on setting up and evaluating singing groups and gathering information from participants on their experiences of singing through standardized and widely-used quality of life questionnaires (at baseline, at the end and 3 months later as a follow up).\n\nResults:Interviews of elderly people showed they are mainly engaged in quite solitary activities, with educational level as a modulating factor. The more educated people are, the more they are interested in the experience of singing. The comparison before and after singing shows a general level of improvement in the two observed singing groups between the baseline questionnaire and the second one, while in the third (follow up) questionnaire, there was an overall decrease but with a number of cases still above the baseline.\n\nDiscussion:First analysis shows that the intervention seems to have a good impact on self-perceived health and the quality of life of participants.\n\nSUB-THEME: 3.3 HEALTH BENEFITS OF SINGING\n\n** Inclusive Choirs: Welcoming Youth with Disabilities **\n\nMarya Stonehouse (University of Saskatchewan) Jennifer Nicol (University of Saskatchewan) JAJ.Nicol@usask.ca\n\nAbstract: poster"
