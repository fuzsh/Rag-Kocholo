The American Library Association Archives are described in a separate database.\n\nMaterials are arranged according to the principle of provenance (files from one creating office or person are not mixed with those from another) and they are also indexed by subject. The Archives are available for use during the University Archives' normal business hours. We can be contacted at illiarch@illinois.edu or (217) 333-0798."
