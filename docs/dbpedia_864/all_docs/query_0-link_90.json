        "text": "Notifications\n\nHeld at: Philadelphia Museum of Art Archives [Contact Us]Philadelphia Museum of Art, PO Box 7646, Philadelphia, PA 19101-7646\n\nThis is a finding aid. It is a description of archival material held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art Archives. Unless otherwise noted, the materials described below are physically available in their reading room, and not digitally available through the web.\n\nOverview and metadata sections\n\nTo reflect the coming millenium, the Twentieth Century Art Department became known in the year 2000 as the department of Modern and Contemporary Art. The first exhibition mounted by the department that year, which was held March 25 to July 20, was \"Celebrating the Eight: American Modernism from the Potamkin Collection.\"\n\nAnn Temkin, who came to the Museum in 1989 as Acting Curator of Twentieth Century Art, continued under the new department name as the Muriel and Philip Berman Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art. She assumed the endowed curatorial position in 1990. Michael Taylor and Susan Rosenberg were Assistant Curators. When Temkin left the Museum for a co-curatorial position at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in the fall of 2003, Taylor was named the Muriel and Philip Berman Curator of Modern Art. The position of Curator of Contemporary Art remained vacant until 2006 when Carlos Basualdo joined the Museum staff.\n\nAt present this record group documents two exhibitions: \"Giorgio de Chirico and the Myth of Ariadne\" (2002/2003), and \"Jacques Lipchitz and Philadelphia\" (2004). The 2.5 linear feet of records pertaining to the de Chirico exhibition consist of research files. Topics include the artist's drawings at the Musee Picasso, relationship between the artist and the contemporary writings of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzche, de Chirico's influence on pop artist Andy Warhol, and other themes explored in the exhibition and related website. The Lipchitz exhibition records measure nearly 4 linear feet and and document every aspect of the exhibition, from loans and installation to merchandising, publicity and exhibition opening. There are also research files, clippings, gallery label drafts, slides and audiovisual materials. Records beginning in 1990 to a cancelled traveling exhibition featuring Alfred Stieglitz, which was to come to Philadelphia in 2003, are included in the Twentieth Century Art Department Records.\n\nFolder-level inventories are available in the Archives.\n\nPhiladelphia Musuem of Art, Archives.
