        "text": "Citation preview\n\nROBIN S. HARRIS is a professor of Higher Education at the University of Toronto. This book traces the development of higher education in Canada, through a detailed description and analysis of what was being taught and of the research opportunities available to professors in the years from 1860 to 1960. Background is provided in the opening chapters of Part I, which outline the origins of postsecondary education in both French and English Canada from 1635 to 1860, and in the parallel chapters of Parts II to V which describe the establishment of new and the growth of existing institutions during the period 1861-90, 1891-1920, 1921-40, and 1941-60. The remaining chapters of each of the book's main divisions present an examination of the curricula in arts and science, professional education, and graduate studies in 1860, 1890, 1920, 1940, and 1960, as well as the conditions pertaining to scholarship and research in these years. The concluding chapter identifies the characteristics which differentiate Canadian higher education from that of other countries. The book includes a full bibliography, an extensive index, and statistical appendices providing data on enrolment and degrees granted. A History of Higher Education in Canada 1663-1960 will be the definitive work in its field, valuable both for the wealth of information and the historical insights it contains.\n\nContents\n\nForeword\n\nxiii\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nPART I:\n\n1860\n\n1\n\nThe Royal Visit of 1860\n\n2\n\nThe Development of Higher Education in French Canada, 1635-1860 14\n\n3\n\nEnglish Canada, 1787-1860\n\n4\n\nArts and Science 37 The Three B.A. Programs 38 Humanities and Social Sciences Mathematics and Science 53 Extension 55\n\n5\n\n6\n\n3\n\n27\n\n47\n\nProfessional Education 58 Theology 60 Medicine 63 Law 66 Engineering 72 Agriculture 73 Graduate Studies, Teacher Training, Commerce Scholarship and Research\n\nPART II:\n\n78\n\n1890\n\n7\n\nThe Royal Society of Canada, 1882-1890\n\n8\n\nInstitutional Development The Maritimes 103 Quebec 106 Ontario 108 The West 113\n\n103\n\n93\n\n75\n\n9\n\nArts and Science 119 The General B.A. 120 B.Sc., B.L. and Ph.B. 126 The Honours B.A. 129 Special Offerings 133 Humanities 134 Social Sciences 140 Sciences 144 Extension 147\n\n10\n\nProfessional Education 150 Theology 151 Law 156 160 Medicine Engineering 164 Architecture 168 Agriculture 169 Veterinary Medicine 171 173 Royal Military College Dentistry 174 Pharmacy 176 Music 178 Teacher Training 179 Commerce, Physical Education, Nursing\n\n11\n\nGraduate Studies 185 The Master's Degree 185 The Ph.D. 187 188 Fellowships\n\n12\n\nScholarship and Research 193 Applied Research in Government Departments 194 Learned and Professional Societies 196 Professional Journals 197 Journals of Opinion and University Publications\n\nPART III:\n\n1920\n\n13\n\nThe Conference of Canadian Universities, 1911-1920 205\n\n14\n\nInstitutional Development 212 The Maritimes 212 217 Quebec Ontario 221 224 The West The Federal Government 230\n\n15\n\nArts and Science 234 235 The General or Pass B.A. The Classical College Course 238 Honour Courses 239 Commerce 242\n\nviii\n\n180\n\n198\n\nHumanities 246 Social Sciences Sciences 253 Extension 254 16\n\n248\n\nProfessional Education in 1920 Theology 261 Law 264 Medicine 266 Engineering 269 Architecture 271 Forestry 272 Agriculture 275 Veterinary Medicine 282 Household Science 284 Dentistry 287 Pharmacy 291 Nursing 293 Social Work 294 Library Science 295 Teacher Training 296 Physical and Health Education Music 301\n\n259\n\n298\n\n17\n\nGraduate Studies 307 The Master's Degree 309 B.

Professor Robin Harris has pulled together from a mass of partial (in both senses of the word) sources the first history of Canadian universities as a whole. Not only is A History of Higher Education in Canada a pioneering work; it is also, and more important, a work that pioneers in the right place and in the right way. There are other first histories of higher education that might have been written. Valuable, lively books could have been written about the shifting composition and concerns of the student body, the relations between universities and the community or government, or the development of post-secondary education as a whole. Professor Harris has wisely chosen to describe the evolution of the university teaching curriculum and of research and scholarship. This choice permits him to focus his study on the very heart of the university, its teaching and research, and to base his work on the hardest data that exist on university offerings, the calendars. Future historians of Canadian universities can explore the many other facets of higher education that Professor Harris leaves largely untouched, confident that the core book has been written. Professor Harris sets out to test the hypothesis that Canadian higher education has characteristics that distinguish it from higher education in such countries as the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and France. He concludes that one can fairly answer 'yes' to the question, 'Is the Canadian university sui generis?' This is a remarkable proposition, when one considers that few approaches to higher education could have contrasted more sharply than those of English- and French-speaking Canada. Examining Professor Harris's evidence that a fundamental commonality has evolved among Canadian universities, after just over a century of co-existence, makes fascinating reading. So does following him in his arguments that what Canadian universities\n\nhave become is distinguishable (in non-trivial ways) from what universities have become in other lands. The Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada has every right to be gratified as a sponsor of this book, especially because the role that AUCC and its predecessors the National Conference of Canadian Universities and the National Conference of Canadian Universities and Colleges played in the development of higher education receives such extensive and careful treatment. Reflection on the importance of AUCC's role in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s, compared with its much more modest place in the Canadian university scene of the mid-1970s, tells a great deal about the direction that higher education has taken in Canada since the period covered by Professor Harris. For the moment, we will have to do this reflecting on our own, but we can look forward to more perceptive help from Professor Harris when he gives us his promised second volume covering the period 1961 to 1980. Professor Harris has served us well in giving the history of Canadian universities a shape and form, thereby rescuing it from the inchoateness of the local, the speculative, and often the anecdotal. We owe him much for the painstaking work that has produced a book of great value. M.K. Oliver 5 February 1976\n\nxiv\n\nPresident Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada\n\nPreface\n\nWhen in the late 1950s I began the research upon which this study is based, my intention was a comparatively simple one: to discover whether the Canadian university was an identifiable type of institution, one which whatever its size, age, or location had common characteristics that distinguished it from comparable universities in other countries, particularly in the English-speaking world. Much of the literature of higher education which I had read and many of the comments of my colleagues in common rooms and committee meetings suggested that the university in Canada was a rather pale carbon copy of the American or the British university. This struck me as nonsense. My own experience as a student and teacher at two universities of comparable size, Michigan and Toronto, indicated that the resemblances between an American and a Canadian institution were superficial, the differences fundamental; and my visits to and my reading of the histories of such pairs of institutions as Acadia and Amherst, Chicago and McGill, Michigan State and Manitoba supported my belief that the differences between Toronto and Michigan were typical rather than the exception to the rule. I recalled, too, that my visits to twelve English and Scottish universities in the summer of 1955 had left me with the impression that none bore striking resemblance to any of the thirty Canadian universities I had visited during the academic year 1951-52. Obviously, however, my experience was limited; the only way to resolve the issue was to make a detailed study of the Canadian universities and of the American, English, and Scottish as well. Subsequently I added the Australian universities to my list because, since higher education in Australia began at about the same time as in Canada and under similar influences, the opportunities for comparison and contrast seemed particularly inviting. Finally, since Canada is a bilingual nation and the influence of France on the FrenchCanadian institutions has been important, I felt I must also examine the universities of France. By this time I was contemplating\n\na clearly impossible task - the analysis of at least 1000 universities in half a dozen countries. Obviously, a more restricted plan had to be conceived. Although more modest in scope, the resulting study has still required fifteen years to complete. It encompasses a reasonably detailed description and analysis of what has been taught in Canadian universities since the first charter was granted in the early nineteenth century and of the opportunities available to the professors in these institutions to undertake scholarship and research. In consequence, it is both narrower and wider than the title may suggest. It is not a history of the Canadian universities; nor is it a history of post-secondary education in Canada. It includes no reference to the governance of universities, to questions of academic freedom or tenure, to the daily life of students and professors, to the extracurriculum (athletics, fraternities, student publications, etc.) or, except as these impinge directly on curriculum and research, to the financing of universities or to the relation of universities to government. It includes only incidental reference to the development of non-degreegranting post-secondary institutions, and no reference at all is made to the programs of study offered in such institutions. On the other hand, since it is concerned with the conditions that have encouraged or inhibited the undertaking of scholarship and research, considerable attention is paid to a substantial number of institutions, organizations, and government agencies which, though not directly related to any degree-granting university, have provided opportunities for professors to undertake research and scholarship which were not available in the universities themselves; examples are the Geological Survey of Canada, the Royal Canadian Institute, the Institut Canadien de Montréal, the Royal Society of Canada, the Dominion Experimental Farms, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Association Canadienne-Française pour l'avancement des science, the National Research Council, the Public Archives of Canada, the National Museum of Canada. The regulations of federal and provincial professional bodies such as the Law Society of Manitoba, the Canadian Medical Association, and the Chemical Institute of Canada have often affected the curriculum in the professional faculties of our universities; consequently there is considerable reference to them. This restriction, but equally this extension, of the range of institutional reference suggests that a more accurate title would be, 'A History of Higher Learning in Canada,' but I find 'higher learning' an awkward phrase, and I suspect that this title would prove more misleading than the one I have adopted. Furthermore, I am convinced that higher education is the proper term to use to refer to the essential functions which all universities are expected to perform. In a paper entitled 'A Matter of Balance,' presented at the 1967 Conference of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, I argued that universities have but two functions: the provision of instruction and the undertaking of research. The\n\nxvi\n\nclassic definition of the university is that it is an institution dedicated to the preservation, dissemination, and advancement of knowledge; but the first of these, the preservation of knowledge, is, in my view, simply the necessary prerequisite to the carrying out of the other two. It is the function of libraries, museums, and art galleries to preserve knowledge, and, while it is a convenience for universities to have such collections as part of their physical plant and essential that students and professors have ready access to them in order that the dissemination (instruction) and the advancement (research) of knowledge can be effectively pursued, it is not essential, particularly in an age of interlibrary loan and photocopying, that the institutions themselves act as repositories. The fact that recently the Royal Ontario Museum ceased to be an integral part of the University of Toronto has not in any fundamental way affected the instructional and research programs that are the university's raison d'être. Two other functions are frequently ascribed to universities: service to the community, and criticism of society itself. I would be the last to deny that universities not only should but always have made direct contributions to the welfare of the communities which support them, or to suggest that they have not frequently acted as a voice of conscience with respect to society's cultural, economic, political, and social development. But these are services (for criticism of society is a service) which the university performs by way of instruction and/or research. The incalculable benefits of the development of insulin are, in part, the consequence of a desire to serve society, but above all they are the result of research by identifiable individuals. The criticisms of contemporary society offered by Marshall McLuhan, George Grant, and Gérard Dion are grounded in their activities as teachers. It is possible, of course, for the functions of instruction and research to be carried on separately. The National Research Council of Canada is, among other things, a research institute, but as an organization it is not concerned with teaching. All elementary and secondary schools and many non-degree-granting educational institutions at the post-secondary level are concerned with teaching, but as organizations they are not expected to undertake research; this is not to say that a particular teacher in a high school or a community college may not on his own produce a work of significant research or scholarship. What distinguishes universities from public and elementary schools and from nondegree-granting post-secondary institutions is their commitment to undertake both functions and to regard them as interlocking and of equal importance. It will be noted that in the above paragraph the term teaching has been introduced as a synonym for instruction, and that scholarship has been equated with research. The latter equation poses no particular problem since it is common parlance in the academic world to describe scholarly work in the sciences as research, and comparable work in the humanities and social sciences as xv i i\n\nscholarship. What I am referring to in both cases is the disinterested pursuit of further knowledge — its advancement as distinct from its dissemination. The terms instruction and teaching do, however, pose a problem, not because they cannot be easily regarded as synonyms but because they tend to place undue emphasis on the role of the teacher or instructor as distinct from the role of the student. Ideally, the university teacher's commitment to the advancement of knowledge is not confined to his activities as scholar or researcher; it is reflected equally in the spirit with which he offers his instruction to his students whether at the undergraduate or graduate level. Similarly, a student, whether undergraduate or graduate, is regarded as a junior colleague of the professor, and, within the limits of his experience, he too is expected to discover as well as to absorb. This ideal has characterized the Canadian university scene from the outset, and in my view it and only it is the proper criterion by which the history of higher education in Canada must be judged. This book, then, is an examination of the development of teaching and research in the Canadian universities from the time of their origins in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries until 1960. So far as teaching is concerned, the basic data are the courses of study offered at any time by degree-granting institutions, but there are two important exceptions to this general rule. The first university charter was not granted until 1802 and the first degree was not awarded until 1807; however, as chapter 2 makes clear, university-level instruction was provided in French Canada during the late seventeenth and throughout the eighteenth century; the fact that degrees were not actually awarded has had to be disregarded at this stage. For essentially the same reason, the courses of study offered by professional schools in the years prior to their becoming associated with degree-granting institutions have been included if they were of university standard, as was the case, for example, at the Montreal Medical Institute for the six years prior to its transformation into the faculty of medicine of McGill University in 1829. My procedure has been to include all programs which in 1975 would have qualified the student for a degree. Thus, in the 1890 and 1920 divisions of the book there is reference to programs in physical and health education despite the fact that no Canadian university authorized a degree in this field until 1940. On the other hand, no reference is made at any point to chiropractic since no Canadian university has ever offered a degree in this field, even though there is a Canadian institution that for many years has offered a four-year program for which the admission requirement is the equivalent of university matriculation. The core of the book is a detailed description and analysis of the situation with respect to teaching and research in the Canadian universities at five points in time: 1860, 1890, 1920, 1940, 1960; for each of these years separate chapters are devoted to the programs in arts and science, professional education, and xviii\n\ngraduate studies (except for part I, I860), and to scholarship and research. The conclusions drawn in the final chapter are based on the evidence presented in all the preceding chapters and are essentially an attempt to answer the question that prompted me to undertake this study in 1958: are there characteristics which, as a result of their development over time, distinguish higher education in Canada from higher education in such countries as the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and France? Is the Canadian university sui generis\"! The dates established as the focal points of the study have been selected not arbitrarily or in the interests of symmetry but for very specific reasons. The year 1860 was chosen as the startingpoint because it was not until approximately this date that one could conscientiously describe the Canadian university as having characteristics which clearly differentiated it from institutions in the several countries that provided the models for its first half-dozen degree-granting institutions. Prior to 1850, the Canadian universities were simply transplants from England, Scotland, the United States, and France - the latter in the form of the classical colleges which in the 1860s would constitute the faculté des arts of Université Laval. But in the 1850s a number of significant developments occurred, notably the secularization of the universities of Toronto (1850) and New Brunswick (1859), the chartering of the first French-language university (Laval, 1852), and the assumption of the principalship of McGill University by J.W. Dawson (1855); the result was the emergence by 1860 of distinctively Canadian curricula. The Canadianization of the curricula was somewhat more pronounced by 1865, but with respect to both teaching and research the position in 1860 was not essentially different from that of 1870; it was, however, very different from that of 1850. The 1880s were marked by a general improvement in Canada's economic position and a consequent increase in the financial support of higher education, and this in part explains the choice of 1890 as the second focal point. The change was particularly evident at Dalhousie, McGill, and Queen's, where during the decade substantial private donations provided for the establishment of endowed chairs at all three institutions and at the latter two for the construction of several new buildings. There were other important developments of the 1880s. At Toronto, where a legislative act of 1853 had restricted the university's powers to the conducting of examinations and the granting of degrees (following the University of London model), a new act of 1887 authorized the university to become once again a teaching institution, and by 1890 it possessed fully operative faculties of arts, law, and medicine, and had affiliation arrangements with schools of agriculture, dentistry, and engineering. By 1890, the first of the provincial universities of the West, the University of Manitoba, had been established for thirteen years, and a branch of Université Laval had been operating in Montreal for fourteen years. The 1880s also saw for the first time the provision in certain institutions xix\n\nof adequate science laboratories, the emergence at Dalhousie of a distinguished law school, at McGill of a distinguished medical school, and at Toronto of a fully developed honours-course system. The founding of the Royal Society of Canada in 1882 provided for the first time a national organization designed to promote scholarship and research in all fields. An economic depression slackened progress in the 1890s, but the period 1900-14 was a reasonably buoyant one, largely because of heavy immigration, which not only transformed Montreal and Toronto from large towns into sizable cities but opened up the prairie provinces to settlement. Almost the first actions of the legislatures of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, which were created in 1905, were the establishment of provincial universities and, more important, the provision of adequate financial support for their construction and operation. However, development of all Canadian universities was checked by the outbreak of World War I, and it was not until 1920 that it could be said that any of them had settled back into a normal routine. The year 1920, then, is a third natural focal point. By this time, in Quebec, the branch of Laval at Montreal had become the completely independent Université de Montréal and for the first time the two large French-language institutions began to take serious steps to provide adequate instruction in the sciences. The fourth focal point, 1940, marks the effective entry of Canada into World War II, an experience with remarkable consequences for the nation's economy, but, more significant (and not unrelated), it marked the end of the Depression which throughout the 1930s had slowed development of the universities almost to a standstill. There had been progress during the 1920s, especially in the initiation of degree programs in a number of new professional fields - library science, nursing, and social work, for example; within the social sciences, the subjects of economics, history, and political science emerged as important disciplines, and, on a small scale, anthropology, geography, sociology, and psychology as well. In 1940, however, the general position with respect to both teaching and research was very similar to that of 1930, though substantially different from that of 1920. The 1940s were abnormal years for the Canadian universities, with enrolments much reduced during the war years and greatly inflated between 1945 and 1950 by the influx of veterans. The early 1950s represented a return to normalcy, but by 1955 it had become abundantly clear that demands for admission to higher studies across Canada would be enormously increased in the 1960s. The year 1960 has been selected as the final focal point because it represents the position of higher education in Canada immediately prior to the extraordinary expansion of the 1960s which, among other things, was characterized by the growing involvement of provincial governments in university affairs. The basic chapters in each of the five major divisons of the study are those devoted to a description of the curricula and to the\n\nxx\n\nconditions that facilitated or inhibited scholarly work. There is in each case a single chapter on scholarship and research but, in the treatment of the curricula, separate chapters are allocated to arts and science, professional education, and - except in 1860 when they were non-existent - graduate studies. Each division is introduced first by a chapter which sets the stage and second by one (or two in the case of 1860) which identifies the institutional characters. The stage-setting chapters centre on events symbolizing the state of higher education in Canada on or close to the dates chosen as focal points. In the case of 1860, the occasion is the visit of the Prince of Wales to the Canadian colonies, which provided an opportunity for the degree-granting institutions to state their current hopes and concerns through the briefs or memorials presented to the prince. For 1890 it is the annual meeting of the Royal Society of Canada, an occasion which, as had been the case since its formation eight years earlier, brought together presidents and professors from various institutions. For 1920, the event is the annual meeting of the National Conference of Canadian Universities, an organization whose membership included almost all degree-granting institutions from coast to coast. This body had first been convened in 1911, and in 1915 was formally established for the express purpose of discussing the problems of Canadian higher education. (It continues to hold annual meetings and is now known as the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada.) The symbolic occasion for 1940 is the 1939 Conference on Canadian-American Relations held at St Lawrence University in Canton, New York. It was attended by equal numbers of Canadian and American economists, historians, political scientists, journalists, and civil servants, and it indicated the growing importance of the social sciences and the increasing interaction between universities and government which had characterized Canadian higher education during the previous two decades. For 1960 two events have been selected: the special meetings of the National Conference of Canadian Universities and Colleges convened in 1956 and 1961 for the purpose of alerting the federal and provincial governments and the Canadian public to the grave financial crisis confronting the universities in their efforts to fulfil their responsibilities. Following the stage-setting chapter for each division is one which provides a description of the establishment and development of the individual institutions. There are two such chapters for the 1860 section, one devoted to the progress of higher education in French Canada, and the other describing the situation in English Canada. The comparable chapters in the subsequent divisions deal with developments since the previous focal point; for example between 1861 and 1890. In these 'institutional development' chapters, some reference is made to non-degree-granting postsecondary institutions and to the activities of the federal government in the field of higher education. Throughout this study, the description of the curricula offered xxi\n\nis based on the calendars of the institutions concerned. These have been examined closely not only for the five focal years but also for the two or three years immediately preceding and immediately following each focal year and at selected points in between. If, for example, a program in engineering appears in the 1890-91 calendar of University X but not in its calendar for 1860-61, the calendars have been checked back from 1890 to the year when the program was introduced. Similarly, when the program in engineering has undergone substantial change between focal years, the intervening calendars have been checked to record the sequence of changes. Calendars are legal documents and, in my view, they qualify as primary source material. However, they are statements of intent rather than of realization. The inclusion of a particular course in the 19AO-A1 calendar is no guarantee that the course was actually offered in that year, that it was taught by the professor listed, that the text or texts prescribed were actually studied, or that it met for precisely the number of weekly lectures, tutorials, or laboratory hours specified. Nor is the title or description of the course a clear indication of its content; in both cases brevity rather than accuracy is the prime consideration. Nonetheless, the listing of a course in a given calendar is prima facie evidence that the course was offered, that its content was in general terms that suggested by the title and description, and that it did bring together students and professors for the number of hours a week indicated. And if the same course was listed in precisely the same way for the previous and successive years, it is almost certain that it was in fact offered in the year in question. Calendars are particularly reliable in indicating what was not offered. The fact that the calendar of no Canadian university for the 1940-41 session included any course in Russian language and literature is evidence that this subject was not available for credit anywhere in Canada at that time. The study relies heavily on secondary source material with respect to the significance of current changes in particular subjects or fields. I am neither an anthropologist, a dentist, nor a physicist, and in these areas I have had to rely on what persons knowledgeable in these fields have written on this subject. What I have made a point of doing is to identify systematically and then to read what such experts have written. The evidence to support this last statement is provided in the approximately 12,000 entries which appear under such headings as anthropology, dentistry, and physics in the 1960 edition of A Bibliography of Higher Education in Canada, and in its 1965 and 1971 supplements, as well as in the first six issues of Stoa: The Canadian Journal of Higher Education which appeared between 1971 and 1974. I have not read every word of all these books, articles, and theses, but I have at least scanned 90 per cent of them. A History of Higher Education in Canada is a synthesis of the many strands that constitute the programs of instruction and research offered by Canadian universities as these have been initiated, xxii\n\ndeveloped, or discarded over more than three centuries. Although numerous studies of individual facets of the system have been published, none before has attempted to describe the total picture or to analyse the interrelationships among institutions throughout the various widely scattered and disparate regions of Canada. It is hoped that this publication, despite its unavoidable omissions and obvious limitations, will serve to close that gap and will provide researchers of higher education both in Canada and elsewhere with a pragmatic panoramic view of Canadian higher education as it took root and struggled to survive the hostile climate of the very early colonial period, gradually developing into the sophisticated system that exists today. I wish to express my thanks to the two organizations which enabled me to devote full time to the study for two academic years, the Canada Council, which awarded me a senior research fellowship in 1959-60, and the University of Toronto, which permitted me to take sabbatical leaves in 1959-60 and 1968-69. I also wish to acknowledge the assistance rendered to me since 1959 by the registrars, librarians, and archivists of all the Canadian universities who have been providing me with answers to specific questions on a variety of matters; to the students in my graduate classes since 1967, particularly Marni De Pencier and D. McCormack Smyth, who have been reacting critically to the drafts of the chapters as they have been successively produced; and to the following persons who have read and commented critically on specific sections of the manuscript dealing with areas about which they were particularly knowledgeable: Murray Barr, Faculty of Medicine, University of Western Ontario; Maxwell Cohen, Faculty of Law, McGill University; Marcel de Grandpré, Faculté des sciences de l'éducation, Université de Montréal; E.J. Fisher, School of Optometry, University of Waterloo; Claude Galarneau, Faculté des lettres, Université Laval; Jeffrey Holmes, Association of Atlantic Universities; Leopold Lanctot, University of Ottawa Press; the late Abbé Arthur Maheux, archiviste, Université Laval; Honoré Provost, Faculté de théologie, Université Laval; George Richardson, Faculty of Applied Science, Queen's University; Alexander Ross, University of Guelph; Murray G. Ross, York University; Stephen Stackpole, Carnegie Corporation of New York; Zoltan Zsigmund, Education, Science and Culture Division, Statistics Canada; and 28 of my colleagues at the University of Toronto: Margaret Allemang (nursing), A.D.

I am also indebted to Joan Bulger, Ian Montagnes, Gertrude Stevenson, and Ronald Schoeffel of the University of Toronto Press. My greatest debts are to Claude Bissell, Beverley Carter, Sheila Dutton, Patricia Harris, Muriel Kinney, and Gwendoline Pilkington. Miss Carter and Miss Kinney laboured for three years each in typing successive drafts of the manuscript and the latter made many other contributions as the manuscript approached completion. Mrs Dutton was responsible for checking sources and for organizing a manuscript suitable for presentation to the Press. Claude Bissell and Patricia Harris have been giving me encouragement and counsel for sixteen years and the latter has been heavily involved in the preparation of the bibliography and the index. Dr Pilkington has read in their entirety the final two drafts of the manuscript, and her detailed criticisms and suggested revisions have had the effect of reducing the work by at least 100 pages. So far as form as distinct from content is concerned, a strong case can be made for identifying her as co-author. This work is the seventh in the series, Studies in the History and Philosophy of Canadian Higher Education, initiated by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (then the National Conference of Canadian Universities) in 1957 and financed by a $25,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Its publication has been made possible by an additional substantial grant from the Carnegie Corporation and by a grant from the Social Science Research Council of Canada, using funds provided by the Canada Council. R.S.H.\n\nxxiv\n\n1860\n\nOur beginning is but humble, our hopes are in the future. L'Université Laval\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 The Royal Visit of 1860\n\nIn 1860 an eighteen-year old undergraduate interrupted his studies at Oxford University to make a four month tour of British North America, in the course of which he either visited or received briefs from a dozen universities or colleges. He was not, it must be admitted, a typical undergraduate - he was Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the British throne; and there is little evidence to suggest that the future Edward VII had any great interest in the state of higher education in Canada or anywhere else in the year 1860. The immediate purpose of his visit was to open a newly constructed railway bridge crossing the St Lawrence River at Montreal, which was to be named the Victoria Bridge after his mother, and this he did on 29 August. But the occasion was seized upon by the authorities in England as an opportunity for the people of the British colonies in North America to see their future king; consequently a tour was arranged which took the prince to the main centres in what are now the provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario. At the conclusion of the Canadian tour, he proceeded to the United States, where he visited Detroit, Chicago, St Louis, Cincinnati, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. The official account indicates that he was received with enthusiasm on both sides of the border.1 In Canada the tour was an occasion for the expression of loyalty to the British crown; this was its real purpose and the arrangements were designed with this objective in mind. At each centre there was a levée at which suitable addresses could be presented and a great variety of organizations availed themselves of this opportunity, among them the synod of the Presbyterian Church of Canada, the Raftsmen of the Upper Ottawa, the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, and the Temperance Reformation Society of Toronto. Also presenting addresses were a surprising number of universities and colleges, each of which in its address commented upon its present position and future prospects. For this reason the\n\nprince's tour provides a convenient point of departure for a survey of the state of higher education in Canada in the year 1860. Fittingly enough, the prince's introduction to Canadian higher education took place at Windsor, Nova Scotia, the seat of the University of King's College, the first institution outside the British Isles in what was to become the British Commonwealth to be granted a university charter. The address of the loyal inhabitants of the township of Windsor reminded the prince that Windsor was the oldest university town in Her Majesty's widely extended colonial possessions and the claim was made that King's College had educated in religion, in literature and science a great number of the clergy, many of the most distinguished members of the bench and bar in this and the neighbouring colonies, many military men, whose achievements having been widely celebrated, and several others, including members of the different religious denominations, especially conspicuous in the various walks of life, all of whom have ever maní fested the firmest allegiance to the British Throne and Government. The statement is embalmed in the imperialistic rhetoric characteristic of most of the addresses presented to the prince during the next several months, but it was nonetheless an accurate reflection of the King's College tradition as it had developed since the establishment of the college in 1790. King's College, Windsor, had been founded by United Empire Loyalists, men who had left the United States at the conclusion of the War of Independence in order to live out their lives as British subjects, and whose idea of a university was that of an Oxford or Cambridge college which like its models would be under the firm direction of the Church of England. In this latter respect, if in no other, the founders were successful; despite protestations to the contrary, King's had from the outset discouraged the enrolment of non-Anglicans, with the result that the other denominations, both Protestant and Catholic, had found it necessary to establish colleges of their own. Hence the enrolment at King's remained small and the curriculum was limited to offerings in arts and theology. A reorganization in 1853 had strengthened the college but at the time of the prince's visit it remained a rather pathetic colonial educational outpost. The next institution visited by the prince was one of the more recent establishments, Université Laval at Quebec, which had obtained its charter in 1852. In addressing the prince, the faculty were duly modest: 'It is true that unlike the Alma Mater, Oxford, where Your Highness has been pleased to matriculate, our existence cannot be counted by centuries - our alumni are but few, our libraries, our museums, our collections, offer nothing to excite the curiosity of Your Royal Highness, accustomed to visit the great and antique Institutions of Europe; our beginning is but humble - our hopes are in the future.'3 In comparison with\n\n4\n\nKing's, however, there was nothing at all humble about Laval in 1860. Its charter provided for four faculties, arts, law, medicine, and theology, and two of these had been organized almost immediately - medicine in 1853, law in 1854. Though technically not established until 1866, the faculty of theology was already in operation as the Séminaire de Québec, which had been providing instruction in theology since 1663. The faculty of arts was conceived of in the European tradition; it would offer instruction exclusively at the graduate level, preparation for the bachelor's degree being provided in affiliated collèges classiques, of which there were eight in operation in Lower Canada at the time the charter was granted. In the 1850s, there was not much demand in Lower Canada, or anywhere else in North America, for advanced work in arts and science. Nonetheless a start had been made towards developing an arts and science program: by 1860 professors had been appointed and courses offered in Canadian and American history (1856), chemistry (1857), physics (1859), and philosophy (1860). Nor were the physical facilities at Laval quite so humble as the address suggested. During the 1850s three buildings were constructed, a main building five stories high and 300 feet in length, a residence, and a building for the faculty of medicine, and it is worthy of note that there were no further buildings at Laval until 1912. A medical professor had been sent to Europe with $8000 to purchase books and apparatus. In 1860 the library of the Séminaire de Québec was in all probability the best in Canada. The prince also visited one of the collèges classiques, le Petit Séminaire de St Hyacinthe, founded in 1811. Here he was reminded that 'respect for authority, ... love of liberty ... and that public spirit which prompts men to devote themselves to the glory and prosperity of their country' are based on religious faith, which 'by sanctifying elevates all.' St Hyacinthe spoke for all colleges of the time, whether French or English, in asserting that 'by teaching our pupils to fear and honor God, we instruct them in the respect due to authority.'4 On the same day that he visited St Hyacinthe, the prince received an address from the University of Bishop's College, a Church of England foundation at nearby Lennoxville, whose objectives were the same as those of King's College, Windsor: 'As far as our limited means and opportunities will enable us, in these days of the infancy of our University, it will be our endeavour to promote sound learning and true religion amongst the inhabitants of this province, and to train up the rising generation in feelings of 5 affection for the mother country and loyalty to their Sovereign.' Opened in 1845 and chartered in 1853, Bishop's had struggled along with a tiny enrolment and a small and sometimes unpaid staff, offering instruction in arts and theology. A statement of 1857 reported that 'some of the subjects contained in this course are not yet sufficiently provided for, though they are not wholly neglected, such as History and Moral Philosophy, and Chemistry.'6 In 1860 four students were registered in theology and sixteen in arts.\n\n5\n\nOne phrase in the Bishop's College address may have sounded familiar to the prince since it echoed a sentiment he had heard at McGill College in Montreal two days earlier. McGill's royal charter, he had been told, 'gives authority to its public acts for the advancement of sound learning and science.'7 But there was a difference; it was sound learning and science which McGill was dedicated to advance and not, as at Bishop's, sound learning and true religion. The McGill charter of 1821 had been granted to a non-denominational institution, but Anglican and Presbyterian influences were dominant until 1852 when the charter was amended, a new board of governors constituted, and divinity removed from the list of subjects taught. A medical faculty had been instituted in 1829, but no instruction in arts was offered until 1844. Nor, according to McGill's first historian, did the addition of arts (or of law a few years later) signal any significant improvement. 'The nine years between 1846 and 1855 were years of continuous financial perplexity during which the governors had great difficulty in keeping the college in operation. There is little to record other than a discouraging battle with poverty and want.'8 But with the appointment of J.W. Dawson as principal in 1855 McGill was suddenly brought to life. When Dawson arrived in Montreal there were 57 students registered in medicine, 15 in law, and 38 in arts, but none of them had any particular reason to visit the McGill campus; in 1851 the faculty of medicine had moved from McGill College to a downtown building paid for by three members of its staff, and since 1852 the work in arts and law had been carried on in the top floor of the Montreal High School. By 1860 the enrolment had almost exactly doubled - 109 in medicine, 31 in law, 60 in arts - and the arts and law students were back on the campus. In addition, the McGill Normal School had been opened in 1857, a two-year diploma course in civil engineering was being offered in the faculty of arts, and a commercial course for young bankers and accountants was being provided in the late afternoons and evenings. There was an endowed chair of English Language and Literature (established in 1858), and by 1860 St Francis College at Richmond, an early and not long-surviving junior college, had entered into affiliation. In its address to the prince, McGill had insisted that as a university it was still in its infancy and 'could not bear comparison with the venerable institutions of a like nature in the mother country.1 Nonetheless, there was a justifiable note of confidence in the address. From Montreal the prince and his retinue moved westward into Upper Canada or Ontario as it would be called with the formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. (Legally the area known as Upper Canada from 1791 became Canada West in 1841, but Upper Canada continued to be the popular designation.) Here he had contact with six institutions. The first was the University of Queen's College at Kingston. It presented to him not an address but a University Ode. Queen's was a Presbyterian foundation which had obtained its charter in 1841 and had begun to offer instruction in March 1842. In 1844 it lost about two-thirds of its students and supporters\n\n6\n\nwhen, as a result of the duplication in Canada of the 1843 secession of the Free Church of Scotland from the Old Kirk, the Canadian Free Church Presbyterians established a college of their own at Toronto named after John Knox. Nevertheless, in 1850, despite its weak financial position, Queen's had made an important decision. Offered the opportunity to move to Toronto, where it would have been absorbed into the provincial university, it had decided to remain independent. In 1858 an Alma Mater Society was founded and in 1860 the government grant was increased from $3000 to $5000. These were surely auguries of better days to come. By this time there were faculties of arts, theology, and medicine, although the latter was independently financed. The total enrolment was 145 and there were hopes for future growth. However, the position of Queen's would remain precarious for many years. The prince's next stop was at Cobourg, a town midway between Kingston and Toronto, a strong centre of Methodism and the seat of the principal Methodist institution in Ontario, the University of Victoria College. Victoria had been established by the Methodists in 1832 as an academy or secondary school. In 1841 it attained degree-granting powers, and in 1845 it graduated the first student from Ontario to obtain a degree 'in course.'9 Both as an academy and as a liberal arts college Victoria advocated an academic course that gave due attention to the modern subjects, in contrast to the traditional emphasis elsewhere on the classics. A medical faculty was set up in 1854 but it was located in Toronto and its relationship to Victoria, like that of the medical faculty at Queen's, was nominal. There was no theology until the 1870s, and the faculty of law set up in 1862 was short-lived. Although in 1857 it was proposed that the college be moved to Hamilton, a town west of Toronto where the population growth was more promising, this plan was not acted upon and Victoria remained in Cobourg. But in 1889 it decided to join forces with the provincial University of Toronto, setting aside its degree-granting powers except in theology. The move took place in 1892. After Cobourg the prince next moved to Toronto where he visited two universities, a theological college, and a normal school. His first stop was at the University of Trinity College, a Church of England institution founded by Bishop John Strachan in 1852. On the occasion of his visit to Trinity he was assured that 'in discharging our duty we can propose to ourselves no better model than that of the ancient Universities of England. '•'-\" Presumably, the special needs of Trinity were also put to the prince by Bishop Strachan in private conversation, for on this occasion the prince's usual stereotyped reply to all such addresses included the statement, 'I know the difficulties under which you have laboured, and I sincerely hope that you may successfully surmount them. 11 The difficulties remained. In 1860 there were only 12 students in divinity and 20 in arts. Nor were the difficulties to be surmounted effectively until Trinity entered into federation with the University of Toronto in 1904. Trinity was actually the second university that Bishop Strachan\n\n7\n\nhad founded in Toronto, the first being King's College for which he had obtained a royal charter in 1827 but at which no instruction was offered until 1843. In theory a provincial university, King's College was in fact controlled by the Church of England, and dissatisfaction with that arrangement, which it was claimed discriminated against Presbyterians, Methodists, Roman Catholics, and Baptists, led to its abolition by the legislature as of 31 December 1849 and to the creation in its place on 1 January 1850 of a nondenominational University of Toronto. It had been in answer to this move that Strachan had gone to England in 1851 to obtain additional funds and a charter to set up a second Anglican institution, Trinity College, which in his words, 'fed by the heavenly stream of pure religion, may communicate fuel to the lamp of genius and enable it to burn with a brighter and purer flame.'12 The newly established University of Toronto which replaced King's College was a teaching institution with professorships in law, medicine, and arts. Divinity was specifically excluded. A new university act of 1853 reduced Toronto to a degree-granting university, but at the same time provided for a non-denominational arts college, University College. To it were transferred the professors of arts subjects at Toronto; thus there were now a council and members (undergraduates) of University College, but a senate and graduates of the University of Toronto. In a joint address before the prince it was explained that although 'framed as our system is upon the model of Institutions of our Mother country.' it is 'adapted in its details to the special wants of this portion of the Empire.'13 The 'system',' which already included the rough outline of the honour courses that in time would prove to be one of the great strengths of Canadian higher education, was indeed an adaptation of many models - London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Trinity College Dublin - and it was fitting that the institution should be housed in a building that continues to reflect most of the architectural possibilities known to man. But there was method in the mixing of the compound, and the method was grounded in an awareness that new conditions make necessary new solutions. At the time of the prince's visit, the University of Toronto was under attack (a select committee of the legislature was investigating its affairs), and there would be continual attack for many years to come. But, housed more adequately than it would be for at least a century to come, in possession of ample scholarship funds, and staffed by what was for the time a distinguished faculty, the University of Toronto in 1860 was firmly and permanently established. The prince visited only one of the three theological colleges located in Toronto at this time - Knox College, established in 1844 by the Free Presbyterian Church of Canada as an offshoot of the University of Queen's College, Kingston. Knox had begun by offering an arts course as well as theology, and by 1850 it was seriously considering applying to the legislature for a degreegranting charter; but the availability of an arts course at the\n\n8\n\nprovincial University of Toronto created in 1850 enabled Knox to abandon its ambitions in arts and to concentrate upon theology. The theological colleges which the prince did not visit were the Congregational College of British North America and St Michael's College. The former was established in 1841 and by 1860 had become residual legatee of collapsed congregational colleges opened at Montreal in 1843 and at Liverpool, Nova Scotia, in 1857; in 1864 it would be moved to Montreal and in 1865 would become an affiliate of McGill University. St Michael's College, primarily a Roman Catholic secondary school and only incidentally a seminary, had been founded in 1852 by Bishop Charbonnel and was under the direction of the Basilian fathers. It would eventually come under the degree-granting wing of the University of Toronto. From Toronto the prince's party proceeded through the western part of Upper Canada on its way to Detroit and the American portion of the tour. This included visits to Harvard, West Point, Girard College at Philadelphia, the Cooper Union, and the University of New York. Before crossing the border, the prince received at Woodstock an address from the Canadian Literary Institute, a Baptist foundation of 1860 which would evolve in 1890 into McMaster University, originally located in Toronto but after 1930 in Hamilton. He was informed that 'the institution which we represent is designed to impart a higher academic education both to male and female.'-^ This was one of two Canadian institutions in 1860 sufficiently forward-looking to offer education to young women. The other was Mount Allison College at Sackville, New Brunswick. The Prince of Wales may well have been impressed by the number of universities and colleges his Canadian tour revealed. Certainly he would not have encountered eight chartered institutions in a tour of England in 1860; but the surprising thing is that he could have visited five more degree-granting institutions and seven additional colleges which would become degree-granting in the course of time. Still another college, Assumption (Windsor), destined to become a university, had temporarily closed in 1859, and if the prince had returned in 1866 he would have been able to visit three more institutions which today are universities. By 1868, one year after Confederation, 18 Canadian colleges were authorized to grant degrees, and nine others which now enjoy that privilege were corporate entities. Two of the chartered institutions not visited by the prince were Roman Catholic institutions, Regiopolis College at Kingston and St Mary's College at Halifax. Though among the earliest Canadian colleges to obtain degree-granting powers (1837 and 1841 respectively) , they had little or no opportunity to exercise these powers during the nineteenth century. St Mary's is believed to have granted some degrees in 1843 and in some subsequent years until 1881 when, with the withdrawal of annual government grants to the denominational colleges of Nova Scotia, its activities were suspended for 22 years. Regiopolis was also receiving grants from the Upper Canada legislature from 1847 to 1868. It did not grant any degrees during these years, though two of its students are\n\n9\n\nknown to have received B.A.s from Université Laval in 1858. 15 At the time of the prince's visit, Regiopolis and St Mary's could be described either as small classical colleges offering some theological training or as small seminaries offering some parts of the classical course. Seven other Roman Catholic colleges which have since attained degree-granting powers could similarly be described; the Collège de Sherbrooke, which in 1954 provided a base for the Université de Sherbrooke; St Boniface College at St Boniface, in what is now the Province of Manitoba, a classical college opened in 1855, which in 1877 was one of the founding colleges of the University of Manitoba; St Francis Xavier College, founded in 1853 at Arichat, Nova Scotia, transferred to Antigonish in 1855, chartered in 1866; St Dunstan's College, founded at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in 1855, chartered in 1917 (though not granting degrees until 1941), absorbed within the University of Prince Edward Island in 1969; St Joseph's College at Memramcook, New Brunswick, founded in 1864, chartered in 1868, absorbed within the Université de Moncton in 1963; Assumption College at Windsor, Upper Canada, established by the Jesuits in 1857, closed in 1859, reopened by the Basilians in 1870, chartered as Assumption University in 1953, federated with the University of Windsor in 1963; and the College of Bytown, founded as Collège Saint-Joseph in 1848 and chartered as the University of Ottawa in 1866. Two of the six institutions still to be mentioned were inactive in 1860. Huron College at London, Upper Canada, from which the University of Western Ontario would evolve in due, if fitful, course, was not founded until 1863. Dalhousie University at Halifax had been chartered since 1818 and had offered an arts course briefly from 1838 to 1843 and even more briefly in the session 1857-58; it would reopen permanently with a highly qualified faculty of six in 1863. Of the institutions active in 1860 three were chartered and one was not. The latter was the Belleville Seminary at Belleville, Upper Canada, founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1857 and chartered in 1866 as Albert College. Albert is the only instance in the history of Canadian higher education of a teaching institution which, having gained university status, subsequently surrendered those powers willingly and irrevocably. ° After granting degrees in arts, law, music, and theology from 1867 to 1883, it reverted to the status of a secondary school in accordance with the terms of the 1884 union of the several Methodist churches. The three chartered institutions the prince did not visit were in what are now the Maritime provinces - the University of New Brunswick at Fredericton, Mount Allison Wesleyan College at Sackville, N.B., and Acadia College at Wolfville, Nova Scotia. The charter under which the University of New Brunswick was operating in 1860 was the third granted to the institution at Fredericton. The first was granted by the Province of New Brunswick to the College of New Brunswick in 1800, but no instruction was offered beyond the secondary level until the 1820s. In 1828 a royal charter\n\n10\n\nwas granted to what was then called King's College, New Brunswick. Despite the presence on the staff of some of the ablest professors of the day, the college had a difficult history until its reorganization in 1859, at which time, following the recommendations of a royal commission in 1854, it was rechartered by the province as the non-denominational state-supported University of New Brunswick. Theology was no longer to be taught, and a clergyman could no longer occupy the position of president. With the assumption of the presidency by William Brydone Jack, professor of mathematics and philosophy since 18AO, the University of New Brunswick was in a position to move steadily if unspectacularly forward. Acadia and Mount Allison were established by the Baptists and the Methodists respectively because the existing colleges in the Maritime colonies did not meet the needs of the denominations. Acadia's establishment was the consequence of dissatisfaction first with King's College, Windsor, and then with Dalhousie. The decision to found it was made in 1838 when a well-qualified Baptist candidate was not appointed to one of the chairs of the about to be opened Dalhousie. Starting in 1839, its survival to 1860 is a remarkable story of triumph over adversity to which we shall have occasion to refer in chapter 3. It faced a serious financial crisis in 1858, but in 1860, largely through the stabilizing influence of its president, the Rev. J.M. Cramp, its principal difficulties appeared to have been overcome. Mount Allison's prospects seemed even more promising. Founded on the basis of the offer by Charles Allison of a building and £100 annually for ten years to support 'a school in which not only the elementary but the higher branches of education may be taught,' Mount Allison had begun as an academy or secondary school for young men in 18A3. To this was added in 1848 a Female Academy, also through the generosity of Charles Allison. A charter for Mount Allison Wesleyan College was obtained in 1858. The instruction provided in 1860 was a strange mixture of work in primary, intermediate, classical, and collegiate departments and included (for the ladies) music and fine arts. A Token of Merit granted to the lady graduates since 1857 was replaced in 1863 by the diploma, Mistress of Liberal Arts. In 1875 Grace Lockhart, M.L.A. 1874, received the first bachelor's degree granted to a woman by a university in what was then known as the British Empire. In summary, the position of higher education in Canada in 1860 can be thus described. In the Maritimes, four chartered institutions were in full operation (King's College; Windsor; the University of New Brunswick; Acadia College; and Mount Allison Wesleyan College), a fifth (Dalhousie) was about to establish itself permanently, and a sixth (St Mary's) existed at least on paper. Two other colleges (St Francis Xavier and St Dunstan's) were in operation and a third (St Joseph's) would be added to the list in 1864. There was also a Presbyterian theological college (Pine Hill) at Halifax,17 and a Church of England Theological College (Queen's) at St John's, Newfoundland., 18 in Lower Canada (Quebec) there were three chartered institutions, Bishop's and McGill for English-speaking 11\n\nstudents, and Laval for French-speaking students, the baccalaureate program for the latter being provided by nine collèges classiques. In Upper Canada (Ontario) four institutions were chartered (Queen's, Toronto, Trinity, Victoria); five others which had offered, were offering, or would offer undergraduate instruction had corporate existence (Albert, McMaster, Ottawa, Regiopolis, St Michael's); one (Assumption) had temporarily suspended activities; and one (Western Ontario) would be established shortly. Knox College and the Congregational College of British North America confined themselves to theology. In the West, one of the constituent colleges of the future University of Manitoba (St Boniface) operated as a classical college. This was the picture in 1860. Before turning to a consideration of what was being studied in these colleges and universities, we shall in the following two chapters review in more detail the history of their establishment and the course of their development to the year 1860.

In its early years, however, the Jesuit college was essentially an elementary school (petite école) where the children of the colonists (who in 1635 numbered fewer than 500) and of native Indians could learn the three Rs.^ It is true that Latin was taught in 1636 and possibly in 1635, and that it continued to be taught without apparent interruption and presumably at an increasingly higher level for the next 15 years. In 1651 the 22 students at the college, including those at the elementary level, were taught by two professors, one of Latin and one of mathematics. Gosselin has reported that four years later there were four professors, one for the petite école, one for 'grammaire,' one for 'humanités' and 'rhétorique,' and one for 'philosophie',2 thus suggesting that by this time both of the major divisions of the classical college course, lettres (embracing grammaire, belles lettres, rhétorique) and philosophie (embracing philosophie, sciences, .mathématique) were being offered, though in contrast to the contemporary situation in France on a somewhat reduced basis. But it is possible, as Audet argues, that the professor of philosophy of 1655 was the professor of mathematics of 1651, and that the program offered in 1655 extended only so far as lettres. It is clear, however, that philosophy as prescribed in the Ratio Studiorum was taught at the Jesuit college in 1659; this was the year when Mgr François de Laval arrived to assume his duties as the first bishop of New France. He was sufficiently impressed with the work being done at the college to request that the Jesuits also offer instruction 3 in theology, for which the work in philosophy would be prerequisite.\" Theology was introduced at the college in 1661 but two years later Laval established le Grand Séminaire de Québec, which gradually\n\nassumed responsibility for this professional work. Nonetheless, the relation between the college and the seminary remained close throughout the French régime and on frequent occasions Jesuit professors offered instruction in theology at the latter.4 In addition, Bishop Laval established a Petit Séminaire in association with the Grand Séminaire in 1668 as a residence for potential seminarians while they were taking the classical college course at the Jesuit college. A century later the Petit Séminaire took over responsibility for the full classical college course when the Jesuit college was forced to close down by the British authorities following the conquest. But during the French Regime the instruction it offered was confined to preparing students for admission to the Jesuit college. The availability by the 1660s of the full classical college course at the Jesuit college and of professional instruction in theology at the Grand Séminaire is evidence that higher education in Canada has a history of at least 300 years. By 1700 Greek had been introduced into the classical college course and the course itself expanded to a seven year syllabus with five years for the cours de lettres (three years of grammaire, one each of humanités and rhétorique) and two for philosophie. This syllabus remained in effect for the balance of the French régime. Periodically during the century before 1760, écoles latines were established in various other centres, including Montreal, but only the Jesuit college at Quebec offered the complete classical course, and this was not always possible. In 1728 a petition to found a second Jesuit college in Montreal was rejected by the authorities at Quebec and Paris, Intendant Dupuy arguing that since the course at Quebec was incomplete this was hardly the time to organize a second college.5 In addition to the theological training provided at the seminary, there were other efforts to provide specialized training during the French régime, and some of these contained at least the elements of higher education. By around 1670, Bishop Laval's awareness that the classical college course was not suitable to all the intelligent youth of the colony led him to establish at St Joachim near Quebec a trade school (l'école d'arts et métiers) where attention was given to agriculture, painting, sculpture, stone-masonry, and carpentry. A similar program was offered for the first two decades of the eighteenth century at a school in Montreal.*> The inclusion of mathematics in the final two years of the classical college course led to the establishment at Quebec of a school for the training of pilots and surveyors - l'école d'hydrographie.' This work was carried on with the aid of a government grant, initially by a series of laymen who were attached to the Jesuit college with the title of professeur d'hydrographie, but from 1709 until the outbreak of the Seven Years' War by the Jesuits themselves. The same kind of training was offered for a time at Montreal. In a letter of 20 September 1694 Père Chauchetière, a Jesuit teaching at an école latine, declared: 'J'ai des écholiers qui sont bons 15\n\ncinquiésmes, mais j'en ay d'autres qui ont la barbe au menton aux quelles j'apprends la marine et les fortifications et autre choses de mathématiques.'^ But as Gosselin has noted, neither les écoles d'arts et de métiers nor les écoles d'hydrographie can be described as 'l'instruction supérieure.' The aim was to produce not engineers or agriculturists but efficient mariners, skilled farmers,\n\nand 'de bons et honnêtes artisans.\n\nGroulx has pointed out that, the church excepted, the professions were effectively closed to the native-born and that such opportunities as were available to the young Canadien required little advanced training.-'-\" Gosselin, whose L'Instruction au Canada sous le regime français is a detailed and wide-ranging study, records no effort to provide professional education in medicine and law. It is known, however, that lectures on jurisprudence and on Roman, civil, and criminal law were given once or twice a week at Quebec by M.-B. Collet and L.G. Verrier, who occupied the position of procureur général of New France for the periods 1712-27 and 1727-58 respectively.-'--'- There were also attempts to provide formal training for school teachers, most notably by the Frères Hospitaliers de la Croix et de Saint-Joseph (Frères Charon) during the first two decades of the eighteenth century, but such ventures failed to attain permanence owing to inadequate official support. 12 It should be remembered that even at the time of the conquest the population of French Canada was under 60,000. During the first 20 years of the British regime, from 1763 to the beginning of Dorchester's second term as governor in 1786, the situation deteriorated. The Jesuit college at Quebec suspended its activities between 1759 and 1761 and ceased operating in 1768. In 1758 the Séminaire de Québec closed its doors but reopened in 1763; and in 1768, with the closing of the Jesuit college, the Petit Séminaire took on the responsibility for providing the full classical course. A second classical course was offered by the Sulpicians at Montreal in 1773 - Collège St Raphaël, renamed Collège de Montréal in 1806 but often referred to, both before and since, as the Petit Séminaire de Montréal; but until 1790 it offered only the cours de lettres, the student going to the Petit Séminaire at Quebec for the cours de philosophie. During this depressed period the idea for a university for French Canada was first proposed. In 1770 a petition claiming to speak for the citizens of Quebec, Montreal, and Trois-Riviëres was presented to the governor, asking that a Royal George College be established at which languages, philosophy, mathematics, engineering, navigation, and civil law would be taught, as well as 'tous les arts et toutes les sciences humaines qui rendentT Q l'homme utile à la société et qui font l'honneur d'une nation.'-1-3 Though it was suggested that such an institution would be of benefit to other British colonies and even to the mother country itself (the French language, it was pointed out, could be learned in a 'friendly' country), the question was not seriously considered by the authorities in London and permission was not granted to obtain in France the services of the six professors required. 16\n\nThe incident reflects the atmosphere of the time - the brave hopes of the French Canadians, the grave doubts of the British authorities. The Roman Catholic church was officially recognized by the Quebec Act of 1774, but for the previous decade it had been British policy to discourage the Roman religion by encouraging the Protestant. An obvious way to implement such a policy was to establish Protestant schools, and the instructions issued to Governor Murray in 1763 directed him to give all possible encouragement to the construction of Protestant schools and all possible assistance to the maintenance of Protestant schoolmasters. There was active discouragement of Roman Catholicism particularly in the 1760s. The Jesuits and Récollets were forbidden to recruit additional members, all teaching orders were viewed with suspicion, and a steady decline in the number of active priests meant that fewer and fewer were available for teaching duties. Since the Roman Catholic church had been the motivating force behind all teaching efforts in French-speaking Canada for over a century, it is not surprising that in this antagonistic atmosphere education made virtually no progress. By the mid-1780s a new attitude prevailed. Shortly after the reappointment of Sir Guy Carleton (later Lord Dorchester) as governor-in-chief of British North America, a special committee of the legislative council under the chairmanship of Chief Justice William Smith, was appointed to report on the Means for Promoting Education. Its recommendations, published in 1790, called for free parish or village schools for the teaching of the three Rs, free schools at each county town for the teaching of arithmetic, languages, grammar, bookkeeping, navigation, surveying, and the practical branches of mathematics, and 'a collegiate institution, for cultivating the liberal arts and sciences usually taught in ., the European Universities - the Theology of Christians excepted.' It is a scheme remarkably similar to Jefferson's famous proposal for the State of Virginia in 1779. According to L.-P. Audet.^5 the exclusion of theology was the governor's idea and was based less on adherence to any principle than on the practical consideration that the inclusion of theology would require provision for at least two faculties of theology since the institution was to be equally available to Roman Catholics and Protestants. However, the phrasing of the committee's report suggests recognition of the principle that a university ought to be free of any external pressures: 'It is essential to the origin and success of such an institution, that a society be incorporated for the purpose; and that the charter wisely provide against the perversion of the instruction to any sectarian peculiarities; leaving free scope for cultivating the general circle of the sciences.'16 On the other hand, a letter of the governor of 10 November 1790 makes it clear that the whole educational system, of which the university, as with Jefferson's scheme, would be the capstone, was to be controlled by the state itself: 'It will be very material so to organize and endow this institution that the inferior schools ... may be subordinate to its government, and in some measure dependent upon it for support, so that the whole system 17\n\nmay be animated by one common principle, under the eye and control of the crown.'I' Initially, the proposal to establish a state-supported university in the old French colony seemed likely to be implemented. It received enthusiastic support from the coadjutor bishop of Quebec, Mgr Bailly de Messein, who at an earlier period in his career had been tutor to the governor's children. It also appeared to receive more tangible support from a prominent Montreal lawyer, Simon Sanguinet, whose will, drawn up a few days before his death on 16 March 1790, assigned two-thirds of an estate valued roughly at $15,000 for the founding of such a university. A copy of the Smith Committee Report was on his bed at the time the will was being prepared. The announcement of Sanguinet1s bequest inspired a petition supporting the committee's recommendation that a Université de la Province de Québec be established. The document was submitted to the governor on 31 October 1790 by 115 prominent citizens of both French and English extraction and of both Roman Catholic and Protestant persuasion. Despite this strong affirmation, the scheme aborted. Audet suspects that it was temporarily shelved pending the announcement of the terms of what proved to be the Constitutional Act of 1791 which created the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and that having been thus set aside, it was never seriously reconsidered. A simpler explanation put forth by Audet is that the bishop of Quebec, Mgr Hubert, supported the idea in principle but strongly objected to it in practice. This is borne out in a letter dated 18 November 1789 from the bishop in response to the Smith Committee's request for factual information about the school situation in the colony. His surface objections to the proposal were that he did not believe that the habitant population were ready for such an institution, and, indeed, would not be prepared to send their sons to it. His rationale was: II est fort douteux que la Province puisse fournir présentement un nombre suffisant d'Ecoliers pour occuper les Maîtres et Professeurs que l'on mettroit dans une Université. D'abord tant qu'il y aura beaucoup de terres à défricher en Canada, on ne doit pas attendre que les habitants des campagnes soient curieux des arts libéraux. Un cultivateur aisé qui désirera laisser un bon héritage à ses enfants, aimera mieux communément les appliquer à l'Agriculture et employer son argent à leur acheter des fonds, qu'à leur procurer des connoissances dont il ne connoit pas, et dont il n'est guère possible qu'il connoisse le prix. Tous les pays du monde ont successivement donné des preuves de ce que j'avance, les sciences n'y avant fleuri que quand il s'y est trouvé plus d'habitants qu'il n'en falloit pour la culture des terres. Or ceci n'a pas encore lieu en Canada, pays immense dont les terres peu avancées offrent de toutes parts de quoi exercer l'industrie et piquer l'intérêt de ses Colons. Les villes seroient donc les seules qui puissent fournir des sujets à l'Université. Il y a quatre villes dans la Province: une 18\n\nWilliam Henri, qui est encore déserte; une autre, les Trois Rivières, qui mériteroit à peine le nom de bourg. Restent Québec et Montréal, dont le peuple comme l'on sait, n'est pas fort nombreux. En outre, est-il probable, attendu la rareté actuelle de l'argent et la pauvreté des citoyens, que Montréal puisse envoyer un grand nombre de sujets à l'Université? Tous les deux ans une dizaine ou douzaine d'écoliers de Montréal sont envoyés ici pour étudier la Philosophie. Il n'en faut pas davantage pour faire murmurer toute leur ville. Plusieurs, faute de moyens suffisants, sont contraints de borner à la Rhétorique finie le cours de leurs études. Néanmoins le Séminaire de Québec donne gratuitement ses instructions sur la Philosophie comme sur les autres sciences, et la plus forte pension alimentaire qu'il exige d'un Ecolier ne monte jamais à 12 liv. sterling par an. Je concluerois de tout cela que le 18 moment n'est pas encore venu de fonder une Université à Québec. The bishop's more fundamental objection, however, rested on the grounds that there was no guarantee that the church would have any control over the institution, and for this stance he was to receive the full support of Rome: 'vous avez très bien fait d'avoir résisté à la fondation de cette université dans laquelle la tolérance des sectes hétérodoxes aurait servi de base.'19 By 1790, the British authorities were not likely to proceed in opposition to the wishes of the unofficial leader of His Majesty's French-Canadian subjects, and it is therefore not surprising that a Université de la Province de Québec was not established at that time. Bishop Hubert, however, strongly favoured increased support for the institutions that were already in existence and were, of course, under his control. Generally speaking, he claimed, the young scholars were capable at the time they finished their studies of embracing with success 'any kind of science taught at a university, whether Jurisprudence, Physics, Surgery, Navigation or Fortification.' If a third institution were to be established, it should confine itself to classics, civil law, navigation, and the mathematics currently taught at the Petit Séminaire. This view was essentially in harmony with a proposal put forward by the Sulpicians in 1790 - that they establish at Montreal a College Dorchester (Collège Clarence was also suggested in honour of one of George Ill's sons) at which would be offered English, French, Latin, belles lettres, philosophy, mathematics in their special branches, especially navigation, surveying, and engineering, and, when circumstances permit, civil law, and the other sciences which would prove most useful to the needs of the province.20 Such an institution would doubtless have meant an expansion of the existing Sulpician college at Montreal rather than the addition of a third institution. The possibility that a university might thus be provided without substantial cost to the government provides a further explanation for the collapse of the movement to found a French-language university in the eighteenth century. 19\n\nUnfortunately, the Sulpicians lacked the financial resources to establish such a university; their petition had been based on the assumption that they would have access to the revenues of their estates which, along with those of the Jesuits, had been confiscated by the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1763. The petition was tabled pending settlement of this very question, which was not resolved until 1889. Consequently, nothing was done, and for the next half-century, i.e., until the 1840s, there is little to record in the development of higher education in French Canada except the gradual strengthening of the two existing classical colleges - those at Quebec and Montreal - and the founding of five other classical colleges which were solidly established by 1860: Nicolet (1803), St-Hyacinthe (1811), Ste-Thérèse-de-Blainville 21 (1825), Ste-Anne-de-la-Pocatière (1827) and L'Assomption (1832). Three other colleges were founded during this period but did not survive - Collège St-Denis-sur-Richelieu (1805-11), Collège de St Roch (1818-30), and Collège de Chambly (1825-57). In all cases the new colleges were established through the initiative of a parish priest, but also - and particularly in the case of those that were successful - with the enthusiastic and tangible support of one or other of the bishops. The latter, individually and collectively, saw in the establishment of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning (1801) and in the subsequent efforts to establish McGill University and a network of Protestant high schools a threat to the language, religion, and culture of French Canada. They therefore urged their clergy to organize écoles paroissiales and they devoted time and money to strengthening the collèges. The latter were quite independent of one another, but they developed academically and administratively on similar lines; this was to be expected since the classical course had long been clearly defined, the faculty were all clerics, and the great majority of the faculty either had been trained or were still in the process of being trained at the Séminaire de Québec. Until well past 1860, the majority of teachers in the classical colleges were seminarians young men who interrupted their studies for a year or two to teach at one of the colleges and who in their spare time carried on their theological studies under the direction of the priests in charge of their college. The beginnings of a new order became apparent in the 1830s. It was at this time that the Abbé John Holmes introduced Greek at the Petit Séminaire de Québec and gave increased and enlivened attention in the classical course to geography, history, natural history, and the physical sciences, innovations which would be accepted in all the colleges in due course. During the 1830s, too, an elementary school system was beginning to take form, the consequence of the authorization of écoles de fabrique in 1824 and of the 1829 Act for the Encouragement of Elementary Education. Increased enrolments called attention to the need for teacher training, and, partly through John Holmes's efforts, a normal school was established in 1837. But at this point the troubles attendant on the Rebellion of 1837 postponed further progress. Indeed, there was 20\n\nretrogression, for the normal school, which was almost immediately in difficulties, was closed in 1842. The very different atmosphere of the 1840s was in considerable measure the result of the Act of Union of 1840, which reunited the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. In the field of education, the uniting of the provinces was a great advantage to those who sought improvement in French Canada; in a number of respects Upper Canada was more advanced, and it was now possible to insist upon measures that would produce parity. Thus, the Common School Bill of 1846 establishing free schools in Upper Canada was matched by an act of the same year giving Lower Canada a system of statesupported confessional schools. Since a solution to the problem of elementary schooling which French Canadians had been seeking since 1791 had now apparently been achieved, it was possible to turn attention to the expansion of the system at the secondary and tertiary levels. As we shall see, a considerable number of new colleges were founded between 1846 and 1860, and in 1852 the charter for Laval University was obtained. There was one additional factor which explains the changed atmosphere of the 1840s and 1850s - the arrival in Canada of a number of religious orders: the Christian Brothers in 1837, the Oblate fathers in 1841, the Jesuits in 1842, the Clerics of St Viator and the Congregation of the Holy Cross in 1847, the Basilians in 1852. Of these the Clerics of St Viator were particularly active in Lower Canada; soon they were providing the teaching staff for newly established colleges at Joliette (1846), Rigaud (1850), Verchères (1854), and Longueuil (1855). The educational efforts of the Jesuits were initially concentrated at Montreal where they founded Collège Ste Marie in 1849. By 1852 this college was offering lectures in law in addition to the classical course. Collège Ste-Marie followed the usual pattern of beginning with the class in elements and adding an additional year of the classical course each September until the full program was available. It was recognized as a classical college from the outset. In contrast, all four of the colleges with which the Clerics of St Viator became associated were known officialy as 'collèges industriels.' The term 'classical college' was restricted to those institutions whose chief concern was the offering of the traditional classical college course.22 The fact that such a college also offered a 'commercial' course of shorter duration and with more practical aims did not disqualify it from being so classified and therefore of being eligible for the government grant which colleges of this type were authorized to receive by virtue of a law passed in 1846. The same law provided for grants to the collèges industriels, but the amount was approximately half that assigned to the classical colleges. According to P.-J.-O. Chauveau, who became superintendent of public instruction for Lower Canada in 1855, a few of the collèges industriels listed in 1860 had been established with the intention of becoming classical colleges, but the majority were designed to fill a gap in the educational system of the province by providing an alternative form of education for 21\n\nyoung men to prepare them directly for business and industry rather than for the traditional liberal professions of law, medicine, and theology.23 Unfortunately, though supported by public funds, these institutions were not under direct government control, and they tended to adopt the same program as that of the classical colleges, partly because the latter would entitle them to receive the larger government grant. By the 1870s there was little to distinguish the two types of college. But for our purposes the expansion of what in the final analysis was largely secondary education was of lesser importance than the movement, begun in the late 1840s, to establish a French-speaking university. This dream had haunted French Canada since 1770: Groulx has cited evidence of such a proposal in 1830, 1831, 1836, 1837, 1845, and 1848.2¿* This time the proposal resulted in attention. The initial stimulus derived from certain members of Séminaire de Québec, notably John Holmes, Jerome Demers, and L.J. Casault, the supérieur. The interest of Archbishop Turgeon of Quebec and of Bishop Bourget of Montreal was demonstrated between 1850 and 1852. In March 1852, Casault reported that the staff of the séminaire was prepared to proceed if the bishops judged this to be in the interests of religion. It was so judged, and Casault proceeded, with the support of the governor general, to obtain a civil charter on 9 August. In March 1853 Rome granted 'les pouvoirs ordinaires d'une université catholique' the power to confer degrees in theology being vested not in the university but in the archbishop of Quebec. All the Roman Catholic bishops of Canada immediately issued pastoral letters supporting 'cette oeuvre nationale et religieuse.' The original idea was to establish a single university for the province in which all or nearly all the colleges would play a part, the séminaire at the head but the others full members. Holmes, for one, was doubtful; quite aside from the likelihood of legitimate differences of opinion about the curricula and the practical problems of arranging regular meetings of a council drawn from many centres at a time when mechanized transportation was still in its infancy, the difficulties currently being experienced in Upper Canada by the University of Toronto in its relations with Queen's, Victoria, and Regiopolis raised questions about the effectiveness of a federation scheme. In consequence, the university was founded and financed by the séminaire alone, the name carefully selected to imply neither provincial jurisdiction nor identification with any particular diocese or district. Proposed terms for affiliation were soon forwarded to all the bishops for transmission to the colleges of their dioceses. The replies were by no means unanimously favourable and nearly ten years of debate ensued before any colleges were affiliated.. But in 1855 Laval announced that it would recognize the graduates of L'Assomption, Nicolet, Ste-Thérèse, St-Hyacinthe, Collège Ste-Marie, and Collège de Montréal, as well as of its own Petit Séminaire as eligible for being granted the B.A. degree.\n\n22\n\nThe University was to consist of the traditional four faculties arts, law, medicine, theology. Law and medicine were the new departures: 'It is with feelings of deep pain,' admitted Archbishop Turgeon in his pastoral letter of 1852, 'that we have seen our Catholic youth obliged to pass into foreign countries, either to procure academical honours or to follow up the study of medicine or jurisprudence.' But there was no reference to agriculture, to engineering, or to the training of teachers: a university training was not thought to be needed for technological, industrial, or pedagogical pursuits. Nor in contrast to the project of 1790, was there any desire to assume the posture of a state university. Laval would not be all things to all men: its emphasis would be on unity, not on diversity.
