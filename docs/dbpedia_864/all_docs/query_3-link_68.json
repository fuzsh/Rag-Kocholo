        "text": "In 1987, the Rare Books and Special Collections Department acquired a collection of British plays. This purchase was a unique opportunity to broaden the already strong holdings in British theater of the Department. A list of the items in this collection -- alphabetized by playwright -- is below, and the entire collection is cataloged and accessible for research.\n\nThe collection features plays written between 1900 and 1980 by playwrights from the United Kingdom. Although it contains the work of many of the twentieth century's most recognizable playwrights,among them Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Edward Bond, and J.B. Priestley, it uniquely focuses more on emerging or amateur playwrights throughout the century, who were either publishing and staging their first plays or writing for small theater companies with limited resources performing primarily for local audiences. Inclusion of plays from the Methuen Modern Plays series, for example, highlights playwrights whose work enjoyed commercial success but had not gained a large readership prior to the time of publication.\n\nComplementing this emphasis on young playwrights, a large number of one-act plays, many written for local town or village productions, showcase amateur playwrights and often fall into one of the following categories: \"Scots\" plays, all-female cast productions, and nativity plays.\n\nAs a whole, the collection emphasizes the limits and possibilities of performance rather than the play as merely text, as evidenced by the number of texts that are acting editions, some of which have been notated during a previous rehearsal process. Because of this emphasis on emerging playwrights and one-act plays, the British Plays Collection will be especially useful for those interested in or working on lesser-known playwrights of the twentieth century and plays intended for local production rather than the London stage.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: These plays are still under copyright and we cannot provide photocopies of them. Please contact the publishers for permission to rent, perform or duplicate, etc.\n\nABBENSETTS (Michael)\n\nSweet Talk. (Methuen Playscript). EM. 1974\n\nABERNETHY (Margaret)\n\nEdge of Doom.
