        "text": "NEWS RELEASE\n\nCENTRAL UNITED CHURCH\n\n********************* Central United Church will be marking 100 years at the corner of Spring and Albert Streets Sunday September 24, 2006.\n\nWhile the planning and building of the current Central United Church happened over several years, the opening of the main sanctuary and the installation of the massive pipe organ in the church both occurred in 1906 and these events are being commemorated at a special service at 10:30 Sunday morning. The Choir of Central United Church directed by Paul Dingle will be joined by the Emmanuel United Church Choir as well as the Algoma Conservatory Advanced Choir conducted by Agnes McCarthy and featuring soloist Reilly Nelson.\n\nAlso the congregation of Emmanuel United Church will be worshiping at Central this week to mark the occasion. The Central congregation dates back to 1851 when Rev. George McDougall began missionary work among the Indians at Garden River.\n\nFrom there, Rev. McDougall, and those who followed, were responsible for the growing Methodist congregation in Sault Ste. Marie and area.\n\nBefore 1906, Central held its services everywhere from what is now the Ermatinger Old Stone House to the courthouse at the home of Sherriff W. H. Carney.\n\nWhen there was no minister, the sheriff would take the service himself.\n\nIn 1870, the congregation moved into a frame building on the northeast corner of Pim and Queen streets. In 1897, the Central Methodist Church congregation purchased the land at the present church site at the corner of Spring and Albert streets for $700. A building committee which included future Ontario Premier W. H. Hearst was established in February of 1897.\n\nThey called on six architects to submit plans for a church with a seating capacity of 450 on the ground floor.\n\nThe building was also to include galleries.\n\nTotal cost of the building was not to exceed $7,500. In November, 1900, arrangements were made to sell the existing church on Pim and Wellington to W.H. Plummer for $2,200.\n\nThe building was then transferred to the Public School Board. In March 1901 the parsonage on Church Street was also put up for sale and George Stone purchased it later that year for $1500. A committee was then established to arrange for plans for a new Parsonage. James Thomson, a Sault Ste. Marie architect was chosen.\n\nThe parsonage was to be located on the plot of land previously donated by F. H. Clergue.\n\nHowever, it took two calls for tenders before the contract for construction of the parsonage was awarded to Mr. A. C. McLeod on July 8, 1901.\n\nThe new parsonage was ready for occupation in January 1902. In the meantime, an organ for the new larger worship space was being sought and in 1902, the organ at Metropolitan Methodist Church in Toronto was presented to the Trustees of Central Methodist in the Sault by Mrs. Lillian Massey Treble. The organ has a history that dates back to 1872 when the Odell Organ Company of New York installed it in Toronto's Metropolitan Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1875 that instrument was enlarged by the Warren Organ Co. of Montreal. In late 1902, the congregation received a donation of $5,000 from the estate of Mr. Hart A. Massey conditional on the building of the new church not costing more than $20,000.\n\nAt that point, preliminary sketches for the sanctuary by architect Henry Simpson of Toronto were chosen. Tenders were opened in May 1903 with the lowest coming in at $29,150, well over the established $20,000 maximum. The executers of the Massey estate were contacted to ask if the conditions of the donation could be changed.\n\nOnce that was established, the congregation took out a $10,000 mortgage so the sanctuary could be built. The Sault Star reported in February 1903 that the final plans called for a structure costing nearly $25,000 and having a seating capacity of 1000, which could be increased to 1,500 by opening folding doors to the existing school room.\n\nThe cornerstone was laid by Sheriff Carney on September 7, 1903, but the collapse of the Consolidated Lake Superior Company and the subsequent depression interrupted the work the very next month. The building fund to collect subscriptions for the new church was not restarted until December of 1904 with building operations finally resuming in March of 1905.\n\nAt this time the trustees decided that it was inadvisable to attempt more than the completion of the auditorium, leaving the building of the tower, vestries and parlour for a later time.\n\nThe auditorium was completed and dedicated on February 18, 1906. Also in 1906, at a cost of $2,000 the Karn Organ Company of Woodstock, Ontario enlarged the organ to 24 speaking stops, distributed over two manuals and pedal and the key action was converted from mechanical (tracker) to pneumatic when the present sanctuary was opened in 1906.\n\nIt was at this time that the organ was installed in the newly-completed sanctuary of Central Methodist Church in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario with the console attached directly to the front of the organ case which stands around three stories. Central United Church, designed by Architect Henry Simpson of Toronto, cannot be slotted easily into any particular architectural style.\n\nThe different stages of construction together with the demands of the building committee changed Simpson's original concepts, creating a worship space that is unique.\n\nThe church is still considered to be a \"powerfully modelled building in warm local stone\" that combines the ideas of the architect with an appearance \"indicative of Methodism.\" The organ and sanctuary have undergone many renovations since 1906, both planned and unplanned.\n\nAmong the planned renovations were the moving of the organ console and choir loft to the centre front of the church in the 1950s and a complete refurbishing of the organ in 1961.\n\nA fire in the sanctuary in 1978 made it necessary to replace the organ console at a cost of $21,000, which was more than the entire renovation of the instrument in 1961.\n\nThe current organ has 56 stops (3,213 pipes) and the pipes range in length from 1/2 inch to 16 feet and it is one of the largest instruments of its kind in this part of Canada.\n\n*********************"
