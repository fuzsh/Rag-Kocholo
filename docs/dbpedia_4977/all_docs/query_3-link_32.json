        "text": "Sephardi Congregations\n\nand Other Eastern Rites (Edot haMizrach) Congregations\n\nThe premier Sephardi synagogal organisation in Britain is the S&P Sephardi Community (until about 2015 known as the Spanish & Portuguese Jews' Congregation). This, as well as most Sephardi and other Edot ha-Mizrach (Eastern Rites) congregations, is centred primarily in London. However, most Sephardi or other Edot haMizrach congregations are independent, although many are today loosely affiliated with the S&P Sephardi Community (which is often referred to as Western Sephardi).\n\nAlthough the Sephardi community is the oldest Jewish community in Britain, having been established nearly half a century prior to the first Ashkanazi congregation, Sephardi Jews form only a small percentage of British Jewry. Membership of Sephardi and other Edot ha-Mizrach congregations in 2016 constituted only 2.9% of total synagogue membership in the United Kingdom.(1)\n\nHistory\n\nThe Spanish and Portuguese Jews' Congregation in London dates back to 1657. It was founded by a group of Marranos or New Christians (now generally referred to Anusim) merchants who had been living in London, openly professing to be Spanish Catholics, but clandistinely continuing to practise the Jewish religion. When, as a result of a number of events, it became apparent at the end of 1656 that there was no longer a prohibition on Jews living in England (Jews had been expelled by King Edward I in 1290), the group of merchants acquired a house in Creechurch Lane, in the City of London, for use as a synagogue, holding services there from 1657 until 1701, when the Bevis Marks Synagogue was built. Bevis Marks is the oldest extant synagogue in Britain (other than possibly a medieval synagogue in Lincoln).\n\nA branch congregation was established in Wigmore Street (in London's West End) in 1853, moving to Bryanston Street in 1861 and to the existing building in Lauderdale Road, Maida Vale, in 1896. Other branch congregations were established, in Ramsgate and Wembley, and a number of other independent Sephardi congregation were founded having loose links with the \"mother\" congregation. The Spanish & Portuguese Synagogue, Holland Park was established in 1928 under a Deed of Association with the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' Congregation.\n\nThe Congregation is by governed by a Board of Elders, as well as a Mahamad of five members, who act as an executive. The affairs of the Congregation are regulated by a body of Laws, known as Ascamot, the earliest of which is known to date from 1663.\n\nThe community is served by a team rabbinate: the post of Haham (see list below), or chief rabbi, is currently vacant (and has frequently been so in the Congregation's history), the current head being known as the \"Senior Rabbi\".\n\nCongregations\n\nThe following lists the Sephardi and other Eastern (Edot haMizrach) rites Synagogues within regions covered by JCR-UK, which includes all the synagogues in Gibraltar.\n\n________________\n\nNotes & Sources (↵ returns to main text)\n\nPage created: 27 June 2017\n\nPage most recently amended: 25 April 2024\n\nResearch and formatting by David Shulman\n\nExplanation of Terms | About JCR-UK | JCR-UK home page\n\nContact JCR-UK Webmaster:\n\njcr-ukwebmaster@jgsgb.org.uk\n\n(Note: This is to contact JCR-UK, not the above Organisation)\n\nTerms and Conditions, Licenses and Restrictions for the use of this website:\n\nThis website is owned by JewishGen and the Jewish Genealogical Society of Great Britain.
