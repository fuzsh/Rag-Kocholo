        "text": "Larry Jackson\n\nFounder, gamma\n\nIn February, TikTok’s 1 billion-plus users received an unexpected gift for Valentine’s Day: exclusive access to the catalog of one of hip-hop’s most revered labels, Death Row Records. Snoop Dogg had purchased the catalog in 2022 and pulled it from streaming services. So the only place to hear tracks from Snoop’s classic Doggystyle or 2Pac’s 10-times-platinum All Eyez on Me was TikTok.\n\nThis partnership — as unusual as it was savvy — was the handiwork of veteran music executive Larry Jackson, 42, who seized the attention of the industry this year when he launched his entertainment company, gamma. Backed by $1 billion in financing and focused on putting that capital to work “in particular and acutely on Black culture,” Jackson has created a deep-pocketed alternative to the major labels.\n\nRead Billboard ’s full profile on executive of the year Larry Jackson here.\n\nShe’yaa “21 Savage” Abraham-Joseph\n\nJustin “Meezy” Williams\n\nCo-founders, Slaughter Gang Entertainment\n\nWilliams, who began managing 21 Savage in 2015, heads up Slaughter Gang Entertainment, the label he co-founded with the Billboard Hot 100-topping rapper. A highlight of the past year, he says, has been “building our new artists” and seeing those who have begun to make waves get bigger, including 21 Lil Harold, Yung Sinn, SG Tip, Big Bratt and Kid Hazel. Williams is also proud of the company’s work “executive-producing and co-distributing the Freaknik soundtrack for the Hulu documentary,” an album that accompanies the movie about students from historically Black colleges and universities attending Atlanta’s annual spring break party.\n\nTunji Balogun\n\nChairman/CEO, Def Jam Recordings\n\nLaTrice Burnette\n\nExecutive vp, Def Jam Recordings; president, 4th & Broadway\n\nArchie Davis\n\nExecutive vp/chief creative officer, Def Jam Recordings\n\nNatina Nimene\n\nExecutive vp of promotion and artist relations, Def Jam Recordings\n\nNaim McNair\n\nNoah Preston\n\nExecutive vps of A&R, Def Jam Recordings\n\n“Our journey over the last 18 months has been about establishing this company as an agile, insightful and powerful engine for artist development,” says Balogun. The label chief goes on to cite recent Grammy Award winner Muni Long; Coco Jones and her first Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay No. 1, “ICU”; and rising rapper Armani White. “Together with the bold A&R work and development around artists like Fridayy, Adekunle Gold and Chase Shakur, these artists represent a super diverse cross-section of the culture,” he adds, “and are the future lifeblood of Def Jam.”\n\nKatina Bynum\n\nExecutive vp of East Coast labels for urban, Universal Music Enterprises\n\nBynum captures a professional highlight of the past year in one word: “Rihanna.” The singer’s headlining performance at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show in February was preceded by the 2022 release of the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack, which featured Rihanna’s latest song, “Lift Me Up.” The album reached No. 1 on the Soundtracks chart. Following the Super Bowl performance, “Rihanna’s overall catalog received a huge boost [both in] audio and video streams,” says Bynum, pushing “her total streams to an all-time high.”\n\nJuan “DJ Kast One” Cabral\n\nAssociate director of A&R, Legacy Recordings\n\nCabral has built a solid rep spinning hip-hop, R&B and reggae as DJ Kast One at WQHT (Hot 97) New York, “where hip-hop lives,” as the station’s slogan goes. As associate director of A&R at Legacy Recordings, the Bronx native works with content, marketing and digital teams to identify trends and elevate “music that can help refresh and revitalize catalog assets,” he says. For example, he assigned and oversaw mixings for Miguel’s “Sure Thing” and Ruth B’s “Dandelions” and applied Dolby’s Atmos spacial audio technology to Run-D.M.C.’s catalog albums and Khalid’s American Teen for its fifth-anniversary campaign.\n\nDon Cannon\n\nLeighton “Lake” Morrison\n\nTyree “DJ Drama” Simmons\n\nCo-founders, Generation Now\n\nGeneration Now enjoyed another fruitful year courtesy of stars Lil Uzi Vert and Jack Harlow. In February, Uzi scored his seventh top 10 on the Hot 100 with his Jersey club hit, “Just Wanna Rock,” which also reached No. 1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart after its adoption as an anthem for the Philadelphia Eagles’ Super Bowl run. Harlow netted his third top 10 on the Billboard 200 and first No. 1 on Top Rap Albums with Jackman. He also evolved into a TV darling, starring in the modern-day remake of the 1990s cult classic White Men Can’t Jump and appearing in Lil Dicky’s FX comedy series, DAVE. “This year, we took Generation Now to a whole new level,” says Morrison. “We are most proud of all our work in Atlanta to better the community and empower the youth while continuing to push the culture forward and create opportunity.”\n\nSteve “Steve O” Carless\n\nPresident of A&R, Warner Records\n\nDionnee Harper\n\nExecutive vp of marketing and artist development, Warner Records\n\nEricka Coulter\n\nSenior vp of A&R, Warner Records\n\nRon Stewart\n\nSenior vp of urban promotion, Warner Records\n\nWarner Records found a rising hip-hop star this year in signee NLE Choppa, who notched two gold singles with “Slut Me Out” and his 2 Rare collaboration “Do It Again.” In addition, the Memphis rapper achieved success on both radio and the road, landing two top 10 singles this year on both the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Airplay charts and making over 30 high school and college visits across the country. In June, Choppa was a featured artist at the WHTA (Hot 107.9) Birthday Bash in Atlanta.\n\nBill Evans\n\nExecutive vp of urban promotion, Capitol Music Group\n\nOrlando Wharton\n\nExecutive vp, Capitol Music Group\n\nTwin Clark\n\nSenior vp of artist relations, Motown\n\nKenoe Jordan\n\nVp of A&R, Motown\n\nJessica Eason\n\nVp of marketing, Capitol Music Group\n\nDante Smith\n\nVp of digital marketing, Capitol Music Group\n\nR&B and hip-hop flourished as genres at Capitol Music Group and Motown over the past year with breakthroughs from rising stars like Doechii and Toosii as well as Ice Spice, who landed four tracks in the Hot 100 top 10. “We have incredibly talented artists in the pipeline,” says Wharton, “and Capitol Music Group will continue to prove to the world that we are a real force in these genres.”\n\nKendell “Sav” Freeman\n\nVp/co-head of urban music, Arista Records\n\nKhris Riddick-Tynes\n\nVp of A&R/co-head of urban music, Arista Records; president, producer, songwriter, Sam Edmonds Songs\n\nFor Freeman and Riddick-Tynes, the success of the past year has been largely defined by Arista’s newest slate of artists. Along with the continued rise of acts like Idman and Audrey Nuna, they both emphasize the introduction of Lola Brooke as a major highlight of 2023, thanks to her breakout success with “Don’t Play With It,” the burgeoning rapper’s first Hot 100 entry. Says Freeman: “Seeing all the adoration and critical acclaim Lola has received from fans, peers and critics as well as the worldwide success she has achieved so far has been an exciting experience.”\n\nLanre Gaba\n\nMichael Kyser\n\nCo-presidents of Black music, Atlantic Records\n\nMarsha St. Hubert\n\nSenior vp/head of marketing, Atlantic Records\n\nSuccess Davis\n\nVp of A&R, Atlantic Records\n\nShauna James\n\nSenior manager of Black music digital marketing, Atlantic Records\n\nAtlantic’s deep-rooted commitment to artist development has continued to pay off. On the heels of recent success with projects from Burna Boy (“Last Last”), Kodak Black (“Super Gremlin”) and Ravyn Lenae (“Skin Tight,” her first No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay, featuring Steve Lacy), the label dialed up attention with Kali’s “Area Codes.” Signed to Atlantic during the pandemic, the rap newcomer achieved her first Hot 100 hit with the TikTok-driven track, which peaked at No. 33. “With the success of ‘Area Codes,’ ” says Gaba, “we are incredibly excited about breaking yet another new artist.”\n\nGhazi\n\nFounder/CEO, EMPIRE\n\nNima Etminan\n\nCOO, EMPIRE\n\nTina Davis\n\nPresident, EMPIRE\n\nEamon Mulligan\n\nSenior vp of product and ecommerce, EMPIRE\n\nHarrison Golding\n\nVp of strategic marketing, EMPIRE\n\nEMPIRE’s standing as a champion of its hometown Bay Area hip-hop scene was bolstered once again by the release of The Great Escape from Larry June and The Alchemist, which reached No. 32 on the Billboard 200 and prefaced a 60-city North American headline tour that Etminan calls “a great example of an independent artist carving out their own lane.” Detroit MC Peezy also reached a career best with the single “2 Million Up,” which earned a BET Award nomination and an RIAA gold certification.\n\nYo Gotti\n\nFounder/CEO, Collective Music Group\n\nThe Tennessee rapper and label executive’s imprint enjoyed a big year, with new signee GloRilla establishing herself as a hot new artist. Named to XXL’s 2023 Freshman Class after scoring Hot 100 hits with “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)” (with Hitkidd) and “Tomorrow 2” (with Cardi B), she and fellow CMG artist Moneybagg Yo recently hit the chart with “On Wat U On.” Meanwhile, their labelmates 42 Dugg, EST Gee, Blac Youngsta, Mozzy and R&B singer Lehla Samia continued to build careers. “Everyone on the team plays a part in the win,” Gotti told Billboard in 2022. “That’s why it’s called Collective Music Group.”\n\nElliot Grainge\n\nFounder/CEO, 10K Projects\n\nZach Friedman\n\nTony Talamo\n\nCo-presidents, 10K Projects\n\n“Hip-hop remains the foundation of everything we’ve built at 10K over these past few years,” says Grainge, who applauds Trippie Redd’s ability to “push the creative envelope with his amazing work,” including his latest album, Mansion Musik, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, hot new signee Ice Spice “has emerged as one of the biggest artists of the year,” Grainge adds, with four top 10 hits on the Hot 100, including the No. 7 debut of “Barbie World” (see story, page 60).\n\nNaji Grampus\n\nVp of streaming and strategy, The Orchard\n\nGrampus recently entered a new partnership between The Orchard and his own label, 24/8 Music Group. The joint venture is dedicated to developing hip-hop and R&B artists and “reinforces The Orchard’s mission to be a true home for creators,” Grampus says. The Orchard also signed Diddy’s Love Records and led release strategies for Nas’ King’s Disease III — which debuted at No. 10 in November on the Billboard 200, tying Nas with Jay-Z for the most top 10 albums on the chart by a rapper — and Lojay’s “Monalisa” (with Sarz and Chris Brown), which reached No. 8 on the U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart. “We have seen tremendous success,” Grampus says, “with Human Re Sources’ breakout artist RAYE and DJ Premier’s Hip Hop Volume 1 in partnership with Mass Appeal as well as Stomp Down Records’ Houston-born rapper Monaleo.”\n\nSaint Harraway\n\nExecutive vp of A&R, Republic Records; co-president, Uptown Records\n\nMike Horton\n\nExecutive vp of promotion, Republic Records\n\nDanielle Price\n\nExecutive vp, Republic Records\n\nKen “Duro” Ifill\n\nSenior vp of A&R, Republic Records; operations manager, NYC Republic -Recording Studio\n\nDave Ingenloff\n\nSenior vp of rhythm cross promotion, Republic Records\n\nXiarra Diamond Nimrod\n\nVp of marketing strategy, Republic Records\n\nThe relaunch of iconic label Uptown Records underscores Republic’s commitment to R&B/hip-hop music and culture. “The Uptown team, led by Harraway and [fellow co-president] Marleny Reyes, has done a phenomenal job at this early stage building and supporting a roster of incredible artists who speak to the legacy of the label, yet represent the future of our business,” says Price. Republic is also home to The Weeknd, Drake, Nicki Minaj, newly minted Songwriters Hall of Fame honoree Post Malone and up-and-comer Coi Leray, as well as hip-hop producer ATL Jacob and his Wicked Money Family label.\n\nKevin Liles\n\nChairman/CEO, 300 Elektra Entertainment\n\nRayna Bass\n\nSelim Bouab\n\nCo-presidents, 300 Entertainment\n\nLeesa Brunson-Boland\n\nSenior vp/head of A&R operations and administration, 300 Entertainment\n\nLallie Jones\n\nVp of marketing, 300 Entertainment\n\nMichael McArthur\n\nVp of A&R, 300 Entertainment\n\n300 Entertainment remains a significant force in hip-hop with artists like Megan Thee Stallion, Gunna and Young Thug. Despite its rap-heavy roster, the label also scored big in R&B when Mary J. Blige notched six Grammy Award nominations for this year’s ceremony, including an album of the year nod. Younger stars flourish, notably PinkPantheress, who scored her first Hot 100 top five song alongside Ice Spice with their “Boy’s a Liar, Pt. 2” collaboration. 300 has also built out other divisions, including 300 Publishing, Sparta and 300 Studios, which recently won a sports Emmy Award for its debut project, Race. 300 Entertainment co-presidents Bass and Bouab both say that the past year shows the label can operate at a high level in multiple aspects of the business.\n\nChioke “Stretch” McCoy\n\nCo-founder/managing partner/president, Blac Noize! Recordings\n\nCharley Greenberg\n\nCo-founder/managing partner/GM, Blac Noize! Recordings\n\nTony Bucher\n\nCo-founder/managing partner/COO, Blac Noize! Recordings\n\n“Nimble” was the key word for Blac Noize! Recordings in 2022, says McCoy, with the breakout success of rapper GloRilla’s Hitkidd-produced smash, “F.N.F. (Let’s Go).” McCoy says that being “fast and using the incredible amount of data we have today” has led the company to become an industry leader. “Taking ‘F.N.F.’ to No. 1 at [R&B/hip-hop] radio and being nominated for a Grammy after being told it was ‘regional’ highlighted a great year,” he says.\n\nTodd Moscowitz\n\nFounder/CEO, Alamo Records\n\nJuliette Jones\n\nCOO, Alamo Records\n\nAlamo Records superstar Lil Durk debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 in June with Almost Healed after hitting No. 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart with “All My Life” (featuring J. Cole) and No. 2 on the Hot 100. Alamo has also had significant growth over the past year thanks to the launch of its artist and label services company, Santa Anna, Jones says. She notes that Alamo’s focus with the division, led by president Lee L’Heureux, “is to partner with entrepreneurs in building their businesses,” citing team-ups with Conor Ambrose’s Listen to the Kids, Caroline “Baroline” Diaz’s Great Day and Laka Films’ No More Heroes and Now and Forever as “just the beginning.”\n\nBrian Nolan\n\nPresident of global marketing and sync, APG\n\nCorey Calder\n\nSenior vp of marketing and brand, APG\n\nEli Piccarreta\n\nVp of A&R, APG\n\nAPG scored a hit with the skillfully marketed Fast X soundtrack. After securing Jimin of BTS for a feature on Kodak Black and NLE Choppa’s “Angel Pt. 1” (Muni Long and JVKE are also featured), the album debuted atop the Soundtracks chart. The past year for APG has also included wins in artist development with Lambo4oe and Chase B, as well as Anti Da Menace, Sdot Go and Sweepers ENT, “who have an incredible movement breaking out of New York,” and Odetari, “who combines hip-hop and electronic music out of Houston,” says Nolan.\n\nMark Pitts\n\nPresident, RCA Records; CEO, ByStorm Entertainment\n\nCarolyn Williams\n\nExecutive vp, RCA Records\n\nSam Selolwane\n\nHead of promotion (hip-hop, R&B, mixshow), RCA Records\n\nGeorge Clark III\n\nVp of marketing and A&R, RCA Records\n\nAnthony “ADP” De Padua\n\nVp of digital marketing, RCA Records\n\nCarlos Cuadros\n\nSenior director of digital marketing, RCA Records\n\nRCA has remained a dominant R&B/hip-hop player thanks to a powerful roster that includes Steve Lacy, SZA, Latto and Miguel. SZA’s highly anticipated SOS spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, while the single “Kill Bill” logged a record-breaking 21 weeks atop the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Miguel’s single “Sure Thing,” resurrected by TikTok over a decade after its 2010 release, reached a new Hot 100 peak at No. 11 and broke the record for most weeks on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Latto’s “Put It on Da Floor Again” with Cardi B reached No. 6 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Lacy won the best progressive R&B album Grammy for Gemini Rights, home to the Hot 100 No. 1 “Bad Habit.” Pitts says RCA is “looking toward the next wave of rising talent,” with Afrobeats signee Libianca already earning her first Hot 100 entry with the single “People.”\n\nApril Pope\n\nVp of label development and marketing, ADA Worldwide\n\nAlassane Konaté\n\nDirector, ADA France\n\nDuring the past 18 months, ADA Worldwide — the independent label and artist services division of Warner Music Group — has scored success on several fronts in R&B and hip-hop. The company made Mobb Deep rapper Prodigy’s solo catalog available on streaming services for the first time in three years. Plus, it distributed indie label Big.Ass.Kids’ compilation See You Next Year — a collaboration with new-music curator Pigeons & Planes and executive-produced by Grammy-winning engineer Mike Dean — and French rapper Menace Santana’s album Into the Dark. “ADA has fueled record-breaking results of emerging talents globally and been instrumental in pivotal cultural moments,” says Pope.\n\nRicky Reed\n\nFounder/CEO, Nice Life Recording\n\nLarry Wade\n\nCo-owner/COO, Nice Life Recording\n\nNice Life’s profile rose with the globe-spanning success of Lizzo. Between scoring a No. 1 Hot 100 smash with “About Damn Time” and earning both a Grammy for record of the year and her first Adult R&B Airplay No. 1 with the SZA collaboration “Special,” Lizzo’s wins over the past 12 months have led to historic success for the label. But Wade says there’s plenty more in the works from Nice Life: “We’re very excited for what’s ahead, bolstered by new label signings, including Tinashe, and other developments within the company.”\n\nSylvia Rhone\n\nChairwoman/CEO, Epic Records\n\nEzekiel Lewis\n\nPresident, Epic Records\n\nJennifer Goicoechea\n\nSenior vp of A&R, Epic Records\n\nDontay Thompson\n\nSenior vp of promotion, Epic Records\n\nChelsea Donnarumma\n\nVp of commercial partnerships, Epic Records\n\nJustin Duran\n\nVp of marketing, Epic Records\n\nEpic has a deep roster of R&B and hip-hop stars, including Travis Scott, 21 Savage, Real Boston Richey and Future, whose ninth album, I Never Liked You, topped the Billboard 200. “I have been lucky enough to work every Future album since Pluto and to be a part of so many No. 1s, including this one, his eighth, [which] will of course be a career highlight,” Donnarumma says. The Drake- and Tems-assisted single “Wait for U” debuted atop the Hot 100 in May 2022 to become Future’s first No. 1 as a lead artist and spent a record-breaking 16 weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart.\n\nJacqueline Saturn\n\nPresident, Virgin Music\n\nGeorge Yarboi\n\nSenior director of marketing, hip-hop and R&B, Virgin Music\n\nTrenton Pratt\n\nDirector of streaming and playlisting ­strategy, hip-hop and R&B, Virgin Music\n\nVirgin recently scored a major success with Nigerian artist Rema, whose single “Calm Down” with Selena Gomez hit No. 3 on the Hot 100 in June — a major feat for an African act. Elsewhere, rapper NF’s latest album, Hope, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in April, marking his fourth consecutive top three entry on the chart. “We are lucky to work with the most incredible label partners on the planet and a Virgin team that has so much love and respect for one another,” Saturn says.\n\nSnoop Dogg\n\nOwner, Death Row Records\n\nIn February 2022, Snoop Dogg announced he had acquired Death Row Records — which released his 1993 multiplatinum debut, Doggystyle, and his follow-up albums — from MNRK Music Group. Then, in December, he sold a stake in the catalog to gamma, a new company led by former Apple Music executive Larry Jackson. “I’ve been in the game for more than two decades. I’m blessed,” Snoop says. “I’ve been able to do a lot in this game and in the recent past. I’m proud of bringing Death Row Records home. We’ve accomplished a lot since I took ownership, and it’s only going up from here.”\n\nSteve Stoute\n\nFounder/CEO, UnitedMasters\n\nDavid Melhado\n\nVp of music and marketing, UnitedMasters\n\nMike Weiss\n\nVp of music/head of A&R, UnitedMasters\n\n“This past year has been a huge growth year in building the artist partner business at UnitedMasters,” Weiss says.

The single “Kill Bill” hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 — a first for the superstar — while the album spent 10 weeks at No. 1. “It has been great watching SZA’s SOS dominate and break as many records as [it] has,” Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith says, “and then to take the show on the road for the world tour only further solidifies her as a generational talent.” Other wins for the label include the return of Ab-Soul with the album Herbert and Doechii breaking through with her single “What It Is (Block Boy)” (featuring Kodak Black), which hit No. 1 on Rhythmic Airplay.\n\nAndre Torres\n\nSenior vp of global catalog development and marketing, recorded music, Warner Music Group\n\nThe Warner Music Group team has spent the year celebrating hip-hop’s 50th anniversary, “encompassing live events, vinyl releases, [merchandise] and bespoke playlists,” Torres says.

She says that warming up in the wings is Playboi Carti’s Opium label and its artists, “including Destroy Lonely, another major breakout for 2023, and Ken Carson, with highly anticipated new music on the way.”\n\nAndre “Dr. Dre” Young\n\nFounder/CEO, Aftermath Entertainment\n\nAshley Palmer-Gilkey\n\nGM, Aftermath Entertainment\n\nIn February, Dr. Dre announced that his landmark solo debut album, The Chronic, had returned to original distributor Interscope and would receive a special rerelease for its 30th anniversary. At the same time, it was revealed that the album would again be available on streaming services; it had been pulled following Snoop Dogg’s 2022 purchase of the Death Row label, which first released The Chronic in 1992. “We’re thrilled by the album’s enduring popularity with people all over the world,” Palmer-Gilkey says, “and are working on a variety of unique offerings for fans that we’re excited about.”\n\nTunde Balogun\n\nCo-founder/president, LVRN\n\nJunia Abaidoo\n\nCo-founder/head of operations and touring, LVRN\n\nJustice Baiden\n\nCo-founder/head of A&R, LVRN\n\nSean “Famoso” McNichol\n\nCo-founder/head of marketing and brand ­partnerships, LVRN\n\nCarlon Ramong\n\nCo-founder/creative director, LVRN\n\nAmber Grimes\n\nExecutive vp/GM, LVRN\n\nLVRN’s management side has continued to raise the bar with its clients’ success stories, beginning with Davido’s fourth studio album, Timeless, which peaked at No. 2 on the World Albums chart.

Those efforts will culminate with an Aug. 11 concert at Yankee Stadium boasting a cross-generational lineup of rap luminaries. “Our team has been working tirelessly to commemorate hip-hop’s undeniable global impact on our culture,” Bittenbender says. “We’re incredibly appreciative of our co-producers, Live Nation and the New York Yankees, for making this legendary concert possible and giving hip-hop the 50th birthday celebration it deserves.”\n\nShawn “Jay-Z” Carter\n\nFounder/chairman, Roc Nation\n\nDesiree Perez\n\nCEO, Roc Nation\n\nJay Brown\n\nVice chairman, Roc Nation\n\nThe story of the year for Roc Nation was the return of Rihanna, who not only wowed at the most watched Super Bowl halftime show in history (executive-produced by Roc Nation), complete with a pregnancy reveal, but landed an Academy Award nomination for “Lift Me Up” from the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack. Also, company client Lil Uzi Vert landed his seventh Hot 100 top 10 with “Just Wanna Rock,” while Ambré scored her first No. 1 on a Billboard chart with the Adult R&B Airplay hit “I’m Baby” (featuring Jvck James), another of Roc Nation’s “multiple milestones and groundbreaking achievements,” says Perez.\n\nKaren Civil\n\nExecutive vp/GM, Lil Wayne/Young Money Records\n\nIn December, Lil Wayne earned his first RIAA diamond certification for “Lollipop” (featuring Static Major) after the 2008 single made a resurgence on TikTok. The New Orleans rapper also performed 30 intimate shows on the Welcome to Tha Carter Tour with special guests Drake, Chance the Rapper, Cam’ron, 2 Chainz and more. Among a series of wins for her top client, Civil remains most proud of Lil Wayne receiving the Global Impact Award from the Recording Academy’s Black Music Collective in February. “The honor highlighted Wayne’s massive impact on the music industry as he continues to discover global superstars,” she says, referring to the rapper’s co-signs on artists including Drake, Nicki Minaj and Tyga.\n\nSabrina Coghiatti\n\nMusic manager, Primary Wave\n\n“One of our biggest goals is to always focus 100% on our clients,” says Coghiatti. This year, that focus included supporting Eric Benét as he started his own label, JBR Creative Group. Benét also premiered his series, Snap, on the AllBlk network, with him in a lead role as well as serving as executive producer. Meanwhile, Fantasia played the lead role of Celie in the musical film adaptation of The Color Purple, which will come out in December.

We’ve had some incredible releases, including Jozzy’s debut EP on Love Records,” as well as “the summer anthem ‘Act Bad’ on Bad Boy with me, the City Girls and Fabolous, and a new King Combs project on Bad Boy. We also have my upcoming album on Love Records coming out later this year.”\n\nAubrey “Drake” Graham\n\nOliver El-Katib\n\nCo-founders, OVO/OVO Sound\n\nNoah “40” Shebib\n\nCo-founder, OVO/OVO Sound; producer\n\nMr. Morgan\n\nPresident, OVO Sound\n\nSupported by the members of his OVO crew, Drake has dominated the pop, R&B and hip-hop landscape and been a constant presence atop the Billboard 200, most recently with Honestly, Nevermind in July 2022 and Her Loss, with 21 Savage, in November 2022. The latter title also sent eight tracks to the top 10 of the Hot 100. Most recently, the Canadian rapper ruled the Rhythmic Airplay chart with “Search and Rescue.” The track is his second Rhythmic Airplay No. 1 of 2023, following “Rich Flex,” a collaboration with 21 Savage, which topped the chart for two weeks in January and February. This marks the 15th year in which Drake has reached the top of the Rhythmic Airplay list, with more No. 1s — 38 in all — than any other artist in the 30-year history of that chart.\n\nShawn Holiday\n\nPresident/head of A&R, Giant Music; manager, Full Stop Management\n\nHoliday helped his management client Cardi B hop on the remix to rising rapper GloRilla’s “Tomorrow,” which came out in September, cracked the top 10 on the Hot 100 in October and topped the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart in December. Holiday also assisted in the release of management client Daniel Caesar’s Never Enough, the R&B singer’s first album with Republic Records after building a career as an independent artist; Never Enough has amassed nearly 200 million on-demand streams. On top of that, Holiday signed the band New West, which has a breakout streaming hit with “Those Eyes,” to Giant Music and Full Stop Management.\n\nDJ Khaled\n\nFounder/CEO, We the Best; global creative consultant, Universal Music Group\n\nIn addition to being a Billboard chart-topping artist — most recently debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with his star-studded 2022 album, GOD DID — Khaled serves as founder and CEO of We the Best, which became an imprint with Def Jam Recordings in February. At the same time, Khaled was also named global creative consultant for Def Jam parent UMG. In January, his 5-year-old We the Best Foundation launched the We the Best x STEAM Program for students in grades K-12.

Playing 41 stadium shows in 10 countries through September, the tour is expected to gross over $200 million, according to Billboard Boxscore. In February, Beyoncé named Omokhua as Parkwood Entertainment’s senior vp to run day-to-day operations. “Justina brings a wealth of marketing knowledge and experience to Parkwood Entertainment,” Beyoncé said in a statement.

It was “a massive moment for the history of the genre and for its generations of listeners past, present and future,” Lafargue says. “We are deeply proud of Reservoir’s ability to make good on our promise.”\n\nLL COOL J\n\nFounder, Rock the Bells; creator/curator, Rock the Bells Radio, SiriusXM\n\nJames Cuthbert\n\nPresident, Rock the Bells\n\nWhat excites LL COOL J the most about what the Rock the Bells team has accomplished, he says, “is not just our SiriusXM channel, successful series B raise [totaling $15 million, announced in April], the sold-out festivals and cruises, and the jobs and opportunities we’ve provided to iconic hip-hop artists, brands and fans who love those artists. It’s the fact that Rock the Bells has led this resurgence of timeless hip-hop worldwide. We lit the timeless hip-hop genre back on fire, and we don’t take that for granted. It’s an honor to pave the way and hold this mantle of leadership, and I look forward to many new and exciting projects ahead.”\n\nDeborah Mannis-Gardner\n\nOwner/president, DMG Clearances\n\nSince launching the company in 1996, Mannis-Gardner has cleared samples of vintage tracks for new recordings by a remarkable array of acts, including Beyoncé, Black Eyed Peas, Mariah Carey, DJ Khaled, Drake, Eminem, Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, Kendrick Lamar, John Legend, Lil Wayne, Macklemore, The Notorious B.I.G., Frank Ocean, Rihanna and U2. She played a key role in bringing De La Soul’s catalog to streaming services for the first time in March. “Sampling is a huge part of De La Soul’s entire catalog, and we spent the past year pulling off the impossible and cleared nearly every sample that was used by the group,” Mannis-Gardner says. “It is bittersweet that Trugoy the Dove isn’t here to see it, but I am so excited that a new generation will be able to hear and experience their music.”\n\nAustin Rosen\n\nFounder/CEO, Electric Feel Entertainment and Ventures\n\n“The last 12 to 18 months have been exciting for Electric Feel as we continue to build out our roster in all areas, but particularly publishing,” says Rosen, who manages artists like 24kGoldn, as well as songwriters such as Louis Bell, Billy Walsh and Carter Lang. He is also the longtime manager of Post Malone. Rosen was recognized in May as Billboard’s Executive of the Week as his company’s clients, including artists and songwriters, spent 87 straight weeks in the Hot 100’s top 10, he says. Electric Feel has made key R&B and hip-hop signings, including Texas rapper Vory and Jamaican reggae-dancehall singer Projexx. The company also inked a deal with breakout producer Linden Jay, who was “nominated for a Grammy this year as a co-producer on Doja Cat’s ‘Woman,’ ” Rosen says.\n\nAbel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye\n\nFounder, XO Records\n\nWassim “Sal” Slaiby\n\nCo-founder/CEO, XO Records\n\nAmir “Cash” Esmailian\n\nLaMar Taylor\n\nCo-founders, XO Records\n\nMelissa Mahood\n\nGM, XO Records\n\nIn the past year, Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye completely sold out the North American leg of his After Hours Til Dawn Tour and ranked No. 10 on Billboard Boxscore’s Top Tours of 2022 with a total reported gross of $131 million. (His SoFi Stadium show in Inglewood, Calif., on Sept. 2 was the highest-grossing concert by a Black artist at the venue, according to XO Records.) On June 2, Tesfaye released “Popular,” his single with Madonna and Playboi Carti from his album The Idol Vol. 1, the soundtrack to his HBO drama, The Idol, following the earlier soundtrack hit “Double Fantasy” (featuring Future). “We have always stood behind music that blurs the boundaries between genres,” Mahood says, “and challenges the conventional rules of what could be considered R&B, hip-hop or pop.”\n\nDave Airaudi\n\nManager, Airaudi Management\n\nHome to game-changing artists including The Internet, Steve Lacy, Fousheé and Syd Tha Kyd, Airaudi Management found success by way of its genre-bending artists, most notably former Billboard cover star Lacy. He took home the Grammy for best progressive R&B album for Gemini Rights and dominated the charts with his pop-R&B No. 1 hit, “Bad Habit.” “When you are a boutique that only works with artists who carve their own lane, you are not supposed to win Grammys,” Airaudi says. The manager calls it a surreal moment and “a culmination of all the work we have done from Odd Future to [Kanye West] to Pharrell [Williams], and yet the start of something new.”\n\nTy Baisden\n\nJayne Andrew\n\nCo-founders, Colture\n\nAfter scoring a No. 2 debut on the Billboard 200 with Brent Faiyaz’s album Wasteland, Colture’s prized star secured a partnership with UnitedMasters to launch a creative agency.

Colture has also enjoyed the success of rising polymath Malcolm Mays, who is coming off a successful second season for the hit Starz show Raising Kanan. “We are developing crossover talent that is heavily successful across music and film,” Baisden says.\n\nAntoine “Fee” Banks\n\nCEO, Good Money Global\n\nBanks says his “greatest accomplishment in the last 12 to 18 months was signing Lil Wayne for management to Good Money Global,” his joint venture with Interscope Records, and then “working with the team to put together the Welcome to Tha Carter Tour.” The tour, announced in January, played 30 dates before concluding May 13 at The Wiltern in Los Angeles. “Me and Wayne are childhood friends that grew into business partners,” Fee says. Management client Young Boy Never Broke Again has also kept busy, releasing his Billboard 200 top 10 album I Rest My Case in January, followed by two top five projects, the April album Don’t Try This at Home and May mixtape Richest Opp.\n\nGordan Dillard\n\nCamille Delaney\n\nRyan Ramsey\n\nDina Sahim\n\nManagers, SALXCO\n\nAt the management division of the SALXCO empire led and owned by Wassim “Sal” Slaiby, “trying to list the year we had would take pages,” Ramsey says. The company’s artists include Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye, Doja Cat and Metro Boomin. Tesfaye’s “Blinding Lights” became the biggest hit in the 64-year history of the Hot 100 when it was named the No. 1 song on the Greatest of All Time Billboard Hot 100 chart. Doja (co-managed by Dillard and Josh Kaplan at 10Q Management) ended last year as the No. 1 Radio Songs Artist and Top Female Hot 100 Artist. Metro Boomin also earned his third No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with Heroes & Villains, and the hip-hop super-producer helmed the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse film soundtrack. SALXCO acts Tesfaye, Doja, Swedish House Mafia, Ali Gatie and Belly all performed at Coachella in 2022, while Nancy Ajram’s “Sah Sah” (with Marshmello) became a breakthrough hit. “The records broken and talents amplified keep multiplying, and we are all so humbled by it,” Ramsey adds. “This is a family, and we are taking our brood wider around this globe.”\n\nTyler Henry\n\nChris Thomas\n\nManaging partners, Range Media Partners\n\n“It was a year of firsts” for many of Range’s management clients, says Henry, especially in R&B and hip-hop. Jack Harlow made his film debut in White Men Can’t Jump while Cordae won his first Emmy Award for his work on the Netflix series We the People, produced by former President Barack Obama. In addition, Cordae launched his own publishing company as WondaGurl started her own record label. And the wins continued with songwriter-producer duo Nova Wav earning its second Grammy Award, Saweetie joining the Range roster and PartyNextDoor readying his new album. Says Henry: “We are just getting started.”\n\nDre London\n\nFounder/CEO, London Entertainment\n\nLondon enjoyed watching his management client Post Malone, the crown jewel of his company, complete a successful 33-city concert run of his Twelve Carat Tour last fall. Post’s fourth studio album also spawned a bunch of top 20 hits, most notably the top five Hot 100 single “I Like You (A Happier Song)” (featuring Doja Cat) that earned the pair a Grammy nomination for best pop duo/group performance. During Post’s multicity trek, London launched his first premium tequila brand, Don Londrés, which hit shelves in January.\n\nJames Rosemond Jr.\n\nFounder/CEO, Mastermind Artists\n\nFollowing Ice Spice’s breakout single, “Munch (Feelin’ U),” last summer, Rosemond’s client quickly rose to become one of the hottest new stars of 2023. The Bronx drill rapper earned four top 10 hits on the Hot 100: a featured spot on Taylor Swift’s “Karma” (No. 2); “Boy’s a Liar, Pt. 2,” with PinkPantheress (No. 3); “Princess Diana,” with Nicki Minaj (No. 4); and “Barbie World,” with Minaj and featuring Aqua (No. 7). “She’s a superstar, and I’ve done my best to put her in the right places to succeed,” says Rosemond, “but we never expected success to come this quickly.” He also says he’s proud to manage RIOTUSA, Ice’s go-to producer who spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Rap Producers chart.\n\nEbonie Ward\n\nCEO, 11th and Co\n\nHaving guided clients like Future and Gunna to blockbuster success in 2022, Ward says her biggest win this year has been personal. After five years at Emagen Entertainment Group, she launched 11th & Co in March as the first full-service management firm to be led entirely by Black women. “It was time to do something different,” she told Billboard then. While setting up the new company, Ward has expanded her clientele beyond hip-hop and R&B. In addition to signing NBA star James Harden, she helped Flo Milli partner with PUCCI for her 2023 Coachella performance. In between scoring hit singles, Future teamed up with LANVIN for a new campaign.\n\nAnthony “Ant” Wilson\n\nArtist manager, Anthony Wilson ­Management; executive producer, Tycoon Music\n\nWilson’s superstar client Chris Brown sold out all 24 dates on the European leg of his Under the Influence Tour, named after the sleeper hit from the deluxe edition of Brown’s 2019 Indigo album. “Under the Influence” didn’t enter the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart until three years after its release, but eventually ruled the list for eight weeks. Wilson says he’s also proud of “another successful season” of Starz’s BMF series, for which he serves as executive producer, and he’s already working on filming season three.\n\nEbro Darden\n\nGlobal editorial director of hip-hop and R&B, Apple Music\n\nWalter Tucker\n\nMusic business partnerships lead, hip-hop and R&B, Apple Music\n\nHip-Hop DNA is the newest addition to Apple Music’s programming slate. The 20-episode original audio series salutes hip-hop’s 50th anniversary by tracing the genre’s origin, evolution and global cultural influence. Hosted by Darden, the program has been supported by a four-month campaign encompassing editorial content, DJ mixes, playlists, podcasts and radio. “Listeners are taken on a celebratory and educational musical journey,” Tucker says, “dedicated to spotlighting the MCs, producers and DJs that have been essential to defining the DNA of the world’s most influential and dominant genre.”\n\nTimothy Hinshaw\n\nHead of hip-hop and R&B, Amazon Music\n\nRochelle Balogun\n\nSenior hip-hop music curator, Amazon Music\n\nSierra Lever\n\nLabel relations manager for hip-hop, R&B, Afrobeats, Amazon Music\n\nJosh Peas\n\nArtist relations for hip-hop and R&B, Amazon Music\n\nIn 2023, Amazon Music is putting its considerable marketing muscle behind 50 & Forever, a campaign to celebrate hip-hop’s 50th anniversary. The initiative introduces listeners to important artists and regional scenes. “Hip-hop hasn’t just changed history, but is history,” Hinshaw says, “and 50 & Forever gives hip-hop its well-deserved flowers with events, livestreams, original content and more.” 50 & Forever has also been a part of Amazon Music’s livestreams of J. Cole’s Dreamville Festival, Mary J. Blige’s Strength of a Woman Festival and the Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival.\n\nJason Johnson\n\nFormer senior vp of marketing and brand strategy, Audiomack\n\nJoe “Vango” Jackson\n\nSenior director of marketing and curation, Audiomack\n\nMidway through 2023, Jackson reported a 163% growth in streams of Audiomack’s playlists, an increase he calls “crazy.” He explains: “We’re creating more opportunities for emerging independent artists by giving them more platforms and playlists that are specifically dedicated to them and to fans that enjoy the music discovery.” As part of a similar effort, Johnson (who recently left Audiomack) has helped highlight rising acts like Blxst, GloRilla and Ayra Starr in Audiomack’s UpNow program. “There are so many entry points right now when it comes down to pushing out your music,” he adds. “My focus is always trying to find individual artists and taking the time to tell their stories.”\n\nJason Kpana\n\nSenior vp of artist and label relations, TIDAL\n\nAs TIDAL continues to reinvent itself beyond its streaming service roots, the company is doubling down on its support of up-and-coming artists through its refreshed TIDAL Rising program, providing marketing, financial, live and editorial support to a new crop of artists. That has included rapper Reuben Vincent, who recently landed his first billboard in Times Square, as well as R&B singer Casper Sage, who performed at TIDAL’s showcase during the Music Biz conference in Nashville. At the same time, the company has leaned into the yearlong celebration of hip-hop’s 50th anniversary by booking artists like Lil Wayne on TIDAL’s new Live feature, allowing them to connect directly to their fans.\n\nBrittany Lewis\n\nArtist partnerships lead, Black music and culture, YouTube\n\nRachel Jackson\n\nArtist partnerships manager, YouTube\n\nAdam McFarland\n\nProgram manager, Black music and culture, YouTube\n\nRyan Thornton\n\nHead of catalog music/label partnerships, YouTube\n\nOne of YouTube’s most meaningful achievements of the past year was Future Insiders, a global program that aims “to increase educational equity for artists, content creators and the next generation of music industry executives,” says Jackson. At events in creative hubs such as Detroit, Memphis, Los Angeles, Chicago, London, São Paulo and Accra, Ghana, participants got advice for succeeding both on and off the YouTube platform from such leaders as Chance the Rapper, manager Peter Jideonwo, Nigerian singer FireBoy DML and podcaster-influencer Wallo267. “Future Insiders is one of many programs we’ve created,” Jackson says, “to enlighten, enrich and level the playing field for our global Black communities.”\n\nAlaysia Sierra\n\nHead of R&B, Spotify\n\nMax Weinstein\n\nHip-hop lead, artist partnerships, Spotify\n\nCarl Chery\n\nCreative director/head of urban music, Spotify\n\nSafiya Lambie-Knight\n\nHead of music U.K. & Ireland, Spotify\n\nRapCaviar has become a brand unto itself since Spotify launched its flagship hip-hop playlist in 2015. First, RapCaviar Live hosted a concert series in 2016 and 2017, then one-off concerts in 2018 and 2019. Spotify later launched The RapCaviar Podcast and debuted the All-RapCaviar Campaign in collaboration with pro basketball player Kevin Durant and media platform Boardroom. In March, Hulu launched the RapCaviar Presents documentary series. “I’m proud of the work our team has put in to expand the world of our playlists for artists at all stages of their careers and fans,” Chery says.\n\nMaurice Slade\n\nHead of marketing and artist relations, SoundCloud\n\nIn the year since Slade joined SoundCloud as head of marketing and artist relations, finding new modes of distribution for artists on the music-sharing platform has been at the forefront of his work. During Slade’s tenure, SoundCloud has formed partnerships with management and creative services companies Solid Foundation and Third & Hayden — founded by former music executive Kei Henderson — to build the careers of budding stars, as well as seasoned players such as FinEsseMo, MiLES, Jordan Hawkins and KEY!\n\nSwizz Beatz\n\nTimbaland\n\nCo-founders, Verzuz\n\nSteve Pamon\n\nPresident, Verzuz\n\nIn less than five years, Verzuz has gained notoriety thanks to its memorable musical “battles” between Brandy and Monica, Ludacris and Nelly, and the first-ever Latin battle last summer between DJ Nelson and Luny Tunes, to name a few. Over the past year, according to Pamon, the webcast series that airs on Verzuz TV “marked a significant accomplishment, hitting a billion views across all battles.” Fueled by its high profile on podcasts and in social media, the Verzuz milestone further confirms “the platform’s dominant influence in the music scene,” says Pamon, who also foreshadows an “anticipated Sean Combs vs. Jermaine Dupri showdown on the horizon.”\n\nAshley Calhoun\n\nPresident/head of creative, PULSE Music Group\n\nCalhoun proudly notes that PULSE clients Isaac “Zac” De Boni and Michael “Finatik” Mulé (known as FNZ) were honored as top producers at BMI’s 2022 R&B Hip-Hop Awards. Among the duo’s recent hits are “Wait for U” by Future (featuring Drake and Tems), which debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, and “Rich Flex,” from Drake and 21 Savage, which reached No. 2. PULSE also represents Angel Lopez, co-writer of Jack Harlow’s Hot 100 chart-topper “First Class”; Ty Dolla $ign, who is featured along with Tyga on his co-write of “Chosen” by Blxst; and Brent Faiyaz, who had seven Hot 100 hits in 2022.\n\nLukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald\n\nFounder, Prescription Songs\n\nFounded by producer-songwriter Gottwald, Prescription Songs “has been a part of some of the past year’s biggest songs,” he says. The hits in which the company represents a share include two Lil Durk tracks: “All My Life” (featuring J. Cole) and “Stand by Me” (featuring Morgan Wallen). Gottwald highlights the TikTok success of “Pretty Girls Walk” by Big Boss Vette and DJ Khaled’s “GOD DID” — which was co-written and features one of Prescription’s newer signees, Fridayy — as well as Doja Cat’s “Vegas,” SZA’s “Kill Bill” and Nicki Minaj’s “Super Freaky Girl” from last summer, co-written by Gottwald, Aaron Joseph, Vaughn Oliver, LunchMoney Lewis and Malibu Babie. (Minaj is also credited as a writer, as are Rick James and Alonzo Miller for the song’s “Super Freak” sample.)\n\nIan Holder\n\nSenior vp of creative, Sony Music Publishing\n\nAri Gelaw\n\nVp of creative, Sony Music Publishing\n\nWill Skalmoski\n\nJamin Whatley\n\nDirectors of creative, Sony Music Publishing\n\nSMP’s creative team has remained an industry leader this year in hip-hop and R&B through both its own signees and its administrative partnership with Beatstars Publishing. Holder says the team is especially “excited and encouraged” by the growth of signees Toosii and NLE Choppa in the past year. Signed by Gelaw and manager of creative Simone Dixon, Toosii hit No. 1 on Hot Rap Songs and No. 5 on the Hot 100 with “Favorite Song,” released through SouthCoast/Capitol Records. NLE Choppa’s breakout hit, “Slut Me Out,” which reached No. 28 on the Hot 100, is “a great example of why we do what we do,” Holder says. “It is great to see him eclipse some of his past chart success.”\n\nLindsey Lanier\n\nVp, hip-hop, R&B and gospel, Kobalt Music\n\nGenevieve Jackson Huguely\n\nManager, creative, Kobalt Music\n\nDuring the past 18 months, Kobalt songwriters have helped create hits and other tracks for Beyoncé (“Virgo’s Groove,” No. 43 on the Hot 100, co-written by Dustin “DAB” Bowie), Lizzo (“Special” and three others co-written by Andrew “Pop” Wansel) and Jon Batiste (“Boy Hood,” co-written by Jahaan Sweet, from the Grammy-winning We Are). The publisher also represents Afropop singer Adekunle Gold, who recently signed with Def Jam, and rapper Smino, the J. Cole collaborator who released Luv 4 Rent in 2022. Says Lanier: “We have continued to grow our amazing roster of talent.”\n\nRyan Press\n\nPresident of North America, Warner Chappell Music\n\nShani Gonzales\n\nExecutive vp/managing director of U.K./head of international A&R, Warner Chappell Music\n\nWallace Joseph\n\nSenior vp of A&R, Warner Chappell Music\n\nPress, Gonzales and Joseph, who spearhead A&R for Warner Chappell’s R&B and hip-hop roster, had a remarkable last year. “We’re all about plugging our songwriters from different territories into our global network,” Gonzales says. One of her favorite highlights of the past 12 months was organizing a weeklong songwriting camp at Metropolis Studios in London featuring Dougie F, Headie One, Popcaan, P2J, Tay Keith, Turbo and Wretch 32. “It worked so well,” she says, “we’re doing it again this summer.”\n\nMichael Uzowuru\n\nProducer-songwriter, Universal Music Publishing Group\n\nUMPG signee Uzowuru has had a remarkable year. First, SZA’s long-awaited second album, SOS, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, featuring two of his co-productions (“Notice Me” and “Open Arms.”) Soon after, Uzowuru scored and executive-produced the soundtrack to Donald Glover’s new show, SWARM, which debuted on Amazon Prime Video to critical acclaim. But the producer-songwriter says that his role as a music-maker is all about “being in service to others. Partnering with UMPG has allowed me the honor and opportunity to be a part of the special careers of [producers] Jeff Kleinman and Teo Halm and [artist] Choker,” he says. “Grateful is an understatement.”\n\nJoe Budden\n\nPresident, The Joe Budden Network\n\nIt has been a busy year for The Joe Budden Network. In addition to launching the new live radio music talk show Music Lovers Only With Joe Budden on Amazon’s live radio app, Amp, in May 2022, the former rapper’s company developed a subscription-based audience for original content on Patreon — all while continuing to do his popular eponymous podcast. What’s more, Budden adds, “We’ve been able to empower emerging hip-hop and R&B artists on every episode of The Joe Budden Podcast during our ‘Sleeper Picks’ segment,” giving hosts an opportunity to spotlight new music and artists.\n\nSkip Dillard\n\nRhythmic AC and throwback format vp, Audacy; brand manager, WXBK (94.7 The Block) New York\n\nElevated to format vp for rhythmic AC and throwback in June, radio veteran Dillard is captaining the radio platform’s “Hip-Hop Made” program, a yearlong commemoration for hip-hop’s 50th anniversary. The initiative features weekly podcast episodes with guests ranging from LL COOL J and former NFL player Richard Sherman to Fall Out Boy’s Pete Wentz, who each recall how hip-hop has affected their personal and professional lives. “Our stations are working overtime with fresh content from a diverse group of artists,” Dillard says. “And there are more surprises to come.”\n\nThea Mitchem\n\nExecutive vp of programming, iHeartMedia; executive vp of hip-hop and R&B programming strategy/program director, WWPR (Power 105.1) New York\n\nDoc Wynter\n\nPresident of hip-hop and R&B programming strategy, iHeartMedia; program director, KRRL (Real 92.3) Los Angeles\n\nCharlamagne Tha God\n\nCo-host, The Breakfast Club, iHeartMedia; co-founder/chief creative officer, Black Effect Podcast Network; senior creative officer of cultural content and programming, iHeartMedia\n\nDJ Envy\n\nCo-host, The Breakfast Club, iHeartMedia\n\nAngela Yee\n\nHost, Way Up With Angela Yee, Angela Yee’s Lip Service, iHeartMedia\n\nAt iHeartMedia, the 50th anniversary of hip-hop meant a slate of programming to mark its golden anniversary. IHeartMedia launched its 50 Years of Hip-Hop podcast headed by legend Fab 5 Freddy to chronicle the people and events that “changed the culture forever” and highlighted hip-hop’s impact during tent-pole events for Black History Month, Women’s History Month and the annual Living Black! cultural celebration, executive-produced by Mitchem and Wynter. Internally, the brand made its own historic mark with Yee’s official departure from The Breakfast Club. Despite the shake-up, both she and the program charted new frontiers. Yee launched the nationally syndicated Way Up With Angela Yee in February, while The Breakfast Club, hosted by Charlamagne Tha God and DJ Envy, partnered with BET to show a truncated, daily version of the program, expanding its reach into millions of households.\n\nConnie Orlando\n\nExecutive vp/head of specials, music programming and music strategy, BET Networks\n\nIn her role at BET Networks, Orlando takes particular pride in the recent performance of the company’s flagship awards show, the BET Awards — which she has called “culture’s biggest night.” The 2023 event, which was held June 25 at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles (without a host due to the ongoing strike of the Writers Guild of America), included an appearance by Quavo and Offset in a surprise tribute to Takeoff in their first performance together since their Migos bandmate was fatally shot at age 28 in November. Busta Rhymes received a lifetime achievement award while Kid Capri led a 50th-anniversary tribute to hip-hop. “Each year, BET continues to exceed expectations with our live music awards show programming,” Orlando says.\n\nIsabel Quinteros Annous\n\nGlobal lead of music partnerships, TikTok\n\nSince her promotion in September to lead TikTok’s global partnerships, Quinteros Annous has forged a deal to bring Death Row Records’ music catalog to the platform, allowing TikTok users to incorporate clips of recordings from the iconic hip-hop label in their videos for the first time. “This unique partnership marked a historic moment as the first-ever catalog reissue to be exclusively on our platform before it was made available” to digital service providers, she says. Quinteros Annous, who started her career in PR and marketing, joined TikTok in 2019 to focus on hip-hop and R&B on the platform before her promotion to lead the artist partnerships team in North America.\n\nJosh “J1” Raiford\n\nVp of music programming, SiriusXM/Pandora; program director, Pandora Now\n\nAkim Bryant\n\nDirector of music programming/head of R&B, Pandora\n\n“Launching So So Def Radio on SiriusXM and Pandora for Black Music Month and the 30th anniversary of the iconic label was a big highlight for me,” says New York native Raiford of the special programming in June that highlighted the Jermaine Dupri-founded label’s influential music and history. “When I moved to Atlanta, I saw firsthand the footprint So So Def Records and [Dupri] had on the culture. It was a privilege and honor working with him and his team to make this first-of-its-kind listening experience come to life.”\n\nKenny Smoov\n\nVp of urban formats, Cumulus\n\nCumulus’ new in-depth, behind-the-scenes Your Music First audio series “will have heavy industry impact on R&B and hip-hop acts moving forward,” Smoov says. After the series’ initial launch in the country sector, Janelle Monáe inaugurated the program’s first adult R&B episodes, in which the singer detailed the creation of their “Lipstick Lover” single and their expansion into acting and fashion. As the series gets off the ground, Smoov notes that “[we] have many more amazing projects coming down the pipeline.”\n\nDion Summers\n\nVp of music programming, SiriusXM\n\nRyan Hobbs\n\nSenior director of artist and industry relations, SiriusXM/Pandora\n\nRon “Mills” Triana\n\nAssociate director of hip-hop programming, SiriusXM\n\nFor Triana, continuing to build a “superior brand in entertainment” is one of SiriusXM’s top achievements in the past year. In January, SiriusXM partnered with Drake for two shows at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. “I love the fact that our footprint in urban entertainment has grown with great moments like our Drake at the Apollo concerts,” he says of the shows put on by SiriusXM and the rapper’s own radio program, Sound 42. Triana also cited partnerships with TikTok and SoundCloud, and being part of -emerging artist stories such as those of Ice Spice, Armani White and SleazyWorld Go, as notable highlights for the satellite service.\n\nJoseph Harris\n\nYves Pierre\n\nJacqueline Reynolds-Drumm\n\nRyan Thomson\n\nMusic touring agents, CAA\n\nHarris and Reynolds-Drumm agree that their team has done an “incredible” job of building artists at all levels, strategically positioning Playboi Carti to be an arena-level act and festival headliner, with the rapper anchoring the Rolling Loud festivals in Miami and Los Angeles, as well as Lyrical Lemonade Summer Smash in Chicago. A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie is selling out arenas, while Lil Yachty will perform at Lollapalooza and Outside Lands before embarking on The Field Trip Tour, a 39-date international trek that marks his first tour as a headliner in over five years.\n\nJeremy Holgersen\n\nJoshua Rittenhouse\n\nSenior vps of music, IAG\n\nKyle Carter\n\nVp of music, IAG\n\nRittenhouse calls this “a breakthrough year for IAG in the R&B and hip-hop space,” with the agency — created from the recent merger of APA and Artist Group International — guiding artists at every stage of their careers. Rapper Key Glock earned critical and commercial success, R&B legend Ne-Yo launched an amphitheater tour, Ms. Lauryn Hill announced a Fugees reunion run, and Robert Glasper won the Grammy for best R&B album and also served as producer-headliner of the Blue Note Jazz Festival Napa Valley (see page 76). Meanwhile, icons 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige went on major tours while producing and starring in film and TV projects. APA also signed Keyshia Cole in addition to rising stars including Freddie Dredd, Bktherula, Eem Triplin, Libianca and Yung Bleu.\n\nZach Iser\n\nCaroline Yim\n\nPartners/co-heads of hip-hop and R&B music, WME\n\nJustin Nabors\n\nJordan Stone\n\nMusic agents, WME\n\nThe WME team experienced a “jam-packed” year for superstars and -newcomers alike, with Tyler, The Creator’s upcoming Camp Flog Gnaw selling out in minutes and other A-listers including Snoop Dogg, Future, Little Simz, Summer Walker, Stormzy, Lil Baby, Giveon, Wiz Khalifa and Anderson .Paak continuing their upward trajectories. The team also grew the careers of rising artists such as rapper-singer Doechii, Detroit rapper Babyface Ray, singer-songwriter-producer Victoria Monét and singer-actress Coco Jones, who has many areas “to excel in,” Yim says. “We’re grateful to be a part of her journey.”\n\nCara Lewis\n\nFounder/CEO, Cara Lewis Group\n\nVeteran R&B/hip-hop agent Lewis is proudly “representing the hottest female rappers in the game right now — GloRilla, Ice Spice, BIA and Coi Leray — who all have proven to have a huge trajectory in 2023,” she says, as well as clients like Don Tolver, who headlined 17 shows this summer, and Erykah Badu, whose arena tour played 25 cities. Jill Scott, whom Lewis calls one of the genre’s “female icons,” reembarked on her Who Is Jill Scott? 23rd-anniversary tour in February and headlined the third night of the 2023 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. Bryson Tiller rolled out his first tour in six years in May with the Back and I’m Better Tour, while Clipse’s performance at Pharrell Williams’ Something in the Water festival in June 2022 marked the duo’s first live stint in more than a decade.\n\nBrent Smith\n\nExecutive vp/managing executive, Wasserman Music Los Angeles\n\nCallender\n\nVp, Wasserman Music New York\n\nMallory Smith\n\nManager of music brand partnerships, ­Wasserman Music Los Angeles\n\nLauren Marker\n\nAgent, Wasserman Music Los Angeles\n\n“Our artists are operating at the epicenter of global culture,” says Callender (who professionally uses only his surname). He works alongside the Wasserman team, which has coordinated groundbreaking tours for some of hip-hop and R&B’s biggest stars. Kendrick Lamar’s The Big Steppers Tour took in $110.9 million and sold 929,000 tickets for 73 global shows, while SZA’s SOS tour sold out 54 arenas, moving 675,000 tickets and grossing $100 million. Drake’s It’s All a Blur tour, which opened July 5 in Chicago, will earn $220 million from 930,000 tickets sold over 57 arena shows. Callender guided the rise of Jack Harlow — who had his highest-grossing tour, as well as a lead role in Hulu’s White Men Can’t Jump remake — while the team nurtured rising talent including Omar Apollo, Coast Contra, Maxo Kream and Daniel Caesar.\n\nSteve Ackles\n\nCindy Agi\n\nWarda Baig\n\nGlobal tour promoters, Live Nation\n\nDom Prieto\n\nTour promoter, Live Nation\n\nThe team at Live Nation had a banner year, promoting concerts for some of the biggest names in hip-hop and R&B including Brent Faiyaz’s F*ck the World, It’s a Wasteland Tour and Los Angeles rap sensation Yeat’s North American tour supporting recent hit project LYFË. “It’s great to be a part of a company that continually invests in bringing on new promoters to provide unique perspectives,” says Prieto, who promoted a sold-out U.S. tour for Syracuse, N.Y., rapper Toosii. “I’m eager to keep this momentum going and continue to foster long-term relationships with the common goal of empowering artists around the world.”\n\nDave Chappelle\n\nRobert Glasper\n\nCo-founders, Blue Note Jazz Festival Napa Valley\n\nChappelle and Glasper helped organize the second annual R&B- and hip-hop-focused Blue Note Jazz Festival Napa Valley, which took place July 28-30. Chappelle was the weekend’s host for headliners Mary J. Blige, Nas and Chance the Rapper, and Glasper was the artist-in-residence, performing alongside De La Soul, Bilal, Lalah Hathaway and others. “I take a great deal of pride in what Dave, Blue Note and I have started in Napa, with the Blue Note Jazz Festival bringing together some of my greatest heroes and peers from hip-hop to R&B to jazz,” Glasper says. “This partnership has created a space for us to celebrate our music, creativity, culture and, more than anything, our fans. We know none of this would be possible without them, so this festival is essentially our thank-you letter to them.”\n\nTariq Cherif\n\nMatt Zingler\n\nCo-founders/co-CEOs, Rolling Loud\n\nRolling Loud has grown quite a bit in the eight years since its inaugural one-day show in Miami. Now, with the mission to take the festival’s experience “global, complete with the best talent and unique activations that make every Rolling Loud special,” according to Zingler, it added many international festivals, including in Thailand, the Netherlands and Germany. Rolling Loud also returned to Portugal for a second consecutive year. “For us, there has been nothing better than putting rap music on a global stage,” he says, “especially in 2023 as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of hip-hop.”\n\nMari Davies\n\nVp of talent and booking, Live Nation Urban\n\nMalcolm Gray\n\nMarketing and partnerships director, Live Nation Urban\n\n“In the past year, we’ve launched and grown various festivals, tours and live events across the country specifically catered to celebrating Black culture in an authentic way,” Gray says, pointing to a successful Roots Picnic 2023 headlined by Ms. Lauryn Hill and Usher and the return of the Strength of a Woman Festival headlined by Mary J. Blige and Hill with surprise guests including Missy Elliott and Ciara. LNU also promoted a special one-off symphony show with Summer Walker in Atlanta, as well as tours by Ari Lennox, Jill Scott, DVSN, Davido and the upcoming Raphael Saadiq Revisits Tony! Toni! Toné! The company’s goal for the rest of the year, Gray says, is “providing opportunities to a diverse group of people in every city we activate in.”\n\nGary Guidry\n\nPartner/CEO, Black Promoters Collective; CEO, G-Squared Events\n\nBill Ingram\n\nPartner/CFO, Black Promoters Collective; president, Platinum Productions\n\nTroy Brown\n\nPartner/chief marketing officer, Black Promoters Collective; president, one50one\n\nShelby Joyner\n\nPartner/president, Black Promoters Collective; owner, SJ Events\n\nSulaiman Mausi\n\nPartner/senior vp, Black Promoters Collective; vp, The Right Productions\n\nWalt Reeder Jr.\n\nPartner/talent buyer, Black Promoters Collective; president/CEO, Big Bloc Entertainment\n\nTwo years after launching the Black Promoters Collective, the coalition of six Black-owned concert companies has “expanded our reach by curating amazing rising-star acts through our Club BPC property” and worked with American rapper Tink for her sold-out nationwide tour, Guidry says. “A highlight for us this year was promoting our first comedy tour, Straight Jokes, No Chaser, featuring Mike Epps, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, Earthquake and D.C. Young Fly, and having the legendary group New Edition partner with us again for another successful run,” he adds. The collective’s success in and commitment to moving the culture of Black live music forward remains driven by its inspiring founding motto: “For us, by us, with us.”\n\nHeather Lowery\n\nPresident/CEO, Femme It Forward\n\nThe last year was full of notable achievements for Lowery. In November, she and her team organized the inaugural GiveHerFlowHERS Awards gala, which honored R&B and hip-hop artists like Latto, Muni Long and Victoria Monét. Femme It Forward’s mentorship program, Next Gem Femme, returned for a third year, and the company’s inaugural She Runs This panel series brought together women including members of Salt-N-Pepa, MC Lyte and Lil’ Kim to discuss 50 years of hip-hop. Femme also promoted Brent Faiyaz’s F*ck the World, It’s a Wasteland Tour and Ambré’s The Wild Magnolia Tour. “My biggest achievement is having the platform to empower and celebrate women of color in music,” Lowery says. “While there’s so much to look back at and be proud of at Femme It Forward, it’s incredible to know there’s so much more to come.”\n\nEllen Lu\n\nFestival talent buyer, Goldenvoice\n\nAfter taking 2020-2022 off due to the pandemic, the annual Camp Flog Gnaw festival, promoted by Goldenvoice in partnership with Tyler, The Creator, announced its 2023 edition on May 31 and “completely sold out in an hour without a lineup,” Lu says. Teased by Tyler in his cameo in the music video for the Kendrick Lamar and Baby Keem song “The Hillbillies,” the event’s sales success “is a testament to the level of trust Tyler and Camp Flog Gnaw have built with fans throughout the years,” Lu says, “and we plan to deliver on that trust.”\n\nJonathan Ramos\n\nVp of global touring, AEG Presents\n\nAdam Stroul\n\nTalent buyer, AEG Presents Rocky Mountains; co-owner, Cervantes\n\nStroul, co-owner of Denver’s Cervantes music venue and talent buyer for AEG Presents Rocky Mountains, has been the promotional force behind hundreds of impressive shows in Colorado. But he’s most proud of an upcoming hip-hop concert booked for Sept. 8 in Englewood, Colo. “Hosting a sold-out Wu-Tang and Run the Jewels [show] with Deltron 3030 at Fiddler’s Green is a career highlight of mine as a promoter and a fan,” Stroul says of the hip-hop event featuring Hieroglyphics frontman and Gorillaz contributor Del the Funky Homosapien, who is celebrating his iconic 2000 concept album, Deltron 3030.\n\nSherrese Clarke Soares\n\nFounder/CEO, HarbourView Equity Partners\n\nSince entering the music asset investment business at the end of 2021, Clarke Soares and her HarbourView firm have been forging a path different from most other private equity-backed entities, which tend to invest in rock and pop music. “I strive to be a prolific buyer of Black and brown music,” she says. “I am proud of our portfolio’s exposure to over 3,500 hip-hop and R&B titles including titles from Mobb Deep, Usher, Musiq Soulchild, Jill Scott, Nicki Minaj, Michael Jackson and Jhené Aiko through various acquisitions.” In its latest deals, the firm acquired certain but unspecified music assets of Nelly and Wiz Khalifa. Since its inception, the nearly 2-year-old HarbourView made what sources described at the time as its biggest asset purchase to date in September 2022 by paying an estimated $325 million for SoundHouse, which controlled royalty income payments from recordings by Tech N9ne and Trey Songz, among others. An even bigger deal may be in the offing as a HarbourView-led consortium is among the bidders competing to buy a majority stake in BET Media Group Paramount Global.\n\nRene McLean\n\nPartner/founding adviser, Influence Media Partners\n\nInfluence Media Partners is pursuing an investment strategy in current hip-hop and R&B music, with over $100 million spent in buying music assets from those genres so far. That strategy includes the acquisition of Future’s song catalog, a ground-breaking deal that recognized the increasing valuations of rap catalogs. Other deals made last year include songwriter-producer collective The Stereotypes (Bruno Mars, Cardi B) and hit-maker Smash David (Big Sean, Khalid). Influence also recently announced deals with multihyphenates like 30 Roc (Roddy Ricch, Yo Gotti), Dre Moon (Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj), The Rudeboyz (Maluma, The Weeknd) and a new partnership with Grammy-nominated rapper-producer Logic, which includes chart-topping tracks like multiplatinum single “1-800-273-8255,” featuring Alessia Cara and Khalid; “Everyday,” with Marshmello; and “Homicide,” featuring Eminem. “Following that, Influence is in advanced negotiations with a legendary A-list multihyphenate,” McLean says. “This partnership will be Influence’s first to encompass recorded-music rights, name, image and likeness exclusivity, as well as film and TV [intellectual property] development all under one deal.”\n\nCatherine Brewton\n\nVp of creative, Atlanta, BMI\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, multiple BMI events returned to live programming in the past year. The 2022 BMI R&B Hip-Hop Awards, where Busta Rhymes received the BMI Icon Award, was held in Miami in September. “As our first live event post-pandemic, my team and I were able to put together a unique experience by bringing it to [nightclub] LIV Miami, which gave a fresher, more celebratory vibe to the event,” Brewton says. In March, BMI held its 2023 Trailblazers of Gospel Music Awards honoring Dr. Bobby Jones and David and Tamela Mann. BMI also recently held a three-day writers camp in Bowling Green, Ky., in collaboration with Grammy-winning songwriter-producer Rodney Jerkins, which brought together writers from country, pop and R&B. “I’m so proud of the work we’re able to do at BMI,” Brewton says, “to provide an atmosphere where songwriters and producers from different genres can collaborate and create music with their peers.”\n\nNicole George-Middleton\n\nSenior vp of membership, ASCAP; executive director, The ASCAP Foundation\n\nThis year, during Black Music Month, ASCAP celebrated 50 years of hip-hop with an ASCAP Experience session on June 21 and a party the following day. “I’m also proud that we launched an ­ASCAP Foundation scholarship for [historically Black colleges and university] students,” says George-Middleton, “and that our ASCAP Aspire internship program for HBCU students interested in music careers has gained so much momentum.” The program is entering its fourth year. “It’s so gratifying to be able to cultivate the next generation of R&B and hip-hop creators and executives,” she says. “The students have inspired us as much as I hope our programs have helped and inspired them.”\n\nSean Glover\n\nDirector of industry engagement, SoundExchange\n\nOver the past year, Glover says SoundExchange has “successfully identified and disbursed millions of dollars” to hip-hop and R&B artists through a program that analyzes unassociated tracks that have generated revenue and then notifies artists about their unclaimed royalties. “I take immense pride in SoundExchange’s response to the ever-evolving music landscape and the growing significance of the R&B and hip-hop genres,” he says, adding that the program “is the epitome of maximizing an artist’s royalties to ensure that they receive every single penny that they are owed.”\n\nMario Prins\n\nVp of creative services, SESAC\n\nFor the second year in a row, a hip-hop artist was SESAC’s songwriter of the year at the performing rights organization’s annual music awards, as the honor went to Jack Harlow. Prins and his team curated an event based on two turntables, one mixer, one DJ and an MC. “I’ve never witnessed such a unique, innovative award ceremony,” he says. Prins and his team have also signed several top players in hip-hop — Blxst, DJ Swish and Papiverr — while SESAC member Burna Boy landed his first Billboard No. 1 on the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart with the song “Last Last.” All achievements have contributed to SESAC’s increased market share and repertory growth within hip-hop and R&B, according to Prins. “It’s a real blessing to be a music executive DJ, as well as a family man. This is not only a job. Music is my passion.”"
