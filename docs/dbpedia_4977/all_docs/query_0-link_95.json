        "text": "(Photos by Doreen Stratton)\n\nThere are times when life treats you with a piece of knowledge about your hometown and you tuck it away, unless it pops up in your memory bank at an unexpected moment. Eleven years had passed before it happened for me.\n\nIt was Saturday, April 6, 2013, when a Historical Marker was unveiled at the corners of State and Main Streets in Doylestown Borough. The marker dedicated this intersection as the trail for the Lenni Lenape (Le-NAH-pee) Nation as they traveled from the east and from the south to their destination, the Delaware River.\n\nThe Doylestown Historical Society with assistance from Melissa Cornick, a journalist, and strategic communication specialist (for professional activities), coordinated the day’s event which included a lecture by Professor Evan Pritchard, descendant of the Micmac people (part of the Algonquin Nation).\n\nEarlier that same day Professor Pritchard, an Algonquin Historian, had lectured to a packed audience at the Doylestown Presbyterian Church. I was impressed with Pritchard describing the Lenape historic trade route, the stop at State and Main Streets, their ancient land use, and the pathways along what became Routes 202 and 611. At the conclusion of the well-gathered dedication at the Marker, there was a lively afternoon Pow Wow at the Doylestown Historical Society Park.\n\nPritchard’s visit to Doylestown also had allowed him to tour some of the tunnels which remain below our town’s streets. Thousands of years ago these “tunnels” were caves where the Lenape, a nomadic indigenous tribe, rested after traveling from the shores of the New Jersey Atlantic Ocean. (I like to believe those tunnels, thousands of years later, were safe places for fugitive slaves in the 1800s)\n\nEleven years after the Lenape Marker had its dedication, the front-page April 4, 2024, edition of the Bucks County Herald reported:\n\n“Bucks County Historical Society’s Doylestown Twp. Land eyed for luxury homes.\n\n“Custom home builder Richard Zaveta outlined his concept for an upscale community on 24 acres owned by the Bucks County Historical Society in Doylestown Township at the supervisors’ meeting Tuesday.”\n\nhttps://buckscountyherald.com/stories/bucks-county-historical-societys-doylestown-twp-land-eyed-for-luxury-zaveta-custom-homes-fonthill-mercer-museum,43733\n\nWhere, you ask, is this land?\n\nWhen you drive south on Main Street in Doylestown Borough, across from the new WAWA is a thicket of trees—24 acres—fanning from Main Street, bordering the bypass until the trees bump against a large development of single-family homes. This land is in the Borough’s neighbor, Doylestown Township. Years ago, this acreage was three or four times beyond that number when the land was either woodland or farms.\n\n(24 acres from the google map)\n\nSOME HISTORY\n\nHidden in that forest once was a popular venue called The Hustle Inn, where teens gathered and danced to live bands. In the early 1940s, Ellis and Anita Smith purchased an 1848 farmhouse and barn, and converted the second floor of the barn into what would become The Hustle Inn. It operated from 1946 until 1966. I had relocated to California for ten years so missed the 1964 drama when outsiders came into town, resulting in a fight involving three hundred people.\n\nhttps://patch.com/pennsylvania/doylestown/this-was-doylestown-1964\n\nThe Smiths sold their property in 1967. Eventually it was purchased by the Matthews School of Fort Washington. They renovated the barn as a dormitory for young boys.\n\nThe January 12, 1970, The Morning Call, published an article about the end of an era when a fire destroyed the building formerly called The Hustle Inn. No one was inside the structure at the time of the fire. A cultural piece of Doylestown History was ashes but is still cherished in a private Facebook page.\n\nImage of The Hustle Inn — Courtesy of Spruance Library, Mercer Museum\n\nThen, early in 1991 the acreage was carved away for 99 single family homes. I often wonder, could the Lenape have paused there to rest, eat, and drink? (there was water in those woods). This area was rich with springs, many now gone due to extensive land loss. And where the Lenape Crossing Marker is placed, there was a natural spring from which this indigenous tribe drew water, and how “The Fountain House” received its name.\n\nOn April 18 The Herald published an opinion from Doylestown resident Mary Hughes expressing her concerns about this proposed development. She mentions “ . . . the vast number of historic objects and equipment . . . which many people outside of the organization may be unaware.”\n\nhttps://buckscountyherald.com/stories/historical-societys-proposed-land-sale-at-odds-with-its-mission,45618\n\nThis past May I walked onto the woods through an access road. I’m not embarrassed to admit I’m a tree hugger. Standing on the access trail, I was at a loss for words gazing up at the canopy of green. We’re losing precious land. I strongly encourage the Township and the Historical Society to consider an archeological study and an environmental impact study before any bulldozer knocks down any tree.\n\nThe calendar has flipped from February to March. Gone is Black History Month replaced with Women’s History Month.\n\nMy March 2024 calendar from the National Museum of African American History & Culture (NMAAHC) celebrates an image of six African American nurses, staff at St. Luke Hospital in Columbia South Carolina. They learned their skills at a hospital established sometime after 1907 by Dr. Matilda Evans.\n\nLET ME TELL YOU ABOUT HER WOMEN’S HISTORY\n\nBorn 1866 in Aiken, South Carolina, as the oldest of three children, Dr. Evans is remembered for her healing as a successful OB/GYN, surgeon and children’s health care advocate within and beyond her home community.\n\nIn 1892, after graduating from Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, Matilda Evans entered Women’s Medical College of Philadelphia. During the 19th and early 20th Century, the medical field for African American women limited them to training at either in Canada or Europe, unless fortunate enough for acceptance at a northern school or a Historical Black College or University (HBCU).\n\nPrior to Dr. Evans entering Philadelphia Medical College, male peers disrespected Black and white women, believing all women were “ . . . too delicate to endure the physical requirements of clinical practice”. But in 1892, Ann Preston, the first woman graduate from the College’s medical school, founded Women’s Hospital of Philadelphia, creating an environment for women to thrive in the medical field.\n\nAfter earning her M.D. in 1897, Dr. Evans considered becoming a missionary doctor in Africa; but as it was not in her future; instead, she returned to South Carolina and became the first licensed African American woman doctor specializing in obstetrics, gynecology, and surgery. Her clients were wealthy white women from which the money earned provided the freedom for her to treat poor Black women and children.\n\nIn 1901 she founded Taylor Lane Hospital and Training School for Nurses—the first Black hospital in the city of Columbia available for her to treat African Americans. Then a few years later, she established St. Luke’s Hospital, also in Columbia, the image on my calendar. The fourteen room-twenty bed facility, under her operation until 1918, would become the fourth hospital in the country for training nurses.\n\nShe advocated for Black children’s health care in schools, promoted vaccinations as well as cleanliness and manners. She believed health care should be a citizenship right and a governmental responsibility. Over the years she adopted seven children and fostered nearly an additional two dozen. She was known for her visits to the sick patients riding bicycles, horses, or buggies.\n\nDr. Matilda Evans created the Negro Health Association of South Carolina, volunteered in the Medical Service Corps of the United States Army during World War I, and founded a weekly newspaper: The Negro Health Journal of South Carolina.\n\nEvans loved to swim and dance, was a knitter and played the piano. Her legacy includes an honor in her name from the Richland Memorial Hospital in Columbia. She died at the age of 69 on November 17, 1935.\n\nThank you, Wikipedia, your page fulfilled my curiosity to discover more about Dr. Matilda Evans, a woman who enriched the lives of a marginalized community through healing and teaching.\n\n“ . . . but at last all the other nations of the earth seemed to conspire against the negro race, . . . Thus this race of human beings has been singled out, owing to the accident of color, or to their peculiar fitness for certain kinds of labor, for infamy and misfortune; . . . a slavery confined entirely to negroes.”\n\n(An excerpt from — The History of Slavery and The Slave Trade, Ancient and Modern\n\nCompiled from authentic materials by W.G. Blake, Columbus, Ohio:\n\nPublished and sold exclusively by H. Miller 1860)\n\n******\n\nDuring my education at Central Bucks High School, the only thing I learned about Black History was: There was a Civil War and President Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves.\n\nBefore European explorers stepped on the soil of Africa and discovered those swarthy people with tangled hair and inexplicable dialects, slavery had persisted throughout the ages of civilization. Along with gold and timber, Africans were considered Cargo with an identity less than human, a distinction which still remains four hundred years later.\n\nUnlike immigrants or refugees, or settlers, or asylum seekers who had departed their homelands either through choice or terror, those expatriates often arrived with snippets of their heritage, be it a suitcase stuffed with precious memories, a photograph or a book or a sprout from a mature fruit tree, sometimes with nothing but the clothes on their backs, they arrived in America with Hope.\n\nAfricans arrived in America without their culture, their identity, their Freedom nor their Hope.\n\nGrowing up in Doylestown prior to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, I failed to comprehend how my skin tone reached back to Africa. “Black” or “African American” or “Bi-Racial” were ethnic identities which never gained preference until after the Civil Rights Movement. Tagging along with my parents on election days, I also never comprehended how my parents’ Right to Vote in Bucks County was not available to “Negroes” in communities across the South. The racial injustice, lynching and riots across the South were also foreign to me, a twelve-year old “colored” girl living in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.\n\nI’m certain I wasn’t alone in my ignorance about my African origin. It was absent in my consciousness until my 1999 visit to Ghana. My Motherland. Since then many other Black Americans have journeyed to the continent in search of their lineage. Just as white Americans travel to their ancestral lands across Europe, Black Americans journeyed to the Motherland and retrieved the spiritual and cultural inheritance discarded on the beaches of West Africa when our ancestors were shoved in the belly of a slave ship. We returned to America from our Sojourn buoyed with the hunger to search for our African beginnings and fill in the empty spaces of our ancestral lineage.\n\n(Doreen Stratton Photo)\n\nThis past July 29, forty relatives spanning five generations of Stratton’s gathered for our third family reunion and to celebrate the unveiling of a Doylestown Historical plaque which was placed on the wall next to our front door.\n\nIt was 1887 when my Grandparents—Joseph B. and Lillie A. Stratton—settled and raised their eight children in Doylestown on Ashland Street. My Grandfather “JB” was a veteran of the Civil War, having served in the Union Navy on the USS Calypso; Grandmother Lillie, before she met and married my Grandfather, was a teacher. https://thebucksundergroundrailroad.com/2016/05/21/letter-from-the-civil-war/\n\nMy father Sid was the last of the eight children, born in 1900, just four months before Grandfather “JB” died. As the last of the eight he remained at our home where he brought his bride—my mother Dot—and eventually raised me and my five siblings. Today, it is the same home where I and my sister Judith live.\n\nFragments of my family’s Black History\n\nMy father saved pieces of paper that were road maps about our family’s legacy. The family archives consist of prints, maps, letters, receipts and photographs. Some of these items from the collection eventually found their way into a spindle bound, 124-page book compiled by J. Kurt Spence, Researcher at the Doylestown Historical Society. A copy is retained in the museum’s research library.\n\nThe walls and rooms of our home seep with memories of joy, tragedy, births and deaths. Whenever I shuffled through old photographs from the early 1920s, my Grandmother smiles, surrounded by friends and relatives she had welcomed in the home. Our only photo of “JB” features an imposing portrait of a proud face enhanced with a mustache and mutton chops. As the years passed, color photographs depict my parents—stewards of the next generation—embracing family and friends at barbeques on the patio, relaxing on the lawns or while gathering around the dining room table, celebrating Birthdays, Thanksgivings and Christmas.\n\nLillie A. Stratton (Stratton Family Archives)\n\nDriving to the next Central Bucks School Board meeting, Lillie crowded my thoughts; as if whispering in my ear, reminding me the value of Teachers. I am in awe of Lillie, a widow who nurtured eight children into self-assured adults. Interestingly, our family includes Teachers among my father’s siblings; and that calling To Teach continues into the 4th generation.\n\nIn the early 1900s only a few one-room school houses were scattered in communities surrounding the Doylestown Borough School, the school where my uncles and aunts, who after graduation excelled beyond “ . . . peculiar fitness . . . “. It was the school which graduated a Doctor, a Dentist, a Cleric, a Teacher and a Musician, Blacks whose History would be Erased if the Central Bucks School Board follows the oppressive epidemic sweeping across America.\n\nThe Central Bucks School Board is dominated by 6 members whose recent policies have restricted preventative health, denied gender rights, banned books and suppressed freedom of speech. I fear their next agenda is to remove Black History from our District’s curriculum.\n\nMy Black History as well as the histories of every Black resident in the Central Bucks School District matters. It is not a curriculum for removal from My Central Bucks High School.\n\nDuring the mid-1960s I was employed at Explosive Technology (ET) an R&D company in Fairfield, California with Security-based contracts awarded from NASA and the Department of Defense. ET, designated as a SECRET facility, was located on the grounds of a dismantled Nike missile station. Employees were either granted SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL Clearances.\n\nMy SECRET Clearance included responsibility as Assistant Security Officer, protecting the CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET documents secured in a combination-locked single drawer filing cabinet next to my desk. A cardboard sleeve with the word LOCKED rested in the cabinet’s handle and if the cabinet was not locked, on the other side of the card, was the word OPENED. I was authorized to record the names of employees (also with clearances) whenever they requested access to any document. Each document inside the cabinet was listed in a log with a number that tracked the activity of any specific document when handled and/or read by a cleared employee.\n\nOn occasion we were visited by a DOD Security Inspector who would review my log’s register or question me about anything pertaining to the classified documents under ET’s control. We were not authorized to declassify any document; however on some visits the Inspector ordered me to declassify an item which he then instructed me to burn and record its demise next to its title in the register.\n\nIf I had ever left a classified document on my desk, I would’ve been fired on the spot!\n\nA FAILED KINGMAKER\n\nYesterday, August 3 #TFG appeared in US Federal Court, Washington, DC. Also yesterday I finished reading the #Indictment detailing the allegations filed by Special Counsel Jack Smith, United States Department of Justice in the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida. The #Indictment is against former president Donald J. Trump and his personal aide, Waltine Nauta. Wow, what a read!\n\nFrom the first page to the last, the #Indictment depicts the perfidious activity in words and photographs of #TFG and his flunky shuffling highly classified documents around as if engrossed in a game of musical chairs. Some of the images in the #Indictment displayed boxes stacked on boxes, with some lids rumpled and torn. I gasped in anger viewing those photographs; and infuriated when reading the #Indictment which listed documents marked either:\n\nCONFIDENTIAL//SECRET//TOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN //SPECIALHANDLING//ORCON\n\nIf you’re curious about those acronyms, google them. I shudder imagining the “visitors” who had possibly walked or roamed throughout the halls and rooms of Mar-a-Lago and out of curiosity, opened then rummaged through any of those boxes containing highly classified documents.\n\n#TFG has been charged with 37 Counts that fall under Sections of U.S.C. 18. All of them are related to Concealing, Withholding, Obstructing, Conspiring, Making False Statements and Retaining National Defense Information associated with Classified Documents.\n\nWaltine Nauta’s Counts also fall under Sections of U.S.C. 18: Concealing, Withholding, Scheming, Conspiring and Making False Statements. Prison time for Nauta and/or #TFG Counts is 20 years each; a few are 5 years. And each Count carries hefty fines.\n\nPlease Dear Followers, download the #Indictment. It’s a good read and will take about an hour out of your day.\n\nWHAT IS RULE 53?\n\nThe talking heads on cable have begun discussing the #TFG possibly never spending one day in prison and the need to televise his trial. Unfortunately Federal trials are not allowed to be televised. Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure prohibits the photographing or broadcasting of judicial proceedings in criminal cases in Federal courts.\n\nOnly *John Roberts* Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, can lift the Rule, allowing this trial to be seen by all of America.\n\nTime to petition Chief Justice John Roberts!\n\nStay #Woke because this will be The Trial to #SaveAmericanDemocracy.\n\n. . . and posts have already begun to appear on Facebook, people sharing memories along with a special photograph of either their “Dad”, or their “Pops”, or their “Pa”, or their “Father”, or their “Daddy”. I and my three brothers and two sisters stuck with “Daddy”.\n\nFor one hundred and twenty-three years, we have lived in the same Doylestown house where my father was born in May 1900; and where he chose to spend the last few weeks of his life when he passed on April 7, 1993. Weeks later at his memorial service, here are the words I spoke:\n\nWhen a person leaves this Earth, their last piece of legacy is defined on a line printed on the death certificate. So it seemed appropriate that my brother Chris chose to have written on Daddy’s certificate\n\n“A MUSICIAN AND A GARDENER”\n\nGrayson Savoy (Sid) Stratton\n\nThroughout my father’s life he was many things to many people. He was a printer, an elevator operator, a factory worker, a film extra, a writer, a custodian, a Chauffer, a Civic Activist, a tennis player and an orchestra leader.\n\nAfter he retired, he spent many hours tending to his home, mostly the grounds and gardens he loved so much. His flowers were the envy of the neighborhood. His vegetable garden burst with edibles, and he would boast, “Me and God made this”.\n\nFor awhile after retirement, he continued playing music at weddings and special affairs. One memory I still hold is how, every Saturday afternoon, late in the day, he would practice scales on his saxophone. If it was a warm day like today and if you were outside sitting on the grass or patio, you would be able to hear the mellow sighs of his saxophone floating down from his second-floor window.\n\nFor several weeks before his death, he was confined to his bed in his room. During the last week of his life, while sitting with him one day, I looked around his room and covering the walls was the saga of our family. A History of his life. Looking at the old marriage license of his parents, photographs of my Grandmother and Grandfather; and my Father’s Brothers; and pictures of our home covered in snow and another flooded with summer light.\n\nThen also there were the hospice nurses who came to care for Daddy—they are truly Angels on Earth. He would tell them stories from those framed mementos, stories about the Life of my Family.\n\nAlmost two months ago, Daddy asked that we get all the Family together. My brothers and sisters did have the chance to see Daddy and say their Good-byes. Four days before Easter Sunday, Daddy left us to meet his Creator.\n\nHe made his Peace.\n\nBecause a Family is also a Community, I know that he knows all of us are here at this memorial to say our Good-Byes. He would like that.\n\nDaddy planted his gardens with the music of Life. Although my brothers and sisters are as different as flowers in a Spring garden, and the tunes we sing are in different keys, we have in us a Sense of Family. The pictures on the bedroom walls give us the music of hope that we can sing to our children and grandchildren. Their roots are deep in the soil at our Ashland Street house.\n\nMy father was a musician and a gardener.\n\nDaddy, may you spend this Father’s Day in Heaven with your brothers, sisters, and ‘JB’ and Lily.\n\nA few weeks ago Joe Montone, Doylestown resident who produces events in town, invited me to become one of four locals to premiere “Story Hood”, an evening of stories about Doylestown to an audience of forty people. Each of our stories will be archived in the Spruance Library at the Mercer Museum in Doylestown. This is my story about the visitation of a Spirit.\n\nIt was 1975. After living in California for ten years, fate was telling me it was time to come home: I was laid off from my job at Atari; my in-laws were selling their home where I, my husband Rich and our two children lived; and then a message from home notified me my father was unwell.\n\nRich and I packed our stuff in a U Haul truck and along with two German Shepherds, a cat and Melanie 3; and Mark 12. We drove across America to Doylestown, Pennsylvania. After storing our possessions in my parents’ garage, we lived at their house on Ashland Street for several months before finding a rental that allowed pets and children.\n\nThe House at 242 North Broad Street, a single standing brick house, about a hundred years old. It reminded me of those New Orleans “shotgun houses”. From the front door I could look down the hall, through to a room which I believe was once the kitchen with its squared fireplace large enough for an iron kettle. Then beyond there, a kitchen that was added later.\n\nAlso when entering the front door, before walking down a hallway, on the left was a parlor room with a fireplace (now closed and papered over with an ugly print). Across from the parlor room, stairs led to the second floor with a bathroom and three bed rooms.\n\nThe ceilings were 12 feet high with deep sills where house plants enjoyed morning sun. The ugly wallpaper was everywhere, but I really loved that old house!\n\n(By the way, 242 was scraped, along with a few other structures on that block, replaced with the County parking garage).\n\nWeirdness\n\nOnce settled, I invited my parents over for dinner, a huge thank you for putting up with us for all those months. I welcomed them at the front door, gesturing them inside. Mom continued walking down the hall to the next room, her artistic eye critiquing my hippy style of decorating. I turned to Daddy who’d paused at the doorway leading into the parlor. He was staring at the fireplace. In a whisper he said, “Oh … My Aunt Pressie was laid out here.” He added that he was six years old but remembered being in this house.\n\nWow! I thought, How weird! My ten years in California had connected me to some weird people. I just assumed this “Aunt Pressie” was an elder who had lived among the small circle of African Americans in Doylestown. I never thought anymore about it.\n\nI went on unemployment, then worked for a medical equipment distributer, fiddled around with writing, and took up running the streets and roads of Doylestown.\n\nWhen Melanie was10 years old, she came to me and said, “Mommy, there’s somebody in my room.” I asked her what she meant by “… somebody” and she said, “When I go to bed, I see Her standing in the corner by my closet.” Now to reach Melanie’s room, you passed through Mark’s room. Melanie’s room was small and above the kitchen. I’m guessing the kitchen below and Melanie’s room were added at the same time.\n\nShe took me to her room and pointed to a small closet in the corner. Then she said, “When I get into bed, She comes over and sits at the end of my bed.” On her bed, her stuffed animals were piled at the foot of her bed, as if blocking She from sitting there. Melanie said the visitations started a few nights ago. She wasn’t frightened, only curious why this visitor was in her room. Listening to Melanie describe these visits was acceptable to me. During my years in California one of my co-workers taught classes in metaphysics—auras, meditation, and healing. Strange things do happen.\n\nA Failed Seance\n\nA month or so later, when my niece Sara traveled to Doylestown for an Ashland Street family gathering, I shared the visitations with her. She suggested, “Let’s have a séance in her room.” Sara and I set candles and incense in Melanie’s room. We sat on the floor with knees crossed. Sara began speaking to the Room “We are here and feel safe with you. Please tell us who you are.” We sat for nearly fifteen minutes and I finally said, “Sara, nothing’s coming through. We gotta get back to the house with this food.”\n\nWe rented 242 N. Broad until 1983 when the owner decided to move into the house. We found another rental and shortly after that I was employed in former Congressman Peter H. Kostmayer’s district office in Doylestown.\n\nThe Past is Here\n\nIn the mid-1990s I moved into the family’s home on Ashland Street. Around 2007 people everywhere began researching information about their family histories or taking DNA tests, or traveling to ancestral homes, or digging through library archives and old photographs. That’s when my family, during one of our Sunday gatherings at Ashland Street rummaged through photographs saved by my Grandmother and Father. It was a pleasant summer afternoon. Sitting on the porch we passed around faded sepia photographs of relatives, many without names penciled on the backside, strangers possibly known only to my parents, both now dead.\n\nIn the early 1990s when Genealogist Joseph Romeo had documented our Stratton lineage, he discovered Tobias Stratton, a Free Black born 1767 in Philadelphia. Mr. Romeo carried the Stratton generations to the present, listing my brothers and sisters born to my parents, Savoy and Dorothy Stratton.\n\nWe have only one photograph of my Grandfather Joseph B Stratton, whom we affectionately refer to as “JB”. While discussions continued about photographs, I began reading the histories of JB’s three daughters born in his first marriage. After his wife died, JB kept the family together by marrying his deceased wife’s sister, a common arrangement in the 19th Century. In 1863 JB entered the Civil War serving a year in the Union Navy and returned home in 1864 to his daughters and second wife. No children were born from his second wife who died in 1875.\n\nIt would be another ten years before JB married Lilly, the woman who would become my Grandmother. I admit, although the Genealogist’s research was part of our family archives, I’d never paid any attention. Now I began reading the brief histories of JB’s three daughters from his first marriage. I realized These were my father’s half-sisters!\n\nPriscilla—1858; Amelia—1860; and Matilda—1864\n\nFirst-born Priscilla was widowed twice; bore nine children, including a set of twins, stillborn. Sometime after her second husband died in 1896, she relocated to Doylestown from Philadelphia. JB and Lilly had already been settled at our Ashland Street home; Priscilla moved into 242 N. Broad Street. I stopped reading and shouted, “My God! JB’s daughter Priscilla lived at our Broad Street house!” Now I was shaking. “She died in 1906 and she’s buried in Doylestown Cemetery!”\n\nWhile everybody gathered around, we never noticed Melanie hovering over some unidentified scattered photographs. “Hey”, she said, holding up one of them. “This is the woman who was in my bedroom.” We stared at the image. Melanie insisted this was the woman who stood in the corner of her bedroom and then sat at the foot of her bed.\n\nPRISCILLA NEWMAN\n\nImmediately I called the cemetery but being Sunday, had to leave a message asking the location of Priscilla Newman who died in 1906. Instead we drove over to the cemetery, anticipating we’d find Pressie’s marker. We split up and roamed the paths, searching for Priscilla Newman. No luck; but since we were there, we stopped at the grave where my father, mother and an uncle are buried.\n\nThe following day the custodian at the cemetery called me. “Priscilla Newman is buried in the Pauper Section. I’ll meet you there.”\n\nHe had a stone where she was buried. This section is immediately across from the section where my family’s headstone is sited. While standing at the stone marking Pressie’s grave, Melanie described how the day before she had been drawn to this space of grass.\n\nWe siblings, descendants of JB Stratton, pooled our money and purchased a marker for Pressie’s grave. My father was six years old when he had walked into 242 N. Broad Street, startled as he whispered, “Aunt Pressie was laid out in front of the fireplace.” Was he aware he was her half-brother? Yet being only six years old, my Grandmother possibly instructed him to call her “Aunt Pressie”.\n\nSeventy years after Pressie was laid in the ground, I believe she was waiting for my family to move into 242 N. Broad Street so that we, her ancestors would place the headstone she so well deserved.\n\nIt is the time to reflect on 1619, when the first Africans set their feet on American soil. They were my ancestors. I identify as an African American even though half of my DNA traces to a few European nations. So . . . when someone had told me, “go back to Africa!” — I did . . . in 1999, I set my feet on the African soil of Ghana.\n\nPrior to that, I’d never held a kinship to the Continent. Growing up in Doylestown where only a handful of ‘colored people’ lived, the awareness of my ancestral heritage was limited. At age 11 or 12, leafing through the pages of National Geographic Magazines, discovering black and white pictures of Africans with dark skin in loin cloth or tufts of grass covering their ‘privates’; and women with exposed breasts (always) adorned with necklaces of animal teeth or bone, staring at those images, I asked myself, Is that me? I had never realized my ancestral genealogy reached back to Africa.\n\nGo Back and Get It\n\nMy August 12, 2020 blog post–Sankofa–the Ghanaian proverb meaning Go back and Get It. How ironic! When I went “back”, I returned to America with pride for my legacy. That post had described my African American cultural tour of Cape Coast Castle (now a designated historical site) built by the Swedes in 1653 to protect their plundered goods. The tour included a second castle which I now share for this Black History Month. Elmina Castle was built in 1482 by the Portuguese. Also a fort and designated historical site, this massive structure became the settlement where gold, timber, and later, Africans were plundered and shipped across the globe. Elmina has the distinction as the site of The Door of No Return, the last image Africans saw before herded onto ships. Although the Portuguese loaded Africans on the ship— Sau Joao Bautista, English pirates on The White Lion raided the Portuguese ship in the Gulf Coast (now Mexico) and carried some “twenty” Africans to the Virginia coast of what is now Hampton Roads. The year was 1619.\n\nOur docent for the Elmina tour led us into a cobblestoned patio enclosed on all sides by three levels of balconies. He pointed to the highest balcony—the headquarters of the fort’s Portuguese leader. “The Elmina governor lived there.” Then the docent pointed to a ground floor room with bars that filled the door frame. “Women were kept there. They birthed their babies in that room.”\n\nThe docent described how the governor would lean on the railing from his 3rd floor porch, look down and order an underling to bring half a dozen women from the caged room. From above he would look at each of them and select one be brought to him. If the woman resisted, she was chained to a cannon ball which was secured in the cobblestone floor. I stared at the ball and wondered how many women had failed to free themselves to grind such a hole in the stone?\n\nI snapped a picture of the ball and chain then entered the room which had detained the women. The door was heavy. The walls of the room still carried a weak yellow pigment. I stood in the center of the room, raised my camera, and held my breath before the CLICK but immediately an odor overwhelmed me. The walls, even after 500 years, screamed with echoes of women’s blood and piss and shit and afterbirth. Instead I turned and aimed my camera to the tourists. I left the room in tears. Who could be so evil?\n\nSojourn from Books to Ancestry.com\n\nDuring a visit to the Doylestown Historical Society, there were several donated books lazily spread on their coffee table, all topics about African American history. Three captured my curiosity: Before Freedom by Belinda Hurmence; Lumumba, a biography by Robin McKown and Bound for Canaan by Fergus E. Bordewich. “Can I have these?” Those and other books by African American authors and historians now overflow one of my bookshelves. Searches on Ancestry.com have enriched my family as we have discovered descendants and archival material about our ancestors.\n\nReached back, Returned with Legacy\n\nOn this Black History Month, there are schools absent from learning about the African American experience. In 2020 and 2021 I presented Out From Slavery—from Africa to Freedom–to a Civics Class at Lenape Middle School. Their teacher, Andrew Burgess is an Educator I admire for his skill of encouraging Knowledge to his students. I won’t visit this year’s February class because the Central Bucks School Board has become a Board of Banners. Mr. Burgess was transferred from Lenape to another Middle School for defending LGBTQ+ rights. The students who are now learning from him are truly blessed!\n\nI expect the Central Bucks School Board’s next goal is to erase African American History, which some Pennsylvania schools have already done. As I write this, there are members within the Harrisburg legislature determined to pull the threads of Black History from Democracy’s Colorful Quilt of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\n\nIgnorance is a dangerous thing. When browsing your social media sites this month, if an interesting piece about Black History appears, pause, read and learn.\n\nScraping Doylestown History\n\n(Photos by Doreen Stratton) There are times when life treats you with a piece of knowledge about your hometown and you tuck it away, unless it pops up in your memory bank at an unexpected moment. Eleven years had passed before it happened for me. It was Saturday, April 6, 2013, when a Historical Marker…\n\nWomen’s History Month\n\nThe calendar has flipped from February to March. Gone is Black History Month replaced with Women’s History Month. My March 2024 calendar from the National Museum of African American History & Culture (NMAAHC) celebrates an image of six African American nurses, staff at St. Luke Hospital in Columbia South Carolina. They learned their skills at…\n\nDon’t Mess with Black History at My School\n\n“ . . . but at last all the other nations of the earth seemed to conspire against the negro race, . . . Thus this race of human beings has been singled out, owing to the accident of color, or to their peculiar fitness for certain kinds of labor, for infamy and misfortune; .…"
