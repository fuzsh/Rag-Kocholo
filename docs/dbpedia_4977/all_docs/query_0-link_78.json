        "text": "I was concerned that nobody had yet tried to use the current situation in Gaza to dunk on the DSA, but fortunately Goldberg and the NYT are on the case. The DSA, which counts about 80,000 members, is the true source of the problem here, not the ones who have held power for decades in the US.\n\nGoldberg touchingly proffers “But if humanist principles spur total revulsion toward the terrorist crimes in Israel, they also demand restraint in Gaza”, noting that Israel is imposing collective punishment on Gaza. Goldberg is however appalled that some members of the left are being insensitive to Israelis’ sufferings. I am appalled too but, after all, as Goldberg also reports, the most visible representative of the left in the US (Sanders and AOC) said all the right things about the issue. On the other hand, nothing is said about the President. You know, the one heading the decent progressives. The other day he said that “Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. The United States warns against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation. My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.” One would think that a few words could be spent on how, maybe, just maybe, the President of the nation that is the closest ally to Israel, that President could also try to avert the collective punishment Israel is inflicting on Gaza. But, no, all eyes should be on the “disgusting left”. Then some wonder why a big part of the population ends up falling for the fake news of the right. With true news spun like these…\n\nI think it is pretty easy to condemn Hamas’s attacks on Israel as war crimes deliberately targeting civilians — when you walk up to a child and kill them, there’s no counter argument possible.\n\nIt’s a little grayer when Israel indiscriminately bombs Gaza, killing hundreds of civilians and, I’m guessing, way fewer combatants, but it seems to me to be quite likely to be criminal behavior as well.\n\nThe bigger problem is that right now, most Israelis don’t believe that Palestinian leadership will tolerate a Jewish Israel. Hamas, controlling Gaza, clearly wants Jews killed or evicted from Israel, and I’ve been unable to find any statement by Abbas tolerating a Jewish state either.\n\nOn the other side, around 2000-2001 time frame, Arafat started the 2nd Intifada, rejected the Tabas partial agreement, while Clinton left the White House and Ariel Sharon became PM of Israel. Since that time, Israelis decided that to avoid terrorist bombings, separating the populations, and simply building settlements in the West Bank, would be a good long term solution. Sharon essentially rejected the Two State solution, and Palestinian intransigence provided good cover.\n\nUnfortunately, the long term plan of the Israeli right requires 5M Palestinians to live with no political rights, essentially forever. That can’t go on forever, and with Israeli settlement building in the West Bank along with impoverishment of people in Gaza under Hamas, the pressure just keeps building up.\n\nOslo in 1993 was supposed to be the start of a trust building process. Instead, the Palestinians kept using terror as a tool, and Israelis kept using the process as a cover to keep grabbing more land from Palestinians. Tragically bad leadership on both sides, and a wasted generation or two.\n\nYou know what economists always says: If something can’t go on forever, it will stop. The mathematician in me recognizes that this like a non-constructive “proof.” You know it will stop, you don’t know how or why. But it doesn’t take a genius to realize it will be ugly.\n\nThough any normal person would be paralyzed and outraged by the unfolding horror it still surprised me people in the media jumped so fast from ‘how did this happen’ to a more conflictual position where there are sweeping political pronouncements about all the other people and their political pronouncements. Though I guess it is an emergency so this is what happens. It seems so pointless though.\n\nBut even though these killings are so awful one cannot think maybe we can still stop and consider that we may not totally understand why this happened or what is really going on.\n\nI am partly suspicious of this process that follows traumatic events because this happened after 9/11, and a similar reaction led to a very fuzzy understanding of the specifics of the situation. The Bush administration completely failed to heed warnings and then the response was simply to create a giant security state, wars, and torture. Nobody ever held them accountable. We did not get a clear account of why it was all Saudi nationals involved or the role of the Saudis or anything else. And of course there was nothing but a flood of lies after that. But the rush helped to keep people from asking questions, and to stun people into compliance with some of the most extreme stupidity that has ever been seen in the history of the USA. And maybe the wacky conspiracy theories that followed are one of the causes of the whole country coming unhinged that we see now. Maybe some people’s brains never came fully back online. Hating Muslims was a big winner for Trump both in the USA and with some people in Israel.\n\nThough I also want to tear my hair out at some of the things being said on the left it seems so petty in the face of these horrors to immediately jump to use them to punch left. Do we need this concern trolling right now? Is that the important thing at the moment?\n\nIt’s surprising how fast everyone moved to leap on their social media enemies as well. Maybe it’s just how things are now.\n\nThe facts of the attack are still not understood well. For example, how the hell did they break though at so many points? Why didn’t Israel heed the warnings? Israel? The most security obsessed state on the planet just did an ‘oh, well but it’s a holiday?’ I look back at the news from the last 5 years and what the Israeli government is saying as an explanation is absurd. They trusted Hamas? What? That’s laughable. And in such a militarized country how would there be nothing at any of these points where they got through?\n\nWhere did the technology come from? How much surveillance could Hamas be doing that they could time this so perfectly?\n\nNews stories say that Hamas political wing did not know about this attack. Hezbollah wasn’t jumping in.\n\nAre there factions in Hamas, some more extreme than others? Who were these specific attackers? Some people are even saying they weren’t all Hamas.\n\nWhy did this happen now? What role did previous events play in it? All we get is a flood of distorted propaganda.\n\nIt’s not even clear where we could look for alternative information that isn’t just political posturing. There are basic factual issues that are being reported incorrectly, such as the constant repetition that Hamas is the elected government of Gaza as if they’ve been having elections all this time.\n\nAbout peace in the future, there is always a narrative about any group of people that they are impossible, and then often this turns out not to be true. In situations where there are extremists then the extremist on one side will depend on extremists on the other side to continue the conflict as long as they can. This happened with the IRA. Even if the conflict is over, people in politics won’t let it go as long as it is their political brand. It is always possible to make peace. It has happened many times before.\n\nThe extremists are having their day now and I suppose they have carte blanche at the moment to make things maximally terrible but what I can’t help but note is that rhetorically and conceptually they have succeeded over time at sucking the air out of any of the ideas that used to be proposed to give any possibility of peace. And there really isn’t any thinkable alternative to justice and peace in a situation like this. If it sounds stupid, oh, well. Everything else is way worse and much more stupid. If it is impossible then is what we’re seeing right now a possibility anyone would ever choose?\n\nMost all agree on what happened – obviously atrocious.\n\nMost all understand why it happened – Policies toward Gaza on one side, Hamas stance on the other. Inevitable surely, although the escalation was remarkable.\n\nIf Israel knew, it wouldn’t have predicted the degree of terror exacted. They may have been “o.k.” with the usual small raid and the excuse it would provide for some customary retaliation. This has been a regular give and take for more than a decade and the new Right government may have been o.k. with a chance to flex its muscle a bit. They will now get that chance to a degree they hadn’t contemplated.\n\nHamas surely knew by doing what they did they would get the fight brought to them. It was a calculated escalation and they are finding they are getting far less than the usual support and far more condemnation. USS Gerald Ford wasn’t what they had in mind. Their own fault – yes. But they have been playing this game for a long time and decided to press their luck to see how the new government would react. They will find out.\n\nThere are no solutions here. There are no ‘less bad’ ways to see this unfold. It will be horrible and beneath what civilized societies should expect. The only thing that can be done is to make sure it stays reasonably contained. This conflict is 5000 years old, this only the latest chapter.\n\nI hate to be defeatist, but the evidence is the evidence. Far better leaders than any of those on the playing field today have tried to resolve this, yet here we are.\n\nRE: DSA\n\nA big part of the problem is that the Left cannot afford the kinds of own goals it produced in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks. For one, the U.S. political system is set up to exclude said Left from power. The media elite is dead set against anything that would enable Social-Democrats and Democratic Socialists to be taken seriously. Anything they can use to keep Leftists firmly on the margins of American politics they will.\n\nLike it or not, endorsing a rally that features signs saying “Resistance is not Terrorism” 24 hours after children were killed (some reports talk of babies burned alive) is not a good look – regardless of one’s very justified support for Palestinian rights. Is it lack of professionalism on DSA’s part, as someone alluded to in a previous comment? Is it cluelessness, or just plain stupidity? It might seem unfair to pick on DSA, still a very minor actor in the greater scheme of things. But that’s the hand the Left has been dealt. The deck is stacked against Leftists and they just don’t have the luxury of getting it wrong in the way we saw right after the attacks.\n\nIf anything, the stakes are even greater in Europe. As messed up as U.S. politics is on this issue, it’s still possible to hold rallies supporting Palestinian rights in American cities. That right has very much been called into question in the U.K., France, Germany, where the powers-that-be are trying to criminalize any expression of support whatsoever for the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe stakes are huge: A broad arc ranging from the far-right to the center (whether its more left-wing elements can be called center-left is another debate) is determined to destroy not the Left, but also anti-racist movements. Accusations of Anti-Semitism are a major part of their strategy. Netanyahu has essentially franchised the term Anti-Semitism for use by anyone who broadly supports, or at least fails to condemn, his policies. That includes Orban, Macron, and Starmer.\n\nAgain, it should be possible to condemn both the barbarity of the Hamas attacks and Netanyahu’s settler-colonialist policies. Any ambiguity in that regard is not an option.\n\nWe do seem to be back in 2002, with ‘moral equivalence’ and ‘will you condemn!’ being part of the rhetoric.\n\nWhen I first heard the news of the Hamas breakout from Gaza my reaction was admiration at its audacity, but that was very swiftly followed by disgust at the murders and kidnappings they then committed and the Breivik-style mentality that must have been required for such cruelty. The victims and their families are entitled to all our compassion and solidarity. Now it looks like Israel will invade Gaza and large parts of the Israeli population just want revenge, and if they don’t actually intend the deaths of children, civilians, they are pretty reckless about bringing them about and all too ready to utter the stock clichés about “human shields” and the like to shift the blame. Being reckless about civilian deaths is wrong and deliberately killing them is worse, quite independently of what the “other side” does, but there is no way that morally inflamed people are going to hold back from the conclusion that they are entitled to cast off restraints in getting their own back on the “monsters” who confront them. But the world is watching, and if Israel gets a pass for the very worst, then it will be hard for the “West” to deliver lectures about Russia’s conduct in Ukraine to Africans, Latin Americans and so forth. So the branch we sit on gets sawn through, just as it does with the drowned in the Med and the pervasive indifference of our leaders to suffering and abuse wherever the perpetrators are aligned with Europe and the US.\n\nJW Mason @13 – Corbyn named Seumas Milne one of his chief aides, had plenty of warm words for Hamas in the past and, despite the dishonest headline, has been historically very, very selective about what civilian deaths he gets upset about. Unless his article unexpectedly just consists of a short statement acknowledging that he is hopelessly compromised on this issue and cannot make a positive contribution, and so will be remaining silent at this time, I cannot imagine anything he could say that needs to be said, or would be productive to be said, or anything other than mind-blowingly idiotic to be said. The fact that the very opening of the article is on how “I, Jeremey Corbyn, have righteously condemned this violence once again. Sadly my oracular utterances were not heeded before” should remind us that Corbyn is a vain ignoramus, whose politics are solely about building up a cadre of worshippers for his cult of personality without inadvertently doing anything that might actually result in positive change to people’s lives.\n\nAnd this is why I’m so frustrated in this moment – for all of my adult life every Israeli government has seemed to be committed to brutalising the Palestinians, and the Netanyahu government is a gaggle of incompetent fascists and eliminationist lunatics, that was so focused on gutting the state and keeping Bibi out of jail it basically let HAMAS walk in. Israeli society is pissed with him, and rightly so, and I’m guessing he’ll be ousted soon. The horrific pogrom of 7 October didn’t occur in a vacuum. Hadley Freeman is upset people aren’t flying Israeli flags in solidarity the way they flew Ukrainian flags? Maybe she should consider what those flags have come to mean, through the actions of their respective states over the years. There’s a reason the Ukrainian far right uses its own flags.\n\nAnd as Pittsburgh Mike @5 eloquently puts it “Unfortunately, the long term plan of the Israeli right requires 5M Palestinians to live with no political rights, essentially forever. That can’t go on forever, and with Israeli settlement building in the West Bank along with impoverishment of people in Gaza under Hamas, the pressure just keeps building up.” Indeed, I’d go further and say this isn’t the Israeli right, its a hegemonic position of the Israeli political establishment.\n\nNone of these things should be controversial to say. None of these things should be outside the realm of legitimate debate.\n\nAnd yet, the most vocal opposition to Israeli war crimes has been led by dipshit narcissists like Corbyn and associated cosplaying radicals. Here in London we had immediate Palestinian solidarity campaigns after the attack. The timing was dubious enough, but the cherry on top were the idiots showing up with paraglider badges shouting Khaybar! If the people organising the protest don’t want to look like terrorist sympathisers they need to police their ranks and exclude the people openly sympathising with terrorists. If your political organisation can’t, or won’t, do that, then its not a serious political organisation and it should be regarded with contempt. Simple as.\n\nUltimately I think the US and EU have played a pretty smart game in their public communications. They recognised in a way that the Corbyns of this world don’t that everyone in Israel is currently dealing with the aftermath of an extremely traumatic event and are emotionally raw. It will be hard for anyone to think straight through the red mist. By signalling maximum solidarity publicly at this point in time, it is much more likely an Israeli government (either Netanyahu’s or his successor) will listen to private entreaties to show restraint and have some form of defensible long term plan for stability. We’ve already seen the Americans move in this direction, and Brussels is starting to as well (the fag-end Tory government in the UK is barely functional at this point so I’m more or less disregarding them at this point).\n\nThat said I don’t have high hopes for that plan working – I think this is going to be several months of bloody carnage. There’s too much poison in the Israeli political discourse. But there is at least an effort underway to avoid it, being undertaken by people (like Starmer) who are calibrating their message to gain as much influence over events in future, who are being criticised by people (like Corbyn) who want to burnish their ‘radical’ cred.\n\nTLDR – there are some on the left who are trying to stop the creation of a mountain of corpses, and some on the ‘left’ looking forward to being very publicly upset about the mountain so that people can see how good and empathetic they are.\n\nChris @51\n\nApologies – there was an incident at conference where Corbyn was asked to condemn Hamas and did one of his trademark tantrums at the journalist who had the temerity to ask. I thought your opening line was a clear reference to that (as we’re both in the UK) but I can accept I was mistaken.\n\nFWIW – I’m not ‘looking’ at this through the lens of domestic UK politics, but for better or for worse the UK is a P5 state and the domestic political context matters, both for the UK and the world. Two weeks ago Suella Braverman looked like a deranged fascist – she still is, but when you have mass demonstrations in London implicitly celebrating a horrific pogrom she’s going to look a lot more reasonable to a lot more people. Secondly, in terms of whatever influence the UK has over Israel’s response, the unhelpful interventions of Corbyn and his fellow paragliding enthusiasts are likely to be negative. Demonstrably, and publicly, marginalising and excluding them from the political conversation gives London more credibility with Tel Aviv.\n\nAnd since I wrote I’ve seen that US pressure has gotten Israel to turn the water back on in Gaza after pressure from the US. The IDF seems to have paused after indications that it would roll in on Saturday. This could be for operational reasons (weather etc.), but the Americans have also been quietly asking the Israelis what their plan is and warning them that international solidarity will evaporate if they turn Gaza into a charnel house. I’m still very pessimistic about a positive outcome here, but it does demonstrate that as much as the usual suspects have been upset by Biden and von der Leyen expressing maximum solidarity with Tel Aviv, its been a vastly more effective tactic for influencing Israeli behaviour than chanting ‘from the river to the sea’ in Trafalgar square.\n\n@TM 21, re DSA. Some points for your consideration:\n\n1) In Goldberg’s article there is only one mention of the DSA, regarding a statement at a DSA rally in Connecticut. There are also references about some other organizations that are not necessarily part of the left (the president of N.Y.U.’s student bar association, students for Palestine etc.). On this evidence, one could have written an article about how the vast majority of the left said the right things about the situation, and also notice that there were also some contemptible statements from some organizations. These statements are instead given prominence because the goal is to attack the left.\n\n2) The unbalance in Goldberg’s presentation is particularly striking as she says “a decent and functional left has rarely been more necessary”. She then proceeds to speak about the dire situation in Gaza and the collective punishment that Israel was about to inflict on Gaza. This is quite an extraordinary charge: If only the left was more decent, then we would have a chance to avert this tragedy. The burden is then on the left rather than on those who have been in power in the US for decades. The NYT readers can breathe a sigh of relief: it is not their fault, it is the fault of those leftists.\n\n3) Voices supporting Palestinians are very hard to hear in US political discourse. There is Ilhan Omar, yes, but pro-palestinian voices have usually a hard time to find representation. It is not surprising that they find refuge in fringe parties and it is not surprising that sometimes this results in extreme statements. By the way, as I said, I also dislike the statements made at the DSA rally in CT. I do not know who made those statements but in this regard I would like to add that I do not have family in Gaza and so I recognize that it is easier for me to express my opposition to such statements (analogously, I do not have family in Israel and so ditto for extreme statements on the other side).\n\n4) I am not a DSA member either, but I find interesting your statements about their position on Putin. Online, I found this statement from the DSA on February 26, 2022: “The Democratic Socialists of America condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and demands immediate diplomacy and de-escalation to resolve this crisis.” But maybe they should have issued a stronger statement?\n\n5) You say that “The armchair antiimperialism now deployed in reaction to the Hamas attacks betrays a disgusting indifference to the suffering of civilians on both sides.” I am not sure how comfortable your armchairs are but, following the attacks, some students organizations at Harvard signed on a statement made by the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee that blamed Israel for the attacks by Hamas. In response, a billboard truck drove near Harvard’s campus on Wednesday showing the names and photos of the students whose organizations signed such statement. So, it is not true that these students’ activism (whether one agrees with it or not) carries no cost to them.\n\n6) Similarly, billionaire hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman (who incidentally lives about 2 miles away from Goldberg’s employer and, also incidentally, is a long-time donor to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer), per CNN has demanded that “Harvard University release the names of students whose organizations signed on to a letter blaming solely Israel for the deadly attacks by Hamas” so that he could ensure that his company and others do not “inadvertently hire” any of the signatories. Also, a law firm rescinded a job offer it had made to the above-mentioned president of N.Y.U.’s student bar association because of the student’s statement on the attacks (this is mentioned only in passing, and neutrally, in Goldberg’s article). I am not sure I would like to be sitting in the armchairs of these students.\n\nWe are past the tipping-point of the Seneca Cliff.\n\nAll of the vital trajectories of contemporary human and terrestrial history are headed towards the end-state conditions of a series of viciously morbid systemic and structural asymptotic fault lines and processes – ecocidal climate change; oligarchical capitalist class warfare; the continuing historical phenomena of military conflict without the existence of counteractive pacifist and peacemaking historical processes to act as a counterweight – that are ineluctably leading the human species to an extended period of great suffering in hell on earth.\n\n(The following relies heavily upon Immanuel Wallerstein and his school of World-Systems Analysis. In particular it is an attempt to describe and to analyze the internal momentum of a set of world-systems from the perspective of the longue durée).\n\nThe nations which inhabit the core zones of the capitalist world system – the USA; the EU; Australia; the UK – have in recent decades been captured by rightist politics. This process has accelerated in recent years into the politics of arch-reaction and ultranationalism or, simply and succinctly put, Fascism.\n\nTo this must be now be added a full-blooded return and embrace of 19th/early 20th century Imperialism and Colonialism of the vintage of the blood-soaked Sykes-Picot Agreement and the hideous horrors wrought by the Balfour Declaration.\n\nWhy were a number of prominent buildings lit with the Israeli flag? Why was this to the exclusionof the Palestinian flag? Why weren’t both Palestinian and Israeli flags displayed in a manner that would accord with the Two-State Solution that these nations cannot even remember to pay lip-service to, despite it being their own purported policy position? Was this state of thoughtless absent-mindedness brought about due to these nations having done everything in their power to destroy the conditions necessary for the implementation of their ostensible policy position?\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/11/israeli-flags-adorn-eu-buildings-after-hamas-attacks-is-the-bloc-united\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/10/09/1204662594/europe-condemn-hamas-support-israel-suspend-palestinian-aid\n\nhttps://www.newarab.com/news/uk-eu-light-solidarity-israel-it-bombs-gaza\n\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-11/nsw-opera-house-lights-over-the-years-political-controversy/102958584\n\nAll the utter BS of these nations as being upholders of Human Rights and of an International rules-based legal order, promoters of Liberal Constructivism etc. has been fully exposed for all to see as being the smoke-screen for the geopolitics of power-hegemonic positioning that was always apparent to the victims of their rapine foreign misadventures.\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/program/inside-story/2023/10/11/is-international-law-to-protect-civilians-ignored-in-gazas-war\n\nWe have returned full cycle.

The insignificance of human(ist) intentions and concomitant diminution of any notion of human agency and morality.\n\nWhilst I only mentioned Immanuel Wallerstein, the other major system-theorist in the social sciences is Niklas Luhmann. In contrast to Wallerstein, Luhmann is an anti-humanist. Or is perhaps more accurately described as a non-humanist.\n\nSee e.g. Hans-Georg Moeller’s “The Radical Luhmann”\n\nhttps://1lib.sk/book/2880152/0dc583\n\nSocial-systems are to be studied as objects in themselves. Social-systems operate in accordance with their internal, functionally differentiated logics. Social-systems are not subject to the control, design and “steering” (as Luhmann puts it) that modern secular-humanist conceptions of societies, polities and economies consider to be the operational norm. Rather, social-systems contain an internal momentum which may be the strongest determinant in the manner in which historical events unfold. These systemic logics operate over and above the mess of human intentions. Moeller in his book on Luhmann calls this the “sociological insult” against human(ist) hubris.\n\n2/Dismay, despair and other essentially religious or demiurgical forms of resistance.\n\nIf the thesis of Zionism as a historical program of military-colonial genocide is the empirical and conceptual truth, then the Palestinians are damned. Agents of Evil and anti-Reason do not usually escape unscathed either. Tel Aviv and, by imperialist extension, Washington are also likely to be hit with collateral damage as nemesis for their psychotic hubris. The USA (both domestically and as a geopolitical great power) is already riven by terminally morbid faultlines of decline, decay and potential collapse.\n\nThe difficulty of the facing up to a Truth that leads into a state of enervating hopelessness tends to excite a reaction of essentially religious objections. These could also be considered to be bio-instinctual reflexes in the face of danger. In any case, religious-type objections (“but if what you assert is true, then there is no Hope”) are not empirical refutations and hence leave the thesis unscathed.\n\n3/There is also the obscenely immoral and desperately silly piece of military-colonial agit-prop which shouldn’t detain us except to note the profound anti-Rationality (Evil in its innate nature is anti-Rational) that prevails in the discourse around the Palestine-Israel conflict/genocide.\n\nThis is the widely circulated item of military-colonial agit-prop that asserts that the use of the word “genocide” except exclusively in reference to the Shoah “relativizes” “Jewish suffering” and is hence “anti-Semitic”.\n\nThe abyssal anti-Rationality of this wildly illogical assertion, which is a nonetheless a widely held belief, attests to the abyssal Evil and to the great necropolitical power (Achille Mbembe) of the genocidal forces that are central historical drivers of events.\n\nSimilarly anti-Rational beliefs (QAnon; Nazi great lies; Machiavellian great lies; Stalinist great lies; imperialist delusions of hubris; humanist delusions of promethean omnipotence) have powered other major events of mass-killing and great destruction.\n\n@TM 71\n\nWhen considering the Palestine Israel conflict/genocide the massive preponderance of power is with the two nuclear armed states – Israel and the USA.\n\nWe are (or should be) looking for an account of historical causality. Naturally, historical causality is located in the most powerful historical currents. Colonialism is driven by the wielding of the necropolitical power as a means of inflicting violence to maintain control and exert domination. (see Achille Mbembe)\n\nYour pathetic attempts to play lawyer for Tel Aviv and for Washington is a sickening example of the most damnable Lady Macbeth handwashing.\n\nWhat liberal-bourgeois fantasy of “agency” are you talking about? Are there any activities that the Palestinians engage in that Zionists like you, in your nightmarish opium clouds of bloodletting, do not immediately stamp your iron boots upon?\n\nIt is impossible to display the Palestinian flag on Instagram, unaccompanied by any reference whatsoever to the Jewish people, without a barrage of Israeli airstrikes hitting the poor unfortunate who stepped out of line. Is this the sort of thing you mean when you speaking empowering people so that they may have “agency” or “freedom of speech”??\n\nhttps://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20220131-emma-watson-is-with-palestine/\n\nWhat about Palestinians simply living their lives? Is that ok with you? The answer is a violent, bloodthirsty NO!\n\n“A Threshold Crossed\n\nIsraeli Authorities and the Crimes of Apartheid and Persecution”\n\n“About 6.8 million Jewish Israelis and 6.8 million Palestinians live today between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan River, an area encompassing Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), the latter made up of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Throughout most of this area, Israel is the sole governing power; in the remainder, it exercises primary authority alongside limited Palestinian self-rule. Across these areas and in most aspects of life, Israeli authorities methodically privilege Jewish Israelis and discriminate against Palestinians. Laws, policies, and statements by leading Israeli officials make plain that the objective of maintaining Jewish Israeli control over demographics, political power, and land has long guided government policy. In pursuit of this goal, authorities have dispossessed, confined, forcibly separated, and subjugated Palestinians by virtue of their identity to varying degrees of intensity. In certain areas, as described in this report, these deprivations are so severe that they amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.”\n\nhttps://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution\n\n“Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians: a cruel system of domination and a crime against humanity\n\nThe comprehensive report, Israel’s Apartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime against Humanity, sets out how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system which amounts to apartheid under international law. This system is maintained by violations which Amnesty International found to constitute apartheid as a crime against humanity, as defined in the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention.\n\nAmnesty International is calling on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to consider the crime of apartheid in its current investigation in the OPT and calls on all states to exercise universal jurisdiction to bring perpetrators of apartheid crimes to justice.\n\n“There is no possible justification for a system built around the institutionalized and prolonged racist oppression of millions of people. Apartheid has no place in our world, and states which choose to make allowances for Israel will find themselves on the wrong side of history. Governments who continue to supply Israel with arms and shield it from accountability at the UN are supporting a system of apartheid, undermining the international legal order, and exacerbating the suffering of the Palestinian people. The international community must face up to the reality of Israel’s apartheid, and pursue the many avenues to justice which remain shamefully unexplored.”\n\nAmnesty International’s findings build on a growing body of work by Palestinian, Israeli and international NGOs, who have increasingly applied the apartheid framework to the situation in Israel and/or the OPT.\n\nIdentifying apartheid\n\nA system of apartheid is an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination by one racial group over another. It is a serious human rights violation which is prohibited in public international law. Amnesty International’s extensive research and legal analysis, carried out in consultation with external experts, demonstrates that Israel enforces such a system against Palestinians through laws, policies and practices which ensure their prolonged and cruel discriminatory treatment.\n\nIn international criminal law, specific unlawful acts which are committed within a system of oppression and domination, with the intention of maintaining it, constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid. These acts are set out in the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute, and include unlawful killing, torture, forcible transfer, and the denial of basic rights and freedoms.\n\nAmnesty International documented acts proscribed in the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute in all the areas Israel controls, although they occur more frequently and violently in the OPT than in Israel. Israeli authorities enact multiple measures to deliberately deny Palestinians their basic rights and freedoms, including draconian movement restrictions in the OPT, chronic discriminatory underinvestment in Palestinian communities in Israel, and the denial of refugees’ right to return. The report also documents forcible transfer, administrative detention, torture, and unlawful killings, in both Israel and the OPT.\n\nAmnesty International found that these acts form part of a systematic and widespread attack directed against the Palestinian population, and are committed with the intent to maintain the system of oppression and domination. They therefore constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid.\n\nhttps://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/\n\nTwo days ago, Hamas senior leader Dr Naim said; “It doesn’t mean that we lost control … there was a chaos in the area.”.

While repeating the usual stats about the decline in violent deaths, Morris mentions in passing that a nuclear war could cause billions of deaths. He doesn’t consider the obvious anthropic fallacy problem – if such a war had happened, there would not be any op-eds in the Washington Post discussing the implications for life expectancy.”\n\nby JOHN Q on OCTOBER 13, 2019\n\nChris Bertram @47 said “… and if they don’t actually intend the deaths of children, civilians, they are pretty reckless about bringing them about and all too ready to utter the stock clichés about “human shields” and the like to shift the blame. Being reckless about civilian deaths is wrong and deliberately killing them is worse, quite independently of what the “other side” does, but there is no way that morally inflamed people are going to hold back from the conclusion that they are entitled to cast off restraints in getting their own back on the “monsters” who confront them.”\n\nWhich monsters?\n\nHow many children and carers?\n\n??% are women in caring roles for the 2nd largest demographics of young people.
