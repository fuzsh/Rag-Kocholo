        "text": "A NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – JUNE 30, 2024\n\nThis coming Thursday, we as a nation celebrate Independence Day, a day when we more intentionally recognize the gift of our freedom and acknowledge the many men and women who have put and continue to put their lives on the line in order to defend it. True freedom is something very profound. All of us, made in the image and likeness of God, have been gifted with an intellect and a free will. Of all God’s creatures here on earth, we human beings have the ability to critically think and to freely make choices that have consequences not only for ourselves, but potentially for others as well.\n\nWhile we all have been given the gift of freedom by God, I’m sure there are many moments in our lives where frankly, we don’t feel free at all. Maybe we’re struggling with an addiction or feel compelled to think or act in a certain way to find the acceptance of others. Maybe we feel bound by the many obligations that take up most of our time during the week with little time for rest. Maybe, for whatever reason, we feel like we simply don’t have the power to make the decisions that we feel need to be made. Regardless of where we find ourselves, it’s so important to remember that Jesus came to set us free, “for freedom Christ set us free; so stand firm and do not submit again to the yoke of slavery” (2 Corinthians 3:17). The moments when we feel especially burdened, chained down by the pressures that surround us, trapped under the weight of whatever problem or difficulty we are facing… are opportunities for us to turn to the Lord Jesus for guidance, support, and love.\n\nFreedom and the ability to exercise our freedom is truly a gift, but it is also a tremendous responsibility. As followers of Christ, all of us are called to use our freedom to choose good and to avoid evil, to help lift up those who are in need, and to be peacemakers in the midst of conflict. Human freedom is not only meant to be exercised for ourselves, but also in a significant way for others, like St. Paul says, “For you were called for freedom, brothers. But do not use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh; rather, serve one another through love” (Galatians 5:13).\n\nThis is no easy task! Yet, it is one that we certainly can accomplish one step at a time, because of the grace and love of Jesus that is poured into us when we receive the Sacraments, especially the gift of his Real Presence in the Eucharist. As we celebrate this week, may we give thanks to God the author of true human freedom and use our gifts for the good of others without counting the cost.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – JUNE 23, 2024\n\nAs we start moving into the summer months, I’m sure many will agree that the last thing we would want when we’re on vacation is awful weather!!! Storms are chaotic, unpredictable, and can have the potential to completely ruin our plans, especially if they involve going down the shore to sit on a beautiful sandy beach in the sunlight, among many other examples! Even as we simply live our daily life… there’s a certain comfort when we are able to make a solid plan for our future and imagine what it would look like… but when something surprising comes in and messes up that vision, we know that a storm has hit and can feel very uneasy..\n\nUnfortunately, there are many times in life when we indeed find ourselves in the center of a storm and it seems like there’s nothing we can do about it. I bet the disciples who were in the boat with Jesus felt just as helpless!!! The waves were raging, the water was coming up into the boat, they were in danger of sinking… and there was little they could do on their own to stop it (see Mk 4:35-41). It’s fascinating how peaceful the Lord Jesus was while all of that commotion was going on. He was there right with everyone else, yet totally calm… asleep and at peace. When our lives are feeling chaotic, its good to turn to someone, especially Jesus, who can be that rock of peace for us. A calming presence who can help make everything more bearable.\n\nWhat’s going on around us may be chaotic, uncomfortable, and unexpected… but what’s going on inside of us can be calm and at peace, because the Lord is with us. We can choose to be at peace. It’s true, we certainly cannot always control our circumstances or things that are happening external to ourselves. But we do have the power, relying on the\n\ngrace of Jesus, to choose peace for ourselves. To say firmly that, “regardless of what happens to me today, this week, this month, this year… I am going to choose to address the challenges of my life from a place of peace with Jesus at my side.” Just like those disciples who were in the boat with Jesus were afraid… we too can feel afraid and anxious at times. But be assured that Jesus is indeed with us always to quiet the storm and help us live from a place of happiness, love, and peace.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – JUNE 16, 2024\n\nThis weekend we have a beautiful opportunity to celebrate the great gift of fatherhood and to honor all of those men in our lives who have loved us helped us to grow. Like motherhood, the vocation of fatherhood is a precious gift. Fathers, by word and example, not only help their children to become the best they can be in a practical sense, but\n\nalso work with the Lord to nourish the seeds of faith planted within the hearts of their children. If we stop and think, the transformation that a seed goes through to become an adult plant is remarkable! Years ago when I was studying biology I remember our professors covering all of the intricate details of how plants grow from seeds into full adulthood. It’s quite fascinating! That little seed has a tremendous amount of potential. What starts as something so small and in the case of some plants something barely even noticeable, when nurtured, becomes something new. Even the tallest of trees just started out as a small seed.\n\nIt’s no wonder the Lord compared the Kingdom of God to a mustard seed— such a tiny seed, but with the inner potential to become a tremendous plant that bears fruit and provides a home for many of God’s creatures (see Mark 4:30-32). All of us have had some seed of faith planted deep within us, given to us especially at the moment of our Baptism. Faith is something that needs to be nourished… if we plant a seed in the ground and don’t give it any water, don’t fertilize it, pay no attention to it whatsoever, it’s not\n\nlikely to grow. It’ll just stay a seed. But when taken care of well, it helps us all realize our potential as human persons and as disciples of Christ.\n\nAs we celebrate this Father’s Day weekend, may we give praise and thanksgiving to God our Father for his abundant blessings and to our fathers and father figures who have passed on the gift of faith to us.\n\nHappy Father’s Day!\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – JUNE 9, 2024\n\n“Therefore, we are not discouraged; rather, although our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this momentary light affliction is producing\n\nfor us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to what’s seen but to what is unseen; for what is seen is transitory, but what is unseen is eternal” (2 Corinthians 4:16-18).\n\nIt’s no surprise to anyone that life doesn’t always happen like we planned. There’s an expression that goes something like, “if you want to make God laugh just tell him your plans!!!” No matter how many details we work out, no matter how much time we spend trying to make everything perfect, no matter all of the control we try to exert to make sure everything is just right… it seems like there’s always something that can happen that throws everything off!!! That’s why the words of St. Paul (see above) are so important. There\n\nwill definitely be many, many moments in our life when things don’t work out as we’ve planned. No doubt about that. It can be easy to get discouraged and frustrated. It can be easy to feel let down. It can be easy to think that things will never work right.\n\nYet in the midst of all of those things that we all experience, the Lord wants us to stay strong in hope. Not to fall into despair… but rather to look to the hope promised to us by Jesus. Whatever pain or struggle we are going through now (and some of them can be very strong) isn’t all that’s left. What we experience now, what we see, touch, taste, and feel ultimately is indeed transitory… it only lasts for a time.\n\nBut what we don’t see yet, the pure happiness found in the Kingdom of Heaven, will last forever. As we strive each day to follow Jesus more closely, to do good and avoid evil, to make the best possible choices, may we remember the riches that await us as we grow in our discipleship and navigate the challenges of our life… always together with Jesus.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – JUNE 2, 2024\n\nThe Eucharist, the REAL PRESENCE of Jesus – body, soul, and divinity – is central to our faith. There’s something truly special about walking into any Catholic church and seeing the tabernacle with that sanctuary lamp burning brightly near it… showing us that Jesus Christ is truly present within our midst. Regardless of what a church’s architecture looks like or anything else… we can still feel a tremendous inner warmth because of our awareness of the Real Presence of Jesus that fills us with love, peace, and security.\n\nSome years ago, I had an opportunity to travel to many Catholic churches in the Holy Land and Rome. Many of these churches were truly beautiful. One could sense the hard work and devotion of the people who gave their time, talent, and resources into constructing their walls, crafting their art, and decorating the worship space. And yet, no matter what church building we entered… one could sense that it was the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, present in the tabernacles, that made everything special.\n\nAs we celebrate the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ, Corpus Christi, may we strive each day to recognize the precious gift of the Eucharist and actively work to conform our hearts to become more like that of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – MAY 26, 2024\n\n“…And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age” (Matt 28:20). These were the words that Jesus said to his disciples after he had given them their mission to go out and make new disciples, to go out and to bring people into a relationship with God, to help generations to move toward what is good, true, and beautiful with eyes fixed on heaven and eternal life with God. We, today in 2024, are given that same mission of helping to bring people to Jesus… and the Lord is truly with us as we strive to carry out that monumental calling.\n\nGod is always cheering for us… wanting us to have the very best and to make good choices. He’s with us when we’re alone and struggling. He’s with us in the brightest, most joyful moments of our life to share in that happiness, and also in the darkest, saddest moments of our life to help us through our grief. There is no one who understands us better… no one who knows what we are going through better… than God himself. We can turn to him any place, any time, because we know that he understands.\n\nAs we gather with family and friends this Memorial Day weekend, we pause to remember with deep gratitude all of those men and women who have lost their lives in service to our country and the families, friends, and loved ones who mourn their loss. We especially remember those from our parish who gave their life in service, especially our most recent loss of Sgt. David Solinas Jr. We remember and hold in prayer all those who are currently deployed and continue to risk their lives for our protection, as well as those who have previously served. May the Lord Jesus guide us, his children, always on the path of love, peace, and healing.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – MAY 19, 2024\n\nThis weekend we celebrate the gift of the Holy Spirit that has been given to the Church at Pentecost and continues to be active in our presence today! The Holy Spirit calls us to action and service, while also inviting us to enter more deeply into our own internal life of prayer. When we’re faced with challenges big and small, when we’re not sure where to turn for help, when we don’t know what our next step will be, how wonderful it is that we can look to the Holy Spirit who is in our midst for guidance and support.\n\nPart of living a life of faith is developing an attitude of discernment: actively striving to identify which path God wants us to take, which solution God wants us to embrace, which responsibility God is asking us to take on. The key to facing any difficulty or challenge in life is to recognize that we can’t always do it alone and that God has a plan. We can and should allow God into the mix! Sounds easy right? Well…it certainly takes effort on our part to do the hard work of listening. An attitude of discernment means trying our best to recognize that soft, still voice of God moving us in the right direction, guiding us by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\nBecoming more aware of the presence of the Holy Spirit and listening to the voice of God requires a freedom from distraction that most especially comes from making time for prayer and silence. It involves cultivating a sensitivity to the internal movements in our life, especially our thoughts, feelings, and desires. Where we feeling the most joy? What is causing us the most sadness? What is our deepest desire? These might sound like quite simple questions, but they’re really profound and very important. Prayerful quiet gives our mind a chance to be calm, to gain perspective, and to make room for the Lord.\n\nOne saint who can help us learn about and practice prayerful discernment is St. Ignatius of Loyola. St. Ignatius is famous, in part, for his “rules of discernment” that can really help us enter more deeply into our own interior life and discover God’s will for us in whatever situation we are experiencing. If you’re facing a difficult decision in life or are just trying to make sense of all of the “stuff” that is swirling around in your mind or heart, consider doing some research about St. Ignatius and Ignatian Spirituality! Learning about St. Ignatius and his insights on the spiritual life has been a blessing in my own life, and I hope can be a blessing for you as well.\n\nRemember that God is with you today and always.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – MAY 12, 2024\n\nThis is such a beautiful weekend to celebrate. To celebrate the great Solemnity of the Ascension of our Lord, as well as to celebrate the special gift of mothers and the vocation of motherhood. Before the Lord ascended into heaven and was commissioning his disciples for the work of ministry, he made a promise. He promised to be with them always (see Matthew 28:20)… a promise which holds true and strong today.\n\nAs we live our lives, doing our best each day to listen to God’s call and to follow it with an open heart, we have opportunities to communicate God’s love to the world in very real and tangible ways. One example highlighted especially this weekend, is through the vocation of motherhood. Mothers, through their willingness to carry and bring life into the world, through their kindness, love, and commitment, are a reflection of the love that God has for all of us as his children.\n\nJust think… like all of us, Jesus had a mother too! He was nurtured and loved as he grew up in the household of Mary and Joseph. Mary who is so gentle, pure, and open to the will of God, gives us the best example of what true motherhood is all about. Perhaps all of us in whatever vocation we have, can look to our mother Mary as an example of what it means to tenderly care for others, to follow Christ with our whole heart, and to embrace the call to bring the joy of God’s love into the world. To all of our mothers and to those who have shown us a mother’s love… Happy Mother’s Day!\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – MAY 5, 2024\n\nOne of the most beautiful parts of the Easter Season is having the privilege to witness some of our parishioners of all ages receiving the Sacraments for the first time, and to have an opportunity to share in the joy and excitement of their families during those special moments. Our life as disciples and the practice of our faith hinge on the Sacraments. Each and every time we receive a Sacrament, it is a moment of profound encounter with Jesus who loves each and every one of us regardless of where we find ourselves, and calls us to become better and better disciples as we strive to follow him.\n\nAs I witnessed our fellow parishioners receiving the Sacraments of Confirmation and Eucharist these last few weeks, I couldn’t help but notice the tremendous joy that was in the expressions of the family members, friends, and candidates as they received their first Sacraments. That joy is something very special and its something that we experience at these moments because true joy has Jesus and all that is good, true, and beautiful at its center. May the risen Christ continue to bless you and your families during this Easter Season with profound joy, happiness, and peace as we continue our journey as a parish family into deeper relationship with God and one another.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – APR. 28, 2024\n\nThis day and age, it seems like we’re always “connected” in some way. We form connections with our friends, network with others at work, and develop many other bonds throughout our lives. In a very practical way, nearly all of us are “connected” constantly to the world by our phones and computers through the internet! Recently I’ve been pondering… without the internet, our computers and phones would loose a majority of their practical use. It’s by being CONNECTED that they’re able to link us with friends and relatives over long distances, help us to find information, and even send a simple text message.\n\nThe best and most powerful connection we have ever have and ever will have… is our connection to Jesus. Through our Baptism and participation in the Sacraments, we become connected to Jesus in a very special way as his disciples on mission. The strength that we have to do good things, to speak kind words, and yes, even to love our enemies as Jesus calls us to do…. doesn’t come from our own effort alone. It comes because of our willingness to be joined to Jesus and receive his grace.\n\nThe branches are intimately linked to the vine. They share nourishment, water, and really EVERYTHING from the vine. Without the vine, the branch dies. When we think of our life of faith… all of us are intimately linked to the Lord. He is the vine and we are the branches! As Catholic Christians, we are nourished by Jesus when we make the choice to remain alongside him. By being joined to Jesus as individuals and as a parish community, we can do incredible things!\n\nWe have such an active parish here at St. Joe’s and are bearing good fruits through many diverse ministries. The personal relationship we have formed with Jesus and continue to grow in as disciples, has had a tremendous impact on the people around us. It helps to create our welcoming environment and build others up as we all journey together.\n\nIf you are looking to get more connected or get involved in a new ministry, don’t hesitate to reach out. Sometimes we might feel a small “pull” in our heart toward a particular ministry. That could be a prompting of the Holy Spirit calling us to action! We shouldn’t ignore it… but rather go deeper and answer the invitation to serve.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – APR. 21, 2024\n\nOn some level, I think it’s safe to say that all of us have a deep desire to be cared for and to belong. We want to be loved, to feel that someone is looking out for us, to be understood. There are many people in our lives who know us well: family, good friends, maybe some coworkers. But above all, the one who knows us the best is the Lord himself. Jesus knows and loves each one of us as his sons and daughters. He wants the best for us and to help all of us to grow in love of him and one another, and gives us the grace to do just that day in and day out.\n\nOne of the most fundamental aspects of the spiritual life is to recognize the care that God has for each one of us. It’s a care that is deeply personal: God wants to be involved in every aspect of our individual lives, to share in the good times, to comfort us in the sad times, and to help make those bad moments that we all experience in our lives at one point or another more bearable by placing our trust in his grace. Indeed, Jesus is the Good Shepherd, the one who would do anything for we his sheep… even to the point of laying down his life for us… like he did on the cross. May God bless you and your families as we continue to celebrate this joyous Easter Season.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – APR. 14, 2024\n\n“Peace be with you” Those are the beautiful words that the risen Christ spoke to his disciples (see Luke 24:36). Peace…I’m sure all of us could use peace in some way, shape, or form. Anxiety, fear, uncertainty are all very real things that we work through in our lives. The lists of concerns that we have are many! Worries about our family, friends, something at work, and the unknown of the future among many others. Yet, even in the midst of whatever it is that we’re going through at the present moment, the risen Christ speaks words of peace to us here and now.\n\nExperiencing the Lord’s peace doesn’t always mean that problems suddenly disappear. It doesn’t mean that we won’t have obstacles to overcome. It doesn’t mean that we’ll have all of the solutions for the issues in our lives. But what it does mean is that we can live our lives with confidence by placing our trust in Jesus, realizing that he is always with us. Perhaps we can all take comfort in the words Jesus said to his disciples as he sent them into the world on mission, “…behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age” (see Matt 28:20).\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – APR. 7, 2024\n\nFirst, I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank everyone who helped with and participated in our Easter Triduum celebrations! It takes a lot of hard work, organization, and dedication not only to plan for those liturgies, but also to serve them so beautifully and to help all of us enter into them with a deep sense of prayer. We are truly blessed as a parish by the work of so many dedicated people in all of our ministries and activities!!!\n\nThis Sunday, the Second Sunday of Easter, is also known as Divine Mercy Sunday. It’s a day when we can take a step back and recognize the tremendous love and mercy that Jesus poured forth from the cross. God’s mercy is truly endless and he invites all of us to open our hearts to receive it! How do we open our hearts? Well… a good first step is to recognize and acknowledge that we are all in need of healing and that there are places in our life that could use improvement. The Lord loves us so deeply and continually calls us to be better and better! As disciples, we seek to put our best foot forward each day to help us get closer to God and one another.\n\nOnce we acknowledge our need for God and his mercy, a good next step is to take a serious look at our life up to this point. This takes a lot of courage and trust in God’s love to do well. What have been our highs? What have been our lows? Is there something from the past that keeps coming up in our memory? Are there any feelings of guilt or anxiety or worry that stick out? Our lives can be a mixed bag of ups and downs, but nevertheless, Jesus is there with us through them all. Many times, the greatest healing we can receive is found in those dark and dusty places in our life where we were in the most need of God’s peace and mercy. The Lord doesn’t seek to push us down, but rather to lift each one of us high, to truly save us, and to help us experience what it means to be loved. Christ suffered, died, and rose from the dead for us… may we be willing to hand over our heart to him to experience the fountain of his overflowing mercy.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – MAR. 31, 2024\n\nThis is such a special day… it truly is. It’s a day to celebrate victory, to rejoice in love, and to be mindful that, “…the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it” (John 1:5). We gather on this beautiful Easter Sunday to give thanks and praise to God for the gift of his Son Jesus, to celebrate his resurrection from the dead, and to\n\nrecognize the gift of salvation that he won for us. If you are visiting our parish for the first time, please know that you are very welcome to worship here with us.\n\nThis day is a clear reminder of the everlasting love that God has for each one of us, his children, fashioned and molded in his image. The reality is that no matter who we are, what life experiences we’ve had or how close or far we’ve been from our faith… we all need to be saved! We are all in need of healing. In a very practical way, I’m sure we can point to different moments in our life when we’ve needed someone’s help or a shoulder to lean on, someone to take our side. Living the life of Catholic discipleship isn’t something that we can do on our own… we need the support of each other and above all, the grace of God that we especially receive in the Sacraments.\n\nWhen it comes to helping us get to heaven and living up to our full potential and being truly and eternally happy… Jesus is always on our side, bestowing on us the gifts we need to succeed. Will we make the decision to be on his side? Living the life of faith can be challenging, there may be things that we don’t understand or certain teachings we might struggle with. Jesus is there with us in all of those moments. God is a father in the most perfect sense of the word. He cares for each one of us more than we could ever know. He proved his love and commitment to us all those years ago by offering his son on the cross and renews his promises each and every day, as we pray and experience the gift of Jesus in the Sacraments.\n\n“But now, thus says the Lord, who created you, Jacob, and formed you, Israel: Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name: you are mine. When you pass through waters, I will be with you; through rivers, you shall not be swept away. When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned, nor will flames consume you. For I, the Lord, am your God, the Holy One of Israel, your savior.” (see Isaiah 43:1-3).\n\nSo enjoy this day, rejoice that Jesus truly lives, hold your head up high as a follower of Christ even in a challenging world. Follow Christ boldly and unreservedly… and remember that you are precious in the sight of God. Happy Easter!\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – MAR. 24, 2024\n\nThis week coming up is a BIG week for all of us. In fact, it is THE week of our Church calendar. It’s a time when we celebrate some of the most holy days of the year: the Easter Triduum which includes Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil. In each of those days, we are personally invited to walk with Jesus as he made his way to the cross out of love for us, and to acknowledge the amazing gift of salvation that he gives to us and that desires us to receive with all our heart, mind, and soul.\n\nWe “kick off” Holy Week with the great celebration of Jesus’ entrance into Jerusalem amidst the great crowds whose shouts of, “Hosanna to the Son of David; blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; hosanna in the highest” rang out in the streets as they lined the roads with branches and even their own cloaks (see Matt 21:6-9). The people recognized Jesus as a King and wanted to give him honor and praise! How beautiful it is that we commemorate that special moment which took place thousands of years ago even still today, as we too hold out our palm branches in praise and honor.\n\nThe humility of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem is truly astounding! Notice how he arrived… He didn’t come in hoisted high on a throne, he didn’t ride on a fine horse or come with many war chariots; he came on the back of a donkey showing that he is truly humble, gentle, and peaceful. How blessed we are to be the followers of Jesus who conquered evil and death not by violence or aggression, but rather with humility and the very gift of his own life poured out for us.\n\nOur lives are very busy, there’s no doubt about that. But I would like to encourage all of us to make this week truly special, to intentionally set aside some time for Jesus. If you’ve never been to any of the Masses/services of the Easter Triduum, take the opportunity to join us in worship! Each day has a different experience of the Church’s liturgy that is unique to those days and is very moving. It’s an opportunity to experience first hand the richness of our faith tradition alive in our worship and to put God in first place as we rapidly approach Easter. May God bless you and your families during this sacred week.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – MAR. 17, 2024\n\nRegardless of how old or young we are, or the experiences that we’ve had in life, no matter how close or far we have been from our faith… the Lord Jesus invites all of us to conversion. There is always more work to be done! Much of the Christian life centers on humility. To be humble doesn’t mean to be a “push over.” It doesn’t mean to sit back idly while others might try to take advantage of us. Being humble means having the courage to allow God to be the center of our lives and to recognize that God is in control! Sure, it is important that we work hard to achieve or goals and put effort into our lives. We can’t progress even in the spiritual life without effort on our part; sitting back and doing nothing won’t get us very far!\n\nIt is also very important to recognize, however, that we don’t have all the answers and that our efforts ALONE aren’t enough! We need Jesus and the grace of God to come into our lives and inspire our mind and heart to seek out the things in our midst that are good, true, and beautiful, so that we can prepare ourselves to experience the eternal life that God desires to bestow on all of us as his beloved sons and daughters.\n\nAs we get closer to Palm Sunday and with Holy Week fast approaching, perhaps we can make an effort these days to go even deeper in our own life of prayer. Here are some ideas for things we can do on our own or together at home with our families:\n\nConsider taking some time in the evening to review our day with Jesus, asking him to show us the times where we followed him well and the moments where we could have followed him better.\n\nPray with some passages of Scripture that have touched your heart in the past or read some parts of the Bible you may feel less familiar with.\n\nTake a moment each day to write down some things you are grateful for and thank God for those gifts and blessings. These are just a few suggestions! There are so many more great things that we can do, far too many to list. The goal is that we are striving to keep Jesus in first place in our daily life and continue to live out our discipleship with commitment and intentionality.\n\nMay God bless us all!!!\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – MAR. 10, 2024\n\nWow, it’s remarkable how it’s the Fourth Sunday of Lent already! We’re getting so much closer to the great celebration of Easter. The Gospel this weekend is so beautiful and arguably instantly recognizable by its well known verses, “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that anyone who believes in him might not perish, but might have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him” (John 3:16-17). John 3:16 is so widely known that it can be seen on billboards along the highway, the sides of buildings, and even in ordinary media. As with all Scripture, there must be something about that passage that deeply resonates with the human heart… and indeed there is.\n\nGod’s love is so great, his mercy so ever flowing, his heart so big – that out of love for us he wouldn’t hold anything back, even if it meant giving his own Son up to suffering and death. If anyone questions whether or not God loves them, all they need to do is look to that very act of Jesus on the cross. God loves each and every one of us as his sons and daughters. There may be times where we might feel unworthy, moments when we haven’t lived up to our best, instances of weakness… but even through all of those things, God’s love doesn’t leave us, but rather, invites us to come even closer to his embrace and experience conversion and forgiveness. Jesus promises new life and restoration to anyone and everyone who turns to him with a sincere heart and makes the decision to follow him. He willingly and happily enters into some of the most broken parts of our life and our world to offer us opportunities to experience healing and grace. Lent can feel like walking through a desert… our lives can sometimes feel like a desert too. We might be genuinely suffering: this truly may be a time that is really testing our faith and forcing us to dig deep to find meaning in the midst of it all. Yet the unchanging and eternal reality that Jesus is there walking beside and along with you remains true. God loves you. You are wanted. You are blessed.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – MAR. 3, 2024\n\nWe as humans have many characteristics that make us different from all of the other animals in the animal kingdom. We’re simply not like every other mammal! Each and every person has been made in the image and likeness of God and with that, has been given a particularly special gift: the gift of a rational soul and the freedom to make choices. Think about it! The fact that we have a rational soul is on display every day of our lives through our use of our intellect and free will. When we wake up in the morning, we can choose what to wear or what not to wear, when we’re hungry we can decide what restaurant we want to go to, who to go with, whether we want to order meat or fish! We can solve complex problems, show tremendous creativity, and build advanced technology… and the list goes go on and on and on.\n\nGod gave each one of us our intellect and free will so that we can identify what is good and choose to embrace it, while avoiding evil and those things that can take our eyes off of Jesus. The invitation of our faith is to always choose Jesus and follow his example! To move our mind and heart to make choices that draw us deeper into what is good, true, and beautiful. To treat others in the way that we would like to be treated. To make the decision to offer our lives in service out of love for God and love for neighbor without counting the cost. Choosing to follow Jesus is the path to true happiness and fulfillment!\n\nAs we journey through Lent, we have the power to use our freedom to put God in first place through our acts of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. Prayer keeps our minds focused on God and our relationship strong. Fasting helps us to deny ourselves so that we can give more attention to God. Using our freedom to be generous to others through our acts of almsgiving helps us to imitate in a small way, the immense self-giving love that Jesus showed to all people by the giving of his life on the cross.\n\nStaying strong in the promises and commitments we made this Lent requires determination, strength of will, and a heart that is open to receiving the grace of God. It’s awesome and inspiring to see more and more people deepening their faith and coming to Mass to receive that grace! Our community is growing stronger and we’re digging deep: allowing\n\nour hearts to mirror the generous and merciful heart of Jesus. Let’s continue to pray for one another as we follow in the footsteps of Christ together as a parish and remain steadfast in our Lenten commitments!\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – FEB. 25, 2024\n\nWe as Catholics have been given a tremendous gift. It’s something that we carry with us each and every day and is so much a part of our lives that at times, we could forget that it’s even there. That very real and very important gift is the gift of faith and our relationship with Jesus Christ. This is a time of year when we can really let our faith shine all the brighter by our increased prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. Our relationship with God is the foundation, and our works of fasting can contribute all the more to that relationship and our life of prayer.\n\nTypically when we speak of fasting, many of our thoughts could go immediately to fasting from food, which is true! Fasting from food is a traditional Lenten practice and is important. Even that feeling of craving some food item that we are letting go can be a physical reminder to draw our attention back to God. But fasting also can extend well beyond lessening our food consumption or not eating a particular thing we like. At its core, fasting is essentially an act of self-denial for the sake of Christ. It’s saying no to something that we would usually enjoy or easily have access to, for the sake of offering ourselves more and more to God, to put him at the center, to give him praise and honor.\n\nWe are so blessed. Walk into any grocery store and you’ll see plenty of food and items with so many choices it could be difficult to make a decision (for example, when we’re in the frozen section and see 5 different brands of plain vanilla ice cream or many brands of aluminum trays!). There are countless options for clothing, toys/games, cars, you name it! With the internet, we can have the information of the world at our fingertips in seconds. No need to wait… everything on demand. And while there’s certainly good things to say about all of that… there’s also something to be said about making the willing sacrifice to let some of it go during Lent. Jesus has everything! Yet, he chose to give everything and completely empty himself as St. Paul so beautifully writes, “though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God something to be grasped. Rather, he emptied himself. Taking the form of a slave, coming in human likeness; and found human in appearance, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross” (Philippians 2: 6-8).\n\nJesus gave everything for us… what can we sacrifice for him?\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nOur Thanks and Best Wishes to Sr. Josefina! I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude and best wishes to Sr. Josefina Morales who has been a resident in our PLC building for the last 8 years and a warm presence in our parish community. Sister informed me that she is preparing to take the next step of her journey and will be moving at the end of this month. Below is a message from Sr. Josefina to our parish community. Please join me in keeping Sr. Josefina and the mission entrusted to her and her religious community in our prayers during these days of Lenten journey! —Fr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – FEB. 18, 2024\n\nIt’s hard to believe that we are already a few days into Lent! Amazing how time flies. We are blessed to celebrate this holy season. It’s a time for inner renewal to take a few steps back, slow down, and really concentrate on our relationship with God. That’s what prayer, fasting, and almsgiving help us to do! Even the tradition of “giving something up” for Lent helps us to go deeper into faith if we do so with the right mindset and from a place of prayer.\n\nPrayer is the cornerstone of our relationship with God. It’s in prayer when we have the opportunity to share with Jesus the things that are going on with our lives and in turn allow Jesus into the mix of it all. Perhaps the most difficult part of prayer is not necessarily finding the words or coming up with ideas (Jesus wants us to be completely honest in prayer… no fluff needed!), but rather, with making the time to do it. Going deeper into prayer begins with making the commitment to God and ourselves that we are going to set aside some time in our busy days to work on our relationship with God. Whether it’s in the car stuck in traffic on the way to work or school, walking outside in nature, or kneeling inside the Church before the Blessed Sacrament in the Tabernacle, the time we take to speak with God matters!\n\nImagine having a spouse or good friend and never sharing anything with them or even talking to them… I would imagine that the relationship would be rocky at best, or at least start going downhill. Any type of serious relationship is born of trust, mutual respect, communication, and love among many other things. If you’re struggling with prayer or honestly haven’t done it often and want to make a change, start small. Take 10 minutes… or even just 5 good minutes… to speak with Jesus. Having trouble thinking of what to say? Maybe read some Scripture, be inspired by the love and mercy Jesus showed to all he met, place yourself in the story! It’s just one way of immersing ourselves in the presence of God. Another way might be to consider how your day went with the knowledge that Jesus wants to help: What went well? What could we have done better? What are we most grateful for? And if we’re still struggling… just having the discipline to sit in the silence and stillness with the intention to enter into prayer is a great start. Don’t give up easily! Be persistent. The Holy Spirit will inspire if we commit ourselves to trying!\n\nAs we journey through these days of Lent together, may the Lord inspire us with a prayerful heart and disposition so that we can grow in deeper union with him and with one another.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – FEB.11, 2024\n\nOne of the greatest challenges of evangelization, of going out to bring more people to follow Christ, is meeting people where they are. Our lives are very complicated! People have different experiences and life circumstances that shape the way they view the world and by extension… the views they may have toward faith as a whole. That can impact the way we can communicate our faith so that people can receive it and understand it well. All throughout the Scriptures, Jesus spoke in parables so that the people to whom he was speaking could relate and understand. He spoke the “language” of the people of his day. Similarly in today’s society, we can communicate the teachings of our faith that have stood firm for thousands of years in ways that people can understand and receive. The way we would speak and communicate with someone in the 1800s is different than how we would communicate today in 2024! Bishop Robert Barron and his “Word on Fire” ministry is just one of many widely known examples of Catholic leaders using YouTube and other social media to meet people where they are. With just a simple search online, we could find countless more examples even from right here in the Archdiocese of Newark!\n\nWe are approaching the season of Lent, a time of deepening our own relationship with God and experiencing conversion. If we remain faithful to the teachings of Jesus and his Church, reach out to our brothers and sisters whoever and wherever they may be, use our God-given gifts for the greater good, and live our life with Jesus and prayer at the center, God will use us as his instruments to bring hope, peace, and joy to the world. May God bless us all as we walk the journey together.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – FEB. 4, 2024\n\nAs disciples of Christ, each one of us is invited to share the love, joy, peace… and yes, even the challenges of living the Gospel with the people we encounter in our day to day life. That’s how faith spreads! Just think how amazing it is that our faith began with Jesus and his disciples in one region of the world and now spread throughout the entire earth. Now that shows the power of Christ and the message he brings at work! The same power of God is at work today as well.\n\nWe all have different personalities, skill sets, and interests that we can draw on to bring the Gospel to others. Are you good at sports? Then try to live and share the Gospel on the field by being supportive of teammates who might be struggling or by taking a moment to bring people together in prayer before a game. Have a particularly intellectual mindset? Then really dive deep into the Theology, Philosophy, and teachings of our faith to make convincing arguments for belief in Christ and the Church. Are you a good listener or story teller? Then take some time to listen to the stories of other people, show them genuine care, and take the step to share a little bit of your own journey and how faith helped you overcome life’s obstacles.\n\nThere are so many ways we can share our faith that there wouldn’t be enough space in the bulletin to list them all! When we speak to others, we all hold fast to the same Catholic Faith and the truth of its teachings, but can use our own life experience and stories to lead others to experience an encounter with Christ who\n\nloves them.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – JAN. 28, 2024\n\nI’m sure each one of us can relate to a feeling of being anxious. Our minds are filled with so many things! Concerns about supporting our families and raising children, feelings of pressure to deliver high performance at work or school, and perhaps one of the most common fears of all… fear of the unknown. It can be so easy to get sucked into the vortex of anxiety and sometimes it can feel that there isn’t a way out. Yet, it is exactly in those moments when we feel the most vulnerable, that the Lord Jesus reaches out his hand even more to bring a little peace and comfort.\n\nThere is no technology, philosophy, or any other thing in the world that can predict the future 100%, every single time. We as people of faith don’t experience peace and tranquility because we have all the answers to our problems and have some kind of foresight into the future! We can experience hope and peace even in the most difficult of circumstances because we trust that God has a plan for us. Jesus knows the challenges we face now, those we will encounter in the future, and equips us to be able to respond from a position of strength. The key to unlocking inner peace in the midst of adversity and uncertainty is to keep our eyes fixed on Jesus. He shines as a bright light, a beacon that we can be drawn to and follow when all other lights are out.\n\nWhat has been in your heart these days? Is there something deep down that you feel should be brought to the Lord? Have we made a good effort to invite Jesus into our heart? Just think… if sharing some of our struggles with friends or family members can be helpful (as we hopefully recognize and experience the loving presence and support of others), how much MORE care and support we can feel from sharing with the Lord, whose ability to love and support us is infinite! It just takes some time in prayer and a willingness to be open and honest with God. Some of the greatest moments of healing I’ve experienced came from spending some quiet time with the Lord. Time might be hard to find, especially with our busy schedules, so be creative! Even turning the car radio off and spending that time driving in quiet with God can have a positive impact. May we recognize the love of Jesus for each one of us today and always.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – JAN. 21, 2024\n\nIf we take a good honest look at our lives, I think all of us in some way, shape, or form can recognize a need for healing, for a fresh start, for improvement and growth. Life, our discipleship, is a journey that goes through many phases. At some points along the way in our personal lives, we might feel really strong: things are working out well for us, everyone seems happy, the future looks bright! Yet, there are also those times where we might feel that things just aren’t working out, that there are problems within our family or with friends, and that the future feels dim. There is nothing wrong in admitting that we have some personal weaknesses or struggles and need God’s help to overcome them. Admitting that we need God’s help is a first step toward healing and deepening our own faith! In fact, there is a beautiful passage in St. Paul’s letter to the Corinthians related to this very topic: “…but he [the Lord] said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.’ I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me. Therefore I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and constraints for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong” (2 Corinthians 12:9-10).\n\nHow beautiful is that! Even in the times when we are at our weakest and need the most help, we are still made strong by the power of Christ. Turning to Jesus with humility, trusting him, and asking for his grace is a part of being a disciple and makes us strong. We don’t have all the answers for every problem, we might not always have an easy solution or a clear path forward… but the Lord Jesus knows how to give us that extra boost we need to make it through.\n\nWith God’s grace, we can overcome any adversity- and the individual challenges we face are many. We might struggle with self doubt, anxiety, or fear of the unknown. Yet the Lord remains there to keep us held high. Think of the strength that God gave young David as he faced the monster Goliath. People surely thought he was too weak, that he couldn’t possibly win, and he ended up victorious later becoming a great king. Even more modern figures like Mother Teresa had to struggle: there were periods in her own life where she felt internally empty and alone- in a type of spiritual desert. Yet, she was able to persevere in faith, care for so many people, and bring the light of Christ to them.\n\nSo be confident! Stay strong. Jesus reaches out his hand to us in this very moment to give us whatever help we need. It might not happen overnight, it might take time, but when we stand side by side with Jesus in faith, we know that we don’t face our struggles alone. Reach back out to him with faith and hope! Jesus is here for us all.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – JAN. 14, 2024\n\nWell, we’re off to a great start to 2024!!! I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our Music Director Monroe Quinn, our instrumentalists, cantors, choir, and everyone who helped to make our Christmas Concert such a beautiful event for our parish. We are grateful for your ministry and for the joy that you have brought to all of us here at St. Joe’s by your gift of music!\n\nI feel moved deep in my heart when I read Scripture passages where God is calling someone to a mission. Whether it is the call of Samuel like in the first reading this weekend or when Jesus called his first disciples, or really any other time (there are plenty of moments to choose from)! How beautiful it is to be called, to be chosen by the Lord. The Lord calls each one of us by name (Is 43:1) for a special purpose. Each one of us has been given a unique set of gifts, our personalities, our skills to help build up one another in faith, to be of service to others, to bring the presence of Christ into the world. There are so many people today who are searching for meaning, trying to find purpose in their life, trying to understand what they can bring to the world. Jesus brings meaning, purpose, and hope to our lives!!! He gives us our mission and saying yes to Him brings joy to the heart. God calls each one of us everyday to bring kindness, love, and peace into the places where we live, work, and spend time with others. We ALL have a role to play whether we are still in school, working one or many jobs to support our families, or happily retired. Each one of us has a mission!\n\nYes, life can be hectic sometimes; yes we have a lot of obligations for work or school or our home life; yes there are days when we might not have time to do much other than check things off the seemingly endless list of tasks to do! But it is so important in our search for meaning to take some quiet time with the Lord: to ask Jesus, “What do you want me to do?” We might just be surprised by what he says! We might hear him speak to our heart and think, “oh no way can I do that!” That’s a natural reaction, but the one thing I’ve learned over the years is that when God calls us to mission, he equips us with exactly what we need to get the job done. The Lord will never abandon you and me. He will always be there to help. May each one of us have the courage to open ourselves to Christ and respond with generous hearts.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – JAN. 7, 2024\n\nThis Christmas Season, I’m sure we’ve all experienced in some way what it feels like to give and to receive. It is such a wonderful time of year to show our love for each other, and our love of Christ. Families together opening presents, celebrating the birth of Jesus, just enjoying each other’s company. There is such joy and satisfaction in giving isn’t there? It’s a joy that comes from putting the other person first, from really thinking about what they would enjoy, and from seeing their reaction once the present is unwrapped… among so many other things! Truly, as St. Francis so beautifully put it, “it is in giving that we receive.” The wise men brought precious gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the newborn Christ to give him honor; they were overjoyed when they saw the star leading to his birthplace and they wanted to do him homage (see Matthew 2:10-11).\n\nI’m sure during this Christmas season, we’ve all received our fair share of gifts and hopefully we have given our fair share too! It feels good to know that someone was thinking about us and cared enough to give us a present or a warm Christmas card. As we come to an end of the Christmas Season and get deeper into this New Year, perhaps we could ask ourselves, “What gift could I give to God?” “How could I give God honor this year?” The gift of ourselves, of our mind and heart, of our love, devotion, and faith is perhaps one of the greatest gifts we can give to the Lord. Putting God in first place in our lives isn’t always easy, but with the help of his grace, we can strive each day to give more and more of our heart to him, to spend some extra time in prayer, and to reach out to others who may be in need. May the Lord bless you and your families this coming week and always.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – DEC. 31, 2023\n\nWell…we made it! Here we are at the last bit of 2023 and getting ready to make the leap into 2024. We really never know what a new year will bring… but one thing that we can all count on is that Jesus will be walking right beside us, guiding us through whatever ups and downs we will face. Just think, regardless of what we went through in 2023… we are still here now! Some things that we experienced this past year may have been very hard. There may have been losses in our life or things that didn’t go the way we’ve planned. But we are still here! God helped us to get through. We never walk the journey alone, and in fact the feast day we celebrate this weekend gives us a great insight into that! Jesus was born into a family with his mother Mary and his foster father Joseph. They stayed together, cared for one another, and loved each other.\n\nWe all were born into a family too! We have our individual families or extended relatives who love, nurture, and support us. Perhaps we might have some “issues” that we need to work out… but in the end, we have God and each other. By the grace of our Baptism, we also have the family of the Church as well as our own individual families! All of us are a part of God’s family as his beloved sons and daughters. Isn’t that something? Just think, the family portrait would be huge!!! God our Father gives us his support and love no matter what difficulties we face. He looks out for us and wants the absolute best for us. He would do anything for us without counting the cost…, “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life” (John 3:16). We begin this new year together walking as disciples of Christ…together as the parish community of St. Joseph. May God continue to richly bless our vibrant, growing parish and all of us who call St. Joseph’s our spiritual home in this new year and always. Happy New Year!\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – Dec. 24, 2023\n\nThis Christmas and indeed every Christmas, we celebrate in a very special way the faithfulness of God who loves each and every one of us so deeply. Just think, God’s love for us is so great that knowing our weakness, He sent His son Jesus into the world, born humbly in a manger. He knows us through and through, “for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has similarly been tested in every way, yet without sin” (Hebrews 4:15). He understands what it means to celebrate, the joy of being together with family and friends, and yes… even how it feels to mourn the losses that we have in our lives. Jesus is there for you and for me at every moment of our life, even in those times when we feel most alone.\n\nWe as Catholic Christians have a very special message. That Jesus Christ truly lived, that he suffered death on the cross for our sake, and that he rose again and ascended into heaven to open for us the path to eternal life. This is a day of hope. There is nothing that God wouldn’t do for each one of us so that we could experience true happiness… even to the point of sending His Son to die on the cross. “No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends” (John 15:13).\n\nIf this is your first time here at St. Joseph’s, or if it’s been a while, please know that you are very welcome here with us in our community of faith. We are strong together, united by the Baptism that we share as we strive each day to follow Jesus as his disciples. The world needs Jesus. We need Jesus. He is the source of peace, joy, and light that we crave as human beings and we all have a role in spreading the love of Christ to everyone we meet. So, live joyfully in the light of Christ! Celebrate this day well. Yes, open presents… yes, enjoy a great meal… yes, share stories with family and friends. But don’t forget the true reason that we celebrate… the Gift of Jesus Christ to you, me, and our entire world. There is no greater gift that we could ever ask for and receive. How blessed we truly are.\n\nBest wishes for a Very Merry Christmas to you and your families.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA Note from Fr. Christian – Dec.17, 2023\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to give my sincere thanks to everyone who helped us on Friday, December 8th, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, when the relic of St. Jude visited our parish. It was such a beautiful experience for us as a community and there are so many people who came together to make the day a success, from our dedicated staff members, to our countless volunteers who gave some, if not all of their day to help us (if I started giving names the list would be way too long!). Please know that you and all of our volunteers are all so greatly and deeply appreciated. This is what being a community of faith is all about… allowing the grace of Christ to work through us, coming together as a parish family to help each other, sharing our love for Jesus, and going out to help others come to know God’s love. IT’S INSPIRING! We are so richly blessed here at St. Joe’s.\n\nAs we enter the third week of Advent, the last full week before the great celebration of Christmas (since the Fourth Sunday of Advent falls on December 24th), we have a nice opportunity to take inventory of where we stand on our journey of faith. How have these days of Advent been for you and your families? Have they been peaceful or a bit hectic? Do we feel spiritually ready to welcome Jesus into our heart this Christmas? It is a challenging time of year for sure with all of the preparations we have going on for Christmas in addition to our other school, work, or home obligations. But, regardless of how these days have been or what is coming for the days ahead… know that Jesus is with you and has been with you each and every day. Take a moment, even if it is a short one, to acknowledge his presence, to ask for his grace, and to experience his love. He never turns anyone who seeks him away, but welcomes us with open arms. May God continue to bless us all.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – Dec. 10, 2023\n\nWe are now entering the second week of the Season of Advent! I hope these days leading up to the great celebration of Christmas have been and are beautiful times for you and your families. I‘ve always been fascinated by the changing of seasons… both in the climate and in the Church. When seasons change, the things around us change too, giving a different “feel” to what we experience. The hot and humid heat of Summer is very different from the cold and snowy nature of Winter. The multicolored leaves of Fall are different from the new green growth of Spring. As we move into a new Church season, the things around us change too! In Advent, the green vestments of the priest and altar linens are replaced by purple, there are not as many decorations around the church, we do not sing the Gloria at Mass, the music changes, the readings focus on themes of hope, peace, preparation for the coming of Christ, and many others. We are in a new season!\n\nThe days and weeks leading up to Christmas are surely very busy for all of us. Making plans for dinners and get-togethers, going out to try to find the perfect gifts for our family and friends, and even decorating the house inside and out can take a lot of time and effort! All of it could easily get exhausting. That’s where truly entering into the spiritual nature of Advent can really help. It’s a time to joyfully wait for the coming of the newborn Christ. A time, perhaps in our own mind and heart, to enter into a bit of stillness… To take some time each day or week to spend some quiet time with the Lord. To allow his peace and love and gentleness to touch our hearts. It’s surprising just how big of an impact a few moments of silence and prayer with the Lord each day can have! Give it a try! As we get closer to Christmas, I pray that we will all take the opportunity these days to rest in the gentle arms of Christ, and be ready to welcome him this Christmas. Peace and blessings to you and your families.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – Nov. 26, 2023\n\nThere are a lot of things that can come to mind when we think of a King. Perhaps its an image of a man from a movie or cartoon show, dressed in purple flowing garments, wearing a golden crown, holding a scepter in his hand as he sits confidently upon a marble throne. It could be an image of a strong dictator who looks down on his subjects as he rules his kingdom with little concern for the individual lives of his people. Or… we could imagine a benevolent king, one who rules with gentleness, kindness, and compassion. A person who gives and sacrifices himself for others. A person who desires to know and to love each and every person he serves.\n\nThis weekend, we celebrate Jesus as our King. But he’s a king unlike any other. He is a king who is slow to anger, rich in love and mercy- a king who loves his people so much so that he went to the Cross for their salvation, a king who traded the golden crown that would rightly belong to him for the pain of the crown of thorns and the suffering of crucifixion, a king who put others before himself and knelt to wash the feet of his disciples. He is humble and is a shepherd who guides his flock with loving care and concern. He seeks out the lost to bring them home, the wounded to bring them healing, and those who are lonely to bring them company. Jesus leaves no one behind. How blessed we are to be his disciples and strive to follow his example!\n\nThe world is in desperate need of Jesus… we are in need of Jesus. There is a beautiful healing that can come from opening our mind and heart to Christ. He reaches out to each one of us with arm outstretched whether we are filled with joy, or feeling burdened by anxiety and grief. There is no problem that is too big or too small for Jesus… he understands and wants to be with us to help. Perhaps as we enter into a new week, we can all make a deliberate effort to open our hearts more deeply to Jesus in prayer and to imitate his good works by doing an act of kindness for someone else. May God bless you and your families now and always.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – Nov. 19, 2023\n\nIt’s hard to believe that we are on the second to last weekend of November isn’t it? Personally I can’t believe it. Amazing how time flies. This week we are approaching the beautiful day of Thanksgiving where many families across the country will gather to share a meal and quality time with each other. I hope Thanksgiving day will be special for all of us. As Catholics, the concept of giving thanks or gratitude is very significant in developing and maintaining a healthy spiritual life! If we’re honest with ourselves, I’m sure we can point to at least a few instances where we’ve spent our prayer time asking God for something. “Lord, please help me get x, y, or z; Lord help me, Lord give me the strength…” It’s not a bad thing to ask God for grace or success in our life, but it’s also very important to remember to give thanks to God for the gifts that we have already been given. It can be easy to forget the “thank you!” Even in the Scripture where Jesus heals the 10 lepers… only one of the 10 returned to give thanks: “And one of them, realizing he had been healed, returned, glorifying God in a loud voice; and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan. Jesus said in reply, “Ten were cleansed, were they not? Where are the other nine? Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?” Then he said to him, “Stand up and go; your faith has saved you” (Luke 17:15-19).\n\nWe have so many things to be grateful for. The gift of our family, our friends, the ability to worship together… the list can go on and on. In moments when we are feeling down or thinking that nothing is going right, counting our blessings can have a tremendously uplifting effect. Even on our worst day, we still have many things to be grateful for… the very gift of life, the gift of being called children of God, the gift of knowing that God loves us deeply and holds each one of us by the hand.\n\nOne thing that I felt grateful for as I reflect on this upcoming Thanksgiving is you, the people of St. Joseph parish. You are the people who make this parish truly special and the welcoming home that it is. You make up the families who bring vibrancy into our Church! You are the beloved sons and daughters of Christ who are committed to growing in love of God and love of neighbor each day and who want to make positive impacts on the world. It is inspiring to see your faith in action and to have the privilege of accompanying you on your journeys of faith and indeed, being a part of our journey as a parish in following Jesus.\n\nMay God richly bless you and your families.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – Nov. 12, 2023\n\nAlmost everything that we do in life requires some form of preparation. Whether it’s something simple like deciding what to make or buy for dinner or things that are more complicated like deciding on a new career. We put a lot of forethought into planning for things that we care about. If sports is our thing, then practice is a priority to succeed. If we want to get a good career or job, working hard and studying are important. If we are interested in a major project like a home renovation, careful planning and selection\n\nof materials are needed. Frankly, life has a funny way of teaching us a lesson when we’re not prepared for something as much as we should be… I speak from my own personal experiences! It’s pretty easy to spot when someone is prepared vs someone who is unprepared. If someone didn’t study for a test, it’s likely they’d get a low grade. If someone keeps skipping practice whether it’s for sports or musical instruments, it’s likely they won’t perform well. Some of those things are obvious. But what isn’t always so easy to see from the outside is how prepared we are in our life of faith.\n\nIt’s important for all of us, as disciples of Christ, to make our faith and the practice of our faith a priority in our lives. It starts with the choice to care and to want Jesus to be a big part of our lives. Living a life of discipleship and faith takes work, time, effort… and yes, even some planning! There’s a lot of things competing for our attention these days. So it’s important for us to intentionally and deliberately choose to make our faith a part of our daily life. To see the gift of Jesus and the workings of the Holy Spirit in our midst each day. Perhaps scheduling some silent prayer time on the calendar, even if it’s in between dropping the children off at the game or running to and from the store. Maybe taking some time to read Scripture before bed. How about even researching some things about our faith learning more about Catholic Social Teaching or Ethics or really anything pertaining to our Church teaching to gain deeper understandings? After studying for years in the seminary, it’s amazing just how deep and profound our faith really is! The Lord waits for us with open arms. May we be ready to meet him and receive him with open arms of our own.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – Nov. 5, 2023\n\nA few weeks ago, there was a large Eucharistic procession through the streets of NYC, the videos of which are all over the internet. Thousands of people took part. While watching different clips from the procession, I was very moved to see the reaction of the people. Not just the tremendous and beautiful faith of the people walking in the procession, who more likely than not, were fully aware of the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist – but also the interest of the people passing by who may have had no idea what was happening. People of other faiths or maybe even those with no faith who were casually walking by doing their business. Cell phones were out taking videos of the extraordinary event that was taking place in their midst. People were drawn to the Eucharist. There were no flashing lights or special effects— just the presence of Jesus in the midst of the business of the city.\n\nPeople are hungry deep within their soul for Jesus and the peace, love, and joy that comes from following him. The world today has so many distractions, from modern technology to the anxieties that plague our mind and heart. We might try running from one thing to another, trying to keep busy, hoping to fill the emptiness with whatever we can find or to distract ourselves from the pain that can be within. But ultimately, anything less than Jesus doesn’t work in the long term. Temporary relief may come, but it is only just that… temporary. Eternal peace and security comes only from Christ.\n\nThe Lord always extends a hand inviting us to draw closer. Allowing him into our heart doesn’t take anything fancy or expensive… but it does require us to make a choice and to be firm in that choice. To use our free will to let him in. To say, “Lord Jesus, I want you to come into my life. I want to experience your love. I want to know you more.” Once we make that choice to put God in first place and remain committed to our own spiritual growth as disciples, he does the rest as long as our dedication to following him remains firm. May God bless you today and always.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – Oct. 30, 2023\n\nThere’s a lot of things to “love” about life! We can love a particular type of food, a certain vacation destination or place, cars, movies, the list goes on and on. “Love” is a term that we frequently and casually use. But from the perspective of faith, true love has a much more profound meaning. A deep meaning that flows from the heart of God and from our hearts to others. God loves each and every one of us with such a depth that he even sent his son Jesus to us. Jesus, though completely pure and innocent, suffered, died, and rose again for the sake of you and me because he loves us that much. Talk about deep!\n\nAs disciples of Christ, we too are called to love and to model our love on that of Christ. First, to love God above all things, “…with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind (Matthew 22:37) and to then, “…love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:39). It’s not always easy to show this kind of love because it requires, on some level, sacrifice on our part and a willingness to put God and others before ourselves. There are many ways that we can show our love for God and our love for our neighbor. We can show our love for God by making the sacrifice of time in prayer or by making the effort to frequently come to Mass. We can show our love for others by sacrificing something we would like to do so that another person in our life could enjoy what they would like. There are many more examples, far too numerous to list here. As disciples we are invited to look into our hearts to find more ways to let our love for God and others shine. As we begin a new week, may we have the grace to put God in first place in our lives, and to truly care for and love others as fellow beloved sons and daughters of God.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN – Oct. 23, 2023\n\nContinuing to grow in faith, following Jesus as his disciples, learning to cope with the many issues we face takes time, patience, and endurance. Despite all of the “modern comforts and conveniences” that we have, anxiety, fear and loneliness seem to be higher than ever, even with technology that allows us to be in contact with anyone, anywhere, anytime. Libraries are filled with “self-help” books with authors who seek to help their readers experience some level of peace in the midst of struggle, yet none of them really seem to be enough. Many people claim to have the answer… yet fall short in some way. In reality, there is only one person who truly knows how to touch our hearts and instill peace. That person is Jesus.\n\nJesus knows each one of us through and through, “before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I dedicated you, a prophet to the nations I appointed you” (Jeremiah 1:5). Sure, there are many people who know us- friends, family, colleagues- but no one knows us fully like the Lord who made us does. And he wants us to be happy! To really be happy. Not just for a moment or two, not just when things are going our way, but for each day of our lives despite the challenges or struggles we might encounter.\n\nHow do we experience this happiness? How can we recognize the encounters with God’s love that we have? Through prayer, speaking with God, inviting God into the different moments of our life. That’s partly where the time, patience, and endurance comes in. Coming to know God better, realizing who we are as beloved sons and daughters of Christ, getting the strength to cope with hardship, comes when we make the effort to put God in first place. Prayer is something that we can do with anyone, anywhere, anytime and is a significant part of developing our relationship with Christ, who always reaches out to us with arm outstretched. Perhaps as we enter a new week, we can renew our commitment to prayer and invite God to touch our heart in new and beautiful ways.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – Oct. 15, 2023\n\nAs we continue with our Increased Offertory Campaign (which I am delighted to say is already showing positive results for our parish), I feel that now is an excellent time to\n\nintroduce a “relatively new” committee that I have created called the “Advancement Team.” This committee, comprised of members who have served or are currently serving on\n\nthe Pastoral Council, Finance Council, Fundraising Committee, and other parish groups, has a mission. Its mission is, along with me, to look forward to and to plan for our future as we continue to journey in Christ. In fact, all of the speakers that you heard from a few weeks ago in our witness talks are members of this team! We are dedicated. We have a vision. We are making a plan. Above all, each member loves this parish and wants us to thrive, as does every single one of our parishioners and families. Prior to Msgr. Hubba’s passing, I had asked his blessing for me to start this committee. I am so grateful that the creation of this group and its mission had his support. Now as we continue to look toward our bright future, the Advancement Team has been meeting to plan for some exciting things that will come our way in the next few years (planning takes a lot of time!). In fact, the parish survey which we did a few months ago and the Increased Giving Program in which we are participating was planned and executed (along with our staff) with the support of this team once we saw that our weekly collections need to increase before any of our future dreams can become realities. The workings of this committee are (and have been) reported not only to me, but also to our parish Trustees, Finance Council, and Pastoral Councils. As plans continue to develop and ideas continue to form, new initiatives will be shared with the larger parish community. The support of our families is paramount in anything that we do! We are a community and work best when we are all united. I am excited for the future of St. Joseph’s as we walk together to continue allowing our thriving community to shine here in Bergen County!\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nAdvancement Team Members: Fr. Christian Scalo, Parish Administrator; Carol Winkler, Parish Trustee; Phil DeRosa, Chair; Sharon Murdock, Secretary; Mark Alleman; Gerard Maron; Tom Moran; Mike Petrella; Eric Shuler; Jen Sullivan\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – Oct. 8, 2023\n\nAnxiety is a very real experience for many of us these days. Whether it’s “the fear of missing out” that so many of us feel in the era of social media and instant communication, or the concerns we might have trying to support our family/friends through difficult times, or the fear and nervousness brought on due to any other particular reason (insert your situation here…. the sky is the limit!), our minds and hearts seek security and certainty. To know that everything will be ok. To feel like we are not alone in our struggle, but are supported and loved all the way through.\n\nWhatever the anxiety or fear or concerns you may have, and they can be different for everyone, know that you are NEVER alone. The reality is that none of us are ever alone even if we’re the only person sitting at the dinner table. Turn to Christ in prayer. The Lord Jesus is present in our midst. He who loved us from the very beginning, the one who suffered and died for our sake, the one who rose again opening the path to eternal life, sits right beside us waiting for us to lean into his heart for peace. Jesus wants to bring us peace in the midst of fear, security when the things and circumstances around us seem to be falling apart, and company when it feels like everyone has left us behind to fend for ourselves. He wants us to know that we are loved.\n\nWe as the people of St. Joseph parish are on this journey called life together. We support and love each other, striving each day to let the love of Christ shine through our words and deeds. We are good hearted people who pray for one another. Jesus is doing beautiful and amazing things with us and for us each day. Sometimes it may be difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but with the grace of God there is no mountain that we can’t climb, no obstacle we can’t overcome, no circumstance that we can’t endure if we bring them to prayer and sincerely ask the Lord for help. Perhaps St. Paul said it best, “have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God. Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:6-7).\n\nMay God bless you and your families today and always.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – Oct. 1, 2023\n\nLife doesn’t always seem fair on the surface does it? I think we all have had moments from time to time when we’ve thought something should have happened for us that didn’t, when someone else got the credit for the work when it should have been ours, when a success or honor was bestowed on someone else when we thought should have come our way. Sometimes when we’re feeling like things aren’t the way they “should” be, it’s helpful to think about the mental and physical anguish that Jesus experienced on his way to the cross. He was unjustly condemned, he did no wrong… but he still submitted to a punishment that he didn’t deserve and went to the cross to save us: the innocent for the sake of the guilty, the sinless for the sake of the sinful, the master for the sake of the servant. How blessed we are that Jesus did that for us! He gave us reason to hope. He paid the price of a debt that was not his, so that we could be free. By his suffering, death, and resurrection Jesus brought redemption to us and opened the path to salvation. His death destroyed death, and his rising restored our life.\n\nSo yes…indeed there may be times when things don’t go our way or things don’t seem to be fair. It’s just part of life. But the good news is that Jesus understands what it feels like and is ready to accompany us through the trial, to grab our hand and pull us up when we’re down, and to embrace us with arms outstretched to forgive us for our own failings when we come to seek it with a sincere heart. Stay strong in faith! The Lord walks with you today and always.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – Sept. 24, 2023\n\nThis weekend we are introducing our Increased Offertory Program at all of our Masses. I am truly excited to introduce this program to all of us here at St. Joe’s! It is an opportunity not only for us to increase our support for the parish that we love, but also to draw attention to the needs of our parish and bring an increased awareness to the spirituality surrounding giving as we move together into the future.\n\nWe will outline what St. Joseph’s is embarking on over the course of the next 2 months as well as the reasons we need to address our Sunday offertory collection. Hopefully by now or within the next few days you will receive a mailing which highlights the reason for and urgency of this program. Each mailing will have a confidential reply card included. After prayerful reflection (and discussion) we ask you to please consider filling out that card and returning it to us in the provided envelope, the Sunday collection basket, or at\n\nthe parish office.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of what we are embarking on, why we are addressing these needs, and how you can be a part of it. As we move forward with the program, you will be provided with more information and updates on our progress. In addition, you will be hearing from some of our fellow parishioners when they share their experiences of our parish through lay witness talks. I sincerely thank all of you who have so generously supported St. Joseph’s over the years and for your consideration of supporting this important endeavor. Your support and presence in our parish community truly make St. Joe’s what it is today – a loving, welcoming, and inviting home for all who walk through our doors.\n\nMay God continue to richly bless you for the love and kindness that you share with our parish.\n\nIt makes a difference!\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nMinistry Growth and Outreach!\n\nWe have so many ministries to be grateful for here at St. Joe’s; ministries that cater to all ages and are kept alive and running smoothly by the dedication of countless volunteers. We are blessed with a large Religious Education Program, a vibrant Youth Ministry and Young Adult Group, our parish Care Corner, an active and growing Men’s and Women’s Cornerstone, multiple volunteer opportunities, Ministries of Worship, and Adult Faith Formation opportunities. These are among the many examples of how we work together here as a parish and live our lives in a Christ-like way. Our Community Outreach Programs continue to provide services responsive to the needs of the larger community and our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. And we are especially conscious of the needs of the Mission Church throughout the world.\n\nWhy must we address our offertory?\n\nSt. Joe’s is and continues to be a growing and vibrant community! In order to keep our parish vibrant and serve the needs of our parish community, coupled with the rising cost of goods and services in general, our expenses have noticeably increased. With the active participation of our Finance Council, the expanded ministries and parish expenses are closely monitored to ensure that our finances remain fiscally strong. For some time now, our Sunday collections have been trending downward and do not meet our financial obligations. Therefore, it is extremely important that we continue to remain prudent and proactive as we manage our finances to secure our future.\n\nWe invite you to consider……\n\nWe invite each registered household to reflect on their current financial support and prayerfully consider increasing that commitment to the parish. A consistent and modest increase from all our parishioners will help us to better address our existing financial needs, as well as plan for our future. Every donation helps and is truly appreciated.\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – Sept. 17, 2023\n\nJesus came so that we would have life and experience it to the full (see John 10:10). He came to break the chains that hold us down including those that way heavily on our heart\n\neach day. Ever held a grudge against someone? Exchanged harsh words? Maybe refused to help someone, or harbored some negative thoughts in our mind and heart after a person did us wrong? It’s true, there’s sin in the world and at times we ourselves fall in one way or another. But that’s not all! There’s also goodness, beauty, truth… there’s the love of Christ that has been poured into our hearts and the gift of forgiveness that the Lord extends to us each day. Unfortunately our “issues” those past, present, or anticipated don’t just immediately fall away all the time. Faith in Jesus doesn’t mean that all of our problems suddenly disappear! It means at very least that Christ the Savior walks with us each day, that we can be secure placing our faith and trust in God, that we have the grace to live from a place of peace and hope that tomorrow will be even better than today. As a parish we hold each other in prayer. My prayer for each and every one of us is that we will experience the peace and joy that only the Lord can give; that even in the midst of challenging of circumstances, we will have the courage to entrust our cares to him. “Cast all your worries upon Him, because He cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7).\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – Sept. 10, 2023\n\nOne of the things that we are all invited to do as Catholics is to love one another and to follow Jesus’ example of what it means to love. The word “love” gets used a lot. I’m sure we’ve all said or heard someone say, “I love that movie” or “I love that restaurant” or phrases like that. Those are more colloquial uses of the word “love” and are usually associated with some sort of enjoyment or pleasure that something gives to us. But from the perspective of faith, true love is not simply an emotion or a feeling- it’s so much deeper than that. In fact to adequately explain all of the dimensions of love we would need more pages than the bulletin has! Love is fundamental to everything that our faith teaches. In fact, when asked by a scholar of the law which commandment in the law is the greatest, Jesus said, “…you shall love the Lord, your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and first commandment. The second is like it: you shall love your neighbor as yourself. The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments” (Matthew 22:37-40). In the living of our daily lives, love is a choice that we make and is a virtue! In fact it is the greatest of what we call the “Theological Virtues” as St. Paul puts it, “So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love” (1 Cor 13:13).\n\nWe can disagree with someone’s point of view, we might not support 100% of everything they do, we might not even be interested in a “friendship” with a particular person; yet, we can still love them for who they are as a beloved son or daughter in Christ. We can even be angry with someone and still love them! And that can have a transformative effect on our own life and that of another…deep within our hearts we all desire to be loved.\n\nJesus showed us the greatest love, a self-sacrificial love, when He suffered and died on the cross to save us from our sins, “no one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends” (John 15:13). Love is humble and gentle, love wants the best for the other, love is patient (see 1 Cor 13:4-7). Doing something for someone else, going the extra mile, giving of our time, our talent, or our material possessions are just a few ways we can show love for others. As we enter a new week together as a parish, maybe we can go forward with a firm commitment to show a greater love for our brothers and sisters, whether it be for our family, friends, fellow parishioners… or perhaps… for someone that we do not even know by name.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – Sept. 3, 2023\n\nWell, it’s that time of year again! Many of our college students have returned to school and our high school/elementary schoolers are on their way back soon as well. They are all in my prayers! As the schedules start to become more complicated for everyone, I think it’s really important to start the school year off right by remembering the daily presence of God that walks with us. Especially when things get hectic with homework, sporting events, and other obligations that pop up, it’s important to not only enjoy those things and work hard, but also to make sure we devote time to nourishing our soul by practicing our faith. Don’t forget to pray and come to the Sacraments! It makes a difference for the better in our lives. Even the smallest efforts day to day to bring Jesus into our lives matter and, of course, our commitment to coming to worship Christ in the Eucharist remains important.\n\nNo matter what this upcoming year will bring, Jesus will be there offering peace, comfort, and love. Thank you for your gift of faith and sincere desire to grow in love and service to Christ! It has an impact on us all for the better.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – July 16, 2023\n\nSpring/Summer has classically been associated with a time for growth. The days are longer, the temperature warmer, and the climate is right for helping the nature that surrounds us to develop and flourish. Just taking a short drive down the street we can see beautiful flowers, trees, and other plants/animals teeming with life. When the soil is rich plants grow strong, but if the soil has its nutrients depleted growth can be stunted or in severe cases, not even begin. To grow, plants need care, attention, and nourishment. Our spiritual lives too need care, attention, and nourishment as we walk on the road of faith.\n\nJesus sows seeds for us day in and day out- gifts of grace, words of peace and love through the Scriptures, moments and opportunities in our lives for us to give and to receive love, kindness, and mercy. While these seeds are indeed sown in abundance and without cost, it’s important for us as people journeying as disciples to be aware of the condition (the soil if you will) of our heart and soul. Sometimes our hearts can be heavy and burdened from past wounds in our life, laden with guilt, in need of healing. It is difficult for a hardened heart to receive- kind of like those seeds in the Scripture that are sown on rocky ground and are unable to effectively take root. But the good news is that we are never ever left on our own. If we say “yes” and allow Jesus to enter into our hearts, into those places where life has become burdensome, where things have become dry, where guilt has taken hold… the once depleted and infertile soil can become renewed and ready to receive life. Jesus will gladly give that refreshment to everyone and anyone who desires it.\n\nSo why not start the process of renewal today? If your heart has been heavy for one reason or another (we’ve all got something!), take a moment even while reading this note, to ask Jesus to bring healing. It starts with recognizing the need deep within, our own limitations, and simply asking God for his help. Maybe our prayer could be something like this…, “Heavenly Father, we give you thanks and praise for the love that you shower down upon us. You are always willing to bring your gift of healing to all who seek it with sincerity. My heart has been (insert here the particular feelings…lonely, anxious, fearful, etc). I ask with faith for your healing touch to bring me refreshment and peace, so that my heart will be truly healed and ready to receive all of the abundant blessings that you have in store for me. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.”\n\nMay God Bless you and your families today and always.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – July 9, 2023\n\nWhen the cares of our lives become heavy, where do we turn? On those days when we feel like giving up, what helps us get through? In whom do we put our trust? Our lives are complicated and it can feel like sometimes we are being pulled in so many directions and have so many concerns that there aren’t enough hours in the day to address them all! We might be facing a difficulty at work or home, maybe someone we care for is having a hard time in life and we want to help, perhaps our own minds are suffering from anxiety or fear over one thing or another. It’s common for people to try to find some relief in the things of the world: self-help books, social media, other forms of entertainment. But eventually, even the best of “worldly solutions” falls short. The most secure, guaranteed place to find refuge is in the arms of Jesus.\n\nJesus wants to help us carry the burdens that we face in our lives. We will never be free of struggles…they’re just part of living life and being human. But, Jesus invites we who are weary and burdened to come to him, and promises that we will be given rest (see Matthew 11:28-30). Jesus will help us stay strong in the midst of adversity, give us wisdom for making important decisions, and send hope in times where things seem bleak. “Cast all your worries upon him,” the Scripture says, “because he cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7). We can be confident that Jesus will help us throughout our lives precisely because he cares for each one of us. He showed the level of his care, how far he would be willing to go for us, when he suffered, died, and rose again to give us a path to eternal life with him. God will look out for you and for me always.\n\nOur job is to exercise our muscles of faith and to have the courage to ask him to come into our heart and help us carry our crosses.\n\nWith prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nA NOTE FROM FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – July 2, 2023\n\nIn a few days, we as a nation will celebrate the Fourth of July, a day dedicated to recognizing our independence and freedom as a nation. A special thank you to all who currently serve or have served in the military and their families. We honor the sacrifices that you all have made to keep our country safe and preserve the liberty that we cherish as Americans.\n\nYou know… the concept of freedom is not only related to public or civil matters, but also is deeply rooted in our spirituality as Catholics. The freedom that we speak of is not and cannot be given by any individual or group, nor is it a freedom given so we could simply “do whatever we want when we want”… it is so much deeper and more beautiful than that. True freedom isa gift promised and given by God himself which most fundamentally allows us to choose to move toward that which is good and to reject that which is evil. It is meant to be used in loving service of one another (see Galatians 5:13) and is a sign of the presence of the Lord in our midst, for “… the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom.” (2 Corinthians 3:17)\n\nIt’s a good practice for us people of faith to take a little bit of time each day to first thank God for the gift of our human freedom and also, to ask him for the grace to look into our lives honestly and see where we are still chained down. Is there an anxiety that keeps your heart restless? Maybe a fear? Perhaps there is something in our past that tries to force us to live in guilt or feel sorry for ourselves? Today is as good a day as any to rejoice in the love and mercy of the Lord and to let him and his mother Mary untie those knots that remain in our mind and heart. To break free of those old, rusty, heavy chains. To begin refreshed and renewed. As a parish we hold each other in prayer and support… one of the great benefits of being part of a faith community! I pray that the Lord will bestow upon all of us a sense of his freedom, peace, and grace that is offered today and every day.\n\nWith Prayer,\n\nFr. Christian\n\nFROM THE DESK OF FR. CHRISTIAN SCALO – June 25, 2023\n\nSummer is here! It’s official! Hopefully this will be a time of increased relaxation for all, perhaps a time for vacation or simply spending some more time with friends and family. As I reflect on these past months, I am filled with gratitude for the people of St. Joseph Parish… gratitude for you! We truly have a wonderful parish with people who are committed to growing in their faith and helping to spread our faith to others. We have countless volunteers who selflessly donate their time, sometimes hours, week after week to lead and participate in ministries and other outreach efforts. We have generous supporters who, through prayer or financial means, help to keep our parish strong. Simply put… we are a parish that gets involved and has people who care!!! Only a brief look at our “community” page on our website shows just how active we are as a parish family. The care, dedication, and attention to detail that our ministers and volunteers give to their diverse ministries and to the success of our parish is second to none and for that I sincerely thank you.\n\nAs we begin to move into the summer months, I would like to invite and encourage anyone who has not joined a ministry or "
