        "text": "Theological Reflection\n\nPope Francis says Hope in the Resurrection is more than wishful thinking. \"The Lord will always be with us.\" https://www.ewtnnews.com/catholic-news/Vatican?id=14967\n\nPope Francis I is now the spiritual leader of the Catholic Church. I invite all to reflect on his homily at his installation Mass as the successor of St. Peter. Pope Francis invited us \"to serve the poorest, the weakest, the least important.\". He urged world leaders to protect human life and the environment and use tenderness to inspire hope. \"We need to see the light of hope and to be men and women who bring hope to others.\" \"I would like to ask all those who have positions of responsibility in economic, political, and social lfe, and all men and women of good will: let us be protectors of creation, protectors of God's plan inscribed in nature, protectors of one another, and of the environment.\" Francis is the first Jesuit pope; He quoted Scripture to say as bishop of Rome, he was endowed with \"a certain power.\" \"Let us never forget that authentic power is service. All must be inspired by the lowly, concrete, and faithful service which marked St. Joseph. The successor of St. Peter must open his arms to protect all of God's people and embrace with tender affection the whole of humanity, especially the poorest, the weakest, the least important, those whom St. Matthew lists in the final judgment on love: the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick and those in prison.\" (Mt. 25. 31-46)\n\nAs citizens of the United States, I think we have positions of responsibility in economic, political,and social life. I think it's valuable for all of us as individuals, communities, a nation, a world to form a vision of a world more in accord with God's Word. I think Jesus wants us to develop and live a common ethic, promote an atmosphere of non-violence, a culture of basic human rights, widespread and democratic ownership of capital, and a world democratic federation. Each of these structures, of course, would have sub-structures. I see our task with God's help to craft the details of the vision and then work to implement our vision. As Peter Maurin, the companion of Dorothy Day, said, \"We must create a world in which it is easier to be good.\"\n\nWe also need a way to proceed non-violently toward our vision. I suggest getting in touch with our own experience, enlarging our experience by some kind of contact with the materially poor and the marginalized, organizing our experience through research and social analysis, engaging in theological reflection, practicing spiritual communal and apostolic discernment, making a decision beyond social service for social action according to a definite time-line, evaluating what is happening, and then beginning the cycle again.\n\nThus the third step in a process toward a peace with justice is theological reflection. This does not mean searching Scripture for proof texts to support a decision we've already made. Theological reflection means continually going to the riches of Scripture and the values of the churches and allowing God's values to interact with the real world in which we find ourselves.We need to reflect with the Bible in one hand and a newspaper in the other.\n\nOur faith gives us a respite from the troubles of our world, a place of refreshment, light, and peace. But if religion is only an escape, or a private matter--if religion does not play an essential role in our everyday lives, what is the purpose of God's special intervention through Revelation, the Incarnation, and Redemption? A private religion is irrelevant, trivial, and a contradiction in terms. The reign of God is by its nature social.\n\nSome have argued that the role of the religious right proves that religion and politics should be kept absolutely separate. However, church people are citizens; churches are legitimate voluntary organizations. Churches indeed have the benefit of humanizing and moderating values and can often build bridges instead of walls. But religious organizations should be subjected to the same standards of loving, rational and consistent presentation of their views as any other participant in the public debate. We need to do our homework, which includes having our religious values interface with the situation we have analyzed. And of course, we need sound theology.\n\nProtestants say the the Bible is God's Word and infallible. Catholics agree and add that the Magisterium is under certain conditions infallible. But Christian churches are pilgrim churches, Christians are finite creatures. Only God has absolute infallibility. We cannot indulge in dogmatic imperialism, arrogantly thinking we have all the answers, that everything is nailed down, that we and only we have a direct line to God.\n\n\"In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be. What came to be through him was life, and this life was the light of the human race. And the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us, and we saw his glory as of the Father's only Son, full of grace and truth.\" John 1.1-4, 14)\n\nJesus is God's revelation to us par excellence. Jesus comes to us today through finite human words, through prayer, the values of the churches, through our experiences, through nature, in countless ways. Jesus says he is meek and humble of heart. We need to listen together and discern together God's message to us. I suggest for your reflection Richard R. Gaillardetz By What Authority? A Primer on Scripture, the Magisterium, and the Sense of the Faithful. For those more advanced Richard R. Gaillardetz Teaching with Authority, A Theology of the Magisterium in the Church.\n\nIn America 9/27/10 p. 23 Fr. Drew Christiansen's \"Conspiracy of Bishops and Faithful\" is a timely comment on Cardinal Newman's \"On Consulting the Faithful.\" Members of the Church freely remain or leave. The number who have left is large. All who have stayed deserve to be treated as children of God, created in God's image and likeness. Teaching rather than commanding, listening to all rather than following unacknowledged prejudices, following the principle of subsidiarity rather than deciding everything in Rome, will make a stronger and better people of God. Communal prayerful discernment will make a spiritually healthy church.\n\nI would translate Pastorum et fidelium conspiratio, a breathing together of all the baptized. Many claim that we don't breath physically as deeply and as naturally as we ought. It doesn't seem to me that we are breathing together spiritually as deeply and supernaturally as we ought. America has a Readers Comments structure so that readers can respond in a civil and thoughtful way.\n\nWhat structures are in place by which experienced and thoughtful laity or priests can breathe together with the bishops and Pope? We need a shared breathing rhythm, a rhythm in harmony with the breathing of the Holy Spirit. In his introduction to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II said that the Catechism was created through the collaboration of \"numerous theologians, exegetes and catechists, and, above all, of the Bishops of the whole world, in order to produce a better text. Various opinions were compared with great profit, and thus a richer text has resulted whose unity and coherence are assured. . . the result causes John Paul II \"deep joy, because the harmony of so many voices truly expresses what could be called the 'symphony' of the faith . .the Church's catholicity.\"\n\nPope John Paul II says the Catechism \"should faithfully and systematically present the teaching of Sacred Scripture, the living Tradition in the Church and the authentic Magisterium, as well as the spiritual heritage of the Fathers, Doctors, and saints of the Church to allow for a better knowledge of the Christian mystery and for enlivening the faith of the People of God. It should take into account the doctrinal statements which down the centuries the Holy Spirit has intimated to the Church. It should help illumine with the light of faith the new situations and problems which have not yet emerged in the past. The catechism thus contains the new and the old (cf. Mt. 13.52) because the faith is always the same yet the source of ever new light. The contents are often presented in a 'new' way in order to respond to the questions of our age.\"\n\nI engage thus in theological reflection on Scripture, the teaching of the churches, human and church history, and current events. Europe developed a political theology because of the traumatic experience of the holocaust. Latin America developed liberation theology because of the traumatic experience of massive poverty. Should the United States develop a theology of honesty arising from the massive self-deception about our moral superiority? I suggest that the US establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission that examines our history and our present domestic and foreign policy in the light of theological values. What has been the role of the U.S. for example in the establishment of the present make-up of the nation state of Israel or its continued actions? What should our role be in the future? A new philosophy or modus operandi in general in the world and in Israel/Palestine is described in No More Enemies, It's not the People. . .It's the Paradigm by Deb Reich, a Jewish Israeli citizen.\n\nhttps://www.usccb.org/news/2017/17-121.cfm Bishops of U.S. and Europe are against nuclear weapons.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nI think philosophy can be a complement and foundation for theology. I became a philosopher, a lover of wisdom in 1950. I enjoyed thinking deep thoughts, going down to the root of things. Here I developed principles. I saw how people, events, and the world were connected. As I learned to think and distinguish, I began to engage in rational discourse.\n\nMy background was Thomistic. Actually I enjoyed the simplicity and profundity of St. Thomas Aquinas. His philosophy was clear, logical, uplifting. Thomas' concept of God gave me a sense of awe at the majesty of God. Thomas's concept of the world was orderly, logical, and connected.\n\nDuring philosophy I got a sense of natural law. In God's mind is eternal law, a principle or rule of activity. When God created, natural (born) law began. There are physical laws like the law of gravity, the laws studied by physics, chemistry, and biology. There are also natural moral laws, the relationships we have to God, our neighbor, the earth. We are free, intelligent, loving, and social human persons. We can love and be loved; understand and be understood. We can communicate with one another. If we lie, that breaks down communication. We never know when an habitual liar is telling the truth. Thus lying is contrary to the natural law. Natural law is distinct from positive or civil law. Civil law is made by legitimate authority for the common good. Civil law is promulgated by public decree. Natural law is promulgated by God's act of creation. Not all natural law needs to be enacted into civil law. Education and persuasion should precede enactment into civil law. A civil law not accepted by most of the people is difficult to enforce.\n\nThrough our reason, we can conclude that each human person has basic human rights. Without the exercise of our basic human rights we cannot grow in our relationships with God, our neighbor, the earth. Positive peace is the enjoyment of basic rights by each human person which allows us to become closer to God, one another, and physical creation.\n\nAnother part of my philosophical study has been courses in existentialism. Existentialist philosophers gave me a whole new insight on how to approach reality. Although I didn't give up reason, I did learn to value emotion, intuition, and experience.\n\nI now have a master's degree in philosophy and a doctorate in philosophy with a concentration in peace studies.\n\nTheology\n\nIn 1956 I began four years of study of theology. My spirituality and faith was strong. Theology gave depth and scholarship to my faith. In the midst of my theology, John XXIII called the Second Vatican Council. I was fortunate to have progressive teachers like Fr. John L. McKenzie, S. J., Fr. LeSaint, S.J., Fr. Fortman, S.J., Fr. DeVault, S.J., and Fr. James Doyle, S. J. who helped me make the transition from pre-Vatican II to post-Vatican II days.\n\nSince Scripture needs to be read in the context of the time and setting of its composition as does all of literature, Scripture should be interpreted according to its literary form. This made sense, but many resisted change because Scripture meant so much to them. St. Augustine said that he who is ignorant of Scripture is ignorant of Christ.\n\nThe Bible, the Book, is a misnomer. Since Scripture contains history, short-stories, poetry, essays, proverbs, and sermons, the Bible is not a book but a library.\n\nBut the Bible is more than an ordinary library; it is the Word of God. Though important, mere academic study is not enough. We truly hear God's word only in a free, personal act of faith. But unless we know the work of scholars, the Bible can become for us a mere subjective projection of what we want the Bible to mean. The Devil tried to quote Scripture to his own advantage even to Christ. Those justifying apartheid often based their rationalizations on Scripture! Some denying the basic right of Palestinians to self-determination base their self-deception on Scripture! Those who believe in Armageddon base their perverted theory on Scripture!\n\nThe best interpreter of Scripture is Scripture itself. We can't take one verse of scripture out of the total context of the bible or of Christian practice. \"The poor you have always with you\" is interpreted in ways which are contrary to the total context of Christian teaching. Jesus loved the poor and identified with the poor. He certainly doesn't want them to remain poor today in such a rich and abundant technological abundance. (See fuller explanation of this verse below.)\n\nWhen I studied scripture in theology, I found more unction and life than the abstractions of philosophy. In scripture we see that God intervened and gave a totally new dimension to history. History is meaningful and tending toward a goal. St. Augustine said, \"We are a paschal people and our song is alleluia!\"\n\nDogma is exact and precise. Philosophy prepares for doctrine. We have a need to try to spell out in human terms the content and implications of the divine message which is the role of the different pronouncements of the Magisterium, the popes, the Ecumenical Councils, and the ordinary teaching of bishops and of the whole Church. Only the infallibility of God is absolute. We are a finite, pilgrim church. We can always express doctrine in a clearer, more dynamic way.\n\nThe first mystery in the hierarchy of Christian truths is the Triune God. (Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 90) There are three persons in one God. Three persons have the same identical nature. In my theological studies I especially enjoyed the treatise on the Trinity and saw the connection between what I had studied in philosophy and what I learned in theology. Some of the reasons for the arduous study of philosophy became clearer in theology. St. Thomas' explanations of the Trinity were based in his philosophy. The Trinity was intellectually stimulating and personally satisfying. I find it stimulating that God is revealed as an active and fruitful community.\n\nThe Trinity is the central mystery of the Christian faith. A mystery is ineffable, unable to be expressed adequately in words. We fumble and stumble and mumble when we talk about God. Yet, it is important that we try because it is better to know a little about God than a lot about anything else.\n\nAll of us in our hearts yearn for unity and harmony with one another. We want the common good, the good of all. Yet we also want our own individual freedom. We want to retain our own individual identity. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have perfect unity--the same identical nature. Yet, each is a distinct individual person. The Trinity is a model of common harmony and individual freedom.\n\nIn our own lives there is always a tension between the common good and individual rights and personal dignity. I think the solution does not lie in denying either part of the tension but in balancing both the common good and the individual in a responsible way. Certainly if selfishness and greed mask themselves as individual freedom, I don't think I'm acting responsibly. If the individual is absorbed in the collectivity, I don't think that's responsible either. If one observes this issue in the larger world picture, one might conclude that in the U.S. we come down to a great extent on the side of individualism. But whatever one's analysis, there needs to be a balance between individual freedom and the common good.\n\nSometimes I forget my problems and lose myself in praise and love and awe of the Holy Trinity. I rejoice in the beauty and power, happiness and security of the three divine persons. I give glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Through Sanctifying Grace, within me at the core of my being the Father generates the Son; the Father-Mother and the Son spirate the Holy Spirit. I regularly make acts of love to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nJesus was fully man and fully God; one person with two natures. Mary is the Mother of God because she is the mother of Jesus who is one person. Jesus is the high priest, uniting humankind to God.\n\n\"The Triune God desires this universe into existence in order to invite us into the intimate life of the Trinity. The early Christian theologians who spoke Greek coined a wonderful phrase to describe the inner life of the Trinity: perichoeresis, peri-meaning 'around' and choeresis meaning 'dancing, hence, 'dancing around.' So we need to think of music and dance and words together as a symbol of the inner life of God. With creation, and especially with the incarnation of the Word of God, this dance becomes the ground of our universe. The dance of the Trinity in some mysterious way pervades the universe. At every moment of existence we are surrounded by this perfect dance. At every moment of existence we are being drawn by the music of this eternal dance to become conscious participants in it. The Triune God wants us to be partners in the dance, to be so intimate that we share the inner life of the Trinity. (See Foreword by Fr. William A Barry, S.J. to God in the Moment, Making Every Day a Prayer by Kathy Coffey)\n\nOthers feel that perichoeresis means \"moving in and out, penetrating the other persons\" To me the two meanings can fit together.\n\nI believe the relationship between humankind and God is real. Sin breaks that relationship. Jesus redeemed us from original sin, the only Catholic dogma which I feel needs no proof. I live with original sin each day. Original sin is our group estrangement from God. For example, prolonged unemployment leads to discouraged workers who remove themselves from the workforce. If workers cannot find a living wage for many years, they drop out and are not counted in the statistics as unemployed. (Daedalus, Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Winter 2002, Orlando Patterson, \"Beyond Compassion, Selfish Reasons for being Unselfish\" p. 33) \"Chronic poverty and unemployment in the midst of plenty is directly related to chronic drug use, criminality, the desolation of communities both urban and, increasingly, rural, and growing violence in all aspects of life. A semiliterate and alienated lower class wastes much of America's potential manpower. . .What is true of the weather is equally true of the moral climate we share: the rich winners and their children, can no more escape cultural pollution than they can escape air pollution\n\nThe Redemptive act of Jesus, His life, death and resurrection, frees us to grow. The Redemptive act also did something for Jesus. His life, death and resurrection was the gateway for Jesus from life in the flesh to life to God.\n\nGod does not want us to suffer. Suffering is rooted in finitude and freedom. God wants us to use our freedom to reduce and eliminate suffering. God did not require the death of Jesus as compensation for what we make of our history. God is not a God of ransom and atonement, but a God of compassion and non-violence, the God of Jesus.\n\nJesus balances off the mystery of evil with a totally generous and loving life. Christ's life, death, and resurrection shows that life is stronger than death, and that goodness is stronger than evil. Christ changed the thrust of our self-centeredness and put His Heart at the center of things. Through redeeming us, Christ has put joy and hope at the center of things. Let's us join Jesus in putting joy and hope at the center of our world.\n\nThe sacraments mean more when one studies their history and theology. At the various stages of our lives the sacraments make present the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, His redemptive act. From my army days on, the Eucharist has been part and parcel of my everyday life. I feel I have been called to be a co-redeemer with Jesus.\n\nLife in physical creation is beautiful, complex, and wondrous. The many kinds of grace or supernatural life are a unique treasure. I also affirm the dignity of free choice. I am glad I have freely joined the Society of Jesus, in which I can follow Jesus more closely, know Him more intimately, and love him more ardently.\n\nTrinity-Family\n\nThe central Christian mystery is belief in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The concept of the individual person is realized most perfectly and most mysteriously in the Trinity. \"Each of the persons is not 'in itself', nor does it belong to itself, except inasmuch as it simultaneously is related to and gives itself completely to the other two. The being of each of the three Persons is a pure and complete extasis, a going out, a self-giving, a vital impulse toward the other two\n\nThe concept of person finds its most perfect and mysterious realization in the Trinity. We find a luminous synthesis of the nature, rights and duties of the person in Pope John XXIII\"s Pacem in Terris, Peace on Earth\" (\"Trinitarian Inspiration of the Ignatian Charism\" Fr. Pedro Arrupe, S.J., No. 83-87)\n\n\"The family is the foundation of society.\" (Vatican II, Gaudium et Spes, No. 52) Made in the image and likeness of the Trinity, the family is a community of love and support. Secular culture often attempts to separate sexual expressions of love from marriage. On this web page I have sketched a vision of peace: world democratic authority, democratic local community, economic and social stability. This vision can only succeed with healthy sub-structures, the first being the family. Of course, the closer we come to a Vision of Hope, the easier it will be for sub-structures like the family to function well.\n\nIt may help devotion to the Holy Spirit to reflect on the fruit of the Spirit. . .love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness. faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, all of which help us in our relationships. (Galatians 5.22-23)\n\nTo counteract the widespread sexual and other abuse in our culture, I suggest a positive vision of what healthy relationships should be among those married, those single, religious, and celibate priests.\n\nAt the end of four years of theology, I reviewed the latter plus my three years of philosophy. I had a comprehensive examination of all seven years. I saw that Thomistic philosophy and theology was consistent, logical, and sound. In 1960 I received the equivalent of another master's degree in theology, a licentiate to teach theology in a Pontifical Seminary.\n\nTheology is a Greek word meaning the study of God. Faith is our relationship to God. It's very appropriate, therefore, to reflect further on God.\n\nWhat is God Like?\n\nGod is our past, our origin, our creator. God is our present, our sustainer, the infinite and inexhaustible depth and ground of our being. God is our future, our pioneer, our trail-blazer, our goal, our destiny, our savior, the magnetic focus that draws all things to himself/herself.\n\nTo the inspired Hebrew prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel God is wholly other.\n\nGod was wholly other from the visible universe of which we are a part; no cosmic force, nor all of them together, can be identified with Yahweh. God stands above and beyond all things that are not God. Yahweh is not circumscribed by anything in nature or outside it. Yahweh is supremely free and independent. God is wholly other in the unmixed goodness which is God's own. (See Fr. John L. McKenzie, S.J., Two-edged Sword.)\n\nThe Trinity\n\nThe mystery of three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; one God; is the central focus of Christian Faith. The Father generates the Son; Father and Son together spirate the Holy Spirit. The Father's personhood consists in his giving of himself completely to the Son and with the Son spirating the Holy Spirit. The Son's personhood consists in receiving being from the Father and spirating the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's personhood consists in receiving being from the Father and the Son. What the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit share is the same identical divine nature. The difference of their unique personhoods consists in their relationships. Fr. Pedro Arrupe, S.J. \"Trinitarian Inspiration of the Ignatian Charism\"(86): \"Each of the persons is not 'in itself', nor does it belong to itself, except inasmuch as it simultaneously is related to and gives itself completely to the other two. The being of each of the three Persons is a pure and complete extasis, a going out, a self-giving, a vital impulse toward the other two.\n\nFrom that incomparable model the human person must take inspiration for his perfection and, analogically, for his fulfillment and consummation. . . a human personality should not close in on itself but perfect itself in its relationships and otherness. . .in the Divine Persons is found the ultimate model of women and men for others.\n\nIf we consider in a Trinitarian light all of man's selfishness: his exploitation, his violations of human rights, his injustice is the complete antithesis of self-giving. . are these not clearly the sin of atheism, inasmuch as they deny what God is in us and what we are for God?. . .Promoting justice means restoring in ourselves the model of the Trinitarian relationships. Freeing the oppressed means finding the sense of equality in which our condition as persons formed in the divine image places us. There is no true person without true donation. Whatever is opposed to donation--selfishness, exploitation, oppression--depersonalizes us in the Trinitarian sense of the word.\n\n\"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through me. . .Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?. . .The word you hear is not mine: it comes from the Father who sent me. This much have I told you while I was still with you: the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name, will instruct you in everything, and remind you of all that I told you. . .When the Paraclete comes, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father--and whom I myself will send from the Father, he will beat witness on my behalf. (John 14, 15)\n\n\"Go and make disciples of all the nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\" (Matthew 28.19) \"In Christ you too were chosen; when you heard the glad tidings of salvation, the word of truth, and believed in it, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit who had been promised. He is the pledge of our inheritance, the first payment against the full redemption of a people God has made his own, to praise His glory.\" (Ephesians 1.13, 14)\n\n\"Now in Christ Jesus you Gentiles who once were far off have been brought near through the blood of Christ. It is he who is our peace, and who makes the two of us one by breaking down the barrier of hostility that kept us apart. In his own flesh he abolished the law with its commands and precepts, to create in himself one new man from us who had been two and to make peace, reconciling both of us to God in one body through his cross, which put that enmity to death. He came and announced the good news of peace to you who were far off, and to those who were near; through Christ we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.\" (Ephesians 2.13-18)\n\nLove in Truth Pope Benedict XVI\n\n\"2. \"Charity is at the heart of the Church's social doctrine. Every responsibility and every commitment spelled out by that doctrine is derived from charity which, according to the teaching of Jesus, is the synthesis of the entire Law (cf. Mt 22:36- 40). It gives real substance to the personal relationship with God and with neighbor; it is the principle not only of micro-relationships (with friends, with family members or within small groups) but also of macro-relationships (social, economic and political ones). For the Church, instructed by the Gospel, charity is everything because, as Saint John teaches (cf. 1 Jn 4:8, 16) and as I recalled in my first Encyclical Letter, God is Love (Deus Caritas Est): everything has its origin in God's love, everything is shaped by it, everything is directed towards it. Love is God's greatest gift to humanity, it is his promise and our hope.\n\nI am aware of the ways in which charity has been and continues to be misconstrued and emptied of meaning, with the consequent risk of being misinterpreted, detached from ethical living and, in any event, undervalued. In the social, juridical, cultural, political and economic fields the contexts, in other words, that are most exposed to this danger it is easily dismissed as irrelevant for interpreting and giving direction to moral responsibility. Hence the need to link charity with truth not only in the sequence, pointed out by Saint Paul, of veritas in caritate (Eph 4:15), but also in the inverse and complementary sequence of caritas in veritate. Truth needs to be sought, found and expressed within the economy of charity, but charity in its turn needs to be understood, confirmed and practiced in the light of truth. In this way, not only do we do a service to charity enlightened by truth, but we also help give credibility to truth, demonstrating its persuasive and authenticating power in the practical setting of social living. This is a matter of no small account today, in a social and cultural context which relativizes truth, often paying little heed to it and showing increasing reluctance to acknowledge its existence.\n\n3. Through this close link with truth, charity can be recognized as an authentic expression of humanity and as an element of fundamental importance in human relations, including those of a public nature. Only in truth does charity shine forth, only in truth can charity be authentically lived. Truth is the light that gives meaning and value to charity. That light is both the light of reason and the light of faith, through which the intellect attains to the natural and supernatural truth of charity: it grasps its meaning as gift, acceptance, and communion. Without truth, charity degenerates into sentimentality. Love becomes an empty shell, to be filled in an arbitrary way. In a culture without truth, this is the fatal risk facing love. It falls prey to contingent subjective emotions and opinions, the word \"love\" is abused and distorted, to the point where it comes to mean the opposite. Truth frees charity from the constraints of an emotionalism that deprives it of relational and social content, and of a fideism that deprives it of human and universal breathing-space. In the truth, charity reflects the personal yet public dimension of faith in the God of the Bible, who is both Agápe and Lógos: Charity and Truth, Love and Word.\n\n13. In addition to its important link with the entirety of the Church's social doctrine, Populorum Progressio is closely connected to the overall magisterium of Paul VI, especially his social magisterium. His was certainly a social teaching of great importance: he underlined the indispensable importance of the Gospel for building a society according to freedom and justice, in the ideal and historical perspective of a civilization animated by love. Paul VI clearly understood that the social question had become worldwide [25] and he grasped the interconnection between the impetus towards the unification of humanity and the Christian ideal of a single family of peoples in solidarity and fraternity. In the notion of development, understood in human and Christian terms, he identified the heart of the Christian social message, and he proposed Christian charity as the principal force at the service of development. Motivated by the wish to make Christ's love fully visible to contemporary men and women, Paul VI addressed important ethical questions robustly, without yielding to the cultural weaknesses of his time.\n\n14. In his Apostolic Letter Octogesima Adveniens of 1971, Paul VI reflected on the meaning of politics, and the danger constituted by utopian and ideological visions that place its ethical and human dimensions in jeopardy. These are matters closely connected with development. Unfortunately the negative ideologies continue to flourish. Paul VI had already warned against the technocratic ideology so prevalent today[26], fully aware of the great danger of entrusting the entire process of development to technology alone, because in that way it would lack direction.\n\nFinding God in All Things\n\nTo process theologians, God is related to every being at one and the same time. We can save a place for God at our table because God can be at each table wholly and completely. God is reliable. But God has persuasive not coercive power. God encourages, persuades, and nudges us to do what we ought.\n\nWe can approach God through nature. Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, S.J.: \"Blessed be you, universal matter, immeasurable time, boundless ether, triple abyss of stars and atoms and generations: you who by overflowing and dissolving our narrow standards of measurement, reveal to us the dimensions of God . . . I acclaim you as the divine milieu.\" Hymn of the Universe.\n\nWe can approach God through love and friendship. \"Our salvation is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way--an honorable way--in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment.\" Victor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning.\n\n\"It is the love of my lover, my brother, or my child that sees God in me, makes God credible to myself in me. And it is my love for my lover, my child, my brother, that enables me to show God to him or her in himself or herself. Love is the epiphany of God in our poverty.\" The Message of Thomas Merton.\n\n\"I seek peace, let me BE peace. I seek justice, let me be just. I seek a world of kindness, let me be kind. I seek a world of generosity, let me be generous with all that I have. I seek a world of sharing, let me share all that I have. I seek a world of giving, let me be giving to all around me. I seek a world of love, let me be loving beyond all reason, beyond all normal expectation, beyond all societal frameworks that tell me how much love is \"normal,\" beyond all fear that giving too much love will leave me with too little. And let me be open and sensitive to all the love that is already coming to me, the love of people I know, the love that is part of the human condition, the accumulated love of past generations that flows through and is embodied in the language, music, recipes, technology, literature, religions, agriculture, and family heritages that have been passed on to me and to us. Let me pass that love on to the next generations in an even fuller and more explicit way.\n\nSource of goodness and love in the universe, let me be alive to all the goodness that surrounds me. And let that awareness of the goodness and love of the universe be my shield and protector. Hear the words of my mouth and may the meditations of my heart find acceptance before You, Eternal Friend, who protects and frees me. Amen. The Tikkun Community.\n\nLaughter is one way we can find God. We don't need a reason to laugh. Those who have participated in yoga laughter workshops know that laughing is natural. But sometimes humor can get us started. On the tombstone of the hypochondriac: I TOLD YOU I WAS SICK!\n\nPraise the Lord for this wonderful experience of the pious but naïve wife of Rev. Smith\n\nThe other day I went to the local religious book store where I saw a Honk if you love Jesus bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car, and I'm really glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed!\n\nI was stopped at the light of a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must really love the Lord, because pretty soon he leaned out his window and yelled \"Jesus\" as loud as he could. It was like a football game, with him shouting, Go Jesus, Go!! Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and I saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I had recently asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that was the Hawaiian Good Luck sign. So I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.\n\nA couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed, and I stepped on the gas. It's a good thing I did, because I was the only car to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned out the window, gave them a big smile, and held up the Hawaiian Good Luck sign as I drove away.\n\nPraise the Lord for such wonderful folks!!\n\nWe can approach God through our weakness. In moments of weakness or situations of limitations, people acknowledge an awareness of something more which empowers them. This grace gives one the experience of being lifted up, reborn, saved. \"Suddenly I remembered coming home from a meeting in Brooklyn many years ago, sitting in an uncomfortable bus seat facing a few poor people. One of them, a downcast, ragged man, suddenly epitomized for me the desolation, the hopelessness of the destitute, and I began to weep. I had been struck by one of those \"beams of love\" of William Blake, wounded by it in a most particular way. It was my own condition that I was weeping about--my own hardness of heart, my own sinfulness. I recognized this as a moment of truth, an experience of what the New Catechism calls our 'tremendous, universal, inevitable and yet inexcusable incapacity to love' I felt so strongly my nothingness, my powerlessness to do anything about this horrifying recognition of my own hardness of heart, it drove me to the recognition that in God alone was my strength. Without God I could do nothing. Yet I could do all things in Him Who strengthened me. So there was happiness there, too. The tears were of joy as well as grief.\" Dorothy Day By Little and By Little.\n\nWe can approach God through tragedy. \"A person sits at a dying friend's bedside and stares into the abyss of death--and discovers there a loving Power, a holy Presence, which evokes trust and hope. A family grapples with the pain of bereavement--and they sense consolation even in the darkness. Tragedy occurs in so many ways: separation, oppression, mental illness, terrorism, starvation and floods, threats of nuclear war. These events are overwhelming and yet at times, grace-filled. In La Plata Prison Adolfo was forbidden all books, even a Bible. Faced with long days and nights of solitude he had time to appreciate what he calls \"God's silence\" the place where faith ripens. Here in prison, everything Adolfo had ever received in the way of Christian culture began to come back to him in an uninterrupted series of insights, at once familiar and fresh. A kind of spiritual nourishment took charge, and Adolfo found, for instance, that he could write out whole passages of the gospel by heart. The lethal experience of prison paradoxically became an experience of interior liberation-- a kind of spiritual striking root.\" Adolfo Perez Esquivel,Christ in a Poncho.\n\nWe can find God through our choices, even our bad choices. (See When Bad Things Happen to Good People Rabbi Harold S. Kushner. I'm not sure I agree with every point of Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, but he does make good observations about the mystery of evil and God's creating us with human freedom. We don't know all the answers, but we can go forward in peace, hope, and love.\n\nWe can approach God through religion. The Christian sacraments celebrate the major moments of the life cycle and allow these moments to speak of something more, to point to Mystery present in all areas of life. Despite the negative aspects of religion--members of the church at all levels are sinners--many find in religion a privileged place for the encounter with God.\n\n\"By belonging to a community, by feeling part of its history and ideals, people come to an awareness of something more. We believe in history. The world is not a roll of the dice on its way toward chaos. A new world has begun to happen since Christ has risen... Jesus Christ, we rejoice in your definitive triumph. We march behind you on the road to the future. You are with us. You are our immortality.\" Rev. Luis Espinal, S.J., assassinated for his human rights work in Bolivia. I recommend small faith groups like Christian Life Community.\n\nWe can approach God through working for peace and justice. We recognize the fundamental human dignity of all persons--and the need for action to heal the afflicted and to change unjust structures of society. Those working for peace and justice sense God calling them and energizing their efforts. Christian Life Community is dedicated to the mission of Jesus, the mission of justice.\n\n\"I have learned more about the Gospels from handicapped people, those on the margins of our society, those who have been crushed and hurt, than I have from the wise and the prudent. Through their own growth and acceptance and surrender, wounded people have taught me that I must learn to accept my weakness and not pretend to be strong and capable. Handicapped people have shown me how handicapped I am, how handicapped we all are. They have reminded me that we are all weak and all called to death and that these are the realities of which we are most afraid. They have shown me how much I need Jesus the Healer. It is only when we accept these things that we can learn to open ourselves to the 'Spirit of love which Jesus promised us. Jesus came to give life and give it abundantly. He calls us from death to life, for He, the Lamb of God, took death on Himself and conquered it. He came to preach good news to the poor, liberty to the oppressed and freedom to captives (Luke 4.18) Some of us are captives of our own misery and loneliness, others of false values and possessions; all of us are captives of our fear. Jesus came to free us all by the gifts of His Spirit and calls us to a new life of the Beatitudes and of community.\" Jean Vanier, Be Not Afraid.\n\nWe can approach God through suffering. Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, When Bad Things Happen to Good People. p. 147 \"The question of why bad things happen to good people translates itself into asking . . .how we will respond, what we intend to do now that it has happened.\" God can't give us human freedom and then stop a bad choice from happening. We can only pause in the face of the mystery of evil and then go forward in hope with God's help.\n\nWe can approach God through conscience. Only God can justify our feeling that a particular ethical claim is absolute and unconditional. Jesus calls us to love of all, even our enemies. I also feel Jesus calls us to begin to form the structures described on this web-page.\n\nWe can approach God through reason. God is the first cause, the uncaused cause. In a contingent world, God is the necessary being.\n\nWe can approach God through Faith. Our Faith is stronger than our doubts. Faith makes sense. The alternative does not.\n\nThe \"cloud of witnesses\" throughout history strengthens our own faith.\n\nSometimes God finds us. We take a few tentative steps toward God, and God runs a hundred yards toward us!\n\nMary, the Mother of Jesus, the Mother of God\n\nMary said yes at the Annunciation, not knowing exactly what that would entail, yes at the birth of Jesus. Mary was there at Cana, on Calvary, at Pentecost. Mary trusted. in a sense Mary died when her Son died.\n\nThe Assumption of Mary: I think Mary will be with all of us when we die and helps us to be present with those we love in their last illness and death. In his letter to the Corinthians 15.26 St. Paul says: \"The last enemy to be destroyed is death.\" Mary encourages more improvements in medical science, in psychological and spiritual help; promoting things like hospice, helping one another to die at home.\n\nAt the Assumption we celebrate Mary's participation in her Son's Resurrection. Mary has gone before us and gives us hope. Mary is risen, body and soul. Mary is alive and well, and we are glad.\n\nLet us celebrate the ministry of women in the Church. Who has done more or is doing more for the Church than Mary? Are there ways for us to facilitate ministry of women in the Church?\n\nIn the Magnificat I see Mary challenging the idea of vast differences in wealth as a lack of solidarity, a lack of community, a lack of democracy. Mary wants all of us to share in her happiness. We live in a world of technological and intellectual abundance. (See Gar Alperovitiz, Unjust Deserts) There's really no need for there to be hunger or homelessness. No need for us to hoard or fight over resources. The Church moreover has an abundance of spiritual resources available for all.\n\nWhen Mary looks at our world today she sees war, violnce, hunger, oppression. There seems to be a huge dragon with seven heads and ten horns, his tail sweeping the stars from the sky, ready to devour us. While we are making it easier for all to die, let's also make it easier for all to live. Let us share the abundance of God's grace and the abundance of God's creation.\n\nJesus, Mary, and the Poor\n\nJesus' commandment to love our neighbor begins at home with the needs of those closest to us. But our love can't end there. Jesus came to bring good news to the poor, to proclaim liberty to captives, new sight to the blind, and to set the downtrodden free. To Jesus each human person is important.\n\nJesus calls us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, care for the sick and afflicted and to comfort the victims of injustice. We need to love the individual so much we are willing to re-examine any structure that may be oppressing her or him. If the structures we have today have been set up by fallible and sinful men, they can be changed by all of us discerning together. I think we need a revolution, a spiritual revolution, a peaceful revolution. But one that will do more than put a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. We need a radical change of the sinful social structures in our world today.\n\nMary made an option for the poor. As we approached the present millennium, Pope John Paul II reminded us that \"when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman.\" (Gal 4.4-6) The highest point in history, Jesus becoming man, followed Mary's initial act of faith at the Annunciation. Mary was blessed because she believed and continued to believe day after day despite the big trial of the journey to Egypt, despite the little trials of everyday life during the years at Nazareth, despite the reality that Mary and Joseph did not always understand what Jesus was saying to them. (Luke 2.48-50) Through faith Mary continued to ponder God's Word which became ever clearer in the self-revelation of the living God.\n\nAt Cana Mary began to point out our needs large and small. As a mother Mary wanted the messianic power of her Son to begin \"To preach good news to the poor.\" (Lk 4.18) Not even beneath the Cross did Mary's faith fail. Like Abraham Mary believed and hoped even against hope.\n\nDaughter of Mary, the Church journeys through time to meet Christ when He comes again. Mary, the Morning Star, has gone before us in her pilgrimage of faith, linking us to the rising of the Sun of Justice. \"The pilgrimage of faith indicates the interior history, that is, the story of souls.\" (Mother of the Redeemer, On the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Life of the Church, Introduction, 6, Pope John Paul II)\n\nThere are many ways in which we meet Mary today, the first is to believe. We can meet Mary in \"the land of Palestine, the spiritual homeland of all Christians because it was the homeland of the Savior of the world and of His Mother.\" (Ibid. II, 28) We can meet Mary today in the canticle of the Magnificat, which \"ceaselessly re-echoes in the heart of the Church down the centuries.\" \"God my Savior has scattered the proud-hearted, has cast down the mighty from their thrones, has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty.\" (Lk 1:46-55)\n\nPope John Paul II concludes: \"The truth about God who saves cannot be separated from God's love of preference for the poor and humble, that love which celebrated in the Magnificat, is later expressed in the words and works of Jesus. . .At the side of her Son Mary is the most perfect image of freedom and of the liberation of humankind and the universe.\" \"The Catholic Church is thus aware--and at the present time this awareness is particularly vivid--that there is a duty to safeguard carefully the importance of the option for the poor which is intimately connected with the Christian meaning of freedom and liberation. It is to Mary as Mother and Model that the Church must look to understand in its completeness the meaning of her own missionMother of the Redeemer, 78,79)\n\nWas Mary active at the beginning of the new millennium when the nations of the world pledged to eradicate extreme poverty? Was Mary active when we raised the minimum wage? Is Mary at our side when we strive for a fair price for the small farmer and a fair wage for the farm worker?\n\nCorporations are not governed by one member, one vote constituencies but by those who have the most money. Corporations have enormous staff and financial resources. Instead of encouraging stockholder participation, corporations often challenge stockholder resolutions; and the Security and Exchange Commission frequently rules in their favor. Consumers have limited choices, often inadequate information, and usually no way to communicate with other consumers on a large scale.\n\nIf there are huge disparities in income and wealth between those at the top and the rest of the population, the market produces more of the luxury goods and services wanted by those at the top and fewer of the goods and services needed by those in the middle. Although we live in an age of technological abundance, there is a limit to our economic and physical resources. If we use our resources mostly for luxuries for the wealthy, there will not be enough for necessities. My dream is that the world's resources be shared fairly by all.\n\nAre the few who own and control the factories, farms, and banks making the important decisions which affect all of us? Enormous wealth affects even political democracy. If the wealthy contribute to both political parties, they have easy access to legislators. Since only the wealthy can hire expensive lawyers, wealth also influences justice in the courts. The existence of enormous wealth alongside great poverty is a lack of community, solidarity, and democracy. St. Thomas More felt that as there is a bottom of bankruptcy for the wealthy, there should be a cap on the amount of wealth any individual or group has. To examine our mission, we must examine the mission of Mary and the Church.\n\n\"Thanks to science and technology, human society is able to solve problems such as feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, or developing more just conditions of life, but remains stubbornly unable to accomplish this. We can no longer pretend that the inequalities and injustices of our world must be borne as part of the inevitable order of things. we are simply not willing to pay the price of a more just and more humane society.' Injustice is rooted in a spiritual problem, and its solution requires a spiritual conversion of each one's heart and a cultural conversion of our global society so that humankind, with all the powerful means at its disposal, might exercise the will to change the sinful structures afflicting our world.\"\n\nI asked Fr. Simon Hendry, S.J. to reconcile the above with what Jesus said to Judas, \"The poor you always have with you.\"\n\n\"'The poor you will always have with you' can be understood in the light of Deuteronomy 15.11. 'there will always be poor in the land. . .', encouraging generosity to the poor. Deuteronomy 15 is a discussion of the debt laws, the seventh-year release from debt, and the idea of sharing among the Hebrew people. Deuteronomy 15.11 refers back to Deut. 15.4-5, 'There will, however, be no one in need among you, because the Lord is sure to bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as a possession to occupy, if only you will obey the Lord your God by diligently observing this entire commandment that I command you today.'\n\nIn Deuteronomy, the covenant requires sharing and respect for all. Persons and membership in the community are more important than possessions. The implication here is that if you keep the covenant, there will be no poor, because everyone will have a share in the prosperity of the land. However, if you do not act in a manner consistent with the covenant, there will be poor. Then since there are poor in the land, open your hands to give generously to them. The laws about debt and the forgiveness of debt were an attempt to interpret the covenant in a society moving from a subsistence agriculture to a more commercial economy, aware that in many of the mechanisms of a commercial economy, the principles of the covenant were being violated.\n\nJesus' comment is an ironic reference to Deuteronomy, quoting part of Deuteronomy 15:11. In John's gospel, Judas is a thief (Jn 12:6), someone who takes for himself what belongs to the community. It's as if Jesus were saying: 'Come off it, Judas, the problem of poverty is not because this woman is anointing me with expensive perfumed oil. Poverty exists because people are not paying attention to God and what a relationship with God requires. She is doing that. You always have the poor with you because you do not keep the whole covenant relationship and you are taking community property for yourself. If you were more like her, there would be no poor.'\n\nViewed that way, Kolvenbach and GC32 are in agreement with Jesus.We have the poor with us because we have not been paying attention to what a relationship with God requires. If we are serious about being believing Christians, then the results of technological and economic developments are to be shared. An economy would function as the means for producing and distributing to all the goods and services that the community needs, instead of serving primarily as a mechanism for generating private wealth. We have crafted an economy that violates the principles of the covenant. Deuteronomy's critique and Jesus' are still applicable.\n\nUltimately, the reason we 'will always have the poor with us' is not some inevitable law of nature or economics or some divine plan or decree. It is because we are not living the covenant (new or old) and are not sharing what we have. It is because we don't really believe in God or Jesus or we don't act in a way that is consistent with that belief.\" Fr. Simon Henry, S.J.\n\nCould I add that we don't believe in the human person, created in the image and likeness of God. The Hebrews were asked not to make graven images of God because God is wholly other from creatures and cannot be represented by statues and paintings. (Ex. 20.4-6; Dt 5.8-10; Lv 26.1; Dt 4.15-23) The image of God is within us. We need to spend our whole lives creating that image in ourselves and helping others to do the same. We are one human family. There are not some created in God's image and others not.\n\nIsaiah 55.1: \"All you who are thirsty, come to the water! You who have no money, come receive grain and eat; Come, without paying and without cost, drink wine and milk!\"\n\nMatthew 5.3: \"Blest are the poor in spirit: the reign of God is theirs.\" Luke 6.20: \"Blest are you poor; the reign of God is yours. Blest are you who hunger; you shall be filled.\" Matthew 25.34: \"Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink.\" James 2.14 \"My sisters and brothers, what good is it to profess faith without practicing it? Such faith has no power to save one, has it? If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and no food for the day, and you say to them, 'Good-bye and good luck! Keep warm and well fed,' but do not meet their bodily needs, what good is that? So it is with the faith that does nothing in practice. It is thoroughly lifeless.\" I John 4.20: \"If anyone says, 'My love is fixed on God,' yet hates his brother, he is a liar. One who has no love for the brother he has seen cannot love the God he has not seen. The commandment we have from God is this: whoever loves God must also love his brother.\"\n\nAmerica, Sept. 17, 2007: \"For decades scholars have called attention to Origen's description of Jesus as autobasileia (literally 'himself the kingdom'). Recent magisterial statements have frequently appealed to this text. While reflecting on Matthew 18.23-35, Origen says that 'king' refers to the Son of God. He goes on to ask: Since Jesus is 'wisdom itself\" (autosophia), 'justice itself' autodikaiosyne), and 'truth itself', autoasphaleia), is he not also autobasileia 'the kingdom itself'\n\nSt. Gregory Nazianzen, On Love of the Poor, PG 35, 887-890: \"You have been made a son of God, coheir with Christ. Where did you get all this, and from whom? What benefactor has enabled you to look out upon the beauty of the sky, the sun in its course, the circle of the moon, the countless number of stars, with the harmony and order that are theirs, like the music of a harp? . . .Is it not God who asks you now in your turn to show yourself generous? Because we have received from God so many wonderful gifts, will we not be ashamed to refuse God this one thing only, our generosity? Though He is God and Lord He is not afraid to be known as our Father. Shall we repudiate those who are our kith and kin? St. Peter says: Resolve to imitate God's justice, and no one will be poor.\"\n\nActs 2.45 The early Christians shared all in common so that no one was needy.\n\nIf overcoming poverty seems too great a task, I recommend Dr. Helen Caldicott, The New Nuclear Danger, p. 185 ff \"Under the banner Business Are Us, the Pentagon hosts a paper on their web site proclaiming that they are America's largest company, the next being Exxon with a budget of 165 billion dollars. With 5.1 million, the Pentagon is the nations' largest employer. It maintains 600 fixed facilities nationwide, with more than 40,000 properties and 18 million acres of land. It stations employees in 130 countries out of a total 178 of the world. Its global presence is ubiquitous.\n\nAmerica is a nation that spends only six cents out of every dollar on educating its children and four cents on health care for every fifty cents it spends on the military-industrial complex. Overall, the Pentagon's 310 billion dollars per year dwarfs the 44.5 billion dollars for the education department and 20.3 billion dollars for the National Institutes of Health.\n\nGlobally the annual military expenditure stands at 780 billion dollars. The total amount required to provide global health care, eliminate starvation and malnutrition, provide clean water and shelter for all, remove land mines, eliminate nuclear weapons, stop deforestation, prevent global warming, ozone depletion and acid rain, retire the paralyzing debt of developing nations, prevent soil erosion, produce safe, clean energy, stop overpopulation, and eliminate illiteracy is only one third that amount--237.5 billion dollars.\n\nGive All To The Poor\n\n\"Jesus looking hard at him loved him, and said, 'One thing is lacking to you: whatever things you have, sell, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, and come follow me.' But the young man was appalled at the word, and went away grieving, for he had many possessions. . .\" (Mark 10.17-31) The young man goes away mourning because his possessions are great. Wealth paralyzes the young man. Wealth is a hindrance to hearing the gospel. (Matthew 13.22; Mark 4.18,19; Luke 8.14) Wealth deceives. Wealth distracts from a following of Jesus. Wealth becomes the primary object of attachment. \"You cannot serve God and mammon\" (Matthew 6.24; Luke 16.13) \"Be on guard against every kind of greed.\" Lk. 12.15) \"Money is a root of all evils.\" (I Timothy 6.10)(See Sondra Ely Wheeler, Wealth as Peril and Obligation, the New Testament on Possessions)\n\n\"Share with your neighbor whatever you have, and do not say of anything, this is mine. If you both share an imperishable treasure, how much more must you share what is perishable. . Never hesitate to give, and when you do give, never grumble; then you will know the one who will repay you.\" (Attributed to Barnabas, Liturgy of the Hours, Vol. IV, 71, 72)\n\nCo-creators with God\n\nIn the summers from 1965 to 1970 I got another Master's degree at the Loyola University of Chicago Pastoral Institute. Here began a new and exciting vision of progressive theology. I saw that what I did in this life had eternal significance for the world to come. It was this life, these relationships that would be transformed and transfigured. I began to see the next life as the full-flowering of the way we live in this life. I felt called to develop my talents, my personality here and now, to be true to my inner self. I feel I am a unique person with a unique mission. When God created me, he decided against billions of other possibilities. There's a true character inside me that should be operating. I feel it's never too late to begin anew. I can't erase the past nor the scars it has left on my character. The past has also enriched me. But it's my attitude toward the future that makes me what I am and what I can become.\n\n\"The divinisation of our endeavors by the value of our right intention infuses a precious soul into all our actions. . .if we love God our work will never be lost. But will not the work itself of our minds, of our hearts and of our hands--our achievements, our products, our work--will not these too be saved?\" The Divine Milieu, Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, S.J. p. 23 ff. \"I love irresistibly all that your continuous help enables me to bring each day to reality. A thought, a material improvement, a particular expression of love, a smile or a look, in me or around me, I cherish them like children. Our work, our activity, follows us as we enter God's reign. Each one of our works contributes to perfect Christ in His mystical totality. In action I cleave to the creative power of God; I co-incide with it; I become not only its instrument but its living prolongation. I merge myself, through my heart, with the very heart of God. God is there waiting for us at every moment in our action, in our work of the moment. God is at the tip of my pen, my spade, my brush, my needle--of my heart and of my thought. Nothing here is profane for those who know how to see. Whatever you do, realize its significance and constructive value in Christ, and pursuing it with all your might. What is sanctity if not to cleave to God with the maximum of our strength?\"\n\nWilliam McDonough and Michael Braungart, Cradle to Cradle, Remaking the Way We Make Things. Are we making things in a way that is sustainable, enhancing our lives, our planet, and all living things? Are we designing structures more in accord with God's Word? Are we growing food, manufacturing products in a healthy, sustainable way, with regard for safety for workers and farmers with adequate recompense for their work? Do we have meaningful employment for each human person? Do we pay workers a salary by which they can afford the products they are making? Are we being cruel to animals?\n\nHenry Ford's Model T was designed to make a product that was desirable, affordable, and operable by anyone, just about anywhere; that lasted a certain amount of time and that could be produced cheaply and quickly. A philosophy of cradle to grave developed. We really consume very little. We put our products \"away.\" But now \"away\" has gone away.\n\nTo design products and grow food from cradle to cradle requires cooperation rather than isolated competition. It requires an interdisciplinary vision of how we can go forward in a integrated and inter-connected way. Instead of brute force and universal design, we need to tailor our production to the locale. Nature is our partner, not our enemy.\n\nIn Spe Salvi, Saved by Hope No. 35 Pope Benedict XVI states: All serious and upright human conduct is hope in action It is important to know that I can always continue to hope, even if in my own life, or the historical period in which I am living, there seems to be nothing left to hope for\n\nCertainly we cannot build the Kingdom of God by our own efforts. What we build will always be the kingdom of man with all the limitations proper to our human nature. The Kingdom of God is a gift, and precisely because of this, it is great and beautiful, and constitutes the response to our hope. And we cannot to use the classical expression \"merit\" Heaven through our works. Heaven is always more than we could merit, just as being loved is never something \"merited\", but always a gift. However, even when we are fully aware that Heaven far exceeds what we can merit, it will always be true that our behavior is not indifferent before God and therefore is not indifferent for the unfolding of history. We can open ourselves and the world and allow God to enter: we can open ourselves to truth, to love, to what is good. This is what the saints did, those who, as God's fellow workers, contributed to the world's salvation (cf. 1 Cor 3:9; 1 Th 3:2). We can free our life and the world from the poisons and contaminations that could destroy the present and the future. We can uncover the sources of creation and keep them unsullied, and in this way we can make a right use of creation, which comes to us as a gift, according to its intrinsic requirements and ultimate purpose. This makes sense even if outwardly we achieve nothing or seem powerless in the face of overwhelming hostile forces. So on the one hand, our actions engender hope for us and for others; but at the same time, it is the great hope based upon God's promises that gives us courage and directs our action in good times and bad.\"\n\nSome are need-centered. They need certain sense and emotional gratifications. They look on others to fulfill their needs. Unfortunately, they often use others as tools to manipulate and maneuver, to impose upon and take advantage of. I'm not saying I have been free from this. Others are growth-oriented. They enjoy the greatest of all happiness, to love and be loved, to understand and be understood, to trust and be trusted.\n\nBut we will never be fully ourselves unless we reach out to God who transcends our own partialness. Some look on God as a Big Daddy up in the sky, an over-indulgent father who always gives them everything they want and who always yields to special pleading. I'm not saying I have abandoned the prayer of petition, but I feel much of our unhappiness is of our own making. I also believe God acts through us. I think God looks upon us as mature sons and daughters, partners in God's work of creation and redemption, real women and men who are willing to face life and its realities, willing to face themselves and their own deficiencies. I feel I am called to grow to be true to myself. What I am is God's gift to me. What I become is my gift to God.\n\nAt the Loyola Pastoral Institute I had further readings in existentialism and was introduced to process theology. I was fascinated by the lectures of Fr. Alfonso M. Nebreda, S.J., Director of the East Asian Pastoral Institute. Fr. Nebreda stressed pre-evangelization, not trying to preach the gospel to those who are not ready for it.\n\nI learned to distinguish clock time, what Aristotle called the measure of motion, according to before and after, and temporality, or my grasp of time, my assimilation of my own experiences. All of us have clock time in common. Each of us has a different temporality. There is also liturgical time, how God is present in the various liturgical seasons. We cannot live all of life at once. Our lives have to be an integration of past, present, and future.\n\nI also became aware of God's presence in signs, the witness of the saints, physical nature, the sacraments, the events of our lives.\n\nFr. Calle saw the following six fundamental tensions at the base of human existence:\n\nA yearning to live is in tension with the anxiety towards one's own contingency.\n\nA sense of responsibility is in tension with the temptation towards escapism.\n\nA yearning for freedom exists in tension with the awareness of partial slaveries.\n\nA need for union and communion of life with others is in tension with the constant danger of egocentrism.\n\nA need for a loving and protective presence is in tension with the very human pain of loneliness.\n\nA need for a collective solidarity is in tension with the common attraction to exclusive ghettos.\n\nGod speaks to us in signs, the witness of others, the sacraments, scripture, physical creation. The tensions in our lives can also be a sign, a call from God to resolve that tension in a responsible way. An awareness of these basic tensions confirmed in me the need for on-going Ignatian discernment. God can be a rock of security for us in the midst of our insecurity. I certainly have felt this in the periods of insecurity I have experienced. God can redeem and free us. This freedom has come to me in unexpected ways. I am thankful for the graces I have received. God's Covenant calls us to live in community. However imperfect, Jesuit religious life has been a blessing and solace to me.\n\nSpiritual Discernment\n\nIf you look at the sub-section on this web-site \"Spiritual Discernment,\" you'll see that discernment is an integral part of Ignatian spirituality. Though an important separate step, discernment is a helpmate to theological reflection and vice versa. Thus these two sub-sections need to be read together. What follows below is part of both theological reflection and spiritual discernment.\n\nChristians and Muslims Invited to Work for World Peace\n\nIn his first encyclical God is Love, Pope Benedict XVI reminds us that Mary, the mother of Jesus, \"is a woman who loves.\" Mary brought the love of God to her cousin Elizabeth and to John the Baptist in Elizabeth's womb. Mary recognizes the need of the spouses at Cana and tells her Son. At the Cross Mary stays with her Son. After the Resurrection as they wait for the Holy Spirit Mary prays with the apostles. Mary is our mother today and brings us God's love and reconciliation.\n\n\"Teach us to know and love God so that we too can become capable of true love and be fountains of living water in the midst of a thirsting world.\" Pope Benedict XVI tells us that the parable of the Good Samaritan teaches that \"anyone who needs me, and whom I can help is my neighbor. Despite being extended to all humankind, neighbor is not reduced to a generic, abstract and undemanding expression of love, but calls for my own practical commitment here and now.\" Recently the Cincinnati Catholic Telegraph recounted how Julie Hagerty, a former student of mine here at Xavier, went across the ocean and across faith boundaries to connect with Muslims in Kosovo.\n\nRecently Muslim scholars of the world wrote an open letter to Pope Benedict XVI and other Catholic leaders emphasizing how central love of God and love of our neighbor is to each of our faiths. The scholars invited Catholic and Muslims who together are more than half the world's population to work together for peace. (See www.acommonword.com) Christian scholars responded with Loving God and Neighbor Together (www.yale.edu/faith) \"When anyone or anything besides God commands our ultimate allegiance a ruler, a nation, economic progress, or anything else we end up serving idols and inevitably get mired in deep and deadly conflicts.\"\n\nVATICAN CITY, JUNE 16, 2008 (Zenit.org).- Christians and Muslims alike believe that it is their duty to show compassion toward every human being, given that God is compassionate, concluded the Islamic-Catholic Liaison Committee.\n\nThis was one of five conclusions from the 14th meeting of the committee, which was held in the Vatican last Wednesday through Friday.\n\nThe Catholic delegation was headed by Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, while the Islamic delegation was headed by Professor Hamid bin Ahmad Al-Rifaie, president of the International Islamic Forum for Dialogue, of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe pontifical council released a statement Sunday about the meeting, which had the theme \"Christians and Muslims as Witnesses of the God of Justice, of Peace and of Compassion in a World Suffering From Violence.\"\n\nThe Vatican statement reported, \"The topic was treated from a religious point of view according to the teaching of our two religious traditions.\"\n\nThe committee agreed on five points, the first being that \"from the inherent dignity of each human being stem fundamental rights and duties.\"\n\nThey added: \"Justice is a priority in our world. It requires, beyond the implementation of the existing legal provisions, the respect of the fundamental needs of individuals and peoples through an attitude of love, fraternity and solidarity. There can be no true and lasting peace without justice.\n\n\"Peace is a gift from God and also requires the commitment of all human beings, and particularly believers, who are called to be vigilant witnesses to peace in a world afflicted by violence in many forms.\n\n\"Christians and Muslims believe that God is compassionate and therefore they consider it their duty to show compassion towards every human person, especially the needy and the weak.\"\n\nFinally, the committee affirmed that religions, \"if authentically practiced, effectively contribute in promoting brotherhood and harmony in the human family.\"\n\nThe Vatican communique concluded by explaining that Benedict XVI received the participants in audience. He \"encouraged them to continue their endeavors for the promotion of justice and peace.\"\n\nIn my own prayer I make acts of love to the Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit and am conscious of their love of me. I make acts of love to Mary who can bring all of us together despite our different faiths, cultures, and philosophies. I also make acts of love to my fellow religious, my family and friends in this life and the next, those who oppose or disagree with me. Such acts of love take the edge off any differences I experience.\n\nHoly Saturday\n\nThe Catholic liturgy for Holy Saturday night traces how God has acted in history: the creation story, the gradually evolving Covenant with Abraham, Moses, David. Reading V is from the prophet Isaiah 55.1-11:\"Thus says the Lord: All you who are thirsty, come to the water! You who have no money, come, receive grain and eat; come, without paying and without cost, drink wine and milk! For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord. As high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are my ways above your ways and my thoughts above your thoughts.\n\nGod's grace is a gift, we don't have to pay for it. Our parents give us life and raise us freely. We should be ready to give ourselves to one another in service and solidarity. God is near, often in our neighbor.\n\nSince our thoughts are not always God's thoughts, we need spiritual discernment to separate God?s thoughts from our rationalizations and self-deceptions.\n\nEzekiel 36.25-28 \"I will sprinkle clean water upon you to cleanse you from all your impurities, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. I will give you a new heart and place a new spirit within you, taking from your bodies your stony hearts and giving you natural hearts. I will put my spirit within you and make you live by my statutes, careful to observe my decrees. You shall live in the land I gave your fathers; you shall be my people, and I will be your God.\" The latter was the formula for marriage, e.g. \"I, Isaac, shall be your husband. You Rebecca, shall be my wife.\"\n\nLight and Dark Graced Story\n\nA classic example of Graced Story is the Confessions of St. Augustine. As Augustine reflects on his story, he bursts into prayer to God: \"Late have I loved you, O Beauty ever ancient, ever new, late have I loved you!. . You were with me, but I was not with you. . You called, you shouted, and you broke through my deafness. You flashed, you shone, and you dispelled my blindness. You breathed your fragrance on me; I drew in breath and now I pant for you. I have tasted you, now I hunger and thirst for more. You touched me, and I burned for your peace.\"\n\n. \"Sing to the Lord a new song. . .a song is a thing of joy; more profoundly, it is a thing of love. . anyone who has learned to love the new life has learned to sing a new song. . . sing with your voices, your hearts, your lips and your lives.\"\n\nThe Deists thought the world was created by God, the Grand Architect, with natural physical and natural moral laws. Once created, the world was left on its own to evolve according to those natural laws. Creating the world was like winding up a clock, setting it on a shelf to unwind by itself. In contrast, the Hebrews and Christians believed that God acted in history. God intervened in three main ways.\n\nFirst, God revealed Himself\\Herself to the Hebrew people as one friend reveals herself/himself to another, slowly, gradually, but intimately.\n\nSecondly, God intervenes in history by revealing principles and values to live by.\n\nThe third main way God intervenes is by entering history, being with us and for us, helping us on our journey.\n\nIn the book of Exodus the notion of covenant expands as Moses is commissioned to lead God's people to freedom and the promised land. God is the liberator of the oppressed. The Hebrews were poor and powerless and the Lord freed them, leading them as a column of cloud by day and a pillar of fire at night. As Yahweh didn't stay neutral in the conflict between the Hebrews and the Egyptians, so God is not neutral today in the struggle for freedom and human rights, including human rights in Israel-Palestine. (\"Scholars today say the Promised Land was not so much a land conquered by outsiders as a land united by people already there. America and the Founding of Israel, An Investigation of the Morality of America's Role.)\n\nPart of our journey includes using our imagination, our talents to create a world more in accord with God's Word. We are invited today to interact with God, receiving Revelation in Faith and responding by being co-creators with God, preparing the earth for its final transformation and transfiguration at the end time. We are co-creators when we use our talents and our person to make this a better world in some small way or in some more significant way. I first felt the call to be a co-creator in the 1960's, and the mission still energizes me today. Before that I was concerned mainly with the rules of my religious life, with study and prayer. Since my participation in the Loyola University Pastoral Institute, I feel that my pioneering efforts have made a difference; and I find satisfaction in my work.\n\nGraced history is more theology than history.\n\nGraced story can be divided into the light and dark aspects. The light graced story recalls God's love for us and how we have taken that love to others. We need to savor the light graced story because we tend to pass lightly over the light graced story and move quickly to the dark graced story. We have been loved, and we have loved others. Others have understood us, and we have understood others. We have known genuine friendship.\n\n\"I seek peace, let me BE peace. I seek justice, let me be just. I seek a world of kindness, let me be kind. I seek a world of generosity, let me be generous with all that I have. I seek a world of sharing, let me share all that I have. I seek a world of giving, let me be giving to all around me. I seek a world of love, let me be loving beyond all reason, beyond all normal expectation, beyond all societal frameworks that tell me how much love is \"normal,\" beyond all fear that giving too much love will leave me with too little. And let me be open and sensitive to all the love that is already coming to me, the love of people I know, the love that is part of the human condition, the accumulated love of past generations that flows through and is embodied in the language, music, recipes, technology, literature, religions, agriculture, and family heritages that have been passed on to me and to us. Let me pass that love on to the next generations in an even fuller and more explicit way.\n\nSource of goodness and love in the universe, let me be alive to all the goodness that surrounds me. And let that awareness of the goodness and love of the universe be my shield and protector. Hear the words of my mouth and may the meditations of my heart find acceptance before You, Eternal Friend, who protects and frees me. Amen. \"\n\nThe Tikkun Community\n\nOne witness to the closeness of God, someone who knew of loneliness and dark nights, the Jesuit priest Fr. Alfred Delp. Delp was arrested and sentenced to death during the Third Reich in Germany because he had contacts with the resistance movement against Adolf Hitler. On Nov. 17, 1944, Fr. Delp writes: \"One thing is preciously clear and tangible to me: the world is so full of God. . In everything, God wants to celebrate encounter, and asks and wants the loving answer. The challenge and the charge is only this: to make--or allow to develop--out of these insights and graces a permanent consciousness, and a permanent attitude. Then life becomes free, with the freedom we have so often sought.\" ( Fr. Willie Lambert, S.J. Directions for Communication, Discoveries with Ignatius Loyola, p. 176)\n\nIn the First Covenant one generation remembered its past at the Passover and interpreted the past to the next generation. \"And when your children ask you, 'What does this ritual mean?' you will tell them, 'It is the sacrifice of the Passover.'\" (Exodus 12.26) In the Second Covenant Jesus asked this remembrance or anamnesis in the Eucharist, \"Do this in memory of me.\" (Luke 22.19) Since the light graced story gives us courage and confidence, I recommend praying over our light graced story first. This puts our dark graced story in perspective.\n\nWe do experience evil. We have inflicted evil on others. Can this evil story be graced? I think it can. God can be present in the dark graced story revealing that it is evil, calling us to move from evil to good, helping us to move from dark to light, giving us strength, consolation, and hope in our suffering.\n\nWe are not simply passive spectators in this story. We make history ourselves by making decisions. St. Ignatius Loyola had a method of making a decision in the Spirit. Put simply, we make good decisions at a time when we are in spiritual consolation. We make bad decisions when in a period of spiritual desolation. In a time of spiritual consolation we are moving toward God. In a period of spiritual desolation we are moving toward selfishness and neglect of our neighbor and the earth.\n\nOur decisions need to be in continuity with our past. If we have assimilated our past, we are more genuinely present and can make better decisions about the future. Although we find God in our bodies and in our emotions, spiritual consolation and desolation are not always the same as psychological consolation and desolation. If our mourning is moving us to alleviate the suffering of others and bringing us closer to God and our neighbor, we can be sad, mourning for those who are suffering, and still be in spiritual consolation.\n\nBy reading and reflecting on Scripture and history, we can discern after a time the main ways in which God has acted in our world. When we read history, perhaps it is better if we look at the point of view of the poor and the powerless as well as that of the rich and the powerful.\n\nBy reflecting on our own lives we can see how God has been present to us as individuals and as groups in similar ways. Has God helped us to draw good out of evil? Have we achieved much more than anticipated? Are we really doing all of this ourselves?\n\nAt the last supper Jesus tells the Apostles He will send the Holy Spirit who will instruct them and remind them of everything. (John 14.26) The Holy Spirit can help us to remember in God and help us to determine our forward direction. Life may be understood backwards into the past, but it is lived forward into the future.\n\nI feel I need my faith to calm my fears, to energize me for the work ahead, to help me to be honest with myself. St. Ignatius wanted the Society of Jesus to think with the church but also to challenge the church. In the 1530's the Society of Jesus was an innovative idea. St. Ignatius struggled to get approval of his spirituality. In the end, Ignatian spirituality was accepted with enthusiasm.\n\nI personally like big thoughts and enjoy the sweep of Scripture and history. If that's not your thing, you can find value in your own story and in the stories of those about you. Certainly Scripture is a privileged place to find God's ways, and I will attempt to show briefly some main ways in which God has acted in scriptural times.\n\nGod's Action in Scripture\n\nIn both the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, God's relationship with His people is described as a covenant. A covenant is different from a commercial contract. Since a covenant deals more with personal relationships than with things, marriage is better described as a covenant rather than a contract. Athletes enter into a contract which deals with an exchange of services. Those who buy a home or a car enter into a contract for the payment of a specific amount of money over a particular period of time. A covenant relationship grows rather than stays static. In a covenant there is more sharing than winning or losing. Even in our giving we receive. A covenant relationship includes God as the most important person in the covenant.\n\nGod's Action in the Hebrew Covenant\n\nIn the first book of the Bible, Genesis tells us that God created the world because Yahweh wanted to share with us. each one of us has dignity, value and worth in God's eyes.\n\nJustice is fidelity to the demands of relationship. If persons neglect their family or are unfair to their neighbor, worship of God is not true worship. \"If you would offer me holocausts, then let justice surge like water, and goodness like an unfailing stream.\" (Amos 5.21)\n\nGod takes humankind's freedom seriously. The human race neglects the covenant mediated by Moses and sins. By sin we separate ourselves from God, from one another, and from physical creation.\n\nSome judge Israel to have been mediocre in relationship to surrounding cultures, but they agree that the Hebrews excelled in their religious sense and morals. The gods of other contemporary cultures were very human: fighting, lustful, often cruel, capricious and unpredictable, needing to be placated by magic or human sacrifice, with cults that often glorified war, pillage, the degradation of women, and incest. Israel's God is wholly other in the unmixed goodness which is uniquely Yahweh's. Dictionary of the Bible, 317)\n\nIsrael was a people of God, a community. Each Israelite related to God as a member of that people. Each individual's identity is found in the community's covenant with God. No individual can live a holy and full life while ignoring other members of the community. No individual can worship God and be unjust to his/her neighbor. Nor were foreigners or sojourners to be excluded from care. \"When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. The stranger who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.\" (Leviticus 19.33, 34)\n\nChapter 25 of Leviticus describes the Jubilee year during which wealth and property were redistributed\n\nGod gave Joseph the grace to forgive his brothers who had plotted to kill him and who sold Joseph into slavery. Joseph was not vindictive. Later Joseph fed his brothers in time of famine. (Genesis, Chapter 45)\n\nFidelity to the covenant brings land and security. (Deuteronomy Chapter 5) The Lord frees the Hebrews when the Egyptians maltreat and oppress the Hebrews, imposing hard labor on them. (Deuteronomy 26.6-9)\n\nThe notion of the covenant is a concrete picture rather than an abstract definition. The idea of the covenant expands to include the reign of David and Solomon. We see the covenant as a kingdom. The relationship of God is to Yahweh's people as a nation not to isolated individuals, separate from one another. (Second Book of Samuel, Chapter 7) Solomon does not ask for riches but to discern right from wrong. Although Solomon does get material goods, his priority is to be able to judge morally. God is pleased with Solomon?s prayer. (Third Book of Kings, Chapter 3)\n\nTobit feeds the hungry and clothes the naked. God hears the cry of the poor not necessarily directly but through Tobit.\n\nThe psalms are sacred hymns, a summary of Hebrew belief, the result of God?s revelation. Since the earth is the Lord's, we become stewards of God's earth. God resists and puts down the proud. Although the arrogant shut themselves off from God and their neighbor, the meek shall possess the land. Because God's anointed cherishes the poor as an object of special love, the anointed of God saves the poor and the oppressed. God loves us and frees us. (Psalms 24, 37, 72, 82, 113, 73, 135)\n\n\"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. In verdant pastures he gives me repose. Beside restful waters he leads me. He refreshes my soul. He guides in right paths for His name's sake. Even though I walk in the dark valley I fear no evil; for you are at my side with your rod and your staff that give my courage. You spread the table before me in the sight of my foes; You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows. Only goodness and kindness follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for years to come.\" Psalm 23\n\nJuly 3, 2012\n\nThe Psalms of Peace, Part I, Psalm 33 BY JOHN DEAR\n\n\"A king is not saved by a mighty army, nor a warrior delivered by great strength. Useless is the war horse for safety; its great strength, no sure escape. But the eyes of the God of peace are upon the reverent, upon those who hope for God's gracious help.\" (Ps. 33: 16-18)\n\nPsalm 33 is a hymn of praise to the God of peace and a warning to those who place their hope and trust in the false gods of war. You can?t serve both the God of peace and the weapons of war, it announces. It?s one or the other. Show reverence to the God of peace and live in peace, gratitude and joy, or show reverence to the weapons of war and their false security and die. That's the message I get from the text. It's more radical and helpful than any spiritual writing you'll find today.\n\nNo, you say, this is just pious Bible talk. A king, an emperor, a president, yes even Barack Obama as well as George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, are saved by a mighty army, by bombs, by drones, by Trident submarines, by nuclear weapons. That is the logic of every nation, every military, every war. The God of peace cannot save us. Only our weapons and warriors can save us. This is what we have been taught, what we hear preached, why we wave the flag, why we pay taxes to the Pentagon, why we risk radioactive waste, why we threaten to destroy the planet, why we spend nearly all our money on warfare instead of on schools, healthcare, affordable housing, food for the hungry and environmental cleanup. This is what most of us believe. Might makes right. Violence saves us. War is the will of God.\n\nNot too long ago, one U.S. archbishop said these exact words to me: God cannot save us. Only nuclear weapons can protect us. They are our only hope.\n\nTrust in the weapons of war and the U.S. military has now reached unimaginable heights. According to the 2012-2013 budget, U.S. military spending will exceed the military spending of all other countries in the world--combined. Over one half of this year's budget (54%) goes to the Department of Defense (that is, the Department of War)--$686 billion. China's budget spends $114 billion for war; France $61 billion; the United Kingdom $57 billion; Russia $53 billion; and Canada $20 billion. Iran pays $8 billion; North Korea, $7 billion; Pakistan $5 billion; Venezuela $3 billion and Syria $2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. taxpayers will pay $121 billion alone for our ongoing warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq. That specific amount could have provided 1.8 million U.S. elementary school teachers for one year, OR 15.5 million people with low income healthcare for one year, OR 15.4 million one year scholarships for university students. Instead we trust in the weapons of war, and our economy is crashing, our schools are crumbling, millions have no healthcare, billions suffer in extreme poverty around the world---and we keep building and maintaining weapons that cannot protect us from terrorist attack.\n\nSince 2001, we have spent $1.4 trillion for war in Iraq and Afghanistan. That same amount of money would have provided universal health care for all Americans for those same ten years. What has this war brought us? Over 6400 U.S. service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, over 300,000 with traumatic brain injuries and PTSD. Civilian deaths estimated in the hundreds of thousands. And still, the U.S. ranks 25th in the world in infant mortality; 37th in the world in overall healthcare; 17th in the world in terms of life expectancy; the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world, and so forth. (For more information about these statistics and to order cards with them, go to www.mapm.org).\n\nPsalm 33 presents a stark challenge. Reliance on war, funding for war, and waging war are futile. If you place your hope in war, then know that you are not placing your hope in the God of peace. If you trust in weapons and warfare for your security, then know that you are not trusting in the God of peace and you are doomed to failure and death.\n\nThis truth is presented as if it is a law of nature, like a law of gravity. Jesus picks up on the message when he says: If you live by the sword, the weapon, the bomb, you will die by the sword, the weapon, the bomb. Therefore, do not live by the sword, the weapon or the bomb. Live by the way of peace, he says, and you will live. This is the first requirement of the spiritual life, the politics of the spiritual life: renounce warfare and take up the way of peace.\n\nCan we build our lives upon this sacred text? Could we fashion a culture?dare I say a Judeo/Christian society---after these words? If we did, then we would be blessed with a new spirit of peace in our hearts and lives.\n\nThe nonviolent Jesus must have studied and prayed through this text because it provides the basic foundation for his Sermon on the Mount. If we likewise pray over and ponder these words, then we would become Sermon on the Mount people, who seek to end war, create justice, make peace, offer universal love and welcome God?s reign of nonviolence on earth.\n\nLet all who dwell in the world show reverence... The God of peace foils the plan of the nations?From heaven, the God of peace looks down and observes the whole human race, surveying from the royal throne all who dwell on earth. The One who fashioned the hearts of them all knows all their works? (Ps. 33: 13-15, 8, 10)\n\nPsalm 33 calls us to turn back to the God of peace who sees the violence we commit and to live in God?s peace, with gratitude, joy and praise. But the specific word it uses is reverence.\n\nTwice, Psalm 33 invites us to become people of reverence. That was one of Albert Schweitzer?s favorite words. Webster?s defines reverence as ?a feeling or attitude of deep respect, love and awe for something sacred; veneration. Or a manifestation of this respect, love and awe.? As people of reverence, we maintain an attitude of deep respect, love and awe for the God of peace. We venerate the God of peace. We manifest our respect, love and awe for the God of peace in the way we live. That means, we are focused on the God of peace. We bow toward the God of peace. We live in, and through, and for the God of peace. We defer to the God of peace. We seek the God of peace. We breathe in the God of peace, and speak and heed the words of the God of peace.\n\nThe eyes of the God of peace are upon the reverent, we are told, \"upon those who hope for God?s gracious help.\"\n\nIn this spirit of reverence, we take time each day for silent adoration of the God of peace. Then we go through our day with one eye--our third eye, the Buddhists would say--on the God of peace. As we keep our eye on the God of peace, the God of peace keeps both eyes on us. What a blessing!\n\nPeople of reverence are people of mindfulness, peaceableness, nonviolence, love and compassion. Living in reverence leads to equanimity because we are rooted in our attitude of respect, love and awe for the God of peace. This is a good way to live. We need not support the culture of war, or be tossed about the media?s glorification of violence, war, or stupid politics, or our own day to day worries and anxieties. We remain centered, mindful, conscious, and alert.\n\nI think many of us want to be people of reverence but we also want at the same time to maintain our American culture, its weapons, its wars, its armies, and the Pentagon. Psalm 33 insists that we cannot have it both ways. Reject the culture of war, it commands. Learn new ways to resolve conflict nonviolently, and return to the God of peace. Then you will be able to reclaim your soul, and discover a deep foundation for peace, joy and gratitude as you wait on the God of peace. That?s the conclusion:\n\nOur soul waits for the God of peace who is our help and shield. For in the God of peace our hearts rejoice.\n\nIn your holy name we trust. May your kindness, God of peace, be upon us. We have put our hope in you.\n\nThis is a pledge and a prayer. Instead of trusting in America, its military, its drones and its nuc"
