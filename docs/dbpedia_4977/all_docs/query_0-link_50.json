        "text": "The Northwest Ordinance abolishes slavery in the Northwest Territory above the Ohio River, which includes the present-day states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution is drafted in Philadelphia. The document does not explicitly mention slavery. However, four different parts of the Constitution reflect a compromise on the issue. First, representation in the House is in proportion to the sum of “free persons” and “three-fifths” of “all other persons,” (i.e., slaves). Article I, Section 9 includes a “migration or importation” clause that prohibits the slave trade from being banned before 1808 but nevertheless provides that a tax May be levied on imported slaves. The Fugitive Slave Clause of Article IV, Section 3 provides that “Person[s] held to Service or Labour,” (i.e., slaves), escaping from one state shall be delivered to the party “to whom such Service or Labour May be due.” Finally, Article V makes the slave trade clause unamendable.\n\nThe First American Women’s Rights Convention takes place in Seneca Falls, New York.\n\nBenjamin Roberts, a free black living in Boston, attempts to enroll his daughter Sarah in the public schools, but she is denied entrance because of her race. Roberts, joined by anti-slavery activist Charles Sumner sues the city, challenging its segregated school system. Anticipating arguments that would be made a century later, Roberts and Sumner argue that black schools have inferior resources to white schools and that segregation injures both races. They contend that segregation creates feelings of degradation among blacks and fosters prejudice in whites. The next year, in Roberts v. City of Boston, 59 Mass. 198 (1849), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts rejects Roberts’ and Sumner’s arguments. The Court holds that they had not proven that the black school was inferior. The Court offers a separate but equal rationale for segregated schools, reasoning that “prejudice, if it exists, is not created by law, and probably cannot be changed by law.” Chief Justice Shaw’s opinion is later cited by Justice Brown in his opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nFebruary\n\nSouthern States meet in Montgomery to draft a Confederate Constitution. It forbids the passage of any law denying the right of property in slaves, and citizens of the Confederacy are guaranteed the right to take their slaves into any territory acquired by the Confederate states.\n\nThe U.S. Congress passes a proposed thirteenth amendment to the Constitution, which Abraham Lincoln endorses in his inaugural address. It provides that no amendment shall be made to the Constitution to authorize Congress to abolish or interfere with the domestic institutions of any state, including “that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.” The amendment represents a desperate attempt to hold the Union together. Ohio, Maryland, and Illinois approve the amendment, but with the outbreak of the Civil War, it is forgotten.\n\nApril\n\nCivil War begins.\n\nCongress passes the Thirteenth Amendment, abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude. It is ratified by the states in December.\n\nMarch\n\nCongress establishes the Freedman’s Bureau to provide aid to former slaves during Reconstruction.\n\nApril\n\nOn the 9th, General Robert E. Lee surrenders to the General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomatox Courthouse, Virginia, ending the Civil War. On the 14th, John Wilkes Booth assassinates Abraham Lincoln at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. Vice President Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, is sworn in as President. In May, President Johnson grants amnesty to former Confederate officials.\n\nFall\n\nBlack Codes proliferate across the South, segregating public schools and barring blacks from voting, entering into contracts, holding property, serving on juries, and testifying against whites. The Black Codes are generally understood as an attempt to reduce the newly freed blacks to a condition little better than slavery.\n\nSenator Charles Sumner introduces a bill to Congress to outlaw public school segregation and segregation in common carriers and public accommodations, under Congress’s powers to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. The school desegregation provision is later removed. A modified version of the bill is passed as the Civil Rights Act of 1875 after Sumner’s death.\n\nFebruary\n\nHiram R. Revels of Mississippi, the first black man to be elected to the Senate, takes his seat. In December, Joseph H. Rainey, the first black man to be elected to the House of Representatives, joins Congress as a representative from South Carolina. Rainey becomes the first black man to preside over the House as Speaker pro tempore in 1874.\n\nFrom 1870 to 1876, nine Southern states send 20 black men to Congress. When the last of these elected officials leaves his seat in 1901, no other African American serves in Congress until 1928.\n\nMarch\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment, guaranteeing blacks the right to vote, is ratified.\n\nIn the Slaughterhouse Cases, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 (1873), the Supreme Court upholds a Louisiana statute requiring butchers in the city of New Orleans to use a common slaughterhouse. Justice Miller’s opinion strictly limits the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was originally intended to be the basic guarantor of civil equality. The Court’s interpretation virtually reads the Clause out of the Constitution. Later, in Bradwell v. Illinois, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 130 (1873), the Court holds that Myra Bradwell has no right to be admitted to the Illinois state bar. The Court argues that the right to choose one’s profession does not constitute a privilege or immunity of citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment and that women in particular are not fit to be lawyers because of their legal and natural disabilities. Two years later, in Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162 (1875), the Court confirms that the Privileges or Immunities Clause does not give women the right to vote.\n\nIn Pace v. Alabama, 106 U.S. 583 (1883), the Supreme Court upholds an Alabama statute that punishes fornication and adultery more heavily when the parties are of different races. The Court reasons that the statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the penalty applies equally to whites and blacks who engage in interracial adultery or sex.\n\nIn United States v. Harris, 106 U.S. 629 (1883), the Court holds unconstitutional portions of the the Ku Klux Klan Act ( the Civil Rights Act of 1871). The Court holds that Congress cannot reach purely private conspiracies to violate civil rights under its powers to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. Later that year, in The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), the Court strikes down the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which prohibits discrimination in places of public accommodation, on the ground that the Fourteenth Amendment reaches only state action and that Congress has no power to regulate private discrimination. Justice Bradley’s majority opinion states that blacks had been freed from slavery, and that it was time that they “cease[] to be the special favorite of the laws.”\n\nIn King v. Gallagher, 93 N.Y. 438 (1883), The Court of Appeals of New York upholds segregated schools where black schools have equal facilities.\n\nBlack disenfranchisement unfolds through a typical pattern in many states at the turn of the century. Black participation in elections is reduced through force and fraud. Legislatures controlled by Democrats enact complex voter registration requirements that reduce the number of black votes. Amendments to state constitutions impose poll taxes and literacy tests.\n\nIn Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), the so-called “black disenfranchisement” case, the Supreme Court effectively acquiesces in these practices and upholds Alabama’s voter registration scheme. Justice Holmes rejects the claim that the state is trying to prevent blacks from registering to vote. More importantly, even if that was the goal, Holmes argues, there is nothing that the Supreme Court can do to prevent it: “Apart from damages to the individual, relief from a great political wrong, if done, as alleged, by the people of a state and the state itself, must be given by them or by the legislative and political department of the government of the United States.”\n\nSpring\n\nAfter the Daughters of the American Revolution bar Marian Anderson, a black contralto, from singing in Washington, D.C.’s Constitution Hall, Eleanor Roosevelt publicly resigns from the organization. The NAACP obtains permission from the Department of the Interior to have an outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial at which Marion Anderson performs. The event becomes a symbol for racial equality. Nevertheless, neither Eleanor nor Franklin Roosevelt publicly speak out against Jim Crow. Civil rights advocates throughout the 1930s fail to achieve anti-lynching legislation, the abolition of the poll tax, and full inclusion of blacks in a variety of New Deal programs.\n\nDecember\n\nIn Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. 337 (1938), the Supreme Court decides in favor of Lloyd Gaines, a black student who had been refused admission to the University of Missouri Law School. The Court holds that the state must furnish Gaines “within its borders facilities for legal education substantially equal to those which the State there offered for the persons of the white race, whether or not other Negroes sought the same opportunity.”\n\nThe Soldiers Vote Act abolishes the poll tax as a prerequisite for voting by members of the armed services.\n\nDuring the Southern election campaigns of 1942, lynchings resurge as an intimidation tactic. In Mississippi, for example, three lynchings occur in a single week. Throughout the course of 1942, black soldiers are beaten or shot by whites in the South. Concerned about the pervasive crisis in black morale, the federal government for the first time becomes involved in the prosecution of lynchings.\n\nOn February 19, President Roosevelt issues Executive Order 9066. It authorizes the Secretary of War and his subordinates to designate military zones from which “any or all persons May be excluded.” All persons of Japanese, German, and Italian ancestry residing in “zone No. 1,” which includes most of the Western United States, are ordered to give military authorities notice if they decide to change residence. On May 3, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt issues Civilian Exclusion Order 34, which states that all persons of Japanese ancestry – including both Japanese resident aliens and American citizens– are to be removed from Military Area No. 1 and placed in internment camps. Many of them remain in the camps until 1946.\n\nThe NAACP board of directors formally endorses Thurgood Marshall’s view that the NAACP should devote its efforts solely to an all-out attack on segregation in education rather than pressing for the equalization of segregated facilities.\n\nJanuary\n\nIn Sipuel v. University of Oklahoma Board of Regents, 332 U.S. 631 (1948), a unanimous Supreme Court holds that Lois Ada Sipuel cannot be denied entrance to a state law school solely because of her race. In response, the University of Oklahoma designates an area in the state capitol as the “negro law school” and hires three black lawyers to be the faculty. In Fisher v. Hurst, 333 U.S. 147 (1948), the Supreme Court refuses to order the state to desegregate its law school, holding that it is the province of the district court to determine if the University of Oklahoma has followed the Court’s mandate. On remand, the trial court gives the state the option of establishing a separate black law school. In 1949, Sipuel is finally admitted to the University of Oklahoma’s law school, but she is forced to sit in a raised chair apart from other students behind a sign reading “colored.” She is required to enter the law school from a separate entrance and to eat alone in the school cafeteria. She graduates from the law school in 1951.\n\nFebruary\n\nPresident Truman sends a message to Capitol Hill calling for the enactment of some of his civil rights committee’s recommendations, including an end to segregated schools and employment discrimination. He does not introduce any legislation.\n\nMay\n\nIn Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), the Supreme Court holds that judicial enforcement of racially restrictive covenants in private housing violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.\n\nJuly\n\nPresident Truman orders the desegregation of the Armed Forces. Army Chief of Staff Omar Bradley declares, “The Army is not out to make any social reform. The Army will not put men of different races in the same companies. It will change that policy when the nation as a whole changes it.” Truman’s order is not implemented until after the North Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950. The process of desegregating the Army is not “complete” until 1954, at which point no unit is more than 50% black.\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Southern delegates stage a walk-out to protest the civil rights plank of the party platform. Dissident members of the party form the States’ Rights Party, also called the Dixiecrats. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina is their nominee for President.\n\nOctober\n\nIn Perez v. Lippold, 198 P.2d 17 (1948), the Supreme Court of California holds that the state’s ban on interracial marriage violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nDecember\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly adopts and proclaims The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It provides that all people are entitled to basic human rights without regard for race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nFebruary\n\nOn February 28, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka is filed in federal district court in Kansas.\n\nMay\n\nNAACP lawyer Spottswood Robinson files Davis v. Prince Edward County, a challenge to Virginia’s segregated schools and another of the cases eventually consolidated with Brown.\n\nBriggs v. Elliott, the South Carolina case, goes to trial. Marshall and the NAACP present a vast array of social science evidence showing how segregation harms black school children, including Kenneth Clark’s controversial “Doll Study.” A three judge panel upholds segregation in the schools by a vote of 2 to 1.\n\nJune\n\nBrown v. Board of Education goes to trial with Robert Carter leading the NAACP legal team. In August, a three judge panel unanimously holds that “no willful, intentional or substantial discrimination” exists in the Topeka public schools. The court finds that the physical facilities in white and black schools are comparable and that the Supreme Court’s decisions in Sweatt v. Painter and McLaurin apply only to graduate education. However, the court also includes a finding of fact that echoes the testimony of the social science experts by noting that segregation has a detrimental effect on black school children. “The impact [of segregation] is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group… . Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to retard the educational and mental development of Negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racially integrated school system.”\n\nOctober\n\nThe Delaware cases, Belton v. Gebhart and Bulah v. Gebhart, go to trial.\n\nJune\n\nThe black community of Baton Rouge, Louisiana launches a mass boycott against segregated buses, marking the beginning of the direct action phase of the Civil Rights Movement. Organized through a network of local black churches, the boycott is led by Reverend T.J. Jemison, pastor of one of the largest black churches in the city. The boycott lasts seven days and proves highly successful. It galvanizes the black community; the New York Times reports that at least 90% of the black population participates. Eventually, white city leaders compromise by agreeing to reserve the two side front seats of the bus for whites and the long rear seat for blacks. All other seating is to be filled on a first-come, first-serve basis. Although the victory is limited, news of the success of this direct-action grass-roots strategy reverberates throughout black church networks across the South.\n\nThe Supreme Court orders a second round of arguments in Brown, originally scheduled for October 12.\n\nSeptember\n\nChief Justice Vinson dies unexpectedly of a heart attack on the 8th. President Eisenhower nominates California Governor Earl Warren to replace Vinson as interim Chief on the 30th. The Court reschedules arguments in Brown for December. Warren is confirmed as Chief Justice by the Senate in March of 1954.\n\nDecember\n\nSecond round of arguments in Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nMay 3rd\n\nIn Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954), the Supreme Court strikes down state policies that discriminate against Mexican Americans in jury selection.\n\nMay 17th\n\nThe Supreme Court decides Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (Brown I), declaring that racial segregation in public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause. The same day, it holds that racial segregation in the District of Columbia public schools violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954).\n\nIn the wake of the decision, the District of Columbia and some school districts in the border states begin to desegregate their schools voluntarily. State legislatures in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia adopt resolutions of “interposition and nullification” that declare the Court’s decision to be “null, void, and no effect.” Various southern legislatures pass laws that impose sanctions on anyone who implements desegregation, and enact school closing plans that authorize the suspension of public education and the disbursement of public funds to parents to send their children to private schools. The governor of Virginia declares that he will do everything within his power to maintain segregated schools. Some states enact statutes mandating school segregation, ordering state and local officials to take all measures within their authority to preserve segregation, terminating funding for racially mixed schools, and repealing compulsory attendance laws.\n\nThe Court schedules arguments on remedy in Brown for October but eventually puts them off to April of 1955.\n\nIn a series of per curiam opinions handed down between 1954 and 1962, the Supreme Court holds unconstitutional a wide variety of Jim Crow laws, citing Brown as authority. The Court strikes down segregation in golf courses and fishing lakes in Muir v. Louisville Park Theatrical Ass’n., 347 U.S. 971 (1954) and Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U.S. 879 (1955); in public beaches, bathhouses, and swimming pools in Mayor of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350 U.S. 877 (1955); in a public law school in Florida ex rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control, 350 U.S. 413 (1956); on buses in Gayle v. Browder, 352 U.S. 903 (1956); in city parks in New Orleans City Park Improvement Ass’n v. Detiege, 358 U.S. 54 (1958); and in airport restaurants and rest rooms in Turner v. City of Memphis, 369 U.S. 350 (1962).\n\nThe Department of Defense announces that all-black units no longer exist in the military.\n\nOctober\n\nJustice Jackson dies suddenly. President Eisenhower nominates John Marshall Harlan, the grandson of the lone dissenter in Plessy, to fill the vacancy. After long hearings before the Senate, Harlan is finally sworn in as an Associate Justice in March of 1955.\n\nApril\n\nThe Supreme Court hears its third round of arguments in Brown� this time concerning remedies.\n\nMay 31\n\nOn the last day of the Term, the Supreme Court hands down Brown II, 349 U.S. 294 (1955), ordering that desegregation occur with “all deliberate speed.”\n\nIn response to Brown II, White Citizen’s Councils are formed by businessmen and professionals to oppose desegregation. Lynchings resurge.\n\nAugust\n\nEmmett Till, a black teenager from Chicago, is murdered for saying “Bye, baby” to and allegedly whistling at a white woman while visiting relatives in Mississippi. The case quickly attracts national attention. In September, an all-white jury finds his alleged assailants not guilty of murder.\n\nDecember\n\nOn December 1, Rosa Parks refuses to relinquish her seat on a Montgomery city bus to a white passenger. She is arrested for violating municipal laws and ordered to appear for trial four days later. She is convicted and ordered to pay a fine of $10. When she refuses to pay, she is jailed.\n\nOn the 5th, the Montgomery Bus Boycott begins, inspired by Rosa Parks and led by Martin Luther King, Jr. It continues through 1956. The boycott gives King a position of leadership within the national civil rights movement and demonstrates that nonviolent methods of protest could be effective.\n\nFebruary\n\nAn angry mob prevents Autherine Lucy, a black student, from being admitted to the University of Alabama. Lucy is nearly lynched. President Eisenhower declines to employ federal force or power to secure her admission. She is eventually expelled from the University for allegedly bringing false contempt charges against a member of the Board of Trustees of the University.\n\nMarch\n\nTwenty-two Senators and 82 of the 106 Southern Representatives issue the Southern Manifesto, a declaration charging that the Court’s opinion in Brown was “a clear abuse of judicial power” that substituted the Justices’ “personal political and social ideas for the established law of the land.” They pledge to “use all lawful means to bring about the reversal of this decision which is contrary to the Constitution.” Meanwhile, The Georgia state legislature votes to adopt as its new state flag a design that includes the Confederate battle insignia.\n\nThe Supreme Court refuses to decide a challenge to miscegenation laws in Naim v. Naim, 350 U.S. 891 (1956), arguing that the record was insufficient.\n\nNovember\n\nOn the13th, the Supreme Court rules that the city ordinances segregating seating on the Montgomery city buses violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision is implemented on December 21st, finally bringing the Montgomery Bus boycott to an end.\n\nJanuary\n\nMartin Luther King and his allies found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to carry out the civil rights agenda. On February 14th, King is officially elected as leader.\n\nAugust\n\nCongress passes its first civil rights bill since 1875. It creates a Civil Rights Commission and establishes the Civil Rights division of the Justice Department. Nevertheless, the bill’s provisions are so watered down that it is widely regarded as ineffectual.\n\nSeptember\n\nArkansas Governor Orval Faubus posts members of the National Guard at the entrance of Central High School in Little Rock to prevent the court-ordered admission of black students. Three weeks after the stand off begins, the students try to enter the school and are greeted by an angry mob. On September 24th, Eisenhower finally sends 1100 army paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock, federalizes 10,000 members of the Arkansas National Guard, and orders the school to be desegregated. Governor Faubus eventually closes all four high schools in Little Rock rather than allow desegregation to continue.\n\nAccording to a poll by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, 65% of whites believe in the principle of integration.\n\nJanuary\n\nAt his inauguration as Governor of Alabama, George Wallace states: “In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny … and I say … Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!”\n\nApril\n\nCivil rights protesters led by Martin Luther King, Jr. begin boycotts, sit-ins, and demonstrations in Birmingham�perhaps the South’s most segregated city. On April 10th, the Birmingham protesters are dispersed by police dogs in a violent scene televised across the country. King is arrested and jailed for a week. He issues his famous Letter from a Birmingham Jail, explaining why civil disobedience is justified. King is released from jail on April 20th.\n\nMay\n\nKing organizes the Children’s Crusade in Birmingham. On the 2nd, he sends some 1000 children from the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church on a demonstration march through downtown Birmingham. The police promptly arrest them and take them off to jail. The next day, hundreds of students assemble at the church for another march. Police Commissioner Eugene “Bull” Connor orders firemen to turn high-pressure hoses on the protesters, and policemen confront the students with attack dogs. Over 2000 protesters are thrown in jail, and many are knocked unconscious by the fire hoses. Protesters begin throwing stones and police respond by beating them with night sticks; the protests escalate into ever-more violent confrontations. Photographers and cameramen capture the treatment of the protesters on film, and the resulting outrage sways public sympathies further toward the Civil Rights Movement. By May 10th, the Mayor of Birmingham and local business men agree to the eventual desegregation of public facilities.\n\nIn Watson v. City of Memphis, 373 U.S. 526 (1963), the Supreme Court rejects the City of Memphis’ request for a delay in desegregating its facilities. The Court writes, “Brown never contemplated that the concept of �deliberate speed’ would countenance indefinite delay in elimination of racial barriers in schools.”\n\nJune\n\nOn the 11th, Governor George Wallace tries to stop two black students from entering Alabama’s state university by standing in the doorway.\n\nOn the 12th, Medgar Evers, a field secretary for the NAACP, is murdered in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nAugust\n\nOn the 28th, two hundred fifty thousand demonstrators participate in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, gathering at the Lincoln Memorial. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivers his famous “I Have a Dream” speech.\n\nSeptember\n\nGovernor George Wallace fights a court desegregation order and delays the opening of Alabama public schools. President Kennedy federalizes the Alabama National Guard to enforce the admission of black students.\n\nOn the 15th, Birmingham’s Sixteenth Street Baptist church is bombed, killing four young black girls attending Sunday school.\n\nNovember\n\nOn the 22nd, President Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson becomes President.\n\nMore than 99.5% of black students in the South, excluding Texas and Tennessee, still attend all-black schools. Only 2.3% of black students throughout the country attend predominantly white schools.\n\nJanuary\n\nCongress passes the Twenty-fourth Amendment, which prohibits the states from imposing poll taxes as a condition for voting in elections for federal offices. It is ratified by the states the same year.\n\nMay\n\nIn Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218 (1964), the Supreme Court holds that closing the public schools in Prince Edward County and appropriating public money to support private, segregated education violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nJune\n\nThe Mississippi Freedom Summer Project begins. Hundreds of student volunteers from across the country move into black neighborhoods in Mississippi to encourage voter registration. On June 21, three civil rights workers� James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner� are reported missing. Their bodies are later discovered in an earthen dam near Philadelphia, Mississippi.\n\nJuly\n\nCongress passes the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and President Johnson signs it on the 2nd. The Act outlaws race and gender discrimination in voting, public accommodations, and employment. Title VI, which prohibits discrimination in education, becomes a major tool of desegregation efforts.\n\nNovember\n\nLyndon B. Johnson defeats Barry Goldwater in the presidential election by a margin of 16 million votes. The black vote overwhelmingly supports Johnson and signals the beginning of a fundamental realignment in American politics. Most blacks shift their allegiance to the Democratic party, and over the next thirty years the white South becomes increasingly Republican.\n\nDecember\n\nOn the 4th, President Johnson issues an executive order prohibiting discrimination in federal aid programs.\n\nOn the 7th, in McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184 (1964), the Supreme Court strikes down a criminal statute that punishes cohabitation by interracial couples more severely than cohabitation by persons of the same race.\n\nOn the 10th, Martin Luther King is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nOn the 14th, the Supreme Court upholds Congress’s power to pass Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964) and Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964).\n\nThe Philadelphia Plan, the first federal affirmative action program, begins under the aegis of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCC) in the Department of Labor. By September 1967, the Department of Labor informs all federal agencies that they must abide by the Philadelphia Plan, causing hostility among labor unions as well as contractors.\n\nFebruary\n\nOn the 21st, Malcolm X is assassinated.\n\nMarch\n\nOn “Bloody Sunday,” March 7th, six hundred demonstrators gather at the Edmund Pettus Bridge to begin a four day march from Selma to Montgomery to petition Governor Wallace for black voting rights. After the protesters cross the Pettus bridge, Alabama state troopers are unleashed on them, leading to one of the most violent episodes of the civil rights struggles. Sympathy marches occur across the country over the next few days. On the 15th, President Johnson sends a voting rights bill to Congress.\n\nAugust\n\nOn the 6th, President Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nOn the 11th, riots break out in Watts, California.\n\nSeptember\n\nCongress passes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 20 U.S.C. ��1861 et. seq., giving the federal government the ability to enforce compliance with court desegregation orders by threatening to withhold federal funding. This threat proves vital to producing genuine desegregation in the South.\n\nMarch\n\nIn Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663 (1966), the Supreme Court holds that state governments May not impose poll taxes in state elections.\n\nSummer\n\nStokey Charmichael ousts John Lewis as the head of Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Radical separatist black activists, such as Carmichael, Hubert “Rapp” Brown, who replaced Carmichael as the head of SNCC in 1967, and the soon-to-be founders of the Black Panthers Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, begin overtly challenging Martin Luther King’s leadership of the movement and his non-violent principles. The civil rights movement splinters from within. Black radicals reject integrationist strategies and call for a return to black control of local school districts in black neighborhoods under the banner of “black power.”\n\nOctober\n\nThe National Organization for Women (NOW) is founded in Washington, D.C., with Betty Friedan as its first president.\n\nHuey Newton and Bobby Seale found the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense in Oakland, California.\n\nDecember\n\nIn United States v. Jefferson County Bd. of Education, 372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), Judge Minor Wisdom orders New Orleans school districts to abandon “freedom of choice” plans that have consistently failed to desegregate schools. The court orders the city to “undo the harm” of past desegregation by racially balancing the schools, using guidelines issued by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).\n\nJune\n\nIn Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), the Supreme Court strikes down Virginia’s ban on interracial marriages. It holds that all racial classifications are to be subjected to the “most rigid scrutiny.” This test of “strict scrutiny” means that a classification is almost always unconstitutional.\n\nOn the 13th, President Johnson nominates Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court. He takes his seat in October, becoming the first African-American Justice of the Supreme Court. It turns out to be the last Supreme Court appointment the Democrats will make for 27 years.\n\nJuly\n\nRace riots erupt in cities across the country, including Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Memphis, Milwaukee, and Newark. President Johnson forms a National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (The Kerner Commission) to investigate the causes of the riots in the urban centers. The Commission issues its report on March 1, 1968, warning that the nation is rapidly moving toward two separate societies� -one black and poor, the other affluent and white. It calls for major anti-poverty efforts and strengthened civil rights enforcement to eliminate the causes of the disorders.\n\nApproximately 13% of black students in the country attend predominantly white schools. By 1980, the percentage rises to 37%. The percentage of white students attending predominantly white schools drops from 78% in 1968 to 61% in 1980.\n\nIn 1968, 64.3% of black students attend schools that are 90% minority.\n\nAlmost 85% of Southern whites and 35% of Northern whites object to sending their children to schools that are over 50% black.\n\nA group of parents in San Antonio, Texas file a suit on behalf of their children who attend schools in the Edgewood district, alleging that the Texas system of public school financing discriminates against the poor. The Edgewood districts spends $231 per student and has one of the highest tax rates in the area, while the city’s wealthiest school district, Alamo Heights, is able to spend $543 per student with a substantially lower tax rate. The Supreme Court eventually upholds the state financing scheme in 1973 in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973).\n\nApril\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. is assassinated on the 4th. Riots break out in cities all over the country.\n\nCongress passes the Fair Housing Act, also known as the Civil Rights Act of 1968, on the 10th. President Johnson signs it on the 11th. The Act makes it unlawful to refuse to sell, rent, or negotiate for the sale or rental of a dwelling because of race or religion. Only the Justice Department is authorized to enforce the Act’s provisions through lawsuits.\n\nMay\n\nIn Green v. New Kent County School Board, 391 U.S. 430 (1968), the Supreme Court holds that segregation must be dismantled “root and branch.” It rejects a freedom-of-choice plan that allowed black students to transfer to white schools because it placed the burden of desegregation on black students and preserved white- and black- identified institutions. School officials, the Court says, must “fashion steps which promise realistically to convert promptly to a system without a �white’ school and a �Negro’ school, but just schools.”\n\nJune\n\nRobert F. Kennedy is assassinated in Los Angeles on the 6th.\n\nOn the 23d, Earl Warren retires as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. President Johnson nominates Associate Justice Abe Fortas to replace Warren as Chief Justice, but Senate opposition and allegations of financial impropriety lead Johnson to withdraw the nomination in October. Fortas resigns from the Court a year later amid financial scandal. The failed nomination leaves the Republicans with two appointments and signals the end of the liberal majority on the Supreme Court. Warren Burger becomes Chief Justice in June 1969, and after two failed nomination attempts, Richard Nixon replaces Fortas with Harry Blackmun in April 1970.\n\nNovember\n\nRichard Nixon wins the Presidency, receiving 43.4 % of the vote. Democrat Hubert Humphrey wins 42.7% of the vote, and George Wallace wins 13.5% as a third party candidate. The Democrats maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. A record number of black men and women are elected to Congress.\n\nAs president, Nixon shifts the emphasis away from the cutting off of federal funds to coerce desegregation and toward Justice Department sponsored lawsuits. Throughout his presidency, Nixon repeatedly attacks busing as a remedy and states that he will do no more than the minimum required by law. He even proposes a constitutional amendment to prohibit busing to achieve racial balance in the public schools.\n\nSummer\n\nBy the summer of 1969, more than 800,000 black voters are registered in the states covered by the Voting Rights Acts. Black registration has increased from 20% of the voting age population to 56%. In Mississippi alone, 60% of the black voting-age population is registered.\n\nJune\n\nThe Stonewall riots erupt on the 27th, marking the beginning of the gay rights movement.\n\nJuly\n\nThe Department of Justice and HEW announce that strict compliance with timetables for integration will be dropped. The Nixon Administration files a motion in the Supreme Court to delay integration throughout the country. The Court denies the motion, but Nixon announces that he does not feel obligated to do any more than the minimum required by law. At Nixon’s direction, HEW Secretary Robert Finch asks the federal courts to delay desegregation measures for 33 school districts in Mississippi. A unanimous Supreme Court rejects the request in October in Alexander v. Holmes, 396 U.S. 19 (1969), unanimously declaring that Brown II’s “all deliberate speed” time frame has expired and that desegregated schools must therefore be achieved “at once.”\n\nNovember\n\nThe Nixon administration expands federal affirmative action. The Department of Labor’s Order No. 4 declares that government contractors should set their own minority hiring targets but that the targets must be equal to the “minority ratio of the local applicant population.” In February, the Department issues a revised order, requiring all government contractors to file an affirmative action program within 120 days of signing a contract.\n\nMarch\n\nIn Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), the Supreme Court holds that employment practices that have a disparate impact on black workers are illegal, even without a showing of intent to discriminate, if employers cannot demonstrate that the practice is justified by a business necessity.\n\nApril\n\nThe Supreme Court specifically endorses busing as a remedy for school desegregation in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971). The Court holds that desegregation must be achieved in each of a district’s schools to the “greatest extent possible.” In the companion case of North Carolina State Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43 (1971), the Court strikes down North Carolina’s Anti-Busing Law that prohibited making student assignments on the basis of race.\n\nJune\n\nIn Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217 (1971), the Court upholds Jackson, Mississippi’s decision to close public swimming pools after a court ordered them desegregated. The Court refuses to inquire into the motivation behind legislative action.\n\nSeptember\n\nJustices Hugo L. Black and John Marshall Harlan retire. They are replaced in January 1972 by William Rehnquist and Lewis Powell, giving Nixon four appointments to the Supreme Court in his first term.\n\nNovember\n\nIn Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), the Supreme Court strikes down an Idaho law that required that men be chosen as administrators of estates; the decision marks the beginning of modern constitutional doctrines of sex equality.\n\nMarch\n\nIn San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), the Supreme Court holds that education is not a fundamental right and that unequal school funding does not violate the Constitution. It reaffirms that classifications based on wealth are not unconstitutional. Attention now shifts to state constitutional challenges, and between 1973 and 1988 courts in Arkansas, California, Connecticut, New Jersey, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming hold unequal school financing schemes unconstitutional. In 1989, the Texas Supreme Court holds that the state’s public school financing scheme upheld in Rodriguez violates the state constitution.\n\nJune\n\nIn Keyes v. Denver School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189 (1973), the Supreme Court considers the problems of Northern metropolitan segregation for the first time, as well as the rights of Latinos to desegregated education. In the North, school segregation is often the result of demographic shifts and residential segregation rather than deliberate segregation of schools. The Court uses an elaborate series of presumptions to establish discriminatory intent and justify a remedy. Justice Powell rejects this inquiry into intention, arguing that the harm of segregation is the same whether school segregation is mandated by law (de jure segregation) or produced by other factors (de facto segregation). However, he argues that busing as a remedy should be significantly limited.\n\nIn Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455 (1973), the Supreme Court holds that Mississippi cannot lend textbooks to students attending private segregated schools.\n\nAccording to a poll by the National Opinion Research Center, black opposition to busing reaches its high point with 53% of blacks opposed.\n\nJune\n\nJudge Arthur Garrity issues an elaborate plan to desegregate Boston’s public schools, ordering the busing of 21,000 students. In response, race riots erupt in high schools in Hyde Park, Roxbury, and South Boston. Governor Francis Sargent calls in the National Guard and appeals to President Ford to send federal troops to quell the disturbances.\n\nThe violence in Boston represents the height of national tension over busing. Also in the early 1970s, dynamite explosions in Denver destroy over one-third of the city’s buses; a mob in Lamar, South Carolina attacks school buses carrying children; protesters in Pontiac, Michigan boycott the schools and firebomb buses; and in Trenton, New Jersey, race riots by students and others force the schools to close for two days.\n\nIn the same month that Boston erupts in race riots, the public swimming pools in Jackson, Mississippi are finally integrated.\n\nAccording to a Harris & Associates opinion poll, 63% of black parents and 56% of white parents say that their experience of being bused for desegregation has been “very satisfactory.”\n\nJune\n\nIn Regents of The University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), the Supreme Court confronts the growing debate over affirmative action. It strikes down a state medical school admissions policy that set aside a specific number of seats for minority candidates. Justice Powell’s opinion takes a middle position and becomes generally recognized as stating the holding of the case, even though it is joined by no other Justices. Powell holds that “benign” racial classifications are subject to the test of “strict scrutiny,” and the set-aside is unconstitutional. However, a race-conscious admissions policy that uses race as a “plus factor” in an effort to achieve “diversity” May be constitutional. As a result, the language of “diversity” becomes a key concept in the affirmative action debate.\n\nAt the behest of the Reagan administration, Congress converts the Emergency School Aid Act of 1972, which provided schools with $149 million for desegregation programs, into a block grant program for education generally. This effectively cuts off the only substantial source of federal funding for desegregation remedies. This is the largest of the many federal spending programs slashed in the first months of the Reagan Administration. However, the provision that earmarks funds for magnet schools is later restored in June of 1984.\n\nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights William Bradford Reynolds tells a congressional committee that “compulsory busing of students in order to achieve racial balance in the public schools is not an acceptable remedy.” Throughout the Reagan Administration, Reynolds makes speeches emphasizing that blacks would be better off in de facto, segregated, neighborhood schools than in integrated, non-neighborhood schools. He also speaks out repeatedly against affirmative action, arguing that colorblindness was the basic principle of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nLos Angeles becomes the first major city to abandon desegregation and to return to neighborhood schools. Between 1979 and 1993, the city receives over three billion dollars in federal and state aid to equalize resources and opportunities in minority schools.\n\nSeptember\n\nSandra Day O’Connor becomes the first woman Supreme Court Justice.\n\nThe largest twenty-five urban school districts in the country now enroll 30% of Latino students, 27% of black students, and only 3% of the white population. According to a poll conducted by the National Opinion Center, black opposition to busing falls to 38% .\n\nJanuary\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. Day is celebrated as a federal holiday for the first time.\n\nFebruary\n\nThe Fourth Circuit allows the Norfolk school district, which had been declared unitary in 1975, to dismantle its segregation plan and return to local control and neighborhood schools. Norfolk promptly ends its busing plan and creates ten almost all-black elementary schools and three disproportionately white elementary schools.\n\nMay\n\nIn Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267 (1986), the Supreme Court holds that a school board’s layoff policy that granted preferences to minority employees violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nJune\n\nPresident Reagan appoints Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court to fill the seat left vacant by Justice Burger’s resignation and appoints Justice William H. Rehnquist as Chief Justice.\n\nSegregation trends in Chicago exemplify the pattern in big cities. Of the over one million students enrolled in public schools, 30% are black, 13% are Latino, and slightly more than 50% are white. Sixty-nine percent of black students attend schools that are 90-100% minority. Sixty-three percent of white students are enrolled in schools that are 90-100% white. All but one of these schools is located in the suburbs of Chicago, and 94% of the students in the 90-100% minority schools attend schools within the Chicago city limits.\n\nMarch\n\nOn the 22nd, Congress passes the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 over President Reagan’s veto. The Act corrects a 1984 Supreme Court decision, Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984), that limited the government’s ability to withhold federal funds from institutions that discriminated on the basis of race or sex.\n\nJune\n\nIn Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Schools, 487 U.S. 450 (1988), the Supreme Court reaffirms that education is not a fundamental right.\n\nAccording to a Harris poll, 64% of whites, 63% of blacks, and 70% of Asians whose children have been bused say that the experience has been “very satisfactory.” Only 4% of blacks, 6% of whites, and 2% of Asians say the experience has been “unsatisfactory.”\n\nBetween 1989 and 1999, twenty-two challenges to school financing schemes are brought under state constitutional provisions that promise educational adequacy, in contrast to the equity challenges brought in the 1970s and 80s. Eleven state supreme courts invalidate financing schemes as inadequate and order state legislatures or school boards to craft new financing schemes includes: Alabama, Arizona, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont. Eleven other states reject the challenges: Florida, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nJune\n\nIn City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson, 488 U.S. 469 (1989), the Supreme Court holds 5-4 that state and local affirmative action plans are subject to the same strict scrutiny as deliberate discrimination against racial minorities. In effect, this makes racial affirmative action presumptively unconstitutional. The Court strikes down the City of Richmond’s plan to award minority owned businesses a certain percentage of construction contracts to help remedy the effects of past discrimination in the industry. The Court holds that remedying past societal discrimination cannot be a constitutional justification for affirmative action.\n\nIn Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Antonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989), the Supreme Court makes it more difficult for plaintiffs to win employment discrimination suits. The case generates an outcry to amend Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to overturn the decision, and Congress passes a 1990 Civil Rights Act. President Bush vetoes the bill, declaring it a “quota bill.” During the furor over the Clarence Thomas nomination in 1991, the Act is passed again, and Bush signs it into law.\n\n1991 By the 1990-1991 school year, three-fourths of the white population lives in suburban and rural areas; blacks and Latinos reside largely in urban areas. Although whites comprise 70.7% of student enrollment nationwide, only 25% of students enrolled in the nation’s largest forty-seven urban districts are white; blacks comprise 42.1% of the enrollment, and Latinos comprise 26.5%. Over 50% of students in the country’s large urban districts are eligible for a free or reduced lunch�the primary measure of student poverty. Sixty-six percent of black students are now enrolled in public schools with a more than 50% minority population. National data demonstrate that schools with a majority of minority children are dominated by poor children, but that 96% of white schools are populated by a middle-class majority.\n\nApril\n\nIn Board of Education v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237 (1991), the Supreme Court holds that courts May end desegregation orders in school districts that had attempted in good faith to comply, even if this would result in immediate resegregation.\n\nJuly\n\nJustice Thurgood Marshall retires from the Supreme Court on June 27. President Bush nominates Clarence Thomas to replace him. During his confirmation hearings, Thomas becomes embroiled in a national controversy after being accused by Anita Hill, a former employee, of sexual harassment. Despite the controversy, the Senate confirms the nomination, and Thomas takes his seat in October.\n\nAccording to Census Bureau statistics, from 1972 to 1992, the number of blacks in the public schools increased 3%, whereas the number of Latino students jumped 89%, and the enrollment of white students fell 14%.\n\nIn a Harris poll conducted for the Boston Globe, when given a choice between busing and segregation, blacks and Latinos now overwhelmingly support busing. Seventy-nine per cent of blacks support busing if there is no other way to achieve integration. Whites support busing by a 48% to 41% majority.\n\nMarch\n\nIn Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467 (1992), the Supreme Court holds that courts May release school districts from parts of desegregation orders even if they have never fully complied with other aspects.\n\nApril\n\nAfter an all-white jury acquits four Los Angeles police officers on trial for the beating of motorist Rodney King, riots erupt in South Central Los Angeles. The riots last three days, resulting in $1 billion in property damage. Fifty-one people are killed, 2000 are injured. In August, a federal grand jury indicts the officers for violating King’s civil rights. Two of the four officers are eventually convicted the following year.\n\nJune\n\nIn United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717 (1992), the Supreme Court holds that the state of Mississippi has failed to dismantle the effects of previous segregation in public colleges and universities.\n\nApproximately 95% of white Americans now support the principle of integrated education as compared to 42% in 1942. Public opinion polls reveal similar increases in white support for the integration of public accommodations and mass transportation. Nevertheless, while only 17% of whites object to sending their children to a school that is half black, 42% of whites are opposed to sending their children to a school that is majority black. In Norfolk, Virginia, a return to neighborhood schools has led to the creation of disproportionately white and black schools. In 1985, before the end of busing, 11% of Norfolk’s black students were in schools that were 75% black or more. In 1993, 41% of all black students are in predominantly black schools. In a majority of the segregated schools, more than 90% of the students are poor. In Montgomery County, Maryland, there is a dramatic increase in the percentage of students in high-poverty schools for every group but white students. From 1988 to 1993, the rate of black students in high poverty schools jumps from 11% to 25%; the rate for Latinos rises from 14% to 40%; and the rate for whites moves from just 7% to 8%. According to a United Nations report, on the Human Development Index, which is based on per capita income, educational attainment, and longevity, the United States rank sixth in the world; white Americans by themselves rank first, and African Americans by themselves rank thirty-first.\n\nJanuary\n\nOn the 24th, Thurgood Marshall dies at the age of 84. Millions of people watch the memorial service on television, and over 4000 people attend the service at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.\n\nJune\n\nIn Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993), the Supreme Court permits a challenge to a North Carolina redistricting plan designed to increase minority representation in Congress. In a series of cases following Shaw the Court eventually holds that redistricting primarily based on racial demographics is presumptively unconstitutional.\n\nOne-hundred per cent of the students in the public school systems of East St. Louis, Illinois and Compton California are minorities. Ninety-six percent of public school students in Washington, D.C. and Camden, New Jersey are minorities, along with 94% in Hartford, Connecticut and New Orleans, 93% in Los Angeles, Oakland, Atlanta, and Paterson, New Jersey, and 83% in the New York City public school system.\n\nThe median income of black households is $22,393; the median income of Latino households is $22,860; and the median income of white households is $35,766. Whereas 26.4% of black families and 27% of Latino families fall below the poverty line, only 8.5% of white families do.\n\nJune\n\nIn Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70 (1995) (Jenkins II), the Supreme Court overturns an ambitious plan for magnet schools in Kansas City designed to attract suburban white students back into the inner city. This Court argues that this goal is unjustified and unnecessary to remedy past segregation. The Court states that the primary goal of desegregation cases should be to return schools to local control. It also rejects the argument that increased spending on education could be justified in order to remedy reduced achievement by students in inner city schools. Justice Thomas concurs, arguing that the mere fact that a school has no white students does not mean that a constitutional violation has occurred. Only deliberate segregation by law violates the Constitution. He criticizes the assumption that black students suffer any psychological harm from being segregated from whites, contending that it rests upon questionable social science research and an assumption of black inferiority.\n\nIn Adarand Constructors v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), the Supreme Court overturns Metro Broadcasting. It holds that strict scrutiny must be applied to all racial classifications by the federal government � both “benign” and “invidious.”\n\nIn Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900 (1995), the Supreme Court extends Shaw v. Reno, holding that if race is the predominant factor in legislative redistricting, strict scrutiny applies.\n\nSeptember\n\nThe Denver plan that gave rise to Keyes, the first non-Southern desegregation case, is dissolved.\n\nCongress passes a sweeping welfare reform act, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. It repeals the Aid to Families With Dependent Children welfare program and creates a new program called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), a block grant system under which the states receive lump-sum payments to fund their own welfare programs.\n\nMarch\n\nIn Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals holds that the University of Texas Law School’s affirmative action program violates equal protection. It argues that Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke is no longer controlling precedent and that the University May not legally take race into account at all in admissions. In response to the Court decision, the Texas State legislature passes a bill providing that the top 10% of each high school graduating class will automatically be admitted to the the Texas public university system.\n\nSeptember\n\nOn the 14th, George Wallace dies in Birmingham, Alabama, at the age of 79.\n\nNovember\n\nCalifornia voters pass the California Civil Rights Initiative, or Proposition 209, prohibiting state affirmative action programs. In response to a dramatic decline in minority student enrollment in the California schools, the legislature adopts a 4% solution plan according to which the top 4% of every high school graduating class will be admitted to the California public university system beginning in 2001."
