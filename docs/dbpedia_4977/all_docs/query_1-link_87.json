        "text": "12. Ignorant commenters\n\nNoeh , Jerusalam (12.20.14)\n\nMost of the commenters here are so ignorant it could turn the stomach. Israel is a mostly Orthodox country among those who are religious. Orthodoxy does not recognize Conservative and Reforms and Egalitarians and all of the other nonsense. When this couple \"converted\" they chose not to convert via Orthodox on purpose. Why then should they be surprised that they are not counted in the minyan or as Jews or in cemeteries. This was the choice they made. It does not matter that they love Israel or give tseddaka or work on a kibbutz. For those who are so emotional about them, would you also support someone who really really loves his dog and wants it to be buried with him? The Orthodox wont allow that either...does that make them bad people in your eyes...very very bad.\n\n13. The last person in this world\n\nSagi (12.20.14)\n\nthat I would term as a Jew would be one with a black coat, pantaloons and white socks, tassels hanging out of his stained pants and shirt, a long unkempt beard and a cat's pelt and tail on his head. These are not Jews, they are fall outs from society, freeloaders and leeches. Jews are people who contribute to society by virtue of their profession, military service and service to the state; people who plow and sow the land and reap its harvest, people who serve a lifetime in the military and civil service, people who are doctors and lawyers etc. Not cultists who have their nose stuck in book all day long and also stuck in other people's business.\n\n19. # 11 Nick\n\nSagi (12.20.14)\n\nOf course there is no difference. You and I are normal people with a brain that is capable of rational thought, intelligent deduction and sensible conversation. Any person whose mind is poisoned by religion is completely incapable of all these and in addition to that they are totally oblivious to their surroundings. Reality for them is their self enslavement and imprisonment. The needs of others are of no consequence to them. \"God\" told them that this or that person is not a Jew and that is the end of the story, no contemplation, no second thoughts, no course of redress to a higher court, their court is the highest and their judge is supreme. The root of the verb to work in Hebrew is EVD, a slave in Hebrew is EVED, a person dedicated to \"God\" is said to be EVED ELOHIM, a slave of \"God\". That is why their brain becomes impotent, they become robots, working for \"God\" , slaves to their nonsense. The mayor of this town is normal, just like you and I.\n\n23. # 20 ORA\n\nSagi (12.21.14)\n\nWith all due respect to you ,I am not in need of an explanation as to who, what and whence came the Jews. The word Jew is the English version, or translation, of the Hebrew word, Yehudi, a person from Yehuda, a person who speaks Yehudit, as our language was correctly called. Yehuda became Judea in Latin and hence Jew in English. Please take note that I did not \"define\" a Jew as you wrote but rather I used the word \"term\". Term means to use a word to describe or to call by name or description. I would not presume to be so arrogant as the Rabbis to proclaim myself as an arbiter with sole authority to decide who is and who is not a Jew. I prefer not to term the extreme orthodox as Jews, they have hijacked the religion of Yehuda and use a bastard tongue instead of the language Yehudit and have formed a new age cult which actually goes against all that we as a people, in terms of morality, stand for.\n\n24. #21 ORA\n\nSagi (12.21.14)\n\nThe very fact that there are different cemeteries for different degrees of \"Jews\" is totally immoral and unacceptable to most normal people who think and act in life with a modicum of logic, reason and decency. Do you advocate a caste system as in India. Is it morally correct in your opinion that some people in our society have appointed themselves to adjudicate and decide who is a better Jew and who is a lesser Jew, that a child of Sephardi origin is not acceptable in an Ashkenazi institution. That a woman is a lesser being than a man and is deemed to be unclean and therefor cannot have access to certain places for fear of defiling them. These things to me, and to most others, are morally wrong and must be expunged from our society. When I walk down the street every person I pass, black, white or pink, fat or thin, male or female, Jew or otherwise is, in my eyes, first and foremost a human being. Nobody asked to be born a particular kind of Jew, a good one or a bad one, one that can be buried only in a particular type of cemetery because that person's caste, in the eyes of the self appointed adjudicators, would defile the ground in which \"good Jews\" are buried. Religion has permeated the brain cells of certain people and caused them to be irrational, just as other \"religions\" such as Communism infected people's thought processes and morality was thrown aside and chaos reigned on high. I was brought up, as a youngster, to believe that morality was the core and essence of Judaism, this concept is not prevalent in today's society in Israel in general and in the orthodox communities in particular.\n\n25. # 22 ORA\n\nSagi (12.21.14)\n\nThe Lubavitcher Rebbe was a highly educated and exceptionally intelligent person. Like many famous and infamous people in the annals of history he realized that people is a misnomer and that \"sheeple\" would be more appropriate. He formed a cult and became the leader of that cult. The fact that it is a cult is confirmed by virtue of his image in millions of photo reproductions and posters which adorn homes. offices and streets the length and breadth of Israel. L.Ron Hubbard did exactly the same thing. There was no ideology in the cult that he founded, just a desire for power, power over others and a good way of making a living. Joseph Smith did exactly the same thing when he founded Mormonism, he was a charlatan with diplomas and credentials, but he controlled the \"sheeple\", he had power, he made money. Shnearson decreed that he should have no successor. Do you understand the reasoning behind this decree. Me, Shnearson am the one and only forever and ever, amen. Thou shallt not make a graven image, a basic tenet of Judaism. Shnearson and his flock certainly defy this commandment. I wonder why ? Don't answer that Ora, it was a rhetorical question. I have told you before that you are naive and like most naive people you are basically a good person, always looking for the middle road, a compromise, acceptable to both sides. My own personal way in life is to have a backbone and determination, to fight for what is right and oppose what is wrong.I have said to you before, I do not hate, I divide into right and wrong according to the law of the land and to principles of morality as laid down by the society in which I reside. The extreme orthodox are errant on both these accounts. I wish you well and certainly no harm, just try and reason with a little more depth."
