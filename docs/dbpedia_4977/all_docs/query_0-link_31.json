        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Na/K-ATPase was discovered over 60 years ago as the membrane-bound protein complex that catalyzes the active transport of K+ into and Na+ out of the cell, thereby maintaining the resting membrane potential and excitability. The minimal functional Na/K-ATPase unit is made up of two subunits, α and β. The α-subunit is the catalytic subunit and bears the binding sites for ATP, ions, and cardiotonic steroids (CTS; 9). In addition to the ubiquitously present α1, three isoforms of the catalytic subunit have been characterized. Na/K-ATPase α2 is found mainly in muscle, adipose, and glial cells, α3 is found mainly in neurons, and α4 expression is restricted to sperm (9). This highly tissue-specific expression pattern and isoform-specific response to both physiological and pathological stimuli have long suggested that they must be serving tissue-specific functions.\n\nOver the last 15 years, we and others have reported that Na/K-ATPase α1 serves important scaffolding and signaling functions in addition to its role as an ion pump (9). Specifically, α1 can interact with and modulate Src activity, which in turn affects EGF receptors through transactivation. This subsequently adjusts the assembly and activation levels of multiple protein/lipid kinases as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species and other intracellular messengers, allowing endogenous CTS to regulate cell growth (e.g., kidney development; 15, 16, 19, 27, 44). On the other hand, sustained and dysregulated activation of this signaling mechanism causes reactive oxygen species stress and pathological remodeling in the heart and kidneys (31, 49, 51).\n\nIn the skeletal muscle, the role of the ion-pumping function of the dominant α2-isoform in maintaining the membrane potential during contraction has been studied extensively (13, 21, 22, 32, 41, 42). Additionally, Radzyukevich et al. have described an improvement in exercise performance in mice expressing a ouabain-resistant mutant α2-isoform, suggesting a role of endogenous CTS in the regulation of muscle contraction via the α2-isoform (41). Interestingly, expression of ouabain-resistant α2 or even α2 knockout did not affect skeletal muscle mass (13, 32, 41, 42). In a renal epithelial cell knockdown and rescue system, we have obtained evidence that the α1-isoform is important for cell growth and that rescue with α2 restores ion-pumping capacity but does not restore growth or Src-dependent signal transduction in response to ouabain binding at concentrations too low to impair enzymatic activity (50). Taken together, the apparent lack of impact of α2 in skeletal muscle mass in genetic mouse models and the inability to support cell growth in the absence of α1 in vitro are consistent with a model whereby α1, but not α2, plays a role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass. To test this model, we investigated the impact of α1 reduction on muscle mass in Na/K-ATPase α1-haplodeficient mice (α1+/−) and control littermates (α1+/+). This mouse model has been previously used to examine α1- and α2-isoform-specific functions in the heart (24, 34, 35) and the skeletal muscle (21). Whereas the latter study specifically focused on the glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle and the respective roles of α1 and α2 in the maintenance of ion homeostasis during contraction, we extended our search for a trophic role of α1 to the three muscle types (oxidative, mixed, and glycolytic).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nBased on our observations in renal epithelial cell lines, Na/K-ATPase α1 possesses isoform-specific functions that are not supported by α2, which results in a sizable effect on cell growth rate (50). Since renal epithelial cells do not normally express Na/K-ATPase α2, we took the next step of investigating this issue in a tissue expressing both isoforms. We focused on the skeletal muscle, a tissue where α2 expression uniquely predominates over the minor α1-isoform and with a regenerative process that occurs throughout life. Specifically, we used the Na/K-ATPase α1+/− mouse model to investigate whether a downregulation of the minor pool of Na/K-ATPase α1 expressed in skeletal muscle could affect muscle mass. The data indicate that a 30–40% decrease of Na/K-ATPase α1 protein expression, which does not noticeably decrease total maximum Na/K-ATPase capacity of the muscle, induces a modest yet significant decrease of 10% in the mass of the oxidative soleus ( ). In contrast, the mass of the glycolytic EDL was not affected, nor was that of the mixed-type muscle plantaris ( ). The very low level of α1 expression in the EDL and the plantaris compared with the soleus may explain this intriguing muscle type-specific effect. Indeed, as shown in and consistent with previous studies in rats by Thompson and McDonough (43) and others (10, 20), the oxidative soleus expresses substantially more α1 than the glycolytic EDL in wild-type mice. Moreover, when the Western blot analysis was extended to additional representative muscles of each type, a positive correlation between α1 content and oxidative metabolism was observed, suggesting that the role of α1 could be particularly important in oxidative fibers. Mechanistically, we speculate that endogenous CTS signaling through α1 may have a role in maintaining the growth of the soleus and the lack of this ouabain signaling could be responsible for the reduced soleus mass in α1+/− mice ( ). It should be noted that the mouse α1-isoform has a much lower affinity for ouabain than α2 and only 0.05% of the α1-isoform is bound to ouabain at the reported endogenous ouabain concentrations (5, 37). However, through amplification of signaling cascades, concentrations of ouabain comparable to circulating endogenous ouabain can activate signaling in cells and tissue expressing such low-affinity α1 (4, 15, 16, 19). In contrast, pumping inhibition is directly related to the number of pumps bound to ouabain, which means that signaling could have a long-lasting impact at concentrations too low to affect the membrane potential or ion homeostasis. Although this remains to be specifically tested, a plausible model is that the higher expression level of α1 in the soleus enables endogenous CTS-stimulated signaling, as seen in other cell lines and tissue types (4, 12, 19, 27, 44). Consistent with our observation that a 50% reduction in α1 expression prevents ouabain from stimulating signaling and growth in renal epithelial cells (44), α1 expression in the EDL (6% of soleus) or plantaris (23% of soleus) may not allow CTS-stimulated growth through stimulation of Na/K-ATPase α1 signaling. Although signaling of the CTS ouabain through Na/K-ATPase α1 modulates glycogen synthesis through GSK-3β signaling in skeletal muscle cells (28) and may therefore lead to a change in size, growth, and differentiation in the soleus of α1+/− mice (1, 30, 45, 46), we did not detect a significant change in the 6-mo-old mouse ( ). This result certainly warrants further investigation, as a dysregulation of GSK-3β may have occurred at an earlier time point and/or may only be discernible under agonist stimulation.\n\nSkeletal muscle-specific ablation of Na/K-ATPase α2 does not affect muscle mass (13, 32, 42), which suggests that the observed decrease in soleus mass in α1+/− is likely unrelated to altered ion-pumping capacity of the cell. Consistently, we did not detect any significant decrease in Na/K-ATPase activity in crude membrane preparations from α1+/− muscles. Based on an α1 contribution of ~15% of total skeletal muscle Na/K-ATPase (21) and a decrease of ~40% of α1 in the α1+/− skeletal muscle, the expected decrease in Na/K-ATPase activity would have been minimal (~6%) and may have remained below the limit of detection of the assay (22, 23, 47). On the other hand, it is well established that most cells have a large reserve pump capacity and that a decrease in the number of Na/K-ATPase expressed at the cell membrane can be compensated by either a substrate-mediated stimulation of existing pumps or a mobilization of the reserve pump pool (2, 3). Finally, although we consider it unlikely because a decreased myofiber diameter as observed in α1+/− muscles is not expected as a secondary adjustment for optimization of ion-pumping capacity and maintenance of the membrane potential [in fact, fibers with larger rather than smaller diameters require significantly less energy to maintain their membrane potential (25, 26)], it should be noted that a change in Na/K-ATPase ion transport activity secondary to α1 depletion has not been specifically excluded in this study.\n\nThis model of a change in muscle mass related to α1-specific signaling function is also consistent with the concept of distinct and specific roles for α1 and α2 in skeletal muscle initially suggested by He et al. Indeed, the authors first proposed that α1 is primarily responsible for establishing a baseline membrane potential and α2 maintains the membrane potential during contraction (21). This role for α2 was subsequently confirmed by a series of studies using skeletal muscle-specific ablation of α2 in mice. In those studies, muscle mass of both EDL and soleus was unchanged, but maintenance of the membrane potential during contraction was severely impaired because of an inability to clear the excitation-dependent increase in extracellular [K+] (13, 32, 42). Taken together, those studies and the results presented here support a model where skeletal muscle α2 has an isoform-specific role in the maintenance of membrane potential during contraction related to its enzymatic activity, whereas α1 has, in addition to its transport function, an isoform-specific role in growth that is independent of its ion-pumping activity.\n\nAlthough the effect of α1-haplodeficiency on muscle growth may seem modest at first, it is important to note that it is relevant to reported models of skeletal muscle atrophy. The soleus-specific decrease in muscle mass, accompanied by a reduction of fiber size but not fiber number, is a feature of disuse-induced atrophy induced by hind limb suspension (18, 29). Although this decrease in size is relatively minor compared with some forms of atrophy, it is comparable to the 10–15% decrease in gastrocnemius mass in burn cachexia reported by Pedroso et al. (38). Similarly, the commonly used subcutaneous inoculation model of cancer cachexia consistently decreases muscle mass by 6–15% (11, 33, 36, 48). As may have been expected with a relatively modest decrease, the α1+/− mouse model does not present with major metabolic abnormalities in basal conditions ( ). Perhaps more surprising is the lack of defects in exercise capacity ( ), given that He et al. found that the tetanic force of isolated α1+/− EDL muscles is decreased in vitro (21). This apparent discrepancy is likely due to the global haplodeficiency of the α1+/− mouse model, which affects other systems involved in exercise, including the nervous, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems.\n\nClearly, inherent limitations due to global and incomplete reduction of Na/K-ATPase α1 in the α1+/− model warrant future studies in a skeletal muscle-specific model. Although such a model seems required to fully assess the scope and significance of the proposed new isoform-specific trophic role for Na/K-ATPase α1 in the skeletal muscle, several important conclusions can be drawn from the present study. First, the α1-specific trophic role observed in vitro is relevant in vivo. Second, manipulation of Na/K-ATPase α1 content leads to morphological changes in the skeletal muscle that do not impact maximal running capacity, in contrast to manipulation of α2, which did not affect muscle size but affected running capacity. These lend further support for the concept that Na/K-ATPase α1 and α2 serve distinct and isoform-specific functions in the skeletal muscle. Finally, the findings presented here suggest a novel mechanism for exercise-induced changes in muscle size and metabolism. Physiologically, exercise increases serum concentrations of endogenous Na/K-ATPase ligands such as ouabain and leads to modifications of skeletal muscle structure and function (5, 17). Alteration of muscle activity during exercise through modulation of α2 by endogenous Na/K-ATPase ligands has been demonstrated (41), and the present study now suggests that they may also modulate changes in oxidative skeletal muscle structure in response to exercise training through the modulation of α1 signaling. These new findings suggest a possible impact of endogenous or pharmacological administration of CTS on muscle growth, which could be further investigated using the established mouse line expressing ouabain-sensitive α1 (14)."
