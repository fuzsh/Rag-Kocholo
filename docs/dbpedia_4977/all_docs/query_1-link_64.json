        "text": "The St. George’s College staff and community celebrate the Easter pilgrimage of the The Most Rev. Michael B. Curry, Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church.\n\nDuring the pilgrimage, the Presiding Bishop visited institutions of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem accompanied by Archbishop Suheil, his staff and members of St. George’s College community. Palm Sunday the local Palestinian Christian community were blessed with Curry’s message and celebration of the Holy Eucharist. Curry reminded the congregation in his Palm Sunday message when reflecting on Jesus’ life, death and resurrection, we must remember that Jesus is alive as the hymn proclaims and this gives us hope,” Because He lives I can face tomorrow.” His full sermon may be found here https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org\n\nThe pilgrimage included visits to sacred sites in and around Jerusalem and paying respect in a private visit the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Jordan and the Patriarchal Commission to Bethlehem, Theophylaktos, and His Beatitude Theopholis III, Patriarch of the Holy City of Jerusalem and All Palestine, who called the Presiding Bishop Curry, ” our brother,” and presented him with an engolpion. A day trip to Nazareth included conversations with students at Christ School as well as Palestinian students involved in https://www.jerusalempeacebuilders.org who shared with the Presiding Bishop the impact this interfaith program has on their lives and hope for peace in this land.\n\nPresiding Bishop Curry spent an early morning visit to St. George’s College with Acting Dean the Rev. Canon Richard LeSueur, and the Rev. Dr. Susan Lukens, Associate Dean. Accompanied by the Rev. Canon Chuck Roberston, Chuck reminisced about his own memories at the college whilst he spent time here on a pilgrimage study course. Susan explained to the Presiding Bishop that nearly 80% of the pilgrims enrolling at the St. George’s College for a course are from North America, so the visit of the Presiding Bishop was one of gratitude for such sustaining support and lasting friendships with both lay and clergy from the Episcopal Church.\n\nThe Presiding Bishop’s parting reflection renewed hope for the people in this land:\n\nAs we pray for the peace of Jerusalem, as the Bible teaches us, we must find ways to work for the peace of Jerusalem, which will be found where there is true equality for all, true justice for all and true freedom for everyone. Here it is clear that this is not simply an idealistic dream. It is the only hope, and we must not rest until it is realized. ( Episcopal News Service March 29, 2018)\n\nThe St. George’s College staff and Cathedral close community will long remember the affection and care from the Presiding Bishop and his staff; their admiration for this land of the Holy One and the pilgrimages provided by the college blessed our mission.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nWe are grateful for the contribution of writings from the Episcopal News Service, The Rev. Mary Frances Schjonberg Interim Managing Editor and the photo is attributed to Sharon Jones, Executive Coordinator to the Presiding Bishop and Primate.\n\nThe St. George’s College staff and community mourns the loss of the former Dean of St. George’s College, the Revd. Canon Dr. John Wilkinson, who passed away on January 13.\n\nJohn began his career at St. George’s College in 1961 as a tutor and subsequently became Dean of the college from 1969-1974.\n\nDuring his tenure at St. George’s College, John designed short courses and his format is still experienced today whereby our students visit holy sites, engage in theological reflection and experience worship and fellowship with the local Palestinian Christians. The Rev. Dr. Stephen Need, former dean of the College from 2005-2011, reflected on the significant contribution of Revd. Wilkinson, calling John the “founding father of St. George’s College. His scholarship and love of Jerusalem and the Holy Land were legendary.” Stephen Need wrote:\n\nDuring my time as Dean of St. George’s College when traveling around the land and in the Sinai with groups, John’s name would come up frequently because he had translated the famous Egeria’s Travels to the Holy Land (1971) and numerous other texts published in “Jerusalem Pilgrims Before the Crusades,” (1977) and “Jerusalem Pilgrimage 1099-1185 (1988). ”\n\nIn addition to his Biblical scholarship and teaching excellence, John played a key role in supervising the construction and design of the college building that is used today. The cornerstone visible on the eastern facade of the building was designed and installed by John in 1962.\n\nBesides his legacy in the role of Dean and leader within the St. George’s Cathedral close community, Revd. Wilkinson was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of London and the Courtauld Institute of Art for his research dissertation entitled, “ Interpretations of Church Buildings before 750.” Whilst serving as Dean and in the subsequent years when he frequented Jerusalem, becoming the Director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, John was still a familiar presence in the worshipping life of the cathedral close; Revd. Wilkinson became a canon of St. George’s Cathedral in 1973.\n\nRecently while visiting the cathedral close, The Revd. Canon John L Peterson, dean of St. George’s College from 1983-1994, reflected on the legacy of John Wilkinson at the college:\n\nWithout a doubt, it was Canon John Wilkinson’s vision that laid the foundation on which St. George’s College is built today. For those of us who knew John, we knew him as a scholar, educator and a dedicated priest who cared deeply about giving clergy and laity a profound appreciation for the bible, the land, the historic churches and the peoples of the land. Thank you John for being an inspiration to all the Deans (as well as College staff and course members) who have followed you.\n\nThe Revd. Canon Dr. John Wilkinson was preceded in death by his first wife, Alexandria McFarlane, and is survived by his widow, Mzia; the St. George’s College staff and community send our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends. John’s impact on the college academics, leadership and affection for the local Christian community will be remembered with admiration and gratitude for his years of ministry herein.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nWe are grateful for the contributions of the following former deans and their permission to include them in this memoriam.\n\nThe Revd. Dr. Stephen Need and The Revd. Canon John L. Peterson.\n\nPhoto from Church Times, 16 Feb. 2018.\n\nDear Alumni and Friends,\n\nOur college has been filled with pilgrims and special guests in May.\n\nThe students pictured above enjoyed time with our college Patron, The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. It was a blessing to have his presence along with his wife, Caroline and the Archbishop’s staff.\n\nIn May, we celebrate that Archbishop Suheil Dawani is now President Bishop of the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East. We are proud of this honor and expect his leadership to bring peace to the region.\n\nAnd finally, in May, we celebrate the announcement below of the new college interim Dean, the Rev. Dr. Richard LeSueur. Richard will arrive at the college October 1 and assume leadership along with his support staff, Course Director, the Rev. Dr. Hector Patmore and the Associate Dean the Rev. Dr. Susan Lukens. The official press release appears below.\n\nWe ask for your prayers and continue to keep you in ours,\n\nSusan\n\nAssociate Dean\n\nNew Interim Dean: St George’s College, The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem\n\nSt George’s College Jerusalem is delighted to announce the appointment of Canon Dr Richard LeSueur as interim Dean from 1st October.\n\nCanon Dr. Richard LeSueur has served for 38 years as a priest of the Anglican Church of Canada. He served at St. George’s College, Jerusalem for a period in the 1990’s as the Director of the Desert Program. Over the past 25 years he has facilitated or participated in more than 40 excursions for clergy and laity through the biblical lands. He serves as adjunct faculty with Trinity Divinity College, University of Toronto. He is currently the Middle East Liaison for the Anglican Church of Canada. He and his wife, Rhonde have two grown sons.\n\nPlease pray for Richard, Ronde, his wife, their family and all at the College as Richard and Ronde prepare to travel to Jerusalem and take up this important role. And please pray for the Peace of Jerusalem.\n\nThe Rev’d Canon David Longe\n\nChaplain to The Anglican Archbishop in Jerusalem, The Most Reverend Suheil Dawani\n\nOur June Women of the Bible course started today, and we welcome pilgrims from the United States who will follow the footsteps of women whose narratives are written in Holy Scripture as well as have conversation with the living stones here in the holy land. Pictured above are the students at Mt. Scopus with Course Director Hector Patmore and Liaison and Logistics Officer Bishara Khoury giving a hands on description of the scenic view covering the Kidron Valley, the Golden gates of the Old City, and the sacred sites within her walls.\n\nPlease consider joining next year’s program June 5 – 14, 2018. Visit our website for details.\n\nTexan friends of North American Committee member, The Very Revd. Barkley Thompson, welcomed in the Deanery at St. George’s College\n\nDear Alumni, Friends, and future Pilgrims,\n\nMarch has been a month of both new and renewed friendships at St. George’s College- living out our mission to be a place in Jerusalem that can be a home to all those who enter our gates.\n\nfor I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in; ( Matthew 25:35)\n\nRenewed visits with Nick Porter, Jerusalem Peace Builders, and his co-chair, Stuart Kensinger, included a day at the Herodium after their important work bringing MD Anderson Cancer teaching conversation to the people of Gaza, 8 Houstonians arrived for evening prayer- and we followed this with drinks at the deanery to celebrate new friendships! And on a personal note- my fellow Virginia Theological Seminary alums- Regina and Lark from California surprised me with a dinner night out and of course conversation about returning to St. George’s College with a group of their students! Our college community has welcomed Palestinian theologian, Naim Ateek, as a resident scholar, for several months. ( see below for more details). And our March course welcomed British and Canadian chaplains whose laughter amid serious theological discourse ended with a meal together celebrating the beauty of fellowship in gathered community.\n\nWendy, a Floridian here a few weeks ago for the Palestine of Jesus course, reflected about the welcoming presence that St. George’s College and Cathedral Close provide for all who enter, whether you are here for the first time or returning for rest and renewal.\n\nAlthough I have only been here 2 weeks, in my own small way, I feel passionate about St. George’s too. You have an incredibly wonderful facility with a beautiful church, remarkable library, fine accomodations, beautiful gardens- all together in a marveous cloister like environment.\n\nI need not tell you that it feels like Holy Ground here—and all in Jerusalem- how fabulous!!\n\nWelcoming is hospitality and this is how we authentically live into our St. George’s College mission; by making St. George’s your home, the theology of place and the sacredness of this land come together herein. It is amazing how within just a few days, course members become family and a community is born in the midst of prayer at Capernaum, song at St. Anne’s Church, and morning Eucharist shared in the Cathedral chapel.\n\nAs we approach the end of Lent and begin our Easter vigil, I know that most of you reading this newsletter are alums who have walked the Way of the Cross. Those memories will hopefully begin to nourish you in the days to come. Are you with Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane? Are you with Joseph from Arimathea asking Pilate for the body of Jesus or are you with Mary Magdalene crying outside the tomb? I am in Bethany helping to find the donkey to carry our Lord.\n\nWhoever you are in the Easter story, our prayers are with you at the foot of the cross for the healing nourishing love of Christ.\n\nOn behalf of the entire St. George’s College staff, I send you many blessings from all of us who do feel “passionate about the college,” and thank all of you for feeling the same way.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Susan Ackley Lukens\n\nAssociate Dean\n\nSt. George’s College\n\nassociatedean@sgcjerusalem.org\n\nIn the News\n\nMarch 27 through 30, St. Georges College hosted the Mission Theology Conference under the direction of Bishop Graham Kings, Mission Theologian for the Anglican Communion. and Dr. Muthuraj Swamy, Associate Professor in Theology and Religion from Pune, India.

Recently re- reading the reflections from February, I was struck by the beautiful imagery of one anonymous writing; I have used it almost like Lectio Divina for the past few days.\n\n“ This was an experience of a life time. I felt welcomed, secure, nourished and wrapped in the arms of Christ. “\n\nAs we enter the season of Lent, may these forty days of prayer and fasting bring us closer to such a Grace-filled encounter with the living Christ. My hope is that his infinite love can continue to strengthen us, embrace us during life’s journey for our own selves and for how we might better serve our neighbor.\n\nIt is my privilege to welcome all pilgrims who come to St. George’s College and together with the staff lead you to the sacred spaces where the Holy Spirit dwells- to be “wrapped in the arms of Christ.”\n\nIn the friendship of Christ,\n\nSusan+\n\nAssociate Dean\n\nSt. George’s College\n\nExciting News to Share\n\nMarch Madness begins today… We are offering two very important promotions in hopes that you and your friends will enroll in a course at St. George’s College.\n\nThe college will extend a 10% discount on program fees if you register by April 15, 2017, for a course offered in 2017.

Inshallah- we will see you soon at the college and welcome you to our community once again for a transformational faith journey in the Land of the Holy One.\n\nhttps://www.saintgeorgescollegejerusalem.com\n\nmailto:associatedean@sgcjerusalem.org\n\nregistrar@sgcjerusalem.org\n\nFebruary Course Highlights\n\nDirector of Studies, the Revd. Dr. Hector Patmore, along with our college Chaplain, the Revd. John Reese and Bishara Khoury, Liaison and Logistics Officer, took our February group atop the ancient fortress of Masada. Riding a camel was an unexpected addition to the day spent in desert places.\n\nOur course “ Palestine of Jesus- the Spirituality of Lent, “ is underway as you receive this newsletter. Hazel Reese, our chaplain’s wife, shared a reflection with me about the Shrove Tuesday festivities at the Guest House with students and the St. George’s Cathedral community. “We have a lovely group in now (mainly Canadian Military Chaplains) and have just come back from pancake races and a tea party organised by David Longe.[ Archbishop Suheil’s chaplain] Not long ‘til dinner if any of us has room for it!” Never underestimate the good food of our Chef Joseph and having fun whilst being a pilgrim in the Holy Land.\n\nFebruary Alumni Reconnections\n\nFebruary has been a very celebratory month of alumni reconnections and celebrations across the United States for the Associate Dean! I drove over 800 miles and crisscrossed airspace from Philly to North Carolina, down to Houston and back to Washington DC. The month began with preaching and teaching in Lancaster Pennsylvania with alumni who attended the Women of the Bible Course. Nestled in the bucolic hills of Amish country, it was a warm and fun filled reunion. However, this was my first time in over a decade driving in snow- and I survived thanks to Helen leading me out of town through the maze of traffic, snow flurries and pointing the way to Interstate 76! Thank you Helen!\n\nWilmington alumni welcomed me for a forum at Christ Church where one of the alumni brought a scrapbook about her pilgrimage at St. George’s College in 1993. What a walk down memory lane we shared together! Thank you Matilda Maassen, class of 1993!\n\nMatilda SGC Class of 1993\n\nOur Presbyterian alumni from First and Central in downtown Wilmington welcomed me with a packed forum in anticipation of their return trip to SGC in 2018. This will be the Rev. Dr. Doug Gerdts 3rd trip to St. George’s College, and the Rev. Kaci Clark-Porter’s 2nd pilgrimage… now that is love and friendship!\n\nBetween out of town speaking engagements, my home base was Virginia Theological Seminary courtesy of Dean Ian Markham and his wife, Lesley. Seeing 3 classes of SGC alumni who are current VTS seminarians defined my daily happiness- chapel worship, refectory meals together, and evening class audits engaged in theological debate. More alumni and new friends were made at the CEEP conference where St. George’s College had an event table. Thank you Virginia Theological Seminary for opening your community to me; I leave with immense gratitude for the partnership you share with St. George’s College.\n\nI returned home to Houston’s Christ Church Cathedral where my homily began with the requisite nourishment of Tex-Mex queso! Rev. Barkley has just joined the North American Committee, and I look forward to partnership in creative ways we might bring more Texans to St. George’s College in the near future.\n\nAs I prepare to return to Jerusalem, my heart is filled with gratitude for meeting so many alumni in their home churches, sharing meals, prayer and laughter together. These days nourished me and you made me feel “ wrapped in the arms of Christ.” I am very grateful to all the people that helped organize my visits and shaped the time I spent with you.\n\nLooking Ahead to March\n\nWe have a very special program at the college in March:\n\nThe Mission Theology in the Anglican Communion Conference in Jerusalem at St. George’s College\n\nThe Right Revd. Graham Kings, from the U.K. and Dr. Muthuraj Swamy from India, will host the event at St. George’s College with morning 3 hour webinar sessions Monday, March 27 thru Thursday, March 30. Participants from Nairobi, Abuja, Uganda, Kenya, Egypt, Turkey, Japan, Brazil and Myanmar will join together in engaged conversation and shared writings.\n\nPlease email the Associate Dean for any additional information. associatedean@scgjerusalem.org\n\nWelcoming Pilgrims from Ghana\n\nOur staff is looking forward to welcoming 19 pilgrims from Ghana who will be participating in the March Introduction to Bible Lands course. They will bring great insight to our community and strengthen our faith journey that we all share in Christ. Welcome! Karibu!\n\nNorth American Committee Meeting\n\nSt. George’s College could not exist with out the sustaining support of the alumni and friends of the college and those that volunteer their time to serve on the North American Committee. It is through this network of friendships and countless volunteer hours that our college leadership is strengthened by wisdom from these committee members.The NAC members traveling or skyping in from various places across America and Canada, will be hosted at Virginia Theological Seminary March 2 and 3. We are grateful for this committee and the vision they continue to provide for the college. Thank you for scheduling this meeting during a time when the Associate Dean can attend in person.\n\nLenten Prayers\n\nMy good friend Rev. Grey Maggiano spoke yesterday about Lent, and he posited that the season might include forty days of “ repairing our relationship… develop and strengthen our relationship with God and our neighbor.” The staff of St. George’s College and the Cathedral Close will keep those wishes and you in our prayers during this Holy season. May you also pray for us that peace can find a home in our worlds and let all people be “ wrapped in the arms of Christ.”\n\nOn behalf of the St. George’s College Staff for whom I have the honor to serve,\n\nSusan+\n\nThe great challenge—and the immense privilege—of leading courses at St George’s College Jerusalem is the necessity to tie together threads that we might easily leave as loose ends, or even ignore, because it can be hard to bring them all together.\n\nWhat are these threads that we seek to weave together? Four words come to mind, and each of them is the tip of an iceberg:\n\nHistory\n\nScripture\n\nPlace\n\nPeople\n\nAs I reflect on those four strands, I am reminded of the summary of the Law that Jesus offers in each of the Synoptic Gospels. Here is the earliest version, found in Mark 12:30:\n\nYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. (NRSV)\n\nJesus edits the original form found in Deuteronomy my adding “with all your mind”, and I appreciate that as an essential element of every program we offer at St George’s College. In every course we seek to love God with all our mind, as well as with heart and soul and strength. Indeed, I would hope that we engage all four dimensions (heart, soul, mind, strength) with each of the threads (history, scripture, place, and people).\n\nNot every pilgrimage program will seek to do that. Not every study tour will seek to do that. Not every advocacy visit will seek to do that. But here at St George’s College we seek to do all this every time.\n\nNot every SGC course gets every element just right, but a lot of the time we get most of the parts right, and occasionally everything comes together beautifully. I think we have had several of those courses in the past three months, and that is a deep joy. These are the times that encourage us to keep going, and to try harder for the sake of our pilgrims, for the sake of our students, for the sake of the living stones in this land, and for the sake of God’s kingdom.\n\nHistory\n\nAs a center for Christian study and faith formation, we need to engage with the historical dimensions of this land and of our religion.\n\nHistory matters, and especially for a religion that understands God to have come among us in the person of Jesus: a unique person, at a particular time, and in specific places.\n\nWe have come to realise that Christianity includes a mix of historical and other traditions. And we know all too well that some Christians consider everything to be historical, while other Christians do not see their faith that way. The College exists for them all, but has a responsibility to be a place where we seek to love God by our critical thinking: “with all our mind”.\n\nWe are not primarily an academic institution, but we are a place of rigorous discipleship and careful thinking. As one of my theology lecturers said in a class many years ago, “Form your ideas carefully, and sit on them lightly.”\n\nWe address the questions that arise from the texts and the places. Sometimes we find answers. Always we seek wisdom to live by. Holy wisdom. Faith seeking understanding. Love of God that is not afraid to ask questions, to live with doubt, and to be faithful to God’s call on our lives.\n\nScripture\n\nWe are quintessentially the ‘people of the Book’. From its first moments, the Christian community has been blessed with the gift of Scripture.\n\nAt first those Scriptures were the sacred texts of Second Temple Judaism, which are not exactly the same as the Jewish Tanak or the Protestant Old Testament. The Christian Old Testament includes all the books of the Tanak (albeit arranged in different categories and sequences) along with another dozen or so writings that are found in the Greek Bible but were excluded from the Jewish Tanak after 100 CE.\n\nLater these Jewish texts were supplemented by the Gospel and the Apostle: the message and mission of Jesus, and the pastoral wisdom of Paul, Peter, James, and John.\n\nWe engage with these sacred texts as people of faith. We are neither fundamentalists or literalists, but people who know of God’s work in our lives and in our world. We receive these sacred texts in the contexts of our contemporary reality. We read the texts to hear the whisper of God’s Spirit, and not to find proof texts to validate or deny our sense of God’s call in today’s world.\n\nWe are the people of the Book, but we are first of all the people of God, and the people of Christ. By the end of every College course our knowledge of the Bible should have been increased, along with our love for God, and our capacity for mission.\n\nPlace\n\nIn our programs at St George’s College we seek to engage with the land, with the ‘fifth gospel’.\n\nWe want you to touch this land, to see the landscape, to feel the wind, to splash in the water, to smell the flowers, and to walk among the rocks.\n\nThis land is the place where our faith first took shape.\n\nThis land is a sacrament that connects us with the sacred—with that kingdom of God that is amongst us and within us, yet which we so easily overlook in the busy schedules that pass for lives in today’s world.\n\nWe want you to learn how to read the stones and interpret the hills. We want you out of the lecture room, off the bus, and into the field. We want you to stay long enough to get a feel for the place. More than that, we want you to appreciate the God whose call still echoes in the contours of this land.\n\nPeople\n\nThere is more to our programs than history, Bible and land.\n\nWe want you to meet the ‘living stones’, the people of this land. Some of them are Christians, others are Jews and Muslims. A few may be Baha’i or Druze.\n\nWhere there are people, we also find politics, injustice, and compassion. It is impossible to travel this land as pilgrim or student and avoid the politics. The injustices of this land may open our eyes to injustices at home to which we were previously blind. For sure a deep engagement with the people of this land will stir our compassion. Maybe it will also offer a glimpse of some new work to which God is calling us.\n\nNot every visitor to the land of the Holy One will be seeking such a comprehensive and challenging engagement. But this is the mission of the College. To be more than a devotional pilgrimage. To be more than a study tour. To be something other than an advocacy visit.\n\nAs a mission agency of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, we welcome you to our programs and we offer to be your companions on the journey as we dig deep into the history of the land, as we engage with the Christian Scriptures, as we learn the contours of this land, and as we encounter the people of this ‘once and future’ promised land.\n\nAs this newsletter goes out the Division and Hope program will be commencing its final day. This course is a joint program with the Anglican Centre in Rome, and it has been a powerful experience for everyone: participants and presenters.\n\nAs our second last day draws to a close and I sit to reflect on the insights we have been offered, many of our family and friends will be observing Halloween. This was no ‘trick or treat’ day for us, although it had its share of horrors and blessings.\n\nWe began the day with an extended visit to the Caritas center here in Amman, spending more than an hour with a small group of Iraqi refugees. These Christians from villages near Mosul shared their stories of tragedies that compelled them to leave their homes. They spoke of the horrors that have befallen their families. They shared their dream of a new life in Australia or some other place of assylum far from the violences that has torn up their lives. They asked us what the churches were doing to help them.\n\nTo protect them and their families, no photos will be posted here. Suffice to say we left with deep respect for their courage and their faith, and immense sadness at the tragedies that have engulfed them. And some anger at the bureaucratic processes that delay their dream of a new life and seem not to see them as people. They were real people for us this morning, and they have challenged us to act for their sakes and the sake of the millions more like them.\n\nThe photo that follows is from another event a little later in the day, when we meet with local Christian leaders at the Royal Institute for Inter-Faith Studies in Amman.\n\nHere we met not with refugees but with local Christian leaders, who spoke with one voice about the destruction inflicted on the communities of the Middle East by the colonial and military adventures of Europe. As one priest said most eloquently: “Take our money. Take our oil. Just leave us in peace, and stop sending your weapons here.”\n\nAfter dinner we met with the Rev. Dr. Khalid Freij and his wife, Rana. They spoke about the work of the Christian community in Jordan, and especially the Anglican Church here. They described the good relations between Muslims and Christians, and the impact on everyone from the violence in the region. We were blessed to hear something of their mission as a Christian couple engaged in God’s work together, and we sensed the hope they offer to the people they serve.\n\nOne deep conviction emerging from this course, and especially coming directly after the Living Stones course that concluded the day before this one commenced, is that the College needs to strengthen its involvement in the ministry of reconciliation. That will be a serious challenge for us, but it is one to which I am committed as Dean."
