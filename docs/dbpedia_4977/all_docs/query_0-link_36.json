She was introduced with Countertechnique during her studies at Codarts/Rotterdam Dance Academy in 2010 and attended the One Body One Career intensive in 2018, 2019 and 2020 before successfully attending the Countertechnique Teacher Training Program in 2020.\n\nMarina has been a professional dancer since 2013. After an apprenticeship at Scapino Ballet Rotterdam, Marina lived in New York working with Nimbus Dance Works. Since 2017, Marina is a company dancer at De Châtel Sur Place in Amsterdam, directed by choreographer Krisztina de Châtel. In New York Marina fell in love with teaching and became a certified Pilates teacher in 2014.\n\n“Countertechnique fascinated me from the very first class I took because of the way it made me feel. At that time I didn’t know much about it, but slowly I started realizing there was a lot of knowledge behind the technique. This has made the journey to become a Countertechnique teacher very interesting to me: learning new knowledge about the human body and its potential, the ways it can move and how to use it with the most efficiency.\n\nCountertechnique makes you more free to move, creates more awareness of your body and helps you to use it to its fullest potential. Countertechnique empowers dancers to pursue a life long dancing career in a safe way. I love to create an atmosphere in class where I’m sharing knowledge and tools for dancers to explore the technique in their own way and in their own timing.\"\n\nE-mail Marina\n\nMarina’s teaching history:\n\n22 Feb – 12 Apr 2024, Fontys Dance Academy, Tilburg (NL)\n\n6 Feb – 4 Apr 2023, Fontys Dance Academy, Tilburg (NL)\n\n15 Nov – 18 Jan 2023, Fontys Dance Academy, Tilburg (NL)\n\n29 Jun 2022, De Stilte, Breda (NL)\n\n13 – 20 Apr 2022, Korzo, The Hague (NL)\n\n1 Apr 2022, Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten (AHK), Amsterdam (NL)\n\n7 Feb – 18 Apr 2022, Fontys Dansacademie, Tilburg (NL)\n\n2 Sep – 20 Apr 2022, Lucia Marthas Institute for Performing Arts, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n7 – 17 Jun 2021, De Stilte, Breda (NL)\n\n15 – 16 Mar 2021, Henny Jurriëns Stichting, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n4 – 18 Mar 2021, Codarts University of the Arts, Rotterdam\n\n3 Mar 2021, Lucia Marthas Institute for Performing Arts, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n4 – 15 Jan 2021, De Châtel Sur Place, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n8 Oct – 10 Dec 2020, Amsterdam Dance Centre, Amsterdam (NL)\n\nAngie Lau\n\nSENIOR TEACHER\n\nBasel, Switzerland\n\n\"I want to stimulate students to explore an organized, supported and well-coordinated physical structure, and to encourage awareness for a better body use in everyday life.

She has been studying Countertechnique since 2000 and teaching it since 2007. She danced with dance company anoukvandijk dc since 2004 and is currently still performing in Anouk van Dijk's work TRUST (2009).\n\nAngie attended some of the world’s most renown dance educations, subsequently North Carolina School of the Arts (USA), Rotterdam Dance Academy (NL), Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker’s P.A.R.T.S. and Mathilde Monnier’s ex.e.r.ce. From 1999 onwards she has been collaborating with different international artists and has performed her own work internationally. Parallel to working as a dancer and a Countertechnique teacher, Angie finished the Iyengar Yoga Teacher Training in 2009 as well as her Rolfing Education. She is currently running a practice as a Rolfer and Yoga Teacher in Hamburg.\n\n“I am a passionate dancer and movement has always been a steady partner in my life. During the last years, my passion shifted from primarily being a performer to a growing interest in understanding the moving body and in helping other people find ease and pleasure in movement. My wish is to stimulate students to explore an organized, supported and well-coordinated physical structure, and to encourage awareness for a better body use in everyday life activities. With this in mind, I find Countertechnique an ideal dance training. It had a strong influence on my own professional life as a dancer by changing my understanding of how to apply and use the space inside as well as outside of myself; by giving me practical tools to work with during training and on stage; and by making me aware that mental boundaries or -freedom can have a major impact on movement availability. I feel great joy to now be able to share this technique.”\n\nE-mail Angie\n\nAngie’s teaching history:\n\n18 – 20 Sep 2023, Tanzbüro Basel, Basel (CH)\n\n9 Jun – 8 Sep 2023, Berner Ballett, Bern (CH)\n\n9 Jun – 6 Sep 2023, Berner Ballett, Bern (CH)\n\n11 – 12 Mar 2023, BETA Verein Berner Tanzschaffende, Bern (CH)\n\n22 – 24 Feb 2023, Berner Ballett, Bern (CH)\n\n25 Oct 2022, BETA Verein Berner Tanzschaffende, Bern (CH)\n\n28 – 29 May 2022, Verein Berner Tanzschaffende BETA, Bern (CH)\n\n26 Apr 2022, Verein Berner Tanzschaffende BETA, Bern (CH)\n\n12 – 13 Feb 2022, Beta Verein Berner Tanzschaffende, Bern (CH)\n\n7 – 9 Feb 2022, Tanzbüro Basel, Basel (CH)\n\n16 – 17 Oct 2021, Beta Verein Berner Tanzschaffende, Bern (CH)\n\n31 May – 2 Jun 2021, Tanzbüro Basel, Basel (CH)\n\n9 – 10 Nov 2020, Tanzbüro Basel, Basel (CH)\n\n9 – 18 Mar 2020, Tanzbüro Basel, Basel (CH)\n\n18 Jan – 12 Apr 2019, Chronos Movement Tanzstudio, Basel (CH)\n\n21 – 25 May 2018, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n26 Feb – 4 May 2018, Tanzbüro Basel, Basel (CH)\n\n11 – 14 Dec 2017, K3 - Zentrum für Choreographie, Hamburg (DE)\n\n25 – 26 Nov 2017, Chronos Movement Tanzstudio, Basel (CH)\n\n30 Oct – 3 Nov 2017, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n25 – 29 Sep 2017, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n6 – 9 Jun 2016, CDSH, Hamburg (DE)\n\n16 – 20 Jan 2017, CDSH, Hamburg (DE)\n\n5 – 8 Dec 2016, K3 Zenrum für Chorographie / Tanzplan Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n31 Oct – 4 Nov 2016, CDSH, Hamburg (DE)\n\n26 – 30 Sep 2016, CDSH, Hamburg (DE)\n\n29 Mar – 1 Apr 2016, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n1 – 5 Feb 2016, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n9 – 12 Nov 2015, K3 - Zentrum für Choreographie, Hamburg (DE)\n\n2 – 6 Nov 2015, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg\n\n28 Sep – 2 Oct 2015, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n7 – 10 Apr 2015, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n9 – 13 Feb 2015, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n17 – 27 Nov 2014, K3 Zentrum für Choreographie I Tanzplan Deutschland, Hamburg (DE)\n\n15 Sep – 31 Oct 2014, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n2 – 6 Jun 2014, Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Hamburg (DE)\n\n13 – 27 May 2014, Lola Rogge Schule, Hamburg (DE)\n\n20 – 28 Feb 2014, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n17 – 26 Feb 2014, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n17 – 24 Feb 2014, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\nMaya LaLiberté\n\nNorthampton (MA), USA\n\n\"As I teach others, I continue to dance in my own body, endlessly exploring.

She first connected with Countertechnique in 2014 during her undergraduate studies at Smith College, and subsequently participated in multiple workshops with various teachers in NYC. She attended One Body One Career (OBOC) intensives in Amsterdam in 2019 and 2022, and became a certified teacher after successfully completing the Countertechnique Teacher Training (CTTT) in 2022.\n\nMaya studied at Smith College, and graduated with a Bachelor in Dance in 2018. Upon graduating, she worked in NYC as a freelance dance artist, collaborating and performing in many projects throughout the Northeast. Since relocating to Western Massachusetts in 2020, Maya has deepened her creative practice and strengthened her commitment to building community through dance and collaborative art-making. She is currently a faculty member at the School of Contemporary Dance and Thought, and teaches classes within the Five College Consortium.\n\n“Countertechnique has become the most meaningful movement practice in my life. The spaciousness, presence, and freedom that I experience when dancing with Countertechnique is unmatched, and enables me to approach my dancing with profound intention, connection, and curiosity. No matter the context in which I move, I feel supported by this practice to engage my whole self. I connect deeply with the proactive approach to one’s own experience of moving - the layers of thinking and sensing while moving through space. As I dance, I teach myself. And now, as I teach others, I continue to dance in my own body, endlessly exploring. Countertechnique serves as a playground in which my entire being is able to awaken to observation, healthful movement, and joyful dancing, and it is thrilling to support individual and communal learning environments in which these experiences can be facilitated, metabolized, and inherently transformed.”\n\nE-mail Maya\n\nMaya’s upcoming classes:\n\nOpen event Closed event\n\nClass\n\nGibney\n\nNew York City\n\nSun 4 Aug, 12:00 – 13:45\n\nMon 5 Aug, 12:00 – 13:45\n\nSun 11 Aug, 12:00 – 13:45\n\nTue 13 Aug, 10:00 – 11:45\n\nThu 15 Aug, 12:00 – 13:45\n\npublic\n\nMaya’s teaching history:\n\n4 – 15 Aug 2024, Gibney, New York City\n\n17 – 21 Jun 2024, None, Amherst, MA (USA)\n\n9 – 11 Mar 2024, Mi Chantli, Boulder, CO (USA)\n\n4 Feb – 12 May 2024, School for Contemporary Dance and Thought, Northampton, MA (USA)\n\n31 Oct – 2 Nov 2023, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley\n\n28 Sep 2023, Amherst College, Amherst, MA (USA)\n\n22 Sep – 6 Oct 2023, CLI Conservatory, Southhampton, MA (USA)\n\n10 Sep – 10 Dec 2023, School of Contemporary Dance and Thought, Northampton (MA)\n\n4 Sep – 6 Dec 2023, Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT (USA)\n\n10 – 14 Jul 2023, School of Contemporary Dance and Thought, Northampton (MA) (USA)\n\n6 – 9 Jul 2023, Gibney Dance Center, New York City (USA)\n\n9 Jun 2023, Earthdance, Plainfield, MA (USA)\n\n11 – 18 Mar 2023, Gibney Dance Center (280 Broadway), New York City\n\n14 – 15 Jan 2023, Gibney Dance Center (280 Broadway), New York City (USA)\n\n8 Jan – 28 May 2023, School of Contemporary Dance and Thought, Northampton (MA) (USA)\n\n17 Dec 2022, Gibney Dance Center (280 Broadway), New York City (USA)\n\n5 Nov 2022, Gibney Dance Center, New York City (USA)\n\n11 Sep – 11 Dec 2022, School of Contemporary Dance and Thought, Northampton (USA)\n\nElita Cannata\n\nSENIOR TEACHER\n\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands\n\n\"Countertechnique is a precious tool that helps me to look for solutions rather than to be focused on problems, and it also reminds me that I am never alone while moving, allowing me to be alert and free.\"\n\nElita Cannata\n\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands\n\nBorn in Italy, Elita Cannata is currently based in Amsterdam. She has studied Countertechnique since 2005 and performed for anoukvandijk dc in 2007 and 2008. She attended her first Countertechnique Teacher Training (CTTT) program in 2014 and, with the support of the Amsterdams Fonds voor de Kunst, returned to the CTTT in 2018 and progressed to the level Senior Teacher.\n\nElita Cannata graduated with a Bachelor of Dance in 2007 at Rotterdam Dance Academy / Codarts in the Netherlands and in 2011 got her MA in Theories of Performing Arts at the Università degli Studi in Bologna. During and after her graduation she danced for José Navas, Megumi Nakamura, anoukvandijk dc, Cathy Sharp Ensemble, Compagnia Tpo, Tan Temel, Samuele Cardini, Itzik Galili and Fabrizio Favale among others. Next to her dance and teaching career, she also works for several dance companies in the Netherlands as a Rehearsal Director.\n\n\"Dance allows me to explore myself while being connected with others: it is not just about moving but about people, about sharing an experience. For me dance is a perfect moment of connection with what is happening inside and outside myself. It is a joyful exploration, a discovery in time and space of a momentum impossible to grasp, therefore endlessly challenging.\n\nCountertechnique is helping me to continue the research of that perfect moment, anyway impossible to reach, and to happily comprehend the responsibilities of my personal dance process through a practical training as such. It is a precious tool that helps me to look for solutions rather than to be focused on problems, and it also reminds me that I am never alone while moving, allowing me to be alert and free. Through Countertechnique I feel I can be present in the moment when all is perfectly connected, and this is thank to the choices I make… with fun and joy!

It is a gift to the evolution of dance and I am privileged to share it and be a part of it growing around the world.\"\n\nJoy Davis\n\nCharlotte (NC), USA\n\nBorn in the States, Joy is based in Charlotte (NC). She has been studying Countertechnique since 2005, including three One Body, One Career Intensives. She was certified as a Teacher Countertechnique in 2012 and attended a second and third Countertechnique Teacher Training program in 2016 and 2021; after which she received the title Senior Teacher.\n\nJoy is a dance educator, artist, and scholar. She received an MFA in Choreography and Performance from Smith College and a BA in Performing Arts through the College Scholars Program at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She is an Associate Professor at Boston Conservatory at Berklee, has taught as Visiting Faculty at Smith College, Wesleyan University and Harvard University.\n\nFounded in 2006, joyproject creates collaborative dance theater performance which evokes contemplation, humor, and elegant design. She was a Chicago Dancemakers Forum Greenhouse Artist, Choreographic Resident at the Workspace for Choreographers, Choreographer's Lab Artist with New Dialect, NeXt Choreographer for Urbanity Dance, and was recently awarded the Next Steps grant from The Boston Foundation. She collaborates with partner Eric Mullis, performing at UrBan Guild Kyoto, Fact/SF Summer Dance Festival San Francisco, Goodyear Arts in Charlotte, and RAD Fest in Kalamazoo, MI. Joy and Alexander Davis, The Davis Sisters, create duets and curate guest artists into their work, having been awarded a 2018 Schonberg [Boston] Fellowship residency at The Yard, inaugural Choreography Residency recipients at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, and selected for New England Dance on Tour 2020.\n\n\"Dance can be a bizarre and abstract language to communicate through, but somehow, we all relate to the delight or passion it elicits. I dance for catharsis, as a way to process life, for spiritual expression, and to enjoy my physical self. As I continue to grow and learn new facets and intricacies of dance, I love it more and more. Coming into knowledge and practice of Countertechnique changed and illuminated how and why and with what mindset I move. My body and mind have transformed through studying Countertechnique. It is a gift to the evolution of dance and I am privileged to share it and be a part of it growing around the world.\"\n\nE-mail Joy\n\nJoy’s teaching history:\n\n4 – 7 Aug 2024, Stewart/Owen Dance,

She has been studying Countertechnique since 2016, both at university and as an attendant of several workshops. She attended and successfully completed the Countertechnique Teacher Training program in 2023.\n\nMadison attended high school at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and then went onto getting her BFA and in Dance and a Minor in Arts Management from SUNY Purchase College. After finishing her studies in 2020 she has worked as a professional dancer with MJ Willis Project, DanceLabNYC, TU Dance, HIVEWILD, MeenMoves Dance Company and several more. She has also performed works by Doug Varone, Trisha Brown, Roderick George, Akira Uchida and more. She also creates and directs Dance Films. One film in particular, Empty Vessel, was featured in Dance Magazine, presented at 8 film festivals and has received 3 awards. In addition, Madison is the Executive and Artistic Director of an award winning nonprofit, Headlights Theater, which she founded in 2020.\n\n“Countertechnique reminds me of my love for dance even on the most challenging days. One of the things I connect to most with Countertechnique is that it’s not just something dancers can access within a Countertechnique class. These tools that Countertechnique offers allows dancers to tap into their full potential while giving dancers independent agency of their own dancing body in any class, throughout exhausting rehearsal days and on stage during rigerous performances. It keeps the mind active while the body is in motion allowing the dancer to stay present throughout the entire process of movement. Countertechnique creates a safe space allowing dancers to observing their moving body without judgement. It is my true honor to be able to share this technique that I hold so close to my heart with dancers all around the world.”\n\nE-mail Madison\n\nMadison’s teaching history:\n\n10 – 24 May 2024, Steps Conservatory, New York (USA)\n\n15 Apr – 6 May 2024, SUNY Purchase, New York (USA)\n\n6 – 20 Apr 2024, Gibney, New York (USA)\n\n5 Apr – 3 May 2024, Peridance, New York (USA)\n\n18 Mar 2024, Gibney, New York (USA)\n\n20 – 27 Feb 2024, Kaatsbaan, New York (USA)\n\n27 Jan 2024, The Tank, New York (USA)\n\n24 Jan – 14 Feb 2024, The Floor, New York (USA)\n\n23 Jan – 7 May 2024, Adelphi University, New York (USA)\n\n6 Dec 2023, Steps Conservatory, New York (USA)\n\n11 Nov 2023, Center for Performing Research, New York (USA)\n\n27 Sep – 19 Oct 2023, Adelphi University, New York (USA)\n\n19 – 23 Sep 2023, Headlights Theater, Sioux Falls, SD (USA)\n\nCatheryn Clifford\n\nNew York City, USA\n\n“The aim of my class is to build community, challenge the individual, and encourage a deep and endless growth one can access from Countertechnique’s unique practice.”\n\nCatheryn Clifford\n\nNew York City, USA\n\nCatheryn Clifford is based in Brooklyn, New York. She has been studying Countertechnique since 2017 while at university, and attended and successfully completed the Countertechnique Teacher Training program in 2023.\n\nCatheryn received a BFA in contemporary dance from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in 2020, where they developed a passion for collaborative processes, choreography, and film. As a dancer, choreographer, interdisciplinary creator and model, Catheryn’s work spans several mediums including award winning experimental film, abstract movement forms, live performance, dance for camera, and visual art. Catheryn is a founding member of Body Non-Profit, a close-knit collective of interdisciplinary artists researching the intersections of performance and the queer human experience. In addition to creating and performing original work, Catheryn has worked with Punch Drunk, Celia Rowlson-Hall, King Princess, Elena Vazintaris, Anouk van Dijk, Vim Vigor, and Asheville Contemporary Dance Theater.\n\n“Countertechnique enables dancers to find freedom, joy, and expansion within challenging movements. The practice of staying present, moment to moment, is one of the key elements that drew me to this technique, and something that makes it so special and effective. It calls on the individual to work with one’s own body, not an imagined or aspirational version of it, and to make autonomous choices that will help you in each movement. Nothing is fixed, and for me that provides an entirely new lens to experience dancing from. Sharing the personal knowledge I’ve gained from this practice, and creating an environment for all dancers to exchange helpful information and actively listen to our own bodies is the reason teaching Countertechnique is important to me. The aim of my class is to build community, challenge the individual, and encourage a deep and endless growth one can access from Countertechnique’s unique practice.”\n\nE-mail Catheryn\n\nNa-ye Kim\n\nSeoul, South Korea\n\n“Creatively problem solving to apply tools allowed for a profound body-mind connection and replaced my judgements and assumptions. In turn, I feel as though I am becoming wiser and stronger as a person and a dancer through Countertechnique.”\n\nNa-ye Kim\n\nSeoul, South Korea\n\nBorn and based in South Korea, Na-ye lives in Seoul. She has been studying Countertechnique since 2019, including two One Body, One Career intensives, and attended the Countertechnique Teacher Training program in 2021 and 2022.\n\nNa-ye Kim is a dance artist, educator and scholar. She studied classical ballet at The Royal Ballet School and received a BA (Hons) in Dance Education at Durham University (UK). In 2006, she graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts (USA) with an MFA in Dance Performance and Choreography. She has performed extensively on the global stage with Mikhail Baryshnikov's Hell's Kitchen Dance. Na-ye has also worked with renowned American choreographers including Gerald Casel, Aszure Barton, Karole Armitage, Bill Young, Kyle Abraham, Bridget L. Moore and Gabriel Forestieri in New York.\n\nShe continued her studies at Seoul National University (Korea) and received a PhD in Dance Education. She was a full-time lecturer at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts between 2016-2019 and is currently an assistant professor at the Sungkyunkwan University (Korea). She also leads her project company Na-ye Kim Movement Collective (NKMC), and her areas of research interest and specialisation include contemporary dance and choreography (creativity) pedagogy.\n\n“Needless to say, it was love at first sight. I knew instinctively that Countertechnique was what I was in search of to give life back to my dancing. I was tired and unmotivated in sustaining the daily practice as a dancer. The philosophy and the methodologies of Countertechnique resonated with me deeply both intellectually and physically. I was inspired anew, and the joy of making discoveries each day through the task-oriented approach was incredibly satisfying. Creative problem-solving to apply tools allowed for a profound body-mind connection and replaced the negative judgements and assumptions. In turn, I feel as though I am becoming wiser and stronger as a person and also as a dancer through each experience of Countertechnique.\n\nDance can be very subjective, and Countertechnique provides an objective language for communication. This resolves any ambiguities of dancing, and I am excited to share my love for dance as much as a dancer as well as an educator through Countertechnique.”\n\nE-mail Na-ye\n\nNa-ye’s upcoming classes:\n\nOpen event Closed event\n\nClass\n\nSeoul (KR)\n\nTue 6 Aug – Tue 6 Aug, 09:30 – 10:45\n\nThu 8 Aug – Thu 8 Aug, 09:30 – 10:45\n\nMon 12 Aug – Mon 12 Aug, 09:30 – 10:45\n\nWed 14 Aug – Wed 14 Aug, 09:30 – 10:45\n\nFri 16 Aug – Fri 16 Aug, 09:30 – 10:45\n\nTue 20 Aug – Tue 20 Aug, 09:30 – 10:45\n\nThu 22 Aug – Thu 22 Aug, 09:30 – 10:45\n\nprivate\n\nCurriculum\n\nSeoul (KR)\n\nMon 26 Aug – Mon 26 Aug, 01:00 – 03:00\n\nTue 27 Aug – Tue 27 Aug, 01:00 – 03:00\n\nWed 28 Aug – Wed 28 Aug, 01:00 – 03:00\n\nThu 29 Aug – Thu 29 Aug, 01:00 – 03:00\n\nprivate\n\nNa-ye’s teaching history:\n\n6 – 22 Aug 2024, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n1 – 4 Jul 2024, TS Studio, Hin Hon Creative&Production, Hong Kong SAR\n\n24 – 28 Jun 2024, Sungkyunkwan University & Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, Seoul (KR)\n\n7 Mar – 20 Jun 2024, Sungkyunkwan Univsersity, Seoul (KR)\n\n6 Mar – 12 Jun 2024, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n13 – 22 Feb 2024, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n3 – 4 Feb 2024, Contemporary Dance Association of Korea, Seoul (KR)\n\n16 – 17 Dec 2023, Studio Architanz, Tokyo (JP)\n\n30 Aug – 14 Dec 2023, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n17 – 18 Jun 2023, Contemporary Dance Association of Korea, Seoul (KR)\n\n2 Mar – 11 May 2023, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n2 Mar – 11 May 2023, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n6 – 16 Feb 2023, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n9 – 19 Jan 2023, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n31 Aug – 8 Dec 2022, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n8 – 12 Aug 2022, Henny Jurriëns Studio (HJS), Amsterdam (NL)\n\n23 Jul 2022, The Korean Society of Dance, Seoul (KR)\n\n4 – 8 Jul 2022, Na-ye Kim Movement Collective, Sungkyunkwan University and Korea National Contemporary Dance Company, Seoul (KR)\n\n27 Jun – 1 Jul 2022, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n24 Feb – 2 Jun 2022, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n21 Dec – 13 Jan 2022, Sungkyukwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\n1 Sep – 9 Dec 2021, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul (KR)\n\nJorijn Vriesendorp\n\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands\n\n\"Countertechnique has helped me enormously as a dancer and performer. It has given me trust in myself, and has expanded my way of thinking and moving.\"\n\nJorijn Vriesendorp\n\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands\n\nBorn in the Netherlands, Jorijn Vriesendorp is currently based in Amsterdam. She has been studying Countertechnique since 2010, attended the Countertechnique Teacher Training in 2014 and has been teaching Countertechnique since then. She danced in two of Anouk van Dijk’s works, Mensch (2011) and Rausch (2012).\n\nJorijn grew up dancing and started her professional training at a young age at Fontys Dance Academy in Tilburg (the Netherlands). After Fontys, she moved to Amsterdam to attend the Amsterdam School of the Arts, and in 2008 completed her BA in Jazz-Musical Dance there. She then moved to Australia to continue her studies, and in 2009 received her BA Contemporary Performing Arts degree from the Victorian College of the Arts / University of Melbourne.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, she worked for renowned Australian artists and companies, such as Gideon Obarzanek (former artistic director of Chunky Move) and Stephanie Lake. In 2012, Jorijn moved back to Europe, quickly building an impressive career as a performer with Anouk van Dijk, Cecilia Moisio and Falk Richter, working at major companies like anoukvandijk dc, Schaubühne Berlin, Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus and Schauspiel Frankfurt. As an all-round freelancer, Jorijn Vriesendorp also appeared in several short films for Cinedans Film Festival, and has been involved in one feature films, The Firebird by Lucas van Woerkum.\n\n“Countertechnique is very special to me. I love dancing and I see Countertechnique as an ongoing personal research, in which I can challenge myself in a playful way, and can constantly dig deeper. Countertechnique has helped me enormously as a dancer and performer. It has given me trust in myself, and has expanded my way of thinking and moving. In my movements there is much more ease and clarity, which allows me to explore movements that I could never think of doing beforehand. The amount of freedom it creates can be overwhelming – Countertechnique is not magic, but sometimes it can feel like that.\n\nThe joy I have whilst creating, performing and dancing on or off stage, is something I want to share with other dancers. Teaching for me is observing, guiding and suggesting different possibilities, in a pleasant environment where you can challenge yourself, take risks, dance with your full range, in a joyful way, whilst being gentle and smart with your body. Countertechnique keeps you aware - of your body, of what is happening inside and around you, and what’s happening with the space and others around you. Being truthful and present in the process, automatically also creates more space to think positive and objectively about yourself. This has also been so useful in my daily life.”\n\nE-mail Jorijn\n\nJorijn’s teaching history:\n\n3 – 4 Sep 2020, Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten - Expanded contemporary dance, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n3 – 7 Aug 2020, HJS Studio, amsterdam (NL)\n\n3 – 7 Feb 2020, Amsterdam University of the Arts, Academy of Theatre and Dance, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n17 Jan – 20 Mar 2020, Belcampo Loft, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n13 – 15 Mar 2019, Henny Jurriens stichting, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n4 – 12 Mar 2019, Codarts, Rotterdam (NL)\n\n29 Jan – 1 Feb 2018, Sally Dance Company Maastricht , Maastricht\n\n22 – 23 Jan 2018, HJS, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n15 – 16 Jan 2018, Academie voor Theater en Dans (AHK) Urban contemporary department, Amsterdam (NL)\n\n21 – 24 Nov 2017, Henny Jurriëns Stichting (HJS), Amsterdam (NL)\n\n2 – 3 Oct 2017, Project Sally dansgezelschap, Maastricht (NL)\n\n26 Mar 2017, Danserswijk, Oisterwijk (NL)\n\n17 Jan – 1 Feb 2017, Codarts , Rotterdam (NL)\n\n17 – 20 Nov 2015, Dansateliers, Rotterdam (NL)\n\n17 – 20 Nov 2015, Dansateliers, Rotterdam (NL)\n\n17 – 20 Nov 2015, Dansateliers, Rotterdam (NL)\n\n17 – 20 Nov 2015, Dansateliers, Rotterdam (NL)\n\n9 – 10 Nov 2015, Project Sally dance company, Maastricht (NL)\n\n26 – 28 Aug 2015, Project Sally, Maastricht (NL)\n\n20 – 22 Jul 2015, Project Sally, Maastricht (NL)\n\n12 – 20 May 2015, Codarts, Rotterdam (NL)\n\n10 – 13 Mar 2015, Cecilia Moisio / Dansmakers, Amsterdam (NL)\n\nMariko Koh\n\nBremen, Germany\n\n\"Exploring Countertechnique helps develop a healthier relationship with our body and mind.

She first encountered Countertechnique in 2013 and has since then participated in several classes of various teachers, as well as the One Body One Career in 2021 & 2022. In 2022 she attended and successfully completed the Countertechnique Teacher Training program.\n\nMariko Koh received a BA from Kobe College in 2012 and after graduation joined the Ballet Junior de Genève in Switzerland, workingwith Alexander Ekman, Ken Ossola, Barack Marshall, Cindy Van Acker and many other choreographers. Since 2013, she has worked as a freelance dancer for amongst others Grand Théâtre de la Ville (Luxembourg), Steptext Dance Project (Germany), Maqoma Gregory / Vuyani Dance Company (South-Africa), Opera La Monnaie (Belgium), National Opera Comédie (France) and many other companies across Europe. Since the beginning of the 2023/24 season, Mariko is choreographic assistant and training director of dance company, Of Curious Nature in Bremen (Germany).\n\n„Applying Countertechnique helped me acknowledge and accept myself for who I am. It helped me discover many more movement possibilities around and inside of me. With Countertechnique, I became more open minded and was able to build a healthier relationship with my body and mind. I can apply the different tools during dancing, when working on dance projects and even outside of dance in everyday life.\n\nExploring Countertechnique also allowed me to think differently about my body and better understand the sensations I have in my body. Realising they are different every day, and that it’s okay for them to be different, was beautiful for me. It is wonderful to understand that I can choose different tools every day that resonate with my sensations of the day. This brings more joy into my dancing and also my classes.“\n\nE-mail Mariko\n\nMariko’s teaching history:\n\n6 Aug 2024, of curious nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n29 Jul – 2 Aug 2024, Marameo, Berlin (DE)\n\n24 – 27 Jul 2024, of curious nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n12 Jul 2024, None, Kyoto (JP)\n\n30 Jun 2024, None, Osaka (JP)\n\n29 Jun – 6 Jul 2024, 斉藤DANCE工房, Osaka (JP)\n\n22 Jun 2024, ARCHITANZ, Tokyo (JP)\n\n10 – 13 Jun 2024, EIN TANZ HAUS, Mannheim (DE)\n\n10 – 14 Jun 2024, Dance Theatere Heidelberg, Heidelberg (DE)\n\n4 – 8 Jun 2024, Theater Regensburg, Regensburg (DE)\n\n29 Apr – 3 May 2024, DART, Berlin (DE)\n\n8 – 19 Apr 2024, of curious nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n5 – 6 Apr 2024, Teo Otto Theater, Remschheid (DE)\n\n21 Feb – 22 Mar 2024, of curious nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n15 Feb – 1 Mar 2024, of curious nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n10 Jan – 9 Feb 2024, Of Curious Nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n4 – 5 Jan 2024, None, Osaka (JP)\n\n18 – 22 Dec 2023, Marameo, Berlin (DE)\n\n13 Dec – 5 Jan 2024, None, Osaka (JP)\n\n4 – 5 Dec 2023, of curious natuer, Bremen (DE)\n\n20 – 23 Nov 2023, K3, Hamburg (DE)\n\n13 – 26 Nov 2023, of curious nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n11 – 12 Nov 2023, tanzXchange, Münster (DE)\n\n12 – 22 Oct 2023, Of curious nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n16 – 17 Sep 2023, Marameo, Berlin (DE)\n\n12 – 14 Sep 2023, Marameo, Berlin (DE)\n\n1 Aug – 2 Oct 2023, Of Curious Nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n24 – 28 Jul 2023, Marameo, Berlin (DE)\n\n17 – 21 Jul 2023, Studio29, Berlin (DE)\n\n28 – 29 Jun 2023, Of Curious Nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n19 – 20 Jun 2023, TANZ NETWERK BREMEN, Bremen (DE)\n\n13 – 17 Jun 2023, Staatstheater Braunschweig, Braunschweig (DE)\n\n7 – 10 Jun 2023, Dance Company Theater Osnabrück, Osnabrück (DE)\n\n24 – 25 May 2023, Mukogawa Women’s University, Kobe\n\n19 – 21 May 2023, Eyes dance, Kyoto (JP)\n\n11 – 17 May 2023, 斉藤Dance工房, Osaka\n\n6 – 7 May 2023, Studio Architanz, Tokyo (JP)\n\n5 May 2023, G-Screw Dance Labo, Tokyo (JP)\n\n29 – 30 Apr 2023, Kyoto Contemporary Ballet Open Class, Kyoto (JP)\n\n26 – 28 Apr 2023, Mukogawa Women‘s University, Kobe (JP)\n\n11 – 14 Apr 2023, of curious nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n4 Apr – 4 Jun 2023, Marameo, Berlin (DE)\n\n4 – 6 Apr 2023, Sasha Waltz & Guests, Berlin (DE)\n\n27 – 31 Mar 2023, TROIS C-L, Luxemburg (LU)\n\n20 – 24 Mar 2023, CDSH, Hamburg (DE)\n\n10 – 17 Mar 2023, Tanzxchange Münster, Münster (DE)\n\n20 – 24 Feb 2023, TanzNetDresden, Dresden (DE)\n\n30 Jan – 3 Feb 2023, Tanzfabrik, Berlin (DE)\n\n24 Jan – 2 Feb 2023, Marameo, Berlin (DE)\n\n18 – 19 Jan 2023, Kobe college, Kobe (JP)\n\n16 Jan 2023, Mayura Ballet Studio, Osaka (JP)\n\n9 Jan 2023, a-core-dance arts studio, Osaka (JP)\n\n14 – 18 Nov 2022, TanzNetzDresden ProfiTraining, Dresden (DE)\n\n7 – 9 Nov 2022, Of Curious Nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n1 – 2 Nov 2022, TANZPUNKT HANNOVER, Hannover (DE)\n\n24 Oct 2022, TANZ_NETZWERK_BREMEN PROFESSIONAL, Bremen (DE)\n\n11 – 14 Oct 2022, Of Curious Nature, Bremen (DE)\n\n8 – 12 Sep 2022, tanz_netzwerk_bremen PROFESSIONAL LAFDK, Bremen (DE)\n\nRosanna Tavarez\n\nSenior Teacher\n\nLos Angeles, USA\n\n\"With Countertechnique, the learning never stops!

I have found greater ease, flexibility, and strength, as well as a finer balance of instinct and technical decision-making.”\n\nLauren Langlois\n\nBrussels, Belgium\n\nOriginally from Western Australia, Lauren Langlois is currently based in Melbourne. She has been studying Countertechnique intensively since 2012. She attended the One Body One Career intensive twice, and became an accredited teacher of Countertechnique in August 2016.\n\nLauren studied classical ballet at the Marie Walton-Mahon Dance Academy in Newcastle before training in contemporary dance at the New Zealand School of Dance. After returning to Australia, she spent three years with Australian Dance Theatre before joining Sydney Dance Company. In 2012, she relocated to Melbourne to work as an independent dancer, where she has developed an ongoing artistic collaboration with Anouk van Dijk and Chunky Move, performing in An Act of Now, 247 Days, Complexity of Belonging (2015 Green Room Award Best Female Dancer) and Lucid. Lauren also appeared in works by Antony Hamilton, Lucy Guerin, Stephanie Lake, Prue Lang, Larissa McGowan, Lina Limosani and Lisa Wilson.\n\n“As a young dancer, I prioritised effort over efficiency, and placed unrealistic demands on my energy as a performer. I am glad to have met Anouk when I did - Countertechnique has empowered my body and mind, and improved the communication between them. It has given me greater versatility in the rehearsal room and a more sustainable approach to class.”\n\n“Countertechnique is an expansive process. I have found greater ease, flexibility, and strength, as well as a finer balance of instinct and technical decision-making. It allows you to choose what works for you, and let go of anything that doesn’t. This freedom creates autonomy and enables the dancer to better express themselves artistically. Additionally, it works for dancers of every level. As a teacher, I want to help dancers find ways to ease unnecessary pressure they may put on themselves. Countertechnique encourages the dancer to continually explore the possibilities of what they might be capable of, and provides a playful, rigorous class environment in which to flirt with these boundaries.”\n\nE-mail Lauren\n\nLauren’s teaching history:\n\n17 – 21 Oct 2022, Artez University of the Arts, Arnhem (NL)\n\n20 – 30 Sep 2021, Codarts, Rotterdam (NL)\n\n24 Jul – 3 Aug 2021, Henny Jurriëns Studio (HJS), Amsterdam (NL)\n\n10 Mar – 1 Apr 2020, Victorian College of the Arts, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n2 Sep – 10 Oct 2019, Lucy Guerin Inc., Melbourne (AUS)\n\n30 Aug – 4 Sep 2018, New Zealand School of Dance, Wellington (NZ)\n\n13 – 27 Jun 2018, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n2 Jun 2018, Sydney Dance Company, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n4 – 12 Apr 2018, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n21 – 29 Mar 2018, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n26 – 27 Oct 2017, Transit Dance, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n13 Oct 2017, Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n12 – 13 Oct 2017, Transit Dance, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n4 – 25 Oct 2017, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n25 – 29 Sep 2017, Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, Perth (AUS)\n\n24 – 30 Jun 2017, New Zealand School of Dance, Wellington (NZ)\n\n22 – 23 Jun 2017, New Zealand School of Dance, Wellington (NZ)\n\n18 May 2017, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n1 – 12 May 2017, Transit Dance, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n6 – 26 Apr 2017, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n5 Apr 2017, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n28 Nov – 8 Dec 2016, Chunky Move, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n22 Nov 2016, Transit Dance, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n10 – 14 Nov 2016, Transit Dance, Melbourne (AUS)\n\n28 Sep 2016, Cal State University, Los Angeles (USA)\n\nKelly Hirina\n\nBaltimore (MD), USA\n\n“Countertechnique is not only an extremely technical dance practice but makes learning and dancing magnificently fun. It encourages you to get on the floor, listen, try, test, fail, soar, play and enjoy.”\n\nKelly Hirina\n\nBaltimore (MD), USA\n\nAs a citizen of both the U.S.A. and the Netherlands, Kelly currently resides in Baltimore (MD). She was introduced to Countertechnique in the early 2000s and became certified as part of the Countertechnique Teacher Training program (CTTT) in 2020; she attended her second CTTT in 2022. It excites her that her research and the practice of Countertechnique align in various ways and she enjoys the resurgence of the technique in her professional life.\n\nDuring her extensive career as a freelance dancer, she worked with a wide range of choreographers and directors, including Jakop Ahlbom, Krisztina de Châtel as part of Dansgroep Amsterdam, and most recently ICKamsterdam (Emio Greco / Pieter Scholten). As of 2017, she has been a certified teacher of Double Skin/Double Mind, the dance method of EG|PC, pilates and yoga.\n\nShe acquired her M.F.A. in Dance from the University of Michigan with research based upon the link between mind and body in dance training, rehearsal and performance. Her specific interest is in pedagogical methods that enhance intrinsic motivation, appreciation for learning (a process-oriented approach) and goal setting. Kelly is eager to further develop these interests on the dance floor with Countertechnique.\n\n“Countertechnique is not only an extremely technical dance practice but makes learning and dancing magnificently fun.

I could let go of my own judgment and rediscover my flexibility, strength and joy of movement.\"\n\nEilit Marom\n\nThe Hague, the Netherlands\n\nEilit Marom is an Israeli choreographer and teacher based in The Hague, she works between Israel and the Netherlands in the fields of Dance and Visual Art. Eilit has studied Countertechnique since 2007 and had an internship as Anouk van Dijk's assistant in 2009. She attended the Countertechnique Teacher Training program in 2012, 2014 and 2022, and has been teaching Countertechnique since 2012 around Europe and Israel in professional education centers and companies.\n\nEilit studied contemporary dance at Dance Workshop Kibbutz Gaaton in Israel and graduated from ArtEZ Dance Academy in Arnhem, the Netherlands in 2010. She is a recipient of the “Dance in Community” grant from the Israel Ministry of Culture for her work with deaf communities. She created two collaboration projects “A state of statement” and “(To) Come and See” and presented i.a in March Hare Festival (Tel Aviv), Supercell (AUS), Les Rencontres Choregraphiques (Paris) Gessnerallee (Zurich), and Korzo (the Hague). She is the founder and director of “Blender” performance series in Haifa Theater and “Karov Meod '' Movement in public spaces Interdisciplinary Festival in Downtown Haifa. As a performer Eilit danced with choreographers such as Simone Truong, Keren Rosenberg, Jerome Bel, Amos Ben-Tal, Jack Gallagher, and Kalpana Raghuraman.\n\n“Countertechnique empowered my dancing and gave my body more volume in the space. I could let go of my own judgment and rediscover my flexibility, strength and joy of movement. During my internship with the company I watched how Anouk and her dancers use Countertechnique as training, but also as a tool in the creation process, rehearsals, and while performing. The method allows each person to share their unique artistry, be receptive and alive in every moment on stage. It was inspiring to take part in that process and learn how to apply Countertechnique in many aspects of dancing. After that internship, I realized this is something more people should get to know and decided I want to teach and pass it on to others!\n\nCountertechnique promotes the dancer to be an active partner of his/hers own body, giving space for individual growth, developing a researchers’ mind and bringing the focus on qualities in the here and now. As an artist, I found these are very useful skills to have in the independent field. The working field is constantly changing and dancers need to be flexible in their mind and way of working in order to create their own path in it. Practicing Countertechnique's way of thinking I enjoy much more the process, I am reminded by the fact that there is nothing to get but something to do – and that thought turns on my curiosity.\"\n\nE-mail Eilit\n\nEilit’s upcoming classes:\n\nOpen event Closed event\n\nCurriculum\n\nAmsterdam (NL)\n\nMon 9 Sep, 09:00 – 12:15\n\nTue 10 Sep, 09:00 – 12:15\n\nFri 13 Sep, 09:00 –

Slender-White\n\nSan Francisco, USA\n\n\"In class, we can have fun, work, and explore without worrying about being perfect or right. I think of dancing as an opportunity, not an obligation, and I have found that perspective to be quite liberating.\"\n\nCharles Slender-White\n\nSan Francisco, USA\n\nBorn in the US and currently based in San Francisco (USA), Charles is a choreographer, performer, advocate, teacher, and Artistic Director of FACT/SF. Before being selected to attend the Countertechnique Teacher Training (CTTT) program in 2012, he took Countertechnique classes since 2005, including the One Body, One Career Intensive. He has been teaching Countertechnique since 2012 in the United States, Canada and Europe. He attended his 2nd and 3rd CTTT in 2016 and 2022.\n\nCharles graduated with honors from the University of California, Berkeley with degrees in Dance & Performance Studies and English Literature. From 2006-2008, he worked extensively throughout Russia and Europe, performing with Tatiana Baganova’s Provincial Dances Theatre, teaching, and creating choreography. In 2008, he returned to his native California to create FACT/SF, a contemporary dance company based in San Francisco. Charles has taught at the American Dance Festival (USA), Kannon Dance (Russia), The Fringe Club (Hong Kong), University of Calgary (Canada), Zagreb Dance Center (Croatia), Derida Dance (Bulgaria), and many others. He currently teaches Countertechnique throughout the San Francisco Bay Area at ODC and Shawl-Anderson Dance Center. From 2021-2022, Charles worked at ODC Theater as a Guest Curator and Resident Strategist for Creative Partnerships and Curation.\n\n\"I find dancing to be one of the most thrilling and invigorating physical activities. It can be simple or complex, carefree or intentional, emotional or aesthetic. Dance is universal, but filled with endless nuance. Dance is so cool! I enjoy teaching dance because it gives me an opportunity to share my enthusiasm with others. In class, we can have fun, work, and explore without worrying about being perfect or right. I think of dancing as an opportunity, not an obligation, and I have found that perspective to be quite liberating.\n\nFor me, Countertechnique has provided a safe, supportive, fun, and sustainable approach to dancing. Countertechnique offers an alternative to chronic pain and grinding joints, and allows for students to gain a better awareness of their moving bodies. It requires dancers to think and to train their brain while they train their muscles – this is invaluable. I am not aware of other dance techniques that combine work, play, and intentionality so seamlessly. It prepares the mind and body for rehearsal, but also for the day…becoming practiced in reducing unnecessary tension, seeing what’s around you, and making informed choices.\"\n\nE-mail Charles\n\nCharles’s upcoming classes:\n\nOpen event Closed event\n\nWorkshop\n\nSan Francisco (USA)\n\nThu 15 Aug – Sat 24 Aug, 10:00 – 16:00\n\npublic\n\nWorkshop\n\nPhoenix (USA)\n\nFri 13 Sep, 15:00 – 19:00\n\nSat 14 Sep – Sun 15 Sep, 10:00 – 15:00\n\npublic\n\nCharles’s teaching history:\n\n10 – 24 Jun 2024, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n15 Apr 2024, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n18 – 22 Mar 2024, Vault Movement Projects, Vancouver (CA)\n\n26 Feb 2024, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n2 – 4 Feb 2024, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n26 – 28 Jan 2024, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n4 Dec – 8 Jan 2024, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n3 – 5 Nov 2023, DISCO RIOT, San Diego (USA)\n\n17 – 26 Aug 2023, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n20 Jun – 7 Jul 2023, American Dance Festival, Durham (USA)\n\n17 Apr – 8 May 2023, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n13 – 17 Mar 2023, Vault Movement Projects, Vancouver (CA)\n\n24 – 26 Feb 2023, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n8 Feb 2023, UC Irvine, Irvine (USA)\n\n8 Feb 2023, CSU Long Beach, Long Beach (USA)\n\n7 Feb 2023, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles (USA)\n\n9 Jan – 20 Feb 2023, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n19 – 21 Nov 2022, DISCO RIOT, San Diego (USA)\n\n19 Sep – 10 Oct 2022, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n29 Aug – 2 Sep 2022, Vault Movement Projects, The Hub Studios London, London (GB)\n\n8 – 12 Aug 2022, Henny Jurriëns Studio (HJS), Amsterdam (NL)\n\n25 – 31 Jul 2022, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n19 Jul 2022, Velocity Dance Center, Seattle (USA)\n\n9 – 13 May 2022, Velocity Dance Center, Seattle (USA)\n\n25 Apr – 13 Jun 2022, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n25 – 27 Feb 2022, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n20 Dec 2021, Shawl-Anderson Dance Center, Berkeley (USA)\n\n6 – 19 Dec 2021, ODC School, San Francisco (USA)\n\n5 Dec 2021, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n2 – 18 Nov 2021, ODC School Youth & Teen Program, San Francisco (USA)\n\n8 – 14 Aug 2021, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n17 – 18 Apr 2021, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n4 – 8 May 2020, Countertechnique Online, San Francisco (USA)\n\n27 Apr – 1 May 2020, Countertechnique Online, San Francisco (USA)\n\n21 – 23 Feb 2020, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n16 – 20 Dec 2019, Velocity Dance Center, Seattle (USA)\n\n23 – 25 Nov 2019, Disco Riot, San Diego (USA)\n\n11 Nov – 13 Dec 2019, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n4 – 8 Nov 2019, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley (USA)\n\n11 – 17 Aug 2019, FACT/SF, San Francisco (USA)\n\n5 – 9 Aug 2019, ODC, San Francisco (USA)\n\n17 Jun – 19 Jul 2019, American Dance Festival, Durham (USA)\n\n23 Apr 2019, Shawl-Anderson Dance Center, Berkeley (USA)\n\n18 – 22 Mar 2019, Vault Movement Projects, Vancouver (CA)\n\n15 Mar 2019, ACDA -

She has been studying Countertechnique since 2018, including three One Body, One Career Intensives among many other classes and workshops. She attended and successfully completed the Countertechnique Teacher Training program in 2023.\n\nMelissa is a dancer, teacher and choreographer. She received her MFA in dance from the University of Michigan and her BFA from the University of Central Oklahoma. She spent 12 years in New York City as a freelance artist, where she worked with choreographers such as Hope Boykin, Nejla Yatkin, Sue Bernhard and Kathryn Alter to name a few. She also choreographed for dance and theatre and participated in outreach through Avodah Dance. She taught Limón technique with the Limón Institute at Gibney and Peridance and served as an adjunct professor at the University of Michigan. Melissa is currently an Assistant Professor of Practice in Dance at Texas Tech University.\n\n\"Countertechnique offers a roadmap that activates the mind and invites the artist to discover their full potential without judgement. Through Countertechnique dancers are able to bring their whole self to their work, avoid burnout and find agency in their dancing. I found Countertechnique later in my performing career and discovering how to access more range, power and stability during that time was truly life changing. It showed me that I could dance longer and stronger than I thought possible. Training in Countertechnique not only transformed my dancing and relationship to my body, but also gave me tools and language to create and communicate in my choreographic practice. The possibilities are limitless, and I am grateful to be able to share this information with dancers and witness them finding clarity and strength in mind and body.\"\n\nE-mail Melissa\n\nMelissa’s upcoming classes:\n\nOpen event Closed event\n\nClass\n\nHouston (USA)\n\nSat 17 Aug, 10:45 – 12:15\n\nSun 18 Aug, 10:45 – 12:15\n\npublic\n\nCurriculum\n\nLubbock\n\nMon 26 Aug, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nWed 28 Aug, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nMon 2 Sep, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nWed 4 Sep, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nMon 9 Sep, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nWed 11 Sep, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nMon 16 Sep, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nWed 18 Sep, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nMon 23 Sep, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nWed 25 Sep, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nMon 30 Sep, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nWed 2 Oct, 09:30 – 11:00\n\nprivate\n\nMelissa’s teaching history:\n\n6 Jul 2024, Texas Tech University Pom Squad, Lubbock (USA)\n\n21 – 24 Mar 2024, ACDA, Austin (USA)\n\n29 Jan – 13 Mar 2024, Texas Tech University, Lubbock (USA)\n\n12 Oct – 30 Nov 2023, Texas Tech University, Lubbock (USA)\n\n10 Oct – 5 Dec 2023, Texas Tech University, Lubbock (USA)\n\nArianna Hartanov\n\nSanta Barbara (CA), USA\n\n“With Countertechnique, the process of finding solutions is so much more interesting than trying to find problems.

With it, I now have the agency and freedom to explore movement to its fullest everyday. In my professional career as a dancer, it is thrilling to be able to experience dancing fully. I can continue to stay inspired, engaged, and free from my own judgment. With Countertechnique, the process of finding solutions is so much more interesting than trying to find problems. Teaching and helping others to do the same fills my heart with joy.“\n\nE-mail Arianna\n\nArianna’s upcoming classes:\n\nOpen event Closed event\n\nClass\n\nSanta Barbara, CA (USA)\n\nSun 15 Oct, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 29 Oct, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 5 Nov, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 12 Nov, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 19 Nov, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 26 Nov, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 7 Jan, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 14 Jan, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 21 Jan, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSat 3 Feb, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 11 Feb, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 18 Feb, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 25 Feb, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 3 Mar, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 10 Mar, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 31 Mar, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 7 Apr, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 14 Apr, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 21 Apr, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 26 May, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 2 Jun, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 9 Jun, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 16 Jun, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 23 Jun, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 30 Jun, 15:30 – 17:30\n\nSun 7 Jul, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 14 Jul, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 21 Jul, 15:30 – 17:00\n\nSun 4 Aug, 17:00 – 18:30\n\nSun 18 Aug, 17:00 – 18:30\n\nSun 25 Aug, 17:00 – 18:30\n\nSun 1 Sep, 17:00 – 18:30\n\nSun 8 Sep, 17:00 – 18:30\n\npublic\n\nClass\n\nLos Angeles (USA)\n\nMon 29 Apr, 11:00 – 13:00\n\nMon 20 May, 11:00 – 13:00\n\nSat 13 Jul, 11:30 – 01:00\n\nSat 20 Jul, 11:30 – 01:00\n\nFri 30 Aug, 10:30 – 12:00\n\nSun 1 Sep, 10:30 – 12:00\n\nSun 15 Sep, 10:30 – 12:00\n\npublic\n\nArianna’s teaching history:\n\n11 Aug 2024, Premier Youth Dance Company, Orange County, CA (USA)\n\n29 Apr – 15 Sep 2024, The Space LA, Los Angeles (USA)\n\n18 – 19 Dec 2023, Stomping Ground LA, Los Angeles (USA)\n\n23 – 27 Oct 2023, State Street Ballet, Santa Barbara, CA (USA)\n\n15 Oct – 8 Sep 2024, State Street Ballet, Santa Barbara, CA (USA)\n\n7 Sep – 6 Jul 2024, State Street Ballet, Santa Barbara, CA (USA)\n\nNiharika Senapati\n\nSENIOR TEACHER\n\nAntwerp, Belgium\n\n“Countertechnique is a joyful exploration, where failure, fear and pain are removed from the situation, and replaced with choice.
