        "text": "Shabbat Nachamu, the Sabbath of comfort, is one of a handful of Sabbaths with a special designation. Usually the title emanates from the haftarah or when we read a maftir from a second Torah scroll. Consider the names of Shabbat Shuva, Shekalim, Zachor, Parah, Ha'Chodesh, Ha'Gadol, and Chazon last week.\n\nNow consider the challenge and opportunity found in today's theme of comfort.\n\nFrom Isaiah chapter forty, imagine if you had experienced the period surrounding and including the destruction of the First Temple of Jerusalem in 586BCE. All was lost. The Babylonians had conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the holy Temple. Much of Jewry had been exiled to Babylonia. How would you have responded to Isaiah's call to God, \"Nachamu Nachamu Ami - Comfort, comfort my people?\"\n\nWould you have taken these words seriously? Or would you have been in despair? Sarcastic at the very least? For those who believed, some fifty years after the Exile, Jews returned to Israel and began to pave the way toward a Second Temple period.\n\nFast forward several hundred years later. Imagine if you had experienced the period surrounding and including the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem in 70CE. All was lost. The Romans had conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the holy Temple. Much of Jewry had been exiled to Babylonia and beyond. How would you have responded to the Prophetic words, \"Nachamu Nachamu Ami - Comfort, comfort My people?\"\n\nWould you have taken these words seriously? Or would you have been in despair? Sarcastic at the very least? For those who believed, just decades later, Sages living in Yavneh began to sow the seeds of the Mishna and Talmud. Judaism was reimagined and reinvigorated. Judaism could and would endure without a holy Temple and anywhere in the world.\n\nFast forward to the Spring of 1945. Eastern European Jewry had been slaughtered in under a decade. Six million Jewish lives had been lost. How would you have responded to the Prophetic words, \"Nachamu Nachamu Ami - Comfort, comfort my people?\n\nWould you have taken these words seriously? Or would you have been in despair? Sarcastic at the very least? For those who believed, the State of Israel was born three years later. Soon, Jewish life thrived in Israel, North America and other parts of the globe.\n\nFast forward to October 7, 2023, Simchat Torah in Israel, One of the happiest days on the Jewish calendar. The unthinkable happened - 1200 lives lost on a single day, babies burned in ovens, women raped and murdered, safe houses turned into places of horror and brutality, hundreds taken hostage.\n\nIn ten and a half months since, Israeli lives are lost and displaced in Southern and Northern Israel, the lives of Jews and non-Jews. Twelve Druze children were murdered on a single day playing on a soccer field. Young Israelis, Jews and non-Jews, serving in the IDF, who have made the ultimate sacrifice; Jews around the world who have suffered from unprecedented surges in acts of anti-Semitism with little or no support from local government, our growing concerns regarding Iran, Hezbollah, and the list goes on.\n\nHow would you respond to today's Prophetic words, \"Nachamu Nachamu Ami - Comfort, comfort My people?\"\n\nWould you take these words seriously? Or would you be in despair? Sarcastic at the very least?\n\nHistory has taught us to believe in these words, time and time again. It is challenging to believe that a season of comfort and renewal will come when we are in the midst of a perilous time. But believe and work toward that belief are vital.\n\nNachamu Nachamu Ami - Comfort, comfort My people!\n\nAmen!\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nMY REFLECTIONS AS A CONVERT\n\nThere's a quote from Gandhi which says, \"Learn as if you were to live forever.‚Äù If there's a civilization that lives up to this saying, it's definitely Judaism. In my continuous journey what I've come to notice is that the more I think I know something is the more I realize that I know nothing about it at all. There's an ETERNALITY to Judaism which is definitely marked by a plethora of opinions and points of view and questions where laws and practices and customs are concerned, which keeps me actively in pursuit of LEARNING and KNOWING. It just never ends. And this is where Judaism feeds me intellectually. There's never a dull moment - there's always something to learn, whether it is from the different perspectives of Torah commentators or the different sects that make up Judaism - if a Jew DESIRES to learn, s/he will definitely learn, indeed! You can be an ignoramus in Judaism ONLY if you CHOOSE to be! And so for a person who's never satisfied with what he THINKS he already knows, Judaism is the perfect fit, for me!\n\nSecondly, there's an aspect of Judaism which keeps me active, spiritually. In T'hillim 16:8 David says, \"I have placed HaShem before me constantly;. . .\" and in T'hillim 73:28, Asaph says, \"But as for me - G-d's nearness is my good;. . .\" Judaism encompasses both of these verses, heavily, and as such, has truly kept me on point, spiritually. There's a saying that while the calendar of non-Jews goes by days, the calendar of the Jewish people go by hours. And it's true. One of the practices that I've learned to continually adapt to is to being constantly in line, spiritually. The earliest time for donning tallit and t'phillin, the latest time to say \"Sh'ma\", the latest time to say the Morning Prayers, et cetera - all matters of spirituality or \"closeness to G-d\" is ordered in such a manner, daily, almost by an hourly basis, that a Jew can stray from spirituality ONLY if s/he WANTS TO. For some, this may come off as being very burdensome but for me, personally speaking, it is an exercise that keeps me straight, spiritually. This continuous sense of order, throughout each day, brings about spiritual discipline the likes of which I never had when I was a part of another religion wherein there was no spiritual order by which each day was lived, and so everyone usually did \"what was right in his [own] eyes\" (Shof'tim 17:6; 21:25). Judaism feeds the desires of one who truly desires closeness to G-d, consistently.\n\nFinally, through my journey towards Judaism as well as my continuing journey within Judaism as a Ger, one of the things I've found truly intriguing is what I call \"Jewish Hospitality,\" especially here at Beth Emeth. In D'varim 10:19, there is a mitzvah stating, \"You shall love the stranger. . .\" or some say \"CONVERT\", \". . .for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\" During my talk with the Beth Din, during my conversion process, one of the questions I was asked was whether or not I've received any form of support within the community that I have become a part of, especially as one in the process of conversion.\n\nI remember my first Shabbat walking into Beth Emeth, not only was I given warm greetings but I was even asked to stay around for Kiddush after Service; and after being absent for one Shabbat while I was still a visitor here, I was greeted, the following week with, \"Where were you last week? We missed you.\" That's what you call loving a stranger! As a non-Jew I received invitations to Pesach Seders, Rosh HaShanah dinners, and even became a member of the \"Kiddush Club!\" If there was absolutely nothing about Judaism that I found worth converting for, the hospitality that I had been shown here, at Beth Emeth, would be enough for me to want to convert! I was never approached or spoken down to as a non-Jew (as some have sadly reported in other communities) but treated as though I was already a part of the Tribe! And when it became public, during Shavuot of 2023, that I had started the conversion process, not only was I greeted with well-wishes on my conversion process, but I was encouraged with the particular and heartwarming statement, \"you're already one of us!\" It's support like this that truly elevates and encourages the soul of a Ger who's the only Jew in his biological family, like myself. Beth Emeth, through the virtue of Judaism truly embraces the concept of what it means to be a part of an \"extended family unit!\"\n\nSuch hospitality does not end with Beth Emeth. On June 9, during the UJA's 55th annual \"WALK WITH ISRAEL\" I was treated like a star by everyone and anyone whom I told I was a Ger, when asked what moved me to walk in support of Israel! Everything from hugs, to fist bumps, to hand shakes, to selfies were exchanged with people who were complete strangers to me, but nonetheless immediately embraced me as a part of the family! This makes me proud to be a part of a people who not only embraces strangers but who equally and swiftly embraces the Convert as their own!\n\nThank you!\n\nSincerely,\n\nRanford Jackson\n\nMost of us believe in the value of dissent and disagreement. As human beings, no single person possesses the entirety of truth. So, we listen to each other, learn from each other, agree to disagree with each other, and even be open to modifying our pre-conceived notions when involved in persuasive argument and debate. Our Sages call this \"Machloket L'Shem Shamayim - Dispute for the sake of heaven,\" meaning that we disagree meritoriously when the purpose is to understand a deeper truth. The Sages, Hillel and Shammai, are considered exemplars of legitimate dispute.\n\nOur Parsha today, however, contains a different kind of dissent, one which is not valued in our tradition. The portion begins with the words, \"Vayikach Korach - Korach took.\" But what did he take? The English translation found in the Etz Hayim Chumash suggests that Korah took himself. Korach cared about himself only. He was not interested in legitimate debate when he and his followers challenged Moses and Aaron. Korach was interested only in self-aggrandizement. When Moses was willing to be pro-active and take the first step to meet with Korach's cohorts, they were not interested in any kind of dialogue. In rabbinic tradition, Korach and his cohorts are considered the exemplars of \"Machloket Lo L'Shem Shamayim - Dispute which is not for the sake of heaven.\"\n\nI ask you to consider your own debates with family, friends, and other associates. In your mind, were you willing to be convinced by the other? Was the other willing to be convinced by you? Or were you or them really not interested in hearing a different perspective? Were you or they guilty of the expression, \"Do not confuse me with the facts; my mind is already made up?\"\n\nLegitimate debate is very difficult. It is not easy to truly listen with mind, heart, and soul to a position which differs from your own. It is easy to go through the motions of thinking you are really listening to the other, when really, you have shut yourself down. Often in my office, I try to help parties in conflict by helping them with listening skills. In a difference of opinion, I ask one to share his/her view. The other must listen and restate what he/she heard before responding. Then, the two parties to switch roles. In many instances, one has a difficult time really hearing the other - Thus, the conflict in the relationship.\n\nIn all the shuls I have served, I have witnessed legitimate debate and illegitimate debate in formal committee-like settings and in casual conversations. I have witnessed the same phenomenon among family and friends.\n\nOur rabbis suggest that the portion of Korach is applicable at any time of the Jewish year precisely because the Jewish people often get embroiled in Korach-like debate. Take for example the tremendous rift at this time a year ago in Israel over proposed judicial reform, the controversy between who has the upper hand - the Knesset or the Supreme Court. The sharp division occurred not only in Israel but even in the Diaspora where sharp divisions within our people took place over political and philosophical lines.\n\nNow, almost exactly nine months since October 7th, there is more unity within our people because much of the world stands against us. However, we know that internal debate within Israel and within the Jewish world are still sharp in terms of hostages, eradicating Hamas, what to do with Hezbollah, and so many other earth-shattering concerns. Are our internal debates legitimate like Hillel and Shammai, with the ability to really listen and even be willing to change our minds? Or, are our internal debates illegitimate like Korach and his cohorts, who are unable to truly listen, learn, and be willing to modify their views?\n\nA week and a half ago, I was truly pleased when our shul hosted myself, Rabbi Daniel Korobkin, and Rabbi Tina Grimberg on the subject of \"Angst in the Jewish community post October 7th.\" While there really was no sharp debate between us, we truly listened to each other, respected each other, and cared about each other.\n\nThere was a time until recently when clergy and representatives of different religious traditions could also sit down and truly share constructive dialogue. This seems to have come to a screeching halt after October 7. I strive and hope for the day when multi-faith conversation can legitimately take place.\n\nIn the U.S. right now, and at some point in Canada, there will be debates between political parties. Will those striving for office care about the people they are charged to serve? Or, will they be like Korach, caring only about themselves and their positions of power?\n\nIndeed, Parshat Korach is truly a relevant Parsha for the ages, with lessons to be learned in all kinds of situations.\n\nShabbat Shalom,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nThis coming Shabbat and Sunday are Rosh Chodesh Tammuz. While Summer officially began in the end of June, I tend to think of the months of Tammuz and Av as being Summer for me. The previous month of Sivan included Shavuot, part of Spring. The following month of Elul will coincide with the beginning of Fall and introduce the High Holy Day season.\n\nTammuz and Av are certainly not the happiest months on the Jewish calendar. The seventeenth of Tammuz is a minor Fast, sunrise to sundown, reminding us of the Babylonians breaching the walls of Jerusalem before destroying the holy Temple three weeks later. Tisha B'Av is a major Fast, nighfall to nightfall, reminding us of the date on which the first and second holy Temples were destroyed.\n\nMany rabbis take much of their annual vacation during the Summer when the pace is a little slower than the rest of the year. Mine will be no exception. I will be away July 12-August 11 for starters. However, with minor exception over the years, I prefer to observe the Fast and other rituals surrounding Tisha B'Av with you, my congregational family, and not in a different community. I find it comforting to observe the saddest day of the year with my spiritual community. When I sit on the floor or on a low chair with you at night for the book of Lamentations; when I refrain from wearing Tallit and Tefillin in the morning; when I recite Kinnot, sad dirges, in the morning - somehow the despair of the day is lessened when I share those experiences with you.\n\nThis year at Beth Emeth, the sadness of Tisha B'Av will be preceded and followed by the joy of Aufrufs. We yearn for the day when the vision of the Prophets will come true, when FASTS will be transformed to FEASTS permanently for all time.\n\nIn the meantime, for those who are embarking on Summer travels or who have left for Summer camp, I wish you safe travels. I wish us all a healthy and meaningful Summer.\n\nShabbat Shalom,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nThe plan was simple. God had already promised the Land of Israel to the Children of Israel. As a formality, Moses designated a representative from each tribe to investigate the land and report back. Then, the entire nation would enter. Within a couple of years, the Exodus from Egypt, the giving of the Torah at Sinai, and the people in its God-given land would be complete. However, ten of the chieftains came back, not with facts, not with a positive assurance which had already been promised, but a contrived editorial opinion which scared the rest of the people. \"Efes - Zero\" - No chance of success. We are grasshoppers in their sight. The truth was lost in the sight of what we might call today competing narratives. At the end of the day, only Joshua and Caleb affirmed God's given truth. Some 40 years later, only they would enter the promised land from the generation that came out of Egypt.\n\nMy friends - Truth vs falsehood is almost lost. Good vs evil is almost lost. Everybody has their \"narrative,\" their \"truth.\" Over the last eight months, Jews in Israel, Canada, and all over the world have tried and must continue to try to speak about right vs wrong, light vs darkness, even when much of society has lost its way.\n\nThe latest example took place just over a week ago when the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) accepted a committee resolution by a vote of 15-7 to introduce a new form of protection for its students called APR - Anti Palestinian Racism. Why the need? On the books we already have legislation against Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and other forms of protection from prejudice and bigotry.\n\nTo its credit, the entire Jewish community came and rallied together but did not succeed. The APR policy was ratified without a clear definition of what it even means. In addition, on the school board level, there was no mention or discussion of anti-Semitism, which is on the rise much more than anything else. What started on the local school board level can extend into government and other areas of society. Will Zionism, the belief that Jews have the right to be sovereign in our promised land, become an example of anti-Palestinian racism? Will the IHRA, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism become an example of anti-Palestinian racism? Part of that definition includes:\n\n\"Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. . . . Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews. . . . Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of the State of Israel is a racist endeavor. etc.\"\n\nWill the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism be ignored, negated, and buried?\n\nWill the fundamental truth that the Jewish people are indigenous to the land of Israel become a form of anti-Palestinian racism?\n\nWill our 3000 plus years of Jewish history in the land of Israel become a form of anti-Palestinian racism?\n\nWill our use of Hebrew become a form of anti-Palestinian racism?\n\nWill our facing Jerusalem in prayer become a form of anti-Palestinian racism?\n\nWill our plea at the end of Yom Kippur and the Pesach seder, \"Next year in Jerusalem\" become a form of anti-Palestinian racism?\n\nWill any truth about Jews and our relationship with Israel pre-1948 become a form of anti-Palestinian racism?\n\nWill failing to recognize the term Palestinian or a Palestinian people become a form of anti-Palestinian racism?\n\nWill the only way of understanding \"From the river to the sea,\" as meaning the elimination of the State of Israel, become a form of anti-Palestinian racism?\n\nWill the truthful statement that in 3500 years there was never a sovereign territory called Palestine become a form of anti-Palestinian racism?\n\nWill fighting anti-Semitism be interpreted as a form of anti-Palestinian Racism?\n\nWill a false narrative which calls for the annihilation of the State of Israel be called freedom of expression, but the truth about the Jewish State of Israel be called a violation of law and policy?\n\nWhere is the call for school policies directed against anti-Semitism?\n\nWhere is the call against renaming the map of Israel as Palestine as being a form of anti-Semitism?\n\nWhere is the protection of Jewish students in the public schools to feel free and safe? To wear a Kippa, Tzizit, a Star of David, a Chai, a stand with Israel bracelet, a dog tag with a plea for rescuing hostages now, etc.?\n\nIn today's Parsha, we do have hope and optimism - the courage and bravery exemplified by Joshua and Caleb. They held their ground. They knew there was no such thing as competing narratives when it comes to the Jewish right to be sovereign in Israel. They maintained the faith and promise given by God. It is their determination that enabled our ancestors to reside in Israel during their lifetimes. So, may we be modern Joshuas and Calebs, keeping the faith and promise, and assuring the right for Jews everywhere to express their beliefs, based on a definitive solid historical truth.\n\nShabbat Shalom,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nI am a spoiled person raised outside of Boston, Mass. On my street were mostly Jews and Asians. I attended Yeshiva day school followed by Boston University before attending rabbinical school. I had many non-Jewish friends from part time jobs and the neighborhood. I do not remember any overt forms of prejudice in my formative years. What I do remember is the following incident:\n\nAs a rabbinical student, I also served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve as a chaplain. In Chaplain school, Summer of 1984, a faculty member, A Catholic chaplain asked me to remove my Kippa because it was not an official part of my uniform. At the time, the issue of Kippa in uniform was being debated in the Supreme Court. Only after my incident, the Court ruled that \"Unobtrusive headgear\" was permissible. Thus, I would wear a black or dark blue kippa with my blue uniform.\n\nI will never forget that it was among multi-faith clergy that I felt attacked for my faith and heritage. I learned never to take anything for granted; that prejudice, bigotry, whatever word you choose, can happen anywhere.\n\nFast forward, I came to Toronto in the Summer of 2000. Called a multi-cultural society, I did not feel it that greatly. For example, attempts at clergy dialogue in this riding have been attempted with partial success at best. In the aftermath of October 7th, the little interaction I had with Christian and Muslim clergy has dropped completely. Even before any military response from Israel; in the days following October 7th, I received not a single call of comfort or sympathy for me or the Jewish community from any of my non-Jewish colleagues. I am not alone in this regard. Many rabbis and members of my community have received little or no support. I would call that \"Angst #1.\"\n\nI am reminded of the Passover Haggadah, \"In every generation there are those who rise against us.\" We Jews know that anti-Semitism, the hatred for Jews being Jews, is nothing new. We Jews know that anti-Zionism is another term for anti-Semitism. Judaism is linked with the right of Jews to live in our historic ancestral homeland called Israel.\n\nI am reminded of the Prophet Bilam's words, \"Behold there is a people that dwells apart, not recognized by the nations.\"\n\nWhat I do know is that the majority of Jews in Israel, Canada, and around the world have become more united after October 7. The political divide in Israel over judicial reform has paused. If Sinat Chinam, baseless hatred among Jews, led to the destruction of the Second Temple, I believe that Sinat Chinam was eroding our people before October 7th.\n\nSince that time, I am in pain, I cry, I pray - For those who were brutally slain on October 7th, for their families, for the hostages - the ones rescued, the ones in captivity, and for their families. I pray for the wellbeing of IDF, police, and security heroes. I mourn for those who have lost their lives in acts of kiddush hashem, martyrdom. I cry and pray for our fellow Jews around the world who have suffered at the hands of Jew-hatred. I believe that evil against Jews has always been present, but the reactions of the world since October 7th have made it easier to get away with harassing Jews, young and old, on the streets, in schools, on campuses, at work, and even in governments.\n\nI am thankful for the bold and clear voice of some non-Jews who understand that we are not dealing with competing narratives but with moral clarity of right vs wrong, good vs evil, light vs dark. They include but are not limited to Douglas Murray, Natasha Hausdorff, Dr. Phil, and Bill Maher.\n\nI am in angst that when Israel suffered the equivalent of many 9/11's on one day, Israel is not accorded the same right to defend itself by going after the perpetrators. And while I lament for anyone who has died in the last eight months, I blame Hamas and its supporters for it all.\n\nI had the chance to go on 3‚Äì4-day solidarity missions to Israel in the early months. I chose not to do so because I wanted to go with my synagogue family. In mid-May, 21 of us went for nine days with three objectives in mind.\n\n1. To help out - by working in fields, preparing food, and even tying tzizit knots.\n\n2. To bear witness and visit impacted sites - the Nova Festival grounds, the site of burned out and destroyed automobiles, homes and neighborhoods where innocent people lost their lives in safe houses and other places.\n\n3. To hear from people who were directly touched, such as Rachel Goldberg-Polin, whose son Hersh is still a hostage; By the Vital's, huband and wife, whose daughter was murdered on a Kibbutz.\n\nLast - I urge us to be careful, but not afraid. while I believe in covering my head everywhere, I cannot believe that in parts of Toronto and Vaughan, I choose to wear a cap over my Kippa, because of safety and security concerns.\n\nI urge us to be pro-active and not give up or be passive. I commend 50,000 of us who walked with Israel. I commend those who have fought against the APR policy in the Toronto District School Board I commend those who stand with Israel every Sunday at Sheppard and Bathurst. I commend those who are working in business, university, government, and more to speak truth against falsehood.\n\nAm Yisrael Chai!\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nThis Shabbat, Friday night and Saturday, marks my father's 25th Yahrzeit, the 23rd of Sivan. When I started at Beth Emeth in the Summer of 2000, I had just completed reciting Kaddish for my father, and I was still reciting Kaddish for my mother who had passed away three months after my dad.\n\nMy father's Hebrew name was Reuven ben Moshe. It is striking that at the outset of today's Parsha, Moshe (Moses) assigns delegates for each tribe, starting with the tribe of Reuven.\n\nMy father was one of six brothers. Five of them were raised in two foster homes, with my dad and two younger brothers being raised by an Orthodox family in the Bronx. While my father received a very basic form of Jewish education, he grew up in an Orthodox observant foster family.\n\nFast forward, my father met my mother while attending university in Boston. Together, they raised me and my three siblings. My parents were early members of the Young Israel of Brookline. There, my dad was a virtual one-man house committee and was completely devoted to the synagogue. Some of you know the story that on one particular Shabbat, as the Ark was opened, one of the Torah scrolls almost fell out of its slot. During the week, my dad and I went to the shul alone at night, and my father fastened golden link chains across both levels of the Ark. On the following Shabbat, when the Ark was opened during services, the glow of the new chains illuminated the entire sanctuary. Only then did the members understand what my father had done during the preceding days.\n\nMy father insisted that his children attend Jewish day school all the way through high school. He was proud of my decision to enter the rabbinate and visited me at my previous two shuls. He had remarked to me at one time that he envisioned me becoming a rabbi in one more shul during my career. How did he know about Beth Emeth before I did? While he never got to see me here, I feel his and my mother's presence every day.\n\nMay the Neshama of Avi Mori, my father and teacher, be bound in the bond of life eternal.\n\nShabbat Shalom,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nAvraham Tzvi ben Reuven (proud son of Ruben Morrison, z\"l)\n\nIf you followed our Parsha today, there is a lot of grumbling and division among the people of Israel. One can understand a hungry, thirsty, and tired people losing the focus of their purpose and destiny.\n\nWhat is striking, however, is the tension and division within the family of leadership. Moses, Aaron, and Miriam form a triad, a three-legged stool of leadership. Moses - the ambassador of Torah; Aaron - the officiant of the Temple ritual; Miriam - the exemplar of Chesed, kindness. Yet, the sibling model of leadership appears to break down. Miriam gossips to Aaron about Moses. In years past, I have focused on the nature of the gossip. Commentaries abound.\n\nThis year, however, I want to focus on the target of the gossip - Moses. In the midst of the sibling conflict, we learn that Moses was the most humble person on the face of the earth. The Torah then proves its own thesis by explaining Moses' response after his sister gossiped about him to their brother. After Miriam is punished by God with a skin disease and is banished from the camp of Israel, Moses responds quickly, clearly, and succinctly - a five-word prayer:\n\n\"El Na Refa Na La - God, please heal her please.\" This is the shortest prayer in Jewish history, and one that is immediately accepted by God. The most humble man on the face of the earth not only ensures the wellbeing of his sister, he unifies the triad of leadership, and in so doing, he unifies the people of Israel. Miriam is reintegrated into the peoplehood of Israel, and the nation continues to journey forward.\n\nWhile the end of the Parsha focuses on three individual siblings, I respond to it in a collective way this year in the wake of October 7. Our brothers and sisters were divided on significant political and ideological matters. While the tragedy of October 7 is just so horrific and difficult to digest, our people turned to its humble side and sought unity and not division. Like Moses' prayer for Miriam, we have prayed and continue to pray for our people - for the families who lost lives, for the hostages, for the rescued hostages, for the IDF and security forces, for the memories of those who lost their lives, for the victims of anti-Semitism around the world in the last several months, and especially more recently.\n\nWhen humility and prayer for one another become our away, then we are able to move forward.\n\nThe pain of our people continues to be severe. Join me in praying the five word prayer that Moses uttered for his sister Miriam.\n\n\"El Na Refa Na La - God, please heal her (the body and soul of all Israel), please.\"\n\nShabbat Shalom,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nParshat Naso is the longest Parsha in the entire Torah. Yet the final chapter, the longest ever, is fairly easy for a Torah reader. Twelve paragraphs are completely repetitive, except for the name of the chieftain and his tribe. We read about the gifts that were presented at the dedication of the Tabernacle by the chieftains of the twelve tribes of Israel. They brought exactly the same gift, each, one day after the other.\n\nThe medieval commentator Abarbanel says that the chieftains had all agreed in advance to bring identical offerings. Knowing how often sibling rivalry between brothers causes pride or jealousy to interfere with sibling relationships, they were being extra cautious to prevent that from occurring here. If that is true, then surely that showed they had learned a lesson from the experience of their ancient Joseph and his brothers, for whom the tribes are named.\n\nBut why read the same identical list twelve times over? Why couldn't the Torah just give the list of the names of the chieftains and tell us that they all gave the same gifts, and list the content of the gifts one time only?\n\nNow come some classical commentators: The Bchor Shor says that it was so that each chieftain and tribe would have his day in the sun. Ramban says that the Holy One wished to provide equal honor to all of them. While each tribe brought exactly the same things in the same amount, each had its own independent reason for doing so.\n\nThe Baal Ha'Turim, known for commenting on numbers, mentions that each chieftain's name is recorded twice, thus 24 times in total. The 24 names allude to 24 hours. Each chieftain was given his own 24-hour time period when his tribe's gifts were celebrated. In addition, each chieftain's name is recorded at the beginning and end of a 6-verse allotment. The 6 verses allotted to each chieftain are an allusion to the 6 workdays of the week.\n\nWith all of these commentaries in mind, we see an unmatched unity among the leaders and the tribes of Israel, while maintaining each one's personal intent and commitment.\n\nLast weekend reminded me of this chapter of Torah in a couple of ways. During last Shabbat, we learned of the heroic rescue of four hostages: Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrei Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv. The unity and euphoria were felt in Israel and all over the Jewish world. A beachfront in Tel Aviv erupted when the announcement was made. In our own shul last Shabbat, there was not a dry eye. With this unmatched unity of spirit, there were also tears for the remaining hostages and their families. There were tears that Almog's father had passed away days prior to his son's liberation due in part to overwhelming grief. There were tears that chief inspector Arnon Zmora of the police forces died of wounds suffered in the rescue effort.\n\nThen, last Sunday, as expected, neither rain nor anti-Israel protests kept some fifty thousand Jews from walking for and with Israel. I took some time to stand at the intersection of Bathurst and Sheppard to witness many of our own Beth Emeth members as well as the diverse segments of the entire Jewish community coming together. For 36 consecutive weeks, the Jewish community has stood as one with prayer and reflection at that intersection. With each individual expressing his/her commitment in a personal way, collectively, the many thousands stood and walked as one cohesive community.\n\nWhile the last chapter in Parshat Naso could have been made shorter, its full repetition of the 12 days worth of gifts presented by the 12 tribes of Israel serves as a role model and paradigm for the kind of people we can be at the most important of times.\n\nShabbat Shalom,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nThere are many Jews who confuse the meanings of Simchat Torah and Shavuot. There are those who think that Simchat Torah is the date on which God revealed the Torah. As we know, it is on this date of Shavuot that God revealed the Torah at Sinai to our people. Simchat Torah actually has no mention or status in scripture. Its significance developed in Talmudic times when the annual cycle of reading the Torah began and ended on Simchat Torah. Because its status is less than Biblical, Simchat Torah became a looser yom tov in terms of joy, celebration, and even a level of frivolity. Conversely, Shavuot is the second of the Torah's three pilgrimage Festivals - Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot, physical freedom, spiritual purpose, and endurance in the wilderness.\n\nNevertheless, Simchat Torah and Shavuot are both the definitive holidays on the calendar which speak to the experience of Torah directly. The other holidays have all kinds of symbolic objects and ritual practices. If Simchat Torah celebrates the cycle of READING the Torah, Shavuot celebrates the importance of STUDYING the Torah. Thus, many people observe a late medieval mystical practice of staying up the first night of Shavuot and studying selections of the written and oral Torah.\n\nThis year, sadly of course, there is a different kind of relationship between Simchat Torah and Shavuot. In Israel, October 7 coincided with Simchat Torah (Shemini Atzeret in the Diaspora). The celebration of reading, singing, and dancing with the Torah was marred by 1200 tragic deaths and the taking of hundreds of hostages. While secular leaning Israelis were singing and dancing at the Nova music festival, they were celebrating in their own way the ideals of peace and unity, cherished Torah values.\n\nWhen twenty-one of us were in Israel in mid-May, our tour guide, Moshe Gold, spoke of counting the days of darkness toward the anticipated day of light. I could not help but notice that for the forty-nine days of Omer counting between Pesach and Shavuot, the two hundred and X days paralleled the X days of the Omer. Thus, when we concluded the Omer counting on Monday night, Tuesday, the 49th day of the Omer, mirrored the 249th day since the horrors of October 7. How so many of us yearned for the war to end with the return of all the hostages by the end of the Omer period, which was not to be.\n\nNow, the Festival of Shavuot comes with our having endured over eight months of hardship and oppression, felt not only in Israel but all over the Jewish world. For many of us, it is our commitment to Torah which is providing us with an anchor, stability, and support, to cope and persevere.\n\nFor some, it is the study of the weekly Parsha which is keeping us strong.\n\nFor some, it is the daily recitation of Psalms which is keeping us strong.\n\nFor some, it is the Torah's call to perform acts of Tikun Olam and social action which is keeping us strong.\n\nFor some, it is the anticipation of baby namings, Bnai Mitzvah, and weddings which is keeping us strong.\n\nFor some, it is the Torah's call to stand in peaceful protest which is keeping us strong.\n\n\"Etz Hayim Hee - The Torah is a tree of life to those who grasp it, and all who uphold it are blessed. Its ways are pleasant, and all its paths are peace.\"\n\nIn whatever ways we incorporate Torah in our lives, may its paths lead our people in Israel and around the world to a true peace speedily.\n\nChag Sameach,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nIt is difficult to focus on the life and death of a person by sharing numbers only. Numbers are just too vast, be it six million Jews who were slaughtered during the Shoah or the thousands of Jews who have perished for being Jewish between October 7th and now.\n\nIn the spirit of all whom we recall today, I wish to focus on the remembrance of one particular soul whose name came up many times on the shul's recent Israel solidarity mission. He represents the courage, bravery, and pride of every Jew whom we recall today. His name is Aner Elyakim Shapira. We encountered his name at least three times over nine days in Israel.\n\nFirst, we heard direct testimony from Rachel Goldberg-Polin. Over the years, she has worked at the Ramah Israel Institute as a guidance counselor. She has had to take time off nowadays. Ramah brought her in to speak to our group and other Ramah groups. She has been prolific and outspoken regarding the hostages, as her son Hersh is among those taken captive. Assuming Hersh is still alive, his survival is due to Aner Shapira. On fleeing from the shooting and violence at the Nova music festival, a large number of Israelis crammed into a local safe house. There, the Hamas terrorists were hurling grenades into the crowded area. With military background, it was Aner who stood by the front catching and throwing back seven grenades, saving the lives of others, though he was subsequently murdered. One of the lives he saved was Hersh's, who lost his arm while being taken hostage.\n\nSecond, a few days after hearing from Rachel, our Beth Emeth group actually entered the safe house, which is now famous. We witnessed and took photos of the outside and inside of the safe house. We saw the dried blood and the bullet holes. But we also saw, seven months after the terror, Azkarot - beautiful tributes and poems inscribed on the walls inside the safe house, mentioning Aner and the others.\n\nThird, on our last day we visited Mt. Hertzl cemetery. On Yom Ha'Zikaron, Israelis visit the military cemeteries on the day which commemorates all the fallen soldiers and victims of terror. Most of our group was actually traveling that day to Israel. Our mission began the following day on Yom Ha'Atzmaut. So, we made our last day a sort of BEBY Yom Ha'Zikaron. At the Mt. Hertzl cemetery, as many of you know, the stone monuments on the graves are configured liked a bed with a pillow at the top. When we came to Aner's grave, the monument had not yet been established. His was a fresh grave, laid out beautifully with branches, plants, and shrubbery, along with tributes and testimonials.\n\nOne story of remembrance to represent all the stories of remembrance on this day. We will remember the fallen as they were in their lives, what they managed to accomplish, their ambitions, and the dreams left unfulfilled. We will remember the last minutes of their heroism. The Israelis who were murdered since October 7th leave behind orphans, widows, widowers, siblings, and bereaved parents. We know that 116 hostages still remain. Are they dead? alive? in what physical condition? We need them all back.\n\nOn Shavuot, we eat dairy. The Torah and the land of Israel are described as flowing with milk and honey.\n\nOn Shavuot, we remember this day as Yom Ha'Bikurim, the Festival of the first fruits, when the ancient Israelite farmer dedicated his first fruits to God and to our heritage. On this day, he recited a litany of history beginning with the words, \"Arami Oved Avi - An Aramean sought to destroy my father,\" but he concluded his words with \"God brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.\"\n\nSome 3600 years later, the proverbial Aramean continues to seek to destroy us, and yet we continue to thrive in a land and with a heritage flowing with milk and honey.\n\nChag Sameach,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nToday, we begin reading the fourth book of the Torah, B'Midbar-Numbers. Our ancestors begin to trek through the wilderness for thirty-eight years. The twelve tribes of Israel are arranged in a particular sequence, each displaying its unique flag, with the portable Tabernacle situated in the center among the tribes.\n\nNo longer a rag tag bunch of slaves, the Israelites are a prepared army ready for potential conflict. Another reading suggests that the distinctiveness of each tribe with its own flag and banner is a paradigm for each of us to find our own particular flag of Judaism, a distinctive way which will help each of us frame the importance of Judaism in our lives.\n\nFor some of us, that distinctive flag will be ritual observance.\n\nFor some of us, that distinctive flag will be daily prayer.\n\nFor some of us, that distinctive flag will be Tikun Olam, social justice.\n\nFor some of us, that distinctive flag will be ongoing education.\n\nFor some of us, that distinctive flag will be our love and support of Israel\n\nFor some of us, that distinctive flag will be Holocaust awareness and the lessons learned from Millenia of anti-Semitism.\n\nFor some of us, that distinctive flag will be a combination of some or all of the above.\n\nAnd the list goes on. . . .\n\nWith the coming of Shavuot, four days from now, we all know that Torah, like the Ark of the Covenant in the ancient Tabernacle, stands as our center piece. While Torah represents a holistic approach to Judaism, our tradition has never been binary in that you are either \"this\" or \"that\", either \"observant\" or \"not.\" As taught in the story of Jacob's ladder, Judaism is step by step, not all or nothing. Every bit counts. For my older son, Judaism begins with the observance of Mitzvot from which everything else ensues. For my younger son, Judaism begins with a secure Israel from which everything else ensues.\n\nIn rabbinical school, I studied the theologies of two great modern theologians, Rabbis Abraham Joshua Heschel and Mordecai Kaplan. When it came to the Ten Commandments, for Heschel, the first commandment, the oneness of God, led the way to the remaining nine. For Kaplan, the tenth commandment, \"thou shalt not covet\" led the way to the remaining nine. Each was right in his own distinctive way.\n\nThe fact that our history began with twelve distinctive tribes with its own symbols and expressions underlies contemporary Jewish pluralism. There is more than one authentic way to express one's Jewish identity.\n\nTomorrow will be a modern re-creation of the alignment of the ancient tribes of Israel. Given the last eight months, I expect more Jews than usual to attend the annual Walk with Israel. While we can assume protesters will abound, that will not deter us.\n\nTomorrow will be a microcosm of the diversity found within our Jewish community: Reform, Reconstructionist, Conservative, Traditional, Orthodox, secular, religious, Israeli, Ashkenazi, Sefardi, and more. Every Jew will be united by a strong Jewish identity centered around a love and commitment for the people, land, culture, and state of Israel.\n\nNow is a time to remember that internal divisions and strife, called Sinat Chinam, must be replaced by baseless love for each and every Jew, called Ahavat Chinam.\n\nThis past year, our Diaspora love for Israel has been reinforced by our two shinshinim, Omri and Sharon. While they have their own young evolving ideologies about Judaism, together, they showed us the best of Israel and a new generation of leadership. We wish you both good health, safety, and success in your upcoming military careers in the IDF, followed by your advanced education, and professional careers. We cannot thank you enough for all the vitality you have brought to us, especially in a year that has had to be so challenging for you on many levels.\n\nOur BEBY community fell in love with you both instantly. I know that we will continue to stay in touch in the months and years to come.\n\nWith tomorrow's march with Israel, Shavuot, and our Shinshinim in mind - what comes to mind for me is the famous Talmudic statement, \"Kol Yisrael Arevim Zeh La'Zeh - All of Israel is bound to and responsible for one another.\"\n\nShabbat Shalom,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nIn a conventional Jewish calendar year, last week's portion of Bhar and this week's portion of Bechukotai are read as a single unified portion. In a leap year, with four additional weeks on the calendar, they are split into separate Shabbat Torah readings. As many of you heard last week from Caren Leinwand, ever since my Bar Mitzvah, with the exception of Covid, I have always chanted Bhar, my Bar Mitzvah portion publicly, until last week. Instead of reading it, I lived it and walked it.\n\nBhar, Leviticus chapter 25, mentions Israel 20 times. Bechuotai, chapter 26, mentions Israel 23 times. As a unified double parsha, Israel is mentioned 43 times int total, more references than anywhere else in Torah.\n\nTake a few examples from today's reading:\n\n\"Vee'Shavtem La'Vetach B'Artzchem - You shall dwell securely in your land (Lev 26:5).\" Clearly, this has not happened yet. However, our Sages understand this verse to mean that within the Jewish people, there will be unity. Since the horrors of October 7, there indeed has been more unity within the Jewish people. 21 people from Beth Emeth saw this to be true from May 14-22.\n\n\"V'Natati Shalom B'Artzchem - I will grant peace in the Land (Lev. 26:6).\" The very next verse - How does it differ from the previous one? Our Sages understand this verse to mean that there will be peace in the land between Jews and her non-Jewish neighbors. Clearly, this is not the case yet. Our Arab Israeli bus driver loves living in Israel. He could not get the same rights anywhere else. He served in the IDF. His two sons are currently serving in Gaza. Yet, we also met a woman from his Moshav who does not get it, even with direct evidence as to the horrors just a 45-minute bus ride away.\n\nMy friends - I am not going to retrace our solidarity mission step by step, like a journal or diary. I have done that for us. You can find nine daily blogs with pictures on the shul website. What I will share is how we fulfilled our three goals:\n\nWe went to Israel to bear witness, and we did. We saw two safe houses from inside where unspeakable horrors took place. We saw the Nova music festival site, where unspeakable horrors took place. We went to hostage square and saw families and friends who are mourning terrible loss and who want their loved ones taken hostage brought home. A democracy with diverse opinions - We took note that almost every Israeli wants the same - Bring them home now and uproot Hamas. We beared witness to the resolve and resilience from IDF soldiers in their early 20's enjoying a barbecue we made for them. We beared witness from the IDF units we saw at Castel, at Mt. Herzl cemetery and other places. They are all committed to their mission and purpose.\n\nWe went to Israel to learn the truth from impacted families, and we did. We heard live and in person a mother speak about her son who is still a hostage. Is he dead? alive? How can one begin to understand a mother's pain? We heard live and in person two elderly parents whose daughter was murdered while protecting her two young children. How can one begin to understand the pain of these parents and grandparents? We visited a relocated Kibbutz, now temporarily called a vertical Kibbutz in a Tel Aviv skyscraper whose community was attacked on October 7. We met with people who cannot go back home right now. How can one begin to understand the pain of individuals and families who cannot live the pioneer style they were dedicated to in planting a Kibbutz lifestyle? Even in our hotel, we met some individuals for whom the hotel is now their temporary home because they have been evacuated, at least for now.\n\nWe went to Israel to simply offer some help and we did. We pruned at a vineyard. We got a farm ready for the growth of tomatoes. We packed and boxed fruits and vegetables. We made a hundred submarine chicken salad sandwiches which were delivered same day for IDF soldiers serving in Gaza. We packed all kinds of beans at Pantry Packers to be shipped to hungry Israelis all over the country.\n\nIn Bechukotai, we read: \"I will remember my covenant with Jacob . . . with Isaac . . . with Abraham, and I will remember the land (Lev. 26:42).\" This is the only verse in the entire Torah where the land itself is personified. We are commanded to treat the actual land of Israel with the same love and respect as we would a fellow human being.\n\nMy friends - I felt safer in Israel than I do in parts of Toronto. I felt safer in Israel than I did in parts of New York city, when I visited my son in February. We all know that the situation for Jews all over in the Diaspora world is fraught with danger right now. I was still away when a neighboring girls' Yeshiva was shot up on a Shabbat. I was still away when a Jewish boy was bullied and afraid to attend his Faywood Arts School. However, we need to assume that same resolve and resilience that 21 of us witnessed in Israel. Do not be afraid to be Jewish in public. Careful - Yes! Afraid - No! Walk with Israel a week from tomorrow. Wear your bracelets, your dog tags, your tie, your Kippa, your Tzizit.\n\nWe Jews are a small minority. But truth is on our side, and we are not totally alone. Some TV personalities actually get it - Dr.Phil, Bill Maher, Megyn Kelly, Mark Levin, Jerry Seinfeld, Douglas Murray, amongst others.\n\nIf we need any inspiration boost, take into your hearts, souls, and minds, the three word postscript when we complete reading a book of the Torah: \"Chazak Chazak V'Nitchazek - Be of strength, be of strength, and let us be strengthened together.\"\n\nShabbat Shalom,\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nOur last day of the solidarity mission - We started our morning at Pantry Packers in Jerusalem packing food. This organization is under the auspices of Collel Chabad and provides food to the needy throughout the country. Our group was joined by a Bar Mitzvah group from Brooklyn, NY which simply felt the need to be in Israel at this time.\n\nAt Mount Hertzl cemetery, among the many graves we visited, we saw the grave of Michael Levin. He was a lone soldier who died in 2006.\n\nWe also visited the grave of Aner Shapira. A few days ago, we entered the safe room he was in protecting others of the Nova Festival before his life was taken.\n\nWe also saw the grave of Ilan Moshe Cohen who lost his life just a week ago.\n\nWe visited the grave of Martin Davidovich. A Holocaust survivor, who died in an IDF training mission in 1948 in Czechoslovakia. Recognized as a lone soldier, his body was moved to Mount Hertzl in 2021.\n\nWe concluded our visit with the recitations of Kel Maleh and Kaddish.\n\nAt the office of the World Zionist Organization, we met with V.P. Yitzhak Hess. He shared his views on the state of of affairs these days.\n\nAfterward, we had our own private debriefing. Our group talked about the emotional power of giving and receiving hugs of support with Israelis. We marveled at our people's resilience on many levels. While some in Toronto found our mission to be \"heartbreaking,\" we saw our mission as \"heartwarming.\" The giving of letters to different strata of Israeli society elicited smiles and good feeling. Everyone was grateful to come and experience something which could only happen by doing what we did for nine days. We gave and received support in everything we did. All of us felt purpose, fulfillment, and meaning over these last nine days.\n\nOur last program was a farewell dinner at the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens. Final reflections and lots of hugs were shared among Beth Emeth and Ramah staff. This was our third tour arranged by Ramah Israel Institute: Our 2015 Poland - Israel tour; Our 2019 Spain-Gibraltar-Portugal tour, and now our Israel solidarity mission.\n\nOne of Judaism's supreme Mitzvot is Hakarat Ha'Tov, recognizing the good in others. I am grateful to Beth Emeth, our travel participants, and to Ramah for an experience which transcends words.\n\nRabbi Howard Morrison\n\nThis morning, we visited the Zechariah Moshav outside the area of Bet Shemesh and spent an hour and a half working on a tomato farm. I will never take fresh tomatoes for granted after seeing the preparatory work which is required.\n\nWe visited and climbed the Castel, just outside of Jerusalem. Originally a Crusader fortress, this hill was a signicant conquest by Israel in April 1948 which opened the way to Jerusalem during the war of independence.\n\nWe encountered a Golani brigade enjoying a mental health break after having served four consecutive months in Gaza. By experiencing Castel, young Israelis understand what we are fighting for to this very day.\n\nUpon leaving Castel, we saw many new trainees in uniform. Their commanding officer told one from our group, \" We are not merely fighting for our land. We are fighting for our nation.\" These young inductees understand the message of Castel to this precise moment in our history.\n\nWe visited an Arab-Israeli neighborhood called Ein Rafa. There, we were hosted by a resident named Yasmin. She shared her personal views on all kinds of subjects which were meaningful to all of us. While some of her views were controversial to our group, I would maintain that any level of authentic dialogue is important. We should appreciate that in a mission of this sort, it was imperative to meet with Yasmin and engage in difficult conversation. The residents of Ein Rafa have been citizens of Israel since the founding of the State of Israel.\n\nFinally, some of us donated blood via Magen David Edom. There is perhaps no greater Mitzvah than providing this life source for the needs of others."
