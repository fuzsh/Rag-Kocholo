        "text": "Background\n\nThe world woke up on July 8 2022 to the shocking news that Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had been gunned down by a 41 year old gunman with a homemade weapon. Despite the severity of his wounds, Abe fought valiantly but succumbed to his injuries later that day.\n\nA polarising figure, Shinzo Abe is arguably the most recognisable political figure in Japanese history. Hailing from a respected political family, Abe’s father had once served as Japan’s Foreign Minister while his grandfather (who himself had survived an assassination attempt) and great uncle had also served as Prime Minister in the past.\n\nFirst ascending to the role of Prime Minister in 2006 at the age of 52, Abe became Japan’s youngest postwar Prime Minister. Abe’s term would last only a year as his popularity diminished and he resigned in 2007 citing health reasons. However, he would make a political comeback and regain the Prime Ministership in 2012. This time, he would serve for 8 years and became Japan’s longest serving Prime Minister."
