He was also ambassador to South Korea (1971-74).\n\nHabibi, Abdullah (Khan) (b. 1952), defense minister of Afghanistan (2016-17).

Sept. 11, 2019, Jakarta, Indonesia), president of Indonesia (1998-99). He became a government adviser and chief of a new aerospace company in 1976. Two years later he became research minister and head of the Agency for Technology Evaluation and Application. In 1990 he was also appointed head of the Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals Association to boost the influence of Muslims (about 90% of the population) in a government traditionally dominated by Christian technocrats. In 1993 he unveiled the first Indonesian-developed plane, which he helped design. He wanted Indonesia to climb the technology ladder, believing his enterprises would spawn high-tech ventures in the private sector. Indonesian technocrats and the World Bank expressed doubts; military brass resented having to buy equipment from his firms. But President Suharto's support helped him generally get his way. During the 1993 central-board elections of the ruling Golkar political organization, he helped the children and allies of Suharto rise to top positions, easing out long-standing military-backed power brokers. In 1994 a tabloid and two newsmagazines were closed after reporting cabinet disagreement over his plan to refurbish 39 vessels bought from the former East German navy at his initiative. The Finance Ministry balked at the cost and the military felt that its turf had been violated; he still got more than $400 million. Long viewed as a likely successor to Suharto, he became vice president in March 1998. In May 1998, rioting forced Suharto to resign and Habibie became president. He eased political and press restrictions, but in 1999 he lost a confidence vote in the new parliament and as a consequence withdrew from the presidential race.\n\nHabibou, Allele Elhadj (b. 1938 - d. Dec. 9/10, 2016, Tunis, Tunisia), foreign minister of Niger (1988-89). He was also ambassador to Ivory Coast (1971-74), Ghana (1974-80), and Senegal (1980-82), mayor of Niamey (1982-83), and minister of justice (1983-85), agriculture and environment (1985-87), and mines and energy (1987-88).\n\nHabibullah\n\nHabibullah Khan (b. June 3, 1872, Samarkand, Russian Turkestan [now in Uzbekistan] - d. Feb. 20, 1919, Kalagosh, Afghanistan), emir of Afghanistan (1901-19). The eldest son of Abdor Rahman Khan, Habibullah succeeded peacefully to the throne after his father's death in October 1901. At the time, British India was deeply involved in Afghan affairs, and Habibullah agreed to accept British guidance in foreign affairs in return for an annual subsidy of £160,000. He was able to retain full control of his country's internal affairs. With the outbreak of World War I (1914-18), there was widespread support in Afghanistan of Ottoman Turkey against the British. Habibullah, however, was able to maintain a policy of noninvolvement throughout the war. He meanwhile moved to open Afghanistan to technology from the West, founding schools, a military academy, and a weekly newspaper. He also introduced electricity, automobiles, and Western medical methods to the country. Habibullah's antiwar policy was unpopular with the young anti-British elements in the population. In 1919 he was assassinated while on a hunting trip.\n\nHabijan, Damir (b. Jan. 4, 1982, Varazdin, Croatia), justice minister of Croatia (2024- ). He was also economy minister (2023-24).\n\nHabimana, Bonaventure, justice minister of Rwanda (1973-77).\n\nHabré\n\nHabré, Hissène, Hissène also spelled Hissen or Hissein (b. 1942, Largeau [now Faya-Largeau], northern Chad - d. Aug. 24, 2021, Dakar, Senegal), president of Chad (1982-90). He was entrusted by Pres. N'Garta Tombalbaye with a confidential mission to Abba Sidick, leader of the rebel Chad National Liberation Front (Frolinat). He went over to Frolinat and became \"leader of the Army of the North.\" In 1974 he first attracted international attention when he took hostage the French archaeologist Françoise Claustre, who was subsequently released on payment of a Fr 10 million ransom by the French government. He did not remain in command of Frolinat, however. In October 1976 he was ousted by another rebel leader, Goukouni Oueddei, with Libyan support. Habré, sometimes reported dead, escaped with some followers to The Sudan. He emerged in January 1978 as commander of part of Frolinat's forces, the Armed Forces of the North (FAN), and signed an accord with Pres. Félix Malloum at Khartoum, Sudan, leading to a ceasefire that was supported by Libya. However, this proved as ineffective as a ceasefire arranged in March between Oueddei and the Chad government, also with Libyan backing. On Aug. 29, 1978, he won sudden international respectability when Malloum appointed him premier of Chad. Habré resigned with Malloum in March 1979 after the Kano, Nigeria, agreement that put Oueddei at the head of a Transitional Government of National Union (GUNT). Habré was a minister in the GUNT until disagreement with Oueddei again forced him into exile in The Sudan. He returned at the head of the FAN in November 1981, when the final struggle for supremacy began. On June 7, 1982, the FAN entered the capital, N'Djamena; Habré was then in effective control of Chad, although the southern part of the country was not won over until September. He was overthrown in 1990 and went into exile in Senegal. In 2005 an investigating judge in Belgium charged Habré with crimes against humanity and torture and issued an international arrest warrant. He was arrested on November 15, but a Senegalese court disqualified itself from ruling on the Belgian government's request to extradite him on November 25; he was released and allowed to remain in Senegal until January 2006 when the African Union summit was to decide his fate. The summit set up a group of legal experts to consider the options for his trial; in July it was decided that he be tried in Senegal. A court in Chad sentenced him to death in absentia in 2008. The Senegal trial opened in 2015; in 2016 he was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nHabsburg(-Lothringen), Gabriela (Maria Charlotte Felicitas Elisabeth Antonia) von (b.

March 8, 1937, Gasiza, Ruanda-Urundi [now in Rwanda] - d. April 6, 1994, near Kigali, Rwanda), president of Rwanda (1973-94). In 1960 he began training for the National Guard in Kigali. Although he was a member of the Hutu majority ethnic group, he proved to be an effective officer against insurgents from both the Hutu and the Tutsi minority. He rapidly rose through the ranks, becoming chief of staff (1963-65) and then minister of defense and police chief of staff (1965-73). In April 1973 he was promoted to major general; three months later he led a group of disgruntled Hutu officers in the overthrow of Pres. Grégoire Kayibanda. Habyarimana initially banned all political activity. In 1975 he established the National Revolutionary Movement for Development, with himself as sole leader of the single-party state. He gradually allowed more civilian involvement, however, and after the country's first multiparty elections in 1992, he was forced to relinquish some power to the new Tutsi prime minister. Habyarimana and Pres. Cyprien Ntaryamira, the Hutu leader of neighbouring Burundi, were returning from ongoing peace talks between the two ethnic groups when their plane was shot down. The death of the two Hutu presidents under suspicious circumstances ignited the simmering tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi and led to the massacres and the mass exodus from Rwanda.\n\nHácha\n\nHácha, Emil (Dominik Josef) (b.

Jan. 14, 1984, Marj `Ayun, Lebanon), Lebanese militia leader. Haddad, an officer in the Lebanese army, formed his own militia force from Christian and Shi`ah Muslim troops after the collapse of the government in 1976. His militia group controlled the southern part of Lebanon with Israeli support from 1978 to 1982. Israel considered him a useful ally against the Palestinians, and his militia group was responsible for helping to curb Palestinian guerrilla infiltration into northern Israel and serving as a network that informed Israel on activity in the area. After 1982 and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the \"Free Republic of Lebanon\" declined in importance as Israel realized Haddad's inability to guarantee the area against attack from Palestinian guerrillas. On Sept. 16, 1982, a massacre of hundreds of Palestinian men, women, and children occurred at Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in West Beirut. Haddad's military force was implicated but was cleared of responsibility in 1983. The same year the Israelis wanted Haddad's militia integrated into the Lebanese army, and, though the Lebanese government agreed, they would not allow Haddad to serve as the ranking commander in southern Lebanon. Haddad was reinstated to the Lebanese army in January 1984, shortly before his death.\n\nHaddam\n\nHaddam, Tedjini, Arabic al-Tijani Haddam (b. Jan. 11, 1921, Tlemcen, Algeria - d.

Ali Abdullah Saleh during June-September 2011, after the latter was injured in an attack on the presidential palace during the \"Arab Spring,\" and again intermittently from November 2011, when Saleh signed an agreement that provided for him to retain only the \"honorary\" presidency for three months; while leaving most business to Hadi, Saleh still occasionally exercised presidential authority (including in January 2012 when he made Hadi a field marshal) until definitely leaving office in February 2012 following \"elections\" in which Hadi was the single candidate. Amid a new crisis following the entry of Houthi rebels into Sana in 2014, Hadi resigned in January 2015, but this was not accepted by parliament and he was still in office when in February the Houthis took control. He escaped to Aden, where he withdrew his resignation and set up a counter-government. He enjoyed international recognition and military support from Saudi Arabia, but could not dislodge the Houthis, who joined forces with Saleh, from control of the northwestern part of the country.

March 1903, Uskub, Ottoman Empire [now Skopje, North Macedonia]), Ottoman official. He was governor of Basra (1892-93), Kosovo (1893-1900, 1903), and Tripoli (1900-03).\n\nHáfoss, Kristina (b. June 26, 1975, Copenhagen, Denmark), finance minister of the Faeroe Islands (2015-19) and secretary-general of the Nordic Council (2021- ).\n\nH. Hafstein\n\nHafstein, Hannes (Thórdur Pétursson) (b. Dec. 4, 1861, Mödruvellir, Iceland - d. Dec. 13, 1922, Reykjavík, Iceland), minister of Iceland (1904-09, 1912-14). The son of a provincial governor, he was elected to the Althing in 1901 and soon became the leader of the Home Rule Party. It was chiefly because of his influence that Denmark consented in 1903 to the transfer of the residency of the minister for Icelandic affairs from Copenhagen to Reykjavík. Appointed to this office in 1904, he inaugurated a new era of practical reforms: Iceland's cable connections with abroad, internal telephone system, and first reafforestation and land-reclamation acts, as well as much educational progress, were due to him. Dissatisfaction over the union with Denmark led to his defeat at the general election of 1908, whereupon he resigned; but after the victory of the Home Rule Party in 1911, he became president of the Althing, and then again minister, in 1912. He had to resign again, however, in 1914, after new and fruitless efforts to achieve national unity over the union problem. Two years later he retired from public service. He was also noted as a poet.\n\nJ. Hafstein\n\nHafstein, Jóhann (Henning) (b. Sept. 19, 1915, Akureyri, Iceland - d. May 15, 1980), prime minister of Iceland (1970-71). He was also justice minister (1961 [acting], 1963-70).\n\nHaftar, Khalifa (Bilqasim) (b. 1943, Ajdabiya, Libya), Libyan military commander. He entered Benghazi's military academy in 1961 and took part in Muammar al-Qaddafi's coup against King Idris in 1969. In 1980, Qaddafi promoted Haftar to colonel and sent him to fight in Chad. He was captured by the Chadians in 1987. Qaddafi refused to acknowledge the existence of Libyan POWs, infuriating Haftar, who upon release defected from the Libyan army. Backed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), he formed the Libyan National Army as the military wing of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya to overthrow Qaddafi. After his Chadian host, Pres. Hissène Habré, was overthrown in 1990 and his successor, Idriss Déby, wanted good relations with Qaddafi, Haftar lived for a while in Zaire, but soon was resettled in the U.S. He returned to Libya in March 2011 when rebels in Benghazi formed a National Transitional Council (NTC). However, the NTC systematically withheld key posts from opponents of the regime who had lived abroad. Later in the year Qaddafi was overthrown and killed. With the backing of some 150 army officers and soldiers, he was named armed forces chief of staff in 2012, but this was not formalized by the NTC. In February 2014, he called in a televised statement on Libyans to overthrow the elected parliament. Backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, Haftar launched a military campaign in May against what he called \"terrorists\" in Benghazi and Tripoli. On June 4, he survived an assassination attempt and disappeared from sight. After Islamists seized Tripoli in August, forcing parliament to flee to the country's far east, the recognized authorities gradually allied themselves with a figure previously seen as a power-hungry renegade. In March 2015, he was named head of the Libyan army loyal to the recognized House of Representatives. In 2016 he visited Russia, which agreed to supply him with weapons and military equipment to fight the \"Islamic State\" group's branch in Libya. He rejected the United Nations-backed transitional Government of National Accord set up in Tripoli in 2016, dismissing it as beholden to local militias. He proclaimed the successful \"liberation\" of Benghazi in July 2017. In 2019-20 his forces besieged Tripoli, but with military support from Turkey the government forces drove him back.\n\nHagaman, Frank L(eslie) (b. June 1, 1894, Bushnell, Ill. - d.

Hague\n\nHague of Richmond, William (Jefferson) Hague, Baron (b. March 26, 1961, Rotherham, Yorkshire), British politician. In February 1989 he was selected to contest a by-election in the \"safe\" Conservative seat of Richmond, North Yorkshire, and within two years he had become parliamentary private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer, Norman Lamont. When Prime Minister John Major appointed him secretary of state for Wales in 1995, the 34-year-old Hague became Britain's youngest cabinet minister since Harold Wilson in 1947. In May 1997, following the party's heavy defeat by the revived Labour Party under Tony Blair, Major announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader. One of the men widely expected to take over, Michael Portillo, had lost his seat in the election and was out of the running, while other contenders from the party's right wing had their detractors. Hague stood on a centre-right, Euroskeptic platform and finally won on the third ballot on June 19. The 36-year-old Hague thus became the youngest leader of a major political party in the U.K. in 200 years. He embarked immediately on radical changes designed to reverse the fortunes of a party that had just suffered its worst election defeat since 1906. In October, at his first party conference as Conservative leader, he sought to soften the party's image by declaring his support for more compassionate policies. He also advocated \"understanding and tolerance of people making their own decisions about how they lead their lives,\" including accepting the rights of people to have gay relationships or to bear and raise children outside marriage - a clear break with the strictly pro-family ethos of the Thatcher years. He resigned after the Conservatives suffered another crushing defeat in the 2001 election. Shadow foreign secretary under Conservative leader David Cameron from 2005, he became foreign secretary under Prime Minister Cameron in 2010-14, then was appointed first secretary of state and leader of the House of Commons. In 2015 he was made a life peer.\n\nHahn, Johannes (b. Dec. 2, 1957, Vienna, Austria), Austrian politician. He has been minister of science and research (2007-10) and justice (acting, 2008-09) and EU commissioner for regional policy (2010-14), European neighbourhood policy and enlargement negotiations (2014-19), and budget and administration (2019- ).\n\nHahn, Michael (b. Nov. 24, 1830, Klingenmünster, Bavaria [now in Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany] - d. March 5, 1886, Washington, D.C.), governor of (U.S.-controlled) Louisiana (1864-65).\n\nHaiba, Ahmed Saloum Ould, interior minister of Mauritania (1958-59). He was also minister of rural economy (1959-61).\n\nHaiba, Bacar Ould Sidi (b. 1936, Kaédi, Mauritania), defense minister of Mauritania (1968).\n\nHaidalla\n\nHaidalla, Mohamed Khouna Ould, Arabic Muhammad Khuna walad Hayd Allah (b. 1940, Río de Oro [now Western Sahara]), president of Mauritania (1980-84). He joined the army in 1962 and served in different parts of Mauritania, notably in Bir Moghrein where he was appointed chief of general staff following the coup on July 10, 1978, which overthrew the civilian regime of Pres. Moktar Ould Daddah. He became premier in succession to Lt.Col. Ahmed Ould Bouceif, who died in a plane crash in May 1979. Haidalla was considered to be at the same time a progressive, a fervent nationalist, and the supporter of a form of rapprochement with Algeria, where he went on an official visit in October 1980. When Lt.Col. Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Louly took over as head of state in June 1979, replacing Col. Mustafa Ould Salek, Haidalla, who became defense minister, was already seen as the \"strong man\" of the military government, and he played a crucial role in the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Algiers and Nouakchott in August 1979. Visiting France in September 1979, he strove to win increased support for Mauritania's independence and sovereignty. In a palace revolution on Jan. 4, 1980, Haidalla seized power from Louly, replacing him as head of state and of the Military Committee for National Salvation. He retained the posts of premier and defense minister. In June 1980 he expressed his support for recognition of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (Western Sahara) by the Organization of African Unity, and in September he welcomed a delegation of the Saharan Polisario Front to Nouakchott. On July 5, he officially abolished slavery. In 1984, while Haidalla was out of the country, Lt.Col. Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya seized power in a coup. Haidalla was a presidential candidate in the Nov. 7, 2003, elections. He was arrested on November 9, on suspicion of plotting a coup, and released after receiving a suspended five-year prison sentence on December 28.\n\nJ. Haider\n\nHaider, Jörg (b. Jan. 26, 1950, Bad Goisern, Oberösterreich, Austria - d. Oct. 11, 2008, Klagenfurt, Kärnten, Austria), Austrian politician. He became chairman of the youth organization of the Freedom Party (FPÖ) in 1970, chairman of the party in Kärnten in 1983, and in 1986 chairman of the national FPÖ, which under his leadership steadily gained ground at the expense of the traditional parties - the Social Democrats (SPÖ) and the People's Party (ÖVP) - to become Europe's most successful far-right group. In 1989, the FPÖ formed a coalition with the ÖVP in Kärnten, and he became premier of the state. Forced to resign in 1991 after he made several controversial statements including praising the \"decent employment policies\" in Nazi Germany, he bounced back to make a strong showing in national and European elections. He virulently denounced immigration, but his most controversial views involved statements about Hitler and the Nazis. In 1995, for example, he praised members of the Waffen-SS, calling them \"decent people of good character.\" At times in 1998 he was almost a figure of fun as the party became enmeshed in scandal, but he again confounded the skeptics when his party came first in elections in Kärnten in March 1999, and he became premier again. In national elections held on Oct. 3, 1999, the FPÖ (27%) edged the ÖVP for second place. After attempts to renew the SPÖ-ÖVP coalition failed, on Feb. 4, 2000, an ÖVP-FPÖ coalition took office. Although ÖVP leader Wolfgang Schüssel became chancellor and Haider stayed in Kärnten, the inclusion of the FPÖ in the government resulted in Austria being ostracized in the EU for months. Haider announced his resignation as party chairman on Feb. 28, 2000, allegedly in order to fully apply himself to his work as premier of Kärnten. On April 4, 2005, he announced the formation a new party, Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), which was launched on April 17 with him as chairman. In November he again announced he would leave federal politics; after a two-year break (2006-08) he returned as BZÖ chairman but six weeks later died in a car accident.\n\nHaider, Moinuddin (b. June 5, 1942, Delhi, India), governor of Sindh (1997-99) and interior minister of Pakistan (1999-2002).\n\nR.F. Haider\n\nHaider (Khan), Raja Farooq (b. Jan. 14, 1955, Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir), prime minister of Azad Kashmir (2009-10, 2016-21).\n\nHaiduk, Vitaliy (Anatoliyovych) (b. July 19, 1957, Khlebodarovka [now Khlibodarivka], Donetsk oblast, Ukrainian S.S.R.), a deputy prime minister of Ukraine (2002-03). He was also minister of fuel and energy (2001-02) and secretary of the National Security and Defense Council (2006-07).\n\nA. Haig\n\nHaig, Alexander (Meigs, Jr.) (b. Dec. 2, 1924, Bala Cynwyd, near Philadelphia, Pa. - d. Feb. 20, 2010, Baltimore, Md.), U.S. secretary of state (1981-82). In 1947 he entered the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant, and in 1966-67 he commanded a battalion and brigade in the war in Vietnam. He served as supreme allied commander in Europe from 1974 to 1979. When Pres. Ronald Reagan named Haig to be his secretary of state, he chose a man who seemed admirably qualified by training and temperament. He previously served as assistant to Henry Kissinger on the National Security Council and as White House chief of staff in the final 20 months of the Nixon administration. But in spite of this previous top-level experience, Haig's time at the Department of State was marked more by tension than by triumph. Tension between the White House, Haig, and the Department of State built up in a series of incidents that began on inauguration day, when Haig submitted a plan to organize decision-making with regard to foreign policy. To longtime Reagan loyalists this looked like a naked power play, and Haig received a setback when the president named Vice-Pres. George Bush to be the foreign policy \"crisis manager.\" Haig reportedly was ready to resign but then proclaimed his willingness to be a team player on the Reagan squad. A major flap occurred when Haig announced on television that he was \"in control\" of the government while Bush was flying back to Washington after President Reagan was wounded in an assassination attempt. Within the cabinet there was occasional disagreement between Haig and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger on a number of issues.\n\nHaig, Sir Harry Graham (b. April 13, 1881, London, England - d. June 14, 1956, Oxted, Surrey, England), governor of the United Provinces (of Agra and Oudh) (1934-39); knighted 1933.\n\nHaight, Henry H(untly) (b. May 20, 1825, Rochester, N.Y. - d. Sept. 2, 1878, San Francisco, Calif.), governor of California (1867-71).\n\nHaikal, Yusuf (b. Aug. 15, 1912 - d. 1989), Jordanian diplomat. He was minister (1949-53) and ambassador (1957-58, 1959-62) to the United States, permanent representative to the United Nations (1957-58), and ambassador to France (1962-64) and Taiwan (1964-65).\n\nHaile, William (b. May 1807, Putney, Vt. - d. July 22, 1876, Keene, N.H.), governor of New Hampshire (1857-59).\n\nHaile Menkerios Drar (b. Oct. 1, 1946), Eritrean diplomat. He was ambassador to Ethiopia (1993-96) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1997-2001). As a South African citizen, he became UN special representative for Sudan (2010-11), UN special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan (2011-16), and head of the UN Office to the African Union (2013-18).\n\nHaile Selassie\n\nHaile Selassie (also spelled Hayle Selasse), \"common\" name Tafari Makonnen (or Tafari Makwannen) (b. July 23, 1892, Ejarsagoro, near Harer, Ethiopia - d. Aug. 27, 1975, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), emperor of Ethiopia (1930-74). He was a great-grandson of Sahle Selassie of Shewa and a son of Ras Makonnen, a chief adviser to Emperor Menelik II. Tafari at an early age impressed the emperor with his intellectual abilities and was promoted accordingly. As governor of Sidamo and then of Harer provinces, he followed progressive policies, seeking to break the feudal power of the local nobility by increasing the authority of the central government. In 1917-30 he was also foreign minister. In 1928 he assumed the title of negus (\"king\"), and two years later, when Empress Zauditu died, he was crowned emperor and took the throne name of Haile Selassie (\"Might of the Trinity\"), which was also his baptismal name. In 1931 he promulgated a new constitution, which strictly limited the powers of parliament. When Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, he led the resistance to the invaders, but in May 1936 he was forced into exile. In 1941 British and Ethiopian forces invaded Ethiopia and recaptured Addis Ababa. Reinstated as emperor, he once again began to implement social, economic, and educational reforms in an attempt to modernize Ethiopia on a slow and gradual basis. He played a major role in the establishment of the Organization of African Unity in 1963. In 1974 famine, worsening unemployment, and the political stagnation of his government prompted segments of the army to mutiny. They deposed Haile Selassie, who spent the remainder of his life a prisoner in his own palace. The official report of his death, which claimed natural causes, was without medical or legal confirmation and evidence later emerged suggesting that he had been strangled on the orders of the military government.\n\nHailemariam\n\nHailemariam Desalegn (Boshe) (b. July 19, 1965, Hombareka village, southern Ethiopia), foreign minister (2010-12) and prime minister (2012-18) of Ethiopia. In 2001-06 he was president of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples regional state. He was chairman of the African Union in 2013-14.\n\nHailes, Patrick George Thomas Buchan-Hepburn, (1st) Baron (b. April 2, 1901, Smeaton Hepburn, East Lothian, Scotland - d. Nov. 5, 1974, London, England), governor-general of the Federation of the West Indies (1958-62). He was also British minister of works (1955-57). He was created baron in 1957.\n\nHailey, (William) Malcolm Hailey, (1st) Baron (b. Feb. 15, 1872, Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, England - d. June 1, 1969, London, England), chief commissioner of Delhi (1912-18) and governor of Punjab (1924-28) and the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (1928-30, 1931-33, 1933-34). He was knighted in 1922 and created baron in 1936.\n\nHailsham, Douglas McGarel Hogg, (1st) Viscount (b. Feb. 28, 1872, London, England - d. Aug. 16, 1950, Carter's Corner Place, Sussex, England), British politician. He served as attorney general (1922-24, 1924-28), lord chancellor (1928-29, 1935-38), secretary of state for war (1931-35), and lord president of the council (1938).\n\nHailsham (of St. Marylebone), Quintin McGarel Hogg, Baron (b. Oct. 9, 1907, London, England - d. Oct. 12, 2001, London), British politician. He was the elder son of Viscount Hailsham. In 1938 he was elected to represent Oxford in the House of Commons. He fought in World War II until he was wounded in the leg and returned to Parliament. When his father died in 1950, he inherited the title, which consigned him to what he called the \"political ghetto\" of the House of Lords, the unelected upper house. He served as first lord of the Admiralty (1956-57) in Anthony Eden's government during the Suez crisis. He renounced his title in 1963 when he had a chance of succeeding Harold Macmillan as prime minister, but lost out to Alec Douglas-Home. He served in both their governments, as lord president of the council (1957-59, 1960-64), lord privy seal (1959-60), and secretary of state for education and science (1964). In 1970, he became Edward Heath's lord chancellor (chief of the judiciary) and became Lord Hailsham again, when he was made a life baron. He kept the office until 1974, but when Margaret Thatcher took power in 1979 she made him again lord chancellor and he served in the post a total of 12 years. He retired from the cabinet in 1987 with a kiss on the cheek from Thatcher at the door of 10 Downing Street. She told him \"you have graced every office that you have held with supreme distinction and style.\" But he remained an active and colourful member of the House of Lords, and was reprimanded for \"intervening from a sedentary position in a loud and boisterous way\" during a 1993 debate. Apparently unabashed by the rebuke, he was said to have gone about the chamber the next day singing \"Land of Hope and Glory\" in a loud and sarcastic manner. One of Britain's unforgettable political figures, he seemed to enjoy defying convention, dressing in old-fashioned buttoned boots and a bowler hat, and riding a bicycle around London.\n\nHailu Yimenu (d. June 2, 1991, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), acting prime minister of Ethiopia (1989-91). He committed suicide after staying a few days at the Italian embassy following the fall of Pres. Mengistu Haile Mariam's regime.\n\nHaimbe, Mulambo (Hamakuni) (b. May 12, 1976), justice minister (2021-24) and foreign minister (2023- ) of Zambia.\n\nHaines, Daniel (b. Jan. 6, 1801, New York City - d. Jan. 26, 1877, Hamburg, N.J.), governor of New Jersey (1843-45, 1848-51); grandnephew of Aaron Ogden.\n\nHaines, Janine (b. May 8, 1945, Tanunda, S.Aus. - d. Nov. 20, 2004, Adelaide, S.Aus.), Australian politician. She became the first member of the Australian Democrats represented in Canberra when she was chosen by the South Australian parliament to fill a Liberal Movement casual Senate vacancy from December 1977. (The Australian Democrats had been founded that year following the demise of the Liberal Movement.) She was elected as the second leader of the Australian Democrats in 1986, becoming the first woman in Australia to lead a significant political party and the first of five women to lead the Democrats. Her trademark glasses and commonsense approach made her a popular and admired leader, and she made a bid to shift to the House of Representatives in the environment-dominated election of 1990, risking everything to contest Kingston, a marginal Labor seat in South Australia. The Democrats polled their highest vote ever, but Haines lost. Having pledged to not seek to return to the Senate, her parliamentary career ended. Her position in the Senate was taken by Meg Lees and Janet Powell was elected to the party leadership.\n\nHaines, John M(ichener) (b. Jan. 1, 1863, Jasper county, Iowa - d. June 4, 1917, Boise, Idaho), governor of Idaho (1913-15).\n\nHaines, Stafford Bettesworth (b. 1802 - d.

Feb. 26, 1940, Vienna), president of Austria (1920-28). A liberal scholar and political-social activist with many public interests, he became a member of the Austrian parliament in 1909. He vigorously supported universal and female suffrage and popular education during the last years of the Habsburg empire. Throughout World War I and thereafter, he also advocated Anschluss (the incorporation of German Austria into a greater Germany). Despite his sombre postwar hopes for the fledgling Austrian republic, Hainisch, who was not concerned with party politics, was elected its first federal president in December 1920, as a compromise candidate who might be able to reconcile the hostile groups. He applied himself chiefly to the economic problem facing Austria. He incurred the wrath of his Anschluss co-supporters for his part in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lana with Czechoslovakia (1922), an agreement primarily directed against the possibilities of a Habsburg restoration but that also was seen as a barrier to Austrian-German union. He was reelected in 1924. Prohibited constitutionally from seeking a third presidential term in 1928, he subsequently served briefly (1929-30) as federal minister of commerce. He endorsed the Anschluss when it finally occurred in 1938.\n\nHaitham, Muhammad Ali (b. 1940, Dathina state, Western Aden Protectorate [now in Yemen] - d.

In the Prague Spring of 1968, Hájek supported the reformist forces that came to power, and that year he was appointed foreign minister. When a Warsaw Pact army invaded in August, Hájek was on vacation in Yugoslavia. He traveled to the UN and denounced the invasion but resisted Western involvement. After returning to Prague he was forced to resign. In 1970 he was purged from the party. In 1977 he was one of the original signatories of the human rights appeal known as Charter 77 and emerged as one of the group's leading spokespersons.

In this post he took a parachute jump before deciding that sky diving should be regulated, desegregated all U.S. air terminals, and championed development of the SST (supersonic transport) program. In 1969, he began a stormy four-year tenure as chief executive of Pan American World Airways. He introduced the first fleet of Boeing 747s, but the company lost money and he clashed with founder Juan Trippe before his ouster in 1973.

He became impressed with Richard M. Nixon during the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings in 1948 and offered his assistance on Nixon's 1952 vice presidential election campaign on the Republican Party ticket. Nixon refused the offer, but Haldeman finally managed to get hired for the 1956 election campaign and became a trusted aide. He managed Nixon's ill-fated attempt to become governor of California in 1962 and Nixon's second campaign for the presidency in 1968. During Nixon's first term, Haldeman served as chief of staff, determining access to the president and running the White House in such an efficient manner as to be often referred to as \"the keeper of the gate\" and \"the Iron Chancellor.\" Following the June 17, 1972, break-in at Democratic National Headquarters at the Watergate complex, Haldeman participated in the White House cover-up of official involvement in that event as well as other \"dirty tricks\" employed during the 1972 campaign. On April 30, 1973, after his role in the cover-up had been revealed, Haldeman was forced to resign. He returned to his home in California but in 1975 was convicted of perjury, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice for his role in the scandal.

Hale\n\nHale, John Parker (b. March 31, 1806, Rochester, N.H. - d. Nov. 19, 1873, Dover, N.H.), U.S. politician. After a term in the New Hampshire state legislature, he was in 1834 appointed U.S. district attorney, a position he held until 1841. The following year the Democrats elected him to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he took sides with the opponents of slavery. The Democrats nominated another candidate in 1846, and he returned to the state legislature, where he was chosen speaker, and his bold defiance of the party leaders attached to him so many independents that he was chosen U.S. senator. He took his seat as the first, and at that time the only, senator elected on the anti-slavery platform. His major achievement as a senator was the passage of a bill abolishing flogging in the Navy. His prominence in the anti-slavery movement led to his receiving the presidential nomination of the Liberty Party in 1847. Hale withdrew his candidacy the following year, when the Free Soil Party absorbed the Liberty Party and ran Martin Van Buren for president. In 1852, however, Hale was the Free Soil candidate and garnered over 150,000 votes, of which 440 were from the slave states. At the expiration of his senatorial term in 1853, the Democrats, who had gained control of the New Hampshire legislature, replaced him. In 1855 he was elected to fill the unexpired term of a deceased New Hampshire senator, and in 1858 he won reelection to a full term in the Senate. By this time he had switched to the new Republican Party and was regarded as one of its leaders. In 1865 Pres. Abraham Lincoln, shortly before his assassination, appointed Hale minister to Spain. Hale did not do well as a diplomat, however, and he was recalled in 1869.\n\nHale, Samuel W(hitney) (b. April 2, 1823, Fitchburg, Mass. - d.

In 1949, he was convicted under the Smith Act on false charges of \"conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government by force and violence.\" He jumped bail after his arrest and fled to Mexico, where he was arrested and sent back. He spent 8½ years, most of the 1950s, in jail. He was elected Communist Party general secretary in 1959 after his release from prison. He was the party's presidential candidate in 1972, 1976, 1980, and 1984; he never even garnered 1% of the vote, which he blamed on election law requirements which kept him off the ballot in half the states in 1984. He bitterly lamented the dissolution of Communist societies in eastern Europe and the dismantling of the Soviet Union, calling Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Russian president Boris Yeltsin \"a wrecking crew.\" But he never repudiated his beliefs. Hall was general secretary of the party until 1987, when the party reorganized and made him chairman. He served in that capacity until March 2000, when he was named senior chairman.\n\nHall, Harriet (b. Dec. 24, 1969), acting governor of the Falkland Islands (2006).\n\nHall, Hiland (b.

March 29, 1982, Stuttgart, West Germany), West German politician. In 1948 he met Konrad Adenauer, who in 1951 appointed him to the Foreign Ministry, where he worked for the improvement of Franco-German relations. He led the West German delegation to the talks that set up the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), a forerunner of the Common Market. His name was associated with the \"Hallstein Doctrine,\" which called for the breaking of diplomatic relations with any country other than the U.S.S.R. that recognized East Germany. He also headed the German delegation at the Messina Conference of 1955, which led directly to the formation of the European Economic Community (EEC) three years later. As the first president of the EEC Commission (1958-67) he found himself in confrontation with French president Charles de Gaulle, who had come to power only months after the Community was formed. De Gaulle, a nationalist determined to establish French supremacy in the EEC, was firmly opposed to any move toward political unity among its members and despised the Commission's \"technocrats.\" In 1965 Hallstein attempted to persuade France to agree to the strengthening of the Community institutions, and in protest the French withdrew from most EEC activities for several months, causing the most serious crisis in the Community since its creation. When the previously separate bodies of the EEC, ECSC, and Euratom were merged in a single EC Commission in 1967, he anticipated French opposition and resigned. He served as a member of the Bundestag (West German parliament; 1969-72) and was president of the European Movement (1968-74).\n\nHalonen\n\nHalonen, Tarja (Kaarina) (b. Dec. 24, 1943, Helsinki, Finland), president of Finland (2000-12). She is a former 1960s radical and a leading figure on the left of the Social Democratic Party. In the early 1980s she was chairwoman of the gay-rights organization SETA. A member of parliament since 1979, she was minister of justice in 1990-91 and became Finland's first female foreign minister in 1995. Halonen won a cliffhanger election against opposition leader Esko Aho on Feb. 6, 2000, to become Finland's first woman president. She promised to work for increased equality between the sexes. She refused during the campaign to marry her long-time male companion (she did so in August 2000) or mend fences with the church to please conservative voters. Halonen became head of state just as the country adopted a new constitution clipping the president's powers, especially in domestic affairs, where parliament's role was bolstered. The president remained in charge of foreign policy, but now was obliged by the constitution to conduct foreign affairs in close cooperation with the cabinet. Analysts said Halonen had the experience and personal political clout to use even the pared-down presidential powers effectively and not be a mere figurehead. She was reelected in 2006.\n\nHalsbury, Hardinge (Stanley) Giffard, (1st) Earl of (b. Sept. 3, 1823, London, England - d. Dec. 11, 1921, London), British lord chancellor (1885-86, 1886-92, 1895-1905). He was also solicitor general (1875-80). He was knighted in 1875 and created Baron Halsbury in 1885 and Earl of Halsbury and Viscount Tiverton in 1898.\n\nHalstead, Eric Henry (b. May 26, 1912, Auckland, N.Z. - d. June 18, 1991), New Zealand politician. He was minister of social security (1954-56) and industries, commerce, and customs (1956-57), ambassador to Thailand and Laos (1970-73), and ambassador to Italy, Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yugoslavia and high commissioner to Malta (1976-80).\n\nHalverson, Bob, byname of Robert George Halverson (b. Oct. 22, 1937, Springvale, Vic. - d. Feb. 9, 2016, Holbrook, near Albury, N.S.W.), speaker of the Australian House of Representatives (1996-98).\n\nHalvorsen, Kristin (b. Sept. 2, 1960, Horten, Vestfold, Norway), finance minister of Norway (2005-09). She was also leader of the Socialist Left Party (1997-2012) and minister of education (2009-13).\n\nHalvorsen, Otto Bahr (b. May 28, 1872, Christiania [now Oslo], Norway - d. May 23, 1923, Kristiania [now Oslo]), prime minister and justice minister of Norway (1920-21, 1923). He was also chairman of the Conservative Party (1919-23) and president of the Storting (1919-20, 1922-23).\n\nHamácek\n\nHamácek, Jan (b. Nov. 4, 1978, Mladá Boleslav, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic]), interior minister and a deputy prime minister (2018-21) and acting foreign minister (2018, 2021) of the Czech Republic. He was also speaker of the Chamber of Deputies (2013-17).\n\nHamad, Hamad Tawfiq (b. 1906 - d. 1980), finance minister of Sudan (1954-56). He was also minister of communications (1956) and commerce and industry (1956-58).\n\nHamad, (Maalim) Seif Sharif, Sharif also spelled Shariff (b. Oct. 22, 1943, Pemba island, Zanzibar [now in Tanzania] - d. Feb. 17, 2021, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania), chief minister (1984-88) and first vice president (2010-19, 2020-21) of Zanzibar. He was presidential candidate for the Civic United Front in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 (boycotting the re-run in 2016) and for ACT-Wazalendo in 2020. He was also chairman of the General Assembly of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (1997-2001).\n\nHamad ibn Isa\n\nHamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa, Sheikh (b. Jan. 28, 1950, Rifa`a, Bahrain), emir (1999-2002) and king (2002- ) of Bahrain. The eldest son of Sheikh Isa, Sheikh Hamad studied in Bahrain and abroad and became a qualified helicopter pilot in 1978. He had been a permanent member of the Helicopter Club of Great Britain. He built a well-trained army in Bahrain despite the Gulf Arab island's limited financial resources and small population. Crown prince since 1964, he was commander of Bahrain's national guard before the creation of an army force after the island gained independence in 1971 from Britain. He then became Bahrain's first defense minister (1971-88). Bahrain's armed forces - under his command - joined an international alliance led by the United States to help drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in 1991. But other than that Bahrain's 8,000-strong army has never been engaged in a war. Even when Qatari troops landed on a small disputed Gulf island in 1986, Saudi Arabia stepped in to defuse the crisis. Bahrain and Qatar are locked in a long-standing border dispute over small but potentially oil- and gas-rich islands, including Hawar island, located near Qatar's northwestern coast and controlled by Bahrain since the 1930s. Sheikh Hamad is committed to the alliance with five other Gulf Arab states grouped together under the Gulf Cooperation Council. In 2002 he proclaimed himself king and his state a constitutional monarchy, and called for legislative elections, the first since the parliament was dissolved in 1975; women would be allowed to vote and run for office. Sheikh Hamad has three sons (the eldest, Sheikh Salman, who was appointed deputy defense minister in 1995; Abdullah; and Khalifa) and two daughters.\n\nHamad ibn Khalifa Al Thani, Sheikh (b. 1952, Doha, Qatar), defense minister (1977-95), emir (1995-2013), and prime minister (1995-96) of Qatar; son of Sheikh Khalifa ibn Hamad Al Thani. After graduating from Sandhurst Military Academy in England in 1971, he became a lieutenant colonel in Qatar's military. He was promoted in 1975 to major general and commander in chief of the armed forces, and in 1977 he became minister of defense as well as heir apparent to the throne. In 1992 he took over the day-to-day running of the country, and in 1995 he staged a coup and ousted his father while the latter was traveling outside the country. He even went as far as freezing his exiled father's assets to prevent any counter-coups, of which there was only one serious attempt. By 2000 Hamad had instituted a number of policies that had transformed the country. He moved to allow Qataris to participate more actively in the government and to promote greater equality for women. After becoming ruler he announced plans to establish an elected parliament, appointed a committee to draft a permanent constitution, largely abolished censorship of the press, and in 1999 held the country's first open general elections for a municipal council. For the first time, women not only were allowed to vote but, even more revolutionary, were also allowed to run for office. One reform that thrust Qatar into the international spotlight was the establishment in 1996 of the country's satellite television network, Al Jazeera (\"The Peninsula\"). The network was likened to an \"Arab CNN.\" It created a rare forum for uncensored news and debate, much to the delight of its viewers and to the displeasure of many Arab rulers. Some leaders, finding their policies under attack, on occasion moved to block their residents' access to the programming. Hamad himself went as far as to vocally support the Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2011. In an unusual move for the region, he abdicated in 2013 in favour of his son Crown Prince Tamim.\n\nHamada, Keizo (b. Jan. 10, 1952), governor of Kagawa (2010-22).\n\nHamada, Kunimatsu (b. April 2 [March 10, lunar calendar], 1868, Ujiyamada, Ise province [now Ise city, Mie prefecture], Japan - d. Sept. 6, 1939), Japanese politician. He was speaker of the House of Representatives (1934-36).\n\nHamada, Seiji (b. Jan. 23, 1963, Shimanto, Kochi, Japan), governor of Kochi (2019- ).\n\nHamada, Yasukazu (b. Oct. 21, 1955, Futtsu, Chiba, Japan), defense minister of Japan (2008-09, 2022-23).\n\nHamadi, Hamadi (Ould Baba) Ould (b. Dec. 31, 1948, Moudjéria, Mauritania), defense minister (2009-11) and foreign minister (2011-13) of Mauritania. He was also minister of fisheries and maritime economy (2013-14).\n\nHamadi, Ibrahim Muhammad al- (b. 1943 - d. [assassinated] Oct. 11, 1977, Sana, Yemen), president of Yemen (Sana) (1974-77). He was also deputy prime minister (1971-72).\n\nHamadou, Barkat Gourad, Arabic Barkat Ghurad Hamadu (b. Jan. 1, 1930, Hanlé, Dikhil district, French Somaliland [now Djibouti] - d. March 17, 2018, Clamart, Hauts-de-Seine, France), prime minister of Djibouti (1978-2001). He was also minister of education (1960-63) and health (1963-66) of French Somaliland and ambassador to the Vatican (2001-18).\n\nHamaguchi\n\nHamaguchi, Osachi, also called Yuko Hamaguchi (b. May 1, 1870, Kochi, Tosa province, Japan - d. Aug. 26, 1931, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1929-31). He joined the Finance Ministry in 1895, where his abilities were soon recognized. In Taro Katsura's third cabinet he was vice-minister of communications and in the Shigenobu Okuma cabinet of 1914 he was vice-minister of finance. In 1914 he was also elected to the Diet (parliament), rising rapidly in the prominence of the Kensikai (later Minseito) party. He became finance minister in the government of Takaaki Kato (1924-26) and then minister of home affairs (1926, 1927). Soon he was elected president of the Minseito (Democratic Party), and in July 1929 he was made prime minister. He returned Japan to the gold standard at the beginning of 1930, and won reelection in February in one of the cleanest contests in the history of Japanese politics. But the world depression did not spare Japan and his policies became unpopular. In order to combat rising inflation, he promoted mechanization and rationalization of industry. The effects of the depression, however, deflated the Japanese economy even further than he had intended, and his measures led to great social unrest. Moreover, his plan to cut civil-service salaries was bitterly resisted. Finally, his attempts to force the military to yield to civilian leadership aroused right-wing disapproval. His acceptance of the terms of the London Naval Treaty limiting armaments was especially resented, and he was shot in the Tokyo Railway Station by a right-wing youth on Nov. 14, 1930. He at first survived, but had a relapse in April 1931, causing him to resign the office of prime minister, and died later that year.\n\nHamano, Seigo (b. April 28, 1898, Kamimikawa, Tochigi, Japan - d. 1990), justice minister of Japan (1974). He was also director-general of the Administrative Management Agency (1972).\n\nHamber, Eric Werge (b. April 21, 1879, Winnipeg, Man. - d. Jan. 10, 1960, Vancouver, B.C.), lieutenant governor of British Columbia (1936-41).\n\nC.J. Hambro\n\nHambro, Carl Joachim (b. Jan. 5, 1885, Bergen, Norway - d. Dec. 15, 1964, Oslo, Norway), Norwegian politician. He was elected to the Storting (parliament) in 1919 and was the president of the Storting from 1926. He was president of the League of Nations from 1939 to its abolition in 1946. When the air alarm sounded just after midnight April 9, 1940, Hambro took the initiative to transport the royal family, the government and all members of the Storting by a special train leaving Oslo at 7:30 AM. Just 3 hours before the train departed, the Norwegian foreign minister, Halvdan Koht, had told German ambassador Curt Bräuer that Norway would fight the German invasion. Thanks to Hambro's quick action he could chair the meetings of the Storting at Hamar at 12:30 PM the same day and Elverum at 9:20 PM the same evening. At this meeting Hambro suggested the \"Elverum Authorization\" whereby the Government was empowered to make such decisions as were deemed necessary for the sake of the future and safety of the country. This enabled Norway - even after its capitulation in Tromsø two months later - to continue the war against Germany from the refuge of the government and royal family in England and Canada. Hambro followed the government during its transfer to London on June 7, 1940, and continued himself to the U.S. on July 12, 1940, as the representative of Norway to the U.S. During his stay in the U.S. he was a delegate to the statutory general meeting of the United Nations in London in January 1946 and the General Assembly in New York in the fall of 1946.\n\nE.
