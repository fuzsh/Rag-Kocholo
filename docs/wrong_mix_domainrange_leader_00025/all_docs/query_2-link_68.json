        "text": "Abstract\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn 2006 the Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest daily paper in Japan, completed a year-long campaign to clarify Japanese leaders’ responsibility for World War II. Such an undertaking is rare in Japan. The campaign raised five questions: Why did Japan extend the lines of battle? Why did Japan go to war with the United States in spite of the extremely slim prospects for victory? What foolishness caused the Japanese military to employ suicide aircraft attacks? Were sufficient efforts made to bring the war to an end? And, what problems were there with the International Military Tribunal for the Far East? Our project team suggested answers to these questions and clarified who should be held responsible for the war. Throughout the project, we criticized Japan’s brutal militarism. At the same time, we made clear our view that those leaders who initiated the war betrayed Japan’s national interest. I believe that this project will be a cornerstone for future honest dialogue between Japan and its neighbors."
