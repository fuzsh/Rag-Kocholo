A centrist party, the Minseitō was controlled by politicians willing to deal with government bureaucrats for patronage and with business interests to gain funds.\n\nIn 1940 the government forced the Minseitō and the Rikken Seiyūkai to merge with the government-controlled Taisei Yokusankai (“Imperial Rule Assistance Association”). After 1945 a new Democratic Party was formed, which included many former Minseitō members."
