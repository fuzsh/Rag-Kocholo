Japanese authorities have arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, a 41-year-old man, and charged him of attempted murder, after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated on Friday.

Government officials said that the suspect had been a Maritime Self-Defence Force officer for three years until around 2005.

Yamagami told investigators he “had grievances” with the former prime minister and had decided to kill him. The gun used in the attack was apparently hand-made. Media footage showed an object with what looked like two barrels wrapped in black tape as the likely murder weapon.

Though high-ranking assassination attempts in Japan have been rare , they are not without precedent.

In 1921, Takashi Hara, the architect of the full-fledged party Cabinet system was stabbed to death at Tokyo Station by a young railway worker. Nine years later, a gunman attacked Prime Minister Osachi Hamaguchi at Tokyo Station. He died of his wounds the following year.

In 1932, Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai was also killed by a group of armed naval officers, who stormed the Premiers office. The killing is known as the famous “May 15 incident.”

There was also an attempt on the life of Abe’s grandfather, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi in 1960. Also in that year, a 17-year old fatally stabbed the head of Japan’s Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma.
