TASTE THE STARS "Come quickly, I am tasting the stars!" Don Perignon invented something he knew many would love. He invented greatness that could be shared and knew when he did so. TTS is NIMAR'S first official mixtape. After a substantial amount of time and effort, NIMAR was able to create a mixtape that would reflect his love of the STARS and life, CHAMPAGNE and good times, and the BEACH and serenity all in one mixtape for you to vibe out and relate to. CHEERS to a little bit of greatness and a splash of stars (or clicquot) for you to enjoy. Executive Producer: @iLuhvMoolah Co-Producer: @ChrisBeach909 Follow @NIMAROFFICIAL on instagram & twitter
