Although he's played his share of pretty boys throughout the 2000s, Kyle Searles has also shown off his talent alongside some of the best young actors of his time. Indeed, one of his early appearances was in the 2003 series finale of "Dawson's Creek," an evening soap that had served as a spotting ground for future stars, including Katie Holmes and Michelle Williams. At around the same time, he was featured in the reality show "Moolah Beach"--a teen version of "Survivor"--where he was runner-up. He subsequently filmed the part of John Rowland, the gardener eventually seduced by Gabrielle Solis, in the pilot of the drama "Desperate Housewives"; unfortunately, he was a victim of recasting. Instead, he found his way to the family-friendly "7th Heaven" as Mac, a recurring supporting character. After that show ended in 2007, he appeared in two very different ensembles. First was "Swingtown," a drama set in turbulent '70s Chicago, featuring internationally acclaimed actors such as Jack Davenport (from the British sitcom "Coupling") and Molly Parker. He also co-starred from 2007 to 2008 in "South of Nowhere," a drama about teenagers dealing with vital social issues.
