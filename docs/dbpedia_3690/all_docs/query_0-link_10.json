        "text": "Beverly Mitchell (Lucy Camden)\n\nWhen Beverly Mitchell was discovered, she was making a scene. As a 4-year-old at the mall with her mom, she was in the middle of throwing an epic temper tantrum when a talent scout recognized her flair for melodrama.\n\nThe budding star debuted on television with \"Big Brother Jake\" and then landed her first film role. Soon after, she endeared us all by playing little Lucy Camden on \"7th Heaven\" while we watched her grow up as a Camden “P.K.” and marry a Kinkirk brother.\n\nBeverley Mitchell – Now\n\nThese days, Beverly Mitchell is a mom of three, side-by-side with her adored husband, Michael Cameron. With the recent arrival of baby number 3, she is in seventh heaven.\n\nShe was in \"Mean People Suck\" (2001) and joined the cast of \"The Secret Life of the American Teenager\" in 2010. In 2006, she debuted as a country music singer with the hit song “Angel.”\n\nGeoff Stults (Ben Kinkirk)\n\nGeoff Stults was a child actor who went to Australia to be a pro football player. \"7th Heaven,\" WB’s longest-running series, was one of his most prominent roles, and he portrayed Glen Oak firefighter Ben Kinkirk.\n\nGeoff grew up acting alongside his real-life brother George Stults, Ben Kinkirk’s brother Kevin on \"7th Heaven.\" Before starring in The WB drama series, Geoff appeared on \"Spin City\" and \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\"\n\nGeoff Stults – Now\n\nIn television, he’s also known for \"October Road\" and \"Happy Town.\" Geoff Stults played Mitch on the Netflix series \"Grace and Frankie.\" His latest film role is \"12 Strong\" (2018).\n\nMemorably, he starred in \"Wedding Crashers\" and \"She’s Out of My League.\" Most recently, he appears on\" Stargirl,\" the DC Comics-inspired television series.\n\nDavid Gallagher (Simon Camden)\n\nTeen Choice winner David Gallagher’s child acting career began at age 2. Before \"7th Heaven\" scooped him up, he was Mikey on \"Look Who’s Talking Now\" with John Travolta, starring as well on \"Phenomenon and Summer of Fear.\" He’s also loved for voicing Riku in the famous gaming world, \"Kingdom Hearts.\"\n\nAs one of the younger Camden’s, Simon is the adorable brother who begged God for a dog.
