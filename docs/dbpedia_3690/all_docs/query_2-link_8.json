Sweet little Norman, his years on earth were few but they filled a wide space in the hearts of those who loved him. Winsome and attractive in person, and of gentle, affectionate disposition. He was a favorite with his playmates and the life of a happy household. Only 8 years, and yet how much of gladness they brought to others, and how desolate the home now lacking the music of his voice, and the tribute of his childish caress. The family have the heartfelt sympathy of the entire community.\n\nCAHOOE, JOHN/Source: Alton Telegraph, December 16, 1897\n\nFrom Fosterburg â Old Uncle Johnny Cahooe, who has been a resident of this locality for many years, died and was buried last week.

She would have been 79 years of age December 19th. Mrs. Caldwell's death had been expected, as her condition had been bad for some time, and she had been unconscious for several days. Her home had been in Alton all her life. She was born here December 19, 1836, and was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ebenezer Marsh. After her preliminary schooling in Alton, she attended the Crowell ladies boarding school in St. Louis, completing her course of study there.

How he came to his death is not known. The message from that place simply says that he is dead and asks what disposition shall be made of the body. The relatives have decided to bring him back to Alton for burial. The body will probably arrive in Alton on Friday morning, if it is shipped at once.\n\nCaldwell is the man who committed the daring robberies in Alton several weeks ago, when he held up the Charles Hale Saloon and the J. H. Elfgen Saloon in a single evening, when both of the saloons were crowded. At the time he made away with over $100 in money. The police made a desperate effort to catch him at the time, because it was believed that he was insane and it was feared that he might do some damage. Nothing more has been heard from him since, although a search was made over the country for him. The two robberies were the most daring in the Alton records.\n\nCaldwell entered the saloon of Charles Hale at the corner of Fifth and Ridge Streets on the evening of the robbery, and asked that Charles Hale be called down from upstairs. When he was called down, Caldwell demanded that he hold up his hands as well as the ten other men in the saloon. After taking the money, he told Hale to turn his back. Hale started to run and make his getaway, as the gun clicked but did not go off. Then Caldwell made his getaway, and while the police were hurrying to that saloon, he went to the saloon of J. H. Elfgen at the corner of Broadway and Langdon, and asked to use the phone. When he got in a position where his gun would cover the entire crowd, he told them to throw up their hands and then proceeded to rob the till. A man from the Missouri Guards across the street saw the hands above the curtains of the saloon and rushed over. He fired a shot through the window at Caldwell, but the latter saw him and dropped behind the bar in time to save himself, and then crawled on his hands and knees out of the saloon and made his escape.\n\nArchie Caldwell Took Own Life\n\nSource: Alton Evening Telegraph, May 9, 1917\n\nCheyenne, Wyoming, May 9 - Archie Caldwell, aged 31, a member of a respected family in Alton, took his life here yesterday by shooting himself. For the past month he had been a fugitive from justice, having robbed two saloons in Alton. Caldwell left a note addressed to his mother, Mrs. Alexander Caldwell, of Fifth and Ridge Street, Alton, Illinois, in which he asked forgiveness for the trouble he had caused her and the other members of his family. Word was received in Alton yesterday that Caldwell was dead, but nothing was known at that time as to how he met his end. The body is to be brought to Alton for burial.\n\nSource: Alton Evening Telegraph, May 12, 1917\n\nThe funeral of Archie Caldwell will be held from the home of his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Caldwell, Sunday afternoon. The letter he wrote to his mother before shooting himself shows the remorse the young man felt for his deeds and misdoings. Burial will be in St. Joseph's Cemetery.\n\nNOTES:\n\nArchibald âArchieâ J. Caldwell was born in 1892 in Alton, and committed suicide May 8, 1917, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, after robbing two saloons in Alton. He was 24-25 years of age.

Caldwell, member of a prominent Alton family, died at 1 o'clock today at his residence, 1426 Henry street, after an illness that covered a period of fifteen years. The cause of his death was diabetes. During the long time that Mr. Caldwell had been afflicted with the malady, he continued active, and attended to the duties of the responsible position he held in the National Bank of Commerce in St. Louis. It was only in recent months that he gave up his work and was confined to his home, when he was no longer able to go about. Augustus Prescott Caldwell was born October 4, 1861. He passed almost all of his life in Alton. He was married to Miss Susan Forsythe of Harre, Ont., in December 1894. He leaves beside his wife, two children, Mary M., and Nelson F. Caldwell. For several years he was associated with the W. E. Schweppe Grocery Co in St. Louis, and after that business was discontinued he took a position with the National Bank of Commerce in St. Louis, in which he continued to serve until failing health six months ago forced him to give it up. He was not a member of the First Presbyterian Church, but was a regular attendant there with his family, and was deeply interested in the welfare of that church. He was a man who was most highly esteemed in his family, and his death, while looked for, is a sad blow to his relatives. He had been very near death for a week, and last Sunday it was not believed he would last through the night. He showed wonderful rallying powers, and even yesterday when it was thought he was dying, he rallied again. He was a very capable business man, and highly esteemed wherever he was engaged. The funeral will be held Friday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock from his late home. Friends are requested not to send flowers. Interment will be private.\n\nCALDWELL, BAILEY/Source: Alton Telegraph, July 4, 1878\n\nDied in Alton, June 30, of cholera infantum, Bailey, son of C. A. and A. M. Caldwell; aged six months.\n\nCALDWELL, CALVIN D./Source: Alton Telegraph, February 1, 1877\n\nAnother old and well-known citizen has passed away. On last Saturday morning, January 27, after a severe illness, Mr. Calvin D. Caldwell breathed his last. He had been in feeble health for some months, and finally contracted that dread disease, pneumonia, which completed its fatal work in a few days on a constitution already weakened by previous illness. Mr. Caldwell was born in Tennessee in the year 1815. He removed to Alton in the year 1837, where he has since resided, engaged in active business. No one of our merchants was better known or more highly esteemed than Mr. Caldwell, and none ranked higher for integrity, fair dealing, and uprightness of character. In all the relations of life, he discharged the duties incumbent upon him with zeal and fidelity. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church at the time of his death, having been connected therewith for many years. Quiet and unostentatious in his daily life, he was firm in his convictions and conscientious in all his actions. A good citizen and an upright man, his loss will be severely felt by a large circle of relatives and friends. Upon his wife and family, his death will fall as the greatest of bereavement. [Burial was in the Alton City Cemetery.]\n\nCALDWELL, CHARLES/Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, March 1, 1922\n\nYouth of 18 Is Electrocuted at Dairy\n\nThe fact that he had his rubber soled shoes repaired by tacking on leather soles was the reason for a fatal outcome of a contact by Charles Caldwell with an electric switch at the plant of the Walnut Grove dairy yesterday afternoon at 3:30 o'clock. The boy, who was the 18 year old son of David Caldwell, employed at the plant, accidentally touched the interior of a safety switch at a time when his hand was wet, and he was standing on a moist place on the floor in the dairy department. Even with all this, he might have escaped injury but for the fact that he had his worn out rubber soles repaired by use of leather, which furnished an excellent ground for his otherwise insulated body. According to officers of the plant, the lad had been around the plant off and on all of his life. His father has been employed there for many years. Recently he has been working steady in the plant. Yesterday afternoon he was standing near the open safety switch, the lid of which had been left ajar, and was leaning against the box. In some way his hand slipped down and came in contact with the points of the switch and he received the full effect of a 440-volt current. This would not have been fatal but for the fact that the young man's hand was wet, as he had just come from the cellar and was handling containers that were wet. When he came in contact with the switch point, he screamed and Jack Rowe, who was close by, made a dash for 20 feet and pulled the main switch to release the lad. It is said that he was in contact only a few seconds. Immediately when he was released from the electric current, he fell to the floor and apparently he died instantly. Efforts were made to revive him by the use of artificial respiration. Dr. Mather Pfeiffenberger said that when he arrived the lad's heart had ceased beating and it was too late to be of any service in reviving him. The father was out driving a wagon at the time the accident occurred to his son. The funeral will be held at two o'clock Thursday afternoon from the family home at 712 Ridge street, Rev. S. D. McKenny of the Cherry Street Baptist church will officiate. Interment will be in Oakwood cemetery.\n\nCALDWELL, CHARLES AUGUSTUS (HON.)/Source: Alton Telegraph, October 16, 1890\n\nAlton Mayor, President of the Alton Bank\n\nAt 5:30 oâclock a.m. Saturday, honored citizen and eminent business man entered into rest after a long and painful struggle. The disease that finally conquered was tumor of the stomach. For nearly a year, grave apprehensions have been felt as to the outcome. While at time, the buoyant spirits of the sufferer and the intense sympathy of friends begat strong hopes, yet ever the dark shadow seemed to grow darker, until the end came. Mr. Caldwell was taken ill last winter with the grippe, which undoubtedly aggravated the stomach trouble. He struggled manfully to overcome it, but it was evident to his most intimate associates that he was very ill. His last visit to the bank was on June 19, since which time his sufferings have been of the most intense character.\n\nMr. Caldwell was born in Ipswich, Massachusetts, January 7, 1823. At the age of 14, he went to Augusta, Maine, where he spent several years. In September 1850, he came to Alton to engage in business in the Alton Marine and Fire Insurance Co., an institution conducted by Dr. E. Marsh, Mr. Caldwell took a leading position at once in the management of the affairs of this company, and when it was succeeded by the Alton Bank in 1854, he became cashier, with Dr. Marsh as President. The bank at once took rank as one of the most substantial and best conducted institutions in the country. In the financial panic of 1857, three years after its organization, it stood the storm that burst on the country at that time, and emerged from it in excellent condition, something that very few institutions of the kind did. Again in the winter of 1860-61, when so many banks suspended or failed, the Alton Bank, under Mr. Caldwellâs able administration, passed unscathed, and was able to materially assist the Stateâs depleted treasury in arming troops for the defense of the nation. On the death of Dr. Marsh, the late Hon. Samuel Wade became President, and continued in that office until his death in 1885, when Mr. Caldwell succeeded to the Presidency, and Mr. E. P. Wade became cashier. Mr. Caldwell was president of the bank at the time of his death. The bank is, in a large degree, indebted to his sound financial judgment and his sterling honesty, for the position it holds, not only in the community, but in the country. The Alton Bank (organized as a National Bank in 1863) is a memorial to Mr. Caldwellâs excellent business principles. This can be justly said without taking one iota from the high praise due his associates, past and present, in the bank, and whoever found in him a wise counselor and safe leader. To Alton business men, Mr. Caldwell has ever been a friend, and much of the prosperity in business circles is due to the kindly hand extended when disaster was about to overtake, or had fallen upon the community. His name, wherever known, is the synonym of honesty and sound business principles.\n\nTo his family, his death comes with crushing effect. Only a few weeks ago, death entered the home and carried away a loved one, and now the head of the household is laid low. To the large family, he has raised in our midst, the loss of such a father is beyond words to express. Kind, generous, thoughtful of every interest in the household, desirous of making his wife and children as happy as possible, no effort was spared, no sacrifice was too great, and his chiefest joy was in having his family around him in the homestead, happy in each otherâs love. He was as much interested in the little details that go to make up happiness as many men are in what seems to be more important, realizing that after all, it was, in many cases, the small things that usually render heavier tasks of each performance.\n\nMr. Caldwell was elected mayor of Alton in 1873. He worthily and ably filled the position. He was elected without giving his consent to become a candidate, but a majority of the votes were cast for him, and as in every other position, he accepted the trust and performed the duties to the best of his high abilities.\n\nMr. Caldwell was married in Alton in 1857 to Miss Anna Marsh, daughter of the late Dr. E. Marsh, and president of the Alton Bank until his death. The fruit of this union was ten children, seven of whom still survive, four sons and three daughters. The loving wife, also surviving, and children have tenderly watched and ministered to the wants of the sick one, and hoped during the long weary days and nights for the best. While their eyes are filled with tears and their hearts riven with sorrow, the sympathy and affection of a large circle of relatives, friends, and acquaintances will be most freely extended with the kindly hope that consolation and comfort in a large measure will be given them from the Hand on which they have leaned all their lives.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the spacious rooms and halls, as well as the grounds of the Caldwell residence, were filled with sympathizing friends gathered to show their respect to the memory of C. A. Caldwell. After invocation by Pastor Abbott, Scripture selections beginning with words from the oldest known book in human language â Job â were read by Dr. Abbott, who in a short address, founded on Job 23:6, encouraged mourning ones to steadfastly feel that God in His great power is not âpleading againstâ us in long, continued affliction, but is rather âputting strengthâ in us. His words of comfort to the bereaved ones he also supplemented with an appeal to gathered friends, to both those who had known the departed all his 40 years of life in Alton, and to those, too, who had learned to respect him in later years.\n\nIn referring to similar services only seven weeks previous, less one day, when from the same rooms was carried by loving hands to their last resting place the body of a daughter and sister, he remarked they âwere lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided.â\n\nThe family and friends then formed in procession, and followed the remains of the loved and honored one to the cemetery, where thoughtful hands had covered the bare walls of the grave, to which was committed âdust to dust,â and one more mound was raised to be remembered and often visited. At the grave, while lowering the casket, the choir sang âJesus Lover of My Soul,â and after a few words, the grave was filled and covered with many floral tokens. [Burial was in the Alton City Cemetery.]\n\nNOTES:\n\nElmira âMyraâ Caldwell, daughter of Charles A. Caldwell, died in August 1890. She was a graduate of Alton high school and Monticello Seminary in Godfrey, and was about 22 years of age at the time of her death. In 1918, Emma Caldwell, another daughter of Charles Augustus Caldwell, died in a car accident in Denver, Colorado, while visiting her brother.\n\nCALDWELL, DAVID/Source: Alton Telegraph, September 12, 1851\n\nDied in Alton on Thursday morning, David, infant son of C. D. and Jane Caldwell, aged 1 year, 2 months, and 15 days.\n\nCALDWELL, EBEN M./Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, April 8, 1919\n\nFormer Banker and Manufacturing Manager at Elsah\n\nEben M. Caldwell died at 8:30 o'clock this morning at the family home, where he was taken last Saturday on his return from a stay in a hospital in St. Louis. Mr. Caldwell had been in bad health a long time. His condition showed no signs of improvement, and in the belief that a surgical operation would be beneficial, he went to St. Louis a number of weeks ago and underwent a surgical operation. He stood up well under the operation, but the help that had been looked for failed to materialize. He came home Saturday and soon thereafter he collapsed and the end came this morning. Mr. Caldwell was born in Alton, April 26, 1866, and all his life he had passed in Alton. He was the son of Charles Caldwell, for many years president of the Alton National Bank. He worked as assistant cashier of the Alton National Bank until seven years ago, when he became president and manager of the Western Whiting Plant at Elsah. He continued in the latter position until his last sickness began to develop. His bad health of the past few years began to manifest an alarming phase about nine months ago. Since then his decline was steady. For thirty-seven years he had been a member of the First Baptist Church and a leading worker there. His efforts in the church had gained for him recognition as one of the most effective of the members. He was deeply interested, especially in the Men's Bible Class of that church, and his services as a public speaker at religious gatherings were in much demand in this vicinity. He served as superintendent of the Sunday school for a number of years, and was a deacon in the First Baptist Church at the time of his death. In 1901 he married Miss Lillian A. Blair, who, with two daughters, Harriet B. and Myra M., survive him. He leaves also two brothers, C. A. Caldwell of Alton, Martyn R. Caldwell of Denver, and Mrs. Hannah Flagg. The time of the funeral has not been set, as word is awaited from distant relatives. Announcement of the funeral will be made later, and conforming to the wishes of Mr. Caldwell, it is requested that flowers be omitted.\n\nCALDWELL, ELIZABETH (nee FORBES)/Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, August 27, 1902\n\nThis estimable lady died at her home on Henry street in this city at 9:30 o'clock today, after a short illness from meningitis. She was taken ill last week at Gogebic, Michigan. Miss Elizabeth Forbes, daughter of James H. Forbes, married Charles A. Caldwell, April 16, 1891. This union was blessed with two children, one of whom died in Tucson, Arizona about one year ago. The other, a daughter, Elizabeth, survives the mother. Deceased was born in Alton, and at the age of 13 removed to St. Louis. Mrs. Caldwell was a lady of rare qualities of mind and heart, one who made home happy and who drew all her acquaintances into close fellowship with her. For a number of years she has been an invalid, necessitating long visits on several occasions in the west for her health. These visits, while interrupting the endearing family relations, only made the husband and relatives more desirous for her return to health and vigor. Besides her child and husband, one sister, Mrs. Ella F. Johnson of St. Louis, and two brothers, R. M. Forbes of Alton and A. E. Forbes of St. Louis, survive Mrs. Caldwell. All of Mrs. Caldwell's married life, except her visits to other parts in search of health, has been spent in Alton at the home on Henry street. The passing of so beloved a wife and mother is sad on any occasion, but is doubly so in this case, as she was in the prime of young womanhood, with a bright and happy future before her, had health and life been granted.\n\nCALDWELL, ELMIRA âMYRAâ COX/Source: Alton Telegraph, August 28, 1890\n\nMonticello Seminary Graduate, Daughter of Hon. Charles Caldwell\n\nHow fully this is felt when one just on the threshold of the years of womanhood is called away. At the age of about 22 years, Miss Elmira Cox Caldwell, daughter of Hon. Charles A. Caldwell, departed this life Sunday evening. She had been seriously ill for several months, and while love and untiring watchcare hoped and did all that was possible, the spirit of the sweet young girl took its departure to that brighter and better world, where sickness and pain will not mar the celestial joys.\n\nMiss Caldwell was a graduate of the Alton High School in 1885. She was also a graduate (1888) of Monticello Seminary, where she attained high rank in scholarship, and where she won the admiration of teachers and pupils alike. She was a member of a large family, devotedly attached to each other, in which her death makes a most sorrowful inroad. She was the center of a large circle of young friends, upon whose hearts will fall a deep shadow by the passing away of one whom they so tenderly loved. A gentle, sweet disposition, with a desire to do all the good she could, she easily won a warm place in the affections of all who knew her. In the Baptist Church, of which she was a member, she was a devoted and earnest worker, and a member of the choir as long as her health permitted. Her religion was a reality with her, and during her long and severe illness the consolations of her faith were her mainstay. By this affliction, added to the fact that the honored and respected father is, and has been, quite ill for several months, a deep shadow has fallen upon the household, and to the wounded and rent hearts of parents, sisters, and brothers, there will go forth from many homes in Alton a stream of deep sympathy, and the hope that with the stroke that has fallen, there will come a healing balm that will soothe and sustain the sorrowing inmates. The funeral took place yesterday morning at the family residence on Henry Street, where preliminary services were held at which only relatives of the family were present. The services were opened with prayer by Rev. Dr. Abbott, Miss Caldwllâs pastor, who returned from his vacation trip to be present. The cortege was then formed for the cemetery. Large numbers of vehicles had arrived at the residence during the services there, and fell in line, making one of the longest processions seen in this city for years. On the arrival at the cemetery, a large company of friends had gathered there, many of them laden with floral tributes to deck the spot where would rest the form of one so dear to them. As the casket was lowered into the grave, the choir sang, âWhat a Gathering.â The former pastor, Rev. Dr. Jameson, then read a Scripture selection. At the conclusion of these, Dr. Abbott offered prayer, and while the loved form was being covered from sight by mother earth, the choir sang âSafe in the Arms of Jesus.â The casket was crowned with floral tributes as it was lowered into the receptacle, and when the mound was completed over it, the rarest of floral offerings, in beautiful designs, were added until nothing could be seen of the resting place of the dear one, but the blooming, fragrant beautifies brought as tokens of affections by those who loved and esteemed her in lifetime, and who will cherish her memory when she is no longer present with them. A poem was published in The Telegraph, written by Miss Emily G. Alden, on of Miss Caldwellâs teachers at Monticello Seminary, who was present at the funeral services, accompanied by Miss Harriet N. Haskell, Principal of the Seminary.\n\nNOTES:\n\nElmira Cox Caldwell was born in 1868, to Charles Augustus Caldwell (1823-1890) and Ann Marsh Caldwell (1836-1915). She had eight brothers and sisters. Miss Caldwell was 21 or 22 years of age at the time of death. She was buried in the Alton City Cemetery.\n\nCALDWELL, EMIL/Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, March 25, 1918\n\nMr. and Mrs. Alexander Caldwell, of 710 East Fifth street, were shocked this morning to receive news of the death of their son, Emil, at the home of his uncle, George Kleinpeter, in St. Louis. The message said that the young man, aged 28, a well known cigar maker, was found dead in bed and no particulars of the cause of death was given. Mrs. Caldwell departed at once for St. Louis to look after the body of her son and make arrangements for its shipment to Alton for burial. The young man leaves, beside his parents, five brothers and two sisters. Frank is at Camp Taylor, Leonard is in the Navy; Misses Margaret and Josephine and Messrs. Henry, Raymond and Oscar are in Alton. The funeral will probably be Wednesday.\n\nCALDWELL, EMMA/Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, March 25, 1918\n\nKilled in Auto Accident While Visiting Brother in Denver\n\nWord was received in Alton Sunday at midnight telling of the death of Miss Emma Caldwell of Alton, in an automobile accident at Denver, Colo. The message, it was stated by C. A. Caldwell, gave the information that in the accident in which Miss Caldwell lost her life, Mr. and Mrs. Martyn R. Caldwell, of Denver, whom she was visiting, were injured also. The telegram said that Mrs. M. R. Caldwell was severely bruised and Mr. Caldwell, whose name was signed to the message, was slightly bruised. Owing to the fewness of details and the fact that after a telegram was sent back to get further information, there was considerable delay in the answer being received, it was feared that the sender of the telegram was minimizing his own injuries and that he was perhaps worse hurt than might be inferred from the message. Miss Caldwell was a member of one of Alton's oldest and most prominent families. She was a daughter of C. A. Caldwell, for many years president of the Alton National Bank, and a sister of C. A. Caldwell, cashier of the Alton National, also of Eben Caldwell and Mrs. Hannah Flagg of Alton and Martyn R. Caldwell of Denver. Her brother, A. P. Caldwell died recently in Alton. It was said by C. A. Caldwell after receiving word of the accident that his sister had been making a protracted visit in Denver with her brother. The other sister, with whom she lived in the old Caldwell homestead at Fourteenth and Henry streets, Mrs. Flagg, had gone to Texas for a visit and only recently returned home. Miss Caldwell was planning to be home within a week, too, and the Alton members of the family were looking forward to welcoming her back. The tidings of her accidental death filled with sorrow not only the members of her family, but also a large number of friends in Alton. It was the expectation that word would be received late this afternoon giving information as to the time of the shipment of the body of Miss Caldwell to Alton.\n\nSource: Alton Evening Telegraph, March 26, 1918\n\nThe body of Miss Emma Caldwell, who was killed in an automobile accident at Denver, Colo., Sunday, is on the way to Alton where funeral services will be conducted at the home of her brother, C. A. Caldwell, 1007 Henry street. A long distance telephone message from Denver supplied the details of the accident in which many friends and the relatives of Miss Caldwell were deeply interested. She was out riding Sunday afternoon when the front wheels of the automobile struck a soft spot in the road and the automobile was turned over. Miss Caldwell was thrown out on her head and instantly killed. Mrs. Martyn R. Caldwell was slightly injured, and Mr. Caldwell was severely, but it is believed not seriously hurt. Both Mr. and Mrs. Martyn Caldwell were taken to a hospital but it was believed they would be able to return home at once. Neither is able to accompany the body of Miss Emma Caldwell to Alton, so word was sent that a Miss Bishop, a friend of the family, would escort it to Alton. The expectation was that the body would leave Denver Tuesday and arrive in Alton Wednesday evening, and that the funeral would be Thursday afternoon from the home of C. A. Caldwell. The request was made by members of the family that flowers be omitted. The news of the death of Miss Caldwell was most shocking to a large number of people who had known and loved her. In her family circle she had stood as a mother to the members of the family ever since the death of their own mother. She was beloved by all who knew her and her tragic end was an event of the deepest sadness to all. She was a teacher in the First Baptist Sunday school, and was a devoted worker there. Her class was one of young women, and was one of the best in the Sunday school.\n\nCALDWELL, FRANK E./Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, December 11, 1918\n\nSoldier Dies of Pneumonia\n\nMr. and Mrs. Alexander Caldwell of East Fifth street, received a telegram from the government this afternoon stating that their son, Frank Caldwell, aged 27, had died in France on November 2 after an illness with pneumonia. Caldwell was a cook in Company E, 333d Infantry, and left Alton a year ago last September. He has served a term in the navy and was only home a year when he was called into the service. The family is in doubt as to the authenticity of the story of the death, as two weeks ago a card was received, dated November 3, in which Caldwell wrote that he was improving. The letter was written evidently by a nurse as it was not in Caldwell's handwriting. Caldwell stated on the card that he had just received a number of letters from relatives and told what he wanted for Christmas. Besides his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell, he leaves four brothers, Henry in France, Leonard and Raymond in the navy, the former on the U. S. Michigan, and the latter at Puget Sound, Oscar at home, and two sisters, Margaret and Josephine of Alton.\n\nSource: Alton Evening Telegraph, August 10, 1920\n\nThe body of Frank E. Caldwell, who died on November 28, 1918 at Le Mans, France, while he was a cook in Co. E of the 333rd Infantry, will arrive in New York on August 15, the parents of the young soldier have been informed. The date the body will arrive here is not known. The young soldier entered the army only a short while after his discharge from the navy, where he had served for some time. He was one of four brothers in the service, all sons of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Caldwell of 710 East Sixth street. He died of pneumonia, after the signing of the armistice. He saw active service at the front.\n\nSource: Alton Evening Telegraph, August 20, 1920\n\nThe body of Frank Caldwell, who died overseas in the service of his country during the war, arrived in Alton this morning and was taken in charge by Undertaker Bauer. The remains were in a sealed casket that was flag draped. With the body was Private Elwell, who had been detailed to escort it home. The casket will be taken to the home of the parents, and there will remain until the time set for the funeral services, Monday morning at 9 o'clock from St. Mary's church.\n\nSource: Alton Evening Telegraph, August 23, 1920\n\nA vast crowd attended the funeral of Frank E. Caldwell, which was held this morning at 9 o'clock from St. Mary's Catholic church. During the past few days many people have visited the home of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Caldwell on East Fifth street, where the body of the young soldier was in the casket. Caldwell died in 1918 in Le Mans, France, and his body was just sent home. Requiem High Mass was celebrated by the Rev. Joseph Meckel, pastor of St. Mary's church, with the Rev. Henry B. Schnelton as Deacon, and the Rev. George E. Faller as sub-deacon. The Rev. Fr. Kippling was Master of Ceremonies. The pallbearers were selected from members of Alton Post of the American Legion. The casket was wrapped in an American Flag. Interment was in St. Joseph's Cemetery.\n\nCALDWELL, JANE/Source: Alton Telegraph, January 2, 1890\n\nMrs. Jane Caldwell, widow of the late Calvin D. Caldwell, died Sunday at the residence of her son-in-law, Mr. Daniel J. Williams, in St. Louis, where she had been visiting for a few months. Mrs. Caldwell is one of the oldest residents of Alton, and was highly respected by her many friends and acquaintances. She had been afflicted for several years with a cancerous affection caused by a fall, and bore up bravely under the most intense sufferings. Besides her children, viz: Mesdames Susan Smith; D. J. and S. Williams of St. Louis; Mrs. Andrew Stiritz; and Mr. William Caldwell, of Alton, she leaves a sister, Mrs. M. P. Caldwell, and a large number of relatives and friends in Alton to mourn her loss. Mrs. Caldwell was one of the oldest members of the Presbyterian Church in Alton. The remains of Mrs. Jane Caldwell arrived here Monday eve from St. Louis, and the funeral took place Tuesday afrom the residence of her son-in-law, Mr. Andrew Stiritz, 914 State Street. Rev. A. T. Wolff, D.D., officiated in the presence of a large concourse of mourning relatives and friends. [Burial was in the Alton City Cemetery.]\n\nCALDWELL, MARGARET/Source: Alton Telegraph, February 03, 1898\n\nThursday morning, Mrs. Margaret Caldwell died at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Joseph Luly, after a six weeks illness. Mrs. Caldwell was one of Altonâs oldest citizens, and by all who knew her she was known as a good woman. She was born in Ireland 76 years ago, and while a young woman came to this country and lived in Philadelphia for a few years. Forty-six years ago, she came to Alton, and has been a resident here ever since that time. She was a devout member of St. Paulâs Episcopal Church of Alton, and was one of the regular attendants when she was able. Of late years, she has made her home with her daughter, Mrs. Luly, and there it was she laid down her burden of life. She leaves two sons, Robert and Aleck Caldwell, and one daughter, Mrs. Margaret Caldwell Luly.\n\nThe funeral services were held Sunday afternoon from St. Paulâs Episcopal Church. There was a large attendance of sympathizing friends present who had known Mrs. Caldwell in life, and filled the church. The pallbearers were Charles Magee, Patrick Lynch, Thomas Corbett, P. OâSullivan, M. Kirvin, Roger McElligott. At the grave, short services were conducted, and the body was laid to rest under a mound of earth and flowers for its last long sleep.\n\nNOTES:\n\nMargaret was the wife of Archibald âArchieâ Caldwell (1824-1864). She was interred in the Alton City Cemetery.\n\nCALDWELL, MARSHALL P./Source: Alton Telegraph, April 25, 1878\n\nThis sad event, though expected for some time, has fallen with none the less afflictive force on the stricken hearts of mourning relatives and friends. As is known to our readers, the deceased received severe injuries from a fall through a hatchway some weeks since. And although his friends âhoped against hopeâ that he might possibly recover, his physical system gradually failed until about 1:20 oâclock Saturday morning, when his spirit peacefully took its flight. The resources of medical skill and the untiring attention of relatives and sympathizing friends were alike powerless to do more than alleviate his condition.\n\nMr. Caldwell was one of our oldest citizens. He had lived in this city for over thirty years, and had established an enviable character for energy, enterprise, and business probity. He was born in Scott County, Illinois, September 4, 1824, and consequently was in the 54th year of his age. In the various relations of life, he was highly esteemed for his many estimable qualities, and his memory will long be green in the hearts of his friends. Devoted to his family, his affectionate solicitude for their welfare was unceasing. A kind neighbor, he was ever ready to sacrifice himself to assist others. His last illness, drawn out through many weeks of suffering, was borne with exemplary patience and fortitude. Ever more solicitous for the comfort of his attendants than for his own, he never permitted a murmur to escape his lips. His mental faculties were unimpaired until the last, quietly and calmly he awaited the end that he knew was inevitable. Mr. Caldwell leaves a widow, Susan M. (McNeal) Caldwell, and three adult children [one of his children was Jennie Rowan].\n\nThe funeral took place Sunday afternoon at two oâclock from the family residence on Prospect Street. The services were conducted by Rev. Dr. Norton, assisted by Rev. Dr. Armstrong and Rev. T. O. Field. The bearers were Messrs. D. Sparks, Fred Hayden, A. T. Hawley, Samuel Pitts, J. A. Anion, and Albert Wade. The large attendance on the occasion proved the esteem in which the deceased was held by the entire community.

Miss Caldwell has been ill for a number of years with consumption, and although with little hope in prospect, yet she bore herself with patience and Christian resignation, showing a lovely disposition during her long illness, and deeply appreciated all that was done for her. She spent part of several years in the west, mostly at Manitou, at first with some hopes of benefit, but lately the disease made rapid inroads on her health, when she returned some months ago to the home of her mother in Alton. On Saturday, she was taken worse, and the end came as stated above.\n\nMiss Caldwell was the daughter of the late Charles Augustus Caldwell (1823-1890), President of the Alton National Bank. Her mother, four brothers, and two sisters survive her.\n\nThe funeral of Miss Caldwell took place from the residence of her mother, Mrs. A. M. Caldwell, 1420 Henry Street, yesterday.

He was a man of resolute will, very strong and determined, even in his old age, and when he seemed to be a tottering old man, the person who would have offered an insult to him or his family would have found it perhaps more than was bargained for.

His illness, a few days ago, became serious, and since Saturday he has been hovering between life and death. Friends and relatives hoped for the recovery of the man who for years has been prominent in the religious, educational, and civic life of Upper Alton, and general sorrow was caused today when news of his death became known. Mr. Campbell was born in Fosterburg and lived in Alton for 40 years. He taught in various schools of Madison County for 29 years, and was principal of the Gillham School here for ten years. Mr. Campbell had long been a prominent figure in Upper Alton. Before the annexation of Upper Alton to the city of Alton, he was a leader in the political life of the village. He was mayor of Upper Alton from 1900 to 1911. He also served three terms as alderman in Upper Alton. He was once the Democratic candidate for county superintendent of schools.

Her son-in-law, Robert Bushell, dropped dead while at work two weeks ago.\n\nCAMPBELL, ROBERT HIGGINS/Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, May 3, 1902\n\nSuicide by Hanging\n\nA sad case of suicide caused by despondency on account of ill health occurred this morning about 5 o'clock at the home of D. E. McFaddin, 813 Stanton street. The victim was R. H. Campbell, formerly sheriff of Brown county, Ohio, and a prominent school teacher and insurance man of that place. He was a brother-in-law of Mr. McFaddin and a prominent resident of Georgetown, Ohio, who came here two weeks ago today hoping to find relief from the despondency which finally overcame him. He seemed much better late yesterday evening, playing crokinole with the family and appearing to enjoy it as much as anyone, but a restless night followed and he ended it after daylight by hanging himself in the water closet with a shawl strap, which he had evidently found somewhere and kept secreted for the purpose. He leaves a wife and one child at Georgetown, Ohio, where the remains will be sent this evening for burial. He was 41 years of age. The man was mentally deranged and had made many threats to kill himself. He was closely watched, but managed to elude his watchers this morning and succeeded in fulfilling his threats. He was found dead, hanging from a beam, the ends of his toes just touching the floor of the closet floor. [Note: Robert was born November 26, 1860, in Brown County, Ohio. He was buried in the Confidence Cemetery in Georgetown, Ohio.]\n\nCAMPBELL, THOMAS/Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, February 15, 1913\n\nAged Fisherman and Former Raftsman Dies at Home on Bluff Street\n\nThomas Campbell, aged 80, died at noon today at the family home on Bluff street from uraemic poisoning. Mr. Campbell was for many years engaged in the occupation of fishing. He had followed the river since he was a young man, and he stayed with the river until recently when old age forced him to quit. He had been a raftsman before engaging in the fishing business. He came to Alton in 1842 and had lived in Alton almost continuously ever since. He leaves one daughter, Mrs. Robert Bushel, and a stepson, J. H. Shoolery, beside his aged wife, who survives him. The funeral will be at 10 o'clock Monday morning from the family home, Rev. E. L. Gibson officiating.\n\nCAMPBELL, WILLIAM/Source: Alton Telegraph, October 16, 1868\n\nMr. William Campbell, an old resident of Upper Alton and a worthy and respected citizen, died very suddenly yesterday afternoon, under the following circumstances: For a year or more past, he has been suffering under an attack of the disease called âmilk sickness,â but within a month or two, has been much better. Yesterday morning he came downtown on business, and while in the store of Mr. Eli T. Hollister on Fourth Street, was taken with a violent chill. He recovered from this attack sufficiently in a short time, to go upon the street. He afterwards became worse, and going to the city hall, lay down upon one of the vegetable counters and waited until the one oâclock p.m. car to Upper Alton, when he was assisted on board. On arriving at Upper Alton, he was too unwell to sit up, and was carried into the drugstore, and some restoratives administered, and was then assisted into the office of Dr. Yerkes, where he lay down upon a lounge. Dr. Yerkes went into the office about an hour afterwards, and found him asleep. He then left him, thinking that when he awoke he would get up and go home. About six oâclock, however, Mr. Campbellâs son came to the drugstore inquiring for his father. Upon this, Dr. Yerkes, Dr. Hodge, and Mr. Cooper went up into the office, where Mr. Campbell was lying, and found him cold in death.\n\nA coronerâs inquest was held, and the verdict rendered âthat the deceased came to his death from natural causes.â Congestion is supposed to have been the immediate cause.\n\nIt seems hard that a man should have died entirely alone so near his own house. Someone is surely blamable for not informing his family of his illness, however slight it may have been supposed to be. Mr. Campbell was about fifty years of age, and leaves a wife and two children.\n\nCAMRELIA, MABEL/Source: Alton Daily Telegraph, March 21, 1892\n\nMr. and Mrs. Camrelia of 812 East Second Street are bereaved in the death of their infant daughter, Mabel, at the age of eleven months, which death occurred this afternoon.

E. Canham of 602 Forest Home Place received a telegram this morning that her husband, who spent much of his time away from home on business, had been found dead in his room in his hotel, asphyxiated by gas. Mrs. Canham told neighbors today that in her dream she had seen her husband plainly, and that he appeared to be taking leave of her, remarking, she recalled, \"I hate to leave you.\" To this remark, her dream made her reply, \"Well, we will have you for dinner and supper.\" The dream troubled her, as separation from her husband always had. He had been home for the Christmas holidays, and prior to that had been home on the Fourth of July. He was working in the capacity of superintendent for the Walsh Construction Co., and his duties kept him away for long periods. At the time of his death he was at Fairview, N. J., representing his employers. He was born in Alton and regarded Alton as his home all his life. He was 43 years of age. He leaves in Alton his wife and eight children, also a sister, Mrs. Samuel Fanning, and a brother, William Canham of Alton. Besides these he leaves a brother, Ben of Loami, and another, George, of Clatskanie, Oregon. The funeral will be at Alton and the time will not be set until word is heard from the brother in Oregon, who may desire to attend it. The family had received no particulars of the death of Mr. Canham. There was great distress among the family and among the neighbors today over the sad plight in which the family is plunged by the death of the husband and father. He was very fond of his family, and devoted all the time he could spare from his work to them. They lived in a comfortable home and they looked forward to his infrequent visits home with great pleasure. Mr. Canham had many friends in Alton who were very sorrowful over his death. They are quite sure that his death must have been due to accident, and not to any plan on his part.\n\nCANIPE, JULIA A./Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, February 15, 1902\n\nBethalto News - Mrs. Julia A.

He called for brakes and made every effort to stop the train, but the distance was too short, and the boy was run over. The train was stopped and the boy picked up alive, but terribly mangled â his left arm being crushed from the hand to the elbow, and his head covered with wounds. It appeared that he had been sleeping in the cattle guard, and hearing the noise of the approaching train, had endeavored, while half-awake, to crawl out from his dangerous sleeping place with the above result. He was conveyed to the city hospital in an insensible condition, and was attended by Dr. William A. Haskell, but his injuries were necessarily fatal, and he died about eleven oâclock. Nothing was found upon his person to identify him. His age was about fifteen.\n\nCoroner Grippenburg held an inquest on the remains, and a verdict was rendered in accordance with the above facts. Last evening, after holding the inquest, the Coroner found a man who identified the body as that of an Irish boy named Cannauga, from Chicago. A bundle belonging to the boy was found in the cattle guard, and it is supposed that he was making his way from town to town on foot.\n\nCANNAVON, THOMAS/Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, August 20, 1903\n\nThomas Cannavon died Wednesday night at 11 o'clock at his home, 1208 Belle street, from general debility.

Miss Cannellâs death is especially severe on the family, as only a few months ago a loved daughter was laid to rest.

Cannell died Monday evening at 9:15 o'clock at her home, 1530 State street. She had been severely ill for several weeks, but had been in failing health for several years.

She came to Alton about forty years ago and had lived here ever since. She leaves two sons, Charles A. and Herbert Cannell, and three daughters, Mrs. L. H. Weston and Misses Eva and Helen Cannell. She leaves also a brother, H. A. Fox of Jacksonville. Mrs. Cannell was a devout Christian and was a good mother. Her real worth was known chiefly to her family and her neighbors, in whom her greatest interest centered, and her loss will be greatest to them. The time for the funeral has not been set.\n\nCANNELL, HELEN/Source: Alton Evening Telegraph, December 11, 1916\n\nMiss Cannell Burned to Death in Kentucky\n\nMiss Helen Cannell, member of a well-known Alton family, was reported by a press dispatch received by the Telegraph today to have been burned to death at Hopkinsville, Ky. Inquiry was made of the Telegraph as to her family and the Telegraph was requested to inform them and ascertain whether the identification had been made correctly. Charles Cannell of the Alton Savings Bank, and Herbert Cannell of the Hartmann Hardware Store, when informed of the press dispatch, said that they were not informed as to the death of their sister. They could not even explain her being at Hopkinsville, Ky. The brothers had believed their sister was at St. Louis, where she was supposed to have gone two weeks ago to visit a friend. Miss Helen Cannell was a well known young woman, born in Alton, and for a period a teacher in the public schools. A number of years ago while teaching she suffered a nervous collapse as the result of overstrain, and she was unable to recuperate fully. She was believed to be much better, however, and her family and friends were much encouraged. She was allowed to go to St. Louis for a visit, it was said by relatives, and they were not informed that she had gone any further. Telephonic communication elicited the information that a young woman giving the name Helen Cannell had been at Hopkinsville, Ky. a few days before Thanksgiving Day. It was said that she had taken a walk out on a country road, and being overtaken by night and finding it necessary to take refuge from the weather in an old abandoned school house, had gone in. The next morning she appeared at the house of a neighbor, horribly burned, minus part of her clothing, having walked two miles over a country road. She died on Thanksgiving Day. With her, it was said, she always carried a shoe box and her name on this helped solve her identity. The relatives in Alton were not informed of their sister's death.\n\nSource: Alton Evening Telegraph, December 13, 1916\n\nThe body of the young woman who died at Hopkinsville, Ky. on Thanksgiving day from the effects of burns, has been identified by Herbert Cannell of Alton as that of his sister, Miss Helen M. Cannell. The stories told by those who had conversed with the young woman indicate that she had been subject to hallucinations as a result of a nervous collapse she suffered years ago, and from which she had never fully recovered. There has been suspicions, as a result of stories she told, that she might have been brought to her death through the agency of some person interested in putting her out of the way, but friends of the young woman are unwilling to believe that her stories were anything but the vagaries of a mind that was disordered. A doctor in St. Louis supplied some information as to the state of the mind of Miss Cannell. She is reported by him to have threatened to kill herself, and had solicited poison from him, and when she failed she said that she would burn herself to death. She also told a story of having been subjected to a criminal attack in a store she formerly conducted in St. Louis, and the consequences of the attack, the doctor said, had been obviated by a surgical operation, and to this operation he attributed her state of mind. The doctor who is quoted had not been informed of the breakdown of Miss Cannell, which forced her to cease school teaching and which caused her to be a helpless invalid for a long time, and from which she had but recently recovered in part. It is supposed she had a relapse and that the tragic ending of her life was the result of the relapse.....Those who credit the suicide story believe that she decided to burn herself and selected the abandoned school house as a place to build the pyre. When the burning was in process, they think she changed her mind and then walked five miles in her burned feet to a house where she was given succor.\n\nCANNELL, HORACE D./Source: Edwardsville Intelligencer, January 11, 1895\n\nHorace D. Cannell, son of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Cannell, died at the family home Saturday morning after a weeks illness with stomach troubles.
