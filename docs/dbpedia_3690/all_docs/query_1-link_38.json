LOUIS POST- DISPATCH MONDAY, JULY 10, 1995 In An Effort To Find Their Son's Killers, Parents Offer Reward By William C. Lhotka Of the Post-Dispatch Staff On the morning of April 26, Keith Ryan Smith took the family car and the family pet, a miniature pincher, and drove to a veterinarian near his home in north St. Louis County. Thirteen hours later, police got a call about a man slumped in the back seat of a car behind the Crystal Garden Apartments in the 8800 block of Dragonwyck Drive .\n\nSmith, 23, had been shot three times, once in the head. Smith's parents, Clinton and Sandra Smith, say they are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the murder. The Smiths say Keith left their home on Linnell Drive to take the 3- month-old, 5-pound puppy to a veterinarian about a mile away, near Halls Ferry and Chambers roads. After the dog was treated, Keith drove off. No one reported seeing Keith alive again, and the dog has disappeared .\n\nSandra Smith said Keith had attended Hazelwood schools and later got a high school equivalency degree. He belonged to the Army Reserve and was making plans to join the Navy. The youngest of three children, he is also survived by a sister, Robin Thomas, 29, and a brother, Ivan Smith, 25. \"When he left the veterinarian, that's the last we know about Sandra Smith said Friday. \"He had money on him and he was going to buy parts to fix an old truck.\" Sandra Smith said his killer or kill- The county's homicide chief said Smith's murder was the only homicide handled by county police this year that remains unsolved .\n\ners had taken the money and his jewelry a necklace and a watch were missing when his body was found. The body was found in the backseat of the family car, police said. That fact led Lt. Robert Trittler, St. Louis County's homicide chief, to suggest that Keith was probably murdered somewhere else and the car dumped behind the apartment complex, which is about five miles from the veterinarian's office .\n\nTrittler said Smith's murder was the only homicide handled by county police this year that is unsolved so far. Trittler said the assailants might have taken the puppy or turned it loose. \"I feel comfortable that somewhere. someone has knowledge of what happened but hasn't come forward yet,\" Trittler said. The Smiths want that someone to come forward and are offering the reward as an enticement .\n\nThey ask anyone with information about Keith's death or the missing dog to call County Police Detective Thomas Deakin at 889-2341. The information will remain confidential.
