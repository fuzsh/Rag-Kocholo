        "text": "Share\n\nIsola Manzara\n\nThe countries bordering the Mediterranean share some familiar culinary tastes. Their food cultures can easily blend, which is undoubtedly one of the reasons why Italian cuisine is so prevalent in Türkiye. However, Isola Manzara is an Italian restaurant that stands out among its peers and makes a difference with its chefs and bar staff.\n\nIn addition to the expected classics of Italian dishes -as carpaccio, risotto, and pasta varieties with different sauces- Isola Manzara offers a wide range of sea-inspired dishes such as grilled lobster, king prawns, and octopus. Italian chef Francesco Bagnato who grew up in southern Italy has been reflecting the regional influence in his cooking and he is joined by Turkish chefs Ziyat Aktepe and Kemal Erol. This cultural exchange allows us to see how geography and ingredients blend smoothly: For example, bottarga or sun-dried tomatoes come from Italy, but they use Turkish olive oil from Ayvalık. Similarly, Bodrum’s famous “satsuma” tangerines are used in the cheesecake, while the Bodrum salad on the menu features local herbs. As we all know, ingredients from similar regions complement each other: Without compromising the Italian style, Isola Manzara takes advantage of this harmony in terms of the freshness of the ingredients and the new culinary discoveries.\n\nIsola Manzara, Main Dish @Isola Manzara\n\nIsola Manzara’s large terrace offers a captivating view while the inside part relaxing you with turquoise shades that evoke summer and the sea. It’s not just a dining place; but also the perfect spot to have an evening cocktail or to prolong hot summer nights with chilled white wine. The wine list includes Italian, Turkish, and French wines, along with prosecco and champagne selection. However, one of the things we definitely recommend trying in Isola Manzara is their cocktails. Led by the bar manager Mehmet Metin and the bar chef Can Güzel who have collaborated for years, you’ll discover signature cocktails, various Negronis, and surprising combinations!\n\nIsola Manzara serves every day of the week, nine months a year, starting from 6:00 p.m.\n\nZuma Bodrum\n\nJapanese cuisine is becoming increasingly popular in Türkiye and worldwide. It has captured the hearts of many food lovers mainly because of its sensitive and discerning approach to ingredients. Zuma Bodrum, as a part of the most famous Japanese restaurants, offers everything can be expected from a Japanese place: Mouth-watering toro tartare, sashimi from fresh fish varieties, different seafood and meat dishes prepared with yuzu, ginger, wasabi, and miso, and of course, tasty sushis pair with a wide selection of sake, Japanese beer, and whisky. It should be noted that the wine list also includes Turkish wines for those who wish to try. Zuma creates a different wine list for each country, with different wine directors overseeing selections in each of its international locations.\n\nZuma Bodrum’s location makes you feel the sea breeze perfectly and the kitchen is led by executive chef Emrah Orak and executive sous chef Ali Abdulmunim who have been working at Zuma restaurants worldwide for over seven years. These two experienced chefs are also in charge of the “daikoku” selection, because at Zuma, reflecting the tradition of “chefs’ selection” is essential. The drinks also reflect this: The Zuma Heritage list on the cocktail menu includes unique recipes to accompany the stunning sea views.\n\nZuma Bodrum, Exterior @ Christopher Dabu/Zuma Bodrum\n\nZuma Bodrum offers two sessions for dinner service, beginning at 7:00 p.m. to 11:30, so you may catch the sunset time. The music starts every night after 10:30 p.m. while see breeze freshens. With a stage and various DJs, Zuma creates an atmosphere where you can begin the evening with cocktails, continue with dinner, and enjoy the sea, music, and drinks until 03:00 a.m.\n\nZuma Bodrum has no indoor space and is open six months a year.\n\nHakkasan Bodrum\n\nAs the world’s most famous exponent of Chinese -mainly Cantonese- cuisine, Hakkasan brings thousands of years of culinary heritage to Bodrum in a truly unique atmosphere: While there are 13 Hakkasans around the world, Hakkasan Bodrum is the only open-air one in the world, offering dining by the sea without sacrificing its renowned mysterious style. From the beginning, Hakkasan chose to reflect the traditional architecture of inns along China’s trade routes in its restaurants, and it’s a significant challenge to create an open-air restaurant without breaking that concept; so, that explains perfectly the uniqueness of the branch.\n\nHakkasan Bodrum, Exterior @Hakkasan Bodrum\n\nHakkasan Bodrum’s surprises are not limited to this, we also see an excellent gastronomique expansion unique to this branch: The Fish Market. In this concept, the chef selects the best fish of the day and the freshest seafood for the Fish Market concept and then they are grilled, steamed, or wok-cooked with vegetables and sauces according to the customer’s preference. It is inspired by the traditional fish market concept in Türkiye, so in this sense, the Fish Market is an excellent example of how different cultures can harmonize when they come together. It offers a daily-changing experience for food lovers who want to experience the mastery of Hakkasan’s chefs but do not want to be limited to the menu.\n\nThis “fusion” is also evident regarding the ingredients at Hakkasan Bodrum, where Nicky Tan Choon Aun heads the kitchen. The rice comes from China while some of the seafood such as crustaceans and cuttlefish come from Çanakkale, and the lamb or beef come from Tekirdağ and Balıkesir. Everything selected for the “Fish Market” comes directly from the local fishermen. Opening at 7:00 p.m. and with DJ performances after 10:00 p.m., the restaurant serves the most refined tastes of Cantonese cuisine paired with various wines from the wine list meticulously prepared by the sommeliers, but also offers nine signature cocktails, providing innovative, weekly changing flavors for guests prefer to continue their evening with cocktails.\n\nA final note: As combining Hakkasan classics with Turkish concepts and signature drinks in a unique atmosphere with stunning sea views, this year Hakkasan Bodrum serves a special tasting menu to celebrate the Mandarin Hotel’s 10th anniversary.\n\nIsola Manzara, Cocktail @Gizem Cüce/Isola Manzara\n\nIllustration image // Isola Manzara, Exterior @Jules Dunne/Isola Manzara"
