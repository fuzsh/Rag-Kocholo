LOCATION Jacquelyn Shea Maggie Devlin Molly McCann Sarah Meinelt Video Yearbook Megan Brazel Kelly Gibson fa Dear Mr. Serino, We would like to thank you for going above and beyond anything that could be expected from a class advisor. Your enthusiasm and tireless commitment has made our high school experience the best it possibly could have been. From planning every senior event, to reaching out to every member of the class, you are the epitome of what a great class advisor should be. You have shown us what it means to come together as a class and have enabled us to have an amazing senior year at Masconomet. There aren't enough words to express our gratitude, -THE CLASS OF 2008 2008 Dedication Mr. West Mr. West is one of the most well-liked and valued teachers at Masconomet. For 18 years he has shared his passion for the health sciences with his students. He loves teaching and makes his classes even more thought provoking through student debates. In addition to teaching Masco's EMT course, Mr. West teaches a Northshore Community College course and helps train other EMT teachers. Not only is Mr. West an amazing educator, but also an involved member of the community. Up until recently, he was a Fire Fighter in Boxford. He loves photography and theater, and he also loves Apple computers. Those who know Mr. West say that he often visits the apple store just to browse the new Macs. Mr. West has taught a range of health science courses, including Health, First Responder, EMT, Intro to Medicine and Intro to Health Care. He also worked in guidance many years ago and taught at a Catholic School. During his engaging in-class debates, Mr. West can take any side of a topic, encouraging his students to broaden their views. He not only challenges his students to learn and experience new things but values broadening his own education and views as well. Mr. West is an energetic, engaging, and knowledgeable teacher whose impact on the student body will never be forgotten at Masco. Below: Mr. West and Mike spend quality time together in the outdoors. Above: Mr. West and his family stand proudly beside his son Mike at his 2007 graduation from Masconomet. E3 Above: Mr. West hands out an exam to his EMT class. The class is composed entirely of seniors and many say it is one of their favorite classes. Retirees Mr. Meegan Although Mr. Meegan will be retiring this year, his great impact on the Masconomet community will never be forgotten. Mr. Meegan has taken on numerous roles during the 41 years he spent here in the high school and has left a lasting impression on many students and teachers. He has taught several history and psychology classes, served as a class advisor for 12 years, was an NHS advisor for eight years, and acted as the Student Council Advisor for a notable 18 years. He is also the founder of Masc'os elite Model United Nations team. His plans for retirement include continuing to teach classes at Merrimack College, and maintaining a private psychological counseling practice at his home. Recreationally, Mr. Meegan hopes to visit family in Ireland with his wife Stephanie, maintain his Bonsai collection, and perform renovations on his home. Although Mr. Meegan has plenty of events planned post-Masco, he says that he will miss his students and fellow faculty members. He will also miss the satisfaction he receives from educating young students, a dream that he has pursued for as long as he can remember. 14 Mr. Uhrich Mr. Uhrich has been active in the Masco community for over 44 years. He has taught many classes in the Science Department, including Biology, Physical Science, Human Anatomy and Physiology, Marine Sciences, and Environmental Studies. He was also an Assistant Coach for the Varsity Basketball Team and coached the Freshman Baseball Team. Outside of Masco, Mr. Uhrich worked as a biologist during the summer and over school vacations, which increased his knowledge and experience in the field of science. Before working at Masco, he taught for one year in Indiana but says that working here has fulfilled his dream of teaching in \"an excellent school system\". Mr. Uhrich is looking forward to spending time with his \"six granddaughters and traveling with service projects all over the world\" for the next few years. However, after he retires, Mr. Uhrich will greatly miss the Science Department Staff and all of his students. Anyone fortunate enough to have crossed paths with Mrs. Symmes during the 35 years she has spent teaching at Masconomet will remember her positive attitude and enthusiasm for her job. She began her teaching career in the Middle School Physical Education Department, where she enjoyed getting to know each and every student. Over the years, her job has evolved from teaching Physical Education to Special Education, and she \"has enjoyed it all\". Outside of the classroom, Mrs. Symmes has coached various sports, including gymnastics, girls outdoor track, and field hockey. As a Masco graduate herself, she has put every effort forth to make sure her students receive the same positive experience that she enjoyed at Masco. During retirement, Mrs. Symmes is planning to travel and pursue hobbies such as scrap booking, gardening, and quilting. Although its going to be hard for her to leave behind all the students and staff members, Mrs. Symmes has many memories of those \"special moments\" of making a difference in childrens lives. Ms. Symmes 15 FACULTY survey What impression do you hope to leave on the class of 2008? \"I hope they feel like I cared about them.

Everyone was staring at the tsunami in my belly and giggling.\" - Mrs. Ryan \"I have an embarrassing moment everyday...! guess as you get older, you just dont care as much!\" - Ms. Saitta \"I once mistakenly called a student by the wrong first name, and the other students promptly corrected me. To try to save the situation, I shook my head in confusion and started asking the other students what their names were, each time shaking my head saying things like 'no, really?' and 'oh. ..so that's your name'. I don't think it mac me look any better, but at least now they think l'i nuts.\" - Mr. Yutkins s \\ / How do the students you teach compare to the students you went to high school with? \"I went to Masco so they are pretty similar.. .except there are a lot more cell phones\" - Ms. Saitta \"They are smarter, savvier and more motivated; preppier too\" - Mrs. Larosa \"They don't compare.

The freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors each did their best to show spirit for their school through hall decorating and spirit days. This year the seniors carried on the tradition of upperclassman victory. The exceptionally decorated Las Vegas themed hallway and overwhelming class participation in the spirit days helped the seniors procure a solid victory over the other classes. After a weeklong display of spirit at Masco, the football team pulled out a big victory at the homecoming game. The homecoming king and queen, Ian Gelinas and Annie Burns, were announced at halftime. The annual carnival was also a success. Sports and clubs went all out, setting up booths to sell goods and services. Adding to the fun was a Velcro wall, bungee run, and a dunk tank, where students took out their frustrations on poor defenseless teachers. The entire week of homecoming was a sensation and a true display of Masco pride and spirit! October 22- 26, 2007 Even the teachers showed their spirit this homecoming! The guidance department were Masco superfans, while Mr. Clark who wore a Led Zeppelin shirt on Dress up-Dress down day! WEEK Each class had a great time decorating their hall this year in the theme of U.S. cities. Seniors Andrew Dooley and Katilyn Chambers show their spirit at the pep rally on Friday afternoon. A highlight of homecoming week was the two teletubbies, who could be found wandering the halls on Friday, and then ran across the field house with the chieftain at the assembly during the afternoon. Sophomore Jake London pumped up the crowd all week long as the best Chieftain Masco has ever seen. Newly crowned homecoming king, Ian Gelinas looks estatic with his win after an incredibly close race. Student - Faculty Basketball Game November 15, 2007 On a chilly November night, students and faculty alike congregated in the Masconomet field house awaiting the start of the most anticipated game of the year. On one side, the faculty (top left), led by the fine educators of Masconomet. On the opposite bench was the pride of Masco's student basketball players. The game was incredibly heated (bottom left) but enjoyable nonetheless. The students put up a valiant fight with senior Chris Conova scoring top points for the team. Mr. Hodges led the faculty, scoring numerous points, while keeping the competition in check. The Step team made their debut performance at halftime, keeping the crowd excited and entertained. In the end, the faculty was victorious for the third year in a row with a close score of 52-47. With faculty victories stacking up by the year, the students will need to work harder than ever to overthrow this dynasty next year. On the day before Thanksgiving break, the field house floor was a blur of black, red, white and blue as the four classes competed for the title of spirit day champion. The student body gathered together to watch representative members of each class participate in different team events. Among the most entertaining to watch was the president roulette in which each class president had an egg cracked over his or her head. The seniors dominated the relay race and rolling- chair basketball game. They continued to assert their place at the top of the school and were victorious overall with the most wins of any class. Close behind them were the sophomores and freshmen while the juniors took last place because they cheated in a number of events. f Spirit Day \\ Assembly November 21, 2007 {Mr. Masco December 7, 2007 Nate Hooper Liam Bickerton Timmy Kastrinelis Sixteen of Masco's most desired bachelors came together for a night of heartfelt performances and crazy antics to capture the coveted title of \"Mr. Masco\". The annual competition, this year hosted by juniors Mike Tyler and Dan \"The Man\" Swimm, was an utter success. All of the contestants bravely answered romantic questions in front of an auditorium filled with swooning schoolgirls. Inquiries included proposal techniques that had the audience screaming \"YES, YES, YES!\". The talent portion of the competition was, in a word, \"epic\". There was never a dull moment, as acts ranged from an acoustic guitar performance to a unique dance routine to Daft Punk. The evening came to a close with the crowning of sophomore Nate Hooper as Mr. Masco. He's hoping that he finds his \"two-foot tall, smokin' hot, 90 pound princess!\" now that he is Mr. Masco. The judges, including Mr. Love and Mrs. Marini, intently tally the scores to determine who will be the next \"Mr. Masco\". This winter, Masco hosted its first ever student-run film festival. The night opened with a short play called, \"Of Widows and Vegetables\": a dark comedy about the widow of a zucchini enthusiast. Justin Rice played the lead role of Harlequin, the narrator for the performance. Harry Paine was excellent and very funny as the gold-digging villain, Malvolio. After the play, the film festival began. Each film was student-directed and written, and some of the films had been in progress since October of this year. The first film, Journal Entry, directed by Erika Lindquist, examined the life of a shy, observant student, played by Colby Thompson. The second short film, directed and written by Bailey White, was Red Motel. It had a chillingly creepy plot and was filmed at the Carriage House Motel on Route 1. The final movie was a spoof on the popular television show America's Next Top Model. There was no strict script for the film and as a result, the actors created most of their lines and jokes on the spot. The film followed 13 models through the top model competition providing comedic relief throughout the auditions, photo shoots, and eliminations. {America's Next Top Model and \"Of Widows and Vegetables\" January 17- 19, 2008 In the Cafeteria What happens in the best 35 minutes of the day? True Life: I Go To Lunch! Sitting in the back of Mr. Trevenen's English class, drawing on my notebook, I can barely concentrate on the exciting discussion of To Kill A Mockingbird for the growling of my stomach. 11:59, yes! The end of class couldnt have come any sooner. My mind shifts quickly from Boo Radley to dancing pepperoni pizzas and rivers of delectable chocolate milk streaming out from their cartons. I shuffle my notebooks together and fly down the hall. Today I am going to get a front spot in the lunch line, before all of the senior football players get there and eat all of the food. Seriously, does anyone actually need three lunches? I run down the stairs and through the hallways as fast as I can, but my 38 pound backpack is slowing me down. NO! I think to myself as I see three Senior boys glide past me, the hunger glowing in their eyes. By the time I finally make it to the cafeteria, the line of students is already out the door. I decide to nix the pizza and attempt to buy a yogurt concoction at Java City. The line is slightly shorter, and I can eat my food on the go. After 20 minutes, it is my turn to purchase my lunch, but alas I have forgotten my lunch numbei. I can never remember it and those lunch ladies never cut me a break! I quickly maneuver in and out of the crowd into the small cafeteria, where I collapse into a seat next to my friends. They all brown-bagged it and are practically finished. I get one beautiful mouthful in before Mr. Clark enters and announces that class is starting. I think tomorrow I'll stick with moms homemade Pb&j. Lunchtime Lessons \"I've learned not to eat deli meat that has been sitting around for seven hours. At school I eat Wheat Thins and apples and thats pretty much all.\" - Kate Grannemann, senior \"I always check my seat before I sit down. I check for accuracy and so I know there isn't anything spilled on it.\" - Kara Manton, senior \"You have to go early or late because if you hit the lines, you're dead.\" - Nic Baltas, junior 42 Outside Dining Where Do You Like To Eat Lunch? A group of merry seniors enjoy their lunchtime feast at the round tables in the small cafeteria. Even though they have \"A\" Lunch, they still agree that lunch is the best time of the day. Underclassmen test the new \"leather\" booth installed over summer break. This is one of the most sought after places to eat lunch and reservations must be made a period in advance. ® The tables given as a gift from the class of 2006 are put to good use every lunchtime with good weather. These picnic tables provide a place for students to eat outside and escape from the busy cafeteria. 53% The cafeteria’ s° 1 never miss the big food fights. 38% The smal1 catena, I don't associate with those other people. Outside, so I'm not overwhelmed by the cafeteria funk. Location, Location, Location Freshmen- Sophomore Semi Formal t if The Freshmen-Sophomore Semi Formal Dance had a great turnout of students this year. Over 500 kids from Masco and other neighboring schools arrived at the Sheraton Ferncroft on Friday, January 25th dressed up and ready for an enjoyable evening. The DJ played an upbeat selection of music that kept everyone dancing late into the night. The dance floor this year was also especially colorful and festive because of the glowsticks given to the students at the beginning of the dance. Towards the end of the night, the chaperones raffled off several gift certificates to stores like Abercrombie and Dicks Sporting Goods, as well as iTunes gift cards. f Leadership Rafting Trip 1 September 8- September 10 2007 Masco's leaders were full of \"Moxie\" when they braved class four rapids on the Penobscot River in September. From Prom Chair to Class President, everyone holding a leadership position piled into a coach bus for the five and a half hour trip to Millinocket, Maine. A local rafting company, Moxie, guided the students down twelve foot waterfalls and through thrashing Whitewater in their signature orange boats. \"We surfed on the holes until our booties came off! , said senior Treasurer, Madeleine Hardy. Another memorable part of the trip was the Summit Challenge. Junior Jim Dixon was the first student to attempt to consume the fourteen scoops of ice cream, topped with two bananas, four snickers bars, M&Ms, cherries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. Other students followed suit and ordered their own colossal ice cream sundaes. All in all, the leadership trip was an unforgettable experience that succeeded in forming bonds between the leaders of each class. Freshmen Walk October 12, 2007 Every year, the school hosts Freshmen Orientation Day to help the incoming freshmen adjust to their new environment. The event is planned and executed by Peer Leaders, upperclassmen selected based on their leadership qualities. The freshmen are split up into groups of ten to fifteen students guided by three peer leaders. The peer groups allow the new students to remain in their comfort zone while meeting upperclassman and teachers and familiarizing themselves with the high school building. Throughout the year, the Peer Leaders maintain a connection with their group through several freshman-only events. These activities include peer group breakfasts, the Twelve Days of Giving, and the Freshmen Walk. The Freshmen Walk is the biggest activity the peer leaders plan for the new class. On Friday, October 12th the class of 2011 and the Peer Leaders walked six miles through Topsfield. Each student received donations from friends and family to contribute to the Jimmy Fund. The Freshmen accumulated an astounding $25,000, more than any previous class raised during this event. Do you ever hear anything in the bathroom, hallway, cafeteria that you can't believe?

Ever since, he has progressed into a talented student artist through various art courses here at Masco. Johns artwork reflects his personality, as seen in his goofy-faced self-portrait. He enjoys working in many mediums, but doesnt like pencil. Johns artistic achievements are balanced out by his strong academic and athletic careers. From an outside perspective, John doesnt seem like the typical art kid, but in reality, it is one of his true passions. John Knight 52 Hours upon hours of work have transformed Grade Day from a three-year-old girl scribbling flowers on a home video, to an award- winning artist.

Although the majority of the team consisted of underclassmen , the girls were able to come together more so than in previous years. Early on in the season, the girls were able to get a feel for each other while playing in the Pingree Tournament. Later in the season, the girls spent time bonding off the ice with pasta parties, fundraisers, and the occasional post-practice trip to Papa Gino's. The combination of veteran and underclassmen talent allowed the team to move in a new direction. The girls concluded the season by continuing their tradition of awarding scholarships to the graduating senior athletes. Seniors: J. Croyle, A. Dooley, D. Hall, A. McCarthy Juniors: L. Cerratim, H.

Bjornstad, M. Broms, P. Carolan, N. Clay, I. Fisk, J. Hamburger, M. Rich, S. Schwartz The Boys Ski Team hit the slopes in early December. The large volume of snow in the beginning of the season was a nice change from last year when most of December was spend doing dry-land training. Though many talented racers graduated last year, the younger team members were able to step up to fill their \"ski boots\". This young talent was especially important when several of the upperclassmen injured themselves and missed races. Despite these setbacks, the boys worked hard to achieve a record of 4-6. Perhaps the most memorable part of the season was the last race, when the senior captains skied in wetsuits in memory of Brian Schwartz, who started this tradition. The boys excelled this year, overcoming every obstacle they faced, and the program has high hopes for next season.

The entire team worked hard during the shortened dry-land season and strengthened their legs through long wall- sits and numerous lunges. When the races began, the girls were prepared and won their first three races. They continued their success during the rest of the season and finished with an impressive record of 7-3. With one of the best seasons in the history of the program, this year's team pulled together and beat their rival, North Andover. The captains, Caroline Broms, Danielle Famolare, and Maryn Manning, are hopeful for the season next year.
