Triple M Classic Rock Digital Locations Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth Formats DAB+ radio, internet, mobile Slogan The Rock That Started It All Is Back! Debut 25 November 2013 Owner Southern Cross Austereo

Triple M Classic Rock Digital is a classic rock format digital-only radio station, broadcast in Australian capital cities by Southern Cross Austereo's Triple M radio network. The station can be heard on DAB+ FM radios, mobile phones, and on-line. Triple M Classic Rock Digital was officially launched at 10.00 a.m. (AEDT) on 25 November 2013, and replaced its low rating and defunct sister station Radar Radio. It plays music without interruption with no announcer talkback, and only breaks every few songs for network promos and competition announcements.

Launch

Southern Cross Austereo hinted at the launch of a new digital-only station with the registration of the Triple M Classic Rock Digital domain name (triplemclassicrock.com) on 23 July 2013,[1] and a tweet which alluded to the promise of a 'big digital radio announcement' by the Director of Digital and Innovation at Southern Cross Austereo, Clive Dickens, on 28 October 2013.[2] At one minute to midnight, a news article was published on the Triple M website, entitled 'Triple M Classic Rock Digital', detailing the name and date of launch of the new station.[3] A formal press release was issued on 29 October 2013, with the Head of Southern Cross Austereo Digital Radio, Jaime Chaux stating:

'Digital Radio for SCA is all about creating new listening choices. Classic rock is a much loved genre in Australia– endless songs and stories from an amazing era and so many of them long lost from the radio dial. We can't wait to get it out there via our newest digital radio offering.' — Jaime Chaux, Southern Cross Austereo press release[4]

To tie in with the launch, Triple M cashed in on the recent departure of stalwart morning announcers on their sister Sydney station 2Day FM 104.1, Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O. Both had been lured to rival FM network Australian Radio Network (ARN), which was attempting to rebrand their Sydney easy-listening format station Mix 106.5FM to pop focused KIIS-FM[5][6] as part of their deal. Triple M Classic Rock Digital would launch by playing music by American rock band Kiss for 24 hours non-stop,[7] and be temporarily called 'Kiss Radio'.[8]

AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Queen, Skyhooks, the Angels and Neil Young are on heavy rotation.

On 16 April 2014, network coverage was extended to Perth, Western Australia with the launch of Triple M Classic Rock Digital at midday (WST) in that city.[9] Despite listener protests, on 3 June 2014, Triple M Classic Rock Digital in Adelaide merged services with 104.7 Triple M.

On 25 March 2014, Triple M announced that they, in collaboration with radio station talkSPORT, would broadcast the English Barclays Premier League and FA Cup match commentary for the remainder of the 2014 season.[11]

Slogan

Triple M Classic Rock Digital launched with the tagline 'The Rock That Started It All Is Back!', which alludes to their classic rock format and that it was this music that launched Australia's first ever commercial FM radio station, 2MMM, on 2 August 1980.[12]

Logo

The station uses the existing Triple M logo featuring the character 'Dr. Dan', an electric guitar-playing satyr with wings, inspired by the artwork of Australian illustrator Peter Ledger, with influence from Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records logo of a winged Apollo. It uses a modified Avant Garde Gothic Bold font for the phrase 'Classic Rock'.

Criticisms

Since its launch, listeners have publicly complained about what actually constitutes 'classic rock' on their playlist, with New Wave and reggae artists being broadcast to the exclusion of a number of established rock groups. The social media pages for the network regularly posts trivia and images on artists that are never played on the station. Examples of these include Cold Chisel, post-Bon Scott era AC/DC, Travelling Wilburys, and Aerosmith. Sports programmes are also broadcast with very little notice. On 15 September 2015, an NFL game between the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers, complete with American radio station announcements, was broadcast leaving listeners puzzled. American football is not popular and very rarely broadcast in Australia. A flood of complaints on the Triple M Classic Rock Digital Facebook page resulted in a number of followers being blocked and removed without warning. Since Facebook announced the introduction of a 'dislike' button, the station's Facebook page has removed users critical of their programming.
