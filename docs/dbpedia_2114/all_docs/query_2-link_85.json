KLIF became a trendsetter that\n\nwas reportedly the most copied station in America.\n\nMcLendon was one of the creators of Top 40 playlists,\n\na staple of programming that continues today. .\n\nWhether you knock AM radio today for its relentless static or its lack of music, this is where it all began. The early 20th century brought the first radio stations to the Dallas-Fort Worth area: KFJZ (with roots dating back to 1917,) WRR (in 1920,) WPA, WBAP and WFAA (all in 1922,) and the rest is history (well, almost!) AM started out as a freewheeling, 'throw up a transmitter and go with it' gamut of radio waves in its earliest days, with a couple of assigned frequencies (833 kc [primarily news and weather] and 618.6 kc [primarily music.]) and virtually no rules to allow a fair distribution of the dial for broadcasters. (By mid-1922, all five DFW stations agreed to a timesharing plan on each frequency.) November 11, 1928 was declared \"National Frequency Allocation Day,\" when the Federal Radio Commission (FRC, predecessor to the FCC) brought organization to the dial by assigning dedicated frequencies to the strongest stations, and culling out many of the small-time opportunists who weren't serious about broadcasting. Powerhouse WBAP was awarded a clear channel position on the dial; it is one of only a small handful of stations in the nation that's allowed to blast its signal to a reported 42 states! And to honor the art of \"DX-ing\" (distance listening,) Wednesdays after 3PM were declared \"Silent Night\" in the '20s...low-powered stations turned off their transmitters so that high-powered stations across the US could be easily received on anyone's dial.\n\nAM radio in Dallas-Fort Worth, as with the rest of the nation, was mostly entertainment and news programming in its infancy; however, its value and importance was secured during World War II as the center of information for a concerned public. With the introduction of television to the masses in the late 1940s, radio's demise was assumed to be imminent. Gordon McLendon didn't let that happen: In 1947, he signed on KLIF, featuring a music format. Other stations soon followed, and local radio found its second life. The invention of the transistor, and subsequently the development of lightweight, portable radios, along with the inclusion of radios in cars, helped the reinvented band find a new audience with people on the go. McLendon and Todd Storz's simultaneous discovery of the \"Top 40\" in the 1950s gave radio a special popularity among the younger generation, and his KLIF, along with KBOX and KFJZ, developed formats to capitalize on current music, especially rock and roll. Other local stations modified their formats to concentrate on news, country, rhythm and blues, or Spanish. While KLIF posted incredible ratings during the 1950s and 1960s, others like KRLD and WBAP found successful programming niches that catered to older audiences.\n\n.\n\nAM's popularity and far-reaching capabilities were used by the government to launch a civil defense system, CONELRAD (\"CONtrol of ELectromagnetic RADiation,\") the forerunner of the Emergency Broadcast System (now Emergency Alert System,) in 1951. (WRR engineer Rick Teddlie co-created the CONELRAD system.) While the nuclear threat of the Cold War prompted the dedication of a national broadcast frequency, it wasn't until 1958 that the system was first used for weather alerts. Broadcasts were originally dedicated to 640 and 1240 kc in all cities, and all regular broadcast stations (AM, FM and TV) were to go silent when threatening information was aired. EBS replaced CONELRAD in 1963, and EAS replaced EBS in 1997.\n\n.\n\nBy the early 1970s, however, listeners were slowly discovering the FM band and migrated to it for its static-free, stereophonic broadcasts; by 1978, FM overtook AM as the most popular band. Attempts to revitalize AM have netted little; AM Stereo was proposed in 1958 and introduced in 1982 to big fanfare; many car manufacturers began to integrate AM Stereo into their radio units, and KRQX-570 became the first local AM Stereo station in 1983. However, five different companies were pushing their systems to become the broadcasting standard. This included Kahn Communications (who was at the forefront of AM Stereo development in 1958,) Harris, Motorola, Magnavox and Belar Electronics. Motorola's C-Quam system was finally chosen by the FCC as the standard in 1993, but, by that time, the luster had worn off. Broadcasters who were leery of buying AM Stereo equipment in the early 1980s (fearing that it would become obsolete at the whim of the FCC) slowly abandoned interest in the concept by the late 1980s.\n\n.\n\nAlso in the late 1980s, The FCC decided to extend the AM band to 1710 kHz. This would allow new investors to start new stations from scratch (as the pool of available frequencies was quickly drying up) and would permit existing restricted-signal stations to move into an uncrowded part of the band and beef up their coverage area. Automakers and consumer electronics manufacturers began adding the extended band to their units in the early 1990s, and existing stations were permitted to simulcast on their new frequencies beginning in the mid-1990s. By December, 2007, all simulcasting stations were required to give up their original frequency and begin broadcasting solely on the new dial position.\n\n.\n\nBut this is not to say AM is totally dead, or ever will be in Dallas...both WBAP and KRLD ranked in the Top 5 for many decades, according to Arbitron. Kahn Communications is working on improvements to their original AM Stereo concept. Ibiquity, another player who is developing solutions to the substandard sound, marketed a digital broadcasting system for AM stations (known as IBOC/HD) in recent years.\n\n.\n\nSTATIONS: 540 . .\n\nKDFT, Ferris.

(Thanks to former WBAP anchor Ward Andrews for this trivia tidbit.)\n\n.\n\n\"Black Night,\" a 1937-38 theater-of-the-mind horror program, was a 30-minute, WBAP-produced nighttime drama consisting of mostly Edgar Allan Poe horror story re-enactments, complete with sound effects and eerie narrations. Each show was preceded with the following warning: \"Any person with a weak heart or weak stomach is advised to switch the dial or take the consequences.\" Notables working in or on the show (some were part of \"The WBAP Players\") included June Harrison, Nelson Olmstead, Harry Hoxworth, Ken Douglas, A. M. Woodford, Morris Steinberg, Virginia Wiltten (writer who adapted Poe's and other stories for radio,) Johnny Sullivan, and music by Gene Baugh's orchestra and Don Gillis. (Thanks to historian Karl Schadow for all the research on this; if you have any more information or details about the \"Black Night\" program, contact Karl at bluecar91@hotmail.com.)\n\n.\n\nTechnically, WBAP was the first station in the area to broadcast in stereo, albeit in an unconventional way. One channel was broadcast over WBAP-AM, with the other over WBAP-FM, creating a true stereo effect to those listeners who had two radios to pick up both frequencies! Bill Barclay and Lee \"Woody\" Woodward were the hosts of this broadcast in the 1950s; Woodward says, \"I don't recall that it generated a lot of talk, but it was the first.\"\n\n.\n\nBefore venturing into the radio business, owner Amon Carter told his circulation manager at the Star-Telegram, Harold Hough, that, \"if this radio thing is going to be a menace to newspapers, maybe we had better own the menace!\" When asked about possible start-up costs, Hough told Carter, \"We can get the transmitter for $200, and it shouldn't cost more than $50 to set it up.\" Carter replied, \"All right. We'll put $300 into this radio thing, and when that's gone, we're out of the radio business.\" That was over 100 years ago now, and Carter's investment proved to be a wise one! .\n\n850\n\n.\n\n.\n\nKJON, Carrollton.

Thereafter, each station operated independently, with the FM on automation (beginning in 1977.) Former employee Steve Eberhart explains: \"The AM jock had to babysit the FM automation system down the hall. It was our duty to change the tapes before they ran out to ensure the thing stayed on the air. We, being the live jocks on the Top 40 AM, couldn't have cared less, and many a time, the tapes ran out...One time, the tapes all ran out, which ended up cueing the last event of the day, a PSA cart which it played, cued up, and played again...and again...and again. A lady called in and said, 'I think you need to go check on your disc jockey; he keeps reading the same thing over and over!'\" Later, a security camera was set up so the AM jocks could see the reels getting empty. Broadcast with 1,000 watts. KIKM was regularly used as a \"farm team\" for KVIL-FM; over the years, KVIL stole Barnett, King and Eberhart from the station. Station broadcast 6AM-12AM.

KCAF was the third station to migrate from Wichita Falls (KGKO-570 and KAAM-620 were the others.) Station located at 9400 N. Central (in the former KVIL penthouse studios.) As a Wichita Falls station, KCAF was previously known as KXXL (2/1/2000-6/27/2002, although station was already dark when Schum purchased it; former KXXL owner Dick Moran sued Schum to get the license back,) KTUB (9/4/1998-2/1/2000,) KWFT (9/25/1995-9/4/1998; taking the former longtime, historic calls from 620AM, which went dark in 1994 and became KAAM in 10/1995,) KNIN (1961-11/9/1983; 10/7/1991-9/25/1995,) KKCR (10/19/1990-10/7/1991,) KGTM (11/9/1983-10/19/1990,) KSYD (19551961,) KFDX (19471955) and KFDF (4/1947-10/1947.)\n\n.\n\nSIDEBAR: WHY DID A RADIO STATION SIGN OFF AFTER JUST THREE DAYS ON THE AIR???\n\nMany rumors and much conjecture surrounded KCAF after its quick fall. Articles in the Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Observer painted owner Schum as the bad guy, going into the transaction undercapitalized and with little business experience. Dave Schum agreed to an interview for this website in 2004, and the following timeline is based on documentation and his personal recollection of those events. This is not meant to explain all sides of the story; others who spoke to me on the subject had varying observations, and further input or challenges to the following information by those involved would be welcome and will be posted. I also encourage you to click the Observer link above for another take on the story. I claim NO responsibility for the accuracy contained in the following summary:\n\n.\n\nAfter receiving a license for 990 in 1997, station owner and Dallas restauranteur Dave Schum hired Scott Savage in 2002 to put together a format and hire talent to be used on Schum's dormant frequency. The process became a rush job right off the bat. The pricey, former KVIL penthouse studios were rented, which were left stripped and bare (and early hires brought furniture from home to work from.) Ira Lipson, longtime programming consultant who had come up with the \"Zoo\" idea for KZEW years earlier, was brought in to develop the format. Savage did all the hiring and arranged for all the working capital, but finances ran short very quickly. Savage used his personal credit card to pay for some needed studio equipment (Schum estimates about $5,000 worth.) Some of the operations employees became aware of the cash shortage, but pushed ahead to get the station on the air anyway, reportedly at Savage's insistence. According to Schum, most of the on-air talent was signed to long-term contracts (six years, in some cases.) Already, there were reservations from the staff about the station not being ready in time, and the power output being poor (a much-needed power upgrade CP was left in limbo due to financial shortages.) Putting off the start date was considered, but the billboard company put heat on the station to run all 60 advertisements according to the original date planned.\n\nOn the premiere date, 10/21/2002, Schum realized that he wouldn't be able to make the first payroll. First, Schum approached Savage about a loan to cover payroll; Savage agreed, but then reneged. Schum then checked into bridge financing (a short-term loan to cover immediate needs,) but was turned down for a $1.5 million request. He then offered to sell the station to Savage. Savage, who Schum says had already formed a consortium on the side and was actively seeking a local station to buy anyway, contacted his own business partner, Ed Ferreri (dba Pinnacle Broadcasting,) who offered Schum a pitiful $1 up front, and a lump payment of $250,000 later for the entire operation. (A reasonable price for a working, rimshot AM station at the time would have been $6-$10 million.) Schum balked at the lowball offer. On the second day of operations, October 22, some employees received paychecks that did indeed cash, but HR was told to not pass out any more. An employee meeting held that evening allowed Schum to explain what was going on, and all of the employees decided to go forth and keep the station on the air anyway...provided Schum accepted Savage's buyout offer. Savage indicated that he had the cash to cover payroll, but wouldn't cover it if Schum didn't sell him the station. At 3PM the following day, October 23, the employees were gathered again for Schum to announce that payroll would still not be met, and at 7PM, Schum told the group that he had refused Savage's offer. Everyone then packed their bags and walked out, after a mere three days on the air.\n\n.\n\nSchum's ongoing contention is that Savage always had his sights set on wrestling the station away from him, and that Savage rushed the premiere process along and made the station doomed to fail. Schum identified one employee, who was a friend and former co-worker of Savage's, who engaged in theatrics during the meetings to galvanize the rest of the employees against Schum. He also blames CFO Carla Phillips for hastily cutting the check for the billboards instead of making payroll. Regardless, Schum sought bankruptcy to protect his assets, and was filed on by Savage, Ira Lipson and TM Century (local jingle service,) along with many of the employees who were not paid and/or had contracts. By early 2004, Schum said that he was through most of the process of paying off those debts, and that 990 would again take to the airwaves that April. While Schum's second attempt at running a station lasted longer, it was met with much of the same financial woes, and ended up being sold to a creditor at auction in October, 2005.\n\n.\n\n1000/1005/1025 et al.\n\n.\n\nKTCU, Fort Worth. \"Carrier current\" and low-power AM station established 9/1948 at 1005 kc, then to 750 kc in spring, 1949; relocated to 640 kc on 1/2/1950.
