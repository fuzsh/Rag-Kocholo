Experience suggests that these circumstances occur very rarely.\n\nAny decision to cancel classes, delay the opening of school, or close College offices in the wake of a weather-related emergency will be taken by the Vice President for Student Life. The Vice President for Student Life, in consultation with the Director of Campus Safety and/or the Director of Physical Plant, will be responsible for assembling any information on external or internal circumstances – for example, the condition of area roads – that are necessary to make an informed decision.\n\nWhenever possible, decisions necessitated by inclement weather will be made as early as possible, generally no later than 6:30 a.m. the day of the concern. This decision will be communicated to the following broadcast outlets through the use of the College’s emergency notification system:\n\nTelevision\n\nKAIT-TV, Jonesboro (Channel 2 on Batesville Cable)\n\nKTHV-TV, Little Rock (Channel 11 on Batesville Cable)\n\nKATV-TV, Little Rock (Channel 7 on Batesville Cable)\n\nKARK-TV, Little Rock (Channel 4 on Batesville Cable)\n\nLocal Cable Channel 6 (Suddenlink)\n\nAM Radio\n\nKAAB-AM, Batesville (1130 AM)\n\nKBTA- AM, Batesville (1340 AM)\n\nFM Radio\n\nKBTA/SKY- FM, Batesville (99.5 FM)\n\nKFFB-FM, Fairfield Bay (106.1 FM)\n\nKIYS-FM, Jonesboro (101.9 FM)\n\nKWOZ-FM, Batesville (103.3 FM)\n\nKZLE-FM, Batesville (93.1 FM)\n\nEmployees and students are requested to tune in to these broadcast outlets for information about the possible cancellation of classes or closure of school. Please do not call the College switchboard with inquires about school closings.\n\nAlso, in the event of a weather related emergency, College officials will notify the College community of the cancellation of classes, delay of opening of school, or closure of College offices through the use of the College’s emergency notification system. Students, faculty, staff, and other concerned parties will receive an e-mail message and/or a text message on their cellular phone notifying them of the situation.\n\nIn the event that the College remains open but adverse weather conditions seriously disrupt area roads:\n\nNon-residential students who feel that they cannot get to school safely should inform the Student Life Office (307-7314) or the Provost’s office (307-7202)."
