        "text": "Recent articles have highlighted the negative aspects of mass communication. While reviewing my interest in the state of communication media, I began thinking about my own specific reasons for entering this industry, of my transition from computer science. While the failings of modern media have been made clear, there are many more successes that go unnoticed. I wouldn’t be here if they didn’t exist. There’s a bright future peeking over the horizon.\n\nI grew up with an interest in radio, specifically talk format. I’ve previously covered the manner in which the FCC and lawyers have steadily eroded AM and FM with excessive content regulation. I’ve also stated that the last bastion of hope for radio is satellite distribution, like SiriusXM.\n\nXM is the mainstream radio market with the highest level of free expression. XM is to radio content what premium channels are to cable television. However, even premium TV has content limitations, and regulators have come down hard on them at times. XM itself has faced backlash over the past few years for harmless incidents. As it has become more normalized, it has also begun to follow the same path as FM in its early stages of regulation. Still, there’s something to be said about having established, diverse radio personalities nationwide and concentrating them in one place to work together, mostly uncensored.\n\nA good case study involves the Opie & Anthony Show, a top rated, unfiltered comedy talk show devoted to free expression and opposing political correctness. My first exposure to them was in late ’90s Boston, on the local WAAF FM station. They were in their infancy and followed plenty of the generic industry trends as “shock jocks”. However, compared to the more filtered radio at the time, they were much more appealing to mature listeners in the same vein as Howard Stern.\n\nThat is, until they falsely reported claims of Boston’s mayor Thomas Menino dying in a car crash under ridiculous circumstances. Context is important, though: this was aired on April Fools’ Day. Regardless, at the mayor’s insistence, they were fired for a most obvious joke, the result of overreacting FCC censors and word of mouth outrage devoid of context.\n\nThey remained steadfast and did not change their style upon moving to WNEW in New York; they were even syndicated in Boston again shortly after. Four years later, a tasteless stunt committed by a caller had them removed again. The caller simulated sex with his wife in a famous church while a comedian narrated the fake act. Although the stunt was unseen, being on the radio, the caller’s misguided attempt at humor resulted in a half million dollar fine.\n\nDuring appeals, parent company Viacom decided to instead have the violation proceedings dismissed, in exchange for a multimillion dollar settlement and the show’s permanent removal from the air. The show was hit with a non-compete clause by Infinity Broadcasting, which shelved them for two years and paid out their contracts. The broadcaster and the regulators were working as if they were the same entity.\n\nIn the interim, XM recognized their talent for unfiltered humor, immediately signing them. Debuting on the platform, they led a large exodus of AM and FM talk radio stars to satellite radio.\n\nConsumers liked them, even if others found them to be tasteless and crude; they had a massive and dedicated fanbase. Satellite gave these listeners hope for a future of accessible, uncensored talk radio by placing the biggest names in shock comedy, Opie & Anthony and Howard Stern, under one medium where they could express their unfiltered thoughts. Before XM, there was no legitimate alternative to mainstream radio, no method to access such content. Now they had one.\n\nHowever, XM began talks of a merger with their competitor, Sirius, imposing new content restrictions. This was perceived as a way to garner support from government officials to allow such a large merger. They dodged antitrust litigation and successfully merged two years later. While negligible when compared to AM and FM regulations, it angered the fans who could not easily access the mature content that they wanted for many years prior. FCC regulation on mass media was the culprit and satellite radio had given them hope, but was now threatening to take it away again. If satellite went the way of terrestrial radio, they would again have no alternative.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe satellite format shares many similarities with another form of new media in the social networking age: podcasting. Not limited to audio, as many include video, podcasting involves a direct-to-consumer approach with digital downloads from websites, which many comedians and hosts have started releasing. They differ from YouTube channels and vlogs by offering higher quality production, a lack of restrictions and privatized monetary model, generally involving established hosts with little to no middleman. By removing the distributor, creators can transmit unfiltered and unregulated content that the consumer can access in full on their own time.\n\nBoth satellite radio and podcasting were designed to reach large audiences without the hassle of syndication contracts, much like the transition from analog to digital television. While live video feeds on the internet are still quite limited by both receiver and transmission bandwidth, the trend can’t be ignored: everything is moving toward mass communication via internet, direct to consumer.\n\nWill removing these barriers to entry oversaturate the market? Only time can answer that question.\n\nComing full circle, Opie & Anthony were more than just crude shock jocks, but also innovators in this model. While Howard Stern would occasionally film portions of his show for late night TV airings, host Anthony Cumia set up a live viewing system using the video chat service Paltalk, allowing fans to actually watch the show. The audience could even chat with each other and directly interact with the hosts.\n\nAnthony would also occasionally stream an uncensored bonus show at his home studio using Ustream. This became the inspiration for UFC commentator and comedian Joe Rogan, a frequent guest of the show, to launch his own video podcast, the audio of which was also aired on Opie & Anthony’s SiriusXM channel itself. Rogan’s show is now becoming one of the top shows on the internet, and rivals many in the traditional markets.\n\nTV OnDemand services, Netflix, podcasts, XM, even video game systems and their online communities; all of them have been moving toward an epoch with similar communication models. Eventually, the outdated technology must switch to these upgraded systems as they become obsolete. It’s becoming ever-closer, an excellent opportunity to enter the media communication field, much like the Dot-Com bubble in the ’90s. Ideally it won’t end the same way.\n\nNot only will it be an excellent creative and financial opportunity, but it’s the clear next step in mass communication. What use will weak FM and AM frequencies be when everybody has a handheld device connected to the internet and the ability to access everything instantaneously, on their own time? As wireless signals get stronger every year and internet servers get cheaper, why wouldn’t cars have an internet connection and subscription model with countless nationwide channels? Satellite radio distribution already succeeded using this method with far more expensive infrastructure.\n\nConsumers hate advertisements and XM has very few, exclusively airing on the few terrestrial radio simulcasts and premium talk stations; with delayed playback, you can skip them. Internet shows are generally downloaded with short sponsorship ad reads, which can be skipped. AM and FM are littered with intrusive advertisements that can’t be skipped.\n\nThe only niche that traditional radio could hold for the foreseeable future is that of local news; satellite radio is barred by the FCC from airing localized content, in exchange for more lenient content regulation. Even then, social networking and digital television have drastically shifted consumer focus to national topics. As the internet market grows, there’s no reason to believe it won’t also saturate the local market as well.\n\nThe major technological innovations in both mass and interpersonal communication began decades prior, with functional internet and cell phones. This was followed by wireless internet, satellite radio, social networking and smartphones. Podcasting has actually been around for 10 years, since the iPod was released and Apple created a system to catalog them, but only recently started to become mainstream. They’re now easily accessible for regular use on all devices and carry higher quality programming that consumers actually want, a result of those prior innovations. Internet video casting is still maturing, held back by technical limitations, but its future is finally showing up on the horizon, as different types of media begin to combine into one fluid system.\n\nOnce thought impossible, interpersonal and mass communication are becoming united under one medium, as the internet is becoming more adept at handling both. You can directly message someone while sharing publicly accessible, monetized content using the same smartphone or computer application at the same time. The technical quality and speed of audio and video streaming are rapidly increasing. Computer and device processing is exponentially increasing.\n\nIn other words: a future of free communication is in sight."
