        "text": "AS the time neared 3 o'clock one Monday afternoon this summer, Joe Ferraro in all his guises manned the controls of WHVW-AM. The station was just finishing an hourlong set, ranging from Artie Shaw to Doc Watson to Ray Charles, that Mr. Ferraro had loaded into a broadcast computer earlier that week. Meanwhile, in his alter ego as J. P. Ferraro, rarefied host of ''Evening Concert,'' he was taping a Colorado Quartet CD of Schubert's ''Death and the Maiden'' with which to close that night's program. Then, after a short break for news, he switched the studio turntable to 78 r.p.m., reached into a metal box for a thick vinyl disc of ''Pipeline Blues'' by the rockabilly singer Moon Mullican, and introduced himself live as Pirate Joe, impresario of the ''Country Music Radio Show and Old Blues and R & B Extravaganzo.''\n\nAmid the flurry of musical activity, the remainder of WHVW's small suite of offices sat empty and silent. The station's only other employee, a combination of morning-show host and advertising sales manager, had gone home. Instead of a receptionist, an answering service took calls. When the studio grew too cold, Mr. Ferraro climbed atop a chair and covered the open vent of the air conditioner with a Marty Robbins LP. In this former five-and-10 on the desolate main street of a fading factory town, there was so little likelihood of a noisy intrusion that Mr. Ferraro broadcast with the studio door wide open.\n\nThis coexistence of the threadbare and the sophisticated, of bargain-basement finances and bracingly eclectic programming, defines WHVW and makes the 500-watt outlet at 950 AM one of the shrinking number of innovative, idiosyncratic stations on the commercial dial in the United States. Since Mr. Ferraro bought WHVW for $350,000 in 1992, it has defied the powerful trends in commercial broadcasting, both on AM and FM, toward chain ownership and tightly formatted programming. It combines the quaint mainstays of small-town radio -- ''Chamber of Commerce Chat,'' ''Pet Talk,'' ''The German Hour'' -- with music shows brimming with knowledge and taste. And it does all this on an annual budget of less than $200,000, smaller than that of many college stations.\n\n''It's so old that it's new,'' Mr. Ferraro, who is 53, said of his style. ''What you hear here is what all radio used to be like. It had that offbeat, eccentric quality to it. Radio has been fine-tuned to the point that everything you do has to be programmed to a maximal audience, even if it's 3 a.m. Broadcasting is an art form that's not practiced anymore. It's an art form that's been lost. It's an art form you don't get from playlists and consultants. But it is an art form.''"
