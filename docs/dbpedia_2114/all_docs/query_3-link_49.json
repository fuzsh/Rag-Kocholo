'The Haters Are Gonna Hate,' Says Frontman Chad Kroeger\n\nTHE MOUTH, MARCH 5TH, 2015 –– As you'll see, there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes at a concert before you ever take your seat. Especially, when the venue is a hockey rink. In addition to an in-depth interview with Nickleback frontman, Chad Kroeger, Quad Cities/97X beloved Dwyer and Michaels added a time-lapse video of the bands conversion of this rink before their recent performance at the iWireless Center in Moline, Ill. Chad Kroeger then sat down for an extended chat with the morning duo covering everything from the band’s love of the hit Canadian show The Trailer Park Boys. Kroeger also discussed being one of the most polarizing acts in rock and dealing with critical backlash. The vocalist explained, “Critics, it’s not cool to like Nickelback, right? A critic would be ostracized from the critic club if they wrote anything nice about us. We’ve made eight albums, been a band for 19 years, still touring, still making records, still having a blast doing it, so it really doesn’t matter what they say. The haters are gonna hate. But if you’re gonna make fun of the band, do a good job.” He went on to add that he’s aware of the haters and the band themselves actually enjoy some of the more humorous comments. “We are the most self-deprecating band out there. We rip on ourselves, but at least when we do it, it’s clever.'
