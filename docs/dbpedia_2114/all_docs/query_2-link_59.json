        "text": "NOTE: Changes as of v5.0.0:\n\nPRs will be opened directly against main and the unstable branch will no longer be used\n\nVersion tags will be automatically created on each merge to main\n\nA release will be created on each major or minor version tag but not minor tags\n\nChecking out main is recommended over using a release artifact to stay on the latest version\n\nThis repo has significantly diverged from the original project microtony/RTLSDR-Airband so it has been been detached (ie no longer a fork).\n\nSpecific build support for rpiv1, armv7-generic, and armv8-generic have been deprecated for the new default native, see #447\n\nNOTE: Repo URL has moved to https://github.com/charlie-foxtrot/RTLSDR-Airband see #342 for info\n\nRTLSDR-Airband receives analog radio voice channels and produces audio streams which can be routed to various outputs, such as online streaming services like LiveATC.net. Originally the only SDR type supported by the program was Realtek DVB-T dongle (hence the project's name). However, thanks to SoapySDR vendor-neutral SDR library, other radios are now supported as well.\n\nUser's manual is now on the wiki.\n\nI hereby express my gratitude to everybody who helped with the development and testing of RTLSDR-Airband. Special thanks go to:\n\nDave Pascoe\n\nSDR Guru\n\nMarcus Str√∂bel\n\nstrix-technica\n\ncharlie-foxtrot\n\nCopyright (C) 2022-2024 charlie-foxtrot\n\nCopyright (C) 2015-2022 Tomasz Lemiech szpajder@gmail.com\n\nBased on original work by Wong Man Hang microtony@gmail.com\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
