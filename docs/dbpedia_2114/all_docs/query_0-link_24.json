        "text": "Community host of The Gozza Strip\n\nIs there a story behind your on-air name? Gozza has been my MC/Nickname since high school. It’s a slicker version of my real last name.\n\nWhat’s your show about and when does it air? The first hour spotlights the best in hip-hop from the Great Lakes State and hour 2 showcases worldwide classic hip-hop. Fridays from 3:30 pm-5:30 pm. For several years my show aired Monday and Tuesday afternoons from 1-3.\n\nHow long has your show been on the air? Since October 2005\n\nWhat do you like to do in your spare time? I write lyrics, record, and perform either solo as Gozza or with my Hip Hop group the Artfull Dodgers. I also produce beats and run my own recording studio. You can always catch me vibing out to music or watching a good movie. I have huge record and DVD collections.\n\nTell us about a funny incident that happened during your show. Once a listener came down to the station and begged me to let him co-host my show. I had to tell him, “Sorry, I work alone. That’s the way i like it.”\n\nHave you gotten any strange requests during your show? I get strange requests all the time. Some of them include “The Battlestar Galactica” theme, and some weirdo wanted to hear a song by Charles Manson.\n\n￼\n\nIf you knew you were going to be stranded on a desert island and could choose only 10 songs, what would they be?\n\nWow, that’s a hard one. Let me think……..OK, here’s my 10 Stranded Island jams-\n\n1-Sublime-“Doin Time”\n\n2- Pete Rock & CL Smooth-“T.R.O.Y.”\n\n3-Beastie Boys-“The New Style”\n\n4-Eric B. & Rakim-“Microphone Fiend”\n\n5-Al Green-“Lets Stay Together”\n\n6-Del The Funkee Homosapien-“Catch A Bad One”\n\n7-MC Breed-“Ain’t No Future In Yo Frontin”\n\n8-Rage Against The Machine-“Killing In the Name of”\n\n9-Wu-Tang Clan-“Protect Yo Neck”\n\n10-Public Enemy-“Bring The Noise”\n\nWhat is one of your most memorable concert experiences? My first Hip Hop concert was so fresh. It was the Soul Assassins Tour in 1993 with Cypress Hill, House of Pain, Funkdoobiest, and The Whooliganz. So cool seeing these Golden Era artists in their primes.\n\nTell us something about yourself that people might find surprising. I write and direct my own movies."
