        "text": "Do you believe some people are not asking for your services because they don't think/know that they need it? There are people who had lands but never knew the importance of having a technical file till I reached out to them, talked with them and they saw the need to do it. Some of them thought they didn't need me as they'd already surveyed their lands, but didn't know that I could serve them beyond that. There are people who have small businesses, etc, but didn't know the importance of database or how to create a data base for their clients and all. But when I reached out with my Data Entry skills, they saw the need and took the offer. Don't just assume people don't want to work with you. Don't assume people know, or should already know by now what you do so there's no need to keep talking about it. Do not assume. Keep talking. But Ngweh, I already made a post about it... Sorry Ma'am/Sir, the algorithm didn't let me see the post so keep talking. Even if I did, change how you said it and still tell me(us) again. Don't assume we already know because I have no idea... Lol. Who did you talk to about your products/services today? #landsurvey #surveylife #ScaleUp #intentionalliving #melaniengweh\n\nAhhh, Tuesday after Labor Day - we're in it now! üòÅ üéâ Ready or not, \"year-end giving\" is upon us. (Year-end giving is a construct we've created, but that's a story for another post . . . ) What can you do to make your last quarter of the calendar year an absolute success? Data. Yep, data. Clean your data. I've done about 8,000,003 data audits this summer (I might be exaggerating a smidge) - the number 1 opportunity I see across nonprofits of all shapes, sizes, budgets . . . . . simple, easy data quality opportunities. Here's how to tackle it: - Find your records that have quality issues - no address, name fields messed up, no email, etc. etc. etc. - Sort 'em by recency and size of previous giving - i.e. prioritize your \"best\" donors. (Ugh, \"best\", no donor is \"better\" than another, but you know what I mean . . . ) - Tackle 5 per day. - That's it, just 5. It'll take - 30 minutes? Maybe. - Fix the misspelled name, correct the state/zip field, look up the address. Use it a rest break between massive deadlines. \"I'm just going to do 5 right now and then I'll get a coffee.\" Doesn't sound like a lot but you know that old story about tossing starfish back in the sea? \"It made a difference for that one.\" Same principle applies here - fix that record, \"it made a difference for that donor.\" And for us.\n\nThere are so many tasks that need to get done but not enough hours in the day. You‚Äôd like to focus on marketing or sales, or maybe networking with potential clients, but instead, you find yourself spending your time filling out spreadsheets or looking up stats on competitors. Emerald Virtual Assistance loves to hear stories such as these. Why? Because we offer data entry and research to every client who walks through our front door. If you‚Äôre losing your mind from the burden of these tasks, we can help lighten the load. #dataentry #research #va #client Read more at our blog: https://buff.ly/43XsZbT"
