        "text": "As a child, Johnjay Van Es always dreamed of being on the radio. He applied for an internship at 91X in San Diego in 1990 and eventually started working in sales for a number of radio stations, but he never let go of his lifelong dream to be on the air.It wasn’t until 1996, after training with the LA-based improv troupe The Groundlings that he would get his first on-air job hosting a morning show on WKRQ in Cincinnati. After just three months on the air, he won the “Best of Cincinnati” award.After years of dominating the market in Cincinnati, Johnjay moved on to Houston, Texas and made his mark in the Country format.\n\nA chance meeting in New Orleans found Rich teaming up with Johnjay. The beginning of The Johnjay and Rich era began in 2001 with their first show airing on KRQQ in Tucson. In 2006, the program moved to KISS-FM in Phoenix, Ariz., and was syndicated in select markets nationwide.\n\nIn 2014, the program joined Premiere Networks lineup of nationally syndicated programs. Airing Monday through Friday from 5 to 10 a.m. MT, The Johnjay & Rich Show is a non-stop blend of pop culture, news and events, welcoming a wide range of music artists, news makers and celebrities. Joined on-air by Kyle and Suzette, the show is a special brand of “reality radio,” in which listeners become an engaged and integral part of the program by interacting with the crew via all forms of social media -Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, email and text messaging.The Johnjay & Rich Show is also available on iHeartRadio, iHeartMedia's free all-in-one streaming music and live radio service, and www.johnjayandrich.com.\n\nIn addition to hosting their daily radio program, Johnjay and Rich remain steadfastly connected to the community via the Johnjay and Rich #LoveUp Foundation, a non-profit organization that strives to improve the quality of life for the most vulnerable children in our communities, with a primary focus on children living in the foster care system. The foundation’s annual Christmas Wish program provides thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts to deserving families in need during the holiday season. Johnjay and Rich also raised funds for #LoveUp’s sister foundation, #LovePup, by hosting adoption and fundraising events. To date, more than 500 rescue dogs have found forever homes through #LovePup’s ongoing efforts.In addition to serving children and pets, the radio hosts raise thousands of dollars for other worthy causes including disaster relief efforts nationwide."
