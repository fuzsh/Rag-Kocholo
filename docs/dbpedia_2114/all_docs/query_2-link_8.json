The station is owned and operated by Newcap Radio, and currently broadcasts a classic hits music format as \"LG 104.3.\" The station was licensed as CHHR-FM by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on May 30, 2008. The station started test transmissions at 104.1 MHz on June 1, 2009, and officially commenced broadcasting on July 1, 2009, under the ownership of Shore Media Group, and aired an adult album alternative format, branded as \"Shore 104\". It was the second AAA station in Metro Vancouver, the other being CKPK-FM, owned by The Jim Pattison Group. On January 14, 2010, CHHR changed frequency to 104.3 MHz in a swap with Bellingham, Washington's KAFE, a move to reduce interference between KAFE and Covington, Washington-based KMCQ. In 2011, Astral Media proposed the takeover of CHHR from Shore Media Group, a proposal initially rejected by the CRTC. Astral would try again and announced a new planned purchase of CHHR on December 19, 2011, with a purchase price of $13.4 million.\n\nCIDR-FM is the callsign for a radio station, broadcasting at 93.9 FM in Windsor, Ontario. The station broadcasts an adult album alternative format using the brand name 93-9 The River. It is owned and operated by Bell Media. It is one of the few commercial adult album alternative stations in Canada and is the only one in Ontario, with the others located in British Columbia. It was also Canada's first AAA-formatted station at launch.\n\nCKPK-FM is a radio station in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It broadcasts at 102.7 MHz on the FM dial. As of 2012, the station is owned by the Jim Pattison Group and airs an adult album alternative format promoted as \"102.7 The Peak\". Founded in 1923, in the past the station has broadcast numerous formats on other frequencies, under the call signs CFXC, CJOR, CHRX and CKBD.\n\nCKKQ-FM, known as 100.3 The Q or The Q, is a broadcast radio station in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. CKKQ broadcasts online and at a frequency of 100.3 MHz on the FM band. The station has broadcast a mainstream rock format since its inception, but has a more classic rock sound since 2001, when sister station CKXM-AM/FM became The Zone @ 91.3 with the CJZN calls and an alternative rock format. It used to have an adult album alternative lean up until Pattison took over the station from OK Radio. The station placed 2nd in the Spring 2012 BBM Ratings for Victoria."
