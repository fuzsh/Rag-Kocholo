        "text": "Triple M Classic Rock Digital Locations Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth Formats DAB+ radio, internet, mobile Slogan The Rock That Started It All Is Back! Debut 25 November 2013 Owner Southern Cross Austereo\n\nTriple M Classic Rock Digital is a classic rock format digital-only radio station, broadcast in Australian capital cities by Southern Cross Austereo's Triple M radio network. The station can be heard on DAB+ FM radios, mobile phones, and on-line. Triple M Classic Rock Digital was officially launched at 10.00 a.m. (AEDT) on 25 November 2013, and replaced its low rating and defunct sister station Radar Radio. It plays music without interruption with no announcer talkback, and only breaks every few songs for network promos and competition announcements.\n\nLaunch\n\nSouthern Cross Austereo hinted at the launch of a new digital-only station with the registration of the Triple M Classic Rock Digital domain name (triplemclassicrock.com) on 23 July 2013,[1] and a tweet which alluded to the promise of a 'big digital radio announcement' by the Director of Digital and Innovation at Southern Cross Austereo, Clive Dickens, on 28 October 2013.[2] At one minute to midnight, a news article was published on the Triple M website, entitled 'Triple M Classic Rock Digital', detailing the name and date of launch of the new station.[3] A formal press release was issued on 29 October 2013, with the Head of Southern Cross Austereo Digital Radio, Jaime Chaux stating:\n\n'Digital Radio for SCA is all about creating new listening choices. Classic rock is a much loved genre in Australia– endless songs and stories from an amazing era and so many of them long lost from the radio dial. We can't wait to get it out there via our newest digital radio offering.' — Jaime Chaux, Southern Cross Austereo press release[4]\n\nTo tie in with the launch, Triple M cashed in on the recent departure of stalwart morning announcers on their sister Sydney station 2Day FM 104.1, Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O. Both had been lured to rival FM network Australian Radio Network (ARN), which was attempting to rebrand their Sydney easy-listening format station Mix 106.5FM to pop focused KIIS-FM[5][6] as part of their deal. Triple M Classic Rock Digital would launch by playing music by American rock band Kiss for 24 hours non-stop,[7] and be temporarily called 'Kiss Radio'.[8]\n\nAC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Queen, Skyhooks, the Angels and Neil Young are on heavy rotation.\n\nOn 16 April 2014, network coverage was extended to Perth, Western Australia with the launch of Triple M Classic Rock Digital at midday (WST) in that city.[9] Despite listener protests, on 3 June 2014, Triple M Classic Rock Digital in Adelaide merged services with 104.7 Triple M.\n\nSpecial events\n\n25 November 2013 - 24-hour Kiss launch.\n\n16 December 2013 - All-day Rolling Stones tour special.\n\n9 January 2014 - David Bowie birthday special.\n\n15 February 2014 - 'Boss Day' Bruce Springsteen special.\n\n25 April 2014 - ANZAC special: All Australian and New Zealand classic rock.\n\n4 June 2014 - Tribute to Doc Neeson.\n\n11 June 2014 - Beatles Day.\n\n14 June 2014 - Led Zeppelin exclusive.\n\nRegular programming\n\nEssential Vinyl\n\nAn entire album is played from start to finish, with added interviews and stories from the artists.[10]\n\n9 February 2014 - Breakfast at Sweethearts by Cold Chisel.\n\n13 February 2014 - Harvest by Neil Young.\n\n3 March 2014 - Exile on Main St by the Rolling Stones.\n\n9 March 2014 - Sticky Fingers by the Rolling Stones.\n\n11 March 2014 - Let It Bleed by the Rolling Stones.\n\n23 March 2014 - Let There Be Rock by AC/DC.\n\n23 March 2014 - Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd.\n\n28 March 2014 - Breakfast in America by Supertramp.\n\n23 April 2014 - Frampton Comes Alive by Peter Frampton.\n\n8 May 2014 - Let It Be by the Beatles.\n\n12 May 2014 - Are You Experienced by the Jimi Hendrix Experience.\n\n16 May 2014 - Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys.\n\n19 May 2014 - Who's Next by the Who.\n\n20 May 2014 - With a Little Help from My Friends by Joe Cocker.\n\n23 May 2014 - Dynasty by Kiss.\n\n26 May 2014 - Rumours by Fleetwood Mac.\n\n30 May 2014 - Discovery by Electric Light Orchestra.\n\n13 June 2014 - Sgt.

Broadcast every Sunday between 9.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m. (AEST), and repeated the following Wednesday. First aired on 18 May 2014.\n\nSports coverage\n\nOn 25 March 2014, Triple M announced that they, in collaboration with radio station talkSPORT, would broadcast the English Barclays Premier League and FA Cup match commentary for the remainder of the 2014 season.[11]\n\nSlogan\n\nTriple M Classic Rock Digital launched with the tagline 'The Rock That Started It All Is Back!', which alludes to their classic rock format and that it was this music that launched Australia's first ever commercial FM radio station, 2MMM, on 2 August 1980.[12]\n\nLogo\n\nThe station uses the existing Triple M logo featuring the character 'Dr. Dan', an electric guitar-playing satyr with wings, inspired by the artwork of Australian illustrator Peter Ledger, with influence from Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records logo of a winged Apollo. It uses a modified Avant Garde Gothic Bold font for the phrase 'Classic Rock'.\n\nRadio specifications\n\nLocation Format Channel block Frequency (MHz) Spectrum band Bandwidth (kps) Sydney DAB+ 9A 202.928 III 56 Melbourne DAB+ 9B 204.640 III 56 Brisbane DAB+ 9B 204.640 III 56 Perth DAB+ 9B 204.640 III 56\n\nCriticisms\n\nSince its launch, listeners have publicly complained about what actually constitutes 'classic rock' on their playlist, with New Wave and reggae artists being broadcast to the exclusion of a number of established rock groups. The social media pages for the network regularly posts trivia and images on artists that are never played on the station. Examples of these include Cold Chisel, post-Bon Scott era AC/DC, Travelling Wilburys, and Aerosmith. Sports programmes are also broadcast with very little notice. On 15 September 2015, an NFL game between the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers, complete with American radio station announcements, was broadcast leaving listeners puzzled. American football is not popular and very rarely broadcast in Australia. A flood of complaints on the Triple M Classic Rock Digital Facebook page resulted in a number of followers being blocked and removed without warning. Since Facebook announced the introduction of a 'dislike' button, the station's Facebook page has removed users critical of their programming.\n\nReferences"
