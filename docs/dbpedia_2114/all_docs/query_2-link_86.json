Separating the large touchscreen monitor from the chassis allows the KW-Z1000W to be installed in a standard Double-DIN (4\") dash opening. The Double-DIN (4\") source units mounts in the dash and the 10.1\" touchscreen monitor attaches to the front of the source unit using the included hardware and integrated connector (dash kit, wiring harness, interface module, adapters are required and sold separately).\n\nFloating Touchscreen Monitor: Depending on your vehicle's factory radio location and the location of other factory equipment, you may need to adjust the mounting position of the touchscreen monitor in order to prevent impairment of vehicle driving operations. The floating touchscreen monitor offers depth, height, and tilt adjustments to ensure the best fit and usability in your vehicle's dash. The touchscreen monitor measures 10.3125\" (w) x 7.125\" (h) x 2.375\" (d) - including integrated connector and mounting bracket.\n\nDepth Adjustment: The depth adjustment lets you move the floating monitor forward or backward 0.8125\", allowing more or less space between the monitor and your vehicle's dash kit and dash for a better fit.\n\nHeight Adjustment: The floating monitor can be adjusted up or down 1.5625\" to prevent interference with climate controls, vents, and other factory equipment on your vehicle's dash for better fit and operation..\n\nTilt Adjustment: You can adjust the angle of floating monitor for better usability and visibility. In addition to its vertical 90 degree angle (default), the monitor can be tilted -10 degrees backward or +45 degrees forward.\n\nDouble-DIN Source Unit: The included source unit fits in a standard 4\" Double-DIN opening (applicable kit, harness, etc. will be required and sold separately for your vehicle). Once the source unit is mounted in the dash, the 10.1\" touchscreen monitor attaches and connects to the front of the source unit using the included hardware and integrated proprietary connector. All of the JVC KW-Z1000W''s inputs and outputs are found on the rear-panel of the source unit.\n\nChassis: including wiring harness, Bluetooth mic, and USB extension cable connections\n\nWidth: 7.005\"\n\nHeight: 3.945\"\n\nDepth: 6.735\" (w/o preout connections), 6.785\" (w/ preout connections)\n\nNose: including integrated connector and mounting bracket\n\nWidth: 6.675\"\n\nHeight: 3.805\"\n\nDepth: 1.125\"\n\nTouchscreen & Remote Control\n\n10.1\" Capacitive Touchscreen Monitor: The JVC KW-Z1000W features an all-new electrostatic capacitive touch panel and high-definition LCD panel with high luminance white LED backlighting that delivers vivid color, high-contrast, and crisp detail, as well as highly responsive touch operation.

The 10.1\" touchscreen monitor provides room for more information that is large and easy to see with just a glance. The capacitive touchscreen is highly responsive for simple and intuitive control.\n\nOptical Bonding Technology: The screen's optical bonding technology minimizes the refractive light index by bonding the liquid crystal module and the clear panel. It suppresses the reflection of the screen and maintains high visibility. In addition, since optical bonding does not have an air layer between the liquid crystal module and the clear panel, display visibility is not impaired by internal condensation, further enhancing its durability.\n\nGesture Controls: Touchscreen operations include tap, touch & hold, flick left or right, and swipe up or down - very similar to your smartphone or tablet device.
