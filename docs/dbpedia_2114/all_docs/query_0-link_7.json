We know how crucial it is that there is as little time wasted between the moment inspiration strikes and you being able to capture it, and how important it is that you can hear your ideas sounding polished and professional so you stay excited as you develop them.\n\nEach One Kit Wonder is captured to the same level of detail as our other libraries but comes fully mixed and ready to go so you can dive straight into writing creativity and hear your ideas immediately sound amazing.\n\nOne Kit Wonder: Classic Rock has the low, bangy snare, the huge boomy kick, and the big warm toms that you’d expect, alongside an array of oversized Big Beat cymbals, all recorded in the glorious Middle Farm live room, set up as reflective as possible for maximal ambience. The resulting sound is definitively classic in nature but with a bit of extra sparkle on top and the extended bottom that modern recording allows, compared to recordings from 50 years ago.\n\nKontakt Player Library (with full NKS integration) and can be used with Kontakt’s Free Player – no need to buy the full version of Kontakt to use GGD!\n\nMix ready drum tones - good to go out of the box\n\nA brand new, fully-featured and intuitive UI\n\nBuilt-in Groove player\n\nBuilt-in Master EQ, Parallel Compression and Reverb\n\nThe entire kit is tuned to perfection, so you’ll never be fighting against sour notes in your mix\n\nEvery sample is phase-coherent for easy layering\n\nIt's our hope that this sample library will remove frustrating barriers in your creative process so that you can enjoy making music to the fullest."
