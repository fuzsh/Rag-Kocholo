        "text": "An interesting summary here of the key priorities in health for the next government. Completely agree with all of them but my initial reaction is how overwhelming this will all feel to a new government. The red boxes of a new cabinet are going to be overflowing with urgent issues, that's before they are able to start asking questions about some of their own interests and 'nice to haves'. They'll need to do this while key partners (NHS staff, teachers, employers, local government...) look at them wide eyed for the 'answers'... I know civil servants will be busy working through the best way to bring these forward in a sequenced, manageable way (if possible...), that's a hard task. Prioritising across government, not just within departments, is going to be really important. As someone interested in public services in a broad sense, it feels like we're missing a debate about the threads that run through reform, any principles that need to be carried throughout and of course, devolution... where is all of this going to happen and who is going to lead it? Without this overarching direction there is a risk of a lot of internal debate and confusion well into the autumn.\n\nAhead of the #GeneralElection, we have identified five key priorities that the next UK government should focus on in order to build a healthier UK. The UK has fallen down the international league table for life expectancy and compares poorly on key outcomes such as cancer and heart disease, while deep inequalities in health between our poorest and wealthiest communities are widening. The priority of improving people's health and tackling inequalities calls on bold and coordinated action on population health and the widening health inequalities between our poorest and wealthiest communities. Learn more about this and the other priorities that make up our top five, including our rundown of the key actions the next government should consider in its policymaking üëá https://lnkd.in/emsQzHwz [Alt text: Investing in health as an asset and priority for cross-government action]\n\nüî¨üí∞\"Investing in public health isn't just a cost but an investment in a more productive future.\" This powerful statement came from a recent BMJ article and it highlights the urgent need to revitalise public health in the UK. üîë Key Action Points: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Advocate for the establishment of an independent body to assess government policies' impact on public health. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Push for a cross-government approach to address social determinants of health. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Rally for the restoration of funding to local government and public health.

The priority of investing in health as an asset and priority for cross-government action includes focusing on the wider economic, social and environmental factors that form the building blocks of our health. A new approach is needed that values the role good health plays in the prosperity, resilience and fabric of the nation, places it at the heart of national policy decisions and takes a ‚Äòwhole-government‚Äô approach to coordinating action.

The Liberal Democrats have built their health manifesto commitments on the principle of ‚Äúgetting the basics right‚Äù including a particular focus on primary and community care, as they look to target Conservative heartlands and rural voters. The commitment to invest an additional ¬£9 billion across Health and Social Care by 2028,29 makes for eye catching headlines but should always be viewed against a budget baseline that saw the Government allocate ¬£165 billion towards the NHS for 2024-25. The Lib Dems have also not been afraid to pull from the Labour playbook on the NHS, mirroring commitments to ensuring continuity of GP care (albeit for over 70s) and in placing particular emphasis on addressing health inequalities across Government, through the Cabinet Office.

The #NHS is facing one of the toughest moments in its history, and the challenge to get it back on its feet will be significant. Additionally, improvements in #lifeexpectancy have stalled, #healthinequalities are widening, and #socialcare is in dire need of reform. ‚ÄòBut there are also grounds for optimism. It is possible to rebuild the nation‚Äôs health by taking a long-term approach supported by investment, reform and a relentless focus on the wider #social, #economic and #environmental factors that shape people‚Äôs health. And while the problems facing the NHS are severe, history shows that it can improve with the right level of investment and intelligent reform. Central to effective reform must be more widespread trial and use of technology.‚Äô https://lnkd.in/eJHYAbuY\n\nWhat are the public's health and social care priorities ahead of a general election? New polling by The Health Foundation shows the public thinks that health and wellbeing in the UK are getting worse. üëâ Nearly two-thirds (64%) of the public think the overall level of health and wellbeing in the UK got worse over the past 12 months. üëâ Half (50%) think overall health and wellbeing of the population will get worse over the next 12 months. üëâ Just 16% of the public think the government has the right policies to improve public health, while half (49%) disagree. üëâ A majority of the public see the government as having an important role in addressing the main risks for ill health - such as smoking (80%), alcohol (67%) and gambling (70%). üëâ More than half (55%) of the public support local authorities having greater responsibility to implement policies to reduce harm from tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy food, with only 21% opposed. This polling shows there is a strong appetite among the public for more action to improve public health. A majority of us want to see more action on the commercial determinants of health and see local government as playing an influential role."
