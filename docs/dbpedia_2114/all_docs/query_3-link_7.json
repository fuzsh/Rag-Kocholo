It was syndicated by United Stations Radio Networks and broadcast on a wide variety of affiliate radio stations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Oman, and Europe.[1] The most recent show was being streamed online in a continuous loop by Radionomy, which was also used for the official Nights with Alice Cooper app for iOS and Android. Additionally, it offered \"exclusive content\" as well as interaction with other fans.[2]\n\nDuring the program, Cooper played requests as well as his favorite songs (most of which are from the classic rock genre), answered emails from his fans, and interviewed celebrities. Some of the celebrities he has interviewed on his show include Joe Perry of Aerosmith, Brian Johnson of AC/DC, Ozzy Osbourne, Meat Loaf, Rob Zombie, Glenn Danzig, Def Leppard, Peter Frampton and Jerry Springer. The show also plays rare tracks from classic rock artists, along with blues, early punk rock, and psychedelic music.\n\nIn 2005, The Guardian described the program as \"a distinctive music show... Cooper makes an entertaining host with some unique one-liners\".[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe show debuted on January 26, 2004, on 16 stations, including its flagship station, KDKB in Phoenix, Arizona (later moved to sister station KSLX-FM following its switch to alternative rock).\n\nNights with Alice Cooper features many segments, including \"Tuesday Bluesday\", \"Freaky Facts\", \"Movie Music Madness\", \"Cooper's Covers\", \"Same Name\" (two different songs with the same name), \"Closet Classic\", \"The Quiet Room\", \"Lockdown Rockdown\" (songs for Cooper's jailed listeners), \"Monster Prog\", \"Throwback Thursday\", \"Hey Superstar Clean Out the Garage\", \"The Best Band You've Never Heard In Your Life\" and \"Songs We Just Don't Understand\". Alice also plays his own rare songs and tells the stories behind them in the \"Alice's B.O.\" (Beyond Obscure) and \"Alice's Lost Hits\" segments.\n\nHolidays are big events on Nights with Alice Cooper, especially Halloween. The radio show has offered numerous contests and giveaways, including a flyaway trip to see Cooper in concert; a trip to see Led Zeppelin in London; and in October 2008, the giveaway of a signed ESP guitar. Alice is also a huge trivia buff, and gives away signed pairs of his own pants to listeners who correctly answer his questions, which mostly relate to rare rock or movie trivia.\n\nThe show is also known for Cooper's humorous self-deprecating one-liner outros to commercial breaks: An announcer often tells Cooper's listeners that they are listening to (among many things) \"a man for whom even Dr. Phil has no cure\", \"a man who is not afraid to look like a fool--and demonstrates so regularly\", and, possibly most famously, \"a man with a face made for radio\", and other things mocking and/or questioning Cooper's intelligence, wisdom, talent, career, activities, looks, etc. in such ways.\n\nIn the early days of the show, the program featured several scripted comedy skits which centered around Alice and his life and were written by Kristine \"Kiki\" Valentine Rakowsky who played Alice's counterpart Mistress Kitty on the show. Many of these featured Alice getting into arguments with rock musicians who asked Cooper for money he allegedly owed them for shows. These arguments would ultimately result in Cooper getting beaten senseless by the artists, who would often yell \"and THIS is for making fun of RUSH!\" (which was a common joke of Cooper's at the time.)\n\nNights with Alice Cooper is produced by music journalist and former Rockline producer Katherine Turman.\n\nNights with Alice Cooper ended its syndicated run on September 8, 2023. Radio and Television Business Report stated that Cooper would be continuing in radio in some form after the show's end but the creative disputes with United Stations, which had changed ownership earlier in the year, prompted him to sever ties with the network.[4]\n\nAffiliates\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States\n\n[edit]\n\nKBFX-FM 100.5 FM Anchorage, Alaska\n\nKROR 101.5 FM Hastings, Nebraska\n\nKLPX96.1 FM Tucson, Arizona\n\nWRSW-FM 107.3 FM Warsaw, Indiana\n\nWRKW 99.1 FM Ebensburg, Pennsylvania\n\nKKLN 94.1 FM Willmar, Minnesota\n\nKSLX 100.7 FM Phoenix, Arizona\n\nWDVT 94.5 FM Rutland, Vermont\n\nWLKZ 104.9 FM Wolfeboro, New Hampshire\n\nWCHX 105.5 FM Lewistown, Pennsylvania\n\nWQFX-FM 103.1 FM Jamestown, New York , Russell, Pennsylvania\n\nWYCR 98.5 FM Harrisburg & Lancaster, Pennsylvania\n\nKASR 99.3/105.5, Atkins, Arkansas\n\nKZFX 93.7/107.1 Ridgecrest, California\n\nKZLE 93.3 FM Batesville, Arkansas\n\nKLKK103.7 FM Mason City, Iowa\n\nKVRV 97.7 FMMonte Rio, California\n\nWZUU 92.5 FM Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\nWRKY-FM 104.9 FM Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania\n\nWMPA 93.1 FM Ferrysburg, Michigan\n\nWJJH 96.7 FM Ashland, Wisconsin\n\nKIOO 99.7 FM Porterville, California\n\nKHEI 107.5 FM Kihei, Hawaii\n\nKMGI 102.5 FM Pocatello, Idaho\n\nKKZX 98.9 FM Spokane, Washington\n\nKRVX 103.1 FM Wimbledon, North Dakota\n\nWIMZ 103.5 FM Knoxville, Tennessee\n\nWILZ 104.5 FM Saginaw, Michigan\n\nKCMQ 96.7 FM Columbia, Missouri\n\nWWUZ 96.9 Bowling Green, Virginia (Fredericksburg, Virginia)\n\nWKIT 100.3 FM Bangor, Maine\n\nKIXA-FM 106.5 FM Lucerne Valley, California\n\nWGRF 96.9 FM Buffalo, New York\n\nNWAC 95.7 FM Eunice, New Mexico\n\nKGGO 94.9 FM Des Moines, Iowa\n\nKYSC 96.9 FM Fairbanks, Alaska\n\nWKKN 101.9 FM Westminster, Vermont\n\nWTHK 100.7 FMWilmington, Vermont\n\nKSPQ 93.9 FM West Plains, Missouri\n\nKKZU 101.7 FM Elk City, Oklahoma\n\nWQRI 94.3 FM (and WRQW, Simulcast Station) — Saegertown, Pennsylvania (simulcast station licensed to Cooperstown, Pennsylvania)\n\nKOZZ 105.7 FM Reno, Nevada\n\nWCSX 94.7 FM Detroit, Michigan\n\nKISM 92.9 FM Bellingham, Washington\n\nCanada\n\n[edit]\n\nCFMK-FM 96.3FM Kingston, Ontario\n\nCFRQ-FM 104.3FM Halifax, Nova Scotia\n\nCIXL-FM 91.7FM Welland, Ontario\n\nCKLY-FM 91.9FM Lindsay, Ontario\n\nCKLZ-FM 104.7FM Kelowna, British Columbia\n\nCHOM-FM 97.7FM Montréal, Quebec\n\nCFMI-FM 101.1 Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nPlanet Rock DAB / Sky / Freesat / Virgin Media nationally\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nTriple M Classic Rock\n\n104.1 Territory FM Darwin, Northern Territory[5]\n\nCrow FM 90.7FM Wondai, Queensland[6]\n\nRebel FM (various) Remote New South Wales and Queensland[7]\n\nDenmark\n\n[edit]\n\nMyROCK Nationwide on FM bands\n\nGermany\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio BOB Nationwide DAB+ and in some regions FM\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sound (New Zealand) (various) Nationwide on FM bands\n\nOman\n\n[edit]\n\nSo!
