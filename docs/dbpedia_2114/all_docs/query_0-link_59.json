        "text": "It’s now a cliché to point out that the transfer portal and ongoing free agency eroded the value of high school recruiting.\n\nMissouri has certainly indulged in such shopping to stay old in perpetuity. Yet the Tigers haven’t entirely sworn off the prep market. Bringing in five freshmen this summer, comprising a top-five class, stands as stout evidence.\n\nFramed another way, MU has been stockpiling assets while their value bottomed out. Now, half the current is comprised of underclassmen. If anything, the Tigers are approaching a saturation point for youth.\n\nIt potentially explains why the 2025 cycle went eerily quiet after Aaron Rowe committed last December. While the program has tossed out 60 offers, it’s only hosted five official visits, and only one is locked in for the fall. Right now, the emphasis might be less on volume than on the blend of talent inside Mizzou Arena.\n\nAs Gates winds toward the end of his third complete recruiting cycle, the Tigers have amassed a trove of developmental prospects. Only two of MU’s high-school recruits – Rowe and Annor Boateng – rated higher than 50th in 247Sports’ composite index. The go-around, the staff scaled up its ambitions, focusing on top-tier talents like Jasper Johnson and Jalen Haralson.\n\nMore broadly, the 2025 cycle has progressed at a relative crawl, and lots of programs are seeking clarity. Compounding that is a dead period that lasts until Aug. 20, while the Tigers wrapped up summer workouts last week. But for now, here’s an assessment of where Mizzou stands.\n\nWho are the Names to Know?\n\nBarely a month after his hiring, Gates tossed an offer Randall’s way. In October 2022, the St. Louis native made a two-hour jaunt for an official visit. And this June, the four-star talent returned for the official version. In recruitments like these, MU’s staff is batting 0.500.\n\nShould Randall pull the trigger, his game will make him easy to project once he hits campus. Like other recent recruits, his frame is college-ready, and Randall excels at leveraging it to clean the glass. He can also reliably finish point-blank looks as a rim runner in transition or as a safety valve in the dunker spot.\n\nOn defense, Randall’s length, including a plus-5.5-inch wingspan, complicates life around the rim. Yet he’s agile enough to handle short-stint switches against ballhandlers or stick to the hip of a wing putting the ball on the deck.\n\nHe also comes with a worthwhile upside as a face-up threat. With Bradley Beal Elite, Randall comfortably operated as a connector around the high post and top of the key. That included chances to run dribble handoffs and survey the floor. And as a shooter, he’s comfortable popping jumpers from 15 feet out.\n\nRandall seemed poised to move up recruiting rankings through mid-May, but he slumped over his final 11 games on the EYBL circuit. Those struggles, however, didn’t dent his work rate on the backboards. Over that same stretch, Randall pulled down 32.1 percent of opponents’ misses.\n\nAt worst, Randall would be a suitable replacement when Josh Gray filters off the roster, doing gritty work around the rim and paint. Over time, his familiarity with the principles driving Gates’ offense could lead to an expanded role. And it never hurts for MU to keep the state’s top two prospects from jumping the border.\n\nThe calculus here was always rudimentary: Could MU get the five-star wing on campus?\n\nLast Thursday, we got our answer. The scuttle had been that Haralson was unlikely to leave the Midwest, and in June, he set up visits to Indiana, Notre Dame and Michigan State. Now, the footprint is a bit wider. Haralson, who will hit Columbia on Sept. 21, also added Purdue and Kansas to his itinerary.\n\nGates and assistant coach Kyle Smithpeters have expended a ton of energy to stay in the mix. Now, they’ll get the chance to make the pitch tangible. As for Haralson’s game, it doesn’t take many viewings to get why he’s alluring.\n\nVersatility defines the Indiana native’s game. Suiting up for the Indy Heat, Haralson could flex between four positions. During some possessions, he showcased a deft feel for playing in pick-and-rolls, knowing when to decelerate, make reads and pick the best option. On other trips, his team might empty a side of the floor and let Haralson launch straight-line attacks, absorb contact, and – at worst – earn freebies.\n\nHaralson can also trigger breaks in grab-and-go situations, applying immense pressure on the middle gap or firing hit-ahead passes after a couple of dribbles. Some days, he’s also willing to get grimy by making timely cuts and crashing the offensive glass.\n\nWith a usage rate slightly above 32 percent, it’s not surprising to see healthy out, but Haralson also efficiently stuffed stat sheets, averaging 1.168 points per possession.\n\nIt’s that blend of productivity and malleability that makes Haralson so prized.\n\nThe Nebraskan built his game around arguably the most-coveted commodity in the sport: shooting.\n\nThis spring, Love drained 39.5 percent of his 3-balls on high volume with Mokan Elite, a figure made more impressive by the fact the EYBL uses the NBA arc. Toss in a plus-6-inch wingspan, and the nation’s No. 70 prospect easily cuts the figure of a 3-and-D threat.\n\nSo why does the market for his services seem a bit cool?\n\nThis is where the transfer market exerts a frustrating influence. A 3-point specialist to help space the floor is among the easiest commodities to track down in the portal. Even if an import is transferring from a mid-major, a power-conference staff can strip out inefficient possessions while keeping the spot-up volume steady. Those players also have multiple seasons of college production.\n\nAs for Love, lengthening our time horizon is essential. At La Lumiere School, where he’s teammates with Haralson, Love sank 11 of 39 attempts from deep as a reserve. And in July, he only knocked down 8 of 44 long-distance looks over six outings at the NBA Academy Games. Once you factor in those samples, Love’s connecting at a 31.1 percent clip in 33 outings against top talent.\n\nTo be clear, that’s not awful. Suppose it carried over to his freshman season of college. It would be close to the baseline for similarly rated players at his position — but still lag behind what a transfer could offer.\n\nOther developmental tasks confronting Love aren’t shocking. His pull-up jumper after attacking a close-out could be more reliable. His body needs functional strength to absorb contact when playing downhill. Meanwhile, you’d hope his length might make him more disruptive as an off-ball defender.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering MU isn't without options. Boateng, Marcus Allen, and Trent Pierce remain in the fold, offering the Tigers positional, size, length and athleticism. Again, it could identify and acquire an older floor spacer via transfer.\n\nYet MU’s tracked Love closely. It hosted him for an unofficial visit last March. There’s sufficient groundwork to push for a pledge. For those reasons, you can only draw a line through Love’s name in pencil.\n\nThe Tigers’ board underwent a modest expansion this spring after eight offers were shipped out. Yet none of those prospects are notable at this juncture. Three members of this group have already trimmed their lists, and everyone but Josiah Parker has already lined up multiple official visits for the fall.\n\nStill, the Tigers had made an early habit of entering recruitments later in the cycle and getting some results. Trent Pierce picked up his offer in May 2022, while Trent Burns bloomed late to pick up an offer last June.\n\nThere are likely other names floating around, but for the moment, this is serves as the formal list of options.\n\nWhat’s the State of Play?\n\nIn a word? Sedate.\n\nRowe’s been in the boat for nearly nine months. Randall’s process continues. And only Haralson has set a visit. It starkly contrasts the flurry of activity we saw last year when MU already had three commitments sewn up and was trending toward a pledge from Boateng.\n\nAdmittedly, it is boring. But I don’t think it’s cause for concern.\n\nInventorying the roster shows MU has secured ten commitments from high-school recruits in four cycles. Reeling in Randall might, on balance, be a functional swap for Jordan Butler, who is the lone outbound transfer from that group. Doing so would also keep a streak alive. To date, Gates has not taken a player rated lower than 150th in the composite index.\n\nThe typical prospect recruited under Gates has slotted in around 95th in those ratings. Under Cuonzo Martin, the baseline was closer to No. 193 nationally. So, no compromises are being made in terms of quality.\n\nAgain, it was probably prudent to use this cycle to tweak the mix of talent at Gates’ disposal.\n\nAssuming no defections next spring, MU would still have eight players drawn from the prep ranks, with Rowe also set to arrive. Mark Mitchell also has the option to return for a senior campaign. That’s ten players for what is likely a 12-man rotation. Should player development stay on course, MU might need specialists more than stars – assets easily identifiable in the portal.\n\nUnless, of course, Haralson wants to tote his skill to Columbia.\n\nRosy as that scenario might be, the reality is churn toward the bottom of the roster. Should that transpire, who would the staff want to plug gaps? A freshman or a veteran toting several years of college production? We know the answer.\n\nThe table above shows MU’s staff poured a foundation, tacked up framing, and made the roster watertight. What it’s shopping for now are high-end fittings and finishes.\n\nIt’s also hard to fault that outlook. When I scouted prospects ($) live in May and via live streams ($) last month, only Johnson and Haralson stood out (obviously) as players who could move the needle. Moreover, Rowe has struggled this spring, sliding more than 30 spots in some services’ rankings. And I already noted that Randall and Love encountered turbulence.\n\nIt’s also telling that MU staffers allocated precious time in condensed evaluation periods to look beyond 2025. It was common to see coaches getting eyes on a robust crop of local talent in 2026 and 2027, including Sheek Pearson, Tristan Reed, Ethan Taylor, JJ Andrews, Jalen Montonati, Scottie Adkinson, and Jimmy McKinney III. The staff also jetted west to Las Vegas, where agents use the NBA’s Summer League to set up a networking circuit.\n\nPrograms never entirely abandon acquisition, but what might be of greater emphasis now is for MU to evaluate what it already has on its roster. By next spring, MU might have to prioritize players whose production creates surplus value relative to what they get in NIL. Translation: some guys merit pay raises. And harsh as it sounds, there might have to be some amicable separations. Put even more crassly, roster turnover opens cap space.\n\nWithin that framework, a smaller 2025 class keeps slots — and dollars — freed up for retrofits.\n\nI’m also the same person pounding the drum for assembling and nurturing a core to create continuity. Even in this climate, it’s still the most sustainable approach. It’s also more difficult than ever to achieve, especially since programs can’t exercise strict player control via transfer rules. Now, the pendulum has swung the other way. A rival can poach a player off your roster without returning an asset.\n\nScarcity is also about to hit the transfer market. The bonus year eligibility granted to players who suited up during the pandemic is going away, and there won’t be another crop of super seniors. That figures to drive up asking prices for top-end talent like proven big men, which is why some programs will pivot back to high school talent.\n\nHowever, one-and-done talent are usually the only caliber of player that can make an impact. Even Boateng, who was 33rd in the composite, projects as a role player. In NIL terms, freshmen can be a cost-effective material in roster construction – to a point. Take too many, and you’re allocating spots for upside and player control against experience and proven production.\n\nMoving forward, flexibility might be equal to stability as an objective in managing a roster. Which brings us back to MU’s 2025 class — a smaller group might let Gates thread a tricky needle.\n\nMU can pay to retain reliable production and preserve continuity. Simultaneously, roster churn via graduation, transfers or the draft lets the Tigers reallocate resources to bolster that core. With a budget in hand, the staff can leverage relationships to garner intel about player availability — and salary expectations.\n\nA quality nucleus for your rotation still matters, but it might be one or two spots smaller than in the past, while savvy programs can still optimize roster construction to be adaptable in finding it. We’ll see if MU is among that group."
