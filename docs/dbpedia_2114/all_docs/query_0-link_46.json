        "text": "MUSCATINE, Iowa (KWQC) - The United Way of Muscatine and the city partnered to host an event to clean-up the city’s riverfront on Tuesday.\n\nHilary Henke, community engagement manger with United Way of Muscatine, said a city employee contacted her asking for help finding volunteers to help clean up the riverfront after flooding.\n\n“We work very closely with the city a lot of times for things like RAGBRAI or Day of Caring that we do, we have projects with the city, and so we have that strong partnership already.” Henke said.\n\nThe volunteers, she said, cleaned silt from the river, mud from the Mississippi Mist Fountain in Riverside Park and old mulch and debris from around the landscaping beds. The volunteers, she said, also put down new mulch in the landscaping beds and around the trees.\n\n“Picking up just the mud and muck and everything that the flood brought to us,” Henke said. “So, making it a beautiful riverfront again, so we can all enjoy it.”\n\nHenke said she thinks volunteering for your community is important because it builds a sense of camaraderie and community pride.\n\n“We can always count on our citizens to step up and help out to make our community a great place.” Henke said.\n\nThe clean-up, she said, has been amazing with 65 volunteers showing up from various organizations and different age groups.\n\n“It’s building a lot of sense of community, and you’re getting to know your neighbors and people maybe you haven’t met before.” Henke said.\n\nJohnny Armijl, a volunteer with Calvary Church, said he and the other volunteers from his church wanted to help because of their church’s values.\n\n“Our church is all about loving people, and we wanna love our community,” Amrijl said. “Wanna make sure we do that by living by example.”\n\nAmrijl said volunteering at the clean-up has been fun because of the cooler weather and other volunteers.\n\n“We have a blast just laughing and talking and meeting new people too, right.” Amrijl.\n\nThe event was scheduled to end at 3 p.m. Henke said volunteers will be on the riverfront until the work is done.\n\n“We’re working pretty quickly, so I wouldn’t be surprised if we’re done earlier than that.” Henke said."
