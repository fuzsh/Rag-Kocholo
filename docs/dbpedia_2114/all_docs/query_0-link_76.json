        "text": "North Carolina’s Best Grilled Cheese Sandwich Found At A Gas Station?\n\nThere are certain rules of thumb in my life that I live by. If you can’t appreciate the deliciousness of a grilled cheese sandwich with either tomato soup or chili, we have nothing to build upon in a relationship, either. So, for my friends, I’ve got to tell you about a duck confit grilled cheese sandwich that’s available at The Pure & Proper, a former gas station?\n\nThe Pure & Proper Is A Gas Station?\n\nI know, right? When was the last time someone steered you in a culinary direction to a gas station? Okay, so The Pure & Proper is not STILL a gas station. However, in the 1940s, this Black Mountain, North Carolina landmark opened as a Pure Oil Station. All that remains of those memories is the building. More than 80 years later, it’s been transformed into an elite eatery.\n\nSo What Kind Of Eatery Is The Pure & Proper?\n\nAccording to their website, The Pure & Proper is your cozy downtown eatery where you can find something delicious at any time of the day — from morning espresso and street waffles, to a light lunch sitting street side on the patio, or a late dinner date sipping craft cocktails with friends — whatever the occasion we look forward to seeing you here. Okay, so let’s get down to it. What about this grilled cheese that is regarded as one of the best you’ll find anywhere in North Carolina?\n\nExplain A Duck Confit Grilled Cheese At The Pure & Proper\n\nAdmittedly, I had to ask my chef wife about this. Basically, it’s a grilled cheese incorporated with duck and grilled in remnants of duck fat.\n\nIn the case of the Pure & Proper’s version, it’s made of pulled duck leg confit (duck legs slow-roasted in duck fat), griddled onion, arugula, Gruyere cheese, and tomato jam. OMG…YUM!!! This is worth a trip for sure!\n\nCharlie Nance is the Afternoon Drive co-host (along with his wife) of \"The Charlie and Debbie Show\" at WSOC, Country 1037 in Charlotte, North Carolina. The couple have been with the radio station since 2006. Charlie has won the prestigious CMA (Country Music Association) Award for Radio Personality of the Year and has been a finalist for the Country Radio Hall of Fame four times. Prior to his time in Charlotte, Charlie (along with Debbie) spent more than a decade hosting successful morning radio shows in Greenville, SC; Augusta, Ga; and Birmingham, Al. As a content creator for Country 1037, Charlie writes about dream lottery windfalls, sports, restaurants and bars, and travel experiences in North and South Carolina.\n\nSign me up for the K104.7 email newsletter!\n\nYour favorite station is giving you exclusive access to some great content.
