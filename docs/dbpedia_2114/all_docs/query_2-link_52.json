        "meta_description": "The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) localized to a globular cluster in M81 challenges our understanding of FRB models. In this Letter, we explore dynamical formation scenarios for objects in old globular clusters that may plausibly power FRBs. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that young neutron stars may form in globular clusters at a rate of up to $\\sim50\\,\\rm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,\\rm{yr}^{-1}$ through a combination of binary white dwarf mergers, white dwarf--neutron star mergers, binary neutron star mergers, and accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs in binary systems. We consider two FRB emission mechanisms: First, we show that a magnetically-powered source (e.g., a magnetar with field strength $\\gtrsim10^{14}\\,$G) is viable for radio emission efficiencies $\\gtrsim10^{-4}$. This would require magnetic activity lifetimes longer than the associated spin-down timescales and longer than empirically-constrained lifetimes of Galactic magnetars. Alternatively, if these dynamical formation channels produce young rotation-powered neutron stars with spin periods of $\\sim10\\,$ms and magnetic fields of $\\sim10^{11}\\,$G (corresponding to spin-down lifetimes of $\\gtrsim10^5\\,$yr), the inferred event rate and energetics can be reasonably reproduced for order unity duty cycles. Additionally, we show that recycled millisecond pulsars or low-mass X-ray binaries similar to those well-observed in Galactic globular clusters may also be plausible channels, but only if their duty cycle for producing bursts similar to the M81 FRB is small.",
