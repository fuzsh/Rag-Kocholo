        "text": "In his hit song “Radio Radio,” Elvis Costello summed up the fundamental failing of commercial radio.\n\n“They say you better listen to the voice of reason ,” he sings. “But they don’t give you any choice, ’cause they think that it’s treason’.” More than 20 years later, those lyrics may ring clearer than ever.\n\nWith corporate empires like Clear Channel buying out hundreds of stations across the country and stocking them with identical playlists, the range of options for radio listeners is at an all-time low. In these times, with so few independent stations still in existence, the responsibility has fallen almost solely on college radio to put new and diverse music on the airwaves. The question is, just how diverse does a diverse play list have to be?\n\nBowling Green boasts two student-run campus radio stations, WBGU (88.1 FM) and WFAL (1610 AM). Both stations have substantial music libraries and employ an array of disc jockeys with creative input. On WFAL, you are likely to hear the latest in hard rock and indie music, while WBGU has programs ranging from jazz and folk to electronic and punk. One genre you will rarely hear on either station, however, is the category typically referred to as “urban,” which includes rap, hip-hop and rhythm and blues.\n\nWatching MTV or glancing at the albums in the weekly BG Billboard, it’s impossible not to recognize the enormous popularity of so-called “urban” music among college-age listeners. What was once an underground style has become a considerable part of the mainstream music culture.\n\nWith so many students clamoring for hip-hop and R’B artists, the relative lack of such programming on campus radio could be seen as a failure to carry out college radio’s responsibility to diversity. However, before organizing any protests, students would be wise to consider the logical background behind both WBGU and WFAL’s programming arrangements.\n\nBesides having a general format, WFAL has nothing in common with the hypocritical stations of Costello’s song.\n\n“Urban music was not and is not deliberately cut out of the format at WFAL,” said Kelly Fink, general manager at the station. “We have simply always been a modern rock/loud rock formatted station, which means our play list has to stay somewhere within that broad category.”\n\nJust because it has a rock format, however, does not mean that WFAL is not upholding its duty to play unique music. “We pride ourselves on playing rock that’s often under the mainstream radar,” Fink said. “Having an obligation to diverse programming can help open the eyes of college kids and community members alike and hopefully pull them out of the rut of commercial radio.”\n\nWhile WFAL’s main focus is introducing listeners to diversity within rock ‘n’ roll, Fink did mention that her station’s repertoire does broaden at times.\n\n“WFAL does not have a set format on the weekends,” she said. “So if other styles of music were interested in having a show on our station, that could happen.”\n\nAs primarily a formatted station, WFAL lacks “urban” programs for the same reasons it lacks country or salsa programs; it is simply not within the station’s main format. However, the situation at WBGU is slightly different. Unlike WFAL, WBGU does not follow a distinct format, leaving the station free to place a wide variety of musical genres in their program schedule. Despite this fact, WBGU currently features only one showcase solely for “urban” music, a two hour program that airs each Wednesday morning. According to WBGU Co-Music Director Jeremy Rober, however, that scheduling weakness is more the result of circumstances, rather than biases.\n\n“It wasn’t really a choice that it turned out this way,” he said. “We allow our DJs to play whatever they want, within reason, and not as many of them chose to play ‘urban’ this semester.”\n\nWBGU General Manager Jonathan Meinhold reiterated that point. “It’s not a choice to focus on punk and indie with less on ‘urban’ music,” he said. “It’s more a function of the people involved with the station. WBGU had a powerful, vibrant ‘urban’ department, but due to circumstances beyond our control, our number of ‘urban’ DJs has dwindled.”\n\nMeinhold regretfully explained that many of the station’s top hip-hop and R’B disc jockeys had graduated, resigned or were simply too busy to continue their radio shows this semester. That fact, combined with much of “urban” music’s place in the mainstream (rather than the underground status preferred by the station) has had a damaging effect on WBGU’s ‘urban’ department.\n\nOn a positive note, Meinhold added, “We do have several new DJs coming into the station who are interested in playing ‘urban’ music, as well as a few veteran DJs interested in returning to our department.”\n\nIn fairness, “urban” music is not the lone genre suffering from unavoidable scheduling imbalances. Country music, a form with an enormous fan base, is played on WBGU only on weekend mornings, while Latin and folk music have only one weekly block each.\n\nIn Meinhold’s opinion, radio can still be a sound salvation, so long as it’s college radio.\n\n“In a time where the airwaves are clogged with mind-numbing drivel created to pander to an audience that’s too passive to realize how the music industry is condescending to them, college radio has never been more important,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, for those wishing to hear nothing but mainstream hits, you can always turn your dial in either direction."
