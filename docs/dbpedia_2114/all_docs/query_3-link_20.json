These power users devote significant hours of their lives to one medium or another and are the most likely to consistently engage with content and advertising found on those channels. Nielsen released the Audio report profiling the listening habits of the 243 million Americans who use radio each week. The report also included a profile of the heaviest users across four media sectors. And an interesting headline emerged: heavy radio listeners and heavy TV viewers are, for the most part, mutually exclusive. Heavy TV viewers watch nearly double the amount of TV each week as heavy radio listeners, and conversely, heavy radio listeners listen to nearly double the amount of radio each week as heavy TV viewers. Based on habits alone, it is highly unlikely that a heavy radio listener would also be a heavy TV viewer because the heavy radio listener is much more likely to be away from home more often—where TV viewing is less likely to occur. This is a major reason why the findings of other Nielsen studies which have shown that radio does an exceptional job of increasing TV tune-in, particularly in the days and hours leading up to a premier or other primetime event. Heavy radio listeners spend nearly nine hours a week online, second only to the heavy Internet group at over 16 hours weekly. And both of these groups are very likely to use social media to stay connected; nearly all (92%) heavy Internet users also use social media, and three-quarters of heavy radio listeners do, too.

The outlet learned in a recent FBI document dump that Kasem, who cemented his Hollywood star as the inventor of the American Top 40, was secretly ducking death threats from a few fanatics—and at least one lover of an art-rock band, too. Long before he was struck with Lewy disease, people came at Casey Kasem with 'crank phone calls and fatal attraction letters. '\n\nDuring the summer of 1980, a woman made a visit to the Watermark Studio in Los Angeles. There, she tried to kiss Kasem during a photo shoot. “During the picture session she attempted to kiss him but he backed away from her,” the FBI documents say. Kasem ordered his staff to make sure sure she was swiftly sent off in a cab back to the airport after the show’s taping. The fan thought the Kasem was in love with her. But when the divorced Kasem married Jean Thompson, she started writing letters on Christmas Eve in 1980 accusing Kasem of rape, alcoholism, and molesting his kids. “By the end of June or else—I’ll come out to California and kill you, your ‘wife’ and your three kids—this is a promise. I’ll do it too because I know where you work,” she wrote in one letter, found in the FBI trove. She added, “a bullet through your heart will be first and then I’ll pour kerosene on your dead body and torch you until its charred.” There were many other incidents that followed.
