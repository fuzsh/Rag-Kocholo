        "text": "In a new interview with Niclas Müller-Hansen of RockSverige, SLAYER drummer Paul Bostaph was asked if he was as surprised as Kerry King apparently was about the announcement of three SLAYER reunions shows for later this summer and early fall. He responded: \"Yeah. I mean, Kerry knew it before I did, but yeah. I got the phone call and I never saw that coming. Really, when it was done in 2019, I went, 'That's all. That's it.' I'm not going to sit there and go, 'I hope it happens again.; I'm, like, 'It's done. Time to move on.' It was a fun ride while I was there and a great band, but then, all of a sudden, I get that phone call and I was, like, 'Huh?'\"\n\nHe continued: \"It'll be great. It will be great to jam with Tom [Araya, SLAYER bassist/vocalist] and Gary [Holt, SLAYER guitarist] and Kerry, which I'm doing anyway [in Kerry's solo band], but just playing SLAYER songs. It's SLAYER, so what's not to really like about it, unless you don't like SLAYER. [Laughs] But yeah, I was surprised about it.\"\n\nAsked if there was one song that he struggled with more than others when he first started playing with SLAYER, Paul said: \"A lot of them. I'm not going to say that I sat down and started playing, like, 'Oh, I know how to play this stuff.' Literally, I had to dissect Dave's [Lombardo, original SLAYER drummer] playing, because for me to even… When I got the call for the audition, and if I come in and can't play the songs the way they should sound, I'm not going to get the gig. It doesn't matter how good of a drummer you are. You've got to give the band what they want, and I'm all about that. It took me a long time and I dedicated a lot of time to it. I had ten days and over those ten days I walked around with headphones on and it was all I listened to. I had like a Sony Walkman with a cassette in it and for each song I had to learn I had the live version taped twice and I had the studio version taped twice and it was all I listened to all day long and I would rewind and fast forward and rewind and fast forward. Some of them were easier because the structure of the song was easier, but it was no fooling around. Dave's drum fills are no bullshit. That's his style and I was doing my own thing and I never tried to… I've played cover tunes with people for fun, but never, like, 'Okay, you're going to get this opportunity to play with this band with one of the most iconic drummers in heavy metal and by the way, you probably should play his drum fills like he does…' I play them the way I play them as close to the way he plays them as possible, but there's only one of him. There's only one Dave Lombardo and there's only one of me and there's only one of everyone else, which is a good thing.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Man, if I had to say which one was the hardest one — oh, man. That's a really good question, because there were so many of them that took me some effort to get right. 'Silent Scream' was not an easy one. That was a great one. I wanted to play that one, but they didn't even bring it up. One day I went, 'Can we play 'Silent Scream'?' and they went, 'Wow, we haven't thought about that one.' That was one because there's fast double bass. I was influenced by that song for the FORBIDDEN song 'Infinite'. I heard Dave do double bass and I was, 'I want to do a song like that.'\"\n\nLast month, King told Metal Injection about the fact that SLAYER's upcoming reunion shows were announced just weeks after he told Rolling Stone magazine that a SLAYER comeback was unlikely. He said: \"I turned [SLAYER reunion offers] down for the longest time. You can imagine we've been turning down offers since December 1st, 2019. And at that point, I thought, 'No, we're never gonna play again.' Tom retired. So it's written. And then offers keep coming, offers keep coming, the money goes up. And this one came around and it was when we were booking shows from my [solo] band, and I go to my manager. I'm, like, 'Are we talking about my band or SLAYER? What are we talking about here?' He's, like, 'SLAYER.' And I'm, like, 'Yeah, but that's done. We hung that shit up. I dropped the chains. Done.' But then it started getting to where this is really gonna be the five-year anniversary of [SLAYER's] last tour. And I went, 'That's kind of cool. Three shows, five-year anniversary. Okay.' That's about all I thought about it.\"\n\nKing continued: \"The funny thing about this story is I didn't tell anybody in my [solo] band [that the SLAYER reunion shows were happening]. I'd never been in that situation. And the news dropped that we were doing three shows and everybody blows me up. I'm, like, 'Goddamn it.' 'It never occurred to me to tell you guys.' Never fucking occurred to me. It wasn't a secret. They can keep secrets. I know that. And I felt so bad. It never occurred to me. Paul knew, of course. But poor Phil [Demmel, guitarist in Kerry's solo band] and Kyle [Sanders, bassist in Kerry's solo band] and Mark [Osegueda, vocalist in Kerry's solo band], they all texted me and blew me up. I'm, like, 'I'm so sorry, man. It never occurred to me. This is what's up. This is what's gonna happen. If it happens again, it's gonna be the same thing. We're never gonna fucking make a record. We're never gonna fucking tour. This is my band.'\"\n\nKerry went on to say that he doesn't rule out more SLAYER shows in the future beyond the three festival appearances this summer and fall. \"I'm trying to be real and definitely say, hey, we're not gonna tour again,\" he explained. \"And we're certainly not gonna record again, 'cause I have a means of doing that now with my band. [We're doing] three shows for now. And I say 'for now' because I know Europe's gonna come knocking, 'Hey, man, you guys played America. Come see us.' So it wouldn't surprise me if something like that happened, but it's certainly not on my books right now.\"\n\nEarlier last month, Kerry told Guitar World magazine that he \"was very surprised\" when Araya agreed to play three SLAYER shows this year. \"I made my comments [about SLAYER being finished] based on [Tom] not wanting to play anymore. As far as I was concerned, we were done and never going to play again. To be honest, I don't know what switched.\n\n\"We've been turning down offers to play shows for at least three years. So, one came up that, I guess, enticed Tom to the point where he wanted to roll the dice and try a couple. I don't know, but that's all it is.\"\n\nKerry added that he would be open to more SLAYER gigs in the future.\n\n\"There could be an instance where there's another one-off,” he said. \"It just has to be the right offer at the right time, maybe someplace everybody loves to go. But touring, no, I don't see touring. But, you know, who's to say a one-off can't happen again?\"\n\nKing, who is currently touring with his solo band, previously told Total Guitar magazine about SLAYER's reunion shows: \"It caught me off guard too. Do I wish the timing was different? Absolutely, but that's completely out of my hands.\"\n\nKing went on to say that fans shouldn't get their hopes up about a full-scale SLAYER reunion.\n\n\"Everyone thinks SLAYER are getting back together, but that couldn't be further from the truth,\" he explained. \"We've been turning down gigs ever since we stopped. This one came and I thought, 'If we're ever going to do one, this could be cool because it's the five-year anniversary of our final tour.'\n\n\"We're not going to record anymore,\" he added. \"That final tour was definitely our final tour. This is just a reason to have some fun the guys, play a few shows and then jump back in the coffin…\"\n\nIn June, King was asked by Jonathan Clarke, host of \"Out Of The Box\" on Q104.3, New York's classic rock station, about how SLAYER's upcoming reunion shows came about, five years since the completion of what was being billed as the band's farewell tour. He responded: \"I'll put it in the perspective everybody can understand. We've been turning down offers since beginning of 2020, pandemic and all. And then it started getting near the five-year anniversary of us stopping playing, so I'm, like, 'You know what? This is a three-show package. I think it would be fun to do.' It's kind of a five-year anniversary of our last tour. We're never gonna tour again — it ain't gonna happen. We're never gonna record again; that's not gonna happen either. But to do commemorative shows, I think that's kind of fun. I don't have to be married to it for a long time. Kids don't have to worry about it coming around on tour because we said we wouldn't. There's not a whole lot of weird diabolical shit going on here. I think people have just gotta say, 'Hey, it's anniversary celebration shows.' That's gonna be the end of it.\"\n\nKerry also discussed the SLAYER comeback in May in an interview with Andrew Daly of ClassicRockHistory.com. Asked for about his outlook on the reunion shows, he said: \"It's not really much different at all. It's the same heads, same cabs, same pedals, same guitars. You know, there will be a lot of fire when SLAYER plays, and I think, yeah, those shows will just be fun. It'll be fun to play with Gary Holt for a few gigs; I haven't seen him in almost five years, so that will be cool. And it'll be cool to get together with Tom Araya and spit some hate out at people, but don't get used to this being a yearly event.\"\n\nEarlier in May, King was asked by SiriusXM's \"Trunk Nation With Eddie Trunk\" if he thinks SLAYER's upcoming dates will have a positive or negative impact on the promotional efforts \"From Hell I Rise\", which arrived on May 17 via Reigning Phoenix Music. He responded: \"I see it both ways. We've [SLAYER] been turning down [reunion] offers for the last four years. Unfortunately, when the right offer came around, this one, it was right as my project was releasing. So there's certainly people, like my management and booking agents, who say, 'Oh, that's great. It's gonna boost your solo thing.' And I'm, like, 'Well, I don't know the business side of it, but it is what it is.' And every time I talk about it to journalists and magazines and stuff, I say, 'Listen, SLAYER is not gonna make another record. SLAYER is never gonna tour again.' May SLAYER do a one-off here or there? Maybe. I told my [solo] band when [the SLAYER reunion shows] came up, I'm, like, 'Listen, this is a blip on the radar to me. This isn't a solo project that's gonna recycle musicians every record cycle. You guys are with me till you don't wanna be.'\"\n\nAsked if he envisions SLAYER as the type of thing where the band will do one or two shows a year when a great opportunity comes up, Kerry said: \"I'm not even talking yearly. I'm, like, every two years, every three years, every five years. I don't know. 'Cause I'm gonna be super busy with [my solo band] once 2025 rolls around.\"\n\nOn the topic of whether he has spoken to Araya since SLAYER's reunion shows were announced, Kerry said: \"I'll tell you the truth, 'cause you know that's how I roll. No, we haven't. But you know what's weird about that? It's not weird. [Laughs]\"\n\nHe continued: \"We'll go probably rehearse off and on for a couple weeks [before the first show], 'cause even though me and [SLAYER drummer] Paul [Bostaph, who is also in Kerry's solo band] will be sharp from playing, playing with different people, you've gotta get sharp together.\"\n\nElaborating on his belief that SLAYER's comeback shows will not lead into a full-fledged reunion for the legendary thrash metal act, Kerry said: \"The way I look at it, and when I tell you this, it puts it into perspective for a lot of people, I see it as three five-year anniversary shows of our last tour.\"\n\nFive years after SLAYER played the last concert of what was being billed as the band's farewell tour and just weeks after the SLAYER guitarist unveiled the details of his solo project, Kerry and his longtime bandmates announced that they will play at the Aftershock, Riot Fest and Louder Than Life festivals in September and October.\n\nKing also talked about the SLAYER reunion while speaking to Revolver magazine about \"From Hell I Rise\". Asked if he had known about these shows well before they were officially announced, King said: \"If you ask promoters, they're going to have another answer. If you ask booking agents, they'll probably have a third answer. But to me, it kind of came out of nowhere. Have we been getting offers the past few years? Yeah, we turn down offers every year, probably every month of every year. These three festivals are right around the five-year anniversary of our last tour, which I thought was kind of cool. So, I thought this might be the right time to test the water. It will be great to play for the fans again.\"\n\nRegarding whether the upcoming SLAYER shows will steal some of the thunder away from the touring his solo band will do in support of \"From Hell I Rise\", Kerry said: \"Well, time will tell, and my answer would be, 'hopefully not'. The funny thing is, it never occurred to me until the day the SLAYER announcement came, but Demmel said, 'Dude, is this real?' And I'm, like, 'It's just a few weekends and that's it.' Of course, Paul knew. But I didn't tell Phil, I didn't tell Kyle and didn't tell Mark — and I said to the guys, 'There's no master plan here.' I didn't want anybody to start getting cold feet. I said, 'This is a little moment in time, and yeah, KERRY KING is going to be touring, you know, hopefully later in the year, as well. But SLAYER is an entity and I'm just a person.' But hopefully, we drive on with the solo project.\"\n\nKing also spoke about the SLAYER reunion in an interview with U.K.'s Metal Hammer magazine. Admitting that the announcement of SLAYER's comeback \"was not my favorite timing\", Kerry said that the SLAYER reunion \"is not going to translate into recording and it's not going to translate into touring. For me, it's three shows marking five years since our final shows, a fun, 'Hey, remember us from before the pandemic?' celebration.\"\n\nKerry also explained in more detail why he still has not spoken to Tom since the news of SLAYER's reunion was announced. \"It's not like I'm angry with him or anything,\" King clarified. \"We're very different people, and we evolved into business partners at the end of the day. He has very different interests from me, and very different outlooks. Does that make me hate him? No. But I don't need to talk to him every day… We just don't have much in common. When it comes time to rehearse, I'll have no problem showing up. We're professionals, and that's what we do.\"\n\nWhen Kerry's solo project was first announced, King told Rolling Stone that he was almost positive he and Tom would never resurrect the band. \"I can pretty much a hundred percent say no because I have a new outlet, and it's not SLAYER, but it sounds like SLAYER,\" King said of a potential SLAYER reunion.\n\nThe lineup for SLAYER's comeback will be the same as the one which last toured in 2019: Araya and King, along with Holt (also of EXODUS) and Bostaph.\n\nDays after SLAYER's reunion was announced, Tom Araya's wife wrote on social media that she \"harassed him for over a year\" before he \"agreed finally\" to play more shows with the band. \"We shared that news with SLAYER's awesome managers and they did the rest!\" she explained. \"So yes without Tom it wouldn't have happened.. without me BUGGING HIM it wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nBoth Gary and his wife Lisa Holt were among the hundreds of people who \"liked\" Sandra's Instagram post, with Lisa sharing three heart emojis in response to Sandra's message.\n\nIn a statement confirming SLAYER's return, Tom said: \"Nothing compares to the 90 minutes when we're on stage playing live, sharing that intense energy with our fans, and to be honest, we have missed that.\" King added: \"Have I missed playing live? Absolutely. SLAYER means a lot to our fans; they mean a lot to us. It will be five years since we have seen them.\"\n\nThe same day that SLAYER's comeback was announced, Holt's wife Lisa Holt took to her social media to write: \"Yes, it's true..and an exciting adventure for the band and fans !\n\n\"To all the people saying 'they are liars' 'they must have ran out of money' 'its not SLAYER without so and so' ..I have an idea for you all...DON'T GO.. and for all the people who did go to the final tour dates and enjoyed it...awesome!!\n\n\"This isn't a 'TOUR' it's some dates..and GREAT NEWS!!!\" she added. \"And everyone that thinks they know all the inside info..you can't possibly know. so just enjoy the fact that this amazing band will play some amazing shows this year...go or don't..nobody cares!!!!!\"\n\nThree weeks before SLAYER's reunion was announced, Kerry told Rolling Stone that he didn't foresee SLAYER coming back together for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Will SLAYER tour again? I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen. Could SLAYER play a show again? I'm sure there's a scenario,\" King said, adding that he hadn't spoken to Araya since that final show. \"Am I looking for it? No, I'm just getting ready to start my [solo] career. So if that happens, it happens. But I'm going to be doing this for the next 10 years at least.\"\n\nSLAYER played the final show of its farewell tour in November 2019 at the Forum in Los Angeles. One day later, Kerry's wife Ayesha said that there is \"not a chance in hell\" that the thrash metal icons will reunite for more live appearances.\n\nSLAYER's final world tour began on May 10, 2018 with the band's intention to play as many places as possible, to make it easy for the fans to see one last SLAYER show and say goodbye. By the time the 18-month trek wrapped at the Forum, the band had completed seven tour legs plus a series of one-off major summer festivals, performing more than 140 shows in 30 countries and 40 U.S. states."
