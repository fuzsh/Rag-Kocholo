        "text": "Kyle Martin was born into a radio family. His father, Charley Martin, began at KSO radio in Des Moines in the early 60’s before moving to Denver Colorado at KHOW radio.\n\nIn 1985 Kyle enrolled in Drake University’s school of Journalism and Mass Communication. While at Drake he began working at KIOA 940 radio in Des Moines. Taking a full load of classes and working overnights at KIOA was quite a challenge.\n\nHe graduated from Drake in 1989.

In 1997, an oldies/classic rock format called Kyle back to Ames at a brand new station called KLRX(Clear 96.1). In 2002, he had an opportunity to return to an oldies format at KBIZ in Ottumwa. Eventually KBIZ switched to a news/talk format. News Talk was a new challenge for Kyle, he actually had to use his journalism degree.\n\nIn 2017, Kyle was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a disc jockey.\n\nSince 2004, Kyle has hosted the morning show at KFJB. Kyle is married to Amy and has 3 daughters, Peyton, Abby and Grace.
