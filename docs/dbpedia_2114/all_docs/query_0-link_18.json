        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nFor radio listeners in Seattle, the end of 2003 brought the Invasion of the Aging Hipster Bands.\n\nOn Dec. 18 at noon, the modern rock station KNDD-FM ''the End'' announced on the air that it was returning to its roots. Dumped immediately were rap rock and modern metal bands like Limp Bizkit and Puddle of Mudd. They were replaced by familiar voices from the alternative rock explosion of the early 1990's: Nirvana, R.E.M., Weezer and Beck, as well as predecessors like the Clash and Sex Pistols.\n\nThe next day, Seattle's KYPT-FM ''the Point'' bid farewell to Prince, Madonna and the other pop and rock acts on its 1980's playlist, switching to a similar ''classic alternative'' format. The station also adopted the fresh call letters KRQI and the new nickname ''K Rock.''\n\nOn the same day, a similar change was occurring at Atlanta's WNNX-FM ''99X.'' Just over a year ago, San Diego's KBZT-FM ''FM 94-9'' made the same move.\n\nWhile the number of stations embracing the ''classic alternative'' format is small so far, industry executives expect a significant jump in the coming years. Both the End and 99X are considered bellwether outlets. ''For them to shift in this direction is like the shot heard 'round the world,'' said Max Tolkoff, a columnist for the trade publications Radio & Records.\n\nLike the classic rock format that started in the mid-1980's to cater to aging baby boomers, classic alternative -- with new songs from retro-alternative bands like the White Stripes and the Strokes thrown into the mix on some stations -- appeals to Generation X'ers who are beginning to show some gray.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
