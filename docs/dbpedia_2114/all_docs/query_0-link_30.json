        "text": "With SCA pulling the pin on the DAB+ format just a few short weeks ago, 1116 SEN has launched their brand new sister-station, Classic Rock Radio.\n\nGeneral Manager of 1116 SEN, Cathy Thomas, said the launch of Classic Rock Radio rounds out the circle of what their listeners want.\n\n“Fans of 1116 SEN already get 24/7 sport coverage and we are thrilled to be able to offer them a music alternative for those times when the situation calls for some classic rock hits,” said Thomas.\n\n“To ensure listeners get their maximum rock fix, there will be minimal interruptions throughout the day and the focus will be playing quality music that people have loved through the years and still enjoy today.”\n\n“From a business point of view, it made sense to give our target audience a comprehensive listening experience across two stations and we now own the territory that encompasses everything Aussie blokes love – sport and rock music.”\n\nGunning for 40 plus Males, Classic Rock Radio will replace 3MP on the AM band as well; playing 60’s, 70’s and 80’s rock with minimal talk and less ads. For SEN they say it’s all about the music, with traffic and news headlines in Breakfast and Drive.\n\nClassic Rock Radio is now the only dedicated classic rock station now playing on DAB+, streaming online, apps and on 1377AM."
