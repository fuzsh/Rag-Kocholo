        "text": "Boston heavy rock unit CORTEZ announces new album “Thieves and Charlatans” on Ripple Music; watch “Gimme Danger (On My Radio) video!\n\nBoston-based heavy metallers Cortez return with their fourth album “Thieves and Charlatans” on Ripple Music this October 18th, and unleash their new video and single “Gimme Danger (On My Radio)” today!\n\nThe follow-up to 2020’s “Sell the Future”, CORTEZ‘s new album “Thieves and Charlatans” demonstrates their ability to command a sound that is both classic-rooted and modern in its construction. Working in continued collaboration with producer Benny Grotto at Mad Oak Studio, and with the returning lineup of vocalist Matt Harrington, guitarists Scott O’Dowd and Alasdair Swan, bassist Jay Furlo and drummer Alexei Rodriguez (although he has since been replaced by Kyle Rasmussen).\n\nThe album features guest vocalists Craig Riggs (Kind, Roadsaw, Sasquatch, etc.) and Jim Healey (We’re All Gonna Die, Black Thai, Blood Lightning, etc.) and sees CORTEZ look forward as ever while regarding their past in a new way.\n\nWatch new video “Gimme Danger (On My Radio)” HERE\n\n+ listen to the single on all streaming services\n\n“We were a bit selfish while writing and recording this album,” says guitarist Scott O’Dowd. “There’s probably one of our catchiest songs in ‘Gimme Danger (On My Stereo),’ and yet some of our longer, gloomier songs as well. There are also more complex guitar and vocal arrangements than in the past.“\n\n“This album is an anomaly of sorts because these songs were written and recorded in a vacuum, during a pandemic,” reminds vocalist Matt Harrington. “Cortez has never been shy about playing new songs before they are released, and this is the first time we didn’t have the filter of an audience. I feel like this is a more personal record as a result. We wrote these songs as friends in a room that no longer exists, holding onto something real in a prolonged period of extreme doubt, and we present them in the same way.“\n\nWith unmatched consistency of craft and performance, Cortez’s willful progression continues through “Thieves and Charlatans”, a record born boldly of tumult that speaks to past as much as future that’s just waiting for you to take it on. (Words by JJ Koczan)\n\nCORTEZ “Thieves and Charlatans”\n\nOut October 18th on Ripple Music (LP/CD/digital)\n\nBoston loves an underdog, and as double-guitar heavy rock five-piece Cortez pass 15 years since the release of their 2007 debut EP, Thunder in a Forgotten Town, they remain persistently underrated. Cortez are among the safest bets you can make in heavy rock and roll. Across three full-lengths to-date – 2020’s Sell the Future, 2017’s The Depths Below, 2012’s Cortez – the band has solidified a songwriting process and a straight-ahead, don’t-need-nuthin’-fancy-when-you-can-rock-like-this attitude that is second to none, in their home city or out of it.\n\nCORTEZ line-up\n\nMatt Harrington – Vocals\n\nScott O’Dowd – Guitar\n\nAlasdair Swan – Guitar\n\nJay Furlo – Bass\n\nKyle Rasmussen – Drums*\n\n*all drums on the album performed by Alexei Rodriguez\n\nCORTEZ links\n\nWebsite – Facebook – Bandcamp – Instagram – Spotify"
