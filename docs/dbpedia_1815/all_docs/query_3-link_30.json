        "text": "Awami League’s Moslem Uddin Ahmed won the by-election to the Chattogram-8 constituency on Monday amid widespread rigging and intimidation.\n\nBangladesh Nationalist Party candidate Abu Sufian quit the race halfway in protest against the capture of polling centres by ruling party activists, expulsion of BNP agents from centres and ballot stuffing. Sufian demanded re-election.\n\nLess than 23 per cent of the voters turned up to cast their votes and more than 80 per cent of the votes cast were in favour of the AL candidate. The BNP candidate obtained about 16 per cent of the ballots cast while the rest four candidates got less than four per cent.\n\nThe constituency comprising Boalkhali and Chandgaon fell vacant after its lawmaker Moin Uddin Khan Badal, executive president of the Bangladesh Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, died on November 7, 2019.\n\nThe by-election voting began at the 170 designated centres across the port city and in the Boalkhali upazila at 9:00am.\n\nElectronic voting machines were used in the election. The voter turnout was relatively low in the morning amid the biting cold and heavy fog.\n\n‘A total of 1,08,581 voters, out of 4,74,485, exercised their voting rights or 22.94 per cent voters cast their votes in the election,’ said Chattogram regional election officer Md Hasanuzzaman, also returning officer of the by-election, while announcing the result at about 9:00pm on Monday at a temporary camp at Gymnasium Ground in the port city\n\nMoslem bagged 87,246 votes while his nearest rival Abu Sufian got 17,935 votes.\n\nBesides Moslem and Sufian, Bangladesh Nationalist Front chairman SM Abul Kalam Azad obtained 1,185 votes, Islamic Front Bangladesh’s Syed Mohammad Farid Uddin 992 votes, National Awami Party’s Bapon Dasgupta 656 votes and independent candidate Mohammad Emdadul Haque 567 votes.\n\nBNP candidate Abu Sufian at about the noon urged the returning officer to postpone the voting and arrange re-election due to the irregularities but the AL candidate claimed that the vote was going on peacefully and properly.\n\nOn the Chattogram city’s Khwaja Road, a number of pro-AL Bangladesh Chhatra League activists were found staging a showdown with local weapons by hiding their faces with handkerchiefs.\n\nDuring a visit to the polling centre at Chandgaon N MC Model High School, New Age saw AL activists pushing BNP supporters out of the polling centre in the presence of law enforcers.\n\nBNP agent Salauddin Shahed alleged that AL activists prevented the BNP candidate from entering the Rabeya Bashri Institute and Al Humairya Mahila Madrasah centres.\n\nCMP Deputy Police commissioner Bijoy Basak said that just unpleasant incidents occurred in the centres but they did not hamper the voting.\n\nIn the morning few voters were seen at the Majidia Islamia Alia Madrasah centre in Chandgaon.\n\nThe election officials and agents were seen idling away their time.\n\nIn that centre, there were 4,902 voters– 2,348 males and 2554 females–for whom a total of 12 booths were set up.\n\nAt about 10:30am, no female voter was seen in the centre while a single male line had only six voters there.\n\nThe presiding officer for the female voters, Md Yusuf, said that the number of voters was poor due to the foggy weather.\n\nAn explosion was heard outside the voting centre at Ekhlasur Rahman Government Primary School at Bahaddarhat shortly after the voting opened.\n\nA voter in the Boalkhali upazila, Ziaul Haque, said that a group of AL activists ousted the BNP activists from the upazila’s Akubdandi Government Primary School centre at about 9:30am.\n\nThe centre’s presiding officer, Ahmed Hossain Buiyan, said that there was no problem in the polling centre, adding that they did not know about what was happening outside the centre.\n\nAfter casting his ballot at a voting station in the Chandgaon residential area, BNP candidate Abu Sufian said that there was no proper atmosphere for voting.\n\nSufian said that outsiders took position around polling centres and were preventing voters from entering polling booths.\n\n‘My agents were driven out of voting centres,’ he said.\n\nBut AL candidate Moslem Uddin Ahmed, after casting his vote at the Chandgaon centre at about 9:30am, brushed aside his rival’s allegations, saying that voters were casting their ballots in a nice and peaceful environment.\n\n‘It’s BNP’s job to make allegations. There hasn’t been any violence anywhere until now,’ said Moslem.\n\nIn a press conference at about 1:00pm at the BNP Chattogram office at Nasiman Bhaban, BNP candidate Abu Sufian demanded postponement of the election in view of the situation and urged the returning officer to arrange re-election to the constituency.\n\nHe said, ‘I gave a written application to the Returning Officer in this regard.’\n\nHe alleged that BNP agents were pushed out some 120 of the 170 centres.\n\nSufian added that fair election was impossible under this government.\n\nHe said that city BNP leader Sirajul Islam took treatment from the Chittagong Medical College Hospital after being injured by AL activists. AL people also chopped Jubo Dal activist Khorshed, he added.\n\nHe said that when he went to cast his vote at CDA Residential public School and College at Chandgaon a group of BCL activists led by city Mayor AJ M Nasir Uddin’s personal assistant Raihan Yusuf intercepted him and occupied the centre.\n\nRaihan Yusuf denied the allegation and said that there was no chance to take the control of a polling centre if EVMs were used.\n\nReturning officer Md Hasanuzzaman told New Age at about 2:30pm that they did not find any proof of ballot-stuffing or expulsion of BNP agents from polling centres.\n\nHe said that they also did not receive any application from the BNP candidate.\n\nChattogram Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner (Panchlaish Zone) Debdut Majumdar said that Abu Sufian went to a voting centre with a large number of supporters and activists, causing a disorder there and the police later escorted him out of the station."
