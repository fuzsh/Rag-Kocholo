        "text": "Although Bangladesh has established a comprehensive physical infrastructure to deliver health and family planning services with a network of primary health care facilities in rural areas, the impact of this health service network has been much less than expected because services do not reach all regions effectively. Two divisions, Sylhet and Chittagong, remain the most disadvantaged in terms of health and population outcomes and access to services, compounded by poor utilization of facilities in these areas. Moreover, the current health and population sector programs are beset with human resources and infrastructural problems. The Population Council organized a workshop to find answers to a key question: how can service delivery be improved in low-performing and hard-to-reach areas. This report shows that the workshop’s objectives were to: review current and emerging health and family planning issues particularly in low-performing and hard-to-reach areas; identify areas of deficienc...\n\nThis article examines the consequences of a “population-as-crisis” theme on the institutional configuration and resource endowments of health care services in an integrated Ministry of Health and Population Control in Bangladesh. The Ministry&#39;s focus on women as child bearers and its emphasis on sterilization supported by incentives has contradictory consequences as women become vulnerable to a limited health service and incentives encourage a focus on meeting sterilization targets. Both undermine people&#39;s access to and use of primary health care services. Findings from three studies, undertaken between 1978 and 1983, support the argument that despite international concern with preventive and promotive primary health care, simultaneous support for and emphasis on population control inhibits meeting the goals of a broad-based rural primary health care service."
