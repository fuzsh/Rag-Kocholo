        "text": "Information and Broadcasting Minister and Awami League Joint General Secretary Dr. Hasan Mahmud Wednesday (8 July) said the countrymen would not give any scope to BNP and its leaders to do ill politics of killing people through arson attacks.\n\n\"It would not be possible to carry out vandalism on vehicles, shops and public properties. So, I would like to urge the BNP to verify their popularity by joining in the elections,\" he said.\n\nThe minister made the remarks while addressing a view-exchange meeting with local public representatives of Rangunia and Boalkhali (partial) upazilas at Nurussafa Talukder Auditorium in Rangunia of the district.\n\nDr Hasan said the BNP leaders including Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir are making statements that they would not give more than a single day to the government. But, with the grace of Almighty, the incumbent government is in power for 14 and a half years, he added.\n\nHe urged the BNP to wait till the next general election to verify their popularity. The countrymen would vote to Bangabandhu's daughter Sheikh Hasina and elect her as the Prime Minister for the fourth time and would give her the responsibility of running the state, he added.\n\nThe information minister said the size of the budget was Taka 61,000 crore in 2006 during the BNP's tenure. And now, the size of the national budget is Taka 7,61,585 crore which is 11 and a half times more than their (BNP) budget, he said.\n\nDr. Hasan said the rural people are now getting all facilities like cities as the slogan of the last years of Awami League was 'villages will be turned into towns'.\n\nBoalkhali upazila chairman Rezaul Karim Raza, Chattogram Zila Parishad member and AL Chattogram North district unit vice president Abul Kashem Chisti, among others, addressed the meeting with Ranguniya upazila chairman Swajan Kumar Talukder in the chair.\n\nKrishak League, Chattogram North district unit, president Shafiqul Islam and AL Ranguniya upazila unit acting general secretary conducted it."
