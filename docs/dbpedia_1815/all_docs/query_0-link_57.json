        "text": "Two years ago I started a different initiative named ‘humanitarian bread basket’ on College Road of Chattogram city. However, I couldn’t keep it going for various setbacks and was upset about it. We tried to do something for the people in many ways during the corona period. Few days ago I saw on Facebook that a vegetable seller of Chattogram’s Garibullah Housing Society Bazar, Md Ibrahim, had kept a basket in front of his shop. It was written on a paper beside that, any helpless people can take vegetables from that basket. Talking to that vegetable seller the idea of starting ‘humanitarian bazar’ hit me.\n\nA man coming from Boalkhali upazila left vegetables worth Tk 1,500 in the basket. All the vegetable sellers of Karnafuli Bazar have decided to put one kg of vegetable in the basket every day. Two people from Naogaon and Natore districts phoned and asked how to launch this bazar. We even received phone calls from Cumilla. Notable persons also campaigned about this initiative on social media.\n\nActually people are suffering miserably with the soaring price of commodities. People in distress are collecting vegetables from the basket without hesitation. Until now almost 400 people have been benefitted from this.\n\nWe do the monitoring. And the main task of the management is done by a particular vegetable seller of the bazaar. We maintain regular contact with him. If the basket is emptied, it is filled again quickly.\n\nThere is no elaborate plan about this initiative actually. At the moment we are working to keep the ‘humanitarian bazar’ running until the holy month of Ramadan. After that, we’ll see what comes next. I dream that one day this bazaar will spread across the whole country."
