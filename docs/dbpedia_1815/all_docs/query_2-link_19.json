        "text": "Medhashmunir Ashram, one of the most significant Hindu pilgrimage sites, is a mountain retreat situated in Boalkhali, 22 miles away from Chittagong, on top of the Karaldanga hill. The Hindus in Bangladesh revere this place, as legends claim that this is the birthplace of Bashanti Puja, the celebration of Durga Puja during spring. Even though the ashram is considered to be one of the principal pilgrimage sites for the Hindu community, after Chandranath temple in Sitakunda and Adinath temple in Maheshkhali, people know little about its history and existence. While Bangladesh is getting ready for next year's Tourism Day, with its project 'Visit Bangladesh 2016' that aims to bring the tourism sector of the country in the forefront, by emphasising on the natural, archaeological and cultural assets that we are blessed with, the ashram committee believes that Medhashmunir Ashram has a great prospect for spiritual tourism if proper attention is given. Read more about this slice of heaven in Boalkhali in this week's spotlight."
