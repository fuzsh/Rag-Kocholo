        "text": "About 55 acres of Sri Sri Chandithirtha & Medosh Munir Ashram land were occupied by some influential people at Karadengha hill in Boalkhali upazila under the Chittagong district in Bangladesh.\n\nThis temple is situated in the picturesque surroundings of the hills about 500 feet above the ground. It is blessed with natural beauty. It has a unique, age-old history, and its natural beauty, tucked away from intrusive industrial development, allows pilgrims and visitors the scope to find inner peace in a place, adding to its uniqueness.\n\nBangladeshi Hindus hold Sri Sri Chandi Dham and Medosh Ashram in high esteem due to a legend that marks this area as the birthplace of Basanti Puja, the springtime celebration of Durga Puja.\n\nThe legend in Kalika Puran and Kamakhkha Puran states that in the age of truth (Satya Yuga), King Surath performed the first-ever Durga Puja in spring after getting instructions from Rishi Medha.\n\nKing Surath, after being defeated and losing his kingdom, decided to leave everything behind and went to the deep forest, where he met Samadhi Vaishya, who also took solace in the same forest after being ousted and betrayed by his family. While wandering in the forest, they met Medosh Muni, a sage meditating there. They went to him and asked him for the reasons behind their sufferings.\n\n“Mahamaya (the illusion)” came the answer from Medha Muni, who also suggested that if they could get rid of this illusion and satisfy Maa Durga, they would get Mahamukti. Their sufferings would come to an end.\n\nSitting in that forest with two perplexed souls, Medha Muni gave a series of advice called Sri Sri Chondi. On his suggestion, King Surath and Samadhi Vaishya performed the Basanti Puja and got back peace in their life. The origin of the ritual of performing Basanti Puja in spring or Chaitra is traced back to this event.\n\nSri Rama is believed to have performed Akalbodhan (Akal meaning untimely and Bodhan meaning awakening) to seek Devi Durga’s blessings for defeating Ravana. Since then, Prabhu Rama’s devotees have started celebrating Durga Puja in Sharat or autumn. As a result, Basanti Puja almost disappeared into oblivion, but it is still performed in a few Bengali households while observing all the rituals of Durga Puja.\n\nThe difference between the two Durga Pujas – Basanti Puja and Sharadiya Durga Puja – lies in their origin story and time of celebration; the rituals remain almost the same.\n\nIn late 1900, Srimat Vedananda Swami, after years and years of meditation, received the spiritual message that on top of the Karaldenga Hills in the forest, Medha Muni meditated and suggested King Surath offer a puja for the deity Durga for the first time. After the rediscovery of the ashram, Medhashmunir Ashram is considered one of the most important pilgrimage sites for devotees.\n\nMahendra Ghoshal and Neel Krishna Roy, owners of the land adjacent to the ashram, donated more than 68 acres of land and hills in the name of Dashabhuja Devi. Devi worship was commenced by constructing a house on the top of the mountain with thatch, bamboo and tin. It is known that the first priest appointed was Gauri Shankar Smrititirth from Kanungopara village.\n\nIn 1920 CE, Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi of Kashim Bazar, under the then Murshidabad district of united Bengal, built Sri Sri Chondi Mata Mandir at this shrine. Later, a brass Durga Murti (statue) was established by Jugendra Nath Bhattacharya, the police officer of Brahmadesh (now Myanmar).\n\nOn 5 April 1971, The Ashram was once again demolished when, during the Liberation War of Bangladesh, the Pakistani military used gunpowder, turned the entire place into piles of ashes, destroyed the six-feet deity and looted valuables.\n\nNo one took care of this sacred ashram right after Bangladesh’s independence. Subsequently, with the dedication of a newly formed Ashram committee of the city’s devotees, sadhus and pandits, the ashram has regained its past grandeur.\n\nIn 1987, a stone vigraha of the ten-armed Maa Durga, hand-made by artist Prafulla Kumar Acharya of Howla village, was established in Acharya’s village under the guidance of Haripad Kanungo, a social worker of Kanungo Para village. The annual worship of this Devi vigraha is performed continuously every day.\n\nA Ganesh temple is found at the entrance to the ashram. The marvellous main temple is situated about 500 feet up the hill. One has to climb around 140 stairs to reach the Medhas Muni Ashram. Sree Sree Chandi temple is in the main ashram. Samadhi Temple of Yugi Purusha Swami Vedananda Maharaj, the founder of the ashram, is adjacent to the Chandi Temple.\n\nThe Kamakshya temple is situated a little further along the hilly path to the right of the main ashram. Furthermore, a Shiva temple is on the top of the highest hill. After descending a few more stairs of that hill, devotees must climb again to the top of another mountain. The Tara Kali temple is at the top of that hill. Medhasswari Dakshina Kali temple is on a hill to the left of the main ashram.\n\nTemples of Kamakhya, Shiva and Tara Kali are at the junction of the mountain Manas Sarovar. There’s a lake about 300 feet below the main ashram. The mountain stream constantly flows into this lake. The Sita temple is next to it. Legend has it that Sita bathed in this lake during Treta Yuga. The Bhog house, Ashram Principal’s office, and Yatri Niwas are located near the main Chandi temple.\n\nThere are 12 tortoises of an almost-extinct species at the base of the jackfruit tree in front of the restaurant. They are known as sage turtles. This species of tortoise lives by eating flowers, leaves and fruit peels. It is said that a sage was turned into a tortoise by the curse of Rishi Medhas. The ashram has two cows and a deer cub under its care. About 30 people are working in the temple, said Swarup Chowdhury, who oversees the temple.\n\nShreemath Bulbulananda, Maharaj of the Sri Sri Chandi Tirtha & Medhas Muni Ashram, stated that the ashram is spread over 68.19 acres of land, which is held as the deity’s property. But despite the court’s injunction, some local influential quarters grabbed about 55 acres of land of the ashram, Maharaj Bulbulanand alleged.\n\nNothing prevents one from enjoying the serenity and natural beauty this place offers. Once devotees climb the stairs, they will find a different universe up there. As soon as devotees enter the Ashram’s territory, pilgrims will suddenly discover themselves surrounded by nature – by trees and flowers, birds and reptiles, hills and meadows.\n\nEverything is silent except for the chirping of birds and reptiles revving up in their homes, along with devotional chants and tinkling sounds of the brass bells used during Puja. While climbing the stairs, all devotees can see is a riot of greenery, the pinwheel patterned night-flowering jasmines, or as people lovingly call it, Shiuly, beneath devotees feet, signalling the arrival of Durga Puja.\n\nThis area is also home to lacs of trees, including mahogany, rain trees, bamboo, mango, and many more varieties, which the Ashram members have nurtured for a long time. They also cultivate honey and use it for different rituals in the temples. For this vast plantation scheme, the ashram recently received a tree plantation award from the Bangladesh government.\n\nOn reaching the peak, pilgrims will find seven temples. While pilgrims will find some devotees sitting in a corner humming kirtans and preparing to feed the devotees (Anna Prasad), others will be busy making garlands and helping the Maharaja of the temple to prepare for the Puja. In the backyard, one will find people tying knots on trees, while some might feed a group of turtles. It will take a whole day to walk around the entire area.\n\nDuring Durga Puja, thousands of devotees gather here. As the origin of Basanti Puja, this place attracts the most significant number of devotees annually. Hundreds of thousands of devotees visit the Ashram each year, but with proper roads and increased publicity, this number could grow significantly. Donations from devotees primarily fund the temple. There were no stairways in the past, making it difficult to climb to the temples. One of the devotees constructed the current 11-foot-wide, tile-fitted stairs.\n\nMost temples here, including Nat Mandir, Kamakhya Mandir, and Shiv Mandir, owe their existence to the generosity and faith of the devotees. Following independence, various temples were constructed with donations and financial support from numerous devotees and wealthy individuals, both locally and internationally. Every installation was made possible by devotees’ financial aid, enhancing the temple complex’s beauty. This place could be promoted as a significant site for religious tourism in Bangladesh, attracting Hindu devotees worldwide to visit the ashram.\n\n(Featured Image Source: Organiser)"
