The Arab traders had business transactions with this port since 9th century AD. Chittagong region was under the kingdom of arakan during sixth and seventh centuries. Before the Muslim rule Chittagong had been either under the control of the Arakans or under the kings of Burma. Sultan Fakruddin Mubarak Shah (1338-1349) of Sonargaon conquered Chittagong in 1340. After the defeat of Sultan Giasuddin Mahmud Shah in the hands of Sher Shah in1538, the Arakanise again captured Chittagong. From this time onward until its conquest by the Mughals this region was under the control of the Portuguese and the Magh pirates. The Mughal Commandar Bujurg Umed Khan expelled the Portuguese from the area in 1666 and established Mughal rule there. The Mughals renamed Chittagong as Islamabad. On 18th April 1930, the revolutionaries looted the Chittagong armoury under the leadership of Mastarda surya sen. During this time the leaders of the women revolutionaries were pritilata waddedar, Bina Das, Lila Ray, Kalpana Dutta etc. Revolutionary Swadesh Roy was shot dead by the British soldiers in the Kalar Pole encounter. Besides, wounded Debu Prashad, Rajat Sen and Manaranjan Sen committed suicide to avoid arrests.
