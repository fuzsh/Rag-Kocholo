        "text": "# Two teachers die of heatstroke\n\n# 50 more students fall sick in different institutions\n\n# Parents demand online classes\n\nThe decision to open educational institutions in the heat alert was not good\n\nDr Abu Jamil Faisel, Public Health Specialist\n\nIt is unreasonable to shut down all educational institutions nationwide based solely on forecasts\n\n- Mohibul Hasan Nowfel, Education Minister\n\nSadiqa Rahman is a student of class 4 of English version of Motijheel Ideal School and College. Her classes started at 7 am and ended at 9:40 pm. She vomited and became ill after attending the class amid heatwave yesterday.\n\nNot only Sadika, many students of Motijheel Ideal are falling sick after attending classes in the heat. Not only students of capital, such cases were found various institutions in the other districts of the country.\n\nTwo teachers of the school died of heat stroke. More than 50 students are sick across the country. Parents have expressed concern about this. They said that it is better to stop teaching in school in this summer and take classes online.\n\nIt was known that the educational institution was supposed to open on April 21 after the holidays of Ramadan, Eid and Pahela Baishakh. But suddenly the Meteorological Department issued a heat alert in the intense heat wave of summer. As a result, the Ministry of Education declared a holiday for one week. Although the hit alert did not end, the educational institution was reopened to overcome the learning deficit of the students. Yesterday was the first day after opening.\n\nTwo teachers died in Chattogram, Jashore\n\nTwo teachers died of heatstroke after the opening day of institutions across the country. One of them is a madrasah teacher and one is a secondary school teacher. Madrasah teacher Maulana Md Mushtaq Ahmed Qutbi (55), died in Kalurghat Ferry of Chattogram. He was working at Khitapchar Azizia Mabudia Alim Madrasah in Boalkhali upazila of the district.\n\nAnother teacher named Ahsan Habib died after coming to school in Jashore yesterday morning. The deceased Ahsan Habib was the son of Yusuf Ali Mollah of Chilampur village in Deara union of Jashore Sadar upazila. He was an assistant teacher of Ahmedabad Secondary School in Sadar upazila.\n\n50 more students sick in various institutions\n\n10 students fall sick due to scorching heat at Saltha School in Faridpur. Three students, including a child, were admitted to the hospital. The incident took place at Ramkantapur Government Primary School in Ramkantapur union of the upazila around 11am yesterday. On information, Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) and Saltha Police Station Officer-in-Charge (OC) visited the spot. The Upazila Health Department claims that the students have become ill due to the heat.\n\nIn Noakhali, 18 students of two educational institutions in Hatia and Begumganj have fallen sick due to the scorching heat. The incident took place at Joynarayanpur Islamia Fazil Madrasah and Hatia Janakalyan Education Trust High School in Aman Ullapur upazila of Begumganj around 10am yesterday. The teachers called the local rural doctor and sent the students home with first aid.\n\nOn the other hand, classes were scheduled to start from 10:20 am at Joynarayanpur Islamia Fazil Madrasah in Aman Ullapur of Begumganj. Everyone was waiting for the teacher in the classroom. At around 10:00 pm, Afifa lost consciousness as she could not bear the heat. After pouring water on her head, she regained consciousness. Then her teacher father took her home.\n\nBesides, there are reports of illness in various educational institutions in the capital.\n\nParents demand online classes\n\nMd Faik, a class 2 student of Motijheel Ideal School, said the classroom was very hot. There is no AC there, so we had a lot of trouble in class.\n\nMd Faiq's mother said, \"I did not allow him to go out in the heat of these few days. He took his first class today. I am very tired of the heat. It is normal for children to vomit in this heat. Now after going home, I will see how he is doing, I will decide whether to bring him to school tomorrow or not.\"\n\nFreedom fighter Ziaul Kabir Dulu, president of the Guardian Unity Forum, said that the Ministry of Health has advised to close the educational institutions for one more week due to the intense heat wave in some places. In view of this situation, it is necessary to conduct educational activities through online considering the health safety of the students and to protect them from heatstroke. It will be very helpful to fill the learning deficit by conducting online class activities.\n\nEducation Minister rules out school closure\n\nEducation Minister Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury dismissed any possibility of nationwide closure of educational institutions due to heatwave in parts of the country. Education Minister Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury Nowfel said that all educational institutions will have to be closed if there is too much heat in some places. If anything happens, the idea that the educational institution will have to be closed first, it should not be maintained.\n\nThe Minister said this while inaugurating the Technical and Vocational Education Week at Dhaka Mohila Polytechnic Institute yesterday.\n\nThe Education Minister said that the temperature of Dhaka city is not the temperature of Bangladesh. In some districts, if the temperature reaches unbearable levels, schools can make their own decisions. But we are also seeing that some air-conditioned schools in the divisional cities have been closed due to pressure from parents. This is unacceptable. Our new curriculum is institution-centric. So it is important for students to come to school and college. Online classes can be done in the field of higher education. The Ministry has no problem with that.\n\nMentioning that the guardians are discussing and criticizing the opening of schools through social media, the minister also said that the state is not run on the basis of this discussion and criticism. It is very important for our students to achieve learning outcomes. Work on the new curriculum is underway. So we can't decide in terms of popularity, we have to make decisions in terms of reality.\n\nHealth Experts advised amid heatwave\n\nPublic health expert Dr Abu Jamil Faisel said children are already at risk due to extreme heat. In the meantime, a heat alert has been issued again. In this situation, the decision to open educational institutions was not good.\n\nHe advised the teachers that the authorities should play more role during school hours. Students should not go out of the classroom in any way, do not play sports. Besides, if the children are thirsty, they should be fed something like water or juice. Running or playing in the playground in this heat can cause any kind of danger. If children eat unhealthy syrup, saline or ice cream outside, they will be at risk of diarrhea. So it is very important for us to keep a careful eye on the educational institutions at this time."
