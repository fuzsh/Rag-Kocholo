Anisur Rahman announced the results of the 292 polling centres in the constituency after polls closed on Sunday.\n\nSaiful received 84,412 votes, his closest competitor independent candidate Touhid Jong Murad received 76,202 votes, and boat candidate Enamur received 56,361 votes.\n\nAfter the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, a significant portion of the victims received treatment at Enam Medical College Hospital, which led to public praise for Enamur.\n\nThough he had no connection to Awami League politics previously, he received the Awami League’s nomination for the 2014 polls. He won the polls uncontested.\n\nEnamur was made a state minister after he retained the seat in the 2018 polls.\n\nAbsolute majority for Awami League\n\nThe ruling Awami League has clinched its biggest ever majority in parliament in Sunday’s general election marked by a boycott by the BNP and a low turnout.\n\nThe resounding win means party chief Sheikh Hasina is headed for a record-extending fourth consecutive term - and the fifth in total.\n\nThe party secured 152 out of 208 seats in Sunday’s election with the outcome of a third of the seats still unannounced, according to unofficial results released until 2:15am on Monday.\n\nThe party lost most of the other seats to its rebel candidates, who were allowed to run freely as part of a strategy to drum up enthusiasm among voters amid the boycott by the largest opposition party.\n\nAfter violent protests in the run-up to the polls, the focus was on the turnout, but the final figure could not be confirmed as the Election Commission stopped announcing the results midway.\n\nAfter the voting ended, Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal put the provisional turnout at roughly 40 percent.\n\nAs many as 45 independent candidates, mostly Awami League leaders who contested the party’s choice, won in the balloting.\n\nThe Jatiya Party, which was the main opposition in parliament, managed only eight seats.\n\nThe party’s candidates have lost several of the 26 constituencies left by the Awami League in a seat-sharing deal.\n\nThe Awami League’s allies the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and the Workers Party won one each.\n\nThe Kalyan Party, which had once been in the BNP-led coalition, also secured a win in one seat."
