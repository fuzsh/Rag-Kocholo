        "text": "The closure of the Kalurghat Bridge in Chattogram and the subsequent launch of a ferry service on the Karnaphuli River on August 1st have ignited a heated debate among the locals. While authorities claim the ferry service was a necessary step during the bridge renovation, residents of Boalkhali are voicing their frustration over the decision, especially considering the ongoing monsoon season.\n\nSince the inception of the ferry service, relentless rains have added to the challenges faced by commuters. The tidal waters have caused concerns of pontoon sinking, causing delays that extend travel times for vehicles crossing the river. Daily commuters are experiencing an escalating level of distress, leading many to question the timing of the ferry launch.\n\nThe decision has sparked the ire of Boalkhali residents, who feel that the bridge renovation should have been scheduled before or after the monsoon season to mitigate the current suffering. Abul Kalam, a local businessman, expressed the sentiments of many, stating, \"The people of Boalkhali and South Chattogram have endured years of inconvenience due to the\n\none-way bridge. The introduction of ferries has only exacerbated our suffering. The toll on both our time and our goods is becoming unbearable.\"\n\nCritics argue that while authorities initially promised regular operations of two ferries, the reality is far from that commitment. Often, vehicles are forced to cross using a single ferry, leading to further delays and frustrations for passengers. The management of the ferry service has also come under scrutiny, with reports of passengers enduring undue hardships.\n\nMd. Jasim Uddin, a vocal resident of Boalkhali, questioned the authorities' rationale behind initiating the ferry service during the rainy season. \"Who benefits from the bridge renovation if we, the citizens, are left to endure such suffering?\" he questioned. \"Our well-being should be taken into account, and this decision seems to neglect our needs.\"\n\nThe impact of the ferry decision on public health has also become evident. Pooja Barua, a permanent resident of Boalkhali, shared a harrowing account of her struggles. \"My mother's health is deteriorating, and she requires dialysis in the city twice a week. The bridge inconvenience was manageable, but the ferry disruptions have now made it near impossible to access timely medical care.\"\n\nBoalkhali Municipality Mayor Zahurul Islam acknowledged the challenges and emphasized that the decision was influenced by the upcoming Cox's Bazar rail line launch. \"The need to renovate the bridge was pressing due to the impending railway inauguration in September-October,\" he explained. \"However, we recognize the public's plight, particularly during high tide days like Amabashya and Purnima.\"\n\nMember of Parliament for Chattogram 8 Constituency, Noman Al Mahmud, expressed regret over the situation while emphasizing the developmental nature of such projects. \"While I am sorry for the suffering of our people, development activities inevitably come with some hardships,\" he stated. \"Efforts are being made to expedite the Kalurghat bridge repair work.\""
