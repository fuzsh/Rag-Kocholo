        "text": "Overview\n\nThe main road network of the country is under the Roads and Highways Department (RHD). Maintenance of the roads including bridges is carried out by RHD. There is approximately 21,483 km of roads under this department. The road network capable to carry vehicles has increased significantly and is increasing every year. Bangladesh government realises the importance of road maintenance and the RHD has given more emphasis on this subject. Only a few years back there was no proper planning and system for road maintenance and international agencies assisted the Government of Bangladesh to address and solve the problem.\n\nThe Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges is the body for formulation and administration of the rules, regulations and laws relating to road transport, national highways and bridges. Bangladesh has 4 ministries responsible for transportation within the country. They are:\n\nMinistry of Road Transport and Bridges- responsible for road safety.\n\nMinistry of Civil Aviation and Tourism- responsible for civil aviation.\n\nMinistry of Shipping- responsible for maritime transport.\n\nMinistry of Railways- responsible for rail transport.\n\nThe Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges has 2 Divisions : the Road Transport and Highways Division and the Bridge Division. RHD has again 4 components\n\nRoads and Highways Department\n\nBangladesh Road Transport Authority\n\nBangladesh Road Transport Corporation\n\nDhaka Transport Coordination Authority\n\nRoads and Highways Department (RHD)\n\nThe Roads and Highways Department (RHD) within the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges, is responsible for the management of approximately 21,483 km comprising 3 categories of road classes (National, Regional and Zilla road).\n\nList of Officers- RHD\n\nRoad Network at a Glance\n\nRoad Data\n\nCategories of Roads\n\nNational Highways connect the national capital with different divisional and old district headquarters port cities and international highways. These roads have been categorised as National Highways considering the national importance and geographical positions. Each National Highway has been provided with a name and a number, such as Dhaka-Chattogram Highway has been numbered N-1 whereas N stands for National. This number can only be changed by RHD headquarters.\n\nRegional Highways connect different regions and new district headquarters not connected by National Highways and Zilla Roads. Regional Highways are named after National Highways of national importance. Names and numbers of these highways are decided such as Cumilla-Lalmai, R-140, whereas R stands for Regional meaning the Region. This number can only be changed by RHD headquarters.\n\nZilla Roads are defined as Roads connecting Upazila head quarters and other important rural centres with the existing Road network. Name and numbers of these roads are decided such as Akhaura-Agartala, Z-1203 whereas Z stands for Zilla.\n\nImportant Highway Conditions\n\nDevelopment Projects\n\nThe Bangladesh Road Master Plan 2007 estimated the medium growth forecast of both freight and passenger transport which will be 6% over the master plan period of 2005-25. As such, issues related to road network have been identified by RHD, which are follows:\n\nNational Highways are needed to be upgraded into 4/6 lanes with medians to commensurate with higher traffic growth and to improve road safety\n\nConstruction of new bridges to ensure uninterrupted traffic flow including replacement and major repair of existing old narrow bridges for ensuring safety\n\nRoad safety to be properly addressed in road design and enforced in traffic management\n\nDeveloping comfortable road network to enhance the tourism industry\n\nMaintenance needs a higher priority, more resources, improved management reform and better quality standard\n\nInstitutional reform, and\n\nDigitalization of RHD activities\n\nIn addition, LGED under the purview of rural road master plan has been developing the farm to market roads. It has prioritized Upazila, Union and Village roads and a target was set for development of additional 22000 Km Upazila and Union Roads in future. The low lying topography requiring a substantial raised earth embankment of\n\nall kinds of roads, frequent flooding during monsoon due to global climate change phenomena and washing out the road embankment are emerging of challenges of the sector.\n\nImportant Ongoing Projects\n\nConstruction of Tunnel under the River Karnaphuli, Ctg\n\nThe implementation work of 3.40 kilometer long tunnel under the river Karnaphuli at a cost of BDT.8,446.46 crore is progressing and 20 percent of physical work has already been completed. This tunnel will connect west part of Chattogram city to East part, reduce traffic jam and ease direct road communication among Dhaka- Chattogram-Cox’s Bazar. Besides, it will contribute to GDP growth about 0.16 percent. The project has been approved in the ECNEC meeting in 24 November 2015. Land acquisition and preparation of detailed design work is in progress.\n\nConstruction of BRT Lane (Elevated Section)\n\nSteps have been taken to construct of 20 kilometer long Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lane at the cost of BDT.2,039.85 crore from Gazipur to Hazrat Shah Jalal(R) international Airport. Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) is responsible for implementation of 4.5-kilometer elevated section. The implementation work is progressing and expected to be completed in 2020\n\nConstruction of Dhaka-Ashulia Elevated Expressway\n\nTo construct about 24-kilometer-long Dhaka-Ashulia Elevated Expressway from Hazrat Shah Jalal (R) international airport to EPZ through Ashulia, the project has been approved by the ECNEC with an estimated cost of BDT. 16,901.32 crore. To construct the expressway on G-to-G basis, commercial agreement has been signed with a Chinese Government nominated company. It is expected to complete the project by 2022. It will connect Asian Highway Network and almost all National Highway. Moreover, it will reduce traffic congestion in Abdullahpur-Ashulia-Baipail-Chandra corridor.\n\nConstruction of Dhaka East-West Elevated Expressway\n\nTo construct about 39.24 kilometer long Elevated Expressway from Baliapur of Dhaka-Aricha highway to Langolbond of Dhaka-Chattogram road through Nimtoli-Keranigonj-Fatulla-Bandor, PDPP has been approved with an estimated cost of BDT.16,388.50 crore. Malaysian Government has given proposal to construct it through G-to-G basis. This expressway will connect National Highways and Asian Highway. It will reduce traffic congestion in and around Dhaka city and traffic from Chattogram, Sylhet and other eastern part and from south western region through Padma Bridge to the north-western districts will be convenient.\n\nConduct Feasibility Study to Construct Subway (Underground Metro) in Dhaka city\n\nInitiative has been taken to construct subway in order to reduce traffic jam in Dhaka city. In this process 4 preliminary alignments have been selected. But present plan is to construct route-1 (Tongi- Airport- Kakoli- Mohakhali- Moghbazar- Palton- Shapla Chottor-Sayedabad- Narayangonj Signboard) and Route-2 (Aminbazar-Gabtoli-Asad gate-New market-TSC-Ittefaq-Sayedabad). To conduct Feasibility Study, the consultant has been appointed with the cost of BDT.219.44 crore and study will start very soon.\n\nFeasibility Study of Tunnel Under the River Jamuna\n\nInitiative has been taken to conduct feasibility study to construct tunnel under the river Jamuna which connects Gaibandha and Jamalpur district. The study will start in time after approval of proposed project by the concern authority.\n\nConstruction of Other Large Bridges\n\nIn order to maintain uninterrupted road network, initiatives have been taken to build new bridges at different location. As a part of this, feasibility study for construction of bridges at ‘Rahmatpur-Babugonj-Muladi-Hijla’ roads over Arialkha river, at ‘Lebukhali-dumki-boga-Doshamina-golacipa -Amragachi’ roads over Golacipa river, at ‘Kocua-betagi-Potuakhali-Lohalia-Kalia’ roads over Payra river has been completed. PDPP has been approved for these three proposed bridge costing of BDT.1,944.24 crore. It is expected that construction of these bridges will start very soon.\n\nMoreover, feasibility study is going on for 5 other bridges; over Payra river in Patuakhali-Amtoli-Borguna roads, over Karkhana river in Bakergonj-Baufol road, over Meghna river in Bhulta-Araihazar-Nabinagar roads, over Bishkhali river in Borguna-Pathorghata road and over Tetulia and Kalabodor river which connect Barishal with Bhola. Construction work of these bridges will start in time.\n\nRoad Distance Matrix\n\nDistance Matrix for all the districts of Bangladesh is shown as a chart below:\n\nBangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA)\n\nBangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) was Established under section 2A of Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1983, (Amendment-1987) Vide SRO No-303/Law/87/MVRT/1E-7/84(part), Dated 20/12/87 and has been functioning since January 1988. BRTA is the regulatory body to control, manage and ensure discipline in the road transport sector and road safety related areas in Bangladesh. It is an authority under the Ministry of Roads and Bridges for carrying out the purposes mentioned in the Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1983. The Chairman is the chief executive of the authority.

It was established under the Government Ordinance No.7 of 1961 dated 4 February 1961. Following the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, it assumed its current name. BRTC is a semi-autonomous corporation under the Ministry of Roads and Bridges. BRTC provides both passenger and cargo transport services.\n\nBRTC operates 3 international bus services (Dhaka to Kolkata, Agartala, and Siliguri in India). Inside Bangladesh, it operates inter-district bus services through its bus depots in Chattogram, Bogura, Cumilla, Pabna, Rangpur, Barisal and Sylhet. It also operates intra-city bus services in many major cities of the country. For transportation of cargo, BRTC operates a fleet of 170 trucks. About twenty percent of the government food transport uses BRTC's trucks. The two main truck depots are located at Dhaka and Chattogram.\n\nBRTC's main driver training institute is located in Joydevpur, Gazipur District, about forty kilometres north of Dhaka. It also has several other training institutes located in Chattogram, Bogura, Khulna, and Jhenaidah. For more details please see: http://www.brtc.gov.bd/\n\nActivities of BRTC\n\nTo operate road transport services for both passengers and cargo.\n\nTo provide safe, reliable and efficient transport service at an affordable fare.\n\nTo facilitate private sector in transport service and introduction of new routes.\n\nTo play strategic interventional role at the time of emergency.\n\nTo provide training facilities for Drivers, Mechanics and in transport management in order to develop skilled manpower in the road transport sector for both home and abroad.\n\nTo utilize BRTC's land and properties for additional revenue earnings for subsidizing the unprofitable bus routes and services for disabled, women's, students, government employees, poor and destitute etc.\n\nTo contracting out and sub-contracting the buses to the able private owners so as to promote\n\ncompetition for quality services and co-existence of the public-private relationship in the road transport sector for greater private sector participation in the operation of BRTC buses.\n\nTo research vehicle and engine types and safety considerations for bringing harmony in operation of the bus and truck services and to combat the air pollution's factor for better environment.\n\nList of BRTC Officials are as follows:\n\nBRTC Bus Depots\n\nDhaka Transport Co-ordination Authority (DTCA)\n\nDhaka Transport Coordination Authority was established on 02 September 2012 to prepare strategic Transport Plan and provide regular supervision and co-ordination for all possible planning for transportation infrastructure development works within Dhaka city and adjacent districts. DTCA jurisdiction covers 7400 Sq km that includes districts of Dhaka, Narayangonj, Munshigonj, Mankgonj, Gazipur and Narsingdi district including Dhaka North City Corporation, Dhaka South City Corporation, Gazipur City Corporation and Narayanganj City Corporation. BTCA is responsible to provide a planned modernized transportation system for greater Dhaka area and Ensure safe, reliable, faster and affordable Public Transport by introducing integrated transport planning.\n\nObjectives and Functions of DTCA\n\nTo ensure interagency cooperation and coordination in transportation sector\n\nTo ensure an integrated and planned transportation system formulation\n\nTo introduce and expand Mass Rapid Transit system\n\nTo improve traffic management\n\nTo improve public transport level of service\n\nTo develop and construct mass transit system as part of an integrated public transport network\n\nDesign, planning and construction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system\n\nReview and modification of the Government approved Strategic Transport Plan (STP) and to provide advice and guidance for other agencies\n\nTraffic impact assessment of government or private owned high rise building and any housing project and issue permit for traffic circulation plan\n\nPlan, coordinate and approve recommended transport projects of other agencies\n\nRoute and network planning to develop an efficient public transport network\n\nManage central fare collection and establish and manage clearing house\n\nRoad Security\n\nVehicles without fitness, unskilled drivers, violation of traffic rules, absence of proper road marks and poor maintenance condition of roads, etc. have contributed to an alarming number of road accidents. Road accidents have become a daily and deadly phenomenon in Bangladesh that has one of the worst crash rates in the world, at more than 60 per 10,000 registered motor vehicles. The official death toll for road traffic accidents is about 4,000 a year. Road safety activists blame shoddy roads, poorly maintained vehicles and reckless drivers for such fatal accidents causing thousands of deaths every year. Research studies show multifaceted causes of road accidents ranging from population explosion, unplanned urbanisation, and tremendous growth of motorised as well as non-motorised vehicles. Improper traffic management is also termed a major cause of road accidents. According to the Bangladesh Jatrikalyaan Samiti's database, 7,397 people were killed in 4,979 road accidents with 16,193 casualties only in 2017. Government intervention to this effect has stopped race of accidents but more pragmatic measures are urgently required.\n\nRoad Safety measures taken by the Government\n\nA road redesign project is being implemented through identifying the accident black spots on the national highways. The intensity of road accidents has been reduced due to proper maintenance of road and straightening of road alignment. The ‘Improvement of Black Spots in National Highways’ for the treatment of 121 black spots at an estimated cost of BDT.168.05 crore has been completed during FY2016-17. On the other hand, a vast program for safety on road through overload control by means of installing weighbridge at each important traffic origination point, signing and signaling of roads is under implementation for a long time. In addition, a feasibility report was submitted by the Accident Research Institute (ARI) on accident-prone spots that were identified by the Highway Police to reduce the accidents to a minimum level. The approval process of the project ‘Establishment of necessary sign and road marking on National and Regional Highways and development of dangerous risky corridor in the identified risky areas’ is in progress in order to set up sign and marking at 128 new spots.\n\nAt present, a study project to design properly of at 752 intersection points at a cost of BDT.3.24 crore. An investment project will be taken up for the development of intersection points according to the project design.\n\nBridges of Bangladesh\n\nAll the bridges & tunnels having length of 1500 m or over are looked after by the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA). BBA is an autonomous organization under the Bridges Division with a total manpower 211 staff. the Bridges Division under the Ministry of Road Transport & Bridges was established in March 2008, and has played an important role in the transport sector of the country. As per the Rules of Business, implementation & maintenance of bridges, toll road, flyover, expressway, causeway, ring road etc. have come under the purview of this Division. Head office of BBA is at “Setu Bhaban”, New Airport Road, Banani, Dhaka.\n\nContact list of important officers of BBA are:\n\nMajor Bridges in Bangladesh\n\nIn recent years, the construction of a number of bridges such as the Bangabandhu Jamuna Bridge, Meghna Bridge, Meghna-Gumti Bridge, Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge, Shambhuganj Bridge and Mahananda Bridge as been completed. It has established a strategic link between the East and the West of Bangladesh has integrated the country, is generating multifaceted benefits to the people and promoting inter-regional trade. Apart from quick movement of goods and passenger traffic, it is facilitating transmission of electricity and natural gas and has integrated the telecommunication links.\n\nMajor Bridges of Bangladesh are:\n\nOther Ongoing Projects\n\nPadma Multipurpose Bridge Project\n\nSupport to Dhaka Elevated Expressway project\n\nDhaka Elevated Expressway project\n\nConstruction of multi-line tunnels under Karnaphuli river\n\nGreater Dhaka Sustainable Urban Transport Project (BRT, Gazipur-Airport)\n\nDhaka-Ashulaisu Elevated Expressway Project\n\nFeasibility study project for subway construction in Dhaka city\n\nBridge construction project on Paira River on Kachua-Betagi Road\n\nFeasibility study project for 4 bridge project\n\nPatuakhali-Amtali-Barguna-Kakichira road (R-880) Bridge construction on pigeon river\n\nConstruction of bridge on Bakerganj-Baupal Upazila Road (Z8806 & 8044) Factory River\n\nWrinkle - Two and a half thousand - Bachcharanpur road (R-203) Bridge construction on the Meghna river\n\nConstruction of bridge over Tetulia and Kalbadar river on Barisal-Bhola road\n\nPatuakhali-Amtali-Barguna-Kakichira road (R-880) Bridge on the Bishkhali river\n\nSasek Road Link Project- II (upgradation of Alenga-Hatikamrul-Rangpur Highway to four lanes) (bridge authority part -34 kilometers)\n\nInternational Corridors Leading to Bangladesh\n\nBangladesh has the potential to become a transport and transshipment center for the sub-region. It borders India and Myanmar and is geographically close to Bhutan, Nepal, and Kunming—the key transportation hub in southwest People’s Republic of China (PRC). With the opening of the Bhangabandhu Bridge over the Jamuna River and the ongoing Padma multipurpose Bridge, the Dhaka–Chattogram transport corridor and other strategic transport corridors can facilitate trade between Bangladesh and the North-Eastern states of India, the Indian state of West Bengal, Bhutan, and Nepal, thereby attracting more foreign and domestic traffic to the country.\n\nSouth Asia is the least integrated region and the cost of trading across borders is one of the highest in the world. Co-operation with its neighboring countries offers benefits to Bangladeshi owned road, rail and water transport services and port services. Integrating the transport network of South Asia is important to Nepal, Bhutan, and regions such as northeast India as it will end their landlocked or semi-isolated status. Within such a framework, Nepal, Bhutan, and the northeastern region of India would have the benefit of improved access to the ports and important economic centers of the region, and a choice of routes and modes.\n\nGiven the large potential for reduction in transportation costs, allowing the landlocked region of North-Eastern India, Bhutan, and Nepal access to Chattogram port through Bangladesh’s eastern border or to Mongla port through its northwestern border has been a key issue among concerned authorities. Defining the corridors, strengthening the systems and facilities at the borders, upgrading the roads / bridges, and bilateral negotiations for agreements will definitely improve the conditions for trucks or containers to exchange cross-border freight wagons.\n\nRoad transport has been playing a dominant role carrying bilateral trade between Bangladesh and India. Nearly 70-80% of all overland trade between Bangladesh and India passes through Benapole/Petropole border point. However, the only road connecting Benapole/Petrapole with the Kolkata is still 5.5 meter wide, and highly congested.\n\nIn the context of Nepal-Bangladesh, although India has allowed a route (by road) between these two countries across the “Chicken Neck” for bilateral trade, yet goods are required to be transshipped at Banglabandh border point. This route is more than 1300 km long, as such not very cost-effective, consequently very little used. Since this route cannot be used for third country trade, Nepal's export and import traffic uses Kolkata port, which is often congested compared to Bangladesh seaport of Mongla, which has spare capacity and a direct broad-gauge link with Birgunj (Nepal) through Rauxal Indian border point. But for this route and Mongla port to be used for third country trade of Nepal, India has to agree to such transit arrangement.\n\nAsian Highway\n\nThe Asian Highway (AH) projects of UN-ESCAP have already identified the major road links among the countries of South Asia. Subsequently, the SAARC Regional Multimodal Study (SRMTS) completed in 2006, also identified a number of routes which could provide efficient regional connectivity. The connectivity to all the 3-hinterland countries/territories should be conceived within the framework of regional economic integration, where all natural and environmental resources, facilities and opportunities should be exploited for the benefit of all countries in the sub-region.\n\nBangladeshi national highways are all 2-lanes only, but extensively used. These highways were built based on an axle-load limit of 8.2 tons compared to 10.2 tons axle load limit in India, Nepal and Bhutan. India has now adopted 12-ton axle load limits. Most of the trucks used in neighboring countries are usually over-loaded. As such it would not be desirable to allow these overloaded vehicles to move along Bangladeshi road network. Major road networks of Bangladesh, however, needs to be upgraded to expressway standards with higher axle-load limits.\n\nThe SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study (SRMTS) recommended a number of routes to strengthen connectivity among the countries and territories of North-Eastern sub-region of South Asia. Out of these, the following routes could be opened immediately to facilitate movement of goods and passengers.\n\nRoad Route-1: Petrapole Jashore-Dhaka (via ferry) - Sylhet- Tamabil (Indian border) with a link to Agartala.\n\nRoad route 2: Kathmandu – Kaharvitta – Phulbari – Banglabandha – Mongla/Chattogram\n\nRoad route-3: Thimphu – Phuentsholing – Jaigon – Chengrabandha – Burimari – (i) Chattogram (966 km), and/or (ii) Mongla (880 km)\n\nFor additional information, please see the following documents:\n\nFor contact details, please see the following link:"
