        "text": "GREENVILLE, S.C. (FOX Carolina) - After two days of testimony, a judge is considering whether a child suspect will be tried as an adult after shooting his 12-year-old classmate nearly two years ago.\n\nOn March 31, 2022, a school resource officer at Tanglewood Middle School in Greenville called for backup after hearing shots fired in the hallway. Jamari Jackson, 12, was found shot in the chest and later died.\n\nThe student suspect ran from the scene but was found by a nearby home about an hour later. He remains in custody with the Department of Juvenile Justice in Columbia.\n\nA waiver hearing happens when a prosecutor wants to have someone who is considered a juvenile tried as an adult. The student suspect appeared in Greenville County Family Court for the waiver hearing at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday.\n\nTestimony lasted for the full day and court went into recess shortly before 5:30 p.m. The hearing resumed on Friday shortly after 10:30 a.m. and continued until 4:30 p.m.\n\nAfter two days of testimony, the judge said she was taking all the details under advisement and would schedule a hearing when she reached a decision.\n\nThe suspect’s defense attorney, Ryan Beasley, and an attorney for Jamari’s family, Margie Pizarro, both spoke after court on Friday.\n\nPizarro said the family was pleased with how the solicitor’s office presented the case and believes the case should be moved to general sessions court. She also said they learned new information, including about a disturbing two-page handwritten note found in the suspect’s backpack.\n\n“We certainly were more convinced after two days of testimony,” Pizarro said.\n\nShe said watching the video of Jamari being shot was very difficult for the family, who has his stocking hanging on the mantle right now for Christmas.\n\n“You took the life of a 12-year-old,” Pizarro said. “For no real good reason that we were able to see based on the evidence that was presented because it just didn’t exist.\n\n“You’ve got a little boy’s life on the line,” Beasley said, who is fighting for his client to stay in family court. He said he found it hard to fathom trying a 12-year-old as an adult since their mindset is so different.\n\n“It was hard for me to defend a juvenile because you can’t communicate with them like you can an adult,” said Beasley, who felt the weight of the case as the father of a 12-year-old child.\n\nHe said the experts believe the child suspect is “very amenable” to rehabilitation.\n\nDAY 2 - COURTROOM UPDATES\n\nThe shooting suspect’s father testified during the hearing on Friday morning.\n\nWhen the suspect was 7 years old, the Department of Social Services got involved with the family due to a violent altercation between his mother and father. The suspect and his siblings also tested positive for drugs. They were placed in foster care for a time while the father completed parenting and anger management classes.\n\nWhen the boy was able to return home, he was happy, his father said. He said his son had a fascination with cars and loved to ride his dirt bike.\n\nHis son didn’t like school very much, especially starting in around 6th grade. The suspect told him he was having trouble at school, but wouldn’t go into detail. He talked about a social media page for “Tanglewood fights” and had mentioned fights taking place.\n\nHe testified that he never heard his son mention Jamari’s name before the shooting.\n\n“When he’d tell me something, he’d never give me names,” the father testified.\n\nIn the days leading up to the shooting, he noticed his son was coming home and going into his room and closing the door more often instead of going outside or working on cars. He said the 12-year-old told him about boys at school “messing with him” and someone was making neck-slicing motions at him in class.\n\nIn the weeks before the shooting, he talked to a guidance counselor at Tanglewood Middle School about his concerns.\n\nHe said afterward his son was labeled as a “snitch” by other kids at school. It made the situation worse.\n\nThe suspect talked to his dad about being called a snitch on March 28, 2022. Officials said they believe he took the gun from a family member two days before the shooting on March 29.\n\nHe said he doesn’t have knowledge of his son being an aggressor in the fights or a bully. He said when his son was previously accused of bullying, it was because of a joke he made.\n\nUnder cross-examination, he confirmed he had not seen any text messages where his son was called a snitch by someone else. The suspect called Jamari a snitch in the hours before the shooting.\n\nChild psychologist testified about how traumatic it was for the suspect being placed in foster care and separated from his siblings.\n\nHe talked to her about the day DSS picked him up from school. He thought he was getting an early dismissal and was excited, but then found out he had to go with strangers and couldn’t return home.\n\nShe said people who have experienced trauma have permanent changes to their amygdala, which is part of the brain for processing emotions.\n\nShe said he has an IQ in the low 80s. It doesn’t qualify him as having a learning disability but it is low.\n\nHe tends to keep to himself and struggles with being picked on by others, she said. She said this is due to his demeanor and the family’s financial struggles, which have made him more vulnerable to being picked on.\n\nShe said the behavior she has seen is congruent with what his father said. He bought rims for a car he was working on with his dad and was excited about this. He was more interested in family-centric activities than peer-centric activities.\n\n“For a 12-year-old, what looks like it’s planned may not be planned very well,” the psychologist testified.\n\nShe doesn’t think he wanted to hurt anyone but had never fired a gun and had no experience with one. She thinks his wiping off the bullets on the school bus, which prosecutors said showed an attempt to destroy evidence, could have been him trying to process what he was doing.\n\n“The adolescent brain is often thinking, ‘Oh my goodness, how did I get to this point?’,” she said.\n\nShe said he has the ability to show empathy and compassion. She said the interrogation video shows the compassion in the family since his father asked to hug him and was emotional.\n\nShe said he shows symptoms of ADHD and “PTSD-like” symptoms. He doesn’t have enough factors to meet the criteria for PTSD but he does have enough that would fall into an “other” category for conditions that can benefit from treatment.\n\nShe said she believes he has given genuine answers to her that show remorse and regret.\n\nThe suspect said if he had three wishes, one would be that he never committed the shooting, she testified.\n\nShe said she wouldn’t be testifying if she didn’t believe he could benefit from rehabilitation and she thinks being back with his family is critical to that. She believes he could be reintegrated into society and not become a career criminal.\n\nThe judge asked her to reconcile the fact that the suspect repeatedly had chances not to go through with the shooting. She cited the text messages from Jamari trying to delay or stop the conflict.\n\n“There’s another opportunity to stop this horrible train,” the judge said. “And yet he pushes it and pushes it and pushes it forward... Every crossroad, he pushed this train forward toward this horrible crime.”\n\nThe psychologist said he wanted bullying to end and now felt like involving adults only made things worse since he was called a snitch.\n\nDAY 1 - COURTROOM UPDATES\n\nThe school resource officer who called for help from the scene described hearing the gunshot and running to where Jamari was collapsed on the floor.\n\nGraphic video from a surveillance camera in the hallway of the school was played during the hearing. It shows students panic after the gun is fired before Jamari falls to the floor.\n\nMultiple students testified during the hearing about the relationship between the suspect and the victim. One student said the suspect showed her a gun in class before the shooting.\n\nAnother student was in class with Jamari right before the shooting. She said it appeared Jamari was arguing with someone via text, but she said she never saw fighting or bullying at Tanglewood.\n\nThe suspect’s younger cousin testified, saying the weekend before the shooting, the suspect threatened him and his mom. The suspect also reportedly said he had a gun and planned to “jump” one of their other cousins. The student’s mother called the suspect’s mother to discuss the issue.\n\nThe boy said he didn’t believe the suspect would shoot someone when they returned to school.\n\nA teen who was one of Jamari’s best friends testified and said he was unaware of any argument between Jamari and the suspect. He also didn’t know of any arranged fights between the two and never heard about Jamari getting into fights.\n\nA homicide investigator with the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office testified for more than an hour.\n\nDrone footage over Tanglewood Middle School was played in court. It shows law enforcement vehicles responding around the campus and a line of school buses to evacuate students. Drone footage was also captured of the neighborhood adjacent to Tanglewood where the suspect hid under a deck after the shooting.\n\nFootage captured on a neighbor’s doorbell camera was played that shows the suspect coming to the door after the shooting. The suspect tells the neighbor he is scared and needs to call his father.\n\n“Somebody shot somebody at school,” the suspect said.\n\nSirens can be heard in the background as law enforcement responds to the school. The investigator said the suspect would have been able to see the law enforcement presence from the neighbor’s porch.\n\n“Ma’am, I’m scared,” the suspect tells the neighbor as she tries to call his dad.\n\nAnother resident of the home asks over the doorbell camera, “Who did the shooting?”\n\nThe suspect doesn’t answer.\n\nThe investigator said a firearm was found under the deck when the suspect was arrested. They also searched the suspect’s backpack and found handwritten letters, which were introduced as exhibits in court.\n\n“Look at 12 I caught my first body,” one of the letters said. The investigator said he believes it indicates premeditation.\n\n“When I turned twelve I turnt to a demon,” another letter said.\n\nThey played infrared surveillance video from the school bus that the suspect had taken in the morning before the shooting. He can be seen opening his backpack where a gun is visible and wiping off a bullet with his sleeve.\n\nThe investigator testified that he believes it indicates the potential destruction of evidence.\n\nThey played footage from an interview with the suspect at the Greenville County Law Enforcement Center. His father was allowed in the room and hugs the boy while sobbing before deputies read the 12-year-old his Miranda rights.\n\nAfter reading his rights, both the suspect and his father agreed for him to talk to investigators.\n\nThe suspect told investigators he had been jumped in the bathroom at school and had problems with other kids at school. He had been in a feud with his cousins and his dad had contacted the school about concerns.\n\n“I’m not going to get beat up again,” the suspect told the deputy questioning him.\n\nHe admitted to firing one shot using a family member’s gun, but initially said he fired in the air.\n\nThe deputy asked him if he knew Jamari had been hit during the shooting. “He did?” the suspect asked, denying knowing he struck Jamari.\n\nThe 12-year-old said he had never fired a gun before, but had seen other students with guns at school.\n\n“Did you know that he didn’t make it,” the deputy asked the suspect. He said no.\n\nHis father was emotional throughout the interview, saying he should have communicated problems with other students to him.\n\nThe suspect said he was scared when he hid the gun under the deck of a nearby home and feared someone might be chasing after him.\n\nThe investigator testified that there were discrepancies between what the suspect told them and information they received from other students and extracted from his phone.\n\nMessages exchanged between Jamari and the suspect were shown in court.\n\nThe suspect texted Jamari the day before the shooting saying they had “beef.”\n\nText messages show the victim asked the suspect why he was scared to “fight with hands” and urged him to leave the firearm at home if they were to fight.\n\n“Like I said I’m not scared of you,” the suspect wrote in a text message. “I’m ready for war.”\n\n“Leave ye gun at home,” Jamari wrote back in a message.\n\n“Imma leave the rocket in fight you like a man,” the suspect said.\n\nThe investigator testified that the messages showed the boys planned to meet up in the bathroom during 6th period to fight.\n\nOn the day of the shooting, the pair exchanged dozens of messages with the suspect urging Jamari to confront him sooner than 6th period, but Jamari wouldn’t meet him.\n\n“Don’t let me catch you in the hallway,” the suspect wrote to Jamari, repeatedly urging him to come to the bathroom.\n\n“No point in getting kicked out of school to be cool,” Jamari wrote back.\n\n“We cool after,” the suspect wrote. “Yeah we cool,” Jamari responded.\n\nThe suspect also wrote messages including:\n\n“Your brains gonna be on the wall.”\n\n“You getting popped in school.”\n\n“Tell your parents good by.”\n\n“Delete our messages.”\n\nThe suspect’s last message was “Dead ***” at 12:18 p.m. Investigators said the shooting was within a couple of minutes of it being sent.\n\nThe defense requested the suspect be excused from the rest of the proceedings because he had not slept. The judge agreed with the request because she said it was visible he was suffering distress because of the proceedings and had already seen the majority of the evidence against him.\n\nThe defense called a clinical psychologist to testify on Thursday afternoon. She evaluated the suspect over the course of two days and spoke to his family members.\n\nThe suspect had 24 disciplinary referrals between 3rd and 7th grade. He also had several incidents in detention with fighting and inappropriate behavior. The psychologist testified that the suspect was the aggressor in some of the fights.\n\nShe said he scored low-average on some intellectual testing. She also testified that he would sometimes not recognize the impact of his behavior on others, but he did show understanding that his actions on March 31, 2022 had a greater impact on Jamari’s family than his own.\n\nShe testified that the suspect did not display strong indicators of planning or premeditation for criminal acts. She said he demonstrated some impulsivity and struggled to control his anger.\n\nShe classified him in the “low” range for criminal sophistication and dangerousness.\n\nThey read through multiple text conversations between the suspect and family members, telling them he felt paranoid and threatened by boys at school.\n\nMORE NEWS: Officers investigating after elderly woman carjacked in Williamston"
