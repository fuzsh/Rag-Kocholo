The situation could've been over quick if they had better tactical training, and we as a community witnessed it firsthand. I'm a gun owner and I do not blame the weapons used in this tragedy. I'm angry how easy it is to get one and young you can be to purchase one,\" he said.\n\nJacklyn's cousin, 10-year-old Annabell Rodriguez, was also killed in the massacre.\n\nMakenna Lee Elrod, 10\n\nThe family of 10-year-old Makenna described her as \"a light to all who knew her.\"\n\nThe little girl loved to play softball and practice gymnastics and also enjoyed singing and dancing.\n\nMORE: Boy who survived Texas school shooting recalls gunman saying 'you're all gonna die'\n\nShe was also a big fan of animals.\n\n\"Makenna made friends everywhere she went,\" said her aunt, Allison McCullough. \"She had brothers, sisters, and cousins who she loved to play with.
