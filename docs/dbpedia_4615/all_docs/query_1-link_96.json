        "text": "FLORENCE, Ky. (WXIX) - The four people and the suspect in the deadly early Saturday mass shooting have been identified.\n\nAn emotional Florence Police Chief Jeff Mallery released their names during a 1 p.m. press conference. He said the department had never dealt with anything of this magnitude and that they were still trying to process what happened overnight on Ridgecrest Drive.\n\nNeighbors react to mass shooting in Florence\n\nThe victims:\n\nDelaney Eary, 19 years old\n\nHayden Rybicki, 20 years old\n\nMelissa Parrett, 44 years old\n\nShane Miller, 20 years old\n\nThe suspect, who later died at St. Elizabeth from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, is 21-year-old Chase Garvey, Chief Mallery announced.\n\nThe shooting happened during a birthday for Parrett’s 21-year-old child at her home on Ridgecrest Drive in Florence, according to the chief.\n\nGarvey was not invited to the party, but did know those celebrating, Chief Mallery explained.\n\nThe 21-year-old shot seven people, four of whom died at the scene. The three surviving victims are expected to be okay.\n\nShortly before 3 a.m., officers arrived at the home after receiving multiple calls about an “active shooter,” the chief said Saturday.\n\n“When officers arrived, they could still hear gunshots,” Chief Mallory said. “They approached the residence and saw multiple victims. Partygoers told the police that the suspect had fled.”\n\nPolice say Garvey fled the scene, leading officers on a chase. Because Garvey was known to those at the birthday party, the chief said officers were given a description of his vehicle.\n\nThose officers saw multiple victims, including two in the front yard, he said.\n\n”We train on this, hoping it would never happen, but unfortunately, we’ve been touched like so many departments and cities,” Chief Mallery said of the officers who went to the Ridgecrest Drive home.\n\nBy that point, Garvey had left the mass shooting scene, according to the police chief.\n\nOfficers “quickly” found his vehicle near Farmview Drive and US-42, according to an earlier press release from police.\n\nGarvey did not stop, prompting a Florence officer and Boone County Sheriff’s Office deputy to pursue.\n\n“A Boone County deputy attempted to stop the vehicle,” Chief Mallory continued. “A pursuit ensued, traveling south on I-42 into Union, the suspect shot himself and crashed his vehicle.”\n\nHis car crashed into a ditch on Dale Heimbrock Way near Hicks Pike, police explained.\n\nGarvey was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital, where he died, according to police.\n\nIn the press conference Saturday, Chief Mallery stated that Garvey was a convicted felon with a history of sex crimes.\n\n“This is the first mass shooting in Florence, so it’s understandably emotional for everyone involved,” Mallery said.\n\nHis motive remains unknown as police continue their murder investigation.\n\nCall Florence police at 859-371-1234 if you have any information.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
