        "text": "HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- A teen and a child both died in a matter of minutes at a tragic scene in north Houston on Wednesday night, according to police.\n\nIt all happened after a group of children were reportedly playing with a gun around 8:20 p.m.\n\nInvestigators said the 11-year-old boy was pronounced dead at the scene. The 17-year-old who brought the gun to the home died at the hospital after shooting himself, according to HPD.\n\nPolice said the child relatives were gathered at an apartment complex at 6869 Arto Street near Hardy Street.\n\nHPD said it appears the gun was brought by the 17-year-old, who was likely showing it off.\n\nAccording to police, the 17-year-old placed the gun on a bed. Then, a 14-year-old girl picked it up and pulled the trigger, thinking it was unloaded. That's when the 11-year-old boy was shot and killed.\n\nInvestigators said the 17-year-old then grabbed the weapon and ran to a railroad behind the complex. Family members reportedly tried to talk to him because he was upset.\n\nOfficials said the teen fired a few shots. One of them hit the apartment complex, but nobody was hurt. Then, he turned the gun on himself.\n\nPolice said the 14-year-old girl was not hurt.\n\nThere are still many unanswered questions in the investigation, including details about the gun.\n\n\"As far as the weapon, we are not sure if the weapon was inside the home or if the individual was carrying the weapon himself. Again, we're conducting an investigation on that portion,\" Asst. Chief Keith Seafous said.\n\nHPD is reminding all gun owners to properly store and lock up their weapons in order to keep them out of the hands of children."
