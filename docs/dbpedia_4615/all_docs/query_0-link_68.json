        "text": "The fatal drive-by shooting of a 7-year-old Fayetteville boy in June prompted an event Tuesday to raise awareness for gun violence and potentially generate leads in the unsolved homicide.\n\nAs rains from Tropical Storm Debby doused the area and a large banner with a picture of little Zion Gibbs vowed, \"We will not forget,\" his mother, Myra Gibbs, spoke to community members gathered under tents near the family's Danish Drive home Tuesday. The event was organized by One Common Bond, a Hope Mills-based grief support group.\n\nA student at Benjamin Martin Elementary School, Zion died June 10 at UNC Medical Center in Chapel Hill three days after being struck multiple times by bullets that pierced the walls of his home. He had just begun his summer vacation after completing the first grade.\n\n\"I've been crying everyday ... I'm hurt. I'm trying to go through the healing process. I've accepted the fact that I'm not going to be fully healed, but I'm also accepting the fact that there will come a time when I'm able to cope just a little bit better,\" Myra Gibbs said. \"You never would have told me that about 68 days ago this house would have been shot up the way it was.\"\n\nGibbs, a Cumberland County 911 dispatcher, thanked the community for its support but also urged people to take action against gun violence.\n\n\"People say it takes a village to raise children. It takes a community to keep them safe,\" Gibbs said, wearing a T-shirt with her son's photo on it. \"You have to speak up. If you know something say something.\"\n\nFayetteville Police Chief Kemberle Braden also spoke, using his time to encourage people to come forward with information.\n\nRelated: Fayetteville 7-year-old dies after someone fired shots into the house he was in early Friday\n\n\"It's a tragedy that the Fayetteville Police Department is still working to solve,\" he said. \"I'm putting the word out —anyone that has any information please come forward …We need the community's cooperation if we're going to end gun violence in the city of Fayetteville.\"\n\nOn Friday, police released still images and video of a four-door grey or dark grey Chrysler 200 believed to be involved in the shooting. The vehicle has a white sticker on the rear driver's side window, 30-day temporary paper tags and a dent or minor damage on the driver's side between the front and rear door, police said.\n\nKimberly Franco, founder of One Common Bond, encouraged people to speak up if they have any information.\n\n\"There's no greater strength you can have than being that one that says, 'I know something and I'm going to say something,'\" she said, her voice wavering. \"Zion loved superheroes. You would be his hero if you step up and say something.\n\n\"Because not only would you be helping him, you would be helping Myra and her beautiful family to finally be able to breathe.\"\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Detective C. Crews at 910-751-1046. Anonymous tips can also be made by calling Crimestoppers at 910-483- 8477, visiting fay-nccrimestoppers.org and completing the anonymous online tip sheet or by downloading the free “P3 Tips” app in the Apple App Store or Google Play for Android devices.\n\nPublic safety reporter Joseph Pierre can be reached at jpierre@gannett.com."
