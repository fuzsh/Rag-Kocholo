        "text": "A tragic shooting resulted in the deaths of two juveniles on Wednesday night in northeast Houston.\n\nThe incident began around 8:21 p.m. when Houston Police Department (HPD) units responded to reports of a shooting at Timber Crossing Apartments, located at 6869 Arto Street.\n\nFOX 26 Houston is now on the FOX LOCAL app available through Apple TV, Amazon FireTV, Roku and Google Android TV!\n\nUpon arrival, officers discovered an 11-year-old boy with a gunshot wound inside an apartment. He was pronounced dead at the scene by Houston Fire Department (HFD). Outside, near a wooded area, a 17-year-old male was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was transported to the hospital but was pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nInvestigations revealed that four family members, aged 10 to 17, were inside the apartment during the incident.\n\nThe 17-year-old had initially pulled out a firearm, possibly to show it off. A 14-year-old girl picked up the weapon and accidentally shot it, hitting the 11-year-old. The 17-year-old, distraught, ran to a wooded area, official say. Despite attempts by family members to calm him, he fired additional rounds, striking an apartment but causing no injuries, before taking his own life.'\n\nDOWNLOAD THE FOX 26 HOUSTON APP BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe investigation into the circumstances is ongoing."
