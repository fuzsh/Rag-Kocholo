        "text": "The families of the 19 children and two teachers who were murdered at Robb Elementary in Uvalde have waited to hear from the former school district police chief.\n\nFormer Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo sat down for an exclusive CNN interview, talking about the Robb Elementary school tragedy back in May 2022.\n\nWith his attorney by his side, Arredondo said he's been \"scapegoated from the very beginning.\"\n\nWATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW\n\nMore than one month after being booked on 10 counts of child endangerment, Arredondo reflects on his actions on that fateful day.\n\nThese are my children too and people understand that,\" he said. \"You know we went down the hallways every day and stressed about keeping doors locked, stressed about being vigilant and the less I see of those, I don't have to, the better for me.\n\nArredondo was the on-site commander of the nearly 400 law enforcement officers who responded when an 18-year-old gunman opened fire in the fourth-grade classroom.\n\nHe was also asked the looming questions \"Why didn't officers go into the classroom sooner?\" and \"why didn't they focus on the shooter until he was taken out?\"\n\nYou'll likely remember, he and other police waited 77 minutes to confront the gunman.\n\nIf you look at the bodycam footage, there was no hesitation,\" he said. \"And myself and the first handful of officers that went in there went straight to the hot zone as you may call it and took fire. At that point, we worked with what we had. Right. You can't see through it, first of all, uh so when we were shot at and we backed off to say, OK, now we know where he's at because we don't, we didn't know where he was at. That's when that's when we took fire and backed out and realized, ok, now we need to come up with a plan to get back up there.\n\nBut that's not what the body cam footage suggests. What it shows is that Arredondo knew there were likely victims in the room with the gunman and he ordered his subordinates to stay back in the hallways.\n\n\"As soon as they clear this room, I’m going to verify what’s been vacated, guys, before we do any kind of breaching,\" said Arredondo. \"Time is on our side right now. I know we probably have kids in there but we’ve got to save the lives of the other ones.”\n\nEd Lavandera: \"In that moment when lives were at stake, why did you think time was on your side?\"\n\nArredondo: \"I don't recall making that statement. I'm sorry, there's some things that you don't recall while you're in the hallway.\"\n\nArredondo now claims there were state police officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety who should have taken control of the scene, but he still maintains his tune of doing his best to save as many as they could after the ordeal had already happened.\n\nI know we did the best we could with what we had and by running into that building and not leaving there, and doing what we could or doing what I could and what the other officers could,\" he said. \"It was the best we could with the situation we had and information we had.\n\nThe CNN reporter wanted Arredondo to watch a couple of video clips of the incident to get his perspective, however, he didn't want to look at the video.\n\nArredondo pleaded not guilty to the child endangerment charges against him. He and ex-Uvalde CISD officer Adrian Gonzales are the first two people charged in connection with the deadly shooting.\n\nHe and his attorney were asked if they will request a change of venue in his upcoming trial. They said they are inclined to keep it in Uvalde. They say they want the public to hear what Arredondo has to say."
