        "text": "PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Philadelphia police have released the name of the man who was found shot to death inside an SUV on the Roosevelt Boulevard on Wednesday.\n\nTwenty-five-year-old William Torres-Espinal, of Oxford Circle, was found dead in the northbound lanes of the Boulevard in Hunting Park.\n\nPolice were called to the scene for a car crash, but when they arrived they found Torres-Espinal with a gunshot wound to his back.\n\nPolice believe two bullets went through the rear window, with one hitting him. Investigators do not yet know where the bullets came from.\n\nThe SUV had been traveling in the northbound inner lanes when it hit the back of a minivan and then came to rest on the median.\n\nPolice sources say they recovered a gun registered to Torres-Espinal inside the vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\n\"He was the most loving person I knew,\" said the victim's brother, Geudy Torres. \"The most precious soul I've known. I always wanted to be just like him in my life.\"\n\nFamily members remain in disbelief and distress after the shooting.\n\n\"He was a good boy. They break my heart,\" said Torres-Espinal's uncle, Romann Torres.\n\n\"He just wanted to have a good life and be at least successful enough to have a family with his wife,\" added Geudy Torres.\n\nTorres-Espinal was traveling home from his job at Bimbo Bakeries USA when he was killed.\n\n\"We were devasted to learn of the death of one of our associates, who was a reliable and valued member of our team. Our hearts go out to William's family and friends,\" said the company in a statement.\n\nLoved ones hope police can quickly piece together what happened and take the suspect into custody.\n\n\"He can pay in jail for killing my good nephew,\" said Torres.\n\nThis was one of four homicides in the city on Wednesday.\n\nIn North Philadelphia, around 8 a.m., a 32-year-old man was shot three times on Girard Avenue near North 12th Street.\n\nYou could see the crime scene unit gathering evidence near the Popeye's restaurant. The victim died at the hospital.\n\nThen, around 1:20 p.m. in West Philadelphia, a 25-year-old man was fatally shot on North 54th Street by Peach Street.\n\nShortly after 9:30 p.m., there was another fatal shooting in North Philadelphia, this time on Park Avenue and Rush Street. Philadelphia police real-time crime cameras did capture the incident.\n\n\"You see a dark color vehicle traveling south on Park Avenue. A passenger gets out, walks up to the victim, and fires at least one shot and that's when the victim collapses,\" said Chief Inspector Scott Small.\n\nThis outbreak of violence comes as the murder rate in Philadelphia has been trending down significantly this year.\n\nWe checked the data and found homicides in the city have decreased by 37 percent, compared to this time last year.\n\nThere have been 161 homicides year-to-date, which is actually the lowest tally of homicides at this point in the year dating back to 2015."
