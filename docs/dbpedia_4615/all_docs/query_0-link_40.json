        "text": "A 16-year-old boy has been charged with shooting three people in Waukegan and leading police on a pursuit that ended in a manhunt last week, police announced.\n\nThe shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. on July 29 in the area of 10th Street between Adams Street and Wadsworth Avenue in Waukegan on the border of North Chicago.\n\nThree people were shot, with all victims believed to have been wounded in their legs, according to Waukegan Deputy Police Chief Scott Chastain.\n\nA large police presence was reported and officers had the scene cordoned off with crime scene tape.\n\nChastain said the injured victims were transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nOfficers initiated a police pursuit of a black Mercedes, wanted in connection with the shooting, around 2:15 a.m. on July 30.\n\nThe Mercedes nearly rammed a squad car and refused to stop for officers.\n\nThe pursuit came to an end north of the intersection of McAree Road and Washington Street in Waukegan a short time later.\n\nA manhunt search ensued for the suspects with the help of additional police departments, canine units and drones.\n\nThe Gurnee Police Department, North Chicago Police Department and Lake County Sheriffâ€™s Office assisted Waukegan police.\n\nTwo juveniles were taken into custody, Chastain said.\n\nA perimeter was established and a third suspect remained on the run after officers called off the search just before 4 a.m. on July 30.\n\nA tow truck was called to remove the Mercedes from the scene.\n\nChastain said Thursday that the driver of the Mercedes, which was stolen, had been charged in connection with the shooting and pursuit.\n\nThe 16-year-old boy, who is from Honduras and was recently residing in Waukegan, was charged with three counts of aggravated battery with a firearm, aggravated fleeing and eluding, possession of a stolen vehicle and resisting a peace officer.\n\nChastain said the boy was transported to juvenile detention but the police department does not know his current custody status in the facility.\n\nThe second subject who was arrested after the pursuit was released without charges. The third subject who escaped from officers remains wanted."
