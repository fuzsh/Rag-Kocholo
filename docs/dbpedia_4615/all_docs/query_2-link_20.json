        "text": "The authorities in Kansas City, Mo., said on Thursday that they were keeping two teenagers in custody after a shooting that tore through the city’s Super Bowl celebration, killing one person and wounding nearly two dozen others in what appeared to be the result of an argument.\n\nStacey Graves, the city’s police chief, said at least 22 people were wounded in the shooting on Wednesday, in addition to the person who died, and that the victims ranged in age from 8 to 47 years old. At least half of the wounded were younger than 16.\n\nThe police said they had initially taken three young people into custody but released one of them after determining that the person was not involved. A police spokeswoman, Alayna Gonzalez, said on Thursday night that investigators were working with juvenile court prosecutors to “determine applicable charges” against the two teenagers.\n\nThe person who died was identified as Elizabeth Galvan, 43, a local D.J. who was also known as Lisa Lopez-Galvan. A friend described her as a passionate fan of the city’s football team who was deeply involved in civic events and hosted a radio show.\n\nThe police chief said there was no indication that the shooters were motivated by terrorism or extremism, saying instead that the deadly gunfire appeared to have stemmed from some kind of conflict between several people.\n\n“I’m angered about what occurred in our city yesterday,” Chief Graves said.\n\nThe shooting erupted as thousands of football fans had crowded into downtown Kansas City after the Chiefs’ Super Bowl win, suddenly turning a day of revelry into one of chaos and panic. As shots rang out, people ran for cover.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
