        "text": "A series of celebrities, including rapper 50 Cent and singer Kid Rock, took to social media in reaction to the attempted assassination of former President Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe former president on Saturday said he was hit in the ear by a bullet while speaking at a rally in Butler, Pa. One rally attendee was killed, as was the suspected shooter, whom the FBI identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pa.\n\nTwo other spectators were critically injured, the Secret Service said.\n\nKid Rock, who has become a vocal figure for the far-right movement, posted a video to Instagram on Saturday, wearing a “White Boy of the Year” baseball cap.\n\n“You f— with Trump, you f— with me,” the singer said.\n\n50 Cent posted a photo Saturday on the social platform X of his studio album, “Get Rich or Die Tryin,” with Trump’s head edited onto the rapper’s body.\n\n“Trump gets shot and now I’m trending [shoulder shrug emoji],” the rapper wrote above the photo.\n\nIn an earlier post by the rapper that has since been deleted, 50 Cent posted a photo showing the moment Trump raised his fist in the air moments after he was grazed and bloodied by a bullet. The rapper attached his song, “Many Men (Wish Death),” and wrote, “I know the vibes…we are all in trouble now!”\n\nThe lyrics of the song include, “Many men wish death upon me. Blood in my eye.” It was not immediately clear why the post was deleted.\n\nCountry singer Scotty McCreery said Saturday he was praying for the country, while singer Dave Matthews reacted on stage at a show in Virginia.\n\n“That’s no way to behave. My condolences to the family of the people who were hurt, but good grief man, that’s no way to run a democracy, that’s no way to be part of a democracy,” he said, according to a video by a user on X.\n\nJohn Rich, from the musical duo Big & Rich, posted the viral photo of Trump with his fist in the air, with the caption, “They couldn’t beat him in a fair contest, so they tried to kill him. BUT THEY MISSED.”\n\nIn a different post, Rich posted a video from the rally, during which Trump said “fight” moments after the shooting occurred, and captioned it, “BRING. IT. ON.”\n\nRapper Soulja Boy reposted a video of the shooting and wrote, “Ain’t no way they just shot at trump [mind-blown emoji].”\n\nTrump on Sunday thanked the nation for its concern over the attempt on his life and called on Americans to unite.\n\nLater in the day, he said he would travel to Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention.\n\n“Based on yesterday’s terrible events, I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin, and The Republican National Convention, by two days, but have just decided that I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Therefore, I will be leaving for Milwaukee, as scheduled, at 3:30 P.M. TODAY. Thank you!”"
