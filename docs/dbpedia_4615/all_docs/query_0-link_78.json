        "text": "SOUTH BEND, Ind. (WNDU) - Police have identified the boy who was killed in a shooting on South Bend’s south side on Friday night as 16-year-old Alyyus Enoexpettiford.\n\nHe was a student at Riley High School.\n\n“During this incredibly difficult time, our thoughts and prayers are with Alyyus Enoexpettiford’s family and friends,” said Principal Shawn Henderson in a letter to the Riley High School community.\n\nOfficers were called around 5:45 p.m. to the 500 block of E. Victoria Street. When they arrived, they found Enoexpettiford suffering from a gunshot wound. He was taken to the hospital, where he died from his injuries.\n\nThere is no suspect information available at this time, but police say there is no threat to the public.\n\nThe South Bend Police Department’s Violent Crimes Unit is handling the investigation. If you have any information on this shooting, you’re asked to call Michiana Crime Stoppers at 574-288-STOP (7867) to leave an anonymous tip. You can also submit a tip online.\n\nMeanwhile, a candlelight vigil will be held in Enoexpettiford’s memory on Monday night. It’s taking place at the intersection of Victoria Street and Rush Street at 5:30 p.m. Organizers ask you to bring a candle, a friend, and a heart full of love if you plan to attend.\n\nStay up to date on local news with WNDU on-air and online.
