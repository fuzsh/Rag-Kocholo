        "text": "Editor's note: Follow here for Thursday updates on the Mount Horeb shooting.\n\nPolice in Wisconsin shot and killed a boy who was armed with a weapon outside of a middle school late Wednesday morning, law-enforcement officials said.\n\nThe armed boy was a student in the Mount Horeb School District, Josh Kaul, state attorney general confirmed at an afternoon press briefing. The boy was shot and killed by officers outside before he could make his way inside the school, Kaul said.\n\n\"For a period of time today there was concern that there was an ongoing threat related to this incident. We currently believe that there is no ongoing threat to public safety. But again, this is an ongoing investigation, and we will update the public if any additional threat to safety is discovered,\" Kaul said.\n\nThe shooting in the community about 20 miles west of Madison was reported a little after 11:15 a.m. local time when Mount Horeb Area School District Superintendent Dr. Steve Salerno said in a social post: \"The threat has been neutralized outside of the building. Law-enforcement is circulating throughout the middle school to confirm the safety of all students.\"\n\nKaul said officers responded to a report of \"an individual with a weapon\" outside the middle school and used \"deadly force\" to neutralize the threat posed. Kaul confirmed that no students or school staff were injured, stating that the reunification process between parents and students would continue through Wednesday night.\n\nHe declined to release any specific information on the student involved or the weapon, stating that it is an \"ongoing investigation.\"\n\n'The safety of students and school staff is our number one priority'\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice will be leading the investigation, receiving additional assistance from the agency's Office of School Safety.\n\n\"The safety of students and school staff is our number one priority. We want to thank the parents and community members of Mount Horeb for their patience as this process took place to ensure the safety of students and school staff,\" Kaul said.\n\nSalerno echoed the statements made by Kaul, complimenting \"amazing staff that have rallied in support of our beautiful children. And the community, that envelops and holds their children and their schools in high esteem. We, of course, lift our prayers to all who have been impacted by today's events.\"\n\nKaul recommended that parents and caregivers \"restore a sense of safety\" by providing reassurance, and safe environment to ask to questions/verbalize their feelings. As well as keeping media exposure to these \"upsetting events\" limited.\n\n\"And we encourage you to contact your local school staff, if you have any specific concerns about your child. School violence prevention is a shared responsibility. And if you have concerns that somebody may be planning an act of school violence, we urge you to report the concern,\" Kaul said.\n\nMount Horeb School District to 'take a beat,' schools open to those who need it\n\nMount Horeb School District schools will be open Thursday to any and all students and staff that need support, with Salerno adding that he thinks it's best for everyone to \"take a beat, take a rest\" after the day they've had.\n\n\"It is our hope that based upon the tone and tenor of those visits...that we can bring students and staff back on Friday,\" Salerno said. \"We'll have a decision on that some point here in the near future. But at this point, we are ready to roll up our sleeves and work shoulder to shoulder with our amazing law enforcement, first responders who came to help support and protect our young people.\"\n\nThe district hopes to begin the process of engaging with parents and community about questions they might have about school safety.\n\nSalerno also noted the community's support for capital referendums that helped install safety measures at schools around the district.\n\n\"This could have been a far worse tragedy,\" the superintendent said. \"We're beyond grateful for the community's support of our beautiful children and our loving staff.\"\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.
