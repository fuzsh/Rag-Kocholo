        "text": "On November 30th, 2021 is the day that has forever changed my life. It burns into my body like a cigarette burn, enough to scar, but always a constant reminder. The day I found out that my daughterâ€™s life was taken, a life that was still so young and full of life. After that day, she became a statistic, a victim, a planned act of tragedy. I remember hearing a squish sound against my right ear, and it was the sound of carpet mixed with blood going into my ear. I started yelling for help. But when I say yelling, I mean a shout that was loud enough for someone around me to hear, yet quiet enough for the shooter not to hear me. No one ever came. There can be no forgiveness. There can be no rehabilitation. There is absolutely nothing that the defendant can ever do to earn my forgiveness. His age plays no part. His potential is irrelevant. Ultimately, it is only his choices and his actions that matter."
