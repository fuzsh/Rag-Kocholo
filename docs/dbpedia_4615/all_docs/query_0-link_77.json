        "text": "Gunfire erupted in a neighborhood on the Haltom City-Fort Worth border Wednesday when Tarrant County sheriff’s deputies tried to serve a warrant to a child sex suspect.\n\nA Tarrant County deputy who was shot is back home and recovering after the suspect shot him three times.\n\nOfficers Met With Gunfire\n\nIt all began around noon when Tarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn says deputies were serving three warrants for a 40-year-old man wanted for the sexual assault of a child, indecency with a child and unlawful restraint of someone younger than 17.\n\nAs the deputies approached the home on Elinor Street, they were shot at by the suspect. Deputy Todd Tipton was hit three times and rushed to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\n\"We have a Tarrant County sheriff’s deputy who’s been injured because of a violent, sick, twisted criminal, someone who wanted to try and take out some officers today, but thankfully he wasn’t successful,\" said Fort Worth Police Chief Neil Noakes.\n\nAfter the gunfire, police backups arrived, and the man barricaded himself inside the home.\n\nSWAT teams from the sheriff’s office and Fort Worth Police Department were called in. At one point, he told police he had hostages.\n\nPolice say the suspect also shot at the Fort Worth officers, and the officers fired back. None of them were hit by bullets.\n\nAs SWAT officers entered the home, smoke could be seen coming from the windows. It’s still unclear why. The fire department says that’s still under investigation.\n\nSeveral SWAT officers were injured by glass when they entered the home, and they were treated on scene.\n\nOnce officers cleared the house, no one else was found inside.\n\nThe wanted child sex suspect died from a gunshot wound. Police are still determining whether it was self-inflicted or from an officer.\n\nThe name of the suspect has not been released. Neighbors say it wasn’t the first time they saw police at his home.\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department’s major case unit is now leading the investigation.\n\nThe Injured Deputy\n\nAfter the shooting, Deputy Todd Tipton was rushed to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.\n\nDoctors quickly evaluated him and realized he didn’t need surgery.\n\nSheriff Waybourn says he was relieved after Tipton was able to leave JPS just hours after being shot in the line of duty.\n\n\"I just thank God we were a quarter inch off of it, that he is going to be fine. It is miraculous,\" the sheriff said.\n\nWaybourn says Tipton is a 13-year veteran deputy and an experienced fugitive officer and SWAT operator.\n\nNone of Tipton’s wounds were life-threatening. Therefore, no immediate surgery was needed.\n\n\"He has performed magnificently,\" Waybourn said. \"He has been decorated and awarded. He is a quiet guy in the corner who does his job every day and does it well.\"\n\nTipton was hit three times in what Sheriff Waybourn called a close combat fight.\n\n\"We don’t know what caliber the weapon is,\" the sheriff said. \"But in the back of the neck and the arm and the back. The miraculous thing is it missed everything, every vital organ.\"\n\nWaybourn was able to speak to Tipton in his hospital room before he was discharged to go home.\n\n\"He is in great spirits. He has family with him. Everybody is good. They’re visiting, and, again, he’s in great spirits and doing great.\"\n\nThe sheriff says Tipton executes warrants daily and is a rockstar officer.\n\nTipton is resting at home and is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nNeighbors Evacuated\n\nWhile working on a tire at Brother’s Tire Shop, Emmanuel Camacho heard something that made him stop.\n\n\"I heard a bunch of sirens, so I came to the front wondering what had happened,\" he recalled.\n\nCamacho’s curiosity led him to peek behind the fence, and he started recording the scene.\n\n\"Just saw lots of people running in, lots of reinforcement pull up. We saw the SWAT afterward coming in,\" he said.\n\nDuring the standoff, the nearby neighborhood was evacuated.\n\nRudolph Garza says he wasn’t home but got a call from his daughter. He then checked his security footage and saw what was happening near his house.\n\n\"I opened it up, and, sure enough, there were officers up and down my street,\" he recalled.\n\nFortunately, none of the neighbors were injured."
