A 17-year-old boy was fatally shot in a home at the corner 11th and South streets Sunday afternoon.

The teen, whose name hasn't been released, was shot multiple times, said Springfield Police Deputy Chief Sara Pickford Monday morning.

The teen was taken to HSHS St. Johnâ€™s Hospital by ambulance for treatment but did not survive.

It is the sixth homicide in Springfield for 2024.

Pickford said she believed the teen lived at the home. There were multiple people inside of the home at the time of the shooting.

Pickford said detectives "are running a lot of things down" regarding a suspect. There have been Crime Stoppers tips about the shooting already, she said.

The call, she said, came in to 911.

Pickford said it was too early to speculate on a motive.

Anyone with information about this shooting is asked to call the Springfield Police at 217-788-8311 and/or Sangamon/Menard County Crime Stoppers at 217-788-8427.
