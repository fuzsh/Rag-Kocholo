(See division of his Estate.)\n\nSource: History of Perquimans County by Ellen Goode Rawlings Winslow, (1931).\n\nWOOD\n\nThe earliest emigrant by the name of Wood, was John, who came from London to Isle of Wight Co, in “Bonadventure” Jan 1634, age 26. He married in said Co, Margaret — & had, according to the Quaker Reg of Lower Mo Meeting, Nansemond Co Va, one dau: Elizabeth, b 27, 7mo, 1658. He died soon after this date, and we find his widow married to Thomas Taberer of same Co, by whom she had issue: 1 Christian, b — 9mo 1661—2 Elizabeth b — 10mo 1663. From the fact that there was a second dau Elizabeth, one would naturally suppose that John Wood’s dau Elizabeth did not long outlive her father.\n\nWilliam Wood came to Va in “Hopewell” Sept 1635, age 27, Elizabeth, age 24, & Jo Wood, age 26. Another Wm Wood was trans’ to Rapp Co Va, July 29, 1650, by Robert Bird. Edward Wood was Trans’ to Norfolk Co Va, by John Ashcomb, who was granted 829a of land, “on Langleys Creek, upper Norfolk Co,” for transporting emigrants; Mar 6, 1683. With this Edward Wood we are directly concerned, because his descendants moved to Chowan Co N. C. From Chowan they drifted over into Perquimans. John Wood took up land in Nansemond Co Va, Apl 25, 1667. Whose son he was is not made manifest, but we find in Berkeley Par Reg Perq Co, “Mr John Woode, minister of gospell” performing the rites of matrimony in Perq, as early as June 13, 167—, when he officiated at the marriage of Alex Lillington on that date, and he also married Mr. Wm Therrell, to Mrs. Jean Godfrey, Dec 2, 1676. He is not mentioned as one of the ministers sent out from England by S. P. G., and may very probably be an itinerant, coming down from Va for special occasions. A natural procedure, considering the fact that N. C. for some time after this continued to be a part of Va. If they sent us governors, why would they not also send ministers, to look after the soul’s welfare?\n\nThere were two distinct families of Woods, in Albemarle, and it is thought that those who settled near Woodville, on Little River, may perhaps be descendants of this earlier branch, but no actual proof has been found. The Woods of Perq, like those of Chowan adhered to the Church of England, proof of which can be found in Berkeley Par Reg, from the fact that William Wood, next found on the record, was married to Deborah Sutton (d of George) May 8, 1718, “by Dr. Urmstone (John) minister of the Church of England.” George Sutton however was a strong Quaker, and it seems probable that her family carried over Wm Wood, as we later find the name on the Records of Friends. George Sutton in his will Perq, p Mar 11, 1699, bequeathed to his dau Deborah a “Plantation at the hickory.” There is to this day in Perq a place called by that name, on the highway leading to Elizabeth City. William Wood, & wife Deborah had issue: 1 Richard, b Oct 30, 1720—2 Sarah, b Oct 23, 1721, d Mch 21, 1722/3—3 William (2) b Sept 3, 1722/3—4 George, b Sept 2, 1724—5 Deborah, b Mar 25, 1725/6—6 Rebecca, b June 3, 1727—7 Elizabeth, b Dec 18, 1728. Deborah Wood died same day. (A case of too much child bearing.) Sarah Wood died Mch 17, 1722/3. (See Sutton family, this book.)\n\nWilliam Wood dec’d Dec 1, 1769, Mary Wood Admix, before Seth Sumner, J. P., Mary Wood petitioned the Court Oct 17, 1769, for leave “to sell perishable Estate of her dec’d husband William Wood.” (Loose papers.)\n\nWood, Richard (1) William (1) m Hannah Lowry, 19, 10mo 1746, issue: 1 Tamer, b 21, 9mo 1747—2 Winnefred, b 29, 3mo 1749—3 William (3) b 12, 11mo 1750—4 Rhoda, b 23, 1mo 1753—5 Benjamin, b 16, 4mo 1756—6 Samuel, b 29, 11mo 1758, d 13, 11mo 1782—Rachel, b 3, 1mo 1761.\n\n(2) Wood, William (2) William (1) m Mary —. Issue: 1 Deborah, b 25, 1mo 1764—2 Rebeckah, b 29, 5mo 1765—3 William, b 4, 10mo 1766.\n\n(2) Wood, Richard, m Sarah Morris, “at Simons Creek” 20 8mo 1764. (d of Aaron.)\n\nWood, Richard, m Cynthia Lassiter, Aug 21, 1800. (Chowan Co marriage bonds.)\n\nRecords of Norfolk Co give the fact “that Wm Wood hath departed this country,” Oct 5, 1687. From this line are descended Mr John Q. A. Wood of Elizabeth City, & his brother George dec’d. The first for years Clerk of Perquimans county. Mr Wood has always been a fine citizen, and his family highly respected.\n\nJohn Wood who appears as Clerk of Perq for so many years, probably came to the Co from Chowan. He m Miss Wingfield, and had son Charles Wingfield Wood of Perq Co, who lived at Woodlawn, an old home on the outskirts of Hertford, acquired by his father from Joseph Cannon. Charles W. Wood m Mary (Mollie) Skinner, (d of Benjamin Skinner, and wife Elizabeth Leigh (d of James Leigh, of Durants Neck) and had issue: 1 John, died an infant.—2 Elizabeth (Bettie) m Mr W. G. Gaither issue: a number of children, all married but two. 3 Mary Wood, m T. F. Winslow of Hertford, issue: 1 Mae Wood, single—2 Katherine Blount, m W. H. Hudson, and had one daughter Mary Tudor—3 Francis E. Winslow, m Nemmie Parish of Rocky Mt N. C., where they reside, issue three girls, and one son. He is a prominent Lawyer of said place, and stands high in his profession. 4 Elizabeth Blount, m Thomas Wilcox of Norfolk Va, issue three children.\n\nMr. W. G. Gaither and wife Elizabeth Wood, had issue: 1 Charles W. Gaither, m Lula Hayes, and issue a son and daughter—2 Helen (unmarried)—3 Elizabeth, m Edward Conger of Elizabeth City, N. C. (no issue)—4 Sarah, m C. Burnett Lewis, issue one son—5 William G. Gaither, m Helen Robinson (d of Charles, & Mary Leigh) issue three children—6 Rev Wood Gaither (Episcopal minister) m Penelope Weddell of Tarboro N. C. issue four children—7 Mary, m William Van Eberstein, of Washington, N. C., no issue—8 Nettie Martin, m Wallace Huffines of Rocky Mount, N. C., no issue—9 Louise, unmarried.\n\nEDWARD WOOD LINE\n\nAs we have already seen, Edward Wood came to Norfolk Co Va Mar 6 1683. In an affidavit made Jan 1680/1, he gave his age as 38. He was living in Upper Parish Nansemond Co Va, July 18, 1715. Of course he could not be the same, who made his will in Chowan Co, Aug 9, 1691, naming wife Alice, to whom he left “Land at Yawpim.” We have to depend for descent from two brothers, Edward, & John Wood, who made a joint deed in Norfolk Co Va, Nov 1, 1721, as follows: Edward Wood, & Mary his wife, John Wood, & Margarett his wife, of Chowan Co N. C. sold unto Thos. Freeman, & Sarah his wife of Norfolk Co, 100a “where said Edward, & John formerly dwelt” adj land of Thos. Cottell, “for the yearly Rent of one ear of Indian Corne.” Test’ Tho. Hobgood, Tho. Collett. Another deed same Co, 100a in Elizabeth Parish, Co of Norfolk, “where Edward Wood formerly dwelt,” on Spring Mills Creek, adj John Eastwood, Robert Collett, & Edward Wingate. Recorded Dec 1721.\n\nWood, James, of Perq (connection not apparent) will p Feby 1822, names dau’s: Nancy & Sally Wood, gr-daus: Susan, & Sally Norcom (dau’s of Betsy dec’d). Sons: Edward, Richard, & James (who moved to Tyrrell Co) sons William, & Edward Exrs. Test’ Thomas D. Martin, Mary M. Martin.\n\nWood, William (1) James (1) will Perq, p Nov 1824, Wife Ann, sons: William E. Wood, Edward Wood, dau’s: Elizabeth, & Lucy Ann Wood.\n\nWood, Edward, (1) James (1) will Perq, p May 1827, names wife Elizabeth, & children (who are unnamed) but his sister Ann in her will, p Feby 1830, gives the names of his children, thus: “Little Edward Wood, son of brother Edward, and James, & William Wood sons of same; she also names niece, Elizabeth S. Hall (d of brother William) sister Sarah, nieces Sarah, & Susan Norcom, sister-in-law Elizabeth Wood (widow of Edward) brother John E. Wood.\n\nWood, John, was Clerk of Perq 1808.\n\nFrom this line descended Mr. Charles Wingfield Wood, who made his lifelong home in a lovely old place near Hertford, which was only a few years ago destroyed by fire. He has descendants living at the present time in Hertford, Elizabeth City, Rocky Mount, and other points in N. C. This family has from time immemorial stood high in the community, & has sent out into the world many fine representative people.\n\nMARRIAGES\n\nWood, Samuel, m dau of Robert Smith, prior to May 1, 1693. (Legal papers.)\n\nWood, Thomas, m Anna Bailey, June 3, 1778. (Mar bonds Pasq Co.)\n\nWood, William, m Elizabeth Guy, Aug 18, 1804.\n\nWood, Evan, m Margaret Barber, Jan 4, 1786.\n\nWood, Elizabeth (d of John Davis of Pasq Co) named in his will, p Apl 1753.\n\nSource: History of Perquimans County by Ellen Goode Rawlings Winslow, (1931).\n\nWINSLOW\n\nFor the convenience of those not acquainted with the record, and where the ones needed are to be found, the following is here printed, taken from Winslow Memorial, Vol I, Chart V.\n\nJohn Winslow, m Agnes (d of John Thogmorton Esq) of Kemsey 1400-20, was father of Kenelm above, issue: Edward, of Kempsey, & Droitwich, Co Worcester, England, b Oct 18, 1575, d May 8, 1655, in Parish of St Andrews, who had issue by 2d wife Magdaline Olliver: 1 Edward, b Oct 19, 1595 (1st Gov of Mass) 2 John, b April 16, 1597, d 1674, age 78, m Oct 12, 1624 Mary Chilton (d of James, who came over in the Mayflower). Her will July 24, 1676.\n\nJohn Winslow came to New England in the “Fortune” Nov 3, 1621, settled in Plymouth, Mass, and moved to Boston 1656. He was a prominent merchant, and large ship-builder. He had by wife Mary (Chilton), 1 Elizabeth, 2 John, who died 1731, m Abigail Atkinson (d of Theodore) June 18, 1689, issue: 1 Elizabeth, b April 23, 1692—2 John, b Dec 31, 1693, m Sarah Pierce Sept 21, 1721, died Oct 15, 1731—3 Judith, 4 Joseph (age not given) m Sarah Lawrence (d of Major Thomas Lawrence of New Town L. I.) Living in Perq Co N. C. 1677-79, where he served as “foreman of the Petit Jury” when acting Gov Thomas Miller was tried for treason, between the said dates. He is called in the Col Records of N. C. “another New England Traider.” The question naturally arises in the mind of any thinking person; would it not be the usual custom for a man of John Winslow’s wealth, a merchant and ship-builder, to fit out one of his own ships, with his own goods, and put his son Joseph in command as Captain? Certainly the ship he commanded “Traded” between the Ports of New England, and the ports of Carolina, or he would not have been designated as a “New Eng Traider.” This is, however, a moot point, for which no one has been able to find a satisfactory solution. Joseph Winslow, son of John, & Mary (Chilton) had two children whose ages are given in Savages Dictionary, prior to this date, and may we not, with some foundation, come to the conclusion that Thomas Winslow of Perq, who was of age in 1702, may have been his youngest son, probably born after his death, for Joseph Winslow died in New England 1679. In the absence of proof, we will leave that unsettled question to future generations for solving. No one could serve on a jury, in the Province of N. C. without being a resident of the colony, and having in their possession at least 100a of land, therefore we know he was living in the County, between 1677-79, and it is supposed he would naturally have his family here with him. He probably died in New England on one of his Trading trips. However this may be, we pass on to Thomas Winslow, first in Perq according to records still extant. John Winslow had a grant for land in New Kent Co Va 1669. As the records of New Kent have been destroyed by fire, no further mention of said John is made, but it is probable that he was ancestor of the Spotsylvania Winslows, and also the ones found in Essex Co Va, where a Thomas Winslow, with wife Ann, made a deed 1694. Although the writer has made diligent search in Virginia, for some connection between these Winslows, & the family who moved to Perq, no results have rewarded her efforts. The theory still clings that Joseph of New Eng, was the progenitor of the N. C. Winslows, and it seems the most plausible conclusion, in face of all the facts.\n\nThomas Winslow of Perq, proved his freedom “from Timothy Clare” in 1702. He was either an apprentice to said Timothy, or had been imported by him to the Province of N. C., for which he had to serve for a certain length of time. From the fact that he soon after this date m Elizabeth Clare (d of Timothy, & wife Mary (Bundy) we are led to believe he came of age at that time. The date of marriage can not be found. For some reason unknown to the writer the Winslows did not have their early marriages recorded, although there was an old record book kept by the Reg of Deeds in Perq, no Winslows appear therein. Therefore no dates can be furnished for them, until they became Quakers, which was not until said Thomas m Elizabeth Clare. The Winslows of New England were Episcopalians, and the supposition is that Thomas adhered to the same faith, & changed on arrival in Perq, from association with his wife’s family.\n\nThe will of Thomas Winslow, p in Perq, Jan 1745. Sons: Thomas, Timothy, John, Job, to whom he left “a plan’ in Pasq Co, near Newbegun Creek,” dau’s Elizabeth, & Miriam.\n\nAccording to legal papers in Perq, Thomas Winslow was m to Elizabeth Clear (who was b Feb 21, 1686,) before 1705.\n\nWinslow, Thomas (1) did not have a son Joseph, according to “Grimes,” but in N. C. Historical and Genealogical Reg, a variance is noted, which gives said Thomas, a son by that name, and the deeds in Perq make plain the fact that Joseph (1) was his son. There is also a difference in the dau’s mentioned in these two books, Grimes giving the dau’s as: Elizabeth, & Miriam, and Hathaway as: Elizabeth, & Christian. The writer is not up on the daughters, but she is morally certain that Thomas Winslow (1) had a son by the name of Joseph. A Thomas Winslow m Leah Smith (widow of Joseph), 1734. (See deeds Perq Co.) She was his widow soon after. Who this Thomas was, and where he stood in the line of the family, is an unsolved question.\n\n(1) Winslow, Joseph (thought to be eldest son of Thomas, & Mary (Bundy)) m Pleasant Toms, b 1710 (d of Francis, & Margaret (Bogue)) 22, 6mo 1729, she died 4, 1mo 1785. They had issue according to his will, p in Perq, Jan 1750; Sons: Joseph, to whom he left “land on Core Neck,” dau Lydia, “land at the head of Little River,” dau’s Miriam, & Mary, “land called Grassy Ridge,” wife Pleasant. (See deeds in this book for more information about this family.) Joseph Winslow, had a grt for land in Perq, 225a, granted at a Council in Edenton, Mar 11, 1740. He was living in Balahack, Jan 3, 1745-6 and bought of Samuel Newby 250a, adj “his own line” on that date.\n\n(a) Winslow, Joseph (2) Joseph (1) Thomas (1) m Mary White, (d of Thomas, & Rachel Jordan who were m in Isle of Wight Co 1719; Rachel Jordon d of Joshua, & Elizabeth Sanbourne, d of Daniel Sanbourne, & wife Sarah, of Isle of Wight Co Va, whose will was p in said Co, 16, 12mo 1711.)

His will p in Perq gives his children in the following order: 1 Jacob, 2 Timothy (2), 3 Obed, 4 Caleb, 5 Mary, wife Rachel. His will p July 1752. Test’ John, & Mary Winslow (brother, & sister-in-law). Rachel (Wilson) Winslow m 2d Wm Townsend, by whom she had four children, m 3d John Williams. She is named in her fathers will, 1758, as “dau Rachel Townsend,” and in her son Obeds will as “mother Rachel Williams.” Her will p in Perq, July 1777, is an interesting document, and clears up many puzzles.\n\n(IV) Winslow, John, m Mary Pearson (d of Peter, & wife Rachel) 20, 7mo 1740, issue: 1 Josiah, 28, 7mo 1741—2 Miriam, b 9, 10mo 1743—3 Thomas, b 8. 1mo 1745/6—4 Samuel, b 10, 4mo 1748—5 Ruth, b 23, 7mo 1750/6—6 John, b 2, 9mo 1754.

C.\n\nWinslow (d) Samuel, m Ruth Fletcher 13, 3mo 1771, issue: Mary, b 4, 1mo 1772. He probably left the county, as no will appears in Perq made by him.

C.\n\nTIMOTHY WINSLOW LINE\n\nWinslow, Jacob (1) Timothy (1) Thomas (1), m Elizabeth —? The ages of his children have not been found, although the Quaker records may hold them. A thorough search of these records, kept in the vault at Guilford College, might reveal much valuable data on the Winslow family, if they were open to the public, and one had plenty of time to examine them. However we have Jacob Winslows Will, which was p in Perq, Jan 1771, with his sons named as follows: William, Jacob (2) Obed, and dau’s: Mary, Millicent, Wife Elizabeth.\n\nNathaniel Welch in his will Perq, p 1789, names “daughter Elizabeth Winslaw, but as several Elizabeth Winslows appear in Perquimans county, it is not positive proof that this indicates the wife of Jacob. Besides, Jacob Winslows wife Elizabeth, died before this date, and it was not customary for a person to be named in a will, after death. Her will p in Perq, Jan 1785, names dau Mary Saunders, & Millicent Lamb (wife of Restore), sons: William, & Jacob, dau Betty. Benjamin Saunders, & Restore Lamb Exrs. Jacob Winslow lived in “Piney Woods” district, near the Chowan line, and his home, a quaint old residence with many wings, & cubby rooms, was still in use a few years ago, having descended through several generations to Mrs. Elisha Copeland, d of Francis, & Rachel Winslow (s of William Winslow, & wife Pleasant née White). The old rambling house after her death was demolished, and a new and more modern residence arose on the same site.\n\nWinslow (a) William (1) Jacob (1) Timothy (1) Thomas (1) m Pleasant White (d of John, & Lydia, née Winslow (d of Joseph, & Pleasant (née Toms) Winslow) 7, 3mo 1787, issue: Francis, m Rachel Newby (d of William, & Lydia —) and had issue: Francis (2) m Mary Tatum Jordan (d of Hezekiah, & Mary T.

Wife Pleasant, sons: Obed, Jacob, Francis, William, John, Josiah, dau’s: Liddy, Mary, & Elizabeth. Exrs, Caleb Winslow, Restore Lamb, Jacob Winslow, & Joseph Copeland. He lived on the edge of Perquimans, and his grand-son Francis (2) made his home in early married life at a place called “Snow Hill” just across the line in Perquimans. Here were born the four little boys, Edward, Tudor, Watson, & Cook, who took an active part in later life in the public affairs of said county. The Winslows are too numerous to trace out all the various family connections, in their many ramifications, and also there is not sufficient data, to make them clear, but this much is certain, both and all branches of this wonderful family, trace back to either Thomas (1) son of Joseph, or John (1) who is supposed to have been brother of said Thomas. Any one wishing to find the data relative to his or her own particular branch, should find no difficulty in tracing them on the splendid records in Perq, where every known Winslow figures at some time or other.\n\nExcursus.

This John m Esther Snelling (d of Israel, & Hannah, née “Larance.” d of William Lawrence, & “Rachell Welsh”) Hannah Snelling m 2d Timothy Clare, his 3d and last wife, by whom she had one dau Hannah. From this we see that John Winslow m the step-sister of Elizabeth Clare, who was the wife of Thomas Winslow. (See wills of Timothy Clare, 1724, and his last wife Hannah, 1726 (Grimes). John Winslow (brother of Thomas) will p in Perq, Jan 25, 1753, names sons: Benjamin, Israel, John, & Joseph, dau’s: Elizabeth, Hannah, & Esther, wife Esther.\n\nThe 2d John, whom it seems certain was nephew of John (1), made his will also in Perq Co, p July 1754, naming sons: Josiah, Thomas, & Samuel, dau Miriam, and wife Mary (d of Peter Pearson) therefore we make this distinction, so there will be no confusion of the two Johns, who come so close together. He has been classed as John Winslow (2) to distinguish him from his uncle, by the same name.?\n\nWinslow, Benjamin (1) John (1) m Rachel White (d of Thomas, & Rachel née Jordan) and had issue according to his will: (Nov 1794) Sons: Joseph, John, Jordan, and Benjamin (2) dau’s: Sarah, & Rachel. His wife is not named in his will, but she is mentioned in the will of her mother, whose will was located behind an old looking glass, by an antique dealer in Suffolk Va, a few years past. This will is very interesting, but unfortunately is not dated, or signed, positive proof however can be found in the fact that she names the identical children in her will, that her husband Thomas White does in his 1762, p in Perq. (See Perq records.) Mr. Alonza Winslow of Winfall N. C. is a direct descendant of this line of the Winslow family, but the writer has not the data to trace his line.\n\nWinslow, Joseph, was grt 225a in Perq, Mar 6, 1740/1.

This county had two families by that name, the older descendants of Lewis Williams of Surry Co Va, and another family represented by Tulle Williams, who came to Perq later, from Currituck Co N. C. The last is well written up in N. C. Historical, & Gen’ Reg, therefore we will treat only of the ones who have not had mention.\n\nAfter much faithful perusal of a great deal of legal matter, some interesting data has been unearthed which throws light on the Williams family living in Perq at an early date.\n\nRoland Williams appears to be the earliest trans’ to Va, coming in “Jonathan” 1620, age 20 years. Rowland Williams was granted 70a of land, Oct 20 1704 “at a place called piney Swamp, Warwick Co Va. Rowland Williams was among the living, “Att Elizabeth Cittye” Feb 16, 1623, after the Indian massacre of Mar 22, 1622. From London to Va, in “Thomas, & John” June 16, 1635, Robert Williams, age 44. Roger Williams came in “Truelove” from London, June 10 1635, age 16 years. Thomas Williams arrived in “Transport” from Gravesend, July 4, 1635, age 18. Aboard “Abraham” of London Nov 20, 1635, William Williams, age 25. Thomas Williams was among the living at “West & Sherlew hundred” Feb 16, 1623 (Census). Also Henry, & Mrs. Williams—At James City, Hugh Williams is found among the living, and at “Elizabeth Cittye” William Williams, & Mrs. Williams. William Williams “of great Yarm,” age 40 emigrated to New Eng Apl 11, 1637, with wife Alles, & two children. Ann Williams was trans’ to Va by John Branch, Aug 27, 1640. John Williams of Isle of Wight Co, in his will, p said Co, Aug 9, 1692, gave his “dwelling plan’ to wife Anne for life,” and to son John his “Manor plan” names younger son Christopher, made bequest to “William, sone of William Williams, 200a in Newport parish;” To son Thomas land in Surry Co, “where my son John now liveth” son Richard 300a in same Co, “where son John liveth,” dau’s: Mary, Jane, gr-daus: Ann & Bridgett. (Records Isle of Wight.) Roger Williams & wife Mary deeded land in Surry Co, to Richard Blow, “purchased of Samuel Swann, on Pidgeon Swamp” Mar 1 1680. In another deed same Co, he calls himself “Cooper” & sold 200a to John Watkins, “Land purchased of Maj Samuel Swann, for 261 lbs of Tob, Jan 3, 1681. Christopher Lewis of Southwarke parish Surry Co, in his will, p Aug 20, 1673, gave to Roger Williams, & son Roger, cattle, and to the elder “my chest with all my cooper tools.”\n\nWilliam Williams “Orphan of Lewis dec’d,” July 9, 1681. He was bound apprentice to William Newman, July 16, 1683, “until he arrive at age of 21 years” (Surry Co). John Whitley in his will, Isle of Wight Co, Feb 21, 1670, names his “son-in-law John Williams, & dau Ann.” Ann Whitley in her will, same Co, names sons: John, Thomas, & William Williams, gr-dau Elizabeth Williams (d of John) Feb 13, 1671. (She was probably wife of John Williams above, & m 2d Whitley.)\n\nGeorge Williams will Isle of Wight, p Oct 9, 1672, made bequest that his three children, “William live with Mr. — Cobb, & George, & Elizabeth, with William Bressie, & Susanna his wife.” George (2) moved to Northampton Co N. C., and his descendants from there to S. C.\n\nObed Williams was granted 440a in York Co Va, May 6, 1651, for trans’ among them Thomas Williams. Thomas Williams (s of Obediance) was granted 50a in said Co, May 6, 1654. John Williams planter— and Dorothy his wife sold 100a in Nansemond Co Va, “upon New Town Haven River” which was granted by Sir Wm Berkeley to Col Robert Pitt” of Isle of Wight Co, Aug 12, 1665. (Isle of Wight records.)\n\nJohn Williams of Albemarle N. C. “sold unto Ralph Vickers of Newport parish, Co Isle of Wight” 200a in North end of Surry Co, near a plan’ where Wm Williams formerly lived,” half of a Pattent to George Pierce, from Sir Henry Cichley, Kt Dept Gov of Vir,” April 3, 1681, & by him sold to John & Thomas Williams, Oct 10, 1681. John & Stephen Williams of Albemarle, province of N. C. sold 170a to Richard Williams of Isle of Wight, “on South side of ye main Blackwater,” part of a grant, 600a unto William Williams, Oct 28, 1702. Seal Aug 22, 1705.\n\nArthur Williams of Chowan, made a deed of gift to “loving brother John, 300a where he now liveth, in Lower pish Isle of Wight Co” which was granted John Williams dec’d. Sept 26, 1719.\n\nThomas Williams (s of Obediance) was granted land in York Co Va, 1663. He had a grant for land in Nansemond Co, Oct 17, 1648, “an Island, called Island Creek.” He m Susanna Davis (widow of John) and had sons: Edward, & John.\n\nThe Williams family in Perq was first represented by Richard Williams, who m Margary — and had issue: Jane, b July 6, 1681—Ruth, b Jan 22, 1686/7. James Penney of Isle of Wight Co, gave to dau Margaret Williams, 500 lbs of Tob, and names gr-son John Williams, wife Lucy (no date).\n\nJenkens Williams (no parents) m Johanna Barrow, Aug 3, 1690, issue: John, b Oct 12, 1691.\n\nWilliam Williams of Albemarle, will p April 15, 1712. Wife Mary. Sons: Samuel, John (to whom he left “land on Black Water called Littel Town”) son Steven. He probably lived in Chowan Co, and his descendants drifted over into Perq. John Williams will Albemarle, Jan 29, 1727/8, names dau Mary, brother Nathaniel (to whom he left a plan’) wife Sarah. This will was certainly made in Perq, as Charles Denman, Clerk of Perq, probated said will.\n\nWilliam Williams above (is thought to be) from all the evidence produced, was the son of Lewis Williams of Surry Co, who was apprenticed to Wm Newman.\n\nNathaniel (brother of John) m Elizabeth Underwood (d of Thomas) (or Bridger), who is named in the will of said Thomas of Isle of Wight Co, & also in the will of Elizabeth Bridger of same Co, Apl 5, 1717.\n\nNathaniel, & wife Elizabeth, issue: 1 Timothy, b Dec 2, 1726—2 Sarah, & Ann (twins) b Feb 12, 1727/8—3 John, b Apl 17, 1729—4 James, b May 7, 1732.\n\nOf Timothy we have no knowledge. John Williams (s of Nathaniel) m 1st —, m 2d Rachel Wilson (widow of Wm Townsend, who had for 1st husband Timothy Winslow) by whom he had no issue apparently. His will, p in Perq April 1774, names sons James & John, dau Mary Wilson (step-dau, d of Timothy Winslow) & Anne Donaldson, wife Rachel. Her will same Co, p July 1777, also names dau Mary Wilson. This will is a very interesting document, in that it throws so much light on past history, which would otherwise be baffling to an enormous degree. (See Wilson.)\n\nJames Williams will Perq, p Jan 1777. Children: Miriam, John, Sarah, Thomas, & Mary, wife Mary, & Issachar Branch Exrs. One of the witnesses to this will; Anne Donaldson. (For other Williams Wills, see N. C. Hist’ & Gen Reg, Vol 3-2—3-3.)\n\nThomas Williams living in Perq, m before July 1755, Elizabeth Pratt, widow of Jeremiah, and became guardian of Rose, Isaac, Jobe, & Joseph Mathias, orphans of John Dec’d. They jointly petitioned the Court, to sell perishable Estate of said John, & to have possession of it, “out of the hands of Jacob Caruthers.” In the division of the Estate of Robert Roe Sr, July 17, 1763, Elizabeth Williams appears as an heir.\n\nSource: History of Perquimans County by Ellen Goode Rawlings Winslow, (1931).\n\nWHITE\n\nThomas White was a subject in the colony at Jamestown, 1609. (Browns Genesis to America.)\n\nJames White in Va same date, at same place. Henry White of York Co Va, had a son Henry, who moved to Isle of Wight. From the dates it seems probable that this was the identical Henry White who migrated to Perq Precinct N. C., before 1670. He built the first Quaker Church in Perquimans, thought to be Little River Mo meeting, which was about where Woodville is situated. Just beyond the confines of this village can be seen at the present time an old Quaker burying ground, with small stones such as were in common use at that day among the simple Quakers. Meetings were held at the house of Henry White, 26, 4mo 1690, at which time, James Davis (s of William) and Elizabeth White (d of Henry) of Albemarle, took each other as man and wife. Another Quarterly meeting convened at the house of Henry White, 1, 3mo 1695, when it was “agreed that Robert Wilson, Francis Toms, & Henry White, doe write a letter in behalf of the Meeting, to friends at yearly meeting in London.” At a meeting held at the house of Arnold White, 24, 4mo 1679, there were present: Henry White, Timothy Meade, Francis Toms, Charles Moris, Jonathan Tailer, Arnold White, George Tailer, Mary White, Rebecka Simons, Solomon Pool, & Margaret White. The children of Solomon Pool were registered at this meeting, as follows: Richard, b 2, 3mo 1680—Ane, b 12, 2mo 1682—Mary, b 15, 10mo 1683—Solomon (2) b 23, 4mo 1687.\n\nAs Arnold appears in Perq simultaneously with Henry White, the inference may be drawn with some certainty, that they were brothers, but the records do not mention the fact. John and William White also made their entry into Perquimans about the same time, and they may also be brothers.\n\nWhite, Henry, children as recorded in the Quaker Reg, of Perq Co, are as follows:Ann, b 5, 10mo 1669—\n\nElizabeth, b 29, 10mo 1673—\n\nRobert, b 2, 11mo 1674—\n\nJames, & John (twins), b 20, 5mo 1676—\n\nElkanah, b 2mo 1679—\n\nMary, b middle of 8mo 1682—\n\nDamaris, b —, 12mo 1684—\n\nConstant — —\n\nHenry (2), b 25, 4mo 1690—\n\nArnold, b end of 7mo 1693—\n\nMary (2d by name), b —, 7mo 1696—\n\nJonas, b 24, 4mo 1700—\n\nSarah, b middle of 4mo 1704.\n\nHis wife was Mary, who died 3, 3mo 1679, and mother of his first five children. His second wife is not given.\n\nThe will of Henry White, p in Albemarle, Sept 19, 1706, names the following issue: Henry, Arnold, Isaac, Robert, & John, to whom he devised his “Maner plantation,” dau’s: Content and Naomy. (No wife is mentioned.) Henry White bought land in Surry Co Va, June 9, 1655 (Surry records). He made an affidavit in Perq Co, 1689, giving his age as 57 years.

Henry White pioneered to N. C. much earlier than the last named. It is thought, but not proven, that Thomas of Isle of Wight, was a descendant of John White, who came to Va, from New England, & took up land in Norfolk Co.\n\nElder John White, b 1596 in Essex Co England, arrived in New England, 1632, settled at Cambridge, Mass. John White (uncle of Peregrine, s of William, & Ann (Fuller) White) came to Norfolk Va, 1679, where he m Mary — & had John Nicholas, b in Norfolk 1689. John White, of the Southern Branch of Elizabeth River, Yeoman—apt’ Anthony Bonford, of Chuckatuck, Nanzimund Co, planter—Att’ to sell unto Paul Luke, of Isle of Wight, Land, Cattle, Household stuff, in sd Co, belonging to his wife Edy Lewellin, d of Thomas, formerly of said Co, for 300 lbs of Tob.

(Elizabeth Sanborn, was d of Daniel, and wife Sarah.) (See the will of Daniel Sanborne Isle of Wight.)\n\nWhite, Thomas, & wife Rachel (Jordan) had issue: 1 Lydia, b 12, 9mo 1720, m John Robinson—2 Elizabeth, b 19, 10mo 1722, m Joseph Pritchard—3 Joshua, b 26, 11mo 1727, m Guliemma Jordan—4 Jordan, b 20, 3mo 1729—5 Thomas, & Rachel (twins), b 25, 12mo 1730—5 Rachel White, m Benjamin Winslow, (s of John, & Esther (Snelling) Winslow)—6 John, b 17, 3mo 1733, m Mary (d of Joseph, & Pleasant (Toms) Winslow)—7 Mary, b 29, 2mo 1735, m Joseph Winslow (s of Joseph & wife Pleasant (Toms) Winslow)—8 Matthew, b 10, 3mo 1738, m Mary Robinson—9 Caleb, b 8, 3mo 1740, m Rebecca Toms (d of Francis (3) & wife Rebecca Nixon, d of Zachariah Nixon, & wife Elizabeth Symons of Pasq Co.) Rebecca White was b Jan 8, 1743.\n\nWhite, Thomas, will Perq, book C p 1, p Jan 1762. He bequeathed, to wife Rachel, a negro called Judah, & a negro girl Priscilla, a mare, called “Pink” and a horse, called “Sorrel,” 1 large looking glass, and 1 square table. Sons: Joshua, Thomas, Joseph, John, Matthew, Caleb, and Benjamin (not of age), dau’s Mary Winslow, (to whom he left a “large looking glass”) Sarah, gr-dau’s Sarah, & Mary Pritchard.\n\nWhite, Joshua, (eldest son of Thomas) will Perq, p Apl 25, 1784, names s Jacob, (to whom he left 125a of land, on both sides of Cypress Swamp) s Zachariah, s Joshua (Plan’ where I now live) dau’s Mourning, Mary, & Elizabeth, wife Mary.

(See Jordan family, for Rachel Whites Will.)\n\nWhite, Mourning, spoken of in the Henry White line, as wife of John White, & mother Robert, (who m Rebeccah Albertson,) may have been a d of Joshua (1) & wife Gulielma. The Whites, & Winslows, crossed so many times, it is difficult to distinguish, one from another. Robert (s of John) died 25, 6mo 1830. This seems all the more to be credited, from the fact that Robert, & Rebeccah had a son named Jordan White, b 8, 9mo 1821, died 21, 6mo 1822.\n\nWhite, Joseph, (s of Joshua, & Rachel (Jordan) White) is mentioned in his will, but his age is not given. From the fact that five years intervened, between the date of Elizabeth, & Joshua Jordans ages, it is probable that he is the one between. Benjamin White also has no birth date, but we know from his fathers will, that he was the youngest child.\n\nWhite, Thomas, (twin to Rachel) m Anne Barnes, May 11, 1755, issue: 1 Miles, b Apl 25, 1756—2 Nathan, b Nov 12, 1757—3 Seth, b Mch 1, 1759—4 Orpha, b Sept 25, 1761—Elizabeth, b Oct 27, 1763—Jonathan, b Mch 2, 1766—Miriam, b Oct 25, 1768—d. s. p. 1831.

He was granted Armes by same 1079, and was given an Estate, in South Tavistock, Co Devon, and married relict of Trecareth, who is thought to be the former incumbent of said Estate. His son Stephen was granted permission 1150, to wear his hat in the Kings presence, & also an Estate of Samerton, near Travitock, in Pembroke Co, Wales, which the Tuckers have held for over 400 years (the Sealyham property) and have used the same coat of Arms.\n\nGeorge Tucker, m Maria Hunter of Gaunnte, was a man of note in Milton, next Gravesend, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who conveyed to him the “Manor” 1572. He was appointed Jurat July 22, 1562, by said Queen, & Henry Tucker of Bermuda, was Jurat 1639, & Mayor of Gravesend & Milton 1637. They were brothers, and soon after this disappeared from England, and the tradition is generally accepted they they emigrated to America.\n\nDaniel Tucker was a subject in the Colony, at Jamestown 1609. (Brown Gen to America.)\n\nCapt William Tucker was among the living “Att Elizabeth Cittye” Feb 16, 1623. He received a grt of 650a “on East side of the main River, agst Elizabeth Cittie,” and 150a at Newport News, 1626, in the Corporation of Henrico. (Land Office, Richmond Va.) He was deputized to go against the rebellious Nansemond & Warrasquicke Indians 1623/4, and served as Burgess from said Co, 1624. John Tucker had a grant for land, Oct 28, 1697, 65a on N. E. side of Western Branch, Nansemond Co, and was living in Lower Norfolk Co Va, Oct 5, 1683, at which time he made a deed unto Capt Wm Robinson, 200a of land which sd Robinson bequeathed in his will, Mar 5, 1695, to Wm Thorogood of Princess Anne Co, who sold sd land to Col Edward Moseley, of same Co, & he in like manner sold land to Nath’l Tatum of Norfolk Co, Nov 26, 1715, “land on Elizabeth River, at the head of Western Branch, of Indian Creek.” The Tuckers settled at a place called “Tucker Town.”\n\nRobert Tucker of Weymouth, about 1635 emigrated to Milton Mass, 1662, m Elizabeth Allen, b 1604, d 1682, son Monrasch Tucker, m Waitstill Sumner, b 1654, d 1743, issue Samuel, m Rebecca Leeds, b Milton Mass 1687, d 1758, had son Samuel, m Elizabeth Haywood, b 1719, d 1776, who had son Nathaniel, b 1769.\n\nMr Robert Tucker of Lower Norfolk Co Va dec’d, Mar 1723.

C. and Virginia, the writer has arrived at the conclusion, that the Toms emigrant, to N. C., was living in Charles City Co Va, where he sold land in sd County, to Francis Gray, Feb 17, 1656. Only mention of him, so far found, but that is not strange, considering the fact, that nothing remains of the records in that Co, except one book. Gabriel Toms appears on the records in Essex Co Va, but no connection between the two, can be made. However, there may have been, some relationship. It is thought, but not proven, that the Francis who settled in Perq, is the identical one, who is named in sd record, as the dates would bear me out, in that opinion. From Edmundson’s Journal, we are led to believe, that he did not embrace Quakerism, until the time of Edmundson’s first journey to N. C. 1672. At which time, he & his wife, Mary (d of John Nicholson, sister of William) went over to the new cult. Mary being his 3d wife, by whom he had no issue. Her will p in Perq, 1717, does not name a single one of his children. She was probably a widow before m Francis Toms, as she names in her will, Vesty Lewis, who was wife of Edward Lewis, & probably her daughter.\n\nFrancis Toms, m before coming to Perq, Pershillah — by whom he had issue: Penelope, b Jan 27, 1670—Francis (2), b Sept 19, 1672—Pershillah, b Mch 19, 1674/5—Joseph, b Nov 16, 1677, died June 6, 1679—Caleb, & Joshua (twins), b Nov 25, 1679.\n\nToms, Francis, m 2d Abigail Lury (widow of John) Jan 6, 1683, by whom one d Abigail, b Dec 10, 1684. Abigail Toms, Wife of Francis, died Mar 17, 1687.†\n\nToms, Francis, m 3d Mary Nicholson, who survived him.\n\nToms, Francis Sr, lived near “Lower Pond, on Reedy Branch, at the head of Vosses Creek.” His land adj John Flowers, on western side of “Long Reach” in the “Narrows” of Perq River. The land on Vosses Creek, where his dwelling was erected, adj William Morgan. He had a stretch of land, running from Vosses Creek, to “Middle Swamp” called “Frog Hall.” This place still retains its original name, to this day. Francis Toms Jr owned land on S. W. side of Perq River, on “Bull Branch, adj land sold to Henry Grace, June 24, 1714. His land also joined land of William Jones. Francis Toms Sr, made a deed of gift, to Thomas Pierce, Wm Bogue, Isaac Wilson, & Gabriel Newby, 1a of land, “for the Society of Protestant Desenters, Vulgarly called Quakers, whereon a Church is now built,” in Perq Precinct, 11mo called Jan, 1705/6. This house of Worship, is supposed to have been Vosses Creek Meeting house, on said Creek, the exact location, being lost and uncertain. He was a member of the Council, for many years (see deeds). Clerk of Pasq Precinct Aug 8, 1692 (see will of John Nixon). Dept’ to Lord Amey, & his name appears on many grants given by the Lords Pro’r. His oath before the Gov Council, is of interest, to all historians, in its quaint wording, he promised “to Keepe ye Secrett of ye Council, to ye best of my advice, according to my Understanding.” This oath was administered in 1706. He had been a member of the Council, since Feb 6, 1683/4. Francis Toms “Collector of Customs” (no date).\n\nOn 15, 7mo 1696, he left Perq, on a two months journey (probably to London) but his business is not stated, maybe in the interests of the Quaker Church. Before leaving, he deputized “Wm Glover, his Lov’ Friend, to get timber for a big Mill, or a little one, & left it wholely to him, which thee thinks most benificall for me.” This was probably the beginning of Toms Mill, on Suttons Creek, in fact if his land ran to Middle Swamp, as before stated, & sd place was called even then, “Frog Hall” we are certain the “Mill” here mentioned, was built on this property. He made a deed, Feb 9, 1688, with consent of wife Abigail, for 300a at the head of Yeopim Creek, “called John Lasy’s Plan’,” land pat by Wm Charles, June 6, 1683. Another deed Jan 5, 1689/90, with the signature of his last wife Mary. In a deed Mar 24, 1687, he gives the information, that he had been grt 587a in Perq Precinct. (See deeds.)\n\nThe Hon’ble Francis Toms, had a grt, in Perq Pr’ct, 640a, adj Capt Ralph Fletcher, & James Morgan, to corner of Wm Voss, & along his line to the River (Perquimans). May 1, 1695. Francis Toms Esq, another grt, in Perq Pre’ct 375a on North side of Perq River, by beaver dam Swamp. Feb 26, 1696.\n\n†Note: John Lacey (Lurey) 2d husband of Abigail Balie, in his Will Perq Precinct, Dec 1, 1682, names wife Abigail, & d Sarah. This may be the same Sarah, for whom Foster Toms put in a claim, for her Estate, in 1754. It is thought she m Christopher Denman, but no absolute proof is forthcoming.\n\nToms, Francis Sr, will Perq, 6, 10mo 1709.
