        "text": "Abstract The so-called ‘Blackwater scandal’ – a reference to the seventeen Iraqi civilians killed on Nisour Square by security guards of the private military company (PMC) Blackwater in September 2007 – puts into question the proposition that private military contractors or ‘mercenaries’ could be relied upon to act effectively and responsibly in peacekeeping and other international operations. Arguably, Blackwater’s frequently observed callousness, if typical of other Private Military Companies (PMCs), gravely undermines this proposition. After closely analysing the Nisour Square incident and the Blackwater company in a wider context of revealed patterns of violence by the personnel of multiple PMCs, the article concludes that the use of ‘mercenaries’ is in principle still possible, doable and defensible – after the necessary reforms and improvements have been made. Yet it remains doubtful whether a sufficient number of PMCs and their personnel are or will become (self-)disciplined, well-trained and trustworthy enough for large, complex and dangerous operations. One certainly should strengthen the (pre) conditions for deploying these ‘contractors’ in both international military missions which involve combat duties and operations, and international civilian missions with a military component focused on (body)guard and sentry duties only.\n\nThe so-called ‘Blackwater scandal’ – a reference to the seventeen Iraqi civilians killed on Nisour Square by security guards of the private military company (PMC) Blackwater in September 1997 – puts into question the proposition that private military contractors or ‘mercenaries’ could be relied upon to act effectively and responsibly in peacekeeping and other international operations. Arguably, Blackwater’s frequently observed callousness, if typical of other Private Military Companies (PMCs), gravely undermines this proposition. After closely analysing the Nisour Square incident and the Blackwater company in a wider context of revealed patterns of violence by the personnel of multiple PMCs, the article concludes that the use of ‘mercenaries’ is in principle still possible, doable and defensible – after the necessary reforms an improvements have been made. Yet it remains doubtful whether a sufficient number of PMCs and their personnel are or soon will be (self-)disciplined, well-trained and thrustworthy enough for large, complex and dangerous operations. Be as it may, one should strengthen the (pre)conditions for deploying these ‘contractors’ in both international military missions which involve combat duties and operations, and international civilian missions with a military component focused on (body)guard and sentry duties only.\n\nAt the end of May 2015, U.S. government announced its intention to boost the number of Private Military Contractors in Iraq, according to the Professional Overseas Contractors website, as part of the White House’s growing effort to drive away the Islamic State that is threatening the Iraqi capital. Paradoxically, this decision has been made at a moment when Iraq has 600’000 security forces, is spending every year approximately 7 billion dollars on defense and there is an international Coalition that is supporting the security forces to counter ISIS, even though mainly aerial. While the literature of last 12 years on Iraq has paid a lot of attention on the legal or ethical use of Private Military Contractors in this country, this paper attempts to identify if the presence of PMSCs in post-Saddam Iraq has affected the reconstruction of the Iraqi Army, by looking at the role they played starting with the very moment when former Iraqi Army had been dismantled, until Mosul moment, in June 2014. Keywords: PMSCs; the Iraqi Army, state reconstruction, Security Sector Reform, Mosul, ISIS.\n\nJerry Burke was part of part of the Justice and State Depts review team of the Iraqi police in May 2003. Form May 2003-June 2004 he served as an advisor to the Baghdad Police and from March 2005-January 2006 he was an advisor to the Iraqi Interior Ministry. In this the second of a two part interview with Burkey he discusses how the Badr Brigade took over the Iraqi Interior Ministry and put its militiamen into the police force, which then carried out sectarian attacks. The U.S. was aware of these moves and did nothing to stop it.\n\nDr. Michael Knights is a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He is also the Vice President of Olive Group, an international security company that works in Iraq. Knights has been researching, writing, and working in Iraq for the last three decades. He is one of the premier analysts on the security situation within the country. From 2005-2008 Iraq fell into a sectarian civil war that almost destroyed the nation. It has only been in the last few years that it has been able to claw itself out of this situation. Many are unaware of what security is like currently in Iraq, because the news is dominated by stories about bombings and killings. Today, violence has become very local with only select areas affected, which has allowed the majority of Iraqis to return to their normal lives. That doesn’t mean that Iraq is anything like a normal country, but things are changing. Unfortunately, the country’s political crisis is a major factor dividing the country, and creating a fertile environment for militants to continue to operate in. Below is an interview with Knights about what security is like in different parts of the country, what role politics plays in the situation, and the future of the insurgency."
