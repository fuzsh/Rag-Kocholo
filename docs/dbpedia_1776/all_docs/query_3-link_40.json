        "text": "Tag: Williams\n\nWHITE\n\nThomas White was a subject in the colony at Jamestown, 1609. (Browns Genesis to America.)\n\nJames White in Va same date, at same place. Henry White of York Co Va, had a son Henry, who moved to Isle of Wight. From the dates it seems probable that this was the identical Henry White who migrated to Perq Precinct N. C., before 1670. He built the first Quaker Church in Perquimans, thought to be Little River Mo meeting, which was about where Woodville is situated. Just beyond the confines of this village can be seen at the present time an old Quaker burying ground, with small stones such as were in common use at that day among the simple Quakers. Meetings were held at the house of Henry White, 26, 4mo 1690, at which time, James Davis (s of William) and Elizabeth White (d of Henry) of Albemarle, took each other as man and wife. Another Quarterly meeting convened at the house of Henry White, 1, 3mo 1695, when it was “agreed that Robert Wilson, Francis Toms, & Henry White, doe write a letter in behalf of the Meeting, to friends at yearly meeting in London.” At a meeting held at the house of Arnold White, 24, 4mo 1679, there were present: Henry White, Timothy Meade, Francis Toms, Charles Moris, Jonathan Tailer, Arnold White, George Tailer, Mary White, Rebecka Simons, Solomon Pool, & Margaret White. The children of Solomon Pool were registered at this meeting, as follows: Richard, b 2, 3mo 1680—Ane, b 12, 2mo 1682—Mary, b 15, 10mo 1683—Solomon (2) b 23, 4mo 1687.\n\nAs Arnold appears in Perq simultaneously with Henry White, the inference may be drawn with some certainty, that they were brothers, but the records do not mention the fact. John and William White also made their entry into Perquimans about the same time, and they may also be brothers.\n\nWhite, Henry, children as recorded in the Quaker Reg, of Perq Co, are as follows:Ann, b 5, 10mo 1669—\n\nElizabeth, b 29, 10mo 1673—\n\nRobert, b 2, 11mo 1674—\n\nJames, & John (twins), b 20, 5mo 1676—\n\nElkanah, b 2mo 1679—\n\nMary, b middle of 8mo 1682—\n\nDamaris, b —, 12mo 1684—\n\nConstant — —\n\nHenry (2), b 25, 4mo 1690—\n\nArnold, b end of 7mo 1693—\n\nMary (2d by name), b —, 7mo 1696—\n\nJonas, b 24, 4mo 1700—\n\nSarah, b middle of 4mo 1704.\n\nHis wife was Mary, who died 3, 3mo 1679, and mother of his first five children. His second wife is not given.\n\nThe will of Henry White, p in Albemarle, Sept 19, 1706, names the following issue: Henry, Arnold, Isaac, Robert, & John, to whom he devised his “Maner plantation,” dau’s: Content and Naomy. (No wife is mentioned.) Henry White bought land in Surry Co Va, June 9, 1655 (Surry records). He made an affidavit in Perq Co, 1689, giving his age as 57 years. (Gen’l Court, May 26, 1689.)\n\nWhite, Arnold Sr, issue: 1 Philliman, b 10, 10mo 1670—2 Arnold, b 29, 4mo 1673—3 Paul, b 20, 1mo 1676. Mary White, wife of Arnold, died —, 1mo 1679.\n\nWhite, Arnold Jr, (s of Arnold Sr) issue: 1 Paul, b 6, 8mo 1697—2 Ann, b 1, 1mo 1699—3 Joshua, b 28, 12mo 1702—4 Nehemiah, b 25, 12mo 1712—5 Pathenea, b 6, 10mo 1717. Mary wife of Arnold, died 23, 1mo 1680. He m 2d Phereby Nixon, 1, 9mo 1696.\n\nWhite, John (s of Henry) m Elizabeth Newby (d of John) issue: 1 Abraham, b 3, 12mo 1700—2 Sarah, b —, 11mo 1703—3 Rachel, b — 1705—4 Jonas, b —, 11mo 1707—5 Elirabe, b —, 1mo 1711—6 John, b —, 11mo 1713—7 Rebecca, b —, 5mo 1716.\n\nWhite, Arnold, will Perq, Mar 22, 1690. Names d Elizabeth, s Arnold, brother Henry, wife not named.\n\nMARRIAGES\n\nWhite, John (s of Henry of Little River) m Elizabeth Newby (d of John, & dau-in-law of Matthew Collins of same) 14, 11mo 1696, “at the house of James Davis.”\n\nWhite, Arnold, m Rebeccah Overman, In, at Newbegun Creek, 18, 5mo 1717.\n\nWhite, Arnold Sr, m Jane Pike (widow, of Pasq precinct) 9, 4mo 1720.\n\nWhite, Jonathan (s of Robert), m Ann Pike (d of Samuel) 10, 2mo 1729.\n\nWhite, Abraham, m Sarah Keaton, In, at Newbegun Creek, 9, 9mo 1723.\n\nWhite, Henry, m Ruth Keaton, In, at Newbegun Creek, 4, 3mo 1727.\n\nWhite, Nehemiah, m Hannah Overman, at Newbegun Creek, 3, 3mo 1732.\n\nWhite, Nehemiah, m 2d Martha Pritchard, in, 7, 3mo 1734.\n\nWhite, Joseph, m Sarah Newby, In, 4, 4mo 1736, at Symons Creek.\n\nWhite, John, m Susannah Hill, In, 6, 9mo 1746, at Symons Creek.\n\nWhite, Benjamin, m Miriam Pike, In, 3, 9mo 1761, at Symons Creek.\n\nWhite, William, was a passenger for Va, in Primrose July 27, 1625, Comd of Capt Douglas. William, and John who came to Perquimans about the same date of Henry’s arrival, may have been his brothers. They quickly disappear from the records in Perq. John m Margaret Titerton (widow of William, née Hall), Jan 18, 1685. John Waite died Jan 14, 1691. According to his will p in Perq, Apl 4, 1692, he left no heirs. The legatees in said will being wife Margaret, William & Elizabeth Tetterton (Step-children).\n\nWhite, William, m Margery Williams, September 1693. He had by a former wife Rebecka, issue: 1 Sarah, b Oct 13, 1681—2 Thomas, b Nov 17, 1684—3 Samuel, b Dec 2, 1687. William White died Jan 14, 1687.

She had by first husband Francis & Elizabeth Foster, named in his will—Oct 9, 1687. Diana White m 3 times, 1st Thomas Harris, Clerk of Perq, 2d William Foster, & 3rd Thomas White. Perq Court was held in the house of Thomas Harris, and after his death, 1679, at the house of Diana Harris, Sept 1679, and still later, at the house of Thomas White, presumably the same house each time. Thomas White in his will Mar 11, 1695, names wife Diana, and William Collins, who it is thought m Elizabeth Harris, d of Diana by her 1st husband.\n\nWhite, Robert, (s of Henry) will Albemarle, April 19, 1698. Sons: Vincent, Robert, d Mary, friend Thomas Jones. Robert (2) lived in Pasq Co, where his will was p April 16, 1733, Sons: Jonathan, Zapaniah, Joseph, dau’s: Ann, Elizabeth.\n\nWhite, Nehemiah, (s of Arnold Jr) will Pasq Co, p July 1751.

She was John Whites 2d wife, he having m 1st Elizabeth Newby.\n\nWhite, Jean, Relict of Roger White, m 2d John Wilkinson, Jan 9, 1686. (Berkeley Reg.)\n\nHenry White made affidavit in Perq 1689, that he “knew Samuel Davis in Isle of Wight Co Va”, “where he was an apprentice of Henry White his father” before 1660, said Samuel also migrating to N. C.\n\nWhite, Edmund, m Millicent Toms, In, 3mo 1788, at Welles meeting house, in Perq. It is not positively known which branch of Whites he belongs to. He certainly had one son Edmund (s of Edmund, & Mary dec’d) of Pasq Co, m Margaret Nixon (s of Samuel, & Rachel dec’d of Perq) 15, 5mo 1816, at Suttons Creek meeting house. Margaret wife of Edmond died 14, 11mo 1827.\n\nWhite, Samuel, will Perq Co p April 1779, names sons: Gabriel, Joshua, William, Benjamin, & Arnold, wife Hepsibee.

Henry White pioneered to N. C. much earlier than the last named. It is thought, but not proven, that Thomas of Isle of Wight, was a descendant of John White, who came to Va, from New England, & took up land in Norfolk Co.\n\nElder John White, b 1596 in Essex Co England, arrived in New England, 1632, settled at Cambridge, Mass. John White (uncle of Peregrine, s of William, & Ann (Fuller) White) came to Norfolk Va, 1679, where he m Mary — & had John Nicholas, b in Norfolk 1689. John White, of the Southern Branch of Elizabeth River, Yeoman—apt’ Anthony Bonford, of Chuckatuck, Nanzimund Co, planter—Att’ to sell unto Paul Luke, of Isle of Wight, Land, Cattle, Household stuff, in sd Co, belonging to his wife Edy Lewellin, d of Thomas, formerly of said Co, for 300 lbs of Tob. Apl 23, 1664. (Records Isle of Wight Co.)\n\nWhite, Thomas (s of John of Isle of Wight) m Rachel Jordan (d of Joshua, & Elizabeth (Sanbourne) Jordan) 13, 7mo 1719. (Elizabeth Sanborn, was d of Daniel, and wife Sarah.) (See the will of Daniel Sanborne Isle of Wight.)\n\nWhite, Thomas, & wife Rachel (Jordan) had issue: 1 Lydia, b 12, 9mo 1720, m John Robinson—2 Elizabeth, b 19, 10mo 1722, m Joseph Pritchard—3 Joshua, b 26, 11mo 1727, m Guliemma Jordan—4 Jordan, b 20, 3mo 1729—5 Thomas, & Rachel (twins), b 25, 12mo 1730—5 Rachel White, m Benjamin Winslow, (s of John, & Esther (Snelling) Winslow)—6 John, b 17, 3mo 1733, m Mary (d of Joseph, & Pleasant (Toms) Winslow)—7 Mary, b 29, 2mo 1735, m Joseph Winslow (s of Joseph & wife Pleasant (Toms) Winslow)—8 Matthew, b 10, 3mo 1738, m Mary Robinson—9 Caleb, b 8, 3mo 1740, m Rebecca Toms (d of Francis (3) & wife Rebecca Nixon, d of Zachariah Nixon, & wife Elizabeth Symons of Pasq Co.) Rebecca White was b Jan 8, 1743.\n\nWhite, Thomas, will Perq, book C p 1, p Jan 1762. He bequeathed, to wife Rachel, a negro called Judah, & a negro girl Priscilla, a mare, called “Pink” and a horse, called “Sorrel,” 1 large looking glass, and 1 square table. Sons: Joshua, Thomas, Joseph, John, Matthew, Caleb, and Benjamin (not of age), dau’s Mary Winslow, (to whom he left a “large looking glass”) Sarah, gr-dau’s Sarah, & Mary Pritchard.\n\nWhite, Joshua, (eldest son of Thomas) will Perq, p Apl 25, 1784, names s Jacob, (to whom he left 125a of land, on both sides of Cypress Swamp) s Zachariah, s Joshua (Plan’ where I now live) dau’s Mourning, Mary, & Elizabeth, wife Mary. (His 2d wife probably) d Margaret Moore, & son-in-law Samuel Moore.\n\nWhite, Zachariah, will Perq, p Nov 1808, names legatees. Wife Miriam, dau’s Margaret, Mary Davis, s Joshua, dau’s Miriam, Sarah, s Francis.\n\nWhite, Jacob, s of Joshua (1) will Perq, p Nov 1816, named wife Miriam, sons: Josiah, Robinson, Theophilus, Joshua, dau’s Jemmimah Guyer, & Polly White.\n\nWhite, Joshua, (2) will Perq, p Feb 1831, names son James, wife Sallie, s Gabriel, s Theophilus.\n\nWhite, Joshua, (3) will Perq, p Nov 1865, Wife Emily, son Joshua W. (Warren) White, Millicent Pearce, Charles Willis Pearce, Mary A. Winslow.\n\nFrom this line sprang Dr White of Suffolk Va, who is a son of Joshua W. White, named in the last will. (See Jordan family, for Rachel Whites Will.)\n\nWhite, Mourning, spoken of in the Henry White line, as wife of John White, & mother Robert, (who m Rebeccah Albertson,) may have been a d of Joshua (1) & wife Gulielma. The Whites, & Winslows, crossed so many times, it is difficult to distinguish, one from another. Robert (s of John) died 25, 6mo 1830. This seems all the more to be credited, from the fact that Robert, & Rebeccah had a son named Jordan White, b 8, 9mo 1821, died 21, 6mo 1822.\n\nWhite, Joseph, (s of Joshua, & Rachel (Jordan) White) is mentioned in his will, but his age is not given. From the fact that five years intervened, between the date of Elizabeth, & Joshua Jordans ages, it is probable that he is the one between. Benjamin White also has no birth date, but we know from his fathers will, that he was the youngest child.\n\nWhite, Thomas, (twin to Rachel) m Anne Barnes, May 11, 1755, issue: 1 Miles, b Apl 25, 1756—2 Nathan, b Nov 12, 1757—3 Seth, b Mch 1, 1759—4 Orpha, b Sept 25, 1761—Elizabeth, b Oct 27, 1763—Jonathan, b Mch 2, 1766—Miriam, b Oct 25, 1768—d. s. p. 1831.

He made bequest to Dau’s Rebecca, & Elizabeth, “land at Moyock, in Currituck Co,” wife Elizabeth.\n\nJohn & Thomas Swann moved to Hyde County, where their descendants are now living. The county seat of Hyde, Swan Quarter, was probably named for this branch of the family.\n\n(3) Samuel Swann, was Speaker of the Assembly in 1715. Samuel Swann Gent, was sworn in by George Nichols, Att’ Gen’l, for the Counties of Currituck, Pasquotank, Perquimans, & Chowan, Oct 3, 1752.\n\nSamuel Swann, & son John were Exrs of the will of Thomas Snowden, p in Perq Oct 1736.\n\nOne of Maj Samuel Swanns dau’s m John Baptista Ashe, another m Frederick Jones, of Chowan County, Chief Justice of N. C. 1720.\n\nMajor Samuel Swanns record in Perq, is without a blemish. The family adhered faithfully to the faith of their fathers, & Samuel Swann was instrumental in establishing a Church according to his belief, the Church of England, believed to be “old Nags Head Chapel” which has long since disappeared. This Chapel, not far from his home, was still unfinished at his death, but it served the people of “Durants Neck” for many generations, finally falling into decay, it was turned over to the Methodist congregation, and it is said the present New Hope Church rests upon the old foundations of Nags Head Chapel. This Methodist Church, is the oldest in the county, so it seems. Here New Hope took root upon “old hope” buried in the past.\n\nAt the present time there is not a living representative of this influential family in Perq, the last to be found, being Samuel, who was dec’d June 13, 1771, without heirs. Like so many other families, once numerous in our county, they have drifted away, & only the records are a reminder that they at one time wielded a strong hand in the public affairs of this section.\n\nThe New Hanover Land Grants, in N. C. show that Samuel Swann, was grt 320a in said county, on East side of the road, from Wilmington, to Brunswick, below his line, Feb 23, 1754, and 300a on same day, same runnings, and 200a on Long Creek, all same date. Thus we see the Swann family continued to migrate ever southward. The Counties of Hyde, Beaufort, & New Hanover, would probably yield valuable information, about this splendid family.\n\nSource: History of Perquimans County by Ellen Goode Rawlings Winslow, (1931).\n\nNEWBY\n\nHenry Newby was transported to Va in Thomas, & John Jan 6, 1635. William Newby came from London to New England in Mary, & John Mar 24, 1633, age 24. (Hotten.) The records of Nansemond Co Va show that William Newby was a resident of said county 13, 10mo 1684, being at that date a member of “Chuckatuck” Mo Meeting, where he is found as a witness to a marriage, with wife Izabell. As neither of his three sons, had a wife by that name, and the name of Isobel came down in the family for several generations, among his descendants, it seems natural to suppose that this “Izabell” was William Newby’s wife. His sons named on Chuckatuck Reg, were Gabriel, who was the first to migrate to Perquimans, Nathan a Quaker minister about 1707, and Thomas, who is not named on the said Register, but is named in his brother Nathan Newby’s will, in Perq. From the records in Perq, it seems that Thomas remained in Isle of Wight Co Va, where his son (presumably) m Mary Pretlow. (Thomas 2.)\n\nThomas Newby is often called on the records in Perq, “Thomas Newby of Va.”\n\nNewby, William (1) and wife Izabell, had issue: 1 Gabriel, b — 1659, d—, 12mo 1735, m Mary Toms (d of Francis, & Pershillah) b April 27, 1670, married 10, 2mo 1689, issue: I William, b 13, 1mo 1690, m 1st Jean Bier (widow of Richard, née Loadman) July 3, 1701, m 2d Ann —? and had one son William, born after his death, about 1720.

(See Grimes Wills.) Samuel Newby m 2d Elizabeth Sanders (d of Benjamin & Ann) 1, 8mo 1740 issue: 1 Joseph, b Aug 10, 1741—2 William, b Dec 30, 1743—3 Ann, b Feby 5, 1745—4 Gabriel, b Feby 13, 1747—5 Mary, b Oct 16, 1749—6 Gideon, b Sept 15, 1751—7 Elizabeth, b Mch 16, 1756—8 Miriam, b Oct 16, 1757—9 Samuel, b Mch 25, 1761. It is thought that Samuel Newby had by 1st wife, Ann (supposed to be d of Edward Mayo) dau Jemima, who m her cousin William Newby (s of William, & Ann, b about 1720) Mary Newby née Clare (widow of Edward Mayo) in her will p Jan 1739, names gr-children: Edward, Jemima, & Isabell Newby, who appear to be the children of her “son-in-law” Samuel Newby, and these children are not named among the issue of Elizabeth née Sanders. (See above.)\n\nNewby, William, as seen died before 1720, and is not named in Gabriel Newby’s will p in Perq, Mar 1, 1735, but his son William received 300a from his gr-father, in equal division with the sons: Joseph, Jesse, & Samuel; Francis is named but no part allotted to him. He had probably had “set off to him” his share of his fathers Estate. No daughters are named in Gabriel Newby’s will, but he had three dau’s: Isabel, b 28, 10mo 1697—2 Mary, b 30, 11mo 1699—3 Miriam, b Dec 2, 1701, and a dau Elizabeth (no age given) who m John Nixon, and died 10, 7mo 1730, when John Nixon m 2d Mary—and 3d Hannah Albertson. (See Nixon family.)\n\nNewby, Gabriel (1) of “piquemons” d — 12mo 1735 age 76. His wife Mary née Toms died 2, 9mo 1738, age about 70 years.\n\nGabriel Newby in his will left to son Samuel his “maner plantation,” which was usually given the youngest son, for the better maintenance of the widow, and mother, the younger son usually being single.\n\nNewby, Joseph (1) Gabriel (1) William (1) m 1st Elizabeth Nixon, and 2d Mary née Clare, and had issue (according to his will, p in Perq Oct 1766) Sons: Gabriel, Joseph, Benjamin, and “poor decrepit son Josiah” whom he left “in care” of his other sons, wife Patience (widow Jordan, See Jordan) 3d wife whom he married in Isle of Wight Co Va 15, 12mo 1746. (Pagan Creek Mo Meeting.) Dau’s: Mary Thornton, Elizabeth Mayo (wife of Joseph)gr-son Joseph Thurston, gr-dau Mary Newby, Elizabeth Newby (wife of Francis, d of Matthew Jordan, & his last wife Patience) widow Jordan. Brother of Samuel, and son Gabriel Exrs.\n\nThree Joseph Newby’s appear in Perq practically at the same time, & this makes quite a bit of confusion, but the writer has turned the leaves of time over, & over to discover proof of each one, and still has some doubt, but of this last named Joseph, she is sure.\n\nJoseph Newby (unplaced) made his will in Perq, p April 21, 1735, and names no legatees, but wife Mary. As he left no heirs, he isn’t pertinent to this history anyway, so we will dismiss him.\n\nAnother Joseph, will p July 1752, wife Elizabeth, and dau Mary. This Joseph in the legal papers in Perq is called Joseph Jr, therefore it seems probable that he was son of Joseph Sr, and gr-son of Gabriel (1). He certainly could not have been son of Samuel, whose son Joseph, was born 1741, which would have made him only eleven years of age at the time this will was probated. It is thought that Joseph Newby (1) m Elizabeth Turner, (no date however) and had son Samuel who made his will 1737, and probably son Joseph Jr, but no proofs appear.\n\nJoseph Newby petitioned the Court Jan 1735 for permission “to build a Mill on Suttons Creek, for the public good.” His son Gabriel made the same request on same date “if my father doth not comply with the Law in Building a Mill on Suttons Creek” craved leave to finish it. A final audit of the Est of Joseph Newby, Dec 1777, shows that his son Gabriel died prior to this date. The heirs of Gabriel (2) dec’d were allotted £54, s2, p10½. Other heirs: Joseph, Benjamin, Mary Clary, heirs of Elizabeth Mayo dec’d, Mary Thornton, Dorothy Phelps (step-dau, and daughter of his last wife Patience, by her 1st husband Matthew Jordan of Isle of Wight Co Va. Dorothy m 1st Jonathan Phelps, and 2d John Skinner) Elizabeth, wife of Francis Newby (also step-dau), and one of the heirs being “dead without issue,” his part was divided between all the heirs. The supposition is that this dec’d heir was the “poor decrepit son Josiah,” as he is not mentioned in this division.\n\nMatthew Jordan (s of Matthew & Patience of Isle of Wight Co Va) will Perq, p July 1763, names “mother Patience Newby, and sisters Elizabeth Newby (wife of Francis) & Dorothy Skinner.” (The division of Jonathan Phelps shows that his wife was Dorothy, & loose papers give the fact that she m 2d John Skinner. She had by Jonathan Phelps sons: Jonathan, & Benjamin, and dau Dorothy. (See Phelps.)\n\nNewby, Benjamin (1) Joseph (1) Gabriel (1) William (1) m Sarah Lilly, 1, 3mo 1775.

(Minute book, & division of Estates.)\n\nThomas (1) Nathan (1) Wm Newby (1) m Sarah Scott (d of Joseph of Va) early in 1700, (date illegible). He is spoken of on records in Perq, as “Thomas Newby of Va.”\n\nAnn Scott of Vir, in a deed recorded in Perq, mentions her “nephew Exum Newby,” & apt’s him att’ to sell a place belonging to her in sd Co, called “Belvidere.” This estate is thought to be the same now called “the old Lamb place” across the River, from the town of Belvidere, & it is probable that the town derived its name from the adjoining plantation. Tradition has made it a fact. What relationship existed between Ann Scott, & Joseph, the records do not disclose, but this we do know; William Scott, of Nansemond Co, m Mourning Exum, & as the name of Exum continued to be carried down in the Newby, & allied families, in Perq Co, it seems more than probable, that Joseph Scott, was a son of said William. Mourning is also found as a given name of many of the ladies of the family. But as Thomas Newby did not make a will in Perq, no absolute proof can be found, to substantiate the fact.\n\nNathan Newby, lived over the “Causeway” at Bear Garden. He was one of the attendants of the “Ferry” over Perq River, to Phelps Point, & built the first “Goal” in Hertford. He was dead July 1735, “Mary Newby Relict.” She petitioned the Court July 1740, that “her tithables be taken off the main Road, to labour on the ferry Road, as it would be more convenient for her to ‘set over’ people and in that way ‘I shall get no Blame.’ ” The Causeway was at that time called “Newby’s Point” later called “Mary’s Point.” By Act of Assembly July 1755, a public “Ferry was Established, from Phelps Point, to Newby’s Point,” & Nathan (2) Newby was appointed “Ferryman” on his side, & Jonathan Phelps on his point. They were allowed the stipend of £4 per annum for their services. A ruling was made that they were to “Set over free; Inhabitants, of said Co, at Court times; Elections of Assemblymen; Vestry Elections; & Musters.”\n\nNathan Newby (2) Nathan (1) Wm Newby (1) m Keziah Pierce (d of Thomas) 6, 9mo 1752.

Robert Draper was transported in ship Jacob, by John Bainham 1624, age 16. (Researcher Mag.) Henrie Draper came in George 1621, age 14 years. Thomas Draper in Paule of London, July 16, 1635. Joseph Draper in Falcon, Apl 1635 Thomas Draper of Heptonstall Yorkshire, arrived in America 1647. Henry Draper was one among the living at Warrasqueake (Isle of Wight) Feb 16, 1623, when the census was taken after the Indian massacre, of May 22, 1622. (Hotten.)\n\nJoseph Draper was granted 232a of land in Nansemond Co Va, July 12, 1709 “in the Upper Parish, on Poters, and Basses pocoson,” and John Draper received a grant for 200a in same locality, July 18, 1709. He was transported to Norfolk Co Va, Mar 19, 1643, by Capt Thomas Willoughby. Richard Draper had 300a granted him, in Currituck Precinct, N. C. Oct 21, 1687, “on East side of North River, adj Robert Swaynes.” William Draper was a Tithable in Sunken Marsh Parish, Surry Co Va, 1675, and June 8, 1681. He moved to Pasquotank Precinct N. C. prior to 1704, when he conveyed 100a of land in said county, “which was granted George Cooper, June 24, 1704, and by him assigned to my father Charles Draper.” John Akehurst appeared as Att’ for John Damon Draper, “Citizen of London” and made release of land, 200a in Pasquotank Co, unto Robert Morgan, and wife Elizabeth, “on which James Williams now Dwells, called Burds folly, said Morgan agreeing to build on said land a dwelling house, 30ft long, by 15 ft wide, at his own cost, and maintain same.”\n\nThomas Draper m in Isle of Wight Co Va, Patience Denson (d of John, who names “dau Patience Draper” in his will, p in said Co, July 1, 1748) at Pagan Creek, 2, 6mo 1739. This Thomas was a son of Peter of Perquimans Co.\n\nDraper, Peter, first in Perquimans, came to N. C. from Nansemond Co Va, at what date is not known. He may have been a son of Joseph, or John of said county, but as the records of Nansemond were burned in 1867, very little of value can be derived from the county records. The Quaker records found there are however of the best, but unfortunately very little is said on those about the Draper family. Therefore it is problematical whether anything further can be unearthed about this family, in Nansemond county prior to their coming to Perquimans.\n\nDraper, Peter (1), of Perq, m Hannah Albertson (d of Peter, & Ann, née Jones, who was son of Albert Albertson, & wife Mary.
