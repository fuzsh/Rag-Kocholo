Her will July 24, 1676.\n\nJohn Winslow came to New England in the “Fortune” Nov 3, 1621, settled in Plymouth, Mass, and moved to Boston 1656. He was a prominent merchant, and large ship-builder. He had by wife Mary (Chilton), 1 Elizabeth, 2 John, who died 1731, m Abigail Atkinson (d of Theodore) June 18, 1689, issue: 1 Elizabeth, b April 23, 1692—2 John, b Dec 31, 1693, m Sarah Pierce Sept 21, 1721, died Oct 15, 1731—3 Judith, 4 Joseph (age not given) m Sarah Lawrence (d of Major Thomas Lawrence of New Town L. I.) Living in Perq Co N. C. 1677-79, where he served as “foreman of the Petit Jury” when acting Gov Thomas Miller was tried for treason, between the said dates. He is called in the Col Records of N. C. “another New England Traider.” The question naturally arises in the mind of any thinking person; would it not be the usual custom for a man of John Winslow’s wealth, a merchant and ship-builder, to fit out one of his own ships, with his own goods, and put his son Joseph in command as Captain? Certainly the ship he commanded “Traded” between the Ports of New England, and the ports of Carolina, or he would not have been designated as a “New Eng Traider.” This is, however, a moot point, for which no one has been able to find a satisfactory solution. Joseph Winslow, son of John, & Mary (Chilton) had two children whose ages are given in Savages Dictionary, prior to this date, and may we not, with some foundation, come to the conclusion that Thomas Winslow of Perq, who was of age in 1702, may have been his youngest son, probably born after his death, for Joseph Winslow died in New England 1679. In the absence of proof, we will leave that unsettled question to future generations for solving. No one could serve on a jury, in the Province of N. C. without being a resident of the colony, and having in their possession at least 100a of land, therefore we know he was living in the County, between 1677-79, and it is supposed he would naturally have his family here with him. He probably died in New England on one of his Trading trips. However this may be, we pass on to Thomas Winslow, first in Perq according to records still extant. John Winslow had a grant for land in New Kent Co Va 1669. As the records of New Kent have been destroyed by fire, no further mention of said John is made, but it is probable that he was ancestor of the Spotsylvania Winslows, and also the ones found in Essex Co Va, where a Thomas Winslow, with wife Ann, made a deed 1694. Although the writer has made diligent search in Virginia, for some connection between these Winslows, & the family who moved to Perq, no results have rewarded her efforts. The theory still clings that Joseph of New Eng, was the progenitor of the N. C. Winslows, and it seems the most plausible conclusion, in face of all the facts.\n\nThomas Winslow of Perq, proved his freedom “from Timothy Clare” in 1702. He was either an apprentice to said Timothy, or had been imported by him to the Province of N. C., for which he had to serve for a certain length of time. From the fact that he soon after this date m Elizabeth Clare (d of Timothy, & wife Mary (Bundy) we are led to believe he came of age at that time. The date of marriage can not be found. For some reason unknown to the writer the Winslows did not have their early marriages recorded, although there was an old record book kept by the Reg of Deeds in Perq, no Winslows appear therein. Therefore no dates can be furnished for them, until they became Quakers, which was not until said Thomas m Elizabeth Clare. The Winslows of New England were Episcopalians, and the supposition is that Thomas adhered to the same faith, & changed on arrival in Perq, from association with his wife’s family.\n\nThe will of Thomas Winslow, p in Perq, Jan 1745. Sons: Thomas, Timothy, John, Job, to whom he left “a plan’ in Pasq Co, near Newbegun Creek,” dau’s Elizabeth, & Miriam.\n\nAccording to legal papers in Perq, Thomas Winslow was m to Elizabeth Clear (who was b Feb 21, 1686,) before 1705.\n\nWinslow, Thomas (1) did not have a son Joseph, according to “Grimes,” but in N. C. Historical and Genealogical Reg, a variance is noted, which gives said Thomas, a son by that name, and the deeds in Perq make plain the fact that Joseph (1) was his son. There is also a difference in the dau’s mentioned in these two books, Grimes giving the dau’s as: Elizabeth, & Miriam, and Hathaway as: Elizabeth, & Christian. The writer is not up on the daughters, but she is morally certain that Thomas Winslow (1) had a son by the name of Joseph. A Thomas Winslow m Leah Smith (widow of Joseph), 1734. (See deeds Perq Co.) She was his widow soon after. Who this Thomas was, and where he stood in the line of the family, is an unsolved question.\n\n(1) Winslow, Joseph (thought to be eldest son of Thomas, & Mary (Bundy)) m Pleasant Toms, b 1710 (d of Francis, & Margaret (Bogue)) 22, 6mo 1729, she died 4, 1mo 1785. They had issue according to his will, p in Perq, Jan 1750; Sons: Joseph, to whom he left “land on Core Neck,” dau Lydia, “land at the head of Little River,” dau’s Miriam, & Mary, “land called Grassy Ridge,” wife Pleasant. (See deeds in this book for more information about this family.) Joseph Winslow, had a grt for land in Perq, 225a, granted at a Council in Edenton, Mar 11, 1740. He was living in Balahack, Jan 3, 1745-6 and bought of Samuel Newby 250a, adj “his own line” on that date.\n\n(a) Winslow, Joseph (2) Joseph (1) Thomas (1) m Mary White, (d of Thomas, & Rachel Jordan who were m in Isle of Wight Co 1719; Rachel Jordon d of Joshua, & Elizabeth Sanbourne, d of Daniel Sanbourne, & wife Sarah, of Isle of Wight Co Va, whose will was p in said Co, 16, 12mo 1711.)

Test’ John, & Mary Winslow (brother, & sister-in-law). Rachel (Wilson) Winslow m 2d Wm Townsend, by whom she had four children, m 3d John Williams. She is named in her fathers will, 1758, as “dau Rachel Townsend,” and in her son Obeds will as “mother Rachel Williams.” Her will p in Perq, July 1777, is an interesting document, and clears up many puzzles.\n\n(IV) Winslow, John, m Mary Pearson (d of Peter, & wife Rachel) 20, 7mo 1740, issue: 1 Josiah, 28, 7mo 1741—2 Miriam, b 9, 10mo 1743—3 Thomas, b 8. 1mo 1745/6—4 Samuel, b 10, 4mo 1748—5 Ruth, b 23, 7mo 1750/6—6 John, b 2, 9mo 1754.

C.\n\nTIMOTHY WINSLOW LINE\n\nWinslow, Jacob (1) Timothy (1) Thomas (1), m Elizabeth —? The ages of his children have not been found, although the Quaker records may hold them. A thorough search of these records, kept in the vault at Guilford College, might reveal much valuable data on the Winslow family, if they were open to the public, and one had plenty of time to examine them. However we have Jacob Winslows Will, which was p in Perq, Jan 1771, with his sons named as follows: William, Jacob (2) Obed, and dau’s: Mary, Millicent, Wife Elizabeth.\n\nNathaniel Welch in his will Perq, p 1789, names “daughter Elizabeth Winslaw, but as several Elizabeth Winslows appear in Perquimans county, it is not positive proof that this indicates the wife of Jacob. Besides, Jacob Winslows wife Elizabeth, died before this date, and it was not customary for a person to be named in a will, after death. Her will p in Perq, Jan 1785, names dau Mary Saunders, & Millicent Lamb (wife of Restore), sons: William, & Jacob, dau Betty. Benjamin Saunders, & Restore Lamb Exrs. Jacob Winslow lived in “Piney Woods” district, near the Chowan line, and his home, a quaint old residence with many wings, & cubby rooms, was still in use a few years ago, having descended through several generations to Mrs. Elisha Copeland, d of Francis, & Rachel Winslow (s of William Winslow, & wife Pleasant née White). The old rambling house after her death was demolished, and a new and more modern residence arose on the same site.\n\nWinslow (a) William (1) Jacob (1) Timothy (1) Thomas (1) m Pleasant White (d of John, & Lydia, née Winslow (d of Joseph, & Pleasant (née Toms) Winslow) 7, 3mo 1787, issue: Francis, m Rachel Newby (d of William, & Lydia —) and had issue: Francis (2) m Mary Tatum Jordan (d of Hezekiah, & Mary T.

Wife Pleasant, sons: Obed, Jacob, Francis, William, John, Josiah, dau’s: Liddy, Mary, & Elizabeth. Exrs, Caleb Winslow, Restore Lamb, Jacob Winslow, & Joseph Copeland. He lived on the edge of Perquimans, and his grand-son Francis (2) made his home in early married life at a place called “Snow Hill” just across the line in Perquimans. Here were born the four little boys, Edward, Tudor, Watson, & Cook, who took an active part in later life in the public affairs of said county. The Winslows are too numerous to trace out all the various family connections, in their many ramifications, and also there is not sufficient data, to make them clear, but this much is certain, both and all branches of this wonderful family, trace back to either Thomas (1) son of Joseph, or John (1) who is supposed to have been brother of said Thomas. Any one wishing to find the data relative to his or her own particular branch, should find no difficulty in tracing them on the splendid records in Perq, where every known Winslow figures at some time or other.\n\nExcursus.

This John m Esther Snelling (d of Israel, & Hannah, née “Larance.” d of William Lawrence, & “Rachell Welsh”) Hannah Snelling m 2d Timothy Clare, his 3d and last wife, by whom she had one dau Hannah. From this we see that John Winslow m the step-sister of Elizabeth Clare, who was the wife of Thomas Winslow. (See wills of Timothy Clare, 1724, and his last wife Hannah, 1726 (Grimes). John Winslow (brother of Thomas) will p in Perq, Jan 25, 1753, names sons: Benjamin, Israel, John, & Joseph, dau’s: Elizabeth, Hannah, & Esther, wife Esther.\n\nThe 2d John, whom it seems certain was nephew of John (1), made his will also in Perq Co, p July 1754, naming sons: Josiah, Thomas, & Samuel, dau Miriam, and wife Mary (d of Peter Pearson) therefore we make this distinction, so there will be no confusion of the two Johns, who come so close together. He has been classed as John Winslow (2) to distinguish him from his uncle, by the same name.?\n\nWinslow, Benjamin (1) John (1) m Rachel White (d of Thomas, & Rachel née Jordan) and had issue according to his will: (Nov 1794) Sons: Joseph, John, Jordan, and Benjamin (2) dau’s: Sarah, & Rachel. His wife is not named in his will, but she is mentioned in the will of her mother, whose will was located behind an old looking glass, by an antique dealer in Suffolk Va, a few years past. This will is very interesting, but unfortunately is not dated, or signed, positive proof however can be found in the fact that she names the identical children in her will, that her husband Thomas White does in his 1762, p in Perq. (See Perq records.) Mr. Alonza Winslow of Winfall N. C. is a direct descendant of this line of the Winslow family, but the writer has not the data to trace his line.\n\nWinslow, Joseph, was grt 225a in Perq, Mar 6, 1740/1. (Col Rec, Vol 4, p 588.)\n\nWinslow, Timothy, was grt 540a in Perq, Nov 17, 1743. His wife Rachel née Wilson, m 2d William Townsend, and 3d John Williams. (See Townsend, & Wilson.)\n\nWinslow, Henry, came to Perq Co, from London about 1740/1. He made petition to the Court Mar 11, 1740/1 for possession of 3333a of land in Perq, called “Birkswear” formerly grt George Catchmaid, & conveyed to sd Winslow. He had no descendants in Perq apparently.\n\nSource: History of Perquimans County by Ellen Goode Rawlings Winslow, (1931).\n\nTOMS\n\nAfter much careful work on this family, in N. C. and Virginia, the writer has arrived at the conclusion, that the Toms emigrant, to N. C., was living in Charles City Co Va, where he sold land in sd County, to Francis Gray, Feb 17, 1656. Only mention of him, so far found, but that is not strange, considering the fact, that nothing remains of the records in that Co, except one book. Gabriel Toms appears on the records in Essex Co Va, but no connection between the two, can be made. However, there may have been, some relationship. It is thought, but not proven, that the Francis who settled in Perq, is the identical one, who is named in sd record, as the dates would bear me out, in that opinion. From Edmundson’s Journal, we are led to believe, that he did not embrace Quakerism, until the time of Edmundson’s first journey to N. C. 1672. At which time, he & his wife, Mary (d of John Nicholson, sister of William) went over to the new cult. Mary being his 3d wife, by whom he had no issue. Her will p in Perq, 1717, does not name a single one of his children. She was probably a widow before m Francis Toms, as she names in her will, Vesty Lewis, who was wife of Edward Lewis, & probably her daughter.\n\nFrancis Toms, m before coming to Perq, Pershillah — by whom he had issue: Penelope, b Jan 27, 1670—Francis (2), b Sept 19, 1672—Pershillah, b Mch 19, 1674/5—Joseph, b Nov 16, 1677, died June 6, 1679—Caleb, & Joshua (twins), b Nov 25, 1679.\n\nToms, Francis, m 2d Abigail Lury (widow of John) Jan 6, 1683, by whom one d Abigail, b Dec 10, 1684. Abigail Toms, Wife of Francis, died Mar 17, 1687.†\n\nToms, Francis, m 3d Mary Nicholson, who survived him.\n\nToms, Francis Sr, lived near “Lower Pond, on Reedy Branch, at the head of Vosses Creek.” His land adj John Flowers, on western side of “Long Reach” in the “Narrows” of Perq River. The land on Vosses Creek, where his dwelling was erected, adj William Morgan. He had a stretch of land, running from Vosses Creek, to “Middle Swamp” called “Frog Hall.” This place still retains its original name, to this day. Francis Toms Jr owned land on S. W. side of Perq River, on “Bull Branch, adj land sold to Henry Grace, June 24, 1714. His land also joined land of William Jones. Francis Toms Sr, made a deed of gift, to Thomas Pierce, Wm Bogue, Isaac Wilson, & Gabriel Newby, 1a of land, “for the Society of Protestant Desenters, Vulgarly called Quakers, whereon a Church is now built,” in Perq Precinct, 11mo called Jan, 1705/6. This house of Worship, is supposed to have been Vosses Creek Meeting house, on said Creek, the exact location, being lost and uncertain. He was a member of the Council, for many years (see deeds). Clerk of Pasq Precinct Aug 8, 1692 (see will of John Nixon). Dept’ to Lord Amey, & his name appears on many grants given by the Lords Pro’r. His oath before the Gov Council, is of interest, to all historians, in its quaint wording, he promised “to Keepe ye Secrett of ye Council, to ye best of my advice, according to my Understanding.” This oath was administered in 1706. He had been a member of the Council, since Feb 6, 1683/4. Francis Toms “Collector of Customs” (no date).\n\nOn 15, 7mo 1696, he left Perq, on a two months journey (probably to London) but his business is not stated, maybe in the interests of the Quaker Church. Before leaving, he deputized “Wm Glover, his Lov’ Friend, to get timber for a big Mill, or a little one, & left it wholely to him, which thee thinks most benificall for me.” This was probably the beginning of Toms Mill, on Suttons Creek, in fact if his land ran to Middle Swamp, as before stated, & sd place was called even then, “Frog Hall” we are certain the “Mill” here mentioned, was built on this property. He made a deed, Feb 9, 1688, with consent of wife Abigail, for 300a at the head of Yeopim Creek, “called John Lasy’s Plan’,” land pat by Wm Charles, June 6, 1683. Another deed Jan 5, 1689/90, with the signature of his last wife Mary. In a deed Mar 24, 1687, he gives the information, that he had been grt 587a in Perq Precinct. (See deeds.)\n\nThe Hon’ble Francis Toms, had a grt, in Perq Pr’ct, 640a, adj Capt Ralph Fletcher, & James Morgan, to corner of Wm Voss, & along his line to the River (Perquimans). May 1, 1695. Francis Toms Esq, another grt, in Perq Pre’ct 375a on North side of Perq River, by beaver dam Swamp.

This may be the same Sarah, for whom Foster Toms put in a claim, for her Estate, in 1754.

Wills, p 368, which was p April 20, 1708. He bequeathed to s William “a Bible, & seal ring,” to sons: Sampson, Henry, & Thomas, “land between Muddy Creek, & Marshy Gutt” sons: Samuel, & John, dau’s Elizabeth, & Sarah; wife Elizabeth.\n\nHenry Swann of Perq, Merchant: apt’ Mr William, & Thomas Swann his Att’ Sept 21 1709.\n\nThomas Swann of Pasq Co, conveyed 127a in sd Co, “to his cousin Wm Drummond of Vir, to him & his heirs forever” Oct 18, 1726. (Pasq County Records.)\n\nSamuel Swann of Perq was dec’d 1704. Mary widow & Admix. (Col Rec Vol I.) This could not be Maj Samuel’s son, as he names a son Samuel in his will, 1708. If the Samuel who died 1704, left any issue, there is no record of it in Perq.\n\n(3) Samuel (s of Maj Samuel & Sarah née Drummond) m Mary — (Widow Vail) issue: Mary, b Mch 5, 1726/7, m Richard Clayton—2 Sarah, b Sept 3, 1729—3 Samuel, b Dec 8, 1731.\n\nSamuel Swann (3) will Perq, p April 1753, names his dau Mary “wife of Richard Clayton,” to whom he left “land on the Sound side,” other dau’s Sarah, Ann, Elizabeth, Martha, Jane, Margaret.

Sons: Samuel, & William. He made bequest to Dau’s Rebecca, & Elizabeth, “land at Moyock, in Currituck Co,” wife Elizabeth.\n\nJohn & Thomas Swann moved to Hyde County, where their descendants are now living. The county seat of Hyde, Swan Quarter, was probably named for this branch of the family.\n\n(3) Samuel Swann, was Speaker of the Assembly in 1715. Samuel Swann Gent, was sworn in by George Nichols, Att’ Gen’l, for the Counties of Currituck, Pasquotank, Perquimans, & Chowan, Oct 3, 1752.\n\nSamuel Swann, & son John were Exrs of the will of Thomas Snowden, p in Perq Oct 1736.\n\nOne of Maj Samuel Swanns dau’s m John Baptista Ashe, another m Frederick Jones, of Chowan County, Chief Justice of N. C. 1720.\n\nMajor Samuel Swanns record in Perq, is without a blemish. The family adhered faithfully to the faith of their fathers, & Samuel Swann was instrumental in establishing a Church according to his belief, the Church of England, believed to be “old Nags Head Chapel” which has long since disappeared. This Chapel, not far from his home, was still unfinished at his death, but it served the people of “Durants Neck” for many generations, finally falling into decay, it was turned over to the Methodist congregation, and it is said the present New Hope Church rests upon the old foundations of Nags Head Chapel. This Methodist Church, is the oldest in the county, so it seems. Here New Hope took root upon “old hope” buried in the past.\n\nAt the present time there is not a living representative of this influential family in Perq, the last to be found, being Samuel, who was dec’d June 13, 1771, without heirs. Like so many other families, once numerous in our county, they have drifted away, & only the records are a reminder that they at one time wielded a strong hand in the public affairs of this section.\n\nThe New Hanover Land Grants, in N. C. show that Samuel Swann, was grt 320a in said county, on East side of the road, from Wilmington, to Brunswick, below his line, Feb 23, 1754, and 300a on same day, same runnings, and 200a on Long Creek, all same date. Thus we see the Swann family continued to migrate ever southward. The Counties of Hyde, Beaufort, & New Hanover, would probably yield valuable information, about this splendid family.\n\nSource: History of Perquimans County by Ellen Goode Rawlings Winslow, (1931).\n\nLEIGH\n\nAgnes De Leigh dau of Richard De Leigh, great gr-son of Hamon, Lord of High Leigh, temp Henry II.
