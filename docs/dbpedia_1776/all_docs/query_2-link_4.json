Like militaries in many other countries, it has been called on to control, dispel, and end protest both in the United States and abroad. People who participate in the military are less likely than civilians to take part in protest.1 Therefore, an examination of military community members who take on identities as protestors, especially peace protestors, is a study in contradictions. Thousands of U.S. military servicemembers, veterans, and their families protested the Iraq War; they not only managed this identity incongruity but also used this perceived inconsistency to their advantage.2 Like them, I also lived and utilized this contradiction. When I met my husband, he was a bookstore clerk using the GI Bill from his service in the U.S. Army Reserve to pay for college, and I was a graduate student examining and taking part in peace protest. Before we met, David had committed himself to over a decade of more military service by applying to transition from his nearly complete Army Reserve service to becoming an active duty naval aviator. As he became an officer I helped organize protests in Santa Barbara, California, against the impending and, then, the existing Iraq War. During our early years the contradictions of our chosen paths as a war protestor and an elite military asset seemed insurmountable and even caused a brief breakup. We grew intellectually and personally from our supposed contradictions, however, developing nuanced ideas about war, peace, and service. Moving from California, where I was surrounded by overwhelmingly left-leaning and antiwar friends and colleagues, to a military base near Pensacola, Florida, provided further lessons in understanding\n\n|\n\nxi\n\nFIGURE 1.\n\nTim Kahlor speaks in Santa Barbara, California, on December 10, 2006, at the Honor the Warrior, End the War rally.

My perspective on American foreign policy alienated me from many of the formal and informal family support groups, so that summer of 2004, I scoured the Web looking for others in the military community who were outspoken in their opposition to the Iraq War. I found and joined Military Families Speak Out (MFSO). At first, I had no interaction with them, as there was little infrastructure to the organization and no active members in my area. In search of local allies, I volunteered with Panhandle for Kerry, where I worked alongside Vietnam War veterans and a Coast Guard spouse to elect Senator John Kerry as president of the United States. When Elizabeth Edwards, wife of Democratic vice-presidential candidate John Edwards and the daughter of a naval aviator, came to Pensacola, I was asked to introduce her and to sit on a panel with her because of my military-spouse status. She appointed me to a whirlwind speaking tour of the country as a national spokesperson for the Kerry/ Edwards 2004 campaign. During what was referred to as the “Moms on a Mission” tour, I participated with mothers and wives of American\n\nxii\n\n|\n\nPREFACE\n\nservicemembers in town hall meetings, political rallies, and media events aimed at questioning President George W. Bush’s policies in the Iraq War and for the military. In October the tour brought me into contact with the first MFSO activists I met, Stacey Bannerman, the wife of a National Guard soldier who was at that time in Iraq, and Lietta Ruger, the mother-in-law of an Iraq War veteran with numerous other family connections to the military. During the campaign I was fascinated with the deference both conservatives and liberals gave to military veterans and families and thus decided to focus my research on members of the military community who questioned the Iraq War. Studying the military peace movement afforded me a way to stay sane while facing the enormous pressures of military deployments, the book process, and the job market. While my close friends never saw me as holding onto contradictions as a peace activist and a military spouse, strangers and acquaintances sometimes questioned my loyalty to one group or the other, suggesting I had to choose between my love for and support of military members and my antiwar sentiments. It is this seeming contradiction of identity and its role in social movements that this book explores. EXAMINING A COMPLEX SUBJECT\n\nThe seemingly conflicted existence of this movement and the constantly shifting realities of social movements lend themselves to ethnographic methods. In this book I draw on intensive participant observation from 2006 to 2008, followed by continued attendance at major movement events and observation from a distance via online technologies through 2012.3 My data include ethnographic fieldnotes from a variety of protest events and organizational meetings in every region of the United States, in-depth interviews with participants and leaders in the movement, a qualitative follow-up survey with participants in 2011, and thousands of organizational and media materials on the movement. The fluidity offered by participant observation, in-depth interviewing, and qualitative content analysis is well suited to the study of deviant cases that are absent from mainstream discussions of the military and past research on this subject. In-depth analysis of those who differ from expectations of much of society and\n\nPREFACE\n\n|\n\nxiii\n\nwho embody both sides of a dichotomy, such as peace/war or male/ female, pushes us to grapple with the complexity of the lived experience whereby the two sides of a dichotomy come to be understood as ideal types that are never as separate as we imagine. Ethnography allowed me to enter this research without presupposing who the players in the military peace movement were. I immersed myself in peace movement protest and materials on this movement to discover what military identity–based organizations and individuals were involved in peace activism. From the sheer numbers of people in these organizations, the presence of these organizations on speakers’ lists and at other events, and the repeated references to them in the media, I determined that MFSO, Veterans for Peace (VFP), Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW), and Gold Star Families for Peace (GSFP)/Gold Star Families Speak Out (GSFSO) operated as the primary homes for the military community within the peace movement. Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) was also a visible player (though not as visible or integrated with the others as VFP), but since most of the members of that organization I observed were also involved with VFP, I limited my interviews with veterans from past wars to VFP. As I describe in chapter 1, while other military peace movement organizations and some prominent members of the military community critiqued the war, most existed outside the broader peace movement entirely, and many did not directly oppose the war. Many others operated only in a locality, and a few organizations were only one or two individuals who operated a website. In addition to providing space for me to locate the major forces in the movement, the flexibility built into ethnography also allowed me to shift focus as one organization, GFSP, largely died and another, GSFSO, arose. My use of an ethnographic extended case method analysis pushed me to pay close attention to the context in which actors moved, and for understanding the military peace movement, context is key.4 Not only was the movement surrounded by a country deeply divided over a war, but these people navigated their way through two very different landscapes in the peace movement and the military. These subjects were pushed and pulled by their competing loyalties and the intensive demands of war deployments and postwar reintegration. I captured personal narratives describing the navigation of competing\n\nxiv\n\n|\n\nPREFACE\n\nidentities by recording speeches at movement events and through informal questioning of activists in the course of observation and thirty semistructured interviews with movement activists.5 I also used a primarily qualitative online survey with fifty-six respondents to follow up with activists to examine the ongoing effects of the wars in 2011 and the changes in antiwar activism of these military veterans and families.6 Since military peace movement activities often operated simultaneously in numerous locations and since I was unable to be at every event or interview all activists, I used thousands of pages of media and movement materials to provide a more complete picture of the movement, including transcriptions of speeches, blog posts, videos of events, poems, books by movement activists, emails from movement leaders, organizational newsletters, website materials, and press releases.7 Although imperfect in other ways, these documents allowed me to overcome some of the limitations inherent in the subjective nature of qualitative research. I do not use pseudonyms in this book. When I name activists, it is largely because they gave me permission to identify them. Most activists prefer that the world know who they are and what they stand for. Other names that I use are from public actions that one can easily find information about in the media or on the Web; these activists gave their information to journalists and crowds freely, so I use their names. Each person who agreed to a formal interview gave permission for the use of his or her name and likeness. What might get lost, though, are the several hundred unnamed activists whose individual statements or actions are described in this book. These people are referred to in ways that do not reveal their identity, often by their military branch and their rank or affiliation (e.g., Air Force mom or Marine sergeant). When I have other nonunique details, I use phrases such as “a young Army wife” or “a National Guard soldier from Michigan.” Recounting the experiences of these unnamed actors provides a lay perspective that may be different from those of the leadership or of full-time activists, whose names appear in print. I believe it is important to include those activists I encountered only once in my eight years of ethnographic research, and including details from events and meetings I attended, as well as materials given to me by organizations or available on the Web, provides a richer picture of this movement. It\n\nPREFACE\n\n|\n\nxv\n\nwas impossible, however, to obtain informed consent from many of these people, and I do not use names or identifying information unless an action was public or I have permission.8 THE MOVEMENT AND I\n\nAs a participant-researcher I was given nearly complete access to movement materials and events. My personal experiences straddling the two worlds of the military and peace activism informed my questions about and investigation into these organizations. While this research was certainly not “autoethnography,” my identity as a military spouse granted me knowledge of the military and its culture, and this allowed me easy access to and increased rapport with movement subjects.9 Emotional movement activities were personally draining, however, and often made it difficult to summon the additional energy for writing fieldnotes and/ or conducting interviews. I avoided leadership positions in the movement until I was done with most of the data collection, but I spoke occasionally to the press or addressed crowds. Although I tried to limit my impact on the movement, my actions did influence the direction and outcomes of movement strategies and tactics. I attempt to offer an objective analysis of the military peace movement, but like the other members of this movement, I believed my activism was necessary because the lives and souls of my loved ones were at stake. Like most members of the movement, the other people in these organizations became a part of my wider family. I took late-night calls from stressed-out parents and spouses, and I sat through the night with veterans traumatized by the war and with their families who worried about them. Since the movement concerns were also personal concerns, I was rarely able to escape the war and its consequences. I shared activists’ fear, guilt, anger, pride, and joy. Some days, I could not stop crying while I wrote this book, and I had a very hard time coming out of the field. It was painful to stop engaging with the peace movement at the level I had from 2003 to 2008 because the wars continued taking the lives and health of friends and family. Similar to the subjects of this book, I wrestled with the public perception of the seeming contradiction in being both an antiwar\n\nxvi\n\n|\n\nPREFACE\n\nprotestor and connected to the military, so on Veteran’s Day November 17, 2006, at a candlelight vigil in Santa Barbara, I gave a speech describing how I combined my activism and my military family identity. The crowd of fewer than two hundred gathered around the memorial discussed in chapter 5. I am asked regularly how someone could be both an antiwar protestor and connected to the military, and some readers, as well, may have a hard time understanding how the two could go together. As I described that night: I often feel that I am straddling two worlds. When I am with my colleagues or with members of the general peace movement, lots of people want to know how I, someone who is seen as an advocate for peace, can be married to someone in the military. . . . While the Army Reserves helped David pay for college life, when he became an officer it was because he has always wanted to fly, which is an expensive dream. David believes in the ability of the U.S. military to do good in the world, and like me he hopes it could be used to end human rights abuses not perpetrate them. . . . It is important that we distinguish those in the military from those that have made the horrific decisions to use indiscriminate weapons against civilians and to invade and occupy countries. When I am with other military spouses or others my husband serves with, people wonder how I can protest this war. . . . I ask you how, given the stakes with my beautiful husband and friends on the line, I could not protest this war? . . . Our military has done all that was asked of it, but the plans of this war were shot from the beginning. . . . If he doesn’t make it home, I will be stuck correcting people who tell me he died a hero. I will have to say, “No, he died for lies and greed.” If he makes it home, he will forever have to live with the knowledge that he killed people—again, for lies and greed. I am proud to be both a peace activist and a military spouse. I am working to make the U.S. a country that treats its military better and that involves being a more peaceful country ourselves. Support for the troops is not a yellow magnet on a car and ignorance about this war. No, real support for the troops involves making sure that we only send troops when it is truly necessary, not when it is politically or economically expedient.\n\nPREFACE\n\n|\n\nxvii\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Military Peace Movement\n\nI\n\nn response to a 2011 survey, veterans and military families who considered themselves antiwar activists bemoaned the United States’ continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They pointed to a divide between the military community and the civilian populace as a reason for the wars’ continuation. Larry Syverson, whose three sons served six deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, explained the wars’ impact on his family: Because of the stress generated by deployment, my wife had a difficult time working while our sons were deployed. As a result, before our youngest son’s second deployment to Iraq, she took early retirement. It is the only way she has been able to deal with multiple deployments. Our youngest son was recently divorced. It was a result of his recurring PTSD [posttraumatic stress disorder]. His wife would not accept the mental problems he was having. Twice he has been admitted to a psychiatric ward. It was after the second admission that they were divorced.\n\nAs Syverson explained, both military servicemembers and their families were emotionally and psychologically devastated by the wars. Like Syverson, many in the military blamed the wars for marital, employment, and other social consequences. What separated Syverson from many in the military was, however, that he had long engaged in protest of the American-led Iraq War that began in 2003 and, later, of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. Syverson was quoted in dozens of media outlets, spoke at rallies, and marched in many of the major East Coast protests, but the action that gave him the most pride was his vigil in front of the Richmond, Virginia, federal courthouse, where he held signs that displayed pictures of his sons and messages such as “Iraqi Oil Isn’t Worth My Sons’\n\n|\n\n1\n\nFIGURE 2.\n\nMembers of the military peace movement pose for a picture after five hundred of them marched from their national convention near the convention center to the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 19, 2007. Photograph by the author.\n\nBlood.” He explained, “I protested over two hundred times. For many, including the newspaper, I was the face of the antiwar movement in Richmond. I felt—I hope—I influenced other Richmond residents’ views of the wars.” Syverson believed that people paid attention to his view of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan because he was a military parent. Like Syverson, most veterans and military families in the anti– Iraq War movement intended to bring the war home to Americans, who were largely unaffected by these wars because the country had an all-volunteer force (AVF) that comprised less than one-half percent of the overall population. Activists believed this personalization helped turn the tide of public opinion in the United States against the Iraq War. Many activists point to the summer 2005 media storm that was generated when many veterans and military families held a vigil outside President George W. Bush’s ranch in Crawford, Texas. For one month that summer, while the president vacationed, White House media\n\n2\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncorrespondents were restless, and this protest, led by the mother of a nineteen-year-old soldier who died in Iraq, offered a counterpoint to coverage of the president’s policies.1 Newspapers across the United States and around the globe described the protest, even on their front pages, and the twenty-four-hour news networks made it a part of their daily news loops. The mother, Cindy Sheehan, demanded a meeting with President Bush so that she could ask him for “what noble cause” her son, Casey, died.2 She set up camp in a roadside ditch and, later, on donated rural property, where she and other activists waited for that meeting. The vigil supporting this request brought over ten thousand people throughout the month to the small rural town of Crawford. Most who came supported Sheehan and stayed multiple days, living in primitive camping conditions on the side of the road leading to the ranch.3 These people, many of whom were veterans and military families, developed a sophisticated system for not only feeding and sheltering each other but also working with the media and getting messages out to supporters across the country. Bumper stickers and T-shirts supporting the vigil cropped up in peace movement communities across the country, with sayings such as “What Noble Cause?” or “Texas Is Bush Cindy Country,” and the protest became known as Camp Casey in honor of Sheehan’s son. Although the media attention focused on one woman, Sheehan—using the trope of the grieving mother—the vigil was the product of hundreds of veterans and military family members who interacted with each other within the peace movement.4 Like the leading figures of all movements, Sheehan was linked into and supported by thousands of individuals, many with their own stories of grievances and activism. This 2005 protest in Crawford and the resulting media coverage was a watershed moment for this movement. While Sheehan did not achieve her immediate goal, a face-to-face meeting with President Bush, this vigil succeeded in electrifying the peace movement and obtaining media coverage for antiwar sentiments, which had been lacking since the start of the war. In addition, the vigil brought together veterans of the current wars, veterans of past wars, families of dead military servicemembers, and families of current servicemembers who were all critical of the Iraq War. Before the media coverage of the Sheehan vigil, many of these people were unaware of other military-connected\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n3\n\nindividuals who were willing to protest the Iraq War. Most activists involved in this protest described the Crawford protests as an important time for building a sense of community within this section of the peace movement and strengthening ties between the military antiwar organizations. Although I do not have the data to determine whether the sagging polls on the war that followed the vigil were directly attributed to this event and/or the involvement of veterans and military families in the antiwar movement more broadly, the timing allows for such conjecture.5 Thousands of military-affiliated people critiqued the war through activities such as media interviews, public presentations, marches, encampments, memorial displays, and street theater. The involvement of veterans and military families in the anti–Iraq War movement in part grew out of established veterans’ peace organizations, but Iraq War veterans and their families also created new organizations. The veterans and military families who worked with each other inside the broader peace movement from 2002 to 2013 comprised what I call the Iraq War military peace movement. This subsection of the wider peace/antiwar movement distinguished itself from the broader movement by focusing on activists’ identities that connected them to the military. While the Iraq War generated numerous critics, few spoke with the authority or garnered the media attention of American veterans and military family members. These activists’ visibility challenged the widespread assumption that military veterans and families unquestioningly supported the Iraq War, and media outlets covered these activists disproportionately to their numbers. In fact, such deference was given to the military community that in a column for the New York Times Maureen Dowd described them as having “moral authority” when speaking about the Iraq War.6 The involvement of veterans and military families in antiwar protest was both novel and significant for the peace/antiwar movement. Activists attempted to reframe popular debates around patriotism and troop support and to mobilize bystanders by calling attention to their military identities. As such, activists used their identities strategically to challenge hegemonic ideas about the war. By 2010, however, much of this movement was frustrated that the attention generated by the Crawford protests and subsequent tactical\n\n4\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nrepertoires had dissipated. Activists in the military peace movement were facing issues related not only to reintegration into civilian life, war wounds, and war deaths but also to new and continuing deployments. According to Department of Defense (DoD) figures, as of March 2011 over 110,000 troops remained in and around Afghanistan; over 90,000 were in and around Iraq; and over 100,000 additional personnel were stationed aboard various ships, many in supporting roles for these wars.7 While the deployments continued, the recession that began in December 2007 reduced personal, foundational, and other resources from which activists could draw. Although polls from 2010 to 2012 showed that few Americans were concerned by the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan, these wars continued to dictate military families’ lives.8 While troops officially withdrew from Iraq at the end of 2011, U.S. involvement and anticipation of conflicts related to the global war on terror kept up the quick deployment pace and the strain on military families. Without support from foundations or the public, one of the military peace movement organizations closed its main operations in 2013, but during that summer the United States had over ten thousand military contractors still in Iraq, over one hundred thousand contractors in Afghanistan, and over sixty thousand uniformed servicemembers in Afghanistan.9 In various polls, military veterans and families were asked whether most American civilians understood the sacrifices made by military servicemembers and their families, and nearly all believed they did not. My 2011 survey of military peace movement activists mirrored that answer. Most said something similar to Debbie Caruth, the mother of an Army soldier who served four tours in Iraq: “No! No one understands.” Like the wife of Larry Syverson, Caruth suffered serious psychological consequences from the stress of these multiple deployments, and so did her son. Syverson, who in 2011 was the chairman of the board of directors of the antiwar organization Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), expounded on the isolation that many military families felt: Because such a small number of troops are being subjected to multiple deployments, the effects of the war directly impact an extremely small group of Americans. I don’t think the other 99 percent have any idea\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n5\n\nwhat the 1 percent of us that deal with these multiple deployments are going through over and over and over. My three sons have had six deployments: five Iraq and one Afghanistan. . . . We need to continue to link the wars with the economy. The public doesn’t care about our loved ones being deployed. But they do care about their pocketbooks and government programs. I hate having to do it, but it appears that is the only way to get many people’s attention.\n\nAlthough their personal stories initially attracted media attention to the problems of the Iraq War, 2011 had little to no media coverage of either that war or the Afghanistan War.10 The military peace movement was tired and struggling with the long-term consequences of the wars, but the issues that had brought them together in 2003 had only gotten worse as servicemembers came home to face a backlogged and ineffective Department of Veterans Affairs. For example, Joan Najbar, a mother of an Iraq War soldier, said: Reintegration after extended warfare is complete hell for soldiers and families. For National Guard soldiers and their families, you are without support services. As a result, deployment and reintegration are very isolating experiences. Most community members are disconnected and ignorant about the realities of war. As a result, “unknowingly” many community members say hurtful things without any understanding of modern warfare and deployment. As a result, soldiers and family members feel even more isolated, because the American public lacks real compassion. The following is a list of comments said to myself and other moms of deployed soldiers: “I know just how you feel [having a loved one deployed] because my son is away at college.” “You need to get over it.” “So do you talk to your sons every day when he’s deployed?” “Is it true that the guys on the front lines in the war have low IQs?” This was actually said to me by a mental health coworker: “I bet they all have personality disorders.” . . . This makes even the process of reconnecting in your community even harder because Americans totally don’t have even the most basic understanding of the human impact of war. . . . Most citizens, politicians, and the press regard war as some kind of Disneyland experience. This disconnect makes feelings of pain and isolation even worse. It’s as if we\n\n6\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nexist in some parallel universe and we are the people that carried the burden of these wars while Americans watched reality TV. So I find the lack of connection, the detachment, to be a bizarre commentary on our culture: our culture which has been comfortable with 1 percent of our nation carrying the burden of war for ten years. It’s very cruel.\n\nNajbar expressed the heartache of many in the military peace movement. While most Americans believed the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War were drawing to a close, for veterans and military families the wars and their long-term consequences remained a grueling part of everyday life. The military peace movement hoped to showcase the consequences veterans and military families faced in order to personalize the wars and encourage opposition to them. The military peace movement played an important role in shaping public opinion to oppose and question policies in Iraq and Afghanistan. This book focuses on the development, maintenance, tactics, and strategies of this movement. I describe how identity and emotion are factors both in the internal workings of social movements and for movements’ external actions and consequences. My focus on identity not only highlights micromobilization and solidarity processes but also illuminates how movements frame their arguments and interact with bystanders. By exploring this intriguing movement, I demonstrate the critical importance of identity and emotion for all major aspects of social movements. Examination of this particular movement also provides insight into the divide between the military and civilians in the United States, as well as the relationship between warfare and peace activism. THE MILITARY AND PEACE MOVEMENT CONTEXT\n\nAmericans often award veterans and their families an elevated social position, which has been particularly true during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.11 In its development during the Iraq War, the modern military peace movement combined cultural and structural elements of both the military community and the American peace movement. As such, it is important to understand the historical and the cultural contexts of that war and of the U.S. military and the U.S. peace movement.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n7\n\nThe Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\nAlthough the military peace movement developed largely in response to the 2003–11 Iraq War, the Afghanistan War played an increasingly important role in the movement, and by 2009 all organizations in the movement had developed positions against it. Though these two wars are conceptually and tactically distinct, their timelines overlap (as seen in the appendix), and many people in the military served in both wars. Despite lengthy American military involvement in these countries, both Iraq and Afghanistan are considered failed states and have high levels of economic instability, infrastructure failures, outmigration, corruption, and violence, and in both countries governmental leaders are regularly accused of using the military and police to intimidate or eliminate political rivals. Whereas the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan had widespread international and domestic support for its mission of countering terrorism and retaliating against the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), the Iraq War had less support for its rationale and was more contentious at home and abroad. The al-Qaeda suicide attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center and the downed flight in Pennsylvania killed nearly three thousand people, heightened patriotic fervor in the United States, and brought increased international denouncement of the Islamic terrorist organization al-Qaeda, which was believed to be responsible for those attacks and others against Americans. President Bush demanded that Afghanistan’s governmental leadership, the Taliban, hand over the alQaeda leaders, who were staging attacks from rural areas of Afghanistan. When the Taliban refused, America began airstrikes on October 7, 2001, starting a war that was aided primarily by forces from the United Kingdom and the Afghan Northern Alliance fighters. Although the majority of cities were captured by these forces and a new government was put into place by summer 2002, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, with the United States continuing to provide most troops and services, battled against Taliban and other fighters for over a decade. Although Afghanistan began holding presidential and parliamentary elections in 2004 and 2005, respectively, the elected government continued to battle Taliban forces for control of the country, particularly in rural areas. Troop levels and U.S. casualty\n\n8\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nnumbers were limited in Afghanistan until President Obama dramatically increased troop levels in 2010, hoping to stabilize the country. By the fall of 2013, American troops remained in Afghanistan, battling largely guerrilla-style attacks from various groups. In his January 29, 2002, State of the Union address, President Bush declared Iraq part of an “axis of evil” that aided terrorists and sought “weapons of mass destruction” (WMDs) to use against the United States.12 For a little more than a year, his administration built a case against Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, and the U.S. Congress authorized a war in Iraq that began on March 20, 2003. The lack of an attack by Hussein’s government on the United States before the war led many to label this war a preemptive attack, and the legality of this war has since been challenged in the United States and abroad. As in Afghanistan, American and coalition forces were able to obtain a quick victory over the military, but they were unable to fully secure peace in Iraq as sectarian and insurgent violence continued for the duration of the war. Although Saddam Hussein’s Ba’athist regime fell in April 2003, U.S. forces did not catch him until that December, and in 2005 Iraqi courts convicted and hung him for crimes against humanity, particularly for the mass murder of Iraqi citizens. The 2005 Iraqi elections were followed by an increase in insurgent violence, so President Bush ordered a surge of additional troops into the country. In 2007, changes in military tactics and the addition of troops led to the deadliest year for American servicemembers, but sectarian violence was significantly reduced in the following years. By 2007, President Bush and numerous cabinet, intelligence, and Pentagon sources had confirmed that Iraq had no WMDs or ties to al-Qaeda. Although those initial reasons for the war were unsubstantiated, many, including President Bush, defended the war because it removed a dictator from power and brought democracy, however limited and fragile, to Iraq. During his election campaign, President Obama promised to end the Iraq War, which he did, but on a timeline that had been agreed to under President Bush within the Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq. President Obama’s administration and Iraqi officials worked to create a new agreement that would have left American troops in Iraq as trainers for the Iraqi military for several\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n9\n\nmore years. After that fell through over Iraq’s unwillingness to grant U.S. servicemembers and contractors immunity, American forces left Iraq on December 15, 2011. Although other militaries, especially the British Armed Forces, supplied troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. servicemembers made up the bulk of the forces in those wars. Many more nations sent forces to serve with the United States in Afghanistan than in Iraq. From 2001 to 2012, over two million American servicemembers served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the war in Iraq likely distracted political, aid, and military attention from Afghanistan, it did not reduce troop levels.13 In fact, during the course of the Iraq War, troop levels in Afghanistan went up from an average of just over five thousand in 2002 to almost one hundred thousand in 2010. The United States put significantly more “boots on the ground” (servicemembers who served in country) in Iraq, however, for most of the time it fought these simultaneous wars. Beginning in 2009 under President Obama, troop levels in Iraq wound down while troop levels in Afghanistan went up. By the summer of 2010, more U.S. troops were in Afghanistan than in Iraq. At its conclusion the Iraq War had claimed the lives of 4,474 American servicemembers, and as of September 13, 2013, 2,194 American servicemembers had died in Afghanistan’s Operation Enduring Freedom. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan stretched American military and financial capacities. Senior government officials such as Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, raised concerns about the operational tempo (OPTEMPO) of, or the pace of deployments to, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the length of deployments, which reached nearly two years at their lengthiest. These officials were concerned about these factors’ effects on the fighting capacities of the military, military retention, the psychological health of servicemembers, and military families. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, dwell time, or the time between deployments, was regularly less than twelve months, the military’s own suggested minimum. The cost of these wars to the United States through 2012 is estimated at $1.4 trillion if one examines only direct outlays,14 but analysis puts the full costs of the wars,\n\n10\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nincluding veterans’ care, interest on loans used to pay for the war, and some war-related aid, between $4 and $6 trillion.15 The Iraq War: Repeating History?\n\nNumerous people, including President George W. Bush and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, have compared the Iraq War to the Vietnam War.16,17 Both wars involved unconventional (guerrilla or insurgent) warfare used against U.S. forces that produced an uncertain battleground for military personnel and thwarted traditional tactics. Both conflicts had broad support at the beginning that dropped significantly over the course of the wars.18 Vietnam was touted as a war to halt the spread of communism, while Iraq was described as an important battlefield in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism. More important for understanding the military peace movement are the Vietnam veterans who became instrumental in antiwar protests of that time and the involvement of the military community after 2001. Despite the similarities, Iraq was not Vietnam, and the military of the 2000s was very different from the one the United States fielded in Vietnam. These differences led to dissimilarities between these two eras’ military mobilization against the war. The Iraq War and the Vietnam War began with 59 to 75 percent of Americans approving of them, and these numbers held during the first few months of intense combat for both wars.19 In the later years of both wars, however, when asked whether they had been a mistake, over half of Americans believed they had been. By August 1968, over half of Americans believed the Vietnam War was a mistake. Beginning in the summer of 2004, a few polls were finding that half of Americans believed the Iraq War was a mistake, and by August 2005, a majority of Americans were consistently holding this opinion. Three years into the large-scale ground wars of each conflict when Americans were asked if they approved of the presidents’ handling of the wars, significantly more disapproved of President Bush’s handling of Iraq than disapproved of Johnson’s handling of Vietnam.20 Although both wars became unpopular with the majority of Americans, the Iraq War was disapproved of more quickly than was Vietnam.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n11\n\nThe Vietnam War represented a departure from past conflicts because the military community was a visible part of the antiwar movement. Veterans of wars before Vietnam, primarily World War II veterans, actively protested the Vietnam War through an organization called Veterans for Peace, or Veterans for Peace in Viet-Nam (which has no affiliation with the organization I focus on in this book). In 1967 six Vietnam veterans organized Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), the first and most visible organization of military members protesting the war in which they had fought.21 Beyond VVAW, soldiers organized protests in Vietnam beginning in 1968 and created a variety of other formal and informal organizations.22 Although military life traditionally cut off soldiers from forces critical of war, in the late 1960s antiwar activists brought antiwar literature, the counterculture, and radical politics to soldiers through coffeehouses they opened near military bases.23 Military personnel demonstrated opposition to the Vietnam War also through desertion, intentional sabotage of equipment or paperwork, the use of symbols such as the peace sign, and underground newspapers.24 By 1971 troop morale in Vietnam was very low, and instances of drug abuse, the murders of officers, or “fragging,” and combat refusals or mutinies were on the rise.25 Estimates of Vietnam-era servicemembers who participated in antiwar activities range from 20 to 37 percent.26,27 While soldiers were important participants in the anti–Vietnam War movement, scholars began only recently to examine the actions of the military community to end the war.28 Therefore, mythology that suggests Vietnam-era peace protestors and veterans were at odds has persisted.29 Although veteran–activists have been prominently featured in discussions of antiwar movements, little has been written about military families who protest wars. In his extensive illustration of the Vietnam-era military community’s protests, Gerald Nicosia uses only one page to describe the involvement of Gold Star Mothers (mothers whose children were killed in war) and the girlfriends of soldiers and veterans in antiwar protests.30 From Vietnam to the Gulf War, the military actively enforced a media silence on spouses of servicemembers and prisoners of war.31 The earliest evidence of an antiwar military family organization that I found was for one that developed in the lead-up to the 1991 Gulf War.32 Military families opposed to that\n\n12\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwar formed the Military Family Support Network, and when the war ended after less than two months of American combat operations, the organization regrouped as a service organization focused on Gulf War syndrome. It lasted, however, for only a short time after the war. The prominence of military families’ antiwar organizations during the 2003 Iraq War and the longevity of MFSO certainly represented a departure from the past. There were dramatic differences between the U.S forces fighting the Vietnam War and those that fought the Iraq War, and these differences led to striking dissimilarities in the military opposition to those wars. First, the Iraq War occurred while the United States was already engaged in ground combat and nation-building operations in Afghanistan; the military was also engaged in operations in Libya and other places through its broader global war on terror. Second, significant aspects of the anti–Vietnam War protests within the military could be attributed to racial unrest in the United States, whereas the Iraq War’s military leadership was more racially diverse and movements for racial equality were less prominent and perhaps less relevant to American soldiers.33 Third and, I believe, most important, the Iraq War’s military included only those servicemembers who chose to enlist. While the voluntary nature of the U.S. AVF military can be debated since it draws few members from the middle and upper classes, no one was drafted into the Iraq War. Only Americans already associated with the military faced immediate war consequences. Without a draft, or a fear of a draft, there was no draft-opposition movement working in concert with the broader antiwar movement, as there was during the Vietnam War. Whereas the military would draw in a broad range of people during a draft, including many with left-leaning politics, those who served during the Iraq War and their families had more-positive attitudes toward the use of force in American foreign relations than did other civilians in the United States.34 Without a draft many in the military served multiple tours in war zones, often beyond the parameters of their initial contracts. In fact, by 2011 it was not unusual for military families to describe a servicemember going on a fifth or sixth deployment. In contrast, Vietnam draftees and enlistees served only one tour unless they reenlisted. Without the draft, the U.S. military, particularly the Army, faced\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n13\n\nshortfalls in enlistment numbers as the wars dragged on, and from 2006 to 2012, standards were lowered to allow for the enlistment of older individuals and people who had been convicted of various crimes. Reenlistment rates remained at historically high rates, however, during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, even though the more months a person was deployed, the less likely they were to believe they wanted to reenlist.35 Despite these constraints, Iraq veterans organized resistance faster than did veterans during the Vietnam era. Military resistance to the Iraq War developed quickly, in part, due to previous military-community activism, which peaked during the Vietnam War. Although a couple of the leaders of VVAW tried to learn from the older veterans involved in antiwar protest, most Vietnam veterans felt alienated from World War II veterans, who largely did not have misgivings about the causes of their war.36 Iraq veterans, however, benefited from protest during the Vietnam era because VVAW and related groups created a cultural climate in which veterans could critique a war, and they offered tangible resources to the younger generation. In fact, leading Vietnam veterans in the antiwar movement of the 1970s, such as Bobby Muller and Ron Kovic, were influential in part because they personally mentored their younger counterparts in Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW).37,38 The relationship between today’s veterans and past veterans was evident in organizational structures and emotional bonds. Although the changing demographics of the military created barriers to mobilization for the modern veterans’ movement, demographic shifts positively influenced the creation of military-family organizations. Military members during the Iraq War were significantly more likely to be married or have dependents than those at any other point in U.S. history.39 During previous wars, when anyone could have been drafted and wider swaths of the population served, virtually every family was or could be a military family.40 During the Iraq War, however, the burdens of military family life rested on fewer than 2 percent of American families. These changes likely influenced the proliferation of military-family organizations, including antiwar organizations. In his extensive work studying the Vietnam veterans’ movement both before and after that war ended, Nicosia describes veterans’ feelings of alienation from civilians who did not understand their\n\n14\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmilitary experiences and its lingering trauma.41 Similarly, I found that the civilian/military divide continued to influence the formation of the Iraq War military peace movement, and the relatively small number of military veterans from 2001 to 2011 intensified this divide. The Military and Civilians\n\nThe section of the peace movement illustrated in this book drew its distinctiveness from its relationship to the military. Since a military’s primary function is to enact war, widespread opposition to war from inside this community is unusual. In his book describing Vietnam-era military activism, David Cortwright points out that “political activism is difficult under the best of circumstances, but within the Draconian legal structure of the military it can be suicidal.”42 Americans, however, have often objected to conscription, and conscientious objection, which, historically, was religiously based, has existed since the Revolutionary War.43 Both in past wars and during the Iraq War, the military overtly discouraged antiwar sentiments through regulations and covertly created acceptance of war by demanding conformity and obedience to those who directed American foreign policy. Military culture separates military members and their families from civilians, and the military community regularly opposes antiwar protest. The military not only shapes people’s experiences so that they are supportive of wars but also attracts individuals with a greater propensity to support them. Regulations stemming from the U.S. Constitution’s establishment of civilian control over military policy intentionally limit military members’ free speech, particularly during wartime. Six primary military regulations limit servicemembers’ participation in antiwar activities. First, Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 1325.6 establishes servicemembers’ right to expression but limits this right to speech that is compatible with the effectiveness of their military unit. Second, DoDD 1344.1 forbids military members from wearing their uniforms to political events or engaging in any other behavior that indicates military endorsement of political activities. Third, DoDD 1344.10 prohibits military personnel from speaking at political events in favor of political candidates or issues, such as war. Fourth, Article\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n15\n\n88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) bans military officers from using “contemptuous” language in reference to the U.S. president or “other military officials.” Fifth, UCMJ Article 133 further limits military officers’ actions through the vague prohibition against “conduct unbecoming an officer.” Finally, military members, particularly enlisted servicemembers not bound by the previous two regulations, can be charged under a catch-all provision in UCMJ Article 134 that forbids any action or speech that the military deems contrary to “good order and discipline.”44 These formal regulations establish fairly severe punishments for military members who participate in antiwar protest, as I describe in chapter 1. The differences between military and civilian culture are so great that the For Dummies series of guidebooks published A Family’s Guide to the Military for Dummies.45 Military life requires an extensive commitment not only from its workers but also from their families, which further separates this community from civilians, resulting in conformity and loyalty to the military’s missions. The military community has their own slang, and military parlance involves numerous acronyms. Military rituals involve secretive events, including violent hazing, and formal public traditions, such as parade marches or military funerals. The military regulates its members’ and their families’ bodies through numerous strict rules about clothing, hairstyles, physical fitness, and even makeup. Military members are frequently unable to communicate with their families or friends outside their military group for weeks or months at a time. The military also requires its members and their families to move frequently, on average every two to three years, regularly affecting family members’ occupations, earnings, and networks. Military community members daily face the likelihood of death, injury, or psychological damage. Military bases operate like miniature cities, with their own stores, restaurants, recreational facilities, and even car washes. Additionally, most military members and their families are required to and are rewarded for obtaining services such as health care, insurance, and banking on base and within the military system. The unique culture and constraints of military life lead its members to believe they are different from and, in some cases, better than most civilians.46 At times, journalists and some members of the military have been\n\n16\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nalarmed by the increasing gap between the U.S. military and U.S. civilian society.47 Reasons for alarm over this gap include fear that civilians might become so uninvolved with the military that they stopped funding and supporting it or that military personnel might become so disillusioned with their fellow Americans that their loyalty to civilian leadership diminished or disappeared, which at its worst would lead to a military coup. Military personnel are more likely than civilians and civilian leadership to be conservative, vote Republican, and hold nationalistic or hawkish prowar attitudes.48 Although some data found that this gap was narrowing before the Iraq War, it also found significant political-affiliation differences.49 Additionally, veterans and military families have had significantly more-positive evaluations of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan than have civilians.50 These voting and attitudinal trends suggest that the military community would be less ripe for antiwar protest than would be civilians. In fact, many military members widely disparage or, at least, mistrust protest activism and protestors. Some soldiers and their families have negative feelings about peace protests because they believe such protest is aimed at them.51 This likely stems from a revisionist interpretation of history that, in part, blames war protestors for the U.S. failure in Vietnam. Vitriolic treatment of peace protestors spills over into at least one of the songs, or cadences, military members sing while marching; the cadence titled “Jesse James” describes the desire to kill a “long-haired hippie.” In military communities during the Iraq War, Jane Fonda was still referred to as “Hanoi Jane,” and her high-profile status as a Vietnam War protestor made her an example of the misguided, enemy-loving peace protester.52 Individuals who participate in military service are significantly less likely to participate in social-movement activism or other untraditional political actions.53 Despite the constraints of military culture, between ten and fifteen thousand members of the American military community joined anti–Iraq War protests. This portion of the military community was small considering nearly twenty-four million veterans were in the United States in 2010 and over two million people served in Iraq and Afghanistan. This book does not attempt, however, to describe the entire military community’s opinions about the Iraq War. It instead focuses on those individuals who from a veteran’s, a soldier’s,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n17\n\nor a military family member’s perspective stepped beyond norms and publicly spoke their opposition to these wars. Given military culture and the consequences for activism, it was surprising that opposition to policies the military was charged with enacting came from inside the military community. Military family members and veterans had to negotiate competing identities in order to criticize American military policy while also participating in or supporting loved ones in the military. Military peace organizations provided spaces where people could reconstruct their understanding of themselves and even the social understandings of peace and the military. Furthermore, these organizations provided collective identity and kinship for many people in the military community, some of whom were explicitly ostracized by other military organizations because of their political beliefs. All of this made the people in the movement exceptional, and research on them offers insight into a state-focused movement where occupational and other forms of identity clearly mattered. The Anti–Iraq War Movement\n\nDuring the Iraq War the antiwar movement comprised numerous individuals and organizations that often worked together, though, as in most large movements, they frequently disagreed over tactics and strategies.54 In addition, the movement was divided by cognitive differences in their constructions of the scope, causes, and cures for the war. For instance, the movement included pacifists and hawks, people who linked peace to larger social-justice issues and those more narrowly focused on international conflicts, and people focused on world peace and those focused exclusively on the Middle East, as well as those interested only in ending the Iraq War. Following the Vietnam War, the peace movement focused on issues of nuclear disarmament and, briefly, the Gulf War, but neither of those issues attracted the large-scale demonstrations or the broad base of participants of the Vietnam War’s peace movement.55 Although the war in Afghanistan reenergized peace movement organizations, they struggled to mobilize large numbers of participants until President Bush focused military attention on Iraq.56 On October 2, 2002, one of the first demonstrations against the Iraq\n\n18\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWar occurred when several thousand people rallied in Federal Plaza in Chicago to hear speakers, including the then senator Barack Obama, denounce the war.57 Three days later, several hundred protesters marched down the shopping and tourist main street of Santa Barbara, California, led by veterans of World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Gulf War. By the end of the month, a rally in Washington, D.C., attracted over one hundred thousand protestors. Localized protest continued until transnational organizing sparked protests in over sixty countries on February 15, 2003.58 These actions were inspired by fears of war created when Colin Powell described the supposed stockpile of WMDs in Iraq at a meeting of the United Nations (UN) on February 3, 2003. After the war began, most national antiwar protest marches happened in Washington, D.C., with many coinciding with anniversaries of the first day of the invasion.59 Large protests in 2004 and 2008 also coincided with the Republican and Democratic national conventions.60 In April 2009 activists sought to connect the war to the economy with a large march aimed at Wall Street in New York. In the initial protests against the Iraq War, peace movement leaders responded strategically to the intensified patriotic pride and nationalism among Americans in the wake of 9/11.61 They made claims to American identity and American values such as democracy and civil liberties.62 They also redefined patriotism through commonly used phrases such as “peace is patriotic.”63 Since politicians and others encouraging U.S. involvement in Iraq linked patriotism and troop support to backing the Iraq War, veterans and military families were often pushed to the front of peace movement activism.64 As I describe in chapter 4, military peace movement activists used their military credentials to lay claims to troop support and patriotism for the peace movement. From 2007 to the end of the Iraq War in December 2011, peace protests were significantly smaller and less regular than they had been at the height of the anti–Iraq War movement (2003–6), when national marches attracted hundreds of thousands. Until 2008, however, organizations continued to build up their infrastructures and regularly engaged in lobbying and advertising. After January 2007 national protests were no larger than tens of thousands, and by 2009 most protests were in the hundreds.65 Much of this can be attributed to a changing political landscape in which Democrats made significant gains in the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n19\n\n2006 and the 2008 elections. Activists affiliated with the Democratic Party left antiwar activism, and the remaining movement became radicalized.66 Numerous activists within the peace movement celebrated the election of President Barack Obama, and many expressed sentiments similar to those of an Army mother from my research: “We need to give Obama a chance to bring the troops home. I think we should wait to protest.” As activists and organizations waited to see what the new president would do about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the movement demobilized. They did so while large troop deployments were still being made, some larger than those made during President George W. Bush’s administration. Simultaneously, the global recession of 2007 took its toll, reducing foundational and other organizational funding sources and individual activists’ financial availability. IDENTITY AND EMOTION IN A UNIQUE CULTURE OF ACTION\n\nWithin the broader peace movement, people with connections to the military created a unique subsection that was cognitively, emotionally, and physically different from other segments of the movement. Maren Klawiter offers the term culture of action to describe how movement segments differ not just by ideology but also by norms, symbols, and language.67 Whereas other works on cultures of action focus on movement segments’ different choices of tactics and frames, in this book I describe the way cultures of action are separated by mobilization, maintenance, and influence. I examine the role of identity and emotion in the internal processes of cultures of action (those between participants), as well as in their external processes (those aimed at a wide audience). By examining how identities and emotions are intimately tied to a host of movement processes, I demonstrate how a culture of action has consequences for the activists within it and the movement’s broader goals. Identity\n\nThe current resurgence of activity by the military community has opened numerous avenues for sociological research on identity processes in social movements. Most research on identity in social movements focuses on identity-based movements that center on the recog-\n\n20\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nnition of or equality for people with particular gender, racial/ethnic, religious, sexual, or other identities. This book demonstrates how identity affected a wide range of movement processes within a state-focused movement.68 The military peace movement developed a shared identity and used their identities to challenge cultural understandings about wars, militarism, and peace protestors. Examining identity at the culture-of-action level allows scholars to understand the importance of divisions and connections between organizations in movements. Activists within a movement interact with members of various organizations, and they frequently develop strong bonds with people beyond their own organizations, but not with all members of a wider movement. An exploration of collective identity at the culture-of-action level can better explain the totality of relationships that facilitates mobilization, sustains participation, and transforms activists’ lives. Identity within the Movement In order to get sustained involvement from their members, social movement organizations must do more than convince people of their side of an issue or that there is a possibility of winning. They must also develop a sense of belonging, community, or we-ness among participants, or what social movement scholars call collective identity.69 In their review of social movement literature, Francesca Polletta and James Jasper provide the following definition of collective identity: “an individual’s cognitive, moral and emotional connection with a broader community, category, practice, or institution.”70 Participants construct collective identity through interactions with other activists and with the opposition.71 Social movements are often spaces where people reconstruct their identities and the meanings of fundamental identity categories.72 David Snow and Doug McAdam suggest that several processes are involved in how people align themselves with a collective identity, and this book offers an in-depth examination of the identity-consolidation process whereby activists create a single identity that blends two identities that were previously thought to be incompatible.73 Collective-identity construction happens at a variety of levels, and as described by William Gamson, collective identity has three “embedded layers: organizational, movement, and solidary.”74 A person’s\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n21\n\nidentification with one of these layers need not mean that one identifies with the others. For example, a person may identify with an organization but not the broader movement within which that organization is embedded. A person may also develop identification with a broad status group (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation, work group, and social or labor class) but not a collective identity in a movement or organization that seeks to better that group’s position. An array of data on the social psychology of movements demonstrates that before people will cooperatively work to change their disadvantaged situations, they must develop a collective identity that links them to a cause.75 Much of this data suggests that collective-identity formation at the level of the disadvantaged solidary group is not as effective at leading to activism as identification at the organizational or movement level, because movements provide a context that politicizes disadvantage.76 As one aligns his or her identity with a movement or an organization, that person internalizes the group’s norms and consciousness (e.g., goals and understanding of the situation), thus further compelling them to actively participate in protest.77 By focusing my analysis on collectiveidentity formation at the submovement or culture-of-action level, I illustrate an important additional layer of this embedded collective identity. In the military peace movement, the culture-of-action level of identity was often as and, in some cases, more important than organizational or movement levels of identity. The culture-of-action level of identity is important for examining how multiple intersecting identities affect the choices activists make, their experience in a movement, and the effects of activism over the life course. The military peace movement activists I studied built their collective identity by recognizing and appreciating their unique insider– outsider status. They were insiders on war, patriotism, and the troops, and yet their antiwar beliefs and activist tendencies located them outside the mainstream military community. At the same time, they operated inside the peace movement, but their military connections and history made them outsiders to a space in which many distrusted the military and sought to end the need for and use of it. In the military peace movement, veterans came to grips with their participation in the military and their understanding of peace, while military family members felt both love for people wearing military uniforms and\n\n22\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndisgust at what the military was doing. This research contributes to sociological understandings of how identity develops through social interactions rather than as a part of an innate self, and I demonstrate how social movements influence the construction of identities based on apparently conflicting loyalties. Rather than focusing on how their outsider status separated them from the mainstream military community and the wider peace movement, activists built a positive identity that combined these two distinct aspects of themselves through collective action. Their collective identity was built on a shared definition of the Iraq War as a problem for the military, and they demonstrated how military experiences required antiwar activism. Identity for an Audience Social movement participants make calculated choices about how to present themselves through appearance and actions, thus strategically deploying their identities.78 When movement actors deploy identity, they strategically highlight particular aspects of their history, bodies, and life in order to influence external audiences. Using research on gay and lesbian activists, as well as examples from other movements, Mary Bernstein theorizes that activists deploy identities either for education by highlighting their similarities to the majority or for critique by stressing their differences from the majority.79 I add to these categories of identity deployment by laying out two other ways that movements strategically display their identities. First, activists deploy oppositional identities that attract attention and counter claims by their critics.80 When activists use this strategy, they highlight aspects of themselves that might lead people to think they are on the other side of an issue. The military peace movement activists garnered attention for the peace movement and helped to counter the prowar arguments that the peace movement was unpatriotic and that troop support required believing in the Iraq War’s mission. Second, activists deploy identities for authority whereby participants present themselves or some of their members as experts in an effort to mold public opinion. Movement participants use this strategy because presenting these identities accords them greater legitimacy in the discourses surrounding a topic.81 Military peace movement activists garnered\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n23\n\nauthority when protesting the Iraq War because their military association conferred standing on this issue. The strategies of oppositional and authoritative identities are rooted in the very bodies and core identities of movement activists. Thus, I expand the notion of personalized political strategies in order to reveal the importance of the everyday deployment of identity through clothing, symbols, affiliation, rhetoric, and bodily movement.82 Activists use these things to emphasize their identities not only at protest events but also in their everyday activities. By embodying identities that contradict mainstream ideas or suggest authority in a cultural or political contest, these personalized political strategies can become more palatable to segments of the population who dislike traditional protest. Embodied protest demonstrates how strategically important it is for movements to link the personal and the political. State and other institutional policies often seem disconnected from everyday lives, but these identity strategies use personalization to connect bystanders to the issues in both cognitive and emotional ways. Thus, military peace movement activists built a collective identity around their connection to the military and their unique position from which to criticize the war, and their strategies and rhetoric drew on a variety of identity claims to assert legitimacy. Emotion\n\nOver the past two decades, social movement scholars have paid increasing attention to the critical roles of emotion in social movements.83 This work contrasts with collective-behavior theories that link emotions to irrationality and adds complexity to insights from dominant social-movement models of resource mobilization and political process that focus on structural resources or political opportunities, narrowly defined, as determinants of protest.84 I demonstrate that emotion can be utilized to affect both movement participants and audiences. Emotions within the Movement Activists are often mobilized because of the strong emotional draw of a cause. Social psychologists find that emotions, particularly anger,\n\n24\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmotivate people to identify with a movement.85 Solidarity and collective identities must be built on affective ties; they do not merely arise.86 Feelings of injustice often mobilize participants, and the construction of a movement collective identity channels anger and converts shame to pride.87 Emotions are a part of collective-identity construction.88 Strong emotional attachments foster solidarity and mobilize actors to join together for a cause.89 Participants often feel reciprocal emotions or positive affective bonds such as love, respect, and trust for one another.90 These reciprocal emotions maintain movement ties and assist in the development of collective identities.91 Activists frequently draw pleasure from their participation, which helps maintain their activism during trying times.92 The emotional bonds and friendships of a movement can even cut across other potentially divisive identity categories such as race and gender.93 Activism involves emotion work, which entails managing, directing, transforming, and legitimating participants’ emotions in ways that facilitate movement goals.94 Activists must manage negative emotions such as shame, fear, and guilt in order to overcome despair and act to change their situation.95 Developing a consciousness that challenges mainstream interpretations of a situation such as a war can take vast amounts of emotional energy, and even more is required to participate in tactics aimed at changing society.96 The tight-knit multiorganizational structure found in the military peace movement grew from the anger and negative emotions of war, and this culture of action facilitated reciprocal emotions that made activism possible. Participation in activism can also transform the emotions experienced by activists.97 In the course of working with others and locating the source of their troubles outside themselves, activists move from feeling shame, fear, and guilt about their situation to anger at the other people or the structures that caused their pain.98 Veterans and military families who opposed the Iraq War often experience guilt and internalized anger over their participation in war or their inability to stop the participation of others; loneliness as military and peace movement outsiders; and fear over the war’s consequences for friends and family. The family-like structure of the military peace movement and its resulting emotional attachment helps activists face and channel\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n25\n\nnegative emotions brought on by the Iraq War. The construction of a movement family identity alters activists’ emotions so that they express group pride, love for and protectiveness of fellow activists, and anger directed at structures and authorities. Activism can transform emotions of powerlessness into emotions of resistance.99 Emotions for an Audience Emotions play a role in movements’ ability to make change, and tactics and strategies often derive power from their ability to elicit desired emotions. Activists hope not only to make arguments that people accept but also to provoke emotional responses that lead people to take action for the cause or further bind them to the movement. Nancy Whittier’s research on the movement against child sexual abuse and Deborah Gould’s on AIDS activism demonstrate the strategic use of emotion to aid social-movement framing and outcomes.100 Activists intentionally evoke feelings of grief and anger through tactics that use narrative, theater, and other art forms, such as the antirape Take Back the Night marches and rallies, the anti–domestic violence Clothesline Project, and the AIDS Memorial Quilt project.101 These tactics elicit strong emotions, educate the public, and affect institutional policies. The emotional element is not accidental. In fact, activists strategize about which emotions to stimulate in others in particular contexts.102 While movements attempt to elicit many different emotions, grief— particularly, maternal grief—has been a critical tool in organizing against militarized violence because it resonates with the public.103,104 Military peace movement activists publicly demonstrated the emotions brought on by war in order to motivate the wider American public, who was largely unaffected by war. Participants regularly attempted to stimulate grief, which would bind people to the movement and its cause, particularly through politicized memorials. They moved their audience also to act on their anger toward policy makers who continued the wars. This book describes the role identity plays in emotion strategies by examining how activists deployed a military identity in ways that heightened bystanders’ emotional response to their tactics. By exploring more fully how movements strategically elicit emotions, I push social movement scholars to grapple directly with the emotional\n\n26\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmeanings of tactics and strategies in order to explore their effects on movement contests and outcomes. FOLLOWING THE MILITARY PEACE MOVEMENT\n\nAs I describe in the preface, the following chapters are based on extensive ethnographic data I collected between 2005 and 2012. Chapter 1 lays out the history and context of the military peace movement. I explain how veterans and military families carved out a unique culture of action within the wider peace movement and how activists within this culture faced greater risks for peace movement participation than did their civilian counterparts. These risks not only made this movement significantly more novel than other segments of the peace movement but also drove members of the military community together to form this culture of action. Chapter 2 shows how military-affiliated individuals who faced the risks described in chapter 1 and the military’s antiprotest culture moved from being soldiers and their supporters to becoming peace activists. These activists adopted a collective identity based on a shared sense of being both insiders and outsiders. I describe what set these activists apart from others in the military and the peace movement and how their unique identities placed them in an important position. Chapter 3 moves from identity to emotion and examines how the military peace movement identity helped to transform activists’ emotional states. The family structure of the military peace movement allowed activists to move beyond the negative emotions of powerlessness—the fear, guilt, shame, and unfocused anger brought on by war—and develop emotions of resistance—those of righteous anger, love, and group pride. As such, the construction of a military peace-movement identity had important consequences for sustaining and enabling movement participation. Chapters 4 and 5 turn from identity and emotion in the internal workings of the movement to a discussion of their use in the military peace movement’s attempts to change American perceptions of the Iraq War. Chapter 4 illustrates how the movement made use of their unique identities both as people connected to the military and as antiwar activists.105 Activists within this movement recognized and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\n27\n\nexploited their combined military and peace-activist identities in order to attract attention from the media, the American public, and government officials; demonstrate legitimacy in the debate over war; undermine prowar rhetoric; and reach those unconvinced by traditional peace-movement claims. Though these identity strategies were often effective, they were controversial within this culture of action and for its relationship to the broader peace movement. Chapter 5 examines the intentional use of emotion by the movement, focusing on the movement’s use of antiwar war memorials to elicit grief and sadness. Activists used these emotions to draw people who supported the war into the tactic and to encourage greater participation in antiwar activities. They also deployed their military peace movement identities in order to assert authority about the Iraq War and enhance emotional responses to the tactic. The conclusion provides a picture of the continuing activism in this movement after the Iraq War ended in 2011, as well as a summary of what we can learn from the movement. This research on the military peace movement provides rich data about the ways that the dichotomy between peace and war affected peace-movement participation and attempts at change. Examining the microprocesses in the military peace movement contributes to social movement theory on how collective identities develop, are sustained, and influence other movement outcomes. I build upon and add to social movement theory’s understanding of the interconnectedness of identity, culture, emotions, and political opportunities. My research on the overlapping and interconnected organizations of military community members demonstrates the importance of social movement research that recognizes a meso-level between a movement and its organizations, or the culture-of-action level.\n\n28\n\n|\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1 Joining the Military Peace Movement\n\nRisky Business\n\nS\n\nweating profusely in the Texas summer heat of 2006, about thirty members of IVAW, GSFP, MFSO, and VFP, buoyed by smaller numbers of other peace organizations such as CodePink, worked frantically to create a space to stage events on a vacant lot that Cindy Sheehan purchased in Crawford approximately seven miles from President Bush’s ranch. Activists readied the rural space by building roads, clearing brush, planting gardens, setting up memorials, constructing a stage, installing generators and bathrooms, and rigging a sound system and lights. The work became especially hectic as September 1 approached because the activists had called for a press conference that they hoped would attract attention to the peace movement in a way that Sheehan’s own original protest had in 2005. Twenty-two-year-old Army Specialist Mark Wilkerson was to announce his surrender to military authorities at the Army’s Fort Hood base in Killeen, Texas. Wilkerson went AWOL (absent without leave) when he was supposed to redeploy to Iraq, and he had hid from military authorities for eighteen months. In the days leading up to this press conference, military peace movement activists taking part in these Camp Casey III protests spoke excitedly about finally drawing attention to the uniquely difficult decisions that military members had to make about the wars. The activists were in agreement that if a war was illegal and immoral, then soldiers had the right to resist deployment to that war. Although MFSO had not officially backed this position at that point (it would in just a matter of months), many members of MFSO were heavily involved in planning the press conference and supporting war resisters such as Wilkerson. In calling attention to his story, activists hoped\n\n|\n\n29\n\nFIGURE 3.

He had been AWOL for one and a half years. In the front row with him are the other speakers including (left to right) Geoff Millard, Charlie Anderson, Cindy Sheehan, Ann Wright, and Chaz Davis.

Before Wilkerson spoke at the press conference, other members of the movement called attention to the difficulties of being both connected to the military and opposed to the Iraq War. Colonel (Mary) Ann Wright (Retired) explained that federal employees and other civilians faced limited consequences for protesting the Iraq War, whereas on that day at least twelve soldiers were facing courts-martial for doing so and that, depending on the numbers used, between 8,000 and 40,000 other servicemembers had gone AWOL. Those actions demonstrated the inherent riskiness of protest for military individuals. Wright said:\n\n30\n\n|\n\nJOINING THE MILITARY PEACE MOVEMENT\n\nIn no way should anyone dispraise what he has done in going AWOL or turning himself in to military authority. He wants to get on with his life. He wants to be able to speak about the reasons that he went AWOL in the first place. And the way to do that is to subject himself back to military authority, take what happens, and then come out of whatever happens as a whole person, as a person of conscience. . . . So I, as a senior military officer, am extraordinarily proud of Mark for standing up for [his] conscience to say, “I know the difference between right and wrong, and it is my duty as a military personnel to obey that. I do not have to obey illegal orders. I do not have to go to an illegal war. I will take the consequences.” So if we are people of courage, if we are people of conviction, we must stand by these men and women that are doing exactly that.\n\nIn her speech Wright sought to use her status as a retired high-ranking military officer to quiet the fears of soldiers who felt it was disloyal to disobey orders and to encourage others to resist following “illegal orders.” She fully acknowledged, however, the unique risks that military members faced as a result of such actions of conscience, since military members could not choose which wars to fight. As Wright spoke she illuminated how members of the peace movement needed to come together to support what she and the movement called “war resisters.” All of the speakers called for civilian peace protesters to find ways to support those soldiers whose consciences led them to cut ties with or run from the military. In doing so, they brought attention to one of the greatest differences between the military peace movement and the civilian peace movement: military members faced much higher risks for their opposition to the war. TruthOut contributor and Iraq War veteran Geoff Millard prepared a series of exclusive interviews with Wilkerson, with which he hoped to call attention to the resistance inside the military to the war. He spoke about this resistance during the press conference and announced that he would no longer follow his obligations as a member of the Army Reserve, to which he owed several more months of duty. Millard also described organizing the IVAW chapter in Toronto, which was primarily populated by military members who had gone AWOL and fled to Canada. Millard suggested that the wider peace movement needed to do more to support military\n\nJOINING THE MILITARY PEACE MOVEMENT\n\n|\n\n31\n\nmembers whose conscience would not allow them to serve in these illegal and immoral wars. He spoke of the legal and material needs that this war resistance created. Protesting the Iraq War meant something very different to Wilkerson, Millard, and the thousands of soldiers who Wright referenced than what it did to most Americans. Military individuals faced three main controls on their activism: military regulations of free speech, prowar rhetoric that suggested the military was unified in its support of the current war, and the U.S. military community’s generally negative perception of protestors. In spite of these constraints, thousands of veterans, soldiers, and military family members took part in national and local protests for peace. Although these constraints set the military apart during any conflict, the lack of a draft and the intense pace of combat deployments, as described in the introduction, meant only a small subsection of Americans were directly affected by the wars. This created a sense of isolation, which I further elaborate in chapter 2, and led to a unique culture of action within the peace movement comprising people whose daily lives were at some point regulated by the U.S. military. This subsection, the military peace movement, was primarily composed of four interconnected organizations within the broader peace movement. This subculture within the peace movement developed out of shared identities, experiences, and risks. This chapter begins with a description of the increased military involvement in political action since 2001 and then focuses on the military peace movement. I detail the origins and demographic makeup of four military peace movement organizations that differed from similar organizations that did not overtly critique the war. I also describe how the military identities of activists increased the risk of their peace movement participation and how these risks separated the military peace movement from the wider peace movement. In general, peace activism is a low-risk activity, but the military connections of these activists made much of their activism high risk, involving actions that were likely to cost them physically, legally, financially, and/or socially.1 Although these consequences varied depending on a person’s relationship to the military—for example, the veterans of past wars faced far fewer consequences than did the veterans of current wars\n\n32\n\n|\n\nJOINING THE MILITARY PEACE MOVEMENT\n\nand their families—activists faced three broad categories of consequences in this culture of action: (1) official risks, (2) estrangement risks, and (3) psychological risks. MILITARY ACTIVISM AND THE IRAQ WAR\n\nDuring the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, groups that focused on issues facing the military flourished. The military community’s activism drew on established veterans’ peace organizations, as well as nearly a dozen new organizations created by post-9/11 veterans and their families. The military community actively sought to alter U.S. foreign policy through groups that campaigned for John Kerry and Barack Obama during the 2004 and the 2008 presidential campaigns and through these groups’ successors, which included political action committees (PACs) of various types. The explosion of new antiwar organizations and renewed mobilization against military intervention in the Middle East from within the military community made up the military peace movement. This movement developed out of a larger political field of critical military politics during the Iraq War. These critical voices from inside the military provided a context of discontent with the status quo, which allowed the military peace movement to emerge and be heard. During the Iraq War a unique phenomenon occurred: numerous people with long military careers spoke against U.S. policy there. Many of the senior officers who made their opposition to the war public, including General Anthony Zinni, Lieutenant General Greg Newbold, Major General John Riggs, Major General Paul D. Eaton, and Major General Charles Swannack Jr., did not join forces with antiwar organizations. A few prominent veterans—namely, General Wesley Clark and Major General John Batiste (the latter an Iraq War veteran)—worked with the PACs but not in protest organizations per se. Their highly publicized critiques of the Iraq War demonstrated, however, that cracks existed in the U.S. military’s “green wall” of support for global military interventions. Additionally, critique coming from men of their stature—as senior military officials who gave their whole careers in support of their country—likely encouraged other military members to critically consider the current political landscape.\n\nJOINING THE MILITARY PEACE MOVEMENT\n\n|\n\n33\n\nIn the first decade of the 2000s, there were three broad types of critical military-affiliated political organizations: service organizations, PACs, and antiwar organizations. Military community members engaged in critical politics within these types, and they arranged themselves according to their relationship to the military (Figure 4). This section offers a general overview of this protest field. Political Action Committees\n\nThe military community engaged in critical politics that critiqued some of the policies in Iraq and Afghanistan through standard lobbying and candidate support by PACs. While these organizations often criticized the war, most were not completely opposed to it or its continuation. Some of these groups worked for specific candidates. Presidential candidates John Kerry and Barack Obama harnessed groups of veterans and military families who opposed the war’s handling by crafting speaking tours of and events for veterans and military families. These were aimed at reducing the perception that the Democratic Party was soft on issues of war or disdainful of the military while allowing these candidates to oppose current war policies. Many of the veterans and military families involved in the 2004 political races on behalf of the Democrats formed the nonpartisan progressive lobbying organization Veterans and Military Families for Progress (VMFP) in February 2005. VMFP focuses on both foreignpolicy issues and domestic policy concerning the military and veterans and, unlike many of the peace movement organizations, is recognized by the VA. Since 2004, many veterans critical of aspects of post-9/11 war policies have created technically nonpartisan PACs, such as VoteVets, which targeted primarily Republican lawmakers for their votes against funding body armor and improved veterans’ benefits. In the 2012 election, VetPAC: Veteran’s Alliance for Security and Democracy actively took on an anti–President Obama PAC created by a retired Navy SEAL. Additional veteran-affiliated PACs, such as Operation Free, worked on issues such as renewable energy, which they linked to their veteran status by pointing out the role of oil in recent American wars\n\n34\n\n|\n\nJOINING THE MILITARY PEACE MOVEMENT\n\nVeterans of All Wars\n\nVietnam Veterans\n\nIraq Veterans\n\nMilitary Families\n\nService organizations\n\nVeterans for Common Sense; Veterans United for Truth\n\nVietnam Veterans of America\n\nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America; Operation Truth\n\nMilitary Spouses for Change\n\nPolitical action committees\n\nVoteVets; Vets for Kerry; Vets for Obama; Veterans and Military Families for Progress\n\nAntiwar organizations\n\nVeterans for Peace; Veterans Against the Iraq War; West Point Graduates Against the War; Service Academy Graduates Against the War\n\nFIGURE 4.\n\nGold Star Families\n\nMoms on a Mission; Blue Star Families for Obama; Blue Star Families of America; Veterans and Military Families for Progress Vietnam Veterans Against War\n\nIraq Veterans Military Families Against the Speak Out War\n\nGold Star Families for Peace; Gold Star Families Speak Out\n\nCritical Military Organizations from 2003 to 2009.\n\nCritical Veterans’ Nonprofit Organizations\n\nMilitary veterans were involved in protesting the Iraq War starting in 2002, when President Bush threatened to intensify U.S. activity against the Iraqi government. Members of Veterans for Peace (VFP), an organization of veterans of all conflicts and peacetime soldiers, founded in 1985, and Vietnam Veterans Against War (VVAW), an organization of veterans from only the Vietnam conflict, founded in 1967, marched and took part in educational efforts against the war.2 A number of smaller\n\nJOINING THE MILITARY PEACE MOVEMENT\n\n|\n\n35\n\nveterans’ organizations that operated primarily online and organized around particular veteran identities were founded in response to the Iraq War. Most of these organizations focused on the Iraq War in particular, as opposed to peace and militarism more broadly. Other veterans’ organizations developed to focus on veterans’ care and demanded a more responsible use of military force. These organizations are better understood as critical military service organizations than as antiwar organizations. For example, Veterans for Common Sense (VCS), founded in September 2002 by Gulf War veterans, argued that the Iraq War was unnecessary, but the organization focused on veterans’ care issues rather than protest of the Iraq War itself. Others, like Veterans United for Truth (VUFT), called for war to be used as a last resort and had a vague position on Iraq but spent their efforts on helping veterans secure benefits. As veterans returned home in the years after the invasion of Iraq, they formed new social movement organizations and joined with older veterans, particularly Vietnam-era veterans. VFP helped returning vets from Iraq and from Afghanistan form IVAW. Other veterans’ organizations criticized the Iraq War but were not specifically or primarily focused on ending it. For example, Operation Truth, which in 2005 became Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), concentrated on exploring the daily problems facing the troops and expressed limited criticism of the wars. IAVA was more focused on the wars’ handling and veterans’ reintegration issues rather than on the Iraq War’s legality or morality.
