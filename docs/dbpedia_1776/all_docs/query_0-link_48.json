        "text": "Random Blog Endorsement\n\nI've been checking out some posts over at BlameBush, and I just have one thing to say:\n\nIf I'd known back in January that Liberal Larry of BlameBush was the king of pretend moonbattery, I probably wouldn't have embarrassed myself with Larry the Liberal (who was named before I knew of BlameBush, just so you know). My pathetic attempts at satire don't even come close to this guy. He's good.\n\nFor those of you who started reading SIT after Larry's departure, I'll provide a list of his posts here. I figure you might want to see why BlameBush is superior in every way. And for those of you who remember Larry the Liberal...you DO know that he wasn't real, right? Because a couple commenters on his posts seemed a bit confused about his identity. You'll see what I mean if you read them. Anyway...\n\nLarry the Liberal's posts:\n\nState of the Union Commentary\n\nRoundup #1\n\nRoundup #2\n\nLarry's Reaction to the Super Bowl\n\nLarry on tree marriage\n\nRoundup #3\n\nPosted by CD at 12:45 AM | Comments (0)\n\nBWAHAHA!!!\n\nCheck out this excerpt from a lefty blog that just linked me:\n\n...the right side of the Blogosphere was pretty much in lock-step with the RNC talking points: He's lost it. He was anti-American and full of rage. He was frothing-at-the-mouth. He was crazy. And (this is getting so original) he has officially lost it. He has careened off the rails. In other words, they had nothing to say.\n\nIt links to part 3 of my fisking with the word \"crazy.\" Heh heh. Nothing to say, huh? I guess that's why I spent several hours researching and dissecting the entire thing.\n\nNice dodge.\n\nUPDATE\n\nIf you're thinking of trolling this post, you should probably think twice. Maybe you just need to calm down a little. Here, have some Kool-Aid:\n\nI know you libs love this stuff.\n\nPosted by CD at 09:20 PM | Comments (10)\n\nHoly Crap, We're Doomed\n\nYou know those crazy Democratic Underground posters? Apparently people trust at least one of them with their children.\n\nI'm scared.\n\nPosted by CD at 08:18 PM | Comments (2)\n\nFisking the Gorebot: Part 4\n\nPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nPart 3\n\nIt's time for the final section of Al Gore's speech! YAY! This is the grand finale, people. I'll try to make it good (especially since it's probably the last major thing I'll post until next week):\n\nIt is now clear that their obscene abuses of the truth and their unforgivable abuse of the trust placed in them after 9/11 by the American people led directly to the abuses of the prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison...\n\nLet's break down this logic: Bush allegedly lied and abused his power, which somehow led to a confirmed case of prisoner abuse. I don't get how you can decide that something that probably didn't happen is the direct cause of something that definitely did happen, but maybe I'm just not nuanced in my thinking.\n\n...and, we are now learning, in many other similar facilities constructed as part of Bush's Gulag...\n\nYou know, a gulag is usually defined as \"a forced labor camp,\" not \"a place where some prisoners are stacked naked.\"\n\n...in which, according to the Red Cross, 70 to 90 percent of the victims are totally innocent of any wrongdoing.\n\nOkay, first of all, there's a difference between \"innocent\" and \"not guilty.\" If it hasn't yet been proven that they did something wrong, it doesn't make them innocent. And second, how would the Red Cross even know? Did they talk to the prisoners? Because I'm sure they always tell the truth.\n\nThe same dark spirit of domination has led them to - for the first time in American history - imprison American citizens with no charges, no right to see a lawyer, no right to notify their family, no right to know of what they are accused, and no right to gain access to any court to present an appeal of any sort.\n\nWell, that's about 50% right. The problem is that those parts of the Act only apply to non-citizens who have been deemed a threat to national security. Be enlightened. (or, if you're really up to it, you can read the entire PATRIOT Act here. I haven't gotten around to it yet.)\n\nThe Bush Admistration has even acquired the power to compel librarians to tell them what any American is reading, and to compel them to keep silent about the request - or else the librarians themselves can also be imprisoned.\n\nOh no! How horrible! Look, if someone is reading books with titles like \"How to Overthrow the Government\" or \"Dirty Bombs for Dummies,\" and they also happen to have terrorist connections, don't you think the government might want to do something about it?\n\nThey have launched an unprecedented assault on civil liberties, on the right of the courts to review their actions, on the right of the Congress to have information to how they are spending the public's money...\n\nWay to not give a single example.\n\n...and the right of the news media to have information about the policies they are pursuing.\n\nWhen was the last time the news media used actual information for anything?\n\nThe same pattern characterizes virtually all of their policies. They resent any constraint as an insult to their will to dominate and exercise power.\n\nAre they questioning your patriotism, Al? Awwwww.....\n\nTheir appetite for power is astonishing. It has led them to introduce a new level of viciousness in partisan politics.\n\nHoly crap, the hypocrisy is incredible.\n\nIt is that viciousness that led them to attack as unpatriotic, Senator Max Cleland, who lost three limbs in combat during the Vietnam War.\n\nWRONG! They brought up Cleland's voting record on national defense issues, which showed that he voted against Bush's policies even while he claimed to support the fight against terrorism.\n\nI find it interesting that \"criticizing a person's voting record\" is now equivalent to \"attacking their patriotism,\" since Kerry used this same argument. It's almost as if they know that their votes are making us less safe, but they're too ashamed to admit it. Hmmm...\n\nThe president episodically poses as a healer and \"uniter\". If he president really has any desire to play that role, then I call upon him to condemn Rush Limbaugh - perhaps his strongest political supporter - who said that the torture in Abu Ghraib was a \"brilliant maneuver\" and that the photos were \"good old American pornography,\" and that the actions portrayed were simply those of \"people having a good time and needing to blow off steam.\"\n\nSee, there's another problem with you and your liberal ilk. Rush Limbaugh is not connected to the government. He is an American citizen enjoying his right to freedom of speech. If Bush were to condemn Air America, you'd be accusing him of censorship, but you somehow find nothing wrong with asking him to attack a talk radio host who said something you don't agree with. Hey, I've got an idea: Let's make the president condemn everyone who says something contrary to popular opinion! That's the real American way!\n\n(D)umb@ss.\n\nThis new political viciousness by the President and his supporters is found not only on the campaign trail, but in the daily operations of our democracy.\n\nThe only \"viciousness\" I see is coming from your side, Gore. You know, like Ted Kennedy comparing Bush to Saddam Hussein, Congresspeople calling Republicans \"chickenhawks,\" John \"F**k Up\" Kerry and his \"crooked liars\" comment, and a host of weird socialist moonbats calling the president and his administration un-American. Politician, heal thyself!\n\nThey have insisted that the leaders of their party in the Congress deny Democrats any meaningful role whatsoever in shaping legislation, debating the choices before us as a people, or even to attend the all-important conference committees that reconcile the differences between actions by the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nWHAT? You're talking about the Democrats who filibuster every single one of Bush's judicial nominees and hide out in another state when the Republicans disagree with them, right?\n\nThe same meanness of spirit...\n\nIt sounds so juvenile. I wonder if his lip was quivering when he said this.\n\n...shows up in domestic policies as well. Under the Patriot Act, Muslims, innocent of any crime, were picked up, often physically abused, and held incommunicado indefinitely.\n\nYeah, just because they were Muslim, we rounded them up and threw them in \"gulags.\" Come on, Al, are you really this ignorant? In case you haven't noticed, the situation we're in is \"most terrorists are Muslims,\" not \"most Muslims are terrorists.\" That's why it seems like they're arresting random people for their religion. But you'd have to be pretty dumb to think that's the real reason.\n\nOh, and I will once again point out that there is a difference between \"innocent\" and \"not guilty.\"\n\nWhat happened in Abu Ghraib was difference not of kind, but of degree.\n\nWay to play the \"racism\" angle.\n\nDifferences of degree are important when the subject is torture. The apologists for what has happened do have points that should be heard and clearly understood. It is a fact that every culture and every politics sometimes expresses itself in cruelty.\n\nWhich is one of the reasons we're in Iraq in the first place, in case you forgot.\n\nIt is also undeniably true that other countries have and do torture more routinely, and far more brutally, than ours has. George Orwell once characterized life in Stalin's Russia as \"a boot stamping on a human face forever.\" That was the ultimate culture of cruelty, so ingrained, so organic, so systematic that everyone in it lived in terror, even the terrorizers. And that was the nature and degree of state cruelty in Saddam Hussein's Iraq.\n\nAbout time you said something I can agree with.\n\nWe all know these things, and we need not reassure ourselves and should not congratulate ourselves that our society is less cruel than some others, although it is worth noting that there are many that are less cruel than ours.\n\nName one. Come on. Name one society with more freedom and respect for human rights than ours. I bet you can't. Oh, and Canada doesn't count, since they don't have freedom of speech.\n\nAnd this searing revelation at Abu Ghraib should lead us to examine more thoroughly the routine horrors in our domestic prison system.\n\nI bet you blame Bush for that, too, since he's created a culture of meanness.\n\nBut what we do now, in reaction to Abu Ghraib will determine a great deal about who we are at the beginning of the 21st century. It is important to note that just as the abuses of the prisoners flowed directly from the policies of the Bush White House, those policies flowed not only from the instincts of the president and his advisors, but found support in shifting attitudes on the part of some in our country in response to the outrage and fear generated by the attack of September 11th.\n\nHere we go with \"root causes.\"\n\nThe president exploited and fanned those fears, but some otherwise sensible and levelheaded Americans fed them as well.\n\nBack up. He exploited our fears? WE WERE THE VICTIMS OF THE WORST TERRORIST ATTACK IN THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION, YOU IDIOT! WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? Bush's behavior after the attacks reassured us. It didn't make us more afraid. At least that's the effect it had on me. I'd be terrified if BJ Clinton was in the White House at the time. (Why does nobody ever point out that Clinton's first and middle initials spell BJ, anyway?)\n\nI remember reading genteel-sounding essays asking publicly whether or not the prohibitions against torture were any longer relevant or desirable.\n\nIf the people who flew those planes were still alive, I wouldn't care what we did to 'em.\n\nThe same grotesque misunderstanding of what is really involved was responsible for the tone in the memo from the president's legal advisor, Alberto Gonzalez, who wrote on January 25, 2002, that 9/11 \"renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions.\"\n\nThat's true. The enemy we're fighting now has no respect for the Geneva Convention or \"international law.\" They won't be satisfied until we're either dead or kneeling towards Mecca five times a day. I say we give them what they deserve.\n\nWe have seen the pictures.\n\nTorture 24/7, on CNN!\n\nWe have learned the news. We cannot unlearn it; it is part of us. The important question now is, what will we do now about torture. Stop it? Yes, of course.\n\nThat's why it's been investigated already. Why is that so hard to understand?\n\nBut that means demanding all of the facts, not covering them up, as some now charge the administration is now doing.\n\nHow can you possibly say that unless you haven't turned on the TV for a month?\n\nOne of the whistleblowers at Abu Ghraib, Sergeant Samuel Provance, told ABC News a few days ago that he was being intimidated and punished for telling the truth. \"There is definitely a coverup,\" Provance said. \"I feel like I am being punished for being honest.\"\n\nBy whom? You can't say that Bush is responsible if you have no proof. Again, nice try.\n\nThe abhorrent acts in the prison were a direct consequence of the culture of impunity encouraged, authorized and instituted by Bush and Rumsfeld in their statements that the Geneva Conventions did not apply.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions don't apply to terrorists who aren't in uniform. It's an undeniable fact.\n\nThe apparent war crimes...\n\nAt least he's somewhat honest...\n\n...that took place were the logical, inevitable outcome of policies and statements from the administration.\n\nYeah, because I remember Bush stating that \"any Iraqis who resist our occupation will be stacked nekkid and photographed.\"\n\nTo me, as glaring as the evidence of this in the pictures themselves was the revelation that it was established practice for prisoners to be moved around during ICRC visits so that they would not be available for visits. That, no one can claim, was the act of individuals. That was policy set from above with the direct intention to violate US values it was to be upholding. It was the kind of policy we see - and criticize in places like China and Cuba.\n\nHoly crap, you're an idiot. \"Oh no! Suspected terrorists were denied visits! That's the equivalent of being thrown in a cell for the rest of your life because you criticized the government!\"\n\nMoreover, the administration has also set up the men and women of our own armed forces for payback the next time they are held as prisoners.\n\n\"Because American prisoners were treated with the utmost respect before Bush poisoned the well of human decency!!!\" You know, you're just giving them an excuse, like the people who murdered Nick Berg. They know that you'll throw a tantrum if they say that they committed atrocities because of something we did. It's best to STFU and let the military deal with it.\n\nAnd by the way, if you want a valid comparison of this war to Vietnam, look at the treatment of POWs by the enemy.\n\nAnd for that, this administration should pay a very high price. One of the most tragic consequences of these official crimes is that it will be very hard for any of us as Americans - at least for a very long time - to effectively stand up for human rights elsewhere and criticize other governments, when our policies have resulted in our soldiers behaving so monstrously.\n\nIf they were monsters, their victims wouldn't be alive to tell about what happened. And guess what? We still have moral authority when it comes to human rights, because unlike Hussein, Castro, or Kim Jong Il, we actually punish the people who do these things. That's how we exercise that authority.\n\nThis administration has shamed America and deeply damaged the cause of freedom and human rights everywhere, thus undermining the core message of America to the world.\n\nWhat message do you want to send the world? \"America: We'll bend over and take it!\"\n\nPresident Bush offered a brief and half-hearted apology to the Arab world - but he should apologize to the American people for abandoning the Geneva Conventions.\n\nTHE. F**KING. GENEVA. CONVENTIONS. DON'T. APPLY. TO. TERRORISTS.\n\nHe also owes an apology to the U.S. Army for cavalierly sending them into harm's way while ignoring the best advice of their commanders.\n\nYou mean their retired commanders and two anonymous sources? How dare he actually send soldiers to do their job when a couple people might disagree with it!!!11oneone!!!\n\nPerhaps most importantly of all, he should apologize to all those men and women throughout our world who have held the ideal of the United States of America as a shining goal, to inspire their hopeful efforts to bring about justice under a rule of law in their own lands.\n\nI guess Ted Kennedy was sober enough to co-author this monstrosity of a speech.\n\nOf course, the problem with all these legitimate requests is that a sincere apology requires an admission of error, a willingness to accept responsibility and to hold people accountable.\n\nWe're demolishing the frickin' prison, aren't we? That seems to be a pretty solid admission of error. However, it's pretty hard to admit that you're guilty of something YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH.\n\nAnd President Bush is not only unwilling to acknowledge error.\n\nI think I just covered that one.\n\nHe has thus far been unwilling to hold anyone in his administration accountable for the worst strategic and military miscalculations and mistakes in the history of the United States of America.\n\nThat was the biggest exaggeration since the Great Exaggeration Festival back in '87. Are you forgetting a little thing called \"Vietnam,\" which you liberals seem obsessed with? Or the fact that we've lost fewer soldiers in this war than almost every other war in our history except Gulf War I? I really find it hard to believe that they don't know how outrageous these claims are.\n\nHe is willing only to apologize for the alleged erratic behavior of a few low-ranking enlisted people, who he is scapegoating for his policy fiasco.\n\nClassic. \"It's never the fault of the people who did it! Let's climb the blame tree!\"\n\nIn December of 2000, even though I strongly disagreed with the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to order a halt to the counting of legally cast ballots, I saw it as my duty to reaffirm my own strong belief that we are a nation of laws and not only accept the decision, but do what I could to prevent efforts to delegitimize George Bush as he took the oath of office as president.\n\nThose \"legally cast ballots\" had already been counted. You just wanted to see if a miracle could somehow make a few more of them say \"Gore/Lieberman.\"\n\nI did not at that moment imagine that Bush would, in the presidency that ensued, demonstrate utter contempt for the rule of law and work at every turn to frustrate accountability...\n\nAgain, the only people doing this are on your side. Bush hasn't done anywhere near enough to combat the violations of American government practices by the left. For example, the 9th Circuit Court still exists.\n\nSo today, I want to speak on behalf of those Americans who feel that President Bush has betrayed our nation's trust, those who are horrified at what has been done in our name, and all those who want the rest of the world to know that we Americans see the abuses that occurred in the prisons of Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo and secret locations as yet undisclosed...\n\nI always think it's hilarious when people refer to \"secrets\" as if everyone knew about them, which would, of course, make them no longer secret.\n\n...as completely out of keeping with the character and basic nature of the American people and at odds with the principles on which America stands.\n\nThe fact that you're allowed to leak this verbal diarrhea into the ears of your moonbat minions proves that we're still honoring the principles of America.\n\nI believe we have a duty to hold President Bush accountable - and I believe we will. As Lincoln said at our time of greatest trial, \"We - even we here - hold the power, and bear the responsibility.\"\n\nUnfortunately, when you attack the president with false accusations and pretend that he can see everything happening in Iraq, you lose a ton of credibility.\n\nAnd one more thing: It's almost time for a new election. You can take the sour grapes out of your mouth now.\n\nPosted by CD at 06:15 PM | Comments (4)\n\nToo...Much...Insanity\n\nI think I'm spent for today. The fourth and final edition of \"Fisking the Gorebot\" will be posted sometime Friday afternoon. I'm on a fact-finding mission right now.\n\nPosted by CD at 09:55 PM | Comments (0)\n\nFisking the Gorebot: Part 3\n\nPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nContinuing with the crazy Algore MoveOn speech, we have the beginning of his \"everyone should resign\" rant:\n\nIn my opinion, John Kerry is dealing with this unfolding tragedy in an impressive and extremely responsible way.\n\nWait a couple days, then see if you still think that.\n\nOur nation's best interest lies in having a new president who can turn a new page, sweep clean with a new broom, and take office on January 20th of next year with the ability to make a fresh assessment of exactly what our nation's strategic position is as of the time the reigns of power are finally wrested from the group of incompetents that created this catastrophe.\n\nToo bad Kerry wants to apologize for all the horrible tragedies we caused and then go back to treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue. Because that sure worked well in the past.\n\nKerry should not tie his own hands by offering overly specific, detailed proposals concerning a situation that is rapidly changing and unfortunately, rapidly deteriorating...\n\nSo why are you criticizing Bush for not having a plan?\n\n...but should rather preserve his, and our country's, options, to retrieve our national honor as soon as this long national nightmare is over.\n\nThe nightmare will be over when the terrorists are dead.\n\nEisenhower did not propose a five-point plan for changing America's approach to the Korean War when he was running for president in 1952.\n\nNeither did Bush. He proposed a five-point plan for finishing what we started.\n\nWhen a business enterprise finds itself in deep trouble that is linked to the failed policies of the current CEO the board of directors and stockholders usually say to the failed CEO, \"Thank you very much, but we're going to replace you now with a new CEO -- one less vested in a stubborn insistence on staying the course, even if that course is, in the words of General Zinni, \"Headed over Niagara Falls.\"\n\nUnfortunately, when a business enterprise encounters problems, its competitors don't blow up the building they're in. And I really don't think Kerry's plan of \"using the same strategy that led to 9/11\" is going to make us a whole lot safer.\n\nOne of the strengths of democracy is the ability of the people to regularly demand changes in leadership and to fire a failing leader and hire a new one with the promise of hopeful change.\n\nOr, if the other option is a leader who has no idea how to handle terrorism, we can keep the current one.\n\nThat is the real solution to America's quagmire in Iraq.\n\nWhy am I not surprised that he used that word?\n\nBut, I am keenly aware that we have seven months and twenty five days remaining in this president's current term of office and that represents a time of dangerous vulnerability for our country because of the demonstrated incompetence and recklessness of the current administration.\n\nI'd be more worried about Al Qaeda's \"attack before an election\" technique than Bush's supposed failures. But I guess that real threats aren't as important as political points.\n\nIt is therefore essential that even as we focus on the fateful choice, the voters must make this November that we simultaneously search for ways to sharply reduce the extraordinary danger that we face with the current leadership team in place.\n\nAnd now, we reach the point where Gore totally loses it...\n\nIt is for that reason that I am calling today for Republicans as well as Democrats to join me in asking for the immediate resignations of those immediately below George Bush and Dick Cheney who are most responsible for creating the catastrophe that we are facing in Iraq.\n\nGreat! Let's completely dismantle the current administration before the election, rather than waiting to do it the American way. How patriotic.\n\nWe desperately need a national security team with at least minimal competence because the current team is making things worse with each passing day. They are endangering the lives of our soldiers, and sharply increasing the danger faced by American citizens everywhere in the world, including here at home.\n\nI had no idea that killing terrorists transports them here.\n\nThey are enraging hundreds of millions of people and embittering an entire generation of anti-Americans whose rage is already near the boiling point.\n\nYou're talking about yourself, right?\n\nWe simply cannot afford to further increase the risk to our country with more blunders by this team. Donald Rumsfeld, as the chief architect of the war plan, should resign today.\n\nSuccessful war plan=Bad Secretary of Defense. O...kay.\n\nHis deputies Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith and his intelligence chief Stephen Cambone should also resign. The nation is especially at risk every single day that Rumsfeld remains as Secretary of Defense.\n\nAnd who should take his place? I think we'd be in even more supposed danger with no secretary of defense, or with one that has little to no experience and has to take over in the middle of the war.\n\nCondoleeza Rice, who has badly mishandled the coordination of national security policy, should also resign immediately.\n\nNotice how he gives no examples, but expects people to accept this as fact. Baaah. Baaaah. Why do I suddenly have the urge to buy a sweater?\n\nGeorge Tenet should also resign. I want to offer a special word about George Tenet, because he is a personal friend and I know him to be a good and decent man. It is especially painful to call for his resignation, but I have regretfully concluded that it is extremely important that our country have new leadership at the CIA immediately.\n\nOh, so being a \"good and decent man\" is a sign of competence? Tell that to Jimmy Carter.\n\nAs a nation, our greatest export has always been hope: hope that through the rule of law people can be free to pursue their dreams, that democracy can supplant repression and that justice, not power, will be the guiding force in society.\n\nAnd yet, you're against the spread of democracy because you think the president and his administration are evil.\n\nOur moral authority in the world derived from the hope anchored in the rule of law. With this blatant failure of the rule of law from the very agents of our government, we face a great challenge in restoring our moral authority in the world and demonstrating our commitment to bringing a better life to our global neighbors.\n\nYeah, let's cave in to this nebulous international emotion. That'll give us a great image as a nation of weaklings. Terrorists would never attack a weak nation.\n\nDuring Ronald Reagan's Presidency, Secretary of Labor Ray Donovan was accused of corruption, but eventually, after a lot of publicity, the indictment was thrown out by the Judge. Donovan asked the question, \"Where do I go to get my reputation back?\" President Bush has now placed the United States of America in the same situation. Where do we go to get our good name back?\n\nWe never had a good name. When you're on top, people are jealous. Unless you want to sacrifice our authority to the \"international community,\" you have to deal with the fact that some people hate us. I will once again use the analogy of \"popular kids vs. nerds.\" Everyone hates the nerds, but they go on to be the influential ones, while popular people often end up in prison.\n\nThe answer is, we go where we always go when a dramatic change is needed. We go to the ballot box, and we make it clear to the rest of the world that what's been happening in America for the last four years, and what America has been doing in Iraq for the last two years, really is not who we are.\n\n\"But first, let's force everyone to resign so we can get a head start!\"\n\nWe, as a people, at least the overwhelming majority of us, do not endorse the decision to dishonor the Geneva Convention and the Bill of Rights....\n\nTHE BILL OF RIGHTS?! Did you just pull that out of your @ss?\n\nMake no mistake, the damage done at Abu Ghraib is not only to America's reputation and America's strategic interests, but also to America's spirit. It is also crucial for our nation to recognize - and to recognize quickly - that the damage our nation has suffered in the world is far, far more serious than President Bush's belated and tepid response would lead people to believe.\n\nAnd you're really helping by blathering on about how horrible we are. It's almost as if you want people to hate us.\n\nRemember how shocked each of us, individually, was when we first saw those hideous images. The natural tendency was to first recoil from the images, and then to assume that they represented a strange and rare aberration that resulted from a few twisted minds or, as the Pentagon assured us, \"a few bad apples.\"\n\nAnd everyone capable of independent thought realized that this was, indeed, the case, which is why the soldiers in question were reported by their peers and punished accordingly.\n\nBut as today's shocking news reaffirms yet again, this was not rare. It was not an aberration. Today's New York Times reports that an Army survey of prisoner deaths and mistreatment in Iraq and Afghanisatan \"show a widespread pattern of abuse involving more military units than previously known.'\n\nYeah, because I'm sure terrorists are always well-behaved and don't require any additional force to restrain them.\n\nNor did these abuses spring from a few twisted minds at the lowest ranks of our military enlisted personnel. No, it came from twisted values and atrocious policies at the highest levels of our government. This was done in our name, by our leaders.\n\nNotice the jump from \"this was done by the military\" to \"this was clearly done by Bush.\" Does Dubya practice some sort of astral projection now?\n\nThese horrors were the predictable consequence of policy choices that flowed directly from this administration's contempt for the rule of law.\n\n...Said the guy who needed the Supreme Court to convince him that the Constitution is valid.\n\nAnd the dominance they have been seeking is truly not simply unworthy of America - it is also an illusory goal in its own right.\n\nWhat frickin' dominance is he talking about? We got rid of the frickin' dictator, in case you missed it.\n\nOur world is unconquerable because the human spirit is unconquerable, and any national strategy based on pursuing the goal of domination is doomed to fail because it generates its own opposition, and in the process, creates enemies for the would-be dominator.\n\nAll right, that's it. WE'RE NOT DOMINATING ANYONE. We went into a country that was in the grip of a raping, murdering, fascist dictator, and now we're in the process of eliminating his brainwashed minions so the real Iraqis can govern themselves. We're only \"dominating\" people who wanted to continue the reign of terror. This \"conqueror\" crap makes me want to vomit.\n\nA policy based on domination of the rest of the world...\n\nGreat, now Bush is a megalomaniacal James Bond villain who wants to take over the world. SHUT YOUR F**KING MOUTH, YOU F**KING LOON.\n\n...not only creates enemies for the United States and creates recruits for Al Qaeda...\n\nAl Qaeda recruits are created when women show their f**king ankles in public.\n\n...it also undermines the international cooperation that is essential to defeating the efforts of terrorists who wish harm and intimidate Americans.\n\nAllow me to translate: \"It's essential to combat terrorism, but we can't invade other countries or use force, because that might hurt their feelings. Therefore, we can only use diplomacy and make friends with the whole world if we want to be safe. Break out the marshmallows and firewood, because we're gonna sing 'Kumbaya!'\"\n\nUnilateralism, as we have painfully seen in Iraq...\n\nI just realized that if we're really a global community like Gore says, any action is unilateral. Heh heh. What an idiot.\n\n...is its own reward. Going it alone may satisfy a political instinct but it is dangerous to our military, even without their Commander in Chief taunting terrorists to \"bring it on.\"\n\nWE DIDN'T GO IN UNILATERALLY. I think that everyone should've walked out on him the second he made that fantastically flawed claim, but I know that they all believe it too. That Kool-Aid must be friggin' delicious. Maybe they stir it in giant tinfoil bowls.\n\nOur troops are stretched thin and exhausted not only because Secretary Rumsfeld contemptuously dismissed the advice of military leaders on the size of the needed force - but also because President Bush's contempt for traditional allies and international opinion left us without a real coalition to share the military and financial burden of the war and the occupation.\n\nWhat exactly would a \"real coalition\" entail, anyway? I have a feeling that we could have the support of every single human being on the planet except the American left, and they would call it unilateral because they didn't like it.\n\nOur future is dependent upon increasing cooperation and interdependence in a world tied ever more closely together by technologies of communications and travel.\n\nThat's why we're killing people who use communication and travel for evil. You know, like flying civilian airliners into buildings.\n\nThe emergence of a truly global civilization has been accompanied by the recognition of truly global challenges that require global responses that, as often as not, can only be led by the United States - and only if the United States restores and maintains its moral authority to lead.\n\nF**K!!!! F**KITY F**K F**K F**K!!!!!! Now he thinks that we should lead?!!! Even after he just said that we can only act when the rest of the world gives us their approval? F*************************K!!!!!\n\nMake no mistake, it is precisely our moral authority that is our greatest source of strength, and it is precisely our moral authority that has been recklessly put at risk by the cheap calculations and mean compromises of conscience wagered with history by this willful president.\n\nOh no! They're \"mean!\" Someone get little Albert his apple juice so he'll shut up.\n\nListen to the way Israel's highest court dealt with a similar question when, in 1999, it was asked to balance due process rights against dire threats to the security of its people:\n\n\"This is the destiny of democracy, as not all means are acceptable to it, and not all practices employed by its enemies are open before it. Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand. Preserving the Rule of Law and recognition of an individual's liberty constitutes an important component in its understanding of security. At the end of the day they (add to) its strength.\"\n\nWhat does that prove, except that we have the final decision in matters of fighting terror? We haven't resorted to purposely slaughtering non-combatants like our enemy, so I don't see the problem here.\n\nThe last and best description of America's meaning in the world is still the definitive formulation of Lincoln's annual message to Congress on December 1, 1862:\n\n\"The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise - with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country. Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history...the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation...We shall nobly save, or meanly lose the last best hope of earth...The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just - a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless.\"\n\nWell, you know what? For us, that \"fiery trial\" was 9/11. We're preventing it from happening again by wiping Al Qaeda off the face of the Earth. Some Americans will die in the process, but if they don't, millions more will.\n\nOh, and one more thing: LINCOLN. FOUGHT. A. WAR. TO. PRESERVE. THE COUNTRY.\n\nWay to refute your own points.\n\nPosted by CD at 09:15 PM | Comments (1)\n\nFisking the Gorebot: Part 2\n\nPart 1 is here.\n\nThis next section is a bit beyond my area of expertise, so it's not going to be brilliant, but I have to get through it so I can return to the good stuff. Let's begin...\n\nWhen a senior, respected military leader like Joe Hoar uses the word \"abyss\", then the rest of us damn well better listen. Here is what he means: more American soldiers dying, Iraq slipping into worse chaos and violence, no end in sight, with our influence and moral authority seriously damaged.\n\nI guess that's why Iraqis are getting ready to take control of the government, hold national elections, and write a new constitution.\n\nRetired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, who headed Central Command before becoming President Bush's personal emissary to the Middle East, said recently that our nation's current course is \"headed over Niagara Falls.\"\n\nOpinion, meet facts. Facts, beat the living crap out of opinion. Thank you.\n\nThe Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, Army Major General Charles H. Swannack, Jr., asked by the Washington Post whether he believes the United States is losing the war in Iraq, replied, \"I think strategically, we are.\" Army Colonel Paul Hughes, who directed strategic planning for the US occupation authority in Baghdad, compared what he sees in Iraq to the Vietnam War, in which he lost his brother:\n\nThat's a shock. To some people, every war is Vietnam.\n\n\"I promised myself when I came on active duty that I would do everything in my power to prevent that ... from happening again.\"\n\nIt's not happening again. For one thing, we were fighting an organized army in Vietnam, not a \"radical cleric\" leading a bunch of \"insurgents.\"\n\nNoting that Vietnam featured a pattern of winning battles while losing the war, Hughes added \"unless we ensure that we have coherence in our policy, we will lose strategically.\"\n\nThat's why we have a plan. As much as the media wants to pretend that there's no \"exit strategy,\" it's just not valid.\n\nThe White House spokesman, Dan Bartlett was asked on live television about these scathing condemnations by Generals involved in the highest levels of Pentagon planning and he replied, \"Well they're retired, and we take our advice from active duty officers.\"\n\nWhere's the problem? I think the people who are actually involved with the mission have a better idea of how it works.\n\nBut amazingly, even active duty military officers are speaking out against President Bush. For example, the Washington Post quoted an unnamed senior General at the Pentagon as saying, \" the current OSD (Office of the Secretary of Defense) refused to listen or adhere to military advice.\" Rarely if ever in American history have uniformed commanders felt compelled to challenge their commander in chief in public.\n\nDoesn't this go against your whole \"abuse of power\" screed? It seems like they should be silenced by the Ashcroft Dissent Crushing Squadsâ¢.\n\nThe Post also quoted an unnamed general as saying, \"Like a lot of senior Army guys I'm quite angry\" with Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush Administration. He listed two reasons. \"I think they are going to break the Army,\" he said, adding that what really incites him is \"I don't think they care.\"\n\nWow. So two anonymous sources represent the entire military. Kind of like 7 prison guards.\n\nIn his upcoming book, Zinni blames the current catastrophe on the Bush team's incompetence early on. \"In the lead-up to the Iraq war, and its later conduct,\" he writes, \"I saw at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility, at worst, lying, incompetence and corruption.\"\n\nWow, another book accusing Bush of being incompetent...*yawn*...\n\nZinni's book will join a growing library of volumes by former advisors to Bush -- including his principal advisor on terrorism, Richard Clarke; his principal economic policy advisor, former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, former Ambassador Joe Wilson, who was honored by Bush's father for his service in Iraq, and his former Domestic Adviser on faith-based organizations, John Dilulio, who said, \"There is no precedent in any modern White House for what is going on in this one: a complete lack of a policy apparatus. What you've got is everything, and I mean everything, run by the political arm. It's the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis.\"\n\nWhat kind of \"policy apparatus\" would you suggest then? The Commander in Chief is supposed to make decisions occasionally.\n\nArmy Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki told Congress in February that the occupation could require \"several hundred thousand troops.\" But because Rumsfeld and Bush did not want to hear disagreement with their view that Iraq could be invaded at a much lower cost, Shinseki was hushed and then forced out.\n\nI'm sure it was really that simple.\n\nAnd as a direct result of this incompetent plan and inadequate troop strength, young soldiers were put in an untenable position. For example, young reservists assigned to the Iraqi prisons were called up without training or adequate supervision, and were instructed by their superiors to \"break down\" prisoners in order to prepare them for interrogation.\n\nSince when is that not standard procedure? The information we get from prisoners could save lives.\n\nTo make matters worse, they were placed in a confusing situation where the chain of command was criss-crossed between intelligence gathering and prison administration, and further confused by an unprecedented mixing of military and civilian contractor authority.\n\nThose meddling mercenaries.\n\nThe soldiers who are accused of committing these atrocities are, of course, responsible for their own actions and if found guilty, must be severely and appropriately punished.\n\nOh, but that's not enough, is it? We have to pretend that the Bush administration personally ordered and observed every last abuse that took place.\n\nBut they are not the ones primarily responsible for the disgrace that has been brought upon the United States of America.\n\nSee?\n\nPrivate Lynndie England did not make the decision that the United States would not observe the Geneva Convention.\n\nThat's actually true. She did, however, make the decision to act like an idiot and then pose for pictures, which was 100% her fault.\n\nSpecialist Charles Graner was not the one who approved a policy of establishing an American Gulag...\n\nOoooooh, let's use Soviet terminology to demonize the eeeeevil Bush Regime. Scary.\n\n...of dark rooms with naked prisoners...\n\nIsn't that the kind of thing the left is in favor of? Maybe I'm just thinking of Massachusetts...\n\n...to be \"stressed\" and even - we must use the word - tortured - to force them to say things that legal procedures might not induce them to say.\n\nSince \"legal procedures\" basically consist of begging them to divulge information that could cause their side to lose the war, I don't see why everyone is so upset. The actions at Abu Ghraib were unnecessary, but if those prisoners actually had valuable things to tell us, we should've done whatever was necessary to win. That's \"overwhelming force\" for you.\n\nThese policies were designed and insisted upon by the Bush White House.\n\nOh, is that why they're apologizing for it, instead of refusing to listen to dissent like you keep implying?\n\nIndeed, the President's own legal counsel advised him specifically on the subject. His secretary of defense and his assistants pushed these cruel departures from historic American standards over the objections of the uniformed military, just as the Judge Advocates General within the Defense Department were so upset and opposed that they took the unprecedented step of seeking help from a private lawyer in this city who specializes in human rights and said to him, \"There is a calculated effort to create an atmosphere of legal ambiguity\" where the mistreatment of prisoners is concerned.\"\n\nThat was just a tangent. I can't figure out which part of it was actually useful.\n\nIndeed, the secrecy of the program indicates an understanding that the regular military culture and mores would not support these activities and neither would the American public or the world community.\n\nWhich is why they've been INVESTIGATING IT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.\n\nAnother implicit acknowledgement of violations of accepted standards of behavior is the process of farming out prisoners to countries less averse to torture and giving assignments to private contractors.\n\nBecause contractors will never respect the rules, ever.\n\nPresident Bush set the tone for our attitude for suspects in his State of the Union address. He noted that more than 3,000 \"suspected terrorists\" had been arrested in many countries and then he added, \"and many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way: they are no longer a problem to the United States and our allies.\"\n\nThat's a good thing. Unless you feel sorry for murderers.\n\nGeorge Bush promised to change the tone in Washington. And indeed he did. As many as 37 prisoners may have been murdered while in captivity, though the numbers are difficult to rely upon because in many cases involving violent death, there were no autopsies.\n\nAnd I bet they were all innocent, and none of the perpetrators were punished, right?\n\nHow dare they blame their misdeeds on enlisted personnel from a Reserve unit in upstate New York.\n\nHow dare you pretend that they control everything the military does!\n\nPresident Bush owes more than one apology. On the list of those he let down are the young soldiers who are themselves apparently culpable, but who were clearly put into a moral cesspool.\n\n\"Free will? Wasn't that a movie about a killer whale?\"\n\nThe perpetrators as well as the victims were both placed in their relationship to one another by the policies of George W. Bush.\n\nBrilliant deduction, Holmes. I'm so ashamed that you're not our president, because we need a superb mind like yours to tell us that when a president declares war, soldiers are sent there.\n\nHow dare the incompetent and willful members of this Bush/Cheney Administration humiliate our nation and our people in the eyes of the world and in the conscience of our own people.\n\nThey haven't dared to do that yet, because they didn't order the abuse.\n\nHow dare they subject us to such dishonor and disgrace. How dare they drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein's torture prison.\n\nIf the actions of those soldiers were really as bad as when Saddam was in power, they'd need to dig more mass graves. His prisoners didn't live to tell about what he did to them. And did I forget to mention that Hussein actually ordered those tortures, unlike Bush? In fact, he and his psychotic spawn actually participated in many executions. There's some perspective for ya.\n\nDavid Kay concluded his search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq with the famous verdict: \"we were all wrong.\"\n\nWow, out of context quotes prove so much. \"We were all wrong\" could mean anything, especially since our intelligence is quite clearly not perfect.\n\nAnd for many Americans, Kay's statement seemed to symbolize the awful collision between Reality and all of the false and fading impressions President Bush had fostered in building support for his policy of going to war.\n\nNow we're back to \"Bush lied, there were no WMD!\"\n\nNow the White House has informed the American people that they were also \"all wrong\" about their decision to place their faith in Ahmed Chalabi, even though they have paid him 340,000 dollars per month. 33 million dollars (CHECK) and placed him adjacent to Laura Bush at the State of the Union address. Chalabi had been convicted of fraud and embezzling 70 million dollars in public funds from a Jordanian bank, and escaped prison by fleeing the country. But in spite of that record, he had become one of key advisors to the Bush Administration on planning and promoting the War against Iraq.\n\nAnd now that they're re-evaluating that decision, you've suddenly decided that it's a sign of weakness to change course? Doesn't all that cognitive dissonance give you a headache?\n\nAnd they repeatedly cited him as an authority, perhaps even a future president of Iraq. Incredibly, they even ferried him and his private army into Baghdad in advance of anyone else, and allowed him to seize control over Saddam's secret papers.\n\nNow they are telling the American people that he is a spy for Iran who has been duping the President of the United States for all these years.\n\nI think it's interesting how you accept the truth of that statement immediately, even after all the ranting about how Bush lies to us. Oh, wait, I forgot that if it's bad for America, it must be true.\n\nOne of the Generals in charge of this war policy went on a speaking tour in his spare time to declare before evangelical groups that the US is in a holy war as \"Christian Nation battling Satan.\"\n\nI'd believe that. Look at who we're fighting.\n\nThis same General Boykin was the person who ordered the officer who was in charge of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay to extend his methods to Iraq detainees, prisoners. ... The testimony from the prisoners is that they were forced to curse their religion Bush used the word \"crusade\" early on in the war against Iraq, and then commentators pointed out that it was singularly inappropriate because of the history and sensitivity of the Muslim world and then a few weeks later he used it again.\n\nOh no! We might hurt their precious feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelings!!!!\n\n\"We are now being viewed as the modern Crusaders, as the modern colonial power in this part of the world,\" Zinni said.\n\nThat is utter bulls**t, all right? If we were colonizing, we wouldn't be turning over government power to the Iraqis; We'd be putting Bush in charge of the country and treating it like the 51st state.\n\nWhat a terrible irony that our country, which was founded by refugees seeking religious freedom - coming to America to escape domineering leaders who tried to get them to renounce their religion - would now be responsible for this kind of abuse.\n\nYeah, telling prisoners to renounce their religion is equivalent to establishing a national church. Whatever you say, Gore-on.\n\nAmeen Saeed al-Sheikh told the Washington Post that he was tortured and ordered to denounce Islam and after his leg was broken one of his torturers started hitting it while ordering him to curse Islam and then, \" they ordered me to thank Jesus that I'm alive.\" Others reported that they were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol.\n\nHorrible. I'm flabbergasted.\n\nIn my religious tradition, I have been taught that \"ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit... Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.\"\n\nYes, and we now know that Lynndie England, Charles Graner, and the rest are f**king douchebags who should be court martialed.\n\nThe President convinced a majority of the country that Saddam Hussein was responsible for attacking us on September 11th.\n\nThat's funny, because I distinctly remember him naming Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda whenever he referred to the attack, and I've never, in the nearly 3 years since then, heard anyone say that Saddam did it. Ever. In fact, the only time I hear that is when people like you claim that everyone believed it. That's odd...\n\nBut in truth he had nothing whatsoever to do with it.\n\nNobody said that he did.\n\nThe President convinced the country with a mixture of forged documents and blatantly false assertions that Saddam was in league with Al Qaeda, and that he was \"indistinguishable\" from Osama bin Laden.\n\nBased on his statement that \"We will make no distinction between those who committed these acts and those who harbor them,\" he technically is indistinguishable from bin Laden. That's called consistency. Hooray.\n\nHe asked the nation , in his State of the Union address, to \"imagine\" how terrified we should be that Saddam was about to give nuclear weapons to terrorists and stated repeatedly that Iraq posed a grave and gathering threat to our nation.\n\nAs I pointed out in Part 1, you also said that. Are you going to go on an insane tirade against yourself? Based on your ability to believe two things at once, I think that would be possible. And entertaining.\n\nHe planted the seeds of war...\n\nRadical Islam planted the seeds of war. We're just digging them up and destroying them.\n\n...and harvested a whirlwind. And now, the \"corrupt tree\" of a war waged on false premises\n\nNo, no, no, no, that's all wrong. The correct phrase is \"false pretenses.\" Haven't you been reading the opinion pages lately?\n\n...has brought us the \"evil fruit\" of Americans torturing and humiliating prisoners.\n\n7 of them. 7 Americans. Who are being investigated and punished. More than Saddam ever did, since he actually set up the entire system.\n\nWow, that was less than effective, but the next section will be better.\n\nPosted by CD at 07:45 PM | Comments (2)\n\nFisking the Gorebot: Part 1\n\nAll right, this is going to be quite a daunting task (how often do you see that phrase online?), but I am determined to fisk every last sentence of Al Gore's deranged MoveOn speech. I'll have to do it in several parts. I haven't figured out how many. In any case, I'll put the whole thing in the extended entry, as I usually do with huge posts.\n\nEnough introductions. I'm just going to dive right in and see what happens:\n\nGeorge W. Bush promised us a foreign policy with humility. Instead, he has brought us humiliation in the eyes of the world.\n\nIf you liberal idiots really cared about our international reputation, you wouldn't be bending over backwards to make it look like the Abu Ghraib abuses represent our entire military.\n\nHe promised to \"restore honor and integrity to the White House.\" Instead, he has brought deep dishonor to our country and built a durable reputation as the most dishonest President since Richard Nixon.\n\n\"Bush lied! Bush lied!\" Even the former vice president is parroting this pathetic smear now. I love how they can NEVER PROVIDE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. We just have to trust them, since everyone knows that Republicans are liars. After all, if they were honest, they wouldn't agree with the eeeeeeevil right wing agenda.\n\nHonor? He decided not to honor the Geneva Convention.\n\nYeah, because he ordered those poor, innocent guards to stack prisoners naked and take photos. And by the way, THE GENEVA CONVENTION ONLY APPLIES TO SOLDIERS IN UNIFORM! Terrorists disguised as civilians have no rights.\n\nJust as he would not honor the United Nations, international treaties, the opinions of our allies, the role of Congress and the courts...\n\nI find it interesting that all those groups agreed that Saddam needed to be taken out. But I guess they were just lied to by the horrible Bush Regime.\n\n...or what Jefferson described as \"a decent respect for the opinion of mankind.\"\n\nWell, I believe that about 70% of Americans were for the war. And I'm sure the Iraqis really loved Saddam more than freedom.\n\nHe did not honor the advice, experience and judgment of our military leaders in designing his invasion of Iraq.\n\nCould've fooled me.\n\nAnd now he will not honor our fallen dead by attending any funerals or even by permitting photos of their flag-draped coffins.\n\nAttending funerals would dishonor the dead, because it would take attention away from them and their accomplishments, as well as depriving the family of an opportunity to pay their last respects. And you sick freaks are obsessed with photos of flag-draped coffins because you know that people will have an emotional reaction to them and might not be as supportive of the war. Which puts our troops in more danger, and creates even more coffins. They're soldiers, not pawns.\n\nHow did we get from September 12th , 2001, when a leading French newspaper ran a giant headline with the words \"We Are All Americans Now\" and when we had the good will and empathy of all the world -- to the horror that we all felt in witnessing the pictures of torture in Abu Ghraib.\n\nThe horror! The horror!!! How about the horror that we felt in witnessing the 9/11 attacks? Do you really believe that those poor, mistreated prisoners wouldn't have flown those planes themselves if given the chance? We treated them better than they deserve.\n\nTo begin with, from its earliest days in power, this administration sought to radically destroy the foreign policy consensus that had guided America since the end of World War II.\n\nFrom its earliest days in power? What the f**k were they doing before 9/11 that was so horrible for us?\n\nThe long successful strategy of containment was abandoned in favor of the new strategy of \"preemption.\"\n\nThat's because the strategy of containment resulted in crooked deals with European countries, violations of cease-fire agreements, development of illegal weapons, and mass graves, you droning douche.\n\nAnd what they meant by preemption was not the inherent right of any nation to act preemptively against an imminent threat to its national security...\n\nDid you miss the part where Bush said that we must act before the threat is imminent?\n\n...but rather an exotic new approach that asserted a unique and unilateral...\n\n\"Because it's not a coalition without France and Germany!\"\n\n...U.S. right to ignore international law wherever it wished to do so...\n\nYeah, too bad it was in response to violations of international law by SADDAM HUSSEIN.\n\n...and take military action against any nation, even in circumstances where there was no imminent threat.\n\nYou f**king moron, that's exactly the point. If he was already an imminent threat, it would be even more risky to take him on, because he might be able to friggin' nuke us. You just don't get it, do you?\n\nAll that is required, in the view of Bush's team is the mere assertion of a possible, future threat - and the assertion need be made by only one person, the President.\n\nYeah, I remember that whole \"rush to war,\" where Bush forced us to go to Iraq based on his assertions alone. In fact, here's one of the more forceful quotations from that period:\n\n\"Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.\"\n\nNow, who could've said such a horribly dishonest thing? Oh, now I remember: YOU!\n\nMore disturbing still was their frequent use of the word \"dominance\" to describe their strategic goal, because an American policy of dominance is as repugnant to the rest of the world as the ugly dominance of the helpless, naked Iraqi prisoners has been to the American people. Dominance is as dominance does.\n\nWell, thanks for the enlightenment, Forrest. I'm so glad that you can compare mistreatment of a couple dozen prisoners to the liberation of 25 million people.\n\nDominance is not really a strategic policy or political philosophy at all. It is a seductive illusion that tempts the powerful to satiate their hunger for more power still by striking a Faustian bargain.\n\nI think we're taking a ride into the imperialism zone. Scary.\n\nAnd as always happens - sooner or later - to those who shake hands with the devil, they find out too late that what they have given up in the bargain is their soul.\n\nI think that translates to \"Bush is evil.\" How original.\n\nOne of the clearest indications of the impending loss of intimacy with one's soul...\n\nWhen did you decide that you're an expert on metaphysics, you idiot?\n\n...is the failure to recognize the existence of a soul in those over whom power is exercised, especially if the helpless come to be treated as animals, and degraded.\n\n*cough* PLASTIC SHREDDERS *cough cough*\n\nWe also know - and not just from De Sade and Freud - the psychological proximity between sexual depravity and other people's pain.\n\nIf he starts talking about weird S&M fantasies, I'm leaving.\n\nIt has been especially shocking and awful to see these paired evils perpetrated so crudely and cruelly in the name of America.\n\nBy a whole 7 people.\n\nThose pictures of torture and sexual abuse came to us embedded in a wave of news about escalating casualties and growing chaos enveloping our entire policy in Iraq.\n\nYou've been watching too much CNN.\n\nBut in order understand the failure of our overall policy, it is important to focus specifically on what happened in the Abu Ghraib prison...\n\n\"...because that's the only ammunition we've got left!\"\n\n...and ask whether or not those actions were representative of who we are as Americans? Obviously the quick answer is no, but unfortunately it's more complicated than that.\n\nI'm surprised he didn't say \"nuanced.\"\n\nThere is good and evil in every person. And what makes the United States special in the history of nations is our commitment to the rule of law and our carefully constructed system of checks and balances. Our natural distrust of concentrated power and our devotion to openness and democracy are what have lead us as a people to consistently choose good over evil in our collective aspirations more than the people any other nation.\n\nOkay, now you're just trying to throw off people who want to question your patriotism.\n\nOur founders were insightful students of human nature. They feared the abuse of power because they understood that every human being has not only \"better angels\" in his nature, but also an innate vulnerability to temptation - especially the temptation to abuse power over others.\n\nOur founders understood full well that a system of checks and balances is needed in our constitution because every human being lives with an internal system of checks and balances that cannot be relied upon to produce virtue if they are allowed to attain an unhealthy degree of power over their fellow citizens.\n\nYou really could've found a way to say that in less time.\n\nListen then to the balance of internal impulses described by specialist Charles Graner when confronted by one of his colleagues, Specialist Joseph M. Darby, who later became a courageous whistleblower.\n\n*GASP!* You mean another soldier reported the abuse, not the heroic American media?! I am shocked, SHOCKED! to hear that! He must be the exception, not the rule!!!!\n\nWhen Darby asked him to explain his actions documented in the photos, Graner replied: \"The Christian in me says it's wrong, but the Corrections Officer says, 'I love to make a groan man piss on himself.\"\n\nWhat the crap is a \"groan man?\"\n\nWhat happened at the prison, it is now clear, was not the result of random acts by \"a few bad apples,\" it was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy that has dismantled those wise constraints and has made war on America's checks and balances.\n\nSince your previous statements about individual temptations actually refute the last one, shouldn't they cancel each other out and create a wormhole or something?\n\nThe abuse of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib flowed directly from the abuse of the truth that characterized the Administration's march to war and the abuse of the trust that had been placed in President Bush by the American people in the aftermath of September 11th.\n\n\"Bush equivocated, prisoners masturbated!\"\n\nThere was then, there is now and there would have been regardless of what Bush did, a threat of terrorism that we would have to deal with.\n\nOh no! We're doooooooooomed!!!!!!\n\nBut instead of making it better, he has made it infinitely worse.\n\nWorse for terrorists, not us.\n\nWe are less safe because of his policies.\n\nOh, is that why terrorism is at a 30 year low?\n\nHe has created more anger and righteous indignation against us as Americans than any leader of our country in the 228 years of our existence as a nation -- because of his attitude of contempt for any person, institution or nation who disagrees with him.\n\nPot, meet kettle, etc. etc.\n\nHe has exposed Americans abroad and Americans in every U.S. town and city to a greater danger of attack by terrorists because of his arrogance, willfulness, and bungling at stirring up hornet's nests that pose no threat whatsoever to us.\n\nAnother contradiction! First, he says that there will always be a threat of terror, then he says that there's only a threat because Bush went to war. PICK ONE!\n\nAnd by then insulting the religion and culture and tradition of people in other countries.\n\n\"Islam is a religion of peace...we worship the same God...this is a war against a political ideology, not a religion...\" Yeah, nice try, but I actually listen to the president when he opens his mouth.\n\nAnd by pursuing policies that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children, all of it done in our name.\n\n\"Bush murders brown people!\"\n\nPresident Bush said in his speech Monday night that the war in Iraq is \"the central front in the war on terror.\" It's not the central front in the war on terror, but it has unfortunately become the central recruiting office for terrorists.\n\nDid it ever occur to you that the terrorists were already recruited, and now they're just lining up to be killed for Allah?\n\n[Dick Cheney said, \"This war may last the rest of our lives.]\n\nYou just said that a few paragraphs ago, so I don't know why you brought it up.\n\nThe unpleasant truth is that President Bush's utter incompetence has made the world a far more dangerous place and dramatically increased the threat of terrorism against the United States.\n\nI guess you take that \"lies, damned lies, and statistics\" quote to heart.\n\nJust yesterday, the International Institute of Strategic Studies reported that the Iraq conflict \" has arguable focused the energies and resources of Al Qaeda and its followers while diluting those of the global counterterrorism coalition.\"\n\nAnd when Al Qaeda sees how hopeless it is to f**k with the United States, they'll back down like the little b**ches they are.\n\nThe ISS said that in the wake of the war in Iraq Al Qaeda now has more than 18,000 potential terrorists scattered around the world and the war in Iraq is swelling its ranks.\n\nI seem to remember seeing somewhere that that number was just randomly chosen.\n\nThe war plan was incompetent in its rejection of the advice from military professionals and the analysis of the intelligence was incompetent in its conclusion that our soldiers would be welcomed with garlands of flowers and cheering crowds.\n\nNever mind the fact that that actually happened.\n\nThus we would not need to respect the so-called Powell doctrine of overwhelming force.\n\nMy brain hurts. Now you're in favor of overwhelming force? STOP GETTING YOUR LOGIC WIRES CROSSED!\n\nThere was also in Rumsfeld's planning a failure to provide security for nuclear materials, and to prevent widespread lawlessness and looting.\n\nAnd now he's also in favor of attacking civilians. Brilliant.\n\nLuckily, there was a high level of competence on the part of our soldiers even though they were denied the tools and the numbers they needed for their mission. What a disgrace that their families have to hold bake sales to buy discarded Kevlar vests to stuff into the floorboards of the Humvees! Bake sales for body armor.\n\nWasn't it your buddy Bubba who destroyed the military's capability, specifically because he \"loathes\" them?\n\nAnd the worst still lies ahead. General Joseph Hoar, the former head of the Marine Corps, said \"I believe we are absolutely on the brink of failure. We are looking into the abyss.\"\n\nAnd so am I, because that's just a small part of the speech. I'll continue this a little later.\n\nPosted by CD at 05:45 PM | Comments (2)\n\nOne Three More Pictures\n\nThis is exciting! After a bit of investigation, I managed to find out what flavor of Kool-Aid the news media drinks. Click the extended entry to see.\n\nUPDATE\n\nI forgot a couple others that they drink occasionally:\n\nYou really don't want to know how late it was when I made these. Let's just say that I'm starting to hear birds waking up.\n\nUPDATE THE SECOND\n\nDang it, I should've replaced \"Artificial flavor\" with \"Fictitious flavor\" on the Moorange packet. Oh well.\n\nPosted by CD at 02:32 AM | Comments (1)\n\nThe Poodle Barks Again\n\nI was going to fisk Maureen Dowd's latest column, but then I saw this line:\n\nAn outraged president called yesterday for the immediate resignations of Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, George Tenet, Condoleezza Rice, Douglas Feith and Stephen Cambone.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't the president in the White House. It was the shadow president, the one who won the popular vote.\n\nWhat else can you say about someone who honestly believes that? It's just not worth it.\n\nIncidentally, I'm still thinking about taking on the entire Algore speech. I'll get back to that later.\n\nPosted by CD at 12:07 AM | Comments (1)\n\nThinking Out Loud...\n\nI wonder if it would be possible to fisk Gorangutan's entire speech in multiple posts. Hmmm...\n\nPosted by CD at 10:43 PM | Comments (0)\n\nFunniest. Thing. EVER.\n\nRead these. That is all.\n\nPosted by CD at 09:33 PM | Comments (0)\n\nHow Ironic\n\nIt looks like the Democrats are becoming what they hate:\n\nI think we should start calling him \"Algorangutanâ¢.\"\n\nUPDATE\n\nAccording to Google, no one else has used that word, so now it's mine. Along with Donktionaryâ¢ and Bushchimplerâ¢.\n\nPosted by CD at 09:03 PM | Comments (3)\n\nFarktastic!\n\nI participated in a Fark Photoshop contest! Go here and look for CMD7. That would be me.\n\nPosted by CD at 08:07 PM | Comments (0)\n\nUnbelievable\n\nThat's about the only word I can think of to describe the concentrated idiocy coming from the Post-Gazette letters to the editor today. I know I do this a lot, and I really should diversify my content a little (although I'll probably have some new songs posted later), but...wow. These things are simply amazing, and not in a good way. They must've been distributing free samples of Kool-Aid this week. Let's just go right into the first one, and I'll let you see for yourselves:\n\nRadio brainwashing\n\nBe loud, arrogant, irrational and self-righteous.\n\nIt seems you're taking your own advice so far.\n\nState that anyone who opposes unrestrained military action or worse is committing treason.\n\nThat liberal fantasy world must be a scary place indeed.\n\nBe repetitive, and be sure that anything said over and over eventually becomes the truth.\n\nYou're talking about Air America, right?\n\nRules of the Nazi propaganda machine in the 1930s? Unfortunately, no. It is the constant drumbeat of the dozens of \"Rushniks\" on talk radio.\n\nSee what I mean about the Kool-Aid? (I accidentally typed \"Kook-Aid\" a second ago. I guess that works too.) They actually published a letter comparing talk radio to the Nazis. I refuse to believe that this is the best they can do.\n\nThe only light at the end of this dark tunnel is my firm belief that come November, a clear majority of the American people will think, see the light and change the regime.\n\nAnd, in traditional \"crazy person writing a letter\" fashion, this one ends in a complete non-sequitur. I guess we're supposed to assume that this person is part of the \"Bush controls the media\" crowd. Seriously, this letter fisks itself. I don't know what else to say.\n\nSo, are we having fun yet? Let's see another one:\n\nIf liberals hated America, they'd support Bush's agenda\n\nRegarding the May 8 letter \"We're Fed the Liberal Agenda: Demonize America\": Once again, a missive from the right claiming the \"liberal agenda\" is to demonize America.\n\n*cough* MICHAEL MOORE *cough* TED KENNEDY *cough cough* TED RALL *cough* CNN *cough* REUTERS *cough cough cough*\n\nOh, excuse me. Must've had something caught in my throat.\n\nOnce again the call to \"support Bush\" under the deceitful fig leaf of supporting the troops.\n\nI don't think that was even a complete sentence. And was that supposed to say \"olive branch\" instead of \"fig leaf,\" by any chance?\n\nI have a news flash for those on the right: Americans are beginning to realize that the best way to support the troops is not to send them into unnecessary wars of choice...\n\nThe war was necessary, because Iraq supported terrorism, and every war that isn't fought against an invading army is a choice.\n\n...by lying to the American people and to the world.\n\nMEMES AHOY!!!!!!!\n\nIs it not the Bush supporters who at every turn seek to dishonor the dead by denying and censoring the reality of their sacrifice?\n\nNo, it's Bush supporters who seek to respect the dead by not making them tools for someone's political agenda. We like to focus on what they accomplished during life instead of dwelling on their deaths, thank you very much.\n\nAnd only a right-winger would hold American soldiers to the same gutter standard as an Iraqi mob in Fallujah.\n\n...You lost me there. When did anyone do that? Incidentally, does anyone else think that if a right-winger said that, it would be perceived as racist? I'm getting that vibe.\n\nBelieve me, if this liberal really hated America he would be an ardent supporter of this unelected...\n\nTHE CONSTITUTION IS FICTITIOUS!\n\n...illegitimate regime...\n\nBUSH IS HITLER! BUSH IS HITLER!\n\n...of corporate cronies...\n\nTAX CUTS FOR THE RICH! TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH!\n\n...ideological warmongers...\n\nREPUBLICANS WANT TO KILL BROWN PEOPLE FOR OIL!\n\n...and hacks so incompetent that they allowed us to be attacked worse than ever before in our history...\n\n...And yet, you oppose preemptive warfare. Hooray for consistency.\n\n...and then allowed the perpetrator to go scot-free for more than 21/2 years (and counting).\n\nI don't know where you've been getting your news, but we decimated the Taliban about 2 years ago, and we're fighting Al Qaeda in Iraq at this very moment. Nice try, though.\n\nOh, and did I mention bankrupting the country?\n\nYeah, let's blame the side that believes in traditional values and tax cuts for bankrupting the country. That'll work.\n\nThe absurdity of right-wing rhetoric becomes more blatantly hallucinatory by the hour!\n\nPot, meet Kettle. He thinks you're black.\n\nAll right, just one more. I know you've all got important things you could be doing:\n\nAnyone but Bush\n\nWhat an original title.\n\nTalk about shooting the messenger.\n\nThat sounds Maureen Dowdish.\n\nI find it just incredible that you received a letter to the editor that could blame the media for turning \"a very unfortunate situation in Iraq into a national and international travesty\" (\"Many, Many Iraqis Are Grateful to Be Free of Saddam,\" May 18).\n\nI think this would be a good time to mention that the front page of today's PG features a picture of people visiting Abu Ghraib. Along with no actual articles related to the picture in any way. How convenient.\n\nThis mind-numbingly, simplistic approach...\n\nThat comma was unnecessary. I know that doesn't prove anything, but I thought I'd point it out.\n\n...to explaining the mess in Iraq is being parroted by conservatives to protect the real source of blame for this \"travesty\": Bush, Rove, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Cheney.\n\nAre there actual humans writing these pathetic excuses for opinions? It seems like they're all about the same. I'm starting to think that the VLWC distributes fill-in-the-blanks forms to its minions at the beginning of each week. Hmmm...I may have to make one of those.\n\nWe have been thrust into a pre-emptive strike against a weaker nation under false pretenses...\n\nI can't believe how ironic it is that people keep using the phrase \"false pretenses\" to make arguments that are based on...wait for it...wait. for. it...FALSE PRETENSES!!!!\n\n...by this administration. I personally think that this guy should be impeached for causing such needless death and destruction to both American soldiers and Iraqi civilians.\n\nToo bad your opinion isn't a valid reason to impeach the frickin' president. As soon as he actually does something illegal, like the last president who was impeached, we'll get back to you.\n\nI guess the writer would prefer to push her head into the sand and not know that the war effort is not going as Paul Wolfowitz envisioned.\n\nWell, boo-frickity-hoo! Nothing ever goes the way it's envisioned. If it did, Communism would be an effective system of government.\n\nIn a democracy we hope to get the good news as well as the bad news from our media...\n\nThey've done half their job pretty well.\n\n...and then decide for ourselves whether the war is justified.\n\nYeah, because the media doesn't influence public opinion at all, does it? I'm sure the South Vietnamese will be happy to hear that.\n\nWell, I am appalled by what I see happening in this ill-conceived attempt at nation-building...\n\nGood for you.\n\n...and anything good that we have accomplished in Iraq has been negated by our lack of planning and unwillingness to admit our errors.\n\nSo \"demolishing Abu Ghraib\" and \"raiding Chalabi's house\" don't count as admitting errors? Wow, you've got high standards.\n\nConsequently, I will happily vote for anyone but Bush in November.\n\nWhat about a monkey? Would you vote for a monkey? How about a pineapple? I hear the Pineapple Party is gaining support in obscure regions of Hawaii.\n\n...You know what? I'm done dealing with this crap now.\n\nPosted by CD at 05:28 PM | Comments (3)\n\nThat's More Like It\n\nThis is the speech President Bush should've given. It's awesome:\n\nLet me make this clear: when people want to kill you, will blow up men, women, and children and celebrate the deaths by jumping around and yelling like a bunch of deranged howler monkeys, you waste those motherf**kers.\n\nWe need to get rid of the \"35 or older\" rule so Frank J. can run for president in 2008.\n\nPosted by CD at 03:43 PM | Comments (4)\n\nSpeech Blogging\n\nAll right, it's time for some \"live\" blogging. Live as in \"typing as I watch a speech and then posting it immediately.\" I'm not going to try and update throughout like some people do. This will be pretty much stream-of-consciousness, as I did with the SOTU and the Democratic debate, so I'll put it in the extended entry for the sake of everyone's sanity. Also, my computer desk is in the corner of my room, so I have to look to the right to see the TV, then back to the left to see the computer. Therefore, random typos may be present even after proofreading.\n\nAnyway...let's get started.\n\nAll right, Chris Matthews just said that the speech is coming up in a moment (I'm watching it on MSNBC), so I guess the action is about ready to begin. Hey, I almost forgot that it's in Pennsylvania. That's where I am...oh, they just announced him. They're clapping. Good. And there he is...smirking...DU is going to hate that. Now they're standing. He's smirking again. That actually bothers me. Don't ask why.\n\nOh, crap, he's slurring already. The actions of our enemies have been brutal, calculating, and instructive...Izadeen Saleem? Is that how you spell that? Way to enunciate, Dubya.\n\nNow he mentioned Berg's murder. It was a vile display, showing a contempt for the rules of warfare. It reveals fanaticism that would not be appeased by any concession. Nice. He named Zarqawi. He's connecting Iraq to the WoT. THANK YOU! \"It was a distraction, it was a distraction!!!!\"\n\nUh-oh. My headphones are malfunctioning. That isn't good. I missed part of it.\n\nNow he's pointing out that the \"insurgents\" are members of Saddam's forces. And they're terrorists. And foreign fighters and extremists have joined them to seize regional power for themselves. They share a goal: They hope to wear out the patience of Americans, our coalition, and Iraqis before the arrival of an effective self-government, and...freedom. Man, I need to type faster.\n\nThe way forward may sometimes appear chaotic. Why didn't he mention the media? Now they're clapping.\n\nOkay, so far, so good. He made it clear that we're fighting terror, not Iraqi militia. And he hasn't mispronounced anything yet.\n\nPeople prefer freedom. Danged right, they do. Terrorists are against progress, they only want death and violence. We want freedom, independence, security, and prosperity for the Iraqi people. He says we'll be safer after the war. I think the low rate of terrorism proves that. Heh.\n\nIraq is our friend. Ooh, five steps! Let's see what they are:\n\n-Hand over...aw, crap, I lost track. Stupid keyboard.\n\nStep one: Transfer full sovereignity to an Iraqi government, clear the way for national elections. I guess he's still keeping the June 30 date. I'm guessing the terrorists won't like that. He'd better be ready for a fight. Iraq will have a new prime minister, but the composition of the government hasn't been decided yet. Interim officials being announced this week. Sweet.\n\nDifferent departments and ministries...he said \"diversity.\" I'm not sure what to think.\n\nIraq already controls 12 ministries? I didn't know that. I thought the eeeeevil imperialist Americans were jackbooting all freedom away.\n\nAre they ready for self-government? Do they want it? YES!!!! Representative government, yay! They've elected town councils and city governments, and a civil society is emerging. We need the transfer to happen. They don't like foreign control. Well, so much for the \"taking over the country\" meme. He's clearly making the case that we don't particularly like being there either, and we're going to leave the country to them as soon as we can. Nice.\n\nStep two: Establish security and stability. Fight terrorists, illegal militia, and Saddam loyalists. We need to maintain a troop level of 138,000. Extended duty is necessary for 20,000 people who were scheduled to leave in April. He will send more troops if needed.\n\nHe thanks the soldiers for their sacrifices, courage, duty, etc. That got a lot of applause. He looks nervous. I wonder why (/sarcasm).\n\nFa-loo-ja. I was wondering how to pronounce that. I've only read it on the Internet. I thought it was Fa-loo-ha. Friggin' Spanish classes influencing my pronunciations of foreign words.\n\nHe's giving the Iraqi people credit for their own abilities. Fallujah, Najaf, Karbala, Kufah? Where's that?\n\nHe's talking about Sadr. Using holy shrines as shields. Not to mention civilians, I might add. A mosque was cleared of weapons. Maybe they were just holy weapons. It seems like every grain of sand in the Middle East is a frickin' holy site. \"This is the holy rock of Baghdad!!!! Mohammed stepped on it once!\"\n\n...Sorry, got sidetracked there. Back to the speech.\n\nWe're training Iraqi fighters better. They have an Iraqi chain of command, with the best possible leadership. Good. 260,000 Iraqis are being trained. That's a lot. 13 batallions will be there by \"Joo-ly\" the first. O...kay.\n\nStep three: Continue rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. Economic independence and a better quality of life are needed. Hospitals and schools, health clinics, bridges, electricity, modern communications, private economy, new currency, open foreign investment...liberalized trade policy, participation in the World Trade Organization...\n\nHe's talking about oil revenues. Oh, look, it's helping the Iraqis, not Halliburton. OOOOOOOOIL!!!!!\n\nHe's breaking up. I think his attention span just gave out. Get outta there, Dubya, before it's too late! I think he has ADD. I should know.\n\n...I Got sidetracked again. See what I mean?!\n\nNew prison system...he screwed up the word \"Abu Ghraib.\" That was embarrassing. Allow me to phonetically reproduce the sound he made:\n\n\"Ab-u...Gh..a...rabe...\"\n\nDang it, don't you practice? The left will be all over that. \"Look, he's so guilty, he can't even say the name of the torture chamber!\" Crap crap crap crap crap. It's Ah-boo-grabe. Dang it.\n\nU.N. participation? Yeah, that'll help. Most nations have expressed support for a free Iraq, apparently. He will thank our 15 NATO allies next month, who have 17,000 troops on the ground as part of the unilateral invasion.\n\nStep four: Free national elections by next January. We're forming an election commission for an orderly, accurate national election to choose a transitional national assembly. They'll draft a new constitution which will be presented in fall of 2005. They'll have a permanent government by the end of next year.\n\nIraqis are united in a broad and deep conviction: They're determined never again to live at the mercy of a dictator. Representative government will protect basic rights and defend them from the return of tyranny, and that election is coming. In 18 months. Okay.\n\nStep five: He didn't say what step five is. Maybe it's \"Profit.\"\n\nTerrorists will not determine the future of Iraq. Hopefully, it'll be because they're dead and in hell. Say that, Dubya!\n\nIraqis will raise a government to reflect their own culture and values. We went to Iraq to make its people free, not to make them American. They will write their own history and find their own way. As they do, Iraqis can be certain that they will always have a friend in the United States of America. Man, transcription is hard.\n\nHe mentioned 9/11 and Afghanistan. Orange Alert, ricin, dirty bombs, Madrid, Istanbul, Tunis, Bali...I think they just want to show off his ability to say these words.\n\nWe must keep our focus. We must do our duty. History will tend toward hope, or tend toward tragedy. The enemy wants to impose \"Taliban-like rule.\" It's called \"radical Islam,\" Dubya. Say it. Say it so people realize who the enemy really is.\n\nThey seek weapons of mass destruction to impose their will through blackmail and catastrophic attacks. \"None of this is an expression of a religion.\" Yeah, sure it is. It's not all political, but I think he just has to say that so people don't call him a bigot.\n\nFa-na-ta-ci-sm. Sound it out. Sound. It. Out.\n\nAmerica will be safer when hope has returned to the Middle East. Afghanistan is coming to life, and two ideologies are contending for the future of Iraq...or something.\n\nWe will not fail. We will perservere and defeat this enemy. And...that's all, folks. Hmm...Matthews has Joe Biden on his show. Okay.\n\n\"I'm quite frankly disappointed...\" Oh, shut up. TV off.\n\nSo, that's the plan. Sounds about right. It outlined our plans pretty well, I'd say. He could've mentioned the sarin and mustard gas. Or the averted attack in Jordan. But he's probably waiting on those. He has a tendency to do that so the media looks dumb. He also said nothing about Kerry, or domestic policies, or anything of the sort, so that gives him points for focus. It's too bad the Democrats don't seem to have the ability to focus on one thing without attacking their opponent.\n\nThat's about it. You may now return to your meaningful activities.\n\nPosted by CD at 08:45 PM | Comments (7)\n\nVRWC Minions Attack!\n\nIf anyone's interested, there's some dissent that needs to be crushed in this post from a couple days ago. I already responded, but I figured I'd point it out in case the rest of you are interested.\n\nBy the way, I'll be blogging President Bush's speech tonight. It's cutting into my regularly scheduled \"beat the crap out of my drums\" time, so it had better be good. You listening, Dubya?\n\nOh, wait, you're not. Dang.\n\nPosted by CD at 07:07 PM | Comments (1)\n\nMore Letters\n\nAh, Sunday. The day that the Post-Gazette bombards its readership with dozens of letters and editorials. Once again, the letters to the editor are more entertaining than the rest, so let's take a look. First, we have a very short one that teaches a valuable lesson about how to completely miss the point:\n\nMay freedom prevail\n\nPresident Bush's call for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages is another example of his Big Brother arrogance.\n\nANOTHER example? I must have missed all the other ones.\n\nThe government ought not to see inside the bedroom, nor should its morality have an effect on the behavior of consenting adults.\n\nSo, you're saying that the government should get out of marriage altogether, right? Because that's what it means for them to stay out of the bedroom. You did know that, didn't you?\n\nI do not condone same-sex marriages. I support the freedom to be involved in one. \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\"\n\nOh. I guess you didn't know that. See, this bothers me. If people really wanted the government out of their bedrooms, they wouldn't be worrying about what kind of marriage is legal. By having the state endorse your relationship, you're bringing them into your bedroom. I wish more people realized this.\n\nAnyway, let's move on to a war letter. Those are always fun:\n\nThis is Bush's buck\n\nIn a May 20 editorial, the Post-Gazette called for the removal of Donald Rumsfeld from his position as secretary of defense (\"Trail of Abuse: Follow the Evidence Up the Chain of Command\").\n\nNo liberal media here...\n\nI agree with that position; however, the blame for the treatment of the Iraqi prisoners should go one step further.\n\nIf it was possible for it to go even further than Bush, you'd probably blame that person too.\n\nRemember Truman's sign that \"The Buck Stops Here.\"\n\nIt's hard to forget when you friggin' moonbats keep regurgitating it every five minutes, yes.\n\nWell, Mr. Bush should get the sign and start abiding by it.\n\nHave you not been paying attention? I believe Bush already addressed the issue. But maybe that's just what Fox News and Rush Limbaugh told me to think.\n\nIf this debacle had happened during any Democratic administration, we would be in the midst of an impeachment process today.\n\nBy that logic, the soldiers who abused Iraqi prisoners are morally equivalent to Bill Clinton's sperm cells.\n\nBut when the Republicans start a war unnecessarily...\n\nYay! An opinion treated as fact! I love the predictability of these things.\n\n...and then abuse prisoners...\n\nThe Republicans abused prisoners? That's news to me.\n\n...it is for the \"safety of our nation against terrorists.\"\n\nReally? I thought those prisoners in Abu Ghraib were arrested for trampling someone's daisies.\n\nNever mind that the whole reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction...\n\nAHEM...and murder, and U.N. violations, and cease-fire violations, etc.\n\n...which have never been found.\n\nYeah, except for Jordan, Syria, and NEXT TO THE F**KING ROAD IN IRAQ, we haven't found any.\n\nYoung men are being killed every day, and why?\n\nBecause war kills people?\n\nBecause of a vendetta that Bush Jr. has against the Iraqi people...\n\nGreat. Now Bush went to war because he wanted to kill civilians. That's a meme of a different color.\n\n...and he and his cohorts' lust for the oil.\n\nCouldn't leave that out, could ya?\n\nNow they are court-martialing young soldiers and reservists for their (the higher-ups') dirty deeds.\n\nThat was doubleplusgoodthinkful how you managed to mention two groups and only blame the one that didn't actually abuse anybody.\n\nIsn't it time that we stop this nonsense and let our young people live their lives normally and peacefully?\n\nThey're in the military. It's their job to risk their lives for our safety. I'm sorry that you weren't aware of that.\n\n...All right, let's see a couple more. These are about Bush, Kerry, and religion, so you know they'll be good:\n\nBush's troubling ties\n\nI thought that questions about a Catholic holding public office (\"How Good a Catholic Is Kerry?\" May 9) had died with the election of John F. Kennedy. Apparently not, but they never seem to surface in non-presidential elections.\n\nIf Kerry wouldn't bring up his Catholicism, it probably wouldn't be an issue. Kinda like Vietnam. Kerry was there, you know. In Vietnam. He was there.\n\nAnn Rodgers' article made me wonder whether people are more worried about a candidate (John Kerry) being influenced by the Catholic hierarchy than they are about a candidate (George W. Bush) being dominated by the conservative religious right.\n\nI sometimes forget that the VRWC includes this so-called \"religious right\" that usually consists of Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and nobody else in particular.\n\nCurrent presidential policies related to abortion, stem cell research, prayer in public schools, faith-based initiatives and school vouchers are direct reflections of the positions advocated by this group.\n\nWell, whoopty-f**kin'-doo! You're telling me that Bush actually believes in the teachings of his religion? How horrible! He's so much worse than Kerry and his brilliant \"nuance,\" which gives him the magical ability to be a Catholic without actually holding Catholic beliefs.\n\nWhy is that less troublesome to so many people?\n\nMaybe because a lot of people agree with him on those issues? Or because they like having a president who stands up for his beliefs? I could go on.\n\nAs a Protestant clergy person...\n\nAs if I needed another reason not to go to church anymore...\n\n...I am bothered by the president's messianic-style language with the implication that this country has some special calling from God to be an \"example\" to the rest of the world.\n\nWell, considering the fact that we're the most successful nation in the history of civilization, I think that's a perfectly acceptable view.\n\nOn the contrary, it appears to me that if God is calling us to do anything as a nation it is to reform our own behavior...\n\nWho ever said that America was perfect? Bush didn't say that.\n\nfor example, in the areas of poverty (the great disparity between the rich and poor in this country)...\n\nTax cuts...\n\n...homelessness...\n\nJob creation...\n\n...hunger...\n\nTax cuts and job creation...\n\nviolence (domestic and otherwise)...\n\nSecond Amendment rights...\n\nthe stewardship of God's resources and the (mis)treatment of children.\n\nYou know, there are other entities besides government that can take care of these things.\n\nWe are far from exemplary in our behavior in regard to these issues.\n\nWho isn't, dang it? That's not the point.\n\nTo suggest that America is a manifestation of God's intentions for human life is very shortsighted, if not delusional.\n\nI don't think Bush said that either. I think you're just afraid because he actually has a set of beliefs. How horrible.\n\nJust one more. This one's about Bush and his adherence to the demands of his church. I probably should point out that I was raised and confirmed as a Methodist, so I have some credibility on the issues here:\n\nWhat about Bush?\n\nI found Ann Rodgers' May 9 article about John Kerry disturbing, starting with the question the Post-Gazette chose for a headline: \"How Good a Catholic Is Kerry?\" I have a few questions for the Post-Gazette.\n\n1. Is it our civic duty to judge the religious and spiritual lives of political leaders (or anyone else) and their fidelity to their church? I believe that judgment belongs to God.\n\nWhen they try to make their religion part of their image, yes. Especially when it's clear that they don't actually follow Catholic teachings.\n\n2. But having started on this course, will the Post-Gazette, in fairness, publish an equally prominent and in-depth article titled, \"How Good a Methodist Is Bush?\"\n\nHas Bush made an issue of his Methodism? No. He just says that he's a Christian, which makes sense. I didn't even know he was a Methodist until I saw this.\n\n3. If so, will the article report that Mr. Bush has unilaterally...\n\nHow can one person do anything multilaterally?\n\n...rejected the pleas of the Methodist Church (and many other churches) not to wage war in Iraq, not to seek revenge in Afghanistan and not to drill for oil in Alaska?\n\nWell, you see, unlike Catholicism, Methodism is a religion, not a lifestyle. There's no Pope to answer to, and there's not an entire political structure based around it. Therefore, Methodist leaders don't represent what Methodists have to believe. There's this thing called the Bible to answer those questions.\n\n4. If his stance on abortion is the measure of Mr. Kerry's fidelity to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, is Mr. Bush's persistent pursuit of war the measure of his fidelity to the teachings of the Methodist Church?\n\nI think I covered this already. The Methodist Church isn't structured in a way that people can be denied communion or excommunicated or something because they believe differently. To Methodists, church is a place for guidance, not rigid marching orders.\n\n5. If it is an act of faithfulness to protect the unborn, what kind of act is it to kill the born, such as the estimated 8,000 Iraqi civilians who died in the bombing...\n\nIt's called an accident, moron, and it's not the same as deliberately dismembering a living human being in the womb.\n\n...and what kind of act is it to hide from public view the flag-draped coffins of the hundreds of U.S. soldiers who died fighting Mr. Bush's war?\n\nWell, the act of bringing that up here is a complete non-sequitur, because it has nothing to do with religion. In fact, I doubt that Jesus would say, \"Show them the coffins until they hate war.\" I could be wrong, but I'm just getting that feeling.\n\nPosted by CD at 06:30 PM | Comments (1)\n\nYeah, Nobody Saw That Coming\n\n'Fahrenheit 9/11' wins top honor at Cannes\n\nAmerican filmmaker Michael Mooreâs âFahrenheit 9/11,â a scathing indictment of White House actions after the Sept. 11 attacks, won the top prize Saturday at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nâFahrenheit 9/11â was the first documentary to win Cannesâ prestigious Palme dâOr since Jacques Cousteauâs âThe Silent Worldâ in 1956.\n\nIn other news, the sky is blue, grass is green, and water is wet.\n\nPosted by CD at 08:17 PM | Comments (7)\n\nGood News\n\nApparently, drumming reduces stress.\n\nAs a drummer, I can personally say that this is true. Beating the crap out of synthetic materials with large wooden sticks does tend to calm a person down after a while. Plus, it's a lot of fun.\n\nHeh.\n\nPosted by CD at 08:09 PM | Comments (0)\n\nMore Fun With Letters to the Editor\n\nToday's Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, as usual, gives us a few letters to the editor from a few very dumb writers. I won't go through all of them, but I want to focus on the ones that are particularly in need of some fisktastic attention. Check 'em out:\n\nThe best support would be to vote Bush out of office\n\nI'm responding to Kit Kellinger's letter (\"A Minuscule Number,\" May 18) and other \"well, they did it first\" letters. Whatever heinous acts Saddam Hussein or other Iraqis have committed are irrelevant to the prisoner abuse argument.\n\nTell that to Ted \"Swimmer\" Kennedy. He seems obsessed with the idea that we're as bad as Saddam.\n\nSaddam didn't claim to be a great moral leader generously bestowing democracy on the unfortunate Iraqis. But President Bush did;\n\nHmmm...and President Bush actually FOLLOWED THROUGH, didn't he?\n\n...therefore, we have a duty to be above reproach in all our actions in Iraq.\n\nSo...you're basically saying that the war is a failure if anything goes wrong? I stand in awe of your truly realistic world view.\n\nYes, Jessica Lynch was mistreated in Iraq. But why can't people recognize she never should have been there?\n\nMaybe because not everybody agrees with that opinion, nimrod.\n\nOur invasion of Iraq was a diversion from the hunt for the terrorist network responsible for 9/11.\n\nOkay, first of all, that makes absolutely no sense. Why would Bush fight a whole new war for the specific purpose of slowing the progress of the original one? And even if he did, how do you suddenly know exactly what he was thinking? I seem to remember him saying something about weapons of mass destruction, and terrorist support, and human rights violations, and U.N. violations, and cease-fire violations...I could go on, but I think I've made my point.\n\n(No matter how many times this administration says Iraq was involved in 9/11, it knows that's not true. It just hopes you don't.)\n\nThat's funny, because this administration has repeatedly stated that Iraq was not directly involved in 9/11, and we have no good evidence that suggests otherwise. It is possible to hear what people are"
