Cleo Graves Assistant to the Board of Trustees ♦Alumni Trustees '[Deceased A Message From The President Most university presidents, as they conclude their first year in office, yearn to report that solid progress has been made, on a team basis, toward the resolution of their uni- versities' existing needs — and that equally solid progress is being made, also on a team basis, toward setting up the planning and policy procedures needed to deal with future challenges. What most university presidents yearn to report is what I, as president of The George Washington University, can confidently and proudly report to all of the school's con- stituencies: trustees, faculty members, students and their families, staff, administrators, alumni, neighbors, and friends. It makes me even happier to be able to say that these forward steps have been achieved through an exemplary process of University-wide cooperation. The process we have experienced in this year of true col- legiality has been characterized by concern for the entire University, willingness to share information and ideas, and a sense of optimism with regard to our common endeavor. Here are some of the highlights of a year of solid accom- plishment, as seen from my office: □ First and most important, the very process I am engaged in describing has marked the University's transition from a period of relative decentralization to a time when our separate schools and colleges, with- out losing sight of their individual interests, are growing used to functioning with the overall well-being of the University in mind. □ This burgeoning sense of a common good with which more individual concerns need to be coordinated has been epitomized by the creation and successful functioning of the Budget Advisory Team, chaired by Vice President Robert Chernak, a forum for candid debate by represen- tatives of the major GW constituencies — faculty, students, staff, and administrators — as to how the University's re- sources should be allocated in order to reach our shared institutional goals. Stephen Joel Trachtenberg Tom Wolff The George Washington University National Law Center programs have produced outstanding graduates — including such illustrious figures as Sen. Daniel lnouye, Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski, and three-time cabinet member Patricia Roberts Harris, former secretary of HUD, HEW, and HHS. The Law Center’s Washington location provides unparalleled oppor- tunity for first-hand observation of how the federal govern- ment operates. Pictured are Associate Professor of Law Lynn Stout, with third-year law students Todd Baldwin and Kahbo Chiew, concluding a visit to the U.S. Supreme Court. Funding for Vital Programs. An Emphasis on Planning. □ Another major component of this growing sense of institutional coherence and identity has been the strong performance, in the past year, of the Council of Deans, including the new arrangement under which the Council meets regularly with me and the University's vice presi- dents. The Council has clearly demonstrated its capacity for policy formulation and collective decision-making and can be expected, in the years ahead, to maintain and extend its central role within the academic life of GW. □ In order to further our new emphasis on University- wide planning perspectives. Dr. Roderick French, the Vice President for Academic Affairs, has been given direct oversight of the budgets of GW's schools and colleges. This change has greatly increased our capacity to see to it that no academic program deemed essential for the University is denied the funding it needs. □ All University activities and programs involving our undergraduate and graduate students, from admissions through alumni affairs, have undergone and will continue to undergo careful review. At the level of admissions, so critical to the academic and fiscal health of the University, we have greatly improved our application procedures and publications while actively preparing for the longer-term challenge: the arrival, after several years of unexpected reprieve, of a serious nationwide downturn in the number of men and women applying for college admission. Our alumni programs are also being strengthened, in recogni- tion of the lifelong relationship that benefits both alumni and the University. The initiation, by Ron Howard, of alumni admissions committees across the country is one example of our efforts to increase alumni involvement in building our student body. □ The goal we are now working toward, in the face of this demographic challenge, is to increase the number of qualified applicants to GW so as to make certain that our present \"banner enrollment\" in the 1989-90 academic year comes to be perceived as a prediction of even better 3 The George Washington University New Ideals of Cooperation. A Fresh Sense of Identity. things to come. Establishing a Visitors' Center on campus, strengthening our Volunteer Assistance Program, and expanding travel to new areas and contacts with high school guidance counselors are only a few of the activities we are undertaking. We intend to see to it that the quality of our student body, as we move through the 1990s, under- goes steady improvement and makes GW an even more attractive school for teachers and researchers of outstanding talent. □ Student life activities also benefited from additional coordination in the past year. We created the Office of Campus Life by combining several functions and, in the process, made an expanded commitment to our educa- tional mission by offering programs and services provid- ing for the personal, professional, social, and cultural development of the entire University community. □ Our Educational Opportunity Program celebrated its twentieth year of providing support for a GW education to students in our metropolitan area, and we created the Twenty-First Century Scholars program to finance a GW education for outstanding District of Columbia public school graduates. Recognizing that tuition increases create needs for additional financial assistance, we significantly in- creased our financial aid budget for all qualified students. □ Overall, we have reaffirmed our commitment to equal- ity of opportunity in all phases of University life through increased recruitment of women and minorities. □ We are continuing to enhance the University's student housing. This includes improvements to the physical plant as well as to the programs and experiences in the residence halls. □ Plans are under way, which will become apparent in the spring term of the 1989-90 academic year, to com- pletely renovate the GW Bookstore. The facility will be upgraded and we believe the quality of service provided to students, faculty and others will be significantly enhanced. □ Our new ideals of coherence and cooperation have also made themselves felt within the financial administration of the University. For the first time in seventeen years, all of those involved in fiscal management — including the Comptroller, those responsible for internal auditing, and those responsible for the financial aspects of our person- nel policies — have been brought together to function as a team. In the words of Charles Diehl, our Vice President and Treasurer, \"We have been able to start a process that will continue in future years. It will enable us to insure the fiscal stability of the University, to provide for the selec- tive growth of University programs and facilities, and to implement management systems that allow us to monitor and evaluate our performance.\" □ In order to make the sense of a common University identity explicit as well as implicit, we have produced a new Graphic Standards Manual governing all GW station- ery and publications and have launched a monthly tabloid — By George ! — with an internal as well as an external function. By George! is devoted to bringing the world a lively yet authoritative overview of The George Washing- ton University. Those who teach and study at GW and those who staff its disparate offices and campuses will find it equally informative, and, we hope, will not be shy about submitting their own thoughts and concerns for publication.

For her contributions in mentoring and facilitating educa- tional opportunity, the District of Columbia govern- ment proclaimed last March 29 \"Valerie Epps Day. ” 5 The George Washington University □ This new sense of identity is facing its first major chal- lenge as we move toward the establishment of a new campus in Northern Virginia (Loudoun County), on a parcel of land given to GW by Trustee Robert Smith in the spring of 1986. Our campus will be part of a research and development park. Planning is well under way for the facilities to be constructed and programs to be offered. Faculty members and administrators are very enthusiastic about this new campus, which we now project will be opening in the fall of 1991 . The list I have presented above represents only a broad- brush approach to a few of the accomplishments of the past year. What follows is a more detailed discussion. Most of us have witnessed — in the daily newspaper, among other places — a furious nation- wide debate on the relationship between two critical activities, teaching and research. It would be diffi- cult to find a major university or four-year college where this relationship is not under current and often acrimoni- ous discussion. □ Where teaching and research at GW are concerned, the past year has seen the emergence within the University of an articulated desire for balance. The University enjoys an enviable reputation for the dedication and accessibility of its teachers. It also has developed an impressive number of research programs considered to be of nationally recog- nized caliber. What has gradually emerged from our con- versations is the conviction that these two emphases can be joined together in ways that strengthen both and detract from neither. Those who must do the truly difficult work in achieving such a balanced system are, of course, the University's faculty members, and I would like to begin by listing some of the efforts we are making to see to it that GW's depen- dence on them is matched by its concern for their profes- sional environment: Teaching and Research: A Working Balance. A prime attraction to students of politics is the oppor- tunity to study with professors who bring to the classroom broad experience in national affairs. A case in point is Henry R. Nau, professor of political science and interna- tional affairs. Dr. Nau has interwoven his teaching career with two high-level government posts — including service for President Reagan as senior staff member of the National Security Council responsible for international eco- nomic affairs. He also served in the State Department during the Ford Administration. 6 The George Washington University □ We have reached general agreement on the impor- tance of raising the level of faculty compensation at GW if our teaching and research missions are to continue to flourish. Based on our excellent enrollments for the fall 1989 semester, we will be able to award sup- plemental merit-based increases to approximately 150 faculty. These raises are in addition to those given to University faculty at the end of the last academic year. □ In the 1989-90 academic year, we hope to allocate be- tween $500,000 and $1 million beyond the sums already provided to the academic units of the University. The money will be invested by the Vice President for Aca- demic Affairs, guided by a general schedule of priorities prepared by the council of Deans. □ The levels of University funding for the support of indi- vidual faculty research projects continue to increase. In the academic year 1988-89, the University Committee on Research expended over $200,000 to support proposals submitted by 44 faculty. This was in addition to summer research grants provided by individual schools and col- leges, including $40,000 for junior members of the Arts and Sciences faculty and $80,000 for faculty of the National Law Center. □ In order to make certain that University-wide discus- sions of research-related matters are conducted in an effective manner, we have freed the office of GW's Vice President for Research of a number of unrelated adminis- trative duties and have brought it into alignment with the office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. □ We have seen to it that as of the beginning of the pres- ent academic year, faculty members taking full-year sab- batical leaves receive 60 percent rather than 50 percent of their annual salaries from the University, plus benefits. □ Some additional funding for Gelman Library has made it possible to rationalize its acquisitions program — a step that will benefit faculty members and students alike. More Faculty Research Support. Better Computing Capabilities. 8 Resources also will be available to begin addressing professional staff requirements. An unfinished agenda remains to be dealt with in 1989-90. □ Improvements in academic computing will soon be put into effect by a revamped Advisory Council on Academic Computing and Information Systems consisting of faculty members (named by their deans), at-large members (named by the Vice President for Academic Affairs), and several ex officio administrators. In September, we will have our third computer classroom installed, the first equipped with Macintosh computers. We hope to have a fourth computer classroom installed in the spring, representing a growth of 100 percent in one year. □ In 1988-89, Dr. Carl Lange and Dr. Anthony Coates, at the request of the Vice President for Academic Affairs, prepared a major report entitled, \"Strategies for Re- search: Toward Growth and Competitiveness,\" which argued that there exists at the University an exceptional opportunity to create major research programs in selected disciplines and/or interdisciplinary fields. As subsequently modified by the Council of Deans, the report identifies specific fields within which the University has already achieved nationwide prominence. These fields will re- ceive institutional support intended to move them into the first tier of university research programs. The programs and institutes that will be affected at this time are the Bio- statistics Center, the Genetics Program, the Institute for Materials Research, the Center for Nuclear Studies, the Institute for Reliability and Risk Analysis, the Institute for A faculty engaged in exciting research attracts talented graduate students to the University. One of these is Parviz Hassanzadeh, a doctoral candidate working in the area of combustion chemistry with Associate Professor J. Houston Miller. In the photo at left, Mr. Hassanzadeh is using a matrix isolation system to trap unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals. 9 The George Washington University Interactive Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interfaces, the Space Policy Institute, and the Institute for Sino-Soviet Studies. Implementation of this University research policy will be the responsibility of the Vice President for Academic Affairs in consultation with GW's newly-established Advisory Committee for Research. □ For the third year in a row, there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of external funding secured by our faculty for sponsored research. In the past fiscal year, some $38 million in our expenditure budget, $5 million more than last year, was derived from these sources. □ A comprehensive review of campus space needs is high on our agenda. Housing, faculty offices, labs, and similiar issues are being considered with the future in mind. □ The steps we are taking to see to it that excellent teaching accompanies excellent research are less easy to describe. The risk for GW of already having a nationwide reputation for the instructional work of its faculty mem- bers is, of course, complacency. In today's university climate, where definitions of \"good teaching\" and \"re- sponsible curriculum\" are subjects of intense debate, the very opposite of complacency is mandated: a continuous awareness by all of those affiliated with the University of the extent to which all instruction of undergraduate and graduate students, whether conducted in the classroom, the laboratory, or a tutorial setting, is important to the University and will powerfully affect its long-term growth and development. □ It is most unusual to find a major university not cen- tered on a first-rate undergraduate arts and sciences col- lege. Thus, one of the major goals we have developed in the past year is that of achieving an even higher degree of centrality, visibility, quality, and identity for Columbian College. The fact that this goal parallels some of our ef- forts on behalf of GW as a whole is an encouragement to us and suggests, again, that the cause of both liberal and professional undergraduate education interlocks with and supports the other activities required of a major university. 10 II ■ soimvxap) ui azu c j xaSaax^f p/Cofi pmvQ moi2nsdj,(l aqj uom xva/C siqj oqm ajvptpuvo VdWMD * ‘vqxnq dqsaj — xaumm pxvmv xaqjouv qpm ija] iv sqxom dq ‘ soimvxaa ui xoidjnos 2umuim-pxvmv uy A\\D V VdW m pauxva puv ‘/Caqxnj^ ‘puizj ui uxoq svm, ‘mvx2ox<j sonuvxao sfatsxdaiupi aqi jo u UVdq it puv xapunoj ‘uvSopzQ xaqxnjL .t ossajoxj ajvpossy *SJ04DJ|SIUIUipD pUD sjaqutaui Xqn^Dj.

A Prime Resource: Washington, D.C. □ In this present academic year, we will begin a new program of breakfast meetings between students from every part of GW and senior administrators, including myself. \"Taking the student pulse\" in this way will make it possible for us to measure regularly how University poli- cies are impacting on the grass-roots level at which educa- tion must be effective if it is to take place at all. I plan to spend some nights in an undergraduate residence hall. □ The University has prepared an exhaustive analysis of the support being received by all graduate students. This has enabled GW administrators, working closely with the Council of Deans, to begin to improve the University's policies and practices in this area. □ We have reorganized the management of all national fellowship competitions entered by our undergraduate and graduate students. The Dean of Columbian College will have primary responsibility for identifying and assisting undergraduates from all GW schools and colleges who stand a good chance of succeeding in competitions of this kind. The Associate Vice President for Research and Aca- demic Affairs will be responsible for graduate student competitions as well as those entered by faculty members. □ Endowed funds previously undesignated have now been devoted to the creation of six new Presidential Merit Fellowships for graduate students. Each of these will pro- vide a $14,000 stipend and eighteen hours of tuition. These fellowships have been assigned to the fields of study that have been given priority on our research agenda. □ We have set up a new challenge program enabling us to match, with full tuition awards, up to twenty gifts of $10,000 or more given to the University for fellowships. The first such gift, from the Loctite Corporation, will sup- port a minority graduate student. Another, from the Ford Motor Corporation, will help to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the University's Institute for Reliability and Risk Analysis. 12 □ Our 1989-90 operating budget provides for a 15 per- cent increase in graduate student stipends — the eighth straight University budget in which an increase of this size has been included. □ Undergraduates elected to Phi Beta Kappa in their junior year will henceforth receive a $2,000 scholarship in their senior year. We are also working to make our Phi Beta Kappa chapter a significant contributor to the live- liness of campus intellectual life and a motivator for superior academic achievement. □ We are actively searching for a director of the Honors Program developed by the Columbian College faculty. We hope soon to expand the Honors Program to all under- graduate divisions. □ Also at the undergraduate level, and under the super- vision of the dean of Columbian College, we are in the process of revising our popular communications programs and their relationships to one another. □ At the request of the Student Association, we are now well on the way to establishing a completely on-line course registration system for our students. It will make the registration process much more efficient and will benefit both undergraduates and graduate students. □ We are beginning to develop expanded Summer Session programs that will make good use of the Washington setting, our distinctive faculty resources, and our physical plant. □ The U.S. Department of Education has awarded the University a most unusual five years of funding for its new Cooperative Education Program, which will enable undergraduates to gain experience within their chosen career areas and to bring “hands-on\" knowledge into the classroom setting. GW gave Jean Michel Favre a special birthday gift last April — notifica- tion of his selection as a Presidential Merit Fellow. Favre, a native of France who earned his MS' at Utah State Uni- versity, is on leave from a research engineer position to work on a doc- torate in electrical engineering/ computer science with Professor James Foley. Says Favre, \"l looked at schools all over the United States” before settling on GW. 13 The George Washington University □ In the summer of 1989, through an arrangement with our food service provider, the Marriott Corporation, the University invested $500,000 to upgrade the food service area of the Marvin Center's Grand Market Place. This renovation will offer students better display, better food preparation, and more efficient traffic flow. □ A new floor has been installed on the basketball court of the Smith Center. Further enhancement of the Smith Center is contemplated. Intramural programming has been expanded. □ We have moved forward, in the past year, toward developing a network of attractive, well-equipped, well- staffed centers for continuing education. Two such centers are now operative in Virginia — one in Tidewater, the other in Crystal City. Philanthropy: A Key to the Future for University and Medical Center. Though the amounts families and students must spend for tuition are a subject of serious nationwide concern, it is a matter of common knowledge that tuition pays only a por- tion of the true cost of higher education. Major capital improvements and the long-term growth of the University are made possible through significant philanthropy. This makes the effective functioning of the University's Development and Alumni Affairs Office a matter of great importance. Here is a summary of the excellent results achieved in the course of the last year. □ Annual Fund giving was up by 12.4 percent over the previous year, for a total of $6.4 million. Capital gifts, which reflected the \"winding-down phase\" of the Cam- paign for George Washington, totalled $7.5 million and were equal to those received in the previous year. □ When program funding contributed by private corporations and foundations is added to these figures, total \"voluntary support\" received by the University in 1988-89 comes to $16.8 million. In a year in which many universities experienced a decline in such support, ours was up from 1987-88. 14 □ A seven-year summary of gift support to GW shows an increase of 107.4 percent between the fall semester of 1982 and the close of the academic year 1988-89. □ The cumulative total received by the Campaign for George Washington since it was launched in 1985, with the leadership of Trustee Oliver Carr, reached $70.5 mil- lion at the end of 1988-89, representing 94 percent of the $75 million goal. Gifts of $1 million or more were received from CONRAIL, to honor Trustee Stanley Crane, from Hewlett-Packard and from a Hilda Drake bequest. With a year to go to the Campaign's official close in June 1990, Vice President Michael Worth feels that the goal will be met and, in all probability, substantially exceeded. Planning has alredy begun for major fundraising initia- tives to be undertaken in the 1990s, initiatives designed to carry the University into the 21 st Century. □ In 1988-89 we established a Reunion Gift Program for alumni celebrating their fifth, tenth, twenty-fifth, and fif- tieth reunions. More than $75,000 was raised — an amount that is expected to increase as more of our alumni come from residential rather than commuting backgrounds. This effort is part of a broad restructuring of GW's Reunion Pro- gram, one that will encourage our alumni to identify much more closely with the University as they move through life. □ Along related lines, we have now completed the sec- ond year of the Distinguished Alumni Scholars program, aimed at bringing some of our most illustrious alumni back to visit and speak at the university that nurtured them. □ The 1988-89 academic year also saw the beginning of our new Medical Development Office. The University's Medical Center, with Vice President Tom Bowles at the helm, received more than $5 million by the time the year ended. In addition to edu- cating tomorrow’s physicians, the GW Medical Center is known for its commitment to the highest standards of patient care. At left, Kathy Rohrbeck, RN, enjoys a stroll with a patient. 15 The George Washington University □ A search is currently under way for a director to over- see development work at the GW National Law Center, part of a strategy of “coordinated decentralization\" that will be applied, as budgetary considerations permit, to other schools and colleges of the University. □ We are presently seeking an Executive Director of Alumni Programs, a new senior administrative position. In the course of a typical first year in office, a university president inevitably comes in for his or her share of exaggerated expectations, premature doubts, and general “testing.\" These experiences strike me, in retrospect, as pale shadows indeed beside the roster of achievement that makes up the bulk of this report. I am grateful for the commitment to The George Washington University shared by faculty, students, trustees, staff, administrators, alumni, and friends. One special and unpaid member of the Univer- sity community, Francine Trachtenberg, deserves recogni- tion for patient, hard work and sustained good humor. A frequent media image of a university president at the end of “the first year\" is that of a boxer on the ropes. My own image — what I suppose I would have to call my self- image — is somewhat different. It is that of a president whose feelings of satisfaction and productivity have steadily risen as he has learned the happiest lesson of all: that he works at a splendid university engaged in turning itself into a nationwide model of what higher education must become if it is to continue its history of service to America, to the American people, and to those who come here as students, teachers, and researchers from so many parts of the world. Stephen Joel Trachtenberg President and Professor of Public Administration Financial Reports Report of the Vice President and Treasurer September 8, 1989 For the first time in several years, the University’s financial statements (excluding the Medical Center) reflect an increase in the unrestricted current funds balance, which reverses a long-term trend of University operating expenses exceeding its revenue. While this increase of $536,271 is not large in relationship to revenues exceeding $176 million, it represents a start for future balanced operating budgets. The $0.5 million increase in fund balance in 1989 compares to a loss of $2 million in the prior year. More careful budgeting, improved accounting and monitoring, debt restructuring, selective belt-tightening, and more favorable revenue streams all had a part in the hard earned bottom-line turnaround. Total assets of the University excluding interfund advances increased 3.5 percent over the prior year to a new total of $720,138,735, an increase of $24,056,393. In the Medical Center, the previously growing annual losses have stabilized. While the $11.2 million decrease in current unrestricted fund balance appears worse than last year’s $6.8 million, the significant decrease is not attributable to Medical Center operations but principally to a change in accounting for professional and general liability insurance reserves. The George Washington University has estab- lished a separately managed Trust to fund its liabilities arising from the professional and general liability exposures of the Medical Center. The Trust funding is based on annual actuarial projections by Foster Higgins, our actuarial consultants. Total accrued liabilities are discounted to present value based on our experience, national payout data, and a 9 percent rate of return on the Trust funds. Our rate of return in recent periods has averaged 12 percent. Based on these actuarial projections, the June 30, 1989, Trust balance of $15.9 million is sufficient to cover the accrued liabili- ties as they come due in the future. Of significant help to the Medical Center’s position was the improvement in the George Washington University Health Plan operations. When the University repurchased the Health Plan, the plan had a two-year record of increasing deficits. The deficits have now been trimmed to a point where the Health Plan began to break even in the 4th Quarter of this fiscal year, through cost containment and increased enrollment. If this improved trend can be maintained, it should have a beneficial effect on the Medical Center’s bottom line in future years. While the University Hospital has had a stronger patient census than last year, too many of those patients fell into the category of uncompensated care. The loca- tion of our emergency room in the central city makes it a treatment and care facility for the poor and uninsured. Traditionally we have provided uncompensated care, and each payor, plus income from endowment dedicated to needy patient care, cov- ered the costs of such treatment. Now that third party payors, including the Federal government, are reducing their support for education of medical students and un- compensated care, we become faced with a struggle to provide an increasing amount of free services and make ends meet. This year we had to dig into our fund balance once again to pay our bills for medical care that were not supported by rev- enues. Of continuing concern is the size of the Medical Center accounts receivable, but those receivables have the daily attention of management and steps have been taken to improve our data operations to achieve further improvement in our collec- tion process. 17 Report of the Vice President and Treasurer (CONTINUED) Medical Center management presented a four-year plan to the Board of Trustees in May of this year. This plan provided a road map for a reversal of the patient care loss trend, through cost containment and enhanced revenue opportunities. Univer- sity management and the Board are committed to a resolution of this drain on the financial health of the Medical Center and the University. Total gifts received during the year amounted to $12,190,608, a net increase of $1,056,123 over the prior year. New student loans aggregating $3,070,813 were made to 1,651 students as compared to $1,957,895 loaned to 1,509 students last year. Turning to our investments, during 1988-89 the securities component of the University’s endowment portfolio increased 7.9 percent from $132.6 million to $143.1 million in market value. Of this gain, $5.0 million was due to market appre- ciation while $5.5 million was attributable to new gifts, grants and other sources. Income on the securities component of the endowment has increased from $5.8 million to $7.5 million this year. The market value of the securities portfolio has more than doubled, from $59.0 million to $143.1 million in five years. Because of our investment adviser’s decision to eliminate equity exposure before the October 1987 market crash and thereby protect our endowment value, we have not had to recover from the losses in value most endowments suffered in 1987. Our overlying hedge fund strategy did not track the rise in the market this year, and as a result we underperformed the standard market return indices. We believe that over the long term our strategy of investments will continue to produce above-market total returns as they have in the past. Fiscal year 1988-89 has been good for our real estate investments, with opera- tions of both 2000 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Inc., and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue showing major progress despite a flat D.C. real estate market. At 2000 Pennsylva- nia Avenue, on June 30 virtually all office space was occupied. Tower Video leased 5000 Rentable Square Feet (RSF) of retail space, and we ended the year in good shape. At 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, the first new office tenant moved in on July 23, 1988 and by June 30, 1989, 96 percent of all office space was leased. This was a significant achievement when viewed in the context of the building becoming com- pletely vacant on August 14, 1987, with a year spent in complete remodeling and then tenant fitout before occupancy. Retail space is being leased and only 2200 RSF of retail space remain to be leased if current signed letters of intent are carried to lease. The real estate investment income increased from $3,546,080 in the prior fiscal year to $4,588,716 in fiscal year 1988-89. During 1988-89, the Facilities division completed major new construction and remodeling projects funded through the 1985 and 1985A Bond issues and commer- cial loans. Most noteworthy were the new Ambulatory Care Center, Gelman Library remodeling, Corcoran Hall remodeling and completion of the Telecommunications System. Preliminary planning is underway for the initial building at the University’s new Northern Virginia Campus, after approval in November 1988 of the University Center by the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors. In addition, extensive consul- tant studies have been undertaken related to long-range improvements and possible additions to the University Hospital. Activities are also underway for the planning of housing and academic facilities on the main campus. 18 Report of the Vice President and Treasurer (CONTINUED) During this year, a new cash management facility was created using University credit to place commercial paper on the open market. We believe it has been suc- cessful. We have reduced the costs of short-term borrowing to 150 basis points below bank prime. The variable rate tax exempt notes used to support long-term debt continue to enjoy favorably low interest costs when compared to long-term tax exempt and taxable rates. Last fall we studied whether to move to more fixed rate financing or to buy swaps to achieve a fixing of variable rates. After studying the costs of such steps, we decided to provide for potential runups in variable rate in- terest cost by reserving for additional interest expense this year as well as the next two fiscal years. If rates rise, we then have these reserved dollars to use as protec- tion. If rates fall, we have strengthened the reserves through the savings. As a result of this action, we were able to provide for the rise in tax exempt interest rates that took place this fiscal year. We believe we are now adequately protected from all but catastrophic rises in variable interest rates through this reserving approach. All in all it has been a year of many accomplishments, albeit we still have work to do. The consolidation of financial management activities has made it possible to coordinate the impact of financial decisions and has made a decided contribution to our improvement in financial position. My thanks are extended to the Board Com- mittee on Financial Affairs who have actively participated in financial decisions, our President who has provided leadership, and my colleagues who have participated in the effort to improve the University’s financial position.

The University’s accounting policies with respect to certain items, for which alternate standards are recog- nized, are enumerated below. Restricted gifts are reported as current income in the period received rather than in the period used. The University accounts for its investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, The George Washington University Health Plan, and certain other commercial enterprises on the equity basis of accounting. Endowment income, excluding gains and losses on sales of investments, is reported and distributed as earned. Gains and losses on the sales of investments are accumu- lated with the Endowment Funds’ principal balances. The University does not record depreciation of physical properties except for Hospital and Ambulatory Care Center buildings and equipment. Depreciation charges are not included in current expenses but are recorded in the Plant Funds as reductions of asset value and Net Invest- ment in Plant. Interest incurred during construction is capitalized as part of the cost of capital projects. NOTE 1— VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS Investments are stated at cost, or, in the case of donated investments, at the fair market value at date of acquisition. NOTE 2— TEMPORARY ADVANCES These advances represent the temporary use of Plant Funds and Current Funds for the years ended June 30, 1989 and 1988, respec- tively, pending the receipt of monies from other antici- pated funding sources including grant and loan agree- ments and the receipt of pledged gifts from various donors. NOTE 3— GROUP CONTRACT SETTLEMENTS Hospital charges paid under patient care group contracts are subject to audit and retroactive settlements by third party payors. Estimates for the 1989 and 1988 settlements under these agreements have been provided. NOTE 4— SELF-INSURANCE TRUST The University has established an independently held self-insurance trust for professional liability claims which is funded annually based upon an actuarial determination. In addition, the Univer- sity maintains umbrella coverage for amounts in excess of the basic self-insurance program. The University accrues the estimated cost of asserted and unasserted malpractice claims in the period in which health care services are ren- dered. Such expenses are included in Administration and General. NOTE 5— ENDOWMENT AND SIMILAR FUNDS Assets of Endowment Funds, excluding Funds Held in Trust by Others, had book values at June 30, 1989 and 1988 of $164,986,749 and $159,339,800 and market values of $267,029,251 and $234,562,344 respectively. These funds include 57 funds which are separately invested and 469 funds which are invested on a pooled basis. A summary of book and market values, as of June 30, 1989 and 1988 to- gether with unit value information and earnings per unit in the Consolidated Endowment Funds, is presented below: 1989 1988* Separately Invested Funds Book Value . . . $ 81,507,279 $ 82,127,015 Unrealized Net Gains 85,559,407 63,534,923 Market Value $167,066,686 $145,661,938 Consolidated Endowment Funds Book Value . .. $ 83,479,470 $ 77,212,785 Unrealized Net Gains 16,483,095 11,687,621 Market Value . . . $ 99,962,565 $ 88,900,406 Unit Values Number of Units 3,020,259 2,824,754 Book Value . . . $ 27.64 $ 27.33 Unrealized Net Gains 5.46 4.14 Market Value . . . $ 33.10 $ 31.47 Earnings Per Unit . . . $ 1.613 $ 1.348 * Reclassified for comparative purposes.

NOTE 10— PENSION PLANS Full-time faculty and staff are eligible for participation in the University’s retirement annuity program. The program is administered by inde- pendent fiduciaries to whom all funds are transferred for investment purposes and annuity payments. Effective January 1, 1989 the University retirement plan was amended and completely restated and superseded all prior plan documents. Under the amended plan full-time faculty and staff who were active participants under the provi- sions of the plan immediately prior to the January 1, 1989 date continued to participate in the amended plan without interruption of coverage. Any other eligible employee who reached age 21 and completed two years of service as of January 1, 1989, became a participant on January 1, 1989. Any other present or future employee would become a participant in the plan when the age and period of service conditions are met. Under the amended plan the University contributes on behalf of each participant, for each year of participation in the plan, the sum of 10% of the participant’s regular sal- ary for the plan year. Individual contracts issued under the plan provide for full and immediate vesting of the Univer- sity’s 10% contribution. In addition, certain retirees whose employment pre-dated establishment of the retirement annuity program receive supplemental past service bene- fits which are funded on a current basis. University contri- butions including direct payments to retirees amounted to $13,153,791 in 1989 and $9,374,389 in 1988. Such amounts are included in Administration and General expense. NOTE 11 — CONTINGENCIES The University is a defen- dant in certain pending civil suits. In the opinion of the University, the University has a good defense to the claims not covered by insurance. 31 The George Washington University Report of Independent Accountants To the President and Board of Trustees The George Washington University Washington, D.C. September 8, 1989 In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related state- ment of changes in fund balances (Exhibits A and B) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The George Washing- ton University at June 30, 1989 and 1988, and the changes in its fund balances for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the University’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. Washington University Report of Independent Accountants To the President and Board of Trustees The George Washington University Washington, D.C. September 8, 1989 Washington, D.C. 32 The Campaign For George Washington: A Solid Foundation For The 1990s The Campaign for George Washington, launched in 1985, completed its fourth year in 1988-89 with continued momentum. By June 30, 1989, the total of gifts, pledges, and other commitments to the Cam- paign reached more than $70 million — representing 94 percent of the $75-million goal to be achieved by June 30, 1990. This virtually assures that the Campaign’s objective will be reached ahead of schedule and that the goal will be considerably exceeded by the official closing date. Despite this overall success, however, there remain spe- cific areas of unmet need, which will be emphasized in fund-raising efforts in the Campaign’s final months. Although major gifts are often more common in the early years of a campaign than toward the end, the Campaign for George Washington has continued to benefit from exceptional gifts in its fourth year. Three seven-figure gifts were received in 1988-89, includ- ing $1 million from the Consolidated Rail Corporation (CONRAIL) to endow the L. Stanley Crane Professorship of Engineering, a gift of computer equipment valued at $1.5 million from the Hewlett- Packard Corporation to the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and a bequest of $1.1 million from Hilda Drake for the Medi- cal Center. The Campaign has received eleven gifts of $1 million or more, totaling more than $14 million. The fact that the Campaign for George Washington is unusual in another respect was recently noted by Campaign Chairman Oliver T. Carr, Jr., who observed that the Campaign had \"moved through a presidential transition with strong momentum. The Campaign was initiated under President Elliott in 1985, and President Trachtenberg has continued its pace even as he has faced the many other challenges of his first year in the GW presidency,” Carr said. The George Washington University While the Campaign includes future commitments as well as cur- rent gifts, 1988-89 was also a record year for the University in terms of gifts received. The Annual Fund, including gifts from alumni and others supporting current operating budgets of the University and its various schools, surpassed $6 million for the first time. Gifts to capital purposes, including endowment and facilities, exceeded $7.6 million. With private grants included, total \"voluntary support” hit a record $16.8 million, meaning that philanthropic support of GW has doubled in just five years. Gifts to the Campaign have established new endowed professor- ships, endowed scholarship and fellowship funds, endowments supporting research, libraries, faculty and academic program develop- ment, and other academic purposes. Campaign gifts also have sup- ported facilities improvements, including, among others, renovation of the University Yard and replacement of the floor in the Charles E. Smith Center. Since the Campaign is comprehensive and includes the Annual Fund as well as capital gifts, it has contributed to the pace of academic enhancement in all the schools. Most important, the Campaign for George Washington has en- abled the University to tell its story and win new friends in a way that has established a foundation for meeting future needs and challenges. 34 Campaign for George Cumulative Total of Gifts and Pledges, July 1, 19 85 -June 30, 1989 Current Operations Capital Purposes Washington Goal: ANNUAL FUND RESEARCH AND PROGRAMS BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT ENDOWMENT TOTALS $75 Million, Trustees $ 239,546 N/A $ 800,000 $ 11,008,168 $ 12,047,714 1985-90 Alumni 7,282,082 N/A 50,639 6,642,983 13,975,704 Students, Parents, and Friends 2,457,050 8,500 157,079 ' 6,574,690 9,197,319 Non-alumni Faculty and Staff 316,505 N/A 2,950 1,251,260 1,570,715 Businesses and Corporations 8,905,984 2,905,166 2,320,181 2,627,651 16,758,982 Foundations and Organizations 4,181,528 9,649,625 711,346 2,897,988 17,440,487 Totals $23,382,695 $12,563,291 $4,042,195 $31,002,740 $70,990,921 1988-89 Support for Current Operations, Not Including Research and Programs July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989 Annual Fund ALUMNI DONORS AMOUNT Contributions Columbian College of Arts and Sciences 2,789 $ 230,324 Division of Continuing Education 611 35,863 School of Education and Human Development 1,522 85,533 Elliott School of International Affairs 554 37,577 School of Engineering and Applied Science 1,182 99,969 School of Government and Business Administration 3,089 281,810 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 878 54,442 School of Medicine and Health Sciences 1,517 311,978 National Law Center 4,052 488,839 Other Alumni 171 34,434 Total Alumni 16,365 $ 1,660,769 Other Individuals 1,831 655,004 Businesses, Corporations, Foundations, Organizations 696 3,718,010 Total Annual Fund 18,892 $6,033,783 35 The Luther Rice Society Sheldon S. Cohen, BA ’50 ,JD ’52 Chairman Luther Rice was preeminent among the founders of the George Washington University. The Luther Rice Society was organized in 1968 to perpetuate the memory and ideals of Luther Rice and to give proper recognition to all those who have continued to give exceptional financial support to the University. To provide for such recog- nition, those who give or pledge gifts of $10,000 or more are granted life- time membership in one of four associates categories. Annual member- ship is extended to contributors of $1,000 or more. The George Washington University is deeply indebted to the members of the Luther Rice Society for their lead- ership and for the high standards they have set for all alumni and friends of the University. Their generosity ensures the University’s continued growth and development.
