        "text": "The Strong Women in Emerson’s Life\n\nThis month we begin a Series profiling some of the strong women who were very much a part of Emerson’s life, starting in his childhood. We start with his Aunt Mary Moody, who was instrumental in shaping Emerson’s ideas, writing and actions, starting after his father died when Emerson was just eight-years-old.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson’s Aunt Mary Moody Emerson delivered “the most important part of Emerson’s education,” ultimately influencing his views, reading habits, and his writing. [1] Waldo [2] wrote “A good aunt is more to the young poet than a patron.” [3]\n\nHer involvement in Waldo’s life commenced after his father William Emerson died in 1811 and Mary stepped in to help his widow Ruth raise her five sons. While Mary changed her living situation frequently, her influence was provided through thousands of letters and copies of her journal Almanack, started when she was 20 years old. Waldo began his own journal, The Wide World when he was 17 years old and a student at Harvard. She counseled all the Emerson boys to do what they were afraid to do.\n\nMary’s Almanacks and letters became a rich source of material for Waldo in his own writing, his poems, essays, and lectures. He kept four MME workbooks and often pleaded with Mary to send him sections of her Almanack, which he routinely copied and referred to as his career progressed from minister to author and speaker. After rereading Mary’s letters in 1841, he wrote, “Aunt Mary…is a genius always new, subtle, frolicsome, judicial, unpredictable.” [4]\n\nMary Moody Emerson was born in 1774 to William and Phebe Bliss Emerson; one of their five children, who also included Waldo’s father. Shortly after the American Revolution commenced beside the family home – Concord’s Old Manse – and with her father going to war as a military chaplain, two-year old Mary was sent to her grandmother in Malden, Massachusetts. (This was not an uncommon practice to share responsibility for children among family members).\n\nMary’s father, William, died in 1776 and even after her mother, Phebe, remarried Mary was not called back home. She often referred to this period as her “infant exile.” [5] Her grandmother also died when Mary was four years old and she was adopted by her Aunt Ruth Emerson. Mary’s childhood was characterized by drudgery and a lack of money and food.\n\nDespite humble beginnings and very little access to formal education, Mary became a prolific (but largely unpublished) writer and a voracious reader of works by such authors as Milton, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Plato, and Boston minister William Ellery Channing. She directed her nephew Waldo to read and appreciate these writers.\n\nMary decided at an early age not to marry (although she was asked). Fiercely independent, by the 1830s Mary championed causes of those oppressed, including antislavery movements and women’s rights to better education. She supported her nephew Charles as he gave an antislavery address in Concord in 1835, and attended several abolitionist gatherings. She counted intellectual and free-thinking women as her friends and confidantes, including educator Elizabeth Peabody, scholar Elizabeth Hoar, abolitionist Mary Merrick Brooks, scientist and educator Sarah Alden Bradford Ripley, and Waldo’s wife Lidian Emerson. Mary introduced Lidian to Mary Merrick Brooks, prompting Lidian to join Concord’s Female Antislavery Society.\n\nMary’s appreciation for nature and its impact on thought occurred much earlier than the mid-nineteenth century reflections that permeated essays, books, and talks written by Waldo, Thoreau and others. In the early 1800s, in the words of her biographer, “she lived and wrote a celebration of the solitary imagination and of nature as analogous to God, valuing both explicitly as a woman’s resources.” [6] In 1831, Mary purchased a farm in Waterford, Maine, which she named Elm Vale. She often wrote to her nephews to share her appreciation for the landscape surrounding Elm Vale, including the mountains, the trees and Bear Pond. Waldo, Ruth (Waldo’s mother), Charles and Lidian Emerson, Elizabeth Hoar, Sarah Alden Bradford Ripley, and Elizabeth Peabody, all visited Mary at “Elm Vale”. Mary sold Elm Vale in 1851, which was necessary but also very difficult for her. Before she left she wrote in her Almanack, “What a bird dancing on that graceful limb. Had I but his iron pen how could I give praise for every bird & tree w’h have met my responding senses in this tranquil and beautiful vale.” [7]\n\nEnergetic and very outspoken, Mary was often considered difficult and challenging. But those challenges were more than compensated with her commitment and support to the contemporaries and young people she valued. After meeting with Mary when she was 77 years old, Henry David Thoreau wrote, “it is perhaps her greatest praise and peculiarity that she, more surely than any other woman, gives her companion occasion to utter his best thought. In spite of her own biases, she can entertain a large thought with hospitality…In short, she is a genius…” [8]\n\nRobert Richardson, Jr., author of the Emerson biography The Mind on Fire, wrote in praise of Phyllis Cole’s Mary Moody Emerson and the Origins of Transcendentalism, “Mary Moody Emerson was a founder of Transcendentalism, the earliest and best teacher of R. W. Emerson and a spirited and original genius in her own right.” [9]\n\nMary Moody Emerson died on May 1, 1863, at the age of 88. Six years later, on March 1, 1869 Waldo delivered an address entitled Amita (Latin for Aunt) to the New England Women’s Club in Boston. More than 100 people attended – including Lidian and Ellen Emerson, Elizabeth Peabody, Julia Ward Howe and Louisa May Alcott. In his talk he said that Mary “gave high counsels. It was the privilege of certain boys to have this immeasurably high standard to their childhood; a blessing which nothing else in education could supply.” The minutes recorded from the event pointed out that the presentation enabled attendees to consider “a New England woman of rare gifts and originality of character.” [10]\n\nDiamond\n\nIn the nursery on the second floor of the Ralph Waldo Emerson House in Concord is a substantially-sized antique wooden rocking horse -- with a rounded base, leather saddle and ears, and a horse-hair mane and tail. It stands about three feet tall and four feet long. By Emerson family tradition, the horse's name is \"Diamond.\" On the base, a carved inscription reads:\n\nBuilt about 1750\n\nBought of Mrs. Sophia Parker\n\nAt Woods Hole 1825\n\nBy Lydia Jackson of Plymouth\n\nGiven to children of N. & C. Russell\n\nAnd by them returned to her son\n\nE. W. E. Concord 1849\n\nRepaired 1885\n\nFor as long as I have been a regular visitor to the Emerson House, the rocking horse has always stood out as a fascinating object: full of character, a bit strange, nostalgic, suggestive of idyllic Victorian childhoods and lost Yankee-pastoral ways.\n\nI've always been curious, too, about its history and provenance. The brief version of this history on the base answers some questions, but raises others. Lydia Jackson was Ralph Waldo Emerson's second wife, who hailed from Plymouth on the Massachusetts coast. \"E.W.E.\" was Emerson's youngest son, Edward Waldo Emerson. But other details and persons are not as well known. I decided to try to chase down some of the history of the rocking horse. What I found was an entertaining and adorable story -- one that follows Diamond all over New England; touches on themes of childhood, illness, family, and domesticity; and involves two dramatic incidents at sea -- one of them a shipwreck.\n\nIn 1825, Lydia Jackson of Plymouth, Massachusetts went to stay with her maternal aunt, Sophia Cotton Parker, in Woods Hole, near Falmouth, on the southwestern coast of Cape Cod. It was a three-week trip, one that Lydia, later called Lidian, would for the rest of her life remember fondly -- and to which she would even attach great, if somewhat obscure, significance. Lydia was twenty-three years old at the time, an orphan from the age of sixteen: intellectual, eccentric, sickly, deeply interested in matters of religion and the spirit, and, although not widely considered a great beauty, striking in appearance, with dark brown hair and a complexion of \"Cherries in milk,\" as one admiring female friend had it. She had not yet met Ralph Waldo Emerson, the minister-turned-lecturer-and-essayist who would later become her husband and companion of forty-seven years.\n\nEver since the nearly simultaneous death of both her parents in 1818, Lydia had boarded with various relatives in Plymouth, including, since 1821, her uncle Rossiter Cotton and aunt Priscilla Jackson Cotton. Her mother's sister Sofia Parker -- \"Aunt Parker\" as she was known -- lived 40 miles to the south in the seaside village of Woods Hole, where for years Sofia and her husband Seth Parker kept a local tavern. Seth Parker had died in 1814, and at the time of Lydia's visit to Woods Hole the widow Parker was seventy years old. Lydia counted her stay with Aunt Parker to be \"one of the most important and interesting occasions of her life,\" as she later told her daughter Ellen, although she could never quite pinpoint why. She spent much of her time alone, on the hill behind the house, thinking to herself and reading Walter Scott's novel The Betrothed. \"I don't know how it was, it was different from any other experience,\" she told Ellen. \"I felt all the time as if my Mother's spirit was very near me.\"\n\nThe death of her parents was only one of the two major hardships that had afflicted Lydia in recent years. The other was a bout of scarlet fever she contracted in 1821 at age nineteen, which nearly killed her and left her permanently riddled with digestive problems and other mysterious ailments, whether organic or psychosomatic. In the aftermath of her illness, Lydia had developed a strict, ascetic diet; slept four hours per night (in emulation of Napoleon, an improbable hero for a twenty-three-year old woman with reclusive tendencies); experimented with a variety of medical therapies, from hydrotherapy to mesmerism to homeopathy; and observed an exercise routine that included her dancing steps, jumping rope, and leaping over a wooden footstool. The solace she found at her aunt's home in Woods Hole was welcome respite from the privation and anxiety of Lydia's life since the death of her parents.\n\nStill, she needed to keep up her exercises, and it was in this context that Lydia first encountered the rocking horse, already an antique in 1825. Its early history is obscure. The toy had once belonged to Aunt Parker's son John Parker, Lydia's older cousin, who had received it as a gift from family friends in Roxbury around 1800 when he was a boy. Nothing else is known of the rocking horse's earlier history, except for what we are told by the inscription on its base: that it was made around 1750. And so about fifty years of the horse's history are essentially a blank. Given that it came to Woods Hole from Roxbury, it seems reasonable to assume it was fashioned somewhere in Boston or its environs — although who knows? After the Parker children grew up, the horse seems to have stayed in the immediate family. When Lydia saw the rocking horse, according to Ellen's later account, she \"took a notion that it would be good exercise for her to ride it every day--almost as good as riding a real horse.\" Lydia offered to trade a mahogany table she owned back in Plymouth for the horse. Aunt Parker agreed, and, according to Ellen, \"the exchange was effected by sea.\"\n\nIf a grown woman buying a child's toy for her own use seems a little strange, Lydia probably had more than just her exercise regimen in mind. Lydia was at that time just warming up to what was evidently her new familial role, that of a spinster-aunt. John Parker remembered that she had bought the horse not for herself, but rather for her niece, Sophia Brown -- the eight-year-old daughter of Lydia's older sister, Lucy Jackson Brown. Lydia was a doting aunt to Sophia and her younger brother Frank, and would become even more involved in their care after Lucy's miscreant husband Charles Brown abandoned the family, running off to Istanbul, in 1834. Regardless of who was its intended recipient, though, the horse was soon bound by ship for Plymouth, and Lydia's cousin John, a sailor and a veteran of the naval war of 1812, agreed to accompany what had once been his own childhood toy on its journey thence.\n\nAt this point, the story of the rocking horse takes a picaresque turn. According to a later account by Ellen Emerson, John Parker reported that \"some drunken sailors” aboard the ship “pushed it overboard.\" And what do you do with a drunken sailor? Ellen’s account goes on: \"The Captain he scolded them & made 'em look for it, & they found it, only its head was broken off in the fall.\" After cousin John delivered the broken pieces of the rocking horse in Plymouth, presumably retrieving the mahogany table in the process, Lydia herself returned to Plymouth at the end of her three weeks in Woods Hole. Once home with her aunt and uncle Cotton, she was able to get the toy mended. And indeed if you examine the artifact closely today you can see a fracture line where the head was clearly broken off and reattached.\n\nThe details of the next twenty-five years or so of the rocking horse's history are somewhat sketchy, although the object seems to have remained in Plymouth. Sophia Brown presumably played with it as a toy in her childhood. Ultimately it was given -- or possibly sold -- to family friends. The inscription informs us that the horse was \"given to children of N. & C. Russell,\" without specifying exactly when. \"N. & C. Russell\" were Nathaniel Russell, Jr. (1801-1875) -- the older brother of Lydia's best friend Mary Russell -- and Nathaniel's wife, Catherine Elliott Russell (1807-1884). Nathaniel and Catherine Russell's four children were Elliott (b. 1828), Martha (b. 1830), Francis (b. 1832), Anna (b. 1835), Nathaniel (b. 1837), and Kate (b. 1840). Some or all of these Russell children likely played with the rocking horse.\n\nThe larger Russell clan were among Lydia's closest connections in Plymouth. Mary Russell was her friend and confidante. Mary and Nathaniel's father, also named Nathaniel, was an iron manufacturer, local notable, and former ship's captain who in 1827 had purchased a fine Federal-style mansion in downtown Plymouth. \"Captain Russell,\" as he was known, was an ebullient personality and a friend of Lydia's parents before their deaths. It was natural that the rocking horse should be left in the orbit of this prominent local family when, in 1834, Lydia departed Plymouth to begin her new married life with Ralph Waldo Emerson in Concord. In fact, it was inside the Russell home on Court Street that Lydia, by then aged 32, first met Emerson, at a social gathering after a lecture he had given in Plymouth in February 1834. A brief courtship and proposal followed. Depending on when the rocking horse was given to the Russell children, it may have been on the premises for Lydia and Waldo's first meeting. Alternatively, if the horse was still in Lydia's possession, it may have looked on during their wedding at Winslow House in Plymouth on September 14, 1835.\n\nIn any case, the toy did not follow the newlyweds when they moved to Concord into the house they would call \"Bush\" (now the Ralph Waldo Emerson House). Waldo and Lydia -- who was now renamed \"Lidian\" at her husband's prompting -- lived in Concord for the next forty-seven years, as the couple hosted a constant stream of visitors in their home, Waldo became one of the preeminent figures in American literature, and Lidian gave birth to four children: Waldo (b. 1837), Ellen (b. 1839), Edith (b. 1841), and Edward (b. 1844). The rocking horse did not figure into the childhoods of the older Emerson children, although there are glimpses to suggest that other toy horses were present in the home. In July 1839, Emerson writes of Waldo in his journal: \"I like my boy with his endless sweet soliloquies & iterations and his utter inability to conceive why I should not leave all my nonsense, business, & writing & come to tie up his toy horse, as if there was or could be any end to nature beyond his horse. And he is wiser than we when he threatens his whole threat 'I will not love you.'\" Waldo died of scarlet fever in 1842, at age five -- an event that devastated both parents and inspired Emerson's poem \"Threnody.\" Lidian's old rocking horse, meanwhile, gathered dust in the garret of the Russell house on Court Street.\n\nRocking horses do not appear again in the historical record of the Emerson household until early 1848 -- a time of great activity for Emerson and the world at large. Democratic revolutions against monarchical rule were exploding across Europe; the potato crop failed in Ireland, leading to the Great Famine and mass Irish emigration to America; Italian unification was heating up; and a women's right's convention formed at Seneca Falls, New York. Emerson was in the midst of an eight-month journey abroad to Great Britain and France, from November 1847 until June 1848. In the course of his trip, his second to Europe, Emerson lectured all over England and Scotland, renewed his friendship with Thomas Carlyle, observed a mass Chartist convention in London, and visited Paris in the recent aftermath of the February Revolution. It was an eventful and formative experience for him, which he wrote about extensively in his book English Traits (1856).\n\nBut a more domestic duty also weighed on Emerson as he toured Europe. Before he had left Concord for Europe, the family's youngest son Edward, then aged three, had asked his father to bring him back a \"red London orange\" (a blood orange? a child's fancy?) and a rocking horse. In January 1848, Emerson was lecturing his way through Yorkshire when he received a letter from his eight-year-old daughter Ellen encouraging his speedy return home and reminding him of his promises to \"Eddy.\" The plea came in the form of a rhyming poem:\n\nFather is absent, at England is he,\n\nHe went in a ship a few weeks ago.\n\nHis form we do not any one of us see\n\nExcept in our dreams, -- when we wake we say, No.\n\nO father, come quickly, bring Edward the red\n\nHis red London orange, & rockinghorse too.\n\nFor he would not like to know that tis said.\n\nThat oranges are no more red than they're blue.\n\nEmerson shared Ellen's poem with Elizabeth Ashurst Biggs, the daughter of a radical lawyer and abolitionist hosted him in Manchester (and later a novelist in her own right). He commented that Ellen's verses were \"pretty good for a girl who is not yet nine.\"\n\nEmerson followed through on his promise, although he did not buy the rocking horse until the summer. His miscellaneous notebook of expenses from July 1848 records transactions with three London merchants -- John Davison of Hatton Garden, Robert Henderson of Snow Hill, and Paul Leach of Holborn -- with the word \"rockinghorse\" written next to them; it is unclear what part each of these men had in the fashioning of the toy. Although Emerson's notes are fragmentary and ambiguous, the purchase was apparently made for 50 shillings. Nothing is known of this other, English rocking horse that was intended for Edward -- not even its name. (Nothing more at all is said of the red London orange.) Emerson arranged to have the horse -- along with two busts of the Egyptian goddess Isis that he had also purchased on his European travels -- sail back to America aboard the Ocean Monarch, an emigration barque bound for Boston, which departed Liverpool on the morning of August 24, 1848.\n\nBut Eddy's London rocking horse never made it. The Ocean Monarch's August voyage, as it happened, turned into one of the most notorious shipwrecks of the mid-nineteenth century. The ship, launched the previous year and built by the Canadian-American designer Donald McKay, of clipper ship fame, was the largest in the American merchant fleet at the time, measuring 177 feet. Eight hours into her journey out of Liverpool, a fire broke out in the stern of the ship, probably caused by steerage passengers who had been smoking and from whom the captain had earlier confiscated smoking pipes. Passengers panicked and began jumping overboard. The ship dropped anchor, and after an extensive rescue effort conducted by nearby ships who had spotted the blaze, the Ocean Monarch sank 14 fathoms to the bottom of the sea, taking 179 souls with her -- as well as Emerson's furniture bound for Concord: the two busts of Isis and Eddy's rocking horse.\n\nWe know about the demise of the London rocking horse from a letter by Waldo to his older brother William on October 19, 1848, near the end of his European sojourn, which explains what happened and also efficiently recounts what happened next. \"Did I tell you that Eddy's rocking horse & my casts of Isis were lost in the Ocean Monarch?\" he asks. \"The bill of landing was bro't me by Joseph Lyman. Lidian & the boy received the news at Plymouth, & Nathaniel Russell, to whom Lidian had once sold an old family rocking horse, only junior to the Trojan Horse, magnificently explored his garret, & made it a present to Eddie. The horse arrived in Concord amidst uproarious acclamations of our youngest people.\" And so there you have the story of how Diamond came back into the family: upon receiving the disappointing news that her son's toy was at the bottom of the ocean, Lidian had gone to her old friends the Russells. Captain Russell had dug out the old antique -- \"only junior to the Trojan horse\" -- of her young adulthood, told Eddy it was now his, and had the horse shipped to Concord, where it arrived to shouts of joy from the other Emerson children, Ellen and Edith.\n\nIt was at this point, according to Ellen Emerson, that the horse was given the name Diamond. The horse remained a beloved object among the Emerson children; this much is evident from the attention Ellen and Edward devoted to gathering and preserving its history when they were both adults. In 1870, after relaying an aging John Parker's memories of the rocking horse's misadventures at sea with the drunken sailors, and its subsequent repair, Ellen wrote to Edward: \"Preserve this archive of the horse, I'll have it mended again.\" And she did, in 1885, if the inscription on the base is to be believed.\n\nA later chapter of Diamond's history is known to me only because of family lore. For I have a more than scholarly connection to this object and its previous owners. Ralph Waldo Emerson was my great-great-great grandfather. Lidian was my great-great-great grandmother. Edward Emerson, \"Eddy,\" their youngest son -- later a doctor and writer in his own right -- was my great-great grandfather. Edward's only surviving son, Raymond Emerson, to whom the rocking horse was passed on after Edward, was my great-grandfather. Raymond and his wife Amelia kept the rocking horse in the front hall of their home in Concord; upon their deaths, the horse was given back to the Emerson House, where it remains today.\n\nI remember the first time I saw Diamond, it was during a tour of the Emerson House sometime around 2013, when I was reading quite a bit of Emerson's writing, becoming acquainted with his life and legacy as I studied American cultural and intellectual history in graduate school, and attempting to reconnect with the Emerson branch of my family history. I brought two nephews of mine -- my sister's sons -- on a tour of the Emerson House, where I had never been before, and where we were greeted graciously at the door by a guide. The guide walked us through the house without realizing that we were all of us descendants. When we reached the nursery, she pointed out the rocking horse and claimed that descendants of Ralph Waldo Emerson were still permitted, to this day, to ride Diamond. I leaned over to my nephews and whispered, \"want to hop on, boys?\" They smiled and said nothing; the guide looked confused.\n\nAfter my visit to the house, I asked my Dad if he remembered anything about Diamond. And indeed he had fond memories of \"Dinah,\" as he misremembered the horse's name: romping over it with his siblings and older cousins, essentially manhandling the poor thing in the foyer of his grandparents home during the 1950s. It's lucky, in all that horseplay, that they didn't break off the head again!\n\nCharlie Riggs, PhD,\n\nGreat-Great-Great Grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nChristopher Cranch, Transcendentalist, Artist and Follower of Emerson\n\nThe following article, written by Sasha Archibald, is reprinted from The Public Domain Review and captures the essence of Christopher Cranch, who turned some of Emerson’s essay phrases into illustrations, and became a devoted friend. We have one of Cranch’s paintings in the Ralph Waldo Emerson house, given to Emerson as a thank you “for a lifetime of solace.”\n\nPublic Domain Review Article\n\nChristopher Pearse Cranch (1813–1892) is remembered for bringing levity to Transcendentalism. At the various gatherings that soldered the movement, the good-looking Cranch played the flute and guitar, loved to sing loudly, and pretended to talk to animals. “We have transcendental and aesthetic gatherings at a great rate”, he reported to his sister, “and they make me sing at them all. I have worn my Tyrolese yodlers almost to the bones . . . I am quite a singing lion.” Cranch was also quick with the pen, making witty sketches on the spot. His best party trick was to sketch satirical illustrations of sentences plucked from Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Nature (1836) — a book that Cranch and his friends admiringly devoured. Emerson’s earthy, concrete analogies invited image-making.\n\nIt started one evening, when Cranch and a friend, the minister and publisher James Freeman Clarke, began illustrating various Emerson quotes by literalizing the author’s figurative language. The two men doodled and giggled, so much so that when the visit ended, they continued to exchange drawings in the mail. Cranch was the more skilled artist, and Clarke egged him on. Clarke collected some of the drawings into a scrapbook, titled Illustrations of the New Philosophy, and sent others round to friends — all people who revered Emerson and received the satire with its intended geniality. The sketches were passed among Transcendentalist-leaning social circles in New York and Boston to the point that Cranch bragged, “My drawings . . . permeate all houses, as water doth a sponge. Wherever I go I hear of them.” Clarke also sent a selection directly to Emerson, who received the caricatures not as an insult, but an overture of friendship. Emerson and Cranch soon became lifelong friends.\n\nThe sketches were cheeky, teasing, and toothless. They deflated Emersonian pretention, but were clearly the product of genuine delight — Cranch found Emerson’s language lively and fresh, and the drawings were his simpatico reply. One of the most popular depicted Emerson’s head perched atop a giant ridged melon, captioned with the Nature quotation, “I expand and live in the warm day, like corn and melons.” Others were similarly straightforward. When Emerson said in an address at Harvard, “Men in the world today are bugs”, Cranch drew a horde of upright insects, and when Emerson exclaimed “How they lash us with those tongues of theirs!” Cranch drew eight rope-like tongues and a cowering victim. Cranch’s illustration of “Few grown-up persons see the sun” is precisely what it says: a cluster of learned adults clueless to the radiance above. Even when the satire was more acerbic, it was a joke among friends. One such doodle, now lost, depicted Margaret Fuller driving the Transcendentalist carriage, reins in hand, with Emerson lounging in the back seat.\n\nThe best known of Cranch’s sketches is the “transparent eyeball” drawing. The version featured below shows an eyeball in a dinner jacket and top hat, his optic nerves forming a low ponytail. It was shrewd of Cranch to home in on this baffling phrase. Eyeballs perceive transparency, but aren’t themselves transparent, so what did Emerson mean? Context helps, a bit. “Transparent eyeball” appears near the end of Nature’s first chapter, when Emerson is trying to describe precisely why walking in the woods has a curative effect.\n\nStanding on the bare ground,— my head bathed by the blithe air,— and uplifted into infinite space — all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God.\n\nBodily dissolution is key to these enchanted moments, except the body can’t entirely dissolve, because one part of the body — the eyes — induces the dissolution. “I am nothing; I see all” is the operational tangle that leads Emerson to the paradoxical “transparent eyeball”. Cranch’s illustrative figure is appropriately at odds with itself. Its posture is debonair, and its hands seem to have melted away, but its large eyeball-head, with barely the suggestion of a lid, stares upward, rapt and transfixed, as if communing directly with the sun.\n\nSome scholars have described these jottings as the pinnacle of Cranch’s life achievement. That’s a little harsh, but it’s true that Cranch’s cleverness never begat an illustrious career. He came from a prestigious, accomplished family that was deeply intertwined over three generations with that of President John Adams and his son, President John Quincy Adams. (John Adams and Cranch’s grandfather married two remarkable sisters, Mary and Abigail Adams; Christopher Pearse Cranch married John Quincy Adam’s sister.)\n\nCranch was less conventional than his father, grandfather, and brother, and less impelled to do things he didn’t like doing. The poet and abolitionist James Russell Lowell described his friend thus: blessed with “gifts enough for three—only his foolish fairy left the brass out when she brought her gifts to his cradle.” As a young man, Cranch entered the ministry, but spoke with too much diffidence to be a charismatic preacher. He was never ordained, and instead traveled, taking the pulpit for short stints in different cities. His burgeoning interest in Transcendentalism threatened what thin career prospects he had, and after his dear friend and fellow Transcendentalist John Sullivan Dwight was forced to resign the ministry, Cranch quit in solidarity, and burned his sermons.\n\nWith no training of any sort, he announced at age thirty that he would become a landscape painter. Unfortunately, his talent was middling. A “major mediocrity” is how he’s described by his biographer. Cranch’s unorthodox career left his wife and family of three children perpetually short on funds. They couldn’t afford to live in New York — where “greenbacks melt like snowflakes on hot griddles”, Cranch complained in 1863 — and so they settled for a decade in Paris. Cranch painted a great deal, but he also translated Virgil, published poems and reviews in The Dial and other magazines, and wrote two novels for children. He corresponded with many distinguished friends, and penned opera star Jenny Lind’s adieu to her American audiences. But nothing stuck. Few of his paintings sold, and his four books of poetry landed too quietly. One of them, ill-advisedly titled Satan, reportedly sold not a single copy.\n\nLike many humorists, Cranch was privately melancholic, and his depressive stints deepened as he aged. A posthumous tribute in Harper’s Magazine bluntly noted that Cranch was often silent and withdrawn. Certainly he had cause: the strain of his financial struggles, his artistic mediocrity, the fact that his father was mortified by his association with the Transcendentalists; the premature death of two sons.\n\nCranch himself, however, said the “blues” were simply part of his character, and always had been. For relief, he looked to music, and also to Emerson. Cranch could recite pages of Nature aloud; the book reliably lifted his spirits for four decades. Thirty-five years after the satirist and his subject went huckleberry picking together on Walden Pond, Cranch sent Emerson a new landscape painting to thank him for a lifetime of solace. “I owe you for all that your works have been to me.”\n\nEmerson’s Mountain Interval\n\nIt is well known that the untimely death of Emerson’s young first wife in 1831 from tuberculosis, and his own unease with church ritual led to his separation from the traditional ministry. But what do we make of the 1832 midsummer trip he took to the high mountains of New England between deep personal loss and the new calling he would soon pursue?\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Emerson’s career as a minister was already in decline. In late spring he had explained to his colleagues at Second Church of his terms for continuing as Associate Minister, terms they would eventually reject. He confided to his journal: “I have sometimes thought that, in order to be a good minister, it was necessary to leave the ministry” (Selected Journals, 193).\n\nBut first Emerson found it necessary to simply leave town, and retreated to his Aunt Mary Moody Emerson’s home in South Waterford, Maine. As Mary’s biographer Phyllis Cole noted, “He sought distance from the city—and also a kindred, if critical listener.” Then Emerson pressed west to Conway, New Hampshire, and up the Mount Washington Valley for a stay at Ethan Allen Crawford’s hostelry, at what was then called “the Gate of the White Mountains,” the spectacular pass known today as Crawford Notch.[1]\n\nMountains in myth are associated with divinity and the arts. In the classic tradition, Mount Olympus was the sacred dwelling of the gods, Mount Parnassus the home of the Muses, closely associated with poetry and the oracular. Emerson was also intrigued by the English Romantic poet William Wordsworth (1770-1850), who often invoked mountains in his nature-worshiping lyric poetry.[2] Philosophical, Wordsworth engaged in issues relating to individual spiritual experience within nature, as well as in organized religious community, as Emerson would—and before another year passed the two men would meet.\n\nIn his nature poetry, Wordsworth explored the heights and long views of mountain experience—the vast and infinite spaces in which humans may sense the divine, a presence engendering at once bliss and fear. The type of landscape that evokes this emotional response has long been called “sublime.” Decades later, Emerson would invoke this concept in the phrase “on the mountain-crest sublime” in his 1867 poem “Waldeinsamkeit” (Collected Poems, 189-91).\n\nHowever familiar Emerson already was with hilltops in myth and poetry, it was likely his own Aunt Mary who planted the seed of her nephew’s first-hand mountain musings, the direct experience that is to nature writing what field notes are to a scientist. A pioneer in the Transcendentalist movement and an early influence on her brilliant nephew, she enjoyed breathtaking views of the northern Appalachians from her home in South Waterford, Maine. As early as 1823, Emerson wrote to a friend: “My aunt…has spent a great part of her life in the country, is an idolater of nature, and counts but a small number who merit the privilege of dwelling among the mountains…as the temple where God and the mind are to be studied and adored, and where the fiery soul can begin a premature communication with the other world” (qtd. in Cabot, v. 1, 96-97).\n\nThree years later, Emerson was considering mountains as a place to reflect and a timeless source of wisdom, as he wrote to Aunt Mary: “I behold along the line men of reverend pretension, who have waited on mountains or slept in caverns to receive from unseen intelligence a chart of the unexplored country, a register of what is to come” (qtd. in Cabot, v. 1, 113).[3]\n\nMost of all, perhaps, Emerson’s scenic retreat in 1832 ultimately provided solitude, and the calm, remote atmosphere he needed to make a pivotal decision. From Conway on July 6, he wrote: “Here, among the mountains, the pinions of thought should be strong, and one should see the errors of men from a calmer height of love & wisdom. … Religion in the mind is not credulity, & in the practice is not form. It is a life” (Selected Journals, 193-94).\n\nEnsconced at the top of Crawford Notch on July 14, he wrote: “The good of going into the mountains is that life is reconsidered…and you have opportunity of viewing the town at such a distance as may afford you a just view nor can you have any such mistaken apprehension as might be expected from the place you occupy & the round of customs you run at home (Selected Journals, 194).\n\nStill agonizing on the 15th, he wrote: “A few low mountains, a great many clouds always cover-ing the great peaks, a circle of woods to the horizon, a peacock on the fence or in the yard, & two travel-ers no better contented than myself in the plain parlor of this house make up the whole picture of this unsabbatized Sunday” (Selected Journals,195).\n\nBut later that same day, he seems to reach the decision he will live with—he concludes he cannot continue with “indifference & dislike” to a church practice others consider “the most sacred” (Selected Journals, 195). Back in Boston in September Emerson delivered his last sermon to his pastorate, ex-plaining his resignation. After touring Europe, he returned home in 1833 to begin his major career as a public lecturer and writer.\n\nMountains continued to occupy a place in Emerson’s imagination, itineraries, and poetry. In an unguarded 1841 journal entry, he recalled Aunt Mary, his brothers, and the mountains when he wrote: “…I would fain quit my present companions…& betake myself to some Thebais, some Mount Athos in the depths of New Hampshire or Maine, to bewail my innocency & to recover it, & with it the power to commune again with these sharers of a more sacred idea” (Selected Journals, 778).\n\nHe enjoyed a long stay in the Adirondacks with like-minded friends in the summer of 1858. With daughter Ellen, he climbed Vermont’s Mt. Mansfield in 1868 and returned to Crawford Notch in 1875, going further north to Bretton Woods. He visited Yosemite in 1871, at John Muir’s invitation. And of course, he had rambled in the Berkshires and knew Mount Monadnoc from family excursions.\n\nMountains are the subject of, or appear in many of Emerson’s poems including “Waldeinsam-keit,” “The Adirondacs,” “The World Soul,” and “May Day.” His 1847 poem “Monadnoc” is among those that express the intuitive communion he felt when alone in the presence of limitless nature to be found in the high hills.
