        "text": "My husband and I have lived here for about 3 years. After being in the military myself and living around the country I have to say this is one of my least favorite places. The people here, if you were born n raised here u fit in. If not outsiders are not welcome. I don’t care anyone says. If you know someone here or related to them you are good to go! I would not recommend moving here unless you are ready to be discriminated. It is a tight knit community and no room for outsiders. I wish we knew before we bought.\n\nVery small, very quiet, very nosy town. adult life is slow and easy going, teenage life is horrible. The average young adult will have a hard time finding much to do in coxsackie. Property value is great. Most people are very friendly. Diversity is lacking. The job market is limited.\n\nMy experience living in Coxsackie is great. The people are friendly , the schools are good and the amount of job opportunities is good. It’s a cozy small town and you can walk almost anywhere and there is many parades and events to go to. There is also a farmers market on Wednesday down by the river. The playgrounds for children are very nice and clean and the beauty is in the river and forest trails.\n\nCoxsackie is perfect if you want a small quiet town. There's a nice school, Coxsackie-Athens. Many places to go shopping within a half hour including two malls. Multiple places to go to a movie theatre near by. Aw well as two drive-ins less than 15 minutes away.\n\nCoxsackie is a nice area compared to nearby areas, but there isn't much to do at all. The most teenagers can do for fun around here is eat or drive to Albany and find something to do.\n\nThe overall atmosphere where I live is rather harsh. Honestly, its your typical small town, if you don't dress and act like everyone else, then you don't fit in. Not fitting in, in this town, it most likely the worst thing for teenagers because those who do fit in, make it known that you are an outcast. Being that it is such a small town, word travels fast and you end up being alone."
