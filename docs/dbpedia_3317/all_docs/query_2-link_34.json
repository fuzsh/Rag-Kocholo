        "text": "Charles Howard Edwards, 73, of Lawrence, passed away Thursday, July 20, 2023, at Bronson Hospital after a recent illness.\n\nHe was born January 26, 1950, in Chicago, the son of Everett Edwards and Stella (Filipczyk) Edwards.\n\nCharles had many hobbies and interests. He enjoyed woodworking, grocery shopping, motorcycles and his photography. However, his favorite pastimes included traveling around to classic car shows in the good weather. He was proud to show off his dream car that he has owned since high school, a 1966 Chevelle 540 5 speed. Some would say he was addicted to his Tv, but he had a passion for old westerns like John Wayne and most of all, Star Trek. Charles also felt history was very important and enjoyed studying up on it as much as he could.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Patricia Edwards, two sons, Joe (Linda) Edwards and Steve Edwards; one daughter, Sondra (Ryan) Pero, eight grandchildren, Paige (Logan), Kirsten, Britney (Vincent), Trenten (Teasia), Brianna (Ciara), Lyndsie (Brad) and Amy (Cameron), along with many great grandchildren and his brother, David (Nan) Edwards and his sister, Amy Edwards. He was preceded in death by his sister, Sally Butler and his granddaughter, Brooke Edwards."
