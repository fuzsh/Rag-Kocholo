        "text": "PAUL J. CRAW\n\nPaul Joseph Craw died peacefully as he lived, at his home on the banks of the Hudson River, a place as beautiful as you’d see anywhere on earth, surrounded by his loving family and friends, on Thursday, July 4. His spirit is now free.\n\nPaul was born on February 22, 1949, to the late Leonard “Sliv” Craw and Mary Kennedy Craw and he was raised and spent most of his life in the charming Village of Coxsackie, New York. He began school at Mansion Street Elementary in the Coxsackie-Athens School District and then attended St. Patrick’s Central Catholic High School in Catskill, where he did very well as a bright student and a reverent altar boy. Paul loved to play baseball and played for the Braves of Coxsackie Little League with his great friends Tommy and Peter and Michael and Arky. Later, he played softball, catcher and short field, for Rocky’s Tavern. He remained a fierce and passionate Yankee fan forever. As they grew older, Paul and his buddies ventured further afield, sharing many memorable times on the Hudson River fishing, swimming, and canoeing, and through the Catskill Mountain towns on hilarious misadventures.\n\nAfter high school, Paul went to stay with his sister, Elizabeth, and her young family of six girls in Kingston, New York, where he attended Ulster County Community College for a Liberal Arts degree. Returning to Coxsackie, he began a 25-year career as a Logistics and Warehouse Manager at American Tree and Wreath. He subsequently worked for the trucking company, Van Auken Express, in Greenville for a decade, before going to work for the Greene County Department of Mental Health in Cairo for 17 years, until his retirement.\n\nIn 1971, Paul began dating a beautiful girl he’d met years before in her family’s little corner grocery store. He fell in love and would spend 51 years alongside his beloved Rosemarie Petrigliano, a beauty school student, soon to become a talented and successful hairdresser. The happy couple married on May 5, 1973, at St. Mary’s Church on Mansion Street, and honeymooned in Woodstock, beginning their new life together. This marriage was truly a match made in Heaven and everyone who spent even a little time with them could easily recognize their deep attachment to each other. For over five decades, Paul and Rose remained totally delighted with each other, sharing lots of laughter and tenderness and patience through good times and sad times alike. They have been an inspiration to all who have been fortunate to know them.\n\nAfter Paul’s retirement, he and Rose had some extra time to spend on the things and endeavors they liked best. They enjoyed trips to the beach at Lake Taghkanic State Park and to Atlantic City or Rivers Casino for occasional gambling adventures and their annual visit to their nieces’ homes along the east coast. At home, Paul loved to garden and planted many lovely trees and flowers, especially his favorites salmon-colored geraniums and his butterfly bush. He and Rose enjoyed the many varieties of wild birds that would visit their porch, almost as much as they adored Lucky, their personable and intelligent ginger cat. Paul loved dinner at Che Figata, where he would keep the bar crowd entertained with his quick wit and his deadpan delivery of quiet, clever one-liners, while sipping his IPA and maybe catching a game on TV. Along with baseball, Paul loved NCAA basketball, March Madness, and the Tarheels. Paul cherished spending time with friends and relatives, especially Jackie and the late Matthew Kennedy. Rose and Paul were well known for hosting hundreds at their fun summer parties in their fabulous yard on the Hudson River. But Paul also enjoyed spending time at home, watching PBS, or tucked into the pages of a good book, in his chair by the fireplace, smelling Rose’s cooking and her delicious apple pies. Paul had a deep appreciation for the simple, sweet things in life, and he demonstrated that with his gratitude, his affection, and his mischievous, infectious grin, which will be forever remembered, and missed, by his many friends and family.\n\nIn addition to his beloved wife Rose, Paul is survived by his nieces Mary Elizabeth Wagner, Rosemary & Mark Kauffmann, Kathleen & Tom Costello, Susan Wagner, Jennifer & John Aaron Whittington, and Victoria & Stephen Decker and their respective children. He leaves his beloved in-laws George Petrigliano, Patricia & David Stockman, and Virginia Hillicoss, and their children Lisa, Angela, Jason, Evan, Chyenne, and Savannah as well as Great-Nieces/Nephews & cousins. Paul was predeceased by his sister, Elizabeth Wagner and her husband, Victor Wagner, his brother-in-law, Gary Hillicoss, and by his cousins, Matt Kennedy (Jacqueline), Arlene Kennedy Hohenstein, and Michael Deubert (Linda).\n\nVisitation will be held from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm on Wednesday, July 10th, 2024 at St. Mary's Church, 80 Mansion St, Coxsackie, NY.\n\nFuneral Mass will immediately follow the visitation with Reverend John Moyna, celebrant.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to St. Mary's Church at the address listed above.\n\nArrangements have been entrusted by the family to the care of The Dufresne & Cavanaugh Funeral Home; Vincent Perniciaro & Michael Lobb, Funeral Directors.\n\nFor further information please visit www.dufresneandcavanaugh.com."
