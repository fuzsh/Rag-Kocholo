        "text": "This post came to me via email this morning from Peter Feinman of the Institute of History, Archaeology, and Education, in Purchase, NY. While it is not directly about New York City history, it is about the prismatic versions of history as they come to us via, in some part, our media capital.\n\n“In the Cold War period, there was a Soviet propaganda machine. Every day it created different lies. They would believe them and expect the world to believe them.” Ahmet Davutoghu, Prime Minister, Turkey (NYT 12/4/15)\n\nWhen she left the White House, she was dead broke.\n\nObama is foreign-born.\n\nJoseph built the pyramids.\n\nShe is a lifelong Yankee fan.\n\nObama is a Moslem.\n\nThe pyramids were granaries.\n\nAll her grandparents were immigrants.\n\nObama has an anti-American colonialist agenda.\n\nJefferson wrote the Constitution.\n\nShe made $100,000 by reading the financial pages.\n\nMoslems in Jersey City danced in the streets in celebration of the attack on 9/11.\n\nChina is in Syria.\n\nShe was shot at on the tarmac.\n\nMurdered white people primarily are killed by blacks.\n\nHer loving husband was stalked by a loony-toon.\n\nBill Gates can “close up” the internet.\n\nShe wanted the convenience of one electronic device.\n\nSo many Union and Confederate soldiers died at the river by the 14th hole of his golf course that it became known as “The River of Blood.”\n\nI’m qualified to be president.\n\nAll of these items are true. In Hillaryland. In Trumptown. In Carson City. None of them are true in the real world. None of that matters to Rodhamites. None of that matters to Trumpies. None of that matters to Carsonists. Why not? What is going on?\n\nThe killing of Bin Laden in Pakistan by a United States Navy SEAL team had to\n\nhave been faked, because the Qaeda leader was not even in Pakistan according to\n\nPakistani television host and commentator Zaid Hamid (NYT 12/17/15).\n\nWe are a storytelling species. Our stories exist not by chance but with purpose. On one level stories may seem like entertaining yarns that help us to pass the time of day in a enjoyable way. On another level, they are the glue that holds individuals, families, nations, religions, and humanity together. A people, a nation, or a religion without stories to tell or the means to tell them is a people, nation, or religion doomed to the dustbin of history. We cannot survive without them without losing our sanity.\n\nOne key story we tell over and over again throughout time and across the planet is the most basic and simple of ones. It is the story of fight or flight that so dominates our reactions to phenomena in nature. Are you friend or are you foe? The need to decide is quick since one’s life may hang in the balance.\n\nThis story becomes generalized into another either/or story of the one between the forces of light and the forces of darkness – the story of the triumph over adversity, the story of victory against the odds, the story of success where death and defeat stared us in the face. The stories take various forms and shapes depending on time, place, and culture but they all share basic characteristics because we are all human beings living on the planet earth. From Gilgamesh to Katniss Everdeen, from the Exodus to Frodo, from the Book of Revelation to Star Wars, we sing the song that we shall overcome someday and that the world will be a better place for this.\n\nSometimes, such faith in the future is more difficult to sustain. A recent article begins with “‘Get off of my plane,’ growls the president of the United States to a terrorist hijacker in the 1997 movie ‘Air Force One,’ before snapping the enemy’s neck and shoving him out the cargo door” (“Skittish Over Terrorism, Some Voters Seek a Gutsy Style of Leader,” NYT 12/3/15). This is a great scene of triumph pre-9/11 that enables us to feel good again for its money we had and peace we lacked. We enjoy that scene and the one when the bad guy is gunned down just as he thinks he is leaving the Russian prison to wreak havoc on the world. Gotcha, you son of a bitch. We defeated you in the heavens and we defeated you on the ground.\n\nThe same scenario plays out in “Independence Day,” also cited in the article (sequel coming soon to a theater near you). Once again, a president rises to the occasion demonstrating the right stuff to go into the arena and emerge victorious having kept us safe from the alien threat. There is a stirring speech on the ground and then the president takes to air because that is where he belongs. Once again the forces of darkness are defeated in the heavens and on the earth. The mother ship explodes and “Joe America” pounds the daylights out of one alien who crash-landed. Get off of my planet.\n\nAs the article notes, our cerebral President, who is an American-born Christian, lacks the right stuff to make us feel safe at the visceral level. He didn’t campaign to be commander in-chief and leader of the free world nor did we want such a president then. Times have changed. “We haven’t heard a lot about Ronald Reagan’s city on a hill” commented Hugh Hewitt in the recent Republican presidential debate.\n\nJessica Stern, co-author of ISIS: The State of Terror, wrote: “We are not used to living [amid] such bewildering uncertainty… We feel vulnerable in many different places where we used to feel safe….” (“How Terror Hardens Us,” NYT 12/6/15).\n\nIn such times of uncertainty we are more likely to grasp for straws. Maria Konnikova, author of The Confidence Game: Why We Fall For It… Every Time, writes about “a deep need to believe in a version of the world where everything really is for the best – at least when it comes to us” (NYT 12/6/15). Or as Daniel Sullivan, a professional cult infiltrator, said, “When people want to believe what they want to believe, they are very hard to dissuade….(H)uman nature is wired toward creating meaning out of meaningless.” The much-reviled Common Core asks teachers through the use of primary sources to inspire curiosity, to form and craft arguments, to construct knowledge based on our evaluations and to communicate the conclusions. No wonder there is such opposition to it, that is exactly what presidential candidates and their cult followers don’t do.\n\nThe more uncertain the times, the more the denial of the truth. The more uncertain the times, the more effective the skilled con artist in exploiting the frailties of an individual. The more uncertain the times the more willing we are to accept truthiness as the standard. Nobody thinks they are joining a cult according to Daniel Sullivan but Rodhamites, Trumpies, and Carsonists have drunk the kool aid. “Tell me the story I want to hear. Who cares about anything else?”\n\n“Trump’s supporters don’t particularly care whether he’s lying or not. Our brain\n\ndoesn’t really care…. All of us, Republicans, Democrats, we are all afflicted with\n\nthis inclination to believe what we believe, and it doesn’t matter what the facts\n\nsay …. we don’t want the truth. We want our version of the truth.” (Rick\n\nShenkman, editor of History News Network, in “Your Brain Is Hard-\n\nWired to Love Trump,” Politico, 12/16/15,\n\nhttp://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/12/donald-trump-2016-evolutionary-psychology-213444\n\nHistory pays a price for this. The study of history is not immune from the surrounding cultural experiences. The image of the ivory tower scholar is a myth in its own right. What we want now in history is the story that makes us feel good.\n\n“There is an endless controversy about whether the Americans ever reached the\n\nMoon with the Apollo spacecraft,” wrote blogger Vitaly Egorov, one the founders\n\nof a crowdfunded Moon mission organized by Russian engineers (“Proving the\n\nMoon Landing, One Ruble at a Time,” Russia Beyond the Headlines, 11/25/15).\n\nConsider the current situation at Amherst College. The issue is Lord Jeffrey Amherst after whom the college in named. During the American Revolution, this British commander championed what today would be considered germ warfare. Here it’s not just a flag or a monument but the very identity of the college itself that is called into question. The college has become another battlefront in the war of identity politics that continues to divide the country into ever smaller fragments at war with each other. The Amherst controversy led to a response from an alum from 1965, the time when all was calm and peaceful on college campuses: “The trouble is that diversity in and of itself doesn’t really do anybody much good if separate little groups come to Amherst to study their own particular points of interest and they don’t talk to each other. As alumni, many of us have tried to encourage the college to try to bring common intellectual ground, so when you leave college, you leave not just with nostalgia and friendship, but with sense of common intellectual interest” (Paul Roxin, quoted in “With Diversity Comes Intensity in Amherst Free-Speech Debate,” NYT 11/29/15). To many alumni, the goal of the protesters is to erase history and not to understand it. “We sterilize history by eliminating the mascot [Lord Jeff]…We’re not proud of the story. But we live with history unaltered, to avoid repeating it,” posted William H. Scott.\n\nWhat’s so great about having a common intellectual interest at a college anyway? We’re not one college. Why should Americans share a common national narrative? We’re not one country. Why should a local history museum tell a shared story of the area from the Ice Age to Global Warming? We’re not one community. Why can’t there be separate histories for each group? Shouldn’t history museums tailor their stories to each identity group the way politicians do? Shouldn’t every group have their own story that makes them happy? Shouldn’t slavery exhibits be banished or require trigger warnings because precious child of all ages will be traumatized if they see them? If presidential candidates can lie, fabricate, have no curiosity, and be superficial, shouldn’t history museums be able to do the same?\n\nWe are not the first to raise such questions. Psychologist Seymour Epstein said, “It is no accident that the Bible, probably the most influential Western book of all times, teaches through parables and stories and not through philosophical discourse.” One such story is of the Tower of Babel. Once upon a time everyone spoke the same language. Then they didn’t. Creating a shared narrative was no longer possible. Getting a mixed multitude to enter into a covenant was a challenge. Getting a melting pot to constitute itself as a people is an ongoing ordeal.\n\nIn American history there was a time when we divided, when people read the same source documents and derived opposite conclusions, when hundreds of thousands died, and when the united States weren’t the United States. Our president spoke of malice towards none, words no presidential candidate would dare utter today. Our president spoke of what “our fathers” had brought forth four-score and seven years earlier, sentiments no presidential candidate would dare express today. Our president spoke of the world little noting and not long remembering what we say here, words that certainly apply to our presidential candidates today who don’t dare utter the name Lincoln.\n\nStrangely enough the one person on the national level who has dared to embrace the message of Lincoln isn’t a politician but an artist, Lin-Manuel Miranda whom I first wrote about in April 2012. With Lincoln at Gettysburg, the American Revolution was reborn. Now with Hamilton it has been reborn again. Miranda has demonstrated the curiosity, research, and honesty in his biography and storytelling that is missing from the candidates with their algorithms that target us by our hyphens. Candidates may see his show but they don’t express his vision. So to the history museums located throughout the communities of this country, when you think of the shared narrative to tell about your community and our country, think of Hamilton and not our presidential candidates.\n\nSan Bernadino Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik clearly were executed in\n\norder to blame Pakistan for the crime.

I now live in Catskill, but when I was still a Saugertesian I attempted an idle late-night Internet search for “Saugerties” in the splendid American Memory collection of the Library of Congress. Of the twenty-five hits, ten were linked to nineteenth-century song sheets about murders and riots and prize fights by the otherwise nameless “Saugerties Bard.” The game was afoot; I had to find out more.\n\nAs it turned out, the life story of the Bard, an itinerant folklorist named Henry Sherman Backus, has itself taken on folkloric dimensions: what was strictly factual has become jumbled up with romantic twaddle, especially around his melancholic demise. It seemed to me that the songs, early on dismissed as doggerel, were very good indeed and more worthy of attention than the composer. What was his place in the long tradition of balladry and broadside, the people’s press? Was he, like Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie, a moralist in musician’s clothing? Or was he a mere entertainer and narcissist, a Catskills comic before his time? Read on. The verses interspersed below are from the Saugerties Bard’s ballad, “The Murdered Pedlar,” printed in Catskill in 1854.\n\nOn Friday, August 19, 1853, Hiram Williams, an itinerant peddler of German-Jewish origins, was on the first leg of his journey home to 113 Walker Street in New York City. He had completed a successful tour of the villages of Ulster and Greene counties, during which he had sold one hundred dollars worth of jewelry and lace. Arriving in Greenville too late to make the Austin Line stage coach to Coxsackie, he was prepared to wait for the next one until he crossed paths with an inebriated thirty-year-old alumnus of Sing Sing prison, who had likewise missed a stage from Albany to Durham and was walking east.\n\nOn the Plank-Road, in Greenville town,\n\nA Jewish Pedlar was shot down.\n\nAh, by a wretch, called Warren Wood,\n\nWho shot the Pedlar in cold blood.\n\nWith murder rankling in his heart\n\nFrom the Empire City did depart,\n\nArm’d with revolver, six-barrel’d true,\n\nWith which he shot the peddling Jew.\n\nIn a statement the mortally wounded Williams was able to give while clinging to life, he said that his assailant had come up to him and, after some perfunctory repartee, said, “You are a foolish fellow to take the stage; if you walk down with me, we can get there before the stage does, and you will save your money.” Persuading the peddler to stop at taverns along the way on this hot summer’s day, Warren Wood inquired how much money the peddler typically made on such a trip. “I said sometimes one, and sometimes two hundred dollars; as we came near the bridge, about half way down the hill, Wood stepped back, and I saw him pull a pistol from his pocket; he fired it and shot me down; the ball entered my back, and passed through my body, so that the doctor took it out of my abdomen; he shot again, twice, striking me about the head; I fell on the road, and he took me by the legs and threw me off the bridge and threw down my pack; he then dragged me to one corner, under the bridge, and asked me what I had in my small box, and I told him nothing but spectacles; he then threw stones on me, and went away.” (“Greene County,” 1853).\n\nWhen first he shot, the Pedlar cried,\n\nWhate’er you want shall be supplied.\n\nHis pocket-book to Wood he gave,\n\nIn hopes by this his life to save.\n\nAgain he shot! O, cruel man!\n\nWhat mortal can your feelings scan.\n\nInfernal spirits astonish’d stood,\n\nAwhile to gaze on Warren Wood,\n\nWho did the Pedlar’s head then pound\n\nAs he lay bleeding on the ground,\n\nUntil he thought him truly dead,\n\nAnd then the monster quickly fled.\n\nIn an affidavit following his capture in New York City, Wood admitted he had shot Williams “two or three times” but denied other seemingly less pertinent details. “The peddler handed me his pocket-book; I never asked him for it; neither did I pile any stones on him, or ill-use him. If he went off the bridge, he must have fell off himself; I did not throw him off.” Tossing his revolver into a swamp, after which he “felt somewhat easier,” Wood paid a local farmer the large sum of “one gold dollar, a fifty cent piece and two quarter dollars” to drive him to Catskill Point. From there he crossed the Hudson, took the train to Tivoli, and then the express to New York, where he arrived near midnight that same Friday (“Greene County,” 1853).\n\nIn Gotham he hooked up with his paramour, Emma, who noted that he had more money at hand than was usual; on Saturday, with the ill-gotten gain, they visited the Great Exhibition of Art and Industry at the Crystal Palace—on the site of today’s New York Public Library—which had opened its doors to the public barely a month earlier, and a Daguerrean parlor where the capture of Emma’s likeness was to aid in the capture of her lover. When Wood was apprehended in New York, he had among his possessions several items that indisputably belonged to the peddler. Hauled back upstate, before being incarcerated at the Catskill jail, he was brought before the dying Williams, who could not be moved from his bed at Moore’s Tavern near Greenville.\n\nBack to New York he sped his way,\n\nTo promenade with Ladies gay.\n\nIn Cherry Street they did him take:\n\nHe now his pleasure must forsake.\n\nThough filled with dread and guilty fear,\n\nBefore the Pedlar must appear,\n\nThou art the man, the pedlar said,\n\nAs he then raised his dying head.\n\nI know that coat, the boots likewise—\n\nA dying man will tell no lies,\n\nTo Jail the murderer then was sent,\n\nHis awful crimes there to lament.\n\nHiram Williams died on September 2 and was buried after services at the Albany synagogue. The charge against Wood was no longer for attempted murder. In the trial that took place on November 25, he was convicted and sentenced to hang on January 20, 1854. In between those two milestones in Wood’s wretched life, a ballad was printed in the job shop of the Greene County Whig. That ballad, quoted throughout this article, was composed by Henry Sherman Backus, a sometime Saugerties resident who may have felt an affinity for Williams, as he too was an itinerant peddler, although his pack was filled with songs rather than notions. Publishing under the pen name of the Saugerties Bard, Backus specified that “The Murdered Pedlar” was to be sung to the tune of “Burns’ Farewell,” an air of distant times that was known to anyone who had spent a bit of time in a saloon or roadhouse. Though an accomplished musician who accompanied his recitations with fiddle and fife, Backus never composed original music for the ballads he published, as the convention in the ballad business, unlike the bustling sheet music trade, was to supply buyers with lyrics to tunes they already knew.\n\nIn Christ, the Saviour of mankind,\n\nRepentance he may truly find:\n\nO, soon he will suspended be,\n\nTo pay the law’s just penalty.\n\nA faithful Jury did convict,\n\nThe Sheriff must the law inflict,\n\nThe penalty to justice due,\n\nTo all the guilty, as to you.\n\nNo costly gems or diamonds bright,\n\nDisarms the law or aids his flight,\n\nNor thousand tons of shining gold,\n\nYet for a groat Wood’s life was sold.\n\nNo more, poor man, while here you stay,\n\nThe birds will chaunt their cheering lay,\n\nOr friendly neighbors greet again\n\nThe wretch that hath the Pedlar slain.\n\nOn January next, the twentieth day,\n\nThe Sheriff must the law obey,\n\nUpon the gallows him suspend,\n\nAnd thus poor Wood his life will end.\n\nLet all a solemn warning take,\n\nAnd every wicked way forsake,\n\nFor soon we all will ush’rd be\n\nInto a vast eternity.\n\nOn the day that he was appointed to meet his Maker, only twenty minutes before being led to the Catskill jail’s rigged-up gallows, Wood made a long and rambling statement, the essence of which was that yes, he shot the peddler, but he didn’t know what he was doing or why. Then he attacked the integrity of his attorney, the officers who arrested him in New York, a reporter for the New York Herald, and one other: “A man from Saugerties has written some verses about me, and they have been published by the publishers of the Green[e] County Whig, and circulated over the country at sixpence apiece. I want to ask one question, and that is, if a man in my situation is not entitled to sympathy, rather than to be held up to ridicule and abused in that way? . . . Those degraded, low, mean, miserable verses are not worthy of the respect of any man, and I am sorry that anyone claiming responsibility [by which he meant the editor of the Whig], should suffer his press to give to the public such verses, and shamefully abuse me.” Mr. Ward, the editor, concluded his story of the execution and the strange scenes preceding it with Wood “suspended by the neck until he was dead. His body hung fifteen minutes, when it was taken down, placed in the coffin, and conveyed in front of the jail, where the spectators might view it. The body was buried about 2 o’clock, in the village burial yard” (“Execution of W,” 1854).\n\nThe brutal detail is offered here because life was more short and brutish then, with death and retribution the stuff of everyday concourse and consequently grist for ballads and folklore, too. Murder, disaster, tragedy, and sorrow were the stock in trade of the Saugerties Bard. Henry Backus was beginning to earn a reputation as a folk balladist, an honored practitioner of the people’s press that links seventeenth-century one-sheets and broadsides to nineteenth-century penny dreadfuls and dime novels, on up to story songsters Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Bob Dylan. Backus was perhaps a better social historian than he was a poet, but he was a master of brevity, able to tell a story that would go straight to the heart in a way that myriad columns in the newspaper could not. While ballads have traditionally been about the proximity of the rose and the briar—love and death—the Saugerties Bard found his calling in the briar patch, perhaps because life had strewn few roses in his path. His existence, which commenced on February 4, 1798, in Coxsackie, New York, has been festooned with so many garlands of whimsy if not outright fakery that it is difficult to separate the man from the myth. His death on May 20, 1861, followed by a pauper’s burial in Saugerties, concludes a tale so sad that it is a pity Backus himself could not have used it as a subject. In between those dates, he endured the death of his father in the War of 1812, became a schoolteacher, wed, had children, buried his wife and one of his children, became estranged from the others, and spent some time in the insane asylum in Hudson (today that city’s public library).\n\nIt is a life worth recounting in brief, but engaging as it may be, the romantic figure of this balladist—a combination of poet, moralist, entertainer, lunatic, and huckster— has received more attention from this century’s observers than the ballads themselves. The Saugerties Bard has become equal parts folklorist and folklore.\n\nComposing sad songs about murderers and their victims, he pandered to the public’s taste for sensationalism with a winking touch of piety. As John Wesley is said to have grumbled before setting down his five directions for singing hymns, “It’s a pity that Satan should have all the best tunes” (Lomax 1934, vii).\n\nAs time wore on, the life of Henry Sherman Backus became less eventful and his balladry more so—and arguably more proficient as well. With his Saugerties family falling away from him in the 1850s he beat a path south to New York City, where he composed some of his most notable works. In the latter half of that decade he wrote ballads about famous murders (for example, the unfortunate Dr. Burdell and his scheming wife), riots (notably the July 4, 1857, fracas involving the Dead Rabbits, Plug Uglies, and Bowery Boys, brought to screen in Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York), and executions, especially those of the antisocial lad James Rodgers and my personal favorite, the “pirate” Albert Hicks. Some of the Saugerties Bard’s ballads, notably “Uncle Sam’s Farm” and “The Dying Californian,” have conventionally been assigned to other pens, but nineteenth-century writers gave credit to Backus. Full lyrics survive for most of them, as do MIDI versions of the tunes or—in a handful of cases—newly recorded versions.\n\nBackus was something of an entrepreneur, paying job printers to run off his ballads, then selling them from his pack as he roamed from town to town. He even produced a now exceedingly scarce Ulster County Almanac for 1855, which he promoted with an advertisement in the Saugerties Telegraph: “[It] contains besides a good calendar some of the best effusions of the author. The bard will present it to the inspection of the public as soon as issued and probably sing most of the ballads as he is wont to do, accompanied by instrumental music. The approach of the Almanac will be announced by music from fiddle and flute” (qtd. in Jones 1942, 141).\n\nBenjamin Myer Brink, in his Early History of Saugerties, wrote in 1902: “All through the counties of Ulster and Greene, at least, was he well known in the years from 1835 to 1860; and often was he seen all down the Hudson River valley, and even upon the streets of New York, and westward along the Mohawk he had occasionally wandered, and into Canada. He was harmless, eccentric, impulsive, and at times incoherent, with a faculty for impromptu rhyming. . . . The writer can see him now pass by, clad in a suit of gray, with long gray locks covered with a cap.” (310–1)\n\nLouis C. Jones offered another view forty years later: “Although Backus died in 1861 a few old people in the Saugerties area still cherish him among their earliest memories. Mr. J. H. Kerbert, a bard himself, recalled him with remarkable clearness. I have in my possession a drawing made from memory by Mr. Kerbert, which shows Backus in his big hat, with long hair, grizzled beard, pegleg, and cane” (1942, 140).\n\nBut how did this son of Greene County become the bard of Saugerties, in Ulster County? This has been a mystery that eases a bit through genealogical research—only recently simplified by the digitization of federal, state, and local records—yet is by no means settled. Henry’s father, Electus Mallory Backus (1765–1813), and mother, Sabra Judson Backus (1764–1838), had both been born in Connecticut, where they wed in 1784. They relocated to West Camp, New York, sometime before 1787, and thence to Coxsackie. Of their eleven children, all but one lived to adulthood and married—so Henry, the seventh, would enjoy a cornucopia of nieces and nephews, a fact difficult to gibe with his later solitary life and death.\n\nElectus Mallory Backus was a military man by election, before the outbreak of war in 1812. Commissioned as major of the First Light Dragoons in October 1808, he would die in action at Sackett’s Harbor in June 1813. (For decades thereafter Sabra Backus petitioned Congress unsuccessfully to provide her with a widow’s pension.) Henry’s younger brother Electus Jr. would also become a military man, matriculating at West Point and serving with distinction in the Mexican and Civil Wars. According to Brink, Henry too “grew to manhood with a passion for what concerns a soldier. He possessed a peculiarly correct ear for martial music, and in early years was an efficient teacher of the fife, the drum, and the bugle. Later he taught school, and coming to Saugerties he married a Miss Legg, with whom he lived for a number of years. After her death his mind received a peculiar bias and he began to lead the life of a wandering minstrel” (1902, 312).\n\nAccording to Pauline Hommell, a Saugerties schoolteacher and historian who wrote an anecdote-laden profile of Backus in her 1958 volume Teacup Tales, Miss Legg was an orphan. In Hommell’s ghostly tale “The Face at the Window,” she contrives this comment from Cornelis [Cornelius] Post to Backus, recently arrived in Saugerties to accept a position as schoolteacher: “‘You’ve been seeing our neighbor’s cousin, Alida Legg. Ach, but she is good to feast one’s eyes on” (1958, 34). Hommell was not above inventing dialogue and spooky stories, but I do not suspect her to have been a fabricator of basic fact. Katsbaan Church records show that an Alida was born to Lodewijk Smit [Anglicized as Lodowick Smith in the 1800 census] and Neeltje Post on March 3, 1799, and when she was baptized seventeen days later, her sponsors were William Legg and Debora Post. Born to Alida’s parents five years earlier had been Debora Smit, sponsored by Petrus Post and Debora Post (Katsbaan Church records, entries 1830 and 2203). According to Hommell, Alida wed Henry in the early 1820s and died in May 1845, although Teacup Tales makes no mention of children.\n\nOther sources give Mrs. Backus the name Eliza or Ann Eliza—possibly Anglicizations, possibly a confusion with Henry’s older sister Eliza. Alida/Eliza is also given a maiden name of Legg, which she might well have taken upon her adoption. In the 1830 census the age of Henry “Baccus” of Saugerties is listed as over thirty but under forty. He has one daughter older than five but younger than ten. His wife is listed as over twenty but under thirty, close enough to the truth and perhaps flattering. Burial records of Mountain View Cemetery show that their daughter Sara Ann died June 6, 1830, at the age of one year and twelve days (Poucher and Terwilliger 1931). In the 1840 census Backus, still residing in Saugerties, presides over a household of six females: two daughters under five, two more between five and ten, another between fifteen and twenty, and his wife. Yet in the 1850 census, he shares an abode only with laborer Abraham Wing, age fifty-eight; he himself is listed with no profession. At some point in the 1840s he is said to have spent time in the lunatic asylum in Hudson. The likely dispersal of his daughters to other homes following his commitment or the death of his wife might have driven any man to despair; it sent Henry Backus on the road.\n\nSo may we conclude that the Saugerties Bard’s odd demeanor was born of trauma? Or might it have been at least in some measure calculated? In The Catskills Alf Evers wrote, “Local eccentrics found the [Catskill] Mountain House an irresistible target and they often served to brighten a dull day. Among them was Henry Backus, ‘the Saugerties Bard, a Cosmopolitan, a Travelling Minstrel,’ as he was inscribed on the hotel register. Backus sang songs he composed and sold printed copies of them to guests. He put together a Mountain House ballad in 1856” (1972, 458). Clearly eccentricity was a solid marketing tactic then as now; Backus may have been the Tiny Tim of his day, ridiculed by his audience but laughing all the way to the bank. Certainly his mind was sufficiently composed to produce lyrics that generally scanned and always told a story.\n\nReviewing his list of songs, it is clear that the “Catskill Mountain House Ballad,” printed June 30, 1856, marked very nearly the end of Henry Backus’s rural phase. His brother Electus had been installed as the army’s superintendent of general recruiting services at Fort Columbus on Governor’s Island in New York harbor. He and his brother had seen little of each other for decades, but the Saugerties Bard nevertheless boldly headed south to the city of lights and shadows. In the four years remaining to him he would publish at least fifteen (and perhaps many more) ballads with the three prolific New York song-sheet publishers, Andrews, Wrigley, and De Marsan. Indeed, no one knows precisely how many song sheets, slip ballads, and poetical broadsides the Saugerties Bard may have composed or published, and additional ones may yet be identified, especially those that may have been printed in newspapers but not distributed as broadsides.\n\nLiving in New York and Hoboken, Backus, nearing the age of sixty, did some of his best work. There were the songs about famous riots (“The Great Police Fight [Riot at City Hall], June 15, 1857”), boxing matches (the 156-round affair celebrated in “Bradley & Rankin’s Prize Fight for $1000 a Side”), and especially notorious villains such as Mrs. Cunningham (“Dr. Burdell, or the Bond Street Murder”), Francis Gouldy (“Heart Rending Tragedy”), and my favorite murderer, Albert W. Hicks (“Hicks the Pirate”), the man who for a few months pushed Abe Lincoln and secessionist rumbling off the front page.\n\nHicks was a waterfront thug, not a pirate, who in March 1860 was drugged by a rival gang member and woke up to find himself “shanghaied” onto the oyster sloop E. A. Johnson and bound for Virginia. Knowing from past practice just what to do, he murdered the entire crew—the skipper Captain Burr and the brothers Watts—with an axe, gathered up their clothing and valuables, and threw them overboard. Managing the sloop badly as he turned it back toward New York, he collided with the schooner J. R. Mather, outbound for Philadelphia. Hicks lowered a boat piled high with his victims’ belongings and made for shore at Staten Island. When the wrecked E. A. Johnson was brought ashore awash in blood, Hicks’s day of reckoning neared. Chased from New York to Providence, Hicks was apprehended, tried on federal charges of piracy on the high seas, and won a nickname that he took to his grave … and beyond.\n\nThere would be no schoolboy mewling for this hardened criminal who, with a twentyfirst- century sense of commerce, hired a writer to make his confession suitably bloodcurdling to sell to a publisher, with the proceeds to go to his widow. This will give the picture: “I have killed men, yes, and boys too, many a time before, for far less inducement than the sum I suspected I should gain by killing them; and I had too often dyed my murderous hands in blood in days gone by, to feel the slightest compunctions or qualms of conscience then” (“Execution of H,” 1860). Ah, they don’t write ’em like that today, and more’s the pity!\n\nConvicted of the triple murder, Hicks was slated for execution on July 13, 1860, at a gallows constructed on Bedloe’s Island (also known as “Gibbet Isle”) out in the harbor, where the Statue of Liberty has stood since 1886. His procession from jail to gallows took on the aspect of a circus, and a general holiday atmosphere prevailed. Excursion boats had been lined up beforehand for the twelve thousand spectators (a New York Times estimate) to have a memorable outing: “HO! FOR THE EXECUTION” read the headline on one classified ad (1860). Peanut vendors and lemonade stands did a brisk business to the beat of the fife and drum. The thirsty “imbibed lager-beer,” reported the Times, and in rowboats there were “ladies, no, females of some sort, shielding their complexion from the sun with their parasols, while from beneath the fringe and the tassels they viewed the dying agonies of the choking murderer” (“Execution of H,” 1860).\n\nSoon after Hicks was buried, grave robbers stole his body, spawning a long-standing rumor that he had somehow defeated the hangman and was running around wreaking havoc under an alias. In fact, his body had been sold to medical students. Within months of the hanging, P. T. Barnum’s American Museum featured a wax image of Hicks among its other notorious figures. The Great Showman’s newspaper ad described his sundry marvels (“Amusements,” 1861):\n\nNot these alone attention draw; Figures in wax are found;\n\nClassic and modern; Christian Sage and heathen of renown;\n\nAll characters whose names have a very familiar sound.\n\nA Mummy here, a Judas there—a “Tommy” done up brown;\n\nA John Brown or an Albert Hicks—a Lambert and his wife.\n\nThe Siamese Twins and Albert Guelph—all true to life.\n\n“Hicks the Pirate,” the Saugerties Bard’s ballad published right after the hanging, marked the end of a tradition. Songs about solo murderers would soon pale before the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of our best in blue and gray. The young Henry Backus had not embraced the military as his father and brother had done; he would not do so now. Out of fashion and perhaps increasingly addlepated, he headed back north. “During the winter,” according to Brink, “he was hardly seen” (1902, 314).\n\nOn Monday, May 13, 1861, Backus slept in an old shed in Katsbaan outside a hotel maintained by James H. Gaddis, who found him the following morning, emaciated and unconscious. The Bard was taken to the village of Saugerties, where he was fed, charged with vagrancy, and taken to Kingston’s jail. There he lingered unattended until he died on May 20. His body was given a pine-coffin burial in Saugerties. Few members of his extensive family had stood by him in life; none now came in death. His remains were placed, in Pauline Hommell’s aptly chosen words, “into the six-foot cavity which is the common portion of all the sons of Adam” (1958, 37).\n\nSongs of the Saugerties Bard\n\nThe Powder Mill Explosion at Saugerties, New York. 1847.\n\nThe Dying Californian. ca. 1850.\n\nUncle Sam’s Farm.

So many tales lurk herein, but let’s focus briefly on Tin Pan Alley, a neighborhood centered on West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Known for the large collection of songwriters and publishers who congregated in the area, as Don Jensen has written in “A Base Ball Krank’s Guide to Madison Square” (Base Ball: A Journal of the Early Game, 2014):\n\n[Tin Pan Alley] dominated popular music in the United States from the 1890s to the 1920s. (The name may have derived from a reference by Harry Von Tilzer in the New York Herald to the sound made by the thin, tinny tone quality of the cheap pianos [offered] in music publishers’ offices.) …. George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin, along with many others, began their careers on the “Street of Songs.” But other kinds of businesses also practiced their trades there. In addition to Miss Flippeny’s, the building at 57 West 28th was a gambling den. For a time during the 1890s, Thomas Edison’s office for moving pictures was at No. 43, where he reportedly shot film on the roof. The New York Clipper, America’s first newspaper devoted to sports and entertainment, including baseball, had its offices at No. 47, not far from the William Morris Talent Agency (though the Clipper’s original offices were downtown).\n\nTin Pan Alley will be found on no map of New York City streets, but Tin Pot Alley, whose existence clearly was invoked by the music folk. Running from 59 Greenwich to 91 Trinity Place, it was the former name of Exchange Alley and was also known as Oyster Pasty Alley. This name was commonly applied to a locality on the shore of the North river, opposite the present Exchange Place. A fortification at the end of this small lane, leading from Broadway west (now a part of Exchange Place) was known as the “Pasty Mount.” Charles Hemstreet wrote, in Nooks and Crannies of Old New York (1899):\n\nThere is a rift in the walls between the tall buildings at No. 55 Broadway, near Rector Street, a cemented way that is neither alley nor street. It was a green lane before New Amsterdam became New York, and for a hundred years has been called Tin Pot Alley. With the growth of the city the little lane came near being crowded out, and the name, not being of proper dignity, would be forgotten but for a terra cotta tablet fixed in a building at its entrance. This was placed there by Rev. Morgan Dix, the pastor of Trinity Church.\n\nJensen observed that while Tin Pan Alley was always a place though never in one location, “a commemorative plaque is embedded on the sidewalk on East 29th Street just east of Broadway, where it is mostly unnoticed except perhaps for street vendors, pedestrians, and construction workers trying to restore the neighborhood to its former gritty charm.”\n\nJackson Avenue was the former name of University Place.\n\nJackson Place was an alley which ran north from No. 16 Downing St.; now called Downing Place.\n\nJauncey Lane was a country road which started between 93rd and 94th Sts., just west of West End Ave., and ran easterly crossing 8th Ave. at 94th St. and ending at the Eastern Post Road; about the present line of 96th St. between 5th and 6th Aves.\n\nJauncey Court was in the rear of Nos. 37, 39 and 41 Wall St. Jew’s Alley was the former name of South William St. Jew’s Alley was the former name of South William St. between Broad Street and Mill Lane.\n\nJew’s Alley formerly ran from Madison St. between Oliver and James Sts.\n\nJone’s Court was in the rear of Nos. 48.

Let me tell you one, which may be my favorite–about Raisin Street–and maybe also another, regarding the original Murderers’ Row–no, it did not start with the 1927 Yankees. This will be a longish post, even after breaking it out into two segments, so as not make street search utterly maddening. Of course many streets have been renamed, usually in tandem with a prior name (52nd Street, or rather a portion of it, a.k.a. “Swing Street”) .\n\nFirst,Raisin Street: Originally dubbed Reason Street, after Thomas Paine’s The Age of Reason; between Bleecker and Bedford Sts.; name changed in 1828. New York’s accent is said to have transformed Reason Street into Raison Street–over time altered further and even written as Raisin Street. It seems to me, though, that both names must have coexisted, as Paine left America for France to aid in the French Revolution, and raison is the French word for reason. Trinity Church, which owned land along the street, was unhappy about this commemoration of the free-thinking “atheistic” Paine–who certainly recognized a Supreme Being–and got the street renamed for Thomas Barrow, an artist whose 1776 drawing of Trinity’s great fire was very popular. Below is an 1861 lithograph by George Hayward, based on Barrow’s drawing made on the spot.\n\nSecond, Murderers’ Row: The usual etymology for this term is plausible–that it derives from a row of cells in New York’s Tombs reserved for the most dastardly of criminals. This passage from Meyer Berger’s The Eight Million: Journal of a New York Correspondent (Columbia University Press, 1983), while not a contemporary description, does testify to a separate domicile for murderers.\n\nThere were four tiers of cells. Convicted prisoners had the ground floor and those awaiting trial had the other three; murderers occupied the second, burglars and arsonists the third, and minor offenders the fourth. Homeless children seven and eight years old were thrown into cells with prostitutes, alcoholics, and cutpurses.\n\nYet this fact gleaned from Charles A. Hemstreet’s Nooks and Crannies of Old New York (Scribner, 1899) may give pause: Murderers’ Row was an actual alley long before the Civil War, starting where Watts Street ended at Sullivan Street, midway along the block between Grand and Broome Streets. Now part of the fashionable Soho district, Murderers’ Row was one of many mean streets in the neighborhood later known as Darktown–as the Chinese had Chinatown and the Jews had Jewtown (yes, that was what they called the Lower East Side in the years before 1900; and there was a “Jew’s Alley,” which ran from Madison St. between Oliver and James Streets).\n\nThe alley that Hemstreet called “Murderers’ Row” existed in 1827 and was called “Otter’s-alley” in James Hardie’s Description of the City of New York, which was printed and published in that year by Samuel Marks, 63 Vesey Street. From this book I was also able to confirm that all the streets mentioned in Hemstreet had indeed been cut through: Sullivan, Watts, Grand, and Broome. The alley/row ran east-west, connecting Sullivan and Thompson Streets.\n\nThe sticking point: precisely when someone called this thoroughfare Murderers’ Row, in print, for the first time. Let me quote from Paul Dickson’s estimable Dictionary of Baseball Quotations (Facts on File, 1989):\n\nETY/1ST 1858. According to Bill Bryson in his April 1948 Baseball Digest article entitled ‘Why We Say It,’ the writer who first called the Ruth-Gehrig-Meusel-Lazzeri combo Murderers’ Row, ‘… probably drew praise from his boss for a “fresh, vibrant phrase.” He then points out, ‘Well, it had been used in a New York newspaper’s account of a game a few years before that–about seventy years in fact. The 1858 writer got it from the name given the isolated rows of cells containing dangerous criminals in the Tombs prison in New York.’ Edward J. Nichols concurs, pointing out in his dissertation that there is a clipping in Henry Chadwick’s Scrapbook from 1858 in which it was applied to a lineup of power hitters.\n\nBoy, I’d love to see that clip, as Chadwick abhorred the slugging style of play and is himself unlikely to have coined the term Murderers’ Row as a colorful approbation. Moreover, the Tombs opened for business in 1838 and the alley almost surely predates that year. My belief is that the Tombs sense of the phrase Murderers’ Row cannot be earlier than 1840, and that the alley-way provides an earlier usage.\n\nChecking an 1827 listing of street names, I found that Hemstreet’s location matched a street name: Otter’s Alley. As you will see in an entry below, “Otter’s Alley formerly ran from Thompson to Sullivan Sts. between Broome and Grand Sts.”–very nearly the same wording as in Hemstreet.\n\nEnough preamble; on with the show, from Valentine’s Manual of Old New York, 1923; No. 7, New Series; edited by Henry Collins Brown.\n\nSTREET NAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN CHANGED OR ARE NOW OBSOLETE IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, NEW YORK CITY—1922.\n\nBy George Henry Stegmann\n\nThe following information regarding Old New York Streets was obtained from the following sources:\n\nVALENTINE’S MANUAL — 1855; 1860; 1861; 1862; 1864; 1865; 1866.\n\nHaswell — Reminiscences of an Octogenarian.\n\nHill — Story of a Street (Wall Street).\n\nHistorical Guide to the City of New York — .\n\nInnes — New Amsterdam and its People.\n\nJenkins — The Greatest Street in the World.\n\nJenkins — The Old Boston Post Road.\n\nLossing — History of New York City.\n\nLamb — History of New York City.\n\nMott — New York City of Yesterday.\n\nPasko — New York Old and New.\n\nPost — Old Streets, Roads, Lanes, etc., of New York.\n\nRiker — History of Harlem.\n\nValentine — History of New York City.\n\nWilson — New York Old and New.\n\nPlan of the City of New York—\n\n1665, Duke’s Plan.\n\n1695.
