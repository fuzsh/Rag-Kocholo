        "text": "COXSACKIE, N.Y. -- A fire in Coxsackie destroys a local business.\n\n\"It's a total loss -- 100Â percent total loss,\" said Barry Rausch, Coxsackie fire chief.\n\n\"I said, 'what? Not that big old antique place!'\" saidÂ Charles Caldweil, a longtime Coxsackie resident.\n\nNothing more than a skeleton stands in the ashes of what was once the oldest continuous auction house in the Hudson Valley.\n\n\"It's been 70 years since I've been in this neck of the woods, but this building was still sitting there before I was even born, that's going back about 1944 when I was born,\"Â Caldweil said.\n\nBut fire officials said both the building's age, and the nature of its contents played a large role in how quickly the fire spread.\n\n\"There's no sprinkler system in it, it's an old wooden structure filled with a lot of items that can burn,\" saidÂ Rausch.\n\nWith no municipal water system nearby, the flames were more challenging to tackle.\n\n\"We had to call in tankers and use portable ponds, things like that. All that stuff just takes a little bit of time,\" Rausch said.\n\nNow the chief said fire officials have called in an excavator to demolish the little bit that's left.\n\n\"I just feel sorry for the guy that owns it. I'm just hoping he has some kind of insurance on the place to get it back in business again because I hate to see people lose a business,\" saidÂ Caldweil.\n\nFire officials said no one was inside at the time of the fire and there are no injuries. The cause of the fire is still under investigation."
