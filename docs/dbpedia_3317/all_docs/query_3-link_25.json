        "text": "You can catch hand, foot and mouth disease from contact with an infected person's:\n\ncoughing\n\nsneezing\n\nblisters\n\nmucus (sputum or phlegm)\n\nsaliva\n\npoo (faeces).\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease appears most often in warm weather — usually in the summer or early autumn.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is usually mild and lasts 3 to 7 days. Not everyone gets symptoms. Some adults have no symptoms but can still spread the virus.\n\nThe first symptoms are usually:\n\na fever\n\na general feeling of being unwell\n\na sore throat\n\nred spots on the tongue and mouth that develop into painful mouth ulcers.\n\nA day or 2 later, red spots can appear on:\n\nyour fingers\n\nthe backs or palms of your hands\n\nthe soles of your feet.\n\nSometimes the red spots can also appear on your bottom and groin. The spots may turn into small blisters. You can see pictures of the rash at DermNet.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease — Dermnet (external link)\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease can be confused with:\n\nchickenpox (but the chickenpox rash is all over the body)\n\ncold sores in a child’s mouth.\n\nYour usual doctor or healthcare provider can usually diagnose hand, foot and mouth disease by listening to your symptoms and looking at the rash.\n\nIf you are pregnant\n\nThe risk of infection during pregnancy is very low. If you are pregnant and do get hand, foot and mouth disease the risk of complications is also very low.\n\nBut if you catch the virus shortly before you give birth, the infection can be passed on to your pēpi (baby). Most babies born with hand, foot and mouth disease have only mild symptoms.\n\nIn very rare cases it is possible that catching hand, foot and mouth disease during pregnancy may result in miscarriage or could affect how your pēpi develops. If you have contact with hand, foot and mouth disease while you are pregnant, or if you develop any kind of rash, see your doctor or midwife.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease can be unpleasant, but it will usually clear up by itself within 7 to 10 days. There is no medicine to treat hand, foot and mouth disease.\n\nTo relieve the symptoms, you can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help reduce a fever. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice.\n\nDrink plenty of fluids. If you have a sore mouth, you might prefer eating plain, soft food that does not need lots of chewing.\n\nWhen to get medical advice\n\nYou should take your tamaiti (child) to a doctor or healthcare provider if they:\n\nare not drinking\n\nare weeing (passing urine) less than usual\n\nhave a high fever over 39°C, or for any fever in pepi (babies) less than 3 months old\n\nseem very sleepy.\n\nYou should see a doctor if you are pregnant and develop a rash.\n\nIf you are not sure what to do, call Healthline on 0800 611 116"
