        "text": "From Fred Rieck: \"The \"A.E.A.\" brickmark \"ties\" into Aaron E. Aldridge, a brick manufacturer located in Dutchess Junction. A.E.A. is listed in city directories as early as 1887. I can't tell you just when the A.E.A. marked brick actually came into production. A later, 1896 directory entry lists Aaron as being affiliated with Aldridge Brothers (a/k/a Aldridge Brothers & Company), also brick manufacturers - the brother likely being George L. Aldridge. Aldridge Bros. Co. is listed as early as 1890\n\nBricks marked A.B.C (the letter C having a unique segmented form), have been found comingled with ALDRIDGE scrap. There are several manufacturers that marked their brick with \"A B C\" making it difficult to ID them with out seeing the them.\"\n\n==========\n\n\"Daniel Aldridge resided in Mudhole, NY (which is now known as Roseton, NY). Daniel is thought to have moved to Newburgh, NY, sometime between 1810 and 1817, due to the fact that his wife was from there. One of his sons was Thomas Aldridge born in 1818 and died August, 1892. Thomas bought a farm near Fishkill Landing, NY in the fall of 1853 which later became the 'ABC' (Aldridge Brothers & Company) Brickyard in Dutchess Junction, NY.\" (SOURCE: Steven Blair Aldridge Family Home Page)\n\nThomas' son Aaron Ennis Aldridge was born on January 19, 1851 in Balmville, near Newburgh, NY. He worked with his father at the Dutchess Junction brickyard and when his father moved to Chelsea, Aaron took over. He became one of the leading figures in the brick industry, was president of the Thomas Aldridge Brick and Land Company and also served as vice-president of the Greater New York Brick Company. He was prominent as a manufacturer and still more so as a selling agent in New York City where he had offices in the Times Square Building. From there he handled the output of many yards along the river. He was recognized throughout the country as an authority on brick making and the brick market. He died in 1925 in Beacon, NY. (SOURCE: Sullivan, James, History of New York State, 1523-1927, [Vol. 6] 1873-1931.)\n\n==========\n\nFrom Sloops of The Hudson, by: William E. Verplanck and Moses W. Collyer, G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York & London, 1908:\n\n\"Among the sloops of Fishkill on Newburgh bay were the Commodore Jones, and the New Jersey, which were owned by the late Thomas Aldridge, who had extensive brickyards at Dutchess Junction.\"\n\n==========\n\nALDRIDGE bricks have been found at the Castle on Bannerman's Island. We found some great photos here, here and here.\n\n==========\n\nFor Our New DUTCHESS JUNCTION Page:\n\nCLICK HERE\n\nI was born in the Eastern Township of St. Christine, Quebec on September 8, 1908. I grew up on a farm with cows, horses, pigs, chickens and a few ducks and went to school in a one-room schoolhouse until the fifth grade. On August 26, 1926, I left from Windsor Station in Montreal to come to the United States. I took the milk train at 10:30AM and arrived in Troy at 5:30PM. I could speak no English. My brother, who was living in Watervliet, met me at the station. My uncle owned the Bleau Brick Co. in Watervliet and I started working there on Monday. My first job was to feed the horses and drive them to bring clay to the granulator. Because this brickyard had what was known as an âopen yardâ, it operated only in the late spring, summer, and early autumn. When the brickyard shut down for the winter, I went to work on Riberdyâs farm in Waterford. I milked cows, cleaned the barn, put corn in the silo, plowed land for the following spring, and chopped wood up on Shaker Road.\n\nI was back at the brickyard in the spring of 1927 driving horses to and from the granulator, earning $24 a week. That was âbig moneyâ then because I was making nothing back in Canada. I learned how to operate both a gas-powered shovel and a steam shovel. When the brickyard closed for the winter, my cousin offered me a job. I went to Berlin (east of Troy) and hauled logs out of the woods for $1 a cord. Sometime the snow was up to my butt, but I was young! After hauling the logs to the road, they were picked up by a truck and taken to the brickyard in Watervliet. Back then, wood was used to burn the kiln to fire the brick.\n\nIn the spring of 1928, I was put to work as a âmold pusherâ. A machine pushed through 19 molds a minute. Each mold contained 6 raw bricks and in a 7 hour shift, we made 43,000 bricks. The green bricks were put on drying racks before being fired. I hated this job, so I left the brickyard and went back to Canada for a visit. When I returned, I went to work at what was know as the âpoor houseâ (National Automotive Fibers) in Waterford; we tore apart old mattresses to make some type of insulation for automobiles. I worked there one winter and got laid off. In order to survive, a friend and I went to Massachusetts and found jobs in a lumber camp, chopping wood to make railroad ties. By now, it was the Depression, so I spent the next few years doing some work at the brickyard and chopping wood in the winter.\n\nI got married in 1934 and that first winter was very difficult. I was chopping wood in Cohoes, but that didnât bring in very much. My wife was earning $3 a week taking care of an elderly woman. By 1935, we were living on Main St. in Cohoes. I received word that my cousin wanted me back at the brickyard. I didnât have the money to take the trolley so for my first week I walked to and from Watervliet until I got paid. I then took the trolley until I had enough money to pay for the registration on my light blue 1933 Willys. I had saved a $20 bill all winter long in case one of us got sick. I still had the $20 bill.\n\nNow I was operating the steam shovel, which I liked very much. There was a medallion inside the cab as proof that I had passed the âsteam testâ. Unfortunately, I fell off the shovel and spent the rest of the summer in the hospital. In the fall, we moved to N. Erie Street. We were expecting our first child. In the spring of 1936, Mr. Bleau asked me to come back to the brickyard and drive the BIG TRUCK! I was so thankful to have a full-time job. I delivered brick everywhere â Schenectady, Gloversville, Amsterdam, North Adams, Lenox, Lee. Jack Gaudette and Billy Nadeau drove the smaller trucks for local deliveries. Later, Mr. Bleau brought the former Troy Brick in North Troy on Oil Mill Hill. That brickyard could operate all year long.\n\nDuring World War II, I worked night and day, some weeks 100 hours due to the manpower shortage. Most of the men who worked in the brickyard had been drafted: Billy Nadeau, Jack, Joe, Franklin Gaudette, Mickey, Guy, Oscar Gilbert, Richard, Wilfred and Lawrence Bleau. The only ones left were Gene and Joe St. Pierre and a few men from Mechanicville.\n\nBleau Brick could not make brick fast enough to meet the demand so we bought from a supplier in East Kingston. I would leave my home at 5AM to get to East Kingston. There, a crane operator would load the truck with 7,000 bricks. Then I drove to the Schenectady GE, dropped off that load and, by noon, was back in East Kingston for a second load. When I wasnât hauling brick to Schenectady, I was making trips to Pittsfield or Gloversville. Travel was on Routes 9, 7, or 20, the main roads of the day. After my regular workday, I would spend a few hours repairing machinery. I would get home about 4PM, eat supper, rest and go back at 6PM to tend the kiln with Joe Leclair. At midnight, Joe St. Pierre and Joe Ten Eyck took over tending the kiln, which burned 24 hours a day for 5 to 6 days.\n\nSome Sundays I went to 6AM Mass, then to the brickyard and loaded a railroad boxcar. By noon, the boxcar was loaded with 32,000 bricks. The load had to be spread the length of the boxcar, the weight balanced evenly over the wheels of the car so it wouldnât sag in the middle. I would toss 6 bricks at a time to Joe St.Pierre, who would then toss them to a man with a wheelbarrow who would unload his bricks into the boxcar. An unfired brick weighs 8 pounds but after being fired it weighs 6 pounds. So when I was tossing bricks, I was handling 36 pounds each time. I had muscles back then!\n\nWhen the veterans returned from service, we could make 43,000 bricks a day. I worked for Bleau Brick for almost 26 years. In 1952, I bought my own truck and became a tractor-trailer driver between Boston and Chicago.\n\nTom writes:\n\nThe Cook brick was found in October, 2008 in the demolition pile of a chimney of an old seasonal home built between 1878 and 1932. Both W. Barnstable and Cook brick were used in the chimney with fireplaces on both first and second floors. The second floor bricks were W. Barnstable brick and joined with a fine red cement while the first floor brick were Cook brick joined with a white cement. Both cements were exceptionally weak and just turned to powder. The majority of white cemented brick were not embossed or stamped with the Cook name. A good guess would be that there was one Cook embossed brick for every 100 non-embossed white cemented bricks. This is about the same frequency as embossed to non-embossed W. Barnstable red-cemented ones.\n\n(from an ad in \"The Bridgewater Book,\" 1899)\n\nThe small print:\n\n\"Member of Master Builders' Exchange, 166 Devonshire Street, Boston.\n\nOffice and Works : Five minutes' walk south of Titicut Station.

East Bridgewater is primarily a residential community centrally located in Plymouth County 14 miles northeast of Taunton, 22 miles northwest of Plymouth, 25 miles southeast of Boston, and 207 miles from New York City.\n\nFirst settled in 1630 as an outgrowth of the Plimoth and Duxbury plantation, the Town of East Bridgewater was an early industrial inland town located on the northern portion of the Taunton River system. Its early economy was based on agriculture but the community did have both grist and sawmills, iron forges and tanneries. The late 19th and early 20th century saw residential development along the trolley lines in the community.The Loucraft brickyard covered the area known in the 1600âs as the Devilâs Hop Yard, where early settlers had their homes. Joseph and his son razed about 10-12 feet of the area to extract clay for bricks. And they ran a boarding house, too, for lots of their Canadian labourers.\"\n\n(SOURCE:\n\nhttps://www.lucraft.org/2005/10/quebecois-family.html)\n\n==========\n\nBridgewater Brickyard Burned\n\nThe NY Times, July 2, 1898\n\n==========\n\nBrick production was Bridgewater's most prominent industry, and still is to this day. Established in 1886 and now with over 100 years of experience, the Stiles and Hart Brick Company remains the only brick manufacturer in Massachusetts.\n\nThe Stiles and Hart Conservation Area has the remains of the original brick factory as well as many piles of bricks scattered throughout the property. This 75-acre site was an agricultural fairground with a grand exhibition hall from c1820- 1875. In 1895, a local teacher, Mr. William Basset, Sr., purchased the land and founded the Bridgewater Brick Company. The company mined clay and produced bricks on the site. In 1913, Stiles & Hart Brick Company purchased the operation. Due damage to buildings in the hurricane of 1938, brick production ceased, but clay mining continued until after World War II. The site has been recommended as a National Register District by the Massachusetts Historical Commission.\n\nThe Cook Brick Company was located at the end of Cook Street (#127) in the south end of town. Today it is run by the Stiles and Heart Brick Company and is the last operational brick company in Massachusetts. It is interesting to note that Stiles & Hart purchased the machinery of the defunct West Barnstable Brick Co on Cape Cod.\n\nHistory of the Stiles and Hart Brick Company\n\nStiles and Hart in Our Collection\n\nSOURCES:\n\nThe Whelden Library\n\nAnswers.com: Bridgewater\n\nThe Natural Resources Trust of Bridgewater\n\nLucraft and Luckraft One-name Study: A Quebecois Family\n\nDylanStiles.com\n\nFrom: Portrait and Biographical Record of Rockland and Orange Counties New York, Chapman Publishing Co., 1895:\n\nEVERETT FOWLER. The brick business is one of the principal industries of Rockland County, and the men who have engaged in it have almost invariably gained success. As a representative of this class mention should be made of Everett Fowler, who is superintendent of the Excelsior Brick Company and of D. Fowler & Son. The former concern has a capacity of sixteen million of brick and gives employment to eighty or ninety men, while the latter company employs seventy or eighty men, with a capacity in its output of twelve million.\n\nIn the village of Haverstraw, where he still resides, Mr. Fowler was born December 26, 1854, and in the schools of this place obtained a fair business education; he afterwards attended, and was graduated from, the Thirty-fifth Street Grammar School in New York. At the age of eighteen he became bookkeeper for his father, and three years later he began in business for himself, opening a brickyard near his present location. After four years there, in 1880, he became a member of the firm of D. Fowler & Son, and has since managed the valuable plant of this company. When the Excelsior yards were purchased, he became a partner in the enterprise, of which he is now superintendent. His entire attention from early youth has been devoted to the manufacture of brick, and he has been unusually successful in this occupation. He has made a study of the business, and at different times has visited nearly all the brickyards in the United States, gaining from a close observation of their methods practical ideas for the management of his own yards.\n\nIn April, 1880, Mr. Fowler married Miss Anna S. Denison, granddaughter of Major Suffern, and a daughter of P. and Anna (Suffern) Denison. Four children were born to our subject and wife: John E.; Catherine; Denison, who died at the age of four years; and Denton. Mrs. Fowler is a member of the Central Presbyterian Church, of which Dr. Freeman is pastor. In social circles Mr. Fowler is highly esteemed, and he is one of the active members of the Bicycle Club.\n\nSee Also: DENTON FOWLER.\n\nNotes from Fred Rieck--\n\nWilliam H. Haight first appeared in Poughkeepsie City Directories in 1888 as a proprietor of a livery business at 21 Catharine St. His residence: 295 Mill St. In 1890 \"sheds\" appears as a business item along with livery and stables.\n\n1900 directory indicates ... boarding and sale of horses a specialty, also farmers sheds, (and) Brickyard: 21 Catharine St. In the 1903-04 directory, he is no longer listed as having a brick affiliation The 1906-07 directory indicates an Ellsworth Craft is occupying the 21 Catharine St. address. Haight residing at 48 Academy.\n\nI never found a specific location for Haight's brickyard although I suspect it was somewhere around \"Brick Yard Hill\" in what is now Arlington. There is a Haight Ave. in that vicinity where Rts 44 and 55 diverge.\n\nThere were three (3) William H. Haights in Poughkeepsie after Haight the bricker and liveryman moved in. Those other Haights were machinists - father and son Haight weren't in the brick business very long.\n\nThere were a couple of pallets of used HAIGHTS between buildings between Main and Mill Sts. which may have fallen off a building wall in that area. These bldgs have been knocked down. None of the HAIGHT brick I've seen ever had a nice surface finish. Letters all were more difficult to read.\n\n==========\n\nWebmaster Notes--\n\nOther Poughkeepsie brickyards included: Otis Allen & George H. Terwilliger (A & T); Isaac P. Flagler & Otis Allen (F & A); Allen, Townsend & Mack (A T & M); Norton I. Pennock (NIP, PENNOCK); Poughkeepsie Brick Corp (PB CORP); Hyland R Rose (HRR); Towey Brick Co (TOWEY); and WN Wetterau (WETTARAU).\n\nPoughkeepsie, NY is rich in history. One of its notable citizens was Matthew Vassar who founded Vassar College in 1861.\n\nThe Vassar Family emigrated from England to America in 1796 and established a farm in the Poughkeepsie area, overlooking the Hudson River. James Vassar made the transition from farming to running family businesses in the early 1800âs, founding a brickyard on their property and soon thereafter starting a brewery operation. He and his wife had two sons who grew up in the family businesses.\n\nIn 1836 Matthew Vassar \"commissioned a new waterfront brewery, which became the largest in the United States at the time, measuring 200 by 50 feet and producing 50,000 barrels of beer each year. While many businesses suffered during the 1837 depression, M. Vassar & Co. flourished due to an ongoing demand for ale. He also ran a brickyard which manufactured \"large and beautiful pressed bricks\" known as \"Poughkeepsie Stretchers.\"\n\nMatthew Jr.âs widow, Irene Beech Vassar, inspired by Florence Nightingale, a well-known reformist nurse in Great Britain, set out to find a location for a new hospital and chose a piece of property on what was then the outskirts of Poughkeepsie. The 14-acre property had a perfect view of the river, pleasant grounds and therapeutic breezes -- perfect for patients and their recovery. Vassar Brothers Hospital opened its doors on April 11, 1887. The main building component was, of course, Vassar bricks.\n\nSources: Vassar Encyclopedia\n\nVassarBrothers.org\n\n1861\n\n\"We have been informed that a brickyard will be opened in this village soon near the Wallkill on S. Water St.\n\n1862\n\nVillage Hall to be built of brick of 'home manufacture.'\n\n1869\n\nBricks were manufactured in New Paltz as early as the 1830s, possibly earlier. According to early sources, the Reformed Church on Huguenot Street, built in 1839, was constructed of local brick. It is certain that Eaton Van Wagenen established a brick yard in 1869 on the West side of North Chestnut Street between Academy Street and Front Street.\n\nA.M. Low (LOWE) operated a brickyard south of the village on Plains Road from the 1880s to 1906. In 1906 a group of local businessmen bought out Mr. Low, purchasing his property, as well as Andries LeFevreâs adjoining farm. They organized the Lowe Brick Company which operated successfully until 1928. Among the buildings still standing and known to have been constructed of local brick are the Academy Theatre [Village Hall] in 1863, the Van Vlack Pharmacy building in the 1880s and \"Old Main\" on the SUNY campus in 1909.\n\n1888\n\nWithin a short time past the editor of the Independent has visited Kingston, Newburgh and Poughkeepsie, and passed through Marlborough, Rosendale, Highland and other villages in the vicinity. In none of those places was there as much evidence of life and animation as at New Paltz. In none of them was there as much new building to be seen in going through the main streets as is to be observed in New Paltz. And in no other place did so large a proportion of the buildings appear to have been erected in the past few years.\n\nWe must observe too that the buildings lately erected and those now in progress in this place are to a great extent fine appearing and tasteful. It has been freelypredicted that the boom must soon come to an end, because New Paltz has no factories, but somehow the determination to put up new houses does not seem to grow less. It is partly because New Paltz is such a delightful place of residences and partly because taxes are going to be so light here after this year, when the last of the town bonds are paid, and partly because of the growth of the patronage of the mountain houses and partly because of the increased number in the fruit business, and partly because of such new enterprises as the brickyard and creamery, but of course, the principal cause of the prosperity of the place is the Normal School, and when the new building is erected we may expect a continued steady growth of the place.\n\n1889\n\nTelephone installed in Normal School. \"Rural Avenue\" [Plains Road]. On this thoroughfare which leads from our village are many pleasant places, with scenery pleasing to the eye, all the way to Ireland Corners. First Maple Lawn, the home of the C. Wurts family, then the brickyard of A.M. Low, who employs from fifteen to twenty men and boys during the season;\n\n1892\n\nNew Paltz Brick Co. (A.M. Low) manufactured 1 million bricks, 170,000sent to Kingston; 120,000 for the stack of Doremus Cement Mill, Whiteport;some shipped to Montgomery; 2 car loads to Walden; 75,000 ordered for cement mill in Binnewater.\n\n1908\n\nAbout fifteen years ago our village had quite a building boom for several years at a time when in the country at large there was a general depression inbusiness. Now at another time when there is general dullness in business, New Paltz is having quite a large number of new buildings put up. The building boom at the first time spoken of was on account of the establishment of the Normal school here. The present boom is for several reasons: the new Normal school building; the building of the New York aqueduct and the presence of a large number of engineers; the growth of the summer boarding business; the brick yard giving employment to a large number of hands; the transportation of excursions to and from Mohonk.\""
