        "text": "Hand, foot and mouth disease is a very common viral disease of childhood which is easily passed from person to person. It usually causes a mild illness but rarely causes serious illness. It is not related to the foot and mouth disease that affects animals. Good hygiene helps prevent infection.\n\nDownload as PDF\n\nLast updated: 26 July 2022\n\nWhat is hand, foot and mouth disease?\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is a common but highly contagious infection in children caused by enteroviruses, including coxsackieviruses. While generally a mild illness, some children will have fever, sore throat and tiredness and blisters which can be uncomfortable. It mainly occurs in children under 10 years of age but can also occur in older children and adults. It is not related to the foot and mouth disease that affects animals.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease starts with blisters that begin as small red dots which later become ulcers. Blisters appear inside the cheeks, gums, and on the sides of the tongue, as well as on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. In infants, blisters can sometimes be seen in the nappy area. Blisters usually last for seven 7 to 10 days.\n\nChildren can sometimes have a low fever, sore throat, tiredness, and feel off colour, and may be off their food for a day or two.\n\nVery rarely, enteroviruses can cause other illnesses that affect the heart, brain, lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis), lungs, or eyes.\n\nHow is it spread?\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is usually spread by person-to-person contact. The virus is spread from the faeces of an infected person to the mouth of the next person by contaminated hands. It is also spread by secretions from the mouth or respiratory system (often through sneezing and coughing), by direct contact with the fluid from blisters, and via objects or surfaces with the virus on them.\n\nIt usually takes between three and five days after contact with an infected person before blisters appear. The viruses can remain in faeces for several weeks.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nThe viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease are common and particularly affect children.\n\nHand foot and mouth disease can spread easily and quickly within households, particularly among children.\n\nMany adults, including pregnant women, are often exposed to them without symptoms. There is no clear evidence of risk to unborn babies from hand, foot and mouth disease. However, infected mothers (and siblings) can pass the infection onto newborn babies who rarely can have severe disease.\n\nOutbreaks may occur in child-care settings.\n\nHow is it prevented?\n\nGood hygiene is the best protection.\n\nWash hands with soap and water and thoroughly dry them after going to the toilet, before eating, after wiping noses, and after changing nappies or soiled clothing.\n\nAvoid sharing cups, eating utensils, items of personal hygiene (for example: towels, washers and toothbrushes), and clothing (especially shoes and socks).\n\nThoroughly wash any soiled clothing and any surfaces or toys that may have been contaminated.\n\nTeach children about cough and sneeze etiquette:\n\nCover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Coughing into an elbow is better than coughing into your hands.\n\nDispose of used tissues in the bin straight away.\n\nWash your hands afterwards with soap and water and thoroughly dry them, if handwashing facilities are not available use an alcohol based sanitiser or antibacterial wipe to clean hands.\n\nKeep sick children at home while unwell.\n\nHow is it diagnosed?\n\nYour doctor can diagnose hand, foot and mouth disease based on the symptoms. Laboratory tests are not usually necessary.\n\nHow is it treated?\n\nUsually no treatment is needed. Paracetamol will relieve fever and discomfort. Do not give children aspirin.\n\nAllow blisters to dry out naturally. The blisters should not be deliberately burst because the fluid within them is infectious.\n\nMake sure young children are drinking enough, as painful mouth sores can make some children reluctant to swallow liquids.\n\nWhat are the signs of a serious infection?\n\nSigns that an infant or older child might have a more serious form of hand, foot and mouth disease include any of the following:\n\npersistent fever (38Â°C or above for 72 hours or more)\n\nabnormal movements / jerking movements\n\nrapid breathing\n\nexcessive tiredness, drowsiness\n\nexcessive irritability\n\ndifficulty walking.\n\nIf any of these signs are present then the child should be seen by a doctor urgently even if they have been checked earlier in the illness.\n\nBlisters in the mouth may also make it painful for children to swallow fluids. If a child continues to refuse fluids by mouth they should also be seen by a doctor.\n\nHow long should children stay away from childcare and school?\n\nChildren with hand, foot and mouth disease should be excluded from school or childcare facilities until their blisters have dried-up, and any rash (if present) has gone and any fever has settled.\n\nDuring this exclusion period they should also avoid activities and places where they will be in contact with others such as swimming lessons and playgrounds/centres, to avoid spreading this very contagious disease.\n\nWhat is the public health response?\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is not notifiable under the Public Health Act. However, to help prevent spread parents should report the illness to the director of the childcare centre or the school principal.\n\nFurther information\n\nFor further information please call your local public health unit on 1300 066 055.\n\nInformation for health professionals\n\nSee the Enteroviruses (non-polio) and human parechoviruses fact sheet - Information for clinicians."
