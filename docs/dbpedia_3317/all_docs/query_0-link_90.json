        "text": "I started off preparing this story, with just a pair of matching photographs, of Frank O. Foster, and his wife, Alice. As is often the case I acquired these on Ebay, happening to notice they had spent some time in my native city of Manchester, New Hampshire. I felt fortunate that someone had the foresight to label their names on the back of these lovely portraits.\n\nMy preliminary research revealed several Foster genealogies, and on inspecting the first one, I felt a bit smug that researching this line would be easy to do. Well, I was so wrong. There is nothing easy about researching FOSTER in New England, as all the older published genealogies have some major flaws and errors.\n\nThrowing aside the genealogies, setting aside the many and varied family trees that are “out there” on the internet, and starting fresh, I have attempted to present a clearer, more accurate ancestral line of both Frank O. Foster, and his cousin, the famed General John Gray Foster. My sources are listed, or I have provided the links to the primary evidence.\n\nA request to any diehard Foster genealogists out there–if you find my research to be completely wrong, off the wall, etc., please comment. However, if you do please be ready to provide some proofs of how I am wrong, not just “but this book says …..” Show me the primary evidence and I will bow to your greater wisdom and research.\n\nRegarding Frank O. Foster–he was born in Maine, and several generations previous to him were also Maine natives. He married in Manchester, but following the death of his wife Alice and remarriage, he removed to Florida, where he probably died. Some of his descendants may still remain in the Manchester area.\n\n=====SOME DESCENDANTS OF REGINALD FOSTER======\n\nReginald Foster, arrived from England, and by 1638 settled in Ipswich MA with his wife Judith, five sons and two daughter, being one of the earliest inhabitants of that town. He lived near the “East Bridge” (where later a stone bridge stood). On 6 April 1641 Reginald Foster was granted 8 acres of meadow in the west meadow, in consideration of a little hovel that stood at the new bridge, which was taken away for the accommodating of the passage there…” Reginald Foster along with others on 19 Dec 1645 subscribed his portion of 3 shillings toward the sum of L24.7sh. “to pay their leader Major Dennison….” On 8 March 1647-48 he bought land from Ralph Dix of Ipswich. In 1652 he and Thomas Clark are granted L10 for making a path, ford and footbridge. On 3 June 1652 he was a witness to the will of William Averill of Ipswich. In 1657-58 he bought a dwelling house from Roger Preston, and another house lot. In 1663 he was an appraiser of a lot of the estate of Robert Roberts. His first wife Judith died in Oct 1664 in Ipswich MA. He m2d) Sep 1665 Sarah Martin, widow of John Martin of Ipswich. The exact date of his death is not known, but his will was proved 9 June 1681. She surived her husband and on 21 Sep 1682 became the 2nd wife of William White of Haverhill MA. She died 22 Feb 1682-3. [details]\n\n——————————\n\nChildren of Reginald & Judith (?) Foster:\n\n1.
