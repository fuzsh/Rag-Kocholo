        "text": "What is it?\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a serious condition in which the heart muscle is weak and incapable of pumping as much blood as it should.\n\nThe blood waiting to get into the heart develops a high pressure and this can cause fluid to leak out of the blood vessels into the lung (pulmonary oedema). The amount of blood that the heart can pump is severely reduced and this is even more of a problem on exercising.\n\nWhat causes it?\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy has many causes, not all of which are known. In some infants and children, it has been present since birth and even before, though undetected. The cause may be defective heart muscle, a problem with the way in which the heart uses nutrients (a metabolic cause) or a syndrome. These, in turn, may be due to a genetic problem and can run in a family.\n\nIn another group of infants and children, dilated cardiomyopathy occurs as a consequence of a viral infection such as coxsackie. This can cause an inflammation of the heart known as acute (sudden) myocarditis. When the inflammation settles, heart function may slowly return to normal but, in some people, it persists and is then indistinguishable from dilated cardiomyopathy. These viral infections can even occur in the womb and, if the damage does not resolve itself, the infant may be born with dilated cardiomyopathy. In many cases, a cause is never found.\n\nHow many people get it?\n\nThe prevalence of all types of cardiomyopathy has been estimated as approximately one case every year out of every 100,000 children younger than 10 years of age.\n\nWho gets it?\n\nAnyone can get dilated cardiomyopathy. It can occur at all ages â from fetal life through childhood to old age. In children, it is most common in infants (less than one year old).\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms?\n\nBoth dilated cardiomyopathy and inflammation of the heart (acute myocarditis) present in similar ways and it is often impossible to distinguish them without performing tests. Often the condition starts with symptoms of a viral respiratory infection with:\n\nbreathlessness\n\ndifficulty feeding\n\nsweaty on feeding\n\nvomiting\n\nlethargy\n\ndiarrhoea\n\nmuscle pains\n\nsudden collapse\n\ngeneral malaise in older children\n\nWith the advent of fetal echocardiography, the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy can be made in the womb.\n\nWhat kind of tests might I have?\n\nChildren are referred to a paediatric cardiologist, who will investigate further. After questioning the parents to obtain the child's history and examining the child, several tests will be organised. These will usually comprise an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical activity of the heart and a chest X-ray to visualise the heart and lungs. The diagnosis is made by echocardiography. Some blood and urine tests may also be necessary to attempt to find a cause.\n\nIn the long term, repeated echocardiograms will be performed to assess the cardiac function and assess recovery.\n\nWhat is the treatment?\n\nIn mild cases:\n\nDiuretics to encourage the child to pass urine and reduce the water retention\n\nACE inhibitors such as captopril, enalapril or lisinopril to make the work of the heart easier\n\nBeta blockers such as carvedilol may be used to slow the filling of the heart\n\nDigoxin may be used in addition to the above.\n\nIn severe cases:\n\nVentilation on an intensive care unit\n\nDrugs to stimulate the heart (known as inotropes), such as adrenaline\n\nHeart transplantation\n\nIf the condition is suspected to be acute myocarditis, immunoglobulins may be used.\n\nAre there any complications of the condition?\n\nMany infants and children with mild cardiomyopathy suffer no complications. In severe cases there can be major complications to vital organ systems and even death.\n\nWhat is the prognosis?\n\nOf those who are taken to their doctor with severe heart failure, approximately one third make a complete recovery, one third recover but remain on medicine to assist heart function and one third either die or require a heart transplant. Outpatient visits may be lifelong, with repeated echocardiograms to assess cardiac function.\n\nWhen the heart function is very poor and does not recover, a heart transplant may be considered.\n\nDownload Dilated Cardiomyopathy in childhood PDF"
