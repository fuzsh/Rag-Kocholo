        "text": "Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common childhood illness that can also affect adults. It usually gets better on its own in 7 to 10 days.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is not the same as foot and mouth disease that affects farm animals.\n\nCheck if it's hand, foot and mouth disease\n\nThe 1st symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease can be:\n\na sore throat\n\na high temperature\n\nnot wanting to eat\n\nThe 2nd stage usually starts a few days later and symptoms can include:\n\nmouth ulcers, which can be painful\n\na raised rash of spots on the hands and feet, and sometimes the groin area and bottom\n\nThe rash of spots can look pink, red, or darker than the surrounding skin, depending on your skin tone.\n\nThe spots can turn into blisters, which might be grey or lighter than surrounding skin and can be painful.\n\nSymptoms are usually mild and are the same in adults and children.\n\nMouth ulcers\n\nSpots on the hands and feet\n\nHere is an image gallery with images and detailed descriptions. Select an image tab to get the bigger version of the image and to access the description.\n\n1: Hand, foot and mouth disease spots on white skin (thumbnail). 1\n\n2: Hand, foot and mouth disease spots and patches on medium brown skin (thumbnail). 2\n\n3: Hand, foot and mouth disease blister on white skin (thumbnail). 3\n\nIf you're not sure your child has hand, foot and mouth disease\n\nLook at other rashes in babies and children.\n\nHow to treat hand, foot and mouth disease yourself\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease usually gets better on its own in 7 to 10 days. You cannot take antibiotics or other medicines to cure it.\n\nTo help the symptoms:\n\ndrink cool fluids to soothe the mouth and prevent dehydration (but avoid acidic drinks, such as fruit juice)\n\neat soft foods like yoghurt and avoid hot, salty and spicy foods\n\ntake paracetamol or ibuprofen to help ease a sore mouth or throat\n\nA pharmacist can help with hand, foot and mouth disease\n\nAsk a pharmacist for advice about treatments, such as mouth ulcer gels, sprays and mouthwashes, to relieve pain.\n\nThey can tell you which ones are suitable for children.\n\nNon-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n\nsymptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease do not improve after 7 to 10 days\n\nyou're pregnant and get hand, foot and mouth disease\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease can be spread to other people.\n\nCheck with your GP surgery before going. They may suggest a phone consultation.\n\nUrgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:\n\nyou or your child has a very high temperature, or feel hot and shivery\n\nyou're worried about your child's hand, foot and mouth disease symptoms\n\nyour child has hand, foot and mouth disease and is peeing less than usual (they may be becoming dehydrated)\n\nYou can call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\nHow to stop hand, foot and mouth disease spreading\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is easily passed on to other people. It's spread in coughs, sneezes, poo and the fluid in the blisters. You can get it more than once.\n\nYou can start spreading it from a few days before you have any symptoms, but you're most likely to spread it to others in the first 5 days after symptoms start.\n\nTo reduce the risk of spreading hand, foot and mouth disease:\n\nwash your hands often with soap and water, and children's hands too\n\nuse tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze\n\nbin used tissues as quickly as possible\n\ndo not share towels or household items like cups or cutlery\n\nwash soiled bedding and clothing on a hot wash\n\nStaying off school or nursery\n\nKeep your child off school or nursery while they're feeling too unwell to go.\n\nBut as soon as they're feeling better, they can go back to school or nursery. There's no need to wait until all the blisters have healed.\n\nKeeping your child away from other children for longer is unlikely to stop the illness spreading.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy\n\nAlthough there's usually no risk to the pregnancy or baby, it's best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand, foot and mouth disease.\n\nThis is because getting hand, foot and mouth disease shortly before giving birth can mean your baby is born with a mild version of it.\n\nSpeak to a GP or your midwife if you have been in contact with someone with hand, foot and mouth disease."
