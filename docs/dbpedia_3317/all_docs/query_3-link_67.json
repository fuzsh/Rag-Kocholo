        "text": "Catharine Bogardus: The Matriarch of the Bronk family in Fulton County\n\nWritten and submitted by Donna Bennett\n\nCatharine Bogardus moved to the Town of Ephratah with her husband, Caspar Bronk, in the early 1800's. The Bogardus and Bronck families were well established families in Albany/Greene Counties at that time. The possibility of available unsettled or sparsely settled land in Fulton County/Mohawk Valley may have been the reason for their relocation. Some of their children were born in Greene County. Other children were born in Fulton County. Their children and generations of grandchildren married into other large families of the Town of Ephratah and Fulton County........Lassell, Wemple, Dennis, Frederick, Ercanbrack, Leek, Christman, Fical, etc.\n\nNothing is known of Catharine--no family stories, no gossip, no scandals, no bits of trivia that have been passed down through the years. She appeared in census records in Fulton County in the mid to late 1800s. While she is seemingly unimportant to history, she was the matriarch of many Bronks in Fulton County. When tracing her lineage back to the 1600's in New Netherland, one has to wonder if she knew about her notorious and well-documented family members as seen in this bio.\n\nCatharine Bogardus (aka: Catharina, Caty) bpt.5 Feb 1792 Dutch Reformed Church Coxsackie, NY. She married Caspar Bronk on 2 July 1808 Dutch Reformed Church Coxsackie, NY. Catharine died 4 Apr 1881, age 88 years, 1 month, 21 days. Johnstown Cemetery records show she was buried in that cemetery, but no burial plot number nor headstone could be found.\n\nCaspar had previously married Eliza de la Vergne Greene on 1 May 1804 Dutch Reformed Church Coxsackie, NY. Capar and Eliza had one son, Richard Bronk b.6 Jan 1804 Coxsackie, d.21 Aug 1857 Fulton County. Richard married Nancy Wemple. They had 8 children: Catherine, John R., Marvin, Barbara, Barney, Margaret, Casper, and Janet/Jane\n\nChildren of Catharine and Caspar: (Bronk genealogy, internet websites)\n\nAlly Maria b.6 Aug 1811\n\nJohn b.5 Feb 1814 Coxsackie, d.19 Sept 1906 Johnstown. He married 1.Rachel Fredrick/Frederick on 4 July 1833. John and Rachel had 3 children: Ephraim, Mary Jane, and Katherine. John married 2. Hester Bell on 24 Nov 1842 First Presbyterian Church, Johnstown, NY\n\nLydia b.1818, married 1.Gilbert Haggart and 2.Palmer Kennedy\n\nJudith b.1820, married Solomon Rogers/Rodgers. Both buried Johnstown Cemetery section R #1097\n\nEve married_______Lewis\n\nKatharine b.June 1822, d.aft 1904, married _____ Pittman/Putman\n\nNancy b.July 1825, d.after 1900, married George Michael Frank\n\nElizabeth b.1824/5, married C.Holmes Dennis on 5 Oct 1847 Fulton Co. C. Holmes Dennis b.1820.\n\n(Bronk genealogy only lists 6 daughters not 7 as seen in Catharine's obit. 1865 Fulton County census shows Caspar had 9 children)\n\nEphratah Dutch Reformed Church records for member in 1824: Caspar Bronk\n\nSometime previous to the 1860 census, Catharine and Caspar were no longer living together. Caspar appeared in 1860 census living with William Frederick in Town of Johnstown; 1865 census, he lived with Ephraim Bronk in Lassellsville; and 1870 census, Caspar was in the Fulton County Poor House. Records from the Poor House are missing in Fulton County--so questions can not be answered. Caspar apparently died in the Poor House and may be buried in the Poor House cemetery (?). +++Transfer and sales of land, judgements against Caspar, and later ownership of property by Catharine and their sons told some of the story. (land records reseached by Evelyn Frasier, Town of Ephratah Historian)\n\n1860 census-Town of Johnstown: Catharine Bronk age 70; Solomon Rodgers age 56 skin dresser; Judith Rodgers age 40. Solomon owned real estate $400.

Real estate $1,000 and personal property $500 are listed on the same line as Lydia's name.\n\n1875 census-Johnstown: Palmer Kennedy age 69, relationship-servant, born Herkimer Co., single, teamster; Lydia Kennedy, age 55 born Fulton Co, married; Catharine Bronk, age 83 mother, born Greene Co., widow; Frank Haggart 18 son, born Fulton Co.; Daniel Kennedy age 12, son, born Fulton Co.\n\n1880 census-Johnstown, district #1: Palmer Kennedy b.1806 age 74 teamster; Lydia Kennedy wife b.1818 age 62; Jacob Neahs son in law age 40 restaurant proprietor; Anna Neahs daugher age 28; Frank Haggart step-son age 23 teamster; Daniel Kennedy son age 16; Catherine Beonk (sic) mother in law age 88 widow.\n\n1880-81 Johnstown City Directories: Catharine Bronk, Perry Street\n\nObit and cemetery records, Johnstown Public Library: \"Mrs. Caspar Bronk died at residence of her daughter Mrs. P.

At the age of 20, he entered Leyden University on 27 July 1627. He was ordained a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church on 11 Jan 1632.(vol.II Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs, 1911 edited by Cuyler Reynolds) Bogardus was sent to the Guinea Coast in 1630 as a ziekentrooster (comforter of the sick). (The Souls of African-American Children: New Amsterdam by Joyce D. Goodfriend)\n\nEverardus returned to Amsterdam, Holland in 1632. He sailed for New Amsterdam, New Netherland on the \"de Zouthberg\" in 1633.(Ships to New Netherland passenger list) He was the second minister in the Reformed Church of New Amsterdam from 1633 to 1647.(List of Ministers of the Reformed Church of New Amsterdam records) While in American, he adopted the name Everardus Bogardus.\n\n\"Bogardus, Everardus (orig.

Those present and signing the treaty were Cornelius van Tienhoven, Hendrick vanDyck, Everhardus (sic) Bogardus (pastor), Jonas Bronck, and several Indians-two of whom had sold land to Bronck. (Scandinavian Immigrants in New York 1630-1674 by John O. Evjen)\n\nJonas Bronck died in 1643 and an inventory of his possessions was conducted by his wife (Antonia Slagboom Bronck), Pieter Bronck, Jochem Pietersen Kuyter and Rev. Bogardus. (byJohn O.Evjen) Antonia Slagboom Bronck, after the death of Jonas, married Arent van Corlear/van Curler. Curler obtained the land grant and founded Schenectady. Antonia Slagboom Bronk van Curler died in Schenectady. The relationship of Pieter Bronck to Jonas Bronck is still questioned by historians and genealogists. Was Pieter the son of Jonas by his first marriage in Sweden? Or was Pieter the brother of Jonas Bronck? (Caspar Bronk is a direct descendent of Pieter Bronck)\n\nNY Marriage Licenses issued by State of NY: 21 June 1642 Everardus Bogardus; Anna Jansen.\n\nNew Amsterdam Reformed Dutch Church 1639-70 Baptism records: 2 April 1645 Everardus Bogardus; Pieter.

Her commander was a 28 year old named Jan Claesen Bol. The ship sailed 16 Aug 1647 and sank off the Coast of Wales at Mumbles Point on 27 Sept 1647. Of the 107 passengers, only 21 passengers were rescued. Everardus Bogardus drowned. (ships to New Netherland)\n\nAnneke Jans b.1605 Flekkeroy, Norway, d.1663 Beverwyck (Albany). At the time of her death, she resided at the corner of State and James Streets. She had returned to Beverwyck and became a fur trader after the death of her second husband, Rev. Bogardus.\n\nAnneke married 1.Roelof Janssoon on 1 April 1623 in the Reformed Oude Kerk, Amsterdam, Holland. Roelof, a seaman, was 21 years old and Anneke was 18 years old. They sailed to New Netherland on de Eendracht from Texel 21 Mar 1630 with their two daughters-Sara and Trjntje. The ship arrived in New Netherland 24 May 1630.(ships passenger list) Roelof did not take to farming in the Rensselaerwyck Colony and returned to sea.

She also had a wildenhuysje, an Indian house, according to diagrams of land plot/ownership records of Beverwyck.\n\nDominie Bogardus and his wife Anneke are well documented in history. Many stories are told of the Reverend drinking beer and preaching under its influence. His battles with authorities in New Amsterdam and the ill-fated voyage can be found in books or on internet websites. Dutch court documents from New Amsterdam, Beverwyck/Albany, and Renesselearwyck have been well-preserved, transcribed, and can be found on websites. The property owned by Anneke and the court battles lasting into the early 20th century by her heirs are legendary. The descendents of Anneke are numbered in the millions!\n\nGeneration 2\n\nPieter Bogardus bpt.2 Apr 1645 Reformed Dutch Church, New Amsterdam, d.1703 Kingston, Ulster County. Pieter married Wyntje Cornelise Bosch on 10 Feb 1665 Kingston.

Jacob was a master tailor and fur trader in Beverwyck.\n\nIn 1682 Villeroy purchased a house and lot in Albany from Samuel Adams. He was arrested for illegal fur trading. Villeroy had previous escaped from Canada--leaving owing money. In a letter from a Montreal merchant was sent to Major Baxter in Aug 1683, the merchant referred to Villeroy as \"a French vagabond\". (Albany court records) At this time in Albany, many French men were marrying Dutch women.\n\nAlbany 10 Mar 1683/4 persons who were in arrears to annual taxes: \"Villeroy who is absent 2 Florins.\"\n\nThe Canadian government persuaded a few French families to settle on the Saratoga patent. Other French Canadians were sent to live amongst the settlers and spy on the English colonists and English armies. (The Story of Old Saratoga) In the winter of 1688-9, Villeroy, Antonie Lespenard, John van Loon, and Lafleur were arrested for aiding English soldiers to desert and escape to Canada. They were arrested and brought to Albany for a hearing. Warrant issued 1 Aug 1689. Villeroy was detained at the Fort in Albany.
