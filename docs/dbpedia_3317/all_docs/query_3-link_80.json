        "text": "What is hepatitis in children?\n\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. It can damage and destroy liver cells.\n\nWhat causes hepatitis in a child?\n\nHepatitis in children can be caused by many things. Your child can get hepatitis by being exposed to a virus that causes it. These viruses can include:\n\nHepatitis viruses. There are 5 main types of the hepatitis virus: A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nCytomegalovirus. This virus is a part of the herpes virus family.\n\nEpstein-Barr virus. The virus causes mononucleosis.\n\nHerpes simplex virus. Herpes can affect the face, the skin above the waist, or the genitals.\n\nVaricella zoster virus (chickenpox). A complication of this virus is hepatitis. But this happens very rarely in children.\n\nEnteroviruses. This is a group of viruses often seen in children. They include coxsackie viruses and echoviruses.\n\nRubella. This is a mild disease that causes a rash.\n\nAdenovirus. This is a group of viruses that causes colds, tonsillitis, and ear infections in children. They can also cause diarrhea.\n\nParvovirus. This virus causes fifth disease. Symptoms include a slapped-cheek rash on the face.\n\nConditions can also cause hepatitis in children. These can include autoimmune liver disease. For this disease, your child’s immune system makes antibodies that attack the liver. This causes inflammation that leads to hepatitis.\n\nWhich children are at risk for hepatitis?\n\nChildren who are exposed to a virus that causes hepatitis are more likely to get hepatitis.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThis form of the virus is passed through fecal-oral contact. It’s spread to children in the following ways:\n\nEating food made by an infected person who didn’t wash their hands well after using the bathroom\n\nDrinking water that is contaminated by infected feces. This is a problem in developing countries.\n\nTouching an infected person's feces or dirty diaper, and then putting his or her hands near the mouth. Outbreaks may happen in child-care centers.\n\nInternational travel to areas where hepatitis A is common\n\nUsing illegal drugs\n\nBlood transfusions (very rare)\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is spread when blood from an infected person enters another person's body. It can be spread through needlesticks and sharp instruments. It can also be spread by sharing personal items such as razors and toothbrushes.\n\nBabies may catch the virus during pregnancy if their mother has the virus. Children can spread it to others through household contact or through scrapes or cuts.\n\nThe following children are at risk for hepatitis B:\n\nChildren born to moms with hepatitis B\n\nChildren born to mothers who have come from a country where hepatitis B is widespread. These include Southeast Asia and China.\n\nChildren who live in long-term care facilities or who are disabled\n\nChildren who live in households where someone is infected with the virus\n\nChildren who have a blood-clotting problem and need blood products. This can include hemophilia.\n\nChildren who need dialysis for kidney failure\n\nTeens who do high-risk activities. These include IV (intravenous) drug use and unprotected sex.\n\nHepatitis C\n\nHepatitis C passes through infected blood. It can also be passed through sexual contact. Moms can also pass it to their babies during pregnancy. The following children are at risk for hepatitis C:\n\nChildren born to mothers who have the virus\n\nChildren who have a blood clotting problem, such as hemophilia\n\nChildren who need dialysis for kidney failure\n\nTeens who do high-risk activities. These include IV (intravenous) drug use and unprotected sex.\n\nHepatitis D\n\nThis type of hepatitis can only happen with hepatitis B. Hepatitis D can happen at the same time your child is infected with hepatitis B, or it can start later.\n\nHepatitis D can't be spread from a mom to her baby during pregnancy. This condition is rare in children born in the U.S. This is because the hepatitis B vaccine is given to babies. Hepatitis D only happens in people already infected with hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis E\n\nThis form of hepatitis is like hepatitis A. It’s spread through fecal-oral contact. Hepatitis E is most common in developing countries. It’s rare in the U.S.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of hepatitis in a child?\n\nSymptoms can happen a bit differently in each child. Some children don’t have any symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of sudden (acute) hepatitis may include:\n\nFlu-like symptoms\n\nYellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n\nFever\n\nNausea or vomiting\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nNot feeling well\n\nStomach pain or discomfort\n\nDiarrhea\n\nJoint pain\n\nSore muscles\n\nItchy red hives on the skin\n\nClay-colored stools\n\nDark-colored urine\n\nThe symptoms of this condition may look like symptoms of other health problems. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.\n\nHow is hepatitis diagnosed in a child?\n\nYour child’s healthcare provider will check his or her health history. The provider will also give your child a physical exam. Your child may also need other tests.\n\nBlood testing\n\nYour child’s healthcare provider may do blood tests for the following:\n\nLiver enzymes\n\nLiver function\n\nAntibody and polymerase chain reaction. This is to check for the type of hepatitis.\n\nCellular blood counts\n\nCoagulation tests. These include international normalized ratio.\n\nCT scan\n\nA CT scan shows detailed images of any part of the body. This test will show your child’s bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans are more detailed than general X-rays.\n\nUltrasound\n\nUltrasound uses sound waves to examine parts of the body. It is very effective in examining the liver.\n\nMRI\n\nThis test uses large magnets, radio waves, and a computer. Together, these show detailed images of organs and structures inside your child’s body.\n\nLiver biopsy\n\nYour child’s healthcare provider may take out a tissue sample from your child’s liver. Then he or she may look at it closely under a microscope.\n\nHow is hepatitis treated in a child?\n\nTreatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.\n\nYour child’s treatment will depend on what’s causing his or her hepatitis. The goal of treatment is to stop damage to your child’s liver. It’s also to help ease symptoms. Your child’s treatment may include:\n\nMedicines. These can control itching, treat the virus, or control an autoimmune disease.\n\nSupportive care. This includes eating a healthy diet and getting enough rest.\n\nReducing risk. Not using alcohol or illegal drugs.\n\nBlood testing. This can tell if the disease is progressing.\n\nHospital stay. This is done in severe cases.\n\nLiver transplant. This is done for end-stage liver failure.\n\nHelping to prevent the spread of viral hepatitis. Having good personal health (hygiene) habits, such as handwashing.\n\nWhat are possible complications of hepatitis in a child?\n\nThe main complications of hepatitis include liver failure, liver cancer, or death. This is more likely with hepatitis B or C.\n\nHow can I help my child live with hepatitis?\n\nWork with your child’s healthcare provider to create a care plan for your child. If your child has chronic hepatitis, he or she will need to get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet, and take medicines as prescribed.\n\nWhen should I call my child's healthcare provider?\n\nCall your child’s healthcare provider if your child has symptoms of hepatitis, such as jaundice. You should also call if your child is exposed to viruses that can cause the disease.\n\nKey points about hepatitis in children\n\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. It can damage and destroy liver cells.\n\nHepatitis in children can be caused by many things. Your child can get hepatitis by being exposed to a virus that causes it.\n\nThere are 5 main types of the hepatitis virus: A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nThe most common symptoms of hepatitis include a yellowish color to the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and flu-like symptoms.\n\nSome children don't have any symptoms.\n\nGetting vaccinated and having good hygiene can prevent hepatitis.\n\nNext steps\n\nTips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s healthcare provider:\n\nKnow the reason for the visit and what you want to happen.\n\nBefore your visit, write down questions you want answered.\n\nAt the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.\n\nKnow why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help your child. Also know what the side effects are.\n\nAsk if your child’s condition can be treated in other ways.\n\nKnow why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.\n\nKnow what to expect if your child does not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.\n\nIf your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.\n\nKnow how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice."
