        "text": "Having the coxsackievirus virus during pregnancy may pose a slight risk to your baby. But that’s only if the virus is able to pass through the placenta. The chance of that happening is very small.\n\nHaving the coxsackievirus slightly increases the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth, as is the case with any infection during pregnancy.\n\nHFMD is more risky if the woman acquires the virus near the end of her pregnancy. An infection near delivery carries more risk of stillbirth, or HFMD in the newborn.\n\nThere has also been some evidence that the virus is linked to congenital heart defects and other anomalies in babies. But there’s conflicting data on whether or not the virus definitely causes those problems.\n\nConfusing, I know. But the odds are having the virus doesn’t necessarily mean your baby will suffer later on. Which is good news, indeed.\n\nIf you develop coxsackievirus during pregnancy, talk to your doctor. The chance of potential risks are small, but do your best to prevent being exposed with careful hand washing and avoid exposure.\n\nTake care of yourself first, and rest assured that you’re doing the best you can to take care of your baby in the process.\n\nChaunie Brusie, BSN, is a registered nurse with experience in labor and delivery, critical care, and long-term care nursing. She lives in Michigan with her husband and four young children, and is the author of the book “Tiny Blue Lines.”"
