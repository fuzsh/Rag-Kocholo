        "text": "Graveside services for Charles Heyward Adams, 85, will be held 11:00 a.m. Friday at Old Salem Lutheran Church Cemetery (828 Devils Backbone Road Leesville) with David Riley officiating. The family will receive friends from 5:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. Thursday at Barr-Price Funeral Home and Crematorium, Historic B-L Chapel. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to Pawmetto Lifeline or the Alzheimer’s Association.\n\nMr. Adams passed away Monday, May 27, 2024. Born in Leesville, he was the son of the late Heyward “Shorty” and Annie Mae Kyzer Adams. Charles was one of a kind and a Lake Murray legend (some even called him the Lake Murray Mayor) And if you were lucky enough to know him then you probably knew he lived a vibrant life, he celebrated his 39th birthday for 46 years and he was NEVER wrong. He spent many of his early, professional years in the road for Bowman Transportation which allowed him to create and enjoy his own trucking business in the years to come. Charles was a member of Cedar Grove Lutheran Church and was the owner / operator of Charlie’s Fishermans Wharf for over 40 years where he made colorful memories with friends, family and fellow patrons. He enjoyed many years boating and skiing on the lake and passed that love onto his family. He will truly be missed.\n\nSurviving are daughters, Cindy Adams Capnerhurst (Steve Robison), Charlyn Rene’ Adams (Rick Jones), Melissa Adams Shaw (Randy Shaw); sister, Miriam Shealy; 10 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren and special friends, Martha Garlock and Cheryl Bass. He was predeceased by a sister, Edith Durst Giddens."
