As a doctoral student at McGill University, I was fortunate to work with Steven Huebner and Lars Lih, both of whom have profoundly shaped my approach to music history and the history of Russia. Over the years, they have both read this manuscript several times, offering insightful comments and suggestions, as well as continuous encouragement. While at McGill University, I also had an opportunity to study with Julie Cumming, who enthusiastically supported this research from the very first moment; Roe-​Min Kok, whose seminars inspired my research on Alexander Aliab’ev and Russian music ethnography; Paul Austin of the Slavic Department, who guided me to and through the National Library of Finland; Paul Peters of the German Department, whose seminar on “otherness” in German literature helped me understand similar issues in Russian literature; and Monique Desroches of the Université de Montreal, whose seminar “Methodes de terrains” changed my perspective on western ethnomusicology and stimulated me to do research on the history of Russian ethnomusicology. I am particularly thankful to Lars Lih and Anna Berman for helping me to render properly all the intricacies of Russian-​English translation.

The responses to these talks shaped my thinking on several issues and are reflected throughout the text.\n\nxix\n\nNote on Dates and Transliteration Dates are given in accordance with the Julian calendar (“Old style”), which was used in imperial Russia before the reform of February 1, 1918, and in the nineteenth century was twelve days behind the Gregorian calendar commonly used in the West. The Library of Congress system is used for transliterations from the Cyrillic alphabet, with the exception of commonly accepted spellings of Russian names (e.g. Fyodor Dostoyevsky), words, and places (e.g.Yaroslavl or Yakutia). The soft marks at the ends of Russian words such as mysl or Rus have been removed to avoid confusion with possessive forms of nouns or proper nouns. Because the Soviet national determination policy often introduced artificial borders and eliminated and reorganized a number of ethnic groups and identities, I use the historical names of ethnic groups as they appeared in the official Russian language in the nineteenth century: Little-​Russians instead of Ukrainians, Cheremis instead of Mari, Votiaks instead of Udmurts, Taranchis instead of Uighurs, Sarts instead of Uzbeks, and others. The maps also present the historical names of cities or regions (Tiflis instead of Tbilisi, Eastern Turkestan instead of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China). Unless otherwise indicated, translations from Russian and French are my own.\n\nxxi\n\nIntroduction La Russie repose . . . sur l’Asie. Une frontière sèche d’immense étendue la met en contact avec presque tous les peuples de l’Orient. —​Count Sergei Uvarov, Projet d’une académie asiatique (1810) A Russian is not only European, but also Asian. —​Fyodor Dostoyevsky, “Geok-​Tepe. What Does Asia Mean to Us?” (1881)\n\nT\n\nhe year 1991 brought about major dramatic change on the Eurasian continent with important consequences for world history: along with the collapse and dissolution of the Soviet Union—​one of the world’s largest powers—​and the official end of the Cold War, a number of small independent states suddenly popped up, drastically transforming the geopolitical map of Europe and Asia. Social unrest, interethnic conflicts, and armed clashes on the borders between different republics preceding and following the collapse shocked international observers, who were accustomed to thinking of “the Soviets” as an undifferentiated and monolithic mass of people ideologically opposed to capitalism. Most of “the Soviets” were shocked, too. I still remember one day at the beginning of the school year in 1991: as our seminar on political economy started, all of the students bombarded the professor with simple yet very intricate questions about the significance of the August Coup for Kazakhstan and the future of our country. He responded with a long silence. Some of our inquiries were gradually answered with Kazakhstan’s declaration of independence in December 1991 and the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, some of the questions continued swarming in the back of my mind. With the relaxation of border controls, the demographic landscape of Alma-​ Ata—​my hometown and the capital of Kazakhstan at that time—​changed considerably. Many people who had been exiled during the Stalin era to the Kazakh\n\n2 Representing Russia’s Orient steppe went back to their home countries—​now independent; many others were shown the door, and large numbers of Russians, Germans, and Jewish people left for their “historical homelands.” I did not have one to claim. At the end of the nineteenth century, my ethnic Uighur homeland had been divided between two of the major Eurasian powers: China and Russia.Yet, being raised in the Soviet ethos as a member of an ethnic minority group, I strongly believed that, regardless of ethnicity, I could contribute to the country in which I was born. However, my status as “other”—​immediately apparent to anyone who saw “Uighur” indicated as my “nationality” in my passport—​pursued me until I left for the West. Then, what was burning in my mind immediately following the collapse of the USSR reappeared with new urgency: what is the role of different minority ethnic groups in a multiethnic empire? What part do they play in the formation of the identity and culture of the majority? How does ethnographic knowledge shape cultural policies dealing with minority peoples, and how does it determine, stimulate, or discourage their social and cultural development? These are the questions at the core of this book.\n\nContext The attitude of many Russians toward their Asian neighbors has always been ambiguous and complex. From conquered to conqueror, political ally to economic tyrant, Russia’s role has changed continually.Throughout the nineteenth century, the Russian empire was almost constantly engaged in war with its eastern and southern neighbors. In the first half of that century alone, there were two Russo-​Persian wars (1804–​13, 1826–​28), two Russo-​Turkish wars (1806–​ 12, 1828–​29), and the Caucasian War (1818–​64), also known as the conquest of the Caucasus. In 1853, Russia engaged in the Crimean War, which it lost in 1856. After its humiliating defeat in the south, boosting military confidence became the Russian officials’ first priority; consequently, Russia’s southeastern neighbors—​who possessed relatively inferior armies—​became a coveted object of imperial attention. In the 1860s, Russia engaged in what was later referred to as the Great Game campaign by expanding into Central Asia, an area where Great Britain was also pursuing its own expansionist goals.1 In 1877, irritated by the Muslim-​Christian crisis in the Balkans, Russia declared war on Turkey, a conflict that ended a year later, freeing Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro from Turkish rule, and yielding some parts of the Caucasus to the Russian empire, resulting in an alteration to the balance of power in the east. Unlike Great Britain, France, and other European powers, Russia annexed, subjugated, conquered, and colonized its immediate neighbors (see the map of Russia and its acquisitions by the beginning of the twentieth century in fig. 1.1). Consequently, the separation between the West and the subjugated East has not always been self-​evident, and has often occasioned geographical\n\nFigure 1.1. “Sketch of the acquisitions of Russia in Europe and Central Asia since the accession of Peter 1st to the throne.” 48 × 62 cm.

Discussions about whether or not the Ural Mountains were the natural geographical borders between Europe and Asia filled pages upon pages in journals and books until the end of the nineteenth century.3 The situation was further complicated by the fact that before the sixteenth century, Russia itself had been subject to conquest by its Asian neighbors, and hence a number of Asian linguistic and cultural features were incorporated into, and became an integral part of, Russian identity.4 For this reason, in the eyes of the western European community, Russia was frequently viewed as Asian, which caused a measure of unease among Russians, who had adopted quite distinct approaches to the articulation of their own national identity.5 This book seeks to contextualize the formation and development of Russian musical discourse on Russia’s own eastern and southern “others” in the long nineteenth century.6 It suggests that Russia’s (musical) ethnographies about its Asian and Caucasian neighbors played a pivotal role in the formation and development of Russia’s own musical identity. Situated on the periphery, minority peoples not only defined the geographical boundaries of the empire, its culture, and its music but also defined the boundaries of Russianness itself. Due to this complex pattern in the development of Russian politics and the development of different ideological currents, as well as a transformation in social and cultural life, some Russian composers and writers generated a multidimensional representation of Russia’s “others”: they not only resisted the colonial discourse inferiorizing the conquered peoples but sometimes even embraced an Asian musical identity. Prominent Russian writers, musicians, and artists often broached the issue of Russian Asianness or Easternness and its ambivalent geopolitical and sociocultural position between the East and the West. (I discuss the terms “Asian,” “East,” and “Oriental” later.) At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the future minister of education Count Sergei Uvarov, as the first epigraph suggests, placed Russia within the Asian continent and assigned the growing empire the important task of a systematic study of Russia’s Orient.7 He envisioned Russia establishing a link between European civilization and the “light of Asia,” recognizing the huge economic, political, and geopolitical advantages of the eastern corner of Russia, with its vast adjacent territories as well as its importance for the future Russian national discourse: “the diffusion of eastern languages should also lead to the diffusion of a sound understanding of Asia as it relates to Russia. Here is a great enterprise, still unilluminated by the light of reason, a whole untouched field of glory, a source of a new nationality policy.”8 Later in the century, the famous critic Vladimir Stasov also addressed the Russian–​ Asian issue by including “the oriental [vostochnyi] theme” in his list of four\n\nIntroduction characteristic elements that distinguish Russian music from that of Europe.9 Such a ready and open embrace of oriental identity reveals Stasov’s considerable respect for eastern cultures—​an attitude that a century later Soviet musicologist Viktor Vinogradov would call “oriental patriotism.”10 Not all Russian intellectuals saw Asia in such a favorable light. Some considered the East to be backward, and worthy of imperial attention only because of its geopolitical situation. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, for instance, in his essay composed in 1881 after the fall of a Turkmen fortress at Geok-​Tepe to Russian troops, suggested that Russia should continue its offensive policies in the East to establish total control and absolute prestige in Asia: “let there be a furor. Let the conviction grow among all these millions of peoples, to the very borders of India, and even within India, if you like, of the invincibility of the White Tsar and the omnipotence of his sword.”11 He believed that Asia was not only an arena of political activity in its own right but also the field in which Russia would engage with Europe in its civilizing mission to prove its Europeanness and its ability to make its own independent political decisions.12 Allegorically referring to Russia as the “West’s slave,” and as the “other” that European civilization would never acknowledge as its own (“Europe . . . secretly despises us, and openly considers us as people beneath her, as lower species”), Dostoyevsky called on Russian people to reconsider the empire’s policies in Europe and change their view of Asia as a “financial burden.”13 Asia, according to Dostoyevsky, “might truly serve” as the “future outlet” and would rejuvenate Russia, since its role was similar to that of America: “when we turn to Asia . . . something of the same sort may happen to us as happened to Europe when America was discovered. . . . With our push toward Asia we will have a renewed upsurge of spirit and strength.”14 Paradoxically, Dostoyevsky called for the conquest and subjugation of Asia because it was representing not the “other” but an essential and undeniable part of the Russian “self ”: “Russia is not only in Europe but in Asia as well; because the Russian is not only a European but an Asian as well. . . . We must cast aside this servile fear that Europe will call us Asiatic barbarians and say that we are more Asian than European . . . this mistaken view of ourselves as exclusively Europeans and not Asians (and we have never ceased to be the latter)—​this shame and this mistaken view has cost us dearly, very dearly . . . and we have paid for it by the loss of our spiritual independence.”15 Despite the fact that Dostoyevsky, Stasov, and many other prominent late-​nineteenth-​century Russian writers were aware of the significance of Asia for Russian national self-​definition, little has been said about how the ethnographic knowledge and construction of the Russian Orient contributed to the formation of Russian identity in general, and to music identity in particular. Nineteenth-​century music histories generally treated Russian music and Russia’s Asian music as separate, nonoverlapping categories. Ethnographic encounters with Russia’s eastern or southern “others,” which in some cases\n\n5\n\n6 Representing Russia’s Orient played a crucial role in the creation of a musical work, have hardly been integrated into Russian music history. As a result, the history of Russian music on eastern themes, and the concomitant research on it, offers more questions than answers. Can or could conquerors appropriate and claim the music of the conquered as their own “authentic” national form of expression, and if they did, how did this process unfold? How was Russia’s supremacy in Central Asia translated into ethnographic knowledge and cultural representation of Russia’s Asians? Was the encounter with ethnic minorities, particularly in the east and south, always shaped by official policies? In the Soviet period, only a handful of articles addressed the issue of Russian music with oriental subjects and the influence of ethnographic sources on the musical representation of Asian “others.”16 For obvious reasons, none of them elaborated on the political motivations standing behind Russian “inspiration” by the East.17 More recent Russian studies on eastern subjects in Russian music raise important questions about the dynamics and the methods of assimilation and absorption of some eastern elements into the Russian musical vocabulary.18 However, they do not discuss how Russian ethnographic studies shaped the perception of Russia’s own Orient, and they hardly touch on the role of Russia’s eastern or southern “others” in the creation of Russian musical identity.19 Throughout the Cold War, most western histories of the empire focused on Russia and the Russians, because of extremely restricted access to the archives in Moscow and Leningrad, let alone the archives of the national republics. The few monographs on non-​Russian nationalities and ethnic groups living in the Russian empire, or Russia’s so-​called inorodtsy, were motivated by the Cold War rivalries and hence generally reflected strong biases based on past experiences. Music histories also bear the mark of a period mostly preoccupied with essentializing the myth of Russian uniqueness. In more recent years, Richard Taruskin and Marina Frolova-​Walker have made significant strides in dismantling such myths by reconsidering and reconstructing Russian music as an integral part of the history of western European music, Russian folklore (whether real or imagined), and Russia’s eastern traditions.20 Other writers, too, have taken on the topic of Russian musical Orientalism.21 Still, even in these and other such studies, eastern or southern ethnic minorities, the inorodtsy of the Russian empire, ethnographic sources on them, and their effect on nineteenth-​ century Russian culture and music have not been given serious consideration.22 In addition, most recent studies of Russian music have focused on opera and symphony as the most important manifestations of national thought.23 This book, therefore, seeks to fill an important lacuna in Russian history. If historians have overlooked the impact of ethnographic studies of Russia’s eastern and southern minority peoples in the formation of Russian identity, scholars of Russian repertoire studies have generally neglected the genre that was characteristic of music ethnographies of the time, that is, the art song. Since\n\nIntroduction music and the musical imagination can be shaped by a complex interplay of different social, political, and cultural factors, this research will include study of nineteenth-​century Russian history, the history of the Russian-​Asian and Russian-​Caucasian cultural relationships, and ethnographic research of the time. It will also address the underanalyzed repertoire of Russian folk and art songs evoking sites and peoples from the southern and eastern fringes of the empire, and inorodtsy songs arranged by Russian composers as vocal pieces with piano (or, more rarely, orchestral) accompaniment. Interpreting ethnographic knowledge as a constructive element in Russia’s formation of a multiethnic empire, this study explores how nineteenth-​ century music ethnographies, through the promotion of certain publications and cultural events, served imperialistic ends, enabling the empire to politically, economically, and culturally absorb the conquered lands. Thematically, my research contributes to existing studies that explore the representation of nonwestern societies in the ethnographic literature of western colonial powers, and the musical ramifications and effects of colonial encounters. In this regard, recent studies by Jann Pasler, Bennett Zon, and Nalini Ghuman on the French and British perceptions and representations of nonwestern music—​particularly the way the image of the oriental “other” helped to define the boundaries of musical Frenchness or Englishness—​have guided my inquiries concerning Russian musical representation of its colonial subjects.24 These authors’ insights into the complex intellectual culture of Europe, with its network of interwoven social and anthropological theories of race, development, and civilization, helped me to realize that nineteenth-​century Russian culture was only partly European. One of the most intriguing elements of Russian self-​definition, which set it apart from European identity, was the belief of many Russian intellectuals in the value of their nation’s eastern heritage. Prince Esper Ukhtomskii, Russian diplomat Konstantin Leont’ev, Vladimir Stasov, and many other writers insisted that Russia’s political order (firmly autocratic in nature), strong inclination toward religious mysticism and fatalism, and aversion to western materialism and liberalism, as well as many elements of traditional art and literature (i.e., epics), were fundamentally eastern rather than western in character.25 Because of this belief in Russian cultural (and often racial) mixture with the East, some Russian policy-​makers in St. Petersburg felt that Russia’s advance into Central Asia was absolutely justified; as Prince Ukhtomskii declared: “we are only tightening the bonds between us and that which in reality was always ours.”26 Russian Orientophilia, which originated as cultural and religious affiliation with Asia, thus began as a recognition of what western Russians shared with eastern ones but soon evolved in agreement with the new imperialistic direction of the late nineteenth century: Russia’s special “civilizing mission” in Asia. In this context, the mission in the East involved imposing a western notion of “civility” (grazhdanstvennost) on\n\n7\n\n8 Representing Russia’s Orient local peoples in order to create a unifying identity based on duties, obligations, subservience, and commitment to labor.27 In this book, I have not set out to reconstruct a comprehensive history of Russian cultural encounters with the East, as reflected in diverse images and musical representations, nor will I attempt to create and promote a singular and unified model of Russian representations of inorodtsy. Instead I focus on (often contradictory) case studies of various experiences and multifaceted ideas related to nineteenth-​century Russian–​Asian musical encounters. I seek to place Russia’s musical encounters with its own Orient within the realm of everyday practice, and to investigate the link between specialized knowledge and Russian power in a particular historical context. Each musical encounter is unique yet simultaneously representative of larger societal trends of the time. By treating each situation individually, I hope to provide fresh insights into the changing and challenging nature of the theory, creation, and practice of nineteenth-​century Russia’s musical representation of its oriental subjects.\n\nEdward Said and Russian Orientalism In his deeply influential but highly contested Orientalism, Edward Said hardly mentions Russia or Russian practices of Orientalism.28 However, the underlying premise of the interdependence of the political and cultural dimensions of Orientalism, as interpreted by Said, cannot and should not be completely disregarded in Russian studies of culture, and musical culture in particular.29 By studying Russian Orientalism, we gain a new understanding of Orientalism as global, western force and can better understand how specialized knowledge of Russia’s own Orient shaped state policies. For the past three decades, scholars of Russian studies have been debating the applicability of the Saidean model of “Orientalism” and questioning whether “colonial forms of knowledge” also emerged in the Russian context. While some scholars have embraced Said’s ideas rather uncritically, others have denied their relevance, pointing to Russia’s particularity as a simultaneously European and non-​European country.30 Some have questioned the rigidity of Said’s East–​West binary opposition when it comes to nineteenth-​century Russian literature and ethnography. Susan Layton, Nathaniel Knight, and Harsha Ram suggest replacing this dichotomy with a political and cultural “trichotomy” involving the West, and the East, and Russia—or the colonizer, the colonized, and an “ambiguous third element” presented as a Romantic artist, official agent, ethnographer, or writer who had ambivalent feelings about joining either side.31 In my analysis of Russian discourse on nonwestern music, I turn instead to the complex, multifaceted nature of the Russian relationship with Russia’s own Orient, a relationship in which Russians were most often influenced by—but sometimes rejected themselves—the politically\n\nIntroduction driven discourses on “others.”While some Russian writers participated actively in a Russian–​western dialogue on Russia’s mission civilisatrice, others, aware of Russia’s own hybridity as a nation, disagreed with traditional prejudices and concepts, including the distinction between the “self ” and the “other.” Many scholars highlight examples that reveal exemplary behavior toward Russian ethnic minorities. For instance, Vera Tolz observes that at the turn of the nineteenth century, a formidable group of Russian academics opposed an official state discourse on the government’s civilizing mission in the East and South with its agenda of cultural Russification and tried to defend the cultural heritage of the newly acquired peoples.32 Many Asians who in the 1870s and 1880s were treated as “native informants”—​those who helped Russians to comprehend the life of their own minority group—​later were encouraged to become scholars in their own right. David Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, in his book on Russian Orientalism, also argues that Russian imperial and colonial encounters in the south and east often resulted in sympathetic representations of inorodtsy in Russian writings, poetry, and art, from the reign of Peter the Great (1682–​1725) to the Revolution of 1917.33 Schimmelpenninck’s investigation of the field of Russian Oriental Studies, or vostokovedenie, also reveals that in the first half of the nineteenth century, Russian scholarship was marked by profound esteem for the cultures of Russia’s own Orient and a protective stance toward Russia’s eastern minority peoples. Consequently, to avoid Said’s politically charged definition of Orientalism as an academic discipline intent on serving imperial ends, some Russian scholars have offered a useful distinction between Orientalism as an attitude and orientology as a discipline.34 I am inclined toward a less narrow interpretation of the Orientalism of pre-​Saidean times, so in this study I will use the terms “Orientalism” or “Orientalist” as neutral terms that do not carry negative connotations, except when used in phrases with negative determiners, such as “stereotype,” or “attitude.” Occasional uses of the words “orientology” or “orientologist” will refer exclusively to Russian studies of the Orient or their practitioners. In addition, the English nouns “the Orient” and “the East” both translate into Russian as the same term: the Vostok. Russia’s notion of Vostok has included not only the part of the world that is to the east of Central Russia but also the regions to the south, the Caucasus, and the Middle and Far East, as well as all of Asia, northern Africa, and some countries west of Russia, such as Spain (because of its connection with the Moorish culture). In this respect, Russian writers followed the French literary tradition that assigned Spain a special niche due to its particular relationship with the Moorish arts and visual culture. In my translations from Russian, wherever it is impossible to define whether the author meant the English terms “the East” or “the Orient,” I have translated Vostok or vostochnyi as “the Orient” or “oriental” without any reference to the Saidean Orient; rather, this translation indicates the Russian generalized\n\n9\n\n10 Representing Russia’s Orient concept that includes lands and cultures outside the European Russia and the western worlds. Not all scholars have been convinced of Russia’s uniqueness and its relatively lenient approach to its oriental (vostochnyi) subjects. In more recent studies of Russian Orientalism, some researchers have pointed out that the factor of territorial contiguity should not be considered an essential element differentiating the Russian empire from other maritime European colonial states. In the nineteenth century, a journey from Paris to Algiers or from London to Calcutta would have taken less time than travel from St. Petersburg to Tashkent.35 Other scholars argue that in eastern Russia, just as in any other European colony, the link between the ethnographic knowledge produced by government officials and its impact on colonial policies and attitudes toward its oriental subjects did exist.36 In Russian Turkestan, for instance, some Orientalists who served the colonial regime suggested that the hierarchy of peoples within the imperial frontiers (dividing local populations into two categories of not-​very-​religious nomads and religiously devoted settled peoples) instigated, as Alexander Morrison puts it, “Islamophobic paranoia,” which stigmatized Turkestan’s settled Muslims as “fanatical,” and influenced imperial policies by ensuring military control over the region.37 Perhaps an even more striking fact influenced Russia’s studies of its Orient: many orientologists, writers, artists, and composers in Russia began their careers as military officers and administrators in the eastern fringes of the empire, and their views and writings on the conquered Asians confirm a number of prejudices and stigmas circulating among the imperial ruling elite in Central Asia and Transcaucasia.38 Thus, despite the appreciation of “oriental” art and culture discussed by Tolz, Schimmelpenninck, and Knight, recent studies clearly indicate that frequently only certain ancient oriental cultures were valued and highly regarded by the Russian intelligentsia.As is often true with European imperial powers, interest in an Asian people’s imagined past did not entail an acknowledgment of their current predicament.39 Throughout the nineteenth century, the distinction between the dominant and the dominated in Russian literature and arts remained apparent through the use of language dividing all imperial subjects into Russians (including Belorussians and Little-​Russians) and inorodtsy. Inorodtsy (sing. inorodets) was a legal term used in imperial Russia to refer to non–​ethnically Russian people; it literally means “of different descent” and was mostly applied to the indigenous populations of Siberia, Central Asia, the North Caucasus, and the Far East. Throughout this book I use this term to signal Russia’s eastern or southern “others.”40 For most Russian Asians, the term inorodtsy implied the official denial of their right to full citizenship, as their biological and physiological characteristics were considered irrevocable.41 Hence, before initiating an investigation into Russian musical repertoire with oriental subjects, it is essential to raise some fundamental questions concerning\n\nIntroduction the unequal nature of these power relations. In this context, Said’s theory of cultural imperialism and the political implications of European art with an oriental subject cannot be simply embraced or rejected, due to the complex, diverse, evolving, and frequently contradictory yet fascinating nature of Russian cultural relationships with its own Orient. The debate over the Russian image of the Orient is more than just a discussion of the relevance of Said’s ideas to Russia. It is also a window into broader political, social, and cultural issues relating to the formation of the Russian empire, since several important nineteenth-​century phenomena interacted with Russian representations of the East. One of the issues revolves around the increasing urgency of the problem of cultural self-​definition, instigated by the growth of European nationalism.42 In a broader context, Said, speaking with reference to European Orientalism, pointed out that the East “has helped to define Europe,” “being a surrogate and even underground self,” thereby stressing the importance of the Orient for the construction of national identity in Europe.43 Building on Said’s important observation,Vera Tolz claims that nineteenth-​century Russian Orientalist scholars were influenced by the “pervasive impact of nationalism on European scholarship” and strove for “nation-​building . . . rather than imperial domination of the minorities by the Russians.”44 In Russian music studies, Marina Frolova-​Walker also has observed a link between nationalism and Orientalism. She argues that many educated Russians, including Milii Balakirev and Vladimir Stasov, used oriental style to assert their national identity and to set Russian music apart from that of western Europe.45 Other scholars, such as Richard Taruskin, Taisiia Shcherbakova, and Izabella Belen’kaia, also have remarked that the Russian “other” in literature and arts often existed for the sake of self-​construction.46 This may be why in their intense search for a Russian musical identity, many Russian composers paradoxically represented eastern or western peoples more often than Russians in their music.47 At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the emergence of an aggressive or expansive type of nationalism in the Caucasus coincided with the rise of Russian Romantic literature, which rendered the public particularly sensitive to eastern literary subjects. Because of imperial advances in the Caucasus in the first half of the century, Russia’s East was more properly the South—​the regions of Crimea, Georgia, and the Caucasus. In Russian literature, these regions were presented through two diametrically opposing images: (1) violent Muslims resisting Russian rule, and (2) areas of beautiful nature and fashionable spas that were created for the use of Russian upper classes and army officers. Some early-​nineteenth-​century Russian literary men romanticized the brutal reality of warfare in the Caucasus, while others—​who traveled to the region against their will as convicts of the Decembrist revolt—​expressed their ambivalent feelings about the inhumanity of war. This, as Susan Layton observes, resulted\n\n11\n\n12 Representing Russia’s Orient in tensions between the Russian state’s mission to pacify and civilize its Muslim subjects in the Caucasus and the Romantic representation of these same peoples as noble savages whose extermination and inhuman treatment troubled many representatives of the Russian intelligentsia.48 Imperialism was another important element that influenced Russia’s approach to its Asian inorodtsy in the late nineteenth century.When the Russian empire stretched its borders to the Far East and embraced the vast territories in Central Asia in the 1860s–​1870s, it became evident that the representation of Russia as a multinational and multicultural state became not just desirable, but the only possible way to assert official power in the imperial periphery. As many scholars have observed, local authorities in the regions remote from the center (such as Turkestan or Siberia) often found themselves in situations where the official aims (e.g., Russification or spreading the Orthodox faith) were in contradiction with the goals of imperialism. In order to live peacefully with its own Vostok, and transform its people into loyal Russian citizens ready to be integrated and exploited in the larger imperial context, it was imperative that local officials recognize minorities’ distinctiveness and tolerate their ethnic, cultural, and religious diversity.49 These national(ist), imperial, and cultural concerns played an important role in the formation and development of Orientalism and orientology in nineteenth-​century Russia, and marked Russia’s particular engagement with the ethnographic and musical dimensions of its East.\n\nFramework Many histories about the Russian empire follow major events related to its expansion in Asia and Caucasus.They start with the accession of Alexander I or the year of Russia’s incorporation of Georgia into the empire (in 1801) and often end with the 1917 Revolution.This book proposes a related periodization, but one based on musical rather than political events. It begins in the 1820s with the early art songs of Alexander Aliab’ev, coinciding with the launch of the long military campaign in the Caucasus and the Decembrist revolt, and ends in the 1910s with the publication of the piano harmonizations of Russia’s Asian folk songs in the last volume of Trudy muzykal’no-​etnograficheskoi komissii sostoiashchei pri etnograficheskom otdele Imperatorskogo Obshchestva Liubitelei Estestvoznaniia, Antropologii, i Etnografii [The Works issued by the Music-​ Ethnographic Committee of the Society of Friends of Natural History, Anthropology, and Ethnography]. Thus, the book spans a little less than a century, during which the vast Eurasian territory was transformed from a distant frontier into an integral part of the Russian empire. The two parts of this book are thematically subdivided into six chapters that follow a more or less chronological progression. The first three chapters, part I, examine the cultural and historical context in which Russia’s\n\nIntroduction nineteenth-​century images of its own Orient emerged. These chapters consider Russian folk songs with eastern and southern subjects as well as Russian (music) ethnographies on inorodtsy and the contemporary secondary literature discussing both Russian and non-​Russian folk songs. Part II addresses the ways Russian composers turned transcriptions of simple (and thus presumably “authentic”) Asian and Caucasian folk melodies into aesthetically refined art songs or into folk song arrangements with elaborate piano accompaniments, drawing on ethnographers’ work but also rendering these melodies accessible to a wider audience of Russian professional and amateur musicians. The purpose of this book is not to discuss the entire massive and multifaceted repertoire of Russian art songs with exotic subjects. Rather, I want to trace the transition from music ethnography to art songs and investigate how Russian musical sources about its inorodtsy contributed to the formation and creation of Russia’s imperial identity and representation of its own Orient. Hence, a fair number of nineteenth-​century art songs with oriental subjects are not addressed because they were not based on any ethnographic sources or because they did not refer to inorodtsy. These include early-​nineteenth-​century art songs by Ludwig Wilhelm Maurer (“Circassian” and “Tatar” songs), Iosif Genishta (“Circassian Song”), and Vladimir Odoevskii (“Tatar Song”); well-​known mid-​nineteenth-​ century art songs by Alexander Dargomyzhsky (“Lezghin Song,” “Vertograd,” “Ty rozhdena vosplameniat’,” and “O deva-​roza, ia v okovakh”); and Anton Rubinstein’s cycle of Persian Songs (1854), as well as late-​nineteenth-​century oriental art songs by Cesar Cui, Anatolii Liadov, Sergei Liapunov, Alexander Glazunov, and many others.50 Chapter 1 examines how some medieval war encounters with Russia’s eastern enemies engendered pejorative images of oriental “others” in the repertoire of Russian bylinas (epic narratives) as well as soldiers’ and children’s songs, and how, throughout the nineteenth century, Russian folk song collections promoted Russian stereotypes about oriental savagery, barbarism, and brutality. Significantly, these songs appeared not only during the wars with Russia’s southern and eastern neighbors but also during the time when the empire was torn apart by internal conflicts that threatened its integrity. Mapping the publication of Russian folk song collections against Russia’s nineteenth-​century social unrest reveals that the denigrating representation of “others” on the one hand helped to cover up internal problems, conflicts, and disorder by displacing anger onto Russia’s neighbors and on the other facilitated the manipulation of public opinion in favor of the empire’s ideology of expansion. The ethnic stereotyping of bloodthirsty Chechens, militant Turks, and barbarian Tatars that was inscribed in the popular language of Russian folk songs, bylinas, and historical songs more often than not was dictated by intensifying nationalist and imperial concerns for which the very existence of a malicious “other” helped to define a flawless and united “self.”\n\n13\n\n14 Representing Russia’s Orient Denial and denigration of “others,” however, was not dominant in all nineteenth-​century culture. Although most publications aimed at a wide readership seemed to belittle Russian eastern and southern neighbors and emphasize the difference between the “other” and the “self,” some ethnographic sources revealed a sympathetic attitude towards the newly acquired eastern subjects and highlighted the similarities between Russian and Asian cultures. This wide range of attitudes toward and representations of inorodtsy resulted from the different agendas of the various official agencies commissioning ethnographic research. Chapter 2 focuses on the works and endeavors of Russian ethnographers and amateur writers (military, academic, and musical). It distinguishes three specific categories of writings targeting different publics: (1) publications, intended for wide circulation, that denigrated oriental culture, intensifying the long-​standing antagonism between “us” and “them”; (2) works written for Russian officials and military agents that followed paternalistic patterns; and (3) ethnographic literature written for and by orientologists. The first two types were written by amateur ethnographers who were interested in Russia’s inorodtsy and who wrote down their ethnographic observations in situ, while performing other official duties related to administrative work or army service. The third type—​probably the most diverse in nature and the most interesting for my purposes—​contributed many elements to the formation of a specifically Russian type of ethnography about oriental “others.” Some of its most important agents—​the pro-​German faction in the Russian Geographical Society, ethnographers working in political exile, and researchers of Asian origin—​influenced the creation of a decisively sympathetic depiction of Russia’s inorodtsy. Two of the most strikingly enthusiastic views of Russia’s Asian minorities and their music are exemplified in the writings of Alexander Middendorff, a passionate Baltic Russian orientologist who studied the Gilyak peoples living in the Amur region, and August Eichhorn, a native German musician with Russian citizenship who spent over a decade in Tashkent, serving as kapellmeister of a Russian military orchestra. My study of Middendorf ’s and Eichhorn’s ethnographies of Russia’s inorodtsy in the most remote regions of Siberia and Central Asia reveals that despite the fact that both writers certainly enjoyed their privileged positions in relation to the local population, their attitudes toward the music of Russian Asians were not filtered through Russian nationalist claims of cultural superiority over the subjugated peoples.51 Chapter 3 addresses fin-​de-​siècle music theories discussing Russian and Asian musical scales and instruments. For many Russians, “Asia” presented an imagined space east of the Ural Mountains and southeast of the Caspian Sea, a homogenized land defined broadly as referring to the vast territory of the Eurasian landmass, South and Southeast Asia, and Siberia and the Far East. Most Russian musical treatises essentialized “Asia” by not recognizing the continent’s enormous cultural, historical, social, and confessional complexity. Furthermore,\n\nIntroduction they often confused the term “Asian” with “Aryan,” following Russian intellectuals’ assumptions that one of the most ancient Aryan branches was represented by the Scythian tribes, who inhabited Central Asia.52 In their own version of Aryanism, Russian intellectuals envisioned the Scythians as being closely related to the ancient Slavs and used this link to assert both Russia’s Scythian-​ Aryan essence and, by extension paradoxically, its Asianness and Europeanness at the same time. Drawing on theoretical treatises by Petr Sokal’skii and Alexander Famintsyn that allege a link between Russian and “Asian” or “Aryan” musical cultures, I suggest that their writings reflected the ideology of Aryanism and the so-​ called Vostochniki (Easterners or Asianists) movement, which promoted an idea of Russia’s close affiliation with “Asian” or “Aryan” culture. These two writers believed that Russian folk song—​which, in passing, they also essentialized by reducing its complexity to a European system of scales and modes—​ was uncorrupted by European “art music” and preserved the ancient Aryan musical system, that is, a pentatonic scale, in its pure form.This myth of cultural purity, which is distinct from the western European myth of racial purity formulated in the mid-​nineteenth century by French writer Arthur de Gobineau, was most likely fostered for political reasons.53 After the 1877 Russo-​Turkish War and the Congress of Berlin, which undermined Russia’s reputation in the international arena by disavowing Russia’s victory over the Ottoman empire and diminishing its gains in the region, the theme of cultural and political resistance against western powers particularly appealed to Russian readers.54 On the one hand the supposition that the western European musical system of tonality had not influenced Russian folk songs could have been interpreted as evidence of Russia’s political potency and resistance against the West.55 On the other hand “finding” a Russian Asian or Aryan cultural heritage had its darker side: it served the empire’s expansionist ends in Central Asia, because many Asianists believed that they had to advance into the region to liberate the remnant Aryan tribes from “Turanians,” or other Asian Islamic and Turkic peoples, frequently depicted as “barbaric and eternally decadent.”56 In addition, analysis of Russian sources that discuss Russian and Asian musical instruments reveals that despite the high esteem in which Russians held ancient Asian culture, the view of the modern Asia, or the Orient in general, was not free from cultural stereotypes. Much of the Russian scholarship on musical instruments suggests that Russians followed the French categorization of the instruments and cultural values attached to each instrumental group, which implied the notion of western superiority and oriental inferiority.57 Admiring the Asian past, Russians often denied its potential to develop in the future.58 However, a few sources dealing with Russian, Asian, and oriental instruments (Mikhail Petukhov and Alexander Maslov) prove that exceptions to this norm did exist. They attest that the assumption of the superiority of western culture was\n\n15\n\n16 Representing Russia’s Orient not shared by all Russian musicians, and that some writers on music valued modern Asian culture. In this book, I thus place in dialogue these varying and contradictory attitudes and approaches to the study and representation of the music of the Russian East. Part II traces the development of Russian art song with eastern or southern subjects, along with arrangements of inorodtsy folk songs for piano and voice, and scrutinizes the ways Russian composers’ cultural and musical encounters with the Russian Orient shaped their formation of musical representations. Chapter 4 presents the history of early-​nineteenth-​century Russian view of the Orient through the prism of two major events: the insurrection of the Russian aristocracy against Nicholas I, retrospectively called the “Decembrist revolt,” and the advance of the Russian army in the Caucasus. Most of the chapter is devoted to the life and works of Alexander Aliab’ev, whose compositions with Caucasian or Asian subjects were significantly influenced by Decembrist literature, characterized by its favorable attitude toward the rebellious spirit of the Caucasian mountaineers. Aliab’ev, after being falsely accused of murder and exiled first to Tobol’sk and then to Orenburg (a city on the border of Russia’s Asia), had direct cultural and musical encounter with Russia’s inorodtsy. This encounter resulted in both the integration of some elements of Asian music and the incorporation of the Decembrists’ sympathies toward the Caucasian rebels into his art songs. By associating the subjugated mountaineers with the Decembrists, Aliab’ev challenged the dualism in perception of “us” and “them” and created a new musical language, which I call “Decembrist Orient.” In addition, in some art songs with Decembrist subtexts, he allowed the “other” to be the “other,” or to express its “otherness” through music by using syllabic stresses that were incorrect in Russian, in imitation of peculiar pronunciations or accents that were characteristic of Caucasian music or language. Another case study, presented in ­chapter 5, demonstrates syncretism in representations of the eastern “other” and the Russian “self ” among the members of the Balakirev circle, best known as the Mighty Five—Moguchaia Kuchka (or simply the Kuchka). It explores how this group incorporated oriental melodies and rhythms available through European publications or transcribed by Balakirev into their own musical compositions. Since Balakirev played the most prominent role in the formation of the young cohort of Russian nationalist musicians, this chapter focuses on his approach to the oriental subject. A relatively careful ethnographer, he did not entirely invent his musical Orient. Rather, his art songs with oriental (vostochnyi) subjects reflect the sounds (the melodic and rhythmic elements) he heard and transcribed while traveling in Russia’s South. Various factors—​including deep respect for the peoples living in the Caucasus, his openness to learning about their culture and music, and his will to create music distinct from that of western Europe—​stimulated Balakirev’s musical Orient and inspired him and the members of his circle\n\nIntroduction to include some characteristic features of inorodtsy music into compositions intended to represent the Russian “self.” Chapter 6 focuses on the activity of the Muzykal’no-​Etnograficheskaia Komissiia (Music-​Ethnographic Committee or MEK, which organized a series of “Ethnographic Concerts” (1893–​1911) in Moscow. An analysis of concert programs, folk song arrangements, as well as a close reading of the MEK’s meeting protocols, official releases, and publications, reveals that the members of the MEK aimed to increase awareness of the music culture of Russia’s inorodtsy among the wider Russian population and recontextualize inorodtsy culture in the narrative of the growing empire. The MEK’s interest in Russia’s eastern or southern “other” was part of Russian officials’ broader endeavor at national self-​definition as a unified multiethnic state. According to the 1897 census, only 44 percent of the empire’s population used Russian as a native language.59 This was clearly reflected in the structure of the first ethnographic concert. The beginning and the end of the concert presented Russian music (professional and folk song arrangements), while in the middle, Russian musicians performed the folk song arrangements of a dozen different ethnic groups living in Russia’s western, southern, and eastern domains. Russian music, thus, encompassed the culture of Russia’s inorodtsy. The composers who created arrangements for the MEK’s concerts also contributed to the idea of Russia as an assemblage of many distinct yet unified peoples. My analysis of Russian inorodtsy folk songs arranged by Nikolai Klenovskii, Alexander Gretchaninov, and Reinhold Glière demonstrates that they often deliberately presented a domesticated image of Russia’s “others” by stressing in the accompaniment the elements that in the nineteenth century were associated with Russianness—​the Dorian mode, avoidance of the leading note, and specific harmonic progressions. Thus, at the end of the nineteenth century, two opposing ideologies circulating in Russian society helped to shape a wide variety of Russians’ attitudes toward their oriental neighbors. At one end of the spectrum, there were many Russians—​particularly the orientologists—​who supported the ideology, policy, and practice of preserving and collecting cultural artifacts (including music) of Russia’s inorodtsy and the promotion of their national pride. At the other end of the spectrum, there were those who wholeheartedly endorsed the ideology of imperialism that viewed Russia’s eastern subjects as “underdeveloped.” These imperialists consequently supported the policy of linguistic and cultural assimilation of Russia’s ethnic minorities. Between these two extremes, as I will show, there was a wide range of often contradictory ideas, judgments, opinions, and attitudes toward the “other.” The legacy of imperial Russia, with its sophisticated patterns of political and cultural policies in the East, survived the 1917 Revolution and persisted into the Soviet period. Many ethnographers who served at imperial institutions were hired after the Revolution to reevaluate and seek new information about\n\n17\n\n18 Representing Russia’s Orient the lands and peoples of the former Russian empire, thereby influencing the cultural policies and production of new Soviet national cultures. It is my hope that by investigating developments in the field of ethnography in nineteenth-​ century Russia and the field impact on musical representations of the Orient, we can go beyond broad generalities of Russian–​Asian cultural contacts. As Russian leaders, composers, and ethnographers came to grips with the multiethnic character of the empire and its fluctuating identity, musical Russianness emerged as something far more complex and deeply rooted in imperial ideology than we have yet understood.\n\nChapter 1\n\nUnveiling Tradition Oriental “Others” in Nineteenth-​Century Russian (Folk) Song Collections\n\nF\n\nor many centuries, the history of Russia—​from the Kievan Rus to the present day—​was interwoven with the history of the Eurasian steppe, or the land that stretches from modern Moldavia through Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan.1 Frequently connected by political, commercial, or marital ties, Russian peoples—​from commoners to elites—​often coexisted peacefully with their Asian neighbors (the Khazars, Pechenegs, and Polovtsians, or Cumans). Many Russians were familiar with Asian geography, society, customs, language, and politics.2 Some representatives of the Muscovite tsars had been collaborating with representatives of the Golden Horde since the fourteenth century, seeking their assistance in the destructive raids against Moscow’s rival, Tver. Gradually, the Muscovite rulers borrowed the Mongol military organization, customs tax, postal system, procedures and etiquette in diplomacy, and bureaucratic apparatus.3 Many members of Russia’s upper classes, and even members of the ruling family (including the well-​known Ivan the Terrible and the lesser known prince of Yaroslavl, Fedor Rostislavich, and the first prince of Moscow, Iurii Danilovich), had familial ties to their Asian neighbors.4 Despite these connections, some Russian cities and villages also experienced military encounters with Asian nomadic tribes who, unfortunately for their adversaries, were quite powerful in the early history of the steppe. At the beginning of the thirteenth century, the Mongols and their Asian allies, generically called “Tatars,” swept out of the east and conquered most of the territory of what was then named Kievan Rus. This invasion of Asian hordes in 1237 (later called the “Tatar” or “Mongol Yoke”), under the leadership of Batu, a grandson of Genghis Khan, has been interpreted as one of the most dramatic events of Russian history.5 It was followed by nearly 150 years of Mongol rule (1239–​1380) that left a deep mark on Russia’s collective memory. This was the first and only time in history when all of Russia was subjugated by an invader and disintegrated\n\n20 Representing Russia’s Orient as a political entity, losing political control over most of its territories and becoming a part of the Golden Horde. Early Russian Christian chronicles represented this traumatic experience, and the Tatars or Mongols who caused it, in two opposing ways: first, the Asian hordes were presented as “instruments of God” sent to punish the Russians for their sins, and second, they were “instruments of the Devil”—and Russian redemption, in this case, would have to result in the invaders’ demise.6 Yet some historians—​especially the proponents of Eurasianism, such as George Vernadsky and Lev Gumilev—​have suggested that the scale of the destruction brought by Mongol invasion was not as devastating as certain sources propose; many cities, such as Novgorod, Rostov, Tver, and Yaroslavl, even remained intact. As Vernadsky and other historians explain it, this was because the primary objective of the Golden Horde’s rulers in Rus (and in other lands) was not the destruction of cities and subjects but the resources provided by them in the form of tribute, gifts, and commercial items. The Mongols did not settle in Russian lands and did not directly interfere in quotidian matters, preferring to control the region through the Rus princes themselves. In addition, they demonstrated respect and tolerance for all religious institutions, including the Orthodox Church: they never imposed any foreign belief on Russians and even granted special privileges to Orthodox priests, monks, and laypeople associated with the church, exempting them from taxation and military conscription.7 Moreover, many Russian princes, such as Alexander Nevskii, Fedor Rostislavich, Dmitrii Donskoi, and the princes of the Rurik dynasty, often cooperated with the khans, or rulers, of the Golden Horde to achieve recognition within their own dynasties or to get military backing against their western neighbors (the Swedes, Germans, Lithuanians, Poles, and Hungarians).8 As Tatar-​Mongol domination slowly receded over a long period of time, Russia’s strong economic and political ties with the steppe remained.9 In 1380, Prince Dmitrii Donskoi first defeated the Tatar army at Kulikovo Field.10 One century later, Ivan III renounced Tatar suzerainty and refused to pay tribute.11 In 1552, Ivan IV, known as Ivan the Terrible, conquered the capital city of the Kazan Khanate and then, in 1556, the Astrakhan Khanate, or state. From the mid-​sixteenth century onward, Russia started gaining political and economic power over its eastern neighbors. At the end of the seventeenth century, Peter the Great initiated a series of military campaigns on the Black Sea, which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire in the south.The conquest of the south was completed over the course of a century by Catherine the Great, who expanded Russia to the shores of the Black Sea and incorporated the vast steppes of present-​day southern Ukraine. In the nineteenth century, Russian rulers continued expanding to the south and east, constantly warring with either Turkey or Persia, or in the Caucasus and Central Asia. By the end of the nineteenth century, Russian empire-​builders had established political, economic, and cultural control over the massive Eurasian region.12\n\nUnveiling Tradition Marked by a number of wars on Russia’s eastern and southern borders, the popular Russian view of Asia was reflected in a vast repertoire of epics and folk songs. The traditional perception of the Mongol conquest in Russian literature was a simple and repulsive one. As many modern historians point out, although Russian medieval scribes never addressed the issue of Russia’s true status under the Golden Horde and contemporary Russian narratives did not reveal any special hostility toward the Mongols, later Russian historians presented the Asians as “an elemental destructive force animated only by greed and blood-​ lust . . . leaving only ruins in their wake.”13 The “Tatars”—​that is, all Turkic-​ speaking peoples (Kumans, Keraits, Merkits, Naimans, Nogais, etc.), who were conquered by the Mongols and then established themselves as the military and political elite of the Mongol empire—​were vilified. The term “Tatar” was used in the bylina tradition to label a generic villain and later was applied even to Poles and Lithuanians.14 In this chapter I explore how the publication and promotion of certain folk song collections with pejorative representations of Russia’s eastern and southern neighbors in the nineteenth century generated hostile attitudes toward them and was used to direct public opinion in two effective ways: first, to draw attention to the empire’s policy of expansion in the East, and second, to help camouflage internal conflicts that shook Russian society throughout the century by displacing anger onto the Russian–​Eastern conflicts.15 In the Russian context, the eastern “other,” represented in folk song collections published throughout the nineteenth century, evoked a territorially, politically, and culturally integrated Russian community, united in the face of external danger—​an image that never corresponded to reality. To a certain extent, these common external enemies, against whom many Russian soldiers had fought for centuries, helped to bring Russia’s diverse ethnic, religious, and social groups together. In addition, the cult of wars and military victories that became a dominant form of national myth-​making in the period between the Crimean War of 1853 and the Russo-​Turkish War of 1877 allowed for the people’s involvement in public affairs and conjured an image of unity between ruler and nation. The war imagery that was pervasive in literature from the 1860s helped Russian thinkers to prepare the ground for the brutal Russification policies of the late nineteenth century and contributed to the aggressive character of twentieth-​ century Russian nationalism.16 It would be an exaggeration, however, to state that unification, however imagined or desired, was the only motive behind the publication of these folk song collections. The contemptuous depiction of the East also participated in establishing the idea of Russia as a western empire. In this case, Edward Said’s argument that “the Orient has helped to define Europe (or the West) as its contrasting image, idea, personality, experience” can certainly be applied to the Russian context.17 Besides the East–​West dichotomy presented by Said,\n\n21\n\n22 Representing Russia’s Orient other dichotomies relating to social, religious, gender, and economic divisions functioned simultaneously in imperial Russia and played an important role in the formation of Russian identity, informing the texts’ content of traditional songs. I will not address all of the constituents of this intricate pattern of the evolution of folk song, nor will I provide a comprehensive history of its literary, historical, social, and economic aspects. Instead, I will examine just one of these facets: folk song’s relation to internal conflicts (Russia’s social and religious division) and to external wars against Russia’s southern or eastern neighbors. At least three literary-​musical genres—​bylinas, historical songs, and children’s songs that existed in oral culture long before the nineteenth century—​were subjected to ideological manipulation with regard to eastern adversaries. In the section that follows, I will consider how images of Asians and Caucasians in Russian traditional culture evolved over time, and how the nineteenth-​century publication of these songs promoted the nationalist ideals of unification and Russia’s territorial integrity. bylinas\n\nA bylina (pl. byliny) is a traditional Russian epic song or narrative poem, originated among the early Eastern Slavs of Kievan Rus. It recounts the lives of Russian heroes and events that took place in a remote or mythical past. The word bylina itself comes from the Russian byl, a word that signifies a narrative of real as opposed to fictional events. In the vast repertoire of the bylinas, the most popular is the “Kievan cycle,” which describes events involving heroes and others gathered around Prince Vladimir that took place in or near Kiev (in the same way the Knights of the Round Table gathered around King Arthur).18 Kiev, after its Christianization in 988–​989 and before its fall to Batu Khan in 1240, was one of the wealthiest cities of medieval Europe, richer and more prosperous than Paris or London at the time. The trade routes from Scandinavia to Byzantium and from Central Asia and the Far East to western Europe passed through the Kievan Rus territory.19 Since several steppe confederations, including the Khazar state, the Pechenegs, and the Polovtsians (also known as Cumans), bordered Kiev on the southeastern side, epics of the Kievan cycle portray conflicts between these nomadic peoples and the warriors of Kievan Rus. Many Russian researchers who follow the historical school of Russian bylinas scholarship suggest that Kievan bylinas represent real people and places.20 Indeed, in early bylinas one can find the names of different Polovtsian khans, such as Konchack, Sharukhan, and Sugri, appeared in bylinas as Kon’shik, Kudrevan, Shark-​velikan, and Skurla.21 The name Batyga unquestionably represents Batu Khan (also called Khan Batyi);22 the name Tugarin Zmeevich, against whom Alesha Popovich fights, probably originated form the Cumans’ khan Tugorkhan, who repeatedly attacked Kievan Rus.23 Early encounters with\n\nUnveiling Tradition Tatars, such as the battle on Kalka in 1225 and the Tatar invasion in 1239–​40, are echoed in bylinas about the Kalin-​tsar, Batyga, and Idolishche.24 The connections between the names and places evoked in bylinas and historical events, however tenuous or fragile they might seem, gave an impression of realism and enhanced credibility to the stories the bylinas told. The nineteenth-​century audiences who read the printed texts of bylinas believed that their representations of Asian adversaries corresponded to reality. Some bylinas were even published in collections of historical songs, obscuring the distinction between these two different genres of oral tradition.25 Historical songs are usually associated with events and names from the relatively recent past that can be historically verified. Bylinas on the other hand narrated a remote past (such as the Mongol conquest of Kievan Rus) that had been embellished with fantasy and hyperbole.26 It is noteworthy that in the nineteenth century, the publication of the two most famous bylina collections—​Kirsha Danilov’s Collection of Ancient Russian Poems and Pavel Rybnikov’s Songs Collected by P. N. Rybnikov—​coincided, respectively, with the time of Russia’s war with its eastern and southern neighbors and with the time when internal conflicts were tearing Russian society apart. The earliest printed fragments of bylinas appeared at the end of the eighteenth century in song collections compiled by Mikhail Chulkov and Vasilii Trutovskii.27 However, the first publication that left a truly deep mark on the Russian psyche was the anthology Ancient Russian Poems Collected by Kirsha Danilov.28 Compiled in the middle of the eighteenth century, this collection went through numerous editions, the first three of which especially have resonated with the Russian public up through the present.29 The first edition appeared in 1804, when the Russo-​Persian War (1804–​13) erupted; the second was published in 1818—​one year after the beginning of the Caucasian War (1817–​64)—and the third in 1878, one year after the beginning of the Russo-​ Turkish War (1877–​78).30 All of the Russian intellectual elite knew and cited this source. Nikolai Rimsky-​Korsakov used one tune (about Solovei Budimirovich) from it in his opera Sadko. Literary men, such as Alexander Pushkin,Vissarion Belinsky, Ivan Turgenev, and Leo Tolstoy, owned copies of the collection and often cited passages and used motifs from it.31 Texts from it were often reprinted in other nineteenth-​century Russian folk collections, such as Ivan Khudiakov’s Sbornik velikorusskikh narodnykh istoricheskikh pesen (1860) and Petr Kireevskii’s Pesni (1872) (see the list of song collections discussed in the book in appendix 1). The collection’s popularity might be attributed to its role in nurturing nationalism by representing the Russian people’s shared glory and suffering. Russian folklorist and ethnographer Ivan Khudiakov, who used Danilov’s collection to compile his own Collection of Great-​ Russian Historical Songs, claimed: “bylinas stand incomparably above any conceivable textbook, and for a\n\n23\n\n24 Representing Russia’s Orient people in its undeveloped, naïve and poetic period of development, they serve as the unique and the most accessible means for the support and consolidation of those national strengths that history has brought out in a people.”32 In the 1840s, Vissarion Belinsky, an influential nineteenth-​century Russian literary critic, proposed that every Russian man should know Danilov’s collection, if “poetry is not alien to his soul and if everything organically connected to the Russian spirit [dukh] makes his heart beat faster.”33 Hence, the collection should be part of the school curriculum. An advocate of socially conscious literature, Belinsky believed that bylinas could raise national consciousness. He often evoked the images of Russian heroes and interpreted (or rather imagined) them as a “poetic expression of the national character of the Russian people.”34 Perhaps it was not mere coincidence that Danilov’s collection was published in a time of war. The adverse images of Russia’s Asian historic rivals helped boost patriotic spirit across different social strata and consolidate people against the external enemy. From 1861 to 1867, another collection of bylinas by Rybnikov appeared in Russian. Rybnikov, who was deported to Petrozavodsk in 1859 while working as minor official in the department of statistics, traveled around the area of Lake Onega in the Olonets region (northwest of Russia) and collected several hundred bylinas. His rediscovery of bylina tradition, which by the nineteenth century was thought to be extinct, caught the immediate attention of a large public, including Russia’s official circles. After the publication of the first volume in 1861, he was awarded a prize by the Imperial Russian Geographic Society (Imperatorskoe Russkoe Geograficheskoe Obshchestvo; IRGO), and after the third volume appeared he received the Society’s Golden Medal and was honored with the most prestigious nongovernmental prize, the Demidov Prize. The Ministry of Education obliged all students of history and philology to buy Rybnikov’s collection.35 Paradoxically, he did not perceive his own work as an oeuvre supporting official ideology. His ethnographic research in the Olonets region was not sponsored by any government agency but was his personal endeavor. As he confessed to his friend the Slavophile Konstantin Aksakov, the process of collecting bylinas helped him “save himself from the stagnation of provincial life.”36 Why did Russian officials start promoting this collection with such fervor? Besides its literary merits, could other motivations have stood behind this official interest? A brief look at Russia’s political situation in the early 1860s might help answer these questions. When Rybakov’s collection appeared in print, the political atmosphere in Russia changed from unstable to explosive. After the unsuccessful war in Crimea (1853–​56), aggravated by famine (in 1854–​55 and 1859) causing extreme poverty of the rural population and sparking peasant uprisings, in 1861 Tsar Alexander II reluctantly abolished serfdom to avoid a revolution.37 However, the Emancipation Reform, which aimed to transform the country’s\n\nUnveiling Tradition economy from a feudal system to a bourgeois monarchy, did not put an end to social disturbances and only added fuel to the fire. It not only disappointed peasants and students, many of whom were raznochintsy;38 it also embittered gentry and radical intellectuals. Bloody clashes between the peasants and the Russian government that followed the declaration of the Emancipation Manifesto triggered mass student dissent, riots, and disorder at the universities in Kazan, St. Petersburg, and Moscow and resulted in a temporary closure of these and other universities throughout the empire.39 A new “Provisional Rule” for Russian universities issued by the minister of education, which strengthened surveillance over the students and restricted access for raznochintsy to higher education, further alienated students and many university professors from state officials. Besides raznochintsy, other groups threatened the state’s unity by disobeying its military and religious regulations, including the Old Believers (staroobriadtsy), who claimed the Orthodox tradition but rejected the official church. Their large communities in Vyg, Moscow, and St. Petersburg functioned in a complex system of preaching among the Orthodox population, promising economic support to their adherents, creating their own self-​established settlements, and building their own religious and social institutions.40 Since, in some provinces, Old Believers and other religious schismatics such as Molokans and Doukhobors outnumbered Russian Orthodox believers, imperial policy led to persecuting them as a powerful subversive force that challenged the monopoly of the official church and threatened the established order in the state.41 This, however, did not lessen their number and only strengthened their hostility toward the authorities, widening the chasm between the government and the general population. In addition to peasant, student, and religious struggles, by the 1840s a number of oppositional underground societies had started developing the theory of Russian socialism and begun circulating revolutionary propaganda.
