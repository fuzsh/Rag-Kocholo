        "text": "Below is a DeepL machine translation of a chapter from The Other Lenin a 2006 book by the comtemporary Russian writer Alexander Alexandrovitch Maysuryan on a Russian language website dedicated to Vladimir Lenin (a website that even uses the old Soviet internet appellation “.su”!) , the most important leader of the Russian Revolution and a founder of the Soviet Union. The machine translation reads surprisingly well. Apparently the quality of translations between various language pairs depends upon the amount of source – target language text assimilated by the machine translation system, the characteristics of the source and target languages, and the capacity of the machine translations system itself. While machine translated texts still have the poison cookie problem – fine until you run across an unknown fatal flaw — this reads well enough for casual use.\n\nI used Google Translate for just part of the top page in Russian and its translation in Google Translate. Overall, DeepL seems a bit better than Google Translate, here I use GT since it preserves the appearance of the page. The body of the translation I made using DeepL. Except for formatting and adding some links, I haven’t make any edits to the DeepL Russian-English machine translation for I have forgotten my year of Russian language study I did a long time ago.\n\nGoogle Translated followed by the original Russian language text.\n\nI was first fascinated by the amazingly good quality of the translation (judging by the result; I’ve forgotten my little Russian) then got to thinking about comparative communism and historical circumstance vs. ideology.\n\nAlso that the book is by a contemporary Russian author, so the views on Lenin have a bit of how things turned out and how we see it now in it that makes it fascinating.\n\nAlso the tidbits.. I hadn’t known that Stalin ordered that Lenin’s widow be poisoned at her birthday party when she turned 70 in 1939. That was the end of her. I looked up on Wiki some old Bolsheviks mentioned in the Lenin piece too, some of them got killed off too.\n\nExplore this Russian language website using Google Translate\n\nOften the Russian language Wiki was more complete on Russian subjects, so I ran it through Google Translate instead of linking to the English language WIki page. You can use Google Translate to explore this Russian language website by clicking through links in the translation. A good method might be to use Google Translate for exploration then, once you have found an intriguing article, copy the Russian text into DeepL to get and even better translation into English or whichever target language you choose.\n\nIdeology, History, Culture: A Tangled Web\n\nMy own view is that Communism isn’t Marxist although it is descended from it (people do get blamed for the misdeeds of their children and grandchildren sometimes…) , it was transformed by Lenin et al, I guess that is why they call it Marxist-Leninist or Marxism-Leninism (a subtle difference in there adj/noun vs noun-noun maybe) and became clearer with the break with the Socialist International that came with the founding of the Communist International in 1919 — ‘accept the Twenty-one Theses of Moscow or your party doesn’t qualify to join the new Communist International’. Tho calling everyone to the left of Attila the Hun a communist is an old and successful talking point of the U.S. right.\n\nI am always impressed how interpretations of sacred texts change with time — I remember in grad school reading some old Chinese medical texts and being astonished how much the views of the commentators changed over 2000 years as they were heavily influenced by the ideology of their times, be in Buddhist or in the early 20th century trying to find, under the influence/criticisms of Western Medicine, to find a physical analog to the traditional metaphysical schema for understanding the dynamics of illness.\n\nAs far as China goes, it is in a different cultural zone from the West, and like everyone else, they interpret new ideas with reference to existing ones. The article by Prof Pang of Xiamen University that I translated goes into that. And many of the Chinese ideas about democracy and other ideas from the West were introduced to China through Chinese students in Japan. Though I find Chinese and Japanese culture to be very different ( i think hierarchy is even stronger in Japan than in China, xenophobia too), there was an important influence on early 20th century China.\n\nIdeologies Manifested Through Lens of Particular Cultures and Histories: China and Russia\n\nChina boasts about having socialism with Chinese characteristics, I suspect most places have XX ideology with their national characteristics. I had the same thought when I read George Kennan’s book about the Marquis de Custine’s trip to Russia in 1839. Reading about Russia in those days made me feel that early 19th century Russia was very Stalinist!!\n\nComparative Soviet communism and Chinese communism is intriguing with some parallels and many pitfalls. Sometimes it feels best to fall back on the old standby – the Russians are Russians and the Chinese are Chinese – that today’s major characteristics are shaped by history and culture and not ideology. That is not entirely unreasonable. When I read George Kennan’s little book Marquis De Custine and his Russia in 1839, a summary translation/appreciation of the French Marquis de Custine’s four volume work (available on gutenberg.org in the original French La Russie en 1839) , I felt that vibe strongly! When I read about the Russian Empire and the Tsar’s government back in the mid nineteenth century, they did feel very Stalinist to me, no doubt as a naive reader.\n\nThen who/what are we comparing? Both the Chinese and Soviet ‘Russian’ founding leader (Russia a bit tricky, Russia was the only of the Soviet republics not allowed to have its own Communist Party – probably because it was too dominant already) communist states shoved aside his early comrades – after Lenin died (maybe early enough to leave the legend (and jokes about) the kindly Grandfather Lenin and to shift the ‘blame’ to Stalin), Stalin treated the Old Bolshevik’s with extreme prejudice in the 1930s. To be fair, the Chinese were not to be left behind in the jokebook race: see Cultural Revolution Jokebook.\n\nMao and Lenin, Back Then and Now\n\nMao Zedong was a bit more gentle than Stalin, mostly putting them in prison, although his Red Guard henchmobs killed many of his real and imagined enemies. Russia had seventy years of a communist state before the USSR dissolved leaving black marketeers best equipped to revive capitalism, while PRC China had only thirty years of hard-line communism before Mao died and reform and opening began. This gave China and advantage in its transition to a market economy since many older Chinese entrepreneurs still survived and perhaps even more important, a large Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia and elsewhere were ready to invest and perhaps even more important to provide entrepreneurial expertise and technology to the PRC.\n\nThen we might be thinking of China today versus the old USSR. China had Mao, then Deng who reinterpreted Mao’s changing and increasingly paranoid thoughts (for an ‘all-powerful leader’ he was remarkably frightened about coup plotters all around him) to his own Deng Xiaoping Theory. The PRC’s current maximum leader, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, is coming out with his own Xi Jinping Thought on Chinese Socialism in the New Era. The international environments of the early USSR and early PRC had different international environments. A western and Japanese intervention tried to destroy the USSR while fighting between Tsarist loyalists (the Whites) and the Bolsheviks continued. Defeated Germany as a potential friend during the 1920s and 30s – the Luftwaffe was trained secretly in the Soviet Union and Russians and Germans both assisted the Republic of China against Japan until the Axis pact with Russia was signed – in fact Russia had a group of volunteer flyers – the Soviet Volunteer Group (operated in China during 1937 – 1941) comparable to the Flying Tigers (maybe call them the Flying Bears) who pulled out of China just months before the Flying Tigers got started.\n\nThe New China of the PRC felt likewise threatened in its early days by the US/UN intervention in Korea after it was invaded from the North invaded the South (which also gave Mao the chance to demonstrate his “leaning to one side” in favor of the Soviet Union) and sent in the Chinese Volunteer Army. After the Korean War (in China called [link to GT machine translation of the Chinese Baidu online encyclopedia to give a current PRC perspective on the Korean War] “The War to Oppose American and Assist [North] Korea”) , the PRC enjoyed a better international environment than had the Soviet Union, one more peaceful and stable in the US-led post World War II system that promoted global economic integration. China too eventually became a part of this international system and the WTO and prospered within it: the Soviet Union was always outside that system, in its own security and economic bloc.\n\nChina Integrated into World System Far More than was the Soviet Union\n\nThe PRC and other world economies are far more integrated than the Soviet Union ever was with the economics of countries outside the Eastern Bloc. This makes casual analogies to a new Cold War less apt — engagment is a matter of more or less engagement, not on/off as with the far lower level of engagment with the Soviet Union. Another factor was that the Soviet Union was doing “Communism in one country” while internationally it ran the Communist International to which the Communist Parties of other countries looked to Moscow as world Communist headquarters – The Twenty-one Conditions, officially the Conditions of Admission to the Communist International – after the Socialist/Communist internationals split in 1919-20. The Chinese Communist Party got critical support from the Communist International in its early days. Later the New China PRC developed in a different environment of communism in multiple countries, a polycentrism that gradually weakened Soviet dominance.\n\nThe Different Career of the Short Course in the History of the Soviet Communist Party in the PRC\n\nHow much did Chinese Communism absorb from Russian Communism? Many Chinese communists read works by Marx, Engels and Lenin and studied Stalin’s version — the Short Course in the History of the Soviet Communist Party. Changes were made in the history to suit the needs of the present just as Lenin’s works, translated in China in the early 1980s were massaged to provide support for Deng Xiaoping Theory.\n\nThe version of the history of the party described in the first edition of 1938 was significantly changed to match Stalin’s preferences and it changed during subsequent reprints, following the changes in party leadership.\n\nVeteran Bolshevik leaders like Nikolai Bukharin, Lev Kamenev, Alexei Rykov, Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinovyev, who conflicted with Stalin and were killed in the 1930s were described as “mensheviks” who from the very beginning “opposed Lenin and the Bolshevik party”. The names of Filipp Goloshchyokin and Nikolai Yezhov, initially described as “experienced leaders engaged in enlightening the Red Army” in 1938, were deleted from the book after both were arrested in 1939.\n\nLeszek Kołakowski described the “Short Course” as “perfect manual of false history and doublethink“:\n\nIts lies and suppressions were too obvious to be overlooked by readers who had witnessed the events in question: all but the youngest party members knew who Trotsky was and how collectivization had taken place in Russia, but, obliged as they were to parrot the official version, they became co-authors of the new past and believers in it as party-inspired truth. If anyone challenged this truth on the basis of manifest experience, the indignation of the faithful was perfectly sincere. In this way Stalinism really produced the ‘new Soviet man’: an ideological schizophrenic, a liar who believed what he was saying, a man capable of incessant, voluntary acts of intellectual self- mutilation.\n\n— Leszek Kołakowski, Main Currents of Marxism, Volume III, Chapter III, part 2\n\nInfluence in China\n\nAlthough the Short Course was eventually rejected by the Soviet leadership during the Khrushchev Thaw, its formulations, especially the idea that class struggle not only continued, but intensified as the state moved towards socialism, continued to be of fundamental importance in China, where Mao Zedong repeatedly attacked his opponents in the Communist Party of China as “capitalist roaders” and agents of bourgeois, counter-revolutionary and Kuomintang conspiracies.[12] Mao felt that the Short Course best combined the teachings of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin as well as being a blue print to applying communist ideals in the real world.[13] China was continuing to grow into a Marxist–Leninist state and that fully happened in 1949, making almost one third of the population of the world under the rule of Marxism–Leninism.[14]\n\nFrom Wikipedia article “History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)“\n\nHardline ‘Communist Ideology’ (whatever that is) Had Much Longer Time to Implant in the Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union had central economic planning; China never implemented it as thoroughly, perhaps partly because of the chaos involved in killing off the landlords, collectivization, the Maoist eruptions of the Great Leap Forward and the killing famine that followed and then the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as Mao aimed to outdo to the Soviet Union by jumping straight to Communism, rather than making it a long-term goal as it later became.\n\nWhen I worked in the U.S. Embassy in China in the late 1990s, a professor at Renmin University told me that during the Cultural Revolution, an essay by the PRC Ambassador to the United Kingdom circulated in secret (the professor had read it at the time) arguing that China must first pass through the stage of capitalism before it can become communist. Intriguing, but I have never been able to confirm that story.\n\nChina’s Sinicization of Marx and Lenin\n\nWhat many Chinese Communists say today is that Chinese Communism, while it was inspired by the Germans Marx and Engels and the Russian Lenin, is not a foreign ideology. PRC Communist ideology has become thoroughly sinicized. Last year I ran across Xiamen University Marxism Institute Professor Pang Hu comparison of the sinicization of Marxism from the West via Russia through continual adjustment through practice in its new Chinese environment with the vitiation of once vigorous western brought in by Sun Yat-sen which were then weakened by their re-interpretation according to China’s traditional thought aka Confucianism. I translated Professor Pang’s article on this blog as 2015: PRC Marxist Scholar on the Sinicization of Marxism and the Confucianization of Sun Yatsen’s Three People’s Principles.\n\nThe article below on Lenin in the early Soviet Union (he only lived a few years after its founding) got me thinking about the above. Another Soviet Union – PRC comparison is how long the founding leader lived. Lenin died in 1923, USSR year six. Mao died in 1976, PRC year 27. History turned out that way. In some alternative history (perhaps in some parallel universe) Mao died in 1950, Liu Shaoqi became the leader and the influence of Deng Xiaoping grows. In that alternative universe, the new state doesn’t slaughter quite so many landlords, instead of collectivization China creates the contract responsibility system that incentivizes agricultural production [a myth widely propagated in China is that the contract responsibility system was created by rebel peasants in Anhui Province in the late 1970s. Actually it was proposed by Liu Shaoqi in 1953 but rejected as heresy by Mao. After the famine, Liu proposed it again and it was again rejected, the Great Leap Forward and succeeding famine and Cultural Revolution do not happen. While other problems might have shown up, an early PRC minus Mao would have been different. As a Chinese businesswoman told me angrily once, “Mao Zedong took us on a thirty-year detour!’\n\nNow for the machine translation about Lenin in the early Soviet Union from a book by Alexander Alexandrovitch Maysuryan, a contemporary Russian writer. Made me think of anothe book: Orlando Figes’ The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin’s Russia.\n\nA reviewer criticized Maysuryan for focusing on only the more positive elements of Lenin’s personality and for glossing over his brutality. From its title, I imagine that The Other Lenin was written to correct what the author considered a prevailing one-sided view of Lenin. Correctives then can inspire other correctives and so on….\n\nAlexander Maysuryan’s book The Other Lenin (M.: Vagrius) is a desperate attempt to give the “living corpse” (incidentally, the Mausoleum is once again open to the public) a glimmer of its former glow. The author movingly depicts the children’s amusements of the “inquisitive, mobile boy” and the sporting activities of the adult Ilyich: “he was very fond of all kinds of outdoor games: ‘town games, croquet'”, in Switzerland he “often went for a walk in the mountains”, and he took associates “on a bicycle 50-70 versts away”. Almost half a book is devoted to stories about how Lenin “played music,” was “fond of Nekrasov,” read Faust in the original and knew by heart “several tirades of Mephistopheles. Maisurian remains modestly silent about the cannibalistic exploits of Illich, hiding behind Lenin’s own quotation that “you can’t make a revolution with white gloves on. Sweetly repeating the fiery swearing of the fiery revolutionary in speeches and articles, the author finds “nice features” here, too. As it turned out, Ilyich easily forgot the insults he had uttered to his opponent, and “all that was said instantly forgotten.\n\nFrom unsigned review in January 2017 issue of Russian language publication “Profile” via DeepL translation.\n\nhttps://leninism.su/books/3599-drugoj-lenin.html?start=13\n\nIf Chapter 13 below of The Other Lenin leaves you wanting more, you can get it by pressing the back Назад or forward Вперед buttons and then running the result through DeepL [the free version may not translate it all at one go, but you can get there by copying out the translation and then deleting the Russian text that has already been translated] or Google Translate. Назад Вперед For example Chapter 12 “THE REVOLT OF THE SLAVE-OWNERS.” Lenin went to Moscow to make more money, and stayed there and Chapter 14 “EVERY GOD IS A CORPSE.” Lenin killed a lot of people, but he helped build churches.\n\nДругой Ленин – ГРАНИ РЕВОЛЮЦИИ\n\nАлександр Майсурян\n\nhttps://leninism.su/books/3599-drugoj-lenin.html?start=13\n\n[The Other Lenin – The GRANGE OF REVOLUTION\n\nAlexander Maysuryan Chapter 13]\n\nFACETS OF REVOLUTION\n\nLenin ordered the transfer of rivers from Siberia to the West.\n\nVladimir Ilyich made an alphabet book.\n\nLenin created two laws – do not drink alcohol and study, study, study.\n\nFrom school essays about Lenin\n\nThe October Revolution proclaimed as its goal nothing less than “rebuilding human life from top to bottom” (the words of Trotsky). Some things the revolution managed to change, some things didn’t.\n\n“Our present way of life,” Lenin wrote in 1923, “combines in itself, to an amazing degree, the features of a desperately bold with timidity of thought in the face of the smallest changes.” “The force of habit of millions and tens of millions,” he remarked, “is the most terrible force.” “We began to shake and destroy the most inveterate prejudices, the most firm, age-old, inveterate habits.” “The past holds us, grabs us with thousands of hands and does not allow us to take a step forward or makes us take these steps as badly as we do.” “When a revolution comes, things do not happen as with the death of an individual, when the deceased is carried out. When the old society perishes, its corpse cannot be nailed into a coffin and put into a grave. It decomposes in our environment, this corpse rots and infects us. There was no other way in the world … and cannot be.\n\nThe defector Soviet diplomat Georgy Solomon recounted his conversation with Lenin in December 1917.\n\n– We’re taking as far to the left as possible! – said Vladimir Ilyich.\n\n“All this is very good,” Solomon objected cautiously. “Let’s say that you reach the very, as they say, leftmost corner … But you forget the law of reaction, this purely mechanical law … After all, you will fall back according to this law, who knows where! ..\n\n– And great! exclaimed Lenin. – Fine, so be it, but in this case it speaks for the fact that we need to take it even more to the left! This is water for my own mill!.. And it is not for us, the old revolutionaries, to be afraid of both this experiment and the law of reaction. We will also fight against it, against this law!.. And we will win! We’ll rock the world…\n\n– So far – I don’t know what will happen next – you only destroy …\n\n“True, absolutely true, you are right. Right. We destroy, but do you remember what Pisarev says, do you remember? “Break, beat everything, beat and destroy! What breaks, then everything is rubbish, which has no right to life, what survives is good … “Here we are, faithful to Pisarev’s – and they are truly revolutionary – precepts, we break and beat everything, we beat and break, ha-ha-ha , and here is the result – everything shatters to smithereens, nothing remains, that is, everything turns out to be rubbish, holding on only by inertia! .. Ha-ha-ha, and we will break and beat!\n\n“I don’t quite understand you, Vladimir Ilyich, I don’t understand some kind of gloomy, grumbling pathos that so clearly beats in your words … But here’s what. All of us, the old revolutionaries, have never preached destruction for the sake of destruction, and have always stood… for the destruction of only that which life itself has already condemned, that is falling…\n\n“And I think that everything that exists has already become obsolete and rotten!” Yes, my good lord, it is rotten and must be destroyed!…\n\n“The farther we bend to the left,” Lenin liked to repeat, “the closer the resultant will pass to us.” In 1921, he recalled the words of Engels that “there is, apparently, a law requiring the revolution to advance further than it can handle in order to consolidate less significant changes.”\n\nIn one of his speeches, Vladimir Ilyich remarked: “Those who have been in the countryside know that 30 years ago a lot of old people could be found in the village who said: “But under serfdom it was better, there was more order, there was strictness, the women were luxurious. they didn’t dress.” So now, after the revolution, many people praise the bygone order; but change is inevitable…\n\nLet us see how the planned changes took place in various areas of life and what part Lenin himself took in them.\n\n“Latching places of gold.”\n\nLenin tried to destroy one of the cults that underlie modern society – the cult of money, or, as he put it, “the golden bag.” It is in this sense that one should understand his famous words about “gold toilets”. “When we win on a world scale,” he wrote in 1921, “we, I think, will make public latrines out of gold in the streets of several of the largest cities in the world.”\n\nAnd in the first years the revolution really went very far in the fight against the “money bag”. The money itself depreciated and turned into crisp, decorated candy wrappers, “banknotes” – millions and billions (as it was then called, “lemons and lemonards”). Lenin called them “multi-colored pieces of paper that fly by the billions and now clearly reveal that they are a fragment, scraps of old bourgeois clothes.” Chastushka of those years:\n\nA beggar asks at the gate,\n\nServed by a Soviet thousand.\n\nHe threw a thousand on the sand – He\n\nasks for a piece of bread.\n\nLenin joked: “The Russian ruble can be considered famous, if only because the number of these rubles now exceeds a quadrillion.”\n\nPayment in kind and exchange triumphed everywhere. One of the decrees introduced free admission to theaters and other spectacles – only a note was made about this in the work book. It seemed that one more step – and the money could be completely abolished. Gone are such professions as a banker, a manufacturer, and just a big merchant… The most famous Soviet caricature of Vladimir Ilyich (drawn by Denis in 1920) depicted him as a janitor with a broom, sweeping all kinds of evil spirits from the globe – kings – kings in ermine robes, priests in black cassocks, millionaires with tight sacks of gold…\n\nTrue, instead of large-scale trade, small-scale, street trade flourished. The liberal newspaper Sovremennoye Slovo wrote in February 1918: “All the streets, squares and boulevards are filled with small merchants… The shops are empty. Shops are boarded up… Now the street is selling. Here you can get everything, for all tastes, for all needs…\n\n“From an engraving and an old clasp to a pornographic postcard and old galoshes.\n\n“From Kraft chocolate to bright red dog sausage.\n\n“Bourgeois”, big “bourgeois” – at the last gasp… A new “owner” is coming… Petty, greedy, tenacious, furious for profit… Here it is – the future bourgeoisie – in headscarves, jumping from the cold, wrapping overcoats, excitedly shouts out his product:\n\n– Cigarettes!\n\n– Matches!\n\n— Chocolate!\n\n– Canned food! Different things! Gingerbread!…\n\nIn Moscow, the famous Sukharevsky market became the center of small trade. In December 1920, speaking at the Congress of Soviets, Lenin solemnly announced the closure of this, as he put it, “unpleasant institution.” Applause resounded… “Sukharevka” is closed,” continued Vladimir Ilyich, “but it is not the Sukharevka that is scary that is closed. The former “sukharevka” on Sukharevskaya Square has been closed, it is not difficult to close it. The “sukharevka” is terrible, which lives in the soul and actions of every small owner. This “sukharevka” must be closed …\n\nAnd after another couple of months, in 1921, the country suddenly rebelled. The Kronstadt uprising broke out, the Tambov uprising flared more and more, strikes began in Moscow. The rebellious Kronstadt sailors sang ditties:\n\nThe All-Russian Commune\n\nHas ravaged us to the ground,\n\nThe Communist dictatorship Has brought us to the edge\n\n.\n\nWe drove out the landlords,\n\nWe waited for the wills, the land, We\n\nshook off all the Romanovs, We\n\nfound the Communists.\n\nInstead of freedom and land\n\n, they gave us the Cheka,\n\nAnd they planted Soviet farms\n\nhere and there.\n\nThere are no matches, no kerosene,\n\nEveryone sits with torches,\n\nUnder the Bolshevik commune They\n\nonly eat cards. And the peasants\n\nrose up in Russia For the land, And in Izvestia everyone writes: “The kulaks rebelled.”\n\nGet up, peasant people!\n\nA new dawn is rising –\n\nLet’s throw off the shackles of Trotsky, Let’s\n\nthrow off Tsar Lenin! ..\n\nThe newspaper of the insurgents of Kronstadt printed the statements of the local Bolsheviks, who left the party in tens and hundreds… The revolutionary power staggered. It turned out that the peasants wanted not only to get rid of the landowners, but also to trade freely. “Large masses of the peasantry,” said Lenin, “not consciously, but instinctively, by their mood, were against us.” According to him, this created “a danger many times greater than all the Denikins, Kolchaks and Yudenichs put together.”\n\n“If we do not defeat it, we will slide back like the French Revolution.”\n\nAnd the pendulum abruptly swung back … The whole country turned into one continuous Sukharevka. Large-scale trade began to boil, and “sovburs” (Soviet bourgeois) immediately appeared in the light of day. Expensive shops and all kinds of amusements for the rich opened. A leaflet by the Petrograd Mensheviks in 1922 said: “Down with the money! yelled the communists. And now? .. The calf reigns again: if not real, then from gold leaf … Along with the hopeless need – all the new rich. For their joy, luxurious shops are full of all kinds of overseas goods, gramophone music rumbles, rivers of wine flow, gambling houses are full until morning. And all this for the glory of the October Revolution.” And the former Left Socialist-Revolutionary People’s Commissar Steinberg noted with condemnation: “Under NEP … the bones of the old world began to come to life easily.”\n\nGambling houses and casinos have become a real symbol of the NEP (“new economic policy”).

Arkhangelsky in 1922 in the journal Rossiya described the everyday life of a Soviet casino: green tables littered with piles of banknotes … “And around these tables people crowd – men and women, seized by the only passion recognized here – card gambling. Eyes burn with an unhealthy gleam, fingers convulsively reach for banknotes, and each of the players is gripped by a special tense feeling – the hope of winning, successfully grabbing these millions and billions with their hands in order to throw them back on the table – in a new hope of doubling, tripling, doubling the winnings … Women do not lag behind men in passion – they even surpass them. Here is a red-haired beauty – with milky-white skin, with wonderful mermaid eyes, with a magnificent, artistically done hairstyle. Huge diamonds in my ears on graceful legs, covered in silk and magnificent lacquer, bracelets, also with diamonds. Bust – in diamonds and pearls. But all these “brilliant” effects are not enough for her: in her hair and on the clasps of her shoes, there are fractional, like pearls, electric bulbs. From time to time, the beauty presses the button of an electric battery hidden in her pocket, and her head lights up, like fireflies on a July night, and stars light up on her legs, like in a black southern sky … A small well-groomed pen, chained in gold and studded with precious stones, carelessly reaches for a golden reedikil with jingling pendants and takes out a bundle of credit cards.\n\n– A billion! – the coral mouth of the beauty raps out.\n\nAnd when the bet turns out to be beaten, the same mouth, with the same nonchalance, repeats:\n\n“Another billion!”\n\nThe magazine “Red Pepper” in 1923 placed a cartoon: people with sabers and rifles take a person out of the casino. The foreigner, looking at this scene, asks with concern:\n\n“Tell me, citizen, what is it?” Red terror resumed?\n\n– Not. In Moscow, the police escort home those who have won big …\n\nOf course, even in 1920 the Bolsheviks could not have imagined in a nightmare that such scenes would be played out in reality in the country under their leadership. To Lenin himself, this seemed unthinkable. He spoke about freedom of trade: “We say: we will never agree to this, we will rather lay down our bones than make concessions in this … We will fight against this to the last drop of blood.”\n\n“What kind of merchants we are,” Lenin sighed. But now he himself urged his comrades to “learn to trade.” It sounded quite shocking. One of the listeners objected:\n\n“They didn’t teach us how to trade in prisons.\n\nVladimir Ilyich considered such objections the clearest manifestation of Oblomovism. He responded immediately and indignantly:\n\n“Did they teach us how to fight in prisons?” Did they teach you how to manage the state in prisons? ..\n\nOnly the authority of Lenin made it possible to accomplish this whole fantastic turn relatively gently. Vladimir Ilyich realized that if the Bolsheviks themselves did not want to take the path of “Thermidor” (that is, “counter-revolution”), then the country would do just fine without them. And they will, no doubt, have to “lie down with bones” in the literal, and not figurative, sense. “Thermidor”? wrote Lenin in 1921. Sober, maybe? Will be? We’ll see.” “The revolution faces some kind of abyss,” he noted, “on which all previous revolutions stumbled and backed away …” In a conversation with the French socialist Jacques Sadoul, Lenin said:\n\nThe Jacobin workers are more insightful, more firm than the bourgeois Jacobins, and had the courage and wisdom to Thermidorize themselves.\n\nThe leader of the Bolsheviks happily echoed the Smenovekhovite N. Ustryalov: “The revolution is no longer the same, although it is headed by all the same familiar faces … But they themselves were forced to take the path of Thermidor … The path of Thermidor is in the rebirth of the tissues of the revolution, in the transformation souls and hearts of its agents…” “I don’t know if Demyan Bedny is right that the monuments of Volodarsky and Sverdlov are crying with large tears, contemplating the faces of today’s Moscow and St. comparing the personalities of the leaders of the two revolutions: “At one time, the French Jacobins were unable to feel the new conditions of life – and perished. Neither Robespierre nor his friends possessed a talent for tactical flexibility.” “Lenin is more flexible and sensitive than Robespierre.” “We have embarked on the “path of Thermidor”, which we, unlike France, will, apparently,\n\nAnd the old Vekhovets A. Petrishchev caustically ridiculed such dreams: “I understand the irritation of that reader of Change of milestones who said:\n\n“Wait, lads. Already Thermidors. Not far off and the Brumers. Then Napoleon. Then Ludovic will come… Oh, those soap bubbles. Tired of them… And how will people not get tired of it…» Like the previous sharp turns, the transition to the NEP was not easy for Lenin. N. Volsky relayed the story he heard from the Bolshevik Alexei Svidersky: “At one meeting, Lenin said:“ When I look into your eyes, you all seem to agree with me and say “yes”, but if you turn away, you say “no”. You are playing hide and seek with me. In that case, let me play with you one game adopted in parliaments. When no confidence is expressed in parliaments against the head of government, he resigns. You expressed distrust of me during the conclusion of peace in Brest, although now even fools understand that my policy was correct. Now again you express no confidence in me on the issue of the new economic policy. I draw the conclusions adopted in the parliaments from this, and hand over my resignation to the two highest instances – the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Plenum. I cease to be the Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars, a member of the Politburo, and turn into a simple publicist writing in Pravda and other Soviet publications … “By the threat of resignation, Lenin frightened everyone so much that he immediately broke down the disagreement expressed by many.”\n\nDespite their temporary victory, the Sovburs and Nepmen felt the precariousness and fragility of their “second coming.” (It ended, as you know, at the end of the 1920s.) After all, the rich man ceased to be a respectable person, respected in society, an example for everyone to follow: in this the revolution was successful. A characteristic joke of 1924 (from the Zanoza magazine):\n\n– And why are you, Polikarp Fedotovich, killing yourself. Before the war, you were the first guild, but now the NEP … Only the whole difference …\n\n– Tell me! – Nepman bitterly objects. “Before, I was a guild, and now everyone is shouting to me: “rotten, de, I! ..”\n\nA well-known anecdote of those years – a NEP man with a child walking along Red Square.\n\n– Dad, what is it? the boy asks, pointing to the Mausoleum to his father.\n\nThis is Lenin’s grave.\n\n– And what is Lenin?\n\n– Lenin is, son, our grave …\n\nThe “latrines made of gold” conceived by Vladimir Ilyich remained a dream. Perhaps, this idea found an unexpected embodiment only in the famous “golden toilet bowls” of the “new Russians” in the 90s. The golden toilet of a rich man reborn from the ashes is the real completion of Lenin’s dream, in which it turns into its complete opposite … However, is this not the fate of all human ideas in general?\n\nBy the way, in the jokes of the 90s, Vladimir Ilyich met with this, the next generation of Russian “bourgeois”: “At the crossroads, an antediluvian armored car crashes into the back of the six hundredth Mercedes. A “new Russian” in a crimson jacket jumps out of the Mercedes, fingers fanned out, ready for battle. And from the armored car comes an uncle in a gray coat and cap, with a red beard. The uncle screwed up his kind, kind eyes and said to the “new Russian”:\n\n– And you, my friend, stopped at the wrong anecdote. Felix Edmundovich! Please shoot this bourgeois.”\n\n“Don’t young people like the word ‘comrade’?”\n\nOf course, the Bolsheviks saw the fight against money as part of a wider war against private property in general. Sometimes Lenin was proved that the desire for property lies in the very nature of man. He responded to this argument as follows: “The feeling of ownership is by no means a primordial human instinct. When a person wants to own something… he does it in order to make his struggle for existence easier. No one wants to own what is already enough for everyone. In the deserts, everyone takes care of their wells, but where there is plenty of water, not a single reasonable person will protect it … “\n\nThe Bolsheviks believed that if, instead of mutual struggle, brotherhood was established in society, people would stop clinging to property. The word “comrade” served as an external expression of these new human relations. This word was introduced into general circulation by the February Revolution. In those days, it was not used except in relation to the former king and queen. The American journalist John Reed described such a case: “The lady of one of my friends returned home one afternoon in hysterics: the conductor in the tram called her “comrade”!”\n\nVladimir Ilyich considered such a dimensionless understanding of “partnership” to be erroneous. In June 1917, he declared in one of his speeches: “The wolf is no friend to the sheep.”\n\nAnd yet, in red Russia, the address “comrade” was applied to almost everyone. Very soon, notes of bureaucracy, insincerity sounded in him. In friendly communication, other, more cordial words began to supplant him. “This word is “comrade,” said Lev Kamenev in 1918, “it has been erased like a coin from repetition, but this is a great word that embodies that future system in which people will not be wolves to each other, but comrades, will live as a friendly family. In the 1920s, Lenin himself, with some annoyance, asked Komsomol member Ekaterina Loginova: “Don’t young people like the word “comrade”?” His interlocutor replied that she liked it. “Then why do you treat each other with the word “brothers”? ..”\n\nLater, a joke appeared in Soviet folklore: “Under capitalism, man is a wolf to man. And under socialism? Comrade wolf.\n\nNevertheless, the appeal “comrade” lasted until the very “restoration” of the 90s (and in the Russian army it remained in the 21st century). In 1991, P. Negretov, a reader of the liberal magazine Ogonyok, called for the rapid introduction of the appeal “Mr. “Mr. Lieutenant!” – how wonderful it sounds and how beneficial it is for both sides – for the one who addresses, and for the one to whom they address … Together with the restoration of private property, the old appeals will return to us the lost sense of dignity.\n\nIronically, the old-fashioned address “sir” returned to everyday life in 1991, just when huge queues lined up at the empty stores. What gave rise to the ditty:\n\nWhile the meat was put in cabbage soup,\n\nWe were comrades.\n\nAnd when the food ran out,\n\n“gentlemen” immediately became …\n\nLenin as a nudist.\n\nThe tabloid-erotic press of Russia in its own way reflected the coming of the Bolsheviks to power: as the onset of an era of permissiveness. In a drawing in one of these publications in November 1917, an astonished housewife asks her cook, who is walking around the kitchen naked, in only an apron and a handkerchief:\n\n“Why are you like this?\n\n– And in the tail (queues. – A.M.) they said: “The Bolsheviks will come, they will take everything off you!” So I took everything off myself in advance! .. “\n\nIn another drawing, a well-dressed gentleman is playfully interested in a naked girl splashing in a bath:\n\n– What party do you belong to?\n\n“Can’t you see that I’m a Bolshevik,” she answers languidly, “I don’t even have a shadow of any shame! ..\n\nPerhaps the nudist movement that flourished in the young Soviet Republic has become the most striking symbol of sexual liberation. The poet Goldschmidt became especially famous for his shocking demonstrations, who appeared before the public not only naked, but also painted with brown paint “under the nave”. From the liberal newspaper Sovremennoye Slovo for April 1918: “The Bolshevik futurist walking half-dressed through the streets, Goldschmidt, made Moscow laugh by erecting a monument to himself in a flowerbed in front of the Bolshoi Theatre. A small figurine of him in the nude, with a dog biting his heel, was opened by him according to an established ritual. In front of a bunch of onlookers and passers-by, he uttered a heartfelt word, and then pulled back the covers.\n\nThe famous dancer Ida Rubinstein performed naked on stage, which also seemed shocking and unusual in those days. Rumors about all these liberties also reached the White Guards, who in 1919 released a satirical poster “Rising prices for men’s suits in the Soviets.” According to the poster, the price of clothing has risen so much that it was “unaffordable” for ordinary Soviet citizens. They involuntarily roam the streets naked. The caption reads: “In the Bolshevik paradise, you can walk around naked, hiding behind the newspaper “Communist” …\n\nAmong the thousands and thousands of monuments to Lenin, there is probably not a single one that depicts him naked. Meanwhile, the author of such a sculpture would not have sinned much against the truth of history – after all, Vladimir Ilyich was also a supporter of nudism.\n\nThe nudist (naturist) movement arose in Germany and Austria at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. The naked body for naturists has become a symbol of a return to nature, a natural and healthy lifestyle. On beaches and other places of recreation, naturists spent time without clothes, thereby challenging the sense of “false shame” and social conventions. Nudists preached sobriety, smoking cessation, gymnastics, vegetarianism. In Russia, among the supporters of this movement were such prominent figures as Leo Tolstoy and Maximilian Voloshin. Nudism won sympathy among Russian revolutionaries as well. Which was not at all surprising – after all, naturism was seen as something of a continuation of the revolution in the field of culture and health.\n\nWhile in Austria, emigrant Vladimir Ulyanov visited a nudist beach, and this visit made the most favorable impression on him. He spoke out strongly in favor of the “healthy lifestyle” that nudists preached. These ideas were also shared by Lenin’s wife, Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya. Other prominent Bolsheviks also belonged to the number of supporters of nudism – for example, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Nikolai Bukharin, Alexander Bogdanov …\n\nIn 1917 Vladimir Ilyich returned to Russia. After European looseness, the domestic beach (in the summer of that year) made a depressing impression on him: deserted, with lonely bathers, who, embarrassed by their half-dressedness, timidly hid behind the bushes.\n\n“Here, abroad, this has already been surpassed,” Lenin remarked to Bonch-Bruevich, who accompanied him. – There is nowhere such space and, for example, in Germany, on the lakes there is such a colossal need for bathing among the workers, among the public walking on holidays, and in the hot summer every day, that everyone bathes there openly, right from the shore, next to each other, and men and women. Isn’t it possible to undress neatly and go for a swim without hooliganism, but respecting each other? scandals in this regard. This must be resolutely fought … We have a lot of work ahead of us for new forms of life, simplified and free; without the priestly unctuousness and hypocrisy of hidden libertines.\n\nA year later, Russian beaches took on a completely different look. The tabloid newspaper “Moscow Ringer” in the summer of 1918, under the heading “Freedom of Bathing”, described a characteristic scene:\n\n“- Disperse! .. No place for mulberries! .. Hey, what’s wrong?\n\n– Freedom, comrade… What are you driving?..\n\n– I say, what are you gathering here? .. Disperse! .. I will shoot! .. – shouts a fellow policeman.\n\nIn what the mother gave birth bathers “loose formation” lie along the embankment. The audience from the tram letter “A” bursts into loud laughter, while others do not know what to do with their eyes. And, oddly enough, in such disputes then it was not the puritanical militiaman who won, but the liberated bathers …\n\nIn his writings, Lenin, although he does not mention nudism directly, several times venomously ridicules “the most disgusting example of a withered and anemic, hysterical old maid, proud of her barren moral purity … who coyly insists on the need for a fig leaf.”\n\nBy the way, the last Russian emperor, Nicholas II, was also a nudist. (A film has been preserved: a naked sovereign dives into a river, and his household bathes in the same costume.) At the end of the 20th century, there was even such a joke among Russian nudists: “If Lenin and Nicholas II met in some nature club, then maybe and the revolution would not have happened.”\n\nFor several years, Russia turned out to be “a country of victorious nudism.” Delegations of Soviet nudists in the 20s were the most numerous at international nudist conferences. On the basis of nudism, mass children’s recreation also developed – in the pioneer camp “Artek” all the children swam without clothes (which is confirmed by archival filming).\n\nA turn in relation to nudism was outlined in 1924, shortly after the death of Lenin. Satirists Ilf and Petrov ridiculed the nudist-klutz in the biting feuilleton “Ideological Nikudykin”. Magazines began to print sarcastic jokes like these – a customer in a store is indignant:\n\n“Aren’t you ashamed to hang around like that?!\n\n“I, a citizen, am a member of the Down with Shame Society.\n\nDemonstrations without clothes on city streets were banned. Nudism was finally forced out into the sphere of family recreation. However, here, too, its mass character made an indelible impression on foreigners in those years. Pulitzer Prize winner H. R. Knickerborger described his journey in 1931 along the banks of the Moskva River. He turned out to be a guest of a real fantastic “country of nudists.” Here are his observations: “Thousands of men and women, girls and boys, children in their arms, grandparents play games, eat picnic provisions, swim in the river or just take air baths, basking in the sun … Most of the picnic participants , young athletes and older people are completely naked … A group of young men compete in the long jump. Fifty of them are in the pit for jumping, or waiting for their turn. They are all undressed. There are no girls among them but soon half a dozen girls in light summer dresses, passing by, stop to watch the jumps… On the other side, a group of girls are playing handball. They are naked… Below, in the river, several hundred women of all ages are swimming, splashing or just talking, knee-deep in the water. Nobody pays much attention to them.”\n\nFrom his observations, the guest drew the following curious conclusion: “Taking off clothes is the most radical leveling action that can be taken by mankind… With nakedness, class distinctions disappear. Workers, peasants, office workers suddenly become just people. This, in a nutshell, sets out… the main goal of the Soviet revolutionaries. That’s why… this summer in the Soviet Union, on each of its rivers, on the shores of all its lakes and seas, literally millions of men and women swam and sunbathed under the sun without clothes, naturally, as if it could not be otherwise.. .”\n\nSexual revolution.\n\nMarriages in the Russian Empire were concluded in the church, and therefore only the church could divorce the spouses. It was incredibly difficult to obtain a legal divorce through a spiritual consistory. Already February 1917 tried to facilitate this procedure. In the satirical drawings of those days, church marriage was depicted in the form of heavy chains that tightly bound the unfortunate spouses. Of course, the simplification of divorce met with sharp opposition from the Orthodox Church. In one of the cartoons, the new chief prosecutor of the Holy Synod, appointed by the revolution, angrily threatened the churchmen: “Your Eminences! Two more words against divorce – and I will force you to open even the Trinity Bridge! .. “\n\nHowever, only the Bolsheviks had the determination to cut the Gordian knot of the previous marital relationship. “One cannot be a democrat and a socialist,” Lenin wrote resolutely, “without immediately demanding complete freedom of divorce, for the absence of this freedom is an extreme oppression of the oppressed sex, women.” The decree signed by Lenin in December 1917 was just as categorically called “On the dissolution of marriage.” Instead of a church marriage, a civil marriage was introduced, and its dissolution was a hundredfold facilitated. “Petrogradskaya Gazeta” in 1918 reported on the consequences of this decree: “Probably, few of Petrograders know that the old red tape of the divorce case has gone “into history” … Unaccustomed to the new judicial procedure, the litigants literally turn to stone with amazement when they hear the verdict on divorce.\n\n– Already?! – with indescribable disappointment, the exclamations of husbands and wives are heard more than once, immediately freed from the chains of Hymen, which have become a burden to them.\n\nThe country’s first civil marriage was between People’s Commissar Alexandra Kollontai and sailor Pavel Dybenko. Soon, the young spouses seriously offended the new government – and Lenin joked: “I personally think that execution will not be enough punishment for them. Therefore, I propose that they be sentenced to fidelity to each other for five years.”\n\nThe magazine “New Satyricon” in 1918 scoffed in every possible way at the new orders in the field of marriage. One note: F. Sologub recounts an excerpt from a conversation overheard on the street:\n\n– You know, she (obviously, Kollontai. – A.M.) got married.\n\n– What do you! Did they get married in a church?\n\n– Well, why not! I just wrote it down in my notebook.\n\nWe are sure that the method of recording a perfect marriage in a notebook will soon be abandoned as a bourgeois method. Just a wink is enough – and the marriage is perfect. For our part, we also offer the easiest way to divorce: one of the spouses drowns the other in the Fontanka. This is not a consistory rigmarole for you!”\n\nThe magazine also laid out a clever “way” to get rid of an annoying cook. After the revolution, it became almost impossible to simply dismiss the useless servants – their rights were reliably protected by the new government. On the other hand, it was possible to enter into a legal marriage with the cook, and then instantly divorce and immediately put her out – after all, it was worth nothing now to part with your wife …\n\nIn the summer of 1918, the liberal newspaper The Devil’s Pepper Pot printed a parody of the usual lawyer’s ad: “In divorce cases, there’s nothing to go to lawyers. Go to the sausage shop and get divorced. Another joke of that time: “It is forbidden to enter into a civil marriage more than 17 times a day” …\n\nTrue, in some places in the villages the decree on the dissolution of marriage was understood in a very peculiar way. As the newspaper “Vse!” in August 1918, in a village near Tsaritsyn, the peasants demanded that the priest fix the secular divorce in the church. The priest refused: “There is no rite of divorce.” Then the peasants came up with their own idea: “The guilty wife was dressed in matting, they gave an old broom in her hands, they decorated her head with nettles, they hung large posters on her chest and back with the inscriptions:“ I am a divorced wife ”, and arm in arm with a triumphant husband, to the sound of basins and frying pans, with whistling and whooping, were led through the whole village to the house of her parents.\n\nThe opposition Petrograd newspaper Era in July 1918 broadcast conversations in the corridors of the people’s court. Here the court immediately divorced some young woman, and even awarded her money for a child.\n\n“The woman’s face beams with pleasure.\n\n— How kind. I didn’t even ask for money! she says cheerfully…\n\n– Look, how soon! One or two, and divorced! ..\n\n“Easier than getting on a tram!”\n\n“Here, brother, they’ll get married in a minute!”\n\n– How long can you do it?\n\n“Do you think it was better before, or what?” some woman in a white headscarf, with a middle-aged, sickly-pale face, warmly intervenes. – Before seven years it was necessary to wander around the consistories and how much money to waste. And now…”\n\nThe Bolsheviks went even further – they completely equated the actual marriage with the official one. Illegitimate children acquired all the rights of “legitimate” children. “We issued a decree,” Lenin noted, “which abolished the difference in the position of a married and illegitimate child …” “We left no stone unturned in the true sense of the word from those vile laws on the inequality of women, on the restrictions of divorce, on vile formalities, surrounding it, on the non-recognition of illegitimate children, on the search for their fathers, etc. – laws, the remnants of which are numerous in all civilized countries. (These revolutionary innovations persisted until 1944.)\n\nHowever, the fathers of illegitimate children still had to pay alimony “temporarily”, for six months. In one of the cartoons of the early 1920s, a man looks at a rooster with envy: “Here is expanse for roosters: two or three johns, a dozen children and no alimony!”\n\nIn another drawing, a line of Virgins with babies (Smolenskaya, Three-handed, Satisfy sorrow, Kazanskaya, Pochaevskaya …) lined up to God himself. Old man God exclaims in horror: “Damn it! Each of them to pay a third of the salary for the maintenance of the child? Why, no salary is enough for this!”\n\nIn the 1920s, temporary, short-lived marriages became widespread in Soviet society. The magazine Down with the Gods wrote in 1923: “Recently, we have an epidemic of “divorces”. What explains it? First of all, the fact that now there is no need to secretly cheat on an unloved wife or a hated husband. You can get a divorce openly … Then, now there are fewer hunters to unquestioningly endure the beatings of their drunken husband … “Leo Trotsky explained what was happening as follows:” Even the introduction of the institution of civil marriage could not but deal a cruel blow to the old, consecrated, ostentatious family. The less personal connection there was in the old marriage, the more the external, everyday, in particular ritual, church side played the role of a bond. The blow to this latter turned out to be the same blow to the family… That is why the family staggers, disintegrates, falls apart, arises and collapses again…\n\n“Such a diversity of marital relations,” Alexandra Kollontai noted in 1918, “has never been known to history: an inseparable marriage with a “stable family” and a transient free relationship nearby, a secret adultery in marriage and an open cohabitation of a girl with her lover – a “wild marriage”, pair marriage and “threesome” marriage, and even the complex form of “foursome” marriage, not to mention the varieties of prostitution for sale… The forms of modern marital communication are contradictory and confusing.” “So it was, so it will be! There is nothing more erroneous than this saying … There is nothing to hide: the old family is dying off.\n\nLenin also believed that “a revolution is approaching in the field of marriage and sexual relations,” consonant with the social revolution. However, not only liberals, but also right-wing socialists disapproved of the overbroad scope of the Soviet “sexual revolution”. The former Socialist-Revolutionary activist Pitirim Sorokin in 1922 noted with alarm in one of his speeches that the family was “decaying”: “A healthy society is impossible without a healthy family. The collapse, both spiritual and biological, has gone too far here, accelerating the extinction and degeneration of the Russian people through sexual diseases. It’s time to stop this disaster.”\n\nAt the same time, Sorokin published an article in the independent Petrograd magazine The Economist, where he condemned “sexual debauchery, a frivolous attitude towards marriage.” He noted a significant number of divorces in the city: 92 cases per 10,000 marriages. “The figure is fantastic … These figures say that modern legal marriage is a form that conceals essentially extramarital sexual relations and enables strawberry lovers to “legitimately” satisfy their appetites.”\n\nLenin read this article, and the discussion about “strawberries” led him into violent indignation … He published a reply to Sorokin, where he accused him and the magazine of preaching “serfdom.” “If 92 divorces per 10,000 marriages seems to Mr. Sorokin a fantastic figure, then it remains to be assumed that either the author lived and was brought up in some … monastery fenced off from life … or that this author distorts the truth in order to please the reaction … The actual number of actual divorces… is immeasurably higher everywhere. Russia in this respect differs from other countries only in that its laws do not consecrate hypocrisy.”\n\nLenin noted that none of the Western democracies was able to ensure the freedom of marriage and divorce, to protect all the rights of illegitimate children. Russia is the first country in the world to achieve this. As for the supporters of family “serfdom”, it is high time they were “politely escorted” to the West. “There is a real place for such serf-owners.” And these were not empty words – although the Economist magazine continued to be published even after this “discussion”, within a year its employees (and P. Sorokin) were sent abroad at the direction of Lenin.\n\nThe deportations in 1922-1923 affected many “Old Vekhites” (they were taken to the West by the famous “philosophical ships”). In connection with this, the following anecdote appeared: “The Slavophil philosopher, who is being expelled to the West, says:\n\n– Of course, it hurts to leave Russia. But rather than lie in your native holy land with a bullet in the back of your head, it’s better to stomp on the accursed Parisian boulevards.”\n\n“Scratch a communist and you will find a philistine.”\n\nThe revolution generally simplified and made more free communication between the sexes. The boundaries of speech decency have expanded, and it has become possible to discuss previously unthinkable, taboo topics. Boys and girls began to be taught together in schools (which was not the case in Tsarist Russia).\n\nThe very habitual relationship between husband and wife, according to the plan of the Bolsheviks, was subject to a complete change. “In all civilized countries,” Lenin said, “even the most advanced, the position of women is such that it is not for nothing that they are called domestic slaves.” Women “remain in ‘domestic slavery’… crushed by the smallest, blackest, heaviest, most mind-numbing kitchen work.”\n\nIn 1920, Lenin remarked to Clara Zetkin: “Unfortunately, one can still say to many of our comrades: “Scratch a communist and you will find a philistine.” Of course, you need to scrape a sensitive place – his psyche in relation to a woman. Is there any clearer proof of this than the fact that men calmly watch women wear out in petty work, monotonous, exhausting and absorbing time and effort, work in the household; how their horizon narrows, their minds dim, their heartbeats become sluggish, their will weak… A woman’s domestic life is a daily sacrifice of herself in a thousand insignificant trifles… We must eradicate the old slave-owning point of view to the last minute its roots…\n\nThese words fully coincided with the general mood of the 1920s. And these moods can be judged by the popular ditties of that time:\n\nI’ll come home,\n\nI’ll plump with a swoop:\n\nDown with the trough,\n\nShitvo and the kitchen!\n\nWho does not call\n\nhis Wife: comrade, – You can’t\n\nboil\n\nWater with such a oak tree.\n\nDevils in the sky\n\nIt will be hot,\n\nIf the state is\n\nruled by a cook!\n\nA. Kollontai wrote about the ideal of a new woman: “Before us is not a female and the shadow of a man, before us is a personality, a “Man-woman” …\n\nTrue, in life this peppy scope sometimes got bogged down in an impenetrable swamp. Even in relation to such a striking feature of the old “domostroevsky” life as domestic beatings. The conjugal fist for millions of women remained a more tangible and much more indestructible power than the power of the king himself. In the drawing by I. Malyutin in 1925, a worker beats his wife with a saucepan right under the portrait of Lenin.\n\n“Leave it, Herod, the murderer! Forgot what Comrade Lenin said?\n\n“M-shut up, fool! .. Maybe Lenin didn’t know that I was married.”\n\nIt cannot be said that the revolution completely eradicated domestic assault. Perhaps she managed to achieve only the “equality” of the spouses in this matter. In the 60s and 70s, a new figure became familiar on the pages of the humorous press: a wife waiting for a drunken husband with a kitchen rolling pin in her hands. Western journalist Karl Crane quoted Nikita Khrushchev as saying to a female audience: “In tsarist times, a man, offering you his hand and heart, said:“ I will love you like a soul and shake you like a pear … ”Today you yourself beat their husbands. This proves that we are on the road to communism.”\n\n“The custom of beating children has not yet been abolished.”\n\nThe Bolsheviks banned the custom of corporal punishment of schoolchildren (flogging with rods), which existed in Russia until 1917. This abolition turned out to be final (at least until the beginning of the 21st century, flogging in schools was never restored). The fight against domestic corporal punishment of children has been far less successful…\n\nIn 1920, Lenin spoke with two Japanese journalists. He asked them curiously:\n\n“Gentlemen, is it true that in Japan they never punish children or beat them?” I read about it in one book.\n\n“Yes,” answered one of his interlocutors, “we do not beat children. They take care of them more than in the West. In general, in Japan, a kind of cult of children …\n\n“Don’t they even give you a slap?” asked Lenin.\n\n– Not. We never hit children.\n\nYes, they are wonderful people! exclaimed Lenin enthusiastically. “This is real culture. This is very important. Indeed, in the most so-called civilized countries of Europe, in Switzerland, for example, the custom of beating children in schools has not yet been completely eliminated …\n\nVladimir Ilyich added that he and his comrades were “resolute opponents of all corporal punishment, and above all in relation to children.”\n\nOf course, the revolution within the school walls was not limited to the abolition of birch rods. The very behavior of schoolchildren in the classroom has become much more relaxed, freer. The gymnasium uniform was abolished (it was reintroduced in the 1940s). The satirist Dol in 1917 in the liberal magazine Lukomorye described the “revolution” among children:\n\nScared your mom.\n\nKolya raised the banner: –\n\nAway with birch porridge,\n\nSince the will has come! ..\n\n– Cancel without delay, –\n\nCalls are heard, –\n\nThe entire multiplication table,\n\nMountains and bays! –\n\nEight-year-old es-decks\n\nIn the demands of the rack: –\n\nBan soon forever\n\nAll colas and deuces! – A\n\nBolshevik of the same class\n\nInserted, full of ardor: –\n\nTo spit, so that Mama\n\nBalaban bought us !!! –\n\nJoyful streams of will\n\nburst into their hearts.\n\nHow, bourgeois teachers,\n\nyou haven’t given up yet?!\n\n“The unconditional repeal of all laws against abortion.”\n\nThe Bolsheviks legalized abortion for the first time in Europe. As early as 1913, Lenin advocated “the unconditional repeal of all laws prosecuting abortion.” He attributed the right to abortion to “the elementary democratic rights of a citizen and a citizen.”\n\nOn November 18, 1920, Lenin signed a decree authorizing abortion. From now on, all women have the right to artificially terminate a pregnancy during the first three months. As Leon Trotsky believed, in the future, “the very concept of legislation on abortion and divorce will … sound little better than memories of brothels or human sacrifices.” Any prescriptions of the law in family and sexual life will become superfluous.\n\nThe press savored the fashionable topic with pleasure, printing articles, poems and drawings about the “right to have an abortion” (not always approvingly). Some journalists noted with alarm the outbreak of the “abortion pandemic”. Sometimes the theme of abortion was combined with the equally fashionable theme of theomachism. For example, in 1924, in a cartoon by Konstantin Gotov in the Crocodile magazine, the pregnant Virgin Mary was looking at a street theater poster. The performance was called “Abortion”. The Mother of God exclaimed sorrowfully; “Why, why didn’t I know before!”\n\nTrue, the common joke turned out to be double-edged: soon such jokes were already told about the mothers of the leaders of the Soviet state …\n\nDespite the right to abortion, the birth rate in Red Russia increased in the 1920s. This was facilitated by the famous “maternity leave” for women – it began two months before the birth of the child and ended one and a half months after the birth. All this time the woman received a full salary. In 1920, 21.7 babies were born per thousand people in Russian cities, and in 1923 (after abortion was allowed) – 35.3. In 1927, there were already 45 births per thousand people.\n\n“Freedom of abortion” in the USSR remained until June 1936, when abortion was again banned. From now on, a woman who made an underground abortion was threatened with public censure or a fine, and more severe punishment awaited the doctors who committed it. The ban led to a new surge in the birth rate: the number of newborns in Moscow increased by 65 percent. But the number of infanticides has also risen sharply.\n\nThe writer Andre Gide, who visited the USSR at that time, disapproved of the law. “The recent law on the prohibition of abortion,” he wrote, “plunged into despair all those whose low wages do not allow them to create their own home, start a family. He plunged many into despair for other reasons as well. Were they not promised in connection with this law something like a plebiscite, a nationwide discussion, the results of which were to be reckoned with? The vast majority spoke out (though more or less openly) against this law. Public opinion was not taken into account, and, to everyone’s amazement, the law passed. The newspapers printed, of course, only approving remarks. In private conversations that I had with many workers, I heard only humble reproaches, timid complaints.\n\nLenin and non-traditional forms of love.\n\nOne of the decrees signed by Lenin canceled the old tsarist Code of Punishment, which provided for penal servitude for sexual relations between men. Soviet Russia was one of the first countries in the world to decriminalize same-sex love. For comparison: in Britain, the criminal prosecution of homosexuals was canceled only in 1967, and in West Germany – in 1969.\n\nIn 1925, the Soviet physician Grigory Batkis, in his book The Sexual Revolution in the Soviet Union, explained the established point of view on homosexuality and sodomy (sexual intercourse with animals) as follows: nobody’s interests are affected… As for homosexuality, sodomy and various other forms of sexual satisfaction, which are considered by European laws to be a violation of public morality, Soviet legislation treats them in exactly the same way as so-called “natural” intercourse. All forms of sexual intercourse are a private matter.”\n\nIn the summer of 1918, the poet Ioann Pavlushin developed the following project in the Moscow newspaper Our Sermon in the Moscow newspaper: in order to improve the human race, the whole society should give up childbearing for ten years. “With these words, I do not want to say that we will have to not copulate for 10 years – no! It is possible and even necessary to copulate, but all safety precautions must be put in place, and only beautiful children should be given … A child from three beautiful generations should become the property of the state and be in the position of a factory queen or a factory male … Of course, with such reforms I foresee in advance the bias of human love towards animals, and even with copulation with the more graceful and interesting breeds of them … Then only a person can again feel in paradise and among the animals that he will take and to which he will in turn give himself. .\n\nI need a woman as a body, A\n\nbeautiful boy for delight.\n\nAnd for love and ecstasy\n\nI need a purebred dog.\n\nPerhaps the most famous supporter of same-sex love in Russia in the 10s and 20s was the poet Mikhail Kuzmin (symbolist, then acmeist). He deliberately did not hide the nature of his intimate life, preached it in verse and prose, and in general behaved with unusual emancipation for that time. Kuzmin welcomed the February Revolution, and then the October Revolution (he even once called himself a Bolshevik). He dedicated poems to the 1917 revolution:\n\nThe Russian revolution – youthful,\n\nchaste, good –\n\nDoes not repeat, only sees a brother in a Frenchman,\n\nAnd passes along the sidewalks, simple,\n\nLike an angel in a working blouse.\n\n“Journal of Journals” on this occasion caustically remarked that “M. Kuzmin, before the revolution, among all the proletarians, only bath attendants distinguished him with love. And posted these verses:\n\nHe had fun with the goat for a long time,\n\nHe stubbornly praised the attendants,\n\nThough we begged with tears:\n\n– Kuzmin, it’s embarrassing! Here are the ladies…\n\nNow, having sewn a huge red bow\n\nto the chest of the lascivious muse,\n\nHe praises, like a dandy in love,\n\nThe face of an “angel in a working blouse”…\n\nThe very first close friend of Kuzmin at the turn of the 19th-20th centuries was Georgy Chicherin, later a well-known Bolshevik. They had been friends since their high school years, and their extensive correspondence has been preserved. Chicherin, a descendant of an old noble family, was considered the most refined and “aristocratic” among the Bolsheviks. In the last years of his life, he wrote a book about Mozart and remarked: “I had a revolution and Mozart, the revolution was real, and Mozart was a foretaste of the future …” Like Kuzmin, Chicherin did not hide his non-traditional sexual orientation.\n\nIn May 1918, Lenin appointed Chicherin People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs. Evidently, Vladimir Ilyich was of the opinion on this question, which (on another occasion) he once expressed thus: “Eccentricity is not a violation of the duties of a socialist and democrat… It is impossible in a big party without big eccentrics!”\n\nTrue, after the revolution, Chicherin met Kuzmin only once, in 1926. They talked like old friends, on “you”. The People’s Commissar thoughtfully asked: “Why do you publish little? Do you write a little? .. “\n\nIn the diary after this meeting, the poet wrote: “A general sensation with Chicherin. Everyone is surprised that I didn’t ask him for anything, but I think it’s better this way.” In 1929, Kuzmin published his last large book of poems, The Trout Breaks the Ice…\n\nLenin did not see anything wrong in admiring male beauty. L. Fotieva recalled that once they started talking about one people’s commissar. “Vladimir Ilyich asked me: “Is it so beautiful?” “I didn’t notice,” I replied. Another time, Vladimir Ilyich stood for a long time at the bedside of a sleeping 13-year-old boy in a friend’s apartment and, moving away, said: “A handsome boy.”\n\nNot all Bolsheviks shared a tolerant attitude towards same-sex love. So, in 1907, Maxim Gorky (then a Bolshevik) wrote about the work of decadent poets: “All these are old slaves, people who cannot help but confuse freedom with pederasty, for example, for them the “liberation of a person” is strangely mixed with displacement. it from one garbage pit to another, and sometimes even reduced to the freedom of a member and – nothing more.\n\nSince the mid-1920s, the attitude of society towards same-sex love began to gradually return to the former, pre-revolutionary one. Now it was called “disease”. And since March 1934, it has turned into a “crime”: in the USSR, criminal prosecution for sodomy was restored. From now on, the perpetrators faced up to five years in prison, and this law was widely applied until 1993. In May 1934, Maxim Gorky (who had already become a non-partisan) wrote triumphantly in Pravda: “In a country where the proletariat manages courageously and successfully, homosexuality, which corrupts youth, is recognized as socially criminal and punishable, and in a “cultural” country of great philosophers, scientists, musicians (Germany. – A. M.), he acts freely and with impunity. There is already a sarcastic saying: “destroy homosexuals – fascism will disappear!”\n\nHowever, neither Kuzmin nor Chicherin were affected by the new law. Both of them died in 1936.\n\n“Our youth have gone berserk at the ‘glass of water’ theory.”\n\nLenin, like other Bolsheviks, had a negative attitude towards prostitution. A. Kollontai explained this attitude: “Nothing devastates the soul so much as the evil of the forced sale and purchase of other people’s caresses. Prostitution extinguishes love in the hearts; Eros flies away from her in fear, afraid to stain his golden wings on a mud-splattered bed.\n\nLenin saw something similar to prostitution in any sexual relationship without love, even if it was a “legal marriage.” Meanwhile, it was precisely this attitude towards sex that won out during the revolution. People “did not have enough time” for falling in love, romantic love. The famous theory was born that the satisfaction of sexual feelings should be taken lightly – something like draining a glass of water.\n\nIn 1918, the liberal newspaper The Cry of the People condemned: “Today, as in 1905, a number of unions of free love have arisen. Members of the unions arrange real orgies, Athenian nights, where they give full rein to their desires, which, according to their concepts, are “true freedom”. The newspaper cited the anthem of one of these unions:\n\nAway with reason! Burn the body,\n\nIt will be colorful, bright, bold!\n\nA daring, youthful choir will burst out;\n\nAll in the abyss, all in the fire!\n\nLet there be collapse, fires all around, –\n\nIn our heart there is a whirlwind, fumes!\n\nThere is a thrill of caress in our hearts – Masks\n\nfall off deceitful faces ! Who is mad in pleasure, He will understand where there is oblivion! What awaits us? And death and hunger! Everything is in the abyss – after all, you are young! .. The moment is dear to us! Drink joy. There is still sweetness in the glasses!.. In the hour of ecstasy, in the hour of desires, Life will flash with a million facets. Better burn yourself in victory\n\nThan die a pale death.\n\nSo drop the chains from your body, Throw\n\nyourself boldly on the feast of the beast ! Our gods are moments, fairy tales, Our gods are glances , caresses… Beauty and passion are sacred That’s where the gods are, the bottom of the sea !\n\nAleksandra Kollontai was a resolute opponent of the “glass of water” theory. “Modern man has no time to “love,” she noted with regret in the same 1918. – In a society based on the beginning of competition, with the most severe struggle for existence … there is no room for the cult of the demanding and fragile “Eros” … How many valuable hours for the “business” take on one “dating”! Later, in the 1920s, Kollontai developed these thoughts: “In the face of the formidable face of the great rebel – the revolution – the gentle-winged Eros (“god of love”) had to fearfully disappear from the surface of life. There was neither time nor excess of spiritual strength for love “joys and tortures.” Therefore, according to Kollontai, in the days of the revolution, “plucked, wingless Eros” – “the bodily attraction of sex” won. But the time of winged Eros will yet come. “What will this new transformed Eros be like? The most daring fantasy is powerless to capture his appearance.\n\nKollontai’s regret about the death of “winged Eros”, apparently, was shared by Lenin to some extent. He did not like the fact that the freedom of love turned into “freedom without love.” He told Clara Zetkin:\n\n“I, an old man, do not like it. Although I am least of all a gloomy ascetic, the so-called new sexual life of young people – and often adults as well – quite often seems to me … a kind of good bourgeois brothel. All this has nothing to do with the freedom of love, as we … understand it. Of course, you know the famous theory that in a communist society, satisfying sexual desires and love needs is as simple and insignificant as drinking a glass of water. From this theory of “a glass of water” our young people went berserk, they went berserk. This theory has become the fate of many young men and women… I consider the famous “glass of water” theory to be completely un-Marxist and, moreover, anti-social… Of course, thirst requires satisfaction. But will a normal person under normal conditions lie on the street in the mud and drink from a puddle? Or even from a glass, the edge of which is captured by dozens of lips?\n\n“I don’t have the slightest sympathy for the “glass of water” theory, even if it was labeled “liberated love.” In addition, it is not new … You probably remember that this theory was preached in belles lettres around the middle of the last century as “emancipation of the heart.” In bourgeois practice, it turned into the emancipation of the body. The preaching at that time was more talented than it is now; how things stand in practice, I cannot judge.”\n\nLenin was aware that on questions of sexual life he was in the minority.\n\n“I know, I know,” he remarked, “I am also suspected enough of philistinism in connection with this. But I take it easy. Yellow-mouthed chicks, barely hatched from the egg of bourgeois views, are always terribly smart. We have to put up with it, but we do not intend to “correct” ourselves.”\n\nAt the same time, he made the reservation: “Nothing could be more false than to start preaching to young people monastic asceticism and the holiness of dirty bourgeois morality …”\n\nLenin defined his ideal in the field of sexual life as “open free love.” He explained it with such negative examples: “Not a monk, not Don Juan, but not a German philistine, as something in between.” And from what, in fact, should love be free? Lenin in one of his letters listed: first of all, from monetary settlements and material worries (this is the main thing), and in addition:\n\n– from religious prejudices;\n\n– from the prohibition of daddy etc;\n\n– from the prejudices of “society”;\n\n– from the bonds of law, court and police …\n\nThe freedom to dissolve marriage introduced by the revolution continued in the USSR until 1944, when the law again made marriage almost indissoluble. Of course, Lenin’s statements against the “glass of water” theory served as the rationale for these new measures. It’s funny that now the authorship of the “glass of water” theory itself was attributed to … Alexandra Kollontai.\n\n“They promise bread, but they give a stone.”\n\nIt hardly needs to be argued that nutrition is far from the last topic in any revolution. Among the revolutionary slogans, “culinary” ones are sure to sound. Of course, this was also the case with the October Revolution; the sailors and Red Guards who stormed the Winter Palace sang with pleasure the ditty of the futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky:\n\nEat pineapples, chew grouse.\n\nYour last day is coming, bourgeois.\n\nAs you can see, the revolution immediately included symbolically luxurious dishes (pineapples and hazel grouses) in the ranks of the culinary “White Guard”. The fight against them at that time was also facilitated by the general lack of food. The American socialist Albert Rees Williams said that the menu was changed in the National Hotel in Moscow, where Lenin settled in March 1918: “The new, Soviet regime, first of all, abolished exquisite and expensive dishes here. The large number of dishes that made up dinner was reduced to two. You could get either soup and meat, or soup and porridge.” So, according to Williams, the rule was: “No one should eat cakes until everyone has received bread.”\n\nIf you leaf through the Soviet press of 1918-1919, it is striking that one of the main topics for jokes and caricatures is writing (or rather, its lack). Characteristic note: “It is reported that the famous artist B. I. Kustodzhiev, fascinated by one topic, cannot start work due to the lack of nature.\n\n“I need,” the artist explains, “a plump Russian woman with dimples on her elbows.\n\nThe task is indeed difficult in our hungry time.\n\nHorse meat suddenly became the most luxurious dish. The Menshevik newspaper “Always Forward!” in 1919, Ellen epicly asked in verse:\n\nTell me, cutlet from “horse meat”,\n\n“Where did you grow up, where did you bloom”?\n\nWhat kind of animal or cattle\n\nwere you a living part? ..\n\nJoke: “In the kitchen.\n\n— Listen! What are these horse meat cutlets, I have nothing, but why are they so small?\n\n“Very simple: they are made of ponies.”\n\n“The horses of Baron Klodt have not yet been eaten,” ironically reported in the summer of 1918 the newspaper “Devil’s Pepper Pot”. A popular ditty of that time is also dedicated to horse meat:\n\nLenin said to Trotsky:\n\nLet’s go, Leva, to the market.\n\nLet’s buy a brown horse, Let’s\n\nfeed the proletariat.\n\nIt is curious that it was in the hungry years of 1918-1919 that the famous poetic cafes became famous in the capitals: “The Tenth Muse”, “Red Rooster”, “Musical Snuffbox”, “Pegasus Stall” (and here, too, there was a “horse” theme) .. They feasted mainly on underground traders and raiders. Journalist L. Vasilevsky in 1919 described what this luxury of the era of “war communism” looked like: the wall of the Moscow cafe of poets-imaginists “Domino” was decorated with a shocking slogan “Lord, calve!”, And black pants hung nearby served as the highlight of the decoration. “Elegant, pale, “cocaine” type waiter girls flash by. They make their way between closely spaced tables in a commercial way, deliver meat dishes, coffee, tea, biscuits and in the most bourgeois way, although maintaining a mask of negligence and satiety on their faces, collect tips money … On the counter stands cold veal, slices of white biscuits… Whose stomachs are designed to satisfy all these things? Take a closer look at the visitors, and it will become clear to you that there is a tiny handful of literature here – she huddles in the corners and drinks five-ruble glasses of tea with saccharin. And a “real” guest, a “serious” one, is anyone, but not writers, not poets, not people of spiritual interests … “\n\nBut poetic cafes still served the “elite”, and what kind of food could a simple person please himself in those years? In 1919, the Moscow Socialist-Revolutionary newspaper Delo Naroda talked about the famous Sukharevsky market – the center of the capital’s trade (essay by K. Burevoy):\n\n“Here is the diner… People are rubbing against each other; crush, crush. The pleasantly tickling smell of fried food stimulates the appetite. Pots, pans, entire tanks sizzle; boiled, heated, roasted…\n\n– Fried sausage is hot! Ham! Salo, salo!\n\n– And here is hot millet porridge! Come on! Come on, come on!..\n\nThe porridge is real, it smells good. Eat 13-14 p. portion. You can get rubles for 5-10 small buns, a glass of hot milk for 6-7 rubles, a portion of fried potatoes with horse meat for 15 rubles. There are a lot of hot pies and cheesecakes. There are many hunters for this delicacy … There are even real white cakes and cookies. Lots of bacon, ham… butter…\n\nHuge samovars stand on the tables, from which the audience is treated to tea and coffee. Sugar is sold right there: for twenty 8 pieces. Lots of sweetness…\n\nAn elderly lady in a hat and pince-nez sells potato cakes:\n\n– Take it, take it! 5 rub. thing!\n\nAnd here are the red-cheeked village women. They exchanged a lot of various goods and materials for bread, and with difficulty, scattering and picking up purchases, they drag them with shining faces.\n\nBy selling flour and bread, the peasants and dealers (“bagmen”) frankly enriched themselves at the expense of the impoverished urban population – and this caused indignation among many. Ordinary bread or flour was the hardest thing to buy. Sergei Razzyava in 1919 in the same “Case of the People” published “The Poem of the Roll”:\n\nAh, bun, bun!\n\nAbout her, about lush,\n\nhot,\n\nLike a sigh of the steppes, I sigh\n\nloudly,\n\nI grumble rebelliously\n\n(Although inaudibly)\n\nAbout her, about her!\n\nI want elastic,\n\nShamefully rich,\n\nBlush white, Like a\n\nday – stronger.\n\nI’m flying like a blizzard,\n\nAnywhere,\n\nLike a frantic one,\n\nAfter her, after her.\n\nI’ll give it blindly\n\nAnd stupidly,\n\nThrough laughter and tears,\n\nMy goodness, –\n\nAnd all the Soviet deputies,\n\nAnd the executive committees,\n\nAnd the economic councils, –\n\nEverything – for her!\n\nOn the caricature of Alexei Radakov, Prime Minister Lenin (with angel wings behind his back) on the occasion of May Day 1918 presented a worker with a red flower on a platter:\n\n“Here, my dear, eat. Red clove. Your favorite dish.\n\n– Eh! To this dish and a side dish of potatoes, but beef !!”\n\nIn the drawing by the artist Mikhailov-Severny, an emaciated woman in a kokoshnik (Russia) asked Lenin: “Give bread, breadwinner.” Overlaid with piles of signed decrees, he brushed aside: “Wait … You see, things are in full swing.”\n\nCuriously, a similar scene actually happened during one of Lenin’s visits to the former Michelson factory. An old woman said to him:\n\n“They would give us more bread!” He replied:\n\nYes, we don’t have any bread. This is true. But we will have it… Here we will beat the whites – and then we will have bread… And who promises you bread immediately? Enemies… But keep your eyes open: they promise you bread, but they give you a stone.\n\nVladimir Ilyich himself was also not completely alien to thoughts about the “bun”. In December 1919, in a conversation with a Samara resident, he dreamily remarked: “Yes, Samara … I remember what wonderful rolls they baked there! And now, probably, the Samara people eat real bread, and we have to be content with a surrogate … “\n\nIn the newspapers of 1918, one can still find advertisements for anti-obesity drugs: “Your stomach is growing exorbitantly. You are flabby, become stooped, inelegant. You have a sluggish stomach … Put on an elastic male belt … obesity will decrease. In the press of 1919, such advertisements are no longer found. The feuilletonist Otsoli cheerfully wrote in the Red Devil magazine: “Some diseases, such as: excessive fullness, lack of appetite, spleen, sugar disease, etc., have completely disappeared from the environment of bourgeois society.”\n\nThe Bolshevik P. Lepeshinsky recalled how in the summer of 1918 he received Vladimir Ilyich and his wife at his home. The owner treated the guests to the most chic dish at that time – horsemeat dumplings. Lenin had nothing against horse meat, he often ate it while in exile and emigration and found it “very tasty.” “But alas,” Lepeshinsky continued, “neither Ilyich nor Nadezhda Konstantinovna touched our “luxurious” treat. The presence of white flour testified to the fact that here, apparently, there had not been a deal with some bagman – and this was a very reprehensible thing at that time – and, in all likelihood, both of my main guests decided not to betray their modest habits adapted to the era of the brutal struggle against bagging. Lenin politely explained that he was unwell, and therefore he would not be able to eat dumplings.\n\nThe attitude that the underground grain trade evoked in the summer of 1918 can be judged from this occasion. (It was described by the opposition Blue Journal.) Some woman decided to sell baked bread in addition to milk at the market. The indignant crowd grabbed the loaf from her hands and threw it into the river … Following the bread, the merchant herself almost flew into the water.\n\nBy the way, another folk ditty of those years “convicted” Trotsky and Lenin of precisely this indecent crime – bagging.\n\nLenin said to Trotsky: “\n\nI got a sack of flour.\n\nFor me – Easter cake, for you – matzo,\n\nLamza-dritsa, gop-tsa-tsa.\n\nSometimes Lenin, like many in those years, had to drink carrot tea at home. The color of this drink resembled strong brewed real tea, it even felt a faint sweet taste. Instead of sugar, saccharin was often added to tea.\n\n“Isn’t it carrot tea?” Lenin laughed. – Especially when there is no Indian. Hot and very good…\n\nAn employee of the Council of People’s Commissars, Elizaveta Koksharova, recalled the following scene: one of the peasants who met with Lenin “took a loaf of bread out of his knapsack and solemnly handed it to Vladimir Ilyich.\n\n“You need bread here,” said the peasant.\n\nVladimir Ilyich was very embarrassed.\n\n“I don’t even have time to eat it all,” he joked.\n\nThis ancient custom – to give a loaf of bread – has been going on since the days of serfdom, when the peasants considered their master, or even the father-tsar himself, to be such a gift … Lenin himself perfectly understood this parallel. “They send them like a gentleman,” he complained about such gifts. – How do you get rid of it? Refuse, do not accept – offend. And everyone is starving. Nonsense”. Peasants did not give loaves to Lenin’s comrades-in-arms.\n\nV. Bonch-Bruevich told another story about bread, dating back to 1918. At that time, bread was not given out on cards every day – sometimes it was replaced with oats. And the barmaid Lisa, who was serving tea to the head of the government, once complained bitterly in public:\n\n– Well, how can I go to Vladimir Ilyich. There is not a piece of bread, and they called that it will not be today …\n\nThe lamentations of a girl in a white apron were heard by a casual visitor to Smolny – some kind of soldier.\n\n– How, – he was amazed, – Vladimir Ilyich does not have bread to drink tea? .. Well, no, this will not happen, with whom, with whom, but with our Vladimir Ilyich I will share all the latest …\n\n“And with a deft movement of his shoulder he dropped the bag; from behind the top he took out a large folding knife, wiped it on the top of his boot, then on his hollow overcoat, took out a round soldier’s loaf of bread from the bag, pressed it to his chest and cut off a good weighty crust with one stroke.\n\n– Here, bring it to him, tell him that from the front, from a passing soldier …\n\n“Lisa blossomed, smiled, and solemnly, sticking her tray forward, quickly, like a duck, rushed to the cabinet doors.” A minute later, Vladimir Ilyich himself looked out from there:\n\n– Thank you, comrade, this is the most delicious bread I have ever eaten …\n\nSuch touching stories, included in Soviet anthologies, were poisonously ridiculed by the folklore of the 70s:\n\n“War, winter, famine, cold. Dzerzhinsky comes to Lenin and sees – Lenin is sitting and drinking hot tea as a bite. Felix Edmundovich says:\n\n“Why don’t you put sugar in your tea, Vladimir Ilyich?”\n\n“So it doesn’t dissolve anymore!”\n\nOr: “Somehow walkers come to Lenin, they complain:\n\n— Vladimir Ilyich! We are starving – no strength! Swell with hunger! How to live?\n\n– Eat weed.\n\n– So we’ll close soon!\n\n– Well, guys! Yesterday Felix Edmundovich and I knocked down a cask of mead – so we don’t buzz! …\n\n“We need a skilled chef.”\n\nDespite the shortage of food, Lenin made sure that his colleagues ate as satisfying and even tasty as possible. People’s Commissar for Food Alexander Tsyurupa in 1918, in his presence, experienced several hunger faints. Tsyurupa himself embarrassedly joked: “The people’s commissar of food is malnourished …”\n\nFor which he received a written reprimand from Lenin. He composed and signed such a half-joking text: “For a careless attitude to state property (2 seizures), A.D. Tsyurupe is announced the 1st warning and is ordered to immediately go home … Lenin.” Next note: “Dear A.D.! You become absolutely impossible in dealing with state property. Prescription: three weeks to be treated! .. Hey, it’s unforgivable to throw around poor health in vain. The motivation here is most curious: Lenin calls on his employees to take care of themselves – if not for their own sake, but for the sake of the cause (quite in Rakhmetov’s way), as “state property.” He often spoke to them with a smile. “You need to be held accountable for your careless attitude to the state good – to yourself!”\n\nAnd in 1919, Lenin told his secretary Lidia Fotieva: “Look at your comrades. Some have become so emaciated that they simply look impossible … Select for a start the thirty most emaciated, most hungry people, and organize a dining room … “\n\nThis canteen was open, and the head of the Council of People’s Commissars closely followed its work. At first, they cooked in it very unimportantly. “The canteen was shared,” Trotsky recalled. – They fed then in the Kremlin very badly. Instead of meat, they gave corned beef. Flour and cereals were with sand. Only red salmon caviar was plentiful… It is not only in my memory that the first years of the revolution are painted with this unchanging caviar…” Lenin told Gorky: “People work literally to the point of fainting, they need to be fed deliciously so that they eat more. I know that food is scarce and bad – it needs a skilled cook.\n\n“And,” wrote Gorky. – quoted some hygienist’s reasoning about the role of tasty spices in the process of nutrition and digestion. I asked:\n\nHow do you manage to think about such things? He also asked:\n\n– About rational nutrition?\n\nAnd in the tone of his words he made me understand that my question was inappropriate.\n\nIn 1919, Lenin somehow went into the kitchen of the Kremlin cadets. I tasted cabbage soup with horsemeat and wheat porridge.\n\n– The first is nothing, tasty, although horse meat, but the porridge is bad … Soak this wheat with boiling water for at least a day, then you will see what kind of porridge will turn out.\n\nA couple of days later I went back:\n\n– Well, how’s the porridge?\n\nTried.\n\n– Well, you see, very good porridge.\n\nLenin got annoyed if he noticed that they were trying to feed him more tasty than his colleagues. “I remember,” Krupskaya wrote, “how he got angry at some bucket of halvah that the then commandant of the Kremlin, comrade, brought him. Malkov “…\n\nVladimir Ilyich did not approve of the “excesses” of his colleagues. Sculptor Nathan Altman, who sculpted a portrait of Lenin, told such a literary anecdote. Once, in the summer of 1919, people’s commissars, sitting in the Kremlin, “feasted” – they ate lard (at that time it was an exquisite delicacy). The windows were wide open due to the heat, and visitors to the Kremlin could admire their meal. This was reported to Lenin. He summoned the participants of the feast to his office and began to scold them cruelly. At the same time, according to Altman’s story, he was indignant: “There is hunger in the country, devastation, the situation is arch-pagan, and at the same time the people’s commissars are sitting and eating lard! What a shame! After all, you are all Bolsheviks with pre-revolutionary experience! Conspirators! Couldn’t the curtain be drawn? People don’t need to know everything!\n\nWith the introduction of the New Economic Policy, rich, refined dishes returned to everyday life. The transition from horse meat to more refined food was reflected in the joke: “Nepman sells cheap hazel grouse cutlets. He is asked:\n\nBut hazel grouse is very expensive. How do you manage to make meatballs cheap?\n\n– And I, you know, in half. One hazel grouse, one horse … “\n\nThe feuilletonist Swift in 1922 described the lifestyle of the new era as follows:\n\n“Where do you have lunch? a friend from Mostorg asked me.\n\nI named the restaurant.\n\n– Rubbish! he snapped.\n\n– Quite right, rubbish, and three hundred and fifty thousand dinner.\n\n“That’s why it’s rubbish, it’s so cheap. Better go to “Empire”. We had dinner there yesterday. There were four of us. Left the fourth.\n\n“Two and a half million?”\n\nNo, twenty-five. We drank a little. Well, of course, caviar, balychok. In general, inexpensive. What is twenty-five million! .. “\n\nBegemot magazine wrote these verses about dietary change:\n\nLet’s remember, brothers, about food\n\nIn the nineteenth year.\n\nProd-cases were bad!\n\nVobla was a luxury.\n\nBut a number of past years\n\nChanged to luxury view:\n\n– Today, salmon and salmon\n\nDo not count as chic.\n\nHowever, along with luxurious meals, the old inequality in nutrition has also returned. There was abundance in the grocery stores, but not everyone could afford this abundance. N. Zub’s joke, typical for those years:\n\n“At the window of the candy store.\n\n– Senka! look, the cakes are so magnificent, this one in cherries would have shrunk.\n\n– Well, he has! one sour.\n\n– Have you tried it yet?\n\n“Yes… I licked him through the glass.”\n\nIt was during the years of the New Economic Policy (NEP) that a particularly sharp struggle against luxurious dishes unfolded. Of course, no one introduced direct prohibitions on them, especially in domestic life (although such examples are known in history, for example, in ancient Rome). But they tried to deprive these dishes of the main thing – the halo of desirability, the unique taste of success in life. Those who ate modestly and poorly could now feel a certain inner superiority over the visitor to a posh restaurant.\n\n“I’m doing well,” says the Nepman in Tom’s 1924 drawing. “The family is dressed, shod, on the table there is vodka, and liqueur, and salmon, and balychok, and caviar … What am I missing?”\n\n“Conscience,” the worker replies glumly.\n\nAt the head of the edible “white guard” were dishes that were still available to ordinary people – but only on holidays: dishes such as the Christmas goose, Easter cakes … They were ridiculed most of all. Christmas ditties 1924:\n\nHe offered me sweet tea,\n\nAnd a goose, and a duck,\n\nI said: “I don’t want,\n\nThis is prejudice!”\n\nBefore the roast goose\n\nWe ate at Christmas.\n\nAnd now my Marusya\n\nCancels it.\n\nPancakes were also attacked – one of the most traditional and ancient dishes, originating from pagan times. More recently, the dominance of pancakes in Russian cuisine seemed eternal and unshakable. In 1913, the fantastic story “Pancake Vision” was published. It described the execution of a heretic who dared to deny pancakes. But now such heretics have appeared in reality. The poet R. Volzhenin wrote on Maslenitsa in 1923 (putting the words of Karl Marx “Being determines consciousness” as an epigraph to his poems):\n\nI’m fair to pancakes.\n\nI don’t eat pancakes.\n\nDamn, only food – no more than sausages.\n\nBut there is a category of people who are in love with pancakes,\n\ncaptured by a pancake, blinded by a pancake.\n\nAnd why – we will analyze “Marxist”.\n\nSturgeon. Salmon. Golden balls.\n\nWhite-bodied, ruddy, openwork pancakes.\n\nEmeralds in decanters ignited herbalists.\n\nFeelings, eyes, conversations are directed to pancakes.\n\nOiled lips. In salmon – teeth. Adam’s apples are moving.\n\nAn aggravating vest is unbuttoned under the napkin.\n\nGlass-fork, fork-glass – do not go out of hand.\n\nCrap. Zubrovka. – Crap. Leaflet. – Crap. Oporto. – Crap. Kcharet.\n\nEverything is forgotten at the trough in the rapture of grub.\n\nEat with gusto. Dull varnish covers the eyes.\n\nTears of “brothers”? The pig’s brain of this fat head\n\nCan only touch the cheese with an appetizing tear.\n\nThou"
