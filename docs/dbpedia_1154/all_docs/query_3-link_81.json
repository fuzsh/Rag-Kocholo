        "text": "Bishop Joasaph (Bolotov) (1761-1799)\n\nJoasaph is an English spelling of the Russian name Ioasaph, Ioasaf.\n\nAlthough Bishop Joasaph (Bolotov) is not a part of Canadian history as such, his life and work are nevertheless at and in the foundation of the life of the whole of the Orthodox Church in North America. It is necessary that he be included in an attempt to tell the story of the history of Canadian Orthodox Church life.\n\nEarly life of Ivan Ilyich Bolotov\n\nIvan Ilyich Bolotov was born on 22 January, 1761, in the village of Strazhkov (Kashin district in the Tver province), in the Russian Empire, into the family of the local priest, Ilia Ivanovich Bolotov. His ancestors, first mentioned at the beginning of the 18th century, had for a long time served at the Temple of this village.\n\nHigher education\n\nAfter his initial education at the ecclesiastical school of a monastery in Kashin, he began in 1777 to study at seminaries in Tver and Yaroslavl, where he graduated with honours.\n\nHe then taught for 4 years at the Uglich ecclesiastical school in the Tver Oblast. During this period, he became convinced of his monastic vocation.\n\nMonastic tonsure, 1786\n\nIn 1786, Ivan Ilyich Bolotov was tonsured to be a monk at the Tolga Monastery near Yaroslavl, and he was given the name Joasaph.\n\nSeeking greater solitude, he later moved to the South Doroveyeva Desert monastery in Uglich. After that, on 31 March, 1792, he transferred to the Holy Transfiguration Monastery of Valaam at the northern end of Lake Ladoga.\n\nOrdinations\n\nThe dates of his diaconal and priestly ordinations are not yet known. They likely took place in one or both of the monasteries in which he lived.\n\nPastoral service\n\nBecause he was a monk, the Hieromonk Joasaph (Bolotov) served in his turn in the Temple(s) of the monastic community to which he belonged, and he fulfilled any other obediences that he was given by the abbot (\"igumen\") to do.\n\nBecause of his exemplary monastic life, he was raised to the dignity of archimandrite in 1793.\n\nMissionary volunteer, 1793\n\nWhen a directive was received in Valaam to assemble a missionary team to go to Alaska, Archimandrite Joasaph was appointed to lead this team of 10 monks. The missionary team included 4 hieromonks, a hierodeacon, 3 monks and 4 novices. About Archimandrite Joasaph, Igumen Nazariy (Kondratyev) commented that he “believes his wealth to be non-possessing”. With regard to missionary work, Igumen Nazariy (Kondratyev) added that he “defines himself solely by the feat of spreading the Christian law amongst the nations unenlightened by the truths of the Gospel”.\n\nThe missionary group departed from Saint Petersburg in 1793. After they departed from Saint Petersburg, Archimandrite Joasaph stopped in the city of Kashin in order to visit his sister, since it was on the route eastwards. During this visit, Archimandrite Joasaph saved the life of a drowning drunk peasant. He threw to the intoxicated man his only silk robe (\"riassa\") instead of a rope, and with that he pulled the man out of the quagmire.\n\nOne of the monks of the group was the well-known Saint Herman (Popov) (born 1750s ; reposed 15 November, 1836). The Monk Herman was an ordinary monk. He was never ordained. He embodied the missionary vision and purpose of the Church. Living faithfully with those he loved in Christ until the end of his life, He is perceived by the Alaskan indigenous peoples to be very present with them still. His personal witness, life-example and active intercession remain very much alive and influential in our lives until this day. His life is a clear example of Christ-like humility. Portions of his relics are found in many countries. He outlived all the other monks, and he continued their missionary work until the very end of his life.\n\nThe other monks included : Hieromonk Makariy (Alexandrov) ; Hieromonk Iuvenaliy (Hovorukhin) ; Hieromonk Athanasiy (Mikhailov) ; Hierodeacon Nectariy (Panov) ; the novices Mikhail Feodorovich Hovorukhin, Cosma Alekseev Telepnev (according to other sources, Evseev), Dimitri Avdeev and Nikita Semenov.\n\nPreparation of the missionary labourers\n\nIn preparation for their departure, Metropolitan Gabriel (Petrov) of Novgorod and Saint Petersburg gave them instructions based on the model composed in 1769 for the Tobolsk Diocese, as well as written instruction from himself. Metropolitan Gabriel (Petrov), who called their service apostolic, formulated a number of disciplinary-canonical instructions for the members of the mission. He advised that in all things they help the local residents, and that they gradually and carefully accustom them to prayer and fasting. An oath was attached to the instructions, implying the special responsibility of the missionaries. In addition, the metropolitan provided the missionaries with a Liturgical Gospel Book in a silver setting ; other vessels ; a silver censer ; vestments. He also added 45 liturgical books from the Saint Alexander Nevsky Lavra, and other liturgical books and spiritual literature which were published by the Moscow Synodal Printing House.\n\nOn 25 December, 1793, the missionary group left for Moscow. From Moscow, they departed on 22 January, 1794, for Siberia. The route that the missionaries took towards the mission in Alaska passed through Irkutsk, where they arrived on 16 March, 1794. There, at the request of Archimandrite Joasaph, on 20 April, 1794, the novice Mikhail Hovorukhin (brother of the Hieromonk Juvenaly) was tonsured to be a monk. He was given the name Stefan. He was also ordained to the Holy Diaconate there on 30 April, 1794, by Bishop Benjamin (Bagryansky).\n\nOn 2 May, 1794, shipping opened with the breakup of ice on the Lena River, and the missionaries continued their journey. Already in Irkutsk, the monks had earned the respect of local residents, who saw them off “with great zeal and tears”. They next passed through Yakutsk. Already in Yakutsk, and afterwards, they met many Yakuts who were eager to be baptised. Wherever they stopped along the river, they found themselves baptising.\n\nThey arrived in Okhotsk, a port settlement on the Pacific coast, on 13 July, 1794. There, they met Mr. Gregory Shelikov, who provided the mission with utensils, clothes and food for 3 years. He also gave Archimandrite Joasaph the plan of the proposed Temple in Kodiak. The property of the mission was by now driven by 100 horses. Despite a storm, on 13 August, 1794, the missionaries departed from Okhotsk, aboard the ship \"Three Saints\". During their trek, the group was attacked by bears on one occasion while they were riding horses along the Lkhosh Road, but throughout the trip they had to endure the very thick clouds of mosquitoes which has been a common phenomenon in the far north, as well as black flies from time to time.\n\nKodiak, 1794\n\nOn 24 September, 1794, the monks arrived in the Pavlov Harbour of Kodiak Island, Alaska, after a 10-month journey from Saint Petersburg, the capital, in the far west of the Russian Empire. On Kodiak, the Shelikov-Golokov Company already had a settlement.\n\nFather Joasaph and the other monks were very fruitful in their missionary endeavours, and they baptised countless aboriginal persons. There were, however, numerous difficulties and abuses caused by the Russian colonists in Alaska, which Father Joasaph felt compelled to report to the civil and ecclesiastical authorities in Russia. For instance, in Alaska, they found conditions not to be as they had been represented to them by Shelikhov Gregory Ivanovich Shelikov, the promoter of the Alaskan business enterprise. The village on Kodiak was more primitive than described, and the Temple that had been promised did not exist. An antagonistic environment began to grow between Aleksandr A Baranov, the village leader, and Father Joasaph and his missionaries.\n\nKodiak Harbour at the time of Archimandrite Joasaph\n\nThe external successes of the Kodiak mission prompted the Most Holy Synod in April, 1796, to raise the question about the need to have a bishop in North America, with particular responsibility for that region. According to the archbishop of Irkutsk, in order to achieve the opening of the Kodiak diocese, Nil (Isakovich) and Gregory Shelikov exaggerated the local population almost tenfold (instead of a population of 5,000, he reported about 50,000 people). After his death (20 July, 1795), the petition came before the Most Holy Synod for the determination of whether or not to proceed with preparing for a bishop in North America. Ivan I Golikov continued ownership of the company after the death of Grigoriy Shelikhov. In April, 1796, Musin-Pushkin orally reported to the Empress Catherine II about the intention to establish a bishop in North America. An important role in making such a decision was played by the report on the state of the mission to members of the Synod by its interlocutor, the Tobolsk merchant Osip Pryanishnikov.\n\nOn 4 July, 1796, the Most Holy Synod reported to the empress about the state of missionary activity in North America and they confirmed the timeliness regarding sending a bishop there. According to the Imperial Decree of 19 July, 1796, the necessary confirmation of this need was given. It stated that, “by promoting the conversion of the peoples living in part of North America to the knowledge and acceptance of our Orthodox Faith with limited successes being made [...]”, the Most Holy Synod was given the authority “to establish this bishop as the Vicar-Bishop of the Irkutsk Diocese with the name of “Bishop of Kodiak” and other adjacent territories in addition to the islands in America ; appointing him and sustaining him with a house and needed servants as with other vicar-bishops from our treasury for 4,030 rubles and 18 kopecks annually. In this dignity, the new bishop to be sent to the mentioned islands for the teaching of the Gospel, the Archimandrite Joasaph, is to be ordained in Irkutsk”.\n\nOn 30 September, 1797, the Most Holy Synod addressed the Emperor Paul I for permission to invite Archimandrite Joasaph to Saint Petersburg for ordination as bishop. They explained that if the archimandrite left the colony in the summer of 1798, he would arrive in Irkutsk only on 30 November, 1798, and that he could not go back to Alaska until next spring. However, the emperor refused the Synod the invitation of the archimandrite to the capital for episcopal ordination for financial reasons. Therefore, that episcopal ordination was performed by the Irkutsk bishop alone because of the remoteness of the diocese (RGIA. F. 13. Op. 2. D. 52. L. 118-121 ; NLR OR. F. 1000. Opt. 3. D. 1178).\n\nIn response to a request from the Most Holy Synod about his activities, Archimandrite Joasaph compiled in 1798 his “Topographic, Climatic, Statistical and Moral Description of Kodiak Island”. This is the first description of America in the Russian language, which was made on the basis of the study of local nature, life and customs. It was printed in October, 1805. Archimandrite Joasaph's work gives the exact geographical coordinates of the island, a “climatic” description, a statistical summary and an “aesthetic” description of the life and customs of the locals. Archimandrite Joasaph also wrote about minerals, marine industries, the conditions for farming, the customs, religion and funeral rites of the islanders. The work of the archimandrite aroused the interest of the Emperor Alexander I, who recommended to the president of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, Baron A L Nikolai, that it be printed.\n\nThe new bishop was charged with the responsibility of caring for the construction of new Temples, and of involving local residents in the study of the Russian language and literacy.\n\nNotwithstanding the adverse conditions, Father Joasaph and his brotherhood of monks were very much enabled by the Lord to evangelise the indigenous peoples nearby, and they expanded their preaching and efforts across the Shelikov Strait to the Alaskan mainland. Yet, reaching out to the indigenous folk involved dangers. The newly-arrived Russian-speakers were very different from them, and communication was nearly impossible without an interpreter. Mis-perceptions could easily arise, and a peaceful approach could be perceived as a threat. It was in 1796 that the priest-monk Juvenaly became the first Orthodox martyr, and therefore saint, in North America. This event, in part, contributed to the decision of the Most Holy Synod in 1796 to create an auxiliary episcopal see in Alaska, and to choose and designate Archimandrite Joasaph to become the Bishop of Kodiak.\n\nBecause of the great distances involved, notification of his having been chosen by the Holy Synod to be a bishop reached Father Joasaph only in 1798. He was summoned to Irkutsk.\n\nSoon after his arrival in Irkutsk, the formal service of the election of Archimandrite Joasaph (Bolotov) to become a bishop took place there, on 3 April, 1799. All the usual and necessary other preparatory steps had taken place previously during meetings of the Most Holy Synod in Saint Petersburg.\n\nEpiscopal ordination, 1799\n\nOn 10 April, 1799, Archimandrite Joasaph (Bolotov) was ordained to the Holy Episcopate by Archbishop Benjamin (Bagryansky) of Ikrutsk in the Holy Epiphany Cathedral of Irkutsk.\n\nBecause of the remote and isolated location of this Siberian city, Archbishop Benjamin of Irkutsk had received exceptional instructions from the Most Holy Synod to perform the episcopal ordination alone. This is the only known case in the entire history of the Russian Orthodox Church of an episcopal ordination conducted by a single bishop. However, the canons do provide for such extraordinary situations : such an eventuality would be permitted when there are letters from other neighbouring bishops who support the ordination and agree to it. Such was certainly the case in this situation.\n\nEpiscopal service\n\nBishop Joasaph (Bolotov) was assigned to serve the Russian Mission in Kodiak, the Aleutian Islands, and Russian America (Alaska).\n\nWhile he remained in Irkutsk, Bishop Joasaph (Bolotov) received commendable reviews from the bishop and from the company management.\n\nIt is likely that Bishop Joasaph and his entourage departed from Irkutsk on the return journey on about 10 May, 1799. They arrived in Okhotsk during the summer. Then, they embarked on the ship \"Phoenix\" in September on their voyage to Kodiak. According to the records, the party consisted of 11 or 12 persons, which, besides the bishop, included : the Priestmonk Makariy (Alexandrov) ; the Hierodeacon Stefan (Hovorukhin) ; the Priest P Mityagin. A cousin of the Priest John Veniaminov, Dimitri Popov, was also with them. Along with members of the Shelikhov-Golikov Company and others, their total number was 88 persons.\n\nShipwreck, repose, 1799\n\nAccording to Mr. Baranov, the last time the ship was seen was on 28 October, 1799, near Unalaska. After that, it was never seen again.\n\nIn the spring of 1800, leather-covered books and some candles from the ship were handed in at the western end of Kodiak Island. It is presumed, therefore, that because of some storm along the southern coast of Alaska, the “Phoenix” sank near the Alaskan coast, and all those aboard perished. Other theories regarding the disappearance have to do with either a possible epidemic of cholera aboard the ship (which does not account for the complete disappearance), or an accident as a consequence of some mistake in navigation.\n\nThe most accepted theory is that the “Phoenix” sank in a storm near the Alaskan coast at an undetermined date.\n\nFuneral services without the bodies were served in Kodiak for all those who disappeared on that voyage.\n\n— Bishop of Kodiak, Alaska 1799. Preceded by : The see was created 1796. Succeeded by : The see was dissolved 1811.\n\nReflections\n\nAmongst the lost passengers travelling with Bishop Joasaph were the Hieromonk Makariy and the Hierodeacon Stephan, who had also been amongst the original Alaskan missionaries, and who was Father Juvenaly's brother. With them, an entourage of sextons and choristers also perished. This shipwreck was not only a serious setback for the Orthodox mission in Alaska, but it was also a significant loss for the Russian colonies, since the “Phoenix” was also bringing much needed supplies to Kodiak.\n\nBecause of the shock of this loss, and because of other circumstances, the Holy Synod took no action to replace Bishop Joasaph. Moreover, in 1811, the Holy Synod officially closed the Kodiak episcopal see, and another hierarch would not be appointed to Alaska for almost 3 decades.\n\nJoasaphovsky School, Kodiak, 1899\n\nIn 1899, in connection with the 100th anniversary of the consecration of Bishop Joasaph, Saint Tikhon (Belavin), who was then the bishop of the North American Diocese, proposed to give the name \"Joasaphovsky\" to the Church Parish School on Kodiak, in order to perpetuate his memory.\n\nSanctity\n\nIt is not simply we who determine who is especially holy. The Lord reveals to us who is holy. It is He who gives indications about a person to whom He has given the blessing to intercede for us and for the world. In fact, there are very many persons throughout the world who are locally recognised as being holy persons, but whose names have not been added to more official calendars. There are also persons who are recognised by the Faithful as being holy, but whose names have not in any official way been recognised. Fundamentally, it may be said that everyone who is admitted by the Lord into the Kingdom of Heaven by definition becomes holy, by being fully in the Presence of the Lord, \"before His Face\", as members of the Body of Christ, and in harmony with the Lord's direction : “Be holy, for I am holy” (3 Moses 11:44,45; 19:2 ; 1 Peter 1:16). We in this life are given to know those particular persons whose intercession has been blessed by the Lord to be effective for our health and salvation.\n\nFeast-day\n\nVladyka Joasaph (Bolotov) has not been officially glorified, although many regard him to be holy. Were he to be commemorated, it would be on or about 24 May, when the few remains of the ship were found in 1800.\n\nTropar Tone 5\n\nO Holy Hierarch, Father Joasaph,\n\ndespite difficulties and obstacles,\n\nyour missionary endeavours bore much fruit.\n\nYou served the Church with endless courage,\n\nand you were a bright beacon for the Faithful in Alaska.\n\nNow, you stand before the King of Heaven,\n\nand you chant the Thrice-holy Hymn with saints and angels.\n\nEver entreat Christ our God to give us His great mercy.\n\nKontak Tone 1\n\nO Holy Hierarch, Father Joasaph,\n\nbeseech the Lord to lift up our hearts\n\nabove all struggles and afflictions,\n\nwhen our human hopes are shattered.\n\nHelp us to learn to trust His loving Providence,\n\nfor His ways are not our ways :\n\nHe dispels darkness and brings good out of devastation.\n\nWritings\n\nBishop Joasaph’s insightful ethnological studies of Alaska were considered valuable even by secular scholars, and they were published in 1805.\n\n‘Short Explanations made according to the Note sent from the Holy Governing Synod of American Kodiak Island, Severovost by Archimandrite Joasaph of the American Ecclesiastical Mission’ in “St Petersburg FIIR RAS, F.115, D.117”, L. 1-8.\n\n‘Short Explanations made according to the Note sent from the Holy Governing Synod of American Kodiak Island, Severovost by Archimadrite Joasaph of the American Ecclesiastical Mission’ in “RNL OR.
