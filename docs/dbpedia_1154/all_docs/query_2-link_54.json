When two leading European philosophers were choosing the theme for their seminar on Capri in 1994 they independently decided on religion, believing it to be the foremost concern of our times.1 Although it is clearly the case that religion has become increasingly prominent in East European historiography over the past decade, our collection was not meant simply to reflect this current interest in religion among intellectuals.2 Religion seems to retain its currency in scholarship, but another component of this collection’s subtitle, popular, has been less fortunate. At a certain point historians believed that popular culture was a concept well worth using. They believed that it allowed them to uncover the attitudes, values, and beliefs of ordinary people, things from which their learned contemporaries felt estranged and which they could not articulate. The starting point for many studies of popular culture was Peter Burke’s work, which claimed to show how the split between popular and elite had occurred and why folk or popular culture had to be rediscovered in the nineteenth century.3 For many scholars popular culture was a concept that helped challenge definitions of culture as something shared, and pointed instead to inherent splits and conflicts as well as to symbolic resources for the resistance of the dominated and disempowered.4 This interest in popular culture among historians coincided with the paradigmatic shift from ‘hard social’ to ‘new cultural’ history, which is said to have occurred in the 1980s. Instead of deducing people’s experiences from social structures and conflicts, historians turned to the mechanisms of cultural production.5\n\n4\n\nAndriy Zayarnyuk and John-Paul Himka\n\nOutside of the discipline of history, popular culture became a prominent research topic in the context of a new academic project – namely, cultural studies – developing on the tradition of works associated with the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (established in 1964). Drawing on Gramsci’s concepts of hegemony revived and rearticulated by Stuart Hall, scholars in cultural studies came to see popular culture as resistance through appropriation based on the potential multiplicity of meanings available in any cultural product.6 Another theoretical impetus influencing the turn of cultural studies to the popular came from Michel de Certeau’s work.7 In both cases, in history (usually early modern) and in cultural studies (usually contemporary), the convergence of all these trends resulted in a wave of works on popular culture in general and popular religion in particular that appeared in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.8 But as often happens with paradigms, the high moment of the concept was also the time when assumptions behind its usage were seriously questioned. First of all, it appeared that the emphasis on resistance and creative reworking of meanings was hiding the other side of the process – namely, the exercise of domination, the sustentation of a certain political regime. At the end of the 1990s some authors were observing the decline not only of cultural elitism but also of the celebratory ‘cultural populism’ in much of cultural studies.9 Works that appeared at the end of the 1990s made little use of the term ‘popular religion.’ In the 1980s and first half of the 1990s popular religion, along with popular Catholicism, popular Methodism, or popular millenarianism, could often be seen in the titles of academic monographs; in the late 1990s and early 2000s the term ‘popular’ has been almost completely omitted from the titles of history monographs. While the rise of popular culture as a heuristic device for historians was accompanied by major discussions, its decline was not discussed at all, especially in history.10 This was part of the thinking that led to putting together this collection. Another reason was the situation with regard to East European (largely Russian but also Ukrainian) history. As had happened before with other discussions, East European history came a bit late to the discussion of popular culture and popular religion. Quite often, when popular religion came up, it was simply ascribed to the lower classes as something they must have had differently. As one of the classics of Russian social history put it: ‘Sociologists and ethnographers taught that religious beliefs and systems are products of societies and of status groups (or\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nsocial classes). If they are right, then we can assume a priori that official denominations never express reality in matters so complex. We are therefore allowed to hypothesize that as long as peasants live in conditions and an environment that set them apart from other social groups in society, they will certainly develop and stick to their own way of believing.’11 Peasants had a religion of ‘their own making.’ A turning point in the East European history of popular religion occurred in connection with the criticism of the concept of dvoeverie (i.e., the preservation of pre-Christian beliefs at the core of popular faith, something that made this popular religion different from that of the official church). The new trend is clearly visible in a recent collection on religion and culture in early modern Russia and Ukraine. It tried to show that the popular religion in question was not something altogether separate from the religion of the upper classes, and indeed it turned attention to the church itself – a topic underprivileged in both Soviet and Western social history.12 Christine D. Worobec was the first scholar to state the influence of the church on popular practices and to describe these practices as first of all Christian.13 Since then the study of East European religion has moved in several directions, with very little reflection on these directions. The decline of the great divide into popular and learned/official/elite revived old concerns with the specificity of Russian/Orthodox culture/civilization. Some works of this trend are discussed in the essays of the present collection.14 The emphasis on the specificities and the particularities of ‘Russian’ religious experience reflected the idea that culture is based on belonging and sharing. Although work on the religion of ‘ordinary people’ proliferated, it no longer relied on the concept of popular culture. Quite often it turned towards subjective experiences, which, especially in the context of modern times, could be analysed in the context of their liberation from the restraints of the traditional culture.15 Others continued to compromise and dissect images of popular beliefs constructed by educated society, showing how these images were interconnected with various intellectual and political projects and how they had little in common with the reality of popular practices.16 Yet some others were trying to investigate the religious enthusiasm of the masses, showing that religion was a value in itself, something that cannot be reduced to politics, social change, or cultural system.17 In this collection we have tried to show how the history of popular religion is written after the end of the paradigm: what are the directions\n\n6\n\nAndriy Zayarnyuk and John-Paul Himka\n\nin which this field is moving and what theoretical framework fits which purpose better. Believing that quite a few scholars of Eastern Europe have been exploring new territory, we decided to bring their work together for a serious discussion of the issues in question and engagement with their theoretical frameworks, models, and concepts. We felt that such an engagement was even more pressing because of how East European history usually lags behind in confronting its own assumptions, theories, and methods. Thus this collection representing recent departures made in the study of East European popular religion also had to become a much needed confrontation of the different approaches to and different uses of popular religion in this context. We used ‘popular religion’ as a signal to our authors about the kind of texts we were interested in. In our letter to individual authors we wrote: ‘There are a number of definitions of popular religion, so let us suggest where our interests lie. It is in these senses (adapted from Mircea Eliade’s Encyclopedia of Religion): the religion of rural and peasant society, folk religion, the religion of the laity in contrast to that of the clergy (where the clergy is the bearer of a learned tradition usually based on the prestige of literacy), the religion of a subclass or minority group in a culture, the religion of the masses as opposed to the religion of the sophisticated, discriminated, and learned within a society.’18 In fact, we were not interested in all the kinds of popular religion in the territory we had loosely delineated. We left Judaism, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, and even sects derived from Orthodoxy aside and instead concentrated our attention on what we would call Orthodoxy, if it were that simple. But we were also including the Uniates of Ukraine and Belarus within the parameters of our interest. Most of the contributions in this volume focus on popular Orthodoxy, but one concerns a phenomenon within popular Uniatism or Greek Catholicism (Andriy Zayarnyuk), another has a section explicitly devoted to Uniates within a study largely focusing on the Orthodox (Sophia Senyk), and yet another concerns iconography that was both Orthodox and Uniate (John-Paul Himka). Perhaps the following description of the sphere of our interest, though imperfect, will be helpful: the traditional or majority religion in the territories of the Eastern Slavs. Thus we avoided all the confessions that were explicitly connected with the minority groups defined mainly though their confessions or confessions whom contemporaries identified as exclusively practised by unlearned and ‘simple’ people. In the same letter in which we apprised our contributors about what\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nwe meant by ‘popular religion,’ we also said: ‘We are especially interested in contributions that would problematize the very categories “popular,” “religion,” and “popular religion.”’19 In fact, we wondered if the term ‘popular’ still made any sense to them (and we knew that it did not for some), and if it did, which connotations did they attach to it. Several of our authors responded to our suggestion and engaged this problematization frontally. Roman Holyk, writing about early modern popular religion in Ukraine, insists on the need to see the religious mentality as a whole. We should think about early modern spirituality ‘as a continuum that unites all the highest achievements of the mysticaltheological experience of the intellectual elites as well as the most primitive popular religious experiences of the lower classes and the marginalized. Often the low religion is sharply distinguished from the high religion as something naive from the serious or simply complicated. Yet it is important to remember that today’s standards of naivety or simplicity do not entirely correspond to those of that time.’20 And Paul Bushkovitch, focusing on the reign of Peter I, also questions the relevance of the term to the Russian situation: ‘If the term is to be meaningful, popular religion should imply a variety of religious experience that is characteristic of non-elite layers of society and possesses a certain autonomy from elite culture ... The problem is that it is difficult to find examples of practices that are restricted to lay, non-elite layers of society. Even before Peter, it is by no means clear that the practices historians call popular were restricted to laymen or the lower orders of society.’21 The same conclusion also suggests itself from a reading of Sophia Senyk’s article. The entire article by Vera Shevzov is situated on the fuzzy border between ‘official’ and ‘popular’ religion. John-Paul Himka suggests that what looks like folk iconography may actually be rooted in religious high culture, and Eve Levin makes a similar point about folk religious customs. Part of the reluctance of scholars to apply the category of ‘popular religion’ to the Eastern Christian experience derives from the much smaller role in Orthodoxy of the elite intellectual developments so characteristic of Western Christendom (scholasticism, theology at medieval universities). On the other hand, we depart from the notions of culture as a system shared by those participating in it, from notions of culture as something singular that can be defined by its characteristic traits, from notions of culture as something that can explain this or that cultural phenomenon; yet we can find ‘popular religion’ to be a term still worth using. Just as\n\n8\n\nAndriy Zayarnyuk and John-Paul Himka\n\nin the case with other cultural forms, the term ‘popular religion’ does not necessarily imply that there is a unified whole (popular religion), juxtaposing itself against another such whole (official religion). The investigation of cultural forms as practised in contemporary cultural studies can still use the term ‘popular’ meaningfully and usefully without constructing some kind of dichotomy between ‘popular’ and ‘elite’ or ‘low-brow’ and ‘high-brow.’ ‘Popular’ forms can be conceptualized as consumption versus production, as tactics versus strategy, as what de Certeau would call enunciation versus articulation. In this context, popular does not become anti-something so that the only way to investigate it is in relationships with practices it tries to oppose. With such connotations as outlined here ‘popular’ has been used successfully in the context of art history – especially in the discussion of the breakup of nineteenth-century elite culture and the rise of modernism. ‘Popular’ also continues to maintain its connections with the lower classes and history from ‘below.’ In this context the emphasis is placed on the idea of usage and appropriation. Certain cultural forms by becoming popular acquire new meanings and are used by the disempowered and dominated. In this case there is no clear-cut break between popular and elite, yet the concept of ‘popular’ is still worth using for discovering how these new meanings are produced, how the cultural forms are used, and how they shape the experiences of those using them. In this instance, political systems and mechanisms of social domination and subordination turn into necessary parts of the discussion. That is why for some contributors the concept seemed to work better than for others. Natalie Kononenko describes a situation in which the official, elite church was dismantled, or at least severely restricted, by the Soviet state authorities; in the absence of that other level, a folk Christianity with its own idioms flourished. In the contribution by Andriy Zayarnyuk, texts associated with traditional religion as practised by the peasants are used to resist an elite modernity, including religious modernity, and this modern elite condemns the texts as superstition. Here are instances in which the contestation suggested by the term ‘popular religion’ are borne out. But those hesitant to make a clear distinction between popular and high or official and those still finding ‘popular’ to be a useful analytic category are all moving away from spatial images in thinking about popular culture. Instead of pinning ‘popular’ down to a particular set of beliefs or ideas, they search for practices impossible to grasp otherwise than in relationship with other practices, configurations of social\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nrelationships, political institutions, and ideologies. From being a particular ‘culture,’ popular practices in the articles of this collection turn into the site of intersection with other practices, in some cases connoting inclusion and participation and in others, resistance. In many of these texts ‘problematizing’ religion and popular forced the authors to resist any attempt to define these categories, and quite often ‘thick description’ of practices appeared as the best way to approach certain religious and popular phenomena. As to the territory covered by the book, it is not quite Russia and Ukraine. Many of the articles concern a period long before the term ‘Ukraine’ entered usage in its modern meaning, and the same really applies, if not so obviously, to the term ‘Russia.’ Moreover, one of the studies contains a section specifically devoted to Belarusian material (Sophia Senyk). Several studies concern ‘Russia’ in the wide sense of the Russian Empire, inclusive therefore of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus (Christine Worobec, Paul Bushkovitch, Vera Shevzov). Sophia Senyk describes her space of investigation as ‘Rus’,’ which she defines as ‘the entire territory inhabited by Eastern Slavs.’ There is a loose territorial convergence in the selected studies, but all the authors bring to their work their own understanding of how that territory is constituted. For Vera Shevzov, for example, Pochaev, located in Ukraine today and located in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth at the time its miracleworking icon was acquired by the monastery, is a ‘local community’ of the ‘Russian nation.’ Other authors in this volume, including ourselves, would not think this way about what they call Pochaiv or Poaiv. We have decided not to impose uniformity of place names and transliteration practices in the authors’ individual texts. For example, we have left it up to individual authors to use Kyiv or Kiev. We have also decided not to impose uniformity of terminology on the authors. Thus what appears as the Tuesday of Fomina week in the article by Christine Worobec is the Tuesday after Doubting Thomas Sunday in the article by Natalie Kononenko. For different reasons, neither specialists nor general readers require standardization to understand these articles. We believe therefore that the richness of these texts will be better served by allowing a diversity of practice. All translations, unless otherwise indicated, are by the authors. The one exception is in the essay by Roman Holyk; this entire essay was translated by John-Paul Himka, who also translated quotations from other works, except where otherwise indicated. The time periods covered by the different essays range in the main\n\n10\n\nAndriy Zayarnyuk and John-Paul Himka\n\nfrom the fifteenth century to the early twenty-first, but several of them refer also to practices and texts of earlier centuries. The volume is organized in the following way. It opens with a reprint of an article by Christine Worobec, which itself opened the set of problems with which this collection is concerned. Here the original article is supplemented by a postscript citing the latest relevant work. Christine Worobec’s article explored peasant practices related to death in late imperial Russia. It is followed by an article by Natalie Kononenko on the same theme, except set in post-Soviet Ukraine. This is the sole article in the collection by a nonhistorian, and it makes for an interesting contrast with the others. The theme of death gives way to five articles that revolve around the theme of mentalities. It is in this section that many of the issues broached in this introduction find their richest exposition. The studies by Roman Holyk, Valerie A. Kivelson, and Eve Levin all primarily concern the medieval/early modern period, and they appear in an order that moves from the most general and generalizing study to the most concrete. The essay by Paul Bushkovitch focuses on the reign of Peter I (1682–1725), a touchstone period for the idea of a division between elite and popular culture and religion in Russia. Andriy Zayarnyuk’s contribution is centred on the nineteenth century. The last three contributions concern icons, which constitute one of the most distinctive features of Orthodox/Uniate religious culture, with strong popular connections. These are organized in roughly chronological order. Sophia Senyk’s study of icon adornments moves from medieval times to the nineteenth century. John-Paul Himka’s article deals with the fifteenth through eighteenth centuries, and Vera Shevzov’s with the late nineteenth and early twentieth.\n\nNOTES 1 Gianni Vattimo, ‘Circumstances,’ in Religion, ed.

The average life expectancy was much lower than it is today in developed countries, and sudden death, brought on by epidemics or famine, was a regular phenomenon. Individuals had to deal with the loss of not only the elderly, but also wives, husbands, sisters, brothers, and other adults in the prime of life – as well as children, many of whom died before the age of ten.1 Religious beliefs and the enactment of elaborate death rituals that provided linkages between the living and the dead helped the bereaved cope with the continual loss of relatives, helpmates, and actual or potential labourers for the family economy. Belief and ritual also provided the hope and strength to continue with life’s struggles: ‘It is religion, with its attendant beliefs and practices, which legitimates death and enables the individual “to go on living in society after the death of significant others and to anticipate his own death with, at the very least, terror sufficiently mitigated so as not to paralyze the continued performance of the routines of everyday life.”’2 As conditions for life improved and life expectancy grew significantly, and as death became more remote from the experience of the living – today, people generally die in hospitals rather than at home, and morticians instead of relatives prepare the body for burial – many of the traditional death rituals disappeared, leaving only a shell of beliefs to help (often inadequately) the living cope with the loss of a loved one. Death ritual is normally a subject of inquiry for anthropologists. Only recently have historians of European societies turned their attention to this intriguing subject, asking many of the questions that anthropologists have devised for their field studies and posing new ones that\n\n14\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nprovide a historical framework for the study of societies.3 Death rituals reveal a great deal about past societies, including their mores and world views, the power relationships between the elderly and the young as well as between men and women, the individual’s relationship to the community, and the interchange and tensions between clerical and popular or unlearned religion. The examination of death ritual among Russian and Ukrainian peasants in imperial Russia in the last decades of the nineteenth century attempts to elucidate these variables. These two peasant societies, despite variations among regions and even villages, shared a subsistence economy and common cultural patterns, particularly in the belief structure of the Orthodox religion. The sources documenting death ritual among postemancipation Russian and Ukrainian peasants are largely from nineteenth-century ethnographers intent on preserving the lore of the traditional village, which they worried would disappear once urbanization and a cash economy captured the imagination of the peasantry. The sources are problematic in that they describe only practices that occurred outside the institutional church. They tend to be silent on Orthodox ritual and only mention in passing the priest’s role in the funeral and subsequent commemorative services. This lack of interest in the official ritual may be explained in part by the familiarity of the authors and their educated readers with Orthodox practices, which they felt did not need further comment, and in part by the authors’ disdain for the Orthodox Church – a sentiment shared by a significant segment of educated Russian society. They considered the church unresponsive to the needs of society at large. For them, it had become a bulwark of the autocracy, beginning in the early eighteenth century with Peter the Great’s abolition of the Moscow patriarchate and relegation of the church to the status of a bureaucratic wing of the government. The ethnographers’ search for pagan remnants in peasant religious beliefs testified to the institutional church’s ineffectiveness. Indeed, these observers in the field sometimes took an ahistorical approach, assuming that religious practices and their meanings were immutable and that nineteenthcentury peasant beliefs were indicative of the medieval world view.4 Russian Orthodox ecclesiastics and clergy added to the perception of the peasant as heathen. In his memoir, four years before the emancipation, the parish priest I.S. Belliustin bemoaned the fact that out of one hundred male peasants, a maximum of ten can read the creed and two or three short prayers (naturally, without the slightest idea or\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n15\n\ncomprehension of what they have read). Out of one thousand men, at most two or three know the Ten Commandments; so far as the women are concerned, nothing even needs to be said here. And this is Orthodox Rus’! What a shame and disgrace! And our pharisees dare to shout for everyone to hear that only in Russia has the faith been preserved undefiled, in Rus’, where two-thirds of the people have not the slightest conception of the faith!5\n\nBelliustin went on to characterize Russian peasants as not having ‘the remotest conception of anything spiritual.’6 He sought to awaken his ecclesiastical superiors to the problems plaguing the institutional church, particularly the unsatisfactory education and untenable economic position of parish priests, who were dependent on the good graces of their parishioners. In his opinion, it was no wonder that with ill-prepared, alcoholic priests and nonordained servitors, the church failed miserably in its mission to reach the masses. While Belliustin was correct in pointing out the church’s failure to move beyond the liturgical framework and teach peasants the catechism, he took his denial of the faith of illiterate peasants too far. Faith cannot be reduced to the reading of the Creed and a few prayers and the recitation of the Ten Commandments. The judgment of the Orthodox Church, with its increasingly rationalist views from the mid-eighteenth century onward, denied popular beliefs any validity, wishing to assert a monopoly over mediation with supernatural forces. Scholars of the Orthodox Church and religious practices of the Russian and Ukrainian masses have tended to agree with nineteenthcentury observers of the peasantry, stressing the dual nature of Orthodoxy as a syncretic amalgam of Christian and pagan beliefs. They continue to present nineteenth-century peasant beliefs as having been strongly influenced by the pagan past and at times insist that these beliefs mirrored the thought pattern of the masses throughout the centuries. According to the preeminent scholar of Russian Orthodoxy, G.P. Fedotov, ‘the Russian peasant has been living in the Middle Ages through the nineteenth century.’7 One literary scholar more recently expressed astonishment ‘at the degree to which the Russian peasant succeeded in preserving his ancient, pre-Christian customs and worldview.’8 It is time for historians of the Russian Empire to follow the lead of social historians of Western Europe by critically approaching ethnographic and religious sources and examining the belief systems of the masses on their merits, heavily influenced as they were by the doctrines\n\n16\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nof the official church.9 This means going beyond the binary model of paganism and Orthodoxy, or dvoeverie, and rejecting the assumption that nineteenth-century beliefs and rituals among Russian and Ukrainian peasants mirrored those of the ancient past until those beliefs and rituals can be systematically compared with medieval texts. That is not to deny the flexibility of Christianity in both Western and Eastern Europe to incorporate pagan elements during the conversion process, but to shift the focus away from the early history of the Orthodox Church to the living practices of the faithful in the nineteenth century, when distinguishing between Christian and pagan elements was no longer relevant. Otherwise, the label ‘Christian’ becomes meaningless, referring only to a tiny spiritual and educated elite that knew how to interpret evangelical texts and church dogma correctly.10 Russian and Ukrainian peasants believed themselves to be practitioners of Orthodoxy, drawing upon Christian symbols and magical rites to guard against the vagaries of everyday life. Such an approach does not ignore the Orthodox Church’s censure of some peasant practices, but pinpoints the reality that in all cultures ‘religion as practised’ does not always meet the ideal of prescribed religion.11 It also underscores the fact that clerical beliefs and what the church termed superstitious beliefs stemmed from the same world view.12 Certainly, to the nineteenth- and twentieth-century scientific mind, the popular belief system was riddled with superstition revolving around apparitions, fairies, magical healing, and the fantastic. But the very word ‘superstition’ is a value judgment of a largely secular world. Such condescension ignores the fact that peasants took these beliefs seriously, confident that they were complementary to the magical rituals of the Orthodox Church. Christianity, after all, stressed such things as the immortality of the soul, linkages between the living and dead through prayer and memorial services, the purification of holy water, healing through prayer, and the power of the cross, all of which the peasants absorbed and elaborated upon in making their world intelligible and manageable. According to anthropologist Clifford Geertz, ‘For those able to embrace them, and for so long as they are able to embrace them, religious symbols provide a cosmic guarantee not only for their ability to comprehend the world, but also, comprehending it, to give a precision to their feeling, a definition to their emotions which enables them, morosely or joyfully, grimly or cavalierly, to endure it.’13 This study looks at the ways in which late-nineteenth-century Russian and Ukrainian peasants, largely in conformity with Orthodox practice, coped\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n17\n\nwith the world around them and healed the rift created by the loss of individuals from the community and family. In examining the Ukrainian peasants’ understanding of life after death in Khar’kov province, an ethnographer of that time rejected the opinions of many of his contemporaries, concluding that ‘it is ... necessary to remember that neither dual faith nor superstition and prognostications constitute the basic foundation of the people’s philosophy; rather, a deep, heartfelt religious feeling’ undergirds that philosophy.14 Death ritual and popular beliefs about death during the period from 1870 to 1917 serve as a microcosm of the Russian and Ukrainian peasant universe, in which there existed a strong linkage between the world of the living and the world of the dead – a linkage predicated on the Christian concept of the soul’s immortality. The deceased were not divorced from the living but continued to play an active role in society, communicating with the living in a variety of ways. At times they were benevolent and at other times dangerous to the well-being of the community. To facilitate their benevolence, family and community observed numerous customs to ease the passage of the dead from this world to the next. The care with which they prepared the deceased for the afterlife also reinforced the community’s unity and the respect accorded the elderly. The active participation of community members in the services and rituals that honoured and bade farewell to the dead served both to placate the dead and to ensure that similar care would be taken when they died.15 The dead, in turn, were expected to intercede with God on behalf of the living. The world of nineteenth-century Russian and Ukrainian peasants was inhabited by a host of spirits and demons who were believed responsible for such recurring calamities as drought, freak storms, illness, and even death. The peasants ultimately feared the dead and interpreted some of these disasters as their vengeful acts. Death was understood as the will of God, and the extent to which the deceased had sinned during their lifetimes determined whether they experienced a peaceful or torturous afterlife. Peasants viewed an unexpected death as divine punishment of sins.16 Deaths inflicted by the human hand, whether suicide or murder, were unnatural and against God’s will. Denied a Christian burial, the souls of the victims were destined to wander the earth and avenge their sufferings by inflicting problems on the living. Russian and Ukrainian peasants did not take death lightly. The elderly and the seriously ill, who knew that death was imminent, had to\n\n18\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nmake preparations to ease their transition from this world to the next. This meant cleansing the conscience and taking steps to ensure that the living carried out their Christian obligation to remember the dead through prayer. In the Orthodox funeral service, the dead ask the living to say prayers for them: ‘Therefore I beg you all, and implore you, to offer prayers unceasingly for me to Christ our God, that I be not assigned for my sins to the place of torment; but that He assign me to the place where this is Light of Life.’17 Signs portending the imminence of death aided individuals in their preparation for it. The fourteenth-century icon of Saints Boris and Gleb in Kolomna includes an image of Boris dreaming about his impending death, depicted here as a black dog.18 Death imagery in dreams was also strong among peasants. For example, the inhabitants of the Ukrainian village of Shebekino, Kursk province, put a good deal of stock in dreams and the actions of birds as messengers of death. An individual who dreamt about a deceased father or grandfather building a house (in this case signifying a grave) and inviting the dreamer to live with him was destined to die shortly. If in a dream a person lost a tooth without experiencing pain, the person’s spouse, brother, or sister would soon die. If, on the other hand, losing that tooth involved a great deal of pain and the appearance of blood, death would claim a child, mother, or father. Death might also be heralded by a screeching owl, a bird beating at a window at midnight, or a bird trapped in a hut.19 In the Russian province of Riazan’, death might appear as a skeleton or old woman when the individual looked in a mirror at night; as white flowers in a dream; or as a bird darting in and out a window. Death was also likely when a person’s hair and nails grew quickly.20 Unusual occurrences in dreams and reality thus confirmed the foreboding of death that elderly or gravely ill individuals had.21 Such premonitions of death were characteristic of premodern societies in which ‘there was no clear boundary between the natural and the supernatural.’22 With death looming, peasants made arrangements concerning the state of their soul. Confessing sins to a priest and taking the Sacrament eased their conscience.23 In isolated Russian villages of Vladimir province, the elderly sometimes also asked the ground for forgiveness, invoking the biblical reference to the body’s being made out of earth. In the village of Golovina, Grigorev canton, an old man had his family carry him out to the fields so that he could get down on his knees and bow to the ground in all four directions. With each genuflection he crossed himself and said, ‘Damp Mother Earth, forgive me and accept\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n19\n\nme!’24 In Poshekhon’e district, Iaroslavl’ province, Russian peasants believed that a few days prior to death the body emitted a smell of earth and developed black spots, suggesting that ‘the earth is coming out.’25 Dying peasants also generally made arrangements concerning the devolution of their property to relatives in mainly oral, but sometimes written, testaments. Fortunately, a few of the written testaments have survived. They reveal the peasants’ concerns about death. One childless widow of Podcherkov canton, Dmitrov district, Moscow province, left an extraordinary testament dated 22 August 1871. She expressed gratitude to a large circle of kin, settling property on a brother, two nieces, a sister-in-law, two nephews, and an adopted son. She also made the following stipulations: I am asking my executors, named at the end of this testament, upon my death, to sell my home and yard with one cow, located in the village of Ochevo, Podcherkov canton. The net capital is to be placed in one of the credit institutions in the name of the holy Church servants of the parish Chernogriazh for the eternal memory of my and my husband’s souls ... I am bequeathing two pieces of linen to the poor and miserable ... I am leaving ten measures of rye to the Nikolopestush monastery for the remembrance of my and my husband’s souls.26\n\nThe importance of the living praying for the souls of the dead is evident from the testament. Having no children of her own and with relatives inhabiting other villages, the widow left money to servants of the church and a monastery to ensure that someone would pray for her and her husband’s souls. By dispensing Christian charity and giving alms to the poor, she helped pave her way to a peaceful death.27 In another testament of 17 March 1869, Dmitrii Andreev Skachkov, of the village of Petrov in Usman’ district, Tambov province (Russia), referred to his wife’s responsibility for caring for his soul: ‘If there remains money after my death it is to go to my wife Mariia Ivanova on condition that she bury me and have memorial services said for me in the Christian manner.’28 Once again the testator stressed the importance of memorial services. In a spiritual testament from a Ukrainian province, a parent warned his children that unless they lived in harmony, they would destroy his eternal peace and sully his memory. If, on the other hand, they lived according to God’s commandment, ‘I will pray from the grave to Our Lord on High for your happiness.’29 These testaments attest to a belief in a strong linkage between the\n\n20\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nliving and the dead. The living were obliged to bury their deceased relatives in a Christian fashion. This involved arranging for a chernichka (a spinster who devoted her life to the work of Christ without, however, taking the vows of a nun) or literate male peasant to read the psalter over the deceased, and arrange for a funeral mass before the interment.30 Family and community members also had to bid farewell to the deceased, absolving him or her of past sins. According to Ukrainian peasants in Starokonstantinov district, Volynia province, ‘To be afraid of, to shun the dead is a sin; we will all die ... [we] will not get to heaven alive. Who knows ... what kind of death God sends each one of us.’31 In other words, mortals were not to judge and torment the dead. God would make the final judgment.32 After the funeral, family members were expected to arrange for the continued reading of the psalter, sometimes until the fortieth day, as well as for several memorial services. In both the Russian and Ukrainian provinces, memorial services and repasts involving the entire community were held to honour the dead on the third, ninth (sometimes twentieth), and fortieth days after death.33 They commemorated the resurrection of Christ on the third day, his reappearance to his disciples on the ninth day, and his wandering in the wilderness for forty days. Absorbing the church’s practices, Russian and Ukrainian peasants believed that the soul wandered the earth for forty days. During that time, according to Russian peasants of Vladimir province, angels of the Lord took the soul to places where the deceased person had committed sins during his or her lifetime. On the third, ninth, twentieth, and fortieth days, the soul returned home, where it could drink from the glass of water and eat the bread left out for it. In the village of Mostki, Khar’kov province, Ukrainian peasants ascribed purificatory powers to the water left on the windowsill closest to the icon corner, believing that the deceased’s soul cleansed itself of its sins by bathing in the water. On the fortieth day, the priest officiating at the memorial service released the soul from this earth and sent it on its way to ‘the dark place to await Christ’s judgment.’34 Russian and Ukrainian peasants’ belief in the continued materialism of the human body after death was also expressed by the practice of burying the deceased with food as well as, in some cases, household tools and other items. While the custom began to die out by the end of the nineteenth century, it did not contradict church teachings or practices.35 According to the Gospel of St Luke, Jesus ate grilled fish upon his resurrection.36 On the fortieth day, a bereaved family may even\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n21\n\ntoday bring food – bread and fruit – into the church and place it on the side altar used for the postliturgy memorial service.37 Peasants understood the importance of prayers for the welfare of the deceased, in keeping with the teachings of the Orthodox Church. Marva Romanova of the village of Mar’ino, Riazan’ province, explained to an observer that the souls of deceased adults, both the righteous and sinners, awaited the Last Judgment in a dark, empty place. The purpose of memorial services after the fortieth day was to provide the souls with light so that they could determine whether they would live out their eternal life in heaven or hell. Relatives and close friends on earth could, however, save a soul destined for hell through their prayers, a concept that reflected Orthodox belief.38 In the words of the Orthodox scholar Sergei Bulgakov, prayers ‘can ameliorate the state of the soul of sinners, and liberate them from the place of distress, and snatch them from hell. This action of prayer, of course, supposes not only intercession before the Creator, but a direct action on the soul, an awakening of the powers of the soul, capable of making it worthy of pardon.’39 The church’s belief in the efficacy of prayer was also demonstrated in a practice during the funeral: the officiating priest placed in the hands of the deceased a letter with a prayer asking God for forgiveness for past sins.40 According to the peasant woman Romanova, souls could not pray for themselves, but prayed for the living when the latter held commemorative services for them: ‘We pray for them, and they for us – they can’t be without us, we can’t be without them.’ Anna Domozhilova of the village of Muraevo, Dankov district, Riazan’ province, advised that memorial services for the dead should be held four times a year – on the Saturday before maslenitsa (Shrovetide), the Tuesday of Fomina week, the Saturday of Troitsa (Trinity), and 26 October, St Dimitrii Day, all important days in the Orthodox calendar.41 The Orthodox Church set aside the first two dates as well as the Saturday before Troitsa and the Saturday of the first week of Lent for remembering the dead. Of these, the Tuesday of Fomina week was the most important because the Orthodox believe that during Easter week the souls of the dead are relieved of suffering, a belief to which the peasants subscribed.42 In addition to saying prayers for the dead, the living eased the deceased’s journey to the other world and removed the threat of death from their own lives through a series of rituals. Russian and Ukrainian peasants believed that bodies continued to act after death.43 They ascribed to the deceased’s body the power to take lives in the transitional period between life on earth and life in the next world. Anthropologists\n\n22\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nclassify this time as one of liminality, when ‘the participants in rites of passage are neither in one state nor the other; they are “betwixt and between” ... The liminal period epitomizes that which is ambiguous, paradoxical, and anomalous. As a result, things associated with it are often considered unclean, polluting, and dangerous.’44 Thus, among Russian and Ukrainian peasants only the elderly (usually women), who were close to death themselves, were permitted to wash the dead.45 Precautions against death’s claiming someone else in the household were taken with the items – comb, soapy water, and earthenware containers for the water – used to prepare the body. They had to be disposed of in a place where people did not walk, preferably a river.46 To prevent another death in the family, the preparers of the body also closed the deceased’s eyes and mouth, placing coins on the eyes and sometimes tying the head with a cloth to keep the mouth shut.47 On the day of the funeral, a number of rituals had to be observed to ensure that the soul left the place of death and did not reanimate the body or remain in the hut to plague the living. Pallbearers carried the body out of the house feet first, in some places out of the window rather than the door. Once the funeral procession was out of the yard, a family member closed the gates and tied them with a belt. The hut was swept clean of any traces of death and holy water sprinkled along the path of the procession to neutralize the power of the dead.48 Through ritualized mourning, nineteenth-century Russian and Ukrainian peasants honoured and placated the dead. Grieving did not, however, allow uncontrolled passions. The peasants of Vladimir province considered it a great sin to grieve uncontrollably for the dead. God had willed the death of a loved one; it was not for mortals to question his will. Indeed, the Orthodox Church, stressing the glorious resurrection of Christ and eternal life, encouraged its followers to view death as a new birth.49 Ukrainian peasants accordingly greeted death with the saying ‘Praise be to God that he died’ (Slava Bohu, shcho vmer).50 An ethnographer, clearly offended by the joy that peasants expressed through song and dance at a grave site after a memorial service, was reminded by an elderly woman, ‘What do you mean? We had a memorial service, remembered the deceased; now it is time to cheer them up or they will be offended if we leave sad.’51 For a mother to mourn the death of baptized children under the age of seven was particularly egregious. Peasants believed that these sinless children were destined to go straight to heaven and become angels. If a mother cried for such a child, her tears would drown or burn the child.52 Instead, emotions\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n23\n\nwere to be released through laments, sung in a recitative style by the deceased’s close female relatives. In some Russian villages, relatives hired professional mourners. Through laments, wailers communicated between the worlds of the living and the dead in a public setting, before and after the churchofficiated funeral. They addressed deceased persons as if they were alive, asking them for forgiveness, praising them with tender words, and identifying them with diminutives. The mourners also described the sufferings of bereaved relatives. A mother from Kamenets district in the Ukrainian province of Podol’ia addressed her deceased daughter directly and asked, ‘My daughter, my dissatisfied [daughter]! Did you fear that [by living] you would deprive me of years?! Were you afraid that I would lose days?! Did you worry about interfering in my work?! Where are you going, my child? I rejoiced in you and looked after you. What will happen to you now? Why aren’t you laughing ...? Why aren’t you stretching out your small arms?’53 Clearly, the mother was trying to absolve herself of guilt over the death of her daughter, pointing out to her daughter and her neighbours that she had loved and cared for her. There is also an insinuation here that children were a burden on women, who had strenuous tasks to fulfil in the home and fields in addition to looking after children. In a similar lament from the Russian province of Kaluga, the guilt of a neglectful mother is far more pronounced; the mother actually blamed herself for her children’s death, agreeing with them that she had not fed them properly.54 A daughter from Skvirsk district in the Ukrainian province of Kiev bemoaned the death of her father, noting that the entire family had depended upon his labour and guidance: ‘Our father, dearest, why did you abandon us little ones? Who will look after us, who will plow for us, who will grind [the grain] for us, who will mow for us, who will give us away in marriage, and who will guide us along the path?’55 Similarly, in Tula province (Russia), a father was described in laments as the provider of the family and head of the household. Without him, those left were destined to walk around naked, cold, and hungry. In Vladimir province, a young widow bemoaned the fact that her husband’s death left her an orphan, underscoring the unenviable position of a widow in the community.56 While laments placated the dead and helped overcome guilt, their descriptions of the burdens carried by the living were a form of protest that women utilized to express their ‘social isolation and ambiguous status’ in a patriarchal society.57 They pinpointed the stark reality of a subsistence economy and the precarious balance between survival and\n\n24\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\ndestitution. The loss of a labourer, particularly an adult male, could result in economic disaster for the remaining family members. Widows without adult male children to support them had to depend on the benevolence of in-laws and the commune. When that aid was insufficient or not forthcoming, they were forced out of the village to seek a living as wage labourers. The fact that only women served as wailers among Russian and Ukrainian peasants attests to the greater economic and social hardships that women suffered as a result of the loss of ablebodied family members.58 Complex laments, however, were on the wane in many parts of rural Russia by the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They had disappeared from Dmitrovsk district, Orel province, and were fading from the popular memory in Ustiuzhna district, Novgorod province, by 1910.59 In 1920 the ethnographer V. Smirnov noted that there were still some professional mourners in Varnavin and Chukhloma districts of Kostroma province, but in general they were rare in the Kostroma region. Wailers remembered only a few phrases of the stylized laments and tended to substitute hysterical sobs for songs. The disappearance of complex laments may be explained in part by the clergy’s sustained attacks on the wailers.60 Priests clearly viewed these women as a threat to their power. Simplified urban funeral rites may also have had an effect on rural practices, especially in the industrial belt of central Russia.61 That women expressed public grief over death despite modern influences penetrating the countryside demonstrated their continuing vulnerability in a patriarchal society. Through their mourning for the dead, women also underlined the pivotal role they played in death ritual as a whole. As givers of life, they had the added responsibility of conducting the dead along the path to the other world. Indeed, smert’, the word for death in Russian and Ukrainian, is feminine. In the popular mind, death could take the form of a human skeleton, a young woman, a beautiful maiden, a cripple, or an old woman carrying a scythe and sometimes a torch. The woman with a scythe symbolized an inversion of traditional agricultural practices, in which men wielded scythes and women sickles.62 The identification of death as a woman represented the real world turned upside down. While on earth the patriarchy controlled and subordinated women, in the world beyond women were in control and took their revenge on the patriarchy by snuffing out life. As anthropologist Gail Kligman put it, ‘Death does what she wants, to whom and when she pleases.’63 Given the feminization of death, it was natural that women\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n25\n\nwere the intercessors between the dead and the living. The lament was the medium through which they communicated with the dead. While they bemoaned the fact that the dead refused to awaken from their deep sleep, they asked them for other signs that they were well, beseeching them to send a bird from heaven down to earth with a message for them.64 Ukrainian peasants believed that if women mourners spent the night at the grave site after memorial services, they could communicate directly with the dead, who would visit them in their sleep and thank them for their prayers.65 In spite of the various precautions and rituals to placate the dead and ease their journey to the other world, the dead sometimes remained in the world of the living, haunting them and causing calamities to befall them – a belief the Orthodox Church censured as superstitious. Ukrainian and Russian peasants believed in the existence of the walking dead, those souls who had died unnaturally and were therefore usually denied or deprived of a Christian burial as a sign of God’s wrath. Until laid to rest, they would be tormented and seek revenge on the living. The so-called unclean dead were either victims of suicide or murder, or witches and sorcerers who during their lifetime communicated with demons and dabbled in black magic. Alcoholics were also prime candidates for revenants or ghosts, because of a belief that alcoholism was the work of the devil.66 The rusalki, or water nymphs, were common to the pantheon of spirits inhabiting the worlds of Russian and Ukrainian peasants. They were believed to be the souls of unbaptized babies and young unmarried women – many of them spurned by their lovers – who ended their lives tragically by drowning.67 Ukrainians had a special word for the walking dead – upiry, who were akin to bloodsucking vampires.68 Russian and Ukrainian peasants believed that unclean bodies did not decompose and that ultimately the earth refused to accept them.69 It was natural for the peasants to believe that the dissatisfied dead roamed the world at night. The dead, both good and evil, were thought to communicate with the living in their sleep, when they were most vulnerable.70 Indeed, death itself often warned people of their impending death through dreams.71 The countryside’s physical environment also played havoc with peasant imaginations. ‘Forests, misty bogs and nights unilluminated by electricity were conducive to strange visions ... Furthermore, the greater prevalence of illness and delirium meant that hallucinations were probably more common in the last century than now, and they furnished people with a range of disconcerting images\n\n26\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nwhich seemed to corroborate the authenticity of traditional beliefs.’72 While the belief in revenants was anathema to the Orthodox Church, peasants must nonetheless have been influenced by the important Christian concept of the resurrection of the dead. When they heard the reference in the Gospels to demoniacs emerging from a tomb, their suspicions about the power of the dead were confirmed.73 At the same time, not every unusual manifestation was a hallucination or apparition. As Paul Barber demonstrated in his recent study of vampires in European societies, unembalmed corpses undergo a great deal of physical change. Microorganisms in the intestines produce gases that cause a corpse to bloat to twice its original size. ‘Eventually the abdominal cavity bursts from the pressure, like an overinflated balloon, unless the pressure is relieved.’ Corpses also change colour and continue to bleed. Russian and Ukrainian peasants, like their European counterparts, were not imagining the sounds they heard from the graves. Nor were they imagining the bodies they saw uncovered by animals digging at shallow graves or the corpses that resurfaced after being buried in a swamp or drowned in water. And when they saw these bodies or heard movement in the earth, they assumed that the corpses were active, doing some harm to the living.74 The harm that the unclean dead visited on the living sometimes came in the form of sudden, unexplained deaths. A Ukrainian tale from Khar’kov province relates how a rusalka tickled a small boy to death because his father had been digging trenches on the Thursday of Troitsa week, the day set aside for the festival of the rusalki. The water nymph was also taking revenge on the family because she had been their stillborn child whom they had buried unbaptized under the threshold of their hut.75 The tale helped explain the high mortality of children and advised peasants to refrain from work on the Thursday of Troitsa week as a way of placating the rusalki. The walking dead could also harm the living by bringing upon them epidemics or weather disturbances, such as droughts and hailstorms. Peasants could explain these visitations as manifestations of the deceased’s jealousy, anger at a living relative for not fulfilling his or her last wishes, or longing for the world of the living. Illnesses were traditionally considered to be the work of witches and sorcerers; it was only a short extension for peasants to assume that the corpses of evil-minded persons were sometimes responsible for cholera or smallpox epidemics. During the cholera epidemics of the mid-nineteenth century, Russian peasants in some places believed that the first cholera victim was a\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n27\n\nvampire. To placate the deceased and end the epidemic, the unclean dead had to be disinterred, an act censured by both church and state. According to article 234 of the Russian Criminal Code, exhumation of bodies was a serious crime.76 That law, however, was insufficient to deter peasants from acting on their impulses when cholera raised its ugly head: On the seventeenth of August 1848, the pastor of the Veliko-Shukhovits church informed the local district judge that the peasants, against his will, had disinterred the deceased peasant girl Iustina Iushkov, had taken her out of the coffin, and had performed on her a ‘bestial operation’; and they had done this in order to end the reign of cholera among them. When an investigation was opened in this matter, the peasants admitted everything and recounted the following: Iushkov had been the first to die of cholera, but in August, when the epidemic grew in strength, the medical officer Rubtsov, who lived among them, had assured all the peasants that a dissolute girl who had died in a condition of pregnancy was the cause of the sickness. In order to drive away the cholera, it was necessary to open the grave and see what was the situation of the unborn child and whether or not the girl Iushkov’s mouth was open. If the mouth was open, then a stake must be driven into it. At first the peasants had not listened to the medical officer, but when the cholera continued to increase, they had decided to take refuge in the suggested method. They had opened the grave, taken out the corpse, and cut it open. But an unborn child was not to be found in the mother’s body, and so they had looked through the coffin and had found the body of a baby. Then they had thrown Iushkov back into the grave, but had first driven an aspen stake into her, since they had found her mouth open. After the peasants had done all this, they had covered up the grave and gone home in the complete expectation that the cholera had been disposed of.77\n\nDuring another cholera epidemic in 1851, Russian peasants dug up the corpses of a couple, decapitated them, cremated the heads, and then drove ashen stakes through the bodies.78 Before 1871, Ukrainian peasants reportedly would sometimes ‘cut off the head of the corpse and place it at its feet.’79 As late as 1893, an entire village in Sterlitamaksk district in the Russian province of Ufa responded to a raging epidemic by participating in the unearthing of a woman they believed to have been a sorceress. Peasants had reported that at night they saw a ball of fire emanating\n\n28\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nfrom the woman’s grave; it broke into smaller fires that carried the disease to various peasant huts. When the villagers dug up the unfortunate woman’s grave, they drove an aspen stake into her back.80 The Christian symbolism of the aspen stake – invoking Judas’s suicide by hanging himself from an aspen tree – is evident here. There are several reports from New Russia and the Volga provinces in the last three decades of the nineteenth century about exhumation of bodies felt to be responsible for unnatural frosts or drought. According to A.A. Levenstim, a nineteenth-century observer of rural practices, peasants believed that unconfessed persons became vampires upon their death and that they had the power to ‘milk the clouds and steal the dew from the ground of the village, in whose cemetery they are buried.’81 In some cases, villagers made a connection between environmental disasters and God’s ire over undeserved Christian burials. Here peasants were invoking traditional rights to bury alcoholics, murder victims, and witches and sorcerers outside the boundaries of the cemetery – rights that contravened contemporary secular law, which had overturned late seventeenthcentury regulations.82 For example, in 1890, in the midst of a drought, the Russian villagers of Usovka in Saratov district and province dug up the corpse of an alcoholic and threw it into the river Tereshka. The peasants rationalized their action by claiming, ‘God is punishing [us] with drought because we buried a drunk in the cemetery.’ Similar incidents were reported in May 1889 in the village of Kuromoch, Samara province, and in the village of Elshanka, Saratov province. In 1887, a correspondent from the newspaper Khar’kovskiia gubernskiia vedomosti related an incident in which a rumour circulated around the village of Ivanovka, Pavlograd district, Ekaterinoslav province, that their recently deceased znakhar’ (healer) and church elder had not died naturally, but had committed suicide. If this was true, a Christian Mass should not have been said over him and he should not have been buried in consecrated ground. In 1886, a lengthy drought visited the peasants of Ivanovka, and they connected the lack of rain with the tormented soul of the znakhar’. They opened his grave and poured four barrels of water into it. As they went to fill the fifth barrel, the rains began. This measure, however, had only a temporary effect. In 1887, with drought in their midst, the peasants removed the stone cross from the healer’s grave, broke it into several pieces, and buried the fragments out in the wild steppe. They also disinterred the znakhar’s body and threw it into a deep ravine far away from the village.83 It is difficult to estimate the number of times peasants exhumed the\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n29\n\nbodies of individuals believed responsible for natural disasters. However, it happened frequently enough for the bishop of Podol’ia and Bratslav in 1892 to admonish priests not to encourage peasants in their popular beliefs. Responding to an incident in which a priest had cooperated with his parishioners in digging up the body of a suicide victim, one Vasilii Shupakov, and throwing it into the forest, Bishop Dimitrii ordered the priest to serve penance at the St Troitskii Monastery in Kamenets for a month. Further, he wrote, It has come to the attention of the eparchial clergy that some priests, despite the archbishop’s admonition, are indifferent to the popular superstition that God punishes suicide with drought and other misfortunes until the bodies of the unfortunate are unearthed from the cemetery graves and thrown in either the forest or field, after which water is poured over the bodies; and not only do they not use their pastor’s influence to put a stop to this superstition, which they are obliged to do by their position and in carrying out eparchial instructions, but they also do not report such disgraceful actions (disinterring bodies, desecrating them, etc.) to their eparchial authorities.84\n\nWhile peasants believed it necessary to unearth the bodies of the unclean and to act contrary to the church and state injunctions, they accepted the Orthodox Church’s prohibition against disturbing the bodies of absolved Christians. In the early twentieth century, a priest and his parishioners, numbering almost fifteen hundred, tried to prevent legal and medical authorities from exhuming a body for an autopsy. They explained to the court investigator and feldsher (paramedic) ‘that once the burial service (otpevanie) had been performed by the priest, a body could not be dug up. “It is illegal!” claimed the priest, while the crowd shouted “Why dig him up? Why disturb him? It’s not allowed, batiushka! We also won’t permit it.”’85 The walking dead served an important function in nineteenthcentury Russian and Ukrainian peasant life. Their very existence and the elaborate stories about their revenge on the living provided a mechanism of control for the elderly, who had to contend with the challenges and disrespect of the younger generation. The fear of revenants among the living provided a measure of security for the elderly when they prepared their testaments and requested that the living bury them in a Christian fashion and have commemorative services. Invoking the wrath of the deceased was also a deterrent to disobeying the other provisions\n\n30\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nof a testament. Rebellious youths, who might scoff at some of the beliefs of their parents and grandparents, became believers when disaster struck those around them. In conclusion, death rituals among nineteenth-century Russian and Ukrainian peasants reveal a great deal about these societies. They were not as cut off from prescribed religion as contemporaries and historians have assumed. Peasants had absorbed the teachings of the Orthodox Church, interpreting them to fit their life’s circumstances in an attempt to cope with the loss of relatives and community members. Their beliefs were complementary rather than antagonistic to Orthodoxy’s conception of the universe. Easing the burdens of the soul on its journey to eternity through prayer and remembrance services was an important responsibility of the Christian community. The soul’s struggle to fend off demons and cleanse itself of sin created an image in the mind of these Orthodox peasants of an earthly world inhabited by demons and unclean spirits, who periodically visited upon them epidemics and weather that harmed the agricultural economy. As a result, the dead needed to be placated, and intercessors were necessary to carry out that responsibility. It was not sufficient to read the psalter and hold funeral and memorial services. Women of the community, whether the elderly who helped prepare the deceased’s body or the relatives who recited lamentations, supplemented the services of the male priesthood. Their laments and dreams in which they communicated with the dead may have taken place outside the church, but they were no less important in mediating between the worlds of the living and the dead. Not all mediations were successful. Individuals who suffered unnatural deaths were among the restless dead, existing in limbo between the other world and the world of the living. Suffering for their unchristian actions, they tormented the living by visiting plagues and storms upon them. As peasants began to understand their universe in educated terms and embalming practices were introduced, belief in the walking dead gradually disappeared. The point at which that belief began to erode must still be determined. Ethnographers observing the peasants in the first two decades of the twentieth century noted that the belief in the unclean dead was still very strong. Death rituals among Russian and Ukrainian peasants of the late imperial period expressed the peasants’ view of the world as an unpredictable and often hostile place. To combat that world and find the strength to go on living after a death, they embraced Christian beliefs and interwove them with their other survival strategies. Community\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n31\n\nparticipation was as important in the mourning and honouring of the dead as in the other dramatic events of life (such as birth and marriage) and in agricultural tasks. Social relationships and community unity were solidified in the face of death, which disrupted the family and community by removing a loved one. The careful observance of Christian memorial rites comforted the living: they, too, would be remembered when they died. The linkage between the worlds of the living and the dead also provided some safeguards against God’s wrath. The deceased joined the ranks of ancestors in heaven, who with their prayers could intercede with God on behalf of the living – as long as the living fulfilled their part of the bargain by remembering the dead. Calamities brought on by God’s wrath or by the revenge of the unclean dead could not be prevented but could, nevertheless, be mitigated by human action. Even the damned could ultimately be saved by constant prayers. The living could also take action to ease the suffering of the unclean dead and neutralize their evil – a responsibility peasants felt so strongly that they broke the law to exhume and mutilate bodies. If such action protected the living against further harm, the peasants at least gained some psychological comfort in their hostile world. Postscript Over a decade ago, when I wrote my essay on death ritual among Russian and Ukrainian peasants in the late imperial period, I had recently embarked upon a study of the religiosity of these rural peoples. Unsure about how to broach such a large and unexplored topic, I initially hoped to follow the lead of some nineteenth-century ethnographers and folklorists in analysing the role that demonology played in the religious world view of the peasantries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Little did I understand that in so doing I would uncover a world suffused with Orthodox beliefs. Immersing myself in the secondary literature on popular religion in Western Europe, I became deeply dissatisfied with the ahistorical concept of dvoeverie or dual faith that had been popular among nineteenth-century Russian intellectuals and continued to dominate Western historiography. According to that premise, nineteenth-century Orthodox peasants had only a superficial understanding of Orthodoxy; they were in essence practitioners of preChristian rituals and shared a world view that was more pagan than Christian. At about the same time that I wrote my critique of dvoeverie with regard to death ritual, Eve Levin, a specialist on medieval Russia,\n\n32\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\npublished her seminal criticism of the concept, inviting scholars of early modern Muscovy to learn from historians of medieval and early modern Western Europe in understanding the ways in which Christianity coopted and transformed paganism. Paganism certainly did not immediately disappear in ancient Rus’ after the forced conversion of the Rus’ people; but the new Christian religion, as it had done elsewhere in the world, was able to absorb aspects of paganism and in doing so convinced believers of the strength of its new beliefs. At the same time, not all Christian saints and holidays were merely replacements for pagan deities but had direct Christian roots.86 Professor Levin’s essay as well as subsequent works have largely succeeded in dampening enthusiasm for dvoeverie and have demonstrated the ways in which Christianity was actually taking root among its newly converted peoples.87 In addition to dismissing the concept of dvoeverie, historians have also begun a critical examination of church pronouncements that continually upbraided congregants for their ‘superstitious’ ways, charting how that rhetoric changed over time. Beginning in the mid-seventeenth century under the influence of rationalist thought, a reform movement within the Russian Orthodox Church, led by Ukrainian bishops, began to attack previously accepted popular religious practices such as the reverence for Holy Fools in Christ; ‘the veneration of unidentified [and uncorrupted] bodies as saints’; and the saying of incantations.88 Holy Fools in Christ had come under suspicion because of the support that some of them had given to the schismatic Old Believers, who rejected the Westernizing religious reforms of Patriarch Nikon and ultimately the Orthodox Muscovite state as the arbiter of correct religious beliefs. Desiring to wrest control away from popular healers, fortune-tellers, and sorcerers, the Orthodox Church hierarchs castigated their incantations over the sick as being ‘superstitious’ rather than ‘magical’ as a way of demoting ‘relations with the supernatural that were outside the regular channels of the church.’89 It did not matter to these ecclesiastics that these prayers or incantations were Christian in their content. The concern with veneration of uncorrupted bodies without proper investigation by the church had to await the Petrine church reforms. In the early eighteenth century Feofan Prokopovich, Peter I’s spiritual adviser, defined superstition in the 1721 Spiritual Regulation very broadly as ‘that which is superfluous, not essential to salvation, devised by hypocrites only for their own interest, beguiling the simple people, and like snowdrifts, hindering passage along the right path of truth.’ In essence, he ordered Orthodox bishops to be vigilant against aimlessly\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n33\n\nwandering monks, the building of unnecessary churches, false miracles before holy icons, individuals who believed themselves to be demon possessed, ‘noncertified corpses, and all other suchlike.’90 Continuing the process of the centralization of church authority, Prokopovich was wary of clerics making profits from unverified miracles and relics, the seemingly ubiquitous occurrence of miraculous cures among commoners, the shamming of individuals believed to be demon possessed, as well as wholly preserved corpses that believers automatically assumed were saints or intercessors before God. As far as Prokopovich and other bishops were concerned, popular beliefs in false miracles, the supposedly improper veneration of saints’ relics, and false claims of demonic possession only encouraged the schismatic Old Belief, sectarianism, and other competing faiths. Although saints’ cults and miracles sanctioned by the ancient Rus’ and Muscovite churches retained their accepted validity after 1721, the newly established Holy Synod rejected cults that were part of oral tradition alone. The discovery of new saints and the occurrence of miracles also did not receive official approval from a church bent on centralization and control of popular practices. When scrutiny of miracles had the undesirable effect by the early nineteenth century of turning the faithful away from the Orthodox Church into the hands of Old Believers and sectarians, the synodal church relaxed its scepticism towards them.91 It nonetheless continued to be very reticent about recognizing new icons as miracle working and glorifying new saints. In the course of the eighteenth century, the church glorified only one saint, Dimitrii, former bishop of Rostov, in 1757, and then four in the nineteenth, and six (including the reglorification of Anna of Kashin) in the early twentieth centuries. Some of the late canonizations, including that of Serafim of Sarov in 1903, resulted from political pressure by the autocracy.92 As for the laity’s own religious knowledge, oral culture was rich in religious imagery and understandings, but it too underwent change. Beginning in the early nineteenth century the Russian Orthodox Church began a concerted effort to teach parishioners the basics of the catechism as well as its evolving notions of what constituted ‘superstition’ through the vehicles of the sermon and formal catechesis, and in some cases extraliturgical discussions.93 Ultimately, however, extraliturgical discussions led by priests were far more common after the emancipation of the serfs. They became regular features of Orthodox parish life by the end of the nineteenth century. Through these informal sessions, clerics were able to enrich the rural laity’s religious culture.94 Post-\n\n34\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nemancipation peasants in both Russia and Ukraine also enhanced their understanding of Orthodoxy through the reading of religious pamphlets and periodicals, such as Troitskie listki (leaflets produced by the Holy Trinity–St Sergius Monastery in Sergiev Posad) and Russkii palomnik (The Russian Pilgrim), which they could buy cheaply from peddlers or read in parish libraries and village reading rooms. Here they could learn about the heroic lives of saints, the tales of miracle-working icons, miracle stories, and successful battles against evil spirits. They could also read descriptions of pilgrimage sites far and near.95 Even in regions of low literacy, the literate shared their knowledge by reading out loud and retelling the stories they had read. It is to the subject of uncorrupted bodies that I would like to turn my attention briefly. In my essay on death ritual, I examined the Ukrainian and Russian peasants’ beliefs in unclean corpses, but in doing so neglected their far more important and ubiquitous veneration of saints’ relics that were preserved whole. The following comments represent an updating of my previous views, based on my own and others’ research endeavours over the past decade. The famous crypts of the Pecherskaia Lavra in Kiev attest to the long-standing veneration of uncorrupted holy individuals’ bodies in Eastern Slavic Orthodoxy. Although incorruptibility was not a canonical precondition for glorification of a holy person, it became a popular marker of God’s grace upon an individual who through intercession with the Almighty could effect miraculous cures posthumously. In fact, late nineteenth-century clerics stressed incorruptibility as a desirable characteristic of a saint. The resplendent gold and silver reliquaries of saints in monasteries and churches gave worshipers a ‘preview of what was in store for all men and women when Christ came again to judge the living and the dead, and thus served as proof of the timeless truths of the Orthodox faith against the claims of rival denominations.’96 The veneration of saints’ relics was rampant throughout Orthodox communities in the modern Russian Empire. In the nineteenth century hundreds of thousands of pilgrims annually took advantage of cheap railway fares to traverse the empire’s sacred landscape in search of miraculous cures and redemption. By the eve of the First World War thousands travelled by steamship to the Holy Land and Mount Athos (which was, of course, restricted to men). They took the advice of popular periodicals and guidebooks to monasteries in planning out their routes and times of travel, which tended to coincide with major saints’ days, the glorification of new saints, and the feast days of the\n\nDeath Ritual among Russian and Ukrainian Peasants\n\n35\n\nMother of God, whose miracle-working icons were scattered at various holy sites. The most popular long-distance pilgrimage sites within the empire included the Pecherskaia Lavra and Pochaiv Lavra in Ukraine, the Holy Trinity–St Sergius Lavra outside Moscow, and Solovki on the White Sea.97 Most pilgrims, however, gravitated towards nearby monasteries, which housed local saints who provided spiritual and physical succour for local communities.98 Peasants seeking cures for themselves or their relatives turned to the thaumaturgical powers of the Orthodox Church. As was the case of the faithful who converged on Lourdes, ‘pilgrims were willing to risk death, and saw their audacity as a test that might hasten the “resurrections” they sought.’99 However much in pain, humble pilgrims either walked the entire distance or the last leg of their journey to their holy destinations. Thus, for example, a thirty-year-old paralyzed unmarried woman insisted on walking the 200 versts to the cathedral of Belgorod which housed relics of St Ioasaf of the same city. She was part of a procession of the cross that left from the parish church in Senna, Bogodukhovsk uezd, Khar’kov province, in the spring of 1912, several months after the glorification of St Ioasaf. According to her fellow pilgrims, she sought ultimate redemption through death, but only after being able to visit the saint’s grave and take communion there. ‘I do not wish to be healed,’ she is reported as saying. ‘I am already old and besides will be a parasite on my parents; I would be so happy if God helped me to get to Belgorod, to prostrate myself before the relics of God’s saint, [and] to sob out my grief before him, and having [the opportunity to] take communion, even if I were to die, I would be happy.’ Ultimately, the pilgrim did reach the relics but died on the journey home.100 For those too sick to undertake pilgrimages, relatives or professional pilgrims journeyed on their behalf, carrying their donations of money, ribbons, and cloth for prayer services, and requests for healings or salvation to monastic shrines and returning with communion bread, candles, holy water and oil, and paper icons. More precious still were the mementos that pilgrims brought from the Holy Land, including pieces of candles that had been burned in Christ’s tomb at Easter, crosses, and other religious paraphernalia, which they sold to villagers eager for communion with Christ’s life.101 Generally, older pilgrims travelled to the Holy Land in fulfilment of a lifetime desire and in some cases vows to visit these holy sites before they died. The popular Orthodox veneration of the holy uncorrupted body and the long tradition of viewing a dead body at funerals meant that the\n\n36\n\nChristine D. Worobec\n\nscientific procedure of cremation made little headway in rural areas of Russia and Ukraine until after the Second World War.102 It is little wonder that the Bolsheviks appropriated and transformed the Orthodox veneration of the body by permanently displaying Lenin’s embalmed body in a new secular temple. At the same time, their assaults upon saints’ relics and attempts to unmask them as fraudulent and ‘corrupted’ were unsuccessful in persuading the faithful that their beliefs in saints were not only superstitious, but also a result of deceitful clerics bent on keeping their flocks in thrall to an exploitative system. As Eve Levin points out with regard to early modern Muscovy, ‘“incorruptibility” lay, like miracles, in the desire of the beholder.’103\n\nNOTES An earlier version of this article appeared in Stephen P.

See A.G. Rashin, Naselenie Rossii za 100 let (1811–1913 gg.): Statisticheskie ocherki (Moscow, 1956), 5. Nevertheless, these rates were extremely high and reflective of a premodern society. More than 25 per cent of infants died within the first year of life; an additional 20 per cent did not reach adulthood.
