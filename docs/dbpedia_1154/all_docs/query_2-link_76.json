        "text": "What is your name?\n\nAlexandra Vasilievna Superanskaya\n\nDoctor of Philologyuk\n\nLet's talk about common Russian names. What do they mean? Where do they come from?\n\nMost modern Russian names were borrowed in the 10th century new era from Byzantium along with the Christian religion. These names were legalized, recorded in special books - “saints” and declared “real”, “correct”. After the introduction of Christianity in Rus', it was allowed to give names only through the church (at baptism). The “saints” also included some names of common Slavic origin, which arose long before the baptism of Rus', in an era when the Slavic community did not break up into tribal groups, from which separate groups were subsequently formed. Slavic peoples. These common Slavic names (Vladimir, Yaroslav, Svyatoslav, Vsevolod...) and some Scandinavian names (Igor, Oleg...) were usually not given ordinary people and were considered \"princely\" names. Only at the end of the last century these names were revived by the Russian intelligentsia. Their use expanded significantly after the revolution. At the same time, such ancient common Slavic names as Stanislav, Mstislav, Bronislav, adopted by other Slavic peoples, came into life.\n\nSpecial place By their origin, the names Faith, Hope, Love are occupied. The Greeks did not have such names. However, in Greek legends there were symbolic figures of Faith (Pistis), Hope (Elpis) and Love (Agape), but they were not given to people as names. Obviously, when compiling the Russian church nomenclature, the names of these symbolic figures served as the basis for creating the names Faith, Hope, Love from the verbal material of the Russian language. This type of borrowing, when a word in another language is created based on the model of one language from its linguistic material, is called tracing paper in linguistics, and the process of such borrowing itself is tracing paper.\n\nWhere did the Byzantine names that formed the basis of the Russian “saints” come from? The Byzantine Greeks collected the best, of course, from their point of view, names of all those peoples with whom they maintained trade and cultural relations. Along with names ancient Greek origin they used ancient Roman and Hebrew. As separate inclusions in the list of Byzantine names there are ancient Persian, ancient Egyptian, Chaldean, Syrian, Babylonian...\n\nIf we begin to consider canonical names according to the meaning of the words from which they originate, we will immediately notice our own characteristics in them. For example, almost all names of ancient Greek origin emphasize good moral and physical qualities in people. Here are the meanings of some of them: Andrey - courageous; Nikifor - victorious; Tikhon - happy; Agata - beautiful; Sofia is wise. Most Roman names also celebrate the good in people: Victor - winner; Valentin, Valery - healthy; Pulchernya is wonderful. Hebrew names differ sharply from Greek and Latin names. Most of them include an element with the meaning god (il, io): Gabriel - warrior of God; Elijah - the power of God; John - God's grace.\n\nDespite the fact that the names taken from the “saints” have been given to Russians for a whole millennium, they still remain two-thirds alien to the Russian people: after all, they arose on foreign soil and were artificially transplanted into Russia.\n\nThe names Evelina or Eleanor among our contemporaries look less strange and unusual than the names Theodora or Aquilina among their distant great-great-grandmothers of the 10th century. The difference is that the names Evelina or Eleanor are familiar to us from literary works; we meet them in newspapers and can easily pronounce them, while the poor illiterate great-great-grandmothers could not even turn their tongues to pronounce the names that they were given at baptism, and they had never heard such outlandish words and, how and why These words came to Rus' and they could not really understand them. However, canonization is canonization, and they diligently pronounced their “outlandish” names, distorting them beyond recognition, turning Aquilina into Akulina, Theodore into Feodor, Dionysius into Denis, Diomede into Demid, Juliania into Ulyana. This is how the process of Russification of non-Russian names took place, the process of turning foreign and difficult to pronounce words into our own, familiar, close and easy to pronounce.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that all canonical names without exception underwent such changes, many of them remained alien to the Russian people and the Russian language.\n\n\"Science and Life\", No. 8, 1964.\n\nThe article is abbreviated\n\nAbout the list of names posted on this site\n\nThe list shows the different spellings of names ( Adrian - Andrian), their folk forms ( Adrian,Andriyan,Andreyan), diminutive and short forms, Church Slavonic variants for names present in the Orthodox calendar ( Sergey-Sergius), Latinized forms for names included in the Catholic calendar ( Sergius), as well as information about the meaning and origin of the name.\n\nAbbreviations used:\n\ndecrease - diminutive\n\nprod. - derivative\n\nmedieval - medieval\n\nmodern - modern\n\nancient german - Old Germanic\n\nOld-Hebrew - Hebrew\n\nlat. - Latin\n\nCeltic - Celtic, belonging to the Celtic group of languages\n\nAncient Greek - ancient Greek\n\nOld Scand. - Old Norse\n\nNorman - Norman\n\nfr. - French\n\nold-fashioned - Old French\n\nProvence - Provençal\n\nOther English - Old English\n\nIt is not known for certain when exactly proper names were identified as a separate group. But already in 280-205. BC. The Stoic philosopher Chrysippus mentioned names as a separate group. Nowadays, there is a whole science called anthroponymy, which studies the names of people, their structure, their emergence, development and functioning in society. The names themselves are called anthroponyms.\n\nPeople have always given each other names or nicknames that have accompanied them throughout their lives. No one knows how it started, but there are many legends and stories about it. According to one version, from the time the Supreme Mind gave people the ability to speak, it was believed that every word gave power over the object or phenomenon that it means. All people wanted to have power. Then the priests came up with other names for everything in the world, and many languages ​​arose. The original language was hidden from ordinary people and consigned to oblivion. The names suffered the same fate. Such legends about the appearance different languages Many peoples of the world have it.\n\nNow people began to come up with names for themselves. In some cultures, it was believed that knowing a person's true name could harm him. Therefore, people were often given two names. One was used in the family circle, and the other was given for general use. In ancient times, people believed that a name influenced a person’s destiny and that it was not just a word. Different peoples used this knowledge in different ways.\n\nFor example, in some tribes of India and Africa it was customary to give repulsive and unfavorable names, since it was believed that an unsightly name would repel evil spirits. It was believed that a person should not tell his true name to anyone except his parents. And in India, a person learned his real name only on the day of his majority from communication with spirits or through meditation. Often these names could not even be pronounced, since they were not familiar to us, but consisted of a mixture of images and sounds.\n\nIN Ancient Greece It was customary to name children after the names of Gods and heroes. But calling a child by the name of God was quite dangerous, since it could hurt them, so many names appeared that came from those epithets with which the Gods were praised. This is how the names Victor (winner) and Maxim (greatest) appeared. These epithets were used to praise Zeus in their prayers. The names Laurus (from the laurel wreath worn by Mars) and Stephen (crowned) also appeared.\n\nIt was very popular to give children the names of Gods who did not belong to the ruling elite of Olympus. Names such as Apollo, Maya, Muse and Aurora are still used today. In Christian countries, it was also common to name children after saints.\n\nRussian names\n\nNames, like everything else in the world, have their own history. They, like other words, are created by human imagination, flourish, die, disappearing from the language of the people who were their creator. The history of Russian names goes back to a very distant era and is closely connected with the history of the Russian people and their language.\n\nAbout four thousand years ago, ancient tribes lived on the plains stretching between the Odra, Vistula and Dnieper rivers - the ancestors of the ancient Slavs. These tribes lived in a tribal system and spoke the same language, which scientists call Common Slavic.\n\nWhen the process of unification of tribes began, the Slavs living in the East of Europe laid the foundation for the Russian nation. Their language began to differ somewhat from the language of other Slavs, although it did not lose its family ties with them and with the common Slavic language from which it originated.\n\nThe oldest monuments of Russian writing date back to the 10th – 11th centuries. From this time on, a reliable, scientifically based history of Russian names begins.\n\nAncient Russian names were unique characteristics of people. The name was given to a person as a sign by which one could distinguish him from a family or clan.\n\nIn some cases, a person was characterized by some external characteristic, in others - by moral qualities, by position in the tribe or family, in relation to him by parents and relatives, and sometimes by his occupation. The latter was possible because names were given not only in early childhood, as now, but also in adulthood. At the same time, the adult name often lived simultaneously with the child’s name.\n\nHere are some ancient names-characteristics:\n\naccording to a person’s appearance: Small, White, Oblique, Pockmarked, Curly, Chernysh;\n\nby human character trait: Kind, Clever, Proud, Quiet, Brave, Proud, Fool, Boyan;\n\nby place in the family: First, Second, Drugan, Tretyak, Zhdan, Nechay, Menshak, Senior;\n\nby profession: Kozhemyaka, Villager, Warrior, etc.\n\nWhen you first encounter such a name, you might think that these are not names, but nicknames. After all, there is no difference between a name and a nickname in ancient Rus' did not have. And each of these names can be documented.\n\nIn the ancient handwritten book “The Initial Russian Chronicle” it is mentioned, for example, that the leader of the East Slavic tribe of the Drevlyans named Mal. What does this name mean? Nothing else except that its owner was not tall. The prince's name was a short but very expressive description of him. The name Mal seems funny to us, but a thousand years ago it never occurred to anyone to see this as some kind of encroachment on princely dignity, because characterization names were common and taken for granted.\n\nThe names Brave and Good were also found in ancient manuscripts. They speak of the high moral qualities of their bearers. The name Dobrynya (derived from the name Dobr) means “very kind”, “very good”. Zhdan means “the one who was expected.” In ancient Rus', this name was given to children whose birth was a great joy for their parents. Now only the Zhdanov surname retains traces of this name at its core. The names First and Second arose in large families, where the number of children often exceeded a dozen. In such cases, it was difficult to select characteristic names. The name was chosen simply: he was the first to be born - get the name First or First; born second, you will be second or friend, etc. up to the Ninth and even the Tenth.\n\nSuch numeral names were found not only among Russians or Slavs, but also among other peoples of Europe. They were quite common among the ancient Romans: Quintus - the fifth, Sextus - the sixth, Septimius - the Seventh, Octavius ​​- the Eighth, Nonnius - the Ninth, Decimus - the tenth, by the way, the name Nonna came into the Russian language, which means the Ninth. From the roots of ancient Russian nouns, the surnames Pervovy, Pervushin, Drugov, Tretyakov, Devyatovsky, Desyatov and the like were later formed.\n\nThe name Menshak (Menshik, Menshoy) was given to the youngest son, and the first-born in such a family received the name Elder. Probably these names were already given to adults, because... It is difficult to determine in advance which of the children will be the last. Of course, the grown-up names had a professional connotation: Selyanin, Kozhemyaka, Boyan.\n\nThe name Boyan is based on the root - fight, sign. Boyan is a fighter, a warrior. In ancient handwritten documents, the name Boyan is pronounced and written in the Moscow manner with a vowel a: Bayan. The re-vocalization of the name led to its rethinking: it began to be explained based on the basis of the verb “bayat”, i.e. speak - “talker”, “storyteller”, “songwriter”. This name was given to the famous ancient world musician-performer and singer. In honor of him, they named one of the people’s favorite instruments - Bayan.\n\nThe whole world seemed animate to our ancestors, all objects had properties similar to human ones, so the ancient Slavs began to use the names of birds, animals, plants and various objects as personal names: Wolf, Bear, Nightingale, Beetle, Eagle, Pike, Oak , Birch, etc.\n\nThe desire to be like this or that animal seems ridiculous to us. But ancient people thought differently: the wolf is not beautiful, but he is strong and resilient. And these properties are useful to humans. Therefore, in ancient Rus' it was not uncommon to meet a man with such a formidable animal name.\n\nSubsequently, this name fell out of use among the ancient Slavs, but a derivative from it remained - this is the surname Volkov. But it still exists in many languages ​​of the world, which is explained by the internationality of the very principle of using common nouns. So among the Serbs the name Wolf sounds like Vuk, in German as a component of the names Wolfgang, Adolf, Rudolf. It was also found in ancient European languages: in Gothic - Ulf or Wulf, in Latin Lupus, from which, by the way, came the Russian name Lup, which is found in A. N. Ostrovsky’s play “Puchna” - Lup Lupych Pereyarkov. The name Nightingale was given in ancient times to talented singers. It is not difficult to guess that the Solovyov surname came from this name.\n\nAlso, the ancient Slavs had blind faith in mascot names, names with a trick.\n\nBecause Our ancestors were very afraid of “evil spirits”, evil words, the evil eye and other dangers that seemed to them everywhere. According to their ideas, those who were most in danger were those who were more honest, whose intelligent, positive traits were usually emphasized by their names and characteristics. In order to deceive evil people and evil spirits caring parents deliberately gave their good children bad names. Boys who were smart and beautiful were deliberately called Fools and Freaks, honest and brave boys were called Scoundrels and Cowards, and those dear to the heart were called Nechayami.\n\nTraces of such “preventative” names have survived to this day in the foundations modern surnames such as Nechaevs, Durakovs, etc.\n\nWhat to name a newborn? This question worries many parents. In pre-revolutionary times, the issue of a name for a child was resolved simply. Registration of newborn children was carried out only by the church where the baptism ceremony took place. Thus, not a single child escaped baptism, even if his parents were unbelievers.\n\nWhat names were given then? In the Russian Orthodox Church there were (and still are) special books - monthly books, or calendars. In the month's book, for each day of each month, the names of the saints who are honored by the church on that day are written down. Before the baptismal ceremony, the priest offered a choice of several names that were listed in the calendar for the child’s birthday. This usually ended the matter.\n\nWhy were there so many Ivans in Rus'? Yes, for the simple reason that the name Ivan (John) appears 170 times (!) in the complete calendar, that is, almost every other day.\n\nTrue, sometimes the priest made concessions and, at the request of the parents, gave a different name, which was not listed in the calendar for that day. This, in fact, explains that sometimes a name that is rarely found in the calendar appears quite often in life. Thus, the Slavic names Vera, Nadezhda and Lyubov were often given to children in pre-revolutionary times, despite the fact that Vera appears in the calendar only twice a year, and Nadezhda and Lyubov only once each.\n\nBut, in any case, the child could only be given the name that was in the calendar. No “free thinking” was allowed here.\n\nParents found themselves in a different position after the Great October Socialist Revolution. Registration of newborns began to be carried out by civil registry offices (registry offices), and parents could now choose any name: old (former church), borrowed name (Polish, German, etc.) and, finally, could even invent a new name.\n\nTaking advantage of the freedom to choose a name, parents sometimes gave their children strange, unusual names. About three thousand new and borrowed names are known, which, with rare exceptions, will never take root on Russian soil. Here are names such as Oak, Birch, Carnation, Lilac. Almost all elements of the Mendeleev system (Radium, Vanadium, Tungsten, Iridium, Ruthenium, etc.), minerals (Granite, Ruby) are represented. Personal names include geographical names (Altai, Himalaya, Kazbek, Ararat, Volga, Onega, Amur, Cairo, etc.) and all names of months, from January to December, mathematical terms and technical names (Median, Radian , Hypotenuse, Algebrina, Tractor, Turbine, Railcar, Diesel, Combine, etc.).\n\nA lot of names were derived from revolutionary slogans, names of institutions, etc. For example, Ikki (Executive Committee Communist International), Roblen (born to be a Leninist), Remizan (the world revolution took up), Revvola (revolutionary wave), Revdit (revolutionary child), Lorikarik (Lenin, October Revolution, industrialization, collectivization, electrification, radioification and communism), Loriex (Lenin, October Revolution, industrialization, electrification, collectivization, socialism).\n\nThere is no need to even talk about such dissonant names as Tsas (Central Pharmaceutical Warehouse), Glasp (Glavspirt), Raitiya (district printing house) and the like.\n\nIn the post-revolutionary period, the influx of foreign names increased. There are names borrowed from different nations: Robert, Romuald, Rudolph, Richard, Josephine, Edward, Eric, Jeanne, etc.\n\nNames appear that consist of two or even several words: White Night, Artillery Academy, Hammer and Sickle, Jean-Paul-Marat. L.V. Uspensky in the article “They call Zovutka” gives the following female names: Great Worker (!) and Cherry Blossom in May.\n\nFinally, there are also names - from the words read from the end: Ninel - Lenin, Avksoma - Moscow.\n\nGetting carried away too much foreign names, parents forgot that these names often sound dissonant with the Russian patronymic and surname of the bearer of the name. For example: Harry Semenovich Popov, Diana Krivonogova, Robert Ovechkin, Red Alekseevich.\n\nSometimes “revolutionary” names fall into the same awkward combination, for example: Revolution Kuzminichna. Some parents like to give their daughters a diminutive form of their name instead of the full form. Sometimes in registry offices they write it down like this: Lyusya, Ira, Ina, Rita, Nata, etc. While the bearers of the name are still children, this sounds good. But Nata graduated from high school and became a teacher, Aga became a doctor, Rita became an engineer. And how ridiculous it will sound: teacher Nata Petrovna, famous surgeon Lena Romanovna, or even better: professor Lyusya Kondratievna Kondakova!\n\nBut the fate, perhaps, of most of these names is the same: the bearer of such a name grows up and raises the question of changing it.\n\nIt is impossible not to mention the so-called “fashion” for names. It seems even the most beautiful names lose their charm if they occur too often. Teacher S.N. Uvarova from the village of Korostovo, Ryazan region, writes that “out of 23 students who graduated from the seven-year school in 1955, there were 17 Nins! Over the past two years, newborn girls in the named village are called either Tanya or Nadya. Exceptions are rare.\" IN different periods Male names Valery, Gennady, Igor, Gleb, Vsevolod, Vadim were very fashionable. And this is not only in the village. The same thing is written in newspapers in Leningrad and other cities.\n\nIs there a need to blindly follow the example of others with such a wealth of Russian names?\n\nI would like to warn parents about their desire to name their child something special. This leads to the appearance of pretentious names that are unusual for a Russian person and, as a rule, does not subsequently bring joy to their child. It is difficult to recommend names because the choice of name is determined by the taste of the parents. But first of all, old Russian names deserve attention, such as Peter, Alexander, Constantine, Ivan, Maria, etc. Although in the distant past these names were borrowed by us from the Greeks, they have existed on Russian soil for almost a thousand years and have long since become Russified and overgrown a large number of derivative forms.\n\nIn addition to the so-called canonical names, many old Russian and Slavic names have come into use among us. For example: Borimir, Borislav, Mstislav, Peresvet, Svetozar, Svyatoslav, Dobroslava, Miloslava, Vsemila, Lyubomir, etc.\n\nFinally, some new names, successfully composed, have also caught on and can be recommended. This famous names Vladilen, Vladilena, Ninel and others.\n\nSurnames\n\nSurnames in the Russian nominal formula appeared quite late. Most of them came from patronymics (based on the baptismal or secular name of one of the ancestors), nicknames (based on the type of activity, place of origin, or some other characteristic of the ancestor) or other family names. The first people in the Russian lands to acquire surnames were citizens of Veliky Novgorod, who probably adopted this custom from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Then in the XIV-XV centuries. Moscow appanage princes and boyars acquired surnames. Before late XVIII- in the middle of the 19th century, the majority of the population of central Russia did not have surnames. As a rule, Russian surnames were single and passed down only through the male line. In the middle of the 19th century, especially after the abolition of serfdom in 1861, surnames were formed for the majority of peasants. The process of acquiring surnames was basically completed only by the 30s of the 20th century.\n\nFor the first time, E.P. Karnovich turned to the study of surnames in Russia, who in the second half of the 19th century. compiled the \"Dictionary of Old Russian Names and Surnames\" (St. Petersburg, 1903). But only in the 1980s did the geographical environment Slavic surnames was first analyzed in the posthumous capital work of V. A. Nikonov “Geography of Surnames” (M., 1988). Based on a study of the funds of 52 archives, he collected the names of more than 3 million Russian people rural population, and also according to additional sources - more than 1 million people.\n\nThe geography of Russian surnames allows us to trace the movement of the population, “migration routes,” and the area of ​​settlement. The origin of such surnames as Ryazantsev, Yaroslavtsev, Tambovtsev is obvious. Surnames ending in -y, -i (Chernykh, Kosykh, Sedykh, etc.) are, as a rule, absent in the Moscow region and are common in Siberia, the Urals, in the interfluve of the Northern Dvina and Sukhona rivers, in the Voronezh - Kursk \"triangle\" - Eagle. On the contrary, surnames with the suffix ending in -itin were mainly found near Moscow (Borovitinov, Bolkhovitinov) and a little further (Tveritinov).\n\nV. A. Nikonov drew attention to the strict geographical location of the origin of Russian surnames (now mixed). He was the first to divide the European part of Russia according to the most common surnames (surnames-“champions” in the words of V. A. Nikonov), highlighting:\n\n1) Ivanovia, which he associated with the former Novgorod and Pskov lands;\n\n2) Smirnovia, located in the Upper Volga region, on the territory of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality;\n\n3) Popovia, Russian North;\n\n4) Kuznetsoviya, the territory of later (XVI-XVII centuries) Russian settlement to the south and east of Ivanovia and Smirnovia.\n\nV. A. Nikonov also rightly noted some confusion between Popovia and Kuznetsovia. He compiled a map with four outlined arrays - based on the dominant surnames.\n\nUsing computer methods, it is possible, figuratively speaking, to “color the map” with a large number of colors, which was used by V. A. Nikonov. In this case, less “pure” but more accessible sources were used.\n\nThe main source was not scattered documents from rural registry offices and voter lists, but city telephone directories compiled at the same time, which Nikonov used as auxiliary material. The starting point for the calculations was a table containing the occurrence of one hundred and three of the most “popular” surnames in 516 cities in the USSR. The output table of pairwise correlations of surnames 103x103 was processed manually. Groups of surnames were identified according to a threshold value of the correlation coefficient so that the groups did not overlap (it turned out to be 0.40). As a result, the following groups of surnames were identified (surnames associated with the area by V. A. Nikonov are marked):\n\n1) Vasiliev, Fedorov, Ivanov, Petrov, Nikolaev, Alekseev, Alexandrov, Yakovlev, Mikhailov, Semenov, Andreev, Grigoriev - tied to the Pskov-Novgorod lands;\n\n2) Smirnov, Rumyantsev, Tikhomirov, Sokolov, Lebedev, Tsvetkov, Vinogradov, Belov, Soloviev, Belyaev, Kudryavtsev, Krylov, Orlov - on the territory of the former Vladimir-Suzdal principality.\n\nThree groups of surnames without a specific geographical reference:\n\n3) Popov, Martynov, Medvedev, Melnikov, Chernov, Shcherbakov;\n\n4) Vorobyov, Gusev, Zaitsev, Sorokin;\n\n5) Prokhorov, Frolov, Rodionov, Savelyev;\n\nand 64 surnames that defy either classification or localization.\n\nAnalysis of the geography of Russian surnames helps to deeply study demographic processes, the history of the ethnic group, families, various sociocultural and even socio-economic problems.\n\nMeaning and etymology\n\nAnthroponymy of Russian surnames states that most often surnames are formed from personal names through possessive adjectives. The bulk of Russian surnames have the suffixes -ov/-ev, -in, from the answer to the question “whose?” The difference is purely formal: -ov was added to nicknames or names with a hard consonant (Ignat - Ignatov, Mikhail - Mikhailov), -ev to names or nicknames with a soft consonant (Ignaty - Ignatiev, Golodyay - Golodyaev), -in to stems with a, I (Putya (Putyata) - Putin, Busyga - , Erema - Eremin, Ilya - Ilyin). This also suggests that, for example, the surnames Golodaev and Golodyaev, which have the same root, are related, but the outwardly similar Golodov, Golodnov, Golodny are not at all.\n\nThe vast majority of Russian surnames come from dedichestvo, the temporary surname of the father, that is, the name of the grandfather, thus securing the hereditary name in the third generation. This made it easier to designate families of the same root. If the grandfather, whose name formed the basis of the established surname, had two names - one baptismal, the other everyday, then the surname was formed from the second, since baptismal names did not differ in variety.\n\nIt should be noted that Russian officials wrote down their grandfather’s name in late XIX- the beginning of the 20th century and surnames for residents of national outskirts, thus the majority of surnames in Transcaucasia and Central Asia arose.\n\nRussian surnames are mainly formed as patronymics from church or non-church personal names or nicknames, for example, Ivan > Ivanov son > Ivanov, Medved > Medvedev son > Medvedev. This also includes surnames derived from nicknames associated with the profession: Goncharov, Melnikov, Krasilnikov.\n\nMuch less often - from the names of the area, for example Belozersky from Beloozero. This method of formation is especially characteristic of princely families, however (unlike Western Europe) is not typical for nobles.\n\nThe surnames of the clergy are derived from the names of parishes (for example, Kosmodemyansky, Rozhdestvensky) or artificially created in the seminary (Afinsky, Dobrovolsky).\n\nThe origin of Russian surnames\n\nIn different social strata, surnames appeared at different times. The first in the Russian lands to acquire surnames were citizens of Veliky Novgorod and its vast possessions in the north, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Ural Range. Novgorod chroniclers mention many surnames and nicknames already in the 13th century. So in 1240, among the Novgorodians who fell in the Battle of the Neva, the chronicler mentions the names: “Kostyantin Lugotinits, Gyuryata Pineshchinich, Namest, Drochilo Nezdylov, son of a tanner.” In 1268, “having killed the mayor Mikhail, and Tverdislav Chermny, Nikifor Radyatinich, Tverdislav Moisievich, Mikhail Krivtsevich, Ivach, Boris Ildyatinich, his brother Lazor, Ratsha, Vasil Voiborzovich, Osip, Zhiroslav Dorogomilovich, Poroman Podvoisky, Polyud, and many good ъ boyars \". In 1270, “Gavrilo Kyyaninov and his other friends ran to the prince on the Settlement of the Thousand Ratibor.” In the same year, Prince Vasily Yaroslavich “went to the Tatars, taking Petril Rychag and Mikhail Pineshchinich with him.” In 1311, “Kostyantin, Ilyin’s son Stanimirovich, was quickly killed.” In 1315, Prince Mikhail Tverskoy demanded from the Novgorodians: “give me Fyodor Zhrevsky.” In 1316 “Danilko Scribe was killed quickly.” In 1327, “the Novgorodians sent Fyodor the Chariot to the Horde.” In 1329, “I killed the Novgorod ambassador of the honest husband Ivan Syp in Yuryev.” In 1332 “Vastasha rebelled in Novgorod, and took away the posadnichestvo from Fyodor from Akhmyl and gave to Zakharya Mikhailovich, and plundered the courtyard of Smena Sudokov.”\n\nSomewhat later in the XIV-XV centuries. family names appeared among princes and boyars. The princes were nicknamed by the name of their inheritance, and the moment of the emergence of the surname should be considered the moment when the prince, having lost his inheritance, still retained his name as a nickname for himself and his descendants: Shuisky, Vorotynsky, Obolensky, Vyazemsky, etc. A minority of princely surnames originate from nicknames: Gagarins, Humpbacks, Glazatye, Lykovs, etc. Surnames like Lobanov-Rostovsky connect the name of the reign with the nickname. Boyar and noble families were also formed from nicknames or from the names of their ancestors. The process of formation of boyar surnames from hereditary nicknames is well illustrated by the history of the boyar (later royal) family of the Romanovs. Its ancestors were those who lived in the 14th century. Andrey Ivanovich Kobyla and Fyodor Andreevich Koshka Kobylin. The descendants of Fyodor Koshka for several generations bore the nickname-surname Koshkins (however, not all of them: his son Alexander Bezzubets became the ancestor of the Bezzubtsevs, and another son Fyodor Goltyai became the ancestor of the Goltyaevs). The names of his son Ivan and grandson Zakhary Ivanovich were Koshkins. Among the children of the latter, Yakov Zakharovich Koshkin became the founder of the noble family of the Yakovlevs, and Yuri Zakharovich began to be called Zakharyin-Koshkin, while the son of the latter was already called Roman Zakharyin-Yuryev. The surname Zakharyin-Yuryev, or simply Zakharyin, was also borne by Roman’s son, Nikita Romanovich (as well as his sister Anastasia, the first wife of Ivan the Terrible); however, the children and grandchildren of Nikita Romanovich were already called Romanovs, including Fyodor Nikitich (Patriarch Filaret) and Mikhail Fedorovich (Tsar).\n\nAt the end of the 15th century. among the Russian nobles the first surnames of foreign origin appear, primarily the surnames of Polish-Lithuanian and Greek (eg. Philosophy) immigrants; in the 17th century to them are added such surnames of Western origin as Fonvizins, Lermontovs. The surnames of the descendants of Tatar immigrants were reminiscent of the names of these immigrants: Yusupov, Akhmatov, Kara-Murza, Karamzin (also from Kara-Murza). However, it should be noted that the eastern origin of a surname does not always indicate the eastern origin of its bearers: in some cases, they come from Tatar nicknames that were in fashion in Moscow Rus'. This is the surname Bakhteyarova, which was borne by the branch of the Rostov Rurik princes (from Fyodor Priimkov-Bakhteyar), or the surname Beklemishev, which came from the nickname Beklemish (Turkish - guarding, guarding), which was borne by Fyodor Elizarovich, the boyar of Vasily I.\n\nDuring this period, peasants usually did not have surnames; their function was performed by nicknames and patronymics, as well as the mention of their owner, since in the 16th century. The peasantry of central Russia was subjected to mass enslavement. For example, in archival documents of that time one can find the following entries: “Ivan Mikitin’s son, and his nickname is Menshik,” entry from 1568; “Onton Mikiforov’s son, and nickname is Zhdan,” document from 1590; “Guba Mikiforov, son of Crooked Cheeks, landowner,” entry from 1495; “Danilo Soplya, peasant”, 1495; “Efimko Sparrow, peasant,” 1495. In these records one can see indications of the status of still free peasants (landowner), as well as the difference between the patronymic and the surname (son of such and such). The peasants of northern Russia, the former Novgorod possessions, could have real surnames in this era, since serfdom did not apply to these areas. Probably the most famous example This kind of person is Mikhailo Lomonosov. You can also remember Arina Rodionovna Yakovleva, a Novgorod peasant woman and Pushkin’s nanny. Cossacks also had surnames. Surnames were also given to a significant part of the population of the lands that were previously part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth - Belarus to Smolensk and Vyazma, Little Russia.\n\nUnder Peter the Great, by Senate Decree of June 18, 1719, in connection with the introduction poll tax and conscription, the earliest police registration documents were officially introduced - travel certificates (passports). The passport contained information: name, surname (or nickname), where he came from, where he was going, place of residence, characteristics of his type of activity, information about family members who were traveling with him, sometimes information about his father and parents.\n\nBy decree of January 20, 1797, Emperor Paul I ordered the preparation of a General Armorial noble families where more than 3,000 noble family names and coats of arms were collected.\n\nDistribution of surnames among merchants and service people\n\nIn the XVIII-XIX centuries. surnames began to spread among civil servants and merchants. At first, only the richest - the “eminent merchants” - were awarded the honor of receiving a surname. In the 15th-16th centuries there were few of these, mostly of Northern Russian origin. For example, the merchants Kalinnikovs, who founded the city of Sol Kamskaya in 1430, or the famous Stroganovs. Among the merchant surnames there were many that reflected the “professional specialization” of their bearers. For example, the surname Rybnikov, derived from the word rybnik, that is, “fish merchant.” One can also recall citizen Kuzma Minin, who, as is known, did not belong to the nobility, but had own surname already at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries.\n\nDistribution of surnames among the clergy\n\nThe clergy began to have surnames only from the middle of the 18th century. Usually they were formed from the names of parishes and churches (Preobrazhensky, Nikolsky, Pokrovsky, Blagoveshchensky, Rozhdestvensky, Uspensky, Kosmodemyansky, etc.). Before this, priests were usually called Father Alexander, Father Vasily, Father or Father Ivan, without any surname being implied. Their children, if necessary, often received the surname Popov.\n\nSome clergy acquired surnames upon graduation from the seminary: Athensky, Dukhososhestvensky, Palmin, Kiparisov, Reformatsky, Pavsky, Golubinsky, Klyuchevsky, Tikhomirov, Myagkov, Liperovsky (from a Greek root meaning “sad”), Gilyarovsky (from a Latin root meaning “cheerful”) \"). Wherein best students surnames were given that were the most euphonious and had a purely positive meaning, in Russian or Latin: Brilliantov, Dobromyslov, Benemansky, Speransky (Russian analogue: Nadezhdin), Benevolensky (Russian analogue: Dobrovolsky), Dobrolyubov, etc.; on the contrary, bad students were given dissonant surnames, for example Gibraltar, or derived from the names of negative biblical characters (Saul, Pharaoh).\n\nDistribution of surnames among the peasantry\n\nAs practice reveals, even among persons born in a legal marriage, there are many people who do not have surnames, that is, bearing so-called patronymic surnames, which causes significant misunderstandings and even sometimes abuses... To be called by a certain surname is not only a right, but it is also the duty of every full-fledged person, and the designation of the surname on some documents is required by law itself.\n\nIn central Russia, among the peasantry, surnames until the 19th century. were relatively rare. However, we can recall individual examples - the famous Ivan Susanin, who lived in the 16th-17th centuries. In addition, the names of some peasants are known - participants in certain wars, campaigns, defenses of cities or monasteries and other historical disasters. However, indeed, until the 19th century. The surnames were not widespread among the peasants of Central Russia. But this is rather due to the fact that in those days there was no need for a complete mention of all peasants, and there are no documents in which peasants were mentioned without exception or in the majority. And for the official document circulation of those years, if a peasant was mentioned in it, it was usually quite enough to mention the village in which he lived, the landowner to whom he belonged, and his personal name, sometimes along with his profession. The majority of peasants in central Russia were officially given surnames, recorded in documents only after the abolition of serfdom in 1861.\n\nSome surnames were formed from the surnames of landowners. Some peasants were given the full or changed surname of their former owner, the landowner - this is how entire villages of the Polivanovs, Gagarins, Vorontsovs, Lvovkins, etc. appeared.\n\nAt the root of some surnames were the names of settlements (villages, hamlets) from which these peasants came. Mostly these are surnames ending in -skikh. Brynsky, Lebedevsky, Uspensky\n\nHowever, most surnames are family nicknames in origin. Which, in turn, came from the “street” nickname of one or another family member. For the majority of peasants, this very “street” nickname was written down in the document, of which another family could have more than one. Nicknames appeared much earlier than universal family names. These same family nicknames, sometimes with roots going back many generations, actually served as surnames among the peasants of Central Russia - in everyday life, even before they were universally consolidated. They were the first to be included in the census forms, and in fact, family registration was simply the recording of these nicknames in documents. Thus, giving a peasant a surname often came down simply to official recognition, legitimization, and assignment of family or personal nicknames to their bearers. This explains the fact that in the era before the mass allocation of surnames to the peasants of Central Russia, we still know individual names and surnames of the peasants who took part in certain important events. When it became necessary to mention a peasant in a chronicle or in a narration about some event in which he was a participant, the corresponding nickname was simply indicated as his surname - his own, or his family's. And then, during the general assignment of surnames to the peasants of Central Russia, which occurred after the abolition of serfdom, these same nicknames were, for the most part, officially recognized and assigned.\n\nWorldly surnames were formed on the basis of the worldly name. Worldly names came from pagan times, when church names did not yet exist or were not accepted into common people. After all, Christianity did not immediately captivate the minds, much less the souls, of the Slavs. Old traditions were preserved for a long time, the covenants of ancestors were revered sacredly. Every family remembered the names of their ancestors up to the 7th generation and even deeper. Legends from the history of the family were passed down from generation to generation. Cautionary stories the past deeds of the ancestors were told at night to the young successors of the family. Many of the worldly ones were proper names (Gorazd, Zhdan, Lyubim), others arose as nicknames, but then became names (Nekras, Dur, Chertan, Zloba, Neustroy). It should be noted here that in the ancient Russian naming system it was also customary to call babies with protective names, amulets - names with negative content - for protection, scaring away evil forces or for the reverse effect of the name. This is how it is still customary to scold those taking an exam, or to wish a hunter “no feather, no feather.” It was believed that Dur would grow up smart, Nekras would grow up handsome, and Hunger would always be well-fed. Protective names then became familiar nicknames, and then surnames.\n\nFor some, the patronymic was recorded as a surname. The royal decrees on conducting a census usually stated that everyone should be recorded “by first name and nickname,” that is, by first name, patronymic and last name. But in the 17th - first half of the 18th centuries, peasants did not have hereditary surnames at all. The peasant family lived only for one life. For example, Procopius was born into the family of Ivan, and in all metric records he is called Procopius Ivanov. When Vasily was born to Procopius, the newborn became Vasily Prokopyev, and not Ivanov at all\n\nThe first census of 1897 showed that up to 75% of the population did not have a surname (however, this applied more to residents of the national outskirts than of indigenous Russia). Finally, surnames appeared for the entire population of the USSR only in the 30s of the 20th century during the era of universal passportization.\n\nFrequency and list of all-Russian surnames\n\nRussian surnames, as well as surnames created in their image and likeness, are common throughout most of Russia and in many neighboring countries. The ten most common ones look like this (to the right of the last name is the % of the total population of Russia):\n\n1. Smirnov 1.862\n\n2. Ivanov 1.33\n\n3. Kuznetsov 0.998\n\n4. Sokolov 0.856\n\n5. Popov 0.806\n\n6. Lebedev 0.742\n\n7. Kozlov 0.636\n\n8. Novikov 0.61\n\n9. Morozov 0.568\n\n10. Solovyov 0.486\n\nFemale surnames\n\nFrom male Russian surnames in -ov, -ev, -in, inflected according to the paradigm of short possessive adjectives, forms of female surnames with inflection -a are formed, inflected according to the paradigm of short possessive adjectives of the feminine gender (for example, “U Elena Sergeevna Bulgakova”). From surnames starting with -y, -y, -oy, inflected according to the paradigm of full adjectives, forms of female surnames with inflection -aya are formed, inflected according to the paradigm of full feminine adjectives (for example, “at Sofia Vasilievna Kovalevskaya”). For the rest (except for Slavic surnames in -а/я, inflected according to the paradigm of 1st declension nouns) surnames, the feminine form coincides with the masculine form, and is not declined, even if it is declined in the masculine gender (for example, “at Anna Pavlovna Sherer”) .\n\nIn Russian tradition, women usually take their husband's surname when getting married, although since 1918 the law has not required this\n\nFamily secrets\n\nWhat can a surname tell about its owner? Experts in the field of onomastics - the science of names - were able to identify the connection of family secrets not only with the social roots and professional pedigree of the owner, but even with secret societies and religious sects.\n\nRussian, Ukrainian, Tatar, Georgian... - we often note to ourselves, even unconsciously, when meeting a new person and hearing his last name. And we are rarely mistaken, because the surname, as a rule, primarily indicates a person’s nationality. But to a specialist, the surname says much more - both about the person himself and about the people from which he came. It is not for nothing that an entire science is engaged in this - onomastics, and in particular its section - anthroponymy.\n\nToday it has become fashionable to be interested in your ancestors. And this is gratifying: from Ivanov, who do not remember kinship, we are turning into normal people who do not think according to the templates established by official ideologists, but who try to understand the world in all its diversity, striving to understand their place in this world. And knowing your roots helps a lot: “where did I come from” - who your ancestors were, what they did, how they took part in the history of the country. A surname can tell a lot about this.\n\nMost people have no idea how much information their last name carries. First of all, how it was formed in the first place. There is a naive idea drawn from historical novels, the authors of which were not strong in onomastics, that the surnames were formed either by the name of the father: Peter, Ivanov’s son, hence Ivanov, or by profession: Stepan, Kuznetsov’s son, here’s Kuznetsov. And this supposedly happened in the era of Peter I, when the reformer Tsar, following the example of his Western neighbors, ordered to be written “with the fatherland,” thus making room for another word that defines a person.\n\nNothing like that,” says Professor, Doctor of Philology Alexandra Superanskaya, leading researcher at the Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. - Surnames in Rus' took shape already in the 15th century, and trends towards their formation appeared from the very beginning of our written history. In the oldest Russian chronicles, people are called by name and patronymic. In general, in the old days, the first name, patronymic and last name had much higher value than today - they determined a person’s place in society.\n\nTrue, the word “surname” itself appeared only in the 19th century; it was not used before. And in ancient times it was necessary to call people by their names “from their fathers and nicknames.” To modern ears this sounded somewhat strange. For example, Pushkar Ivan Maksimov Belyakov - this is how it is designated in one ancient document, where the person’s profession comes first, indicating his place in society, which was considered the most important characteristic. And then Ivan is his name, Maksimov is the name of his father, and Belyakov is the family nickname for the head of the family. Or by the founder of the family. From a modern point of view, it seems that he has two surnames - Maksimov and Belyakov; they are the same in form, but have different functions. The last word meant that his great-grandfather, or even great-great-grandfather, was called Belyak.\n\nBut this nickname itself has undergone a number of changes. When surnames arose, in Rus', in addition to Christian ones, there were also ancient Russian names that were given to children before baptism. Moreover, they often adhered to, so to speak, thematic selection. The chronicles have brought to us many funny combinations. Let's say in one family a child was named Peas, Cabbage, Radish. And if there was nothing else about him in the chronicle, it would be difficult to determine his gender by name. In another family - Yagnysh Baranov, son of Ovtsyn. This meant that he had three generations in his family and they were all called by different names for sheep. There was also such a name: Pie Oladiev Blinov. Again, by the names that were borne by three generations of the family and which indicate a profession passed on from father to son, which was common in those days. And this happened in the 15th and even 16th centuries. But let’s not forget that in addition to this, people also had godnames. So, according to the documents, the full name sounded like this: Mikhail Yagnysh Baranov - son of Ovtsyn. The last name, as one might assume, eventually became a surname.\n\nToday, many people try to identify the social status of their ancestors by their last name,” says Alexandra Vasilyevna. - Were they nobles, which is what I most want, or philistines, or even, God forbid, serfs. This cannot always be determined. In ancient times, not only this was put at the forefront, surnames carried a wider range of information. There were many different ways to define identity. Up to seven types of naming were used. Some by place of residence, some by father, grandfather, great-grandfather, some by profession - everything depended on how the person was assessed in society and what was more important. So, once in Novgorod they expelled a service man and invited another to the same position only because the first had a “bad” patronymic: he was the son of an unworthy father. And that means from a family that cannot be trusted.\n\nA special place is occupied by the so-called “secret” surnames, denoting concepts familiar only to a narrow circle of people. They arose in certain communities whose members preferred not to disclose the details of their lives. No, we are not talking about criminal structures. But there were people united by a common name - Ofeni. Small traders or artisans. And they took surnames that were completely incomprehensible to the ear, but for the initiates they denoted the secrets of their craft. Some Zhurin is walking on the ground. The surname is like a surname, and only a few know that he makes certain products that “his” people will sell. His descendants were engaged in a completely different business, but the surname remained, the meaning of which is no longer clear to them.\n\nOnomastics destroys many traditional ideas. Remember famous phrase tanker, brilliantly played by Oleg Efremov: “The whole of Russia rests on my name”? And the last name was Ivanov. It was believed that there were more Ivanovs in Rus' than anyone else. There was even a saying: “In Rus', Ivanov is like filthy mushrooms.” But as my interlocutor explained, the popularity of the name “Ivan” increased only during the 19th century, at the end of which a quarter of the male population bore this name. This is easily explained: the church honors this name in the list of saints 64 times a year, and names were given according to the calendar. But this is the name, but the surname “Ivanov” is far from the most common. The most popular is Kuznetsov. This is understandable: the blacksmith in every village was the most necessary and respected person. Therefore, from the western regions came the Kovalevs (from “Koval” - blacksmith), and from the southern Slavs - Kovach, with the same meaning. And not only the “main” surname, but also its numerous derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are a special matter. Many of those who try to determine the social status of their ancestors by their last name do not suspect that the ancestors themselves made their search pointless. They changed the Christian name in their own way when communicating in everyday life, and it eventually became a surname. Scientists call these unofficial variants. For example, a boy Petya grew up in the family, whom his mother affectionately called Petrunya. And the neighbors are used to calling it that. Or they stuck on a nickname like that, as was the custom. And he himself no longer called himself anything else and went by Petrunya until his old age, and his son Ivan was written down in the documents: “Ivan Petrunin’s son.” And walked on the ground new surname- Petrunin. This is just one of the options, and there are many of them. Petrushin, Petryaev, Pityaev, Petin, Petenkin, Petishchev, Petrishchev, this is still an incomplete list. The same goes for other names - the people's imagination is inexhaustible. In our conversation, Alexandra Superanskaya listed so many variants of the most common names that people in her family or village were called that there was simply not enough space for them in the newspaper.\n\nWhen they want to emphasize the large number of people involved in some business, says Alexandra Vasilyevna, they usually list: Ivanov, Petrov, Sidorov. And this is also a mistake. Because if there are really many Ivanovs and Petrovs, then there are very few Sidorovs. Both this name and surname are not common in Rus'. Sidor's goat is mentioned much more often, although where this expression came from is unknown. So Sidor is not a friend of Ivan and Peter, and how he got into this proverb is still a mystery to researchers.\n\nBut the situation has become transparent when families living in the same village have the same surnames, although they are not relatives. The whole point is that when Soviet power the village lived for a long time without passports. In fact, they were in the position of serfs who could not go anywhere without an identity document. Certification of the village began only under Khrushchev, and ended in the 70s. And it turned out that many families simply “lost” their surnames. They got by with nicknames that their neighbors gave them or they were simply called by their place of settlement. Let's say several families lived behind a dam, and when they were certified, they all became Zaprudskys. They lived at the end of the village - Konechnye. On the shore of the pond - Beregovye. This is such an offensive situation when surnames do not reflect family roots.\n\nEven worse incidents happened precisely because the peasants “lost” their surnames. When the guys were drafted into the army, they used to get confused when filling out the documents. You didn’t know what last name to give, you can’t give it a nickname. And then joining the regiment was simple: they called the surname by the name of where the father was, and where the grandfather was. And returning from the army, siblings found themselves with different surnames, which sometimes led to misunderstandings. However, in those days when a person was considered a cog in a common machine, this was rarely paid attention to.\n\nBut there are not very many of them. There are many more ancestral surnames, from our ancestors. And the most common in Rus' are Kuznetsovs, Popovs, Ivanovs, Smirnovs. They divided four zones among themselves - historically separate territories. The Kuznetsovs have the largest distribution area - from Tula, where they are most numerous, to Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. \"Ivanovia\" is the north-west - Pskov, Novgorod, adjacent lands. \"Popovia\" - the North, especially the Arkhangelsk region. \"Smirnovia\" - the center and northern Volga region - Yaroslavl, Vladimir and other regions from Tver to Nizhny Novgorod. And the borders of these four zones collide on Tula and Ryazan land.\n\nWe are of the same blood - you and me\n\nIt is no coincidence that back in early middle ages there was interest in family tree- identifying people related to your family by related ties to one degree or another.\n\nLet them have different nationalities, let fate scatter them around different countries and continents, a scrupulous analysis of surnames, which often change in marriages of different generations, sometimes gives surprising discoveries that one can often be proud of.\n\nAll people are brothers, says the Bible, all descended from one root. Mathematics partially confirms this. In fact, two parents, four grandparents, and eight great-grandparents took part in your birth. A simple calculation shows that 200 - 250 years ago there were already more than a thousand of your direct ancestors, and 400 - 500 years ago - more than one million. And if we assume that each family had only two children, then somewhere on earth there are at least a million of your blood relatives walking around. So suddenly you are related to the French king and can lay claim to the throne. Do not know? But in the old days, when compiling a family tree, such an opportunity would not have been missed.\n\nIt is known that relatives were Schelling, Hegel, Schiller and Max Planck - after a common ancestor, Johann Vanth, who lived in the 15th century. Karl Marx and Heinrich Heine had a common ancestor. And Karl Liebknecht is a descendant of Martin Luther through the female line. So the violent revolutionary blood was passed on to him by inheritance. Just as the famous English Prime Minister Winston Churchill received, on the one hand, the blood of the famous pirate Francis Drake, and on the other, the blood of the Duke of Marlborough, about whom they composed the song “Malbroke is about to go on a campaign.”\n\nBelinsky's great-niece was Plekhanov's mother, and Plekhanov's half-sister later became the mother of the organizer of Soviet healthcare N. Semashko. The historian Soloviev was Alexander Blok’s second cousin, and Blok’s mother was related to the Aksakovs and Karamzin, not to mention the fact that she was Mendeleev’s daughter. Miklouho-Maclay was distantly related to Mickiewicz and Goethe, and Marshal Tukhachevsky, through the Arsenyevs, was related to Lermontov. The poet Nikolai Klyuev was a direct descendant of the rebellious archpriest Avvakum.\n\nPushkin and Leo Tolstoy had a common great-great-great-grandfather, Admiral Golovin. Pushkin and the poet Venevitinov were fourth cousins, and through his children Alexander Sergeevich became related to Gogol, the Benkendorfs and the imperial family.\n\nA person’s name is the first thing that identifies him and distinguishes him from others. Many people are now getting carried away different interpretations certain personal data, and the name is one of the first places here. There are even specialists who predict a person’s fate, character, and personal qualities by name. Therefore, it becomes very interesting how names appeared, what they were like at the very beginning, and how they transformed over time.\n\nAncient names\n\nIn the earliest ancient society When a person realized that it was easier to live together, the need arose from this “together” to call for one thing. It was not always possible to come up and knock on the back, but the vocal abilities were successfully developing. That's how I learned primitive call with the voice of your comrade, not the whole tribe, mind you, but one. And at this stage it was necessary to decide how to make it clear who exactly was being called. It turned out that everything is very simple. The man called words everything that was around him, and at the same time his comrades. The sun is Ra, which means the red-haired man in the tribe is also Ra. Water drips from the sky from a cloud - Give, so does the person whose eyes are always wet - Give. Everything was very simple, but we are wondering where the names came from!\n\nNames of the first civilizations\n\nDuring the birth of civilizations, the attitude towards name formation completely changed. Parents gave the child a name consonant with the qualities that they would like to see in their child. Vladimir rules the world, Svyatoslav glorifies the saints. These are Russian variants of names. In Europe and on other continents the same thing happened, only in other languages. In Greek, Alexander means conqueror, Paul means small, and Helen means bright. These names have come down to us, having undergone some minor transformations in sound, from the most ancient times, from the very birth of cultural civilizations.\n\nPagan names of the peoples of the world\n\nMany nationalities came up with names for their children with meaning, hoping that the meaning inherent in the name would help the child throughout life. For example, do you want to know how the name Kizlyarbas appeared? It literally translates as “no more girls,” and was given by fathers to long-awaited boys born into Tajik families. The Semitic name Nebu-bulit means “Oh Heaven, give me life!” telling name. But the girl named Dzedumilla was supposed to be sweet to her grandfather all her life.\n\nThe pagans also named children after some animal, so that the child would be similar in strength and dexterity to it. For example, the wolf, revered in many nations, gave the world many names derived from this word: Vuk, Vilk, Wolf, Lupul, Vovk, Wolfgang, Vilkolaz. And these are only European derivatives!\n\nModern names in Russia\n\nFortunately, the times have passed when in Russia, paying tribute to fashion, they called children completely unthinkable names! In the 40-50s of the last century it was very popular male name Mels (Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin). And what are Electrification, Oktyabrina, Cosmos, Iskra, Academy, Antenna, Vladlena (Vladimir Lenin) worth? And there were a huge number of such names. All this was a tribute to the times, no one puzzled over the question of why the names appeared, what should they mean? A blunder, and the name is ready. Then native Russian names and even non-Russian names began to return. But they were all really names, and not abbreviations invented for the topic of the day.\n\nEvery person has a name. Linguists call people's personal names anthroponyms. A Russian person, in addition, has a patronymic and a surname. Calling each other by name and patronymic, we cannot even imagine that it is possible to call other adults by any other name. However, in many countries there is no patronymic as a special type of naming. In most Western countries, people, regardless of age, call each other simply by their first name, and in more formal cases, by their last name, preceded by the words you senor, señora, sir, madam, etc. Many peoples of the East do not have surnames. On special occasions, long phrases are used, including not only a personal name, but also nicknames that characterize a person, and words such as boy, youth, man, old man, uncle, aunt, grandfather, mother, father, the name of the family to which this person belongs, the names of his relatives, the name of the area from which he comes.\n\nRussians, as a rule, receive one name at birth. It is very rare for a Russian person to have two names. In many Western countries, a child is given two or three names, for example, Jose Raul. Initially, this was dictated by the desire for him to have not one, but several patron saints. Then it became a tradition. Most often, children in Spanish-speaking countries are named after relatives, usually grandparents. In addition to the name received from their parents, Spaniards have names received at baptism from the baptizing priest and godparents. Most of the names received by the Spaniard are not used, but only one or two names are used, for example, the current king of Spain has five personal names - Juan Carlos Alfonso Maria Victor, but all his life he uses only two of them - Juan Carlos. This is a common case.\n\nIn some countries, in Spain and Portugal, tradition requires that a person have not one, but several surnames. Here the father's surname is recorded as the first surname, and the mother's surname as the second. Many people add their grandfather’s surname as a third name. Some use the surname of a grandmother or another grandfather as the fourth, etc.\n\nOrigin of proper names\n\nEvery person lives somewhere, and whether it is a city or a village, a mountain or a river, any point on the earth’s surface, if it is notable in any way, has its own name. Linguists call the names of cities, rivers, lakes, and localities toponyms. Where, how and why came from geographical names- a question no less interesting than the problems associated with the origin of names and surnames. There are more than 250 places on the globe called Switzerland. This is explained by the fashion for this proper name. If an area in any way resembled European Switzerland, it received this name. Today there is Switzerland in Europe, and it is also in New Zealand.\n\nIn my everyday cognitive activity a person constantly discovers, creates, constructs something new. These can be new lands, new qualities and properties of previously known things, machines, mechanisms, parts, devices. Every day children are born, new people who will eventually take their place in life and begin to create and create. And everything new needs names. And they are created every day: common nouns - to designate classes of objects, proper names for each individual individual object. In the 20th century there appeared common nouns computer, cybernetics, space, etc. These concepts are associated with the development of science and technology, the emergence of new branches of knowledge. The name of the city near Moscow where the cosmonauts live is Zvezdny. Given name its own comes from the word star and people live here, striving for the stars.\n\nDevelopment information technologies led to the formation of new common nouns. Today, a new category of proper names is emerging, which may include such names as Internet, Yandex, Runet. What other similar names can be considered proper names? What are their signs? I believe that if they are written in Russian with capital letters, there is reason to classify them as proper names.\n\nProper names and common nouns are full-fledged words of each specific language, but common nouns serve us with their meaning, and proper names serve us with their sound. I would like to suggest that proper names have always existed, because it is impossible to imagine a language in which there would be no proper names. Scientists believe that they have existed since man began to recognize himself as a human being and use language as a means of communication. He began to give nicknames to pets, name rivers, lakes, and the area in which he lives. In ancient times, deities, heroes of fairy tales, tales, and epics received their names.\n\nWe can ask the question, what came first, proper names or common nouns? Perhaps they were created simultaneously, borrowing linguistic material from each other. Here it is necessary to note the complexity and originality of the transition of common nouns into proper ones, so it is often difficult to determine when and from what word a particular name originated. For example, the Russian surname Sundukov comes from the word chest. But between the chest - household utensils and the surname Chests - there are a number of intermediate forms. The word chest itself is borrowed from Turkic languages. But the surname Sundukov cannot be considered Tatar or Nogai, because the entire path from word to surname was carried out according to the norms of the Russian language. First of all, the word chest became the name or nickname of a person - Chest, and only then a full surname. Why this happened is difficult to say.\n\nIt is even more difficult to judge the origin of traditional Russian names. After all, almost all of them came to us from Byzantium along with Christianity. They were included in calendars, dedicated to certain days of the year and were called calendar ones. All of them are very ancient and served as names long before their arrival in the Russian language.\n\nIt is important to note that having separated from a common noun and becoming a proper name, the name develops regardless of the meaning of those elements that form the meaning of the common noun. For example, we put the surname Bryullov in a row not with Eskin, Morkovkin, but with the surnames of artists Levitan, Repin, Petrov-Vodkin, Vasnetsov; the name of the German philosopher Fichte - in a row with the names of Feuerbach, Kant.\n\nI think there are a number of universal factors that people have turned to and continue to turn to when creating names. First of all, then appearance, image of a person. Compare Old Russian names Big, Long, Baby, Fat, Skinny, Greek Plato, Latin Longinus. Character traits influence: Old Russian names Kind, Generous, Stingy and Arabic Rahman. When naming people in all eras, they turned to the names of animals, although the reasons for this were different.\n\nIn certain eras, representatives of different nations develop unique traditions associated with names. For example, in one historical periods there was a tradition of naming a person after low-value items “from the evil eye” in order to protect the child from damage. At other stages of development, societies turned to complex, pompous names to glorify a person through his name. There is a fashion for names.\n\nThe desire to ennoble one's name and surname was noted among many peoples. An interesting fact is given in the book by A.V. Superanskaya. The first Russian herald, Kolychev, whose family descended from a man named Kobyla, complained that the scribes allegedly distorted the name of his ancestor, who was actually called Kampila and came to the royal service from foreign lands.\n\nOur names are unique and amazing signs that help to highlight each living creature individually. They serve us with their sound, not common noun the words from which they were once created. It is especially important to emphasize the legal significance of proper names and the need to write them uniformly in all documents, maps, and books.\n\nThe English love to repeat the phrase: “What’s in a name?” What is really in your name and mine? What's in a city or street name? What's in the name of a ship and a planet? The answers to these questions are given by onomastics - the science of proper names. She studies the formation, development, distribution of names, the features of their borrowing into other languages, their amazing transformations in new historical and cultural conditions."
