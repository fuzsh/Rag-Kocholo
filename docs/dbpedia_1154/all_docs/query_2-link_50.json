Kharkiv writers are not employing their full resources and talent to comment on vital political events in the life of the Soviet Union.\" In addition to Sylaev and Ivanenko, speakers at the meeting included D. Vyshnevs'kyy, I. Shutov, D. Sokolov, B. Kotlyarov, Z. Kats, I. Bahmut and I.

Yakovlev discussed the \"extra- historical and extra-class appoach to problems of ethics and literature\". While Yakovlev concentrated on examples from Russian literature, the present discussion - in which P. Mysyk, D. Pavlychko, Ye. Budnytska, V. Blyznets, A. Lysenko participated - focused on ideological shortcomings of such Ukrainian novels as Posol Urus-Shaytana by V. Malyk, Mech Areia by I. Bilyk and Smert' v Kyievi by P. Zahrebel'nyi.

The speech was titled: \"The urgent tasks of the writers' party organization for fulfilling the decisions of the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\" Malanchuk mentions by name and title a number of recent literary works which, in his view, \"attest to the mature artistic level and social significance\" of contemporary Ukrainian literature in which the \"Leninist theme, the theme of patriotism and proletarian internationalism, of the friendship of the peoples of the USSR, of the heroism of labor and struggle, resounds with great intensity...\" But he also calls attention to what he considers serious flows. \"In poetry we notice a certain degree of alienation from the real world of our contemporary, a concentration on local phenomena, on highly private experiences.\" He castigates \"...an unhealthy tendency to litter the language with obsolete words and dialecticisms, with wholly artificial expressions\", with a \"wide use of various archaisms, Polonisms, Galicisms...\" \"Our critics\", says Malanchuk, \"are insufficiently active in analyzing and evaluating the contemporary literary process...\"\n\nA013. \"Always with the Party and the people.

[Excerpts. Ukrainian original in Radians'ka Ukraina. (24 March 1967): 2-4].\n\n\"Certain works published in recent issues of our journals,\" says the unsigned article, \"are characterized by muddled ideological beliefs, a weakening in the tautness of public and social thought, substitution of indisputable, time-tested truths with homespun 'philosophy'. Even gifted poets occasionally decide to treat human life in pseudo-profound formulations.\" As examples, the article cites B. Oliinyk's poem \"Doroha\" (Dnipro, 1, 1967), the sketch \"Hordynia\" by Ia. Stupak (Vitchyzna) and the cycle \"Z abetky sertsia\" by L. and O. Berdnyk (Dnipro, 11, 1966). Editors of Dnipro and Vitchyzna are criticized for having published these works. The Digest supplied title reads: \"Writers told to get back on socialist realism track.\"\n\nA028.

[Katsnel'son's name is misspelled and appears in the Digest as \"Katselson\"].

Abram Katsnel'son quotes V. Malanchuk, secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, who criticized Ukrainian poetry for its \"alienation from the real world\" and agrees that some works \"are flawed by the pernicious influence of modernistic poetics, which, along with the propaganda of political indifference, of the extra-class and extra- temporal nature of poetry, our enemies strive to propagate using any means at their command...\" The title supplied by the Digest reads: \"Young poets criticized for modernistic experimentations.\"\n\nA031. \"Ayzenshtok, Ieremiya Yakovlevich\". Prominent Personalities in the USSR. (1968). 45.\n\nThirty-two lines of bio-bibliographical data about the Russian and Ukrainian literary critic Iarema Aizenshtok (b.1900).\n\nA032. Babenko, Vickie. \"Official contemporary Ukrainian poetry: mirror of socio-political forces.\" Ukrainian Review (London). 24.4 (Winter 1977): 39-50.\n\n\"Ukrainian literature has been censored more severely than Russian literature,\" says Babenko. \"In fact, Ukrainian writers are subjected to special scrutiny (censorship) so that the mere touching upon political and national questions may lead to persecution and punishment...\" In Babenko's view, \"no Ukrainian writer would be treated as the Russian Yevtushenko or Voznesensky who dared to raise their voices against the goverment, but received no punishment.\" In most official Soviet Ukrainian verse collections, according to Babenko, \"one encounters again and again the standard Soviet themes: praise of the Party, love of the Soviet Union, glorification of Lenin or the heroes of labor and the Great Patriotic War...\" \"Instead of convincing works of art,\" says Babenko, \"the poets are producing trivial and uninspiring pieces of verse.\" Babenko singles out B. Oliinyk, as \"an exceptionally gifted poet\" who manages to \"write on Ukrainian themes without provoking strong criticism from the official side.\" All quotations of poetry in this article are in the original, without English translations of any kind.\n\nA033. Babenko, Vickie. \"Themes of Boris Olijnyk - a contemporary Ukrainian poet.\" Ukrainian Review (London). 21[sic].3 (Autumn 1975): 72-82.\n\nThe article discusses \"the artistry\" of Borys Oliinyk's poetry, but does so on the basis not of his original poetry, but of the poetry's Russian translations which are quoted at length by the author. Babenko stresses the universal and patriotic themes in Oliinyk's work and concludes that Oliinyk's \"urge for rediscovering the Ukrainian national identity is intense, and his patriotic feelings occupy a central place in his works.\"\n\nA034. Babyshkin, Oleh. \"He belongs to mankind.\" Digest of the Soviet Ukrainian Press. 18.10 (October 1974): 17-18. [Excerpts. Ukrainian original in Literaturna Ukraina. (10 September 1974): 2].\n\nAn attempt to trace the early influences on O. Dovzhenko, the young artist-caricaturist. According to Babyshkin, in 1925 Iurii Ianovs'kyi left Kharkiv to become artistic director of the Odessa film studio. Dovzhenko followed his friend Ianovs'kyi and worked with him for a year. \"The presence of Yanovs'kyy, already accustomed to the life and work of the film factory, helped to bring Dovzhenko quickly into the world of filmmaking.\" This piece is one of two articles published under the Digest supplied heading: \"Mark Dovzhenko anniversary\". See also A616.\n\nA035. Badz'o, Iurii. \"The right to life.\" / Yuriy Badzyo. Ukrainian Review (London). 27 [sic, i.e. 26].4 (Winter 1979): 13-20.\n\nA letter written in 1977 and originally addressed to the \"Supreme Soviet of the USSR, foreign Communist parties and democratic citizens of the world\" grew eventually, according to the author, \"into a scholarly research project dealing with various aspects of national life in Ukraine.\" Badz'o concludes that \"the chauvinist policy\" of the Communist Party \"has denied the Ukrainian nation its right to life.\" An editorial note identifies Badz'o as a journalist and literary scholar.\n\nA036. \"Bagmut, Ivan Andrianovich\".

Bahrij Pikulyk, Romana. \"The expressionist experiment in Berezil': Kurbas and Kulish.\" Canadian Slavonic Papers. 14.2 (Summer 1972): 324-344.\n\nThe central theme of dramatic expressionism, according to the author, is \"the alienation of man from other men and a sense of futility when confronted not only with other men in society but with the whole meaningless environment represented primarily by the big city and the machine.\" \"All the factors that contributed to the spiritual crisis at the turn of the century left man with a total absence of absolute values,\" says Bahrij Pikulyk. She divides expressionist drama and expressionistic stage productions into surrealist and cubist expressionism. Surrealist expressionism, in her view, is \"subjective, dreamlike, visionary\", while cubist expressionism is \"object-centered, intellectual and linguistically experimental.\" Kurbas, together with Kaiser and Meyerhold, according to the author, belonged to the cubist branch and \"tended to use constructivist stage settings, the introductiuon of many planes for a maximum of simultaneity and the actual introduction of film sequences into the theatre.\" Bahrij Pikulyk discusses at some length the stagings by Kurbas of two plays \"Jimmie Higgins\" (based on a novel by Upton Sinclair) and \"Narodnyi Malakhii\" (The People's Malakhii) by Mykola Kulish and concludes that \"the expressionist experiment in Berezil was a very successful one.\" A French summary of the article is on p.344.\n\nA039.

According to the abstract, the dissertation analyzes two novels - Gogol's Taras Bulba and Panteleimon Kulish's The Black Council \"from the point of view of Sir Walter Scott's historical novel pattern\". \"This pattern,\" says the author, \"consists of a fictional mediocre protagonist, the center of the fictional narrative; he is placed within an historical framework in which there are actual historical events and characters, a detailed description of manners, and a conflict between an old and new culture.\" The extent of the dissertation not indicated, no order no. provided.\n\nA040. \"Ban on Shevchenko's Testament song.\" Ukrainian Review (London). 14.3 (Autumn 1987): 95-96.\n\nA news item about the prohibition by police of the singing of Zapovit at the end of a memorial Shevchenko celebration in Kolomyia in March of 1987.\n\nA041. \"Bar Shevchenko monument in Australian capital.\" Ukrainian Quarterly. 29.4 (Winter 1973): 439.\n\nAccording to this note in the \"Chronicle of current events\", the main obstacle to Ukrainian community efforts to erect a statue in honor of Taras Shevchenko in Canberra is an Australian law which bars erection of monuments in the capital except \"in honor of Australian heroes and persons of national prominence\".\n\nA042. \"The Bard of freedom and fraternity\" / RATAU.

While the quantity of such publications he considers \"truly gratifying\", he raises questions \"concerning the quality and effectiveness\" of some of these works. Says Bazhan: \"Frequently there appear raw, careless translations, done without deep contemplation of the original.

In 1964 she and Jean-Paul Sartre were invited to Kyiv for the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Shevchenko's birth.

In her recollections, de Beauvoir recalls an anti- semitic conversation in Moscow, at the hotel Sovietskaya, and comments on anti-semitic passages in a Ukrainian book about Balzac [she does not name the author, but it is, obviously, Natan Rybak, the author of Pomylka Onore de Bal'zaka]. There are favorable comments about conversations with Bazhan and Korniichuk, as well as reflections on Shevchenko.

The author sides with scholars, such as A. Šachmatov, Tschiževskij and G.P. Fedotov, who consider Nestor's story a valuable work of art. \"Despite the fact that Nestor has furnished the biography proper with a frame consisting of an exordium and a conclusio,\" says Börtnes, \"scholars have hitherto mainly been concerned with the life in its more restricted sense when trying to reach an aesthetic evaluation of Nestor's story.\" But the framework, according to Börtnes, \"is in fact indispensable for a proper interpretation, showing as it does that Nestor had a very clear idea of how to compose the biography of a saint. The Life of St. Theodosius is no collection of unconnected anecdotes from the saint's life, but a literary composition patterned on traditional models.\"\n\nA123.

Russian scholar V.O. Ključevskij came to the conclusion that the Lives have no documentary value and cannot be used as sources for history. But \"The hagiographer's 'slovo', his discourse, does not refer directly to objective, historical events. It's signification is created by the interplay of the narrative and the rhetorical system within the text,\" says Börtnes. \"Contrary to widespread opinion, this text is no arbitrary collection of unconnected anecdotes from a saint's life, but an entity, in which the biography proper is inscribed within a frame consisting of an exordium and a conclusio. In composing this frame, the hagiographer followed a rigidly established tradition,\" says Börtnes. In his view, \"The hagiographical process aims at the suspension of the opposition between narration and quotation, in order to create a discourse in which these different modes of enunciation function together.\" The author analyzes the relation between narration and quotation in the childhood sequence of Nestor's Life of St. Theodosius.

He claims that \"internal monologue\" for the discovery of which Joyce is given credit, \"was used much earlier in Russian literature by Dostoyevsky and L. Tolstoy, as well as in Ukrainian, by Kotsyubyns'kyy, Franko and others.\" \"On what basis do certain other scholars consider R.

Young writers works on industrial themes, says Buriak, are characterized by descriptiveness, illustrativeness and repetition. In some cases, they seem to be \"an inferior limitation of the 'production' novel...\" apparently 'transplanted from the 1930's. The fact that young writers avoid longer prose works, says Buriak, attracts the attention of \"nationalistic researchers\" abroad. Buriak cites Pelenski [Pelenskyy] [cf.

From a literary and dramatic standpoint, this was the most successful of Korneychuk's works.\" The author finds Korniichuk's speech at the Second Writers' Congress of the USSR in 1954 which has elements of cautious criticism and self-criticism, \"a most intriguing document\". In 1954, says Bushman, Korniichuk and his wife Wanda Wasilewska, who wrote in Polish, \"were held up as examples of artists who were attentive to social criticism and who corrected their major defects.\" Korniichuk's 1954 play \"Kryla\" portrayed, says Bushman, \"a new type of leader\" \"whose character had much in common with that of Khrushchev.\" Korniichuk was awarded three Lenin prizes and numerous other honors. In 1961 he was elected a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The article provides 32 lines of bibliographical sources and Korniichuk's address which is given as Verkhovnyi Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nA154.

The 1957 publication of the novel Krov liuds'ka - ne vodytsia, says Bushman, \"brought Stelmakh wide renown. This novel, about the establishment of Soviet rule in the Ukraine, won Khrushchev's personal approval.\" About Pravda i kryvda / Marko Bezsmertnyi (1962) Bushman says: \"The novel is an interesting blend of realism and folklore fairy-tale elements, and is aimed against the personality cult. The novel's fame was further increased by the author's stage adaptation.\" Bushman provides the following characteristics of Stel'makh and his style: \"Stelmakh's prose is lyrical, wide-ranging and closely linked with the folklore tradition. Stelmakh writes intensively in irregular bouts. His scripts are always handwritten, since he cannot bear to hear the sound of the typewriter. Although he frequently stresses how essential it is for a writer to maintain a notebook, his own notebook is a most sporadic affair. He sits down to write with a ready-made plan, which he only seldom alters. Stelmakh considers that the ideas a writer preaches should jibe fully with his personal life.\" The article gives also 12 lines of bibliographical sources and an address for Stel'makh at the headquarters of the Writers' Union of Ukraine (Kyiv, Ordzonikidze 2).\n\nA155.

Tolstoi invited her to participate in his pedagogical journal Iasnaia poliana, but no contributions by Marko Vovchok ever appeared in that publication. Among some possible reasons for this Buyniak points out Vovchok's much more revolutionary social and feminist attitudes which might have conflicted with Tolstoi's pacifist philosophy.

The message of the story, according to Challis and Dewey, is as follows: \"Divine folly is valued above solitary asceticism; jurodstvo can help \"cure\" a monk who has succumbed to prelest while a hermit.

Chelak goes as far as to claim that Skovoroda \"laid the foundation of atheism in Ukraine in the materialist and atheistic tendencies of his philosophy.\" The Digest's title: \"Emigré writers accused of distorting Skovoroda\".\n\nA174. \"Chendrey [sic], Ivan Mikhaylovich.\" Prominent Personalities in the USSR.

A1469, T036]. Chernenko takes issue with some of Struk's statements, \"corrects\" some parts of his translation of the poem, and proposes her own interpretation of Chubai's work. According to Chernenko, \"the spiritual flavour of Chubai's poem can be found in Hryhorii S. Skovoroda's mystical philosophy.\" In Chernenko's view, \"Chubai's poem gives an image of human striving for the renewal of psychic wholeness and 'what it is that holds all men together'. This is the main reason why his small and modest poem has such unique value.\" While it may be \"impossible to explain in detail the whole poem in a rational or logical way,\" says Chernenko, \"...one can use a comparative method based on Jung's empirical findings about the human psyche and Skovoroda's mystical philosophy and his symbolism\" to guide the reader \"toward an intuitive perception of the meaning of Chubai's poem.\" She proceeds to do so, by analyzing the Jungian \"uniting symbols of archetypal nature\" present in Chubai's poem. Fragments of Chubai's poem in Struk's translation (some 177 lines) are quoted to illustrate the points made in the article. A French summary of the article appears on p. 98.\n\nA178.
