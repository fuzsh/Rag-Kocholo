It also provides me with the opportunity to thank the people who have shared my enjoyment and facilitated my work along the way. I ﬁrst read Derzhavin while conducting research on my dissertation at the University of Wisconsin. David Bethea, Alexander Dolinin, Judith Kornblatt, Yuri Shcheglov, and Alfred Senn helped me deﬁne Khodasevich’s place within the early-twentieth-century biographical tradition. I returned to Khodasevich over the next few years in articles and lectures, presenting my work both in the United States and internationally. A special thank you goes to Sergei Fomichev and Vladimir Koshelev for bringing my work on Khodasevich to the attention of a Russian-language audience. My ﬁrst book beneﬁted from the enthusiasm of Caryl Emerson, to whom I am immensely grateful. Caryl was supportive of this translation as well and I appreciate her eﬀorts on my behalf. Over the years friends and colleagues have oﬀered assistance and support, and I am pleased to acknowledge them here. David Bethea was there at the beginning, and we had a terriﬁc time exploring the Khodasevich-Pushkin-Derzhavin connection in our collaborative work. I have continued to receive advice and assistance from David long after his commitment to serve as my dissertation adviser ended. Linguistic consultants on the project included Sergei Davydov, Galya Rylkova, and Tatiana Smorodinskaya. Sara Dickinson helped enormously in eighteenth-century matters and gave the manuscript a thorough reading and critique. Graham Hettlinger and Ona Renner-Fahey shared their gifts as talented translators, both prosaic and poetic. Andrew Kahn invested much time and energy in carefully vetting the manuscript. I couldn’t have asked for a more xi\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nknowledgeable or detail-oriented reader, and I remain in his debt. Alexander Levitsky was also supportive of the project and generously oﬀered up his translations of Derzhavin’s poetry, of which I have made liberal use. In January  I was thrilled to ﬁnd myself at a Derzhavin conference during my trip to Saint Petersburg to choose illustrative material for the book. What a treat it was for me to announce its forthcoming publication to an international group of eighteenth-century scholars while standing in the very hall in Derzhavin’s house on the Fontanka where Beseda once met and Krylov once dozed! I want to thank Nina Petrovna Morozova, director of the Museum of Derzhavin and Russian Literary Culture of His Time, for her warm reception.At the Pushkin House (Institute of Russian Literature of the Academy of Sciences) my stalwart friends Sergei Fomichev and Svetlana Ipatova introduced me to all the right people, including the staﬀ of the literary museum, which was very obliging in facilitating my search for illustrations. My heartfelt thanks to Larissa Georgievna Agamalyan, Petr Vasilievich Bekedin, Elena Nikolaevna Monakhova, and Ekaterina Gerasimova. Khodasevich writes about the patronage system under which Derzhavin created his poetry. As a modern academic I, too, have beneﬁted from patronage, though not in the form of diamond-encrusted snuﬀboxes (alas!). My research and reading of Khodasevich’s papers, housed at the Butler Library of Columbia University, was underwritten by the Ohio State Slavic Center.The intellectual leisure I needed to work on the translation was granted by the College of Humanities and the Slavic Department at Ohio State. The college and the department also provided funding to aid in publishing and illustrating this volume. Steve Salemson at the University of Wisconsin Press was a patient and enthusiastic editor, and I am grateful for his commitment to this book. Gwen Walker, Matt Levin, and Adam Mehring also proved very helpful. Both Khodasevich and Derzhavin remained childless, and both searched for poetic “children” to whom they might pass their lyre, heirs to their legacies. My own eﬀorts in this vein are incomparably more humble, as Khodasevich might say, if perhaps more personally rewarding. Work on this book began when my ﬁrst child arrived and continued as we awaited the arrival of the second. If I were a bit less prosaic by nature, I might spin a metaphor of my husband as midwife. Be that as it may, I want to express my thanks to Steve Conn for his love, support, encouragement, and tolerance of my obsessive work habits.To Zachary and Olivia—my beloved, intelligent, and highly amusing children—I dedicate this translation.\n\nNote on the Translation\n\nThroughout this translation I have striven to render Khodasevich’s prose in a readable yet faithful English version of the Russian.This eﬀort has occasionally involved smoothing out syntax and shortening sentences. Russian writers generally—and Khodasevich in particular—are fond of long, complex sentences, sometimes strung together with semicolons, ellipses to indicate a trailing oﬀ of thought, and lots of dashes. In the interest of readability I’ve eliminated most of the semicolons and ellipses and almost all of the dashes. In his own writing Khodasevich mimicked the descriptive style of Pushkin, while maintaining a tone reminiscent of the eighteenth century through his choice of vocabulary and syntax, and, of course, his use of verbatim quotations from Derzhavin and others.Any passages in French, German, and Latin have been retained as they appear in the original, with English translations in the notes. Although Khodasevich did not provide sources for quotations, he did mark some of them (especially the ones from Derzhavin), and I have left those quotation marks in the text. I have retained his habit of italicizing a few words extracted from a document—usually Derzhavin’s autobiography or his own commentaries to his poetry—but I have rendered these with the addition of quotation marks since Russian and other foreign words treated as words are marked with italics in the text. Concerning transliteration, I’ve mostly uused a modiﬁed version of the Library of Congress system, substituting y for i or ii (as in Vyazemsky) and dropping the soft and hard signs. I’ve used both masculine and feminine forms of Russian surnames. Only Peter, Catherine the Great, Paul, and Alexander have been given the names and spellings by which they are best known in English. Among other things, this helps clarify the women in Derzhavin’s life: Catherine was his xiii\n\nxiv\n\nNote on the Translation\n\nempress, while Ekaterina Yakovlevna was his wife. Potemkin retains his usual English spelling, while Pugachov and pugachovshchina (the phenomenon of the Pugachov rebellion) are spelled this way to aid in pronunciation. Polish and other non-Russian personal names are mostly spelled according to accepted usage in their respective languages or based on traditional English equivalents.\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nIn a famous scene from The Great Gatsby Nick Carraway suggests that Gatsby shouldn’t expect too much of Daisy. “You can’t repeat the past,” he says. Gatsby is outraged: “Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!” He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand. “I’m going to ﬁx everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”\n\nHere, in his quintessential modernist novel of , F. Scott Fitzgerald presented his readers with the modernist dilemma: the exhilaration of modern life— in the form of automobiles, advertising, skyscrapers, subways, and movies—confronts nostalgia, the desire to retrieve a past that may never even have existed. Vladislav Khodasevich (–), the author of the present biography of Derzhavin, was another modernist in search of the past, a classically inspired poet who experienced the paradoxical irony of his age.While many early-twentiethcentury modernists celebrated the possibilities of the future, others, like Khodasevich, confronted the future by looking backward. Though surrounded in the twenties by what Robert Hughes has called “the shock of the new,” the cultural and political tumult of a world undergoing a variety of transformations, Khodasevich yearned for older values.At the time of his death in ,Vladimir Nabokov—himself no stranger to the currents of modernism—called him “the greatest Russian poet that the twentieth century has yet produced.” His Derzhavin may well be the ﬁnest literary biography ever written in Russian. ***** xv\n\nxvi\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nA brief review of Khodasevich’s own life seems in order. Poet, essayist, biographer, and memoirist,Vladislav Khodasevich was the embodiment of the cosmopolitan, rootless turn-of-the-century Russian. He was born in Moscow in  of Polish parents, his father being a Polish nobleman and his Jewish mother a converted Catholic. Khodasevich believed that he imbibed Russian together with the milk of his wet nurse—in a sense an adopted language1—and it was the Russian language that gave him his only sense of belonging. He spent his youth in Moscow and studied at Moscow University. In his early twenties he began to publish poems, critical essays, and translations of Polish poetry. During World War I he continued to translate Armenian, Polish, and Jewish poetry for Russian readers. In October  Khodasevich moved to Petrograd to live in a state-run “commune” for writers and artists, the famous DIsk (Dom Iskusstva, or House of Art). Khodasevich liked to say that he fell between poetic schools. Being younger than most symbolists and acmeists, he found the violent world of futurism and its rejection of the past alien, remaining unmoved by revolutionary optimism. The Heavy Lyre () opens with a poem in which Khodasevich claims to have “managed to graft the classical rose to a Soviet wildling,” but the poem glossed over his frustration with Soviet reality. By that time his poetic output was beginning to slow to a trickle. In  Khodasevich left Russia for Europe together with Nina Berberova, his twenty-two-year-old lover, a beautiful and fascinating young woman—also an aspiring writer—who was to remain his common-law wife and companion for a decade. It isn’t clear whether he thought of this trip as a permanent exile— he didn’t say farewell to his friends, nor did he seem to realize that he would never return. Indeed, when he found himself in Europe in the twenties, far from the Moscow and Saint Petersburg of his childhood and youth, his reasons for running away were almost entirely romantic rather than political. Though an accidental émigré, Khodasevich was fortunate that he left Soviet Russia when he did. His name was soon to end up on lists of those who were oﬃcially personae non grata in their homeland. Once out of the country, he could not go home again. ***** Even while abroad Khodasevich continued to write and think a lot about his own place in Russian literary history. Over the course of his thirty-year career he recorded his ideas of what it meant to be both Russian and a poet in four little books of poetry, hundreds of newspaper articles, and four books of prose, including Derzhavin.2 The latter was published serially in Russian-language émigré newspapers and magazines, primarily Vozrozhdenie (The Renaissance) and\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nxvii\n\nSovremennye zapiski (Contemporary Annals).The ﬁnal text of Derzhavin appeared in book form in .3 Of his life in emigration, Khodasevich wrote: . . . Eight little volumes (not a bit more), In them is my entire homeland [ . . . ] I take my Russia along with me In my traveling bag . . .\n\nIn an age of dramatic political and social change, a portable homeland was a very convenient thing to have. The very concept of homeland, though, belies such a possibility. In truth, like many others of his time Khodasevich was without a home, seeking to locate his identity and culture in books, in literature, in a form that was accessible to him as he made his way through the world. In this poem Khodasevich was referring to the eight-volume collected works of Alexander Pushkin that he took with him when he left Soviet Russia. But in his European exile Khodasevich also carried his own eight volumes of poetry and prose along with him. Millions of Russians ﬂed the nascent Soviet Union in the years following the Bolshevik Revolution. Far from Russia, Khodasevich moved restlessly from one apartment to another, from one European haven to the next. Like his more famous compatriot Nabokov, during the twenties and thirties Khodasevich lived in and around Berlin and Paris. His numerous addresses over the years oﬀer a concrete example of the émigré’s eternal sense of homelessness. Vladimir Veidle, a critic and one of Khodasevich’s friends in emigration, referred to his former homeland as the “Nameless Country.” Their once beloved Russia now bore a new name and housed a foreign culture. Repudiating its own political and cultural past, it banned those Russians who had emigrated. The country that was to become the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was not a place to which these émigré Russians could return. Khodasevich entitled his ﬁnal book of poetry European Night, feeling that he was documenting the end of an era, what he and Veidle called the “twilight of culture.” Indeed, to complete the geographic metaphor, by the time Khodasevich had assembled his last book of prose, he had begun his retreat to a time and place devoted to the past, to Necropolis, the city of the dead. ***** Khodasevich’s own biography is fascinating, but more relevant here is the question of why this classical poet chose to write literary biography.4 Khodasevich came by his biographical skills honestly since he had always written about writers. His ﬁrst book of prose, Articles on Russian Poetry (), included an essay he had written for the  centennial of Derzhavin’s death.5 Writing essays\n\nxviii\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nwas more than simply a means of earning money, although it was that as well. As a poet Khodasevich saw himself as uniquely qualiﬁed to explain poets and poetry to the layman and to other critics and literary scholars. He even tried his hand at teaching, although his lecture notes for a series of Proletkult courses on Pushkin, delivered in revolutionary Moscow in , demonstrate that his erudition and fascination with the topic of poetry were better suited to the essay than the classroom.6 Given his temperament and the circumstances surrounding his exile, Khodasevich’s choice of Derzhavin as a biographical subject had a poignant logic. In an autobiographical essay Khodasevich humorously compared himself to Gavrila Romanovich Derzhavin (–), one of the ﬁrst great poets of Russia. Derzhavin was more than just a poet.A statesman and adviser to three tsars, he was involved in political and literary intrigues his entire life. According to legend, the future poet had begun his verbal life with a suitably elevated exclamation.When, as a child, Derzhavin saw a six-tailed comet streak across the sky, his ﬁrst utterance was the word “God!” Throughout his long career Derzhavin’s poetic eye remained focused on the heights: the heavens and God himself, as in the  ode “God”; the mighty of the world, including Catherine the Great, to whom he famously dedicated a number of poems; the roaring torrents of a waterfall in the far north, paired in an ode with the memory of the great prince Grigory Potemkin; or the celebrated eighteenth-century general Suvorov. By contrast, Khodasevich’s eye was focused on the mundane and the quotidian. As he gleefully confessed in his autobiographical essay, the ﬁrst words he spoke as a child were duly humble. At the sight of a kitten, the child called out “Here, kitty kitty.”7 His books of poetry mostly depict that more humble, homely side of life: Youth (); The Happy House (), inspired in large part by the bright days of his ﬁrst marriage; The Way of the Grain (), where the poetic métier is compared to that of a farmer; and The Heavy Lyre ().8 Khodasevich numbered Derzhavin among his poetic inﬂuences. Ironically, he found his own status as a twentieth-century poet to be an inversion of the great Derzhavin’s place in history. The biographical project was doubtless inﬂuenced by a number of factors, not least of which were a dwindling audience among Russians abroad and a paucity of poetic inspiration. “In me is the end,” he wrote in a  poem, but in Derzhavin he sought the beginning. For his only complete literary biography, Khodasevich turned back to the early days of professional poetic activity in eighteenthcentury Russia—to Derzhavin. In a  essay entitled “On Chekhov” Khodasevich wrote: “During Chekhov’s time we were dying. Now we have died, gone ‘beyond the border.’ Chekhov’s time is for us like an illness to a dead man. But\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nxix\n\nif we are fated to be reincarnated . . . then our future is not in ‘Chekhovian moods’ but in Derzhavinian action. If Russia is to rise again, then the pathos of her approaching epoch . . . will be constructive, not contemplative, epic and not lyric, masculine and not feminine, Derzhavinian and not Chekhovian. Derzhavin must a priori become dearer to us than Chekhov.”9 Although Khodasevich saw Derzhavin as a man of his own time, he hoped to present him as a model for the present, a kind of “positive hero” for Russians living abroad. The long, adventure-ﬁlled, inspirational life of Derzhavin was in sharp contrast to the life of Khodasevich himself—ironic and jaded, poetically impotent, in ill-health, and doomed to an early grave. In this book Khodasevich, already living “on the other side” in his own psychological Necropolis, brought the vibrant Derzhavin to the modern era in a valiant eﬀort to inspire his contemporaries, who were also facing the “twilight of culture.” In the preface to his biography Khodasevich deﬁned exactly what he thought a biographer should and should not do. Aware that the author of any narrative imposes a certain structure on the life he describes, Khodasevich went to great lengths to explain his own method: A biographer is not a novelist. He may explain and clarify, but by no means may he invent. In portraying Derzhavin’s life and art (inasmuch as it is connected to his life), I remain entirely faithful—as far as events and situations go—to the information that I have found in [Yakov] Grot and in many other sources. However, I have not used footnotes since I would have had to footnote virtually every line. As far as verbatim quotes go, I quote only from Derzhavin’s own memoirs, his correspondence, and the testimony of his contemporaries. Such quotes are set oﬀ by quotation marks. The dialogue that I have sometimes woven into the narrative always reproduces words that were actually spoken, and in the exact form in which Derzhavin or his contemporaries recorded them.\n\nIn part, Khodasevich felt the need to explain his own theories of biography because of the growing popularity of the genre of biography, which was given new impetus by Lytton Strachey in his Eminent Victorians (). The twenties and thirties saw an explosion of biographical publications. In France André Maurois was to write on Shelley, Byron, and Disraeli. In Germany Stephan Zweig published books on Mary Stuart, Marie Antoinette, and Balzac. And in England Virginia Woolf published the fantastical biographical ﬁction Orlando (). Other Russians were also writing biographies in the thirties, including Boris Zaitsev and Khodasevich’s wife Nina Berberova.10 In Nabokov’s novel The Gift () the main character, Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, receives approbation\n\nxx\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nfor his own biographical attempts from an older writer modeled—not coincidentally—on Khodasevich. Nabokov embedded his biography of nineteenthcentury Russian utopian novelist Nikolai Chernyshevsky in the pages of a novel, whereas Khodasevich’s Derzhavin had an entirely diﬀerent purpose. After all, as Khodasevich pointed out, he was no novelist. ***** Derzhavin may not be ﬁction, but the book reads ﬂuently and easily. Nine chapters long, it covers Derzhavin’s entire life and epoch—a rather exciting one in Russian history. The Russian Empire was in the process of expanding and of solidifying its internal regions. Into this time frame fall such important events as the ﬁrst serious peasant revolt; continual colonization north, south, and east; border wars with Turkey; and the struggle with Napoleon. The chapters are broken up into smaller sections, separated by rows of asterisks. The rhythm of the narrative reﬂects, among other things, Khodasevich’s life in emigration. Khodasevich made his living by peddling newspaper articles and book reviews, and his writing habits developed in accordance with his publishing opportunities.11 Thus, the smaller sections of the book usually run between eight hundred and a thousand words—the average length of a newspaper article. One could also ascribe the occasional abruptness of tone or rapid shifts of scene or action to the serial format of the original publication and to Khodasevich’s journalistic métier. However, one should not view the style of the biography as merely reﬂective of real-life circumstances. More than once Khodasevich uses Derzhavin to make larger statements about poets and poetry. In these sections Khodasevich was writing not only about Derzhavin but about poets in general—including himself. For example, in the third chapter Khodasevich explains the ﬁgurative birth of the poet in the following manner: In the life of every poet (if he is not fated to remain an eternal imitator) there is a moment when, half consciously, half instinctively (but infallibly), he suddenly grasps within himself a stream of images, thoughts, feelings, and sounds, which are connected as they have never been connected in anyone else. His future poetry suddenly sends him a signal. He divines that poetry not with his mind but with his heart.This moment is inexplicable and thrilling, like conception. If it never happens, it is not possible to pretend that it did: the poet either begins with this moment or never begins at all.After this moment everything else is just the maturation and bearing forth of the fruit, which requires intelligence, patience, and love.\n\nThe pace of such sections, where Khodasevich breathlessly but patiently reveals his own understanding of inspiration, makes them stand out from\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nxxi\n\namong the descriptions of Derzhavin’s trials and tribulations or the depiction of elaborate settings and multitudinous characters drawn from the eighteenth century. Throughout the text Khodasevich usurps Derzhavin’s own voice—as he warned he would in his preface—at times lifting whole passages from Derzhavin’s autobiography to give an authentic ﬂavor to his own narrative.12 When the voice of the narrator changes to that of a disengaged observer, however, one can be sure that Khodasevich wants us to pay attention. He writes here as more than just a historical observer of events, reminding his readers that the author is both a poet and a perceptive literary critic as well as a biographer. One of Khodasevich’s stated goals in writing the biography was “to tell about Derzhavin in a new way and to try to bring the image of the great Russian poet— an image that has been partially forgotten and partially obscured by widespread untruths—closer to the contemporary reader’s consciousness.” In so doing, he continually reminds the reader how things were “at that time,” “in those days.” For Khodasevich this biography was a rehabilitation of sorts: he felt that Derzhavin had been given short shrift by the poets and literary historians who followed him, in particular the jocular young poets of the romantic era, who had carved out their own literary niches in part by rejecting their predecessors. Born a poor nobleman in central Russia, Derzhavin rose to great prominence in both government and Russian letters.Throughout his life he remained in the midst of the fray, both political and literary. In characterizing Derzhavin, Khodasevich made sure to explain how the professional situation of writers in the second half of the eighteenth century diﬀered from that of writers active during the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century. For example, in the fourth chapter Khodasevich writes: “At that time all poets served—the profession of a writer did not yet exist.Although the social signiﬁcance of literature was already recognized, the writing of literature was looked upon as a private matter, not a public one. But for Derzhavin poetry and service were connected in a special way.” Derzhavin did not, of course, believe that rank or an award could somehow elevate his poetry. And he certainly did not look upon poetry as a means of obtaining decorations and titles. His was a much more serious and commendable purpose. By the beginning of the eighties, when Derzhavin had reached a fairly responsible position in the government and had begun to distinguish himself in literature, poetry and public service had become for him like two disciplines within a united civic exploit. This union of the two aspects of Derzhavin’s life, namely, civil and poetic service, was one of the things Khodasevich most admired about his predecessor. Unable to participate in the civic life of his homeland, and consequently increasingly cut oﬀ from the source of his poetic inspiration, Khodasevich looked\n\nxxii\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nback on the Catherinian era as a bygone idyllic period, not the object of parody that Derzhavin and his peers became for the younger generation represented by Pushkin.13 In his eﬀort to “rehabilitate” Derzhavin, Khodasevich focused on three very important factors in his life, using them to impose a meaningful narrative structure on the biographical details: fate, the law, and God.Throughout the narrative Khodasevich points out ways in which the eighteenth-century concept of Fortuna seemed to order Derzhavin’s life. The latter’s eventual place beside Catherine the Great is foretold, for example, when Khodasevich describes one of Derzhavin’s trips to Kazan, which coincided with Catherine’s journey: “It was as if fate itself had arranged it so that he was again, for the umpteenth time, Catherine’s unnoticed traveling companion.” In Derzhavin’s life there were plenty of clues concerning his interest in and interactions with fate or fortune, and Khodasevich chose to highlight them throughout the biography. For instance, when Derzhavin was passed over for rewards after service in the campaign against peasant insurrectionist Emilian Pugachov, his luck at cards improved, leading Khodasevich to conclude: “Fortune was paying him what the fatherland had not.” Khodasevich thus mines Derzhavin’s own era and understanding of fate to help explain how his life unfolded, employing a kind of psychological analysis that makes use of the vocabulary of the subject and his era. The second pillar of Derzhavin’s worldview was the Law (Zakon, often deliberately capitalized by Khodasevich to make it, like Fortuna, into a god of the eighteenth century): “In the Russian air of the time, the simple word ‘law’ sounded like an innovation. For Derzhavin it became the source of his highest and most pure feelings, a subject of ardent tenderness.The Law became like a new religion. In his poetry the word Law, like God, came to be surrounded by love and awe.” Coming of age philosophically and politically in the era of Catherine the Great, Derzhavin took her ﬂirtation with Enlightenment ideas more seriously than even she herself ultimately could. As Khodasevich explained, Derzhavin developed a unique attitude toward the institution of the autocracy. According to Khodasevich, in Derzhavin’s eyes the two supports of a legitimate government were the Law and the will of the people.Thus, Derzhavin essentially rejected the idea of a God-anointed sovereign. Interpreting the poem “Epistle to I. I. Shuvalov,” Khodasevich writes that in it Derzhavin was arguing, “ﬁrst of all, that the sovereign who is not supported by the love of the populace is essentially powerless. Secondly, that he is no tsar but a tyrant, a usurper of power, who can be driven from the throne without blasphemy. Consequently, it is not anointment that diﬀerentiates a tsar from a tyrant but the love of the people. This love is the true anointment.Thus, not only the support but the very source\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nxxiii\n\nof tsarist power becomes the people.” It is interesting to see the democratic line of thinking Khodasevich imparts to his predecessor. Khodasevich wanted his reader to think about such issues as Russian government, in which Derzhavin was involved throughout his life, and in particular about questions of revolt and revolution. Two of the three tsars under whom Derzhavin served, Catherine and Alexander, ascended the throne under the violent conditions of a coup d’état and assassination. Believing as he did in the Law, and seeing the furthering of legal accountability as part of his mission, Derzhavin must have meditated on revolution. If not God, then who had the right to choose the leader of a country? Why, for example, could revolt only come from the highest echelons of society, from the grandees, as Derzhavin called them, and not from other estates? Derzhavin earned his ﬁrst elevations of rank in connection with the suppression of the Pugachov rebellion—albeit, Khodasevich writes, “not in the person of Pugachov, of course, but in the pugachovshchina as a popular movement he very soon came to feel the logic if not the truth. He understood that the rebellion had its reasons and justiﬁcations.” In his discussion of these themes, Khodasevich was, inter alia, searching for the roots of the Bolshevik Revolution. Though he was one of the tsarist regime’s most loyal subjects, Derzhavin nonetheless questioned the arbitrary functioning of autocracy. In a way, his philosophical musings, expressed in both his poetry and in his civic actions, presaged the downfall of the Russian autocracy a century later. Derzhavin’s third pillar, He to whom all ﬁnal accounts must be rendered, was God. In the ode “God” Derzhavin had laid out an unusual (and for its time blasphemous) proof that man himself was evidence of God’s greatness. As a child Derzhavin had seen that proof in the heavens in the form of a spectacular comet. By the end of his life, according to Khodasevich’s rendering, Derzhavin had given up his other gods, Fortuna and the Law, and turned to the Christian God and His supreme laws. Khodasevich concludes his biography with an analysis of Derzhavin’s ﬁnal poem, the unﬁnished “River of Time”: “The poem was only just begun, but it is easy to guess its continuation. In refusing historical immortality, Derzhavin must have been turning to thoughts of individual immortality—in God. He had begun the last of his religious odes, but he would not complete it.As an infant, before thought, before comprehension, the ﬁrst word he pronounced was God. His last thought, for which he didn’t have time to ﬁnd words, was also about God.” Here Khodasevich’s scripting of Derzhavin’s life story becomes clear. Derzhavin’s life comes full circle, gaining an integrity and wholeness that was quintessentially eighteenth century yet one which Khodasevich could not fail to admire.\n\nxxiv\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nIn securing Derzhavin’s proper place in Russian history, Khodasevich sought his own place in Russian culture as well.The  poem cited earlier continues: In me is the beginning In me the end I have done so little But I am, after all, a lasting link That happiness has been given me.\n\nWith his biography of Derzhavin Khodasevich forged his own link in the chain connecting the beginning of Russian literature and culture with what he saw as its end. In undertaking this biography, Khodasevich had been searching for a hero, a ﬁgure from the Russian literary past whose shining example would inspire and educate others in the midst of what he described as the fading “twilight of Russian culture.” Derzhavin was that hero. Part of what Khodasevich emphasized in his study of Derzhavin was the latter’s ability to make his poetry a part of his statecraft. As portrayed by Khodasevich, Derzhavin was not so much a man juggling two careers as one for whom there was no diﬀerence between poetry and politics. In this sense, Derzhavin managed to make politics poetic and to make poetry politically relevant in a way that must surely have appealed to the émigré poet. Like his peers, Khodasevich was trying to make sense of the chaos of postrevolutionary culture and the disaster of a divided Russia, split by a geographical and ideological boundary that would remain virtually impenetrable until the collapse of the Soviet Union in . ***** Derzhavin reminded many of its contemporary readers of Pushkin’s prose— which was no accident. In writing this homage Khodasevich deliberately tried to conjure the prose style of both of his literary heroes.14 Scholars have subsequently identiﬁed Derzhavin and his youthful adventures as underlying the plot of Pushkin’s novel The Captain’s Daughter, which also deals with the Pugachov rebellion.15 Like Pushkin’s historical ﬁction, Derzhavin can be read not only as a fascinating artifact but also for its intrinsic literary pleasure. Khodasevich told the history of Derzhavin and his times—of serf uprisings and arctic explorations, of literary and linguistic battles and military confrontations—but he did so as only another poet could. His critical reading of Derzhavin’s life and works is, after all, the reading of a poetic imagination. In this fact lies one of the main reasons why Khodasevich’s Derzhavin has long deserved an English translation.Though other—in some cases painfully prosaic— biographies of Derzhavin exist in English, Khodasevich’s version not only sparkles\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nxxv\n\nwith descriptive narrative passages steeped in Russian literary tradition but also features unique analyses of Derzhavin’s poetry. Khodasevich’s biography is not a seamless narrative recounting the life of his poetic predecessor. In reading it, one must be mindful of its modernist context. Like the American writer John Dos Passos in his U.S.A. trilogy, Khodasevich experimented with narrative form in Derzhavin. Speciﬁcally, he deliberately interrupted the ﬂow of the narrative by inserting lyrical vignettes that serve to pull the lens back on Derzhavin’s life and work in order to draw connections between past and present. Having then oﬀered that lesson in these vignettes, Khodasevich returns us to the story. These interpolations, sprinkled throughout the book, are particularly valuable to the English-language reader who wishes to penetrate Derzhavin’s verses. Having a native critic who is also a classical poet gives the reader a unique perspective on the poetry. Derzhavin wrote classical verse that employed fairly strict metrical and rhyme schemes.Throughout I have used what excellent translations exist, primarily those of Alexander Levitsky and Martha T. Kitchen, and rendered the rest of the poetry myself. I have tried to maintain the feel of the Russian original, including unusual word order and preserving meter and rhyme wherever possible.16 Khodasevich’s explications shed light on Derzhavin’s work in a way that no other biographer or commentator in English has. Specialized studies of Derzhavin have tended to focus on his poetry and his place in the Russian literary canon.17 As a result, they have left out some of the most interesting historical material, including: participation in the suppression of the Pugachov rebellion in ; relations with Catherine, Paul, Alexander, and other important statesmen of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; a stint as governor in remote provinces; battles against lawlessness and arbitrary rule; domestic life, including the sprawling mansion on the Fontanka in Saint Petersburg and the rural estate of Zvanka. Khodasevich’s biography, the idiosyncratic work of an impassioned poet, oﬀers both lyricism and poetic analysis, factual information and opinionated interpretations of the events and philosophical underpinnings of Derzhavin’s life.18 While fascinating as a document reﬂecting its own postrevolutionary time, it is also a much-needed complement to studies of Derzhavin the poet and plodding biographies of Derzhavin the political actor. As Petr Bitsilli, a contemporary critic, wrote in : Khodasevich does not separate Derzhavin-the-poet from Derzhavin-the-“man,” the soldier, the oﬃcer, the governor, the minister, the spouse of “Plenira” and “Milyona.” This is evidence of the author’s tact and his historical perceptiveness. . . . It would be an act of violence against the material to write thus about any great artist of a later period. But it would have been falseness, a lack of perception of the main\n\nxxvi\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nthing in the subject at hand, to write about Derzhavin separately as the governor of Tambov and as the “singer of Felitsa.”19\n\nThis enthusiastic response to Derzhavin was echoed by Mark Aldanov, another émigré author, who argued that certain pages of the biography “should become a part of the classical canon.”Although in his own review Aldanov took issue with some of Khodasevich’s choices, in the end he could not complain.As he wrote, using a traditional Russian saying,“one does not judge the victorious.”20 And Khodasevich was victorious. Derzhavin is quite simply a terriﬁc example of twentieth-century literary biography.As Khodasevich argued in the book, more than any Russian poet Derzhavin incarnated his life in his poetic oeuvre. Here Khodasevich oﬀers us the man, his poetry, and his historical epoch. It is no coincidence that during the last twenty years both Khodasevich and his Derzhavin have experienced a rediscovery in Russia. Derzhavin has been excerpted in journals and published in full a number of times in recent years, suggesting that the ideas Khodasevich explored in his biography remain as relevant for post-Soviet society as they were for postrevolutionary society seventy years ago. Now, thanks to the ﬁrst complete translation of the biography into English, those ideas will be accessible to an English-language audience as well. ***** Derzhavin was Khodasevich’s attempt to repeat the past, to live in a world before the catastrophes of the Bolshevik Revolution, the futurist and communist rejections of Russian poetic heritage, and the encroaching European night of nazism, Stalinism, world war, and cultural holocaust. But Khodasevich had buried his own poetic metaphor underground long before he turned to focus on one of the ﬁrst Russian poets. In “The Way of the Grain” and other poems he described himself as a sower, a planter of seeds in fertile Russian soil. He used his poetry to sink roots deep into the cultural black earth. By the twenties that soil had been saturated with the blood of its citizens, with Khodasevich far from home. In the poem “Underground” () he inverts the metaphor. In the loneliness of a Berlin subway his protagonist sees a man in a worn coat masturbating, his seed falling on the barren concrete ﬂoor.Above is the Berlin day, the “shining delirium” of modern life.The poet seethes with anger and grief, tapping his cane on the “alien granite.” That alien ground received Khodasevich in , in all likelihood saving him from a more gruesome death in a Nazi concentration camp. His literary legacy includes the macabre Necropolis, written from the perspective of an embittered and disillusioned poet grappling with the fates of his literary contemporaries, and the life-aﬃrming Derzhavin.\n\na chronology\n\nLife of Gavrila Derzhavin\n\n  – –    –       – –  –   \n\nborn near Kazan registered in the military served in Preobrazhensky Regiment, ﬁrst as a private and then as an oﬃcer () involved in quelling the Pugachov rebellion resigned his commission wrote odes at Chitalagai married Ekaterina Yakovlevna Bastidonova appointed clerk in Senate wrote “On the Death of Prince Meshchersky” wrote ode “Felitsa” addressed to Catherine II wrote ode “God” served as governor of Olonets Province served as governor of Tambov Province appointed personal secretary to Catherine II served as senator; made head of Collegium of Commerce in  wrote “The Waterfall: On the Death of Potemkin” death of Ekaterina Yakovlevna; remarried Darya Alekseevna Dyakova served as minister of justice of Russia retired to Zvanka, his estate near Novgorod attended Lycée graduation; “passed on his lyre” to Pushkin died at Zvanka xxvii\n\nD\n\nAuthor’s Preface\n\n    Yakov Grot published the results of his colossal research ﬁfty years ago, virtually no new evidence about the life of Derzhavin has appeared.

V K Paris, \n\n\n\n1    , during the reign of Grand Prince Vasily Vasilievich the Dark, the Tatar murza Bagrim came from the Great Horde to serve Muscovy.The grand prince christened him into the Orthodox faith and subsequently rewarded him with lands for his conscientious service. From Bagrim, according to the book of the Russian nobility, were descended the Narbekovs, the Akinfovs, and the Keglevs (or Teglevs). One of the Narbekovs received the nickname Derzhava (which means orb). He began his service in Kazan. It was he who was the progenitor of the Derzhavin family. The family possessed fairly good estates located along the shores of the small river Myosha, between the Volga and Kama rivers, about  or  versts1 from Kazan. Over the course of time the lands came to be divided among heirs, sold, and mortgaged. Roman Nikolaevich Derzhavin, born in the year , was to receive only a few scattered plots. On these estates the peasants numbered not hundreds and not dozens but only a few individuals. Back in the year , in the time of Peter the Great, Roman Nikolaevich entered the army and served, by turns, in various garrison regiments. His rank, like his income, was not great, although he was trusted by his superiors and loved by his fellow soldiers. He was not an ingratiating man but rather quite modest—indeed, perhaps something of a failure.At thirty-six he married a distant relative, Fyokla Andreevna Gorina, née Kozlova, a widow without children.The marriage did not add to his income: Fyokla Andreevna was almost as poor as he himself, and her villages were as scattered as his own.Yet even these wretched estates caused the Derzhavins to carry on incessant lawsuits with their neighbors.And these were lawless times. Every so often ﬁghts would ensue. For instance, a landowner named Chemadurov once enticed Roman Nikolaevich to his home, got him drunk on strong mead, and then—with no regard for his \n\n\n\nV    K\n\nrank or title—beat him mercilessly with the help of relatives and servants. Roman Nikolaevich was laid up for several months, and after that the Derzhavins and the Chemadurovs remained enemies from one generation to the next for over one hundred and ﬁfty years. Only in the eighties of the last century did their discord come to an end. Following his marriage it is not known exactly where Roman Nikolaevich lived—possibly in Kazan itself or in one of his nearby villages.Almost precisely nine months after the wedding, his ﬁrstborn appeared.This event occurred on the third of July in the year , on a Sunday.The infant was named in honor of the Archangel Gabriel, whose day is celebrated on the thirteenth of that month. From birth he was quite weak, small, and skinny. He was subjected to a severe cure: according to the custom of that time and place, the child was baked into a loaf of bread. He did not die.2 When he was about a year old, a large comet with a six-rayed tail appeared in the sky. Ominous rumors circulated about it, and the people expected great calamities.When the comet was pointed out to the infant, he uttered his ﬁrst word: “God!” ***** Soon Derzhavin’s father was transferred to the city of Yaransk, in Vyatka province, and then to Stavropol, on the Volga, about one hundred versts from Samara. These little towns were wretched, merely groups of small wooden shacks. Life was also wretched—a remote, garrison-style life. In addition, their income was small and their family was growing. Within a year after the ﬁrst, a second son was born, and then a daughter, although she did not survive for long. The Derzhavins were people of limited education. Fyokla Andreevna was actually only semiliterate: it seems that she could do no more than sign her name. There was no talk of the arts or sciences in the house. Indeed, if not for their noble status, they might not have taught the children anything at all. In those days, however, a certain level of education was obligatory for children of the nobility in view of their future service.This required level of knowledge was not at all high, but it was extraordinarily diﬃcult to acquire. In all of Russia there were two or three educational institutions in Moscow and Petersburg. Few could actually place their children there—due to the long distances, the lack of vacancies, and so on. For this reason noble minors were granted deferments and permitted to be instructed in their own homes. Of course, this instruction had to be approved by the government, and it was thus necessary to present the children to the provincial administration for examinations or— to use the vocabulary of those days—for inspections by a predetermined date. The ﬁrst such inspection was to take place at seven years of age, the second at\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\ntwelve, and the third at sixteen. Government service was to begin at the age of twenty. If they were relatively prosperous, the inhabitants of the capitals could send their children to boarding schools (which were, however, bad and few in number), or they could hire teachers. For provincials, especially poor ones like the Derzhavins, both alternatives were completely inaccessible. And thus, early on the problem of the boys’ education became for them its own form of perpetual torment.As soon as he turned three, they began to teach Ganyushka his letters. This was not all that diﬃcult: they found some “churchmen”—that is to say sacristans and sextons—to be his ﬁrst teachers. From them he learned how to read and write. His mother—as mothers are wont to do—resorted to incentives: using toys and candies, she tried to give him a taste for reading religious books, such as the Psalter and the lives of the saints. For the ﬁrst inspection this was suﬃcient, and Derzhavin passed it successfully. As time passed, the situation became more diﬃcult. The knowledge of the “churchmen” was already exhausted, and the boy continued to grow.When he was eight, fate took the family to Orenburg. At that time the city was being rebuilt in another location. For labor the government brought in a great number of convicts. One of them, the German Joseph Rose, found a diﬀerent kind of work: he opened a school in Orenburg for noble children of both sexes. There was nothing surprising in this: both in those times and in later years foreign teachers were recruited, more often than not, from amongst the riﬀraﬀ. The most noble Orenburg families gladly began to send their children to be schooled by Joseph Rose.There was no other school. Derzhavin found himself there as well. In his institute Rose was both the director and the only instructor. By nature and habit he was a criminal and by education—an ignoramus. He subjected the children to assorted excruciating and even “indecent” punishments. He taught them only one subject—the German language, the grammar of which he himself did not know.There were no textbooks.The children copied and committed to memory foreign words and dialogues written by Rose himself—with, it is true, great calligraphic artistry, something he also demanded from the students. Be that as it may, Derzhavin somehow learned to speak, read, and write German from him. This was an important acquisition: the German language was in those days the foundation and sign of an education. Only later did French supplant it. The boy was gifted and bright by nature. But life itself also forced him to become inquisitive very early on: whether he liked it or not, it was necessary for him to acquire knowledge, to gather it like crumbs wherever he could ﬁnd it.\n\n\n\nV    K\n\nCalligraphic exercises led him to pen-and-ink drawing.There were no teachers and no patterns. Using ink and ochre, he began by copying bogatyrs3 from cheap popular prints. He gave himself up to this activity “both day and night,” between his lessons and at home. The walls of his room were papered and hung with Russian folk heroes. At the same time, he managed to acquire some knowledge of sketching and geometry from a geodesist who was working with his father, engaged in some kind of land surveying. After two years in Orenburg, the family moved once again to their Kazan estates. In the autumn of  Roman Nikolaevich made up his mind to undertake the long journey to Moscow and then to Petersburg. He had two reasons for this. First of all, he suﬀered from consumption, the result of an old riding injury, and he planned to retire from the service; this had to be taken care of in Moscow. His second reason was that he wanted to see to the future of his eldest son by registering him in advance, according to the laws of the time, in the cadet corps of the army or in the artillery. This required a trip to Petersburg, and Roman Nikolaevich took the boy with him. But in Moscow his eﬀorts to receive his discharge dragged on. Roman Nikolaevich used up all his funds, and he had no money left for the trip to Petersburg.Thus, he had to return to his native lands without making arrangements for his son. At the beginning of  the decree conﬁrming Roman Nikolaevich’s retirement came through, and in November of the same year he died. He left his widow and children in a most sorry state. There was not even enough money to pay a ﬁfteen-ruble debt that remained after his death. The estates, as before, provided no income: the neighbors continued to take the law into their own hands, simply seizing pieces of the Derzhavins’ lands or building mills by the dozen and ﬂooding the Derzhavins’ meadows. Now all the vagaries of the legal struggle fell to the widow. She had neither money nor protectors, and in the oﬃces of Kazan their adversaries prevailed. With her small sons Fyokla Andreevna went from judge to judge. Holding the orphans by the hand, she would stand at doors and in entryways for hours, only to be driven away without a hearing. She would return home and weep. Gavriil saw all of this, and “his mother’s suﬀering from injustice remained eternally etched on his heart.” Meanwhile, the time of the second inspection was approaching. Despite the diﬃculties it caused, Fyokla Andreevna hired two teachers: the garrison schoolmaster Lebedev and the cadet Poletaev. Neither one was very well versed in the sciences. In arithmetic they were limited to the primary operations and in geometry to sketching ﬁgures. However, for the inspection this would do, and in  Fyokla Andreevna set oﬀ for Petersburg with her sons, planning to present them for inspection and then to enroll them in one of the educational institutions there.\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\nThey stopped in Moscow to register the boys’ papers at the Heraldry Oﬃce. But it turned out that Fyokla Andreevna did not have the necessary documents to demonstrate either their noble status or her late husband’s service record. While the bureaucratic entanglements continued, the condition of the roads worsened, and the money ran out as well.Again Petersburg was out of the question. Fortunately, a kind relative turned up in Moscow.With his help they received a new deferment for the minor Gavriil Derzhavin, to the age of sixteen, and returned to Kazan, having put oﬀ the trip to Petersburg until the following year. But Derzhavin was not destined to study in Petersburg.The following year a grammar school opened in Kazan—a kind of colony or outpost of the new Moscow University. Derzhavin enrolled in the grammar school. Many subjects were taught there: Latin, French, and German languages, and also arithmetic, geometry (but no algebra), music, dancing, and fencing.The teachers, however, were no better than the garrison schoolmaster Lebedev and the cadet Poletaev. As before, there were no textbooks.They studied “faith—without a catechism; languages—without grammar books; numbers and geometry—without proofs; melodies—without sheet music; and so forth.” The teachers quarreled and sent denunciations of each other and of the director, Veryovkin, to Moscow. Veryovkin himself was a Moscow University graduate, a young man who was not overly learned but who was energetic and knew how to put on a good show for the authorities. He tried to compensate for the deﬁciencies in teaching with ceremonial speech days, on which the students performed Sumarokov’s tragedies and Molière’s comedies and declaimed rote speeches composed by the teachers in four languages. Prayer services were conducted and cannon were ﬁred. In allegorical representations cardboard ﬁgures of Lomonosov and Sumarokov (who were both still alive then) clambered up a rocky Parnassus so as to extol the empress Elizaveta Petrovna, as instructed by a cardboard Jupiter. Sometimes the best students, including Derzhavin, were sent oﬀ on strange missions: to conduct excavations in Bolgary, an ancient Tatar city, or to lay out a new plan for the city of Cheboksary.Veryovkin sent grandiose reports to Moscow about all of this to the head dean, Ivan Ivanovich Shuvalov. In  Derzhavin was informed that for his successes in geometry he had been enrolled in the corps of engineers. He began to dress in the corps of engineers uniform, and from that time forward he was attached to the artillery section during school festivities. Suddenly, three years after enrolling in the grammar school, Derzhavin had to leave without having obtained any particular knowledge. In Petersburg Shuvalov had made a mess of the Kazan pupils’ papers, and instead of the corps of engineers, Derzhavin turned out to have been enrolled as a soldier in the light guard of the Preobrazhensky regiment, with a leave granted only through the\n\n\n\nV    K\n\nﬁrst of January . By the time the Preobrazhensky regiment sent Derzhavin’s “passport” to the Kazan grammar school, this term had already expired. There was no way out: without warning Derzhavin the schoolboy had become a soldier. He had to leave for Petersburg immediately. His mother collected the money for his journey and an extra hundred rubles for his future life. It was February . Derzhavin was not to reach Petersburg until March.\n\n2 “, ! ’   !,” laughed the regimental duty oﬃcer, Major Tekutev, looking at his passport. And in a thunderous voice he ordered Derzhavin to be led to the regiment’s courtyard. At ﬁrst he was threatened with arrest for his tardiness. In the oﬃce Derzhavin did not lose his head and forced them to look over the entire ﬁle. He had the right to demand an assignment to the corps of engineers and a leave until he reached the age of twenty. However, for that he would need both money and patrons. He settled for avoiding punishment and being enrolled in company three as a private. Because of his poverty, he was unable to rent an apartment as a nobleman ought. He had to take up lodging in the barracks. He dressed in the uniform of the Preobrazhensky regiment.This consisted of a short, dark-green jacket with gold tabs on the collar, along the lines of a Holstein uniform. From beneath the dress jacket peeked a yellow camisole. The trousers were also yellow, and for the head a powdered wig—with a thick braid bent upward and ringlets pasted on with a thick tallow pomade—stuck out over the ears. These were severe times for military men. Emperor Peter III had been on the throne for only three months, acting the willful tyrant, abruptly reforming the army along the Prussian-Holstein model, and preparing for a pointless attack on Denmark. From the ﬁrst day the junior oﬃcer (called the aide-de-camp in those days) began to teach Derzhavin the riﬂe manual and front-line maneuvers. Derzhavin’s thoughts were focused elsewhere, the life of a soldier seeming to him a calamity and an insult. However, thanks to his natural diligence and the persistence with which he had long ago become accustomed to approaching all activities, in this training, too, he wanted to catch up with his company comrades, \n\n\n\nV    K\n\nwho had begun their service before him. Using the one hundred rubles that his mother had given him, he took it into his head to pay the aide-de-camp for additional lessons. Soon he was so proﬁcient in the exercises that he was chosen to participate in the inspection details of which Peter III was such a great enthusiast. Service was no laughing matter, and it occupied the whole day. In addition to the line drills and the inspections, he had to stand sentry duty in the regiment courtyard or at the palace cellars. (At the beginning Derzhavin was not put on sentry duty inside the palace.) The soldiers were continually detailed for work duties, such as snow removal, canal cleaning, and the conveyance of provisions from stores. Finally, the oﬃcers made them run their errands. There were no holidays. In the evenings he would return from his duties and drills. The barracks in which he was quartered was not large. Partitions made of boards divided it into several very small rooms. Besides Derzhavin ﬁve other soldiers lived here: two bachelors and three married men. The married soldiers had their wives and children with them, and Derzhavin boarded with one of the soldiers’ wives. Back in Kazan he had taken a liking to pen-and-ink drawing and to playing the violin, which was taught at school by an instructor named Orfeev. In the\n\nA map of St. Petersburg during the reign of Empress Elizaveta Petrovna. . Engraving.  (?).\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\nbarracks he had to give up both of these hobbies: drawing because of the darkness and the violin so as not to annoy his fellow lodgers. However, at night, when everyone had settled down, he would read all the books he could get his hands on, in both Russian and German. His knowledge of literature up to this point had been meager. During his school years he read a translation of Fénelon’s Télémaque (whose translation is unclear— Tredyakovsky was to publish his famous Telemakhida only later), then John Barclay’s political novel Argenis, and The Adventures of Marquis Glagol, that is to say, Mémoires du marquis *** ou Aventures d’un homme de qualité qui s’est retiré du monde— a novel by Abbé Prévost.1 From among Russian authors he knew Lomonosov’s odes and Sumarokov’s tragedies. Back in Kazan, he had begun to write himself. Now, in the nocturnal quiet of the barracks, he would sometimes take up these exercises: knowing no rules, he wrote poetry by ear, at ﬁrst imitating Lomonosov and Sumarokov, and then the Germans Haller and Hohedorn, whom he read in Petersburg. The results were clumsy and awkward: neither the verse nor the prosody came out right,\n\nView, looking east along the Neva River from the Admiralty and the Academy of Science. Engraving. . E. G.Vinogradov, from a drawing by M. I. Makhaev.\n\n\n\nV    K\n\nand there was no one to whom he could show them, no one to ask for advice and guidance. However, Derzhavin soon forswore the high style of famed poets. For ceremonial odes and weighty themes he had neither the erudition nor the practical knowledge. He confused the Olympians and had seen the tsar only during sentry duty. He decided that in future he should not strive for Pindar but should rather sing simply, as in: What more could I desire? I write and kiss My dear Anyuta—bliss.\n\nIn reality there was no Anyuta. But somehow the soldiers’ wives learned that he was literate, and thanks to the soldiers’ wives all the rest found out.They were of course not curious about Derzhavin’s Muse, but they did begin to ask him to write letters home for them, and soon, able to satisfy the peasants’ taste, he became their scribe.We should add that from those same inexhaustible one hundred rubles of his mother’s he sometimes lent his comrades a ruble or two and thus became the favorite of the whole company.The Muse herself was not put oﬀ by life in military quarters: for practice he put into verse lewd stories that circulated in the barracks—about the various guards regiments, or on the occasion of curious events in regimental and tavern life.The rhymes were well liked. Nevertheless, he kept his own counsel. He rarely entered into conversations: he was busy with his service and his own thoughts. In the meantime, summer arrived. ***** Not in vain had the six-tailed comet, pointed out to the babe Derzhavin, appeared in the sky in . It had not brought calamities, as the people had feared, but it did foretell events of the greatest importance. In that very same year, on the ninth of February, Princess Sophie Frederika Augusta of Anhalt-Zerbst arrived in Moscow. Empress Elizaveta Petrovna had sent for her to marry her nephew, Grand Prince Peter Fedorovich.The princess became Grand Princess Ekaterina Alekseevna, wife of the heir to the Russian throne. On the twenty-ﬁfth of December , just over two months before Derzhavin arrived in Petersburg, Elizaveta Petrovna passed away and Peter III became emperor. Being stupid and crass, in the very ﬁrst months of his reign he managed to inculcate in the people and the armed forces the same disgust toward his person that his wife had felt for years.The army grumbled at the Prussian uniforms he introduced, the Prussian drills, the daily changing of the guard. But more than anything they were annoyed by the fact that the emperor brought regiments from his native Holstein to Russia, quartered them at his own residence at Oranienbaum, and gave the Holsteiners clear preference over the Russian army.\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\nDerzhavin, of course, noticed this grumbling but kept his own counsel. His burning sense of resentment drowned out most everything else. His position in the guard was humiliating, and he had no desire to share its spirit. Beyond the fact that he was forced to serve in the rank and ﬁle, he had already been passed over for promotions: several young soldiers who began their service after he had were already corporals, while he was still a private.The reason was always the same: his poverty. Finally it got to be so bad that when he met a certain Pastor Helterhof, an acquaintance from Kazan, he conceived the idea of transferring into the Holstein army. This move would have been facilitated by his knowledge of German. Helterhof promised Derzhavin an oﬃcer’s rank in the emperor’s favored Holstein army. It was just coming up on June. At the palace a periodic coup was brewing. Both at court and among the troops an overwhelming majority advocated the ousting of the emperor.At the head of the conspiracy stood Empress Catherine. On the morning of the twenty-seventh of June Derzhavin suﬀered a misfortune.While he was at drill all his money—those very same cherished one hundred rubles (or what remained of them), which he kept hidden in his locker— was stolen by the servant of the young soldier Lykov, another nobleman who was quartered in Derzhavin’s barracks.The thief disappeared with the loot and Derzhavin was not himself all day. In the meantime, one of the soldiers, drunk, came out onto the gallery and began to shout that as soon as the regiment was sent out of town (here he had in mind the expected attack on Denmark), “then we’ll ask why and where they’re sending us, forcing us to leave our beloved empress, whom we serve with pleasure.” Derzhavin did not pay attention to these speeches: the loss of his money made him indiﬀerent toward everything else. He was merely waiting until soldiers friendly to him returned so they might set out in pursuit of the thief. Finally, toward evening, the thief was caught, and he still had virtually all the money on him. Derzhavin was consoled, and only then did he begin to notice that something was wrong in the regiment. At midnight a rumor spread that Captain Passek of the grenadiers’ company had been arrested and put under guard. The barracks was in a state of alarm. Soldiers, arming themselves, ran out onto the parade ground. However, having made a bit of noise, they dispersed again and it seemed that everything grew calm. In reality events had only begun. Passek was one of the conspirators. The empress lived at Peterhof, and Peter III at Oranienbaum. Passek’s arrest caused the conspirators to hurry. At  a.m. Alexei Orlov put Catherine into a gig and\n\n\n\nV    K\n\nbrought her to Petersburg, straight to the barracks of the Izmailovsky regiment. The revolt had begun. At eight in the morning a courier rode up to the Preobrazhensky regiment and shouted that everyone should proceed to Her Majesty at the Winter Palace. The company ran out onto the parade grounds, and Derzhavin with it. From the barracks of the Izmailovsky regiment the beating of drums could be heard. The alarm was sounded.The city had already taken fright. Derzhavin watched the companies of Preobrazhensky soldiers, loading their weapons as they ran, rush oﬀ to the Winter Palace.The oﬃcers remained idle. Only Major Voeikov, on horseback, tried to stop his company of grenadiers on Liteiny Street. Drawing his sword and cursing, he began to slash at the grenadiers’ caps. Suddenly the company snarled and threw themselves on him, bayonets raised. Voeikov galloped oﬀ, the grenadiers in pursuit. They drove both him and his horse into the Fontanka River and then rushed on themselves. Gradually the entire regiment reached the Winter Palace. There the Preobrazhensky soldiers were placed throughout the building.\n\nView of the Birzha and Gostiny Dvor, with the Little Neva River. Engraving. . I. P. Elyakov, from a drawing by M. I. Makhaev.\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\nPalace revolutions of the eighteenth century had long since drawn the guards into politics. Soldiers had gotten used to resolving dynastic disputes with their bayonets and in this sense knew their own worth. Among the Preobrazhensky guard it is likely that only Derzhavin did not share the general animation.A novice at life and uninitiated in the ways of the state, he doubtless did not even understand the meaning of and need for a revolt. Only one thing was clear to him: the revolt would strike a crippling blow to his last hope. If Peter III were deposed, there would be no more Holstein army, and Derzhavin would not be an oﬃcer in it. He did not rush oﬀ with everyone else, arriving at the palace in a leisurely fashion, on the heels of the regiment, and in an equally leisurely fashion he sought out his own company and stood in his appropriate place within the ranks. Soon the Izmailovsky regiment arrived and with them the news that the empress was in the palace.The soldiers took turns swearing their allegiance to her by kissing the cross. Guard and army regiments arrived, one after the other.They also had the oath administered to them and were then formed up: the guard along the\n\nView of the Fontanka River from the Grotto and Zapasnoi Palace, looking south.

Thus time passed until evening.The weather was clear. Finally the horsemen appeared. In front, on the white horse Diamond, sitting astride like a man, in boots with spurs and the uniform of the Preobrazhensky guard, slowly rode Catherine herself.The setting Petersburg sun, a summer-evening sun, shone right into her face—serene, gracious, with a thin nose, a rounded chin, and a small, tender mouth. Her ﬂowing hair, caught only with a ribbon at the neck, fell from her three-cornered hat onto the horse’s back. It stirred in the wind. Her small hand in its white glove held up a thin silver sword. The regiments cried out “Hurrah!” Drums beat. It was thus that Derzhavin ﬁrst saw her. She rode past.A ceremonial march was struck up, the soldiers formed up by platoon, and the troops moved behind her. Thus they marched until midnight, when, along with Catherine, they stopped for a rest at Krasny Kabachok [Little Red Tavern]. Then they continued on. It was light: the white nights had not yet ended. Early in the morning, in advance of the sovereign, they began to approach Peterhof.The Holstein armies, assembled there by Peter III but subsequently abandoned, surrendered without a single shot. At eleven o’clock Catherine arrived and was again met with shouts of “Hurrah!” and cannon ﬁre. At Peterhof the regiments were installed in the gardens. Here they had their dinner. The soldiers were given beef and bread; they cooked some kasha. The troops rested. About ﬁve o’clock Derzhavin saw a large four-person carriage, harnessed to six horses, with curtains closed. On the footboards, the coach box, and the running boards stood and sat grenadiers.A horse convoy rode behind the carriage.The emperor, who had just abdicated, was being conveyed to Ropsha.2 At seven o’clock they began the return journey.This time they moved slowly. It was noon before they reached Petersburg and two o’clock before they were dismissed to their quarters. This was Saint Peter’s Day, and the weather was extremely hot. Unaccustomed to such heat, Derzhavin barely made it to his barracks. Now, free at last, he could stop and contemplate the reversals of Fortune: he had, for all that, just taken part in deposing Peter III and, by doing so, in the destruction of his own dream of becoming a Holstein oﬃcer. On the other hand, it was good that he had not managed to become one yet; otherwise his position would now be rather diﬃcult. It happened that he had plenty of time for such contemplations: military exercises were canceled and there was general rejoicing. “Taverns, wine cellars, and eating houses were opened to the soldiers: a sumptuous feast began; in frenzied\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\njoy and happiness soldiers and soldiers’ wives carried tubs of wine, vodka, beer, mead, champagne, and all sorts of other expensive liquors—and poured them all together, without any distinction, into vats, barrels, and whatever other vessels they had.” Thus it continued all day, all night, and all the next day. On the second day of revelry, toward midnight, the Izmailovsky regiment, which had raised Catherine to the throne, completely lost its head while in the grip of drunkenness, pride, and “dreamy high opinions.” A rumor began to circulate that Catherine had been kidnapped. The soldiers demanded that she be shown to them. No amount of persuasion had any eﬀect since the soldiers mainly wanted to demonstrate their zeal and to show oﬀ before the empress. They presented themselves at the palace. Catherine was already sleeping.They forced her to get up, dress in her guards uniform, and lead the regiment back to their barracks. It was not at all easy for her to pacify her reveling supporters. In addition to guards on the bridges, squares, and intersections, she had to place pickets with loaded cannon and lit fuses.The state of alarm continued for more than a week. Finally Alexei Orlov departed for Ropsha—and on the sixth of July the former emperor died “from an ordinary hemorrhoidal attack such as he had often suﬀered before.” This news sobered everyone. Quiet was established in and of itself. Three days before this event the musketeer Derzhavin turned nineteen. ***** Passing over her eight-year-old son, the empress rushed to secure the throne for herself. On the day after the murder of Peter III, with his body not yet interred, it was announced in a manifesto that “the coronation will take place in September.” Then the transfer of people, institutions, and guards from Petersburg to Moscow began.3 In August Derzhavin was given leave and told to report to his regiment in Moscow in the ﬁrst days of September. He set oﬀ at his own expense, “equipped with a little covered wagon and having purchased a horse.” In Moscow he wandered about aimlessly, his Holstein uniform inducing ridicule.4 Pyotr Shishkin, another soldier and a nobleman like himself, borrowed almost all his money along the way and did not return it.Thus, he would have had to starve had he not taken up residence with his aunt, Fyokla Savvishna Bludova.This aunt lived on the Arbat in her own house and was by nature a clever woman, though extremely uneducated. Even so, she was known for the ﬁrmness of her views, her piety, and her authoritative character. Finally Catherine and the court were approaching Moscow.They stopped not far away, in the village of Petrovskoe, at the estate of Count Razumovsky.That\n\n\n\nV    K\n\nday the coronation celebrations began—and for Derzhavin new troubles. He had to leave his aunt and return to his soldier’s life. The only consolation was that new uniforms were issued that were not as silly-looking as the previous ones. The lucky Kirila Grigorievich Razumovsky honored his illustrious guests with feasts, festivities, and ﬁreworks at his magniﬁcent palace, in the spacious gardens, and on the glorious ponds of his estate. During these events the musketeer Derzhavin stood guard. On the thirteenth of September Catherine entered the ancient capital amid a splendid procession, with much bell-ringing, cannon ﬁre, and a general hue and cry. Derzhavin was lost in the endless rows of parading troops. On the twenty-second, according to all the rituals of pious Russian tsars and emperors, Catherine was crowned at Uspensky Cathedral. She was triumphant, and her retinue rejoiced.They were showered with medals, titles, houses, and lands— the musketeer Derzhavin was still standing guard. Afterward crowds of common people celebrated on Red Square. Steers stuﬀed with poultry were roasted and put out for them, and fountains of Rhine wine ﬂowed. Lampions smoked, the black shadows of ﬂags ﬂuttered on the buildings and the walls of the Kremlin, and music resounded. Derzhavin stood guard. The ﬁrst wave of celebrations came to an end, but Moscow was still full of the noise of events, balls, and conversations. Catherine went forth from the inner chambers of the Kremlin Palace to the oﬃces of the Senate: to describe the broad outlines of grand designs, resurrect the memory of Peter the Great, lay the foundations of her magniﬁcent regime, win hearts, dazzle with her intelligence, and charm with her smiles.And Derzhavin was still a musketeer and still stood guard. It is true that he was allowed to kiss her hand once or twice as Catherine passed the guard box. During the winter Catherine left the ill-equipped Kremlin Palace for Golovinsky in the German Settlement. Derzhavin stood guard there as well. Once, late at night, in a ﬁeld behind the palace, he almost froze to death in his booth— his relief arriving just in time to save him. At Shrovetide all of Moscow feasted again. There were pancakes, pleasure grounds, and sledding hills.A traveling theater strolled the streets.The ﬁne actor Fyodor Grigorievich Volkov produced various comedies, songs were sung, sins and sinners were lampooned—card players, drunks, bribe takers, deacons, and corrupt judges. Derzhavin did not celebrate. Life was hard for him. He was again living with conscripted soldiers on Tverskaya Street, in a wing of the Kiselevs’ house. In addition to keeping watch, he fulﬁlled other “lowly duties.” In particular, he often had to deliver regimental orders, issued in the evening, to oﬃcers in their quarters.The diﬃculty was that the oﬃcers lived all over Moscow: some\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\non Nikitskaya Street, some on Tverskaya, on the Arbat, on Presnya, beyond the Moscow River on the Ordynka, and so on. In order to deliver all the packets by morning, Derzhavin had to begin his journey at midnight. The winter was a snowy, stormy one, and the streets were dark and impassable. Once, late at night on the empty Presnya, he sank deep into the snow and was attacked by dogs. Slashing with his cutlass, he managed to ﬁght them oﬀ. On another occasion, late in the evening, he brought a packet to Prince Kozlovsky, an ensign of the rd company and a fairly well known poet. Kozlovsky had guests—and not ordinary ones.Vasily Ivanovich Maikov, the future author of “Elisei,” was reading his translation of Voltaire’s “Mérope.”5 With the arrival of a courier, the reading stopped abruptly but then began again. Derzhavin, having delivered the packet, was in no hurry to leave. He stood at the door and began to listen.Then, turning to him, the master of the house said calmly: “Go with God, brother soldier; why should you yawn to no purpose? After all, you cannot understand any of this.” Finally he learned from somewhere that Shuvalov was planning to go abroad. He wrote a letter to the aristocrat, reminded him of his successful studies at the Kazan school, and begged to be taken along to foreign lands “so as to learn something there.” He showed up with the letter in Shuvalov’s foyer and found himself surrounded by supplicants and petitioners. Shuvalov, passing by, took the letter, stopped, read it, and told him to come again.Thrilled, Derzhavin rushed to his Aunt Bludova’s to share his hopes. But Fyokla Savvishna knew something about Shuvalov—namely, that he was a Mason. She also ﬁrmly knew that the Masons were apostates, heretics, and blasphemers devoted to the Antichrist, and that they were able to destroy their enemies at a distance of several thousand versts. Consequently, she rebuked her inexperienced nephew for his acquaintance with such a horrible scoundrel and strictly forbade him to visit Shuvalov, threatening to write to his mother in Kazan about it all if he disobeyed her. For Derzhavin this was a “cruel defeat,” but, having been brought up to fear God and his parents, he did not dare disobey his aunt and never visited Shuvalov again. Winter ended, and spring passed as well. Only in June, on the anniversary of the Peterhof march, did Fortune ﬁnally bestow a wan smile on Derzhavin: having been passed over for promotion many times, he sent a petition to Alexei Orlov and was promoted to corporal. From the rank of corporal to that of an oﬃcer was still a long way, but even so he was pleased. Feeling a desire to show oﬀ his new rank, he decided to visit his mother and requested a year’s leave to go to Kazan.Two traveling companions turned up: a corporal,Aristov, from his own regiment and a “lovely young noble maiden,” who was returning to her parents in Kazan.The maiden was of questionable moral character. Indeed, she was the\n\n\n\nV    K\n\nmistress of that same Veryovkin who had once been the director of the Kazan grammar school and had now become a friend of the governor.Aristov paid her court, and Derzhavin, too, was extraordinarily captivated by the beauty. Along the way he played the fool, joking with her and trying to charm her as much as he could. “Being constantly together and not standing on ceremony, he had the luck to endear himself to her so much by his liveliness and conversation that no matter how envious his comrade was and how many obstacles he threw up at every step and every opportunity, he was unable to prevent the union of their passion.” After the “union of their passion,” though, it somehow came to pass that Derzhavin took the traveling expenses of the noble maiden upon himself. This gesture was accepted graciously but turned out to be more than his thin wallet could handle. On the Klyazma River ferrymen and cabmen refused to cross for the price that Derzhavin oﬀered them. Stranding the travelers on the ferry, they scattered, and the beauty, after waiting half an hour, began to complain and cry. “Who can remain untouched by the tears of one’s beloved? The passionate corporal, baring his cutlass, ran to ﬁnd the ferrymen.” They remained obstinate and refused to budge. Soon Derzhavin was reaching for his new riﬂe, which he had just bought in Moscow. Fortunately it did not ﬁre. Derzhavin again took up his cutlass and began to rush about the village with it.The whole aﬀair could have ended in bloodshed, but in the end Derzhavin was paciﬁed. When they ﬁnally arrived in Kazan, he had hopes of meeting his beauty frequently there as well. “But, being of low rank and not wealthy, he could not have free passage to her room.” In addition, his mother quickly sent him away to the city of Shatsk: perhaps on some inheritance business, or perhaps to remove him from temptation. From Shatsk he went on straight to the Orenburg village where his mother was living at the time. In a word, he never again saw “this object of his aﬀections.” Thus ended his ﬁrst love aﬀair, and thus for the ﬁrst time he demonstrated his tempestuous nature in his battle with the ferrymen. ***** A year later his old life in Petersburg began again: the same soldier’s routine and duties and, when his comrades were not watching, furtive reading and scribbling of poetry. Derzhavin read Klopstock, Kleist (the elder), tried translating Telemachus and Klopstock’s “Messiah” in verse. He himself wrote quite a bit in various genres; he composed madrigals, idylls, satires, epigrams, and fables, in which he imitated La Fontaine through the German Gellert.6 He also gave the type of poetry popular in those days its due—candy wrappers.These were couplets designed to grace the papers in which candies were wrapped. Derzhavin wrote them not for proﬁt but for practice.\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\nHe likewise tried to master the rules of the poetic craft: he studied the theoretical works of Tredyakovsky, Lomonosov, and Sumarokov with painstaking care. Using the works of Prince Kozlovsky, the poet who had insulted him, he ﬁnally learned how to place the caesura correctly in an alexandrine line. He used that meter to write stanzas to Natasha, “a beautiful soldier’s daughter, a neighbor in the barracks.” He also struck up a literary friendship: he sometimes went to parties at Osokin’s, a poetry lover and merchant’s son from his part of the country who had published only one book: A Note on the Improvement of the Quality of Various Russian Wools. At Osokin’s he met Tredyakovsky. Tredyakovsky was already over sixty, his life was coming to an end, and he was no longer an inﬂuential literary force.Yet he could have been a wonderful teacher for Derzhavin, especially because he immediately sensed Derzhavin’s talent. However, Derzhavin either was unable to develop this acquaintance or did not dare. As before, despite all his liveliness, it was as if he was weighed down by his soldier’s duty: all this time he was living and working cautiously, still just approaching life. His poetic progress was not great. He continued to suﬀer from that same clumsiness and lack of skill and wrote boring songs, weighty idylls, and toothless epigrams. Only his lewd rhymes continued to amuse his comrades. One piece, however, cost him dearly. It told of a certain corporal whose wife was loved by a regimental secretary.After this, for two and a half long years the regimental secretary assiduously crossed Derzhavin’s name oﬀ the list of those to be promoted, and for two and a half years Derzhavin remained a corporal. Only one thing had gotten easier: now he was quartered with noblemen. Although these men were cleaner and less rude in their manners, they also gave themselves over to all kinds of pranks, and little by little Derzhavin, under their inﬂuence, began to “become debauched.” Finally his enemy, the regimental secretary, was replaced by another, a certain Neklyudov, and in September  Derzhavin was promoted to quartermaster, and after that to quartermaster-sergeant.At the beginning of  the empress undertook a second trip to Moscow to establish a commission for drawing up a new law code. Derzhavin, under the command of two oﬃcers, the Lutovinov brothers, was sent to the staging post to oversee the preparation of horses for the court’s trip. One of the Lutovinovs was sent to Yazhelbitsa, the other to Zimogorie.These were two post stations located near the famous Valdai, about which Radishchev had written: “Who hasn’t been to Valdai? Who hasn’t heard of Valdai’s baked goods and Valdai’s rosy-cheeked girls? The audacious and shameless Valdai girls stop every traveler and try to inﬂame his passion, taking advantage of his generosity at the expense of their chastity.”7 It goes without saying that the Lutovinovs spent all their time in hospitable Valdai. They played cards\n\n\n\nV    K\n\nwith travelers and got drunk, several times locking themselves in a tavern for the entire night and not letting anyone in except girls. Whether he wanted to or not, Derzhavin had to take part in the amusements of his superiors.True, he refrained from drinking, but little by little he got carried away by cards, and he took to them with a passion. He lived thusly for four months. Finally, at the end of March the court passed by, the elder Lutovinov was arrested for excessiveness and unruly conduct, and Derzhavin successfully made it to Moscow. When the warm weather set in, the empress embarked upon a trip along the Volga, and the guard was ordered to return to Petersburg. Derzhavin took the opportunity to again request leave to go to Kazan to visit his mother and brother, whom he hadn’t seen for over two years. It is not known if Derzhavin observed even part of the historic “passage” of the empress along the Volga. It is also not known who caught up with whom along the way: Derzhavin with the empress or the empress with Derzhavin. At any rate, he had occasion to be a witness to her arrival in Kazan. It was as if fate itself had arranged it so that he was again, for the umpteenth time, Catherine’s unnoticed traveling companion. In those days he had broken the vow that he had made to himself not to chase after Pindar and not to praise tsars. Back in Valdai, living with the Lutovinovs, he had ventured to write “iambic hexameters” about the empress crossing the river Mokhost, which ﬂows in that region. Now, in Kazan, he let himself go: one after another appeared the poems “On the Passage of the Empress to Kazan,” “On the Mascarade, Presented before the Empress in Kazan,” and, ﬁnally, the ﬁrst “Ode to Catherine II.” The tsaritsa, however, traveled on, Derzhavin’s poetic fervor cooled (perhaps because the poetry again turned out not quite as well as might have been hoped), and he plunged into daily life. His mother, as before, was struggling desperately to manage her villages, ﬁghting legal battles with neighbors and continually mortgaging, buying, and selling land.8 His brother had graduated from grammar school and it was high time for him to begin his service. Having spent the summer and autumn with his family in Orenburg province, Derzhavin got ready to return to Petersburg. His leave was over. Finally he set oﬀ, taking upon himself two commissions: ﬁrst, to accompany his brother to Petersburg and settle him in his regiment there; and, second, while passing through Moscow, to buy from some people named Taptykov a small village, comprising about thirty souls, located on the river Vyatka. His mother had given him money for this purpose. In Moscow a too common occurrence repeated itself: the completion of the deed of purchase with the Taptykovs was delayed. Derzhavin sent his brother on to Petersburg by himself, asking the regimental secretary Neklyudov to enroll\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\nthe young man in the Preobrazhensky regiment, which he did. For himself Derzhavin requested a two-month extension of his leave to settle his business.This request was also honored, and around this time Derzhavin was even promoted to sergeant. He stayed in Moscow, planning to complete the purchase of the estate. But things suddenly took an utterly unbelievable turn. Derzhavin had settled in with his relatives, at the house of his cousin Major Ivan Yakovlevich Bludov, the son of that same aunt, Fyokla Savvishna, who has already been mentioned. Bludov had a distant relative and bosom friend living with him, retired second lieutenant Maksimov. Maksimov lived a reckless life. He was not only Bludov’s friend but the friend of all of Moscow, especially of various Senate clerks. It was possible to arrange various and sundry deals through him, both honest and dubious—especially dubious ones. Bludov was under his inﬂuence.The house was ﬁlled with all sorts of people from morning to night. The drinking and card playing never stopped. Derzhavin had been attracted to cards since his time in Valdai. Now, in Bludov’s and Maksimov’s company, he occasionally began to play.At ﬁrst he played only a little, and timidly, but then, of course, he was drawn in. Beginners are usually lucky, but with Derzhavin things went diﬀerently.With every game his position became worse. Stubborn and hot-headed, he was unacquainted with the proverb “bet, but don’t try to win your money back.” Having lost his own money, he did not desist, but instead began to gamble with the money his mother had given him to buy the estate, and within a short time he had lost it all, down to the last kopek. His cousin Bludov, seeming to help him out of this hole, in fact saddled him with onerous terms. That is to say, he gave Derzhavin the money to buy the estate, but as a guarantee of the loan took a mortgage deed out on the village and on another one belonging to Derzhavin’s mother as well. Derzhavin had no right to make such a deal, and consequently he desperately needed to get rich quick to buy the mortgages back from Bludov. There was only one method to do this: to try to win his money back by gambling. And so, having mere pennies to his name, he began to frequent taverns day and night, looking for a game. Soon he became a regular in such places and a friend of the other regulars. In other words, “He began to associate with gamblers, or, rather, with bandits disguised by their decorous behavior and clothing; he learned all the tricks from them: how to persuade beginners to play, how to select and substitute cards, and all sorts of gambling swindles.” The truth must be stated: even in this society he maintained that particular nobility of character often found among true cardsharps. Of course, he was not averse to “winning with his wiles”; otherwise he would not have joined such\n\n\n\nV    K\n\ncompany. But, probably remembering his own story, he sometimes protected beginners and the inexperienced.Thus, he once saved from swindlers a young minor from Penza who was “weak in the head but strong in the pocketbook.” To avenge this, a massive plot was mounted against Derzhavin, with plans to stab and perhaps even kill him. By a strange coincidence, however, he was saved by another person whose benefactor he was: the oﬃcer Gasvitsky. Not long before this Derzhavin had managed to warn Gasvitsky that he was being beaten at billiards in a tavern through the use of weighted balls. Card sharping, however, did not bring Derzhavin any proﬁt. Either he got too excited and lost to more skillful players or there were some other reasons unknown to us, but Derzhavin was unable to put together the necessary funds and pay oﬀ Bludov. Even worse, sometimes he would lose everything, to his last shred of clothing, and have to abandon gambling until he managed to get some money.At times he not only had nothing to gamble with but had nothing to live on.Then, locking himself in at home, he would “eat bread with water and scribble verses.” Sometimes he was ﬁlled with despair. He would close the blinds and sit in a dark room with only rays of sunlight peeking through the cracks. The habit of spending unhappy days in this manner remained with him for the rest of his life. Six months had already passed since his leave extension had ended. His regiment heard rumors that he had “worn himself out” in Moscow, and he did not even send any explanations to Petersburg, let alone think of returning. He was threatened with court-martial and demotion to private in the army. His old benefactor, Neklyudov, saved Derzhavin without even consulting him by having him transferred to a Moscow detachment. His stay in Moscow was thus legitimized. Derzhavin even served for a while as secretary—or “composer,” to use the terminology of those days—in a deputy law commission. When his mother sent for him from Kazan, he went to visit her and repented of his ways, but upon his return he started his old routine up again. The robber’s life gradually sucked him in. The most dangerous part of it was that Derzhavin somehow unintentionally became entangled with Maksimov, whose aﬀairs were anything but innocent. The ﬁrst adventure in which Derzhavin participated was more amusing than anything else and did not lead to any serious consequences. It began because of a deacon’s daughter. Maksimov and Bludov knew how to handle the fairer sex. The deacon’s daughter, who lived nearby, was in the habit of visiting them. One evening the deacon and his wife convinced the duty oﬃcers to keep an eye out for her. Bludov’s people, however, noticed that the policemen were hiding around the corner and asked them what they wanted. The conversation quickly turned into curses and the\n\nDerzhavin: A Biography\n\n\n\ncursing into a ﬁght. Using their superior numbers, Bludov’s henchmen beat up the policemen. But the police did not give up. Leaving the ﬁeld of battle, they lay in wait in the nettles near the church fence, where the girl would have to pass, and caught her.The deacon and deacon’s wife “tormented her with the lash and, on the advice of the police, ordered her to say that she had been at Sergeant Derzhavin’s.” The next day, when Derzhavin was returning from the Lands Board, he drove up to the gates in Bludov’s carriage. The duty police surrounded the carriage, grabbed the horses’ reins, and “without a word drove him through all of Moscow to the police.There they put him under guard with the other arrested men. He spent twenty-four hours in this state.The next morning he was taken to court. The judges began to question him and to try to get him to admit to shameful behavior with the girl and to marry her; but since there was no proof, either written or by witnesses, they could not establish that he had committed the crime of which he was accused; so, after dragging the investigation out for a week, they were forced to their discredit to release him.” This incident ended in laughter.The next was not as innocent, and although Derzhavin did not take an active part in it, the tale is still worth telling because it serves as a kind of prologue to later events. Moreover, in and of itself the tale is vivid and curious. During the short-lived "
