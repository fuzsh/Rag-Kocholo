Shearer, Vladimir Khaustov) - Free ebook download as PDF File (.pdf), Text File (.txt) or read book online for free. This document provides an overview of the Annals of Communism series, which publishes previously inaccessible documents from Soviet state and party archives. The series develops particular topics in the history of Soviet and international communism. Separate English and Russian editions are prepared by Russian and Western scholars working together. Documents are chosen for their historical importance rather than to support any single interpretation. The volumes are designed to be useful to students, scholars, and general readers interested in deepening their understanding of communism.",
