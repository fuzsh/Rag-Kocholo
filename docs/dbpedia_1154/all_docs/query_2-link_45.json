        "text": "The study examines the sermon discourse as a new discourse practice brought about by the language and cultural contacts in the 17th century in the Polish-Lithuanian State. The Polish texts by Piotr Skarga, Tomasz Młodzianowski, Franciczek Dzielowski and others exerted an impact on the lexis, type of text creation, communicative and stylistic features in the Ruthenian sermon in the 17th century. That impact prompted Antonii Radyvylovskyi to employ some Polonisms and Latinisms in diffeent parts of his sermons. The article traces lexical variability and its language and cultural ‘functionali-ty’ in the early book by A. Radyvylovskyi, one of the most famous preachers of the 17th century. The paper compares functioning of Polish and Latin (through Polish transmission) lexemes characterizing the discourse dimension of the 17th century lan-guage and cultural interference in the manuscript, the edited text, and the published book Vinets Khrystov (The Wreath of Christ). The number of such le...\n\nThis paper is devoted to the question of the spread of court sermons in 18th-century Russian society. The author describes three types that had been formed by the 1740s: court, seminary, and parish homilies. The main question is how and by what means did the court homilies in Elizabeth Petrovna’s time spread the cultural models, thoughts, and ideas created by court preachers throughout Russian society as a whole? Did these texts penetrate traditional culture and how were they adopted? Who read the court sermons, apart from members of the court? To answer these questions, the author describes how court homilies were published and sold, and how they entered the manuscript tradition. The analysis of archival and published materials allows the author to conclude that in the second half of the 18th century, the court sermon was only beginning to penetrate the “traditional” culture. The genre spread primarily in the seminaries, where texts by court preachers functioned as a “library” of panegyrical and theological elements to be used by students and teachers in their own compositions. With few exceptions, the court tradition does not intersect with texts originating from Old Russian and classical theological traditions, although all such texts are called slovo (literally ‘word,’ i.e., ‘sermon’). However, by the end of the 18th century, the new genre became more widely disseminated, following the spread of seminary education and the increase in the number of priests educated in this tradition.\n\nComplicated interconfessional relations at the end of XVI – the beginning of XVII century became perhaps the main reason of the development of Ukrainian literature. Earlier Ukraine Eastern Slavic region in general was dominated by the Orthodox Slavic religious and cultural tradition guided by Byzantine heritage. The fall of that state, difficult political situation in Orthodox Slavic regions, gradual expansion of Latin West to the East became a serious challenge for the subsequent existence of this tradition. In such circumstances the Ukrainian sermon of transitional type was born – a literary phenomenon of a kind, comprising peculiar traits of both Christian East and West.\n\nTaking a combined theoretical and empirical approach, this essay studies the rhetorical implications of speech-reporting strategies in medieval East Slavic hagiography and homiletics. The author argues for a pragmatic approach to the study of a particular rhetorical concept: enargeia ‘the power of language to create a vivid presence of that which is set forth in words’. The first part of the article outlines the constitutive characteristics of enargeia, based on its treatment in rhetorical handbooks of Classical and Late Antiquity and on the rhetorical practice. Part two moves on to discuss reported speech as one possible field of study for an investigation of the “pragmatics of enargeia” at work in medieval texts, with a view to demonstrating the relevance of central pragmatic categories for the study of what one could call “enargetic rhetoric”. Examples are taken from Nestor of the Caves’ Life of Feodosij (eleventh century) and Kirill of Turov’s sermons (late twelfth century).\n\nThe present paper deals with pre-sociolinguistic discourses that prepared the way for the emergence of Slavic social dialectology in the Russian (post)imperial space. Within the paradigm of ‘circulation of knowledge,’ the paper examines how the pre-sociolinguistic description of the social dialects of the urban underworld in Russia was fixated in literary works (notably in Krestovsky’s Slums of Petersburg) that built on French literary and scholarly models, in particular V. Hugo’s Les Misérables (1862). After the first Russian Revolution (1905), social dialectology, associated with languages of stigmatized groups and minorities, started to flourish and remained in vogue until the 1930s, when it was banned by the Soviet regime. As a result, social dialectology was cast back to the situation of the 19th century, when literature – in the Soviet context: samizdat and tamizdat – served as a lexicographical repository for languages of marginalized groups."
