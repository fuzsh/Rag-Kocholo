As such it uses the Cyrillic alphabet, which is in turn largely based upon that of the Greeks. The language is phonetic - pronounced as written, or 'as seen'. Translating into or from English gives rise to many problems and the vast majority of these arise because English is not a straightforward language, offering many pitfalls of pronunciation! Accordingly, Russian words must be translated through into a phonetic form of English and this can lead to different ways of helping the reader pronounce what he or she sees. Every effort has been made to standardise this, but inevitably variations will creep in. While reading from source to source this might seem confusing and/or inaccurate but it is the name as pronounced that is the constancy, not the spelling of that pronunciation! The 20th letter of the Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet looks very much like a 'Y' but is pronounced as a 'U' as in the word 'rule'. Another example, though not taken up in this work, is the train of thought that Russian words ending in 'y' are perhaps better spelt out as 'yi' to underline the pronunciation, but it is felt that most Western speakers would have problems getting their tongues around this! This is a good example of the sort of problem that some Western sources have suffered from in the past (and occasionally some get regurgitated even today) when they make the mental leap about what they see approximating to an English letter.\n\nMeasurements In the narrative, all measurements are given in Imperial figures (of British FPSR - foot, pound, second, Rankine) and then decimal units (or SI - Système International d'Unités, established in 1960) second in brackets. The states that comprised the Soviet Union embraced the decimal system from the earliest days, although it should be noted that power was measured up to the Great Patriotic War, and beyond, using the established Western horsepower measurement. The following explanations may help: aspect ratio wingspan and chord expressed as a ratio. Low aspect ratio, short, stubby wing; high aspect ratio, long, narrow wing. ft feet - length, multiply by 0.305 to get metres (m). For height measurements involving service ceilings and cruise heights, the figure has been 'rounded'. ft2 square feet - area, multiply by 0.093 to get square metres (m2). fuel measured in both gallons/litres and pounds/kilograms. The specific gravity (sg) of Soviet fuel varied considerably during the War and conversions from volume to weight and vice versa are impossible without knowing the sg of the fuel at the time. gallon Imperial (or UK) gallon, multiply by 4.546 to get litres. (500 Imperial gallons equal 600 US gallons.) hp horsepower - power, measurement of power for piston engines. Multiply by 0.746 to get kilowatts (kW). kg kilogram - weight, multiply by 2.205 to get pounds (Ib). kg/cm2 kilogram per square centimetre - force or pressure, multiply by 14.224 to get pounds per square inch (lb/in2). km kilometre - length, multiply by 0.621 to get miles. km/h kilometres per hour - velocity, multiply by 0.621 to get miles per hour (mph). kW kilowatt - power, measurement of power for piston engines. Multiply by 1.341 to get horse power. Ib pound - weight, multiply by 0.454 to get kilograms (kg). Also used for the force measurement of turbojet engines, with the same conversion factor, as pounds of static thrust.\n\nlb/ft2\n\nlitre m mile m2 mm\n\nmph\n\npounds per square foot - force or pressure, multiply by 4.882 to get kilograms per square metre (kg/m2). volume, multiply by 0.219 to get Imperial (or UK) gallons. metre - length, multiply by 3.28 to get feet (ft). Imperial length, multiply by 1.609 to get kilometres (km). square metre - area, multiply by 10.764 to get square feet (ft2) millimetre - length, the bore of guns is traditionally a decimal measure (eg 30mm) and no Imperial conversion is given. miles per hour - velocity, multiply by 1.609 to get kilometres per hour (km/h).\n\nDesign and Illustration considerations In this work we have utilised our well-proven format, aiming as always to provide a high level of readability and design. A conscious decision was made to include peripheral details where they appear on the original illustrations; photographs have not been printed across the fold and cropping has been kept to an absolute minimum. Unfortunately, in this work, many of the photographs received were copies of those from official sources and proved to be lacking in definition and tonal range. Although no effort has been spared to achieve the highest standard of reproduction, priority for inclusion has, of necessity, been given to historical significance over technical perfection.\n\n5\n\nSOVIET X-PLANES\n\nIntroduction\n\nF\n\nor over 70 years from 1918 the world's largest country was tightly controlled by a tiny group of elderly men in The Kremlin, in Moscow. Their power was absolute. They could take giant decisions, and so could make giant mistakes. They also sometimes found they had to choose between diametrically opposed objectives. While on the one hand aviation was a marvellous instrument for propaganda, trumpeting the achievements of the Soviet Union, the underlying theme of Soviet society was of rigid secrecy. Thus, when The Great Patriotic War began on 22nd June 1941 the outside world knew very little about Soviet aircraft. The knowledge was confined largely to the mass-produced Polikarpov biplane fighters and Tupolev monoplane bombers, and to the ANT-25 monoplane designed to break world distance records. Only very gradually did it become apparent that the austere and sombre Land of the Soviets (this was the name of a recordbreaking bomber) was home to an incredible diversity of aircraft. Other countries - the USA, France, Britain, Italy and increasingly Germany - had numerous aircraft companies from which flowed many hundreds of different types of aircraft. They also had individuals who sometimes managed to create aircraft and even form tiny companies, but the aircraft were invariably conventional lightplanes aimed at the private owner. Few people in what became called The West' would have dreamed that in Stalin's realm individuals could even set their sights on high-powered fast aircraft bristling with strange ideas.\n\n6\n\nAt the same time, the Soviet Union was far from being the earthly paradise that was originally intended. It is said that power corrupts, and the record shows that anyone who 'stuck his head above the parapet' was likely to get it cut off. It seems incredible that in 1936-40 Stalin should have been able to unleash what was called The Terror, in which anyone who might have posed the slightest threat - for example, any senior officer in any of the armed forces - was simply put through a show trial on invented charges and shot. In the aircraft industry, time after time people who made mistakes, or in some way fell foul of someone more senior, were simply dismissed or even imprisoned (and in a few cases, executed). It is beyond question that this omnipresent air of repression did much to counter the natural enthusiasm of countless workers who longed for their country to be the greatest on Earth, and a leader in advanced technology. When one reads what happened it seems remarkable that so many diverse aircraft actually got built. This book is the most comprehensive attempt yet to collect the stories of the more important of these X-Planes (experimental aircraft) into one volume. Of course, some of the strange flying machines featured were built after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but we did not want a ponderous title. Translation of the Communist state into an intensely capitalist one has tended to concentrate the mind wonderfully. Whereas 60 years ago Soviet designers could obtain funds for often bizarre ideas which a hard-nosed financial director would have considered an almost\n\ncertain non-starter, today Ivan at his modern keyboard and screen knows that if he gets it wrong his shaky firm will go out of business. Ironically, instead of being a closely guarded secret, the experimental aircraft and projects of the Soviet Union are today better documented than those of many Western companies. The process of rationalization has seen almost all the famous names of the aircraft industries of the UK, USA and France disappear. In many cases, and especially in the UK, their irreplaceable archives have been wantonly destroyed, as being of no interest to current business. We may never know what strange things their designers drew on paper but never saw built. In contrast, the Soviet Union never destroyed anything, unless there was a political reason for doing so. Accordingly, though this book concentrates on hardware, it also includes many projects which were built but never flew, and even a few which never got off the proverbial drawing board. As in several previous books, Yefim Gordon provided much information and most of the illustrations while Bill Gunston wrote the text and put the package together. The in-flight photograph of the MiG 1.44 featured on the jacket is from a Mikoyan video. A special vote of thanks is due to Nigel Eastaway and the Russian Aviation Research Trust who provided the remainder of the visual images.\n\nSukhoi S-37 experimental fighter.\n\nA L E K S E Y E V I-2 1 8\n\nSOVIET X-PLANES Arranged principally in alphabetical order\n\nAlekseyevI-218 Purpose: To provide a high-performance Shturmovik, armoured ground-attack aircraft. Design Bureau: Semyon Mikhailovich Alekseyev OKB-21, at Gorkii. Born in 1909, Alekseyev graduated from MAI in 1937, and became one of the principal designers in the OKB of S A Lavochkin. Responsible for major features of the LaGG-3 and La-5 family of fighters, he was head of detail design on the derived La-7 and La-9. In 1946 he was able to open his own design bureau. He at once concentrated on twin-jet fighters with nosewheel landing gear, getting the\n\nI-211 into flight test on 13th October 1947. Whilst working on derived aircraft with more powerful engines and swept wings, he worked in parallel on a family of multirole groundattack aircraft. The first of these was the I-218, or I-218-1. For various reasons, the most important being the need for long endurance at low altitude, Alekseyev adopted a powerful piston engine. He adopted a pusher layout, with the tail carried on twin booms. A single prototype was completed in summer 1948, but in August of that year OKB-21 was closed. (A contributory factor was Yakovlev's scathing comment that Alekseyev's jet\n\nfighters were copies of the Me 262.) At closure three derived aircraft were on the drawing board. The I-218-Ib (I-219) had a revised crew compartment, tailwheel landing gears and swept vertical tails. The I-218-11 (I-221) was an enlarged aircraft with a conventional fuselage and tail, powered by a Lyul'ka TR-3 turbojet, which was being developed to give 4,600kg (10,141 Ib) thrust. The I-218-III (I-220) was a variation on the 218-11 with a very powerful piston engine (he hoped to get a Dobrynin VD-4 of 4,000hp, as used in the Tu-85 but without the turbo). Alekseyev was sent to CAHI (TsAGI) and then as Chief Constructor to the OKB-1 team of former German (mainly\n\nAlekseyev I-218\n\n7\n\nALEKSEYEV\n\nI-218\n\nI-218 inboard profile\n\nJunkers) engineers to produce the Type 150, described later under OKB-1. No detailed documents have been discovered, but the I-218 was a modern all-metal stressed-skin aircraft designed to a high (fighter type) load factor. The wing comprised a centre section and outer panels joined immediately outboard of the tail booms. It was tapered on the leading edge only, and on the trailing edge were fitted outboard ailerons and six sections of area-increasing flap. The tail booms projected far in front of the wing, and carried a conventional twin-finned tail with a fixed tailplane joining the fins just above the centreline of the propeller. The forward fuselage contained a compartment for the pilot and for the aft-facing gunner. Like some highly-stressed parts of the airframe this was made of the new 30KhGSNA chrome-nickel steel, and it was thick enough to form a 'bathtub' to protect against armour-piercing shells of 20mm calibre. The windows were very thick multilayer glass/plastics slabs. The engine, mounted on\n\nthe wing, was a Dobrynin VM-251 (in effect, half a VD-4, with three banks each of four cylinders) rated at 2,000hp. It drove an AV-28 contra-rotating propeller arranged for pusher propulsion, comprising two three-blade units each of 3.6m (11ft l0in) diameter. The I-218 was intended to have heavy forward-firing armament, such as four NR-23 guns each with 150 rounds or two N-57 (30 rounds each) and two N-37 (40 rounds each). In addition provision was to be made for up to 1,500kg (3,307 Ib) of bombs or other stores, carried mainly under the fuselage, or six 132mm (5.2in) rockets or 16 RS-82 rockets carried under the wings. For defence, the backseater could operate a remotely-sighted system controlling an NR-23 cannon on the outer side of each tail boom. Each of these powerful guns was fed from a 120-round magazine, and was mounted in a powered barbette with angular limits of ±25° vertically and 50° outwards. Avionics included 12RSU-10 radio, RPKO-10M radiocompass, RV-2 radar altimeter and SPU-5 intercom.\n\nThough the I-218 was built there is no positive evidence that it flew, apart from the fact that the specification does not include the word 'estimated' for the flight performance. The fact is, in 1948 such aircraft were regarded as obsolescent. A rival, also abandoned, was the IL-20, described later.\n\nDimensions Span Length Wing area\n\n16.43m 13.88m 45m 2\n\n53 ft M in 45 ft &A in 484.4ft2\n\nWeights (unknown except) Normal loaded weight 9,000kg Maximum 10,500kg\n\n1 9,840 Ib 23,1 48 Ib\n\nPerformance Max speed, at sea level at 2,000m (6,562 ft) Take-off run Landing run Time to reach 5,000 m Service ceiling Range\n\n289 mph 329 mph 1,706ft 1,969ft 16,400ft 21,650ft 746 miles\n\n465km/h 530km/h 520m 600m 5min 6,000 m 1,200km\n\nAbove: I-218 model.\n\nLeft: Alekseyev's ground-attack aircraft projects, from the top -I-218-IB, I-218-IIandI-218-III.\n\n8\n\nANTONOV LEM-2\n\nAntonov LEM-2 Purpose: To investigate the maximum load that could be carried by an aeroplane powered by a single M-l 1 engine.

AviAvnito and Osoaviakhim (the Society of Friends of Aviation and the Chemical Industry) provided funds in 1936, enabling the Kiev (Ukraine) constructor to create his first powered aircraft. The single example built was given the OKB designation of OKA-33, because it was their 33rd design. The flight-test programme was opened by test pilot N I Ferosyev on 20th April 1937. Results were satisfactory. The LEM-2 was predictably almost a flying wing, based on the aerodynamics of Prof V N Belyayev, with a PZ-2 aerofoil modified from the common CAHI (TsAGI) R-ll. The M-l 1 five-cylinder radial, rated at l00hp, was mounted on the front in a long-chord cowl-\n\ning, driving a two-blade carved-wood propeller of the type mass-produced for the U-2 (later called Po-2). Construction was almost entirely wood, with ply skins of varying thickness. The wing comprised a centre section and two outer panels with long-span but narrow ailerons. The inboard part of the wing had a chord of 6.7m (22ft) and so was deep enough (1.47m, 4ft 1 0in) to house the payload of 1,280kg (2,822 Ib). The payload compartment between the spars measured 2.4 x 1.5 x 1.2m (7'101/2\"x4'll\"x3'll\"). In the LEM-2 built the pilot was the only occupant, though it was the intention that a production aircraft should have provision for 11 passenger seats. Access to the main payload space was to be via large doors in the leading edge ahead of the front spar, but these were absent from the LEM-2 built. There was also a door in the upper surface behind the cockpit. The twinfinned tail was carried on two upswept booms attached at the extremities of the wing centre section. Landing gears comprised two main wheels (the intended spats were never fitted) attached to the centre-section end ribs,\n\nand a skid under the trailing edge. Development of aircraft in this class was soon discontinued, it being decided they were of limited practical use. In fact, especially with slightly more power, they could have been used in the USSR in large numbers in huge regions devoid of roads and railways.\n\nDimensions Span\n\n27.6m\n\n90 ft &/> in\n\n10.6m 81.4m 2\n\n34 ft 9M in\n\nWeight empty Maximum loaded\n\n1,640kg 2,920 kg\n\n3,61 6 Ib 6,437 Ib\n\nPerformance Maximum speed\n\n117km/h\n\n72.7 mph\n\nl00km/h 1,500m 900km\n\n62 mph\n\nLength Wing area\n\n876ft 2\n\nWeights\n\nCruising speed Service ceiling Intended range\n\n4,920ft 559 miles\n\nAntonov LEM-2\n\n9\n\nANTONOV LEM-2\n\nTwo views of the LEM-2, OKA-33.\n\nFront and side views of KT assembled on tank.\n\n10\n\nA N T O N O V A-40, KT / A N T O N O V\n\nAntonov A-40, KT Purpose: KT, Kryl'ya Tanka, flying tank, a means for delivering armoured vehicles to difficult locations by fitting them with wings. Design Bureau: Oleg Konstantinovich Antonov, at Kiev. From 1932 the Soviet high command studied all aspects of the new subject of airborne warfare, including parachute troops and every kind of aerial close support of armies. One novel concept was fitting wings (with or without propulsion) to an armoured vehicle. Simple tests were carried out with small cars and trucks, converted into gliders and towed by such aircraft as the R-5 and (it is believed) a TB-1. There was even a project to fit wings to a T-34, weighing 32 tonnes, using a pair of ANT-20b/s as tugs ! The KT was the only purpose-designed winged tank actually to be tested. The chosen tank was the T-60, specially designed for airborne forces. Antonov designed a large biplane glider and flight controls to fit over the tank. The work was delayed by the German invasion of 22nd June 1941, but the prototype\n\nwas ready for test in early 1942. The selected pilot, S N Anokhin, did a quick course in tank driving and was then towed off by a TB-3. He managed to land without injuring himself or overturning the tank, which was drivable afterwards. The glider was officially designated A-T, and A-40 by the Antonov OKB. It comprised rectangular biplane wings joined by vertical and diagonal struts with wire bracing. Both wings were fitted with ailerons, joined by vertical struts. The upper wing also had two spoiler airbrakes, while the lower wing had full-span flaps which the pilot (who was the tank driver) could pull down manually prior to the landing. At the rear was the twin-finned semi-biplane tail, attached by two braced booms. Construction was of wood, mainly spruce. The covering was fabric, with plywood over the booms and some other areas. The airframe was lifted by crane over the tank and secured by latches. The towrope from the tug was attached to the tank, and cast off by the tank driver when close to the target. The intention was that he should glide down\n\nsteeply, lower the flaps and then, when about to touch the ground, pull a lever to jettison the glider portion. The tank would then be left ready for action. The tank's tracks were driven through an overdrive top gear to assist take-off and smooth the landing. Though the single test flight was successful, Anokhin, an outstandingly skilled pilot, found his task extremely tricky. He doubted the ability of ordinary 'tankers' to fly the loaded tank and bring it down to a successful landing. In any case, the real need was to fly in T-34s, and there seemed to be no practical way of doing this.

Design Bureau: No 153, Oleg K Antonov, Novosibirsk. In 1945 Antonov was impressed by the German He 162, and considered it a good way to produce a simple fighter for rough-field use powered by a single turbojet. In spring 1947 his staff had completed the design of the SKh (later designated An-2), and he quickly schemed a fighter to be powered by a single RD-10 (Soviet-made Junkers Jumo 004B) above the fuselage. He tested a tunnel model, but on 6th April 1947 received an instruction from NKAP (the state commissariat for aviation industry) to design a fighter with two RD-lOs. By this time he had recognized that jet engines not only made possible unconventional new configurations for fighters but might even demand them. He quickly roughed out the Masha, abbreviated as the 'M'. A A Batumov and V A Dominikovskiy were appointed chief designers, with 11 Yegorychev in charge of construction. Design was virtually complete when in late 1947 the NKAP instructed OKB-153 to redesign the aircraft to use the RD-45, the Soviet-built copy of the Rolls-Royce Nene. Apart from the forward fuselage, the redesign was total. Following tunnel testing of models, and free-flight testing of the E-153 (which was used as both a detailed full-scale wooden mock-up and a towed glider), construction of the M prototype went ahead rapidly. In July 1948, when the prototype was almost ready, and Mark L Gallai was about to begin flight testing, the project was cancelled. The La, MiG and Yak jet fighters were thought sufficient. (In 1953 Antonov again schemed a jet fighter, this time a tailed delta powered by an AL-7F, but it remained on paper.) The original 1947 form of the Masha featured side inlets to the RD10 engines buried in the thick central part of the wing. Outboard were\n\nModel of the 1947 jet fighter project.\n\nbroad wings tapered on the leading edge with squared-off tips carrying swept fins and rudders. Beyond these were small forward-swept ailerons. The main wing had leading-edge flaps and aft spoilers. Having studied side doors to the cockpit, Antonov settled for a sliding canopy. Armament comprised two VYa-23 and two B-20. This armament remained unchanged in the M actually built, which had a single RD-45, rated at 2,270kg (5,000 Ib) fed by cheek inlets. The wing was redesigned as a round-tipped delta, with the swept vertical tails positioned between two pairs of tabbed elevons. Antonov considered that the final M ought to have been allowed to fly. He considered it would have dramatically outmanoeuvred any contemporary competition, and could later have had radar and a more powerful engine. 11\n\nANTONOV M\n\nDimensions (data 194 7) Span Length Dimensions (data 1948) Span Length No other data.\n\nThe E-153 glider.\n\nOriginal scheme for M, 1947\n\nDefinitive M, 1948\n\n12\n\n10.8m 10.6m\n\n35 ft 5 in 34 ft 914 in\n\n9.3m 10.64m\n\n30 ft &/, in 34 ft \\Q3/, in\n\nA N T O N O V 1 81\n\nAntonov 181 Purpose: To explore the Custer channelwing concept. Design Bureau: Oleg K Antonov, Kiev, Ukraine. Little is known about this research aircraft, other than what could be gleaned by walking round it on 18th August 1990 and reading the accompanying placard. Its one public outing was on Soviet Day of Aviation, and the venue the airfield at the village of Gastomel, near Kiev. The configuration was instantly recognisable as being that of the 'channel-wing' aircraft proposed by American W R Custer in the mid-1950s. The key factor of this concept was powered lift gained by confining the propeller slipstream in a 180° half-barrel of aerofoil profile. Custer claimed the ability to take off and climb almost vertically, or to hover, whilst retaining full forward speed capability. Resurrecting the Custer concept was astonishing, as the claims for the channel-wing aircraft were soon shown to be nonsense, and instead of 1958 being the start of mass-production of the CCW-5 series version the whole thing faded from view. It was thus totally unexpected when the '181' appeared at an Open Day hosted by the Antonov OKB. It was not just parked on the grass but tied down on a trailer. Visitors were able to climb on to this and study the aircraft intimately, but there was nobody to answer questions. The '181' was dominated by its two Custerinspired channel wings, with aerofoil lifting surfaces curved round under the propellers so that they were washed by the slipstream. Whereas the Custer CCW-5 had pusher propellers above the trailing edge, the Antonov aircraft had tractor propellers above the leading edge. They were driven via shafts and gears by a 210hp Czech M-337A six-cylinder aircooled piston engine. Apart from this the aircraft appeared conventional, though the tail was of 'butterfly' configuration to keep it out of the slipstream, and of exceptional size in order to remain effective at very low airspeeds. Beyond the channel wings were small outer wings with ailerons. The nose was fighter-like, with a large canopy over the side-by-side cockpit, and the tricycle landing gear was fixed. The nose carried a long instrumentation boom, and there was a dorsal antenna, presumably for telemetry. The whole aircraft was beautifully finished, and painted in house colours with the Antonov logo. It bore Soviet flags on the fins, and civil registration SSSR-190101.\n\nConstruction of this research aircraft must have been preceded by testing of models. These must have given encouraging results, which were not reproduced in the '181'. Coauthor Gunston asked Antonov leaders about the '181' and was told that it had been a serious project, but perhaps ought not to have been put on view.\n\nDimensions Span 7.3m Length 7.31m Wing area (total projected) 7.0m 2\n\n23 ft m in 23 ft 11% in 75ft 2\n\nWeights Weight loaded (normal) (maximum)\n\n820kg 900kg\n\nl,8081b l,9841b\n\nPerformance Maximum speed (placard) Range (placard)\n\n820 km/h 750km\n\n510 mph 466 miles\n\nThree photographs of the An-181\n\n13\n\nA R K H A N G E L S K I Y BSH/M-V B A R T I N I S T A L ' - G , E l A N D STAL'-S\n\nArkhangelskiy BSh/M-V Purpose: To destroy enemy armour. Design Bureau: A A Arkhangelskiy (Tupolev aide), with G M Mozharovskiy and IV Venevidov, Factory No 32, Moscow. The idea was that of Mozharovskiy-Venevidov, who called their project the Kombain (combine) because of its versatility. They were long-time specialists in aircraft armament, among other things being responsible for all the early gun turrets in the Soviet Union. Arkhangelskiy increased their political power and got them a separate design office and factory for what became called the BSh (armoured assaulter, the same designation as the Ilyushin Stormovik) and also KABV (combined artillery-bomber weapon). The eskiznyi proekt (sketch project) was submitted on 29th December 1940, long-lead materials were sanctioned on 25th January 1941 and the project was confirmed at the NIl-WS by AIFilin on 12th March 1941. Despite being (on paper) superior, it was terminated in the evacuation of the designers from Moscow to Kirov later in 1941, all effort being put into the Ilyushin aircraft (which was built in greater numbers than any other aircraft in history). The whole emphasis in the M-V project was giving the pilot (the only occupant) the best possible view ahead over the nose. Whereas\n\nthe engine of the IL-2 Sturmovik blocked off the view at a downwards angle of 8°, the M-V aircraft gave the pilot a downwards view of 30°. This is because the engine (the l,625hp AM-38, the same as the IL-2) was behind the cockpit. The tail was carried on twin booms and the landing gear was of the then-novel nosewheel type. Many armament schemes were planned, including one Taubin 23mm gun and four ShKAS, or four ShVAK, all mounted on pivots to fire diagonally down. Up to 500kg of bombs could also be carried, mainly to comprise AO-20 or AO-25 fragmentation bomblets. On the basis of written evidence this aircraft would have been a better tank killer than the Ilyushin machine. The drawback was that\n\nwhen the Ilyushin suffered heavy attrition from German fighters a backseater was put in to defend it, and this would have been difficult with the BSh/M-V.

Design Bureau: SNII, at Factory No 240. One of the few aircraft designers to emigrate to (not from) the infant Soviet Union was Roberto Lodovico Bartini. A fervent Communist, he chose to leave his native Italy in 1923 when the party was proscribed by Mussolini. By 1930 he was an experienced aircraft designer, and qualified pilot, working at the Central Construction Bureau. In April of that year he proposed the creation of the fastest aircraft possible. In the USSR he had always suffered from being 'foreign', even though he had taken Soviet citizenship, and nothing was done for 18 months until he managed to enlist the help of P I Baranov, head of the RKKA (Red Army) and M N Tukhachevskii (head of RKKA armament). They went to Y Y Anvel't, a deputy head at the GUGVF (main directorate of civil aviation), who got Bartini established at the SNII (GVF scientific test institute). Work began here in 1932, the aircraft being designated Stal' (steel) 6, as one of a series of ex14\n\nperimental aircraft with extensive use of hightensile steels in their airframes. After successful design and construction the Stal'-6 was scheduled for pre-flight testing (taxi runs at increasing speed) in the hands of test pilot Andrei Borisovich Yumashev. On the very first run he 'sensed the lightness of the controls., .which virtually begged to be airborne'. He pulled slightly back on the stick and the aircraft took off, long before its scheduled date. The awesomely advanced aircraft proved to be straightforward to fly, but the engine cooling system suffered a mechanical fault and the first landing was in a cloud of steam. Yumashev was reprimanded by Bartini for not adhering to the programme, but testing continued. Yumashev soon became the first pilot in the USSR to exceed 400km/h, and a few days later a maximum-speed run confirmed 420km/h (261 mph), a national speed record. One of Bartini's few friends in high places was Georgei K Ordzhonikidze, People's Commissar for Heavy Industries. In November 1933, soon after the Stal'-6 (by this time called the El, experimental fighter) had\n\nshown what it could do, he personally ordered Bartini to proceed with a fighter derived from it. This, the Stal'-8, was quickly created in a separate workshop at Factory 240, and was thus allocated the Service designation of I-240. Hearing about the Stal'-6's speed, Tukhachevskii called a meeting at the Main Naval Directorate which was attended by many high-ranking officers, including heads from GUAP (Main Directorate of Aviation Production), the WS (air force), RKKA and SNII GVF. The meeting was presided over by Klementi Voroshilov (People's Commissar for Army and Navy) and Ordzhonikidze. At this time the fastest WS fighter, the I-5, reached 280km/h. The consensus of the meeting was that 400km/h was impossible. Many engineers, including AAMikulin, designer of the most powerful Soviet engines, demonstrated or proved that such a speed was not possible. When confronted by the Stal'-6 test results, and Comrade Bartini himself, the experts were amazed. They called for State Acceptance tests (not previously required on experimental aircraft). These began\n\nB A R T I N I STAL'-G, A N D STAL'-S\n\nTop: Stal'-6. Centre: Three views of the StaP-6. Bottom: Inboard profile of Stal'-6.\n\n15\n\nB A R T I N I STAL'-G, A N D STAL'-8 in the hands of Pyotr M Stefanovskii on 8th June 1934 (by which time the fast I-16 monoplane fighter was flying, reaching 359km/h). On 17th June the Stal'-6 was handed to the Nil WS (air force scientific research institute), where it was thoroughly tested by Stevanovskiy and N V Ablyazovskiy. They did not exceed 365km/h, because they found that at higher speeds they needed to exert considerable strength to prevent the aircraft from rolling to port (an easily cured fault). On 13th July the landing-gear indicator lights became faulty and, misled, Stefanovskii landed with the main wheel retracted. The aircraft was repaired, and the rolling tendency cured. Various modifications were made to make the speedy machine more practical as a fighter. For example the windscreen was fastened in the up position and the pilot's seat in the raised position. After various refinements Stefanovskii not only achieved 420km/h but expressed his belief that with a properly tuned engine a speed 25-30km/h higher than this might be reached. The result was that fighter designers - Grigorovich, Polikarpov, Sukhoi and even Bartini himself - were instructed to build fighters much faster than any seen hitherto. Bartini continued working on the StaP-8, a larger and more practical machine than the Stal'-6, with an enclosed cockpit with a forward-sliding hood, two ShKAS machine guns and an advanced stressed-skin airframe. The engine was to be the 860hp Hispano-Suiza HS12Ybrs, with which a speed of 630km/h (391 mph) was calculated. Funds were allocated, the Service designation of the Stal'-8 being I-240. This futuristic fighter might have been a valuable addition to the WS, but Bartini's origins were still remembered even in the mid-1930s, and someone managed to get funding for the Stal'-8 withdrawn. One reason put forward was vulnerability of the steam cooling system. In May 1934 the I-240 was abandoned, with the prototype about 60 per cent complete. Everything possible was done to reduce drag. The cantilever wing had straight taper and slight dihedral (existing drawings incorrectly show a horizontal upper surface). The two spars were made from KhMA (chromemolybdenum steel) tubes, each spar comprising seven tubes of 16.5mm diameter at the root, tapering to three at mid-semi-span and ending as a single tube of 18mm diameter towards the tip. The ribs were assembled from Enerzh-6 (stainless) rolled strip. Ailerons, flaps and tail surfaces were assembled from steel pressings, with Percale fabric skin. The flaps were driven manually, and when they were lowered the ailerons drooped 5°. Bartini invented an aileron linkage which adjusted stick force according to indicated airspeed (this was resurrected ten years later by the Central Aero-Hydrodynamic Institute as their 16\n\nown idea). The fuselage was likewise based on a framework of welded KhMA steel tubes. Ahead of the cockpit the covering comprised unstressed panels of magnesium alloy, the aft section being moulded plywood. In flight the cockpit was part-covered by a glazed hood flush with the top of the fuselage, giving the pilot a view to each side only. For take-off and landing the hood could be hinged upwards, while the seat was raised by a winch and cable mechanism. Likewise the landing gear was based on a single wheel on the centreline, with an 800 x 200mm tyre, mounted on two struts with rubber springing. The pilot could unlock this and raise it into an AMTs (light alloy) box between the rudder pedals. For some reason the fuselage skin on each side of this bay was corrugated. The wheel bay was normally enclosed by a door which during the retraction cycle was first opened to admit the wheel and then closed. Extension was by free-fall, finally assisted by the cable until the unit locked. Under the outer wings were hinged support struts, likewise retracted to the rear by cable. When extended, each strut could rotate back on its pivot against a spring. Under the tail was a skid with a rubber shock absorber. The engine was an imported Curtiss Conqueror V-15 70 rated at 630hp, driving a two-blade metal propeller with a large spinner (photographs show that at least two different propellers were fitted). This massive vee-12 engine was normally water-cooled, but Bartini boldly adopted a surface-evaporation steam cooling system. The water in the engine was allowed to boil, and the steam flowed into the leading edges of the wings which were covered by a double skin from the root to the aileron. Each leading edge was electrically spot- and seam-welded, with a soldering agent, to form a sealed box with a combined internal area of 12.37m2 (133ft2).\n\nEach leading edge was attached to the upper and lower front tubes of the front spar. Inside, the steam, under slight pressure, condensed back into water which was then pumped back to the engine. The system was not designed for prolonged running, and certainly not with the aircraft parked. Bartini succeded brilliantly in constructing the fastest aircraft built at that time in the Soviet Union. At the same time he knew perfectly well that the Stal'-6 was in no way a practical machine for the WS. The unconventional landing gear appeared to work well, and even the evaporative cooling system was to be perpetuated in the I-240 fighter (but that was before the Stal'-6 had flown). Whether the I-240 would have succeded in front-line service is doubtful, but it was the height of folly to cancel it.

Design: SNII GVF; construction at GAZ (Factory) No 81, Moscow Tushino. In the winter 1933-34 the GUGVF (chief administration of the civil air fleet) issued a requirement for a fast transport aircraft to carry 10 to 12 passengers. Curiously, the two prototypes built to meet this demand were both the work of immigrant designers, the Frenchman Laville (with ZIG-1) and the Italian Bartini. The latter had already produced drawings for a transport to cruise at 400km/h (248mph), which was well in advance of what the GVF had in mind. Always captivated by speed, Stalin decreed that a bomber version should be designed in parallel. Still in charge of design at the SNII GVF, Bartini refined his study into the Stal'-7, the name reflecting its steel construction. Strongly influenced by the Stalin decree, Bartini created a transport notable for its cramped and inconvenient fuselage, highly\n\nunsuitable for passengers but excellent for bombs, and for long-range flight. The original structure was to be typical Bartini welded steel-tube trusses with fabric covering, but the stress calculations were impossibly difficult, with 200 primary rigid welded intersections between tubes of different diameters. In late 1934 the fuselage was redesigned as a light-alloy stressed-skin structure, with simpler connections to the unchanged wing. Only one aircraft was built, in the workshops of ZOK, the factory for GVF experimental construction. The first flight was made on an unrecorded date in autumn 1936, the pilot being N P Shebanov. Performance was outstanding, and Shebanov proposed attempting a round-the-world flight. In 1937 the StaP-7 was fitted with 27 fuel tanks with a total capacity of 7,400 litres (1,628 Imperial gallons, 1,955 US gallons). A maximum-range flight was then attempted, but - possibly because of structural failure of a landing gear - the aircraft crashed on take-off. Bartini was arrested, and was in detention (but still designing, initially at OKB-4, Omsk) for 17 years.\n\nThe aircraft was repaired, and on 28th August 1939, at a slightly reduced weight, successfully made a closed-circuit flight of 5,068km (3,149 miles) in 12hrs Slmin (average speed 404.936km/h, 251.62mph), to set an FAI Class record. The route was Moscow Tushino-Maloe Brusinskoe (Sverdlovsk region)-Sevastopol-Tushino, and the crew comprised Shebanov, copilot VAMatveyev and radio/navigator N A Baikuzov. In Bartini's absence, the project was seized by his opportunist co-worker V G Yermolayev, who redesigned it into the outstanding DB-240 and Yer-2 long-range bomber. The wing was typical Bartini, with pronounced straight taper and construction from complex spars built up from multiple steel tubes, almost wholly with fabric covering. Each wing comprised a very large centre section, with depth almost as great as that of the fuselage, terminating just beyond the engine nacelles 2.8m (9ft 2/4in) from the centreline, with sharp anhedral, and thinner outer panels with dihedral. The trailing edges carried split flaps and Frise ailerons, the left aileron having\n\n17\n\nB A R T I N I STAL'-? a trim tab. One account says that the invertedgull shape 'improved stability and provided a cushion effect which reduced take-off and landing distance', but its only real effect was to raise the wing on the centreline from the low to the mid position. Stal'-7\n\nThis was just what the fuselage did not need, because the massive deep spars formed almost impassable obstructions and eliminated any possibility of using the aircraft as a passenger airliner. The fuselage was a light-alloy structure, with an extremely\n\ncramped cross-section with sides sloping in towards the top (almost a round-cornered triangle). Entry was via a very small door on the left of the rear fuselage. The cockpit in the nose seated pilots side by side, and had a glazed canopy with sliding side windows and the then-fashionable forward-raked windscreen. Immediately behind the cockpit there was a station for the navigator/radio operator. The tail surfaces, made of dural/fabric, were of low aspect ratio, the elevators having tabs. The engines were the 760hp M-100, these being the initial Soviet licence-built version derived by V Ya Klimov from the HispanoSuiza 12Ybrs. They were installed in neat cowlings at the outer ends of the centre section, angled slightly outwards and driving propellers with three metal blades which could have pitch adjusted on the ground. One account states that wing-surface radiators were used, but it is obvious from photographs that ordinary frontal radiators were fitted, as in the Tupolev SB bomber. Plain exhaust stubs were fitted, though this may have scorched the wing fabric and one drawing shows exhaust pipes discharging above the wing. In the course of 1938-39 the original engines were replaced by the derived M-103, rated at 860hp, which improved performance with heavy fuel loads. A hydraulic system was provided to operate the flaps and the fully retractable main landing gears, each unit of which had a strong pair of main legs which hinged at mid-length, the unit then swinging back on twin forward radius arms (like a DC3 back-to-front). The castoring tailwheel was fixed. In the nose were twin landing lights. The Stal'-7 was simply a sound aeroplane able to fly at what was in its day a very long way at high speed. As a transport it was inconvenient to the point of being useless, though it was supposed to be able to seat 12 passengers, and it was flawed by its basic layout and structure. The Soviet Union was right to take a licence for the Douglas DC-3. On the other hand, Yermolayev transformed the Stal'-7 into an outstanding long-range bomber.

Design Bureau: TANTK named for G M Beriev Taganrog. Ever one to consider radical solutions, Bartini spent part of 1959 scheming a giant marine vehicle called M. Seaborne at rest, this was to be able to rise from the water and fly at high speed over long distances. It was to make true flights at high altitude, but also have the capability of 'flying' just above the sea surface. Such a vehicle was initially seen as urgently needed to destroy US Navy Polarismissile submarines, but it could have many other applications. The idea was refined into one called 2500, from its weight in tonnes, and ultimately designated M-62 or MVA-62. TANTK Beriev investigated stability, control and performance of the proposed configuration with the small Be-1. This looked vaguely like a jet fighter, with a front cockpit, large centroplan (central wing) with a turbojet on top, twin floats, outer wings and twin fins and rudders. Under each float was a surfacepiercing V-type hydrofoil, which was not to be a feature of the full-scale vehicle. Pending funding for this monster, TANTK Beriev were ordered to build three WA-14 prototypes, this being a practical basis for a multirole vehicle. Missions were to include sea/air search and rescue, defence against all kinds of hostile submarines and surface warships, and patrol around the Soviet coastlines. Production craft were to be kept at readiness on coastal airfields. The vehicle was classed as an amphibious aircraft. It was to be developed in three phases. The WA-14M1 was to be an aerodynamics and technology test-bed, initially with rigid pontoons on the ends of the centroplan, and later with these replaced by PVPU inflatable pontoons (which took years to develop). The WA-14M2 was to be more advanced, with two extra main engines to blast under the centroplan to give lift and later with a battery of lift engines to give VTOL capability, and with fly-by-wire flight controls. The third stage would see the VTOL vehicle fully equipped with armament and with the Burevestnik computerised ASW (anti-submarine warfare) system, Bor-1 MAD (magneticanomaly detection) and other operational equipment. Following very extensive research, and tests with simulators, the first vehicle, Nol9172, was completed as an aeroplane. It was tested at the Taganrog WS flying school, which had a concrete runway. Accompanied\n\nby numerous engineers, including deputy chief designer Nikolai A Pogorelov, the test crew of Yu M Kupriyanov and navigator/systems engineer L F Kuznetsov opened the flight test programme with a conventional take-off on 4th September 1972. The only problem was serious vibration of hydraulic pipes, which resulted in total loss of fluid from one of the two systems. In 1974 the PVPU inflatable pontoons were at last installed, though their expansion and retraction caused many problems. Flotation and water taxi tests followed, culminating in the start of flight testing of the amphibious aircraft on 11 th June 1975. Everyone was amazed that Bartini was proved correct in his belief that the rubber/fabric pontoons would retain their shape at high airspeeds. On water they were limited to 36km/h, so later they were replaced by rigid pontoons, with skegs (axial strakes). The forward fuselage was lengthened and the starting (cushion-blowing) engines added. On the debit side, Bartini was also right in predicting that the Lotarev bureau would never deliver the intended battery of 12 RD-36-35PR lift engines, and this made the second and third prototypes redundant. Bartini died in 1974, and the now truncated programme continued with trickle funding. The blowing engines caused resonance which resulted in breakage of landing-gear doors and buffeting of the rear control flaps. The vehicle never flew again, but did carry out manoeuvre tests on water with reversers added to the blowing engines. TANTK was given higher-priority work with the A-40, A-50 and IL-78. The entire structure was marinised light alloy, much of the external skin being of honeycomb sandwich. The airframe was based on the fuselage, centroplan of short span but Model of MVA-62.\n\nvery long chord, and cigar-like floats carrying the tails. Above the rear on the centreline were the two main engines. The starting engines were mounted on the sides of the nose, and the (unused) lift-engine bay was disposed around the centre of gravity amidships. On each side of this area projected the outer wings, with straight equal taper and thickness/chord ratio of 12 per cent, with full-span leading-edge slats, ailerons and flaps hinged 1m (3ft 31/2in) below the wing. The propulsion and starting (cushion-blowing) engines were all Solov'yov D-30M turbofans, each rated at 6,800kg (14,991 Ib). The starting engines were equipped with cascade-type thrust deflectors, and later with clamshell-type reversers. A TA-6AAPU (auxiliary power unit) was carried to provide electric power and pneumatic power. Bleed air served the cabin conditioning system and hot-air deicing of all leading edges. A total of 15,500kg (34,171 Ib) of fuel was housed in two metal tanks and 12 soft cells. The cockpit contained three K-36L ejection-seats, for the pilot, navigator and weapon-systems operator. Flight controls were linked through the SAU-M autopilot and complex military navigation and weapon-delivery systems. Had the aircraft undertaken VTOL flights the reaction-control system would have come into use, with six pairs of high-power bleed-air nozzles disposed at the wingtips and longitudinal extremities. For operation from land No 19172 was fitted with the nose and a single main landing gear of a Tu-22, both on the centreline, and the complete outrigger-gear pods of a Myasishchev 3M heavy bomber. Maximum ordnance load, carried on IL-38 racks, comprised 4 tonnes (8,8181b), made up of AT-1 or -2 torpedoes, PLAB-250-120 or other bombs, various mines up to UDM-1500 size, RYu-2 depth charges and various sonobuoys (such as 144 RGB-1U).\n\n19\n\nB A R T I N I VVA-14 OKB drawing of WA-14M1\n\nOne of the incomplete WA-14s was damaged by fire, the third being abandoned at an early stage. The one with which all the flying was done, Nol9172, was retired to the Monino museum in a dismantled state, where it carries the number '10687' and 'Aeroflot'. TANTK had various projects for intended production amphibious derivatives. These were grouped under letter T, and two such are illustrated here for the first time. The WA-14 was an outstandingly bold concept which very nearly came off. There is little doubt it could have led to a practical verhicle for many oceanic purposes. In the long term all it achieved was to give TANTK-Beriev considerable experience in many new disciplines, especially in challenging avionics and flight-control areas. Such a programme would have almost no chance of being funded today.

Design bureau: Kazan Aeronautical Institute, Kazan, Tatar ASSR. The concept of the wing was that of V N Belyayev, but in order to test it he collaborated with VI Yukharin of the KAI. Partly because it would have been difficult to match centre of lift with centre of gravity by retrofitting the wing to an existing aircraft, it was decided to design an aircraft specially for this purpose. It was called Babochka (butterfly). The project was launched in 1937, and drawings were completed late the following year. Throughout, Belyayev was devoting most of his time to the EOI (see page 27). The single Babochka was being readied for flight when the Soviet Union was invaded. Even though Kazan was far to the East of Moscow, this project was not considered important and those working on it were drafted elsewhere.\n\n•1 -s/l?\n\nModel of Babochka\n\nBabochka\n\n22\n\nThis aircraft was essentially a straightforward low-wing monoplane, of fighter-like appearance, with a single (relatively large) piston engine. It is believed that the structure was almost all-metal stressed skin. The key item, the wing, had a high aspect ratio, sweptforward inboard sections and swept-back outer panels. The objective was to make a wing that was flexible yet which in severe positive manoeuvres would deflect upwards without causing a longitudinal pitch problem. Under load, the inner wings deflected upwards, tending to twist with positive angle of incidence, automatically countered by the negative twist of the outer panels. This was hoped to lead to an extension of Belyayev's concept of a wing that was inherently stable longitudinally. The inner wings were fitted with inboard and outboard split flaps, while the smaller outer panels carried two-section ailerons.\n\nThe engine was mounted on the nose on a steel-tube truss. According to historian V B Shavrov the engine was a 'Renault 430hp' (which would have had 12 cylinders and a central air-cooling inlet). In fact it must have been an MV-6, a licence-built Renault with six aircooled cylinders, rated at 210hp. Tandem enclosed cockpits were provided for the pilot and test observer. The tail, remarkably small (reflecting the designer's belief in the stability of the wing) positioned the horizontal tail wholly in front of the rudder. The landing gears were fully retractable, the main wheels folding inwards into the extended-chord wing roots. Though there is no reason to doubt that the Babochka would have flown successfully, there is equally no reason to believe that it would have shown any significant advantage over an aircraft with a conventional straighttapered wing.\n\nDimensions Span Length Wing area\n\n10.8m 6.84m 11.5m 2\n\n35 ft 514 in 22ft5!4in 124ft 2\n\nWeights Empty Loaded\n\n680kg 1,028kg\n\nl,4991b 2,266 Ib\n\nPerformance (estimated) Maximum speed\n\n510km/h\n\n31 7 mph\n\nBELYAYEV DB-LK\n\nBelyayev DB-LK\n\nDB-LK, plan view showing top and underside\n\nPurpose: The initials stood for 'long-range bomber, flying wing'. Design Bureau: Designer's own brigade at the Central Aerodynamics and Hydrodynamics Institute. Viktor Nikolayevich Belyayev, born in 1896, began his career as a stressman in the OMOS bureau in 1925. He subsequently worked in AGOS, KOSOS-CAH1 (TsAGl), the Tupolev OKB, AviAvnito and Aeroflot. He liked tailless aircraft, and had a fixation on a 'bat wing', with slight forward sweep and curved-back tips, which he considered not only gave such aircraft good longitudinal stability but also minimised induced drag. He tested such a wing in his BP-2 glider of 1933, which was towed by an R-5 from Koktebel (Crimea) to Moscow. In 1934 he entered an AviAvnito competition for a transport with a design having twin fuselages, each with a 750hp Wright Cyclone engine and ten passenger seats, but this was not built. From this he derived the DB-LK bomber. Designed in 1938, the single prototype was completed in November 1939, but (according to unofficial reports) pilots declined to do more than make fast taxi runs, the aircraft being dubbed Kuritsa (chicken) in consequence. In early 1940 this unacceptable situ-\n\nation was ended by the appointment by GK Nil WS (direction of the air force scientific test institute) of M A Nyukhtikov as test pilot, assisted by lead engineer TTSamarin and test observer N I Shaurov. Test flying began in early 1940, at which time Mark Gallai also joined the test team. Nyukhtikov complained that the flight-control system was inadequate and that the landing-gear shock absorbers were weak. In the investigation that followed, the Commission agreed with the first point, but the Head of Nil WS, AI Filin, thought the landing gear satisfactory. He then changed his mind when a leg collapsed with himself at the controls (see photo). Later the main legs were not only redesigned but were also inclined forward, to improve directional stability on the ground and avoid dangerous swing. Later in 1940 the Nil WS ordered the DB-LK to be abandoned, despite its outstanding performance, and the planned imminent installation of l,100hp M-88 engines. Belyayev had by this time designed a refined version with 1,700hp M-71 engines, but was told that the DB-3F (later redesignated IL-4) would remain the standard long-range bomber. Belyayev left comprehensive aerodynamic details, showing that the strange wing was of CAHI (TsAGI) MV-6bis profile over the longchord centroplan (centre section) but Gottin-\n\ngen 387 profile over the supposed 'bat-like' outer panels. Overall aspect ratio was no less than 8.2, and the outer wings had a leadingedge sweep of minus 5° 42', with a taper ratio of 7. The airframe was almost entirely a modern light-alloy stressed-skin structure, the wing having five spars. There is evidence the structural design was modern, with most components pressed or even machined from sheet. The outer wings had flaps of the unusual Zapp type, extended to 45°, with Frise ailerons outboard, which even had miniature sections on the back-raked tips. Ahead of the ailerons were slats. At each end of the centroplan was a fuselage, of basically circular section. On the front of each was a Tumanskii (Mikulin KB) M-87B 14-cylinder radial engine (Gnome-Rhone ancestry) rated at 950hp, driving a VISh-23D three-blade variable-pitch propeller of 3.3m (10ft l0in) diameter weighing 152kg (335 Ib). The engines were housed in modern longchord cowlings, with pilot-operated cooling gills. Tanks in the wings and fuselages housed 3,444 litres (757.6 Imperial gallons, 910 US gallons) of fuel, with all tanks protected by nitrogen inerting. On the centreline at the rear was a large (7.0m2, 75.3ft2) single fin and a 1.94m2 (20.9ft2) rudder with a large trim tab. High on the fin, 23\n\nBELYAYEV DB-LK above the rudder, was fixed a small (0.85m2, 9.15ft2) tailplane to which were pivoted the enormous elevators of 4.8m2 (51.7ft2) total area, each with a large tab. Each fuselage was provided with a main landing gear, with a single oleo strut on the outer side of the axle for a single wheel with a 900 x 300mm tyre, with a hydraulic brake. Each unit retracted rearwards hydraulically. On the centreline at the rear was the fixed castoring tailwheel, with a 450 x 150 tyre. The intention was that the series (production) DB-LK should have a pilot in the front of the left fuselage, a navigator in front on the right, and gunners in each tailcone. The gunners, entering like the others via roof hatches, should manage the radio as well as pairs of ShKAS 7.62mm machine guns, with a ±10° field of fire in all directions. Two more ShKAS fired ahead on the centreline, aimed by the pilot, and for the six guns a total of 4,500 rounds were provided. Behind each maingear bay was a bomb bay, with powered doors (see underside view). Each could carry an FAB-1000 (2,205 Ib) bomb, or four FAB-250 (551 Ib) bombs, or many other smaller stores. Predictably, the full military equipment was never fitted, though radio was installed throughout the flight trials. Despite its strikingly unconventional appearance, the DB-LK appeared to be a practical bomber with outstanding flight performance. Compared with the established WS bomber it had the same number of similar engines, and even half the number of landing-gear oleos, despite having twice the number of fuselages and weapon bays. From today's distance, it might have been worth pursuing this formula a little further.

Design Bureau: V N Belyayev.\n\nN Ye Leont'yev - could simultaneously have worked on the DB-LK, Babochka and two advanced pusher fighters and bombers. The inference has to be that the FBI did not progress far beyond the mock-up. This may have been photographed after the workers had left, immediately before it was destroyed, or alternatively it may have been safely located (but abandoned) somewhere East of Moscow.\n\nNo descriptive material has come to light regarding the proposed FBI (Russian for divebomber fighter). Only recently have photographs of the mock-up been discovered, marked SEKRETNO and dated 19/1I-40. When these photographs were unearthed and identified nothing was known of such an aircraft, and it was concluded that this was Specification. No figures known. the mock-up of the EOI fighter, especially as Shavrov said this was a twin-boom aircraft. Studying the photographs makes it obvious that the FBI was what its designation states, and not primarily a fighter. Almost the only fact deducible under the heading 'History' is that the date is one month after the evacuation of the factories in the Moscow area. In some respects the FBI design is similar to the EOI fighter. The forward fuselage has two cannon in the same undernose position, the single-seat cockpit has similar features, the wing is in the same mid-position, immediately behind it is the engine driving a threeblade pusher propeller and the twin booms and tail are similar. The differences are that the cockpit area is almost completely glazed, and the landing gears are taller to facilitate loading bombs on five racks (apparently an FAB-500 on the centreline and for an FAB-100 and FAB-50 under each wing). It is unlikely that Belyayev - even assisted by his team of P N Obrubov, L L Selyakov, E I Korzhenevskii, D A Zatvan, B S Beki and Two views of the FBI mock-up.\n\nBelyayev 370, EOI Purpose: Experimental fighter. Design Bureau: V N Belyayev, working at GAZ (factory) No 156, Moscow. This EOI (Eksperimental'nyi Odnomestnyi Istrebitel', experimental single-seat fighter) was proposed in early 1939, and personally approved by Stalin in August of that year. Design and manufacture proceeded through 1940, and at the German invasion of 22nd June 1941 the first flight was only a few months away. In October the Moscow factories were evacuated. It was decided to abandon the project, and the part-complete EOI, drawings and calculations were destroyed. When photographs of the FBI (see above) were discovered it was at first thought that this must be the same aircraft. In fact, there was little similarity between the two designs apart from the basic configuration.\n\nThe EOI had the cockpit in the nose, almost perfectly streamlined, with armament in the same location. Possibly for the first time in history, Belyayev designed the entire front section of the aircraft to be separated in emergency, so that the pilot would not have to bail out ahead of the propeller. The latter was to be driven by a Klimov M-105 engine, rated at l,100hp and fitted with a TK-2 turbocharger. In the original scheme, like fighters of 1917 by Gallaudet in the USA and Dufaux in France, the propeller was to have a large-diameter hub through which passed a tube carrying the rear fuselage. Some of the '370' drawings are reproduced overleaf. One shows the proposed cockpit, armament of two underfloor VYa-23 cannon and location of the cartridge-severed attachments. Another drawing shows the unique arrangement in which the wing was to be provided with a slat. This auxiliary surface was normally\n\nhoused in a recess immediately ahead of the flap or aileron. For take-off and landing it was to be swung down and forward to adopt a leading-edge-down attitude ahead of the leading edge of the wing. Thus, it was a bolder precursor of today's Krueger flap. Whether or not this aerodynamically powerful idea was abandoned is unknown, but Belyayev certainly abandoned the original rear fuselage. By late 1939 he had decided to use conventional twin tail booms. The specification overleaf applies to this revised scheme. According to one document it was intended that a production version should have had the M-106 engine. This would have been rated at 1,350hp, instead of 1,1 00hp. Whether the unconventional configuration, and especially the potentially dangerous slat system, would have shown to advantage will never be known.\n\n25\n\nB E L Y A Y E V 370,\n\nEOI Sketch drawings of 370\n\nDimensions Span Wing area Design speed\n\n11.4m 19 nf 700km/h\n\n37 ft 5 in 205ft 2 435 mph\n\nNo other data.\n\nOn take-off and landing\n\nFlight position\n\nModel of the final EOI configuration.\n\n26\n\nBEREZNYAK-ISAYEV BI\n\nBereznyak-Isayev BI Purpose: Experimental rocket-engined interceptor-fighter. Design Bureau: Designers Aleksandr Yakovlevich Bereznyak and Aleksei Mikhailovich Isayev, working at OKB of Bolkhovitinov, later managed by CAHI (TsAGI). In 1939 Bereznyak was an observer at the static tests of the first reliable rocket engine developed by Leonid Stepanovich Dushkin. In early 1940 he watched flight tests of the primitive RP-318 (see later under Korolyev). He discussed rocket aircraft with Isayev, who had been a Dushkin engineer involved with the RP-318. In late May 1941 they decided to propose a high-speed rocket-engined fighter. They put the suggestion to Prof Bolkhovitinov (see later entry). After discussion with all interested parties Bolkhovitinov sent a letter to GUAP (chief administration of aviation industry) on 9th July 1941 putting forward a detailed proposal. Soon a reply came from the Kremlin. The principals were called to GUAP before Shakhurin and A S Yakovlev, and within a week there was a full go-ahead. The order was for five prototypes, with the time to first flight cut from the suggested three months to a mere 35 days. A complete Bolkhovitinov team were confined to the OKB for 40 days, working three shifts round the clock. Tunnel testing was\n\ndone at CAHI, supervised by G S Byushgens. The first (unpowered) flight article was built without many drawings, dimensions being drawn directly on the materials and on templates. B M Kudrin made the first flight on 10th September 1941, the tug being a Pe-2. All necessary data were obtained in 15 flights. On 16th October the OKB and factory was evacuated to a half-built shed outside Sverdlovsk. The first (experimental) D-1A engine was installed in late January 1942, but exploded during testing on 20th February, injuring Kudrin (sent to hospital in Moscow) and a technician. The replacement pilot was Capt G Ya Bakhshivandzhi. He was in the cockpit on the first tied-down firing on 27th April 1942. On 15th May 1942 he made the world's first flight of a fully engineered rocket interceptor, still fitted with skis. By March 1943 seven BI prototypes had been constructed, but the flying was entirely in towed or gliding flight because of serious problems caused by explosions and acid spillages. Powered flying did not resume until February 1943. By this time Kudrin had returned to flight status, and was assigned one of the Bis. On powered flight No 6 on 21st March 1943 a height of 3km (9,843ft) was reached in 30 seconds. On powered flight No7, with aircraft No 3, on 27th March, Bakhshivandzhi made a run at sustained full power; the aircraft suddenly pitched over and\n\ndived into the ground. Tunnel testing later showed that at about 900km/h the BI would develop a nose-down pitching moment which could not be held by the pilot.

Until the end of the War these tested various later Dushkin engines, some with large thrust chambers for take-off and combat and small chambers to prolong the very short cruise endurance (which was the factor resulting in progressive waning of interest). Other testing attempted to perfect a sealed pressurized cockpit. To extend duration significantly BI No 6 was fitted with a Merkulov DM-4 ramjet on each wingtip. These were fired during test in the CAHI T-101 wind tunnel, but not in flight. By 1944 the urgency had departed from the programme, and the remaining BI Nol (some were scrapped following acid corrosion) were used as basic research aircraft. BI No7 was modified with revised wing-root fairings and stronger engine cowl panels, but at high speed tailplane flutter was experienced. BI No 5s (on skis) and BI No 6 (on wheels) were modified and subjected to investigative gliding tests, initially towed by a B-25J. In 1948 Bereznyak proposed a mixedpower interceptor with a three-chamber rocket engine of 10,000kg (22,046 Ib) sealevel thrust, for 'dash' performance, and a Mikulin AM-5 turbojet of 1,900kg (4,1891b) sea-level thrust. Estimated maximum speed was Mach 1.8, and range 750km (466 miles). This was not proceeded with. The BI Nol had a small and outstandingly simple all-wood airframe. The straight-tapered wing, 6 per cent thick, had two box spars and multiple stringers supporting skin mainly of 2mm ply. Outboard were fabriccovered ailerons. Inboard were split flaps with light-alloy structure (the only major metal parts), with a landing angle of 50°. The fuselage was a plywood monocoque with fabric bonded over the outer surface. It was constructed integral with the upper and lower fins. The rudder and elevators were fabric-covered. On the tailplane were added small circular endplate fins, and the powered aircraft had the tailplane braced to both the upper and lower fins. The engine bay was lined with refractory materials and stainless steel. The standard engine was the Dushkin D-1A-1100, the designation reflecting the sea-level thrust (2,425 Ib), rising to about 1,300kg (2,866 Ib) at high altitude. The propellants, fed by compressed air, were RFNA (red fuming nitric acid) and kerosene. These were contained in cylindrical stainless-steel tanks in the centre fuselage. The pneumatic system not only fed the propellants but also charged the guns and operated the flaps and main landing gears. The latter retracted inwards into the wings and normally had wheels with 500 x 150 tyres. Under the ventral fin was a retracting tail-\n\nB E R E Z N Y A K - I S A Y E VB I\n\nwheel. In winter these units were replaced by skis, the main skis retracting to lie snugly under the wings. The cockpit had a simple aft-sliding canopy, and a bulletproof windscreen. Certain of the prototypes had armament, comprising two ShVAK 20mm cannon, each with 45 rounds, fired electrically and installed in\n\nthe upper half of the nose under a cover secured by three latches on each side. Between the spars under the propellant cylinders was a bay which in some aircraft could house a small bomb load (see below). Structural factor of safety was 9, rising to no less than 13.5 after using most of the propellants. By any yardstick the BI No 1 was a remark-\n\nable achievement, and all pilots who flew it thought it handled beautifully. It was killed by the time it took to overcome the problems, and - crucially - by the impracticably short flight endurance.\n\npowerful and of much later design than the massive Pratt & Whitney. On 23rd August 1960 Directive 918-383 ordered OKB No 49, assisted by neighbouring No 86, to study the U-2 and produce five copies, designated S-13. These were primarily to support 'a multidiscipline study of the structural, technical and maintenance aspects of the U-2, and master its technology for use in indigenous aircraft'. It was also expected that the S-13 would be used to collect upper-atmosphere samples, destroy hostile balloons and (using the 73-13, or AFA-60, camera) undertake reconnaissance missions. Despite inexorable increases in weight over the US original, work attempted to meet the first-flight date of first quarter 1962. Much of the supporting equipment had already been developed for the Yak-25RV and TsybinRSR (which see). On 1st April 1961 a detailed metal fuselage mock-up was completed, with 'models of its systems'. A Tu-16 was readied for testing the engine (now designated RD-16-75), landing gears\n\nand other items, while CAHI tunnels confirmed that the U-2 had the exceptional L/D ratio of 25. Out of the blue, on 12th May 1962 Directive 440-191 ordered the whole S-13 project to be terminated.\n\nThe nominal weight breakdown for a fully equipped powered aircraft was:\n\nAirframe Comprising fuselage Wing Tail group Landing gear, wheeled Engine Controls RFNA tanks Kerosene tanks Air bottles Guns Armour Armour glass, windscreen Other equipment about Useful load comprised Pilot Nitric acid Kerosene 20mm ammunition Bombs\n\n462kg 182kg 174kg 30kg 60kg 48kg\n\n1,01 8.5 Ib 401 Ib 383.6 Ib 66 Ib 1321b\n\n16kg 80kg 31.2kg 22.4kg 84kg 76 k» 6kg 20kg\n\n35 Ib 176.4lb 68.8 Ib 49.4 Ib 185 Ib 167.5lb 13 Ib 44 Ib\n\n90kg 570kg 135kg 19.6kg 38.4 kg\n\n198 Ib 1 ,256.6 Ib 297.6 Ib 43.2 Ib 84.6 Ib\n\n106 Ib\n\nOKB drawing of BI No 6/PVRD.\n\nBerievS-13 Purpose: To copy the Lockheed U-2B. Design Bureau: OKB No 49, Taganrog, General Constructor G M Beriev. On 1 st May 1960 the world was astonished to learn that the missile defences of Sverdlovsk had shot down a Lockheed U-2 of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Parts of the aircraft were put on display in Moscow's Gorkiy Park. What the world was not told was that for months afterwards a vast area was combed by large squads looking for every fragment of the downed aircraft (which had broken up at high altitude). All the pieces were brought to GK Nil WS, where they were carefully studied. On 28th June 1960 SovMin Directive 702-288 instructed OKB No 16 in Kazan, led by P F Zubets, to copy the J57-P-13 engine. This was a blow to Zubets, whose RD-500 was in the same thrust class, and even more to the several engine designers (Dobrynin, Lyul'ka, Kuznetsov and Tumanskii) who had engines on test which were more\n\nS-13 metal mock-up fuselage.\n\n29\n\nBICH-3\n\nBICh-3 Purpose: To test previously invented 'parabola wing' in a powered aircraft Design Bureau: Not an OKB but a private individual, Boris Ivanovich Cheranovskii (1896-1960). Throughout his life he scratched around for funds to build and test his succession of 30 types of gliders and powered aircraft, all of 'tailless' configuration. In 1924 Cheranovskii tested his BICh-1 'Parabola' glider and the refined BICh-2, which demonstrated 'normal longitudinal stability and controllability and is considered to have\n\nbeen the world's first successful flying wing'. In 1926 he followed with the BICh-3, which was almost the BICh-2 fitted with an engine. Cheranovskii's gliders had been flown at the All-Union meetings at Koktebel, Crimea, but most of the flying of his first aeroplane was done by B N Kudrin (later famous) in Moscow. The BICh-3 was a basically simple aircraft, constructed of wood with thin ply skin over the leading edge, inboard upper surface and landing-gear trousers, and fabric elsewhere. The BICh-2 had flown without a rudder (it was better with one) since turning was\n\nachieved by the ailerons. With the BICh-3 the addition of an engine required a vestigial fuselage with a fin and rudder. The main controls remained the trailing-edge elevators and ailerons, operated by rods and bellcranks and hung on inset balanced hinges. The engine was a Blackburne Tomtit, an inverted V-twin of 698 cc rated at 18hp. Skids were provided under the tail and outer wings. Kudrin described the BICh-3 as 'not very stable, but controllable'. It was sufficiently successful to lead to the many successors.\n\nDimensions Span Length Wing area\n\n9.5m 3.5m 20.0 m!\n\n31 ft 2 in Ilft6in 215ft 2\n\nWeights Empty Fuel/oil Loaded\n\n140kg 10kg 230kg\n\n309 Ib 22 Ib 507 Ib\n\nPerformance Max speed, not recorded Landing speed\n\n40km/h\n\n25 mph\n\nNo other data.\n\nAbove: BICh-1.

BICh followed his Type 3 with the impressive BICh-5 bomber, powered by two BMW VI engines, but never obtained funds to build it. In 1929 he flew the BICh-7, almost a 1.5-scale repeat of BICh-3 with two seats in tandem. The problem was that he replaced the central tail by rudders (without fixed fins) on the wingtips, and the result was almost uncontrollable. He modified the aircraft into the BICh-7A, but was so busy with the BICh-11 and other projects that the improved aircraft did not fly until 1932. Apart from returning to a central fin and rudder he replaced the centreline wheel and wingtip skids by a conventional landing gear. The BICh-7A gradually became an outstanding aircraft. Testing was done mainly by N P Blagin (later infamous for colliding with the monster Maksim Gorkii), and he kept modifying the elevators and ailerons until the aircraft was to his satisfaction. This larger 'parabola-wing' aircraft was again made of wood, veneer and fabric, with various metal parts including the conventional divided rubber-sprung main landing gears and tailskid. The tandem cockpits were en-\n\nclosed, which in 1932 was unusual. The engine was a l00hp Bristol Lucifer, and one of the unsolvable problems was that the Lucifer was notorious for the violence of the firing strokes from its three cylinders, which in some aircraft (so far as we know, not including the BICh-7A) caused structural failure of its mountings. This aircraft appears to have become an unqualified success, appearing at many airshows over several years.\n\nBICh-7 BICH-7A\n\nDimensions Span Length Wing area Weights (BICh-7) Empty Fuel/oil Loaded (BICh-7A) Empty Fuel/oil Loaded Performance Maximum speed Range Landing speed\n\n12.5m 4.95m 34.6 nf\n\n41ft 16 ft 3 in 372 ft2\n\n612kg 93kg 865kg\n\nl,3491b 205 Ib l,9071b\n\n627kg 93kg 880kg\n\nl,3821b 205 Ib l,9401b\n\n165km/h 350km 70km/h\n\n102.5 mph 21 7 miles 43.5 mph\n\n31\n\nB I C H - 8 / B I C H - 1 1 , RP-1\n\nBICh-8 Purpose: To test the use of wingtip rudders. Design Bureau: B I Cheranovskii. Few details of this machine have survived. It was built and tested in 1929. Cheranovskii was so distressed by the failure of the BICh-7 that he built this simple glider to see if wingtip rudders could be made to work. The BICh-8 was dubbed Treoogol'nik (little triangle). It had an open cockpit and centreline skid. The wing was built as a centre section, integral with the nacelle, and outer panels fitted with inboard elevators, outboard ailerons and wingtip rudders with inset hinges mounted on small fins. This machine may have flown satisfactorily, because Cheranovskii repeated tip rudders in the BICh-11. No data. Cheranovskii with BICh-8.\n\nBICh-8\n\nBICh-11, RP-1 Purpose: To test rocket engine in flight. Design Bureau: B I Cheranovskii. The BICh-11 was designed in 1931 as a bungee-launched glider to see if the concept of using wingtip rudders could be made to work. The glides may have been too brief to be useful, because in 1932 Cheranovskii added a small British engine more powerful than the Tomtit used for BICh-3. In 1933 this aircraft was selected by MosGIRD, the Moscow-based experimental rocket-engine 32\n\ngroup, as a suitable test-bed with which to fly a small liquid-propellant rocket engine, which began bench-testing on 18th March 1933. The aircraft was again modified, with the rocket engine(s) and their supply and control system and a new wing of increased span. It was then judged that the propulsion system was too dangerous to fly. Note: some accounts say the piston engine was installed after the removal of the rocket engine(s), but drawings show the piston-engined aircraft to have had the original wing.\n\nThe BICh-11 was another wooden aircraft with fabric covering, with a single seat, hinged canopy and trailing-edge elevators and ailerons. It appears to have had no landing gear other than a centreline skid. On the wingtips were rudders, under which were skids. In its powered form the engine was an ABC Scorpion with two air-cooled cylinders, rated at 27/35hp. The rocket engine was the GIRD OR-2, designed by a team led by FATsander, with a single thrust chamber burning petrol (gasoline) and liquid oxygen.\n\nB I C H - 1 1, RP-1 Sea-level thrust was 50kg (110 Ib). The BlCh11 was given a wing of greater span, and fitted with sprung landing gears and a tailskid. There is confusion over whether one or two OR-2 engines were installed (drawings suggest one), fed by a lagged spherical tank of liquid oxygen and a smaller bottle of fuel, all fed by gas pressure. In this form the aircraft was painted red overall, with 'GIRD RP-1' painted on each side of the vestigial fuselage. RP stood for Raketnyi Planer, rocket glider. It is not recorded whether this aircraft flew satisfactorily with wingtip rudders, which with BICh-7 had proved unsatisfactory.\n\nDimensions (as RP-1) Span Length Wing area\n\n12.1m 3.09m 20.0m 2\n\n39 ft 8!^ in 10 ft 1% in 215 ft2\n\n200kg\n\n441 Ib\n\nWeights Empty\n\nNo other reliable data.\n\nCheranovskii with RP-1.\n\nBICh-11\n\nRP-1\n\n33\n\nBICH-14\n\nBICh-14 Purpose: To test an improved twin-engined 'Parabola'. Design Bureau: B I Cheranovskii. In 1933 Cheranovskii schemed his first design with twin engines, the BICh-10. Later in that year he tested a tunnel model, and by 1934 he had made so many (mostly minor) changes that he redesignated it as the BICh-14. It interested the Central Construction Bureau, and thus received their designation CCB-10 (TsKB-10). With their assistance the aircraft was built, and the flight-test programme was opened at the end of 1934 by Yuri I Piontkovskii. Having no slipstream, the rudder was ineffective, and it was difficult to equalise pro-\n\npeller thrusts. On landing, with engines idling, a heavy stick force was needed to get the tail down. Though it was not one of the better BICh designs, having almost no directional stability and being extremely reluctant to respond to pilot inputs, it was submitted for NIlWS testing. Here such famous pilots as Stefanovskii, Petrov and Nyukhtikov flew it, or attempted to. Various changes made this aircraft marginally acceptable, but attempts to improve it ceased in 1937 Again this was a wooden aircraft, with a skin of veneer (over the leading edge) and fabric. An innovation was to use aluminium to make the embryonic fuselage, which seated up to five, and the integral fin. The wing\n\nBICh-14.\n\n34\n\nhad four spars and 60 ribs, and was made as a centre section, of 3.3m (10ft l0in) span, and bolted outer panels. Close together on the leading edge were the two l00hp M-ll engines, with Townend-ring cowls, aluminium nacelles and U-2 type wooden propellers. As before, virtually all the development effort went into improving the trailing-edge controls, of which there were three on each wing, all hung in the usual Junkers style below the trailing edge. For most of the time the four inner surfaces were elevators and the outers ailerons, but at times the middle surfaces were tested as flaps. The BICh-14 apparently did nothing to enhance its designer's reputation.\n\nDimensions Span Length Wing area\n\n16.2m 6.0m 60m 2\n\n53 ft 2 in 19 ft 9 in 646ft2\n\nWeights Empty Loaded\n\n1,285kg 1,900kg\n\n2,833 Ib 4,1891b\n\nPerformance Maximum speed, approx Range Landing speed\n\n220km/h 370km 70km/h\n\n137 mph 230 miles 43.5 mph\n\nBICH-16 / BICn-17\n\nBICh-16 Purpose: To attempt to fly on human muscle power. Design Bureau: B I Cheranovskii. Ever one to explore fresh ideas, in 1934 Cheranovskii obtained financial support from Osoaviakhim (the Society of Friends of the Aviation and Chemical industries) for his pro-\n\nposal to build a man-powered ornithopter (flapping-wing aircraft). It could not be made to fly. This bird-like machine consisted mainly of a flexible wing. The pilot placed his feet on a rudder bar directly under the rudder and then bent forward between two vestigial fins until he could grasp the spade-grip which, via the\n\ntwo struts seen in the photo, flapped the wings. The two struts and vertical operating rod were pivoted at the bottom to a curved landing skid.\n\nKurchevskii was the designer of a family of APK and DRP recoilless guns of large calibre (45, 76.2, 80 and 100mm). These operated by firing a projectile down the barrel and a nearly equal mass plus gun gas from a rear nozzle. Fighters fitted with such guns included the\n\nGrigorovich I-Z and Tupolev ANT-29 and ANT46. Cheranovskii completed the design of the BICh-17 in 1935, but in February 1936 Kurchevskii was arrested and his design bureau 'liquidated'. By this time the BICh-17 was '60 per cent complete'.\n\nData not recorded. Two views of BICh-16.\n\nBICh-17 Purpose: Single-seat fighter.

The structure was wood, with skins of birch shpon (multi-ply veneer), the wing having detachable outer panels. The engine was a 480hp M-22 (imported or licence-made Bristol Jupiter) driving a two-blade propeller. The main landing gears retracted, probably inwards, and the elevators were divided into inner and outer sections by the two 80mm APK guns. The pilot sat under a typical Cheranovskii upward-hinged canopy which formed the front part of the fin. Aircraft left incomplete. ModelofBICh-17.\n\nBICh-18 Muskulyot Purpose: To attempt once more to fly on human muscle power. Design Bureau: B I Cheranovskii. Undeterred by the total failure of BICh-16, Cheranovskii persevered with the idea of flying like a bird and designed the totally different BICh-18. The name meant 'muscle-power'. On 10th August 1937 pilot R A Pishchuchev, who weighed 58kg (1281b), glided 130m (4261/2ft) off a bungee launch, without pedalling. He then did a pedalling flight, achieving six wing cycles. He reported 'noticeable forward thrust', and flew 450m (1,476ft). Sustained flight was considered impossible. The BICh-18 vaguely resembled a performance sailplane with a cockpit in the nose and conventional tail. Much of the structure was balsa. There were two wing sets, comprising the lower left and upper right wings forming one unit and the upper left and lower right forming the other. Both sets were mounted on pivots on top of the fuselage and arranged to rock through a ±5° angle by cockpit pedals. As the wings rocked, their tips never quite touching, the portion of each wing aft of the main spar was free to flap up and down to give propulsive thrust. One report states that the outer trailing-edge portions were ailerons. If the evidence is correct this odd machine was one of the few human-powered aircraft to have achieved anything prior to the 1960s.\n\nDimensions Length Wing area\n\n8.0m 4.48m 10.0m2\n\n26 ft 3 in 14 ft 814 in 108ft 2\n\nWeights Empty Loaded\n\n72 kg 130kg\n\n1591b 287 Ib\n\nSpan\n\n36\n\nBICh-18.\n\nBICH-20\n\nPlONYER\n\nBICh-20 Pionyer Purpose: To test a small sporting aircraft of tailless design. Design bureau: B I Cheranovskii. This attractive little machine was rolled out on skis in late 1937 and first flown in 1938. Later in that year it was fitted with a more powerful engine, and with wheel landing gear. Extensive testing, which included sustained turns at about 35° bank at different heights, showed that the BICh-20 was stable and controllable, and also could land very slowly. This aircraft was again a wooden structure, with ply over the leading edge and the vestigial fuselage. The wing marked a further change in aerodynamic form: having started with 'parabola' designs, Cheranovskii switched to delta (triangular) shapes, and with the BICh-20 adopted a more common form with straight taper, mainly on the leading edge. Trailing-edge controls comprised inboard elevators and outboard ailerons, with prominent operating levers. To enter the cockpit the pilot hinged over to one side the top of the fuselage and integral Plexiglas canopy which formed the leading edge of the fin. The aircraft was completed with Cheranovskii's ancient British 18hp Blackburne engine, in a metal cowling, and with sprung ski landing gear. It was later fitted with wheels, including a tailwheel, and a 20hp French Aubier-Dunne engine. All known records suggest that this aircraft was completely successful.\n\nDimensions Span Length, original re-engined Wing area\n\n6.9m 3.5m 3.56m 9.0 nf\n\n22fl8in Ilft6in 11 ft 8H in 97ft 2\n\nWeights Empty, original re-engined Loaded, original re-engined\n\n176kg 181kg 280kg 287kg\n\n38815 399 Ib 6171b 633 Ib\n\nPerformance Maximum speed, original re-engined Service ceiling Range Landing speed\n\n160km/h 166km/h 4,000 m 320km 49km/h\n\n99 mph 103 mph 13,120ft 199 miles 30 mph\n\nBICh-20 Pionyer (Pioneer).\n\nBICh-20\n\n37\n\nB I C H - 2 1 , SG-1\n\nBICh-21,SG-l\n\nPurpose: To use the tailless concept in a more powerful aircraft for racing.
