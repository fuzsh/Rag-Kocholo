Some are from American journals; some are translated from Russian publications; one is from an encyclopedia; and one is based on a conference presentation. The writings thus represent several genres and were addressed to various audiences, but center on a fairly limited period of time and cast of characters and so may profit from being grouped together. There have been some minor changes and editing (especially in the case of translations) as well as some updating of footnotes, although in each case the documentation style of first publication has been maintained. I have also corrected a few errors of my own as well as misprints. The many friends and colleagues who have provided advice, encouragement, criticism, and stimulating dialogue over the years are too many to name, but I will try and make a start. Thanks, first of all, to my colleagues and collaborators at the Institute of Russian Literature (Pushkin House) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, especially Natal’ia Dmitievna Kochetkova, Nadezhda Iurev’na Alekseeva, Sergei Nikolaev, and V. P. Stepanov, as well as the late A. M. Panchenko. G. A. Moiseeva, E. B. Mozgovaia and Iu. V. Stennik. I also owe innumerable intellectual debts to: Victor Zhivov (whose works have helped shape my overall conception of eighteenth-century Russia), as well as to Irina Reyfman, Alexander Levitsky, Gitta Hammarberg, Gary Marker, Lev Berdnikov, Ronald Vroon, Joachim Klein, Roger Bartlett, W. Garreth Jones, Petr Bukharkin, Lidiia Sazonova, William Todd, Amanda Ewington, Elise Wirtschafter, Olga Tsapina, Tatiana Smoliarova, Hilde Hoggenboom, Anna Lisa Crone, Luba Golbert, Kelly Herold, Mariia Shcherbakova, and the late Stephen Baehr and Lindsay Hughes. All have provided encouragement, ideas, and helpful criticism at various stages of my work. My gratitude also goes to my colleagues at the University of Southern California, Sally Pratt, Thomas Seifrid, John Bowlt, Lada Panova, Alik Zholkovsky and Susan Kechekian for their continued advice and support. vii\n\nForeword\n\nI would also like to acknowledge the organizations that over the years have provided material support for the research represented in this volume.

(child of foreign lessons, / Envious and arrogant, cold Sumarokov). Yet as my undergraduate professor of Russian literature Gary Browning used to say, there are two types of “great writer” — one who is acknowledged to write for the ages, and endures among readers; and the one who is acclaimed in his or her own generation but forgotten or rejected by posterity.1 From a historical perspective, the fact of their celebrity itself suggests a unique contribution and vital connection to the literary life of their day. 1\n\nSome of the bestsellers that come to mind who were at the center of literary life of their day but whose works have mostly faded from cultural consciousness include Leonid Andreev, Maxim Gorky, Boris Pil’niak and Fedor Gladkov. In a discussion of Russian professors on the SEELANGS list-serv (March 12, 2009) other names that were suggested for the category of “forgotten superstars” included (in no strict order): Vladislav Ozerov, Vladimir Benediktov, Nestor Kukol’nik, Mikhail Zagoskin, Alexander Druzhinin, Vsevolod Garshin, Gleb Uspenskii, Konstantin Fofanov, Anastasiia Verbitskaia, Mikhail Artsybashev, Pavel Mel’nikov-Pecherskii, Semen Nadson, Petr Boborykin, Nikolai Pomialovskii, Pavel Zasodimskii, Fedor Reshetnikov, Aleksandr Amfiteatrov, Sergei Gorodetskii, Vladimir Nemerovich-Danchenko, Dmitrii Tsenzor, Lidiia Charskaia, Apollon Maikov, Lev Mei, Aleksei Apukhtin, Konstantin Sluchevskii, Demian Bednyi, Viacheslav Shishkov, Mirra Lokhvitskaia, Petr Pavlenko, Igor’ Serverianin, Aleksandr Sheller-Mikhailov, Semen Babaevskii, Ivan Shevtsov, Panteleimon Romanov, Marietta Shaginian, Lidia Seifullina, Boris Polevoi, Eduard Asadov, Anatolii Gladilin, Vladimir Orlov, Leonid Dobychin, Sergei Zaiaitskii, and Sergei Malashkin. Thanks to my colleagues who contributed to this list. 3\n\nPart One. Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nMoreover, Sumarokov’s position differs from that of the standard “forgotten ‘great writer’” in that in many respects he saw himself (and could arguably be seen) as the “father of modern Russian Literature” (rodonachal’nik novoi russkoi literatury) — the title ultimately bestowed on Alexander Pushkin. Of course, even in the eighteenth century Sumarokov had serious rivals for primacy (Trediakovskii, Lomonosov, and later, Derzhavin and Karamzin), and various arguments may always be made for rivals and predecessors; ultimately, the decision on who is to play the role of “national poet” depends on a complex of social, cultural, and political factors (not to mention of course the role of talent).2 Like Pushkin, Sumarokov attended a special school for noblemen, intended for future leaders of the country. Like Pushkin, he was very conscious of his place as a “professional Russian writer,” and in his career attempted to establish models for practically all of the major modern poetic and dramatic genres, many of which began their development in Russia thanks to him. Like Pushkin, Sumarokov felt restricted by a court-centered patronage system and was torn between allegiance to the reigning monarch and his own creative (and financial) independence. And also like Pushkin, he saw his reputation decline at the end of his career and expressed serious misgivings about the viability of modern Europeanized culture in Russia. Unlike Pushkin, however, Sumarokov’s reputation never experienced a posthumous rehabilitation (although there was an unsuccessful attempt by a few supporters at the start of the nineteenth century). Yet in recent years, scholars have begun to reevaluate and appreciate Sumarokov’s pioneering role in eighteenth-century letters. Notable, in particular, are Victor Zhivov’s analysis of his contributions to the literary language; Amanda Ewington’s analysis of Sumarokov’s adaptation of Voltairean literary and cultural models to Russia; Joachim Klein’s work on his pastoral poetry and drama; Ronald Vroon’s studies of Sumarokov’s poetic collections; Sergei Nikolaev’s reconsideration of the problem of “plagiarism” and “translation”; Kirill Ospovat’s work on Sumarokov in the context of court culture; Oleg Proskurin’s examination of his connections to obscene verse; Vladimir 2\n\nIn the case of Pushkin, see: Marcus C. Levitt, Russian Literary Politics and the Pushkin Celebration of 1880. Studies of the Harriman Institute (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1989); Paul Debreczeny, Social Functions of Literature: Alexander Pushkin and Russian Culture. (Stanford, Calif: Stanford UP, 1997); Stephanie Sandler, Commemorating Pushkin: Russia’s Myth of a National Poet (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2004), and her “’Pushkin’ and Identity,” chap. 11 in National Identity in Russian Culture: An Introduction, ed. Simon Franklin and Emma Widdis (New York: Cambridge UP, 2004). 4\n\nPreface\n\nStepanov’s work on his fables and Alexander Levitsky’s and Liudmilla Lutsevich’s analysis of his religious verse.3 My own explorations in the articles that follow take up various aspects of Sumarokov’s activity and the literary life of his era. These include: the problem of Sumarokov’s status as a writer, both his legal position and selfimage; analyses of several of his key works (epistles, works for the theater, ballet, poetic collections); censorship and publishing history; the problem of literary critical discourse; Sumarokov’s reading; his philosophical writing; and his views on the literary language and orthography. Several of these studies make use of new archival material; others are based on close textual and comparative textological analysis; still others focus on problems of genre and interpretation. Most center on phenomena that were new to Russian literature and culture and that played unique roles in the formation of the “new Russian literature.” Among these is an article on “Barkoviana” (obscene poetry), in which Sumarokov was involved both as author and target. I have chosen to begin with an overview of Sumarokov’s life and works written for the Dictionary of Literary Biography.\n\n3\n\nSee the “Selected Bibliography” that follows chap. 1, “Sumarokov: Life and Works.” 5\n\nPart One. Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\n1\n\nSUMAROKOV: Life and Works\n\nThe Russian Boileau, the Russian Racine, the Russian Molière, the Russian Lafontaine, the Russian Voltaire — these are some of the titles contemporaries accorded Alexander Petrovich Sumarokov. The foremost representative of Russian Classicism, Sumarokov aspired to be the founder of a new, modern European literature in Russia. He founded and directed the Russian national theater (for which he supplied most of its early repertory), published the first private literary journal in Russia, helped establish the norms of the new literary language, and provided models of virtually every current European poetic and dramatic genre, including fable, song, sonnet, elegy, satire, eclogue, idyll, epigram, ballad, madrigal, rondeau, folktale, and a wide variety of odes — panegyric, spiritual, philosophical, Anacreontic, Horatian, and Sapphic — as well as the first Russian tragedies, comedies, operas, and ballets. While his reputation declined in the early nineteenth century when a new Romantic generation repudiated the tradition Sumarokov had tried to establish, Sumarokov was arguably the first professional writer in Russia, in that (at least after 1756) he was the first to dedicate himself to literary pursuits full-time. He was also arguably the first to fashion of his career a modern literary biography. Sumarokov was born on November 14, 1717, the second of three brothers. According to one of his poems he was born near the town of Vil’mandstrand (Lappeenranta) in present-day Finland, where his father, Peter Pankrat’evich Sumarokov, was probably serving against the Swedes in the Great Northern War. Sumarokov took great pride in his noble lineage and his family’s loyal service to the state. His grandfather Pankratii Bogdanovich Sumarokov had served Tsar Fedor and was rewarded for faithful service by Peter the Great, who reportedly became godfather to his son, Sumarokov’s father. In the unfinished “The Second Streletskii Uprising” Sumarokov told the story of his 6\n\nChapter 1. Sumarokov: Life and Works\n\ngreat-uncle Ivan Bogdanov. Nicknamed “the Eagle” for saving Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich from a bear while on a hunt, he later refused, despite prolonged torture, to bear false witness against Tsarina Sofia’s enemies. The story is indicative of Sumarokov’s moral and political convictions and also reflects his self-image as a writer and truthsayer. Almost nothing is known of Sumarokov’s early years. He ascribed his “first groundings in the Russian language” to his father, who had been educated by the Serb I. A. Zeikan, a man whom the tsar had appointed as tutor to the Naryshkin family and who later tutored Peter II. On May 30, 1732, Sumarokov entered the newly opened Sukhoputnyi Shlakhetskii Kadetskii Korpus (Noble Infantry Cadet Corps), established by Empress Anna to prepare noblemen for service as officers in the army. At the so-called “chivalric academy” (rytsarskaia akademiia) courses on military science took second place to a secular and humanistic curriculum — unique for Russian schools of that day — which included history, geography, jurisprudence, Latin, modern languages (German, French, Italian), as well as fencing, drawing, horsemanship, music, and dancing, which helped cadets develop the special skills and new Europeanized manners needed to participate in aristocratic court life. Literature was clearly a major pursuit at the corps, which produced many eighteenth-century literary figures (including Ivan Elagin, Mikhail Kheraskov, Andrei Nartov, Sergei Poroshin) and which in the late 1750’s opened its own press; according to some accounts there was even a literary society among the cadets in Sumarokov’s day. Sumarokov’s first published work was an ode to Empress Anna in the name of the corps in 1740, written in accord with Vasilii Trediakovskii’s verse reform of 1735; he later disclaimed this ode and advised young poets to burn their immature works, as he said he had done to his first nine years’ production. Sumarokov graduated from the corps on April 14, 1740. He was made an adjutant to Count M. G. Golovkin, who was arrested and sent into exile soon after Empress Anna’s death in the fall of that year. Sumarokov was then appointed to the suite of Count A. G. Razumovskii, Empress Elizabeth’s morganatic husband and brother of K. G. Razumovskii, president of the Academy of Sciences. Sumarokov was appointed Razumovskii’s adjutant on June 7, 1743; from late in 1745 he was put in charge of the administration of the leib-kompaniia, a military body created by Elizabeth as a reward to the troops that had supported her ascension to the throne. Sumarokov found in Razumovskii a patron as well as entry into high court circles. Sumarokov’s presence at court led to his marriage on November 10, 1746, to Johanna Khristiforovna Balk (or perhaps Balior), lady-in-waiting to Princess Sofia 7\n\nPart One. Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nof Anhalt-Zerbst, the future Catherine the Great, with whom Sumarokov’s literary fortunes were to be intimately linked. Sumarokov’s first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1766, produced two daughters, Ekaterina and Praskov’ia. Ekaterina, long thought to be a poet because of some verses Sumarokov signed with her name, married Sumarokov’s protégé, the tragedian Iakov Kniazhnin, some time before 1769. Sumarokov first attracted general attention by writing fashionable songs that became the rage at court. In contrast to Trediakovskii’s syllabic songs, Sumarokov created the first examples of the modern Russian (syllabo-tonic) romance, in his day often put to the music of minuets or other fashionable European dances and accompanied by a lute; some were put to music by the court musician Timofei Belogradskii and others by Grigorii Teplov who pirated them for his popular collection After Work, Idleness, or a Collection of Various Songs (Mezhdu delom bezdel’e ili sobranie raznykh pesen, circa 1745–1751). In the latter case, Sumarokov complained about the “audacity of publishing someone else’s works without the authors’ permission . . . spoiling that which others have composed with care and imposing indecent titles on others’ works, something which is nowhere practiced, and nowhere permitted.” Actually, in an era before copyright Sumarokov had no legal recourse and his only alternative was to republish the songs himself in their correct versions. The love song, a relatively insignificant genre for European Classicists, became an important vehicle through which Sumarokov developed the language and rhythms of his new lyric poetry. As opposed to Trediakovskii’s songs, which reflected the flirtatious affectation of Parisian salons, Sumarokov’s songs are closer in theme to the more serious songs of the Russian folk tradition. As the scholar Il’ia Z. Serman has noted, Sumarokov’s songs pointed the way to his later tragedies, in which the psychological torments his protagonists undergo may be seen as an extension of those experienced by the lyric personae of his songs. Furthermore, as Sumarokov asserts in his “Epistle on Poetry” (1748): “Слог песен должен быть приятен, прост и ясен, / Витийств не надобно; он сам собой прекрасен” (A song’s style should be pleasant, simple and clear, / Orations are not needed; it’s beautiful all by itself). This couplet expresses a central plank of Sumarokov’s Classicism, which stressed precision, simplicity, and clarity of expression — as opposed both to Trediakovskii’s clumsy and convoluted style and to the ornate, quasi-baroque poetics of Mikhail Lomonosov’s odes. Sumarokov’s notorious and often bitter rivalry with Trediakovskii and Lomonosov may be counted as one of the major literary facts of the 8\n\nChapter 1. Sumarokov: Life and Works\n\nmiddle of the century, as all three strove for preeminence in establishing the rules and norms for the fledgling literature. Their competition dates to the early 1740’s; in 1744 they jointly published three verse paraphrases of Psalm 143 (Psalm 144 in English Psalters) for public judgment. Various perspectives on their rivalry have been asserted. Some scholars have stressed Sumarokov’s extraordinarily cantankerous and argumentative personality, although in this respect Lomonosov was surely a close second; their rude behavior should be seen within the context of the blunt and often coarse manners of the day, when the polite society of salons existed more in theoretical pronouncements than in actuality. Various polemics reveal such minutia as that Sumarokov was a redhead and may have had a nervous tic and stutter. Unlike Trediakovskii, who was primarily a literary scholar, and Lomonosov, who was first and foremost a scientist and who viewed poetry as a sideline, Sumarokov dedicated himself to Russian letters, and what has appeared to many readers to be unseemly self-promotion was due at least in part to the great resistance he met in trying to establish the profession of writer in Russia as something worthy of respect. Further, the view of the time that equated public glory with virtue made an overriding concern with public image natural and even expected (Catherine the Great, who was a champion self-promoter, is a case in point). Others have argued that deeper class antagonisms were at work — that Sumarokov represented the interests of the hereditary nobility, as opposed to Trediakovskii, son of a priest, and Lomonosov, son of a peasant fisherman who was patronized by newly risen grandees close to Elizabeth’s throne. In the later 1750’s the hostility of antagonistic court factions, each of which adopted its own poet and egged him on against the others, also clearly played a role in Sumarokov’s feud with Lomonosov. Finally, not the least significant factor in this hostility was the legacy of medieval Russian patterns of thinking, which assumed that there was only one right and immutable way to do things. This was eminently amenable to Classicism, which assumed the existence of perfect, fixed, impersonal laws of nature, one consequence of which was to elevate minor personal disagreements into battles over absolute truths. While Sumarokov was clearly indebted to Trediakovskii’s and Lomonosov’s reforms of Russian versification, he arguably did far more than they in putting it into practice and creating a modern poetic system of genres and a tradition of actual poetic practice. Disclaiming apprenticeship from his rivals, Sumarokov asserted in his “ To Senseless Rhymsters” (K nesmyslennym rifmotvortsam, 1759) that at the time when he made his literary debut 9\n\nPart One. Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nThere were no poets in Russia yet, and no one to learn from. It was as if I was going without a guide through a dark forest which screened the dwelling of the Muses from my eyes. Although I am much indebted to Racine, I only espied him once I was out of the woods, when Mount Parnassus had already presented itself to my gaze. But Racine is a Frenchman and could not instruct me in Russian. For the Russian language and purity of style I am indebted to no one but myself, both in poetry and prose.\n\nIn 1747–1748 Sumarokov published his first major works, at his own cost, at the Academy of Sciences typography. These included the tragedies Khorev (1747) and Gamlet (Hamlet, 1748) and Dve epistoly (Two Epistles, 1748), one epistle on the Russian language and the other on the art of poetry. They established Sumarokov as a major figure in Russian letters and helped to galvanize support of other young poets, mostly graduates of the corps, around him. The epistles, a “manifesto of Russian classicism,” were based on Boileau’s L’Art poétique (1674) — which was in turn based on Horace — and set forth Sumarokov’s Russianized version of the classicist hierarchy of genres. The author triumphantly concluded: Всё хвально: драма ли, эклога или ода — Слагай, к чему тебя влечет твоя природа; Лишь просвещение писатель дай уму: Прекрасный наш язык способен ко всему. (All are laudable: the drama, eclogue, or ode — / Compose that to which your nature draws you; / Only, writer, let your mind be enlightened: / Our beautiful tongue is capable of anything!)\n\nSumarokov’s tragedies, written in the Russian equivalent of French Alexandrine verse (iambic hexameter with caesura after the third foot, with paired rhymes), employed a minimum of means — few characters, little action or plot, abstract settings (mostly labeled as ancient Russia), and no props except a dagger (traditional symbol of tragic theater) — to maximum emotional and emotive effect. All share a classical (mostly five-act) structure and observe the three unities of space, time, and action. The crisis usually involves two lovers’ struggle between love and duty on the one hand and their conflict with the throne (a jealous, evil, or badly advised monarch) on the other. Sumarokov’s tragedies have been called “a school of civic virtue,” embodying an enlightened ideal of the Russian nobility’s new corporate sense of honor and admonitions to the autocracy to rule justly under law. 10\n\nChapter 1. Sumarokov: Life and Works\n\nPerhaps in response to Trediakovskii’s criticism that tragedy should be “an imitation of God’s actions on earth,” with evil defeated and good triumphant, Sumarokov gave Hamlet and most of his later tragedies happy endings (hence Hamlet lives to marry Ophelia and ascend the Danish throne). For his basic acquaintance with William Shakespeare’s play Sumarokov was indebted to Pierre Antoine de La Place’s 1745 French translation, although records in the Academy of Sciences library indicate that Sumarokov, who did not know English, borrowed the fourth folio version of Shakespeare’s plays from the Academy of Sciences library. However, apart from the famous “To be, or not to be” monologue — for which Sumarokov consulted (and borrowed from) Voltaire’s version in the Lettres philosophiques (1734) — Sumarokov himself noted that his version “hardly resembles” Shakespeare’s tragedy. While the later tradition tended to see Sumarokov’s play as a travesty of Shakespeare, several modern critics have been more charitable toward Sumarokov’s attempt to create a unique play. Sumarokov’s tragedies, staged by cadets at the corps with all-male casts, were brought to Elizabeth’s attention by Razumovskii. The empress invited the cadets to perform at court in early 1750 and took a personal hand in dressing up the handsome young cadets in lavish regalia and even lent the leading “lady” her crown diamonds. The performances were a great success, and in 1750–1751 Sumarokov added Sinav i Truvor (Sinav and Truvor, 1751), Artistona (1751), and Semira (1768) to his tragedic repertoire; Sumarokov was doubtless pleased when the tragedies commissioned from his rivals Trediakovskii and Lomonosov proved unworthy of the stage. Sumarokov also wrote the first Russian comedies, in prose, the one-act Tresotinius (1786) and Chudovishchi (Monsters, 1786), which Sumarokov later renamed “Treteinoi sud” (Court of Arbitration); posthumous editions of the play mistakenly retained the discarded title. These were transparently satiric burlesques, closer to the old intermedia — brief comical interludes that came in between acts of the often interminably long school dramas — or to Russian igrishchi (folk farces) which Sumarokov theoretically repudiated, rather than to classical comedy. On August 30,1756, Elizabeth brought a national Russian theater into being by official proclamation. The kernel of the troupe was formed by actors from Fedor Volkov’s private Yaroslavl troupe, which had been brought to the capital to perform at court in 1750; several actors had been subsequently sent to the corps for further training. Sumarokov was named director and assigned a yearly salary of one thousand rubles beyond what he received according to his rank of brigadier, although from that date Sumarokov was freed from his other official responsibilities. 11\n\nPart One. Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nDuring the later 1750’s Sumarokov also regularly contributed poetry to the Academy of Sciences miscellany Ezhemesiachnye sochineniia (Monthly Compositions), actively experimenting in a variety of verse forms and genres. In 1759 he published his own journal, Trudoliubivaia pchela (The Industrious Bee), the first private literary journal in Russia, although precedence is sometimes accorded to Prazdnoe vremia, v pol’zu upotreblennoe (Idle Time Used Well), begun the same year by former cadets and to which Sumarokov also contributed. Sumarokov dedicated Trudoliubivaia pchela to Catherine, an act of considerable boldness considering that the Grand Princess was in disgrace following a failed court intrigue in 1758. The episode had resulted in Aleksei Bestuzhev-Riumin’s arrest; according to one source Sumarokov himself was subjected to interrogation during the investigation. Trudoliubivaia pchela included essays on history, philosophy, and literature, as well as original poetry (mostly Sumarokov’s) and translations from classical and modern authors (including Voltaire and Jonathan Swift). Particularly notable were Sumarokov’s satiric essays, which served as prototypes for the later Russian satiric journals. Among his targets were the abuse of serfs by landowners, bribe-taking, favoritism, and other bureaucratic and social ills — themes that informed many of Sumarokov’s works (especially his fables) throughout his later career. Increasing difficulties with censors at the academy typography, some of them instigated by his archenemy Lomonosov, forced Sumarokov to cease publication of the journal after a year. The final issue included the poem “Farewell to the Muses” (Rasstavanie s muzami) in which Sumarokov vowed never to write again, a vow the author was to make and break repeatedly in future years. Sumarokov met with even greater frustrations organizing the new Russian theater. Although it became an official “court” (rather than “free”) theater in 1759 and hence presumably eligible for greater state support, Sumarokov was burdened by constant financial hardships — his salary withheld; no money to pay the actors or his own rent; lack of costumes, which forced cancellation of performances; no stagehands or other assistants; and at times not even enough to eat. On top of this there were endless bureaucratic obstacles put in his way by the officials on whom he had to rely, especially K. I. Sivers (Sumarokov had his revenge by ridiculing him in a memorable article in Trudoliubivaia pchela). Among other problems with which Sumarokov was forced to contend were the lack of a fixed venue for the theater, competition with French and Italian troupes (which were far better paid) and other court activities, performances canceled due to a prematurely thawed Neva River (preventing its crossing by travelers), and his own illnesses. Sumarokov struggled heroically to improve 12\n\nChapter 1. Sumarokov: Life and Works\n\nconditions for his troupe; for instance, he fought to get them decent medical care and the privilege for his male actors to wear swords (a sign of noble prerogative). After repeated threats to resign from the theater, Sumarokov was finally taken at his word and forced out of the directorship in 1761. Apart from his writing, Sumarokov laid the institutional groundwork for the later Imperial Russian Theater and helped establish a tradition of distinguished Russian acting that lasted well into the nineteenth century. Sumarokov complained of having little time to write, but in the later 1750’s he managed to compose a sixth tragedy, Dimiza (1758), later revised as Iaropolk i Dimiza (1768); a “drama,” Pustynnik (The Hermit, 1769), written in 1757; the first Russian operas, Tsefal i Prokris (Cephalus and Procris, 1755) and Al’tsesta (Alceste, 1759), with music by Francesco Araia and Hermann Friedrich Raupach, respectively; the ballet Pribezhishche dobrodeteli (Sanctuary for Virtue, 1759), choreographed by Franz Anton Christophe Hilferding; and an allegorical prologue, Novye lavry (New Laurels, 1759), to celebrate the Russian army’s victory over the Prussians near Frankfurt. In the early 1760’s he also contributed to the new Moscow journals Poleznoe uveselenie (Useful Amusement, 1760–1762) and Svobodnye chasy (Free Hours, 1763), around which a new generation of young poets had arisen, including Mikhail Kheraskov, A. A. Rzhevskii, and Vasilii Maikov, commonly referred to (after Gukovskii) as the “Sumarokov school.” Catherine the Great’s coup of June 28, 1762, which put an end to her husband Peter III’s brief reign, promised Sumarokov good fortune. He was promoted in rank, and his debts to the academy typography (which had vexed him since 1748) were annulled, although he spent many years trying to collect money that he felt had been wrongly withheld during his tenure at the theater. Catherine also granted Sumarokov the unique lifetime privilege of having all of his works printed at her cost, which may help explain Sumarokov’s prodigious list of publications. Their popularity, given the nebulous nature of the Russian reading public in the eighteenth century, is hard to gauge, although many of his contemporaries unquestionably considered Sumarokov’s work to be classic. Catherine’s ascension must have seemed to Sumarokov like a triumph for his own political ideals, and he celebrated the empress in a series of laudatory odes (notably, in the later 1750’s he had largely disdained writing such works to Elizabeth). The longest of these, an ode printed on July 8, 1762, and reissued three weeks later, has been called a poeticized version of the famous manifesto that Catherine had published on coming to the throne, in which she echoed Montesquieu’s condemnation of despotism and praise of monarchy based on law. 13\n\nPart One. Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nAt the same time Sumarokov found himself in a somewhat unusual position professionally, since he continued to receive a salary but had no official position or duties; in 1764 he even proposed that Catherine finance a trip to France and Italy so that he could write travel notes for the edification of his countrymen. Committed both to the political program of enlightened monarchy which Catherine espoused and to the prestige and independence of Russian letters, Sumarokov increasingly found himself in a quandary, as his personal and political impertinences often threatened to alienate the empress, on whose goodwill he relied both as writer and ideologue. The first indications of a problem may have been that Sumarokov did not publish his outspoken coronation speech of September 22, 1762, and that a portion of his “Chorus to a Perverted World” (Khor ko prevratnomu svetu) was cut from the published verses he had written for the elaborate three-day celebration titled “Minerva Triumphant” (Torzhestvuiushchaia Minerva), which he helped organize together with Volkov and Kheraskov and which was held in Moscow in early 1763 to honor Catherine’s coronation; both works were first published in the posthumous complete works. Other, more certain grounds for Catherine’s discontent were an ode Sumarokov dedicated to her former lover, the Polish king Stanislav Augustus, in 1765 (she ordered the Academy to burn the work, and no copies have survived) and the satiric fable “Two Cooks” (Dva povara), published the same year, which she had confiscated. Sumarokov’s letters to Catherine with which he often “bombarded” her (as she put it) are remarkable for their frank and outspoken tone and as expressions of Sumarokov’s marked self-regard as a poet. Sumarokov’s father died in 1766, and a scandal ensued when Sumarokov went to Moscow to claim his inheritance; Catherine intervened on his mother’s behalf after she appealed to the empress for protection against her son, who had terrified her household and threatened her with physical violence. Sumarokov was enraged at the thought that his mother was taking sides against him with his hated brother-in-law A. I. Buturlin (whom the poet lampooned in several of his comedies). The situation was probably complicated by the fact that by this time Sumarokov’s wife had left him and he had taken up with a serf woman, Vera Prokhorovna, whom he officially married in 1774; some have speculated that this relationship may have brought the poet some measure of social ostracism. Prokhorovna bore Sumarokov two more children, Anastasiia and Pavel, who received gentry status at the time of their parents’ marriage. In his response to the essay contest Catherine suggested to the Free Economic Society in 1766 concerning the desirability of granting property 14\n\nChapter 1. Sumarokov: Life and Works\n\nrights to peasants and in his notes on the draft of the empress’s Nakaz (Instruction, 1767), Sumarokov staunchly defended the institution of serfdom. Catherine was apparently not pleased with what he wrote and commented that “Mr. Sumarokov is a good poet but . . . he does not have sufficient clarity of mind to be a good lawgiver.” Be that as it may, Sumarokov was an outspoken defender of serfs’ human and legal rights and sharply attacked such practices as selling serfs “like cattle,” that is, apart from their land. While asserting fundamental human equality according to nature, Sumarokov also defended the necessity of social hierarchy. The essential point was that each social order fulfill its duty appropriately. Some of his most memorable attacks were against pod’iachie (clerks or bureaucrats), in which category he sometimes included those granted noble status by appointment, and against otkupshchiki (concessionaires), notorious in the eighteenth century for extorting high prices for vodka after obtaining the right to sell it under the state liquor monopoly. But the main target as well as audience for Sumarokov’s admonitions was his own class, the hereditary Russian nobility. As he wrote in his programmatic satire “On Nobility” (O blagorodstve, 1774); Дворяне без меня свой долг довольно знают, Но многие одно дворянство вспоминают, Не помня, что от баб рожденным и от дам Без исключения всем праотец Адам. На то ль дворяне мы, чтоб люди работали, А мы бы их труды по знатности глотали? . . . Не в титле — в действии быть должен дворянином . . . (The nobles know their duty quite well without me, / But many only recall their nobility, / Forgetting that all people, born of country gals or ladies / Without exception have Adam as progenitor. / Are we nobles so that people should work, / So that we exalted ones swallow up their labor? . . . / One must be noble not in title but in action . . . )\n\nThe failure to keep to one’s proper station is repeatedly ridiculed in Sumarokov’s fables, published in three volumes between 1762 and 1769 (three more books of fables were published in his collected works, bringing the total number of fables to about 380). Among Sumarokov’s most popular works during his lifetime, the fables were full of coarse humor and sharp, mocking invective and were often directed at contemporary political targets or literary enemies. They were also among his most innovative works, written mostly in iambic lines of varied length and capturing the dynamic intonations of popular and folk speech. While such things were permissible in a “low” genre such as the fable, Sumarokov resolutely rejected those new bourgeois 15\n\nPart One. Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nliterary phenomena that he felt threatened the classical hierarchy. He was disdainful of the flood of translated novels that hit Russia in the 1760’s (and scornful of their Russian imitations by writers like Fedor Emin) and resolutely opposed the new dramas that combined comic and tragic elements. In the preface to Dimitrii Samozvanets (Dimitrii the Pretender, 1771) Sumarokov triumphantly published a letter written to him by Voltaire dated February 26, 1769 (new style), in which Voltaire praised Sumarokov and approved his rejection of “comédies larmoyantes” (tearful comedies). On January 26, 1767, Catherine awarded Sumarokov the Order of Anna, possibly in part for several more odes he had written to her. He was in Moscow during the summer of that year while Catherine was organizing the Commission for a New Law Code. He spent 1768 and early 1769 in St. Petersburg, where he published a prodigious number of old, new, and revised works, including the comedies Likhoimets (The Extortioner, 1768), Iadovityi (The Poisonous One, 1768), Tri brata sovmestniki (Three Brother Rivals, 1768), Nartsiss (Narcissus, 1769), and Pridannoe obmanom (Dowry by Deceit, 1769); the popular but heretofore unpublished tragedy Semira, written in 1751; revised versions of Khorev, Sinav i Truvor, Iaropolk i Dimiza, and Pustynnik; and his seventh tragedy, Vysheslav (1768). In addition he published his historical essay Pervyi i glavnyi streletskii bunt (The First and Main Streltsy Uprising, 1768) and the collection Raznyia stikhotvoreniia (Various Poems, 1769), as well as the third volume of his fables. In March 1769 Sumarokov moved to Moscow, where he became involved in complicated negotiations to establish a permanent theater there. He managed to quarrel with many people in the theatrical world, which led to a conspiracy to embarrass the extraordinarily vain author publicly. At the center was Moscow’s commander in chief Count P. S. Saltykov. Saltykov forced Belmonti’s troupe to stage Sinav and Truvor on January 31, 1770, despite the fact that the actors were not ready or willing and violating Sumarokov’s contract with Belmonti that explicitly forbade him to put on any of Sumarokov’s plays without the author’s permission. Two days before the performance Sumarokov took to his bed in grief and from there wrote a series of desperate letters to Catherine imploring her help. In one he included an autobiographical elegy — “Now my vexation has exceeded all bounds” (Vse mery prevoshla teper’ moia dosada), and in another he appealed to her, citing lines adapted from his recent tragedy Vysheslav: “Не емлю сил вельмож вокруг стоящих трона, / И от предписанна рукой твоей закона” (I have neither the power of grandees who surround the throne, / Nor that of the law prescribed by your hand). Catherine responded caustically that “it will always be more pleasant for me to see presentations of 16\n\nChapter 1. Sumarokov: Life and Works\n\npassion in your plays than to read them in your letters.” It was a remarkable exchange over the proper limits of literature between the Classicist poet and the enlightened despot. On the accompanying letter Sumarokov had written to her secretary, Catherine noted to herself with a pun, “Sumarokov bez uma est’ i budet” (Sumarokov is and will be brainless). The scandal continued as Saltykov circulated copies of Catherine’s letter to the poet, and mocking epigrams proliferated, including one against Sumarokov by the young Derzhavin. Catherine’s refusal to intervene dramatically demonstrated the limits of her patronage and possibly also her impatience with Russian writers in general (although it should be noted that her intervention would have been against a trusted senior official). This was the period (1769–1774) of the short-lived satiric journals that Catherine’s Vsiakaia vsiachina (All Sorts and Sundries) had initiated. Sumarokov contributed little to them, but his works were held up as the prime example of “satira na litso” (personal satire), which Novikov in particular advocated, as opposed to the generalized “satira na porok” (satire of vices), which the empress tried to promote. Catherine’s political liberalism was wearing thin, and she tried increasingly to regulate Russian letters, either through her own efforts or by turning to such truly subservient court poets as Vasilii Petrov. Characteristically, two years earlier Catherine had again played the role of Sumarokov’s personal censor and, despite Sumarokov’s protests, had supported theater director Ivan Elagin’s excision of several lines from the comedy Likhoimets that referred to religion and to the Commission on the New Law Code in a flippant manner. Despite the debacle in Moscow, Sumarokov completed his next and by general consensus his greatest tragedy, Dimitrii the Pretender, which opened in St. Petersburg on February 1, 1771. In the foreword to the play Sumarokov lambasted Pierre-Augustin Beaumarchais’s tearful drama Eugénie (1767) and the Moscow audiences that had recently applauded a Russian version of it; he appended Voltaire’s letter, which had become a kind of talisman for the beleaguered author. Dimitrii the Pretender, set during the time of troubles of the early seventeenth century, was the most contemporary, most truly historical, and most patriotic of Sumarokov’s tragedies, which the author said would “show Russia Shakespeare.” Dimitrii was Sumarokov’s most shocking anti-utopian tyrant, and the play balances between a staunch defense of the hierarchical and autocratic principle, on the one hand, and legitimacy based on merit rather than birth, on the other — “Коль он достоин царь, достоин царска сана” (He is a worthy tsar if he is worthy of the tsar’s station). At the end of the play nobles and people alike rise up to oust Dimitrii, to the chiming of Kremlin bells. Dimitrii the Pretender remained in the repertory through 1812 and was 17\n\nPart One. Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nthe prototype for many later plays on the theme, most notably Alexander Pushkin’s Boris Godunov (1831). Scholars have tried, not too successfully, to see this and other of Sumarokov’s tragedies as covert commentaries on specific contemporary issues (that is, as criticisms of Elizabeth’s or Catherine’s despotism), but their fundamental political message — a defense of lawful monarchy and an attack on the abuses of despotism — is clear. Nevertheless, Sumarokov’s eloquent denunciations of tyranny were a starting point for the republican trend in later Russian literature, most notably Iakov Kniazhnin’s Vadim Novgorodskii (Vadim of Novgorod, 1793), which Catherine had burned and which was in turn a link to the Decembrists. Dimitrii the Pretender also presented a defense of Russian Orthodoxy, which was juxtaposed to Catholicism’s “false doctrine” that demanded blind obedience. Characteristically, Sumarokov advocated a rationalistic view of Orthodoxy that did not see any necessary or apparent contradiction between reason and divine revelation. Sumarokov’s religious thought was in the quasi-Protestant tradition of Feofan Prokopovich, main architect of Peter I’s church reform, a stance characteristic of eighteenth-century Russian religious thought. The harmonizing of faith and reason also corresponded to the midcentury attempt to create a new literary language based on both Church Slavonic and vulgar Russian, so-called “Slavenorossiiskii” (Slaveno-Russian), and to the blurring of boundaries between religious and secular literature (secular poets writing psalm paraphrases, as well as clerics writing sermons and catechisms in the vernacular). While Sumarokov was an advocate of such a literary, linguistic, and philosophical rapprochement between secular and religious traditions, in subsequent literary consciousness he was largely associated with Karamzin’s reforms, which were oriented on the secular spoken language of the salon; this association occurred partially by negative analogy with Trediakovskii, who was identified with the camp of the politically and religiously conservative arkhaisty (archaists). On March 29, 1771, Sumarokov renewed his agreement with Belmonti, paving the way to present his works on the Moscow stage, but all plans were postponed when the black plague began to ravage the city. Sumarokov left Moscow on account of the epidemic and did not return until April 1772, to find Belmonti dead and most of the actors scattered. Again Sumarokov involved himself in the politics of theatrical plans and proposals. Despite chronic medical problems, he also continued to write. On Metropolitan Platon’s advice he finished his poetic paraphrase of the Psalter, which he published in 1774. The same year saw publication of collections of his Eklogi (Eclogues); Elegii liubovnyia (Love Elegies); Ody torzhestvennyia (Triumphal 18\n\nChapter 1. Sumarokov: Life and Works\n\nOdes); Satiry (Satires); his last tragedy, Mstislav; and several shorter works, including poems decrying the Pugachev rebellion. He also continued to write comedies; his last three — Rogonosets po voobrazheniiu (The Imaginary Cuckold, 1786), Mat’ sovmestnitsa docheri (Mother-Daughter Rivalry, 1786), Vzdorshchitsa (The Argumentative One, 1786) — manifest the influence of Denis Fonvizin’s Brigadir (wtn. 1769) in their depiction of Russian types and their earthy language. Many readers consider Rogonosets a minor masterpiece. While he continued to publish through 1775, Sumarokov was afflicted in his final years by sickness, poverty, and probably alcoholism. He spent part of 1773 and 1774 in St. Petersburg, where with the help of his new patron, Grigorii Potemkin, he arranged for his son Pavel’s entry into the Preobrazhenskii Regiment and attended the presentation of Mstislav. In Moscow accumulated unpaid debts threatened to deprive the poet and his family of their home, and he was further insulted when refused the customary free entrance to performances of his own work. He published his last ode to Catherine in July 1775, celebrating the peace of Kuchuk-Kainardji, but financial relief was not forthcoming from the empress. A final crisis occurred after the death of Sumarokov’s wife Vera in May 1777, as Sumarokov’s mother unsuccessfully attempted to prevent her son’s third marriage to another serf, his second wife’s niece Elena Gavrilova. The details are obscure, but Sumarokov may have desired the marriage to protect his daughter or perhaps simply to have someone to take care of him. He died on October 1, 1777, approximately four months after this marriage and just a few days after his Moscow home had been sold at auction for debts. Legend has it that almost no one attended the funeral of the destitute poet, apart from several Moscow actors who had carried his coffin to the Donskoi Monastery, where he was buried in an unmarked grave. A lasting monument to the writer was the exemplary ten-volume Polnoe sobranie vsekh sochinenii, v stikhakh i proze (Complete Works in Verse and Prose) published by Novikov in 1781–1782 and revised in 1787. Unfortunately, the poet’s papers, which Novikov rescued after Sumarokov’s death and used for the complete works, were lost after the editor’s arrest in 1792. Although in the nineteenth century Sumarokov’s name became synonymous with Russian “pseudo-classicism,” a term that denied to most eighteenth-century writing the right to be considered as literature, in 1772 Novikov expressed the prevailing view of Sumarokov’s contemporaries when he wrote that the poet had “achieved great and immortal fame for himself via works in a variety of poetic and prose genres, not only from Russians but from foreign Academies and from the most famous European writers.” 19\n\nPart One.

Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\n2\n\nSUMAROKOV’S READING AT THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LIBRARY\n\nAlthough Alexander Sumarokov played a central role in establishing eighteenth-century Russian literature, we have at our disposal relatively little information concerning his biography and the creative history of his works. The remnants of his personal archive that Nikolai Novikov used in preparing the posthumous Full Collected Works in Verse and Prose (Polnoe sobranie vsekh sochinenii, v stikhakh i proze) of 1781–82 (second edition, 1787) were lost after the arrest and exile of the publisher-editor. For this reason, almost any new information on Sumarokov, particularly concerning his early career before his appointment as director of the first Russian national theater in 1756, are particularly valuable. This article consists of an annotated list of books that Sumarokov borrowed from the Library of the Academy of Sciences in the late 1740’s and in 1755. The list is of interest not only as a source of information about Sumarokov and his literary activities but also as evidence of Russian interest in various classical and modern European writers. Of special note is the fact that Sumarokov borrowed Shakespeare in the fourth folio edition, the earliest evidence of Russian acquaintance with the bard in English. The accompanying list is based on materials from the St. Petersburg branch of the Academy of Sciences Archive. It documents twenty-two works that Sumarokov borrowed from the Academy Library. The list is divided into two parts. The second is based on discharges recorded in the Library’s “record of books issued” (zhurnal vydachi knig), which indicates not only the year (1755) but also the precise day on which Sumarokov borrowed particular books (f. 158, op. 1, no. 410, l. 15). It is more difficult to determine the purpose and dating of the document on which the first part of the list is based (f. 158, op. 1, d. 407, l. 9). Academicians frequently complained about the disorder (neporiadki) and neglect of books in the library when it was under the control of the Academy secretary and librarian Johann-Daniel 22\n\nChapter 2. Sumarokov’s Reading at the Academy of Sciences Library\n\nSchumacher (I.-D. Shumakher, 1690–1761). After Elizabeth’s ascension to the throne in 1741 an investigating commission was appointed, and for a time Schumacher was even held under arrest. However, he was subsequently fully rehabilitated with the help of influential friends at court.1 One of the repeated complaints about Schumacher was that the Library did not keep systematic records of the books it lent out. According to the report of the assembly of professors (professorskoe sobranie) of September, 1745, which was signed among others by Lomonosov and Trediakovskii, “the books that are given out to anyone are not recorded in a notebook, to [keep track of] whom they are lent to and when they are to be returned. In lending books from the library, records of borrowing (rospiski) are [made on] separate pages or on scraps [of paper], most of which get lost, so that when the books are returned one can’t get them back.2 And it is possible that many books were given out without records of borrowing, so it is not surprising that many library books have been lost.”3 It was only in the early 1750’s that yearly alphabetical journals began to be kept to keep track of borrowed books, but of these only a few have survived (those from 1753– 1755 and 1761–1762).4 The first document that provides evidence of the books Sumarokov borrowed in the late 1740’s is located in a folder with miscellaneous lists of books and borrowing receipts from various years. The document lists books “that are missing from the library” (headings on ll. 12–13). The list is organized by section of the library (by “kamora” or “kamera,” that is, by hall), which corresponds to the so-called “kamernyi katalog” of 1741–1742.5 All but one 1\n\n2 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nOn the Academy Library under Schumacher’s direction, see: P. P. Pekarskii, Istoriia Imperatorskoi akademii nauk v Peterburge, 2 vols. (1870–73; rpt. Leipzig: Zentralantiquariat der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik, 1977), 2: iv-xix, and via index; Istoricheskii ocherk i obzor fondov rukopisnogo otdela Biblioteki Akademii Nauk. Vyp. 1: XVIII vek (Moscow: Akademiia nauk SSSR, 1956), 171–176; S. P. Luppov and M. S. Filippov, et al., Istoriia Biblioteki Akademii nauk SSSR, 1714–1964 (Leningrad: Nauka, 1964), 39–43 and via the index. That is, borrowers were not given receipts for returned books. M. I. Sukhomlinov, Materialy dlia istorii Imperatorskoi Akademii nauk, vol. 7: 1744– 1745 (St. Petersburg, 1895), 640. I came across several of these “rospiski” among the pages of various volumes of the handwritten catalogue of 1751–1753 (f. 158, op. 1, № 154, 158, 163, 164). This suggests that the new procedures for borrowing were not instituted until after 1753. The receipts and other records of books borrowed from the Academy Library represent a very rich and practically untapped source of information about academicians, writers and translators in the mid-eighteenth century, and await systematic investigation. Bibliothecae Imperialis Petropolitanae, 4 vols. (St. Petersburg, 1741–42). 23\n\nPart One. Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nof Sumarokov’s books are under the rubric “Poetae” (Poets) and marked with numbers from that section of the catalogue (no. 14, Olearius’ travel memoir, is catalogued under “Exotica”). It is possible that this document is connected with the audit (reviziia) in the Library of 1744–1746 whose conduct Schumacher stubbornly resisted and the results of which have not survived.6 Because of this and the “disorders” in the Library it is difficult to determine the precise dates of borrowing. The preceding separate pages in the folder are lists of books borrowed through the end of 1745, ordered by surname of the borrowers (ll. 6–7).7 There is also a separate record for books lent to G. N. Teplov on June 29, 1747 (l. 8), that is probably the terminus post quem for Sumarokov’s borrowing. The terminus ante quem is difficult to determine for the simple reason that books may have been kept for a long time, or not even been returned. Nevertheless we may suggest that they were borrowed from the Library no later than 1746–1748 for the following reasons. First of all, among the borrowers listed together with Sumarokov is the Academy librarian and adjunct in history Johann Friedrich Brehm (Brem) who was fired from his Academy responsibilities on August 1, 1747.8 Secondly, it seems very likely that Sumarokov borrowed these books in connection with his work on the tragedy “Hamlet” (Gamlet) 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nAccording to M. N. Murzanova, “a fire in the Library in 1747 which followed put a definitive end to the further course of the audit” (Istoricheskii ocherk i obzor, 176). See also Istoriia Biblioteki, 42 and 80. It is possible that no audit took place at all; see Pekarskii, Istoriia Imperatorskoi akademii nauk, 2: xix. The latest date indicated on these pages is December 30, 1745 (l. 6). It is clearly for this reason that E. B. Ryss and G. M. Korovin ascribed them to this year. See their “M. V. Lomonosov — chitatel’ Biblioteki Peterburgskoi akademii nauk,” Trudy BAN SSSR i FBON AN SSSR, vol. 3 (Moscow, Leningrad: Akademiia nauk, 1958), 283 and 290. Pekarskii, Istoriia, I: 586. The documents also contain the names of: Christian Gottfried Crusius, professor of antiquities and the history of literature, who was released from service August 20, 1749 (he left Russia forever at the end of the month); and the professor of astronomy Christian Nicolaus von Winsheim (Vinzgeim) who died on March 4, 1751. On Crusius see Pekarskii, Istoriia, I: 696, and on Winsheim, see Akademiia Nauk SSSR, Personal’nyi sostav 1724–1974, vol. 1 (Moscow: Nauka, 1974), 8. Many books on this list were marked with the initials “G. H.” and were from among the books belonging to Pushkin’s great-grandfather Gibrahim Hannibal (Ibragim Gannibal). They had been confiscated in 1726 after the death of Peter I in connection with Hannibal’s exile and only returned to him in the 1740’s when he came back into favor. Unfortunately, a comparison of this document with the list of books returned to Hannibal and with the list of books that perished in the fire of December 5, 1747, did not shed any light on the date our list was compiled (SPb.O AAN, f. 158, op. 1, № 466, l. 7 ob.– 9 ob. and l. 1–6 ob.). On Hannibal’s books and the fire, see Istoriia Biblioteki, 48–50. 24\n\nChapter 2. Sumarokov’s Reading at the Academy of Sciences Library\n\nand the “Two Epistles,” which the writer submitted for publication in early October, 1748.9 (More on this below.) The record of books issued (zhurnal vydachi knig) for 1755, from which the second part of our list was compiled, is alphabetical. In it books that have been returned are crossed out. Some of the records only list the books by number, without title or author. A comparison of these numbers with the catalogues preserved in the Academy Archive reveals that they correspond to the large handwritten catalogue of books and manuscripts in foreign languages in 26 volumes, compiled in 1751–1753.10 A detailed examination of this catalogue, lacking an index, permitted us to determine the identity of all of the books except one (no. 12). In the appended list below, I have included both a modern bibliographical description of the given edition together with the notation from the 1751–1753 catalogue on whose basis the identification of the books was made. We now turn to the question of the possible importance of these books for Sumarokov. The two parts of the list relate to different periods of his literary activity. The first, from the late 1740’s, connects with Sumarokov’s earliest published works, the first two Russian-language tragedies “Khorev” (St. Petersburg, 1747) and “Hamlet” (St. Petersburg, 1748), and his “manifesto of Russian Classicism” the “Two Epistles” (St. Petersburg, 1748).11 The second part relates to the period of his participation in the new journal Ezhemesiachnyia sochineniia (Monthly Compositions). All of the books in the first group — the works of Shakespeare, Vondel, Scarron, and French translations of Lucan and Virgil — are directly relevant to Sumarokov’s work on the “Two Epistles.” The epistles, which included “Notes,” a short annotated list of writers, as an appendix, served as a kind of Cliff Notes designed for “the reader lacking in elementary knowledge of literary history.”12 All of the authors of the first part of our list are named 9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nSee chap. 3 “Censorship and Provocation: The Publication History of Sumarokov’s ‘Two Epistles’.” Catalogi Generalioris Bibliothecae Imperialis Petropolitanae, SPb.O AAN, f. 158, op. 1 № 142–143 (1751), 144–152 (1752), 153–167 (1753). On this catalogue, see Istoriia Bibliteki, 115–117 This does not include his ode to Anna Ioanovna published in 1740, written in the name of the Cadet Corps, and the anonymous brochure Tri ody parafrasticheskie Psalma 143, sochinennyia chrez trekh stikhotvortsev (St. Petersburg, 1744).

Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nin the “Two Epistles” except for Scarron, who is clearly referred to in the section on mock heroic (iroi-komicheskie) poems in the second epistle (II: 285–310).13 (We would note that Sumarokov’s validation of the genre contradicted Boileau, who excluded “coarse” burlesque, and it is probably for this reason that Scarron’s name was not mentioned.14) As is well known, in the epistles Sumarokov followed Voltaire in his description of Shakespeare as a writer who deserves a place on Helicon “although [he was] unenlightened” (II: 38), a writer “in whom there is much that is bad and very much that is extraordinarily good” (from the “Notes” to the epistles). That Sumarokov was acquainted with Shakespeare’s texts in English represents an unexpected discovery both for scholars of Sumarokov and of Shakespeare’s influence in Russia, although it should be recalled that the bare fact of borrowing a book from the library in and of itself proves little, especially in the given case when there is no evidence that Sumarokov knew any English. The same goes for his acquaintance with the tragedies of the Dutch playwright Joost van den Vondel (1587–1679), whom he could hardly read in the original. In his response to Trediakovskii’s criticism of his “Hamlet” in 1750, Sumarokov wrote: “My Hamlet, he [Trediakovskii] says, . . . is translated from the French prose [version] of the English tragedy by Shakespeare, but he is very mistaken. My Hamlet, except for the monologue at the end of the third act and Claudius’ falling down onto his knees hardly, hardly resembles Shakespeare’s tragedy” (PSVS X: 117). Perhaps intentionally, Sumarokov does not specify what Trediakovskii’s precise error is, and which version — the original or P.-A. LaPlace’s translation — he consulted in writing his play. A comparison of texts indicates that his adaptation of the passages in question was indeed based on LaPlace’s version (from the second volume of Le theatre anglois of 1746) with the notable influence of Voltaire’s earlier verse translation of the famous “To be or not to be” monologue. Still, the relationship between English, French and Russian texts of “Hamlet,” as well as the influence of Shakespeare on 13\n\n14\n\nIn citing the “Two Epistles” the Roman numeral I refers to first and II to second.

Drinov, 1999). 26\n\nChapter 2. Sumarokov’s Reading at the Academy of Sciences Library\n\nSumarokov’s later plays, still awaits detailed investigation.15 Nevertheless, whatever our conclusions, the list published below is the earliest evidence of acquaintance with in Shakespeare’s original texts in Russia. In the “Two Epistles” among the writers reigning on Mount Helicon Sumarokov names “the incomparable Virgil” and Lucan (II: 44 and 46). In his notes on these writers Sumarokov mentions the “Pharsalia” by Lucan (Marcus Annaeus Lucanus) and Virgil’s “Eclogues.” Sumarokov borrowed both of these works in French translation (no. 2 and 4). He remarked on Lucan in his “Notes” that “He was in great favor with Nero, but later was murdered by this torturer by opening his veins. He wrote a poem about the Battle of Pharsalia between Caesar and Pompey.” Characteristically, Sumarokov is interested in both the writer’s literary achievement (his unfinished epic poem in ten books) as well as his fate as court poet.16 The same may be said of his note on Virgil, where most attention is paid to the Aeneid. Among other things, Sumarokov writes (echoing the commonplace from Pliny and Suetonius): “In his ‘Eclogues’ he imitated Theocritus, in the ’Georgics’ Hesiod, in the ‘Aeneid’ Homer.” In the epistle on poetry, the pastoral genres of eclogue and idyll occupy a central place (II: 65–86 and 365–376). Sumarokov only began to try his own hand at eclogues in the second half of the 1750’s (excluding a translation of Fontenelle’s fifth eclogue — see note 29), but by 1774 had written a sufficient number for a separate edition.17 Four other classical writers from among the books Sumarokov borrowed in 1755 — Horace, Tibullus, Propertius and Pindar (nos. 6, 7, 16, 17) — are also described in the “Notes” to the epistles. The books Sumarokov took out between March 21 and August 24, 1755, relate to the period of his active participation in the new journal Ezhemesiachnyia sochineniia k pol’ze i uveseleniiu sluzhashchie (Monthly 15\n\n16\n\n17\n\nSee my subsequent examination of the textual issue in “Sumarokov’s Russianized ‘Hamlet’: Texts and Contexts,” chap. 5 below. Cf. Sumarokov’s references to Roman poets in his later letters to Catherine the Great. For example, on January 28, 1770, he complained of his enemies that “they treat a well-known poet more autocratically and more cruelly than Nero. He was a Roman emperor; but even he supported all poets except Lucan” (Pis’ma russkikh pisatelei XVIII veka [Leningrad: Nauka, 1980], 127–28). Eklogi Aleksandra Sumarokova (St. Petersburg, 1774).

Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nCompositions Providing Utility and Enjoyment, 1755–1764) published by the Academy of Sciences.18 This was Russia’s first popular literary and scientific journal. A. N. Neustroev noted that “During the entire course of its ten-year publication Monthly Compositions was read greedily by the Russian public despite the fact that belles letters occupied a lesser place than other types of literature.”19 Prior to the creation of his own literary journal Trudoliubivaia pchela (The Industrious Bee) in 1759 and of Prazdnoe vremia v pol’zu upotreblennoe (Idle Time Spent Usefully) (1759–60) this was Sumarokov’s only outlet for publishing his shorter (non-dramatic) works, and he made ample use of it. As the Academician Jakob von Staehlin (Ia. Ia. Shtelin) recalled, “brigadier Sumarokov even made it a rule for himself that not a single issue of the Monthly booklet would come out without him sending a poem to it, and therefore every month for several years running one could find one or more of his works in it.”20 This is no exaggeration; during the period of his collaboration with the journal, he published 98 original poems and 11 verse translations in it, and in 1755–56 his works appeared in 19 of 24 issues. At this time Sumarokov was intensively experimenting with new genres and types of versification. In the unpublished article “On Meter” (O stoposlozhenii) he later wrote that during his years of friendship with Lomonosov (i.e., the late 1740’s) he still “did not understand the nuances of versification; but after long term practice I gained a true understanding of it for myself ” (PSVS X: 56). These words probably relate to the period of his writing for Monthly Compositions, a time when he was involved in an open dispute with Trediakovskii over questions of versification and tried his hand at many types of classical, folk, and contemporary European meters and strophic forms. The extent of Sumarokov’s experimentation with genres is remarkable: he wrote triumphant and spiritual odes, sonnets, fables, songs, ballads, madrigals, idylls, stanzas, inscriptions, imitations of classical stanzas (Sapphic, Anacreontic, Horatian), translations from German (sonnets by Paul Fleming) and French (works by Racine, 18\n\n19 20\n\nThe name of the journal subsequently changed twice: from Ezhemesiachnyia sochineniia k pol’ze i uveseleniiu sluzhashchie (1755–1757) it became Sochineniia i perevody k pol’ze i uveseleniiu sluzhashchie (1758–1762) and then Ezhemesiachnyia sochineniia i izvestiia o uchenykh delakh (1763–1764).

If in the late 1740’s Sumarokov wanted to become Russia’s first tragedian and literary lawgiver, he now wanted to prove his right to the title (in Trediakovskii’s words) of “father of Russian poetry.” Our goal here is not to provide a detailed comparison of the works in our list with Sumarokov’s publications in Monthly Compositions, but we may point to several major coincidences and problems for further investigation. It is clear that Sumarokov borrowed the three editions of Paul Fleming at the end of March, 1755 (nos. 9. 10. 11) in connection with his translations of the German poet’s three “Moscow sonnets” published in the April issue of the journal. In connection with this project Sumarokov mostly likely also borrowed the travel memoir of Adam Olearius, Fleming’s colleague and companion in the diplomatic service; the memoir quotes Fleming’s sonnets.21 It was Sumarokov’s historical interest in seventeenth-century Moscow rather than questions of genre or versification that apparently inspired his interest in these works of this early Baroque German poet, although he soon became involved in a dispute with Trediakovskii over these issues.22 In his “Letter in Which is Contained A Discussion of the Poetry Published Up to Now by the Author of Two Odes, Two Tragedies and Two Epistles, Written from a Friend to a Friend” of 1750, Trediakovskii charged Sumarokov with ignorance of the classical tongues and called this one of his major weaknesses as a poet. “He does not have the slightest knowledge of the so-called scholarly languages, while it is at least necessary for him to know Latin . . . he doesn’t even know a brass farthing’s worth (ni pula) of Greek.”23 It is hard to know to what extent Trediakovskii’s criticism is justified. In the Cadet Corps Sumarokov had learned French and German, and studied Italian, but not Latin or Greek, and we have no evidence he studied them on 21\n\n22\n\n23\n\nSee no. 14 on the list below. Olearius’ work appeared in many editions and was widely translated. A French version was published by Abraham de Wicquefort (Voyages en Moscovie, Tartarie et Perse, par Adam Olearius, Paris, 1656), an English version was made by John Davies of Kidwelly (Travels of the Ambassadors sent by Frederic, Duke of Holstein, to the Great Duke of Muscovy and the King of Persia, London, 1662 and 1669); a Dutch translation was prepared by Dieterius van Wageningen (Beschrijvingh van de nieuwe Parciaensche ofte Orientaelsche Reyse, Utrecht, 1651); and Italian translation of the sections on Russia also appeared (Viaggi di Moscovia, Viterbo and Rome, 1658). See L. B. Modzalevslkii, Lomonosov i ego literaturnye otnosheniia v Akademii nauk (Iz istorii russkoi literatury i Prosveshcheniia serediny XVIII veka), Diss. Leningrad, 1947, 122, cited by L. I.

Sumarokov and the Literary Process of His Time\n\nhis own.24 Nevertheless, our list of books that includes nine editions in Latin or in Greek with Latin translation, and one each in English and Dutch may serve as circumstantial evidence of Sumarokov’s familiarity with (or at least interest in) the original texts. Many of Sumarokov’s borrowed works themselves might well be connected in one way or another with his disputes with Trediakovskii. They had long been quarrelling over metrics and versification. Their disagreements concerned both Trediakovskii’s New and Short Method for Writing Russian Verse (Novyi i kratkii sposob k slozheniiu rossiiskii stikhov) of 1735 and the revised Method for Writing Verse (Sposob k slozheniiu stikhov) that had appeared in the first volume of his Works and Translations of 1752. Polemics were renewed after the appearance of Trediakovskii’s article “On Ancient, Modern and Intermediate Russian Poetry” in the June, 1755, issue of Monthly Compositions. The article posed a challenge to Sumarokov both on the question of emulating classical meters and on the issue of whose opinions were to have priority for Russian verse. For the July issue of the journal Sumarokov submitted his own examples of Sapphic and Anacreontic odes together with a “Letter on Sapphic and Horatian Stanzas” written specifically as a refutation of Trediakovskii’s views.25 The Academy’s Assembly that had oversight over the contents of the journal offered Trediakovskii the opportunity to publicly respond to Sumarokov’s criticisms.26 Trediakovskii took them up on the offer and read his rejoinder at an Assembly meeting of June 19. Although the Assembly had already approved publication of Sumarokov’s article on June 12, it now decided not to allow the publication either of Sumarokov’s letter or Trediakovskii’s response.27 24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\nDocumentary material on Sumarokov’s education in the Cadet Corps is contained in the Tsentral’nyi gos. Voenno-istoricheskii Arkhiv (Moscow), f. 314, op. 1, d. 1629, l. 19 ob., 22, 49, 62 etc. (1738); f. 314, № 1850, l. 22 ob. (1739). Of course, we need to beware of mechanically associating time of publication with time of publication; as P. N. Berkov notes of Sumarokov’s “Oda Goratsianskaia,” it was not written in 1758, when it appeared in Monthly Compositions, but in the fall of 1754 (Sumarokov, Izbrannye proizvedeniia, 525). Protokoly zasedanii konterentsii imperatorskoi Akademii nauk s 1725 po 1803 god, vol. 2 (1744–1770) (St. Petersburg, 1899), 333. Protokoly zasedanii, 333. It seems to us that the discussion whether or not to allow Sumarokov’s “epistle” to be published relates not to the poem “Epistola (Zhelai, chtob na bregakh sikh muzy obitaly)” that appeared in the August issue of Monthly Compositions, as Pekarskii seems to assume (Istoriia, 2: 184), but to the “Letter on Sapphic and Horatian Stanzas.” The confusion stems from the fact that the Latin “epistola” is used for both words, epistle and letter. L. B. Modzalevskii apparently thought that the discussion concerned a different verse epistle — see his “Lomonosov 30\n\nChapter 2. Sumarokov’s Reading at the Academy of Sciences Library\n\nIt seems no accident that all of the Latin authors from the second part of our list were discussed in the seventh chapter of Tredikovskii’s 1752 Method, including Catullus, Statius and Claudius Claudian, references to whom we have not been able to find anywhere in Sumarokov’s works. Most likely, Sumarokov borrowed these works in order to verify or challenge the views of his opponent.28 In general, his interest in the classical poets he borrowed (Horace, Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, Statius, and Claudius Claudian in Latin, and Pindar and eight lyric poets in Greek) could be explained by his desire to reproduce classical meters and stanzas in Russian, stimulated by his disputes with Trediakovskii. His choice of poems to translate and publish in Monthly Compositions seems to have mostly been dictated by his desire to outdo his rival.29 Possibly, his borrowing of the four-volume French edition of Horace (no. 6) was also connected with this effort. The first volume contains a discussion of the problems of translating Horace by the well-known French Latinist André Dacier (1651–1722) which Trediakovskii later cited in his defense against Sumarokov’s criticisms.30 The fact that Sumarokov borrowed an Academy Library catalogue of classical and European poets (no. 8) might also be associated with these issues. The remaining two works on the list of books Sumarokov borrowed (nos. 13 and 15) are two well-known contemporary reference works for\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\ni ‘O kachestvakh stikhotvortsa rassuzhdenie’ (Iz istorii russkoi zhurnalistiki 1755 g.)” in Literaturnoe tvorchestvo M. V. Lomonosov: Issledovaniia i materialy (Moscow, Leningrad: Akademiia nauk SSSR, 1962), 159. Sumarokov’s treatise has only been partially preserved in the quotations cited by Trediakovskii in his letter of refutation, first published by Pekarskii in Istoriia, 2: 250–257. In his “Letter” of 1750 Trediakovskii had mocked Sumarokov saying that “clearly . . . he himself has never heard of the Theban war because Statius hasn’t been translated from Latin into French” (Kunik, Sbornik materialov, 2: 461). For example, Sumarokov translated the sonnet by Jacques Des Barreaux (1599–1673), “Dieu, tes jugements sont remplis d’équité” (Monthly Compositions, February, 1756, 146) that Trediakovskii had translated earlier for his New and Short Method of 1735 (Sbornik materialov, 1: 40; cf. Berdnikov, Schaslivyi feniks, 74–78). In the same work (1: 72) Trediakovskii had praised Bernard Fontenelle (1657–1757) as “reformer (ispravitel’) of the eclogue” and as model for bucolic verse, and Sumarokov’s first published eclogue was a translation of Fontenelle’s fifth eclogue; it appeared in that same year’s Monthly Compositions (March, 1756, 268–70). Pekarskii, Istoriia, 254. In 1752 Trediakovskii mentioned Dacier and his wife, the well known translator of Homer and Plutarch Anne Lefevre (d. 1720), as well as “the Jesuit Sanadon” (Noël Etienne Sanadon, 1676–1733), who took part in the 1735 edition of Horace on our list (no. 6).

The first is L’histoire poёtique, pour l’intelligence des poёtes & des auteurs anciens by Father Pierre Gautruche (1602–1681), entitled by its English translator as The Poetical History: Being a Complete Collection of all of the Histories that are Necessary for a Perfect Understanding of Greek and Latin Poets and Other Ancient Authors (London, 1701) (that is, a collection of mythological plots). It had undergone 17 editions by 1714 and been translated into practically all European languages. The second is the multivolume collection by Pierre Brumoy (168–1741) entitled Le theatre des grecs which contains: the complete Greek tragedies and comedies in French prose translations; excerpts on similar themes from Seneca and modern European Classicists (Corneille, Racine, Jean Rotrou, and the Italians Orsato Giustiniano and Ludovico Dolce, also translated into French); and a series of discussions of Greek theater and its relation to modern dramaturgy. Voltaire remarked that this publication was “one of the best and most useful that we have,” and it was also valued by Russian writers.31 Further exploration of the importance of these books for Sumarokov’s oeuvre is the subject for future research.\n\nLIST OF BOOKS THAT SUMAROKOV BORROWED FROM THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LIBRARY Note that in some cases the format of the book given in the list and in eighteenth-century Russian catalogues does not correspond to that given in later bibliographies. Eighteenth-century Russian catalogues were commonly divided into three formats (folio, quarto, and octavo; books of smaller format were grouped with the books in octavo), and the same edition was often published in multiple formats. These formats were not uniform and may 31\n\nMichel Prévost, and Roman d’Amat, ed., Dictionnaire de biographie française, fasc. 38 (Paris: Letouzey et Ané, 1954), 506. In his “Letter” criticizing Sumarokov Trediakovskii imagined how he would go about writing a tragedy about Oedipus. “Our author would not take Sophocles in the original, or did not [i.e., if he had already written such a play], because he doesn’t know a brass farthing’s worth of Greek; but he would get hold of the translation made by either Dacier or the one done by the Jesuit Brumoy (Briumoá)” (Kunik, Sbornik materialov, 2: 486). Tredikovskii himself also made used of Brumoy’s book (no. 15 on our list). In the last part of his “Treatise on Comedy” (Rassuzhdenie o komedii) of 1752, in a section left out of the printed version he referred to the “original” comedies of Aristophanes which he contrasted to “French copies . . . all of which I have in the Greek theater [i.e., Le Théâtre des Grecs] of the Jesuit Brumoy” (Pekarskii, Istoriia, 2: 168–169). 32\n\nChapter 2. Sumarokov’s Reading at the Academy of Sciences Library\n\nbe very close in size, thus easily leading to errors. We also need to keep in mind that (in the words of the report of the Assembly of Professors in 1745) “the printed and compiled catalogues are so defective that they could not be worse.”32 I.

In Dutch. BAN has a copy of this first volume that came from the collection of A. Vinius which was incorporated into the Academy Library after his death in 1718 by order of Peter I.34 Most likely this was the very book that Sumarokov used. The second volume was apparently not in the Academy Library, as the Kam. kat. (as well as later eighteenth century catalogues of the Library) only assign one number to the edition. 4. Sumarocoff.

The fact that in the “Two Epistles” Sumarokov refers to the famous caricature of Dido from the fourth book might speak in favor of the second, Elzevier, edition. II.
