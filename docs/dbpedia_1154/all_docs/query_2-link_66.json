One of a number of Western European medical practitioners vital to the Apothecary Chancery, the Muscovite palace medical department, writing such texts on the orders of Russian administrators was a key part of Collins’s job; once he – or one of his fellow physicians – had written the text in Latin, it was then translated into Chancery Russian, all the better to be consumed by the Russian elite.1 On this occasion, the narrative was one of global materia medica, told through stereotypes of the peoples of the early modern world. There are in creation peoples whose lives, customs, and thoughts are only of medical drugs; not one nation appears so unthoughtful as to – whether by accident or out of certain unavoidable necessities – fail to acquire and put into use drugs whose virtues are hidden from others. Brazilian tribes in America, naked and illiterate, nevertheless have their own, not unworthy medicines, having brought into use the tree sassafras, guaiacum, jalap, and many other plants of unusual powers. Miracles are told of the Chinese doctors, by whose art serious diseases are driven away without venesection or bloodletting, and with only the use of herbal simples of their own creation. Indians drive out illnesses with the steam from boiling herbs with special properties, not with the oils that slaves apply and gently scrape from nobles by hand, to which habit the nobles are so accustomed that they cannot sleep without it. Every year the great Mogul emperor of the Indians would elevate one of his doctors, and that doctor would hold forth his judgments on the excess or deficits of the emperor’s body. And\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n4\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 4\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nthere is an ancient custom amongst the Persians, to which Daniel may have referred to in his Prophecy in the presence of King Belshazzar. Arabs, Chaldeans, Greeks, Latins, allow any medicines (judged in their eyes to be healthy).2 This text, with its presentation of medical practitioners and their practices from around the early modern global world, reflects key aspects of early modern Russian medical culture. In documents from the sixteenth, seventeenth, and early eighteenth centuries, there is a notable focus on materia medica as both useful and potentially dangerous. The difference between a medicine consumed to help the human body and a potion that once consumed would harm it was never as significant as people wished it to be. Moreover, those objects can be traced through early modern trading networks to a wide range of geographical origins. Just as Collins here invokes the medical practices of both the Americas and East Asia, prescriptions written by him and his colleagues brought together ingredients from those far-flung locations, and many others besides. This material then points us in a very specific direction: to an examination of the materia medica of early modern Russia as a history of global connections shaping the practice of medicine.\n\nMateria Medica as Material Culture The paradox of early modern Russian medical records is that we have both notable survivals and problematic absences. In particular for the seventeenth century, we have sometimes day-by-day accounts of the specific medicaments prescribed to the tsar, a kind of detailed elite pharmacy record that has rarely survived in other locations. We also have lists of imports, inventories from the court medical department, reports of various kinds and a number of pharmacy texts. What we often lack are explanatory documents. In the case of most prescriptions, we are given the name of the patient, the name of the prescribing physician and/or the apothecary creating the medicine, and the list of ingredients. No mention of the disease treated. No mention of the medical theory underpinning diagnosis and cure. The clearest point emerging from these documents is the materials of pharmacy practice. These facts fundamentally shape the questions we can ask here, and take us in a useful direction for the history and science and medicine.\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 5\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nLooking at materials gives us a more tactile history than considering theory texts. We can move from theory – what should happen – to practice – what did happen. However, such tactile histories are hampered by the fact that too often the actual materials of historical science and medicine were destroyed or lost. Yet their absence should not mean that we should ignore them; they are simply too important a part of that history to leave aside. Here, we can circumvent this issue by looking at documents about materials. This does not give us the same view of historical scientific and medical practices as having the actual materials would, but it does give us a vital window onto that history. We can then ask, what can these materia medica documents tell us about early modern medicine? And in particular, what does the specific interest in medical drugs tell us about material culture and the history of science and medicine? Histories of pharmacy are numerous and are often focused on such a set of documents, where happenstance archival survivals allow us to see the everyday practices of a particular time and place. He Bian’s Know Your Remedies looks at the remarkable variety of documents on pharmacy shops in early modern China.3 Recent attention has been paid to the pharmacopoeia as a genre of text, notably the edited volume Drugs on the Page, focusing on those kinds of texts in the early modern Atlantic world.4 Major cities have often been the subject of such studies, such as Leigh Chipman’s on Mamluk Cairo, Hjalmar Fors’s work on Stockholm, Linda A. Newson’s on Colonial Lima, and James Shaw and Florence Welch’s work on Renaissance Florence.5 Histories of early modern science and medicine, including histories of pharmacy, rarely consider the Russian Empire, despite its being a major power. In part, this book is in this tradition of histories of pharmacy in major cities, being the first book devoted to pharmacy in early modern Moscow. The immediate locale of the Apothecary Chancery records is Moscow; their importance goes substantially beyond those city limits. Collins’s account of the materia medica of the early modern world is typical for these documents. Prescriptions from the 1580s show the use of European, African, and Asian materials. After 1600, the department imported an increasing range of American ingredients. This then is also a story of the early modern global drugs trade. There is now a substantial historiography on this topic, with particular focus on the Atlantic world. Works by Samir Boumedienne, Harold J. Cook, Teresa Huguet-Termes, Patrick Wallis, Timothy Walker, have all given vital insight into how\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n6\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 6\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nAmerican materials were appropriated from Indigenous communities, transported across the Atlantic, and incorporated into Western European medicine.6 Similarly, much attention has been devoted to the circulation of objects, texts, and ideas between East Asia and Western Europe.7 We know much about the initial stages of acquiring drugs, and of middlemen moving drugs around. American medical ingredients did not stop in Western Europe. Stephanie Gänger has shown that by the eighteenth century a number of those materials were being sold and used in multiple locations across Afro-Eurasia.8 This aspect of the Atlantic exchange is under-researched. American products were only worth the huge costs and great dangers of acquiring and transporting them if someone would buy them. Yet we do not always have the records to see the end use of these products, such a vital part of their history. The Russian case is a welcome exception. Among the long lists of materials bought, kept, and used by the Apothecary Chancery, we can find a notable number of American products. The Apothecary Chancery shows us the end use of drugs, completing the story of the early modern global drugs trade from acquisition to prescription. That completion of the story is possible by accepting the focus of the Russian records on materia medica. To do so, we need to think about materia medica as material culture. The material culture approach has been increasingly popular in the history of science and medicine. In their edited volume Ways of Making and Knowing: The Material Culture of Empirical Knowledge Pamela Smith, Amy Meyers, and Harold J. Cook have argued that materials were often vital to early modern scientific and medical practices, and so “the history of science is not a history of concepts, or at least not that alone, but a history of the making and using of objects to understand the world.”9 Although the precise materials of early modern Russian pharmacy were consumed or lost long ago, the documents that remain are documents about objects. Indeed, material culture studies has long included a strand of examining objects through texts about those objects. One example is Marianne De Laet and Annemarie Mol’s work on the Zimbabwe Bush Pump, in which they substantially rely upon an instruction manual on how to install this object, even as the object itself is available to them.10 Another is Craig Clunas’s Superfluous Things, which looks at both Ming-era luxury objects, and the texts, ideas, and words about those objects.11 This branch of material culture studies is particularly appropriate to the study\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 7\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nof lost objects like early modern materia medica, and has already been applied by scholars such as Carla Nappi in her work on early modern uses of ginseng.12 In such cases, we use texts to retrieve something of the objects they are about, thus taking a fundamentally different approach to studies using texts to explore the history of ideas or of historical figures. Through the voluminous records of the Apothecary Chancery on medical drugs we are able to write a material history of objects otherwise lost to us. Here I particularly follow Pratik Chakrabarti’s work on materia medica. In Materials and Medicine, Chakrabarti shows how European medicine was fundamentally shaped by eighteenth-century European encounters with non-Western knowledge of medicinal materials, in particular those encounters created as a result of British colonialism.13 My story is no less one of colonialism: The Apothecary Chancery exploited the conquered territories of Russian expansion as well as benefiting from materials they could buy because of Western European conquests in Asia and the Americas. Yet it is also a different story. Chakrabarti showed us the internal workings of materials within one empire; early modern Russian medicine made substantial use of the colonial products of other empires for their materia medica. This focus on materials that were moved through long-distance trade and colonial links raises issues of how to understand objects as they moved through different contexts. The material culture approach again provides models here. Anne Gerritsen and Giorgio Riello deliberately use a plural in the title of their The Global Lives of Things to highlight the “transformation of objects through processes of customisation, alteration, and re-combination.” Each single object had multiple lives, in the sense of multiple uses and meanings in the different contexts through which it was moved.14 The use and significance of, say, nutmeg, was different in the various Afro-Eurasian healing traditions that valued it. In following objects, then, we also follow knowledge. This aspect has been highlighted by Pamela Smith in her edited volume Entangled Itineraries, which focuses on “entangled itineraries of knowledge-making about specific materials and practices.”15 When we think of nutmeg, we need to think not only of the object, but also of the different ideas about that object at different times and places. In order to understand the general implications of the presence of diverse materia medica in early modern Russian records, we must keep in mind not only the origins of the mate-\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n8\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 8\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nrials, but the context in which they landed. We must remember that these were global objects in Muscovite hands.\n\nDoctoring Traditions and the Russian Empire The specificity of the Russian Imperial context is vital here. Writing of the global histories of science, Projit Bihari Mukharji has stated, “The majority of studies look at how non-Western knowledge is transformed into globalized intelligence useful to the ‘West.’ They do not seek to explore how ‘Western’ scientific intelligence might have conversely fitted into other, non-Western traditions of natural knowledge.”16 The Russian context allows us to both meet Mukharji’s implicit challenge to write histories examining how Western science and medicine was integrated into other knowledge systems, and to complicate it. After all, Russia has a tricky relationship to “the West.” Eighteenth-century St Petersburg is commonly presented as Western; seventeenth-century Moscow is not. Yet pre-1700 Russia was integrated with European diplomatic and trading networks, and the major religion was a branch of European Christianity. Moving Samuel Collins’s knowledge from Latin into Russian was not entirely a West–East exchange in the way it is usually meant. Yet it was still a blending, or as Mukharji would have it, a braiding, of Western European knowledge into a local non-Western European knowledge system. The issue of Western versus non-Western, and more broadly local versus foreign, knowledge systems is then also more knotty than the terminological shorthands we commonly use can express. As we have said, Muscovy was not Western Europe, but it was not as different from Western Europe as, say, the Aztec Empire. But in the case of medicine, there were always overlaps. Europeans appropriated the medicines of the Americas because, different as European and Indigenous American societies were, they nevertheless shared certain ideas, notably the utility of plants in medicine. All societies are different, but fundamentally they are also all human groups that grapple with illness and death. The case of Muscovy is significant because it shows how apparent closeness can conceal major fractures. As we will see, ideas that were accepted in Western Europe were taboo in Muscovy; their shared European Christianity did not build a straightforward bridge between their cultures. In that sense, we can then see Muscovy as non-Western, as it was divided from the\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 9\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nWest by fundamental chasms regarding bodies and what bodies should consume. What exactly were these Russian concepts? What does the Russian context tell us about how to examine Western knowledge blended into non-Western systems of knowledge? And what does it tell us about why those blendings happened? To do this, the first thing we should remember is that the early modern Russian Empire was a sprawling and diverse polity. By 1500, Moscow already dominated the Western Steppe; across the next two and a half centuries, it would swallow up much of the other successor states to the Mongol Empire, expanding south and east to conquer Siberia and eventually territories as far-flung as the Pacific Coast of North America. That empire contained within its massive scope a number of different doctoring traditions, to use another of Mukharji’s phrases.17 Eve Levin has written about Russian folk healers and their use of herbal medicine.18 Islamic medicine within the pre-1700 Russian Empire is a virtually unexplored topic, but the medical practices of the Muslim populations of the empire like the Tatars may have been similar to that contained in a text by Subh.ān Qulï Khan, one of the Khans of Bukhara in the Central Asian Khanate of Bukhara, a fellow Turkic-speaking Muslim.19 In the early eighteenth century a group of around 150 Tibetan monks travelled to Buryatiia – a region of the Russian Empire near the present-day border with Mongolia – led by the amchi Chökyi Ngawang Phüntsog, who became one of the main founders of Tibetan medicine in Buryatiia.20 Yet before 1700, these diverse traditions were overshadowed by one institution: the Apothecary Chancery, the Russian Imperial medical institution par excellence. The Apothecary Chancery set the rules of legal medical practice within the empire, and has left us the bulk of medical documents from this period, including on unofficial practices, so it is to the Apothecary Chancery that we turn. By the time Samuel Collins was writing about the global objects of medicine in 1664, he was writing in a very specific Russian Imperial institutional context, one which had been developing across the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Here, I am using the terms “Russian Empire” and “Russian Imperial” as terms of analysis. Russia itself only formally began to use the term “Imperiia” in the early eighteenth century under Peter the Great. What I call the Russian Empire – the polity centred on Moscow from the 1550s on – is not what Russians of that period called it. Yet “Empire” is not only an issue of contemporary terminology, it is an\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n10\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 10\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nanalytical category. Empires are polities that conquer new territories, link them bureaucratically to the metropole, and use those new territories for settlements or resources. Russia from the conquest of Kazan in 1552, which brought that khanate under their control, until the Treaty of Nerchinsk with the Qing in 1689, which delineated Russia’s territorial acquisitions in Asia, certainly fits this model. Indeed, seventeenth-century Russia arguably fits such a definition better than eighteenth-century Russia does, as the latter primarily consolidated and reorganized the territorial gains of the previous century and a half. More importantly, for a work in which colonial materials are key, we need to think in terms of empires. In sum, I use the term “Russian Empire” to describe sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Russia because I believe it is a better definition of the polity with which we are dealing with than simply calling it “Russia.” Within this pre-Petrine Russian Empire, Collins worked for the Apothecary Chancery in which foreign medical practitioners played a major part. Men like Collins were not the only medical practitioners in Muscovy. Like many places in the early modern global world, the East Slavic lands, and indeed the territories that the Russian Empire was colonizing in the early modern period, had multiple practitioners following their own doctoring traditions, between whom and the imported experts of men like Collins there was a fragile peace. The British Indian context has proven especially fruitful for understanding how traditions have coexisted, with Kapil Raj describing knowledge texts produced in that context as “co-constructed” between multiple actors across two continents, and Mukharji’s phrase “braided sciences” as a way to understand how different traditions wound around each other. As Mukharji explains, thinking of this as “braiding” helps us understand how traditions consist of different strands that can wind tightly together or unwind from each other, as well as winding or unwinding to one or more strands of other traditions.21 Mukharji’s concept in particular helps us understand the complex coexistences of the doctoring traditions of Muscovy, and how they interacted with doctoring traditions from outside the empire, and with other Imperial Russian practices like diplomacy, religion, and colonization. The earliest we can clearly identify a bureaucratic institution of official medicine in Russia is the 1570s. The creation of that medical department reified existing divisions between the multiple groups who already coexisted and competed in early modern Russia. Eastern Orthodox Christianity had been the major religion in the East Slavic lands since the\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 11\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nChristianization of Kievan Rus’ in the 980s; Muscovy continued this tradition, and the role of Russian Orthodox Christian churchmen as providers of medical treatments. Alongside the churchmen, there were a range of local heterodox healers, whose activities are primarily known from accusations against them, and who were commonly portrayed as practising a combination of herbal medicine, heterodox prayers, magic, and divination. And then there were the predecessors to Samuel Collins, foreign physicians, surgeons and apothecaries, primarily from Western Europe, whose personal positions at court would eventually be transformed into a part of bureaucratic medicine. Religious healing by officially recognized Russian Orthodox Christian churchmen was a major part of healing in Muscovy, even as it was not directly a part of the Apothecary Chancery. Rather, these two branches of licit healing coexisted fairly peacefully, with the department sending supplies, and occasionally even patients to the churchmen.22 Often the church took in the soul-sick [dushevnaia bolezn’], something akin to what we would now call mental illness, although people with certain physical illnesses, in particular the falling sickness [paduchaia bolezn’], a term often conflated with epilepsy, sometimes also turned to religious healing. This religious healing involved particular spaces, like saints’ shrines at which the sick prayed for recovery, particular objects like relics, and noted individuals. Both Avakuum Petrov and Archbishop Afanasii of Kholmogory, major figures on opposite sides of the religious Schism of the 1660s, were famous for their medical practices.23 Significantly, their healing also differed: Afanasii of Kholmogory wrote a pharmacy text on the creation and usage of medical drugs; Petrov believed true healing came only from confessing sins and reconnecting to God. Russian Orthodox Christian healing traditions were multiple and were braided loosely to each other, and to court medicine. Magic was never far from medicine in the pre-modern East Slavic lands. The modern Russian term for doctor – vrach – is derived from the verb vrachevati, which in the sixteenth century could mean either to heal or to ensorcell; the term balii could mean either a magical or a medical practitioner; and the word volkhv, although most commonly used to mean wizards or non-Christian religious figures, was on occasion also used to refer to medical doctors.24 Magic at court was a substantial concern to the Muscovites.25 Herbal healing was also worrisome, for similar reasons. Courtly magic everywhere was about political\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n12\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 12\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nand dynastic intrigue; court medicine also held possibilities for such shenanigans. Local healers were often in a relationship with elite personages, and so this raised the possibility that they might be convinced or coerced into harming the tsar.26 Not all such local healers had a bad reputation: one sixteenth-century tale, Petr and Fevroniia, presents the fictional folk-healer Fevroniia as better than trained medical practitioners, as she succeeds in healing Prince Petr’s illness where they had failed.27 In the overwhelming majority of cases, information about these unofficial healers comes from documents written by their detractors, and so our understanding of their practices, motivations, and actions will always be coloured by that. We can at least say that there was a group of local practitioners who offered a range of services to understand and manipulate nature, and healing human bodies was commonly within their range of services. Herbal medical drugs were a part of their practice. The Domostroi, a household advice text that may have been partly taken from a Western European work and which circulated Muscovy in multiple manuscripts from the mid-sixteenth century on, condemns healers as sorcerers and forbids the reader from consulting such practitioners, or indeed having any dealings whatsoever with them.28 Similarly, the mid-sixteenth-century Russian Orthodox Church text the Stoglav condemns zelinichestvo, an abstract noun derived from the Slavonic word for herb and meaning treatment with herbs, or perhaps more generally knowledge of herbs.29 It is not entirely clear what the Stoglav is condemning: herbs were used for a range of purposes, and in the sixteenth century were associated with both poisoning and witchcraft.30 Again, the views contained in the Stoglav come from the persecutors of those practitioners, not the practitioners themselves. But it is interesting that they were in part condemned for prescribing consumable medical drugs. Heterodox practices appear to us braided together with official views on such practices, because that is how we access that world. By the time the Stoglav was compiled in 1550, the courtly elite of Russia had an alternative both to the licit practice of churchmen and to the illicit practices of the heterodox practitioners: invited foreign medical practitioners. In 1472, the Byzantine Princess Sofia Palaeologa travelled to Moscow to marry Grand Prince Ivan III; a physician was a part of her retinue. Late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century court documents and chronicles make scattered references to a handful of such medical practi-\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 13\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ntioners. In 1490, Ivan III asked the Holy Roman Emperor for a physician; in the same year, Vienna sent him one Leon Zhidovin. In the 1510s, doctor Teofil worked for the court, recruited from Prussia, as did Marko Grek a subject of the Ottoman Sultan (not to be confused with the churchman Maxim Grek, also active in Russia in the same period).31 By the early sixteenth century the Moscow court employed perhaps one or two such foreign medical practitioners at a time, whose medical practices were bound tightly together with diplomatic and dynastic practices. There were specific reasons to recruit foreign medical practitioners. Eve Levin has argued that foreign servitors, dependent upon the tsar for their position, were seen as less susceptible to bribes to harm the tsar than local practitioners, already indebted to other lords, may have been.32 As will so often be the case with our story, here we see only hints of this medical world, but the hints are fairly consistent: heterodox healers available to the elite and commoners alike; religious healers focused on Christian-centred diseases and cures; and a court moving towards foreign servitors for security reasons. Doctoring traditions in Muscovy were always braided together with social and political concerns. These practitioners were commonly recruited through the westwardfacing diplomacy of the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, as Muscovy turned away from the fading remnants of the Golden Horde in the east and instead looked west to Europe. Indeed, this trend of recruiting medical practitioners from Western Europe continued into the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, despite Moscow’s having diplomatic links to other Eurasian courts and being aware of other doctoring traditions. Islamic medicine, for example, was never practised at the Moscow court. One reason for this was antagonism towards Islam. The level of animosity of the Russian elite towards Muslims waxed and waned, but we do see evidence of suspicion of Muslims in this period. In 1617 the Shah of Iran sent Christian holy relics to Moscow in an attempt to head off a brewing conflict; these relics were initially regarded with suspicion.33 An Apothecary Chancery document uses language common to anti-Islamic diatribes to discuss coffee, a beverage associated with Muslim lands.34 Such suspicion of Islam meant Muslim medical practitioners would not have fulfilled the security requirements Levin has highlighted. Moreover, there were other places from which to source medical practitioners, particularly regions with which the Russian court had more harmonious relations than with the Muslim lands. Maria Unkovskaya and\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n14\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 14\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nSabine Dumschat have demonstrated that the practitioners of the Apothecary Chancery overwhelmingly came from specific Western European regions, notably the Protestant countries England, the Netherlands, and certain of the German Lands; before the middle of the seventeenth century, the Apothecary Chancery employed no Russian as a medical practitioner.35 No extant document explicitly explains this trend. However, we can situate the medical situation within other contexts. Even with the existence of contacts elsewhere, the Moscow court was increasingly interested in this period in the cultural practices, material goods, and practical expertise of Western Europe. We can see this in the general scheme of foreign experts in early modern Russia, who were overwhelmingly from Western Europe.36 The preferences of Muscovite diplomacy and elite society shaped the personnel of official medicine. For the early part of the sixteenth century, what we have is names of practitioners; it is only in the 1570s, during the reign of Tsar Ivan IV (also known as The Terrible), that we see mentions of a bureaucratic institution. In 1572, a century after Sophia Palaeologa’s arrival with her personal physician, an inventory of the royal household noted the presence of several texts belonging to the Apothecary Building, Aptechnaia izba.37 That first mention of the Apothecary Building, as a marginal note in a document substantially concerned with other matters, is typical for the documentary traces of that institution. The only documents that can be definitively traced as being the product of that department are eight prescriptions from the early 1580s.38 Otherwise, the department appears only on the edges of other affairs, making the evaluation of its activities and purposes particularly tricky. One point is noteworthy. The earlier practitioners – Bülow, Teofil, and others – were not associated with a department; rather, they seem to have been individual members of court. The Apothecary Building was a department within the bureaucracy, unwinding imported foreign doctoring from its earlier association with individuals and braiding it more tightly with the bureaucracy. Significantly, the Apothecary Building also seems to have been a department based in a separate physical structure. This may well relate to its name: of all the possible contemporary medical-related terms that could have been used here – lechebnyi, vrachebnyi, lekarskii, tselitel’nii – the department makes reference to apothecary work in particular. Medical affairs may have been formalized into a housed department to ease\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 15\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nTable 1 Origins of Foreign Medical Practitioners in the Apothecary Chancery, 1600–1696\n\nPeriod\n\nOrigin unknown\n\nGerman Lands\n\nRuthenia, Poland, Lithuania\n\nEngland and Scotland\n\nThe Low Countries\n\nOther European*\n\nTotal\n\n1600–1620 1620–1640 1640–1660 1660–1680 1680–1696\n\n6 15 13 13 31\n\n4 2 8 25 37\n\n1 0 17 21 11\n\n2 7 5 6 3\n\n3 6 4 5 5\n\n1 5 4 13 14\n\n17 35 51 83 101\n\nAdapted from Dumschat, Ausländischer Mediziner, 105. * Denmark, Greece, Sweden, Italy, France\n\nthe creation of medical drugs. The arrival of British apothecary James Frencham in 1581 is often taken as a key stage in the formalization of official Russian medicine, and his arrival could mark the importation of equipment to stock the Apothecary Building.39 Most importantly, once again we return to the central idea of this book: for early modern Russia, medicine meant medical drugs. References to an official medical department die away in the 1590s, to reappear in the 1610s and 1620s as Russia emerged from the dynastic crisis of the Time of Troubles with the new Romanov dynasty in place.40 From the 1620s, the Moscow court’s medical department is known as the Aptekarskii prikaz, the Apothecary Chancery. Its exact relationship to the earlier Apothecary Building is unclear, in part because we know so little about the earlier institution.41 We do know that there were similarities between the two institutions. Both were run by a Russian noble, usually a close relative of the Tsaritsa, had a building in or near the Kremlin complex, were staffed by Moscow clerks and foreign medical practitioners, and exchanged documents with the other parts of early modern Russia’s imperial bureaucracy.42 There may have been a difference in patient circle: we know both institutions treated court figures, but the Apothecary Chancery also treated the army from at least the 1630s. The Apothecary Chancery would remain in business until the early eighteenth century and was the major official institution of early modern Russian medicine, also providing us with the overwhelming majority of extant materials on early modern Russian medicine.43\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n16\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 16\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nThe Apothecary Chancery was initially based within the Moscow Kremlin, and later moved to a building just outside the Kremlin complex. By the middle of the seventeenth century, the department had more than one apothecary garden in Moscow.44 It also had several outposts, such as a storehouse in Rzhev, and regional centres in Novgorod in the north and Kiev in the south, and made unsuccessful attempts to set up further regional branches in Vologda in the north, and Kazan in the east.45 The Apothecary Chancery was a part of the prikaznaia sistema, commonly referred to as the chancery system, an Imperial Russian bureaucracy that consisted of multiple linked departments. Departments were created and closed down across the century, with around seventy in operation at any one time, covering military affairs of various kinds, dealing with foreign connections, tracking service lands, collecting taxes, and administering newly conquered territories. The Apothecary Chancery was integrated into this system through exchange of documents: it asked regional officials to collect plants for medicines, received requests from military departments to examine wounded soldiers, and was ordered to provide expert testimony in trials.46 Across the seventeenth century, the imported doctoring traditions from Western Europe were more and more closely braided with imperial practices. By the 1620s, the Apothecary Chancery was established and functioning; in the second half of the seventeenth century it was substantially rearranged. In 1654, the Apothecary Chancery changed its previous strategy of recruiting medical practitioners from Western Europe to training Russians as both apothecaries and field surgeons.47 Both relate to the issue of military medicine. The Apothecary Chancery had been providing surgeons and medicines to the Russian army from at least the 1630s, so the expanded staff allowed the department not only to send out surgeons to more regiments, but also to create the increasingly large quantities of medicines required by an institution that supplied the large (and growing) court and the army. The mid-century date of these changes makes sense. Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich was more of a reformer than his father Mikhail Fedorovich.48 The year 1654 saw the start of the Russo-Polish war, as well as an outbreak of plague in many parts of central Russia, both of which issues would be better resolved with a more robust medical department. In 1673, the Apothecary Chancery was again reformed, this time being split into two branches. The newly created New Pharmacy [Novaia apte-\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 17\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nka] dealt with ordinary Muscovites, providing them with officially approved medicine. The rest of the Apothecary Chancery, now called the Old Pharmacy [Staraia apteka] or Upper Pharmacy [Verkhniaia apteka], dealt with the needs of the court, treating high-ranking patients and providing advice, and also the needs of the army, sending them medicines and medics. Such an occurrence was entirely normal for chancery development: the larger a chancery became and the more numerous its duties, the more complex its internal structure.49 The Apothecary Chancery continued to operate in this new, bicameral iteration until the end of the seventeenth century. By the late seventeenth century, the doctoring traditions of the Apothecary Chancery were itself beginning to unravel into separate strands. As the Apothecary Chancery became more involved in prescribing to ordinary Muscovites like soldiers, it was also drawn into investigating and prosecuting medical malpractice in the city. The high tide of such concerns came in 1701. In this year, Tsar Peter I, better known as Peter the Great, enacted legislation that would both shut down market stalls selling medical drugs, and establish Moscow-based licensed apothecaries.50 These men were the first private individuals to be granted official permission to practise medicine (although Apothecary Chancery medical practitioners had some rights to maintain a private practice); once again, priority was given to the making of drugs over all other kinds of medical practice. Although the Apothecary Chancery was so central to the pharmacy reform of 1701, the department did not long survive that period as it was slowly pulled apart across the first two decades of the eighteenth century. This heralded not only the end of the Apothecary Chancery itself but also of the monopolistic approach to official medicine it had represented. Although the Medical Chancellery [Meditsinskaia kantseliariia], the short-lived successor to the Apothecary Chancery, still provided some services for the military in the early eighteenth century, increasingly the armed forces preferred to have their own medical services. The Military Statute of 1716 increased the scope of the army’s already-existing medical wing; the 1720 Naval Statute did the same for the navy.51 This was not a destruction of the Apothecary Chancery, as its concerns, possessions, and staff would shape eighteenth-century Russian science and medicine. Rather, this was a shattering of the department, and a dispersal of its valuable parts to new institutional homes.\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n18\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 18\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nThe end of the Apothecary Chancery was formalized in 1721 when a Senate decree put all its remaining employees, buildings, and materials under the control of the newly created Medical Chancellery.52 That department itself was not long for the world, as it would be replaced by the Medical College in 1763; its documentary trace leaves an even lighter footprint, as its records are preserved only from 1737 on.53 Its replacement, the Medical College, was a rather different animal, the product of the reforms of that other famous eighteenth-century Russian ruler, Catherine II (popularly known as Catherine the Great). There was also a geographical shift: the hub of seventeenth-century official Russian medicine was always the Moscow Kremlin complex; after the establishment of St Petersburg in 1703 the Medical Chancellery worked in both places, with institutions in both the old and the new capital. These changes concealed deeper continuities: many of the Medical Chancellery’s staff had worked, or were the children of men who had worked, in the Apothecary Chancery. By the eighteenth century, the imported Western European doctoring tradition had both unwound from its early association with diplomacy and internally unwound, to become multiple threads all increasingly tightly wound together with the business of the Russian empire.\n\nThe Question of Globalization As early modern Russian medicine relied heavily on long-distance trading links to supply the ingredients for medical drugs, including on the newly created transatlantic routes, we need to think about globalization. The idea of a pre-modern global world, of early modern globalization, and when and why those concepts might be useful, is fraught. Some scholars have argued that medieval Afro-Eurasia or the early modern Atlantic world can fruitfully be analyzed as being global, but others feel “global” can productively and meaningfully be applied only to more recent historical periods. There are some early modernists who feel that early modern globalization is a vital concept to the field, and others who think it should be dismissed. Those who do agree that early modern globalization is a useful concept do not always agree on what it was, and when it happened. Considering American products in early modern Moscow inevitably requires making an intervention into such scholarly debates. An important point in my conception of Muscovy’s global moment is specificity. Global connections – meaning long-distance links – and glob-\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 19\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nalization – meaning how and when those links evolved – are capacious concepts. To discuss the global, we could talk about commodities, trade, value, and prices, or we could discuss communications and knowledge exchange, or travel and migration. Looking at commodities in the early modern period, then, involves considering one kind of global, not constructing an overall concept of what “global” is. Even more specifically, here we are dealing with medical commodities, rather than bulk items or luxury goods, and focusing on indirect trade, as those commodities were commonly coming from regions with which the Russian Empire did not have a direct connection. We then get a model of how to think about such situations, which were not uncommon in the early modern world, and also how to build other specific models of limited, regional experiences of the global. This then leads to the question, what can considering Muscovy’s materia medica tell us about the controversial issue of early modern globalization? The idea that the pre-modern world could be thought of as global dates back to world systems theory and works like Janet Abu-Lughod’s Before European Hegemony: The World System AD 1250–1350.54 More recently, a number of scholars have argued for a specific value to thinking of the pre-modern world as global, such as Monica Green, who has contended that pre-modern pandemics like the Black Death are better understood as global phenomena.55 Particularly useful for our purposes here is Geraldine Heng’s work. Heng argues that we should see the interconnectivities of the world as “globalities,” a set of long-distance connections specific to a period. She further argues for an “asynchrony of global temporalities,” meaning that different long-distance connections formed or dissolved at different times.56 Both ideas provide a roadmap for thinking of Moscow as one node in a global world, and how Moscow’s experience of that world was specific to Moscow, even as it reveals broader trends. Other historians criticize the idea of a pre-modern global, and even the idea of global history at all. In 2017, Jeremy Adelman proclaimed global history to be dead. Adelman claimed global history to be a product of a now-past era of international co-operation and too focused on the idea of integration and interdependence, to the neglect of equally important narratives of separation and disintegration.57 Adelman’s article, rather than prompting despair in the global history community, instead provoked defences. Richard Drayton and David Motadel have argued that\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n20\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 20\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nalthough the specific context from which global history has emerged might be dead, global history cannot be. They point to other historiographical moments, noting how scholars who do not directly practise, for example, history from below, nevertheless have to take account of the peoples and processes such approaches highlighted.58 The bell cannot be unrung. Having seen the ways in which history has been shaped by global processes, we must continue to take account of those processes, even as we acknowledge the problems in doing so. There are other responses one can make to Adelman’s concerns. It is important to note that global histories do not have to be histories only of integration and interdependence; the recent edited volume by Erica Charters, Marie Houllemare, and Peter H. Wilson on early modern violence in global context is one example of a different kind of global history.59 Alternatively, we can take the example of sassafras. Sassafras, a tree that grows along the eastern seaboard of North America, was initially part of the medical practices of several Native American nations, including the Timucua of present-day Florida. Across the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, European invaders appropriated the Timucuan knowledge of sassafras, acquired sassafras examples, and sold them across Afro-Eurasia. At the same time, Europeans murdered the Timucua through a combination of active combat and violent disregard for the impact of virgin soil epidemics.60 Processes that were constructive, in the sense of making new connections, practices, or things, were also often destructive. The early modern period was the violent remaking of the world. Global history is a fraught concept; early modern globalization may be even more so. A number of scholars have looked at the major changes to long-distance trade and travel during the long sixteenth century as evidence of early modern globalization. The most specific claim is that of Dennis Flynn and Arturo Giraldez, who take the founding of Manila in 1571, which facilitated the ability to trade circuitously around the globe, as the start of globalization.61 More generally, the term is used by scholars to refer to the period from the late fifteenth to the early eighteenth centuries as one in which major changes were made to long-distance connections, and during which objects and knowledge circulated the world in different ways than they had before.62 Given the prominence of new American drugs in Eurasia to studies of the early modern drugs trade, early modern globalization has been a fundamental concept for such studies.63 The concept of globalization is unavoidable when considering the drugs trade.\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 21\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nThis does not mean it is universally accepted. Even historians who find the concept of pre-modern global useful have criticized the idea of applying the term “globalization” to early periods. Heng rejects its application to the pre-modern world, concerned that doing so erases the specificities of our current global moment.64 Jan de Vries has criticized the idea of an early modern globalization by citing economic history concerns over the extent and measurability of change.65 Looking at African history, Frederick Cooper expresses concerns similar to Adelman’s that thinking globally glosses over breakdowns in favour of writing of successes and connections, as well as ignoring local stories.66 De Vries argues that the concept of globalization is too big for the early modern period; Cooper argues that it is too big for any period. So then why do I insist upon framing this study not only as global history, but a history of globalization? The criticisms of both can be essentialized to this: there has been a mismatch between the ideas of global and globalization and the material being studied, leading to those approaches concealing or misrepresenting more than they reveal. It is my contention that the concepts of the global and globalization are appropriate to use in the context of early modern Russian materia medica because they reveal important aspects we would otherwise struggle to explain. In contrast to Cooper’s concerns as an Africanist that the concept of globalization hurts or hides his subject, as a Russianist I find that the same concept – used cautiously – has huge potential to reveal vital aspects of Russian history that we cannot otherwise consider. I then use the terms “global” and “globalization” in specific ways for specific reasons. When I say “global,” I am talking about a network of long-distance trade and exchange, or the objects that could only be obtained through said network. In the sixteenth century, Muscovy’s materia medica were already global. By this I mean they were being obtained through a Hengian kind of specific Muscovite globality of a particular combination of long-distance connections across Afro-Eurasia that was similar to the connections of other major cities but also fundamentally unique to Moscow.67 It is possible to understand the particular combinations of ingredients that went into a single drug that we will see in the 1580s only by thinking about those objects as global. When I say “globalization,” I am talking about a limited globalization, the shift in Moscow’s global links that fundamentally changed Russian materia medica. In the seventeenth century, the specific Muscovite glob-\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n22\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 22\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nality of the previous century shifted substantially with the entrance of American drugs as a major new focus, linking Moscow to the Atlantic world. Muscovy’s entrance into the Atlantic world was temporally disjointed from that of, say, Spain. This was a key point of Moscow’s “asynchrony of global temporalities,” as Moscow and the Russian Empire more generally joined this post-contact world after Spain and the Native American nations of the eastern seaboard.68 We could talk of this in Hengian terms of a shifting globality from the sixteenth to the seventeenth century.69 But I chose to use the more popular and widespread term of globalization, simply because it is more familiar. Muscovy’s materia medica was dependent on global links, which went through a major global shift during the seventeenth century that had long-term consequences. We can reasonably call this globalization and use that phrase to highlight an important fact about this history. Embracing the complications of calling this a story of globalization also allows us to bring in literature on both global science and the global drugs trade that enrich how we understand the Russian situation. As Fati Fan noted in 2012, there has been a global turn in the history of science, in part occasioned by the need to deal with the long-term global movement of objects that has shaped scientific ideas and practices.70 Early modernists have played a significant role in this historiographical moment, from Kapil Raj’s now-classic Relocating Modern Science to more recent edited volumes by Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra and Helge Wendt.71 As Cañizares-Esguerra has put it, “Scholars are just now beginning to realize that the European Renaissance and Enlightenment were not European inventions but vast encyclopaedias of hybrid global knowledge processed and packaged in Europe.”72 Focusing on Moscow, a site connected to Western Europe but never entirely part of Latinate Western European natural historical knowledge circles, permits us a new perspective on this knowledge. Thinking about globalization also helps us think about the early modern drugs trade as global, and conceptualizations that see the link between the drugs trade and early modern global processes as fundamental. Brett Neilson and Mohammed Bamyeh have argued that drugs are a material manifestation of global processes, and that we have to think about global mobilities if we think about drugs.73 Building on this, Benjamin Breen has asked, “[a]re drugs, then, not modern, but distinctively early modern, in the sense that both the term itself and its societal\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 23\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nrole emerged in tandem with the rise of colonial exploitation, state formation, and global trade in the three centuries after Columbus?”74 For Breen, drugs, global trade, and early modernity are inextricably linked. We have many works on the specifics of the movement of drugs through this early modern global world which Breen sees as so essentially entangled. Looking to Moscow we can see the effects of this global world when it came to rest.\n\nMuscovite Global Science Thus far we have spoken of this materia medica project as if its Russianness were merely a happenstance, as if this were a case study almost accidentally focused on Russia, but which primarily tells us things external to Russia. And this book can be read in such a way. A reader uninterested in Russian history per se and concerned only with the problem of early modern globalization, of material culture and the history of science and medicine, or the early modern drugs trade, could work their way through this work thinking only of those issues. But this book is also about early modern Russia. For those of us who are interested in Russia qua Russia, looking at medical drugs gives us a vital and underconsidered view on our region. We are here in part concerned with knowledge, knowledge about what drugs were and how to use them. Knowledge is bounded and shaped by many things, such as the other identities of the knowledge creators, their place in society, and the support of or opposition to certain kinds of knowledge. A clichéd and apparently immortal issue for science is its relationship to religion, which has rarely been as antithetical as some would argue but has always been significant. Society has shaped knowledge, but knowledge has also shaped society; the two are ever locked into a complex symbiosis. As Russianists, the question for us then is what does this case study tell us about the specificities of knowledge in Muscovy? And how did those specificities interact with Muscovite society and culture more broadly? A major issue here is continuities and discontinuities. This project covers the period 1534 to 1750, crossing two significant boundaries of historiography. This book begins by traversing the border between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a crossing made many times by social, political, and cultural histories, but less common in histories of\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n24\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 24\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nRussian science and medicine. One strand of scholarship concerns medieval Russian science, with Rem Aleksandrovich Morozov in particular working on multiple pre-modern, and typically pre-1600, Slavonic medical and astrological manuscripts; significant work has also been done comparing the 1534 and 1616 Slavonic Garden of Health manuscripts.75 In contrast, studies of official medicine typically take the 1620s, the beginning of good Apothecary Chancery record preservation, as the starting point.76 Yet these groups of sources have a major similarity: the pre-1620s herbals are as concerned with medical drugs as was the Apothecary Chancery. Studying materia medica, then, both allows and requires us to skip across the narrow yet significant temporal boundary from the 1616 Garden of Health to the 1620s Apothecary Chancery files. At the other chronological end of this project, we also cross into the eighteenth century. The reign of Peter the Great was long considered the defining line between Muscovy and “Imperial Russia” for cultural, political, and social histories; the establishment of the Academy of Sciences in 1725 typically played the same role for histories of Russian science. That Rubicon of the early eighteenth century has been crossed several times now, but rarely by historians of science and medicine. Those of us writing on the Apothecary Chancery typically end our studies as the department’s records peter out in the 1690s–1710s.77 There are then works such as Loren Graham’s classic study of Russian science that begins after 1700, and that of Andreas Renner, which looks at Russian medicine of the mid- to late eighteenth century.78 Those of us who focus on the seventeenth century rarely venture into the eighteenth, and vice versa. Yet here, again, the material demands that this boundary be traversed. The Garden of Health, the Apothecary Chancery files, and Medical Chancellery, all shared a mutual affinity with materia medica. Following materia medica builds us a long and complex road two hundred years long. The issue of Muscovy’s interest in materia medica also takes us to the issue of early modern Russia’s international links. We have long left behind the idea that Muscovy was cut off from the rest of the early modern world, with a number of scholars highlighting Russia’s connections to Western Europe, Asia, and Middle Eastern polities like the Ottoman Empire.79 This book builds on that work, as it considers how materia medica flowed through those same connections. It also reveals a rather different geography. At least by the 1580s, Russia was using materials from Africa, a region that appears rarely in histories of early modern Rus-\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 25\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nsia.80 Russia’s links with the Americas similarly are all but absent in this period, being written almost exclusively through the history of the shortlived Russian colonies in Pacific North America, which are typically framed as beginning with a voyage across the Bering Sea in 1732.81 Yet the presence of American materia medica in Russia predates that voyage by more than a century, as well as shifting the focus from the Pacific to the Atlantic world. To write about materia medica in Muscovy is to redraw the map of early modern Russia’s international interactions. Focusing on the Apothecary Chancery’s expertise on materia medica also requires us to think about what how we define science and expertise. The work of the Western European physicians easily fits into standard definitions; the activities of the herb collectors also fits within currently accepted ideas of artisan expertise.82 Yet both groups were a part of a broader world of Slavic views on nature. As I and others discussed in a special edition of ВИВЛIОθИКА devoted to this theme in 2018, over the past decade and a half there has been a “natural turn” in early modern Russian studies.83 That turn focuses on how Muscovites viewed the powers and possibilities of the natural world, and includes work by Valerie Kivelson on cartography, by Kivelson, Eve Levin, E.B. Smilianskaia, and A.S. Lavrov on witchcraft, and by A.B. Ippolitova on ethno-botanical works.84 Once the remit of the Apothecary Chancery began expanding in the late seventeenth century, the department would directly interact with such views as it provided expert testimony in witchcraft trials. The Apothecary Chancery was a hybrid institution, sitting at the nexus of medieval Slavonic science, popular Muscovite views on nature, Russian bureaucratic principles, Western European expertise, and global materia medica, to create a Muscovite global science. *** The centre of Muscovy’s medical world was always medical drugs. This concern emerged from an earlier conflation of potion, poison, and drug into the phrase zel’ia, and entered the Apothecary Chancery language via that department’s reliance upon earlier Muscovite oaths of service and fealty. Those concerns were significant. Not only did the department have their servitors pledge to create only good drugs, it also punished them for infractions. That drive to root out bad medical drugs led to a mission creep, first of the department being involved in investigating\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n26\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 26\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nindividual cases of medical malpractice and healing-related witchcraft, then by the late seventeenth-century broader police actions against Moscow-based unofficial medical drug peddlers as a group. Chapter 1 establishes how the centrality of medical drugs to Russian understandings of medicine shaped both official and unofficial practices. Chapter 2 looks at which natural objects were considered appropriate to put in good medicines. The overwhelming majority of medical drug ingredients in Russia from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century were plants. Moreover, that focus on botanicals led early modern official Russian medicine to use global substances. In the sixteenth century, the court was already reading about and using ingredients from North Africa, East Asia, and Southeast Asia, as well as local herbs and Western European products. At the start of the seventeenth century they also began importing American botanicals, the only American products to be in serious use in Russia before the eighteenth century. This enthusiasm for global botanical medicines from both Afro-Eurasia and the Americas continued into the eighteenth century. While botanical medical ingredients were accepted, chemical medicine was less so. Chapter 3 looks at the turbulent history of chemical medicine in early modern Russia and what it tells us about the decisionmaking processes of the Apothecary Chancery. Medical practitioners from Western Europe were early promoters of this group of ingredients, but there was notable resistance from Russian officials, even as late as the 1690s. Eventually chemicals would find a place within official Russian medicine, but it took a century and substantial lobbying from the medical practitioners. This shows a co-construction of rules between Western European experts and local officials. The materials of medicine also clashed with religious proscriptions. Chapter 4 examines the category of flesh-based medicines, focusing particularly on mumia, powdered mummified human flesh, and theriac, a compound medicine including vipers’ flesh. Russian and Western European documents both specifically note how these medicaments were unacceptable to the Russian court in the early seventeenth century, a ban fundamentally based on Muscovite Orthodox Christian ideas of the body and rules on consumption. Under Peter the Great, Russian culture changed, and with it the status of these two medicines as well, eventually leading to acceptance of these medicines. Within the Muscovite cosmology of Russian Orthodox Christianity, the materiality and status of the\n\nGriffin-007-intro\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:01 AM\n\nPage 27\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\nhuman body was key, and so materials of medicine always had to interact with rules about human bodies that came from society, not just science. All of these materials we encounter via their documentary traces, a topic addressed in chapter 5, which looks at those textual objects directly. The Apothecary Chancery owned and created numerous texts; indeed, one of its key functions was to create reports using authoritative texts to address specific questions of concern to the court and the bureaucracy of empire, which then fed into trials, legislation, and licensing. In the eighteenth century, some practices of texts and authority changed. There were new institutions, and Russia found a use for massproduced printed texts. Yet the Apothecary Chancery’s successor, the Medical Chancellery, still used the same practices of investigation to produce reports in legal cases which went on to inform new legislation, following the pattern established earlier in the Apothecary Chancery’s work. Half-hidden under all these changes, the textual practices of the Apothecary Chancery remained. *** The end of this book is a pharmacy regulation that aimed to control all drug creation, prescription, and consumption across an empire that covered one-eighth of the world’s land surface. But to get to such an ambitious gambit, we need to begin with something much less far-reaching: the service oath of one department in the Moscow Kremlin in the 1620s.\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n28\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 28\n\nMixing Medicines\n\n1 The Importance of Lekarstva\n\nAll around the early modern world people tried to maintain health and treat sickness. We can find much in common in these attempts, but we can also find differences both between and within regions, differences scholars have categorized with a range of terms. Projit Bihari Mukharji has, as we have already seen, created the term “doctoring traditions” to discuss the interaction of approaches he sees in the modern South Asian context.1 In contrast, John Slater, Maríaluz López-Terrada, and José Pardo-Tomás use the phrase “medical cultures” to express something similar about the early modern Spanish Empire. “[M]edicine,” they write, “constitutes, on the one hand, a varied form of cultural practice and production, and on the other, a significant matrix for the intersection of a wide range of cultural phenomena (political, literary, religious, or otherwise).”2 Mukharji, Slater, López-Terrada, and Pardo-Tomás are all concerned with understanding medicine as having different traditions that interact, change, and are changed by both other medical traditions and non-medical ideas and practices. Fundamental to this is the idea that each tradition has something particular about it, a mutable yet coherent core of ideas and practices that constitute the tradition itself. To understand medicine or doctoring in a particular time and place, we need to understand what that core was. When we examine the official Russian medicine of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and early eighteenth centuries, one central concern jumps out: medical drugs, in Russian lekarstva [pl.; lekarstvo sing.]. The first complete medical book translated into Slavonic was an herbal. The only extant records from the sixteenth-century official medical department, the Aptechnaia izba, are prescriptions. Across the seventeenth and into\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 29\n\nThe Importance of Lekarstva\n\n29\n\nthe eighteenth century the staff of the Apothecary Chancery and the Medical Chancellery swore oaths to create medical drugs well, produced medical drugs, wrote books about medical drugs both for the departments and for their own purposes, and were deeply involved in investigating and legislating against the incorrect creation of medical drugs above all other kinds of medical malpractice. The core of early modern official Russian medicine was drugs. As the major set of documents for studying early modern Russian medicine comes from the Apothecary Chancery, we can see this core concern both in that department’s records and in its intersections with other medical practices within the Russian Empire and other aspects of life in that context. That fixation on medical drugs emerged out of an older fear of malefic magic and poisoning, and a conflation of spell, poison, and medicine in the word zel’ia.3 Anxiety regarding malefic magic and poisoning certainly traces as far back as the fourteenth century and shows up in both official documents like oaths and in the testimony of unofficial healers that we find caught up in witchcraft and malpractice trials. That concern continues even as the Russian language evolved over this period, with the emergence of the modern word for medical drugs, lekarstvo. The concept that natural objects had a specific power to help and harm human bodies was both long-lived and widespread in early modern Russia. The focus on materia medica substantially shaped both the practices of official Russian medicine and the interactions of officialdom with unofficial healing. At the start of the seventeenth century, the Apothecary Chancery took pains to regulate the production of medicines above all other medical practices in the department, with pre-emptive rules, investigations, and punishments for infractions. By the latter part of the century, the department was increasingly involved in both witchcraft trials and investigations into medical malpractice by unofficial practitioners, specifically when medical drugs were involved. Those malpractice investigations themselves spiralled, moving from case-by-case affairs to a broader investigation into the market for unofficial medicines itself. The Muscovite concern over consumable medicines fundamentally shaped early modern Russian medicine, determining both official practices and the prosecution of unofficial activities. The central concern of early modern Russian medicine was medical drugs, and so we can begin our examination of that medical culture with the texts that most directly demonstrate that specific issue.\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n30\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 30\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nFirst, Do No Harm One prominent place in which we can see the concern over medical drugs is in the Apothecary Chancery’s service oaths. When medical practitioners joined the Apothecary Chancery, they agreed to a standard of practice and behaviour as set out in a long oath. In a version from the 1620s we find the following passage: I pledge … not to spoil [patients’ health] with any kind of affair nor with any kind of cunning and not to give an evil herb or root … not to put unclean mumia nor any evil snake poison nor other poisonous animal nor reptile nor bird [nor] any evil and unclean compound that could harm health into medicines … to watch vigilantly over my colleagues in preparing all concoctions and in all measures which are created for their, the Tsar’s, health so that they [my colleagues] do not put into [those] concoctions anything bad nor substitute an evil herb for a good.4 The oath does not contain that now quintessential phrase of medical ethics – “primum non nocere” (first, do no harm) – but neither does the text from which the phrase supposedly originates, the Hippocratic oath.5 The popularity of this phrase seems to stem rather from its concise expression of what is seen as a fundamental principle of medical ethics of all periods, that physicians not use their knowledge for harm. The Apothecary Chancery oath agrees with the spirit of this: a central issue of this passage is that no medicine be prescribed that could harm health. This key document marking the start of medical service in the Apothecary Chancery thus emphasized in particular the issue of medical drugs as central to the maintenance or harm of someone’s health. This pledge to avoid harming health by careful attention to medical drugs, then, was the start of medical service at the seventeenth-century Russian court. Yet in all cases the association between court and practitioner pre-dated the oath taking, often by many months. The vast majority of medical practitioners working for the Apothecary Chancery were not Russian but rather recruits from Western Europe. They often received their first paycheque before even arriving in Russia, an honorarium to defray the expenses of travel. That travel, over hundreds of miles and taking weeks if not months, was their first act after having accepted\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 31\n\nThe Importance of Lekarstva\n\n31\n\ntheir position, recruited by their monarch, a Russian ambassador, or a merchant in Russian service.6 Yet the oath remained vital. Every practitioner had to take it, swearing on the Bible appropriate to his creed, before providing the least medical assistance. Violation of the oath was serious business: infractions of its precepts led to corporal punishment or dismissal. The Apothecary Chancery oath is notably detailed, taking up several pages of permitted, required, and banned activities. In this lies its great value to the historical study of medicine in early modern Russia: in this document Muscovites poured out their neuroses, revealed their obsessions, and fixed the limitations of their imagined official medical world. Oaths, in a very real sense, were the limits of that world, and the limits of that world were primarily arranged around medical drugs. The importance of the focus on medical drugs can also be shown by considering the aspects of contemporary medical practice to which the oath does not devote particular attention. Drugs are powerful, and therefore both useful and dangerous. Such a description could also be applied to bloodletting, the practice of opening a vein to remove excess blood that was almost idiomatically popular in early modern Europe. Russians certainly used this procedure, including on the royal family, but the oath does not mention it.7 Bloodletting is associated with the controversial practice of astrology, as bleeding must occur on the correct day. Medical astrology was debated at the Russian court, but its usage was not prescribed or proscribed in the oath.8 Apothecary Chancery practitioners also gave advice, a key part of early modern medicine, yet the giving of advice is also not mentioned.9 Surgery, a vital yet hazardous activity, receives one perfunctory phrase in one manuscript of the oath.10 Drugs, on the other hand, receive substantial attention in every extant copy. Among the various hazards of medical treatment that the Apothecary Chancery could have concerned itself in its oath, it chose specifically to focus on medical drugs. Also significant is the issue of who was swearing to carefully construct medical drugs. The Apothecary Chancery employed multiple groups of people. On the administrative side, there was the director, a high-ranking Russian noble [boiar].11 He was assisted by a committee of junior directors [sud’i pl., sud’ia sing.], usually career administrators known as secretaries [d’iaki pl., d’iak sing.], who would advise the head director how to proceed. Under this committee of directors worked a number of other secretaries and undersecretaries [pod’iachie pl., pod’iachii sing.].12 The department\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n32\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 32\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nalso employed translators, to facilitate communication between the mostly Russian administrators and the primarily non-Russian medical staff. Within the medical staff of the department, there were also multiple distinctions, of duties, responsibilities, and salaries. The highest rank of medical practitioner in the Apothecary Chancery was that of physician [pl. dokhtury, dokhtur sing.], a rank typically occupied by a universityeducated foreign physician. Senior physicians could be paid up to 1,114r per annum; junior physicians were commonly paid 460r per annum.13 Their boss, the head of the department, was paid at least one-third more than the physicians; his state secretaries [dumnye d’iaki pl.; dumnyi d’iak sing.] earned a similar salary to that of the physicians.14 In broader context, physicians’ wages were similar to that earned by middling court ranks like a military governor [voevoda], an arms bearer [okol’nichii], or a steward [stol’nik]. Aside from the nobles, the only groups earning substantially more than the senior physicians were some other foreign experts, as well as generals.15 The physicians then were compensated similarly to some of their senior chancery colleagues, but less than both their immediate superior and certain of their neighbours in the foreigners’ quarter of Moscow. Beneath the physicians in the medical ranks were the apothecaries [aptekari pl., aptekar’ sing.], typically trained in Western European guilds. The apothecaries worked with assistants, the alchemists [alkhemisty pl., alkhemist sing.] and distillers [distiliatory pl., distiliator sing.].16 Pay for the distillers was typically between 110 and 130 rubles per annum; apothecaries received more, between 140 and 360 rubles per annum, but substantially less than the top physicians.17 Not only were they paid less than the physicians and the state secretaries, they were paid less than other Russian colleagues like the secretaries and clerks as well as the interpreters and translators.18 This then put them in a similar salary range to military ranks like a captain or a ratnyi chelovek [lit. military person], middling administrators like a secretary, a clerk, or a local artisan like a blacksmith.19 The apothecaries were then positioned alongside other servitors with useful skills but who were not leaders or advisers. Lowest of the Apothecary Chancery’s permanent medical staff were the surgical ranks. This included surgeons [lekari pl., lekar’ sing.] and field surgeons [polevye lekari pl., polevoi lekar’ sing.], as well as specialists like bone setters [kostopravy pl., kostoprav sing.]. Their pay was the lowest of all the Apothecary Chancery medical ranks: 50 rubles per annum was a typical salary for these men, although they could receive as much as\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 33\n\nThe Importance of Lekarstva\n\n33\n\n140 rubles per annum.20 Their typical salary is then comparable to that of a bailiff, a musketeer, a sergeant, or a provincial servitor.21 Pay-wise, the surgeons were bracketed with lower-middle military and court ranks. From 1654 on, the Apothecary Chancery also had apothecary and surgery pupils, men usually taken from the musketeers’ ranks who were apprenticed to a foreign practitioner. Their pay reflected their position at the bottom of the ranks: the lowest-paid pupils were paid an official salary of just 1 ruble per annum. Pay to Apothecary Chancery staff included both this yearly salary and a monthly payment. Combining these, the lowestpaid pupil in the 1650s received 10 rubles 32 altyn for the year’s work. After pay rises in the early 1660s, a pupil could then receive as much as 29 rubles per annum.22 This was an incredibly modest salary, putting them below all other employees of the department, including the guards who protected the building they worked in.23 Pupils, then, were very low down in the economic stratification of the Muscovite service ranks. We can see who from these groups of administrative and medical personnel took the oaths by looking at those documents themselves. All such oaths end with the phrase “I attach my signature” [lit. hand], followed by the servitor’s signature. Symbolically, this shows the total acceptance of the precepts of the oath by the oath taker. Pragmatically, it also tells us who took the oath. Evidence from oaths across the seventeenth century shows apothecaries and physicians, surgeons, and even translators, all taking the same oath: one manuscript lists the apothecary Roman and the surgeons Matvei and Elisarei as all swearing the same oath; another the translators Matvei Eliseev, Vasilii Oleksandrov, and Andrei (no surname listed), as well as the surgeon Samoil Kam.24 Employees directly involved with making drugs, such as the apothecaries, employees responsible for prescribing drugs like the physicians, and even employees with no role in the creation of drugs like the translators, all took an oath declaring that they would be careful in the creation of drugs. This insistence that all staff in the department take an oath relating to the creation of drugs is unusual. To see just how unusual, we need to look at medical oaths of this period more broadly. The history of medical oaths in early modern Western Europe, from which the Apothecary Chancery took much of its medical practices, is less well researched than one might expect. Nevertheless, certain general points can be established. The most famous such text is the Hippocratic Oath, an ancient world text derived from the Hippocratic corpus of works associated with\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n34\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 34\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nthe ancient Greek physician Hippocrates of Kos, although the oath is one of several texts in the Hippocratic corpus that are unlikely to have been written by Hippocrates himself. The version of the Hippocratic Oath that is used in some medical schools today is also different from the original. Moreover, there is a significant historical gap between the composition of this text in ancient Greece and its modern-day use; there is only one definitive recording of it being used in early modern Europe, in Wittenberg, Germany, in 1508.25 Instead, multiple medical bodies in multiple polities wrote their own oaths.26 Looking more closely at these early modern Western European medical oaths, we see important differences from Apothecary Chancery procedures. In the documents of the Royal College Of Medicine and Public Health of Brandenburg-Prussia (est. 1685), physicians swore not to make their own medicines, other than secret preparations not available in pharmacies, but to use a trusted – and licensed – apothecary.27 A midfifteenth-century town physician oath from Amberg, southern Germany, set down broadly the same rules, as did a 1601 regulation for Frankfurt am Main in western Germany.28 Similarly, an eighteenth-century German oath required the physician to oversee pharmacies, but not to take an active part in making drugs.29 Here we see a minimization of the role of physicians in drug creation. In stark contrast to the Apothecary Chancery oaths, which made all medical practitioners take responsibility for drugs, the oaths for physicians from the early modern German lands see little role for these medical practitioners in the creation of drugs. Indeed, they often take the opposite approach, requiring physicians to keep their distance from the drug-creation processes. The real details about drug creation in Western Europe come from the oaths specifically aimed at the properly enfranchised drug creators: the apothecaries. Returning to the Royal College of Medicine and Public Health of Brandenburg-Prussia, we see that it set down many such rules for the apothecaries it licensed: not to sell without the approval or foreknowledge of a physician any purgatives, emetics, diuretics, or opiates, much less poisons.30 The fifteenth-century pharmacy oath from Amberg required the taker to swear to keep his medicines well, protect them from mice, and to take particular care of any potentially harmful medicines.31 The 1601 law from Frankfurt am Main required apothecaries to swear an oath on the good quality and suitability of medicines in their pharmacy.32 Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Dutch pharmacy oaths from\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 35\n\nThe Importance of Lekarstva\n\n35\n\nLeeuwarden, Leiden, and Den Haag all lay down similar conditions: adhering to the regulations of the guild and the pharmacopoeia, stocking the correct ingredients, preparing medicines according to physicians’ prescriptions, and selling poisonous goods with caution.33 A model oath, written in Latin in 1608, translated into French in 1637, and in use in some French regions in the mid-seventeenth century, makes a number of comments on making drugs, including a pledge to consult a physician before prescribing or making substitutions, and to promise not to stock bad drugs, not to give poison to anyone, nor help anyone to give poison to another.34 Western European medical institutions then set out careful and detailed rules regarding the proper creation, storage, and use of medical drugs and the central place of the apothecary in those processes. We can then see the Apothecary Chancery oath as expressing a very specific viewpoint on the role of medical drugs in official Russian medical culture. The creation of medical drugs was considered important and potentially dangerous above even other kinds of medical practice engaged in by the department. All employees of the department had to take the oath, regardless of their role in the creation of drugs, again underlining its centrality to the work of the department. Moreover, this practice of focusing so heavily on medical drugs and on having all employees take the same oath substantially deviates from the various contemporary oaths of Western Europe, which tend to separate out the work of medical practitioners in their oaths. Beginning with the Apothecary Chancery oath, we can already see the focus on medical drugs as particularly, perhaps even uniquely, important to the Russian context.\n\nProtecting the Tsar The Apothecary Chancery oath then shows notable departures from other contemporary medical oaths. Indeed, there is reason to consider the Apothecary Chancery oath, and its particular emphasis on medical drugs, from a different perspective. The Apothecary Chancery took a substantial amount of their official medical world from Western Europe: practitioners, books, equipment, ingredients, even words; the very names of the department across the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries – Aptechnaia izba, Aptekarskii prikaz – were taken in part from the Western European term “apothecary.” And so we must consider the Apothecary Chancery oaths in the context of Western European oaths. But we also\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n36\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 36\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nneed to put those oaths in the other vital context from which that text sprung: Muscovy. Fundamentally, the Apothecary Chancery oath was Muscovite. It was a medical practice oath, but it was also an oath of service, from a culture with a long history of service and loyalty oaths. Putting these medical oaths side by side with other Muscovite oaths we see that this focus on medical drugs was something that sprung more from Muscovite culture than Western European medical practice. The text of the oath raises questions as to the relationship of the medical oaths of the Apothecary Chancery to other Muscovite service oaths. In some respects, the concerns of the Apothecary Chancery oath over drugs were not entirely medical. The text specifies that drugs must not spoil [isportit’, s porcheiu] a patient. Although this term “spoiling” did have a broader usage, it was most commonly associated with witchcraft. As for the banned drugs themselves, they are referred to as evil [likhii], and as unclean in a ritual sense [nichistii]. The term cunning [khitrii, khitrost’], used in the Apothecary Chancery oath to describe unwanted and inappropriate behaviours, was also associated with witchcraft.35 According to Valerie Kivelson, poisoning was commonly linked to witchcraft.36 The essence of this link was that conflation of powerful consumed items and their ability to do harm in the Russian word zel’ia, repeatedly used in the Apothecary Chancery oaths. Practitioners taking the Apothecary Chancery oath were not only agreeing to abide by rules relating to correct pharmaceutical practices, they were simultaneously swearing off the practices of poisoning and malefic magic. Such concerns over both witchcraft and poisoning also appear in boyars’ oaths, the oaths taken by Russian nobles making up the tsar’s close retinue who played a key role in the Russian bureaucracy, including heading up departments such as the Apothecary Chancery. From at least 1598, and certainly throughout the seventeenth century, these oaths required the taker to abstain from bewitching or poisoning the tsar.37 Indeed, these oaths use the very same terms also used in the Apothecary Chancery oaths. The culture complex that put together poison-potion-medicine, combined with the fear of poisoning at court, indicates the origin of the Apothecary Chancery’s particular concern with medical drugs. The Apothecary Chancery oath’s extensive concern with this issue was a modification and amplification of the concern over poison, heightened in an atmosphere in which consumable medicines were a fundamental part of healing. The Apothecary Chancery oath was also linked to other Muscovite oaths by the injunction to watch colleagues and report their misbehav-\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 37\n\nThe Importance of Lekarstva\n\n37\n\niours. Muscovite service oaths commonly included what Ann Kleimola has dubbed the “duty to denounce” – promises to report the illicit behaviour of others.38 A key concern of these oaths was the duty of Muscovite servitors to safeguard their sovereign, commonly by denouncing anyone they heard plotting against the tsar.39 Some of these oaths, in particular those from the turbulent years at the start of the seventeenth century, mentioned poisoning specifically as a plot needing to be reported. This duty to denounce binds the Apothecary Chancery oaths to contemporary Muscovite service oaths. During the period in which the Apothecary Chancery functioned, there was indeed reason to be concerned over such political plots and poisonings. In 1584, Tsar Ivan IV died after a turbulent and often violent reign. This sparked theories, both at the time and more recently, that he may have been murdered. Following Ivan’s passing, his youngest son Dmitrii died under suspicious circumstances in 1591 and his elder son Fedor I died in 1598 without fathering any children. Fedor’s one-time regent Boris Godunov formally took the throne, and the country slid into the period of dynastic crisis known as the Time of Troubles. This short period – the start of which is dated to either Fedor’s death in 1598 or to Godunov’s in 1605, and the end to 1613 with the election of Mikhail Fedorovich as the first tsar of the new Romanov dynasty – saw many more suspicious deaths and rumoured poisonings. Such poisoning accusations continued into the Romanov period, with Mikhail Fedorovich’s first fiancée Maria Khlopova suffering from a stomach ailment in 1616 possibly caused by poisoning.40 We can connect these poisoning rumours to court medicine via the figure of Eliseus Bomelius. Bomelius worked as a medical practitioner at the Russian court in the 1570s, but was also rumoured to have worked as a poisoner for Ivan IV until the latter had Bomelius executed for disloyalty in 1579; those rumours took on a theatrical afterlife as Bomelius appears as the villain in N.А. Rimsky-Korsakov’s 1898 opera The Tsar’s Bride.41 The Moscow court had good reason to fear poisonings, both from members of court and from medical practitioners. The duty to denounce that was used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to attempt to guard against poisonings had a longer textual history. As established by Ann Kleimola, Muscovite service oaths ultimately derive from fourteenth-century inter-princely agreements. The latter were not service oaths, although they were, in a way, loyalty oaths: each prince pledged to be true to the other in their agreements. Particularly significantly, the requirement to denounce to the prince plots against him is also\n\nGriffin-010-ch01\n\n38\n\n23/04/2022\n\n11:08 AM\n\nPage 38\n\nMixing Medicines\n\nfound in the inter-princely agreements; each party pledged to inform the other of political mov"
