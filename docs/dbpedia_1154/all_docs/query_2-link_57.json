The Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 1 . 1 Introduction If a specialist in the early history of printing in Western Europe were to take in hand almost any book printed in the Old Cyrillic alphabet during the six¬ teenth, seventeenth or eighteenth century, his first reaction might well be one of surprise at its seemingly archaic appearance (see, for example, fig. 1). It will, in most instances, lack a title page,2 though it will have a colophon. It will use only a very few fonts of black-letter type. Its typesetters will have taken hardly any pains over such things as the straightness of the lines of type, the justifica¬ tion of margins, and all such matters of layout. Its printer will probably have failed to align black and red printing very well. The use of capital letters and marks of punctuation in it will strike him as primitive and unsophisticated. In all these and many other respects that Old Cyrillic book will remind him far more of the very earliest printed books, that is, with books printed before about 1475, than of books printed in Western Europe after about 1500. Some of his reaction, of course, will be due to his ignorance of the conven¬ tions of reading and writing in the Old Cyrillic alphabet, where the rules for capitalisation and punctuation are different from ours in the West. Even so, his reaction is good evidence that printing in Old Cyrillic before 1800 evolved and developed along very different lines, and yielded very different results, than did printing in the Latin alphabet in Western Europe during those same three hundred and fifty years. This difference is the ‘puzzle of early printing in Old Cyrillic’ to which the ti¬ tle of the present paper refers. This puzzle has occupied me for several decades now. In 1988 I said a few things about it in a paper for a conference on ‘The Millenium of the Baptism of Rus'’, held at the Library of Congress. Four years later that paper was published in the form of a scholarly article in Solanus under the title ‘Cyrillic and Glagolitic Printing and the Eisenstein Thesis’.3 1 The present article is a revised version of a Pforzheimer Lecture delivered at the New York Public Library on 21 October 2003, as part of the series ‘Book Culture in Russia: From Manuscript to Malevich’. 2 Exceptionally, very many Old Cyrillic books printed in Ukraine and Belarus were issued with title pages, like Western European books of the same period. This is to be explained by the peculiar position of these lands, which straddled the border between Slavia Catholica and Slavia Orthodoxa. 3 ‘Cyrillic and Glagolitic Printing and the Eisenstein Thesis’, Solanus (new series), 6 (1992), pp. 3-26. 6 Solanus 2004 Now, sixteen years later, it seems that I had cast my net far too narrowly in 1988, and that my conclusions at that time had been far too constrained by the usual concerns, methods and presuppositions of Western historians of printing and historians of the book — in particular by my critical focus on Elizabeth L. Eisenstein’s complex thesis. In 1988 I examined the data from an external point of view, comparing Old Cyrillic printing before 1800 with printing in other alphabets during the same centuries. Now I intend to look at the very same data from an internal point of view, that is, in light of the system of Church Slavonic literature taken as a whole.4 Since the data are the same, it will be enough to refer the reader to the former article for documentation.5 1.2 The Invention and Spread of Printing The art and craft of printing books with moveable type, in Eastern and West¬ ern Europe alike, sprang from the elegant new technology that had been in¬ vented by Johannes Gutenberg around the year 1 440 and perfected over the next few decades in the cities of Mainz and Strasbourg. From these two cities it rapidly spread throughout all Western and Eastern Europe, even crossing the great ecclesiastical boundary between the Roman Catholic and the East¬ ern Orthodox halves of Europe. Indeed, its eastward spread was brought to a halt only at the frontier between Christianity and Islam, because of Islamic political and theological reservations about the impact of the new technology. Of course Gutenberg’s first books were printed in the Latin or Roman al¬ phabet, which was used for almost all the languages of Western Europe. By the year 1475, however, moveable type had also been cut for the Greek and Hebrew alphabets. Not long thereafter type was also cut for the two his¬ toric alphabets of the Slavs, Glagolitic and Cyrillic. The first printed book in Glagolitic, a Roman Catholic Missal , appeared in 1483. In the years 1491- 1493 the first books were printed in Cyrillic, a set of five Eastern Orthodox liturgical books. These five alphabets were the only ones for which fonts of moveable type were cut and cast during the fifteenth century. Only in the course of the next two centuries did a very few other peoples begin to follow the example of the Greeks, the Hebrews and the Slavs in this respect. The first of them were the Armenians, who began to print books in their own alphabet and language in the year 1511 or 15 12. 6 4 Throughout this paper I will use the term literature in the broad sense of all written works of verbal art (in Russian, slovesnost'), not in the narrow sense of belles lettres (in Russian, khudozhest- vennaia literatura ) . 5 Mathiesen 1992 (note 3). 6 For early printing in all the non-Latin alphabets see Robert Mathiesen, The Great Polyglot Bibles: The Impact of Printing on Religion in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (Providence, R.I., The John Carter Brown Library, 1985), and Mathiesen 1992 (note 3). 7 Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 1 . 3 The Initial Advantages of Printing Everywhere in Europe the earliest books printed with moveable type very much resembled the manuscript books that were still being produced in large numbers in the fifteenth century. Despite the new technology of printing, it was still the labour of countless scribes, and not that of those new craftsmen called ‘printers’, that defined for most fifteenth-century readers what a book was: what it looked and felt like, and how it could be read or otherwise used. The earliest printers carefully preserved the ‘look and feel’ — to use a modern phrase — of manuscripts in their first printed books.7 Although the invention of printing did not immediately affect the look and feel of a book, many scholars and printers of the fifteenth and sixteenth cen¬ turies nevertheless saw that it altered the culture of the book in ways that greatly benefited scholarship. Their statements to this effect have been col¬ lected and discussed in several places, and need not be cited here at length.8 It will be enough to summarise three points that they made over and over again: • Many more copies of any book could be produced in a given time by a printer than by a scribe. • This greatly lowered the cost of each copy of that book. • This also allowed much wider dissemination of that book. 1.4 Regional Differentiation of Early Printing We tend to think, in our modern way, that the march of science and technol¬ ogy is inevitable and predetermined. Conditioned by our culture, we naively assume that any new invention will inevitably be developed to its maximum use¬ fulness (unless some outside force intervenes) , and that the path of its inevitable development will be uniquely predetermined by the potential of the technology itself. Yet this was not the case with the invention of printing.

The lines that divide these two halves of Europe are cultural and ecclesiastical, but secondarily also linguistic and ethnic. One of these halves comprises the nations and peoples that originally fell under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church (and eventually that of various Protestant Churches) . This has been called Europa Catholica or Europa Romana, or more simply Western Europe; the Slavs who are part of it may be called Slavia Catholica or Slavia Romana. To the other half belong the nations and peoples who are in communion with the Oecumenical Patriarch at Constantinople, and constitute the East¬ ern Orthodox Churches. This is Europa Orthodoxa. The greater part of these peoples are Slavic in language and culture, and may collectively be called Slavia Orthodoxa. The historic ecclesiastical language of Slavia Orthodoxa is Church Slavonic, and the alphabet in which it is written is called Old Cyril¬ lic.9 It is early printing in the Old Cyrillic alphabet and in the Church Slavonic language that is our subject in this paper. We are not concerned here in the slightest with printing in Peter the Great’s New Cyrillic alphabet (grazhdanskii shrift ), intended for the Russian language, nor with printing in any other mod¬ ern Slavic language or alphabet, nor with printing after the year 1800. Indeed, we are not very much concerned with printing after the founding of Moscow University in 1755. During the second half of the eighteenth century printing in the New Cyrillic alphabet (in terms of number of titles published) began to predominate over Old Cyrillic printing, while at the same time the traditional cosmology of the Orthodox Churches lost most of its imaginative hold on the culture of the book in Slavia Orthodoxa.10 9 For these terms, and especially Slavia Orthodoxa , see: Riccardo Picchio, ‘O cerkiewno- slowianskiej wspolnocie kulturalno-jezykowej’, Sprawozdania z posiedzeh komisji 1962 (Cracow, Polska Akademia nauk, Oddzial w Krakowie, 1962), pp. 449-54; his ‘A proposito della Slavia ortodossa e della comunita linguistica slava ecclesiastica’, Ricerche Slavistiche 1 1 (1963), pp. 1 05— 27; his ‘Slave ecclesiastique, slavons et redactions’, To Honor Roman Jakobson (The Hague, Mou- ton, 1967), pp. 1527-44, Janua linguarum, Series maior, 31-33; his Letteratura della Slavia orto¬ dossa: IX-XVIII sec.

Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 9 Printing in Slavia Catholica developed in much the same way as in other parts of Western Europe, and it does not possess any sharp distinguishing fea¬ tures of its own. Printing in Slavia Orthodoxa , however , developed in a strikingly different way, and yielded very different results. It is instructive, at the outset of our investigation, simply to tabulate the number of bibliographically distinct products of the printing press, century by century, for Europa (and Slavia) Catholica on the one hand, and for Slavia Orthodoxa on the other. The following table gives reasonably precise numbers for printing in the Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets and approximate numbers for printing in the Latin alphabet. It also includes precise numbers for print¬ ing in the Armenian alphabet and approximate numbers for printing in the Hebrew alphabet.11 Europa Catholica: Slavia Orthodoxa: Other alphabet: Century Latin Gla¬ golitic Old Cyrillic New Cyrillic Armenian Hebrew 15th 30,000 5 8 0 0 200 16th 200,000 30 269 0 22 4,000 17th ? 2,000,000 7 1,084 0 141 ? 18th ? 25,000,000 16 3,636 11,065 767 ? Total ? 27,230,000 58 4,997 11,065 930 ? Comparison of Printing in Various Alphabets: Number of Editions (15th-18th centuries) This table shows that Latin-alphabet printing in Europa Catholica was a far larger enterprise than printing in any other part of the world. To be sure, the nearly 5,000 editions printed in Old Cyrillic through the year 1800 com¬ pare quite favorably with the less than 1 ,000 editions printed in the Armenian alphabet, to say nothing of the fifty-eight editions printed in Glagolitic — but they compare not at all with the many million editions in the Latin alphabet. In consequence of these numbers, the output of printed books in Western 11 The figures are from Mathiesen 1992 (note 3), tables 5-8, where the sources are cited. The editor has kindly updated the number of sixteenth-century Old Cyrillic editions in the light of of two more recently published union catalogues, which the author has been unable to consult: Evgenij L. Nemirovskij, Gesamtkatalog der Friihdrucke in kyrillischer Schrift, 6 volumes published in the series Bibliotheca Bibliographica Aureliana, vols 140, 152, 155, 170, 171, 187 (Baden-Baden, Verlag Valentin Koerner, 1996-2003), and a further 5 in preparation; A. A. Guseva, Izdaniia kirillovskogo shrifta vtoroi poloviny XVI veka: svodnyi catalog (Moscow, Indrik, 2003), 2 vols. (The figures for Latin-alphabet printing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are nothing more than my own low educated guesses.) 10 Solanus 2004 Europe had greatly outstripped the output of new books in manuscript as early as the end of the sixteenth century. After that century only a relatively few forbidden kinds of books — e.g. grimoires and other magical handbooks — continued to circulate more widely in manuscript than in print. One result of this rapid shift in the balance between manuscript books and printed books was that by about the year 1550 the power to determine the proper ‘ look and feel’ of a book had shifted from scribes to printers in Western Europe . This new power enabled printers in Western Europe to innovate in many other ways. By the year 1 600 most Western European printed books no longer looked much like books in manuscript at all: a hasty glance suffices to dis¬ tinguish the one from the other. Title pages and their special formats, tables of contents and indices, footnotes and sidenotes, woodcuts, copperplates and steel engravings, the use of italic and bold fonts, indeed the complex use of many different fonts in a variety of sizes, and many other familiar features of the modern printed book — all these things had come to be the norm by the year 1600. 12 All these features of the printed book in Western Europe required a high de¬ gree of technical competence, and most printers rose to the challenge. Clumsy printing — lines of type not straight, margins poorly justified, red and black printing imperfectly aligned, inconsistent page layout, poor editing, and all kinds of sloppy presswork — soon became comparatively rare in Western Eu¬ rope. These were the features of ’ prentice work , and no master printer worth his salt would be caught dead with a piece of ’prentice work to his name. Indeed, Western European printing, like many other trades, made use of the appren¬ tice system: boys— and occasionally girls — learned the rudiments of printing as apprentices under the sharp eye of a master printer, then travelled as jour¬ neymen to work under other master printers elsewhere, and only after some years’ careful training became master printers themselves, legally qualified to set up shop on their own. In sharp contrast, in Slavia Orthodoxa printed books did not become numerous enough to outweigh books in manuscript until around 1800 , or even somewhat later. In consequence, the proper ‘look and feel’ of a printed book in Old Cyrillic continued to be set by scribes more than by printers for many cen¬ turies after this had ceased to be the case in Western Europe. Moreover, because there were so few presses in operation, an apprentice system like that of Western Europe could not work very well in Slavia Ortho¬ doxa. There may be some evidence for something vaguely like an apprentice system in the financial records of the largest of all the Old Cyrillic print shops, the Moscow Printing Office ( Pechatnyi dvor ), but it never worked very well 12 Geldner (note 7), chapter 5. Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 11 there, and it is not found elsewhere.13 With relatively few exceptions, printers of Old Cyrillic books usually did not achieve the virtuoso level of skill and technical competence that characterised the better presses of Western Europe. As a direct consequence of this, Old Cyrillic printed books rarely show the higher forms of sophistication in book design until after 1800. Only in the nineteenth century did this state of affairs change, with the wholesale intro¬ duction of Western methods of printing into Slavia Orthodoxa, with such new features as printing from stereotyped plates, not directly from moveable type. These changes mark the end of the period of early printing in Slavia Orthodoxa , several centuries later than in Western Europe. 1 . 5 The Repertory of Old Cyrillic Printed Books Yet all the differences which have been mentioned up to now are basically matters of technology. Historians of printing and historians of the book may find them intensely interesting. Most other people are easily bored by them. I apologise for dwelling on them at all, and would not have done so had they not been needed for what follows. Let us turn now to the most significant of all the distinctive characteristics of Old Cyrillic printing. There is no good technical term, it seems, for what we must consider now. In simple English, it is the matter of which books were chosen for printing, and which were not, but continued to circulate only in manuscript. One might speak of the ‘inventory’ of early printing for a given time and place, as if it were the contents of a great metaphorical warehouse. I prefer the term repertory , which echoes the title of an early masterwork of systematic bibliography: Lud¬ wig Hain’s Repertorium bibliographicum (1826-1838), which is the first detailed bibliography of the entire body of books printed during the fifteenth century. In Western Europe the repertory of early printing was large and varied, and it came fairly close to replicating the repertory of fourteenth-, fifteenth- and sixteenth-century books in manuscript. Because of this, and also because of the early numerical advantage of printed books over manuscript ones, in Western Europe the printing press acted as a kind of filter. In other words, those numerous earlier texts which had made it into print by about the year 1 600 continued to be read and discussed by the literate public long after that date, whereas those relatively few texts which had not made it into print by that time tended to vanish from public discourse, and to become the exclusive domain 13 See the records published and summarised by: I. Mansvetov, Kak u nas pravilis tserkovnye knigi: material dlia istorii knizhnoi spravy v XVII stoletii (po bumagam arkhiva Tipografskoi bib- lioteki v Moskve) (Moscow, Lavrov, 1883); and Pavel Nikolaevskii, ‘Moskovskii pechatnyi dvor pri patriarkhe Nikone’, Khristianskoe chtenie , 1890/1, pp. 114-41, 1890/5, pp. 434-67, 1891/1, pp. 147-86, 1891/4, pp. 151-86. 12 Solanus 2004 of the few professional scholars who continued to read books in manuscript.14 As the centuries passed, these books in manuscript came to be treated as rare and precious treasures in Western Europe (and the Americas), and were made available for reading under increasingly stringent conditions.15 More¬ over, as printed books diverged ever more sharply in their look and feel from books in manuscript, even the mere ability effortlessly to read a book in manuscript or an early printed book became less and less common. At present this ability is taught in special courses as an ancillary discipline of scholarship, of interest mostly to graduate students.16 In Slavia Orthodoxa, however, most Old Cyrillic printed books continued to have the look and feel of books in manuscript well into the eighteenth century, and countless scribes continued to produce manuscript books in great quan¬ tity well into the eighteenth century as well. In Slavia Orthodoxa the printing press did not begin to act as a filter until the nineteenth century. Up to about 1 800, anyone who could read an Old Cyrillic printed book could read an Old Cyrillic manuscript book of the same period with no greater effort. Yet these facts do not explain the most significant difference between print¬ ing in Western Europe and printing in Slavia Orthodoxa, namely, the very limited repertory of Old Cyrillic printing even when compared to the repertory of Old Cyrillic books in manuscript — to say nothing of a comparison with the repertory of printed books in the Latin alphabet! There were about 5,000 dis¬ tinct bibliographical items printed in the Old Cyrillic alphabet between the years 1491 and 1800, and over three-fourths of these hooks (about 3,800) are edi¬ tions of the same few dozen titles , over and over again.17 Moreover, these few dozen works include most of the really long texts in print, so if one counts not 14 Mathiesen 1992 (note 3), pp. 16-17; see also: Curt F.

The rapid growth of on-line publishing and on-line reference collections is already beginning to filter the works that will be easily accessible to future generations of students. Likewise, the day will come when the ability effortlessly to read an original printed book of the nineteenth or early twentieth century, with its ever more brittle paper and its ever more out-of-date means of data search and retrieval, will have become as advanced and specialised a skill as the ability to handle and read a fifteenth-century manuscript book is now. 17 For the various Gesamtkataloge from which this figure has been obtained, see Mathiesen 1992 (note 3), p. 12 (sources for table 6) and note 1 1 (above). Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 13 distinct bibliographical items, but distinct leaves or pages, the fraction rises from three-fourths to well over seven-eighths. What, then, are these few dozen titles that outweigh all others in the his¬ tory of Old Cyrillic printing? They are the liturgical books of the Slavic Ortho¬ dox Churches , which we shall consider more fully below. Here it is enough to note that the corresponding Roman Catholic liturgical books in the Latin al¬ phabet and language, though frequently printed and reprinted, comprise a far smaller fraction of the entire repertory of early printing in the Latin alphabet — certainly no more than one hundredth of the total, and probably much less than that. In sharp contrast to Western Europe, early printing in Slavia Or- thodoxa was employed before all else to produce a very large quantity of Eastern Orthodox liturgical books. This is not a simple reflection of contemporary scribal practice. Although scribes produced very many manuscripts of these same liturgical books during the centuries before printing, and continued to do so for some time afterwards, they also produced many manuscripts of other books, often quite lengthy ones. Most of these other books never made it into print, but continued to circulate in manuscript well into the nineteenth century. In sharp contrast to the situa¬ tion in Western Europe, early printed books did not crowd manuscript books out of the book trade until well into the 1 800s. 1 . 6 How Can We Approach the Puzzle? Thus we have specified some of the significant differences between Latin- alphabet printing in Western Europe and Old Cyrillic printing in Slavia Or- thodoxa up to 1800. How may we best explain these differences? What is their import? For about a century now a long succession of scholars has discussed what Georges Florovsky once called (in 1937) the ‘ancient, enduring and centuries long intellectual silence’ of Slavia Orthodoxa.18 Certainly these cultural differ¬ ences in printing could be taken as manifestations of such a putative ‘intellec¬ tual silence’, especially if one looks at them from a modern Western European point of view. But this merely broadens our puzzle without solving it; in fact, it pushes our efforts one step backward. Scholarship has not yet managed to ac¬ count for this ‘intellectual silence’, nor have scholars even arrived at any sort of firm consensus about the nature of the phenomenon to which this term refers.19 18 Georges Florovsky, Puti russkogo Bogosloviia (Paris, YMCA Press, 1937), p. 1, transl. by Robert L.

Billington, ‘Images of 14 Solanus 2004 Often it is easier to solve a well-defined small puzzle first, and then extend one’s solution to larger puzzles of the same character. This will be our ap¬ proach here. As just mentioned, about three-fourths of the repertory of early printed books in the Old Cyrillic alphabet were liturgical texts of the Slavic Orthodox Churches: they form the core and the bulk of that repertory. This was not the necessary and inevitable result of any economic or sociolog¬ ical or political cause. The market for many other books was strong enough that it would have paid a printer to print them, as shown by the large numbers of these books that have survived in manuscript from the centuries under con¬ sideration; and the same large numbers show that these other texts continued to circulate and find readers in Slavia Orthodoxa. Nor was there ever a general prohibition from the high authorities of church or state against the printing of other texts than liturgical ones; indeed, the occasional non-liturgical book was printed from time to time. And so forth. One can easily overturn each and every deterministic historical argument that the preponderance of liturgical books in the repertory of early printing in Old Cyrillic was the necessary and inevitable consequence of some combination of economic or sociological or political factors. We are not in the realm of historical necessity here at all, but in that of historical contingency , that is, of deliberate choices made by people who could have chosen otherwise than they did. Why, then, did the early printers of Slavia Orthodoxa, working in many lands and centuries, deliberately choose over and over and over again to print so many editions of the same few liturgical books of the Slavic Orthodox Churches, ignoring the real market for printed editions of almost all other texts? To answer this question we must first look at these liturgical books from the point of view of the Orthodox Slavs who bought and used them. We must ask what place they held within the literary and cultural heritage of Slavia Orthodoxa, that is, how they were used in that culture. Only once we have answered that question will we be able to solve the puzzle of early printing in the Old Cyrillic alphabet. Muscovy’, Slavic Review 21 (1962), pp. 24-34; Francis J.

Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 15 2. Literature, Liturgy and Cosmology in Slavia Orthodoxa 2. 1 The System of Church Slavonic Literature Many people, when they think about some particular literature at all, say, English literature or Russian literature, think of it as a vast ocean of works by countless authors, some great, others less so. If they organise this material at all, they do so historically, that is, in the familiar periods of literature and the familiar literary movements that have become the stock-in-trade of all college survey courses. Alternatively, they organise them by kind of works, e.g. poetry versus prose, the novel versus the short story, and so forth. All this history or typology is very superficial, and does not reach the heart of what makes each and every literature a unified whole. But the truth of the matter seems to me to be that every literature , taken as a whole , exhibits a structure or system all its own , by virtue of which all works of that literature are interrelated to one another. Of necessity, this structure is always far more subtle than the history of literary movements, or than a detailed typology of literary works by their genres or other features. In fairness to the reader, it must be noted here that there are few topics in the theory of literature more controversial than this one. Not only is there no consensus on the main features of the structure of any particular literature, but there is not even any agreement whether a literature, taken as a whole, has a structure in this sense of the term. In another article I have already staked my position in this controversy, and argued for it as strongly as I know how.20 Here I shall merely summarise what I have defended there. Thus I claim that the literature of Slavia Orthodoxa from its beginning up to about 1700 has been organised in terms of a system all its own. This literature is in several respects an odd literature, and there are many reasons why it is not much to the tastes of modern readers. Here are some of its odder features. • First, it consists chiefly of translations , as a rule made from Byzan¬ tine works in Greek. Original works in Church Slavonic are a very small part of Church Slavonic literature. • Second it de-emphasises originality and authorial identity. Origi¬ nal works hide the light of their originality under the proverbial bushel. With few exceptions, they are modelled very closely on ex¬ isting translated works. They are very often ascribed to the long- dead Byzantine authors of these translated works such as St John Chrysostom, or they are anonymous. • Third, it is primarily a liturgical literature , that is, a literature in which almost every work has its precisely specified place(s) within 20 Mathiesen 2004 (note 9), on which part 2 of this article depends heavily. 16 Solanus 2004 the liturgy and ritual of the Orthodox Churches. These works are to be read on those specified occasions; if such a work is read at any other time or place, this transgresses the norms of the cultures that make up Slavia Orthodoxa. Such a transgression is more or less severe depending on the work that was read and the circum¬ stances in which it was read, but it is always a transgression. • Fourth, many works of Church Slavonic literature, when read ac¬ cording to the norms of the culture of Slavia Orthodoxa, do not stand alone. Rather, they interact with one another and mesh with one another in complicated and ever-shifting patterns, much as the pieces of colored glass in a kaleidoscope combine with one another to produce ever-shifting patterns of light and colour. This may be called the kaleidoscopic nature of Church Slavonic literature. Since Church Slavonic literature is so odd, the structure that it exhibits will also be an odd one. I know of nothing like it anywhere in the literatures of Western Europe of any period. This may be why the structure of Church Slavonic literature has seemed opaque to all but a few discerning cultural and literary historians. However, the works of that literature offer many clues to this structure if — and only if — one examines them not in modern schol¬ arly editions, but in their original form and context as they are found in the manuscripts and early printed books. Following up these clues, we see that the structure of Church Slavonic literature as a whole is organised by two distinct parameters that are applicable to almost any work of that literature. (There are a few texts of which this is not true.) One of these parameters is the level of canonical au¬ thority that any given work has, that is, how authori¬ tative it is for establishing the doctrine and practice of the Orthodox Churches. Texts are classified accord¬ ing to several descending levels of authority. We may present the most important of these levels in the follow¬ ing figure: Scriptural Texts Counciliar Texts Liturgical Texts Patristic Texts Laic Texts Levels of Canonical Authority in Slavic Orthodoxa Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 17 The other parameter is liturgical , and thus ultimately cosmological. The Ortho¬ dox Churches have always insisted that liturgy and cosmology are intimately interrelated. Almost every text in Church Slavonic, whether it is original or translated, has a designated place and a specific use within the liturgy and ritual of the Slavic Orthodox Church. This place is almost always identified in the manuscripts and the early printed books, though most scholarly editions do not bother to reproduce the words that specify this. This is what Biblical schol¬ ars call the Sitz im Lehen of that particular text, that is, the site or position that it has in the worship and the lives of those who use or read it. This brings us directly to certain specifics of the liturgy and ritual of the Slavic Orthodox Churches, and to their basis in the traditional cosmology of the Orthodox Churches.21 2.2 The System of the Liturgy and Ritual of the Slavic Orthodox Churches The liturgy and ritual of the Slavic Orthodox Churches is extraordinarily com¬ plicated, but also of great elegance. If in Western Europe a priest needs very few books to conduct Roman Catholic worship — a Missal , a Breviary and a Ritual will generally suffice, except for the music — in the Orthodox Churches it is very much otherwise. Here Christian liturgy and ritual is not something that a priest can do wholly by himself, though parts of it are within the compe¬ tence of any layman or any priest in the privacy of his own room or monastic cell. The Eucharist is held to be a congregational action, and at least a vestigial congregation should be present, if only in the form of a single lector. Since Orthodox liturgy and ritual is essentially the work of a congregation, not just a priest, its texts were never shortened and synthesised into compen¬ dious volumes like the Roman Catholic Missal and Breviary or the Church of England’s Book of Common Prayer. They have remained distributed through a rather large number of distinct books, no one of which conveys anything like the entire shape and structure of the Church’s worship. The main model on which these many books are organised is a cosmological one, at the heart of which lies an elaborate doctrine of the cycles of time that make up the course 21 For the liturgy, the liturgical calendar and the liturgical books of Slavia Orthodoxa see: [N. Grigor'ev], Istoricheskoe obozrenie Bogosluzhebnykh knig Greko-Rossiiskoi Tserkvi (Kiev, Kievo-pecherskaia lavra, 1836); Konstantin Nikol'skii, Posobie k uzucheniiu ustava Bogosluzheniia Pravoslavnoi Tserkvi , 6th edn (St Petersburg, Gosudarstvenaia tipografiia, 1900); Alexander Schmemann, Vvedenie v liturgicheskoe Bogoslovie (Paris, YMCA Press, 1961), transl. by Ash- leigh E.

Six of these cycles of time must be mentioned here. The first three of them are also used in our own Western cultures today: • The Cycle of the Day is a recurring cycle from one sunset to the next, and contains the twelve numbered hours of the night and the twelve numbered hours of the day. • The Cycle of the Week is a recurring cycle from one Sunday to the next, and contains seven numbered days, each of which also has a name. • The Cycle of the Year is a recurring cycle of 365 days, or of 366 days every fourth year, and contains the twelve named months. Two other cycles of time are employed to determine the date of Easter, which must always be on a Sunday, but can never fall on the same date from one year to the next. Indeed, Sundays themselves can never fall on the same dates from one year to the next, because a common year consists of fifty-two full weeks and one day left over, while a leap year has two days left over at the end of its fifty- two full weeks. The change in the dates of Sundays from one year to the next repeats itself every twenty-eight years. This 28-year cycle is called the Cycle of the Sun , and it is used to determine on which dates Sunday will fall in any given year. But Easter cannot fall on just any random Sunday. According to the First Oecumenical Council at Nicea, Easter must be celebrated on the first Sunday after the date of the Spring Full Moon, which in turn is the first Full Moon on or after the Spring Equinox. To compute these Full Moons in all their astronomical detail was too com¬ plex for the Orthodox Churches, which have always used approximations of their true dates. By these approximations, the Spring Equinox always occurs on 21 March, and the Spring Full Moons always occur on one or another of nineteen possible dates between 2 1 March and 1 8 April (that is, nineteen specific dates out of the twenty-nine dates that fall within those limits). The nineteen dates for the Spring Full Moon repeat themselves every nineteen years. This 19-year cycle is called the Cycle of the Moon , and it is used to determine the date of the Spring Full Moon in any given year. So the Cycle of the Moon tells us the date of the Spring Full Moon for any given year, and then the Cycle of the Sun tells us which of the seven days after that Spring Full Moon will be a Sunday. That Sunday will be Easter. This yields a range of thirty-five possible dates for Easter, between 22 March and 25 April. From one year to the next the date of the Spring Full Moon changes according to a cycle of nineteen years, and the date of the Sunday Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 19 next after it changes according to a cycle of twenty-eight years. The pattern and rhythm of these successive dates for Easter repeats itself only after 532 years have passed (since 532 is the least common multiple of 19 and 28). These 532 years form the Great Paschal Cycle. There have been just four¬ teen complete Great Paschal Cycles since the traditional creation of the world on the last days of February and the first days of March in the year 5508 before Christ. The fifteenth such cycle began on 1 September 1940 (by our calendar). We referred above to the kaleidoscopic nature of Church Slavonic literature. It is these cycles of time that govern the turning of that kaleidoscope, to speak in a metaphor. All of the liturgical books of the Slavic Orthodox Churches, and many of the non-liturgical books as well, are organised according to these Cycles. Since the great majority of all texts in Church Slavonic have precisely specified places within the liturgical life of Slavia Orthodoxa, these cycles also establish the structure or system of that literature. These books may be divided into two great classes. Some of them contain the texts for the liturgical occasions that are determined by the Cycles of the Day, the Week and the Year alone. These may be called the fixed feasts (and fasts). Others contain the texts for the liturgical occasions that depend on the date of Easter, and thus occur on different dates from one year to the next. These may be called the moveable feasts (and fasts). A few books contain the Biblical texts that are used throughout all the Cycles, and a few other books contain those texts that are used on occasions that do not depend on any of the Cycles. The table on the following page shows the principal books in each class. For about one third of the year, texts for one and the same date must be taken not only from the appropriate volume of the Cycle of the Year — the Prolog and each kind of Mineia — but also from the appropriate book for the Easter Season. As the date of Easter varies from one year to the next, the exact ways in which texts from these two sets of books are combined will also vary. The pattern of these combinations will repeat itself only after 532 years have elapsed. Thus almost all works of Church Slavonic literature ‘dance with one an¬ other’, so to speak, according to a rhythm so elaborate and so complex that it does not repeat itself until 532 years have elapsed. No single human lifetime is long enough to witness more than about one-fifth of the whole grand cycle of the liturgy and ritual of the Slavic Orthodox Churches. Only a person who has lived a very long life and also happened to be born in one or another of a very few years within this 532-year cycle will even live to witness Easter falling on each one of its possible 35 dates in the calendar. 20 Solanus 2004 The Cycle of the Day • Chasoslov (Book of Hours), the services at certain hours of the day The Cycle of the Week • Sluzhebnik , the Eucharist on Sunday (and other weekdays) The Cycle of the Year (the Julian Calendar and the Fixed Feasts and Fasts) • Minei Sluzhebnye , services for the fixed liturgical days • Minei Chetii , long Lives of saints and related writings • Prolog , brief Lives of saints, read at Matins The Cycles of the Moon and Sun (Easter and the Moveable Feasts and Fasts) • Triod' Postnaia (Lenten Triodion), services from before Lent to Easter • Triod' Tsvetnaia (Festal Triodion), services from Easter to after Pentecost • Oktoikh , hymns on a repeating cycle of eight successive weeks All Cycles (Biblical Texts) • Evangelie , the four Gospels • Apostol , the rest of the New Testament except the Apocalypse • Psaltir , the Psalter and a few other psalm-like Biblical passages Independent of the Cycles « Trebnik , rituals for variable occasions, e.g. baptism or burial The Principal Liturgical Books of the Slavic Orthodox Churches This ‘dance of the texts’ is not a dance between individual units with im¬ penetrable boundaries between them— which is the closest we come to such a thing in the literatures of Western Europe — but a dance between units that may be discrete individual texts when examined in one way, but just parts of a whole when examined in another way. Taken as a whole, this entire body of texts in their ever shifting dance may be the greatest creation of Slavia Orthodoxa and Europa Orthodoxa, and one of the most vast, complex and elegant works of art, especially verbal art, ever conceived by the mind of humankind. It has been conceived on a scale more than human. Hence it has mostly been overlooked by scholars of past genera¬ tions. 2.3 The Traditional Cosmology of Slavia Orthodoxa All of these cycles of time are part and parcel of the traditional cosmology of the Slavic Orthodox Churches, which was not replaced by any Western cosmology in the consciousness of most Orthodox Slavs until well into the 1800s. Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 21 Here the term cosmology is not used as a scientist would, to refer to a branch of physics, but as cultural historians use the term, namely, to refer to a culture’s implicit theory or map or model of the universe in which it lives . From at least the late stone age onward, every culture is likely to have pos¬ sessed a cosmology — not always internally consistent, but always historically significant — which can be explicated. For a cultural historian, our current sci¬ entific cosmology might be only the most recent of these theories or maps or models. Eventually, perhaps, it may seem just as primitive to our remote descendents as medieval and early modern cosmologies seem to us. The traditional cosmology of the Orthodox Church derives in large part from that of the Ancient World before the coming of Christianity. It provides a model for both space and time, or more concretely, for both geography and chronography. According to this model, time has a definite beginning and a definite end, and its length is limited and finite. It is a part of creation, and not a dimension on some grid or an axis on some graph on which all things that exist can be plotted, or must have their place. In contrast to creation, God exists outside of and wholly apart from all time and space. Though time is linear and finite, it is measured out from its beginning by the cycles that we have mentioned above: the Cycle of the Day, the Cycle of the Week, the Cycle of the Year, the Cycle of the Sun, the Cycle of the Moon, and the Great Paschal Cycle. (It is also measured by the Cycle of the Indiction, fifteen years in length, but this cycle has no liturgical use and was not mentioned above.) All of these cycles began their courses together on the fourth day of Cre¬ ation, that is, on the first Wednesday, when the lights in the firmament of the heaven were created Tor signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years’ (Genesis 1:14). That Wednesday was thought to be 1 March in the year 5508 before Christ: only there do all seven cycles coincide at their beginning. That too is the year obtained when one counts backward from known historical events through all the genealogies of the books of the Old Testament. The starting points of all seven cycles will not coincide again until the year 7980 (=15x532) after the Creation of the World. If I have not miscalculated, we still have over 450 years to go until the end of the fifteenth Great Paschal Cycle. Whether at that date or some other, these seven cycles will all end only when time itself is over, at some unknown point in the future when The first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea’ (Revelation 21:1). So much for time! What about space? Right at the centre of the Cosmos lies our spherical Earth, which is composed of four elements — Earth, Water, Air and Fire — in various combinations. The inhabitable part of Earth may be mapped as a disk surrounded by the waters of the world-encircling Ocean. 22 Solanus 2004 This disk was usually drawn with East at the top. Asia occupied its upper half, Europe its lower left quarter, and Africa its lower right quarter. The Mediter¬ ranean Sea, drawn vertically, separated Europe and Africa from one another. Somewhere in the East, towards the very top of the disk, is the Garden of Eden, guarded by ‘Cherubim and a flaming sword’ (Genesis 3:24). At the end of time, it is in the East that Christ will appear as he comes again in glory to judge the quick and the dead (fig. 2). 22 On such a map, the Holy City of Jerusalem stands at the very centre of the known world. As we zoom in, we find at the centre of Jerusalem the Church of the Resurrection (which Western Europeans call the Church of the Holy Sepulchre). Indeed, from at least the eighth century up to the present a small spot in that church has been identified as the exact centre of the cosmos, the veritable navel of the world. It is a matter of circles within circles, each having the same point as its centre. The round Earth and its environs constitute the sub-lunary realm, or the sphere below that of the Moon. In the interior of the Earth lies Hell. If we do not go there, but move outward and upward, we leave the four elements wholly behind us as we pass through the successive spheres of the seven planets, or Wandering Stars, namely, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, in that order. Continuing to move in that direction, we next pass through an eighth sphere, that of the Fixed Stars. Beyond the eighth sphere may lie yet other spheres, but the specifics were controversial. Continuing ever upward, we would enter the Empyrean Realm. There dwell the Saints as well as the nine orders of angels: Angels, Archangels, Principalities, Powers, Virtues, Dominions, Thrones, Cherubim and Seraphim. And then God, Who is beyond all speech and all thought! This cosmology, as the Orthodox Slavs understood it, was neither exclu¬ sively naturalistic nor exclusively ‘supernaturalistic’ (to coin a word). In this cosmos the material and the spiritual, the natural and the supernatural, shared the same existence and activity. Christian men and women, saints and angels all lived cheek by jowl with one another in this cosmos, and the human world was not so sundered from that of saints and angels as it had long ago come to be in Western Europe. Indeed, the constant presence of these unsensed, living beings — angels and saints — seems to have been the single most important fact of human life for the Orthodox Slavs who lived in this cosmos, for these beings, unlike mortal men and women, were thought to dwell very near the Throne of God and to 22 See fig. 2, an eighteenth-century Russian wood-cut map of the world according to this tradi¬ tional cosmology that was recently acquired by the New York Public Library, which is reproduced in colour in Cynthia Hyla Whittaker, Edward Kasinec and Robert H. Davis Jr, Russia Engages the World, 1453-1825 (Cambridge, Mass. / London, Harvard University Press, 2003), pp. 4-5. Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 23 know His glory at first hand. Accordingly, the single most important thing that these same mortal men and women could do was to draw near to the saints and angels and join them in their eternal worship and praise of God. The entire liturgy and ritual of the Orthodox Churches is steeped through and through with language that explicitly proclaims this shared worship of mortals together with the saints and the angels. 3. The Solution of the Puzzle And thus we have come near to a possible solution to the puzzle of early print¬ ing in Old Cyrillic — why early printing in the Old Cyrillic alphabet developed so differently in Slavia Orthodoxa than in Western Europe, and yielded such different results. We have claimed that it cannot be understood as a necessary historical development, but only as a contingent one. That is, it was not the automatic or predetermined effect of any set of economic or social or political causes, but the result of a deliberate choice made over and over and over again by most of the early printers working in many lands and centuries throughout Slavia Orthodoxa. Though these printers worked in relative isolation from one another, and many of their presses were in operation for relatively short periods of time, almost all of them made the same choice — though any of them could have chosen otherwise, and a few of them did choose otherwise. In nearly complete independence of one another, most of them chose to print edition after edi¬ tion of the few dozen liturgical books used in the Slavic Orthodox Churches, and not to respond significantly to the very real market that clearly existed for copies of other texts.23 Their choice was not caused by powerful economic forces, nor by social or political constraints or distraints. Nor was it a choice made once in the past and communicated to these early printers down through several centuries and across great distances. If it was none of these things, what then can explain so many independent choices, all made in the same way? When we find this sort of thing — and we do find it very often in human history — it is always and only the result of shared assumptions, of a shared world-view, or a common model and theory of the world in which the men and women lived who made these independent, yet similar choices. Starting from the same assumptions and world-view, moved to action by the same circumstances, people will independently make the same 23 There were exceptions, of course. Though these exceptions — for instance, Frantsisk Skaryna — have greatly attracted the attention of modern historians of printing because of their marked individuality and originality, they still remain very small drops in the bucket of early printing in Old Cyrillic. Most of that bucket was filled by the products of the Moscow Printing House and the other presses that followed much the same programme of publications. 24 Solanus 2004 choices as one another.24 They have done this over and over, throughout hu¬ man history. With few exceptions, the early printers of Old Cyrillic books and their cus¬ tomers were Orthodox Slavs. Almost all of them unconsciously shared the common world-view that characterised Slavia Orthodoxa from the fifteenth century well into the eighteenth. They lived out their lives within the common patterns and rhythms not only of Orthodox liturgy and ritual, but also of daily life. They worked in similar circumstances, albeit in different centuries and lands. And thus they made similar choices independently of one another. It should not surprise us that their choices were different from the choices that other printers made in other parts of Europe, for these other printers adhered to other forms of Christianity. By 1450 Western European printers had come to hold other and quite different world-views; they had come to live by other and different patterns and rhythms of sacred and secular time and space; and they worked under other and different circumstances. Of course they made different choices! How could it have been otherwise? With respect to our puzzle and its solution, the most significant element of the world-view that prevailed throughout Slavia Orthodoxa during the cen¬ turies in question was its model of the cosmos, which we have just described. And the grandest creative expression of that world-view was the whole com¬ plex structure of the liturgy and rituals of its Orthodox Churches — a creation which it shared in large part with the Greeks and the other Orthodox peoples. The single most important feature of this world-view was mentioned in the final two paragraphs of the previous section. This was the constant and un¬ examined belief that the ordinary world of men and women was not at all sundered from the world of saints and angels, that each person’s every task and activity was carried out in the close and welcome company of these dis¬ embodied sentient beings who were one’s close neighbours. To moderns this may seem like the rankest ignorance or superstition, or like a poetic fantasy, or — somewhat more charitably — like an admirable theologi¬ cal conceit that may be valid in theory, but can have no immediate practical consequences. But in history it is not so much the real or the material that will have far-reaching practical consequences, as the immaterial and the unreal. It is not so much one’s external world as one’s internal world-view that guides one’s choices in life. Given that the Orthodox Slavs saw and experienced their world in this way, 24 This is, for me, the fundamental axiom for the understanding of all human history and behaviour. Like every axiom, it cannot be proven in and of itself, only accepted or rejected. I came to it initially from the discipline of anthropological linguistics, where it was most persuasively formulated in a series of papers by Benjamin Lee Whorf that appeared during the years 1936- 1941 (reprinted in Benjamin Lee Whorf, Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings, ed. John B. Carroll (Cambridge, Mass., M.I.T. Press, 1956), see especially pp. 134-59, 246-70). Cosmology and the Puzzle of Early Printing in Old Cyrillic 25 what other activity could possibly have been more important to them than the duty or liturgy (in Greek, A eiroopyla originally meant £a public duty’) that they shared with their unsensed neighbours, the saints and angels — than perform¬ ing the liturgy and ritual of the Orthodox Church? As a rule, the men and women of Slavia Orthodoxa, during the centuries that concern us, were quite sure that the traditional cosmology of their culture was true and well-founded. It is not hard to find passages in the original writings of the Orthodox Slavs that take just that for granted. Given all this, naturally the printers of Slavia Orthodoxa supposed that liturgical books were the most important and useful books they could ever print. This certainty of theirs had nothing whatever to do with economics or politics — or with any aspect of their material world, as we understand it — but everything to do with their world-view. Naturally they chose to print liturgi¬ cal books in far greater numbers than all other texts put together. They could have chosen to do otherwise, and a few printers did so choose. But it was their shared world-view, and not their shared world, that impelled the others to choose quite independently of one another to print the same. 26 Solanus 2004 I! mhm . ^ ca&w ' « 'icM IS ' ' | „ ;i! % |jl inffiiti * ff4- . ’ y§| ;; — «|t®t ; ■, * * m -m. %Mk ;.4: . ■I iiill||»llllllliMll^lilMi^^»^^M *1 COI^AIfc A .5 i sf S ?§:fii:ill > . ; «1||B1 If# #0=1?% ; : !' f| \" 11 ■ i 1 1 : Ilii : | :; ^r: . ||1| § : ■ ' .'.: \".' r I III ;.§ W0 '\"'\" : i: H H m . _ i ■101m Fig. 1.

Ivan the Terrible and Book Culture: Fact, Fancy, and Fog: Remarks on Early Muscovite Printing 1 Edward L. Keenan In the broader historical context of early-modern East Slavic culture, the story of the printed book in Russia offers us revealing lessons and puzzles, including the riddle of the role of Ivan the Terrible in that history. It is true, of course, that generalisations from the meagre evidence cannot be made with great con¬ fidence; the history of printing in Russia before the mid-eighteenth century is the history of a very modest achievement.2 But that very modesty permits us the more easily to take its measure, and to make observations about Mus¬ covite book culture in the broader context, which context, not surprisingly, extends far beyond Russia itself. I should like, in fact, to place the matter within three broader contexts, which nestle one within the other, like the fa¬ miliar matryoshki. First, we must consider the general European context. The development and dissemination of printing from movable type — conveniently termed ‘the Gutenberg revolution’ — was fully as revolutionary and international a devel¬ opment as has been the introduction of electronic information processing in our own time. While I address myself here primarily to reflections upon how that revolution played itself out in some of the most distant corners of Europe, the Slavic periphery, and in particular to the subject of early printing in Mus¬ covy, we should note that a complete inventory of early ‘Cyrillic, Glagolitic and Petrine Civil Script’ publications (to use the terminology of a recent cata¬ logue)3 would take us deep into the history of Cyrillic and Glagolitic printing in what are today Italy, Germany, England, Sweden, Holland, Poland, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Romania, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine — and we could hardly deal with the subject properly without some consideration of the far more extensive printing in those countries in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Yiddish, Armenian and a dozen or so European ver¬ naculars. 1 The present article is a revised version of a Pforzheimer Lecture on Printing and the Book Arts delivered at the New York Public Library on 1 8 November 2003, as part of the series ‘Book Culture in Russia: From Manuscript to Malevich’. 2 To give a sense of scale, which we must keep in mind: the whole of sixteenth-century Mus¬ covy’s book output was roughly equal to three days’ production in France at the same time. See note 8, below. 3 I. V. Pozdeeva and Zora Z. Kippel, eds, Church Slavonic, Glagolitic, and Petrine Civil Script Printed Books in the New York Public Library: A Preliminary Catalog (Marina del Rey, CA, Charles Schlacks, Jr., Publisher; [New York], New York Public Library, c. 1996). Ivan the Terrible and Book Culture 29 This realisation leads me to the second context I would like to point to: sixteenth-century Eastern Europe. Strangely enough, discussions of the his¬ tory of printing in Russia are today more often detached from this, its natural environment, than from the more familiar West European frame.4 The six¬ teenth century was a period of explosive expansion of printing in many coun¬ tries, in which Muscovy’s participation was minute. One may contrast, for example, the list of sixteenth-century imprints issued in Mexico, which is not only vastly longer, but far more diverse in subject matter (botany, for example) and languages, including books in native Amerindian languages.5 The comparison with neighbouring Sweden is perhaps more relevant, but equally illuminating: Sweden’s first printed book was a book of moralising fables — in Latin — followed by a Missal and other devotional works, apparently printed by and for German speakers: sixteen true incunabula (i.e. pre-1501 imprints) in all. Their bibliographer Sten Lindberg complains that Sweden produced only just under 500 titles in the sixteenth century; Muscovy pro¬ duced roughly one per cent of that number during the same period. But in Sweden, as in Muscovy, the state controlled printing to the best of its ability; Gustav I Vasa (1523-1560) closed down Catholic printing, and encouraged such typical Reformation projects as a Swedish Bible in 1541 (the so-called Gustav Vasa Bible, issued in at least 2000 copies) and Lutheran ‘Instructions’ (i.e. Catechism) written in a plain style that laid the foundations for mod¬ ern Swedish.6 In the seventeenth century many presses, including roughly ten university presses, began to turn out a great variety of imprints, some even in runic type (the latter presumably intended for the antiquarian fringe).7 My point here is that we should understand from the start that it is mis¬ leading to view our subject through a narrow ‘Russian’ lens, as most special- 4 Note the qualifiers: ‘more often’ and ‘today’. Exceptions are the comprehensive works of Nemirovskii and Guseva, which return to the practice of the founders of Cyrillic book history (I. P. Karataev, Opisanie slaviano-russkikh knig napechatannykh kirillovskimi bukvami, tom. 1: S’ 1491 po 1 652 g. , St Petersburg, 1 883, and V. S.

We should not, of course, be surprised that, printing having become the engine and emblematic product of vernac¬ ular literatures and the Protestant Reformation, its history has customarily been viewed primarily through a national or confessional lens. At the same time, however, we must appreciate that the real history of printing knows no national or confessional boundaries. But we must now turn to the Russian context itself. Although our electronic library catalogues all have rubrics like ‘Printing — Russia — History’, alongside, say, ‘Printing — Germany — History’, the history of the printed book in Rus¬ sia is vastly different from its articulation in other European environments. Like all revolutions in Russia before and after 1917, the ‘Printing Revolution’ (to use Elizabeth Eisenstein’s phrase for the dramatic expansion of knowledge through print in the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries)8 was suppressed. By this I mean not simply that printing came late to Russia, or that there are, technically speaking, no Russian incunabula. Nor can one deny that in other countries, as in Russia, the use of the printing press was closely controlled for religious or political reasons. It was not the Patriarch of Moscow, after all, but the Pope of Rome, Paul IV (1476-1559), who in the last year of his life promulgated the infamous Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Least of all do I think that the printing of books in Russia did not, after roughly 1700, become quite energetic — however modest and thematically limited it may seem in the contemporary European context.9 I have introduced these qualifications and disclaimers because in our times, as I have mentioned, the story of printing has become, like so much of history writing, the vehicle for various manifes¬ tations of nationalism and parochialism.10 Note, for example, that the scope of otherwise comprehensive and reliable catalogues of Cyrillic early-printed books tends to be limited either to titles now found in certain collections or to the production of a single centre, now usually associated with one or another national tradition.11 8 Elizabeth L. Eisenstein, The Printing Press as an Agent of Change: Communications and Cultural Transformations in Early-Modern Europe (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1979), vols I and II. See also the accessible one-volume version, The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1983). 9 In an earlier lecture in the New York Public Library series, a version of which is also pub¬ lished in this issue of Solanus, my colleague Robert Mathieson of Brown University took an en¬ tirely different position on what Fr. Georges Florovsky once called the ‘silence’ of pre-Petrine culture. I find his views unconvincing, but this is not the place to address them. 10 An example can be seen in the unnecessarily polemical tone of Szczepan K. Zimmer’s oth¬ erwise quite convincing refutations of the rather ethno-centric views of E. L. Nemirovskii in Zim¬ mer’s The Beginning of Cyrillic Printing. Cracow, 1491: From the Orthodox Past in Poland (New York, Columbia University Press, 1983). 1 1 I note again that Nemirovskii’s and Guseva’s works cited in note 4 are admirable exceptions. Until their appearance, catalogues tended to be compiled on the basis of the holdings of one country (Cleminson et al., note 6 — the only substantial union catalogue); one repository (A. Kh. Ivan the Terrible and Book Culture 31 With these initial caveats and definitions in mind, let us address the matter of Ivan the Terrible and the book culture of his time. It must be acknowledged that little can be said with confidence on this subject, as the relevant data are exceptionally sparse — indeed there is almost no documentary evidence directly relevant to the matter. One may imagine a number of reasons for the limitations of the documentary record: • Losses as a result of simple physical destruction: in particular the (selective?) destruction of documentation, particularly during the dramatic and devastating period we know as the Smuta or Time of Troubles (1605-1613), but subsequently as well, during such times as the Napoleonic occupation of Moscow, the World wars, and the like. • A Muscovite upper-class prejudice against writing: that is, the possibility that Ivan refused for socio-cultural reasons to engage in writing, because the Muscovite rulers considered ‘clerkship’ an occupation unworthy of their status. • Some kind of vast historiographic conspiracy: the result of a later seventeenth-century attempt to besmirch Ivan’s reputation, or in general a re-writing of history through destruction of the record. Let us deal with these hypotheses in order: firstly, simple losses of docu¬ mentation. As anyone familiar with Muscovite archives or documentary pub¬ lications can attest, for the period after roughly 1475 modern historians pos¬ sess an enormous volume and range of documents produced precisely in the grand-princely scriptorium— diplomatic and administrative correspondence, cadasters, treaties, wills, and the like.12 Moreover, the pattern of sources we possess today is in no systematic way different from the assortment of docu¬ ments that were available at Ivan’s death or just after the Time of Troubles.13 Indeed in general the physical preservation of the grand-princely household — buildings and objects and documents — is quite remarkable: were Ivan to re- Gorfunkel', compiler, Katalog knig kirillovskoi pechati 16-17 vekov, Leningrad, LGU, 1970); or one place of publication (A. S. Zernova, compiler, Knigi kirillovskoi pechati, izdannye v Moskve v XVI-XVII vekakh: svodnyi katalog, Moscow, Gosudarstvennaia biblioteka SSSR im. V. I. Lenina, 1958). 12 The volume and range of published documents is also enormous. For an introduction: M. N. Tikhomirov, Istochnikov edenie istorii SSSR; uchebnoe posobie (Moscow, Izdatel'stvo sotsial'no- ekonomicheskoi literatury, 1962-) and for descriptions of the most relevant collections, TsentraV- nyi go sudarstvennyi arkhiv drevnikh aktov SSSR: putevoditel' (Moscow, Glavarkhiv SSSR, 1991- 1999), 5 vols. 13 See the meticulous reconstructions of Zimin and Shmidt (A. A. Zimin, ed., Gosudarstven- nyi arkhiv Rossii XVI stoletiia: opyt rekonstruktsii, Moscow, Akademiia nauk SSSR, Institut istorii SSSR, 1978; S. O. Shmidt, ed., Opisi Tsarskogo arkhiva XVI veka i Arkhiv a Posol'skogo prikaza 1614 goda, Moscow, Izdatel'stvo vostochnoi literatury, 1960). 32 Solanus 2004 turn to the Kremlin today, one could provide him with clothing and furnish¬ ings, and place him in living spaces, that he would find quite familiar. And he could, if he cared to, hold the originals or contemporary copies of the wills and treaties of the majority of his forbears since Dmitrii Donskoi.14 It seems likely, indeed, that it is precisely the excellent (restored?) state of preservation of the royal precincts and objects — together with some misguided expectations — that fosters the persistent notion that a rich Grand-Ducal library must once have existed.15 But if we can confidently discard the notion of devastating and se¬ lectively complete losses, how are we to explain the fact that none of the thou¬ sands of documents and other manuscripts that have survived from Ivan’s time — and his court — bear no signatures and no annotations in anything that can be considered his hand?16 This question brings us to our second possible hypothesis: was writing con¬ sidered a servile activity, beneath the dignity of members of the court? Such a cultural pattern is perfectly plausible on its face — the Muscovite rulers had d'iaki to do that kind of menial work, and d'iaki were originally of rather low social status (although, of course, with the growth of the bureaucratic state some bureaucrats — mostly after Ivan’s time — became quite rich and power¬ ful).17 But: if Ivan refused to write, and was surrounded by courtiers who refused to write, it is difficult to understand how such a fact becomes an argu¬ ment that he was literate. There being no substantive documentary evidence to the contrary, we must assume that Ivan died as he was born: illiterate. In 14 Dukhovnye i dogovornye gramoty velikikh i udel'nykh kniazei XIV-XV1 vv. (Moscow, Leningrad, 1950). 15 The various works, some dating from the very dawn of Russian historiography, that speak of such a library, now allegedly lost or buried beneath the modern Kremlin are based upon fan¬ tasy or misunderstanding, as will become apparent upon an alert reading of the most recent contributions to the genre: I. Ia. Stelletskii, Poiski biblioteki Ivana Groznogo (Moscow, Izdatel'stvo ‘Sampo’, 1999); his Mertvye knigi v moskovskom tainike: dokumental'naia istoriia biblioteki Groznogo (Moscow, Moskovskii rabochii, 1993); N. N. Zarubin, Biblioteka Ivana Groznogo: rekonstruktsiia i bibliograficheskoe opisanie (Leningrad, Nauka, Leningradskoe otdelenie, 1982). A much more judicious, but still insufficiently skeptical, view can be found in S. A. Belokurov’s ‘O biblioteke moskovskikh gosudarei v XVI stoletii’, Sbornik Moskovskogo Glavnogo Arkhiva Ministerstva Ino- strannykh Del (Moscow, 1898), vyp. VI and VII, and separately (Moscow, Tipografiia G. Lissnera i A. Geshelia, 1898). Those interested in probability may wish to compare the state of preserva¬ tion of a real royal library, from an earlier century, in a no less turbulent country: Ilona Berkovits, transl. Susan Horn, Illuminated Manuscripts from the Library of Matthias Corvinus (Budapest, Corv- ina Press, [1964]). 16 It was claimed for a time, originally by D. N. Al'shits, that the annotations to some vol¬ umes of the illuminated palace chronicles ( litsevye svody ) were in Ivan’s hand, but that fantasy seems to have been forgotten, even by proponents of the literate Ivan. See Al'shits, ‘Ivan Groznyi i pripiski k litsevym svodam ego vremeni’, Istoricheskie zapiski, XXIII (1947), pp. 251-89; cf. Niko¬ lay Andreyev, ‘Interpolations in the Sixteenth-Century Muscovite Chronicles’, Slavonic and East European Review , XXXV (1956), pp. 95-1 15, and B. M. Kloss, Nikonovskii svod i russkie letopisi XVI-XVII vekov (Moscow, Nauka, 1980), p. 257. 17 It seems quite possible that the situation was analogous to that described for the Roman aristocracy in William Harris, Ancient Literacy (Cambridge, Mass., Harvard, 1989). Ivan the Terrible and Book Culture 33 this he was not dramatically different from the vast majority of his courtiers, many of whom were his near and more distant relatives. While we do possess evidence that some members of this crowd could make a signature, and per¬ haps read the plain-style chancery hand of the times (the so-called prikaznyi iazyk ), true literacy in that time and place required a knowledge of Church Slavonic — not Russian — and there is precious little evidence that any secu¬ lar person possessed that knowledge before roughly 1600. In this regard the warriors of the Muscovite court had much in common with the uneducated nobility of England of roughly a century earlier.18 We come, finally, to our third possible explanation for the total absence of positive documentation concerning Ivan’s literacy: could there have arisen a historiographic conspiracy in early Romanov times, in an attempt to besmirch Ivan’s reputation? This hypothesis may seem to be the most fanciful of those we have proposed, but it is not without foundation: since the Romanovs, who claimed descent from Ivan (albeit indirect: Mikhail Fedorovich was a grand¬ nephew of Ivan’s first wife, Anastasiia), were at considerable pains to burnish the fearful tsar’s image, anti-Romanov writers in the early seventeenth century seem indeed to have attempted to blacken it.19 But since the image of the tsar as brooding literate intellectual did not arise until roughly the time of the first truly literate tsar, Aleksei Mikhailovich, anti-Romanov critics — who certainly had enough defamatory evidence about Ivan — had no need to point out his illiteracy, which at any rate was probably not considered a major failing. Although it is clear that anti-Ivan ‘histories’ appeared at this time, there is no evidence of wilful and selective destruction of the record.20 It seems, therefore, that there is no convincing reason to believe that our sources are somehow deficient, or that they once conveyed evidence that Ivan the Terrible had any interest in what we have been calling ‘book culture’, or any significant practical contact with it, passive or active.21 It must be said 18 See for comparative purposes J. H.

That belief is without foundation in the sources, but not, to be sure, without its defenders. The latest summary of the matter can be found in Charles Halperin’s ‘Edward Keenan and the Kurbskii-Groznyi Correspondence in Hindsight’, Jahrbiicher fur Geschichte Osteuropas , neue Folge, Bd 46, 1998, pp. 376-403, and my ‘Response to Halperin, “Edward Keenan and the Kurbskii-Groznyi Correspondence” ’, in the same number, pp. 404-15. 20 For a description of some trends in early seventeenth-century history-writing, see (with cau¬ tion) V. I. Koretskii, Istoriia russkogo letopisaniia vtoroi poloviny XVI-nachala XVII v. (Moscow, Nauka, 1986). 21 It does, however, seem unlikely that printing in the Kremlin could have arisen without his approval. 34 Solanus 2004 that there are differing views on these matters. Indeed, the vast majority of specialists would reject such a conclusion. In my view, however, the evidence that is commonly adduced with regard to Ivan’s putative literacy proves not that Ivan was literate, but that a few Muscovites — including, perhaps, Ivan himself — owned a few books, which, of course, is indisputable. One is, how¬ ever, obliged to examine such tangential evidence, however briefly. It is occasionally pointed out that some more or less contemporary foreign¬ ers’ accounts seem to imply that Ivan was literate. Others, however, claim the opposite. These itinerants of the Age of Exploration are, to be sure, almost the only people who wrote anything explicit about Ivan as a person, but their testimony is hardly unimpeachable: in addition to their ignorance, all of those ‘Muscovy hands’ had polemical, typically anti-Muscovite, agendas that arose from their political objectives or cultural bias. As the merest acquaintance with the likes of Giles Fletcher, Jerome Horsey, et al. quickly reveals, they were largely politically motivated rumour-mongers. Such people almost never laid eyes on Ivan or his private space, and their accounts were largely based either on earlier printed ‘Russia books’ of authors who never visited Russia or on the self-serving accounts of Muscovite grumblers.22 The recent re-publication of Raffaello Barberini’s Relazione di Moscovia has attracted some attention for its apparent reference to Ivan’s sponsorship of printing. All Barberini has to say, however, is: ‘ Hanno Uanno passato introduttovi la stampa , la quale hanno cavato di verso Constantinopoli da ’ Greci e io ho veduto che gia stampavano a Mosca con gran facilita e li caratteri loro sono la maggior parte cavati dalVAlfabeto Greco. ’ 23 (‘Printing was introduced there last year, which they got from the Greeks in Constantinople, and I saw that they were already printing in Moscow with great ease and the characters are mostly taken from the Greek alphabet.’) Since there are at least two mistakes in this sentence (‘ cavato di verso Constantinop¬ oli ’; *gid stampavano a Mosca con gran facilita ’), and it betrays a noteworthy ignorance of earlier Cyrillic printing, it is far from clear just what Barberini’s account is worth as evidence that Ivan had any personal role or interest in early printing. One sometimes encounters the argument that Ivan lived in a ‘literate mi¬ lieu’. My colleague Ruslan Grigor'evich Skrynnikov, for example, has ad¬ duced, as an argument for general literacy in Ivan’s surrounding time, a re- 22 The best work on this subject remains Andreas Kappeler’s Ivan Groznyj im Spiegel der aus- landischen Druckschriften seiner Zeit: ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des westlichen Rufilandbildes (Bern, H. Lang, 1972), but see also Gabrielle Scheidegger, Perverses Abendland — barbarisches Rutland: Begegnungen des 16. und 1 7. Jahrhunderts im Schatten kultureller Mifiverstandnisse (Zurich, Chronos, c. 1993), and Marshall Poe, A People Born to Slavery: Russia in Early Modern European Ethnog¬ raphy, 1476-1748 (Ithaca, N.Y., Cornell University Press, 2000). For the various early claims of literacy, cf. Belokurov, op. cit., passim. 23 Maria Barberini and Idalberto Fei, eds, Relazione di Moscovia scritta da Raffaello Barberini (Palermo, Sellerio, 1996), p. 94. Ivan the Terrible and Book Culture 35 production of what he identifies as Boris Godunov’s autograph from the pe¬ riod before his ascension to the throne.24 But Skrynnikov identifies no source for that (hardly calligraphic) rukoprikladstvo (which does appear to represent a certain otherwise unidentified ‘Boris’). What is it, in fact? Whatever it is, it has very little — perhaps nothing — to do with Ivan. It is also claimed on occa¬ sion that Ivan’s father and uncle were literate.25 It does seem conceivable that Vasilii III may have added something to one letter being sent to his daughter, Elena, who had been given in marriage to Prince Alexander Casimirovich of Lithuania, but it seems clear that the actual letters were written by Vasilii’s d'iak , Menshik Putiatin.26 Other evidence of Vasilii Ill’s or Andrei Staritskii’s putative literacy seems equally insubstantial.27 Some authors have advanced the claim that Muscovite and provincial cavalrymen valued literacy, but the evidence adduced often has to do with the generations that followed Ivan’s. A. V. Antonov, for example, cites a Nagoi family will of 15 97. 28 The Nagie, kin of Ivan’s last (sixth? seventh?) wife Mariia, were exiled and persecuted after Ivan’s death. Exile, indeed, seems to have a strong correlation with no¬ ble literacy, perhaps because the most frequent places of political exile were in the monasteries of the old Novgorodian North, with their very respectable libraries. In the very next decade, indeed, one encounters the first truly liter¬ ate (in Church Slavonic, the literary language) noblemen of the warrior class, the likes of Semen Ivanovich Shakhovskoi and perhaps Ivan Khvorostinin.29 But all of this, too, tells us little or nothing about Ivan. Much has been made of seeming references in ‘the inventories of the royal archives’ to books be¬ ing taken from repositories for Ivan’s use. What we find there are notations of the type ‘ knigi Mengli-gireevy vziaty k gosudariu ’.30 But such references are 24 R. G. Skrynnikov, Boris Godunov (Moscow, Nauka, 1983), p. 86. 25 See V. V. Kalugin, Andrei Kurbskii i Ivan Groznyi: teoreticheskie vzgliady i literaturnaia tekhnika drevnerusskogo pisatelia (Moscow, Iazyki russkoi kul'tury, 1998), pp. 138-39. 26 As I pointed out some time ago ( Festschrift for Nicholas Riasanovsky = Russian History / Histoire Russe , vol. 20, nos 1-4, [1993], pp. 5-13), the documents in question have no proper dat¬ ing and attribution, having been published by M. A. Obolenskii in 1848 and not, so far as I know, since. (Dr Andrei Pliguzov, a colleague thoroughly acquainted with the holdings of RGADA, once told me they had been lost.) 27 See, for example, Kalugin (note 25). The photograph (source unidentified) on p. 139 is probably of a clerk’s hand, but it is certainly conceivable that it is Staritskii’s. Our only even moderately reliable way to identify hands, however, is by careful comparison with other texts that are confidently dated and attributed. In this case, so far as I am aware, there are no comparandi. 28 ‘Klinskie akty XV — XVI veka’, Russkii diplomatarii , 4 (Moscow, Pamiatniki istoricheskoi mysli, 1998), 100. 29 Cf. my ‘Semen Shakhovskoi and the Condition of Orthodoxy’, Harvard Ukrainian Studies, v. 12/13, 1988/1989, pp. 795-815. 30 In fact, the case I refer to — chosen quite by chance — goes on to say: ‘/ sgibli, kak posteV- nykh khorom verkh goreU The very same formula vzial ... ko gosudariu is employed to describe the temporary removal of a kuran tatarskii (Zimin I, 93) which no one, to my knowledge, has advanced as evidence that Ivan read the Qur’an. 36 Solanus 2004 evidence only of the given files having been taken v verkh , i.e. into the palace precincts or the private chancery. The record contains numerous references to inscriptions that claim that Ivan donated manuscript and printed books to private and monastery libraries. Such inscriptions can serve as evidence that some Muscovite monks believed or wanted others to believe that a given book had come from the tsar’s own hand, but they tell us little, if anything, about Ivan himself, beyond the fact that he participated in such typical Muscovite cultural activities as donating church books to the monasteries.31 To summarise: much of the evidence that has been adduced on this mat¬ ter is in fact very scattered testimony concerning Muscovite literacy (mostly not in Church Slavonic, the literary language and the language of all books printed in Moscow during Ivan’s lifetime), and much of it is far from being unquestionable. But at its indisputable core, it does tell us something about very general measures of literacy and (largely mysterious) Muscovite individ¬ uals who may or may not have been literate in Church Slavonic or Russian plain style. It tells us nothing of substance, however, about Ivan himself. What, then, can confidently be said about Ivan and the book? It is certainly true that printing in Muscovy began during his long reign (1533-1584). But so, apparently, did any number of Western innovations of which Ivan may have had little understanding, such as the distillation of alcohol and the production of gunpowder.32 And all printed books that appeared in Muscovy in the six¬ teenth century (and almost all that appeared before 1700, for that matter) were written not in Russian or in any East Slavic vernacular, but in a South Slavic liturgical language, Church Slavonic, slightly modified for use among East Slavs, but still largely unintelligible to the uninitiated.33 It will be pointed 31 Such information can be found passim (esp. pp. 22-24) in N. N. Zarubin’s very speculative Biblioteka Ivana Groznogo (note 15), published with major emendations and cautionary annota¬ tions by S. O. Shmidt and A. A. Amosov. The works of B. M. Kloss and A. A. Amosov provide some insights into the work of the press at Aleksandrovskaia Sloboda and claim a close contact between the Church and the court in the production of printed books and manuscripts under Ivan the Terrible, but they contain no direct evidence to the effect that Ivan was literate. 32 See the articles for vodka and porokh in Barkhudarov et al., Slovar russkogo iazyka XI-XVII v. (Moscow, Nauka, 1975- ), vols 2 and 17, resp. (In the first instance, the obviously medicinal first use, ‘ Vodka . . . v ranu pushati . . . ’ is wrongly assigned to the year of the events described, 1533. In fact the text in question, written on papers datable no earlier than 1596, was probably created in the early seventeenth century. See Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei, IV/ 1, a"
