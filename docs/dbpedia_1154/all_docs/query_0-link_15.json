The centers for the creation of aviation in Russia were, naturally, Petersburg (I.Sikorsky - \"Russo-Balt\" and DP Grigorovich) and somewhat later Moscow (A.N.Tupolev - TsKB under TsAGI, organized on the initiative of NE Zhukovsky ). From the school Sikorsky left Polikarpov, later along with Gurevich and Grigorovich, who gave the development of the fighter (Mikoyan and Gurevich, Lavochkin) and hydroaviation (Beriev). And from the school Tupolev - S.V. Ilyushin and PO Sukhoi, who made an era in fighter aviation with gas turbine engines. Tupolev himself was, as is known, a designer of bombers, and later of passenger aircraft. The branch of the Tupolev design bureau was the bomber KB Petyakova, after his death, headed by Myasishchev.\n\nSeparately, mention should be made of the Kamov Helicopter School (1902-1973) and his former deputy in charge of serial production of Mile (1909-1979), created back in the late 1920s. As they say, the very word \"helicopter\" was invented by Kamov. The autogyro (or rotary-wing) of Kamov was used even during the Great Patriotic War as an artillery fire corrector. Heavy landing gliders, used during the war, designed the famous aircraft designer Tsybin in his design bureau.\n\nThe names of the oldest members of the Soviet elite - aircraft designers Dmitry Pavlovich Grigorovich , Nikolai Nikolayevich Polikarpov , Andrei Tupolev and his colleague Alexander Arkhangelsky , Sergei Vladimirovich Ilyushin , Vladimir Mikhailovich Petlyakova , of Alexander Yakovlev , Artem Mikoyan and his constant collaborator Mikhail Gurevich , Seeds Alekseevich Lavochkin , Pavel Osipovich Sukhoi , the creator of modern seaplanes Georgy Mikhailovich Beriev, Viktor Fedorovich Bolkhovitinov , Vladimir Mikhailovich Myasishchev , Oleg Konstantinovich Antonov , helicopter designers Mikhail Leontyevich Mil and Nikolai Ilich Kamov are widely known.\n\nDozens of other creators of aviation equipment for one reason or another remained less well known, but whose selfless and fruitful work made a considerable contribution to the creation of first-class domestic aircraft manufacturing.\n\nKonstantin Alekseevich Kalinin was the founder of a large group of various aircraft designs. Sergey Alexandrovich Kocherigin headed the design of the two-seat single-engine fighter Di-6 (mass-produced); he is the author of experienced high-speed scouts and attack aircraft R-9 with a motor M-85 and \"W\" with a motor M-88 . Ivan Pavlovich Bratukhin designed the helicopters. Alexander Pavlovich Putilov - the creator of a number of original projects, including the experienced intelligence officer \"Stal-11\" .\n\nAlexander Petrovich Golubkov headed in the design office of A. N. Tupolev for the design and construction of the giant four-engine amphibian ANT-44. Dmitry Lyudvigovich Tomashevich , one of the deputies N. N. Polikarpova, supervised the construction of an experienced I-180 fighter , built an experimental S-110 fighter, successfully passed joint tests and gave a ticket to the experimental M-107 motor. Nikolai Alekseevich Zhemchuzhin, also deputy to N. N. Polikarpov, headed the design and construction of the MPI-1 multi-seat cannon fighter with two M-103 engines, the first experimental and serial diving twin-engined BIT-2 bomber.\n\nVladimir Nikolaevich Chelomey , the successor to Polikarpovs design bureau, was the author of the La-11 with pulse-jet engines. Zelman Isaakovich Itskovich created the KAI-1 training and training aircraft included in the series with two M-11 engines for training the pilots of the SB high-speed bomber. He also built a number of gliders and an experienced passenger aircraft DKL with two MG-31 engines .\n\nAlexander Sergeevich Moskalev designed and built the CAM-5 and CAM-2bis sports small-sized airplanes , which for a long time belonged to the world distance flight records for this class of machines. Long before the war, he created an experimental arrow-shaped aircraft, the flying wing , which was the prototype of modern supersonic machines. Ilya Florent'evich Florov and Alexey Alexandrovich Borovkov worked for a long time on the floor-less maneuverable biplane fighters . They built the OKB-7 and I-207 , successfully passed the test.\n\nPilot Vladislav Konstantinovich Gribovsky created the G-2 , G-9 , G-11U gliders , which were serially built. He is also the author of the sports aircraft G-21 , G-23bis and others. Especially good was his sport aerobatic plane G-22 .\n\nDesigners Vladimir Petrovich Gorbunov and Mikhail Ivanovich Gudkov built together with S. A. Lavochkin the famous fighter of the Great Patriotic War, the LaGG-3 , and then independently engaged in design activities. Pavel Vladimirovich Tsybin created a multi-seat airborne glider, the C-25 , which for a long time was in service with the airborne units, built experimental airplanes. Mikhail Mikhailovich Pashenin on the eve of World War II built an experienced fighter I-21 . Joseph Fomich Nezval completed design and successfully made all modifications of known long-range bombers TB-7 - Pe-8.\n\nPavel Ignatievich Grokhovsky designed the first multi-seat cargo glider and developed a parachute system for dropping heavy military equipment . Motuz Ruvimovich Bisnovat designed and built in 1940 the original fighter SK-2 with a small area of wings and a small extension (with the motor M-105 ). Alexey Yakovlevich Shcherbakov created a cheap wooden transport aircraft Sche-2 with two M-11 engines . It was produced in a large series. Igor Vyacheslavovich Chasovikov built an experienced high-altitude biplane aircraft RV-23 who had two sets of boxes of wings - with one and two sections. The plane easily climbed to thirteen thousand meters. Vsevolod Konstantinovich Tairov - the author of the single-engine wooden passenger plane OKO-1.\n\nAram Nazarovich Rafaelyants modified the N. N. Polikarpov Po-2 serial aircraft in such a way that it could carry up to seven people or more than five hundred kilograms of cargo. This machine was tested under the brand name RAF-2 and was operated for a long time at the Scientific-Research Institute of the Air Force. Professor Semyon Osipovich Zhonshai and his successor, Associate Professor Arkady Lvovich Dinmifarb created an experimental E-1 aircraft with a motor M-48. When designing it, the lightest magnesium metal alloy was used. Friedrich Dupé built the G-1 sport avionette with the M-11 engine in GOSNIIGVF. She successfully flew in the mid-thirties, quite astonishing flight crew. It is impossible not to recall with kind words of the remarkable protnev of the Central Aero-Hydrodynamic Institute ( TsAGI ), Professor Viktor Nikolaevich Belyaev, a modest and charming man. The strength group of the aircraft headed by him calculated the designs with an accuracy in the range of 100-103 percent."
