        "text": "DISCOVER THE BHSU THEATRE PROGRAM\n\nEncompass Expression and Exploration\n\nBlack Hills State University Theatre is a small program with big benefits, where the artistic process is as important as the final product. The program provides a student centered learning environment focusing on cultivating the collaborative skills, creativity and professionalism necessary to pursue a career in theatre. Students build a solid foundation from which they are prepared to attend graduate school or enter the job market.\n\nYou will be prepared to attend graduate school, accept a specialized internship, or enter the job market.\n\nFormer students are working as: actors, directors, designers, technicians, playwrights, teachers, arts administrators, marketing directors, event planners and entrepreneurs.\n\nA theatre minor or certificate will enhance the employment perspectives of students in a variety of fields, particularly in Education and Business.\n\nBHSU Alumni\n\nMauili Delaney-Theatre\n\n“Five years ago, I was able to step onto my first Hollywood set with the confidence that I could jump in and effectively handle anything that was thrown at me as a production assistant. Since then I have worked on numerous television series such as: Agents of Shields, Castle, Scandal, The Foster’s, and Shameless. I am currently working as Natalie Portman’s assistant on the film Pale Blue Dot. I am eternally grateful for the invaluable skills I learned in the BHSU Theatre Department which have allowed me to build a successful career in Hollywood.”\n\nMelissa Mason-Theatre/English Education\n\n“My experience as a theatre student at BH allowed me to develop the skills to acquire multiple jobs before I graduated. These included: television production assistant for The Bachelor and the Travel Channel, stage work for concert venues and Event Supervisor for the Legendary Buffalo Chip. Following graduation, I was offered my current position at Thunder Basin High School in Wyoming where I teach Acting, Technical Theatre, Design, and English. I am also the Drama Club Sponsor and Theatre Director.”\n\nMelissa Boring-Theatre\n\n“My time at BHSU broadened my skill-sets in every aspect of theatre, from acting and directing to building, painting, and design. In the world of theatre production, the more you can do, the more valuable you are to a team, and the broader your appreciation for the collaborative nature of the craft. It was through my background in set design and makeup that I worked on a film that was a nominee for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance Film Festival and for the Golden Camera at Cannes. This in turn has led me to work on another film with this director/writer, who has since won several other awards and is considered one of the brightest young directors in Hollywood. Building upon the education I received at BHSU, I am about to finish my Masters in Theatre, and have been praised for the knowledge and mastery I already had going into the program.”"
