        "text": "There is so much to connect with in this book. Individuals come together from many places to a small town in eastern Pennsylvania in the 1930s. Many of the characters are recent arrivals and each exudes their particular heritage as they work to make a life for themselves and their progeny. How much do we each know of our heritage and the heritage of those around us? How do we connect with others in our commonalities and in our differences?\n\nI would add that I think the novel would be a difficult read if you aren’t a reader who can keep track of many characters or many threads— there are both!\n\nAs with all of my leader book guides, this guide contains significant spoilers. This is not a review and is meant to be read after you have read the book. I hope that this guide helps book discussion leaders create a space where individuals can make connections between The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store and their lives.\n\nOnline Resources\n\nGetting to know James McBride\n\nNot surprisingly, James McBride speaks like he writes. In the middle of one thought, he finds a new idea to share, and another tangent follows from that. And then he returns to the initial stream of thought like a branch from a river eventually returning to the main watercourse.\n\nHe spoke at the Free Library of Philadelphia, which is recorded and available on youTube. I enjoyed listening to McBride share about pretty much everything — reading from the book; presuming goodness in people; the importance of us acting as one right now; his use of language and dialogue. He is a wonderfully humorous person!\n\nHe also shared a one-hour conversation with Marty Moss-Coane on The Connection, which is a wonderful, meandering sharing of what humanity is, Black-Jewish relationships, antisemitism, the awareness of the children in the book, disability, and so much more incorporating love, humor and a huge capacity for seeing the good in people. In this conversation he says,\n\n“The truth is if you want to see the world and you work at it, it makes you better, it makes you stronger, it makes you more tolerant, it makes you happier and it makes you less cynical.”\n\nAntisemitism\n\nThe Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives shares a brief summary of antisemitism in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nPBS has a three-night documentary titled The Jewish Americans that explores 350 years of Jewish American history. On their webpage they also have short video clips and book excerpts.\n\nPennhurst\n\nPennhurst was a State School and Hospital in Pennsylvania, where residents with disabilities were abused, neglected, beaten and assaulted. You can read about its history including the investigations into the abuse at the institution and lawsuits agains Pennhurst. The Arc, which advocates for and with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, have called for boycotting Pennhurst as a horror attraction.\n\nCharacters\n\nMalachi the dancer— a Jewish dancer who floats in and out of the novel— a bit wizard-like\n\nChona— Jewish American who welcomes everyone into her store on Chicken Hill\n\nMoshe Ludlow— Romanian Jewish owner of the All-American Dance Hall and Theater in Pottstown, married to Chona\n\nIsaac— Moshe’s older cousin in Philadelphia\n\nNate Timblin— Black resident on Chicken Hill\n\nAddie Timblin— Respected stateswoman on Chicken Hill, married to Nate\n\nDodo— Addie’s 12-year old nephew who lost his hearing when a stove exploded\n\nFatty Davis— Black owner of the Juke joint on Chicken Hill\n\nEnzo Carissimi, aka Big Soap— white Italian immigrant on Chicken Hill, close friends with Fatty\n\nFioria Carissimi— Enzo’s mother\n\nDoc Earl Roberts— white doctor and member of Ku Klux Klan\n\nBernice Davis— Fatty’s sister, Chona’s neighbor since childhood\n\nPatty Millison aka Newspaper— Black laundress on Chicken Hill and town information spreader\n\nIrv and Marv Skrupskelis— Jewish Lithuanian brother cobblers\n\nRusty— young Black man on Chicken Hill\n\nMonkey Pants— boy with cerebral palsy at Pennhurst who befriends Dodo\n\nPia Fabicelli— white cleaning lady and city news sharer\n\nMiggy Fludd— Black woman working at Pennhurst and living on Hemlock Row\n\nAnna Morse— funeral home owner in Linfield\n\nBags— Rusty’s Uncle\n\nCarl Boydkinses— Doc’s cousin and KKK member\n\nReverend Ed Spriggs, also known as Snooks— reverend on Chicken Hill\n\nYakov Flohr— Chona’s father, owner of the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store and first rabbi of Ahavat Achim\n\nKarl Feldman— rabbi after Yakov\n\nShad Davis— Bernice and Fatty’s father, stonemason, built Heaven & Earth Grocery Store for Yakov and built Ahavat Achim\n\nGene— Fatty’s older cousin in Philadelphia\n\nGus Plitzka jr.— city council president and owner of the dairy on Chicken Hill\n\nBullis— Black man who delivers eggs and coffee to Pennhurst\n\nSon of Man— violent pedophile employed at Pennhurst\n\nBook Discussion Topics\n\nAs with so many novels, a book discussion of The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store can go many different directions. I hope that the discussion questions that follow help readers explore connections we can each make to our own lives as we read and what we can do to change the world for the better.\n\nPresent issues are historical issues\n\nThe feelings and ssues that residents are wrestling with on Chicken Hill in the 1930s, in many ways have changed little.\n\nFor instance,\n\n“Conversations about race always made him uneasy. He tried to change the subject.” page 70\n\nDo conversations about race make you uncomfortable? Do you change the subject or push through your discomfort?\n\n“‘I didn’t know there were so many Spanish people around here,’ he mumbled.\n\nMario smiled. ‘To you, they’re Spanish. To me, they’re Puerto Rican, Dominican, Panamanian, Cuban, Ecuadorian, Mexican, Africano, Afro-Cubano. A lot of different things. A lot of different sounds mixed together.’” page 162\n\nDo you lump people together by their skin tone or language? Have you erroneously made assumptions about people knowing one another or presumed they would get along because they spoke the same language or were similar in skin color?\n\n“The difference was that the white man in the South spoke his hatred in clear, clean, concise terms, whereas the white man in the new country hid his hatred behind stories of wisdom and bravado, with false smiles of sincerity and stories of Jesus Christ and other nonsense that he tossed about like confetti in the Pottstown parade.” page 353.\n\nIf you live in the U.S. does this still ring true to you today? Is there a difference to the racism experienced in the South as compared to the North? What do you see being done in the South to dismantle racism? What is being done in the North? What about in your country? How do the expressions of prejudice change across regions?\n\nPlace\n\nChicken Hill is a place where newcomers arrive and perhaps, in time, move on to other more prosperous neighborhoods, or where folks have dreams of moving on.\n\nMany such neighborhoods exist in cities where there are waves of immigration. For instance, the lower east side in Manhattan has seen successive groups of newcomers settle there. The Tenement Museum is a fabulous museum sharing stories of working-class tenement residents who moved to New York City form other countries. I highly recommend a visit there if you’re in Manhattan.\n\nWhere are these neighborhoods in your part of the world? How have the cultures changed or stayed the same in these neighborhoods?\n\nAnti-semitism\n\n“The Jewish population grew from two to ten to seventeen families, stopping at that number when the town’s fathers decided through intimidation, clever laws, and outright thievery that seventeen Jewish families were enough.” page 96\n\nHow much do you know about how Jews or any other group in your country have been discriminated against whether through force, laws, rules, interpersonal interactions or other means? How were Jews limited in the schools they could attend, clubs they could belong to, professions they could pursue, homes they could purchase in your communities? Were you aware when some of the formal restrictions were removed and where and how the informal networks continued to discriminate?\n\nHere is just a small sampling:\n\nMcGill University in Montreal imposed a quota on Jewish medical students until the 1960s.\n\nYale University enacted a policy to limit Jewish enrollment to about 10% until the 1960s.\n\nCountry clubs around the world didn’t admit Jews, women, Black members and others, often until late in the 20th century, such as The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts.\n\nJewish workers in the UK face antisemitic ideas in their daily lives\n\nChildren’s openness to others\n\nWhile nearly all of the characters in the novel are adults, the acceptance and joy of children is shared in references Chona makes about Dodo,\n\n“The boy brought his own kind of light.” page 107\n\nand\n\n“In four months, he had become a living embodiment of l’chain, a toast to life. A boy. A boy living a life.” page 108\n\nHave you experienced this embodiment of life in a child?\n\nMalachi sends Moshe a tiny pair of cowboy pants with a Star of David sewn on. Moshe sends them back in elaborate packing including soldering a pretzel can shut. After asking Nate who he knew that soldered Moshe thinks,\n\n“The delight in this silly exchange lightened his heart, and he began to think things through more clearly…” page 164\n\nSometimes I find the exuberant and silly incessant joys of a child’s life, decrease with age. And when one of these joys is unleashed it does lighten my heart. Have you had that experience? How do you hold on to the daily joys in life? The small happy surprises that bring you laughter and lightness? Have you been stuck and found an amusing or heartwarming connection with someone to help you get unstuck?\n\nIn addition, children in the novel don’t draw friendship boundaries by race or national origin or economic ability,\n\n\"The Hill’s Italian immigrants generally stayed to themselves, but the children played without boundaries.” page 186\n\nHave you seen the openness and acceptance of a child change as they grow older? Did your own acceptance change as you aged? Can you recall specific times as a child when you were unaware of the cruelties of racism, antisemitism, ableism, and many other forms of prejudice?\n\nRacism\n\nAs a child at school Chona sees the racism of her teacher at school. The teacher admonishes Bernice for the wrong stitch, yet doesn’t call out Chona for the same incorrect stitch.\n\n“For Chona, the day Bernice Davis closed off the world was the beginning of her own adulthood, for the realization that lay before her had begun to clamp down on her and she could see Chicken Hill and the town for what they really were.” page 105\n\nDo you recall when you first experienced this understanding, whether the wrong was against you or someone else? How have you taught children about racism? How have you taught yourself, children, others about ant-racism?\n\nCommunity\n\nThe community of Chicken Hill has members from many different places with many different perspectives. McBride shares the compassion and the pain, the annoyances and the love, the support and the disagreements among the community members.\n\nIn his interview on WHYY, McBride says,\n\n“The humanity of people far exceeds the differences.”\n\nThere are many differences among the community living on Chicken Hill, yet they are all aiming for a better life and they come together to get Dodo out of Pennhurst. A local resident, Paper, serves as the news broadcaster on Chicken Hill. Other characters fulfill a variety of community roles.\n\nDo you live in a community? What makes it a community? Where have you seen the power of community coming together? Do you agree with McBride that the humanity of people far exceeds the differences?\n\nWho are your everyday community members who serve critical roles locally? Your volunteers? The folks who reach out to help a neighbor? The resident who raises money for the annual fireworks display?\n\nInclusivity, love and acceptance\n\nAs Chona approaches death, her love for Moshe is forefront. She wants to share the extraordinary wisdom that has come upon her, as she thinks\n\n“how one’s tribe cannot be better than another tribe because they were all one tribe.” page 220\n\nIn the acknowledgements, McBride comments that\n\n“Sy’s lessons of inclusivity, love, and acceptance— delivered not with condescending kindness but with deeds that showed the recipients the path to true equality— remained with me of the rest of my life.” page 383\n\nMcBride shows that Inclusivity in the community of Chicken Hill coming together to rescue Dodo. He shares that in the acceptance exhibited by Chona throughout her life on Chicken Hill. There is so much in this novel sharing the individuality of the characters and so much sharing the strength of humanity together.\n\nWhere do you witness inclusivity, love and acceptance among differences? Where do you value the differences among individuals and where have you seen commonality be forefront?\n\nIn the words of McBride on WHYY,\n\n“That’s why Chona was such an important character, because she saw past all of that. She was a person who saw the world cleanly\".”\n\nWho do you know who practices acceptance of others on a daily basis? Where have you seen deeds rathe than words setting a positive example?How do you work to create the acceptance? Where has it been difficult to express acceptance?\n\nPartners who bring out the best\n\nWhen Moshe walks into Chona’s life she thinks,\n\n“Here was a man who wanted her to be full, who never blocked the entrance to the doors of knowledge and growth and passion and life’s reckoning, who brought her books and records and music.” page 106\n\nFatty and Big Soap, Chona and Moshe, Addie and Nate. Each brings out the best in the other.\n\nDo you have someone in your life who brings out the best in you? Who wants you to be full? Who is there for you despite your disagreements and differences?\n\nRepairing the world\n\n“To her the world was not a china closet where you admire this and don't touch that. Rather she saw it as a place where every act of living was chance for a tikkun olam, to improve the world.” page 275\n\nTikkun olam was not a phrase I was familiar with before this story. I appreciated this description of tikkun olam on Chaba.org.\n\nOn the Chabad.org website they share:\n\nEach act of tikkun olam is a fine-tuning of our world’s voices. With each tikkun, we are creating meaning out of confusion, harmony from noise, revealing the unique part each creation plays in a universal symphony that sings of its Creator.\n\nThis is a deeper meaning of the term tikkun olam: The word olam also means hidden. We need to repair the world so that its Creator is no longer hidden within, but shines through each thing in magnificent, harmonious beauty.\n\nWhere have you seen an expression of tikkun olam? How have you seen small acts work towards repairing the world?\n\nUnderstanding of our history and the history of our countries\n\nDo you know your history in the tossed salad of cultures in your country? In the United States, have we melded into something generic that has lost all of its differences?\n\nMy favorite passage in the novel, which I will quote here in full, occurs as the group that has gathered at the hospital makes their way to Chona’s room after hearing Moshe’s howl.\n\n“The discourse on Doc Roberts was forgotten now as the group tromped forward, a ragtag assortment of travelers moving fifteen feet as if it were fifteen thousand miles, slow travelers, all, arrivals from different lands making a low trek through a country that claimed to be so high, a country that gave them so much yet demanded so much more. They moved slowly, like fusgeyers, wanderers seeking a home in Europe or erú West African tribesmen herded off a ship on a Virginia shore to peer back across the Atlantic in the direction of their homeland one last time, moving toward a common destiny all of them, Isaac, Nate, and the rest— into a future of American nothing. It was a future they couldn't quite see, where the richness of all they had brought to the great land of promise would one day be zapped into nothing, the glorious tapestry of their history boiled down to a series of ten-second TV commercials, empty holidays and sports games filled with the patriotic fluff of red, white, and blue, the celebrants cheering the accompanying dazzle without any idea of the horrible struggles and proud past of their forebears who had made their lives so easy. The collective history of this sad troop moving down the hospital corridor would become tiny blots in an American future that would one day scramble their proud histories like eggs, scattering them among the population while feeding mental junk to the populace in devices that would become as common and small as the hot dog that the dying woman thought she smelled; for in death, Chona had smelled not a hot dog but the future, a future in which devices that fit in one’s pocket and went zip, zap, and zilch delivered a danger far more seductive and powerful than any hot dog, a device that children of the future would clamor for and become addicted to, a device that fed them their oppression disguised as free thought.” page 225\n\nWhat an amazing description of individuals with their different joys and sorrows, their own stories, their unique challenges and efforts coming together in unity. This passage also expresses to me the individual stories of immigrants getting lost with time.\n\nIn his conversation on WHYY, McBride says,\n\n“What do you leave behind when you do that? And so what do you have when you fold into the whole?”\n\nThere are many amazing stories of what individuals and families brought to the United States, and to many other countries, of how they worked, how they traveled, how they raised families, how they lived.\n\nWhat stories do you know of the struggles your ancestors may have faced in moving to a new country? How do you share those stories to keep them present and resonant? What is lost and what is gained in the merging of cultures?"
