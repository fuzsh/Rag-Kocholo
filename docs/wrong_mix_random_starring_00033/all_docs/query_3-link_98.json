Before I jump into my favorite tools I wanted to share a sourcers perspective on what is meant by web 2.0. So, we all have heard the jibber jabber and buzz words of web 2.0, social media and the like. But what does it mean?\n\nI will start by saying that I am not technical, and by no means claim to be the expert from a development standpoint. In its very simplest form and for OUR purpose I will just say that Web 2.0 is technology and the thought that allows users to share, develop and collaborate on information. It is the “interactive web.” This is separate from social networking which is the offspring of the technology. (I know we have some techno buffs reading this and screaming as they read…I know this is a minimalist’s definition and barely scratches the surface.)\n\nSo here we are, the top 25 web 2.0 tools as I see it: *Item listed are listed because I use them and believe in them.\n\n(If reviews do not exist on this blog, they will over the next few weeks.)\n\nSocial Networking\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFacebook\n\nNing\n\nSearch Engines\n\nRollYo\n\nKWMap\n\nClusty\n\nTechnorati\n\nMiddleSpot\n\nMap Search\n\nGoogle Earth (Streets)\n\nPlatial Maps\n\nSticky Maps\n\nPhoto Sharing\n\nGoogle Images\n\nFlickr\n\nThere are thousands of web 2.0 base sites that are very useful. The sites above, are a sampling of what I like to keep handy in my toolbelt.\n\nBlogging Site\n\nTwitter\n\nWordPress\n\nTypePad\n\nVOIP and Chat\n\nJaxtr\n\nMeeBo\n\nSkype\n\nFile Sharing\n\nBoxnet\n\nSlideShare\n\nWiki\n\nVide Sharing\n\nVodPod\n\nYouTube\n\nVideoJug\n\nQuestions?
