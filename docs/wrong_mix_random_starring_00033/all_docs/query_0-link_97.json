        "text": "Everyone knows that most professional athletes make very good money in the prime of their respective careers. They get paid millions of dollars to do a job that they love—a job that most of us would do for free—and the adoration of throngs of fans is just an added bonus.\n\nIf things are that great when you're at work, it's no wonder that at some point coming home and watching Duck Dynasty reruns on a modestly-sized television loses its luster. Time away from your job is supposed to be better than time at your job, otherwise everything is out of whack.\n\nNow, if you hate your job with the burning intensity of 1,000 suns, pretty much any post-work activity is going to be a glorious respite from the grind. If wearing a beard of bees sounds more appealing than a day at the office, then you don't need a bunch of expensive toys to come home to.\n\nAthletes, on the other hand, do. The better the job, the better the toys need to be. The more money an athlete makes, the more lavish the toys need to be. The longer the career, the bigger the collection needs to be to keep his home life satisfying.\n\nConsidering former NBA great Allen Iverson has been reportedly broke for years, you have to think he'd like to have the money he blew on his many cars back. But at least he had his fun while it lasted.\n\nApparently Iverson put less than 3500 miles on the Hummer H1 Alpha HX before deciding to get rid of it—and we all know how well Hummers hold their value (they don't). He no longer owns the Escalade, and the status of the Bentley GT is unknown.\n\nWhen I first saw unemployed linebacker Bart Scott's ridiculously massive Koi pond that he had installed in the summer of 2012, I thought to myself how sad he's going to be in a few years for dumping who knows how much money into a giant novelty money-sucking machine.\n\nOn one hand, he's definitely going to regret this monstrosity at some point. On the other hand, he probably didn't actually pay full price for it—assuming he had to pay for it at all. I imagine those Tanked guys do plenty of high-profile work like this for free because of the publicity it receives.\n\nThat being said, that thing must cost a fortune in maintenance. Hopefully he's got a gig with ESPN lined up.\n\nGolfer Tiger Woods has been one of the highest paid athletes in the world for over a decade, so it isn't any wonder that he didn't think twice about dropping a cool $20 million on his mega-yacht named \"Privacy.\"\n\n[Insert exaggerated eye roll here]\n\nNote that the photos of the interior are not of Woods' specific craftobviously he's way too private for those to be released publicly. They are sample pictures of another 157-foot Christensen Trideck Motor Yacht, known as Hull 026.\n\nHonestly, with all the riches and luxury items he's got tucked away in and around his massive Florida mansion, Tiger Woods could probably fill an entire slideshow himself. The private jet, sports cars and vacation homes are all typical rich guy fare.\n\nHowever, his lumped out Buick golf cart doesn't come standard. Woods has a number of luxury golf carts like this, but he values his privacy so much that we have no way of knowing how many. Probably a billion...\n\nBlair is actually a magician—he managed to turn 50 pesos into $100K. Surrounding something with diamonds is the best way to increase its value! And as for his bedroom? Well...it certainly looks expensive. It also looks like a lot of that stuff can malfunction and would require a very high end electrician to fix it.\n\nAccording to Watson, he has \"loved the show forever\" and made a deal with his wife that if he ever won a golf tournament, she would let him get the car. Well, he won a few tournaments and clearly his wife is a woman of her word.\n\nThat's right. Panthers wide receiver Steve Smith has a Mercedes-Benz golf cart that probably cost him more than the price of your actual car that you drive on the actual road. He just uses this thing to get around the grounds of his massive home and the golf course it's likely built on.\n\nAccording to the Getty Images caption, this is a \"Casual portrait of Carolina Panthers Steve Smith riding custom Mercedes-Benz golf cart outside his house in N.C.\" Unfortunately, the photo is seven years old, which means this that thing is wicked outdated.\n\nMercedes recently released sketches of their new \"Vision Golf Cart,\" which is driven with a joystick and is powered by solar panels. And if that red cart cost more than your car, these new ones will cost more than five of your car. Smith needs to get on the horn and get with the times.\n\nSometimes I think that athletes exist mostly to make the rest of us feel bad about our lives. It's like…no matter how great your job is, you don't get to play basketball for a living.\n\nThat sweet raise you got last year? LeBron James probably has equal to that in loose change stuck in furniture cushions around his house.\n\nAnd your girlfriend may be easy on the eyes, but how does she stack up against Derek Jeter's flavor of the month? Probably not well—unless you happen to be a professional athlete too.\n\nNow check out Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo's arcade version of H20 Overdrive. I bet your crummy little XBox and/or PS (whatever number they're at now) are looking mighty lame right about now.\n\nRetired footballer David Beckham has got the need…the need…for speed. Shut up. Top Gun is awesome and if you don't like it, well then you're probably younger than me and I'm jealous.\n\nBack to Becks. This guy has got a massive car collection, but when he's in L.A. he's often spotted jetting around on his Confederate F131 Hellcat Combat motorcycle. Beckham also owns a couple of Ducati bikes but definitely favors the Hellcat for casual cruising.\n\nIf you're in the market for a Hellcat, I hope you've saved your pennies. A new one will set you back a minimum of $85K. I have no clue what the price is on the vintage number Beckham boasts.\n\nAmerican Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte's golden Gillette razors rank up there with Donald Trump's golden toilet in terms of being unconscionably useless.\n\nTo Lochte's credit, at least the razors were a gift from the company for which he is a spokesperson for—he didn't go out and buy these things.\n\nSo what the hell is Trump's excuse? Oh right...he's an idiot.\n\nOh man. Nobody tell Shaq that Rockets big man Dwight Howard is zipping around town in a custom-made three-wheeler with a Superman paint job.\n\nThe Superman Society (it exists) will never hear the end of it.\n\nIt's unclear how much that bad boy set Howard back, but something tells me it didn't come cheap. A top of the line three-wheeler can run over $10K—that's before all the custom bells an whistles.\n\nI have no clue how Knicks forward Kenyon Martin is living in New York, but I know he's livin' large in Texas during the offseason. He owns a palatial mansion, which is outfitted with everything you never thought you needed, but once you have, you can't live without!\n\nMartin's mansion has seven fireplaces, a two-bedroom guest house, two water slides, two elevators, a 10-car garage, bronze dolphin fountains, and multiple wet bars. It also features four private bowling alleys—because bowling is so much more awesome when you don't have to mingle with the common folks.\n\nPaul's son is rocking out on a state-of-the-art karaoke machine, right next to a big (more like huge) screen TV in his very own home theater. And his nephew has a Cadillac Power Wheel that must make him the envy of every kid in a 200-mile radius.\n\nA few years back, aging Yankees treasure Derek Jeter was featured in a Sports Illustrated slideshow entitled \"Athletes on Boats.\" However, for some reason, the photo was captioned with a blurb touting The Jeet's stats and career achievements.\n\nAbsolutely nothing about the glorious boat he's happily posing on. A Google search turned up evidence that Jeter actually does own a boat—perhaps even two boats. So I think it's safe to say this sailboat could very well be one of them.\n\nThunder big-man Kevin Durant actually owns (or has owned in the past) a number of luxury sports cars. His collection includes a Ferrari California, a Camaro SS with a custom matte red paint job and a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG—which resembles the Batmobile.\n\nYou can see all those by clicking here. But if you ask me, none of them even hold a candle to KD's badass '90s GMC van. In November 2010, he took his neighbor on an MTV Cribs style tour of the van. The resulting video was predictably hilarious.\n\nAfter struggling with search terms for awhile, I finally realized it was some sort of massage chair—which was very helpful. A few minutes of browsing later and voilà! It sure looks like an IB Wellness Inner Balance Wellness MC660 Zero Gravity Massage Chair. Wowza. That's a mouthful.\n\nI have no way of knowing if Clippers forward Matt Barnes actually owns these military grade assault rifles, or if he and the little lady are shooting someone else's military grade assault rifles at a gun range in California.\n\nNot that it matters either way. Barnes definitely has access to these guns. He seems to really enjoy playing with them. And they are most certainly very expensive. Which means they qualify as an expensive toy.\n\nBoom."
