        "text": "The Orlando Magic may not have to deal with Dwight Howard any longer, but that doesn’t mean the “Dwightmare” is over in the Sunshine State. Now a member of the Houston Rockets, the NBA superstar is poised to take a huge loss on his waterfront mansion-estate in Longwood, FL.\n\nHoward paid $7.78 million for the massive property shortly after inking a five-year, $80 million contract extension with the Magic in 2008. In an indication of just how crazy the real estate market was back then, he’s now offering the property for nearly $3 million less than what he originally paid — $4.9 million.\n\nKnown as “Chateau D’Usse,” Howard’s mansion was built in 2008 and has five bedrooms, including a palatial master suite, seven bathrooms, and a whopping 11,025 square feet of living space. No expense was spared inside the Gothic design, which boasts designer furniture, vaulted ceilings and a host of luxury finishes.\n\nA massive chef’s kitchen features high-end appliances and a separate food-prep area. A large family room with a two-sided fireplace leads to a separate man cave with a pool table and a wet bar. For the wine afficionado, a temperature wine room comes complete with a tasting area. And, for the movie buff, there’s a tiered screening room.\n\nOutside, the athlete’s resort-like setting boasts a generous covered patio with a fireplace and entertainment center. Venture further into the tropical grounds and you’ll find an outdoor kitchen, a fire pit and a covered lanai. Various sitting areas provide views of Rice Lake.\n\nThe backyard setting pales in comparison, however, to Howard’s pool, which has a sublime combination of waterfalls, a water slide, a swim-in grotto and the paradise patio pièce de résistance: the lazy river."
