In our search to identify 10 of Houston’s best neighborhoods, we’ve landed on 10 of Houston’s best houses, and what fol- lows is perhaps the last form of acceptable voyeurism. Whether a 20-car garage, 60,000-gallon pool, Moroccan- tiled bathroom, or Calacatta marble island is within reach is beside the point, so long as you can appreciate it. Not every property in these pages carries a multimillion-dollar price tag. Sometimes dream homes are the fanciest houses in the fanciest neighborhoods, sure (we’re looking at you, glass-walled show- piece of River Oaks); sometimes they’re just…cool. We lust after eccentric wallpaper and interesting lawn art as much as two-story, double-walled fireplaces and palatial vaulted ceilings. Sticker (or square-footage) shock aside,these 10 homes are,in their own ways, monuments to Houston’s finest neighborhoods. Some are inhabited; some are on the market; together, they make a striking collage of this sprawling, disparate, wonderful city of contrasts we collectively call home. And if you’ve got a house you love, in a place you do, too? Well, you’re already living the dream. --ABBY LEDOUX 04 / 2019 HOUSTONIA 33 SUGAR LAND RIVERCREST THE HEIGHTS DOWNTOWN RIVER OAKS Sweet RETREAT DRUM Clockwise from top right: 1.

PHOTOS THIS SPREAD AND PREVIOUS: Chapel-worthy picture windows, wrought-iron ANTHONY RATHBUN chandeliers, warm wooden arches, and custom-built balconies belie the fact that this entire home is brand- new. Decorator Micah Tipler cleverly mixes opulence (hello, regal formal dining room overlooking the pool) with kid-friendly swag. The mudroom has built-in cubbies for bags and shoes, and a “planning room” off the kitchen houses Chester and Oreo, the family’s guinea pigs. But you’d be hard-pressed to find a mess in this gala-ready home, where even the kids’ toy room transforms into a chic dessert-and-coffee area during parties, with ample storage space hidden in dark oak. The adjacent great room can fit a dance floor (they own one; it has its own special closet), and there’s a pub- style bar, hookah-filled game room, intimate card room, and “bunk-bed room” that can sleep at least six, because who wouldn’t need to crash after all that? The family often can be found in their sprawling kitchen with its two large islands. You might also catch them doing yoga in the gym, watching Netf- lix in the theater, or soaking in one of six luxurious washrooms—our favorite was the burgundy Moroccan stunner off the mudroom. “I spent two years combing through endless photos and project décor on Houzz,” Ponce de Leon admits. “It’s spectacular.

HOME is Where the Peacocks Are A CONTEMPORARY “SMART HOUSE” THAT HAS, WELL, EVERYTHING At first it seemed almost disingenuous to call this glittering marble-and-glass PHOTOS THIS SPREAD: TK IMAGES structure on 3.5 acres in the heart of Houston a home. Standing alongside the sparkling, 60,000-gallon, heated pool, it felt more like some posh island retreat. And that’s what the original owners, a family of four, were going for. “They wanted the place to be a showpiece,” says Sotheby’s realtor Susan Boss, “and to have the feel of all of their favorite resorts.” The $10.2 million, eight-bedroom residence is a clean-lined, contemporary wonder, the kind that has two kitchens in the main house—one for the family’s use, one for the caterers. As we stroll through the high-ceilinged space, examining the climate- controlled wine room (complete with cork flooring),the study with sliding-glass walls, the endless array of bathrooms and closets, and the server room that, Boss explains, is the nervous system of the fully loaded “smart house,” it’s hard to believe its original owners ever left for an afternoon—never mind moved away (they relocated for work). The property,deliberately built in the only neighborhood within city limits that allows residents to fence in the entire perimeter of their land, acts like a compound. While a planned indoor basketball court and 20-car garage have yet to be constructed,the place has nearly everything else, including a gym, a casita across from the pool, and a small “dog shower” tucked into the laundry room at the main house. There’s even wildlife. Back in the 1960s, a Rivercrest man brought in some peacocks, whose wings, supposedly, had been clipped. The moment he released them, though, the exotic birds proved that their wings still worked just fine. Their descendants have been roaming Rivercrest properties ever since. And as Boss tells us about them, we finally see this place for what it is. After all, a house is just a house, but a house frequented by wild peacocks? Sounds like a home. --DIANNA WRAY 36 HOUSTONIA 04 / 2019 THE WOODLANDS GARDEN OAKS/OAK FOREST MEMORIAL CRESTWOOD BOULEVARD OAKS 2. Clockwise from 6. 3. top left: 1.

After more than 30 home tours, they found it in this historic abode, renovated by HDT Builders in a project that doubled its size, making it more functional while preserving much of its charm—like many a remodel in the neighborhood. Five original wavy-glass French doors pour light into the converted formal sitting and dining areas, where restored hardwoods and period lighting meet Hanks’s modern pops of color in the cobalt front door and vibrantly wall- papered powder room. Where the new portion of the house begins, so does the expansive first-floor great room, where the family spends almost all their time—whether it’s eating at the T-shaped quartz island, playing pretend in the breakfast-nook-turned- kids’ kitchen, snuggling up on the plush den furniture, or hosting benefits for political candidates and musicians alike. Up a tucked-away staircase, past locally made stained glass and a giant portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the family reads bedtime stories before retiring to dinosaur- and mermaid-themed kids’ bedrooms and a tranquil master suite. Still, some of Hanks’s favorite aspects of the home are found outside its walls. The family added a deep brick patio to the lawn-art-and-toy-sprinkled front yard, where neighborhood kids and parents meet up and hang out. The home lies steps away from some of the area’s most-loved shops and restaurants, too. “We go to 19th Street all the time,” Hanks says. “We could spend the day grabbing a bite to eat, popping into Big Blue Whale, and maybe walking into the antiques shops. There’s always an excuse to go down there and just waste the day.” --LAURA FURR MERICAS 04 / 2019 HOUSTONIA 39 DOWNTOWN SUGAR LAND RIVERCREST THE HEIGHTS RIVER OAKS SuchGREAT HEIGHTS A DOWNTOWN PENTHOUSE WITH PLENTY OF PERKS A bout a year ago, John Ballis Jr. got beds to the dining area to the massive, walk- 4. tired of renting, so the 26-year-old in closet sits oriented toward the floor- real estate developer purchased a to-ceiling, south-facing windows.

People like the Ferraris. Two years ago John and Susan Ferrari traded their large home in Wilchester just west of the Beltway—the one they’d reno- vated and raised their children in—for a three-story custom build in this pocket paradise. A study in French country–chic, their new $2.4 million abode is stylish, cozy, and, best of all, manageable. The nucleus is the kitchen,where everyone gathers around the enormous white Calacatta marble island. Its ceiling is painted “Pepper- corn,” with reclaimed wooden beams that span that room and an open-concept living space, where glamour is found in a fur- covered ottoman or Chanel matchstick box; warmth in light that floods through gargan- tuan, black-grille windows; and comfort in stacks of textured rugs, a soft place for Dixie the Boykin spaniel to curl up. Everywhere there are European antiques sourced from local shops (Renouveau, Joyce Horn, Back Row Home) and during vacations to Italy. Susan is behind every inch of the inte- rior design, from the 12-foot ceilings to the white oak floors. “It’s just my passion,” she says. Her favorite space is the formal dining room, with its sliding wooden doors, Murano chandelier, and table for 10, though the family takes most meals outside, in the extension off the living room. Perhaps the most charming detail is found in a third-story bathroom, where the wall- paper reveals itself as not standard damask but whimsy itself: The elaborate flourishes and baroque motifs are actually playful, Texas- centric symbols—foot- balls, longhorns, oil rigs. Susan found it in New York, of all places, part of a series called “Yee Ha!” And in this home, where European flair meets Southern sensi- bility, the wallpaper’s shade couldn’t be more fitting: “Limestone Cowboy.” --AL 04 / 2019 HOUSTONIA 47 CRESTWOOD SUGAR LAND RIVERCREST THE HEIGHTS DOWNTOWN RIVER OAKS THE WOODLANDS GARDEN OAKS/OAK FOREST MEMORIAL BOULEVARD OAKS 1. 11,4S7i5zes:q. ft.

The space grows more modern—dare we say, elegant— as one ventures deeper into the open- plan living room and kitchen, scene of lavish events for as many as 300 guests, bolstered by the resources of a dedicated catering kitchen and sunken wine cellar off the main hall. O’Neill says he wanted to keep things restrained in style by eschew- ing elements like elaborate molding, but he’ll also admit to a penchant for chandeliers. It’s hard to miss the custom-made number in the living room, or the one above the soaking tub, itself strategically placed before a view of the secluded, Amazonian landscape beyond. You’ll also clock Farrow & Ball wallpaper throughout, along with ritzy essentials like a fully equipped gym, movie theater with stadium seating (and massage chairs), and third-floor mother-in-law suite complete with elevator access. As for the neighborhood? Crest- wood is a 350-home community just across the bayou from River Oaks. You’ll still get the private security, the movers and shakers, the natural beauty, and anything within reach of Memorial Drive. “To brush up to a 1,000-acre park with protected views—you’ll never see a high rise pop up across the way,” O’Neill assures us. “Plus, to get to a baseball game, it’s, like, five minutes. Five minutes!” --MK 48 HOUSTONIA 04 / 2019"
