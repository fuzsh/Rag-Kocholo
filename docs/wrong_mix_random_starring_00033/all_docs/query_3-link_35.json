AMST 103-01 The Problems of Race in US Social Thought and Policy MWF 01:10 pm-02:10 pm NEILL 217 Karin Aguilar-San Juan 0 / 16 *First Year Course only; first day attendance required* In this discussion-based and residential course, we will explore the hypothesis that 21st century racism has morphed from simple and evil formulations of bigotry and exploitation into decentralized and seemingly benign systems of cultural camouflage and ideological control. We will focus particularly on the ways that “structural” inequalities inform complex racial formations, and consequently, individual life chances. We will consider the idea that racism involves a “hidden curriculum” that is promoted by well-intentioned and highly educated people. Our interdisciplinary and integrative approach will employ multiple methods of inquiry and expression, including: self-reflective essays and maps; a scavenger hunt in the Twin Cities; library research; and deep, critical analysis of arguments about race/ethnicity/assimilation/multiculturalism. We will hone writing and speaking skills through highly structured assignments paired with open-ended conversations in order to discover the questions that truly matter to each of us. AMST 110-01 Introduction to African American Studies TR 03:00 pm-04:30 pm NEILL 110 Duchess Harris 5 / 25 *First day attendance required* AMST 194-01 Hunger Games M 07:00 pm-10:00 pm NEILL 213 Karin Aguilar-San Juan 0 / 20 *Permission of instructor required; first day attendance required* Did you love the books and hate the movies? Do you wonder what serious messages they carry? This course uses the youth-oriented Hunger Games dystopia as a platform for launching scholarly conversations about racism and heteropatriarchy, Reality TV, security and surveillance, environmentalism, violence, revolution, and the power of love. We will watch both films and read all three books in the first two weeks of the semester. Then we will take an interdisciplinary, hands-on approach to learning and teaching, that includes archery lessons, bread baking, role plays, and our own class blog. A major goal of the course is to open up our hearts and minds, and to discover more precisely what we hunger for—as scholars, gendered and racialized subjects, and human residents of the planet Earth. AMST 194-02 Asian America: A Social History W 07:00 pm-10:00 pm NEILL 212 Juliana Pegues -1 / 20 *First day attendance required; cross-listed with HIST 194-02* This course is an introduction to Asian American Studies, an interdisciplinary field of inquiry that studies how histories of immigration, exclusion, racial construction, and citizenship have shaped Asian American communities and identities. In turn, Asian American Studies asks how Asian Americans, configured as immigrants, refugees, “forever foreigners,” and “model minorities,” impact how American nation, empire, rights, and belonging are defined both discursively and materially. We will explore the history of Asian migration to the United States beginning in the 19th century and the ensuing debates over race, immigration, and citizenship that resulted. After examining the causes and consequences of the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, we examine the new waves of migration from Asia in the second half of the 20th century, Asian Americans and civil rights, and contemporary issues such as Asian American education and popular culture. Special attention will be given to ethnic and racial affinities and antagonisms, as well as how class, gender, and sexuality influence the historical and contemporary lives of Asian Americans. Class texts center the voices and ideas of everyday Asian Americans, including memoir, novels, graphic novels, and film. AMST 200-01 Critical Methods for American Studies Research TR 09:40 am-11:10 am NEILL 213 Jane Rhodes 8 / 20 *First day attendance required* This course will introduce students to the critical and intellectual underpinnings of research approaches in interdisciplinary scholarship. Fields like American Studies were founded, in part, to critique the canons and assumptions embedded in the disciplines. American Studies and Ethnic Studies scholars also insist that race, ethnicity, gender, class, and other categories of difference be in the forefront of the research agenda, and that researchers be cognizant of the role difference plays for the researcher, the subject under scrutiny, and the results. This course will consider these factors as you get hands-on experience with historical, field research and cultural studies approaches to scholarship. AMST 225-01 Native American History TR 01:20 pm-02:50 pm OLRI 170 Katrina Phillips 15 / 25 *Cross-listed with HIST 225-01* This course examines American Indian history to 1900, considering the complex and fraught history of the nation's indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this course argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline. Students will use primary and secondary sources to question this assumption and create a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience. AMST 240-01 Race, Culture and Ethnicity in Education M 07:00 pm-10:00 pm NEILL 216 Ann Hite -3 / 25 *Cross-listed with EDUC 240-01; first day attendance required* AMST 250-01 Race, Place and Space MWF 02:20 pm-03:20 pm OLRI 101 Karin Aguilar-San Juan 1 / 20 *Cross-listed with GEOG 250-01; first day attendance required* How do racial formations manifest in space and place? Through lecture and discussion, we will define what is spatial or “platial.” A discussion of visual culture will help us to engage the difficult practice of “looking” at race and space. Then we consider how race and racism operate at various levels of scale: women’s reproductive health (Dorothy Roberts, Killing the Black Body), urban renewal (“Detropia” and Detroit: An American Autopsy, by Charlie LeDuff), and the planet (“A Fierce Green Planet”). Prior exposure to American Studies, Urban Studies, or Environmental Studies will help ground you in this course. AMST 256-01 Transatlantic Slave Trade TR 09:40 am-11:10 am MAIN 002 Lynn Hudson 12 / 25 *Cross-listed with HIST 256-01* AMST 275-01 African American Literature to 1900 TR 01:20 pm-02:50 pm MAIN 009 Daylanne English 3 / 20 *Cross-listed with ENGL 275-01; first day attendance required* AMST 294-01 Lines in the Sand: The U.S. Mexico Borderlands MWF 01:10 pm-02:10 pm MAIN 009 Ryan Edgington 4 / 25 *Cross-listed with HIST 294-03* AMST 294-02 Immigration and Citizenship in American Political Development MWF 02:20 pm-03:20 pm CARN 206 Zornitsa Keremidchieva 1 / 25 *Cross-listed with POLI 208-01* AMST 300-01 Jr Civic Engagement Seminar TR 01:20 pm-02:50 pm NEILL 111 Duchess Harris 4 / 20 *Permission of instructor required; first day attendance required* This course examines the backlash against affirmative action in the late 1980s and early 1990s—just as courts, universities, and other institutions began to end affirmative action programs. We will learn how law professors of color created Critical Race Theory to resist a cautious approach to social transformation. These scholars favor a race conscious approach to transformation rather than liberalism's embrace of color blindness, and favor an approach that relies more on political organizing, in contrast to liberalism's reliance on rights-based remedies. We will read about Critical White Studies as the next step in Critical Race Theory. In focusing on whiteness, not only do theorists ask nonwhites to investigate more closely for what it means for others to be white, but also they invite whites to examine themselves more searchingly and to \"look behind the mirror.\" To balance out the course, we will end by reviewing Dan Subnotik’s text, “Toxic Diversity.” He analyzes the work of preeminent legal scholars such as Patricia Williams, Derrick Bell, Lani Guinier, and Richard Delgado, and argues that race and gender theorists divert the implementation of America's social justice agenda. In the elusive quest for racial justice, is equality enough, and if not, in the words of Toni Morrison, how can we race justice and engender power? AMST 308-01 Introduction to U.S. Latino/a Studies MWF 01:10 pm-02:10 pm NEILL 213 Alicia Munoz 0 / 15 *Cross-listed with HISP 308-01 and LATI 308-01; first day attendance required* AMST 330-01 Mellon Seminar W 12:00 pm-01:00 pm NEILL 113 Duchess Harris 3 / 10 *Must be one of the ten Mellon Fellows to register; first day attendance required; 2 credit course* AMST 334-01 Cultural Studies and the Media MWF 10:50 am-11:50 am NEILL 402 Leola Johnson 3 / 16 *Cross-listed with MCST 334-01* AMST 370-01 Understanding and Confronting Racism T 01:20 pm-04:30 pm OLRI 301 Kendrick Brown 5 / 18 *Cross-listed with PSYC 370-01*\n\ntop of page\n\nAnthropology\n\nNumber/Section/Name Days Time Room Instructor Avail./Max.

The course addresses questions related to the tension between remembering and forgetting, the presence of conflicting memories and truths and how these are negotiated or not through distinct forms of representation. The cultural analysis of different means of representation: human rights and truth commissions’ reports, testimonials, film, art and memorials will be the basis for class discussions on different notions of truth and different forms of truth-telling. A close examination of these forms of representation will reveal the extent to which they can conflict with each other while at the same time feed on each other, creating “effects of truth” and leaving room for secrecy as a mode of truth-telling. Finally, the course will also compel students to think about what consequences the politics of memory have for the future. This course will combine lectures and class discussions. It will have a strong writing component with a series of short papers and one longer final research paper. There will be one final exam. Grades will be based on written assignments in addition to oral presentations and participation in class discussions.\n\nANTH 206-01 Endangered/Minority Languages TR 01:20 pm-02:50 pm NEILL 217 Marianne Milligan 1 / 15 *Cross-listed with LING 206-01; total class limit is set for 15 instructor is looking for a mix of 5 seats Jr/Sr and 10 seats for Soph/FY* ANTH 230-01 Ethnographic Interviewing MWF 09:40 am-10:40 am CARN 05 Dianna Shandy 10 / 16 *First day attendance required; declared and intended Anthropology Major required* ANTH 239-01 Medical Anthropology TR 09:40 am-11:10 am CARN 06A Ron Barrett -6 / 30 *Counts towards Community and Global Health Concentration* ANTH 241-01 Anthropology of Death and Dying M 07:00 pm-10:00 pm Ron Barrett 6 / 15 *Permission of instructor required; course to meet in the Chapel* ANTH 248-01 Magic, Witchcraft and Religions MWF 10:50 am-11:50 am CARN 05 Anna Jacobsen 6 / 20 ANTH 258-01 Peoples and Cultures of Africa MWF 02:20 pm-03:20 pm CARN 06A Anna Jacobsen 13 / 20 ANTH 259-01 Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic MWF 09:40 am-10:40 am CARN 06B Scott Legge 5 / 24 *Cross-listed with ENVI 259-01* ANTH 280-01 Topics in Linguistic Anthropology MWF 10:50 am-11:50 am NEILL 212 Marianne Milligan 15 / 20 *Cross-listed with LING 280-01; no prerequisites* ANTH 362-01 Culture and Globalization W 07:00 pm-10:00 pm CARN 05 Dianna Shandy 5 / 20 *Cross-listed with INTL 362-01* ANTH 394-01 Introduction to Museum Studies TR 09:40 am-11:10 am NEILL 402 Gonzalez, Overman 8 / 25 *Cross-listed with ART 394-01 and CLAS 394-01* ANTH 487-01 Theory in Anthropology TR 03:00 pm-04:30 pm CARN 06A Ron Barrett 7 / 20\n\ntop of page\n\nArt and Art History\n\nNumber/Section/Name Days Time Room Instructor Avail./Max.

Students will learn different theoretical paradigms and techniques for visual analysis in order to understand how visual media inscribes power, difference, and desire as it mediates numerous social, economic, cultural and political relationships. We will investigate diverse types of visual culture through lectures, exhibitions, guest speakers, film, historical art and media and, of course, those proliferating images that define our daily experiences.\n\nNo prerequisites.\n\nART 160-01 Art of the West I MWF 12:00 pm-01:00 pm ARTCOM 102 Vanessa Rousseau 3 / 30 *Cross-listed with CLAS 160-01* ART 170-01 Art of the East I: China MWF 01:10 pm-02:10 pm ARTCOM 102 Kari Shepherdson-Scott -3 / 20 *Cross-listed with ASIA 170-01* ART 233-01 Introduction to Digital Photography MWF 12:00 pm-02:10 pm ART 301 Eric Carroll 1 / 16 *First day attendance required* ART 234-01 Painting I TR 01:20 pm-04:30 pm ART 308 Christine Willcox 4 / 15 *First day attendance required* ART 235-01 Sculpture I: Basic Sculpture with a Dose of Hot Metal TR 01:20 pm-04:30 pm ART 118 Stanton Sears 2 / 15 *Appropriate for freshmen and incoming first year students* We begin with an exploration of the nature of vision, creating life-size clay portrait heads of a partner. We move on to an exploration of the tools and processes available in the new sculpture studio, including woodworking tools for both carving and fabrication. Sculpture I introduces students to cast metal work in our new foundry, where we will learn a lost wax ceramic shell casting system. The range of form which can be explored is infinite and starts with a wax form which is eventually replaced with the 2100 degree bronze. Like my other course offerings, Sculpture I will include an off-site project that includes a class trip to my farm/studio in western Wisconsin.\n\nART 236-01 Printmaking I TR 01:20 pm-04:30 pm ART 214 Ruthann Godollei 3 / 15 *First day attendance required* ART 239-01 2-D Design MWF 02:20 pm-04:30 pm ART 301 Eric Carroll 0 / 16 ART 294-01 Art and the American Culture Wars TR 09:40 am-11:10 am ARTCOM 102 Lauren DeLand 15 / 25 *Cross-listed with WGSS 294-03* This course surveys the American “Culture Wars” as played out on the intersecting fields of art, visual culture, and politics. Students will focus intensively on a period encompassing the late 1980s to the early twenty-first century as a fever point in public debates over censorship, expression, and the relationship between art and public money. The class will also challenge this periodization by analyzing the ways in which the reverberations of the events that transpired over this time impact the contemporary art landscape in America today. Through critical analysis of works of art, art historical texts, and primary sources, students will consider the ways in which broader social debates about the ideal relationship of the individual to the state manifested in the art and visual culture of this period, as well as legislative responses to these works. ART 294-02 Art and Technology MWF 02:20 pm-03:20 pm ARTCOM 102 Lauren DeLand 12 / 20 *Cross-listed with MCST 294-02* This course provides students with the theoretical frameworks necessary to understand the intertwined histories of performance art, video, digital media, and art that intersects with the biological sciences. Students will consider simultaneously the reasons why these histories are typically fragmented and presented in isolation from one another, and thus investigate recent historical shifts in cultural definitions of “art.” Students will examine works of art, art historical texts, and theoretical texts and learn to read them in concert with one another. Students will consider technological developments in terms of the artworks they make possible, as well as the influence these developments have on broader concepts of life, culture, and what it means to be human. ART 294-03 Art and Power: World War I and Inflicted traumas TR 09:40 am-11:10 am ARTCOM 202 Vicky Karaiskou -2 / 20 *Cross-listed with POLI 294-02. This course counts for fine arts general distribution if registered as ART and social science general distribution if registered as POLI* The course will examine art as a potent means to establish political power and shape social notions. In particular it will approach modernity in the beginning of the 20th century as a revolt against the values established by the ‘old regime’ and its arts. In order to set the frame for the relationships between art and power, the course will call upon distinct artworks and artistic expressions from Greek-roman antiquity, the medieval era, renaissance, baroque and neoclassicism and will analyse their role in propagating political and social order. Having set that frame, the course will highlight especially artistic trends of the first thirty years of the 20th century that include the years of World War I. Visual artworks and writings will be explored as the result of an urgent need to reject the pre-existing cultural memory which was regarded as the cause for modern society’s traumatic experiences. The course will examine expressionism, dada and surrealism as illustrations of individual and social traumas resulting both from the despair of WW I and the disintegration of the pre-existing social and moral/social value-system. We will approach futurism as an attempt to erase past memory and create a new individual and social awareness. The course ends with an examination of art’s political and social context as expressed through Russian avant-garde. ART 294-04 Roman Art TR 03:00 pm-04:30 pm ARTCOM 102 Vanessa Rousseau 21 / 25 *Cross-listed with CLAS 294-01* In this course we will explore the art and archaeology of the Roman empire from its beginnings to the fourth century C.E. We will consider what art and architecture reveal about Roman cultural ideologies, including the use of images and building programs to define political agendas, the roles and representation of women and freedmen, funerary beliefs, and the relationship of the Roman center with its diverse populations in other parts of the empire. We will also look beyond the original stories of artworks to explore their contemporary histories, including the antiquities trade and the effects of social and political events on the world’s cultural heritage. Research projects may involve provenance research, including working with primary source documents confiscated during investigations into the illegal trafficking of antiquities, allowing students to do original research and participate in the process of finding solutions to this global problem.\n\nART 334-01 Figure Painting TR 08:00 am-11:10 am ART 202 Christine Willcox 7 / 10 *First day attendance required* ART 367-01 3-D Design: Structures and the Built Environment TR 08:00 am-11:10 am ART 118 Stanton Sears 11 / 15 *Appropriate for freshmen and incoming first year students* We are surrounded by three dimensional design; from the architecture of our built environment to the tools and objects that surround us, to the human-altered landforms and plantings of our larger environment. All of these elements can be considered and affected by design choices which we make. In the class we build structures which can be considered from structural, aesthetic, and functional points of view. Some of these projects are built to very specific parameters so that trade offs can be observed and measured. We smash a lot of things, but learn a lot about problem solving along the way. The course includes a field trip to my farm/studio in western Wisconsin where we install a large site specific project. Past projects have included a collaboratively-built ninety-three foot long illuminated lantern across the pastures, as well as a series of kinetic structures. The food is great too.\n\nART 370-01 Drawing II: Mixed Media and Idea Development MW 01:10 pm-04:20 pm ART 206 Megan Vossler 3 / 10 *Prerequisite of Drawing I or permission of the instructor required* ART 373-01 Printmaking II TR TBA ART 214 Ruthann Godollei -2 / 6 *Permission of the instructor required; first day attendance required* ART 374-01 Ceramic Art II MWF 02:20 pm-04:20 pm ART 113 Gary Erickson -1 / 5 *Permission of instructor required; first day attendance required; $100 material fee* ART 394-01 Introduction to Museum Studies TR 09:40 am-11:10 am NEILL 402 Gonzalez, Overman 8 / 25 *Cross-listed with ANTH 394-01 and CLAS 394-01*\n\ntop of page\n\nAsian Languages and Cultures\n\nNumber/Section/Name Days Time Room Instructor Avail./Max.

Male characters in Japanese animation often use boku or ore to refer to themselves, while female characters often use watashi or atashi. When translated into Japanese, Hermione Granger (a female character in Harry Potter series) ends sentences with soft-sounding forms, while Harry Potter and his best friend Ron use more assertive forms. Do these fictional representations reflect reality? How did gendered language come about? Are Japanese women and men always expected to sound feminine/masculine? How do people who do not align their identity with femininity or masculinity deal with gendered forms? These are some of the questions discussed in this course.

We will explore animal evolution and focus on the biology of creatures such as jellyfish, insects, starfish, spiders, and corals. In addition, we will discuss the cultural role of animals as curiosities – as specimens in cabinets and museums, or the subjects of phobias and urban legends – and the history and significance of the visual arts in zoology. Drawing on topics in marine biology and entomology, students will learn about the ecology, life cycles, and anatomy of major groups of animals through lectures, observation of live animals, and dissections. Two 1-hour lectures and one 1-hour lab per week. We will take several field trips outside of class time to Macalester’s field station and local natural history and art museums – these will be scheduled to ensure that every student can participate in at least two excursions. This course is appropriate for biology majors and non-majors alike, but it is not part of the biology major’s required core curriculum.\n\nBIOL 194-02 Bodies on Fire: Inflammatory Diseases of the 21st Century TR 09:40 am-11:10 am OLRI 205 Devavani Chatterjea 0 / 16 *First Year Course only; first day attendance required* Complex cascades of inflammation orchestrate our bodies' response to our environment. Inflammation (der. ignition; setting alight) resolves infections, heals wounds, and restores internal balance to the body. However, these same inflammatory responses, when uncontrolled, can destroy the body with frightening rapidity. Diabetes, obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, allergies and asthma, neuro-degenerative conditions, pain and depression are some of the most pervasive and confounding health challenges that confront the global population today. Chronic inflammation underlies all of these diverse pathologies. In this course, you will be introduced to the beautifully elaborate world of the immune system through lectures, discussions and critical reading of scientific and popular texts on the global pandemic of inflammatory non-communicable diseases. You will have opportunities to share ideas through reflective and analytical writing, oral presentations with additional possibilities for art and community-engagement projects.

CHEM 111-01 General Chemistry I: Structure and Equilibrium MWF 08:30 am-09:30 am OLRI 301 Kathryn Splan 0 / 16 *First Year Course only; first day attendance required* This course, along with General Chemistry II (CHEM 112), which is typically taken in the spring semester of the first year, together satisfy the prerequisites for Organic (CHEM 211) and Analytical (CHEM 222) Chemistry. General Chemistry I offers a rigorous, foundational treatment of atoms and molecules. We study the nature of chemical bonding and how bonding gives rise to the three-dimensional structure of matter. We explore how the macroscopic properties of substances can be interpreted in terms of atomic and molecular structure. We also learn mathematical and conceptual tools for quantifying chemical equilibrium, with an emphasis on the reactions of acids and bases. Laboratory work reinforces concepts in lecture, and also provides a review of fundamental topics, such as stoichiometry, gas laws, and solution-phase reactions, that are essential for future course work in chemistry. Writing is another important part of this course. Writing assignments will include both formal reports on laboratory work and a research paper due at the end of the semester. Students planning to enroll in this course should have taken one year of chemistry in high school, and should already be familiar with topics like nomenclature, oxidation states, stoichiometry (including balancing chemical equations and calculating solution concentrations), and simple chemical reactions in solution.

From Orpheus and Eurydice to the Roman emperor Nero, from Renaissance Europe to 20th century Broadway, figures of classical antiquity have found vibrant musical afterlives. In this course we will examine the connection between the classical ideas and their subsequent musical renderings. Course time will be divided between reading the Greek and Roman material in its original context and listening to the operas and musicals that treat it. We will develop skills in formal speaking, argumentative writing, critical reading and analytical listening, while examining a variety of aesthetic and socio-political issues that accompany the scholarly study of these genres. We’ll plan to attend a musical performance or two in the Twin Cities and meet with local singers experienced in operatic productions. A few examples of our likely foci include Ariadne (Hesiod, Catullus, Strauss), Orpheus (Pindar, Apollodorus, Gluck) Odysseus (Homer, Monteverdi, Berlioz), Dido and Aeneas (Vergil, Purcell), Elektra (Sophocles, Strauss), Hades and Persephone (Hesiod, Homeric Hymns, Stravinsky), Alcestis (Euripides, Gluck), Julius Caesar (Caesar, Cicero, Suetonius, Handel), Titus (Josephus, Suetonius, Cassius Dio, Mozart) and Nero (Tacitus, Suetonius, Seneca, Monteverdi, Handel).

We will also look beyond the original stories of artworks to explore their contemporary histories, including the antiquities trade and the effects of social and political events on the world’s cultural heritage. Research projects may involve provenance research, including working with primary source documents confiscated during investigations into the illegal trafficking of antiquities, allowing students to do original research and participate in the process of finding solutions to this global problem.\n\nCLAS 294-02 Medieval Political Thought MWF 09:40 am-10:40 am CARN 06A Andrew Latham 1 / 26 *Cross-listed with PHIL 294-02 and POLI 266-01* Interested in the roots of contemporary political life (including issues such as state sovereignty, separation of church and state, constitutionalism, just war, property rights, “the people”, nationalism, democracy, rule-of-law, and human rights)? Then this course is for you. Through a careful examination of the political thought of Latin Christendom (Western Europe) during the later Middle Ages (c. 1050-c. 1550) we explore the deep roots of the contemporary world order, demonstrating the ways in which medieval thinkers such as St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, John of Salisbury, John of Paris, Giles of Rome, Marsilius of Padua, Dante, Las Casas, ibn Sina, Moshe ben Maimon, and ibn Rushd “invented” many of the ideas that we – presumptuously and erroneously – have come to associate with the modern era. As an intermediate-level offering, this course is designed primarily for Political Science majors and non-majors in cognate fields (such as Philosophy or Classics) who have some experience in the discipline. The course has no pre-requisites, however, and is therefore suitable for all students seeking to satisfy an interest in political theory/philosophy or the medieval roots of contemporary political life. This course fulfills the Political Science Department’s Theory Requirement. CLAS 345-01 Arabic Reading and Translation MWF 03:30 pm-04:30 pm MAIN 111 Gregory Lipton 9 / 15 Cross-listed with RELI 245-01* This course aims to improve your Arabic reading and translation skills while introducing you to selected genres of Arabic and Islamic literature. The course will proceed in a workshop format and focus on the comprehension and translation of texts in question. Students will learn to use an Arabic dictionary, expand their vocabulary, deepen their understanding of grammar and syntax, and develop skills in reading manuscripts, navigating Arabic texts, and producing English translations. Prerequisite: 3 previous semesters of Arabic language. CLAS 394-01 Introduction to Museum Studies TR 09:40 am-11:10 am NEILL 402 Gonzalez, Overman 8 / 25 *Cross-listed with ANTH 394-01 and ART 394-01* Museum studies stands at the confluence of a range of critical topics that span cultural, ethical, and legal questions concerning ownership, provenience, cultural rights, and preservation of sites and remains, to name but a few. Museum Studies also directly engages the science and the practice of running Museums, and laboratory work of a wide range: preservation and conservation, curatorial practices, and the identification of art and artifacts from a wide range of periods. Museum studies is a field of work and intellectual endeavor that is inherently interdisciplinary, and is a dynamic reflection of the liberal arts at work. This course will use a team approach.\n\nIntroduction to Museum Studies offered in fall 2014 will be team taught by Profs. Gonzalez and Overman. The bigger team that planned and wrote the course will also participate by offering select classes or units within the broader Introduction.\n\nThe outline of the course is based on the usual departments found in most Museums. The larger units are:\n\n1. Collections\n\n2. Conservation\n\n3. Curating\n\n4. Funding and Management\n\n5. Education, Outreach, Visitorship\n\n6. Summary and Conclusion: Post Museum Studies\n\nThis course will take advantage of the state-of-the-art facilities in the Janet Wallace Fine and Performing Arts Center, and of the museums and labs in the Twin Cities.

In the first half, we will take a close look at ethical issues predating the Internet but which, because of its development, have taken on new dimensions. We will consider how the Internet opens up new forms of censorship (think the censorship of social networking services themselves); new forms of surveillance (think dataveillance), and new issues related to privacy (think the controversial “right to be forgotten”). We will also look at the moral values undergirding, and the contentious debates surrounding, current copyright law in the US. In the second half of the course, we will consider some ethical questions connected to the integration of the Internet into devices other than the personal computer and mobile phone, developments that open up the prospect of a world of “ubiquitous computing” or integrated networked systems. What are some of the impacts of such integration on our everyday ethical relations with others and on the overall quality of our lives? How might being networked affect the meaning of being human?\n\nThis course is also designed to give you a broad exposure into different ways of “doing philosophy,” from blogging, podcasting, and writing essays for public media to more traditional forms of expressions such as journal articles and books. On occasion we will join forces with another First Year Course--Information Policy, Politics, and Law--taught by Political Science professor Patrick Schmidt. You’ll have many opportunities to write, including a major paper in which you imagine yourself as a philosophical consultant providing ethical perspectives and advice to designers interested in developing a new “smart” device or social media platform.\n\nCOMP 221-01 Algorithm Design and Analysis MWF 02:20 pm-03:20 pm OLRI 205 Susan Fox -2 / 28 *ACTC students may register on September 2 with permission of the instructor* COMP 221-02 Algorithm Design and Analysis MWF 01:10 pm-02:10 pm OLRI 205 Susan Fox -2 / 28 COMP 240-01 Computer Systems Organization TR 01:20 pm-02:50 pm OLRI 245 Elizabeth Shoop -2 / 16 *ACTC students may register on September 2 with permission of the instructor* COMP 240-02 Computer Systems Organization TR 09:40 am-11:10 am OLRI 256 Elizabeth Shoop 0 / 16 COMP 346-01 Internet Computing MWF 10:50 am-11:50 am OLRI 245 Bret Jackson -1 / 24 *ACTC students may register on September 2 with permission of the instructor* COMP 484-01 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence MWF 03:30 pm-04:30 pm OLRI 241 Susan Fox -2 / 30 *Permission of instructor required; cross-listed with NEUR 484-01; ACTC students may register on September 2 with permission of the instructor* COMP 490-01 Senior Capstone Seminar MW 12:00 pm-01:00 pm OLRI 205 Fox, Shoop 1 / 24 *2 credit course; ACTC students may register on September 2 with permission of the instructor*\n\ntop of page\n\nEconomics\n\nNumber/Section/Name Days Time Room Instructor Avail./Max.

It uses concepts and models developed in Principles of Economics to explore how the interplay between geography, institutions, and technology has influenced material living standards from the Stone Age to the present. In particular, we will study the causes and consequences of long-term structural forces such as the agriculture, industrial and informational revolutions, the Malthusian trap and demographic transition, slavery, globalization, and the rise of government. We will also explore more cyclical phenomena such as wars, financial crises, economic depressions and hyper-inflations. Students will learn how economic historians use evidence to make sense of the past and the role economic history plays in guiding current policy debates. Prerequisite: ECON 119.

It will contain six modules. First we will study climate change science, including the greenhouse effect, the carbon cycle, the climate system, and feedbacks that amplify or dampen changes to these systems. Second, we will cover topics from environmental economics, including market efficiency, externalities, public goods, growth, and discounting, specifically as they apply to climate change. Next, we will explore models used for understanding and predicting climate, including basic 1 and 2-dimensional models as well as more complex 3D models and Global Circulation Models (GCMs). The module will then combine these topics in an exploration of what impacts, natural and economic, are predicted by climate models for the near (100 year) future. Fourth, we will explore policy interventions for the reduction in greenhouse gases, including carbon taxes and cap and trade, and other regulation such as that taking place under the U.S. Clean Air Act. Where relevant we will discuss the successes and failures of these systems as they have been applied to date. We will also discuss the costs and benefits of subsidizing renewable energy and carbon-free energy sources and the costs of negative impacts of climate change on human and natural systems. Fifth, we will discuss the wide array of technological solutions that have been proposed to slow, stop or even reverse climate change. These range from things that are now common (wind turbines) to things that are gaining in popularity (geothermal) to the truly esoteric (mirrors in space). The final module will show how the preceding topics factor into Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). Governments and NGOs use these models to combine scientific and socioeconomic information in order to predict the outcomes of various climate and policy scenarios. These are the state of the art in climate science, economics and policy; students will be exposed to several of the most commonly used models and to research from their critics.\n\nWhile the course will have substantial quantitative content, its only prerequisite is ECON 119: Principles of Economics, and we hope to attract a diverse group of students of varying academic and personal experience.\n\nECON 294-03 Trading and Investment TR 09:40 am-11:10 am NEILL 112 Lee Jacobsohn 5 / 20 This course will focus on investing and trading in financial markets. Trading topics will explore various trading strategies, styles, and tools, market mechanics and history. Investment topics will include formulating investment portfolio strategies, risk & return, asset allocation, diversification, performance measurement and investment vehicles and the proliferation of hedge funds. Students will participate in trading simulations and create and track their own trading strategies throughout the semester. Guest speakers will include a hedge fund manager and an investment portfolio manager. Students will gain a working knowledge of trading in financial markets and the management of an investment portfolio. This course will count toward the Group B elective for the major.

We will consider questions such as: What are the social, political, economic and ideological foundations that shape approaches to international development? Given historical, cultural and economic inequities, how might we build trust and confidence among people working within the context of unequal power dynamics? How are educators in developing countries best supported as they work towards positive change, and what lessons might be gleaned to guide education reform in the U.S. and other ‘developed’ countries?

We will read a range of texts to ask, What constitutes a vital literary tradition? What’s its range? Who does it include? And whom it serves? We examine literary texts produced through grassroots publishing efforts, in English and Spanish translations. We read Chicana/o cultural theory texts that address issues of race and indigenism, class, citizenship, the status of migrant workers, border crossings, gender and sexuality. We examine experimental and cross-genre writing in relation to the role aesthetics plays in the way we read texts. We will examine a range of genres, from experimental to commercial fiction, ethnography and folklore, poetry, comedy stand-up and performance art, plays and films. We reflect on how these authors re-invent and re-imagine stories based on traditional myths as well as the more recent forces of oppression that affect Chicana/o communities. Our writing will be an experiment, too. Assignments include short writing exercises performed in class that build toward two eight-page, literary analysis papers. Authors include: Sandra Cisneros, Helena Viramontes, Tomás Rivera, Americo Paredes, George Lopez, Josefina Lopez, Lorraine Lopez, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. ENGL 135-01 Poetry and the Gods MWF 10:50 am-11:50 am MAIN 111 Theresa Krier 4 / 20 This term the English Department’s regular introduction to poetry organizes itself around poetry's ancient relationship to mythology. What does poetry make of deities and numinous beings from Greece, Rome, Africa, India, North America; underworlds and paradises, fertility and nature spirits, hymns, invocations, spells, blessings, chants; human longings, rejections, nostalgia, ecstasies, skepticism, and celebration of divine forces? What is it about such spirits and stories that enliven the reach and resources of poetic languages? This course aims to make its participants into resourceful, creative readers and listeners of poetry, mastering skills that will allow intimacy with a living, changing art. We read contemporary works and very old works, poems from English-speaking cultures as well as translated poems from other cultures, experimental work as well as tried-and-true forms. We consider different ways of writing about poetry and using poetry: descriptive essay, book review, annotation, argument, personal memoir, among others. No prior experience required; no prerequisites; non-majors welcome. For English majors this course fulfills the requirement for a foundation course. ENGL 150-01 Introduction to Creative Writing MWF 03:30 pm-04:30 pm MAIN 001 Kristin Naca 0 / 16 *First Year Course only* This course introduces students to the study of technique, convention, form and genre that engrosses writers of literary texts. Student writers engage in analysis of model literary works and frequent writing exercises that lead to longer - more complex and polished - pieces. We also practice dissecting student writing in workshop and learn how to provide the kinds of feedback that lead to meaningful revisions. Our goal is to inspire greater risks and experimentation in each other’s writing through rigorous yet compassionate dialogue.\n\nThrough writing exercises, students learn to engage the reader’s senses by gaining fluency with concrete language. Through discussion of prose and poetry arguments, student writers learn what shapes persuade the reader to reflect on life experience. Typically, we read one collection of short stories, one collection of poetry, and one book on writing conventions and process—all by contemporary authors.\n\nENGL 150-02 Introduction to Creative Writing MWF 09:40 am-10:40 am MAIN 009 Peter Bognanni 0 / 16 *First day attendance required* ENGL 150-03 Introduction to Creative Writing TR 09:40 am-11:10 am NEILL 217 Ping Wang 1 / 16 ENGL 150-04 Introduction to Creative Writing TR 09:40 am-11:10 am OLRI 170 Marlon James 0 / 16 *First day attendance required* Prose.

The British Empire was expanding, and new and more sophisticated communications and travel technologies brought hitherto isolated regions and communities into mutual awareness and interchange. Raymond Williams has suggested that novels traditionally show their readers “knowable communities,” but how do they so in an age of global community? At a certain point, does the world become too big and too complicated to be fully understood or represented? This was a question many Victorian writers were asking themselves, contemplating the limits of individual comprehension; as George Eliot cautioned, “To shift one’s point of view beyond certain limits is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble understanding — it is possible they see hardly anything in us.”\n\nIn this class, we will read British texts of the nineteenth century that struggle to represent the emerging sense of global interconnectedness, including The Secret Garden, Dracula, Wilkie Collins’ The Moonstone (the first detective novel), and adventure fiction by H. Rider Haggard. We will consider how these texts represent the structures of power and domination that constituted Britain’s relationship with the rest of the world, how they depict the consequences of a global community for life at home, and how they understand “home.”\n\nENGL 273-01 American Literature 1900-1945 TR 09:40 am-11:10 am MAIN 003 James Dawes 0 / 20 This course will examine several landmark novels in American literary modernism. We will first examine these texts as aesthetic achievements with specific formal requirements. What are the hidden structures that make up a novel? How do authors produce beautiful effects at the level of line and paragraph? How do they use these small beautiful effects (a phrase that jars the reader into seeing the world anew, a paragraph that has the delicate structure of a stanza) to develop the larger themes of the work as a whole? We will also consider questions of cultural production and political and ethical consequence. How do codes of race, class, and gender function in these texts? How do social systems (manners, language, employment structures) detract from or contribute to the promotion of human dignity? How is the reader changed by the act of reading? We will pay special attention to questions of beauty, humor, cognition, power, epistemology, the grotesque, narrative theory, ideology, urbanization, aesthetics, and ethics. The class will engage in intensive readings of individual texts, but will also seek to examine the larger backgrounds of American literary and cultural history. Authors of special attention may include William Faulkner, Willa Cather, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Zora Neale Hurston.

Topics include political struggles over access to literacy; the creation of the King James Bible; dissenters’ traditions of biblical reading; constant issues of enslavement, freedom, and empire. We’ll give time to the biblical genres most dynamic in English fiction, drama, oratory, and poetry: cosmogony, ancestor stories, folk tales, prophecy, love poetry, prayer, proverb, philosophical poetry, parables, biography, letters, and testimony. We’ll survey the shape of the whole English Bible, but focus on Genesis, Exodus, the stories of David and Solomon, the prophetic books Isaiah and Hosea, the Song of Songs, Job, Psalms, the Wisdom books, the Gospel of Luke, 1 Corinthians, the Book of Revelation, nativity stories, angel stories, stories of women. We’ll focus on the strongest creative responses to the Bible – sometimes adversarial, sometimes comic – through our main English texts: modern-English tales from Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the anonymous comedy The Second Shepherds’ Play, literary versions of the Nativity and Passion accounts from the Gospels, Shakespeare’s King Lear and excerpts from other Shakespeare plays, excerpts from Spenser’s Faerie Queene and Milton’s Paradise Lost, Blake’s Songs of Innocence and Experience. We’ll view Bill Viola’s great video sequence The Passions and hear music from Bach, Bernstein, and Handel to Bono and Bob Marley. ENGL 294-02 Comparative Feminisms: Whiteness and Postcolonialisms MWF 02:20 pm-03:20 pm MAIN 009 Sonita Sarker 7 / 25 *Cross-listed with WGSS 240-01* ENGL 308-01 Literature/Sexuality: Wilde, Warhol, Waters: Queer Aesthetes and Outlaws TR 09:40 am-11:10 am THEATR 205 Casey Jarrin 5 / 20 *Cross-listed with WGSS 308-01; permission of the instructor required; first day attendance required* Oscar Wilde, Andy Warhol, John Waters AND Claude Cahun, David Bowie, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Quentin Crisp, William S. Burroughs, Fran Leibowitz, Morrissey. Dandies, aesthetes, chameleonic artists, writers, innovators, iconoclasts, masters of the pose, flaneurs, raconteurs, visionary voyeurs, celebrity culture connoisseurs, queer heroes and outlaws, pop icons. We’ll begin with the public and private faces of Wilde: Irish-born, Trinity and Oxford educated, aspiring philosopher, Woman’s World editor, London playboy, literary celebrity, prisoner and exile. We’ll encounter his early poems and reviews, aesthetic lectures (on art, style, interior design, diva culture), essays (“House Beautiful,” “Truth of Masks,” “Decay of Lying,” “Critic As Artist”), key plays (Importance of Being Earnest, Salome), notorious “novel” (Picture of Dorian Gray), prison poem (Ballad of Reading Gaol), posthumously published letter to his estranged lover (De Profundis). How did Wilde link autobiography with artifice? Life and lifestyle with art? Plagiarism with originality? We’ll contextualize Wilde’s body of work at the intersection of fin-de-siècle aesthetics and sexual politics (Aestheticism, Dandyism, rise of the New Woman), and view his struggles against censorship, criminalization of homosexuality, and the Victorian prison as pivotal steps towards queer liberation movements of the 20th century.\n\nWe’ll then turn to the paintings, films, and autobiographical writings of Pittsburgh-born Andy Warhol: iconic silkscreens of commodity and celebrity culture (soup cans, Marilyn, Jackie O, Liz, Elvis, Mao, Christ), Death in America series (crime scenes, electric chairs, mushroom clouds), censored Thirteen Most Wanted Men mural, diaries, pop culture magazine (Interview), brief foray into reality television (Andy Warhol’s TV, Warhol’s Fifteen Minutes for MTV). How did Warhol’s Factory link industry, advertising, high art, pornography, street life, junkies, dandies, and the cult of personality known as celebrity? How do Warhol’s films (silent Screen Tests; Haircut, Eat, Sleep, Kiss, Empire; Trash / Flesh / Heat trilogy) and cult films of Baltimore native John Waters (Pink Flamingoes; Female Trouble) perform gender, sex(uality), desire? Fuse the beautiful with the grotesque? Embody camp or cultural kitch? Throughout, we’ll look at contemporaneous artists (Aubrey Beardsley, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, Cindy Sherman, Adrian Piper, Keith Haring, Alexander McQueen), filmmakers (Kenneth Anger, Jean Genet, Paul Morrissey, Derek Jarman, Sally Potter, Isaac Julien, Todd Haynes), musicians (Lou Reed/Velvet Underground, Bowie, Blondie, Smiths/Morrissey, Grace Jones, Rufus Wainwright, Prince, Hahn-Bin, Peaches, Lady Gaga, Janelle Monae), choreographer Matthew Bourne, Olympian Johnny Weir, dandies (Quentin Crisp, Betty Bourne, Fran Leibowitz), cultural theorists (Susan Sontag, Leo Ber ENGL 310-01 Shakespeare Studies: Unruly Women, Agency, and Resistance MWF 01:10 pm-02:10 pm MAIN 111 Theresa Krier 4 / 20 In Shakespeare's time monarchs, governors, ethicists, churchmen, schoolmasters, fathers, husbands, and aristocrats spoke in discourses of control, authority, order, and the divine establishment of patriarchy. But they did so partly in response to their strong-willed queen Elizabeth, who refused to wed and refused to bear children. Shakespeare's is in fact an age of rebellion, revolt, transgression, mockery, cross-dressing, witchcraft, misrule, insubordination, and generally rumbustious forms of life and literature. This course studies those forms, with focus on his women characters. Through them we'll ponder creative agency, resistance, power, and the relations of all these to dramatic genres. Works may include A Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, Much Ado about Nothing, Measure for Measure, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Antony & Cleopatra, The Winter's Tale, Coriolanus, Venus & Adonis, and scenes from The Taming of the Shrew, Othello, Richard III, 1 Henry VI. ENGL 331-01 The Brontes TR 09:40 am-11:10 am NEILL 227 Lesley Goodman 4 / 20 *First day attendance required* “I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will.” – Charlotte Brontë\n\nFor the Victorians, the Brontë sisters were mysterious and fascinating figures. Their novels were considered shocking, even monstrous, and anything but ladylike in their depiction of the heights and depths of human passion, but the sisters themselves were demure, had lived lonely, isolated lives, and seemed to shy away from attention or scrutiny. Their works never quite seemed to fit the standards and conventions of nineteenth-century readers, but they’ve become some of the mostly wide read and adapted novels of that period, especially Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. In this class, we will read works by Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë, including Jane Eyre, Villette, Wuthering Heights, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and relevant film adaptions, exploring their similarities and differences, their representation of the limited power and freedom available in Victorian society, and the consequences of these limitations on the minds and hearts of women. We will also examine the creation of the Brontë myth—the fantasies and anxieties that have followed these women over the centuries, from gothic anecdotes about Emily Brontë violently beating her pet dog to the Brontë Sisters Power Dolls.\n\nENGL 367-01 Postcolonial Theory MWF 09:40 am-10:40 am CARN 105 David Moore 6 / 20 *Cross-listed with INTL 367-01* ENGL 386-01 From Literature to Film: Studies in Adaptation: Vietnam: Text, Film, Culture TR 03:00 pm-04:30 pm NEILL 226 Casey Jarrin 2 / 20 *First day attendance required* Through encounters with film, photography, memoirs, music, plays, and poems, we’ll examine cultural histories, ideological/military contexts, prevailing mythologies, protest movements, and critical reassessments of American involvement in Vietnam and the ensuing conflict (1959-1975). What distinguished the Vietnam War from other 20th-century American military actions? How did the media transmit visions of the war and the anti-war movement to an international audience (via newspapers, photographs, on television), contemporaneous with images of violence at \"home\" (urban riots, student protests, assassinations of JFK, RFK, MLK)? How have artists, authors, filmmakers responded to the war – its origins, traumas, aftermath – and in what genres/voices (prose, image, performance art, the 1967 International War Crimes Tribunal)? How might we see the ideological and military dramas of Vietnam revisited in Afghanistan and Iraq?\n\nWe’ll begin with contexts for the Vietnam conflict and Cold War policy/anxiety (Graham Greene, The Quiet American; Peter Weiss, Discourse on Vietnam; Manchurian Candidate), then view films about psychopathologies of war (Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket), read novels and memoirs (Michael Herr, Dispatches; Tim O'Brien, The Things They Carried; Norman Mailer, Why Are We in Vietnam?; Eldridge Cleaver, Soul on Ice; Denis Johnson, Tree of Smoke), poetry (Adrienne Rich, Yusef Komunyakaa, Muriel Rukheiser, Denise Levertov, Lawrence Ferlinghetti), David Rabe’s Vietnam trilogy of plays (Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel, Sticks and Bones, Streamers), contemporaneous music. We’ll consider representations of Vietnam-era masculinity (Deliverance, Taxi Driver), the trauma of veterans returning from combat (Coming Home, Rambo, Born on the Fourth of July), documentary reassessments (Far from Vietnam, Hearts and Minds, Unfinished Symphony, The Fog of War), and conclude with echoes of Vietnam in Afghanistan and Iraq (Jarhead; An-My Le’s photographs of Vietnam war re-enactors, Small Wars). Essays by Philip Caputo, Susan Sontag, Paul Virilio, Susan Faludi, Howard Zinn, Vivian Sobchack, Lawrence Weschler, Jean Baudrillard. Sunday film screenings. ENGL 394-01 British Romanticism TR 03:00 pm-04:30 pm CARN 105 Jennifer Baltzer-Lovato 11 / 20 Study of the great pan-European movement of Romanticism, as it emerges in British literary culture in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Our survey will encompass poetry, fiction, essays, manifestoes, and philosophical works; we’ll meet writers’ transformative literary inventiveness in the quest to give voice to issues of women’s rights, slavery and empire, revolution, class struggles; we’ll take up the great Romantic philosophical concerns, among them new views of nature, resistance to the preceding “age of reason,” explorations into the nature of imagination and the visionary. We’ll also examine stereotypes and misconceptions that arise about Romanticism. ENGL 394-02 18th C American Literature MWF 12:00 pm-01:00 pm CARN 204 Patricia Baehler 17 / 20 *First day attendance required* In this course we will consider the many social, religious, political, and intellectual forces at play in America’s metamorphosis from colony to nation. The American eighteenth century was a time of profound change, and the era’s literature, rich in generic diversity, reflects this volatility. We will read a variety of literary forms, from sermons to treatises, poetry to pamphlets, journals to novels, and explore the relationship between genre and the emerging American identity.\n\nENGL 394-03 Dead White Men MWF 03:30 pm-04:30 pm NEILL 214 Kiarina Kordela 1 / 20 *Cross-listed with GERM 337-01, MCST 337-01 and PHIL 294-03; taught in English* The shift away from feudal theocracy (when divinity grounded truth and political authority) to secular capitalist modernity has entailed unforeseen re-conceptualizations of both time and of the distinction between truth and fiction—the latter approaching extinction, as truth is increasingly perceived as a culturally arbitrary (hence fictional) construct. To examine these modern mutations of the central categories of time and truth-fiction, the course will pursue two parallel itineraries. On the one hand, the two competing modes of the secularization of time, as (a) human history progressing toward a certain telos (end or aim), and (b) as a machinic time within which inter-relations within an autonomous structure (one not controlled by humans) determine its participants. And, on the other hand, the replacement of faith with modern philosophy, ideology, and biopolitics. No prerequisites. ENGL 400-02 Seminar: Special Topics in Literary Studies (Capstone) TR 01:20 pm-02:50 pm OLRI 370 James Dawes 2 / 12 Suffering deforms and destroys language, turning articulated sound into inarticulate sobs and groans. But suffering also accelerates language, calling into being not only fervent acts of supplication and prayer but also the ornate literary and cultural lament. This course examines the relationship between literature and violations of human rights. How does literature represent the shock that results from witnessing bodies opened in torture and on the battlefield? How does it represent the trauma of peacetime structural violence and domestic injury? What kinds of suffering are more difficult to narrate, and why? How can we use language to alleviate suffering, or to decelerate group violence? We will consider the variety of ways authors and cultural theorists have attempted to speak the unspeakable, paying particular attention to the relationships among pain, belief, and the body. Authors of interest may include Edwidge Danticat, Junot Diaz, Nathan Englander, Julia Alvarez, Thomas Glave, John Edgar Wideman, and others. ENGL 406-01 Projects in Creative Writing M 07:00 pm-10:00 pm MAIN 001 Kristin Naca 2 / 12 *Permission of instructor required* This capstone in Creative Writing will focus on poetry. Writers compose and revise several drafts of poems, toward compiling a twenty-page manuscript. Writers will develop a critical practice by reading and annotating up to forty poetry collections and books of poetic craft. Writers will explore avenues of funding for their continued work, drafting letters of aesthetics, craft, and purpose for programs, grants, residencies, etc. Attending several public poetry readings is also required.\n\ntop of page\n\nEnvironmental Studies\n\nNumber/Section/Name Days Time Room Instructor Avail./Max.

In this course, we will examine the variety of ways that people in North America have shaped the environment, as well as how they have used, labored in, abused, conserved, protected, rearranged, polluted, cleaned, and thought about it. In addition, we will explore how various characteristics of the natural world have affected the broad patterns of human society, sometimes harming or hindering life and other times enabling rapid development and expansion. By bringing nature into the study of human history, and the human past into the study of nature, we will begin to see the connections and interdependencies between the two that are often overlooked.

It will contain six modules. First we will study climate change science, including the greenhouse effect, the carbon cycle, the climate system, and feedbacks that amplify or dampen changes to these systems. Second, we will cover topics from environmental economics, including market efficiency, externalities, public goods, growth, and discounting, specifically as they apply to climate change. Next, we will explore models used for understanding and predicting climate, including basic 1 and 2-dimensional models as well as more complex 3D models and Global Circulation Models (GCMs). The module will then combine these topics in an exploration of what impacts, natural and economic, are predicted by climate models for the near (100 year) future. Fourth, we will explore policy interventions for the reduction in greenhouse gases, including carbon taxes and cap and trade, and other regulation such as that taking place under the U.S. Clean Air Act. Where relevant we will discuss the successes and failures of these systems as they have been applied to date. We will also discuss the costs and benefits of subsidizing renewable energy and carbon-free energy sources and the costs of negative impacts of climate change on human and natural systems. Fifth, we will discuss the wide array of technological solutions that have been proposed to slow, stop or even reverse climate change. These range from things that are now common (wind turbines) to things that are gaining in popularity (geothermal) to the truly esoteric (mirrors in space). The final module will show how the preceding topics factor into Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). Governments and NGOs use these models to combine scientific and socioeconomic information in order to predict the outcomes of various climate and policy scenarios. These are the state of the art in climate science, economics and policy; students will be exposed to several of the most commonly used models and to research from their critics.\n\nWhile the course will have substantial quantitative content, its only prerequisite is ECON 119: Principles of Economics, and we hope to attract a diverse group of students of varying academic and personal experience.\n\nENVI 294-02 Land Change and Conservation Planning: Understanding and Mitigating a Threat to Critical Habitat MWF 03:30 pm-04:30 pm CARN 107 Robert Rose 5 / 25 *Cross-listed with GEOG 294-02* ENVI 294-04 Environmental History of Modern Europe TR 09:40 am-11:10 am MAIN 011 Julia Fein 19 / 25 *Cross-listed with HIST 294-05* ENVI 333-01 Economics of Global Food Problems TR 09:40 am-11:10 am CARN 05 Amy Damon 14 / 25 *Cross-listed with ECON 333-01 and INTL 333-01* ENVI 394-01 Introduction to Remote Sensing TR 09:40 am-11:10 am CARN 105 Robert Rose 8 / 15 *$25 course fee required; cross-listed with GEOG 362-01* ENVI 394-L1 Intro Remote Sensing Lab R 08:30 am-09:30 am CARN 108 Ashley Nepp 8 / 15 *Cross-listed with GEOG 362-L1* ENVI 477-01 Comparative Environment and Development Studies TR 01:20 pm-02:50 pm CARN 105 William Moseley 7 / 15 *Permission of the instructor required; cross-listed with GEOG 488-01 and INTL 477-01; first day attendance required; this is a Geography Senior seminar* ENVI 489-01 Environmental Leadership Pract M 07:00 pm-10:00 pm OLRI 241 Roopali Phadke 5 / 20 *Permission of the Instructor required; first day attendance required; this course is concurrently registered with ENVI 490-01; ACTC students may register on the first day of class with the permission of the instructor* ENVI 490-01 Envi St Leadership Seminar M 07:00 pm-10:00 pm OLRI 241 Roopali Phadke 5 / 20 *Permission of the Instructor required; 2 credit course; first day attendance required; this course is concurrently registered with ENVI 489-01; ACTC students may register on the first day of class with the p"
