He also purchased the Trump Marina from Trump Entertainment Resorts, which he reopened as Golden Nugget Atlantic City. He has also opened up casinos in New Jersey, Biloxi, Alabama, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.\n\nHe also purchased the Golden Nugget Lake Charles from Pinnacle Entertainment in part due to the fact that the location was within close proximity to his hometown of Houston, Texas.\n\nEntertainment\n\nTilman additionally owns amusement parks, aquariums, and the Kemah Boardwalk, which he purchased in 1999.\n\nHouston Rockets Owner\n\nTilman purchased the team back in October 2017 for $2.2 billion.\n\nBillion Dollar Buyer Show\n\nIn 2016 it was announced that Fertitta would be starring in a CNBC reality show called Billion Dollar Buyer. Fortunately for Mr. Tilman, the first season was wildly successful which resulted in the show getting picked up for an additional season with over twice as many episodes.\n\nArray\n\nThe show follows Fertitta as he works with entrepreneurs who have ingenious ideas/products that he could buy and or/license for his own businesses. For example, in one of his earlier episodes, Tilman found a small mom and pop company making what he thought was the most incredible hot sauce and barbecue sauce he’d ever tasted. After they implemented the changes he suggested, he offered them a massive deal to be in hundreds of his restaurant locations.\n\nGot a great product and want to be on the show?
