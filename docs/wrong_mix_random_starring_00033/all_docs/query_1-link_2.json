        "text": "While “media geography” has coalesced in recent years as an identifiable subdiscipline of human geography, media geography did not emerge from a linear history, nor does it have a clearly defined or singular focus. Compiling this edition, participating in media geography networks at conferences and elsewhere, and teaching media at our respective institutions have all abundantly revealed that media geography is a subdiscipline with many different routes and trajectories. People come to identify as media geographers as a result of an interest in a particular medium such as film, television or radio, through the literature on the Internet and geographies of cyberspace, through critical and popular geopolitics, through questions of development and the digital divide, through media and cultural studies, through communication studies, through scholarship on the city and urban studies, and through GIS, the geoweb and geospatial technologies.Media geography intersects with social and cultural geography, development geography, political geography, feminist geography, economic geography and GIS. One of the major contributions of media productions, spaces and analyses are the opportunities they offer for providing an entryway into understanding places and communities that we may otherwise rarely, if ever encounter—but this can be problematic when the representative and/or desirable. The contributions in this collection pay close attention to such opportunities and challenges posed by a range of media formats, contexts and methods. These diverse entry points make for a rich emerging field in which a number of voices and perspectives are present. The field is further complicated and enriched by scholars in media studies who have turned to human geography and human geographic concepts, in order to take space, place and scale seriously in their analyses of media texts, industries and audiences. Given the diversity of the field, we thought it valuable as editors to write three position pieces that situate our work, and us personally, within the broader project represented by the scholars in this volume.\n\nAt present, nearly every media-related subject field appears to be \"locative\", or with the prefix \"geo\" attached, be it the discussion on geoart, geosurveillance, or geocaching. Within this context, recent geographical and phenomenological studies on mobile media practices, in particular, reveal a trend toward a revaluation of place and placiality. While social sciences, media and cultural studies label this re-materialization of place \"spatial turn,\" a cultural, humanistic and media turn is acknowledged in geography. Currently, the two converging developments are still marked by differing conceptual formations: locative media and mediated localities. This paper as well as this issue are concerned with both sides-the spatial turn in media studies and the media turn in geographical studies-and provides a sketch of the subject area \"geomedia\" from a phenomenological perspective and the field of \"media geography\" from a dsciplinary perspective. As a theoretical framework for media geography in general and geomedia in particular, this article favors the actor-network theory for three reasons: a) The actor-network theory tends to conceptualize places prior to the network of heterogeneous agents; b) it reveals itself to be a suitable heuristic for locative media as through the geotagging of objects instead of people, the actor-media theory permits a manifestation of what Bruno Latour means by the \"Internet of Things\" and, c) on the other hand, the actor-network theory puts us in a position whereby mediated localities can be described as if there is nothing more in the territory than what is in the map. Based on this argument, the conclusion can be drawn that media geography therefore also constitutes a new discipline for overcoming the very distinction between physical and human geography.\n\nTwo comfortably understood processes—firstly, the way that embodied communication has across human history been divided by languages; and, secondly, the contribution that cities to bringing strangers together across such communicative divides—have also contributed to stopping us seeking to understand the contradictory relationship between media and the city. It is not as obvious as its sounds but media mediate—they abstract relations over extensions of space. They also provide the means for mutually interactive connections. What does it mean, for example, that the media, both in content and form, divides citizens of a global city, even as it brings them together? What does it mean that cities are intensely local places but the same media that represents citizens to each other also connects them globally? These two questions weave through this chapter, which explores how global and local forces coalesce in mediated urban spaces.\n\nBesides the potential advancement of technology, the global and local communication is framing itself within bigger dimensions. The messages delivered by actual media means and the intensive exchange of experiences and ideas are conceived by the communication specialists as the most effective ways to configure the positions and therefore, are offering new models for solutions to challenges of the life. Under the influence of electronic media, highly urbanized areas like remote provinces and lost, suffer the impact of a communication process only, support on standardization, repeatability and homogeneity. This influence increases much more in terms of a social organization nonsolid and isolation relative to individuals. Also, under the influence of technology, communication transcends, institutional and legal barriers by providing to citizen unlimited messages in time and space. This dimension will be limited to some form of analysis within the Albanian-speaking scope. As we already know, some powerful media companies based in Tirana are dominating the Albanian-speaking trade, deploying a business with clear geo-cultural and geo-linguistic orientation. Precisely, these cultural products are having national nuances and are stimulating homogenous tendencies of the thought, “threatening” the cultural nuances of diverse social groups included in the communication process. The “center” that is producing linguistic and cultural standards is enforcing the “periphery”, inflicting the demonstration of nuances, dialects, mentalities and different points of view. This mode, cannot avoid hegemonic reproduction phenomenon due to the effect structuring speech by \"mighty\" you have the opportunity to deliver the and transmit it. Thereupon, social group, that has access to the media reaches impose cultural patterns off majority of the population.
