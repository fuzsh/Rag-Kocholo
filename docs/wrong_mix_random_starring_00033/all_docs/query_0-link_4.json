        "text": "Lakers still interested in Bruce Brown\n\nThe Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks are two teams that showed interest in Brown last season, sources said, and Los Angeles maintains interest in him this offseason. One team whispered to have interest in Brown and was quietly mentioned as a possible suitor months ago is the Golden State Warriors. While unlikely to occur, the Warriors have the ability to move Andrew Wiggins, who is making more than $26 million this season, in a package from Toronto that includes Brown and other assets. This would open up more financial flexibility for the Dubs moving forward.\n\nGoing into next season, do you have anything to prove? You missed a lot of time and are returning to a competitive group, how do you feel as you prepare for another campaign? Tari Eason: I don’t have too many words on that. I’m going to let my game do the talking. A lot of stuff has been said, a lot of ways people view me, I hear it all. But I’m not here to prove anything. Are you referring to last season’s incident with the Golden State Warriors? Is that a part of the noise you’re talking about? Tari Eason: Yeah, just the outside noise. It doesn’t matter to me. Even as far as the Draymond (Green) thing, I was hurt and it was unfortunate that I couldn’t be out there to support my guys, but I didn’t even want that thing to blow up as much as it did. At the end of the day, you gotta put your money where your mouth is. It didn’t happen for us, but it’s fuel to the fire.\n\nYou carved out a reputation as an iron man as a rookie. To not be able to replicate that last season, how was that for you? Waking up knowing you can’t play in a game that evening? Tari Eason: It was weird going to games and not suiting up, wearing regular clothes. It was sad. There was a point where I really was sad, a low point. I didn’t know what was going to happen, I didn’t know what the solution was. That thought of not knowing is uncomfortable. But I stayed prayed up and focused on controlling what I could, even strengthening my right leg or getting my body right. My ability to have come back as fast as I have since surgery is a credit to the amount of time spent in the training room, working on all aspects of my body — my core, fitness and stamina. It’s allowed me to bounce back quicker.\n\nBut eyebrows went up a little higher when Murray didn’t dress for Canada’s game against France and played just seven minutes against Puerto Rico. The word from team sources is that Murray’s brief absence and the slow ramp up to competition as he got acclimated to the nine-hour time difference he was negotiating has all of been baked into the team’s planning. Murray was restricted to eight minutes of playing time against Puerto Rico and used all of that in the first half, which is why he didn’t play after the intermission and will have a heavier load (likely something in the mid-teens) in Canada’s scrimmage against Brazil on Wednesday.\n\nInsiders have said that Murray has been energetic and engaged during training camp and collaborative in all respects regarding playing time and role. He said wearing a Canadian jersey for the first time since the 2015 Pan Am Games was a special moment. “It had been a minute,” Murray said in Las Vegas. “When I was first out there, I felt excited.” Still it remains to be seen exactly how the 2023 NBA champion with a career playoff scoring average of 24.2 points a game fits in on a Canadian team that was firing on all cylinders without him on their way to a World Cup bronze last summer."
