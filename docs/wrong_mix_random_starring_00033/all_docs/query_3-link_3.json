        "text": "Welcome to Croque-Camille!\n\nIn this blog I intend to chronicle my dining, cooking, and general food-related adventures in my new hometown: Paris, France. Of course I may digress now and then, but if you’re into vicarious eating, you’ve come to the right place!\n\nI am a pastry chef by trade and a lover of food and travel by disposition. As such, my husband and I decided to uproot ourselves and become expats for a while. So far, it has been a daily adventure. There are things we miss (Mexican food, chicken-fried anything, a decent cheeseburger) and things we can’t get enough of (amazing bread, fresh croissants, plentiful duck, lait cru cheese).\n\nI have added a Platial map feature to the blog, where I will be mapping my favorite bakeries, bistros, markets, and other places of foodie interest. Click on the name of the establishment for addresses, hours, and Métro access information. Platial has left the building. As soon as I figure out how to read the exported map file, I’ll get the info back up on a Google map (which is better anyway, and I should have done a long time ago). And the new and improved Google map is up and running! All the old information is there, plus some new places, as many phone numbers as I could find, and links to more detailed write-ups, if they exist. And the map keeps growing, so check back often. I’ve linked to it above, as well as in the sidebar, where you can find it just below the calendar.\n\nIf you have any thoughts you would like to share with me, please leave a comment or feel free to email me at: croque (dot) camille (at) gmail (dot) com.\n\nSeveral people have asked my why I don’t post all of the recipes that I use. Mostly, it’s because I’m guessing at the amounts anyway. But I usually write down what I cook, so if you see something on here that you’re dying to replicate, shoot me an email and I’ll do my best to pass the recipe along to you.\n\nAll writing on Croque-Camille by\n\nCamille Malmquist (unless otherwise noted) is licensed under a\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.\n\nAll photography on Croque-Camille by\n\nCamille Malmquist (unless otherwise noted) is licensed under a\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License."
