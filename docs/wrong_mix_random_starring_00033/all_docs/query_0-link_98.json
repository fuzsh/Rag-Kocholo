        "text": "Kelly Clarkson, husband Brandon Blackstock, and their kids, River Rose, 5, and Remy, 4, are spending time at their cabin in Montana. It’s not a palatial home for a superstar — it’s only one room. That makes Clarkson completely relatable to a lot of families out there in America. It’s a small space to be sharing when everyone has work, school, and a few tantrums to attend to.\n\n“Nine times out of 10 my kids are losing it ’cause they have to do school, which is somehow a shock every day, as well as nap time. It’s super fun,” she laughed while talking to Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager Thursday on TODAY with Hoda & Jenna.\n\nClarkson has been busy making sure her family’s schedule is flowing smoothly. She has The Kelly Clarkson Show that her daughter River took over on Wednesday, The Voice and she dropped a new single on Thursday. The controlled chaos is happening at the same time her Montana cabin in under renovation. So when Clarkson admits to imbibing in a glass of wine every once in a while, she’s earned it.\n\n“And I’m cooking all the time and cleaning all the time while doing work for several things. It’s the most insane thing ever, honestly. And I drink a bit of wine, but we’re hanging in there, so it’s good.”\n\nClarkson isn’t taking the easy route either when it comes to quarantine. Montana is still cold in April and her family had to deal with frozen pipes recently.\n\n“This is the real thing. We are under snow right now and the pipes froze where we are staying. I had to use my kids’ tiny little potty because it was snowing outside,” she admitted to Kotb. “It was freezing and well, gotta go!”\n\nAdmittedly, staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic is hard on anyone’s mental health. That’s why Clarkson hopes her single, “I Dare You” will lift fans’ spirits during this dark time.\n\n“In all seriousness, it is funny with the kids and it is hard doing the teaching and all those kinds of things, but it can be depressing, this kind of isolation,” she said. “It can be a little dark for everyone and there’s a lot of uncertainty. We felt like the message before the pandemic, we thought it was a globally connecting environment, the message, but now even more so.”\n\nFor Clarkson, who considers herself an “extrovert,” these times are challenging, but she’s taking it day-by-day just like every other parent. Even with the frustrations of quarantine, she knows a lot of humor and a little wine will get her through."
