James McCutcheon as a young man was quite an athlete. He has often told me his recollections of the War of 1812 and the great rejoicing when peace was concluded. I think he was past thirty years of age when he became a professed Christian. Sister Harriet writes: \"When Frank was a little more than a year old, in 1824, there was a wonderful revival in the town of Epsom. Grown people, mostly the heads of families were converted, in which father and mother were included. Father's conversion was considered almost like that of St. Paul's. He was working alone down by the river (Suncook); did not return as expected and some one went to see why. They found him lying on a log almost unconscious and seeming to see Christ. From that time he was a new man and developed both intellectually and spiritually very rapidly and soon began to preach as a layman; but in a few years was ordained regularly and was considered a very strong, logical preacher.'\n\n\"With a very rudimentary education and little preparation except his earnest piety and zeal, he became a minister of the Free-Will Baptist Church and preached for about thirty years. I remember hearing him preach when I was a boy. From 1824 to 1849 he lived on the old place at North Pembroke. He served one or more terms in the legislature of the state. He was appointed Justice of the Peace by Governor Isaac Hill. He continued to work the old farm until 1849, when he moved to the 'Gale Place,' on Pembroke Street, which is about five miles out of Concord, N.H. The house is still standing (1930). It is a very pretty cottage with two gothic windows in the rof and a large elm tree in the yard.\" - B.M.C.\n\nFrom The McCutcheon (Cutcheon) family records : allied families of McClary, Tripp, Brown and Critchett by McKee, Florence McCutcheon; Grand Rapids, Mich.: Commonwealth Printing Co., 1931, 369 pgs.\n\nLewis M. Cutcheon had a memorial window placed in the Epsom church where Rev. James McCutcheon preached. All the windows were alike with the exception of one which had a different emblem on top, and the one in memory of Rev. Jas. McCutcheon, which had \"The Cross and Crown.\" Lewis M. Cutcheon also erected a momument on the McCutcheon lot in the North Pembroke cemetery.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wife - Elsie Gault\n\n1850 US Census, Pembroke, NH\n\nJames McCutcheon, age 58\n\nElsie, age 58\n\nAnn M., age 9\n\nGravestone Elsie G.

He was the son of Philip and Sally Peirce Sargent. He early manifested a great interest in music, and became quite proficient as a drummer. When only sixteen years of age he was stationed with others, at Fort Constitution, in the War of 1812, and commissioned drum-major. He always resided in the town of his birth, and for many years was chosen to represent the same in General Court, and to fill various other offices in the interests of his fellow-citizens. He was born on and inherited the farm now owned by the China Manufacturing Company. He made the brick and built the house in which Colonel D.L. Jewell, the agent, now resides.\n\nIn 1843 he sold this place to the Pembroke Mills Company, moving a short distance\n\nto land he owned, where he built a house and fitted up a home, in which he lived and died.\n\nMr. Sargent was always a decided Democrat and was intensely loyal to the government. He lived to see the triumph of the Federal army over the Rebellion, and died in the hope of peace and abounding prosperity to every section of our fair country. He was for many years an honored member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, contributing freely for the building of the late chapel in Suncook village, for the purchase of the organ, and for the support of the various institutions of religion. His deomocracy and piety were always well illustrated in his liberality and justice. Being for many years an esteemed member of the Masonic fraternity, he met all men \"on the level, and parted with them on the square.\"\n\nHe was married, in 1815, to Sally Gault, of Hooksett. She proved to be a woman of uncommon domestic ability, and every way well qualified to preside over a family and a home. She died May 10, 1863. He died June 4, 1868. They lived together nearly fifty years. There were born to them eleven children--seven sons and four daughters. Three sons died in infancy, and two became young men and then deceased. Philip Sargent, the eldest son, resides in the finest brick mansion in the town, which he has erected close by the place where he was born.\n\nWarren Sargent inherits, and now occupies, the old homestead, which is regarded as one of the best farms and pleasantest situations in Allenstown.\n\nThese brothers are known as the firm of P.& W. Sargent, brick-makers, Suncook, N.H.\n\nSallie S., the eldest daughter, first married George Hirsch, who soon after died, and\n\nshe married Rev. H.H. Hartwell, a Methodist minister and member of the New Hampshire Conference, and now owns and dwells in a fine \"cottage home\" near the place of her birth.\n\nElsie K. is the esteemed wife of Henry W. Forbush, Esq. a merchant in Philadelphia.\n\nMary H. is the honored wife of W.F. Head, Esq. of Hooksett, a brother and a life-long\n\npartner in business, and now occupying the splendid residence of the late ex-Governor Natt. Head.\n\nAbbie H. is the true and faithful companion of Natt. B. Emery, one of the long-known\n\nfirm of Emery Brothers, and has a platial residence in Suncook village.\n\nThese six children all revere the memory of their departed parents, and in talent and\n\ncharacter are living to honor the family name.\n\nSamuel Gault and Mehitable Sargent\n\nHusband Samuel Gault\n\nBorn: Christened: Died: Buried:\n\nMarriage:\n\nWife Mehitable Sargent\n\nBorn: Christened: Died: Buried:\n\nFather: Jonathan Sargent Mother: Molly Lucas\n\nOther Spouse: Jonathan Robinson - Apr 26, 1846\n\nChildren\n\nSamuel Gault and Martha McDaniel\n\nHusband Samuel Gault\n\nBorn: Christened: Died: Buried:\n\nMarriage: Sep 10, 1782\n\nWife Martha McDaniel\n\nBorn: Christened: Died: Bef 1800 Buried:\n\nFather: Robert McDaniel Mother: Unknown\n\nChildren Notes: Marriage\n\nMarriage from History of Pembroke, (p . 509)\n\nEugene Herbert Gauthier and Brenda Unknown\n\nHusband Eugene Herbert Gauthier\n\nBorn: Aug 14, 1945 - Epsom, NH Christened: Died: Dec 21, 2001 - Concord, NH Buried: - McClary-Epsom, NH Center Cemetery, Epsom, NH\n\nFather: Clyde H.
