Originating from 11 African countries, the 35 early-career scholars selected reflect this geographical range but also the diversity of fields and research projects represented in the applications.\n\nHenry Obi Ajumeze\n\nUniversity of Cape Town\n\nSouth Africa\n\nField of Study: Environmental Humanities/Drama\n\nTitle of Research: The Bio-Politics of Violence in the Drama of the Niger Delta\n\nHenry Obi Ajumeze recently completed a PhD in the Centre for African Studies at the University of Cape Town. He holds a Bachelor's degree from the University of Calabar, Nigeria, and an MPhil from the University of Ghana, Legon -- both of which are obtained in Theatre Arts. His PhD puts transdisciplinary posthumanist theory to work by exploring ways in which the creeks and rivers as well as the nonhuman species in the coastal region of Nigeria's Niger Delta are inscribed in the violent resistance to eco/environmental pollution by Big Oil Corporations and how these affordances are imagined and represented in modern Nigerian drama. He has a particular interest in environmental/energy humanities and uses his background in theatre to interrogate notions of heroism and agency beyond human exclusivity. His work was awarded the Ivan Karp Doctoral Research Award in 2016. He is also a three-time recipient of SSRC Next-Gen Fellowship. His scholarly work has been published in Ofo Journal of Transatlantic Journal, Anthropos, South African Theatre Journal among others. He has contributed chapters to edited volumes most recent of which is Re-Thinking Environment: Literature, Ethics and Praxis (Authorspress, 2017). He writes poetry, with one acclaimed collection, Dimples in the Sand (2009), and has featured poems in several anthologies and journals.\n\nGetnet Tibebu Alemayehu\n\nAddis Ababa University\n\nEthiopia\n\nField of Study: English Literature\n\nTitle of Research: Resistance and Representation in Selected Anglophone African Novels\n\nI am Getnet Tibebu, from Ethiopia, and a PhD candidate at Addis Ababa University. I have participated in conducting research and sharing knowledge with my students. I am a disciplined and honest person. As a lecturer, I have one year experience in Mizan-Tepi University. Currently, I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature at Addis Ababa University. My future dream is to be an excellent researcher and best teacher in English languages and literature. I have great desire to continue my education since it is a key to success. Learning literature is a tool which serves as a mirror to see one another's cultural, political, economic, social, etc, aspects. Moreover, it is an interdisciplinary stream. Thus, this motivates me a lot. Through education, I will strongly work to decolonize the mind (bring freedom of thought) for African people in particular and for the world in general. Learning in general is a road map which leads us to the bright corner of the world. For this reason, I am highly motivated to get better education.\n\nMihret Kebede Alwabie\n\nAcademy of Fine Arts, Vienna\n\nAustria / Ethiopia\n\nField of Study: Arts\n\nTitle of Research: Conversing with Silence\n\nMihret Kebede is an artist/poet, who graduated from Addis Ababa University School of Fine Arts and Design in painting with distinction in 2007 and has earned her MA in arts from the same school in 2016.

I was born in Mekelle, Ethiopia on Sep. 11,1978 G. C. I earned my BED in English from Dilla University in 2000 G.C.; MA in Literature in English from A.A.U in 2005; and PhD in Literature in English from A.A.U in 2014 G.C.\n\nMy MA thesis is entitled “Images of Darkness in Selected English Poems”. In this study, I argued and tried to demonstrate the positive valuations darkness can have, in stark contrast to popular assumptions, both as a symbol and as a physical phenomenon. In my dissertation I took up the question of universal human predicament. I attempted to explore the subject of human suffering from a mystical perspective. I adopted an eclectic approach for this research drawing varied insights from the philosophical implications of quantum physics, phenomenology, existentialism, psychoanalysis and the mystical traditions of Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Sufism. In this research I attempted to develop the argument that suffering is not inherent to existence but an undesirable byproduct of our predominantly sensory and rational modes of consciousness to the exclusion of intuitive awareness. Consequently, I argued that nurturing our intuitive powers can help us gain unitive consciousness that will remedy our perceptual malady.\n\nPerhaps going a bit further out of my major area of interest, I have also conducted a medium scale joint research on the value of media in addressing issues of the Five Year Growth and Transformation Plan of Ethiopia (2011-2015) (with a focus on Media outlets operating in Tigrai region).\n\nI am currently conducting a research on Nature Mysticism in Tigrinya poetry. I have been working as a lecturer in a private college (Nile College) from July 2001- 2003 and in MekelleUuniverstty from 2005- onwards. In my leisure time I like to spend time in my garden at home or out in the wilderness tuning in to the quiet insights and healing whispers of nature and writing poetry that emerges out of these experiences.\n\nAndualem Tolessa Bobe\n\nHaramaya University\n\nEthiopia\n\nField of Study: English Literature\n\nTitle of Research: Generations and Power Relations as Reflected in Selected Contemporary East African English Novels\n\nI'm Andualem Tolessa.

I then joined the department of Foreign/English/ Language and Literature in Debub/Hawasa/ University and graduated with a BA in Foreign/English/ Language and Literature in July 2005. For my BA thesis I studied the English Poems of Biruk Gebre Medhin. The title of my thesis is “A Thematic Appraisal of Biruk Gebre Medhin’s 'My Seal'” and in it I critically analyzed his poems’ themes using post-colonial literary theory. As an MA student in Addis Ababa University between 2006 and 2008, I have done various studies like “The Psychodynamics of Plot in Somerset Maugham’s short Story 'A string of Beads'”, “Colonialism as a Boomerang in Mongo Beti’s 'The Poor Christ of Bomba'”, “A stylistic analysis of irony in Gemoraw’s poem 'Oh Robot'”, and others. My MA thesis entitled “The Predicament of the Diaspora: as Reflected in 'The Texture of Dreams' and 'The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears'” was published as a manuscript by LAP Lambert Publishers. It is where my interest in Diaspora literature, post colonialism, and post-structuralism got even stronger. As a lecturer in Arba Minch University I did “a comparative study of Modernization and the Modern Intelligentsia as Reflected in Be’alu Girma’s “käʾadəmasə bašagärə” and Wole Soyinka’s “The Interpreters”” which is published in the Proceedings of the 4th Annual Research Symposium of the University. This study revealed to me that post-structuralism and deconstruction are effective for a richer and more critical reading of African novels, especially novels that deal with African/Ethiopian elites. Thus, for my PhD which I completed in June 2017 in Addis Ababa University, I did a comparative study of Amharic and Afaan Oromo novels using post structuralism, especially deconstruction. In this study, I tried to deconstruct the ideologies behind the overt ideological projects of the novels. I showed in the study how ethno nationalist culturalism and liberal Ethiopian nationalism are deeply intertwined and are continually deconstructing and debasing each other. Due to the space limitations of PhD dissertations, I was able to deal only with two pairs of novels that partly covered two regimes. So I am now doing a full- fledged book project which is an extension of this PhD but with more depth and breadth. The book would have three core chapters: “Ideology and Remembering the Past”, “Ideology and Making Sense of the Present”, and “Ideology and Envisioning a Future”. Currently I am engaged in a critical reading of two futuristic Amharic and Afaan Oromo novels as part of the third chapter of this project. I am doing this in Arba Minch University while teaching English language and literature courses. I am also preparing an MA in Literature curriculum which is going to be launched next year. In addition, I am currently engaged in a study entitled “Folklore and Environmental Conservation among the Aari of Southern Ethiopia: An Ecocritical Study of Aari Proverbs and Myths”. Furthermore, I am presently serving as a language editor of Arba Minch University’s newly launched journal “Ethiopian Journal of Business and Social Sciences”.\n\nKim Gurney\n\nUniversity of Western Cape\n\nSouth Africa\n\nField of Study: Contemporary Art, Cultural Geography, Urban Studies\n\nTitle of Research: Platform\n\nKim Gurney is a writer, artist and researcher based in Cape Town, South Africa.

From 2008 to present, I have been performing these dual functions within the department, first as a Masters student and now as a doctoral student. My areas of expertise have included Mass Communication Theory and Methodology, Intercultural Communication and Contemporary Publishing. I have also taught Women, Media and ICTs in the Department of Women and Gender Studies of the same university. My teaching career started as a response to a need within the department and has grown into something I love. My interaction with students and the constant push to broaden my knowledge in order to better serve them has refined me as a student. I begin to ask questions where I would expect them to. Scholarship has become interesting for me especially given the vast untapped landscape called Africa. I hope to continue to ask questions and sometimes provide the answers to other questions, not only in the classroom but in the field where the people are. The papers I have published so far reflect this quest. Some of my research has been on trying to identify the link between mass communication theory in line with the practical values of a developing nation; the nexus of conflict reporting in Cameroon – Boko Haram and CAR conflicts; engendering ICTs and Market women’s use of mobile phones. I am currently working on how the African press reports the stock exchange as part of an initiative to develop learning material for African students interested in economic journalism. However, my major research area for my terminal degree is based on Media narratives of the Anglophone crisis in Cameroon. Who, what, when, how and with what effect are the fundamental questions I hope to address. Answers to these questions may provide solutions to conflict prevention and management.\n\nLauren Van der Rede\n\nUniversity of Western Cape\n\nSouth Africa\n\nField of Study: Literature and Culture\n\nTitle of Research: The Post-Genocidal Condition: Ghosts of Genocide, Genocidal Violence and Representation\n\nLauren van der Rede is an Early Career Scholar at the Centre for Humanities Research at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa.
