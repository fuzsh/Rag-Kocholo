        "text": "OLTL History 2001-2004\n\n2001\n\nBlair agreed to marry Todd but put a stop to his plans for a quick wedding and said she wanted to wait and get married in Llanview. Blair remained torn over her plans for a future with Todd and shared these fears with Kelly, who tried to warn Blair away from Todd.\n\nTodd learned that Skye was really Rae's daughter but didn't share this news with anyone. After going to Rae for advice about Blair, she told him to give Blair an emotional gift to prove how he felt about her. Todd then presented Blair with a copy of the Bible page and she was thrilled to learn a secret that could shatter Skye's world.\n\nSkye was released from jail after passing a lie detector test that John had arranged for. Skye wanted to get revenge against Todd and Blair and eventually forgave Max for not believing in her innocence. Max and Skye then teamed up to destroy Todd and Blair.\n\nTodd and Blair vowed to get even with all who had wronged them. To that end, Todd and Blair told Skye that Rae had shot Max. Todd and Blair then told Renee that Max knew the identity of her real son and also told Asa that Max had been scamming him. Thrilled with the havoc they had created, Todd and Blair spent the night together and made love.\n\nNora was still determined to get the truth from Colin, who grew even more obsessed with her and even built a secret shrine to her in his home. Lindsay tried to warn Colin about Nora's true motives but his arrogance prevented him from believing her.\n\nViki was horrified when Ben was kidnapped before her eyes. As it turned out, Ben's abductor was Gina Russo, his first love and member of the Russo crime family. Gina was furious when Ben asked her to help him bring down Tim Rourke and her brother Tommy, but she later agreed to help him. Ben then returned home, much to Viki's relief and delight.\n\nMelanie turned down Bo's marriage proposal for fear of having her secret about her father come to light. Melanie disappeared one day but Bo soon realized where she had gone and tracked her down. Bo told Melanie she could tell him her secret when she wanted to and she accepted his marriage proposal.\n\nRae convinced John to investigate her in Max's shooting after Todd and Blair accused Rae of the crime. By doing this, Rae hoped to create reasonable doubt for Skye. Rae also decided not to tell Skye that she was her mother.\n\nMax and Skye set out to destroy Todd and Blair. To that end, Max drugged Blair and arranged for Todd to see him and Blair in bed together. Todd, however, had no idea that Blair was unconscious from the drugs and thought she had betrayed him on the night before their wedding.\n\nOn her wedding day, Blair walked down the aisle in front of her guests and was shocked by what happened next. Instead of saying \"I do,\" Todd announced to everyone in the room that Blair had shot Max in the back! Blair was speechless by Todd's betrayal and couldn't fathom why he had done this. But Todd wasn't done yet! After exposing Blair's secret, Todd announced that Skye was really Rae's daughter and that Max wasn't the real Buchanan heir. Todd later told Renee that Ben was her son and Ben admitted that it was true.\n\nTodd and Blair were both arrested and Blair didn't understand why Todd had betrayed her as she still had no idea about Max's manipulations. Still thinking Blair had committed the ultimate betrayal, Todd agreed to turn over incriminating evidence against Blair in exchange for no charges being brought against him.\n\nJennifer Rappaport came to Llanview from her Switzerland boarding school. Jennifer was a troubled girl who put misplaced trust in her evil Uncle Colin MacIver. When Jen was a little girl, Colin helped her when she caught her mother Lindsay having an affair. Colin held this over Jen's head, convincing her she was responsible for her parents' divorce. Colin tormented Jen and even made a pass at her.\n\nRoseanne was thrilled when Antonio asked her to move in with him. Roseanne's happiness was short-lived, however, after Antonio learned that she had deliberately withheld an urgent message for him from Sophia. As it turned out, Sophia was in desperate need of back up and Roseanne had jeopardized Sophia's life by failing to give Antonio the message. Antonio was furious with Roseanne and told her to pack up and leave. Antonio then cleared up the misunderstanding with Sophia and explained he never would have ignored her call for help.\n\nAfter Antonio dumped Roseanne she was heartbroken. She got drunk, and devious Dr. Colin MacIver took advantage of her. The two ended up sleeping together. Roseanne was horrified when she realized what she'd done. Soon after, Antonio forgave Roseanne for not giving him Sophia's message, and they got their relationship back into gear again. Roseanne feared that if she told him about Colin then he would leave her again. When Roseanne finally told him the truth about Colin, Antonio was upset, but forgave her again.\n\nAntonio and Sophia made it their mission to nail R.J. for all his crimes. Sophia suspected that Roseanne, who took over as receptionist at the Llanview police station, was tipping off career criminal RJ Gannon. Sophia tried to prove Roseanne was a mole, and even worked with former rival Kelly to do so.\n\nColin continued his campaign of threats and blackmail and added Roseanne to his list when he learned she was RJ's mole at the police station. Colin also took great delight in torturing Jen and had spent years making her feel responsible for Sam and Lindsay's divorce.\n\nNora's quest to expose Lindsay's role in her kidnapping led her closer to Colin, who promised to tell Nora everything if she made love with him. Nora was repulsed by Colin and made it clear she would never love him. This sent Colin even more over the edge and his behavior became increasingly dangerous.\n\nColin told Will the truth about Lindsay's role in Nora's kidnapping and he angrily confronted his mother. Although disgusted by what she had done, Will agreed that he wouldn't turn Lindsay over to the police. Jessica began to suspect that Will was keeping a secret but he couldn't bring himself to confide in her.\n\nViki was immediately suspicious of Gina Russo and she had every right to be. When Viki confronted Gina about her \"contacts\" and need to spend time alone with Ben, Gina admitted that she wanted Ben back for herself! A strong Viki, however, remained confident that nothing would ever come between her and Ben.\n\nJen stole a fake ID from Break Bar and ended up almost dying from alcohol poisoning after drinking alone in the park. Cristian and Skye took Jen to the hospital and she recovered, but Will was determined to find out where she had gotten the fake ID. A short time later, Jessica discovered that Cristian was the person selling fake IDs to minors but didn't share this news with Will.\n\nMax blackmailed Asa by threatening to tell the police that Asa had put the hit out on Ben. Blair forced Max to confess that he had drugged her and made Todd believe they had slept together. Before Blair could get to Todd, the police arrested her for shooting Max based on evidence Todd gave them. Todd got wind of Max's setup from Nora and scared Max into telling him the truth. Todd, deciding he and Blair belonged together, tried unsuccessfully to get the evidence back from the police. Todd planted a bomb in Bo's office, but Bo and Melanie managed to diffuse it before it went off. Meanwhile, Blair realized she still loved Todd, but followed Sam's advice and told Todd their life together was over.\n\nColin summoned his enemies to a \"secrets and lies\" dinner party and announced he was leaving for Maui. Colin also revealed that he was prompted to make the call that ended Sam and Lindsay's marriage after receiving a call from frightened Jen, who had witnessed Lindsay's affair. Later that night, Colin lay in wait for Nora to return home. Colin injected Nora with a mystery drug and planned to abduct her, but was confronted by an unseen visitor. Sam later rescued Nora from Colin's, but Colin was nowhere to be found. Bo began to investigate Colin's disappearance.\n\nViki discovered that Gina was Rourke's boss and that she was setting up the attempts on Ben's life to get him back. Gina forced Viki to leave Ben and lie that she was on a speaking tour by threatening to kill Jessica. Gina locked Viki in a room in her basement and convinced Ben to stay with her for his own protection.\n\nWhile in the woods, Jessica and Will stumbled upon Colin's body. Jessica reluctantly went along with Will, Jen, and Cristian when they decided to rebury the body and keep quiet about their discovery. Jessica returned to the gravesite to retrieve a charm she lost and was spotted by Bo. Jessica panicked when Bo decided to have the grave dug up, but all the police found was a scarecrow. The foursome wondered what had happened to Colin's body, which was actually in RJ's possession.\n\nSophia and Antonio received an anonymous tip and raided RJ's warehouse, but instead of finding stolen goods, they found a box with a murdered Colin MacIver's body in it. During the raid, Sophia's back was injured and she was in need of intense physical therapy to regain full use of her legs. Sophia was sent to rehab in Minnesota and she made Kelly promise to uncover Roseanne as the mole and make her pay.\n\nKelly confronted Roseanne about this information, and forced her to tell Antonio the truth. When Roseanne told Antonio the truth he was very mad. He didn't tell anyone, but forced Roseanne to resign from the police station, and ended their relationship once and for all.\n\nJen took a liking to Cristian Vega, who stood by her when she was a suspect in Colin's murder.\n\nAfter Todd failed to steal the evidence against Blair, her case was bound over for trial. With Kelly's help, Blair concocted a plan to get Max on her side. Blair lied to Max that she was pregnant with his child. Todd found out about the baby before Blair could clue him in to her scheme. Max forced Blair to take a pregnancy test at the hospital, and Blair was stunned when the test came back positive.\n\nBen grew suspicious about Viki's whereabouts, so Gina had Viki call him and say she had left town to get away from him. Ben learned from Gina that Asa had put the hit on him. To keep Ben close, Gina lied that Rourke was still gunning for him after Ben learned Asa called off the hit. Viki grew more agitated during her confinement and eventually turned into Niki Smith.\n\nDetermined to meet her father, Skye followed Rae to Port Charles.\n\nMax learned from Renee that Asa was planning to remarry Alex. He rushed to the ceremony but was shocked when he discovered Gabrielle Medina was Asa's new bride. Gabrielle revealed that Asa had legally adopted their son Al who had disowned Max as his father. But Asa's marriage to Gabrielle was just part of an elaborate revenge plot against Max.\n\nThe forensics report proved that Melanie's hair matched the samples found at Colin's house. She confessed to killing Colin and also admitted to murdering her own father. Lanie was arrested but Nora and Bo didn't believe she committed the crime. Lanie returned Bo's engagement ring and called off the wedding. Meanwhile, Will concealed Colin's passport behind a picture in his apartment. Jen admitted to Will that she witnessed something that night at Colin's. In a shocking turn of events, Sam confessed to killing Colin. Jen and Cristian grew closer but she was unable to move forward because of the secrets she was keeping about Colin's murder. Lindsay spirited Jen into staying quiet and tried to keep her away from Cristian.\n\nBo suspected that Melanie was keeping a secret but she beseeched him to just let the matter drop. Bo, however, had no intention of just letting Melanie walk out of his life and became determined to learn why she was pushing him away. Bo found out that Melanie assisted her father's wish to die when he was in a prolonged battle with cancer, and decided that Melanie was right in her decision to help her father die with dignity. However, Melanie became paranoid when Bo wasn't in a rush to get married anymore, and Lindsay encouraged Melanie to pretend she was dying so that Bo would marry her. Once Bo learned of Melanie's duplicity, he ended their relationship, and Melanie moved to Seattle.\n\nOver time, Renee was able to bring Asa and Ben together for a rare dinner at The Palace, but both men were too stubborn to openly accept each other.\n\nGina held Viki captive in her basement. However, Viki's alters began emerging and Gina was introduced to \"Jean Randolph\", \"Tommy\", and \"Niki\". Ben became suspicious after learning that Gina questioned Jessica about Viki's DID. \"Jean\" convinced Gina that she could impersonate Viki in order to break-up with Ben. After passing Gina's test, \"Jean\" met Ben at crossroads and told him it was over. Ben finally understood that Viki was sending him clues and he realized that Gina was behind Viki's disappearance. Ben turned the tables on Gina and demanded to know where Viki was. Gina's thugs had already taken Viki up to the cliff where Gina planned to get rid of her. Ben arrived as a struggle broke out between Gina and Viki. Ben intervened but not before Gina rendered Viki unconscious with a hit to the head. Ben tried to coax the gun away from Gina but she accidentally fell off the cliff. Viki and Ben reunited and Viki revealed that the emergence of her alters was just a plot so she could escape.\n\nIn a quest to destroy Blair, Todd evicted her and humiliated her with a slanderous headline in The Sun. Blair learned she was pregnant with Todd's baby but decided to pass it off as Max's when Todd vowed to gain sole custody of Starr. Blair awaited Max's arrival at her hearing but instead Todd showed up to testify. Todd revealed Blair's crazy actions on the stand. The judge rendered her temporarily insane and remanded her to St. Ann's. Blair figured out that Todd's testimony was actually a ploy to prevent her from going to jail.\n\nTo keep Max from knowing when she gave birth, Blair fled to Mexico to have her baby in secret. Todd followed, and actually delivered the child he thought was Max's! Todd was disgusted at the sight of Max's child and ordered the midwife, Paloma, to get rid of the child. Paloma refused, so Todd took the child away and tried to give it to some nuns at the local airport.\n\nDavid Vickers saw Todd give the baby away and told the nuns that Todd was his “life partner” and got the baby back. He brought the boy to the hacienda where Todd and Blair were staying, and Todd paid David a hefty sum to “get rid of the baby.\" Meanwhile, Todd lied to a devastated Blair that the baby had died, and brought Blair back to Llanview away from Paloma, who still knew the truth. Believing the baby was dead, Blair told Max that the baby was Todd's after all.\n\nBlair learned that it would be virtually impossible for her to regain custody of Starr. Todd propositioned Blair to move in to the penthouse in order for her to be close to Starr. Todd and Blair sparred over the living arrangements, and they ultimately decided that it would make more sense to live at Dorian's place. Todd and Blair continued to argue, but agreed to sleep in the same bed for Starr's sake. Starr overheard Roseanne talking to Senora Lena about a love potion and decided to obtain some for her parents. Todd discovered that Starr had spiked Blair's lemonade with the potion, and he rushed to her aid. Touched by Todd's concern for her and the baby, Blair pondered telling Todd the truth -- that he was the father of her baby.\n\nGabrielle reacquainted herself with Viki in an attempt to bury the hatchet, but Viki believed that she had a hidden agenda. At Asa and Gabrielle's wedding reception, Gabrielle manipulated a huge fight between Ben and Max. She then suggested that Ben join her revenge plot against Max, but he refused. After a confrontation with Al, Max decided to move out of the mansion. Asa reminded Gabrielle that Max moving out could hinder their revenge plot, and he demanded that she somehow convince Max to stay. Asa and Gabrielle then staged a fight as part of their plan to keep Max at the mansion. Max and Gabrielle continued to fantasize about one another and reflected upon the passionate times they had shared in the past.\n\nNora vowed to prove that Sam was taking the rap for someone else. However, the results of the forensics report lead Bo to arrest Sam for Colin's murder. Jen confided the truth about Colin's murder to Rae. When Lindsay found out, she broke into Rae's house to steal Jen's confession tape. Lindsay and Sam asked Jen to stay away from Cristian for fear that Jen would reveal the truth about Colin's murder to him. Jessica and Will's relationship suffered when she found Colin's passport. She suspected that Will was lying to her, and he refused to open up to her. Sam's trial began, and Lindsay spirited Jen out of town so that she wouldn't be called to testify. Nora concluded that Will was the murderer after overhearing a conversation between Ben and Sam. On the stand, Nora cross-examined Will about Colin's passport, but Jen arrived and announced that Colin gave her his passport the night he was murdered. Jen took the stand and testified that she saw her parents carrying Colin's body out of the MacIver house the night of the murder. Lindsay and Sam finally realized that Jen didn't kill Colin after thinking all along that they had been helping to cover her guilt. Nora surmised that Lindsay murdered Colin, and Lindsay was subpoenaed to testify. Meanwhile, Nora continued to be haunted by flashes of Colin's laughter. Nora badgered Lindsay on the witness stand relentlessly in Colin's murder trial before Nora finally remembered the truth; Nora herself had killed Colin in self-defense, and blocked out the traumatic memory. Nora wasn't brought up on charges.\n\nWill and Jessica later broke up, and then Will left town shortly after, to roam the country and find himself. Jessica moved out of Will's loft and back to Llanfair. Jessica was able to pick up the pieces with the help of her new friend Natalie Balsom, and a new man, Seth Anderson.\n\nSeth Anderson, Cristian's friend from Union Square, arrived in Llanview. Renee hired Seth at Palace Bar while RJ also gave him a part-time job at Break Bar. Natalie befriended Jessica and Natalie claimed to be homeless. Jessica took Natalie into her home at Llanfair, and convinced Viki to hire Natalie as her personal assistant.\n\nWhen Allison Perkins appeared in town and was asking Viki's \"forgivness\" for kidnapping her baby all those years ago, Ben was suspicious, but Viki was open to forgiving the regretful Allison. After Viki forgave her, Ben overheard Allison talking to someone on the phone, saying \"Viki forgave me. It's all set.\" Ben decided to go to St. Ann's as \"Dave\", a mental patient. He pretended to be simple Dave so Allison would tell him what she was up to. Allison began to fall in love with \"Dave,\" but Ben wasn't worried. Before he could get the truth from her, she found out who he really was.\n\nDavid gave Todd and Blair's baby to a rich Texan couple, and when Todd found out the child was not Max's but his, Todd forced David to tell him where the baby was. Todd got the baby back, and told Blair that he was “adopted.” Blair named the child John Cramer Manning, \"Jack\" for short.\n\nNatalie's claims and Natalie's intentions were two different things. Ex-cult member Allison Perkins had actually switched wealthy heiress Jessica Buchanan with Natalie, classless Roxanne's daughter, when Natalie and Jessica were babies. So the Jessica the Buchanans thought they had gotten back was really baby Natalie Balsom! Natalie came to Llanview and worked with her boyfriend Seth Anderson, and her one-time kidnapper Allison, in a scheme to get close to Jessica and Viki. Once Natalie got the Buchanan inheritance that was due her, they would split it and live the life they all felt they deserved. As Seth went through all the motions, he discovered he had true feelings for Jessica!\n\nRoseanne vowed revenge on R.J., as well as Kelly. She enlisted the help of Senora Lena Minta, the voodoo priestess. Roseanne asked Senora Lena to help her put a curse on R.J. Senora Lena asked Roseanne to obtain one of R.J.'s personal items in order for her to craft a voodoo doll of him. Roseanne's manipulation of the R.J. voodoo doll lead to his arrest. However, R.J. struck a deal for immunity in exchange for information that implicated Will as Colin's murderer. Roseanne then asked Lena to help her make Antonio fall in love with her. Lena gave Roseanne a love potion, and Roseanne decided to test it on Kelly. However, Roseanne's plan was foiled when she spilled the potion. Realizing that she and Antonio were truly over, Roseanne left Llanview in June 2001.\n\nJohn was reunited with Rae, who told him that Skye had met her father, Alan Quartermaine, and had decided to stay in Port Charles. Rae felt guilty for not telling John what she had learned about Colin's death. When John found out, he was furious with Rae for withholding the information that Jen confided to her.\n\nCristian and Jen continued to grow closer as Cristian helped Jen through her father's trial.\n\nSeth's odd behavior around Jessica prompted her to confront him, but he evaded her questioning. Seth eventually confessed that he was responsible for Llanfair being set ablaze years earlier. Though it was an accident, Seth had never come forth about his guilt. Jessica forgave Seth, and they even started dating.\n\nLindsay disliked Cristian and thought of him as unsuitable for her daughter. With the help of Chad, a bartender at Break Bar, Lindsay set up a website featuring video clips of Cristian in his loft in his underwear, in order to undermine Cristian and Jen's relationship by making it appear Cristian was flaunting himself over the internet. Eventually, the truth came out, and Jen was furious when she found out what her mother had done. While Cristian felt extremely betrayed by Chad when the truth came out, he realized that Chad was just a pawn in Lindsay's game and forgave him.\n\nIt didn't take long for Gabrielle and Max to feel their old attraction again, and Gabrielle did her part by luring Max to the Buchanan lodge and cheating on Asa. Meanwhile, Asa did his part by catching the affair on videotape. What Gabrielle and Asa hadn't planned was for Gabrielle's guilt got the best of her, resulting in her revealing to Max all the details of Asa's devious plan. The affair was meant to serve as Max's motive for Asa's murder!\n\nGabrielle tried to back out of her plan with Asa, but he wouldn't let her. Asa went ahead and faked his death, leaving both Gabrielle and Max as prime suspects! Commissioner Bo Buchanan was determined to see his father's murderer go to jail, and Gabrielle became more unglued as time went on.\n\nNatalie legally forced Viki to allow her to stay at Llanfair by citing a clause in Victor Lord's will that established any Lord offspring to reside in the mansion. Furthermore, when Viki exposed Natalie to all of Allison's dirty dealings that Allison had failed to mention, Natalie refused to share any of her money with Allison! Natalie refused to see Allison anymore, but Ben still did not completely trust Natalie.\n\nRoxanne Balsom was a simple woman who was always looking to better herself -- financially. Roxy, as her friends call her, earned her meager wages as a croupier at various Atlantic City casinos. All that mattered to Roxy was her money, her beer, and her luck. The last thing on her mind was her daughter Natalie! But Natalie was destined for greater things; being an heiress to the Buchanan wealth, switched at birth with Roxy's real daughter. Roxy's daughter was raised as Jessica Buchanan. Roxy only worried about one thing... how much money she could get out of either of her daughters, biological or otherwise! Allison Perkins needed a new angle if she was to get any money out of the Buchanans, and Roxy was the best angle to play.\n\nBack in Llanview, Rae and John's relationship continued to grow. In August of 2001, John got a job offer in San Francisco. A huge promotion, John took the offer. A couple months later Rae went to see John in San Francisco where he broke up with her, and told her that he was going to be living in San Francisco permanently. A heartbroken Rae went back to Llanview. Rae got help from her many friends in getting over losing John.\n\nKeri Reynolds came to Llanview in August of 2001, looking for her father. She deduced that District Attorney Hank Gannon was her father, since she found money that Hank regularly gave to Keri's mother Elizabeth as support for Keri's upbringing.\n\nWhen Keri confronted Hank over never being a true father to her, Hank denied that he was her father, which infuriated Keri. Keri was stunned to learn that Hank really wasn't her father, Hank's brother RJ was! Keri's mother Elizabeth confided in Hank when she got pregnant by RJ, and swore Hank to secrecy about the pregnancy because RJ was recently sent to prison. Hank decided to support Elizabeth and her baby financially since RJ couldn't be a father to baby Keri. Keri apologized for being so abrasive with Hank, but RJ wasn't so forgiving about being kept in the dark about having fathered a child.\n\nHank had grown closer with Dr. Rae Cummings around that time, and found her very easy to talk to about the drama surrounding RJ and Keri's relationship. Hank could share with Rae his concern about Keri, and felt he could trust her with anything.\n\nNora worried when Dr. Troy MacIver appeared in Llanview at the reading of his murdered twin brother Colin’s will. He did not get a warm reception; Sam Rappaport knocked him out, and Lindsay tried smothering him with a pillow while he was unconscious! Because of his uncanny resemblance to Colin, the citizens of Llanview distrusted him.\n\nTroy wanted to earn Nora’s trust, and his chance came when Matthew, Nora and Sam’s son, was diagnosed with a rare muscle disease. Troy tried an experimental treatment on Matthew and cured him. Nora was thrilled, and a fragile truce was established between Troy and Sam.\n\nColin was publicly blamed for Nora’s memory loss, and Troy became determined to clear Colin’s name and prove for once and for all that Lindsay had given Nora the drug. He gave Nora pills to restore her memory, but she was able to remember everything but the crucial moment when Lindsay pricked her with the needle. Troy hatched a plan to pretend to fall in love with Lindsay, and get her to trust him so she would confess. Nora originally objected to Troy's plan, but he convinced her that her need for the truth about the pain Lindsay had caused was far more important than and pain Lindsay herself might feel.\n\nAsa fled with Nigel to St. Blaze's Island, where Asa returned to using the alias of Captain Jeb Stuart. Unfortunately, Asa's ex, Alex, ran into Asa after attending his funeral in Llanview, and blackmailed Asa into marrying her so that she wouldn't blow his cover! Asa had to think fast, and so he paid a drunken janitor to stumble into their wedding and marry Alex instead! Alex protested, since the legal vows named Jeb Stuart as her husband. Asa surprised Alex by revealing that the janitor had his name legally changed to Jeb Stuart! Fortunately for Max and Gabrielle, Asa was found living well on St. Blaze's!\n\nAntonio met stunning beauty Keri Reynolds when he was her student at Llanview University as he was completing a few credit requirements for his promotion in the Llanview Police Department. Antonio and Keri couldn't help but feel the attraction between them. Chad was briefly hired by RJ to follow Keri and find out more about her.\n\nCristian was working undercover for the police to get evidence to put RJ Gannon away. Lindsay found out and told RJ was Cris was up to, and RJ sent a hit man, Keith Schaeffer, after him. When Cristian evaded him, Keith went after Jen. Jen thought he was just another friendly student on campus, but she got suspicious when he kept popping up everywhere she went. Cristian was alarmed, and decided to break up with Jen to protect her from the man that was after him.\n\nJen knew nothing about the hit man and was heartbroken, thinking Cristian just decided to dump her. Jen turned to Al Holden, who loved her, and the two made love. When Keith was apprehended, Cristian rescued her and told her the truth, prompting Jen to break things off with Al and return to Cristian.\n\n2002\n\nJen missed her period and thought she was pregnant, and Cristian was hurt. Leaving in a rage to find Al, Cristian was gone before Jen found out she really wasn't pregnant.\n\nCristian and Al fought and Al accidentally fell over the edge of a cliff at the quarry, resulting in Al being paralyzed from the waist down. Jen, since they were fighting over her, swore she would stand by Al until he could walk again. Realizing Jen would leave him if he regained the ability to walk, Al decided to fake paralysis until she realized he was the right man for her. Devious Natalie Buchanan found out about Al's scheme and decided to blackmail him over it!\n\nStarr whined for months about wanting a baby brother, but when she finally got one in little Jack Manning, she didn't want one anymore! All Jack did was cry and sleep and take all the attention away from Starr! Starr gradually warmed up to her little brother, and even saved him from a poisonous spider that found its way into his crib!\n\nWhen Antonio and RJ both realized their connection to Keri, Antonio and RJ's animosity almost destroyed Antonio and Keri's relationship, but Keri was able to keep a tentative peace between the two most important men in her life.\n\nWhen Asa was brought back to Llanview, he was punished for his duplicities, and sentenced to community service to be worked off at Ben's clinic, as well as court-appointed therapy with Rae Cummings, a \"quack\" that Asa couldn't stand! Asa fought back by punishing Gabrielle. Asa ended their marriage and threw Gabrielle out of his mansion, penniless and alone.\n\nBo took pity on Gabrielle, realizing she was manipulated a great deal by Asa, and let Gabrielle move in with him. As time went on, Bo began enjoying their time together. Asa was furious to see Gabrielle getting her hooks into Bo, and tried all he could to get Bo to give Gabrielle the boot, but to no avail.\n\nPaloma turned up in Llanview, attempting to tell Blair the truth about baby Jack, but Todd tricked Paloma into thinking Blair already knew, and Paloma left town. David Vickers seized the opportunity and blackmailed Todd into giving him money or he would tell Blair everything. Todd tricked David into meeting him at the waterfront and had the Moroccan police arrest him. David was hauled away, but not before he told Todd what he thought of him.\n\nRJ secretly tried numerous times to throw a wrench into his daughter Keri's relationship with Antonio, including hiring one of Keri's students to claim Keri carried on an improper relationship with Antonio while he was her student. Even though they waited until Antonio was out of her class before they became involved, the claims of the student nearly destroyed Keri's career. Fortunately, Keri's co-worker, Rae Cummings, vouched for Keri's adherence to University rules and regulations, and the charges against Keri were dismissed.\n\nAfter a lengthy seduction, Troy finally proposed to Lindsay and the two were scheduled to fly off to Paris for their wedding. Troy purchased an old funhouse outside of town, with fake mirrors that led to secret mazes. Pretending to be Colin, Troy lured Lindsay to the funhouse to “rescue Troy”. Lindsay confessed, and the confession was taped. Lindsay found out it was a trap and hit Troy over the head with a crowbar, then chained him to a huge wheel. Days passed, and Troy still refused to tell her where the tape of her confession was. Nora found the tape at Lindsay's art gallery, and Nora and Lindsay fought over it, even ending up in a trash compactor together! Nora emerged with the tape. Lindsay was arrested and sentenced to 28 years in Statesville prison. When Nora admitted she was starting to have feelings for Troy, Sam broke up with Nora and she and Troy began dating.\n\nWhile trying to deal with the shock that Natalie, not Jessica, was her daughter, Viki began seeing visions of Niki Smith, who taunted Viki about how Viki didn't realize all those years ago that the baby she got back wasn't the same baby that was taken from her. Niki hinted around some terrible secret that Viki would never be strong enough to know about. Viki kept the visions of Niki a secret from Ben, and met with Rae. Viki asked Rae to hypnotize her and bring Niki out, in order to get Niki to reveal the secret. Rae brought Niki out, but even Rae didn't realize Niki never went back in!\n\nAllison and Roxy saw their chance when trusting Jessica Buchanan showed an interest in getting to know Roxy. Allison began scheming with Roxy to get money from Jessica by pretending Roxy had a severe illness. Once Jessica gave Roxy money for the medical bills, they planned to split the earnings and skip town. But Jessica's boyfriend Seth Anderson learned the truth and exposed their plan to Jessica. In order to keep them from going to the police, Allison followed them in her car and ran them off the road. Believing that they were dead, Allison framed Roxanne for the accident and left town.\n\nRoxanne swore she didn't run Jessica and Seth off the road, and Jessica and Seth believed her. They decided to hatch a plan to get Allison back to Llanview. When Allison read in the newspaper that Jessica was going to give Roxanne $100,000, she headed back to Llanview to get her share of the money from Roxanne. Unfortunately for Allison, the police had bugged Roxanne without her knowledge, and when Allison admitted that she had been the one to run Jessica and Seth off the road, she was arrested and sent to Statesville prison.\n\nNatalie had been in love with Seth Anderson, but Seth left her for her sister Jessica Buchanan. Natalie had Al pretend to be Seth in order to frame Seth for cheating on Jessica. Al felt guilty over deceiving Jessica, who'd been a friend of his since childhood, but he went along with it so as not to lose Jen.\n\nGabrielle and Max each found out about Al being able to walk, and pleaded with him to come clean to Jen, arguing that Jen would stay with him no matter what if she really loved him. Al refused, and even proposed to Jen from his wheelchair. Jen agreed, still riddled with guilt over his paralysis. Al and Jen's marriage was not to be, because Natalie told Cristian about Al's plot and Cristian interrupted the wedding with the truth!\n\nBlair noticed that Jack looked a lot like Starr did when Starr was a baby. Todd claimed that all babies look the same. Jack fell ill and needed a bone marrow transplant, much like Starr did when she was a baby, and Todd raced to figure out how to save his son's life without tipping Blair off to Jack's real identity.\n\nTodd tracked down Alex Olanov, who had donated her bone marrow to save Starr several years before, and got her to agree to donate to save Jack. Todd was able to get the transplant done in secret while Blair was out of town, but a message that Alex left for Blair about the transplant started the house of cards tumbling down.\n\nOnce Blair learned that her \"adopted\" son was really the baby Todd told her had died, Blair threw Todd out and swore to never let him near either of his children ever again. Blair hired security to keep Todd at a distance, but her head guard, Ross Rayburn, happened to be on Todd's payroll!\n\nTéa Delgado, Todd's ex, returned to Llanview for a brief visit in May 2002. While she was there, she visited Carlotta at the diner and learned that Todd and Blair had broken up. Téa went to visit Todd, but he rudely kicked her out. A few days later, Todd tracked Téa down and asked for her help keeping custody of his children. Téa turned him down, but Todd insisted she would help him because she's still in love with him.\n\nWhile on vacation in Hawaii, Ross tipped off Todd, who made plans to kidnap Jack and Starr and disappear with them. Todd enlisted the help of his ex-wife Téa, but Téa doublecrossed him and warned Blair about Todd's kidnapping plot. Blair took the children, and Todd ended up washing ashore on a deserted island, only to be stranded there for months with Ross and Téa!\n\nFree to be together, Keri and Antonio savored every moment. Keri faced Antonio's disapproving mother, Carlotta, who had her own issues with RJ, but Keri proved herself to be worthy of Carlotta's son.\n\nRoxanne was cleared and decided to celebrate at the casinos in Atlantic City. While there, Roxy ran into an old acquaintance, Max Holden, who was depressed over a falling out with his son Al. Roxy took advantage of Max's drinking binge and lured him to the chapel to get married. Roxy even had the forethought to make Max sign an iron-clad pre-nuptial agreement that would leave Roxy with all of Max's money if he dared divorce her.\n\nRoxy really did love Max, and tried everything she could think of to make herself a better person -- a person Max could love back. Roxy's chances at winning Max over were threatened when her son Rex came to Llanview! Rex had been taken away from Roxy when he was a child, by his aunt Corinne, Roxy's sister-in-law. Rex knew Roxy's deepest secret; the fact that she'd never given birth to a baby girl... Rex was her only child!\n\nWith Lindsay behind bars, Troy was tormented by memories of his late wife Joanna. Troy's sister Emily came to Llanview in June 2002, and Emily knew that Troy had suffered through a serious trauma with Joanna in Africa. Emily reassured Troy that what happened to Joanna was not Troy's fault and that he had no way of preventing what befell her.\n\nIn Statesville, Lindsay's cellmate became Allison Perkins, the kidnapper of babies Jessica and Natalie Buchanan. Lindsay was determined to escape, and since Allison was the daughter of the former warden of the prison, she knew a secret tunnel to get out. The only problem was that Allison didn't want to leave prison, the guards were kind to her and gave her special priveledges and there was nothing waiting for her on the outside.\n\nKeri and Antonio went on vacation to Hawaii in the summer of 2002, where Antonio planned to propose. But Keri had her own plans in mind. Keri had been given an old camera by Rae, and one of the old pictures she developed was of a young Rae and a man Rae identified as \"Mark,\" the love of her life. Keri found out that Rae attended the University of Hawaii with him, and set out to find Mark and reunite Rae with her former flame.\n\nAntonio noticed a hole in Rae's story about \"Mark,\" since the love story Rae told Keri was really about the affair Rae had had with Dr. Alan Quartermaine, a doctor in Port Charles, New York. Keri and Antonio decided to get to the bottom of the discrepancy, and went to the University of Hawaii looking for records on Mark. Looking through old college yearbooks, Keri found Mark's picture, but the name on the man's picture was Ray Cummings!\n\nChad had stars in his eyes when it came to Blair Cramer Manning, a stunningly beautiful older woman who often enjoyed a drink at Break Bar. When Blair was hurting over her husband Todd's latest dirty deeds at the time, a drunken Blair threw herself at Chad and they almost made love in the alley behind Break Bar! Blair's friend Sam Rappaport interrupted them before Blair went too far, and Chad realized he almost took advantage of her. Chad apologized.\n\nCharming Rex Balsom was fortunate not to have been raised by Roxanne. When Rex was a young boy, he was taken by his Aunt Corinne to live in Michigan, away from the neglectful Roxanne. Rex missed his big sister Natalie, who Corinne had left behind. Rex came to Llanview in 2002 when he found out that the sister he knew in his childhood, Natalie, was really a wealthy Buchanan heiress switched at birth with Jessica Buchanan, Rex's true biological sister. Always looking to further himself, he set out for Llanview to reunite with Natalie, and buddy up to Jessica.\n\nRex didn't expect Jessica's boyfriend Seth to be suspicious of him right off the bat. Seth pegged Rex for the fortune-hunter he was, and when Seth found newspaper clippings that proved Rex knew about the baby switch before coming to Llanview, he accused Rex of using Jessica for her money.\n\nCrafty Rex covered for himself, claiming that he didn't want Jessica to know that he was aware of the baby switch, because she would assume that he was after her money. Jessica trusted Rex and dumped Seth, even though she did let Rex move into Llanfair with her and paid his college tuition at Llanview University.\n\nRae was warned from Hawaii that Keri and Antonio were snooping around the University, and Rae flew to Hawaii to cover her tracks. Keri confronted Rae, and Rae was crushed that her friend had dug up the painful truth. Rae only lost out on her own degree because she became too personally involved with her patients; she cared too much. Seeing Ray throw away his misspelled diploma seemed like a chance for Rae to help people like she always wanted to. Keri was sorry that she'd exposed Rae's fraudulence, because Rae truly didn't mean any harm.\n\nKeri and Antonio visited Ray Cummings, where they learned the whole ugly truth: Keri's friend Rae wasn't really a doctor at all; she stole a misspelled diploma that Ray had received, and then the former Gretel Cummings changed her middle name to \"Rae\" to match the misspelled doctorate degree. Rae had been practicing without a license for years!\n\nUnbeknownst to Ben, Viki's alter ego Niki was now pretending to be Viki. But Niki wanted to be free of having to pretend to be \"boring\" Viki and decided the first thing she must do was get rid of Ben, permanently. She came up with a plan to make her daughter, Natalie believe she had Disassociative Identity Disorder and that one of Natalie's alters killed Ben, when it would be Niki Smith who really did away with him. Ben figured out what was going on and confronted Niki Smith, but Niki pushed him out of a window and made it look as if Natalie had done it. Ben recovered, but couldn't remember who pushed him out the window.\n\nLindsay convinced Allison that Ben Davidson, or, as Allison calls him, \"Dave\", was in danger of Niki Smith and needed Allison to save him. Allison agreed to help Lindsay after Lindsay blackmailed RJ Gannon into providing them with a getaway car and safe house. Allison showed Lindsay the passage and the two of them escaped through the tunnel.\n\nWhen Natalie was found out for having Al pretend to be Seth in order to frame Seth for cheating on Jessica, she was further alienated from Jessica and Seth, and finally realized she couldn't force Seth to love her. Natalie leaned on her friend Cristian Vega while she came to terms with losing Seth for good, and was surprised when she started fantasizing about him. The only problem was; Cristian was involved with Jen Rappaport. In time, Cristian's feelings grew into love for Natalie as well, and they realized they felt the same way about each other.\n\nAl refused to give up on Jen, even though she had reunited with Cristian once again. Al was able to rebuild his friendship with Jen, but he still knew he was better for her than Cristian would ever be. Al even set fire to Jen's house in order to rescue her! Gabrielle found out that Al had become an arsonist and helped him cover his tracks because she didn't want to see him suffer through prison like she did years before. Gabrielle even lied to the man she loved, Police Commissioner Bo Buchanan, to cover for Al. Bo found out about the arson, but didn't arrest him as long as Al agreed to an \"unofficial\" community service. Bo and Gabrielle patched things up, and Gabrielle was once again walking the straight and narrow.\n\nChad was again smitten when he met sweet Emily MacIver. They enjoyed a few dates, but Chad's checkered past came back to haunt him when gossip at Llanview University reached Emily. Once Emily learned about the webcam in Cristian's apartment, and then the incident with the married Blair in the alley, Chad's dirty dealings were too much for Emily to overlook, and she broke off their blossoming relationship.\n\nRae had been treating Asa Buchanan in court-appointed therapy sessions. Rae challenged Asa, and argued that Asa felt weak and powerless. Asa fought back, telling Rae about all the dirty, illegal dealings that he took part in to amass his fortune. Rae was disgusted, but she couldn't tell the authorities because of doctor-patient confidentiality. Asa was thrilled when he uncovered the truth, and turned Rae's dark secret into a media blitz, encouraging all of Llanview to sue Rae for every penny she was worth!\n\nOverwhelmed with lawsuits and negative media attention, Rae decided to fight back, and decided to use her taped therapy session with Asa to blackmail Asa into marriage! Rae was no longer bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, since she wasn't a licensed doctor, and threatened to expose Asa for all his illegal dealings if he didn't marry her, pay all her legal bills, and settle all her lawsuits. On August 26, 2002, Asa reluctantly married Rae, and Renee's heart was broken! Rae was her best friend, and Renee had actually considered getting back together with Asa again.\n\nRJ ironically hid Lindsay and Allison in Rae Cummings's house, which had been taken away from Rae when it was revealed that Rae was practicing without a legal license. Roxanne inadvertenly stumbled upon Allison's hideout and Allison ended up kidnapping both Roxanne and Niki Smith. Feeling the cops closing in, Allison and Lindsay took Niki Smith to the Buchanan lodge and Allison debated whether to use her one remaining bullet on Lindsay or Niki.\n\nWhen Ben began to remember Niki pushing him out the window, Niki had been taken hostage by Allison Perkins up at the Buchanan lodge. Before Allison could kill anyone, college student Mollie Serafin stumbled upon the hostage situation, and Allison was going to use the bullet on her. Lindsay talked Allison into not shooting Mollie, and then the police captured Allison and she was sent back to a padded room at St. Ann's. Ben arrived on the scene with the police, and was accidentally shot by officer Antonio Vega. Viki emerged again, just in time to watch Ben slip into a seemingly irreversable coma. Viki transferred Ben to a clinic in Switzerland that could best care for him, and took sessions with Susannah Hanen to get to the bottom of Niki's secret.\n\nMollie was the daughter of the Governor, and since Lindsay saved a young woman's life, Lindsay was pardoned from her sentence and set free. It was not long after when Lindsay overheard Troy and Emily discussing Joanna, Troy's wife, which led Lindsay to investigate. Lindsay traveled to Africa and uncovered the truth, and began holding it over Troy's head, threatening to tell Nora what he'd done and ruin their relationship!\n\nAl was all too happy to oblige when Jen sought comfort from him in bed after a fight with Cristian. Little did Al know that Jen was actually trying to get pregnant by Al in order to trap Cristian with the child! Jen found out that Cristian had fallen in love with Natalie and plotted to use Al's baby to keep Cristian and Natalie apart. Jen did get pregnant, but kept it a secret from Al.\n\nWhen Antonio accidentally shot bystander Ben Davidson while trying to get a hostage situation under control, Antonio was devastated when Ben went into a seemingly permanent coma. Antonio left Llanview to get his head together, and had a one-night stand with a blond stranger at a roadside motel. Antonio told Keri about his indiscretion, and Keri understood that Antonio was in a very bad place and it was only a one-time thing.\n\nKeri visited her mother Liz in Chicago. Liz was mourning the death of her husband Steve in Africa before making her way back to the United States. Once she was back on American soil, Liz met a mysterious man at a motel who was at a crossroads in his own life. They ended up seeking comfort from each other in bed, and decided not to exchange names.\n\nLiz was both shocked and thrilled to learn she had become pregnant. She had been trying for years with Steve, but to no avail. Unfortunately, because of a heart condition, Liz wouldn't be able to carry her baby to term. Liz contacted the woman who agreed to be her surrogate, but the woman backed out at the last minute. When Keri visited Liz and learned of her mother's problem, Keri volunteered to carry her mother's child to term. Although Liz was reluctant to allow Keri to do that, Liz ultimately agreed.\n\nOnce the procedure was finished, Liz moved to Llanview with Keri and met Keri's fiancee Antonio. Liz was shocked to find that Antonio was the man she had slept with that night at the motel! Liz and Antonio decided Keri would be crushed to learn the truth about their night together, and vowed not to tell her.\n\nCristian decided to tell Jen that he was leaving her for Natalie, but Jen had news for Cristian first -- she was pregnant! Jen decided that she would get back at Cristian, Natalie, and even Al, for hurting her by trapping Cristian in a marriage and forcing Natalie to watch from a distance! Jen befriended Natalie and even asked Natalie to be her maid of honor at the wedding. Natalie and Cristian were tormented by the feelings they couldn't act on, but Jen wasn't satisfied. Jen feared that guilt wouldn't keep Natalie and Cristian apart for long and tried to get Natalie to leave town. Natalie refused and Jen moved the wedding date up.\n\nEager to escape from his latest hellish marriage, Asa noticed the feelings that Rae and Hank Gannon had for one another. He even had Nigel lock Rae and Hank in the wine cellar together, but when passion didn't ignite, Asa had to find a new plan. Noticing that Max was in a similar unhappy situation with his wife Roxanne, Asa proposed that he and Max help get rid of each other's wives!\n\nAsa started to charm Roxy, hoping to woo her away from Max, despite Max's greater understanding of why Roxy was the way she was. When Asa's wife Rae told Roxanne of Max and Asa's scheme, Roxy left Max and took a large portion of his money with her! Unfortunately, Roxy also took on most of Max's debts!\n\nRoss had been on the run from embezzlement charges and was scared that the authorities had tracked him down. The three sailed into a storm which ended up marooning them on a deserted island in the south pacific! Todd built a raft that could hold two people, in order to head back to the United States, but Téa knew Todd had a slim chance of survival if he tried to make it on the open seas. Téa decided to stay with Ross on the island, and if Todd survived, he was to send help for Ross and Téa. Téa and Ross were later rescued, though they didn't return to Llanview.\n\nTodd made his way back to Llanview, and was determined to get both of his children back, whether Blair decided to be a part of that family or not! Blair moved on with Sam while Todd was on the deserted island, and Sam helped her to legally protect her children from Todd. But danger found Blair in another way.\n\nSeth set out to find out more about Rex, and traveled to Michigan to dig up dirt on him. There, he discovered that Roxanne never even gave birth to a baby girl! Rex wasn't Jessica's brother! In fact, Rex was Roxanne's only child! The truth was that Jessica and Natalie were fraternal twins born to Viki and Clint Buchanan. After Jessica got her mother Viki back, Jessica was so grateful to Seth that she reunited with him.size=2>Rex was able to hide the fact that he knew all along that he was Roxanne's only child! He was even more determined to keep it a secret that he was holding it over his own mother's head and blackmailing her with it!\n\nWhen the truth about Jessica and Natalie was exposed, Viki was relieved that Jessica and Natalie were both her biological daughters. But Viki decided that she and Bo must figure out why Mitch Laurence had Allison switch twin girls!\n\nMarcie Walsh, a trusting, optimistic, and some would say a naive soul, was first seen in October 2002 when Jen was in dire need of an ally. Marcie was absolutely awed by Jen, since Jen was the popular girl at Llanview University, so beautiful, so smart, and, in Marcie's eyes, so deserving of anything Jen wanted. All Marcie wanted was to be Jen's friend, and when Jen saw what Marcie could do for her, Jen quickly formed a friendship with her. Marcie was an assistant to an obstetrician at Llanview Hospital, and Jen needed Marcie to change the due date of her pregnancy to make Cristian believe the child was his.\n\nAl caught on to Jen's scheme and just needed proof that Jen was carrying his baby. Al had already realized that Cristian loved Natalie, and thought that if Jen was really carrying his baby it was only a matter of time until Jen realized Al was the right man for her. Jen managed to change her baby's due date with help from Marcie. Al wasn't entirely convinced that it wasn't his child, and suspected that Jen had convinced Marcie to lie for her. All Al had to do was prove that the due date was faked.\n\nAntonio became worried that the child Keri was carrying for Liz was actually his child! Liz lied to Antonio, swearing that she was pregnant before their night together, but Antonio wasn't sure about believing her. Liz confided in Hank yet again about her baby's father's identity, and Hank was upset to be asked to keep another secret that promised to devastate several lives. At the same time, RJ was still bitter over Liz shutting him out of Keri's life from day one, and was suspicious at the sight of Liz and Antonio together. RJ could potentially uncover the true connection between Liz and Antonio!\n\nIn October 2002, a man named Michael Lazarus turned up in Llanview after it was revealed that Viki had given birth to twin girls Jessica and Natalie, and that one of the girls had been stolen at birth and given to the low-class Roxanne Balsom to raise. Allison Perkins had switched the two girls, and the only question remaining was \"why?\"\n\nMichael looked startlingly like Mitch Laurence, and he offered a shoulder for the innocent Natalie to cry on when she was having romantic problems with the man she loved, Cristian Vega. Natalie was unaware of the entire Mitch Laurence debacle, and would have been the perfect target if Michael Lazarus was indeed a resurrected Mitch.\n\nNatalie married Mitch when she believed she and Cristian would never be able to be together. When Natalie brought Michael home to meet Viki, it was then Natalie realized that she'd married the very monster who masterminded the Natalie/Jessica baby switch in the first place!\n\nBlair had recently done an exposé on a crime syndicate in The Sun, and angered mob boss, O'Brien. O'Brien even sent a hitman to kill Blair for naming names in the newspaper, but the hitman mistakenly killed the family Nanny, Suzanne, instead. Blair witnessed the shooting, which made things considerably more dangerous for her.\n\nAl read Marcie's journal, in which she detailed all of Jen's brilliant plotting, but the wedding was interrupted by Jen doubling over in pain! Jen lost the baby, and Marcie was there to help Jen through the tough time. Jen recovered, and teamed with the evil Mitch Laurence to get revenge on Cristian and Natalie. Mitch married Natalie under false pretenses, and Natalie wanted to leave Mitch for Cristian once she realized what a monster Mitch was. Marcie worried about Jen getting involved with Mitch, but Jen was determined to exact her revenge.\n\nRex Balsom grew comfortable with living the high life and used his wealth to seduce various ladies around the Llanview University campus! Unfortunately, Rex's free ride at the Buchanans came to an abrupt halt when Jessica learned of his duplicity.\n\nMitch had one more shocker for Viki: He was Jessica's biological father! Mitch admitted that he drugged Viki one night, and they conceived Jessica that same night. Furthermore, Mitch entered the delivery room after Viki gave birth to both Natalie and Jessica, and Viki was apparently so horrified to learn Mitch fathered Jessica that she sat idly by as Mitch walked away with Jessica in his arms! Mitch's retelling of the events jogged Viki's memory, and she was mortified to recall every detail.\n\nViki had Seth take Jessica out of town to protect her from the truth that Mitch Laurence was her father. Jessica caught on to the fact that Seth was lying to her, and finally broke up with him and returned home to demand Viki to tell her everything. Jessica couldn't find Viki, but Mitch found Jessica. It was then that Mitch revealed to Jessica the shocking truth.\n\n2003\n\nJessica was mortified as well to learn that Mitch was her father, and not Clint, as she'd always thought. Mitch wanted nothing more than to be a father to her, but Jessica refused to ever let him be a part of her life. Mitch was slightly comforted, however, when Jessica shut Viki out of her life, claiming that she'd never be more to Viki than a reminder of what Mitch did to her all those years ago. Despite Viki's insistance to the contrary, Jessica couldn't believe that Viki would ever love her the way she used to, and Jessica left town, leaving Viki heartbroken.\n\nMitch goaded Cristian into punching him, and then had Cristian arrested for assault. Then, Jen lied in order to aid the judge in deciding to put Cristian away. Jen and Marcie delighted in the fallout, but Jen eventually had an attack of remorse and told the truth. Jen realized what an evil man Mitch was, and Marcie helped Jen break into Mitch's home to find some incriminating evidence against him. Jen found medical records Mitch had under lock and key, on Jessica and Natalie Buchanan. Mitch came home and found Jen, and when he attempted to strangle her with a scarf, she escaped and ran out into a blizzard, and nearly froze to death! Fortunately, Al found her and brought her to the hospital where she recovered.\n\nTodd hid Blair in his penthouse for weeks as he wormed his way back into Blair's affections. Blair ended her relationship with Sam and agreed to marry Todd again, especially when Todd gave her the wonderful news that all of O'Brien's men had been caught and it was safe for Blair to reclaim her life.\n\nSam, however, wasn't so willing to trust Todd, and he uncovered the truth that Todd had set up the entire O'Brien ordeal in order to win Blair back! Sam proved it by bringing the very much alive Suzanne to Todd and Blair's next wedding! Blair, devastated once more by Todd's lies and deceptions, broke things off again with Todd, and took Starr and Jack back to Dorian's old mansion.\n\nTroy began sleeping with Lindsay to keep her quiet about what happened to Joanna. Troy and Lindsay's affair continued, and once Nora discovered their trysts, she ended things with Troy. Backed into a corner, Troy admitted the whole ugly truth to Nora.\n\nTroy admitted that Joanna was his wife in Africa, and when her flirtatiousness drove Troy mad with jealousy, he tricked Joanna into thinking she'd slept with Colin (though she'd only really slept with her own husband, Troy). Joanna was so horrified at \"cheating\" on her husband, that she ended up falling off a cliff to her death. Sadly, Nora could have gotten past the truth about Joanna, but could not get past Troy's sleeping with Lindsay. With nothing left to lose, Troy became bent on revenge against Lindsay.\n\nIn February 2003, Viki got a glimmer of hope when her younger son Joey returned home to Llanview. Joey became Reverend Andrew Carpenter's new curate, and was assigned by Andrew to reach out to the troubled youths at the community center in Angel Square. Viki was glad that Joey planned to become a minister, since it balanced the evil that Mitch Laurence brought back into Viki's life. Viki was thrilled when Jessica also returned to Llanview. Visiting Clint helped Jessica to get her head together and realize Viki would always love her, no matter what.\n\nMarcie was thrilled when Carlotta Vega gave her a job waiting tables at the D-K Diner. She started her new job in February of 2003, when \"the storm of the century\" struck Llanview. The Diner brought Marcie many new opportunities. She discovered the sexy voice of a new deejay on the radio, \"the Voice of the Night.\" Also, Marcie met attractive Joey Buchanan, Jessica Buchanan's older brother. Marcie was instantly smitten.\n\nAl Holden, over his fixation on Jen Rappaport, worked to get some direction back into his life. The rest of his life wasn't going so well anyway -- he was flunking most of his classes at Llanview University! Unable to stay up for the amount of hours he needed to study, Al turned to pills to keep him energized.\n\nRJ was still bitter over Liz shutting him out of Keri's life from day one, and was suspicious at the sight of Liz and Antonio together. Eventually RJ learned that truth and planned to tell his daughter, but Antonio decided that he needed to be the one to reveal the truth. He told Keri, who was devastated and went into premature labor. She gave birth to a baby girl, Jamie, named for RJ (Randall James).\n\nIn February 2003, a teenage runaway named Flash turned up in Llanview, and on the job, Joey (who had become a curate) took a particular interest in her. The more he tried to help Flash, the more she resisted, and the more Joey wanted to figure out why she was so protective of herself. Flash revealed that she knew Joey's cousin CJ, and was determined to find him.\n\nThe evil Mitch Laurence tried to kidnap Starr, when Blair found him and convinced him to take her instead. Mitch kidnapped Blair in order to use her to bargain with Todd. Todd, in an effort to get Blair back safely, agreed to find and kidnap Natalie and trade her for Blair. Todd did find and kidnap Natalie, but Natalie agreed to go along with Todd's plan to get everyone away from Mitch safely. Unfortunately, the plot went awry, Todd accidentally shot Cristian, and Mitch made off with Natalie!\n\nMitch drugged Natalie and dyed her hair light blond. He then brought Natalie to a secluded clinic where he introduced her as \"Jessica\" to an ailing but alive Victor Lord! Somehow, Victor Lord hadn't died as Llanview had long thought. But Victor was close to dying if he didn't get a heart transplant -- one that Mitch planned to facilitate using Natalie's strong, young heart!\n\nViki and Jessica tracked Mitch to the clinic, where Viki was horrified to find her monstrous father alive! Once the ailing Victor was transferred to Llanview Hospital. There, Viki had the chance to do what she'd wanted the chance to do for years: confront her father over his abuse. Unfortunately, Victor never admitted to the abuse he put Viki through before Victor's black heart finally failed.\n\nEvangeline Williamson, a formidable and confident lawyer, came to town in 2003 as Mitch Laurence's counsel. Despite the reprehensible nature of her client, many in Llanview saw that she was a brilliant attorney and sought her counsel on different matters.\n\nNeeding a new direction for her life, Nora took a job as Llanview's Assistant District Attorney.\n\nNeeding to support the lifestyle to which he'd become accustomed, Rex took a job at the Palace, working for Renee Divine as a bartender and bellhop. But Rex wasn't working there for the wages, he was there to steal from the guests' rooms!\n\nThe doctors revealed stunning information to Keri that they had just discovered -- Jamie was actually Antonio's baby with Keri! She was already pregnant when they attempted to act as a surrogate for her mother, which was not a success. Keri kept the news from Antonio and, protective of his daughter and granddaughter, RJ encouraged them to get away from Antonio. Soon, the news of Keri, Liz and baby Jamie's death in a plane crash broke. Keri and Jamie survived the plane crash, however, and were secretly living in Canada.\n\nAntonio was devastated at the loss of Keri and his daughter, and leaned on Jessica Buchanan, who knew what it was like to lose a child. Jessica had also just gained a father in Mitch Laurence, but the mad violence Mitch bought to Jessica's life served to bring Jessica and Antonio closer together, and they soon fell in love.\n\nWhile Mitch's lawyer, Evangeline Williamson, was able to spare Mitch jailtime for his crimes, Mitch worked to be a real father to Jessica, despite Jessica's resistance. Mitch got wind of Lindsay Rappaport's unrequited love of Troy MacIver, and decided to twist it to suit his own purposes. Mitch was out to destroy Todd Manning, and wanted to frame Todd for murder. Mitch stole Todd's gun and gave it to Lindsay, and then sent her to Blair Cramer's home, where Mitch convinced Lindsay that Troy was seducing Blair. An unbalanced Lindsay saw a man leaning over Blair's bed, and shot him in the back, only then to see that she'd shot and killed Sam Rappaport, not Troy! Nora and Matthew were devastated when Sam was killed with the bullet meant for Troy. Blair was then devastated when it appeared Mitch had killed Todd, but Blair couldn't prove it.\n\nJen was devastated by the March 2003 death of her father, and shaken even more to realize that her mother pulled the trigger! It was clear that Lindsay had become unbalanced, and Jen fortunately had the support of her brother Will when Lindsay was sent to St. Ann's Sanitarium.\n\nNeeding funds again, Roxy turned to Asa for financial support in realizing her dream: \"Foxy Roxy's Hair Haven\", a beauty parlor! Asa and Nigel worked closely with Roxy during the construction of the Salon, and Roxy got involved when Asa demanded Nigel kick his cigarette habit. Roxy suggested hypnosis by her old Atlantic City pal, Mysterio. Mysterio proved his talents at hypnosis when he hypnotized Nigel and Roxy into falling in love! The simple utterance of the word \"bourbon\" would trigger the amorous instincts in the unlikely pair. Once the spell was broken, Roxy and Nigel formed a close friendship.\n\nGabrielle was tested by a letter that had the potential to ruin Gabrielle's future with Bo permanently; a letter that revealed Bo was Matthew Hanen Rappaport's father! When Sam Rappaport was accidentally shot and killed, a letter was delivered revealing that a clerical error named Sam as Matthew's father, when in fact Bo was the true father!
