He married the love of his life, Maxine Gail Kokott (bride) on March 21, 1970 in Richfield Utah.\n\nWally served in many different roles within Sanpete County. Wally owned and operated Buchanan Mortuary where he served the community with compassion. He served the citizens of Sanpete County for 45 years in several different roles including; Sheriff, Chief Deputy, Deputy, Emergency Management Director during the floods of 1983 and Search and Rescue. At the time of his death he was still serving the citizens as a bailiff for the sixth district courts.\n\nWally spent 23 years in the Utah National Guard where he retired as a Captain of the 1457 engineer battalion. He loved his country and serving for his fellow man.\n\nWally was an avid outdoors man. He loved to hunt and fish with his friends and family. Every chance he got, he would be up the mountain on his side by side, four-wheeler or truck enjoying life.\n\nEven with all these achievements and roles his greatest pride and joy was his family. He was so proud of all of their accomplishments. He loved bringing his family together to spend quality time barbequing, Dutch oven cooking, camping, fireworks and spending time with his grandchildren.\n\nThe world will remember Wally not only because of his giant personality but also his big heart and hugs. Wally was a loving giant with a sweet spirit and contagious smile. He was admired and respected by many. We will miss him greatly until we are together again.\n\nWally had a joyful reunion when he was greeted by his parents; his brother, Darrell Buchanan; brothers-in-law: Boyd Olsen and Wallace Nunley; his many friends along, with all those he served who have passed before him. He is survived by his bride Gail; children: Troy Buchanan, Manti; Teresa Mitchell, Manti; Craig (Erin) Buchanan, Ephraim; Brock (Natalie) Buchanan, Spanish Fork; Andrea (Levi) Hemmer, Boise, ID; Jared (Traci) Buchanana, Manti; 11 grandchildren; siblings: Ruby Nunley, Moroni; Jean (Les) Larsen, Gunnison; Jerry (Jack) Steck, Ephraim; Duane (Viola) Buchanan, Loa; R.
