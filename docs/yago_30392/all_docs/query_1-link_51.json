        "text": "Bo/Nora/Clint/Matthew/Destiny: Matthew was paralyzed due to a car accident caused by Cole. Matthew sued his parents to get permission to consent to having back surgery. He won, but Bo and Nora tried to turn the tables on him by shipping him to a boarding school in London. Soon after, Matthew met Tea's secret daughter, Danielle, said goodbye to best friend Destiny, and the two escaped to Seattle so he could have his operation and Danielle could get in touch with her father (or who she thinks is her father) Ross. Bo and Nora, meanwhile, have declared their love for one another after all these years even though Nora's married to Clint.\n\nTodd/Blair/Tea/Ross: Blair, burned by John breaking up with her, began scheming to get Todd back in her life. After scheming (and flirting) with Ross, Tea's husband, Blair learned that Tea and Ross had a child... who was really Todd's! Todd found out that Tea was married to Ross and dumped her and is currently on the verge of learning the truth about Danielle.\n\nJessica/Natalie/Brody/Jared/John: Jessica and Natalie were alarmed when Nash seemed to be trying to communicate with Jessica from the grave. Brody and John began to investigate the strange occurrences and were shocked when the evidence pointed to Jared being behind the strange events. After Jared disappeared, Jessica and Natalie were lured to Napa, where they were reunited with Jared, Nash's corpse... and a very much alive Mitch Laurence!\n\nRex/Gigi/Stacy/Kim/Schuyler: Rex slept with Gigi's sister Stacy after months of being manipulated and got her pregnant. Stacy miscarried and scrambled to get pregnant again. She found fertile ground in Oliver Fish, who slept with her in a drunken stupor. Stacy's best friend Kim came to town to help Stacy break up Rex and Gigi, while Gigi began to grow strong feelings toward Schuyler. In the middle of all the drama, Rex has just learned that Mitch Laurence is his father!\n\nRachel/Shaun/Greg: Rachel began casually dating Shaun and was having a nice time, until she met his hotshot doctor brother Greg, who believed he could help Matthew walk again. Greg immediately got under Rachel's skin and the two eventually kissed - just as Shaun was shot while protecting the Cramers from a break-in! Greg operated on Shaun, who was left comatose, and vowed never to perform surgery again. Shaun miraculously woke up and was devastated when Rachel dumped him... for Greg!\n\nChristian/Layla/Kyle/Fish: Christian, Layla and Fish became cautious roommates when they were all strapped for cash. Layla began to date Fish, who Christian believed was hiding something. After snooping around and talking to Kyle, Christian learned that Fish was gay and had had an affair with Kyle in college. Layla, who suspected Fish was gay, challenged Fish to tell her the truth. After a bad, drunken night in which Fish slept with town slut Stacy, he finally came out and found support and friendship in Christian and Layla. After accidentally coming out on national television, Fish stopped Kyle from marrying new boyfriend Nick in a mass commitment ceremony and the two were reunited. Christian and Layla, meanwhile, realized that they could love again and became a couple.\n\nViki/Charlie/Dorian/David: Viki and Dorian decided to run for Mayor, which re-ignited their long rivalry. Charlie stood by Viki, while Dorian and David couldn't get along long enough to get any work done. Dorian was later manipulated by Amelia Bennett, head of the Llanview Gay and Lesbian Alliance, who coerced Dorian into making her campaign all about gay rights. Dorian took the idea ten steps further, holding a mass commitment ceremony and marrying Amelia! David, devastated, relocated to London to stay at the Buchanan compound while Viki and Charlie were distracted by Jessica, Natalie and Jared's troubles."
