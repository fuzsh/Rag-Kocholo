        "text": "My daughter always wondered why they called it “One Life to Live” when almost everyone who died in Llanview returned to the party eventually, looking none the worse for having gone over Iguazu Falls in a canoe or spending months in a coma in Kentucky.\n\nBut the ABC show and the matriarchy it’s chronicled comes to an end Friday, after 43 years. And so, too, ends the last soap opera filmed in New York City, where the form began.\n\nQuite unsoapily, “OLTL,” like “All My Children” in the fall, has fallen victim to the dullest possible villain: slackened ratings and the simple fact that reality TV is cheaper to produce. But for months, the soap has been energetically milking its protracted death scene, bringing back beloved characters from decades past to reconcile, reminisce and reveal . . . not quite everything.\n\nMany of the story lines were inadvertently unresolved, it turns out, because when the show taped its final episode in November, everyone thought it would be picked up and shown on the Internet. But that deal is off.\n\nTo review the recent action, Gigi, who we thought was Stacy, is alive, and Victor, who we thought was Todd, is dead, along with Robert, who started out a cad and ended a hero. Viki and Clint are back together after many years of showing not the slightest interest, as are Cord and Tina and John and Natalie, with whom the writers took that ”rocky road to love” thing a bit too far. To close the deal with Blair, Todd faked Cole’s death to get him out of the country, and he found out that his dad, Patrick, hadn’t been taken out by terrorists after all. Got it?\n\nBut despite the typically silly soap opera plotlines, “One Life to Live” had some real-world impact. It advanced social issues as the first daytime show to cast a black actress in a central role, Ellen Holly, who played Carla, and furthered the show business careers of many a New York actor, among them Laurence Fishburne, who at 13 played a street kid, and Tommy Lee Jones, who was cast as Dr. Mark Toland in the early ’70s.\n\nThe closing of the show is also no small thing for New York stage actors, women in particular. I’ve been a fan of the soap since I was a cub reporter in the ’80s, and rarely do my husband and I go to the theater when I don’t look over the playbill, point to someone in the cast and say, ”Oh, look, it’s so-and-so from ’One Life!’ ”\n\nSoap opera is the one medium in which women not only run the world but play vixens into their 60s, and make the jokes and the rules. The truth always comes out, and wrong actions always will be punished, period.\n\nYet redemption is a constant, too, and people do change a lot. Jane Austen would not be disappointed in the marriage rate in Llanview. And although the social commentary in the compassionate and crusading universe Agnes Nixon created could never have been accused of subtlety, “One Life to Live” consistently raised awareness about tough issues, everything from breast cancer to the bullying of the gay teen whom Ryan Phillippe played on the show in the ’90s.\n\nWithin the soap genre, “One Life” broke fresh ground in casting female roles. Its actresses were not all skinny, and costume designer Susan Gammie said that was very much by design: “I found it so satisfying to create images for all kinds of women, every shape, size and economic background, so no matter who the viewer is, she can find somebody to visually relate to that makes her feel good about herself. That’s not the case even on other soaps; that was ‘One Life.’ And in terms of programming for women, a lot is being lost here.”\n\nFrom the start, the action in Llanview, Pa., has centered around newspaper publisher, university president, former mayor and sometime waitress and oft-married Viki Lord Riley Buchanan Buchanan Carpenter Davidson Banks, the rock of the town despite her multiple personality disorder. Her portrayer, Erika Slezak, who was playing Desdemona in Buffalo, N.Y., when she got the role in 1971, took one last curtain call Thursday at a tribute to the show on “The View,” which aired Friday. And in an interview in her dressing room before the taping, she teared up a few times as she talked about leaving Llanview.\n\n“It’s OK,” she said of the show closing, then took it back: “Well no, it’s not; our ratings were good, and the stories are great, and the reason we were given, I rarely curse in public, but it was bull.”\n\nIn the last week alone, Slezak’s Viki has been shot, journeyed to purgatory (referred to in the script as “Between Heaven and Hell,” a deft reference to Nixon’s original title for the soap) and beaten out a 25-year-old (“half my age and with a tenth of my intelligence!” Viki declared) for the affections of her second and perhaps future husband. Over the years, she’s survived rape, betrayal, kidnapping, the loss of a child, a stroke, a heart transplant and breast cancer. (The former Mrs. Rudy Giuliani, Donna Hanover, played her cancer doc.) Oh, and “I have no kidneys,” having given one away on at least two occasions.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, in her 50s, Slezak went to Hollywood to do a TV movie and was asked whether she wanted to do more of that kind of work. “And I said, ‘Sure,’ and the woman I was talking to said, ‘Good, because there are lots of old mom parts.’ And I thought, ‘No, I’m going to go back to Llanview and get in bed with my next hubby.’ ” She’s won six daytime Emmys for work that included time travel to the 1800s, four trips to heaven and two stints in elected office.\n\nSo did Viki run as a Democrat in the swing state of Pennsylvania? Slezak wasn’t sure, but she said her favorite thing about the character was the way she’d matured from someone who knew all the answers to someone who knew better than to think that. By far, her favorite relationship, she said, was Viki’s with her rival-turned-soul mate, the fiery Dorian Lord, played by Robin Strasser.\n\nHad the show gone on, Slezak said, Dorian, who’d been appointed to an empty U.S. Senate seat vacated in a sexting scandal, was going to become president.\n\nAs Slezak spoke, Strasser swept into Slezak’s dressing room as if on cue, in what she called “a very Dorian look,” a chic checkered suit with a trailing fur stole and amazing jewelry. The two women embraced and got misty all over again. “I knew you’d wear ‘Dorian red,’ and I’m wearing ’Viki red,’ ” Slezak told her friend.\n\nThe mob of fans at “The View” taping, many of them in T-shirts that said, “I can’t cope without my soap” or “Property of ‘One Life to Live’ since 1968,” were there to pay tribute to the actresses and their co-stars, who’ve been in their living rooms for so long that they think of them as family.\n\n“I’m devastated,” said Maria Sordi of Brooklyn, who added that she was hooked on the soap opera because ”it makes you laugh every day.”\n\nThe reality show that’s replacing “One Life” is called “The Revolution,” which includes Tim Gunn and will offer lots of tips on how women can lose weight and otherwise improve themselves. It promises to be a far cry from the memorable matriarchs of Llanview, and I, for one, plan to improve my life by not watching.\n\n(courtesy of the Albany Times-Union)\n\n1. Longtime “OLTL” heroine Victoria Lord Gordon Riley Burke Riley Buchanan Buchanan Carpenter Davidson Banks has helped her portrayer, Erika Slezak, win a record six Daytime Emmys. But which one of these things never happened to Viki?\n\nA. Died and went to heaven\n\nB. Was trapped in the underground city of Eterna\n\nC. Gave birth to twins by two different fathers\n\nD. Had six alternate personalities\n\nE. Traveled back in time to 1888\n\n2. Crusty Texas millionaire Asa Buchanan played a major part in the show’s landmark gay teen plotline of the early ’90s. Phil Carey, the actor who played Asa, previously played one of the first gay characters on network TV in a famous episode of what 1970’s sitcom?\n\n3. Llanview is the county seat of Llantano County, located along the banks of Llantano River in the shadow of Llantano Mountain. What is the name of Viki Lord’s estate?\n\n4. “OLTL” was responsible for the first big breaks of many future stars, including Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Phillipe, Judith Light, Nathan Fillion, Dixie Carter, Blair Underwood, Phylicia Rashad, Tom Berenger and what current ABC nighttime star preparing to say goodbye to her own long-running show this May?\n\n5. Llanview is home to two daily newspapers: The Banner, run by Viki Lord; and The Sun, a tabloid owned by her brother, Todd Manning. By what name was The Sun known when it was owned by Viki’s decades-long nemesis Dorian Cramer Lord, etc.?\n\n6. A watershed moment in soap opera history came in 1979 when doctor’s wife Karen Wolek (Judith Light) broke down on the witness stand during her friend Viki’s murder trial and confessed a terrible secret, earning Light a Daytime Emmy and continuing praise as the greatest performance ever in daytime, and the scene a place on TV Guide’s 100 Most Memorable Moments in Television History. What was the secret?\n\nA. She was born a man\n\nB. She was a housewife hooker\n\nC. She had no idea who the boss was\n\nD. She had assumed the identity of her dead evil twin\n\nE. She was the actual murderer\n\n7. Following in the footsteps of ”General Hospital” character Luke Spencer, “OLTL” controversially turned rapist Todd Manning into the show’s antihero. Recently, the ”real” Todd returned to Llanview after eight years in captivity by his rogue CIA agent mother while his brainwashed twin brother assumed his life, even though that brother had first appeared in town with a new face thanks to plastic surgery to make him look like the brother of psychotic cult leader Mitch Laurence, who was revealed to be the father of one of Viki’s twin daughters and who just took part in a massive blackout to break out of prison and wreak havoc on the town in the show’s final episodes. So, on which cheek is Todd’s trademark scar?\n\n8. In its 44 seasons, how many times has “OLTL” won the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series? How many times has it been nominated?\n\n9. Despite the often fanciful plotlines, Agnes Nixon created “OLTL” as a more realistic and multicultural alternative to the other soaps on the air in 1968. The show first focused on the wealthy Lord family, the middle-class Woleks and Rileys, the Jewish Siegels and the African-American Grays. Today, along with the enduring Lords, there are the Vegas, the Patels and the Jewish District Attorney Nora Hanen Buchanan. But what character debuted as half-Asian only to become a blonde Caucasian when the part was recast?\n\n10. What fictional country has played a part in many “OLTL” plotlines since first introduced in 1986?\n\nA. Moldavia\n\nB. Malaguay\n\nC. Macho Grande\n\nD. Mypos\n\nE. Mendorra\n\nANSWERS:\n\n1. C. This was revealed to be untrue in the series’ final episodes, although it was taken as fact by all the characters for the past decade.\n\n2. ”All in the Family.” He played an ex-professional football player friend of Archie Bunker’s on the series’ fifth episode. Interesting side note No. 1: The plot inspired an on-tape rant by Richard Nixon. Interesting side note No. 2: Another co-star on that same episode? Anthony Geary, later Luke Spencer on ”General Hospital.”\n\n3. Llanfair. What else?\n\n4. Marcia Cross. The ”Desperate Housewives” star began her career on ”Edge of Night,” but had her first major role on “OLTL” as Kate Sanders in 1986.\n\n5. The Intruder.\n\n6. B. Too bad she had to open her mouth. The murder victim, her pimp, Marco Dane, was not only not dead but returned to the show several times over the next 13 years before transferring to ”General Hospital.”\n\n7. Right. He received it after he tried to rape Marty Saybrooke a second time and he was hit with a lead pipe by New Age goddess worshipper Luna Moody.\n\n8. One win, five nominations.\n\n9. Blair Cramer. When the character showed up in 1991, played by Japanese-American actress Mia Korf, she was the product of the rape of a thought-dead mental patient by a Japanese hospital worker. Kassie DePaiva, Blair from 1993 to the present day, took over and all mentions of the character’s Asian heritage disappeared.\n\n10. E. Moldavia was the scene of the infamous cliffhanger massacre on ”Dynasty”; Malaguay was the Central American country where Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond coincidentally Judith Light’s ”Who’s the Boss?” mother) faced a firing squad in the final moments of ”Soap”; Macho Grande was the site of the war that haunted the memories of Ted Striker in ”Airplane!” and ”Airplane II: The Sequel”; and Mypos was the Greece-adjacent homeland of Balki on ”Perfect Strangers.” Anyone notice that three of these, like Mendorra on “OLTL,” come from ABC shows?\n\nSources: http://abc.go.com/shows/one-life-to-live; http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/whoswho; http://soaps.sheknows.com/"
