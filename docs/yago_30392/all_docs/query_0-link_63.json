        "text": "Ahh, the splendour of Natalie’s Huevos Rancheros, now probably my default Saturday breakfast. Even when engaged in baking 14 loaves of beer bread, a couple of Saturdays ago:\n\nI managed to rustle some up, to give me sustenance. I added some red peppers to Natalie’s recipe, as I had some that needed using up. Other than that, I followed everything to the letter.\n\nI was so pleased to have found this fabulous recipe in the lovely Recipes for Rebels cookbook.\n\nThe wonderful Greg Swenson, author of the book, and proprietor of the fabulous Recipes for Rebels website recently sent me an amazing package of goodies from Greece. My bountiful prizes for participating in his fabulously fun Cowboy Day Cookalong…\n\nAmongst my gifts was a whole, massive bottle of locally made olive oil. Check it out compared to the measly one that was in my cupboard!\n\nI used a tablespoon for the first time this week, on an Ottolenghi salad (tomatoes with sumac, onions and pine nuts). It was utterly DIVINE – thank you Greg, and also thanks to your friend whose olive trees this superlative olive oil came from. Yum yum yum.\n\nScrumptious!\n\nBy the way, the bread baking bonanza was a run through for when I sell bread at my nephew’s brewery on Saturday October 29th. Come on down! Click here for details of the Hammerton Brewery Monthly Tap Room Opening – I’ll be there from 2 -6ish on Saturday. Same in November on the 26th. Selling mustard made with Hammerton beer too!\n\nBut back to the Mexican eggs!\n\nNatalie Wood’s Huevos Rancheros\n\n4 tortillas\n\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n1 clove garlic, mashed\n\n1/2 teaspoon marjoram\n\n1 small serrano or other chile pepper, chopped or 2 teaspoons red chili powder\n\n1 cup fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped or 1 cup canned tomato sauce\n\nsalt and freshly ground pepper, to taste\n\n4 eggs\n\n1 tablespoon butter\n\nFry tortillas quickly in hot oil; drain on paper towel.\n\nKeep oil hot; add garlic, marjoram, chopped chili, tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste. Simmer tomato mixture for a few minutes until flavors are well blended and sauce has thickened slightly.\n\nFry eggs in a small amount of butter in separate pan, or poach in the hot tomato sauce.\n\nTo serve, place one egg on each tortilla, cover with sauce. Serve at once.\n\nSave"
