        "text": "Roller hockey is a variation of floor hockey played on a dry field using roller skates. Roller Hockey can mean two types, the difference is the type of skates and sticks that are used. The traditional roller hockey, which can be called quad hockey or rink hockey, is played with quad skates. The inline hockey is played with inline skates.\n\nThere is another type of roller hockey which is called skater hockey, this is played on both quad skates and inline skates.\n\nInline hockey is played by two teams with five players each, four skaters, and one goalie. It is played on a dry rink. The rink is divided by two halves, there is a center line in the middle, and one net at each side of the rink. Inline hockey is played in three periods, with 13 minutes each. If the game is higher standard then it is played with 20 minutes each.\n\nSimilar Sports\n\nRink Hockey — roller hockey played on quad skates\n\nInline Hockey — similar rules to ice hockey, though players move around on a wooden or concrete surface wearing inline skates.\n\nStreet Hockey — a team sport that was derived from ice hockey, though it is played on an asphalt or cement surface instead of ice, and players usually just wear shoes.\n\nFloor Hockey — refers to a collection of indoor hockey sports that were derived from various hockey codes.\n\nUnicycle Hockey — a team sport, similar to roller or inline hockey, though all competitors are riding a unicycle and using a tennis ball and ice-hockey sticks.\n\nRoll Ball — like handball on roller skates, players must bounce the ball while moving and score goals by shooting the ball into the opposing team's goal.\n\nRoller Derby — two teams compete while skating in the same direction around a track\n\nRelated Pages"
