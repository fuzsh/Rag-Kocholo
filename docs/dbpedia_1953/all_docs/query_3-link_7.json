It is a sport in which two teams play in opposition to each other by attempting to move a ball into the challenger's goal with a hockey stick. There are many types of hockey for instance bandy, field hockey, ice hockey etc.\n\nDifferent types of Hockey\n\nFollowing are the different types of Hockey:\n\nBandy: Bandy is played with a ball on a football pitch-sized ice stadium, in general outdoors and with a lot of rules similar to group football. It is played professionally in Russia and Sweden and it is considered as a national sport in Russia.\n\nField Hockey: Field hockey is played on rock-strewn, natural grass, or sand-based or water-based artificial grass.

The game is played between single-sex sides, even though they can be unisex. Men's field hockey has been played at every Summer Olympic Games since 1908 apart from 1912 and 1924, while women's field hockey has been played at the Summer Olympic Games since 1980.\n\nIce Hockey: Ice hockey is played between two teams of skaters on a big flat part of ice, using a three-inch-diameter (76.2 mm) rubber disc called a puck. The game is played all over North America, Europe and to varying extents in many other countries around the world.\n\nRoller Hockey: Roller hockey is also famous as rink hockey or quad hockey, international-style ball hockey. Two five-man teams attempt to drive the ball with their sticks into the opponents' goal. The ball can only be place in movement by a stick, not the skate. Otherwise a foul will be stated. The game has two 25-minute halves with the clock stopping when the ball becomes dead. Every team has a one-minute timeout in each part. Each team has a minimum of six players and a greatest of ten.\n\nSledge Hockey: Sledge hockey is designed for players with physical disabilities affecting their lower bodies. Players sit on double-bladed sledges and use two sticks. Each stick has a blade at one end and small picks at the other. Players apply the sticks to pass, stickhandle and shoot the puck and to push their sledges.\n\nFloorball Hockey: Floorball is a variety of floor hockey with five players and a goalkeeper in every team.
