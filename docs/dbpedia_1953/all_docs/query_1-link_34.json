A global climatology of LAP deposition was created and used to optimize a parameter in the Crocus snow model. Testing at ten global sites improved albedo predictions by 10 % on average and over 25 % in the Arctic. This method can also enhance other snow models' predictions without complex simulations.\n\nAnalyzing the sensitivity of a blowing snow model (SnowPappus) to precipitation forcing, blowing snow, and spatial resolution\n\nAnge Haddjeri, Matthieu Baron, Matthieu Lafaysse, Louis Le Toumelin, CÃ©sar Deschamps-Berger, Vincent Vionnet, Simon Gascoin, Matthieu Vernay, and Marie Dumont\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3081–3116, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3081-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3081-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study addresses the complex challenge of evaluating distributed alpine snow simulations with snow transport against snow depths from Pléiades stereo imagery and snow melt-out dates from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites. Additionally, we disentangle error contributions between blowing snow, precipitation heterogeneity, and unresolved subgrid variability. Snow transport enhances the snow simulations at high elevations, while precipitation biases are the main error source in other areas.\n\nCold Climates, Complex Hydrology: Can A Land Surface Model Accurately Simulate Deep Percolation?\n\nAlireza Amani, Marie-AmÃ©lie Boucher, Alexandre R. Cabral, Vincent Vionnet, and Ãtienne Gaborit\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1277,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1277, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurately estimating groundwater recharge using numerical models is particularly difficult in cold regions with snow and soil freezing. This study evaluated a physics-based model against high-resolution field measurements. Our findings highlight a need for a better representation of soil freezing processes, offering a roadmap for future model development. This leads to more accurate models to aid water resources management decisions in cold climates.\n\nMulti-physics ensemble modelling of Arctic tundra snowpack properties\n\nGeorgina Jean Woolley, Nick Rutter, Leanne Wake, Vincent Vionnet, Chris Derksen, Richard Essery, Philip Marsh, Rosamund Tutton, Branden Walker, Matthieu Lafaysse, and David Pritchard\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1237,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1237, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nParameterisations of Arctic snow processes were implemented into the multi-physics ensemble version of SVS2-Crocus and evaluated using density and SSA measurements at an Arctic tundra site. Optimal combinations of parameterisations that improved the simulation of density and SSA were identified. Top performing ensemble members featured modifications that raise wind speeds to increase compaction in surface layers, prevent snowdrift and increase viscosity in basal layers.\n\nRetrieval of airborne Ku-Band SAR Using Forward Radiative Transfer Modeling to Estimate Snow Water Equivalent: The Trail Valley Creek 2018/19 Snow Experiment\n\nBenoit Montpetit, Joshua King, Julien Meloche, Chris Derksen, Paul Siqueira, J. Max Adam, Peter Toose, Mike Brady, Anna Wendleder, Vincent Vionnet, and Nicolas R. Leroux\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-651,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-651, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper validates the use of free open-source models to link distributed snow measurements to radar measurements in the Canadian Arctic. Using multiple radar sensors, we can decouple the soil from the snow contribution. We then retrieve the \"microwave snow grain size\" to characterize the interaction between the snow mass and the radar signal.

We present SnowPappus, a simple scheme coupled with the Crocus snow model to compute blowing-snow fluxes and redistribute snow among grid points at 250 m resolution. In terms of numerical cost, it is suitable for large-scale applications. We present point-scale evaluations of fluxes and snow transport occurrence.\n\nFROSTBYTE: A reproducible data-driven workflow for probabilistic seasonal streamflow forecasting in snow-fed river basins across North America\n\nLouise Arnal, Martyn P.

Thompson, Julie M. ThÃ©riault, Stephen J. DÃ©ry, Ronald E. Stewart, Dominique Boisvert, Lisa Rickard, Nicolas R. Leroux, Matteo Colli, and Vincent Vionnet\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 5785–5806, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-5785-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-5785-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Saint John River experiment on Cold Season Storms was conducted in northwest New Brunswick, Canada, to investigate the types of precipitation that can lead to ice jams and flooding along the river. We deployed meteorological instruments, took precipitation measurements and photographs of snowflakes, and launched weather balloons. These data will help us to better understand the atmospheric conditions that can affect local communities and townships downstream during the spring melt season.\n\nExploring the potential of forest snow modelling at the tree and snowpack layer scale\n\nGiulia Mazzotti, Jari-Pekka Nousu, Vincent Vionnet, Tobias Jonas, Rafife Nheili, and Matthieu Lafaysse\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2781,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2781, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs many boreal and alpine forests have seasonal snow, models are needed to predict forest snow under future environmental conditions. We have created a new forest snow model by combining existing, very detailed model components for the canopy and the snowpack. We applied it to forests in Switzerland and Finland and showed how complex forest cover leads to a snowpack layering that is very variable in space and time, because different processes prevail at different locations in the forest.\n\nThe Great Lakes Runoff Intercomparison Project Phase 4: the Great Lakes (GRIP-GL)\n\nJuliane Mai, Hongren Shen, Bryan A.

In this study, 13 diverse model setups using the same input data are evaluated over the Great Lakes region. Various model outputs – such as streamflow, evaporation, soil moisture, and amount of snow on the ground – are compared using standardized methods and metrics. The basin-wise model outputs and observations are made available through an interactive website.\n\nCanadian historical Snow Water Equivalent dataset (CanSWE, 1928â2020)\n\nVincent Vionnet, Colleen Mortimer, Mike Brady, Louise Arnal, and Ross Brown\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 4603–4619, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4603-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4603-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater equivalent of snow cover (SWE) is a key variable for water management, hydrological forecasting and climate monitoring. A new Canadian SWE dataset (CanSWE) is presented in this paper. It compiles data collected by multiple agencies and companies at more than 2500 different locations across Canada over the period 1928–2020.

Marsh, Brian Menounos, Simon Gascoin, Nicholas E. Wayand, Joseph Shea, Kriti Mukherjee, and John W. Pomeroy\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 743–769, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-743-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-743-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMountain snow cover provides critical supplies of fresh water to downstream users. Its accurate prediction requires inclusion of often-ignored processes. A multi-scale modelling strategy is presented that efficiently accounts for snow redistribution. Model accuracy is assessed via airborne lidar and optical satellite imagery. With redistribution the model captures the elevation–snow depth relation. Redistribution processes are required to reproduce spatial variability, such as around ridges.\n\nSCDNA: a serially complete precipitation and temperature dataset for North America from 1979 to 2018\n\nGuoqiang Tang, Martyn P.

This study developed a serially complete dataset for North America (SCDNA) from 1979 to 2018 for 27 276 precipitation and temperature stations. SCDNA is built on multiple data sources and infilling/reconstruction strategies to achieve high-quality estimates which can be used for a variety of applications.\n\nAssessing the factors governing the ability to predict late-spring flooding in cold-region mountain basins\n\nVincent Vionnet, Vincent Fortin, Etienne Gaborit, Guy Roy, Maria Abrahamowicz, Nicolas Gasset, and John W. Pomeroy\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2141–2165, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2141-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2141-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe 2013 Alberta flood in Canada was typical of late-spring floods in mountain basins combining intense precipitation with rapid melting of late-lying snowpack. Hydrological simulations of this event are mainly influenced by (i) the spatial resolution of the atmospheric forcing due to the best estimate of precipitation at the kilometer scale and changes in turbulent fluxes contributing to snowmelt and (ii) uncertainties in initial snow conditions at high elevations. Soil texture has less impact.\n\nSatellite-derived products of solar and longwave irradiances used for snowpack modelling in mountainous terrain\n\nLouis QuÃ©no, Fatima Karbou, Vincent Vionnet, and Ingrid Dombrowski-Etchevers\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Satellite-derived products of incoming radiation were assessed in the French Alps and the Pyrenees and compared to meteorological forecasts, reanalyses and in situ measurements. We showed their good quality in mountains. The different radiation datasets were used as radiative forcing for snowpack simulations with the detailed model Crocus. Their impact on the snowpack evolution was explored.\n\nMeasurement of specific surface area of fresh solid precipitation particles in heavy snowfall regions of Japan\n\nSatoru Yamaguchi, Masaaki Ishizaka, Hiroki Motoyoshi, Sent Nakai, Vincent Vionnet, Teruo Aoki, Katsuya Yamashita, Akihiro Hashimoto, and Akihiro Hachikubo\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2713–2732, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2713-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2713-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe specific surface area (SSA) of solid precipitation particles (PPs) includes detailed information of PP. This work is based on field measurement of SSA of PPs in Nagaoka, the city with the heaviest snowfall in Japan. The values of SSA strongly depend on wind speed (WS) and wet-bulb temperature (Tw) on the ground. An equation to empirically estimate the SSA of fresh PPs with WS and Tw was established and the equation successfully reproduced the fluctuation of SSA in Nagaoka.\n\nA meteorological and blowing snow data set (2000â2016) from a high-elevation alpine site (Col du Lac Blanc, France, 2720 m a.s.l.)\n\nGilbert Guyomarc'h, HervÃ© Bellot, Vincent Vionnet, Florence Naaim-Bouvet, Yannick DÃ©liot, Firmin Fontaine, Philippe PugliÃ¨se, Kouichi Nishimura, Yves Durand, and Mohamed Naaim\n\nEarth Syst.

The historical changes of snow and sea ice are generally coherent and consistent with the regional history of temperature and precipitation changes. It is expected that snow and sea ice will continue to decrease in the future, declining by an additional 15–30â¯% from present day values by the year 2050.\n\nDistributed vs. semi-distributed simulations of snowpack dynamics in alpine areas: case study in the upper Arve catchment, French Alps, 1989â2015\n\nJesÃºs Revuelto, GrÃ©goire Lecourt, Matthieu Lafaysse, Isabella Zin, Luc Charrois, Vincent Vionnet, Marie Dumont, Antoine Rabatel, Delphine Six, Thomas Condom, Samuel Morin, Alessandra Viani, and Pascal Sirguey\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2017-184,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2017-184, 2017\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated distributed and semi-distributed modeling approaches to simulating the spatial and temporal evolution of snow and ice over an extended mountain catchment, using the Crocus snowpack model. The distributed approach simulated the snowpack dynamics on a 250-m grid, enabling inclusion of terrain shadowing effects. The semi-distributed approach simulated the snowpack dynamics for discrete topographic classes characterized by elevation range, aspect, and slope.\n\nEvaluating the performance of coupled snowâsoil models in SURFEXv8 to simulate the permafrost thermal regime at a high Arctic site\n\nMathieu Barrere, Florent Domine, Bertrand Decharme, Samuel Morin, Vincent Vionnet, and Matthieu Lafaysse\n\nGeosci.

This study assesses the capacity of snow-soil coupled models to simulate the permafrost thermal regime at Bylot Island, a high Arctic site. Significant flaws are found in the description of Arctic snow properties, resulting in erroneous heat transfers between the soil and the snow in simulations. Improved snow schemes are needed to accurately predict the future of permafrost.\n\nA multiphysical ensemble system of numerical snow modelling\n\nMatthieu Lafaysse, Bertrand Cluzet, Marie Dumont, Yves Lejeune, Vincent Vionnet, and Samuel Morin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1173–1198, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1173-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1173-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPhysically based multilayer snowpack models suffer from various modelling errors. To represent these errors, we built the new multiphysical ensemble system ESCROC by implementing new representations of different physical processes in a coupled multilayer ground/snowpack model. This system is a promising tool to integrate snow modelling errors in ensemble forecasting and ensemble assimilation systems in support of avalanche hazard forecasting and other snowpack modelling applications.\n\nSnowpack modelling in the Pyrenees driven by kilometric-resolution meteorological forecasts\n\nLouis QuÃ©no, Vincent Vionnet, Ingrid Dombrowski-Etchevers, Matthieu Lafaysse, Marie Dumont, and Fatima Karbou\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1571–1589, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1571-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1571-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSimulations are carried out in the Pyrenees with the snowpack model Crocus, driven by meteorological forecasts from the model AROME at kilometer resolution. The evaluation is done with ground-based measurements, satellite data and reference simulations. Studying daily snow depth variations allows to separate different physical processes affecting the snowpack. We show the benefits of AROME kilometric resolution and dynamical behavior in terms of snowpack spatial variability in a mountain range.\n\nThe SURFEXv7.2 land and ocean surface platform for coupled or offline simulation of earth surface variables and fluxes\n\nV.

A global climatology of LAP deposition was created and used to optimize a parameter in the Crocus snow model. Testing at ten global sites improved albedo predictions by 10 % on average and over 25 % in the Arctic. This method can also enhance other snow models' predictions without complex simulations.\n\nAnalyzing the sensitivity of a blowing snow model (SnowPappus) to precipitation forcing, blowing snow, and spatial resolution\n\nAnge Haddjeri, Matthieu Baron, Matthieu Lafaysse, Louis Le Toumelin, CÃ©sar Deschamps-Berger, Vincent Vionnet, Simon Gascoin, Matthieu Vernay, and Marie Dumont\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3081–3116, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3081-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3081-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study addresses the complex challenge of evaluating distributed alpine snow simulations with snow transport against snow depths from Pléiades stereo imagery and snow melt-out dates from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites. Additionally, we disentangle error contributions between blowing snow, precipitation heterogeneity, and unresolved subgrid variability. Snow transport enhances the snow simulations at high elevations, while precipitation biases are the main error source in other areas.\n\nCold Climates, Complex Hydrology: Can A Land Surface Model Accurately Simulate Deep Percolation?\n\nAlireza Amani, Marie-AmÃ©lie Boucher, Alexandre R.

Optimal combinations of parameterisations that improved the simulation of density and SSA were identified. Top performing ensemble members featured modifications that raise wind speeds to increase compaction in surface layers, prevent snowdrift and increase viscosity in basal layers.\n\nVertical Profiles of Liquid Water Content in fog layers during the SOFOG3D experiment\n\nThÃ©ophane Costabloz, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Burnet, Christine Lac, Pauline Martinet, Julien DelanoÃ«, Susana Jorquera, and Maroua Fathalli\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1344,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1344, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study documents vertical profiles of liquid water content (LWC) in fogs from in situ measurements collected during the SOFOG3D field campaign in 2019–2020. The analysis of 140 vertical profiles reveals a reverse trend in LWC, maximum values at ground decreasing with height, during stable conditions in optically thin fogs, evolving towards quasi-adiabatic characteristics when fogs become thick. These results offer new perspectives for better constraining fog numerical simulations.\n\nRetrieval of airborne Ku-Band SAR Using Forward Radiative Transfer Modeling to Estimate Snow Water Equivalent: The Trail Valley Creek 2018/19 Snow Experiment\n\nBenoit Montpetit, Joshua King, Julien Meloche, Chris Derksen, Paul Siqueira, J.

However, meteorological models that predict, among others things, solar radiation have errors. Therefore, we wanted to know in which situtaions these errors are most significant. We found that errors mostly occur in cloudy situations, and different errors were highlighted depending on the cloud altitude. Several potential sources of errors were identified.\n\nFROSTBYTE: A reproducible data-driven workflow for probabilistic seasonal streamflow forecasting in snow-fed river basins across North America\n\nLouise Arnal, Martyn P.

The results can be operationalised to nowcast fog and improve short-range forecasts in numerical weather prediction models.\n\nAtmospheric and surface observations during the Saint John River Experiment on Cold Season Storms (SAJESS)\n\nHadleigh D. Thompson, Julie M. ThÃ©riault, Stephen J. DÃ©ry, Ronald E. Stewart, Dominique Boisvert, Lisa Rickard, Nicolas R. Leroux, Matteo Colli, and Vincent Vionnet\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 5785–5806, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-5785-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-5785-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Saint John River experiment on Cold Season Storms was conducted in northwest New Brunswick, Canada, to investigate the types of precipitation that can lead to ice jams and flooding along the river. We deployed meteorological instruments, took precipitation measurements and photographs of snowflakes, and launched weather balloons. These data will help us to better understand the atmospheric conditions that can affect local communities and townships downstream during the spring melt season.\n\nExploring the potential of forest snow modelling at the tree and snowpack layer scale\n\nGiulia Mazzotti, Jari-Pekka Nousu, Vincent Vionnet, Tobias Jonas, Rafife Nheili, and Matthieu Lafaysse\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2781,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2781, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs many boreal and alpine forests have seasonal snow, models are needed to predict forest snow under future environmental conditions. We have created a new forest snow model by combining existing, very detailed model components for the canopy and the snowpack. We applied it to forests in Switzerland and Finland and showed how complex forest cover leads to a snowpack layering that is very variable in space and time, because different processes prevail at different locations in the forest.\n\nThe Great Lakes Runoff Intercomparison Project Phase 4: the Great Lakes (GRIP-GL)\n\nJuliane Mai, Hongren Shen, Bryan A.

In this study, 13 diverse model setups using the same input data are evaluated over the Great Lakes region. Various model outputs – such as streamflow, evaporation, soil moisture, and amount of snow on the ground – are compared using standardized methods and metrics. The basin-wise model outputs and observations are made available through an interactive website.\n\nDemistify: a large-eddy simulation (LES) and single-column model (SCM) intercomparison of radiation fog\n\nIan Boutle, Wayne Angevine, Jian-Wen Bao, Thierry Bergot, Ritthik Bhattacharya, Andreas Bott, Leo DucongÃ©, Richard Forbes, Tobias Goecke, Evelyn Grell, Adrian Hill, Adele L.

Phys., 22, 319–333, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-319-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-319-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFog forecasting is one of the biggest problems for numerical weather prediction. By comparing many models used for fog forecasting with others used for fog research, we hoped to help guide forecast improvements. We show some key processes that, if improved, will help improve fog forecasting, such as how water is deposited on the ground. We also showed that research models were not themselves a suitable baseline for comparison, and we discuss what future observations are required to improve them.\n\nCanadian historical Snow Water Equivalent dataset (CanSWE, 1928â2020)\n\nVincent Vionnet, Colleen Mortimer, Mike Brady, Louise Arnal, and Ross Brown\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 4603–4619, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4603-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4603-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater equivalent of snow cover (SWE) is a key variable for water management, hydrological forecasting and climate monitoring. A new Canadian SWE dataset (CanSWE) is presented in this paper. It compiles data collected by multiple agencies and companies at more than 2500 different locations across Canada over the period 1928–2020. Snow depth and derived bulk snow density are also included when available.\n\nMulti-scale snowdrift-permitting modelling of mountain snowpack\n\nVincent Vionnet, Christopher B. Marsh, Brian Menounos, Simon Gascoin, Nicholas E. Wayand, Joseph Shea, Kriti Mukherjee, and John W. Pomeroy\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 743–769, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-743-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-743-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMountain snow cover provides critical supplies of fresh water to downstream users. Its accurate prediction requires inclusion of often-ignored processes. A multi-scale modelling strategy is presented that efficiently accounts for snow redistribution. Model accuracy is assessed via airborne lidar and optical satellite imagery. With redistribution the model captures the elevation–snow depth relation. Redistribution processes are required to reproduce spatial variability, such as around ridges.\n\nHectometric-scale simulations of a Mediterranean heavy-precipitation event during the Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) first Special Observation Period (SOP1)\n\nOlivier Nuissier, Fanny Duffourg, Maxime Martinet, VÃ©ronique Ducrocq, and Christine Lac\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 14649–14667, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-14649-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-14649-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis present article demonstrates how numerical simulations with very high horizontal resolution (150 m) can contribute to better understanding the key physical processes (turbulence and microphysics) that lead to Mediterranean heavy precipitation.\n\nSCDNA: a serially complete precipitation and temperature dataset for North America from 1979 to 2018\n\nGuoqiang Tang, Martyn P. Clark, Andrew J. Newman, Andrew W. Wood, Simon Michael Papalexiou, Vincent Vionnet, and Paul H. Whitfield\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 12, 2381–2409, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-2381-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-2381-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStation observations are critical for hydrological and meteorological studies, but they often contain missing values and have short measurement periods. This study developed a serially complete dataset for North America (SCDNA) from 1979 to 2018 for 27 276 precipitation and temperature stations. SCDNA is built on multiple data sources and infilling/reconstruction strategies to achieve high-quality estimates which can be used for a variety of applications.\n\nAssessing the factors governing the ability to predict late-spring flooding in cold-region mountain basins\n\nVincent Vionnet, Vincent Fortin, Etienne Gaborit, Guy Roy, Maria Abrahamowicz, Nicolas Gasset, and John W. Pomeroy\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2141–2165, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2141-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2141-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe 2013 Alberta flood in Canada was typical of late-spring floods in mountain basins combining intense precipitation with rapid melting of late-lying snowpack. Hydrological simulations of this event are mainly influenced by (i) the spatial resolution of the atmospheric forcing due to the best estimate of precipitation at the kilometer scale and changes in turbulent fluxes contributing to snowmelt and (ii) uncertainties in initial snow conditions at high elevations. Soil texture has less impact.\n\nSatellite-derived products of solar and longwave irradiances used for snowpack modelling in mountainous terrain\n\nLouis QuÃ©no, Fatima Karbou, Vincent Vionnet, and Ingrid Dombrowski-Etchevers\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2083–2104, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2083-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2083-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn mountainous terrain, the snowpack is strongly affected by incoming shortwave and longwave radiation. Satellite-derived products of incoming radiation were assessed in the French Alps and the Pyrenees and compared to meteorological forecasts, reanalyses and in situ measurements. We showed their good quality in mountains. The different radiation datasets were used as radiative forcing for snowpack simulations with the detailed model Crocus. Their impact on the snowpack evolution was explored.\n\nMeasurement of specific surface area of fresh solid precipitation particles in heavy snowfall regions of Japan\n\nSatoru Yamaguchi, Masaaki Ishizaka, Hiroki Motoyoshi, Sent Nakai, Vincent Vionnet, Teruo Aoki, Katsuya Yamashita, Akihiro Hashimoto, and Akihiro Hachikubo\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2713–2732, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2713-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2713-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe specific surface area (SSA) of solid precipitation particles (PPs) includes detailed information of PP. This work is based on field measurement of SSA of PPs in Nagaoka, the city with the heaviest snowfall in Japan. The values of SSA strongly depend on wind speed (WS) and wet-bulb temperature (Tw) on the ground. An equation to empirically estimate the SSA of fresh PPs with WS and Tw was established and the equation successfully reproduced the fluctuation of SSA in Nagaoka.\n\nImplementation of an immersed boundary method in the Meso-NH v5.2 model: applications to an idealized urban environment\n\nFranck Auguste, GÃ©raldine RÃ©a, Roberto Paoli, Christine Lac, Valery Masson, and Daniel Cariolle\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 2607–2633, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2607-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2607-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe numerical implementation of an immersed boundary method in the atmospheric solver Meso-NH is presented. This technique models fluid–solid interaction and allows for the simulation of urban flows by considering buildings to be part of the resolved scales. This study constitutes a first robust step towards a better understanding of the interactions between weather and cities and better predictions of such interactions.\n\nA 50-year analysis of hydrological trends and processes in a Mediterranean catchment\n\nNathalie Folton, Eric Martin, Patrick Arnaud, Pierre L'Hermite, and Mathieu Tolsa\n\nHydrol.

The historical changes of snow and sea ice are generally coherent and consistent with the regional history of temperature and precipitation changes. It is expected that snow and sea ice will continue to decrease in the future, declining by an additional 15–30â¯% from present day values by the year 2050.\n\nDiurnal, synoptic and seasonal variability of atmospheric CO2 in the Paris megacity area\n\nIrÃ¨ne Xueref-Remy, Elsa DieudonnÃ©, Cyrille Vuillemin, Morgan Lopez, Christine Lac, Martina Schmidt, Marc Delmotte, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier, FranÃ§ois Ravetta, Olivier Perrussel, Philippe Ciais, FranÃ§ois-Marie BrÃ©on, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Michel Ramonet, T.

This work analyses the atmospheric CO2 variability observed from the first in situ network deployed in the Paris megacity area. Gradients of several ppm are found between the rural, peri-urban and urban sites at the diurnal to the seasonal scales. Wind direction and speed as well as boundary layer dynamics, correlated to highly variable urban emissions, are shown to be key regulator factors of the observed CO2 records.\n\nAdaptation of the meteorological model Meso-NH to laboratory experiments: implementations and validation\n\nJeanne Colin, Christine Lac, ValÃ©ry Massion, and Alexandre Paci\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2017-226,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2017-226, 2017\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe meteorological model Meso-NH is adapted in order to be run in DNS mode (Direct Numerical Simulation) to represent atmospheric flows generated in laboratory. The implementations we performed are validated against exact solutions and experimental data. Thus, Meso-NH can now be used as a complement to laboratory experiments, to complete and/or extend the data. The ability to run it in DNS also brings new prospects as it offers a new framework to test parametrizations of fine-scale processes.\n\nLarge eddy simulation of radiation fog: impact of dynamics on the fog life cycle\n\nMarie Mazoyer, Christine Lac, Odile Thouron, Thierry Bergot, Valery Masson, and Luc Musson-Genon\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 13017–13035, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-13017-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-13017-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge eddy simulations of a radiation fog event occurring during the ParisFog experiment have been studied to analyze the impact of the dynamics on the fog life cycle. They included a sophisticated microphysical scheme, the drag effect of a trees barrier and deposition on vegetation. The blocking effect of the trees induces elevated fog formation and limits cooling and cloud water production. The deposition process was found to exert the most significant impact on the fog prediction.\n\nDistributed vs. semi-distributed simulations of snowpack dynamics in alpine areas: case study in the upper Arve catchment, French Alps, 1989â2015\n\nJesÃºs Revuelto, GrÃ©goire Lecourt, Matthieu Lafaysse, Isabella Zin, Luc Charrois, Vincent Vionnet, Marie Dumont, Antoine Rabatel, Delphine Six, Thomas Condom, Samuel Morin, Alessandra Viani, and Pascal Sirguey\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2017-184,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2017-184, 2017\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated distributed and semi-distributed modeling approaches to simulating the spatial and temporal evolution of snow and ice over an extended mountain catchment, using the Crocus snowpack model. The distributed approach simulated the snowpack dynamics on a 250-m grid, enabling inclusion of terrain shadowing effects. The semi-distributed approach simulated the snowpack dynamics for discrete topographic classes characterized by elevation range, aspect, and slope.\n\nEvaluating the performance of coupled snowâsoil models in SURFEXv8 to simulate the permafrost thermal regime at a high Arctic site\n\nMathieu Barrere, Florent Domine, Bertrand Decharme, Samuel Morin, Vincent Vionnet, and Matthieu Lafaysse\n\nGeosci.

This study assesses the capacity of snow-soil coupled models to simulate the permafrost thermal regime at Bylot Island, a high Arctic site. Significant flaws are found in the description of Arctic snow properties, resulting in erroneous heat transfers between the soil and the snow in simulations. Improved snow schemes are needed to accurately predict the future of permafrost.\n\nA multiphysical ensemble system of numerical snow modelling\n\nMatthieu Lafaysse, Bertrand Cluzet, Marie Dumont, Yves Lejeune, Vincent Vionnet, and Samuel Morin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1173–1198, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1173-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1173-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPhysically based multilayer snowpack models suffer from various modelling errors. To represent these errors, we built the new multiphysical ensemble system ESCROC by implementing new representations of different physical processes in a coupled multilayer ground/snowpack model. This system is a promising tool to integrate snow modelling errors in ensemble forecasting and ensemble assimilation systems in support of avalanche hazard forecasting and other snowpack modelling applications.\n\nThe interactions between soilâbiosphereâatmosphere (ISBA) land surface model multi-energy balance (MEB) option in SURFEXv8 â Part 2: Introduction of a litter formulation and model evaluation for local-scale forest sites\n\nAdrien Napoly, Aaron Boone, Patrick Samuelsson, Stefan Gollvik, Eric Martin, Roland Seferian, Dominique Carrer, Bertrand Decharme, and Lionel Jarlan\n\nGeosci.

The evaluation is done with ground-based measurements, satellite data and reference simulations. Studying daily snow depth variations allows to separate different physical processes affecting the snowpack. We show the benefits of AROME kilometric resolution and dynamical behavior in terms of snowpack spatial variability in a mountain range.\n\nBrief communication: Two well-marked cases of aerodynamic adjustment of sastrugi\n\nC. Amory, F. Naaim-Bouvet, H. GallÃ©e, and E. Vignon\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 743–750, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-743-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-743-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents observational characterization of interactions between wind-induced surface roughness and aeolian erosion over a rough surface in coastal East Antarctica. It is shown that the drag caused by small-scale roughness elements can significantly affects the aeolian snow mass flux during an erosion event, depending on the ability of the surface to adjust according to the main wind. Such measurements are essential to improve parameterization schemes for aeolian snow transport models.\n\nAccounting for anthropic energy flux of traffic in winter urban road surface temperature simulations with the TEB model\n\nA. Khalifa, M. Marchetti, L. Bouilloud, E. Martin, M. Bues, and K. Chancibaut\n\nGeosci.

It indicated an RST increase by 1 Â°C to 3 Â°C with respect to the absence of traffic. Additional work was undertaken so as to evaluate to which extent an accurate description of traffic might improve the TEB numerical model when dedicated to RST simulations. Two approaches to traffic integration in this model were detailed and tested.\n\nImpact of climate, vegetation, soil and crop management variables on multi-year ISBA-A-gs simulations of evapotranspiration over a Mediterranean crop site\n\nS.

Evapotranspiration mainly results from soil evaporation when it is simulated over a Mediterranean crop succession. This leads to a high sensitivity to the soil parameters. Errors on soil hydraulic properties can lead to a large bias in cumulative evapotranspiration over a long period of time. Accounting for uncertainties in soil properties is essential for land surface modelling.\n\nSmall farm dams: impact on river flows and sustainability in a context of climate change\n\nF. Habets, E.

We employed a novel combination of investigation techniques to assess the influence of different climatic conditions on high-alpine rock faces. Our results imply that rock walls exposed to freeze–thaw conditions, which are likely to occur at lower elevations, will weather more rapidly than rock walls exposed to sustained freezing conditions due to winter snow cover or permafrost at higher elevations.\n\nSubgridding high-resolution numerical weather forecast in the Canadian Selkirk mountain range for local snow modeling in a remote sensing perspective\n\nPaul Billecocq, Alexandre Langlois, and Benoit Montpetit\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2765–2782, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2765-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2765-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow covers a vast part of the globe, making snow water equivalent (SWE) crucial for climate science and hydrology. SWE can be inversed from satellite data, but the snow's complex structure highly affects the signal, and thus an educated first guess is mandatory. In this study, a subgridding framework was developed to model snow at the local scale from model weather data. The framework enhanced snow parameter modeling, paving the way for SWE inversion algorithms from satellite data.\n\nRapid warming and degradation of mountain permafrost in Norway and Iceland\n\nBernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Ketil Isaksen, Justyna Czekirda, Sebastian Westermann, Christin Hilbich, and Christian Hauck\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5477–5497, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5477-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5477-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost (permanently frozen ground) is widespread in the mountains of Norway and Iceland. Several boreholes were drilled after 1999 for long-term permafrost monitoring. We document a strong warming of permafrost, including the development of unfrozen bodies in the permafrost. Warming and degradation of mountain permafrost may lead to more natural hazards.\n\nImproving climate model skill over High Mountain Asia by adapting snow cover parameterization to complex-topography areas\n\nMickaÃ«l Lalande, Martin MÃ©nÃ©goz, Gerhard Krinner, Catherine OttlÃ©, and FrÃ©dÃ©rique Cheruy\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5095–5130, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5095-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5095-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the impact of topography on snow cover parameterizations using models and observations. Parameterizations without topography-based considerations overestimate snow cover. Incorporating topography reduces snow overestimation by 5–10 % in mountains, in turn reducing cold biases. However, some biases remain, requiring further calibration and more data. Assessing snow cover parameterizations is challenging due to limited and uncertain data in mountainous regions.\n\nBrief communication: How deep is the snow on Mount Everest?\n\nWei Yang, Huabiao Zhao, Baiqing Xu, Jiule Li, Weicai Wang, Guangjian Wu, Zhongyan Wang, and Tandong Yao\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2625–2628, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2625-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2625-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is very strong scientific and public interest regarding the snow thickness on Mountain Everest. Previously reported snow depths derived by different methods and instruments ranged from 0.92 to 3.5 m. Our measurements in 2022 provide the first clear radar image of the snowpack at the top of Mount Everest. The snow thickness at Earth's summit was averaged to be 9.5 Â± 1.2 m. This updated snow thickness is considerably deeper than values reported during the past 5 decades.\n\nSnow sensitivity to temperature and precipitation change during compound coldâhot and wetâdry seasons in the Pyrenees\n\nJosep Bonsoms, Juan Ignacio LÃ³pez-Moreno, and Esteban Alonso-GonzÃ¡lez\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1307–1326, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1307-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1307-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work analyzes the snow response to temperature and precipitation in the Pyrenees. During warm and wet seasons, seasonal snow depth is expected to be reduced by −37 %, −34 %, and −27 % per degree Celsius at low-, mid-, and high-elevation areas, respectively. The largest snow reductions are anticipated at low elevations of the eastern Pyrenees. Results anticipate important impacts on the nearby ecological and socioeconomic systems.\n\nMountain permafrost in the Central Pyrenees: insights from the Devaux ice cave\n\nMiguel BartolomÃ©, GÃ©rard Cazenave, Marc Luetscher, Christoph SpÃ¶tl, Fernando GÃ¡zquez, Ãnchel Belmonte, Alexandra V. Turchyn, Juan Ignacio LÃ³pez-Moreno, and Ana Moreno\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 477–497, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-477-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-477-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work we study the microclimate and the geomorphological features of Devaux ice cave in the Central Pyrenees. The research is based on cave monitoring, geomorphology, and geochemical analyses. We infer two different thermal regimes. The cave is impacted by flooding in late winter/early spring when the main outlets freeze, damming the water inside. Rock temperatures below 0°C and the absence of drip water indicate frozen rock, while relict ice formations record past damming events.\n\nGlacierâpermafrost relations in a high-mountain environment: 5 decades of kinematic monitoring at the Gruben site, Swiss Alps\n\nIsabelle GÃ¤rtner-Roer, Nina Brunner, Reynald Delaloye, Wilfried Haeberli, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, and Patrick Thee\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2083–2101, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2083-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2083-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe intensely investigated the Gruben site in the Swiss Alps, where glaciers and permafrost landforms closely interact, to better understand cold-climate environments. By the interpretation of air photos from 5 decades, we describe long-term developments of the existing landforms. In combination with high-resolution positioning measurements and ground surface temperatures, we were also able to link these to short-term changes and describe different landform responses to climate forcing.\n\nMulti-scale snowdrift-permitting modelling of mountain snowpack\n\nVincent Vionnet, Christopher B. Marsh, Brian Menounos, Simon Gascoin, Nicholas E. Wayand, Joseph Shea, Kriti Mukherjee, and John W. Pomeroy\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 743–769, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-743-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-743-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMountain snow cover provides critical supplies of fresh water to downstream users. Its accurate prediction requires inclusion of often-ignored processes. A multi-scale modelling strategy is presented that efficiently accounts for snow redistribution. Model accuracy is assessed via airborne lidar and optical satellite imagery. With redistribution the model captures the elevation–snow depth relation. Redistribution processes are required to reproduce spatial variability, such as around ridges.\n\nHow much snow falls in the world's mountains? A first look at mountain snowfall estimates in A-train observations and reanalyses\n\nAnne Sophie Daloz, Marian Mateling, Tristan L'Ecuyer, Mark Kulie, Norm B. Wood, Mikael Durand, Melissa Wrzesien, Camilla W. Stjern, and Ashok P. Dimri\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3195–3207, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3195-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3195-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe total of snow that falls globally is a critical factor governing freshwater availability. To better understand how this resource is impacted by climate change, we need to know how reliable the current observational datasets for snow are. Here, we compare five datasets looking at the snow falling over the mountains versus the other continents. We show that there is a large consensus when looking at fractional contributions but strong dissimilarities when comparing magnitudes.\n\nBrief communication: The influence of mica-rich rocks on the shear strength of ice-filled discontinuities\n\nPhilipp Mamot, Samuel Weber, Maximilian Lanz, and Michael Krautblatter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1849–1855, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1849-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1849-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA failure criterion for ice-filled rock joints is a prerequisite to accurately assess the stability of permafrost rock slopes. In 2018 a failure criterion was proposed based on limestone. Now, we tested the transferability to other rocks using mica schist and gneiss which provide the maximum expected deviation of lithological effects on the shear strength. We show that even for controversial rocks the failure criterion stays unaltered, suggesting that it is applicable to mostly all rock types.\n\nResolving the influence of temperature forcing through heat conduction on rock glacier dynamics: a numerical modelling approach\n\nAlessandro Cicoira, Jan Beutel, JÃ©rome Faillettaz, Isabelle GÃ¤rtner-Roer, and Andreas Vieli\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 927–942, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-927-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-927-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRock glacier flow varies on multiple timescales. The variations have been linked to climatic forcing, but a quantitative understanding is still missing. We use a 1-D numerical modelling approach coupling heat conduction to a creep model in order to study the influence of temperature variations on rock glacier flow. Our results show that heat conduction alone cannot explain the observed variations. Other processes, likely linked to water, must dominate the short-term velocity signal.\n\nA temperature- and stress-controlled failure criterion for ice-filled permafrost rock joints\n\nPhilipp Mamot, Samuel Weber, Tanja SchrÃ¶der, and Michael Krautblatter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3333–3353, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3333-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3333-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMost of the observed failures in permafrost-affected alpine rock walls are likely triggered by the mechanical destabilisation of warming bedrock permafrost including ice-filled joints. We present a systematic study of the brittle shear failure of ice and rock–ice contacts along rock joints in a simulated depth â¤ 30 m and at temperatures from −10 to −0.5 Â°C. Warming and sudden reduction in rock overburden due to the detachment of an upper rock mass lead to a significant drop in shear resistance.\n\nQuantifying irreversible movement in steep, fractured bedrock permafrost on Matterhorn (CH)\n\nSamuel Weber, Jan Beutel, JÃ©rome Faillettaz, Andreas Hasler, Michael Krautblatter, and Andreas Vieli\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 567–583, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-567-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-567-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a 8-year continuous time series of measured fracture kinematics and thermal conditions on steep permafrost bedrock at HÃ¶rnligrat, Matterhorn. Based on this unique dataset and a conceptual model for strong fractured bedrock, we develop a novel quantitative approach that allows to separate reversible from irreversible fracture kinematics and assign the dominant forcing. A new index of irreversibility provides useful indication for the occurrence and timing of irreversible displacements.\n\nHow much cryosphere model complexity is just right? Exploration using the conceptual cryosphere hydrology framework\n\nThomas M. Mosier, David F. Hill, and Kendra V. Sharp\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 2147–2171, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2147-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2147-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur paper presents the Conceptual Cryosphere Hydrology Framework (CCHF), a tool to enable more rapid development and intercomparison of cryosphere process representations. Using the CCHF, we demonstrate that some common existing degree index cryosphere models are not well suited for assessing impacts across climates, even though these models appear to perform well under a common evaluation strategy. We show that more robust models can be formulated without increasing data input requirements.\n\nSmall-scale variation of snow in a regional permafrost model\n\nKjersti GisnÃ¥s, Sebastian Westermann, Thomas Vikhamar Schuler, Kjetil Melvold, and Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1201–1215, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1201-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1201-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn wind exposed areas snow redistribution results in large spatial variability in ground temperatures. In these areas, the ground temperature of a grid cell must be determined based on the distribution, and not the average, of snow depths. We employ distribution functions of snow in a regional permafrost model, showing highly improved representation of ground temperatures. By including snow distributions, we find the permafrost area to be nearly twice as large as what is modelled without.\n\nMeteorological, elevation, and slope effects on surface hoar formation\n\nS. Horton, M. Schirmer, and B. Jamieson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 1523–1533, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1523-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1523-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate how various meteorological and terrain factors affect surface hoar formation in complex terrain. We modelled the distribution of three surface hoar layers with a coupled NWP - snow cover model, and verified the model with field studies. The layers developed in regions and elevation bands with warm moist air, light winds, and cold snow surfaces. Possible avalanche forecasting applications are discussed.\n\nVerification of analysed and forecasted winter precipitation in complex terrain\n\nM. Schirmer and B. Jamieson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 587–601, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-587-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-587-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are rarely verified for mountainous regions during the winter season, although avalanche forecasters and other decision makers frequently rely on NWP models. We verified two NWP models (GEM-LAM and GEM15) and a precipitation analysis system (CaPA) at approximately 100 stations in the mountains of western Canada and northwestern USA. Ultrasonic snow depth sensors and snow pillows were used to observe daily precipitation amounts.\n\nSoil erosion and organic carbon export by wet snow avalanches\n\nO. Korup and C.
