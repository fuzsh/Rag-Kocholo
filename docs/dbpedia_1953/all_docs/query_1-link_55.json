In the playoffs the Wings would turn it up a notch beating the Chicago Blackhawks in 6 games for a finals rematch with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In each of the first 3 games the winning goal was scored in the final minute. The Wings looked poised for victory playing Game 6 in Detroit, but a heartbreaking loss in OT would lead to a 4-0 defeat in Game 7 as the Leafs won their 3rd straight cup."
