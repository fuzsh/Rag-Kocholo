        "text": "Once you have properly sized your feet and have narrowed down which skate line is best for you, it’s time to choose the proper level of play. If you haven’t sized your feet yet, head over to our How To Size An Ice Hockey Skate page first.\n\nHere at IW Hockey, we categorize ice hockey skates into three categories: Recreational, Performance, and Elite. It’s important to choose the right level of play in order to maximize your performance on the ice.\n\nIn order to know the differences in each level, we need to know the anatomy of the skate. The quarter package, toe box, skate tongue, tendon guard, outsole, holder and runners.\n\nRecreational skates are built for the new-to-hockey player or casual skaters that are looking for an affordable option. These are great starter skates, especially for youth players.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is the size or weight of the skater. While recreational skates are designed for the beginner, heavier adult skaters can create more force than the skates were designed to handle and results in a premature breakdown. In a scenario such as this, we would advise looking at performance-level skates so you save money in the long run since the skates will last longer and you will not need to replace them as quickly.\n\nUpper: The quarter package is the skate’s boot. For a new-to-hockey player, a softer quarter package will feel much more comfortable and is the best choice for players looking to learn the skating stride. If the boot is too stiff, it is not just uncomfortable but it hinders the learning process too. In a similar fashion, the outsole aka the sole of the boot is softer at this recreational level in order to allow additional flex.\n\nLower: These skates do not come with removable runners (blades) which is okay since a player may be ready to step up to the performance-level skate by the time they wear out."
