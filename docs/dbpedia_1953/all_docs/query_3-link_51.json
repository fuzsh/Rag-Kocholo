        "text": "CLASSIFICATION IN PARA ICE HOCKEY\n\nThis is a brief overview of classification in the sport and is in no way legally binding. In all cases the sport-specific classification rules will take precedence. For further questions please contact info@worldparaicehockey.org.\n\nWHAT IS CLASSIFICATION?\n\nIn order to safeguard the integrity of fair competition, all Para sports have a system in place which aims to ensure that winning is determined by sporting factors such as skill, fitness, power, endurance, tactical ability and mental focus, the same factors that account for success in sport for able bodied athletes.\n\nThis system is called classification.\n\nThrough classification, it is determined which athletes are eligible to compete in a sport and how those athletes are then grouped together for competition, in order to minimise the impact of those athletes’ impairments on sport performance.\n\nClassification is sport-specific because an impairment affects the ability to perform in different sports to a different extent. As a consequence, an athlete may meet the criteria to compete in one sport, but may not meet the criteria in another sport. Having an impairment is thus not sufficient for an athlete to compete in Para sport.\n\nThe groupings of athletes by the degree of activity limitation resulting from their impairments are called ‘Sport Classes’. This, to a certain extent, is similar to grouping athletes by age, gender or weight.\n\nClassification across the Paralympic Movement is governed by the IPC Athlete Classification Code and Standards. More information about classification can be found here.\n\nCLASSIFICATION IN PARA ICE HOCKEY\n\nThe details of classification in Para ice hockey are set out in the World Para Ice Hockey Classification Rules and Regulations (link below).\n\nAthletes must have one of the eligible impairments and meet the minimum impairment criteria for the sport set out in those rules in order to be eligible to compete.\n\nELIGIBLE IMPAIRMENTS FOR PARA ICE HOCKEY\n\nAll athletes in Para ice hockey have one or more of the following impairments:\n\nLimb deficiency\n\nImpaired Muscle Power\n\nImpaired Passive Range of Motion\n\nAtaxia, athetosis, hypertonia\n\nLeg length difference\n\nSPORT CLASSES IN PARA ICE HOCKEY\n\nIn Para Ice Hockey there is only one sport class. All athletes in the sport class have an impairment in the lower part of their body. All players on a team must meet the minimum impairment criteria to compete in Para ice hockey.\n\nFORMS AND DOCUMENTS\n\nWorld Para Ice Hockey Classification Rules (Updated July 2017)\n\nWorld Para Medical Review Request Form (Uploaded October 2020)"
