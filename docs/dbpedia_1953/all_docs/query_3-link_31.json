        "text": "How do we measure the Height of a Stick?\n\nTo measure the exact height of a stick, we lean the stick next to a wall standing straight up. We then measure it from the floor up to the top end of the stick. This is how we get the height values of individual sticks in our online shop.\n\nHow do I know if the stick I buy will be high enough for me?\n\nWe recommend you to measure your existing stick following the procedure outlined above. If your current stick is longer than a selected stick in our shop, you can order a wooden extension or ask us to extend your newly bought stick for you.\n\nTo give you a rough estimate of your (ideal) stick height, you can use the following formula:\n\nYour height - 15 cm = stick height\n\nNote: the above formula is only a guideline. The height of a hockey stick is a matter of personal preference. To learn more about choosing the right stick height consult our comprehensive manual on How to choose the right hockey stick.\n\nStandard Blade Pattern Charts\n\nBAUER Standard Blade Patterns\n\nCCM Standard Blade Patterns\n\nEASTON Standard Blade Patterns\n\nSHERWOOD Standard Blade Patterns\n\nTRUE Standard Blade Patterns\n\nWARRIOR Standard Blade Patterns\n\nDelivery times and Shipping rates\n\nWhere do you ship from?\n\nAll our products are packed and shipped from Slovenia, European Union.\n\nHow fast will my order be processed?\n\nOrders accepted and payed until 12:00 on working day, leave our store the same day, orders accepted and payed after 12:00 on working day, leave our store the next business day.\n\nDo you offer FREE shipping?\n\nWe provide FREE STANDARD Shipping on all orders from 199 € (Tax incl.) limited to countries of European Union.\n\nShipping rates & delivery times within European Union\n\nShipping rates\n\nECONOMY\n\n(up to 0,5 kg)*STANDARD STANDARD PLUSEXPRESS Carrier:Slovenian PostGLSDHLDHLPrice:4,99 €9,99 €19,99 €39,99 €\n\n*does not provide Shipment tracking service.\n\nDelivery times\n\nFor Estimated delivery times to your country please consult the table below:\n\nECONOMY\n\nSTANDARD & STANDARD PLUS\n\nEXPRESS\n\nCountryWorking daysWorking daysWorking daysAustria5-102-3Next dayBelgium5-104-5Next dayBulgaria5-103Next dayCzech Republic5-103-4Next dayCroatia5-101-2Next dayDenmark5-104-5Next dayEstonia5-103-4Next dayFinland5-105-71-2France5-104-5Next dayGermany5-102-3Next dayGreece5-103-4Next dayHungary5-102Next dayIreland5-105-61-2Italy5-102Next dayLatvia5-103-5Next dayLithuania5-104-5Next dayLuxembourg5-102-3Next dayMalta5-10-2Netherlands5-104-5Next dayPoland5-104-5Next dayPortugal5-105-6Next dayRomania5-103-4Next daySlovakia5-103-4Next daySpain5-105-6Next daySweden5-105-7Next day\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nWe ship our products to United Kingdom via DHL (Standard or Express) shipping services.\n\nStandard Shipping to United Kingdom costs 15,99 €.
