        "text": "DETROIT >> Henrik Zetterberg was not on the Detroit Red Wings’ radar as his draft year approached.\n\nThat quickly changed when then-assistant general manager Jim Nill and scout Hakan Andersson when to scout other players in Sweden they had an interest in.\n\n“The little 5-foot-10 player, that wasn’t overly big and wasn’t a great skater, but had the puck a lot, grabbed their attention,” Wings general manager Ken Holland said.\n\nThe Wings took that player in the seventh round, 210th overall, of the 1999 draft, and the rest is history.\n\n“Throughout his career he’s close to a point a game, great defensively, he’s a warrior, he’s a competitor, he plays with pride, he’s a tremendous leader on an off the ice,” Holland said. “He leads by example. He makes players around him better because of his ability to distribute the puck, because of his ability to check.\n\n“He plays with a ton of pride,” Holland added. “Fiercely competitive, and I think you’ve seen the last little while, as our season has been on the line, he’s been physical, goes to the hard areas, giving body checks, taking body checks.”\n\nZetterberg will play in his 1,000 game on Sunday when the Wings host the New Jersey Devils, which will also be the last game played at Joe Louis Arena.\n\n“I still remember the draft, it was in Boston,” Nill said. “We didn’t have any picks. Our first pick was the fourth-round, and we took Jari Tolsa. We took Henrik with the (fourth) pick. There’s enough there that we liked, but to say that he would become a potential, one of the best players in the game, you’d never dream that. But that shows, in the hockey business, the scouting business, you’re drafting the players and you hope they got the right tools to make it work, but in the end, it’s Henrik Zetterberg’s will and his hard work that made him what he was.\n\n“He’s one of the hardest-working guys in practice,” Nill added. “He’s one of the hardest-working guys off the ice, that’s why he made it. He’s got the determination.”\n\nZetterberg will join an elite list of Red Wings to have appeared in 1,000 games with the organization – Gordie Howe (1,687), Nicklas Lidstrom (1,564), Alex Delvecchio (1,549), Steve Yzerman (1,514), Kris Draper (1,137) and Tomas Holmstrom (1,026).\n\n“That (1,000) will end up at (Sunday’s) game makes it even more special,” Zetterberg said. “I couldn’t have picked a better game, I think. Just how it all fell out to be that game is remarkable.\n\n“I knew that it could be this game in November,” Zetterberg added. “So it’s been a challenge to play all the games and obviously had this in mind for a while.”\n\nAt 36 years old, Zetterberg has been the team’s MVP this season. He leads the team in points with 66 (16 goals, 50 assists) and leads all forwards in average ice time (19:44).\n\n“He tries to will the team to victory, and that’s certainly what he did in 2008 when we won the Cup and he was the Conn Smythe Trophy winner, and it’s what he continues to do almost 10 years later in 2017 when he’s trying down the stretch of the last half of the season to will our team to wins and stay in the playoff race,” Holland said.\n\nZetterberg ranks seventh all-time with 902 points and is fifth in the playoffs with 120 points in 137 games.\n\n“Anybody that seems to play with Henrik seems to play a lot better with him than without him,” Holland said. “I think that speaks to Henrik’s ability to distribute the puck, defend and be able to get the puck back so that you can play with the puck.\n\n“All those things I’ve talked about, will, determination, pride, he’s obviously got a great pair of hands, he’s got hockey sense, but what separates him apart is his determination and his will to compete to go to the hard areas,” Holland added."
