Prohibitins form a heterodimeric complex, consisting of two proteins, prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and prohibitin 2 (PHB2). They have been discovered to have crucial roles in regulating cancer and other metabolic diseases, functioning both together and independently. As there have been many previously published reviews on PHB1, this review focuses on the lesser studied prohibitin, PHB2. The role of PHB2 in cancer is controversial. In most human cancers, overexpressed PHB2 enhances tumor progression, while in some cancers, it suppresses tumor progression. In this review, we focus on (1) the history, family, and structure of prohibitins, (2) the essential location-dependent functions of PHB2, (3) dysfunction in cancer, and (4) the promising modulators to target PHB2. At the end, we discuss future directions and the clinical significance of this common essential gene in cancer.

Ion channels are specialized proteins that play a crucial role in the electrical activity of nerve cells by controlling the flow of ions such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. When these channels are not functioning properly, they can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms such as seizures, movement disorders, and cognitive impairment. In this context, the axon initial segment (AIS) is the site of action potential initiation in most neurons. This region is characterized by a high density of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), which are responsible for the rapid depolarization that occurs when the neuron is stimulated. The AIS is also enriched in other ion channels, such as potassium channels, that play a role in shaping the action potential waveform and determining the firing frequency of the neuron. In addition to ion channels, the AIS contains a complex cytoskeletal structure that helps to anchor the channels in place and regulate their function. Therefore, alterations in this complex structure of ion channels, scaffold proteins, and specialized cytoskeleton may also cause brain channelopathies not necessarily associated with ion channel mutations. This review will focus on how the AISs structure, plasticity, and composition alterations may generate changes in action potentials and neuronal dysfunction leading to brain diseases. AIS function alterations may be the consequence of voltage-gated ion channel mutations, but also may be due to ligand-activated channels and receptors and AIS structural and membrane proteins that support the function of voltage-gated ion channels.

They are believed to be the repair sites for complex, potentially lethal DNA double strand breaks. However, the features of their post-radiation dose-dependent quantitative changes and their role in the processes of cell death and senescence are still insufficiently studied. For the first time in one work, a simultaneous study of the association of changes in the number of residual foci of key DNA damage response (DDR) proteins (γH2AX, pATM, 53BP1, p-p53), the proportion of caspase-3 positive, LC-3 II autophagic and SA-β-gal senescent cells was carried out 24–72 h after fibroblast irradiation with X-rays at doses of 1–10 Gy. It was shown that with an increase in time after irradiation from 24 h to 72 h, the number of residual foci and the proportion of caspase-3 positive cells decrease, while the proportion of senescent cells, on the contrary, increases. The highest number of autophagic cells was noted 48 h after irradiation. In general, the results obtained provide important information for understanding the dynamics of the development of a dose-dependent cellular response in populations of irradiated fibroblasts.

In this systematic review, we analyzed recent studies on the roles of arecoline and ANO in cancer and strategies to block carcinogenesis. In the oral cavity, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 oxidizes arecoline to ANO, and both alkaloids conjugate with N-acetylcysteine to form mercapturic acid compounds, which are excreted in urine, reducing arecoline and ANO toxicity. However, detoxification may not be complete. Arecoline and ANO upregulated protein expression in oral cancer tissue from areca nut users compared to expression levels in adjacent normal tissue, suggesting a causal relationship between these compounds and oral cancer. Sublingual fibrosis, hyperplasia, and oral leukoplakia were diagnosed in mice subjected to oral mucosal smearing of ANO. ANO is more cytotoxic and genotoxic than arecoline. During carcinogenesis and metastasis, these compounds increase the expression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducers such as reactive oxygen species, transforming growth factor-β1, Notch receptor-1, and inflammatory cytokines, and they activate EMT-related proteins. Arecoline-induced epigenetic markers such as sirtuin-1 hypermethylation, low protein expression of miR-22, and miR-886-3-p accelerate oral cancer progression. Antioxidants and targeted inhibitors of the EMT inducers used reduce the risk of oral cancer development and progression. Our review findings substantiate the association of arecoline and ANO with oral cancer. Both of these single compounds are likely carcinogenic to humans, and their mechanisms and pathways of carcinogenesis are useful indicators for cancer therapy and prognosis.

While attention has been focused on neurodegeneration in AD pathogenesis, recent decades have provided evidence of the importance of microglia, and resident immune cells in the central nervous system. In addition, new technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing, have revealed heterogeneous cell states of microglia in AD. In this review, we systematically summarize the microglial response to amyloid-β and tau tangles, and the risk factor genes expressed in microglia. Furthermore, we discuss the characteristics of protective microglia that appear during AD pathology and the relationship between AD and microglia-induced inflammation during chronic pain. Understanding the diverse roles of microglia will help identify new therapeutic strategies for AD.

These neurons being affected in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, before pathological changes in the central nervous system (CNS) become detectable is currently a subject of discussion. Understanding how to protect these neurons is, therefore, particularly important. Since it has already been shown that the neurosteroid progesterone mediates neuroprotective effects in the CNS and PNS, it is now equally important to see whether progesterone has similar effects in the ENS. For this purpose, the RT-qPCR analyses of laser microdissected ENS neurons were performed, showing for the first time the expression of the different progesterone receptors (PR-A/B; mPRa, mPRb, PGRMC1) in rats at different developmental stages. This was also confirmed in ENS ganglia using immunofluorescence techniques and confocal laser scanning microscopy. To analyze the potential neuroprotective effects of progesterone in the ENS, we stressed dissociated ENS cells with rotenone to induce damage typical of Parkinson’s disease. The potential neuroprotective effects of progesterone were then analyzed in this system. Treatment of cultured ENS neurons with progesterone reduced cell death by 45%, underscoring the tremendous neuroprotective potential of progesterone in the ENS. The additional administration of the PGRMC1 antagonist AG205 abolished the observed effect, indicating the crucial role of PGRMC1 with regard to the neuroprotective effect of progesterone.

Although it is found in many cells and tissues, PPARγ is mostly expressed in the liver and adipose tissue. Preclinical and clinical studies show that PPARγ targets several genes implicated in various forms of chronic liver disease, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate the beneficial effects of PPARγ agonists on NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Understanding PPARγ regulators may therefore aid in unraveling the mechanisms governing the development and progression of NAFLD. Recent advances in high-throughput biology and genome sequencing have greatly facilitated the identification of epigenetic modifiers, including DNA methylation, histone modifiers, and non-coding RNAs as key factors that regulate PPARγ in NAFLD. In contrast, little is still known about the particular molecular mechanisms underlying the intricate relationships between these events. The paper that follows outlines our current understanding of the crosstalk between PPARγ and epigenetic regulators in NAFLD. Advances in this field are likely to aid in the development of early noninvasive diagnostics and future NAFLD treatment strategies based on PPARγ epigenetic circuit modification.

As it relates to the central nervous system, WNT signaling plays several roles as it relates to neurogenesis, synaptic formation, memory, and learning. Thus, dysfunction of this pathway is associated with multiple diseases and disorders, including several neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by several pathologies, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. In this review, we will discuss the various epidemiological, clinical, and animal studies that demonstrate a precise link between aberrant WNT signaling and AD-associated pathologies. In turn, we will discuss the manner in which WNT signaling influences multiple molecular, biochemical, and cellular pathways upstream of these end-point pathologies. Finally, we will discuss how merging tools and technologies can be used to generate next generation cellular models to dissect the relationship between WNT signaling and AD.

Progenitor cell therapy can restore myocardial structure and function. However, its efficacy is severely limited by cell aging and senescence. Gremlin-1 (GREM1), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist family, has been implicated in cell proliferation and survival. However, GREM1’s role in cell aging and senescence has never been investigated in human cardiac mesenchymal progenitor cells (hMPCs). Therefore, this study assessed the hypothesis that overexpression of GREM1 rejuvenates the cardiac regenerative potential of aging hMPCs to a youthful stage and therefore allows better capacity for myocardial repair. We recently reported that a subpopulation of hMPCs with low mitochondrial membrane potential can be sorted from right atrial appendage-derived cells in patients with cardiomyopathy and exhibit cardiac reparative capacity in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. In this study, lentiviral particles were used to overexpress GREM1 in these hMPCs. Protein and mRNA expression were assessed through Western blot and RT-qPCR. FACS analysis for Annexin V/PI staining and lactate dehydrogenase assay were used to assess cell survival. It was observed that cell aging and cell senescence led to a decrease in GREM1 expression. In addition, overexpression of GREM1 led to a decrease in expression of senescence genes. Overexpression of GREM1 led to no significant change in cell proliferation. However, GREM1 appeared to have an anti-apoptotic effect, with an increase in survival and decrease in cytotoxicity evident in GREM1-overexpressing hMPCs. Overexpressing GREM1 also induced cytoprotective properties by decreasing reactive oxidative species and mitochondrial membrane potential. This result was associated with increased expression of antioxidant proteins, such as SOD1 and catalase, and activation of the ERK/NRF2 survival signal pathway. Inhibition of ERK led to a decrease in GREM1-mediated rejuvenation in terms of cell survival, which suggests that an ERK-dependent pathway may be involved. Taken altogether, these results indicate that overexpression of GREM1 can allow aging hMPCs to adopt a more robust phenotype with improved survival capacity, which is associated with an activated ERK/NRF2 antioxidant signal pathway.

Different studies have shown that CAR activation results in metabolic disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, by activating lipogenesis in the liver. Our objective was to determine whether synergistic activations of the CAR/RXR heterodimer could occur in vivo as described in vitro by other authors, and to assess the metabolic consequences. For this purpose, six pesticides, ligands of CAR, were selected, and Tri-butyl-tin (TBT) was used as an RXR agonist. In mice, CAR’s synergic activation was induced by dieldrin associated with TBT, and combined effects were induced by propiconazole, bifenox, boscalid, and bupirimate. Moreover, a steatosis, characterized by increased triglycerides, was observed when TBT was combined with dieldrin, propiconazole, bifenox, boscalid, and bupirimate. Metabolic disruption appeared in the form of increased cholesterol and lowered free fatty acid plasma levels. An in-depth analysis revealed increased expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis and lipid import. These results contribute to the growing understanding of how environmental contaminants can influence nuclear receptor activity and associated health risks.

While this is a promising route for bone repair, achieving effective cartilage vascularisation remains a challenge. Here, we investigated how mineralisation of tissue-engineered cartilage affects its pro-angiogenic potential. To generate in vitro mineralised cartilage, human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC)-derived chondrogenic pellets were treated with β-glycerophosphate (BGP). After optimising this approach, we characterised the changes in matrix components and pro-angiogenic factors by gene expression analysis, histology and ELISA. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to pellet-derived conditioned media, and migration, proliferation and tube formation were assessed. We established a reliable strategy to induce in vitro cartilage mineralisation, whereby hMSC pellets are chondrogenically primed with TGF-β for 2 weeks and BGP is added from week 2 of culture. Cartilage mineralisation determines loss of glycosaminoglycans, reduced expression but not protein abundance of collagen II and X, and decreased VEGFA production. Finally, the conditioned medium from mineralised pellets showed a reduced ability to stimulate endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation. The pro-angiogenic potential of transient cartilage is thus stage-dependent, and this aspect must be carefully considered in the design of bone tissue engineering strategies.

Although the clinical course is less aggressive than that of its IDH wildtype counterpart, recent discoveries have shown that epileptic activity can promote tumor proliferation. However, it is not known if antiepileptic drugs confer additional value by inhibiting tumor growth. In this study, the antineoplastic properties of 20 FDA-approved antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were tested in six patient-derived IDHmut glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). Cell proliferation was assessed using the CellTiterGlo-3D assay. Two of the screened drugs (oxcarbazepine and perampanel) demonstrated an antiproliferative effect. A subsequent eight-point dose–response curve proved the dose-dependent growth inhibition for both drugs, but only oxcarbazepine reached an IC50 value below 100 µM in 5/6 GSCs (mean 44.7 µM; range 17.4–98.0 µM), approximating the possible cmax for oxcarbazepine in patient serums. Furthermore, the treated GSC spheroids were 82% smaller (mean volume 1.6 nL vs. 8.7 nL; p = 0.01 (live/deadTM fluorescence staining)), and the apoptotic events increased by more than 50% (caspase-3/7 activity; p = 0.006). Taken together, this drug screen of a large series of antiepileptic drugs identified oxcarbazepine as a potent proapoptotic drug in IDHmut GSCs, which combines antiepileptic and antineoplastic properties to treat this seizure-prone patient population.

It also plays a vital role in the development of neoplastic disorders. Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a vasoactive synthetic methyl xanthine derivative used for decades to manage chronic occlusive vascular disorders. Recently, it has been proposed that PTX might have an inhibitory effect on the angiogenesis process. Here, we reviewed the modulatory effects of PTX on angiogenesis and its potential benefits in the clinical setting. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. While sixteen studies demonstrated that pentoxifylline had an antiangiogenic effect, four suggested it had a proangiogenic effect, and two other studies showed it did not affect angiogenesis. All studies were either in vivo animal studies or in vitro animal and human cell models. Our findings suggest that pentoxifylline may affect the angiogenic process in experimental models. However, there is insufficient evidence to establish its role as an anti-angiogenesis agent in the clinical setting. These gaps in our knowledge regarding how pentoxifylline is implicated in host-biased metabolically taxing angiogenic switch may be via its adenosine A2BAR G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) mechanism. GPCR receptors reinforce the importance of research to understand the mechanistic action of these drugs on the body as promising metabolic candidates. The specific mechanisms and details of the effects of pentoxifylline on host metabolism and energy homeostasis remain to be elucidated.

Recent data point to SARS-CoV-2 viral infections in the human testis. As low testosterone levels are associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral infections in males and human Leydig cells are the main source of testosterone, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 could infect human Leydig cells and impair their function. We successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid in testicular Leydig cells of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, providing evidence that Leydig cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. We then employed human Leydig-like cells (hLLCs) to show that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is highly expressed in hLLCs. Using a cell binding assay and a SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped viral vector (SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovector), we showed that SARS-CoV-2 could enter hLLCs and increase testosterone production by hLLCs. We further combined the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovector system with pseudovector-based inhibition assays to show that SARS-CoV-2 enters hLLCs through pathways distinct from those of monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, a typical model used to study SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms. We finally revealed that neuropilin-1 and cathepsin B/L are expressed in hLLCs and human testes, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may enter hLLCs through these receptors or proteases. In conclusion, our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can enter hLLCs through a distinct pathway and alter testosterone production.

The Fyn tyrosine kinase (Fyn) suppresses autophagy in the muscle. However, its role in kidney autophagic processes is unclear. Here, we examined the role of Fyn kinase in autophagy in proximal renal tubules both in vivo and in vitro. Phospho-proteomic analysis revealed that transglutaminase 2 (Tgm2), a protein involved in the degradation of p53 in the autophagosome, is phosphorylated on tyrosine 369 (Y369) by Fyn. Interestingly, we found that Fyn-dependent phosphorylation of Tgm2 regulates autophagy in proximal renal tubules in vitro, and that p53 expression is decreased upon autophagy in Tgm2-knockdown proximal renal tubule cell models. Using streptozocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemic mice, we confirmed that Fyn regulated autophagy and mediated p53 expression via Tgm2. Taken together, these data provide a molecular basis for the role of the Fyn–Tgm2–p53 axis in the development of DKD.

PVAT is a metabolically active, endocrine organ capable of regulating blood vessel tone, endothelium function, vascular smooth muscle cell growth and proliferation, and contributing critically to cardiovascular disease onset and progression. In the context of vascular tone regulation, under physiological conditions, PVAT exerts a potent anticontractile effect by releasing a plethora of vasoactive substances, including NO, H2S, H2O2, prostacyclin, palmitic acid methyl ester, angiotensin 1-7, adiponectin, leptin, and omentin. However, under certain pathophysiological conditions, PVAT exerts pro-contractile effects by decreasing the production of anticontractile and increasing that of pro-contractile factors, including superoxide anion, angiotensin II, catecholamines, prostaglandins, chemerin, resistin, and visfatin. The present review discusses the regulatory effect of PVAT on vascular tone and the factors involved. In this scenario, dissecting the precise role of PVAT is a prerequisite to the development of PVAT-targeted therapies.

Despite major advances, obtaining a comprehensive understanding of context-dependent MLL-AF9-mediated gene programs during early hematopoiesis is challenging. Here, we generated a human inducible pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model with a doxycycline dose-dependent MLL-AF9 expression. We exploited MLL-AF9 expression as an oncogenic hit to uncover epigenetic and transcriptomic effects on iPSC-derived hematopoietic development and the transformation into (pre-)leukemic states. In doing so, we observed a disruption in early myelomonocytic development. Accordingly, we identified gene profiles that were consistent with primary MLL-AF9 AML and uncovered high-confidence MLL-AF9-associated core genes that are faithfully represented in primary MLL-AF9 AML, including known and presently unknown factors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identified an increase of CD34 expressing early hematopoietic progenitor-like cell states as well as granulocyte-monocyte progenitor-like cells upon MLL-AF9 activation. Our system allows for careful chemically controlled and stepwise in vitro hiPSC-derived differentiation under serum-free and feeder-free conditions. For a disease that currently lacks effective precision medicine, our system provides a novel entry-point into exploring potential novel targets for personalized therapeutic strategies.

Activity of pre-sympathetic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and in the ventrolateral and ventromedial medulla (VLM/VMM) largely influence the sympathetic output. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a role in the development and progression of metabolic diseases; however, despite the importance of the central circuits, the excitability of pre-sympathetic liver-related neurons remains to be determined. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the activity of liver-related neurons in the PVN and VLM/VMM is altered in diet-induced obese mice, as well as their response to insulin. Patch-clamp recordings were conducted from liver-related PVN neurons, VLM-projecting PVN neurons, and pre-sympathetic liver-related neurons in the ventral brainstem. Our data demonstrate that the excitability of liver-related PVN neurons increased in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice compared to mice fed with control diet. Insulin receptor expression was detected in a population of liver-related neurons, and insulin suppressed the firing activity of liver-related PVN and pre-sympathetic VLM/VMM neurons in HFD mice; however, it did not affect VLM-projecting liver-related PVN neurons. These findings further suggest that HFD alters the excitability of pre-autonomic neurons as well as their response to insulin.

Specific disease-modifying interventions are currently not available for many of these rare conditions, which underscores the necessity of finding effective symptomatic therapies. During the past five to ten years, an increasing number of randomized controlled trials have been conducted examining the potential of different non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to induce symptomatic improvement. In addition, a few smaller studies have explored deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the dentate nucleus as an invasive means to directly modulate cerebellar output, thereby aiming to alleviate ataxia severity. In this paper, we comprehensively review the clinical and neurophysiological effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and dentate nucleus DBS in patients with hereditary ataxias, as well as the presumed underlying mechanisms at the cellular and network level and perspectives for future research.

Traditionally, PSCs were studied in 2D cultures or monolayers, without considering the spatial organization of a developing embryo. However, recent research demonstrated that PSCs can form 3D structures that simulate the blastocyst and gastrula stages and other events, such as amniotic cavity formation or somitogenesis. This breakthrough provides an unparalleled opportunity to study human embryogenesis by examining the interactions, cytoarchitecture and spatial organization among multiple cell lineages, which have long remained a mystery due to the limitations of studying in utero human embryos. In this review, we will provide an overview of how experimental embryology currently utilizes models such as blastoids, gastruloids and other 3D aggregates derived from PSCs to advance our understanding of the intricate processes involved in human embryo development.

Super-enhancers have been shown to be strongly associated with the expression of genes crucial for cell differentiation, cell stability maintenance, and tumorigenesis. Our goal was to systematize research studies dedicated to the investigation of structure and functions of super-enhancers as well as to define further perspectives of the field in various applications, such as drug development and clinical use. We overviewed the fundamental studies which provided experimental data on various pathologies and their associations with particular super-enhancers. The analysis of mainstream approaches for SE search and prediction allowed us to accumulate existing data and propose directions for further algorithmic improvements of SEs’ reliability levels and efficiency. Thus, here we provide the description of the most robust algorithms such as ROSE, imPROSE, and DEEPSEN and suggest their further use for various research and development tasks. The most promising research direction, which is based on topic and number of published studies, are cancer-associated super-enhancers and prospective SE-targeted therapy strategies, most of which are discussed in this review.

When nerve lesions form, SCs are destroyed, ultimately hindering nerve repair. The difficulty in treating nerve repair is exacerbated due to SC’s limited and slow expansion capacity. Therapeutic use of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) is emerging in combating peripheral nerve injury due to these cells’ SC differentiation capability and can be harvested easily in large numbers. Despite ASC’s therapeutic potential, their transdifferentiation period typically takes more than two weeks. In this study, we demonstrate that metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) technology enhances ASC differentiation into SCs. Specifically, the sugar analog Ac5ManNTProp (TProp), which modulates cell surface sialylation, significantly improved ASC differentiation with upregulated SC protein S100β and p75NGFR expression and elevated the neurotrophic factors nerve growth factor beta (NGFβ) and glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). TProp treatment remarkably reduced the SC transdifferentiation period from about two weeks to two days in vitro, which has the potential to improve neuronal regeneration and facilitate future use of ASCs in regenerative medicine.

Exposure to elevated temperature (hyperthermia) is proposed as a non-pharmacological, anti-inflammatory treatment for these disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we asked if the inflammasome, a protein complex essential for orchestrating the inflammatory response and linked to mitochondrial stress, might be modulated by elevated temperatures. To test this, in preliminary studies, immortalized bone-marrow-derived murine macrophages (iBMM) were primed with inflammatory stimuli, exposed to a range of temperatures (37–41.5 °C), and examined for markers of inflammasome and mitochondrial activity. We found that exposure to mild heat stress (39 °C for 15 min) rapidly inhibited iBMM inflammasome activity. Furthermore, heat exposure led to decreased ASC speck formation and increased numbers of polarized mitochondria. These results suggest that mild hyperthermia inhibits inflammasome activity in the iBMM, limiting potentially harmful inflammation and mitigating mitochondrial stress. Our findings suggest an additional potential mechanism by which hyperthermia may exert its beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases.

Therapeutic options targeting mitochondria include enhancing metabolism, suppressing reactive oxygen production and disrupting mitochondria-mediated programmed cell death pathways. Herein is reviewed mechanistic evidence supporting a meaningful pathophysiological role for the constellation of abnormal mitochondrial fusion, fission and transport, collectively designated mitochondrial dysdynamism, in ALS. Following this is a discussion on preclinical studies in ALS mice that seemingly validate the idea that normalizing mitochondrial dynamism can delay ALS by interrupting a vicious cycle of mitochondrial degeneration, leading to neuronal die-back and death. Finally, the relative benefits of suppressing mitochondrial fusion vs. enhancing mitochondrial fusion in ALS are speculated upon, and the paper concludes with the prediction that the two approaches could be additive or synergistic, although a side-by-side comparative trial may be challenging to perform.

Although MCs are essential to the healthy immune response, their overactivity and pathological states can lead to numerous health hazards. The side effect of mast cell activity is usually caused by degranulation. It can be triggered by immunological factors, such as immunoglobulins, lymphocytes, or antigen–antibody complexes, and non-immune factors, such as radiation and pathogens. An intensive reaction of mast cells can even lead to anaphylaxis, one of the most life-threatening allergic reactions. What is more, mast cells play a role in the tumor microenvironment by modulating various events of tumor biology, such as cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis. The mechanisms of the mast cell actions are still poorly understood, making it difficult to develop therapies for their pathological condition. This review focuses on the possible therapies targeting mast cell degranulation, anaphylaxis, and MC-derived tumors.

Oxysterols act through various cellular receptors and serve as a key metabolic signal, coordinating inflammation. GDM is a condition of low-grade chronic inflammation accompanied by altered inflammatory profiles in the mother, placenta and fetus. Higher levels of two oxysterols, namely 7-ketocholesterol (7-ketoC) and 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OHC), were observed in fetoplacental endothelial cells (fpEC) and cord blood of GDM offspring. In this study, we tested the effects of 7-ketoC and 7β-OHC on inflammation and investigated the underlying mechanisms involved. Primary fpEC in culture treated with 7-ketoC or 7β-OHC, induced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signaling, which resulted in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Liver-X receptor (LXR) activation is known to repress inflammation. Treatment with LXR synthetic agonist T0901317 dampened oxysterol-induced inflammatory responses. Probucol, an inhibitor of LXR target gene ATP-binding cassette transporter A-1 (ABCA-1), antagonized the protective effects of T0901317, suggesting a potential involvement of ABCA-1 in LXR-mediated repression of inflammatory signaling in fpEC. TLR-4 inhibitor Tak-242 attenuated pro-inflammatory signaling induced by oxysterols downstream of the TLR-4 inflammatory signaling cascade. Taken together, our findings suggest that 7-ketoC and 7β-OHC contribute to placental inflammation through the activation of TLR-4. Pharmacologic activation of LXR in fpEC decelerates its shift to a pro-inflammatory phenotype in the presence of oxysterols.

Here, A3B mRNA and protein expression levels were quantified in different cell lines and breast tumors and related to cell cycle markers using RT-qPCR and multiplex immunofluorescence imaging. The inducibility of A3B expression during the cell cycle was additionally addressed after cell cycle synchronization with multiple methods. First, we found that A3B protein levels within cell lines and tumors are heterogeneous and associate strongly with the proliferation marker Cyclin B1 characteristic of the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Second, in multiple breast cancer cell lines with high A3B, expression levels were observed to oscillate throughout the cell cycle and again associate with Cyclin B1. Third, induction of A3B expression is potently repressed throughout G0/early G1, likely by RB/E2F pathway effector proteins. Fourth, in cells with low A3B, induction of A3B through the PKC/ncNF-κB pathway occurs predominantly in actively proliferating cells and is largely absent in cells arrested in G0. Altogether, these results support a model in which dysregulated A3B overexpression in breast cancer is the cumulative result of proliferation-associated relief from repression with concomitant pathway activation during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.

This study aims to consider the evidence of total and phosphorylated tau as blood-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD when compared to healthy controls. Methods: Studies published between 1 January 2012 and 1 May 2021 (Embase and MEDLINE databases) measuring plasma/serum levels of tau in AD, MCI, and control cohorts were screened for eligibility, including quality and bias assessment via a modified QUADAS. The meta-analyses comprised 48 studies assessing total tau (t-tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217), comparing the ratio of biomarker concentrations in MCI, AD, and cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls. Results: Plasma/serum p-tau181 (mean effect size, 95% CI, 2.02 (1.76–2.27)) and t-tau (mean effect size, 95% CI, 1.77 (1.49–2.04)) were elevated in AD study participants compared to controls. Plasma/serum p-tau181 (mean effect size, 95% CI, 1.34 (1.20–1.49)) and t-tau (mean effect size, 95% CI, 1.47 (1.26–1.67)) were also elevated with moderate effect size in MCI study participants compared to controls. p-tau217 was also assessed, albeit in a small number of eligible studies, for AD vs. CU (mean effect size, 95% CI, 1.89 (1.86–1.92)) and for MCI vs. CU groups (mean effect size, 95% CI, 4.16 (3.61–4.71)). Conclusions: This paper highlights the growing evidence that blood-based tau biomarkers have early diagnostic utility for Alzheimer’s disease. Registration: PROSPERO No. CRD42020209482.

Previous studies have shown a direct interplay of the stem cell niche, which is present in practically every tissue with the extracellular matrix. In the present study, we sought to determine the expression of stemness markers in cytological specimens collected from the ectocervix among women with cervical insufficiency during the second trimester of pregnancy and women with normal cervical length. A prospective cohort of 59 women was enrolled of whom 41 were diagnosed with cervical insufficiency. The expression of OCT-4 and NANOG was higher in the cervical insufficiency group compared to the control group (−5.03 (−6.27, −3.72) vs. −5.81 (−7.67, −5.02) p = 0.040 for OCT4) and (−7.47 (−8.78, −6.27) vs. −8.5 (−10.75, −7.14), p = 0.035 for NANOG. Differences in the DAZL gene were not significantly different (5.94 (4.82, 7.14) vs. 6.98 (5.87, 7.43) p = 0.097). Pearson correlation analysis indicated the existence of a moderate correlation of OCT-4 and Nanog with cervical length. Considering this information, the enhanced activity of stemness biomarkers among pregnant women diagnosed with cervical insufficiency may be predisposed to cervical insufficiency, and its predictive accuracy remains to be noted in larger population sizes.
