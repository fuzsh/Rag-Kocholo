        "text": "There are eleven players on each team -- ten field players and one goalkeeper. Formations on the field will vary depending upon the strategy of the coach, but they will include attackers, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers.\n\nThe attackers are the principal goal scorers. They may include wings, inside forwards, and a striker.\n\nThe midfielders are the most versatile players on the field. They contribute both to the offense and defense.\n\nThe defenders are primarily responsible for the defense. The deepest defending back may be used as a sweeper.\n\nThe goalkeeper is the last line of defense and must protect the goal cage area. The goalkeeper is the only player allowed to touch the ball with their body, but they can only do this within the shooting circle."
