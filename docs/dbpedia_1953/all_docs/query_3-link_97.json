        "text": "Through the standard of rules enforcement, our game will continue to allow the opportunity for improved skill development and a more positive hockey environment for all participants. This initiative will result in greater emphasis on skating, puck possession and the proper use of the body to establish position and legally gain a competitive advantage.\n\nThe goal of the enforcement standard is to create an environment that enhances player skill development by reducing intimidating infractions designed to punish the opponent. This standard is designed to improve the proper skill of legal body checking or competitive contact at all levels of play and will not remove the physical component from the game. A player using\n\na body check or competitive contact/body position (competitive contact categories) to gain a competitive advantage over the opponent should not be penalized as long as it is performed within the rules. The focus of the body check must be to gain possession of the puck.\n\nThe principles of this enforcement standard include the following:\n\n• The purpose of a body check is to gain possession of the puck.\n\n• Proper body checking technique starts with stick on puck, therefore the stick blade of the player delivering the check must be below the knees.\n\n• Only the trunk (hips to shoulders) of the body shall be used to deliver a body check.\n\n• The check must be delivered to the trunk (hips to shoulders) and directly from in front or the side of the opponent.\n\n• Players who use their physical skills and/or anticipation and have a positional advantage shall not lose that advantage provided they physically engage with the opponent within the rules.\n\n• Players will be held accountable for acts of an intimidating or dangerous nature.\n\n• The onus is on the player delivering the check to avoid placing a vulnerable or defenseless opponent in danger of potential injury."
