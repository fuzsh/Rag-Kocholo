        "text": "In all cases, the left hand will always be at the top of the stick, and the right hand on the rest of the handle. The left hand is the one that firmly grips the stick and rotates it (forehand / backhand); the right hand is used to orientate the stick precisely.\n\nThe Basic Grip is used in all the basic techniques (hence its name): running with the ball, passing, receiving, intercepting, dribbling, …\n\nHands must be placed in such a way that they can react to all situations. Thus, for the left hand, the V between the thumb and forefinger should be on the backstick. This allows for a good orientation of the stick when dribbling. The right-hand holds the lower part of the stick for precision and strength; the index finger can be placed along the stick. When the stick is to be rotated (via the left hand), the right hand will loosen and then tighten.\n\nThis grip is used for long passing techniques such as Slap Shot and Sweep Hit. It allows you to put speed into the stick by using the strength of your wrists.\n\nThe left and right hands are at the top of the stick, with the V between the thumb and forefinger of both hands resting on the edge of the stick (hence the name), and holding the stick firmly in place.\n\nBoth hands must coordinate to accompany each other in the movement.\n\nThe one-handed grip is used to stand up when you want to run quickly with a ball to the stick, to defend, …\n\nIt is always done with the left hand at the top of the stick; the right hand is free.\n\nIn forehand or backhand, the V of the left hand is placed on the edge of the stick (forehand if you run in forehand; backhand edge if the opposite is true).\n\nThis grip is used to maintain maximum control and strength, or when intercepting from the reverse side, when the stick is placed face up (backstick to the ground).\n\nThe left hand V grip is placed along the flat side of the stick; the right hand holds the stick firmly at the bottom of the handle.\n\nThis grip is used to shoot on the reverse side of the stick.\n\nThe stick is oriented flat side up.\n\nBoth hands are at the top of the stick, the V grips of the left and right hands are placed along the flat side of the stick. Both hands work together in the movement.\n\nWhile each situation requires a particular grip, the difficulty lies in the rapid change of grips during the game.\n\nBeing able to change grips quickly and with the right technical skills will help you to keep your game fluid and keep optimal control of the ball.\n\nThe general rule is to momentarily squeeze the right hand to allow the left hand to position itself correctly, then return the right hand to the correct position. The difficulty lies in the speed of execution and accuracy in the new position found, otherwise the grip will not allow optimal ball control."
