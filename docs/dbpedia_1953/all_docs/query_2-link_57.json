        "text": "Kotkamills, a manufacturer of fully recyclable food service board, and FC KTP have signed a broad collaboration agreement for the 2021 football season. The main collaboration covers the men’s and women’s teams as well as the club’s juniors.\n\n“The key themes of the collaboration are responsibility and local welfare. We want to be a strong supporter of local events and successful sporting communities, including the physical activity of children and young people,” says Markku Hämäläinen, CEO of Kotkamills.\n\n“The collaboration agreement with Kotkamills enables a significant increase in coaching training, for example for children of primary school and junior high school age. The club can now also make equipment purchases for those most in need,” says FC KTP’s Coaching Director Janne Hyppönen joyfully.\n\n“The sponsorship also makes it easier for the women’s team to prepare for the season with the arrangement of physical training and rehabilitation,” says FC KTP’s Account Manager Jari-Pekka Gummerus.\n\nAt its matches and other events, FC KTP will use cups and food trays made from Kotkamills’ board. Kotkamills and FC KTP will work in close cooperation in the recycling of the used food and beverage containers.\n\n“The goal is to convey information about eco-friendliness and responsibility, and to raise awareness about Kotkamills’ products and solutions throughout the club community and among various stakeholders. With spectators ranging in age from babies to senior citizens, the user experience with new materials and the eco-friendly and responsible recycling practices become familiar to the general public,” says Saila Kettunen, Vice President, Sustainability and Communications at Kotkamills.\n\nFurther information:\n\nJari-Pekka Gummerus, Account Manager, FC KTP\n\ntel. +358 400 751 398\n\n[email protected]\n\nMarkku Hämäläinen, CEO, Kotkamills Oy\n\ntel. +358 40 721 0548\n\n[email protected]\n\nTietoa julkaisijasta\n\nAbout FC KTP\n\nKTP is a traditional sports club from Kotka and was founded in 1927.
