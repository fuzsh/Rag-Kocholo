        "text": "Steve Yzerman noticed him right away.\n\nIt was during a game at the 2002 Winter Olympics, where Henrik Zetterberg represented his native Sweden and Yzerman represented his native Canada.\n\n“He made a really nice backhand pass,” Yzerman said in an interview with the Free Press. “He was totally comfortable out there, and he’d have been what, around 21, 22 years old? Then he came to Detroit, and the more time he spent around the team, the more you could tell he was very mature, very comfortable. He was very poised. He wasn’t a rookie in any form. He conducted himself well. He was so good in all areas of his game. He was very defensively aware.\n\n“So right from the start, he was quite impressive.”\n\nZetterberg would go on to have an impressive career, including a Stanley Cup championship, an Olympic gold medal and a World Championship gold medal, a Conn Smythe Trophy and captaining an Original Six team. He stepped away from playing at the age of 37, wisely choosing quality of long-term life with his wife, Emma, and son, Love, over continuing to play through the pain of a degenerative back injury.\n\nMore:\n\nWindsor: Zetterberg was Red Wings' invisible superstar\n\nWhat's next for Wings with Zetterberg retiring\n\nIt’s a credit to Zetterberg’s tremendous drive that he has forged the career he had. He was an afterthought when he was NHL draft-eligible, a guy who chief European scout Hakan Andersson jokes the Wings took, “when all the real good players had gone.”\n\n‘I didn’t mind that Zetterberg kid’\n\nZetterberg leaves an NHL career that spans 1,082 games and is 40 points shy of 1,000 points. He scored 337 goals, recorded 623 assists and only 401 penalty minutes. In 137 playoff games, he had 57 goals and 63 assists.\n\nAll this from the 210th pick in the 1999 draft.\n\n“He was a late birthday, so he wasn’t drafted with the other 1980-born players,” Andersson said. “But I started snooping around a little bit. I started to feel that there was something about him.\n\n“We were a little bit lucky because a few years earlier, we’d drafted Anders Eriksson, a big defenseman, and his brother was on the same team as Zetterberg. So I started talking to him and he said that Henrik is a smart little player. He’s weak still, but he’s hard to catch with the puck. He makes good plays. So that got you interested a little bit more.”\n\nMore:\n\nHow Zetterberg's contract impacts Wings salary cap\n\nWho will step up as Wings cope without Zetterberg\n\nAndersson recalled being at a tournament in Finland along with Jim Nill, who was in charge of the Wings’ amateur scouting and draft selections.\n\n“We were looking at this Mattias Weinhandl kid,” Andersson said. “He was a bigger name in Sweden than Zetterberg was. Jim Nill and I interviewed him after a tournament in Finland and we said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we like him.’ But then I also told Jim Nill, ‘This Zetterberg kid has been catching my eye. Take a look and see what you think.’\n\n“After the tournament, Jim told me, ‘I didn’t mind that Zetterberg kid. Keep him on the list.’ ”\n\nThe 1999 draft was unchallenging for the Wings: They didn’t make their first selection until the fourth round, having used earlier picks in trades. The big story at the draft happened at second and third overall, when the Canucks selected brothers Daniel and Henrik Sedin.\n\nWhen the Wings finally were on the board, they chose, respectively at 120th, 149th and 181st: Jari Tolsa, Andrei Maximenko and Kent McDonell. Of the three, only McDonell made it to the NHL, for a whopping 32 career games.\n\nWhen 210 rolled around, the Wings went with Zetterberg. It didn’t take long for that to look like a smart selection.\n\nZetterberg scored 20 goals among 34 points for Timra in Sweden’s second-highest league in 1999-2000 and played at the 2000 World Junior Championships, which were held in Sweden.\n\nMore: Red Wings on Zetterberg: Great player, greater person\n\n“I’m there watching an exhibition game and after the game the coach came out,” Andersson said. “And everybody was raving about the Sedins and the coach said, ‘Well, they did OK, but I’m going to tell you guys Henrik Zetterberg has been unbelievable for us.’ ”\n\nIn 2001, Zetterberg played for Sweden at the World Championships, and in 2002, on the Olympic team, where he was one of three non-NHLers on the Swedish team.\n\nIt wasn’t just Yzerman who noticed Zetterberg on the international stage. At the 2002 World Championships, Zetterberg played against Team Canada’s Tyler Wright, who now serves as the Wings’ director of amateur skating.\n\n“Tyler told me when the game started, they couldn’t get the puck off Zetterberg,” Andersson said. “He said he was amazing.”\n\nAt the Salt Lake Games, Sweden faced a Canadian team that included soon-to-be Wings teammate Brendan Shanahan.\n\n“I remember Zetterberg told me when he walked off the game against Canada after warmups, somebody slapped him on his ass with a stick and he turned around and there was Brendan Shanahan,” Andersson said. “Shanahan winked his eye and said, ‘Good luck, kid.’ That was a big moment for him.”\n\nUltra-competitive, really intelligent\n\nZetterberg made his Wings debut on Oct. 10, 2002, the first of 79 games he’d play that season. He delivered 22 goals and 44 points, leading all rookies in goals and points. He was runner-up for the Calder Trophy, losing to St. Louis defenseman Barret Jackman. A broken leg limited Zetterberg to 61 games in 2003-04, but he still produced 43 points. After spending the 2004-05 lockout season in Sweden, Zetterberg reached 39 goals and 85 points in his third NHL season. That 2005-06 season was Mike Babcock’s first year behind Detroit’s bench.\n\n“My first impressions of him were of an ultra-competitive, really intelligent player,” Babcock said. “Good person. Loved winning and had a skill set to back that up. Knew how to play right. Real good defensively. Real competitive in the big moments.”\n\nNicklas Lidstrom, who’d been teammates with Zetterberg at the 2002 Olympics, recalled the 22-year-old rookie making his NHL debut.\n\n“I was very impressed with how he played — he handled himself really well,” Lidstrom said. “He played with such poise.”\n\nZetterberg’s arrival in Detroit sparked a friendship with Pavel Datsyuk, who was a year ahead of Zetterberg.\n\n“They were amazing,” former teammate Daniel Cleary said. “They did stuff in practice that video games can’t do justice. They were always thinking outside the box. It was easy to see how much they enjoyed playing with each other, from the one-on-one battle drills in practice that could go on for 30 minutes that you try to join, and after five minutes, you’re exhausted. It was a privilege to be around them.”\n\nIt was Kris Draper who gave the duo a memorable moniker.\n\n“They had such uncanny chemistry and one day I just threw it out there, called them the Euro Twins,” Draper said. “Pav and Z laughed about it and from there it took on a life of its own. It ended up sticking.\n\n“You could tell they were having a blast playing together and that’s why they were as good as they were. They basically took over the team.”\n\nThe ‘it’ factor\n\nIn 2007-08, Zetterberg hit career highs with 43 goals and 92 points, both sixth in the league. He averaged 22 minutes a game, playing on the power play and penalty kill. In the playoffs, he led the team with 27 points in 22 playoff games, helping the Wings win the Stanley Cup.\n\n“He scored a lot of key goals — I remember in Dallas in Game 6 on the road, and he scored the last game of the Pittsburgh series, too,” Lidstrom said. “Hank was our best player in that playoffs. And he was facing Sidney Crosby. He played big minutes, PP, PK, blocking shots. He was so smart offensively and defensively.”\n\nNot only did Zetterberg score the goal that clinched the 2008 Stanley Cup final with a 3-2 victory in Game 6 against the Penguins, he did something that left a lasting impact on Draper. When Draper joined Dallas Drake in the penalty box in the first period, it set up a 5-on-3 power play for the Penguins.\n\n“Dallas Drake and I, for sure we didn’t say a word, and I’m not quite sure if either of us were even breathing the whole time of that kill,” Draper said. “I remember Henrik Zetterberg anticipating a backdoor play and he ended up going stick-on-stick with Sidney Crosby and basically saved the goalie. If Z is not there, if he doesn’t have the strength to make the play, who knows, it could have been a whole different ballgame.\n\n“That kill is something I’ll never forget. It was on TV last week and my son kind of chirped me, ‘That was a bad penalty.’ I go, ‘It’s OK, I know how this plays out. Henrik has a great kill here, you watch.’ ”\n\nZetterberg ended up with the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs.\n\n“He was amazing,” Draper said. “He was something special. When you start talking about world-class players, they have this ‘it’ factor and he had it. He competed and made people around him better. To me, his biggest skill set was his will and determination. It’s amazing: Everyone knocked his skating his entire career, but you could never get the puck off him.”\n\nLegacy\n\nZetterberg leaves professional hockey a member of the Triple Gold Club – having won Olympic gold, the world championship and the Stanley Cup – and with a reputation of being one of the game’s top two-way centers during his prime. His personality is a big part of what made him so successful.\n\n“I love Z, he’s one of my favorite players,” Cleary said. “The most impact he had on me was his ability to be extremely happy and honest when his teammates did well, even if he didn’t. That was a great quality.”\n\nBabcock called Zetterberg “a classy, classy man. Was good to be around, was fun to be around, enjoyed life.”\n\nZetterberg went through a tough time in the spring of 2014. After traveling to Sochi for the Olympic Games, his back became so bothersome that he woke up one day and could not move. He underwent surgery in late February after being diagnosed with a herniated disk in his lower back after playing one game for Team Sweden at the Olympics. Remarkably, he still returned to play the last two games of the first-round series against Boston that spring, producing a goal and an assist in the second game as the Wings faced elimination.\n\n“Z knew how to play and he played his best in big moments,” Babcock said. “I got a ton of respect for him.\n\n“Like I don’t know what year Z hurt his back, but for him to be able to go through what he did to keep playing and playing at a high level, that was unreal. Anybody out there who has had a back injury knows how hard it is just to get out of bed in the morning, never mind playing a sport at a high level and be one of the best in the world.”\n\nZetterberg played 77 games in 2014-15, and followed up with three consecutive 82-game seasons. He celebrated his 1,000th game the same day the Wings played their final game at Joe Louis Arena.\n\n“He’s a guy who made a major impact on the Red Wings for a number of years,” Babcock said. “We had a lot of good teams for a lot of years and he was a huge part of that.”\n\nContact Helene St. James: hstjames@freepress.com.
