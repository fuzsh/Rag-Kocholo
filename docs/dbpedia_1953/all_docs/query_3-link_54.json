        "text": "The younger the player, the shorter the pass.\n\nCradle the puck with your stick when you receive it.\n\nDonât pass to the player; pass to where theyâre going. And try to put the puck on the blade of the recipientâs stick.\n\nDonât pass over two lines; thatâs against the rules, and the official will blow the whistle. Then theyâll call a face-off, most likely in your defensive zone.\n\nWhenever possible, keep your passes on the ice. But if you must elevate the puck to get it to your teammate, try to make it land flat on the ice so itâs easier to receive.\n\nButt ending: When a player jabs an opponent with the top end of their stick.\n\nChecking from behind: Whistled when a player hits an opponent who is not aware of the impending contact from behind and therefore cannot defend themselves.\n\nCross checking: When a player makes a check with both hands on the stick.\n\nElbowing: When a player uses their elbow to foul an opponent.\n\nFighting: Called fisticuffs in the National Hockey League rule book, it is assessed when players drop their gloves and throw punches at each other.\n\nHooking: When a player impedes the progress of an opponent by âhookingâ them with their stick.\n\nInterference: When a player interferes with or impedes the progress of an opponent who does not have the puck. Also assessed to a player who deliberately knocks the stick out of an opponentâs hand or who prevents a player who has dropped their stick (or any other piece of equipment) from picking it back up.\n\nKneeing: When a player fouls an opponent with their knee (of course!).\n\nRoughing: Called when a player strikes another opponent in a minor altercation that the referee determines is not worthy of a major penalty.\n\nSlashing: When a player hits an opponent with their stick, or âslashesâ them, either to impede their progress or cause injury.\n\nSpearing: When a player stabs at an opponent with the blade of their stick, whether they make contact or not.\n\nTripping: When a stick or any portion of a playerâs body is used to cause an opposing player to fall.\n\nGoalie: Perhaps the toughest position in all of sports, the goalie is the one player who can control a teamâs confidence. Their job is to keep the puck out of the net, and if theyâre good, they can take their team a long way. Good goalies win championships.\n\nDefensemen: A team at full strength has two â one on the left side and another on the right. Nowadays, there are three primary kinds of defensemen. One is creative and offensive-minded; they like to handle the puck and lead the team up ice, but are not too physical. Another is defensive-minded, a stay-at-home bruiser who plays a physical game and doesnât often venture out of their zone with the puck. And there are those rare athletes who are a combination of the two.\n\nRight wing: They work the right side of the ice for the most part. They need to be a physical player who is good along the boards and in the corner. They are responsible for the oppositionâs left defenseman in the defensive zone.\n\nLeft wing: Traditionally a left-handed shot, but the NHL is seeing more right-handers playing this position now, a practice picked up from the Europeans. A right-hander has a better angle to shoot from when theyâre coming in on their wing. Like the right wing, they need to be able to dig out the puck from the corners and battle in front of the net.\n\nCenter: They quarterback their club at both ends of the ice. Must be good at face-offs and passing, and it doesnât hurt if theyâre a good shot as well. Coaches want a lot of creativity in this position â and a lot of hockey smarts.\n\nLearn to skate properly, even if youâre playing goalie. You canât do anything in hockey if you canât skate.\n\nMake sure your equipment â whether itâs your skates, your stick, or your sweater (thatâs what the pros call a hockey jersey) â fits well.\n\nOn the bench, be alert. Watch what the opposing team is doing, and be prepared to play both ways, offensively and defensively.\n\nDonât be a puck hog; pass to your teammates.\n\nDonât stay out on your shift for too long. If youâre working hard, an average shift on the ice should last no longer than a minute. Come off when itâs your turn.\n\nBe ready when itâs your turn to go onto the ice.\n\nWear a helmet. But remember: Just because you have head protection, donât think youâre invincible.\n\nBe careful with your stick. Just because everybody wears headgear, donât think theyâre invincible either.\n\nDonât check people from behind.\n\nKeep your head up when youâre going into the boards. If your head is tucked in, the chances of a serious head injury rise if someone hits you from behind.\n\nDonât growl, curse, or otherwise pick at the ref or the other team. Itâs okay to be emotional and pull for the people on your team, but donât give the ref or the opposing players a hard time.\n\nGet yourself in good physical shape.\n\nPractice your shooting and passing."
