        "text": "We suggest buying a field hockey stick based on playing style, NOT position. Back in the day, certain sticks were better suited for certain positions. With all the modern technology in sticks today, this is no longer the case. It is best to find a stick that best matches your playing style. A stick that compliments your strengths and helps forgive your weaknesses.\n\nCARBON CONTENT Increased carbon translates into greater stiffness in the stick. High carbon content contributes to high power in hits, but can also make receiving more challenging. Players need to find the right balance of power and feel to suit their game.\n\nCARBON QUOTIENT Expresses an indicative stiffness measure of Gryphon sticks as a relative measure to the widely used carbon content percentages.\n\nWEIGHT For each composite stick we offer, we include a targeted weight for a 36-36.5\" stick. You can assume each additional inch will add approximately 10 grams.\n\nSCOOP This technology refers to a 2mm groove in the toe of the stick which varies in length but runs up the shaft of the stick. This feature aids in cradling the ball for heightened control in ball handling, lifts (both forehand and backhand), drag flicking assistance and aerial skills.\n\nVIBRATION As a stick's carbon content increases, there is a tendency for greater vibration, or sting, in the handle. Vibration does not necessarily equate to the stick being broken. Manufacturers have added features within the stick handle to specifically address and ultimately absorb the vibration. Additionally, sticks need to warm up just like their owners. Give your stick a chance to warm up for optimal performance.\n\nBOW All composite field hockey sticks have a bow from the handle to the toe. Most sticks have a bow measuring at least 19mm, while the elite level sticks will have a bow closer to 25mm. We offer four bow profiles represented throughout our stick line.\n\nTHE EXTREME LOW BOW The Extreme Low Bow shape maximizes dynamic ball control, aerial pass skills and drag flick consistency. This shape can be used all over the field.\n\nTHE LOW BOW This low bow is typically about 25mm and the highest point is close to the toe of the stick. This shape offers extra assistance with lifting the ball, aerials and drag flicking, as well as dynamic ball movement.\n\nTHE MEDIUM BOW This gradual bow is versatile in all aspects of the game. It offers a natural hybrid in the modern game of field hockey, combining the consistent performance of a classic bow with the new advances of the lower bows."
