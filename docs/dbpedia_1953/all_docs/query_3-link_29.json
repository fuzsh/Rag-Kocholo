        "text": "Sled hockey (also referred to as sledge hockey and para ice hockey) was invented at a Stockholm, Sweden rehabilitation center in the early 1960's by a group of Swedes who, despite their physical disability, wanted to continue playing hockey. It was introduced at the Lillehammer 1994 Winter Games and the US won its first Paralympic medal in the sport - gold medal - at the Salt Lake 2002 Winter Games.\n\nSled hockey follows most of the typical ice hockey rules with the exception some of the equipment. Players sit in specially designed sleds that sit on top of two hockey skate blades. There are two sticks for each player, instead of one, and the sticks have metal picks on the butt end for players to propel themselves. Goalies wear basically the same equipment but do make modifications to the glove. Metal picks are sewn into the backside to allow the goalie to maneuver. Sled accessible rinks allow players to remain in their sleds and skate off the ice into the bench area. This requires that the bench area is flush with the ice and there is clear plexiglass replacing the white boards.\n\nSled hockey provides opportunities for many types of disabilities at the local level for recreation/competition, all the way to the National Sled Team that plays in World Championships and the Paralympics."
