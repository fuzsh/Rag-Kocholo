        "text": "High-Quality, Professional-Grade Ice Hockey Sticks\n\nThe bond shared between a player and their favorite stick is sometimes difficult for other people to understand. We know the feeling you get when you find that perfect stick – the one with the perfect grip, weight, length, curve and flex for your specific position and play style. We also know the feeling you get when your one-timer sputters into the corner and you’re left holding half a stick in each hand. We’ve been there before, and we’re here to help ease your pain. Our online store features authentic pro stock sticks from all the top brands in hockey. These sticks have been custom manufactured for hundreds of current and former NHL players and are now available to the public at some of the lowest prices you’ll find anywhere. Here you’ll find tons of options, from player sticks to pro stock goalie sticks. We even have an extensive lineup of youth hockey sticks available, allowing us to cater to all levels of play. If you’re looking to add your name and number, we can even personalize your stick. Start shopping now!\n\nCHOOSING THE RIGHT MATERIAL\n\nHockey sticks have seen tremendous advances in technology over the last 15 years. The overwhelming majority of players in the sport today are using composite hockey sticks made from a mixture of graphite and carbon fibers. The use of these materials has been proven to increase puck control, quicken a player’s release, and improve the overall speed of their shot. These sticks are much lighter than the traditional wooden sticks formally used by NHL legends like Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe – imagine the things they would have done with this technology!\n\nIf you’re playing organized hockey at any level – regardless of if it’s just a beer or rec league – you’re going to want to use a composite stick.\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND FLEX\n\nOne-piece stick (OPS) or two-piece? If you go one piece, the stick is lighter and has a consistent kick point because there is no break between blade and shaft. Meanwhile, two-piece sticks allow you to choose a combination of shaft and blade that works best for you, giving you more control over the final product. This method can also help save you a couple bucks if you find yourself consistently breaking only the blade/shaft.\n\nYou also need to consider flex, which ranges from 25 to 120. Sticks listed with a higher flex will have a stiffer shaft, while the lower flex sticks will have more whip to them. What works best for you will depend on your age, position and how you like to play the game. Bigger players will often want stiffer shafts to handle their weight, while lighter players often prefer more flex. Younger players are usually better served by sticks with a greater flex until they're able to determine what flex style feels best to them when shooting. Defensemen are more prone to choose a stiffer shaft, while forwards tend to go with a more flexible shaft for a quick release.\n\nPATTERN AND CURVE\n\nDifferent manufacturers offer different blade patterns based on a specific type of curve, often imitating the habits of an NHL player. A common misconception among hockey players is that retail blade patterns, named after certain NHL stars, are actually used by those players. While some may use a blade pattern similar to their retail option, most NHL players use a customized stick that has been tailored to their specifications. You need to decide what type of curve (heel, mid, toe), depth of curve (deep, moderate, slight) and face angle (neutral, slightly open, open) you prefer, along with the “lie” of your stick when it sits flat on the ice. Big curves make it easier to roof it, while slight curves give more control and allow for a more effective backhand.\n\nADVANTAGES OF PRO STOCK STICKS\n\nAt the end of the day, there’s a lot that goes into selecting the perfect hockey stick, and knowing all of your options is half the battle. Most players are familiar with buying retail, but here are a few key advantages of choosing to go with pro stock hockey sticks:\n\nCustom made and fine-tuned for performance at the highest level of competition\n\nHighest grade materials\n\nWide variety of custom heights, flexes and curves\n\nOften branded with specific player and team logos or symbols\n\nRigorous quality checks on all incoming sticks ensures the accuracy of stick specifications and highest level of performance\n\nPro stock prices are normally well below the cost of retail\n\nProStockHockey.com works directly with NHL teams to give you the world’s best selection of authentic pro stock hockey sticks.
