        "text": "It is important to have the correct size stick to execute both basic and advanced skills. The length can be the deciding factor in completing a pass, making a tackle…or making a mistake.\n\nA defensive player or midfielder may prefer a longer stick in order to drive the ball further, and an offensive player might select a shorter stick for better handling and control.\n\nSticks can range from 28” – 37.5” or more. Typically, the stick should come up to the top of your hip bone.\n\nBelow are some basic height/size guidelines:\n\nDue to the nature of the game, the paint on the stick may chip after a hard hack, hit, or repetitive heel dragging. Paint chips are considered normal wear and tear and are not qualified for a warranty replacement. We handle each warranty claim on a case-by-case basis, so if you think your stick is damaged beyond normal wear and tear and is defective, please send us pictures and we will take a look!\n\nHelpful tips for fixing a “rain stick” It is not uncommon for a piece of fiberglass to come loose inside the handle/shaft of the stick and cause a rattling sound or vibration when hitting. This does not mean your stick is broken, it just means there is an annoying piece of fiberglass in there that needs to come out. Here are step-by-step instructions on how to remove the piece.\n\nRemove Grip (you will need a new grip to put on afterwards\n\nTake off end cap (if you destroy the end cap while removing it, let us know and we will send you a new one)\n\nShake that annoying sucker out! You may need to tap the ends of the stick to loosen it entirely. You may also fish it out with a wire coat hanger.\n\nMake sure there are no more rattling sounds\n\nPut end cap back on stick\n\nUse electrical tape to secure the end cap to the handle.\n\nRe-grip the stick and secure both ends with electrical tape\n\nPlay!\n\nHow often should I replace my stick and what is an average jump in carbon percentage? You should replace your stick when you feel that your skill level has surpassed the level of the stick. Over time the fibers will compress and lose the “pop” that we feel with a brand new stick. An average jump in carbon is 15% to 25%."
