The way you write your codes will determine how easy it will be to manage, maintain and extend. The Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, allows you to build your codes in a highly modularized manner, that promotes easier code maintenance and management without sacrificing the capability to extend them in self-sufficient units. Through the principle of abstraction, you’ll learn how to build your own client-server application to access a database in real-time. Encapsulation then allows you to take your abstraction skills to a new height, by letting you build your own components to build 2 and 3-layer applications with highly reusable components. Then, we’ll push your coding skills further through the principles of Inheritance and Polymorphism, to build a MVC web application that helps you envision how software companies utilize OOP best practices to extend, adapt and restrict their products and solutions. The course ends with an introduction to modeling classes using the UML Class Diagram to give you a bird’s eye view of the hierarchy of objects that you’ve built.\n\nIntermediate Programming\n\nAlmost everything nowadays runs on codes!
