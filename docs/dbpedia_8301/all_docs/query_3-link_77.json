Click on the release version in JIRA and click on the Release Notes. Make sure to configure the release notes in text format.\n\nNOTE: The JIRA Release Notes will list only tickets with Fix Version set to that version. You should check for any Resolved tickets that have Target Version set but not Fix Version. Also check for any Unresolved or Duplicate/Invalid tickets that incorrectly set the Fix Version.\n\nNOTE: This script assumes that you have the requisite permissions to deploy the JAR. For instructions on how to set it up, please refer to src/java/MESOS-MAVEN-README.\n\nNOTE: gnu-sed (Linux) requires -i'' instead of the -i '' (space-separated) that default OSX uses. You may need to modify your local copy of tag.sh for it to complete successfully.\n\nNOTE: The date -v+3d command does not work on some platforms (e.g. Ubuntu), so you may need to fill in the vote end date manually. The vote should last for 3 business days instead of 3 calendar days anyway. Sometimes we prefer a weeklong vote, to allow more time for integration testing."
