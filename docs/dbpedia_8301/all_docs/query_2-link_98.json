It automatically handles hardware or software failures and ensures that an app is \"always on\".\n\nSingularity is a scheduler (HTTP API and web interface) for running Mesos tasks: long running processes, one-off tasks, and scheduled jobs.\n\nSSSP is a simple web application that provides a white-label \"Megaupload\" for storing and sharing files in S3.\n\nBig Data Processing\n\nCray Chapel is a productive parallel programming language. The Chapel Mesos scheduler lets you run Chapel programs on Mesos.\n\nDpark is a Python clone of Spark, a MapReduce-like framework written in Python, running on Mesos.\n\nExelixi is a distributed framework for running genetic algorithms at scale.\n\nHadoop Running Hadoop on Mesos distributes MapReduce jobs efficiently across an entire cluster.\n\nHama is a distributed computing framework based on Bulk Synchronous Parallel computing techniques for massive scientific computations e.g., matrix, graph and network algorithms.\n\nMPI is a message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computers.\n\nSpark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system which makes parallel jobs easy to write.\n\nStorm is a distributed realtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing.\n\nBatch Scheduling\n\nChronos is a distributed job scheduler that supports complex job topologies. It can be used as a more fault-tolerant replacement for Cron.\n\nJenkins is a continuous integration server. The mesos-jenkins plugin allows it to dynamically launch workers on a Mesos cluster depending on the workload.\n\nJobServer is a distributed job scheduler and processor which allows developers to build custom batch processing Tasklets using point and click web UI.\n\nData Storage\n\nCassandra is a performant and highly available distributed database. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.\n\nElasticSearch is a distributed search engine. Mesos makes it easy to run and scale.\n\nHypertable is a high performance, scalable, distributed storage and processing system for structured and unstructured data."
