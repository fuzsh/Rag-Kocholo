All details: https://jobs.lever.co/talend/3d23a6e2-6d19-4089-8636-00e1790...\n\nWhat we offer you: Join a passionate team and work with the latest technologies (Hadoop, K8s, Terraform, AWS, GCP to name a few). A challenging but rewarding environment with international scope. Top modern offices with ideal locations.\n\nSigOpt | Research Engineer | Onsite San Francisco, CA | Fulltime\n\nhttps://jobs.lever.co/sigopt/bdff1bd1-ed90-468b-a1b2-020c803...\n\nSigOpt provides an enterprise, hosted service for model development and black box optimization. We're looking for brilliant and enthusiastic researchers to learn, grow, and build with us!\n\nResearch at SigOpt\n\nSigOpt is a service that helps customers efficiently develop effective models in an efficient and data-secure fashion. As customers report the relationship between our recommended model designs and the associated performance, we implement algorithms internally to interpret this relationship and suggest new model designs that may reach higher performance. Our algorithms must be able to perform under various customer circumstances and computational restrictions, and they must yield robust performance for our customers to trust their model development to SigOpt.\n\nProject Ownership: Research engineers are entrusted to own much of the development process for many of our most important and differentiating features. These critical elements of our product require the passion and rigor which defines a research mentality, and research engineers are expected to design and execute (in conjunction with other engineers) the strategies for designing and executing these key projects.\n\nWorking at the Cutting Edge: The tools that we provide for our customers must be based on the latest research developments from throughout the mathematics, statistics and machine learning communities. We invest time in reading articles and participating in conferences to know the current state of the community so that we can bring the best tools to bear on our customer’s problems. Research engineers have the important job of developing and/or adapting these strategies to fit in the constraints of an enterprise SaaS black-box solution.\n\nTeamwork: Everyone on the research team has their own expertise and perspective on the research community: statistics, mathematics, operations research and machine learning all contribute to the core of our product. We want all researcher engineers to be both humble teachers and active learners to build the best and most comprehensive team possible. The research team also regularly hosts interns, and interested team members have the opportunity to mentor the next generation of researchers.\n\nCommunicating to the World: One of the key ways the research team contributes at SigOpt is by being effective communicators. This can be by documenting our work internally, developing feature/product documentation which speaks to advanced users, developing educational material to bolster SigOpt’s conference presence, writing blog content to present ideas/methodologies to the broad community, or writing articles for conferences/workshops to the research community. We also regularly collaborate with external partners on projects ranging from materials science to artwork.\n\nUser Engagement: An important part of SigOpt’s effectiveness lies in understanding our customer’s needs and values. Research engineers are encouraged to spend time with the customer success team during customer meetings to better empathize with customer goals and devise better strategies for serving their needs. This opportunity is unique to life at a small company, and, when successfully executed, this can be the most important element of product discovery/development.\n\nMXX / Triller UK | Backend, iOS, Android, QA, Data Science | London, United Kingdom | Full-Time | ONSITE or REMOTE\n\nTriller is the fastest rising social media and social music streaming platform in the App Store charts today.

The program is described at https://www.nist.gov/iaao/academic-affairs-office/nist-nrc-p.... The neutron scattering group at the NCNR is strongly collaborative and the successful candidate will have a great deal of independence and intellectual freedom as well as a generous stipend ($72,000). Online applications for the NRC are open December 1st and end February 1st. US Citizenship required. Interested applicants should contact william.ratcliff@nist.gov. There are two projects that are of primary interest:\n\n1) Applications of machine learning to neutron scattering with an emphasis on experimental optimization and reinforcement learning. You can think of this as modern experimental design. Where do we measure to obtain the most information? Other applications could include Bayesian model selection approaches to diffraction and inelastic data. For example, can we automatically detect the space group from powder diffraction data? Where do we measure to distinguish between two magnetic Hamiltonians? The ideal applicant would have a background in science and interest/experience with ML/AI. For example, suppose you are in condensed matter (experiment or theory) and are thinking of getting into ML. I’m also open to those with more of a CS/ML background who want to apply their skills to a problem in physics. http://nrc58.nas.edu/RAPLab10/Opportunity/Opportunity.aspx?L...\n\nMinimum Skills Programming skills: Experience with using Python, IDL, or Matlab to plot/analyze data Either: Experience with science at a PhD level or experience with ML/AI\n\nIdeal Skills Programming skills: Experience with tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn Science: Expertise in a neutron scattering technique used to study hard condensed matter systems. This could be time-of-flight, triple-axis-spectometry, or magnetic diffraction applied. Expertise with synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques would be just as welcome.\n\n2) Study of Quantum Materials, Topological Insulators, Skyrmions, Spin Liquids, or Multiferroics using neutron scattering as a probe. Recently, we have collaborated with a number of groups to study materials ranging from magnetic topological insulators to multiferroic skyrmions. In addition to performing neutron scattering opportunities, the successful applicant will have the opportunity to grow high quality thin films or single crystals via existing collaborations in the area.. http://nrc58.nas.edu/RAPLab10/Opportunity/Opportunity.aspx?L...\n\nhttp://nrc58.nas.edu/RAPLab10/Opportunity/Opportunity.aspx?L...\n\nMinimum Skills Programming skills: Experience with using Python, IDL, or Matlab to plot/analyze data Scientific experience: Experience with hard condensed matter physics. Even if you have not done neutron scattering before it’s fine as long as you have a good knowledge of hard condensed matter (for example, you might have done some synthesis/growth and susceptibility measurements).\n\nIdeal Skills Scientific experience: Expertise in a neutron scattering technique used to study hard condensed matter systems. This could be time-of-flight, triple-axis-spectometry, or magnetic diffraction applied. Expertise with synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques would be just as welcome.\n\nDesigner/Developer | NewsNow.co.uk | London, UK | Full-time, permanent Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent\n\nWe are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean.

Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians' and veterinary staff needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend. To do this, you’ll be working at every stage of patient care from the exam room to back-end analytics.
