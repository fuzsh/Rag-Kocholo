        "text": "Multitudinous open-source platforms are available for managing clusters of servers and building containerized applications. Two options always stand out from the rest – Kubernetes and Apache Mesos.\n\nBoth offer tremendous benefits and are ideal for container orchestration. In this blog, we will walk you through the difference between Kubernetes and Apache Mesos to help you select a viable one.\n\nWhat is Container Orchestration?\n\nLet us first quickly walk you through what container orchestration is. It automates an organization’s operational efforts to run containerized services and workload management.\n\nContainer Orchestration includes a broad range of components that software teams must consider for managing a container’s lifecycle, including networking, provisioning, load balancing, scaling, deployment, and more.\n\nWhat is Kubernetes Container Orchestration?\n\nKubernetes is an open-source platform and is highly preferred for container orchestration. It enables developers to build, deploy, and manage containerized applications and services known as pods across a cluster of servers.\n\nIt also helps in monitoring, scheduling, and scaling (up or down) containers. Developers and administrations can use them to describe how they want a specific system to function and execute it accordingly.\n\nWhat is Apache Mesos?\n\nApache Mesos is another open-source platform ideal for efficiently managing clusters of servers. It helps in the optimal utilization of resources in groups. The best part of Apache Mesos is its lightweight interface, enabling you to scale up to 10,000 nodes and more clusters.\n\nIts API supports prominent programming languages like Python, Java, and C++. Apache Mesos can run containerized and non-containerized applications.\n\nSalient Differences between Kubernetes and Apache Mesos\n\nLet us walk you through the primary difference between both platforms and how containers operate in each.\n\nNetworking\n\nNetworking in Apache Mesos is better than Kubernetes because of its quick setup. However, Kubernetes offers superior flexibility and supports Networking Management plugins compatible with Container Network Interface (CNI), unlike Mesos, which isn’t compatible with CNI. Kubernetes allows you to select networking plugins according to your needs and complexity.\n\nIn contrast, Apache Mesos doesn’t employ networking plugins by default like Kubernetes. It uses built-in networking components that can designate ports to workloads for interpretation and doesn’t enable firm control over network configuration.\n\nStorage\n\nApache Mesos is more straightforward to configure than Kubernetes. However, Kubernetes is better than Mesos in terms of storage. The reason is – that Apache Mesos production workloads are limited while employing local storage data for processing.\n\nThough Mesos workloads can access constant storage resources hosted on group nodes, its Container Storage Interface (CSI) is limited. In comparison, Kubernetes overcomes this challenge by supporting vast storage plugins that seamlessly incorporate workloads with external storage solutions.\n\nSupporting Workload\n\nKubernetes is particularly designed for containerized applications, whereas Apache Mesos can support any workload type – containerized and non-containerized. Users can run non-containerized applications on Kubernetes by deploying them to a virtual machine and using an add-on, such as KubeVirt, to run them inside Kubernetes clusters. This process is time-consuming due to additional tools and setup requirements. Here, Apache Mesos is a clear winner as it supports both containerized and non-containerized applications.\n\nSpecifying Workload\n\nDevelopers can define workloads in both Kubernetes and Apache Mesos using YMAL or JSON code. However, users get a resource for task teams called pods that differ from Kubernetes pods.\n\nThe programming languages used are different for both platforms. Hence, you must select the platform based on the programming languages you are proficient with. The difference between platforms is minimalistic; however, specifying workloads in Apache Mesos is more straightforward to write than Kubernetes.\n\nWorkloads Deployment\n\nOne of the most effective and widely preferred methods for workload deployment on Kubernetes is using the following kubectl command after specifying workloads. It is a command-line interface to Kubernetes installed by gcloud. You can even deploy by creating controller elements using Kubernetes API.\n\nGenerally, developers build a representation of intended Kubernetes controller elements as a YAML configuration file and employ it with either the kubectl command-line interface or Kubernetes API.\n\nIn comparison, users can deploy workloads in Apache Mesos with API calls using Linux commands, unlike external tools like kubectl in Kubernetes. It benefits users by mitigating the need to install additional tools on every virtual machine to control the Mesos cluster.\n\nSearching Expertise and Ecosystems\n\nBoth Apache Mesos and Kubernetes are preferred by large-scale organizations and enterprises for workload production and enjoy the benefits of their prosperous ecosystems.\n\nAs Kubernetes is extensively used, you can easily find the right developers with their expertise for add-ons and integrations. It means you can quickly find the team with the right skillsets for Kubernetes cluster management in-house compared to Apache Mesos.\n\nWhich one to pick – Kubernetes or Apache Mesos?\n\nKubernetes is an ideal pick, as you can easily find the right individuals with expertise in cluster management. Also, you will get access to its vast community for support and resolve queries.\n\nAlso, Kubernetes supports various storage plug-ins that seamlessly integrate with external storage solutions. Kubernetes supports Networking Management plug-ins compatible with Container Network Interface (CNI), enabling you to select according to your plug-in needs.\n\nIn comparison, Apache Mesos has an advantage when it comes to specifying and deploying workloads, as they are easier to write and don’t need additional deployment tools. Also, it supports both containerized and non-containerized applications.\n\nTo summarize, both Kubernetes and Apache Mesos have their respective advantages and the upper hand over each other. You can select the one that meets your container orchestration needs. We recommend considering all the factors mentioned in the blog before choosing. However, if you have any questions or require more clarification, feel free to contact us.\n\nAt Calidad Infotech, we provide Software Testing and DevOps Consulting Services. We utilize Kubernetes tools for performing tasks and fulfilling client requirements. We offer other options to ensure they meet your needs and give you the intended results."
