Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.\n\nTo send your Prometheus-format Apache Mesos metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the inputs.mesos and outputs.http plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.\n\nFor Windows\n\nAfter downloading the archive, extract its content into C:\\Program Files\\Logzio\\telegraf\\.\n\nThe configuration file is located at C:\\Program Files\\Logzio\\telegraf\\.\n\nFor MacOS\n\nThe configuration file is located at /usr/local/etc/telegraf.conf.\n\nFor Linux\n\nUbuntu & Debian\n\nThe configuration file is located at /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf.\n\nRedHat and CentOS\n\nThe configuration file is located at /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf.\n\nSLES & openSUSE\n\nThe configuration file is located at /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf.\n\nFreeBSD/PC-BSD\n\nThe configuration file is located at /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf.\n\nFirst you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the Apache Mesos data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:\n\nAfter you create the configuration file, configure the output plug-in to enable Telegraf to send your data to Logz.io in Prometheus-format. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:\n\nReplace the placeholders to match your specifics. (They are indicated by the double angle brackets << >>):\n\nReplace <<LISTENER-HOST>> with the Logz.io Listener URL for your region, configured to use port 8052 for http traffic, or port 8053 for https traffic.\n\nReplace <<PROMETHEUS-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> with a token for the Metrics account you want to ship to.
