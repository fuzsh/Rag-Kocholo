        "text": "Appendix B. List of Mesos frameworks and tools\n\nMesos was designed to run multiple frameworks on a single cluster of computers, thereby improving overall resource utilization. Various community efforts have arisen around running existing applications on Mesos.\n\nIn this appendix, I provide a list of the Mesos frameworks known and actively being maintained as of publishing time. I also include references to Mesos language bindings, which will allow you to write your own frameworks in languages other than C++, Java, Scala, and Python. Finally, I cover tools in the community that can be used for configuration management, monitoring, service discovery, and load balancing.\n\nB.1. Mesos frameworks\n\nAt publishing time, several open source Mesos frameworks are available. Some of these are purpose-built—such as Aurora, Chronos, and Marathon—whereas others are existing distributed services that work well with the Mesos model; these include (but aren’t limited to) Cassandra, Jenkins, and Spark. This section covers Mesos frameworks that you can immediately begin using with your cluster.\n\nB.1.1. Application management and batch scheduling\n\nOne of the mainstream uses of Mesos is to deploy long-running applications on a Mesos cluster, effectively using Mesos as a way to distribute and run containers. This section covers frameworks that can be used for deploying applications and batch jobs on a Mesos cluster, similar to the topics covered in chapters 7 through 9."
