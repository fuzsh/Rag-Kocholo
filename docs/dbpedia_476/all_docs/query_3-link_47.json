        "text": "2 Contributions of Greek Scholars in Geography\n\nDr. Taruna Bansal\n\nAnaximander is credited with the introduction of a Babylonian instrument known as Gnomon into the Greek literary world. Gnomon is a pole set vertically above a flat surface on which the varying position of the sun and other celestial bodies could be measured by the length and direction of the shadow cast by the vertical pole. He is even credited to produce a world map to scale. This map is based on the information gathered from the Sumerians who had an archive of pictorial maps. Interestingly, this map has an ocean encircling the world.\n\nWorld Map as given by Anaximander Anaximander’s Gnomon\n\nHecataeus prepared the world map but it was based on the map of Anaximander; he had just modified it. He divided it into two parts by drawing a line passing through Hellespont, the Caspian Sea and Caucasus mountains. The northern part he named as Europa and southern part of Libya that includes Africa and Asia.\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 3"
