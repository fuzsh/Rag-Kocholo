A king size mattress or queen size mattress in Europe can even mean something entirely different from country to country. Regardless of where you call home, it is so important to buy the correct mattress size for your space when it is time to upgrade.\n\nEuropean Standards and the Metric System\n\nThe United States and Europe have different size and measurement standards for a wide variety of household items. For example, electrical plugs and outlets, shoes, and clothes all have different sizes or ratings between the two regions. This is also true when looking at the differences in mattress sizing between Europe and the United States.\n\nWhen it comes to mattress sizes, much of the difference between European and American sizing is simply a matter of using the metric system versus the imperial system (objects in Europe are typically measured in centimeters rather than inches). However, nomenclature used in the mattress industry may vary, too. Thankfully, comparing European and American bed sizes is not too complicated and there are some simple ways to convert the sizes.\n\nAn Overview: European Mattress Sizes\n\nIn the United States, the most common mattress sizes are twin, full, queen, and king. Sizes in the U.K. and Ireland have similar names including single, double, king, and super king. In continental Europe, sizes are simply referred to by the measurement of their width and length in centimeters. For example, you might have a mattress size that is 90 centimeters by 200 centimeters.\n\nHow to Compare Sizes\n\nIf you need to convert between American and European mattress sizes, there are some simple steps you can follow in order to do so.\n\nFirst, you will need to determine the size of your bed and the measurement system in which it is measured (i.e., inches or centimeters).\n\nYou can then use a size conversion chart to convert a mattress size into the desired measurement system. A conversion chart will indicate the length and width of bed sizes in either inches or centimeters. There is an abundance of conversion charts freely available on the internet, so finding one should not pose much of a challenge. When considering several different mattresses, it is best to convert the sizes of all mattresses you are considering into a single measurement system.\n\nThe last step is to compare the resulting measurements. Generally speaking, there are some European mattress sizes that share similar dimensions as the American equivalent, although they are rough equivalents and should not considered an exact not be considered an exact match. To make things a little easier for you, we have done some of the work by comparing some of the most common U.S. mattress sizes to their European counterparts below. Keep reading to learn more!\n\nTwin Size Beds and European Mattress Sizes\n\nAn American twin size bed measures 38 by 75 inches, which is slightly larger than the single size mattress from the U.K. or Ireland. A single bed measures 36 by 75 inches. In continental Europe, the closest mattress size to a twin size is a 35 by 79-inch mattress. If you are in search of a twin size mattress, the closest European mattress equivalents are different enough in width that they will not be compatible with your bed.\n\nFull Size Beds and European Mattress Sizes\n\nA U.S. full size bed frame requires a mattress that measures 54 by 75 inches. This is similar to the double bed in the U.K. and Ireland that also requires a 54 by 75 inches mattress. That means that a full-size mattress from the U.S. and a double bed in the U.K. or Ireland are compatible replacements. Unfortunately, continental European mattress sizes measure a hair wider. The closest comparable size in continental Europe is 55 by 79 inches, making it an inch too wide to be compatible.\n\nQueen Size Beds and European Mattress Sizes\n\nIn the United States, a queen size mattress measures 60 inches wide by 80 inches long. An American queen size is a little longer than a king size mattress in the U.K. or Ireland but comes in close to the European counterpart, which measure 60 inches by 78 inches or 63 inches by 79 inches, respectively. If you need a queen size mattress that matches the American standard, then you will need to buy queen size mattress that is made in the United States. All six BedInABox® mattresses are made entirely in the United States and are available in queen size.\n\nKing Size Beds and European Mattress Sizes\n\nBuying a mattress for a king size bed can be a little confusing if you are looking at both American and European mattress options. In the U.K. and Ireland, retailers offer a “king” mattress that is closer in size to a queen size in the United States, making a king size mattress from the U.K. or Ireland incompatible with king size beds from the United States. The closest mattress in size from continental Europe is a 72 inch by 78 inch mattress, which is still smaller than the standard 76 by 80 inch king size in the U.S. If you have American king size bed, you should avoid European mattress sizes altogether.\n\nAnytime you buy a new mattress, you should double check the measurements of your current bed to make sure that you buy the right size mattress. This process is especially important if you are looking into using a European mattress for an American bed or an American mattress for a European bed. There is some cross-compatibility in the mattress sizing standards between the two regions, however, the difference just a few inches can make should not be underestimated.
