It flows south and west, forming a wide arc for about 225 miles in the Czech Republic to its confluence with the Vltava at Mělník and is joined 18 miles downstream by the Ohře. It then cuts to the northwest through the picturesque Elbe Sandstone Mountains, and, in a gorge four miles long, it enters Germany. Between Dresden and Magdeburg the Elbe receives many long tributaries, of which all except the Schwarze Elster are left-bank streams. These are the Mulde and the Saale and its tributaries—including the Weisse (“White”) Elster, the Unstrut, and the Ilm. These left-bank tributaries rise in the Ore Mountains or the Thuringian Forest and form the drainage basin of the middle Elbe, with its geographic foci in Halle and Leipzig. Halle is on the Saale, just below the confluence of the Weisse Elster; Leipzig lies at the confluence of the Pleisse and the Weisse Elster. Below Magdeburg the Elbe receives most of its water from its right bank. Most of these tributaries rise in the uplands of Mecklenburg.\n\nThe river enters the North German Plain at Riesa, 25 miles below Dresden; below Riesa it meanders in a wide floodplain and has some abandoned loops. Dikes begin there and continue as far as the confluence of the Mulde. Between Wittenberg and Dessau the east-west valley floor narrows to five miles in width, and hilly land rises to the north (the Fläming Heath) and south. From Dessau to Magdeburg the floodplain widens, and dikes have been constructed continuously down to the sea. In its course below Magdeburg the floodplain is two miles wide down to the confluence with the Havel. The river keeps to the left of its floodplain and sometimes cuts into the low hills on its banks. Below the confluence with the Havel the river flows southeast–northwest; the floodplain widens and has distributaries and backwaters often flanked by low sandy hills (geest). Reclaimed salt marshes begin at Lauenburg. Above Hamburg—which the Elbe transverses in two arms, the Norder Elbe and the Süder Elbe—the floodplain is eight miles wide but narrows to four miles between the sandy geest of Schleswig-Holstein and the Lüneburg Heath.\n\nThe estuary proper of the Elbe (Unterelbe) extends from Hamburg to Cuxhaven, a distance of about 55 miles. It varies in width from one to two miles, but much of it is occupied by mud flats and sandbanks. The main channel is buoyed and dredged. At high tide the channel has a depth of some 53 feet (16 metres). The south or left bank is low and marshy and the river has sandbanks; the right bank is steep below Hamburg, but farther downstream there are marshes, diked and drained, that are intensively cultivated. The great port city of Hamburg grew up on the Alster River on low sandy hills above the marshes. The modern port facilities have spread to the low-lying south bank of the Elbe.\n\nHydrology\n\nThe flow of water in the Elbe varies considerably with the amount of precipitation and thawing in its drainage basin. At Dresden the discharge rate averaged 11,200 cubic feet (317 cubic metres) per second in the period 1931–75, but the rate varied from a minimum of 800 cubic feet to a maximum of 118,700. At Neu-Darchau, about 140 miles above the mouth, the discharge rate was 24,700 cubic feet per second in the period 1926–65, with extremes of 5,100 and 127,700. These great variations sometimes hinder navigation. Although there are dams on the upper Elbe in the Czech Republic and at Geesthacht, Ger., and large dams have been built on the Vltava and on the Saale in the Thuringian Forest, these are not sufficient to control the water level of the Elbe.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The average tide at Hamburg is about eight feet. However, during storms the water may rise much higher, occasionally even flooding parts of the city."
