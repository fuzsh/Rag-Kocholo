        "text": "Charging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volkswagen ID.4 Pro. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volkswagen ID.4 Pro can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point Max. Power Power Time Rate Wall Plug (2.3 kW) 230V / 1x10A 2.3 kW 39h30m 10 km/h 1-phase 16A (3.7 kW) 230V / 1x16A 3.7 kW 24h30m 17 km/h 1-phase 32A (7.4 kW) 230V / 1x32A 7.4 kW 12h15m 33 km/h 3-phase 16A (11 kW) 400V / 3x16A 11 kW 8h15m 50 km/h 3-phase 32A (22 kW) 400V / 3x16A 11 kW † 8h15m 50 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volkswagen ID.4 Pro.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\n\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\n\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point Max. Power Avg. Power Time Rate CCS (50 kW DC) 50 kW 47 kW † 72 min 230 km/h CCS (150 kW DC) 143 kW † 125 kW † 27 min 630 km/h\n\nThis vehicle does not support Autocharge This vehicle supports Plug & Charge\n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\n\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\n\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\n\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\n(Advertisement)"
