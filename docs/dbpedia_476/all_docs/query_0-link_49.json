        "text": "cord, unit of volume for measuring stacked firewood. A cord is generally equivalent to a stack 4 × 4 × 8 feet (128 cubic feet), and its principal subdivision is the cord foot, which measures 4 × 4 × 1 feet. A standard cord consists of sticks or pieces 4 feet long stacked in a 4 × 8-foot rick. A short cord is a 4 × 8-foot rick of pieces shorter than 4 feet, and a long cord is a similar rick of pieces longer than 4 feet. A face cord is a 4 × 8-foot stack of pieces 1 foot long. The cord was originally devised in order to measure firewood and was so named because a line, string, or cord was used to tie the wood into a bundle.\n\nThe useful amount of wood a cord actually contains varies greatly, depending upon such factors as the type of wood, the size and straightness of the pieces, and the amount of bark present. A tree with a usable height of 40 feet and a circumference of 6.25 feet will contain about one cord of wood."
