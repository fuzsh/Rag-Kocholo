        "text": "2.1 Introduction\n\nThe information included on a GS1 Logistic Label comes in two basic forms.\n\n1.Information to be used by people: This comprises Human Readable Interpretation (HRI) of the data encoded in the barcodes, and non-HRI text and graphics.\n\n2.Information designed for data capture by a machine: Barcodes.\n\nBarcodes are machine readable and are a secure and efficient method for conveying structured data, while HRI, Non-HRI text and graphics allow people general access to basic information at any point in the supply chain. Both methods add value to GS1 Logistic Labels, and often co-exist on the same label.\n\nNote: HRI and Non-HRI Text.\n\nFor the purposes of interpreting this guideline, there are two types of text that appear on a label:\n\n1. HRI is the data encoded in the barcode.\n\n2. Non-HRI text is all other text on a label.\n\nThe SSCC is the single mandatory element for all GS1 Logistic Labels. Other information, when needed, shall comply with the specifications in this document and with the proper use of GS1 Application Identifiers.\n\n2.2 Building blocks\n\nA distinction is made between the types of data communicated on the Logistic label. This is expressed in three building blocks:\n\n1.The top building block may contain anything, e.g. text and graphics. This may include extra information about the logistic unit that is not encoded in the barcode(s).\n\n2.The middle building block contains non-HRI text reflecting the information represented in the barcode(s) using data titles rather than AIs, and optionally additional information not represented in barcodes (preferably including data titles).\n\n3.The bottom building block contains the barcode(s) including human readable interpretation (HRI).\n\nOnly the bottom building block is mandatory.\n\nA GS1 2D symbol, if used, should be placed to the right of the non-HRI text including data titles within the middle building block.\n\nIf there is enough space, the lower two building blocks may be placed side by side. See Figure below.\n\nFigure 2‑1 Placement of Building Blocks\n\n2.3 Segments\n\nThe information to be included on the label may become available at separate stages. Some information may also need to be replaced during the lifetime of the logistic unit. Dividing the label into separate segments is a way to address this.\n\nA segment is a logical grouping of information that is generally known at a particular time. There may be up to three label segments on a GS1 Logistic Label, each representing a group of information. Generally, the order of the segments, from top to bottom, is: carrier (transport), customer, and supplier. However, this order and top/down alignment may vary depending on the size of the logistic unit and the business process being served.\n\nEach segment may contain a combination of the defined building blocks as determined by trading partners.\n\nSegments may be printed as separate labels in which case they must be placed vertically in close proximity to one another, with the segment containing the SSCC at the bottom. When segments are added separately, care should be taken not to obscure existing segments. The carrier segment may be replaced during the journey of the logistic unit, in which case special care should be taken to ensure the customer and supplier segments are preserved.\n\nImportant: When adding or replacing a segment an SSCC already present must never be replaced or changed.\n\nWhen segments are used, the data within them still needs to be organised using building blocks as described in section 2.2 . In that case segments are the primary grouping mechanism; building blocks are subordinate to that. See figure below for some examples.\n\nFigure 2‑2 Examples of label segmentation\n\nSupplier Segment\n\nThe supplier segment of the label contains information that is generally known at the time of packaging by the supplier. The SSCC is applied here as the unit identifier, along with the GTIN if used.\n\nOther information that may be of interest to the supplier but might also be useful for customers and carriers can be applied. This includes product-related information such as product variant; dates such as production, packaging, expiration, and best-before dates; and lot, batch, and serial numbers.\n\nCustomer Segment\n\nThe customer segment of the label contains information that is generally known at the time of order and order processing by the supplier. Typical information includes the ship to location, purchase order number, and customer-specific routing and handling information. If several logistic units are assembled to be transported under one despatch advice or Bill of Lading (BOL) to one customer the GSIN, AI (402) may also be applied in this customer segment.\n\nCarrier (Transport) Segment\n\nThe carrier (transport) segment of the label contains information that is generally known at the time of shipment and is typically related to transport. Typical information includes ship to postal codes, AI (420), Global Identification Number for Consignment, AI (401), and carrier-specific routing and handling information.\n\n4.1 When would I use this?\n\nItems that are priced or ordered or invoiced are considered trade items and are identified by a GTIN. Typically, supply chains are most efficient when:\n\nGTIN of ordered item = GTIN on the item being delivered = GTIN of invoiced item.\n\nThis is an important consideration in logistic label design.\n\nWhen it comes to including trade item information three types of logistic units can be distinguished:\n\n■ A homogeneous unit containing one type of trade item. All the items at the highest level of packaging are the same and are identified with the same GTIN. Example: a pallet containing 50 trade item groupings of Product X.\n\n■ A heterogeneous logistic unit containing different types of trade items at the highest level of packaging that are identified with different GTINs. Example: a pallet containing 30 standard trade item groupings (e.g. boxes) of Product X and 20 standard trade item groupings (e.g. boxes) of Product Y.\n\n■ A logistic unit that is also a traded unit (one that is priced or ordered or invoiced). Such logistic units can be homogeneous, for example goods in bulk, heterogeneous (for example display units), or a single product (for example a refrigerator, or a mobile phone transported as a parcel).\n\nFor homogeneous logistic units and logistic units that are trade items it is possible to include information about the trade item(s) on the logistic label. This can be useful in situations where no despatch advice is used or is unavailable. For heterogeneous logistic units it is not possible to include trade item information on the logistic label and therefore the use of electronic messaging is strongly encouraged to support the exchange of data linked with the SSCC.\n\nFigure 4‑1 Label including trade item information\n\n4.2 Trade item identification\n\n[4-1] When the logistic unit is homogeneous, and is not a trade item, the contents of the pallet may be defined using AI (02) CONTENT, specifying the GTIN of the included trade items (the highest packaging level contained in the logistic unit).\n\nNote: Use of AI (02) is not the preferred option for regulated healthcare trade items.\n\n[4-2] When the logistic unit is heterogeneous, and is not a trade item, no GTIN and related trade item information should be included.\n\n[4-3] When the logistic unit is a trade item, the contents of the logistic unit may be defined using AI (01) GTIN, specifying the GTIN of the trade item.\n\n[4-4] (Normative) AI (01) GTIN and AI (02) CONTENT must never be used together on a logistic label. [GENSPECS, 4.14.1]\n\n[4-5] (Normative) AI (02) CONTENT may only be used in combination with AI (00) SSCC and AI (37) COUNT. [GENSPECS, 4.14.2]\n\n[4-6] The trade item description may be included as free text.\n\n4.3 Identification of pieces of a trade item\n\nWhen trade items are too large to be shipped as one logistic unit they will need to be split into separate pieces. This also occurs when some of the pieces have special packaging requirements, e.g. the glass door of a closet.\n\nAI (8006) ITIP can be used for the identification of an individual piece of a trade item. It consists of the GTIN, the piece number (2 digits) and the total number of pieces (2 digits). AI (8006) can be used on the product packaging of the piece as well as on the GS1 Logistic Label.\n\nThe following rules address the main scenarios that have been identified:\n\n[4-7] All pieces of a single trade item are delivered together as one logistic unit: AI (01) may be used to identify the trade item.\n\n[4-8] All pieces of multiple trade items are delivered together as one logistic unit: AI (02) and AI (37) may be used to identify the content and their count.\n\n[4-9] Each of the pieces of the trade item is delivered as a separate logistic unit: AI (8006) may be used to identify an individual piece of the trade item.\n\n[4-10] The pieces of multiple trade items are mixed across several logistic units: No trade item or content information shall be included.\n\n[4-11] When several identical pieces of a trade item are transported as one logistic unit, AI (8026) may be used to identify the pieces and their count.\n\n[4-12] (Normative) ITIP of contained pieces may only be used in combination with AI (00) SSCC and AI (37) COUNT. [GENSPECS, 4.14.2-1]\n\nFigure 4‑2 Identification of pieces of a trade item\n\n4.4 Count of contained trade items\n\n[4-13] (Normative) When the identification of the contained trade items is provided by using AI (02) CONTENT, the count of trade items contained must be indicated using AI (37) COUNT. [GENSPECS, 4.14.2]\n\nFor example, a logistic unit of 12 cases of a product may be described with AI (02) containing the GTIN of the case and AI (37) showing a count of 12 cases.\n\n[4-14] (Normative) The use of AI (37) COUNT is not allowed in combination with AI (01) GTIN. [GENSPECS, 4.14.1]\n\n4.5 Trade item measures\n\nTrade (net) measures are used to complete the identification of a variable measure trade item. They contain information such as the weight, size, volume or dimension of a variable measure trade item and, therefore, should never be applied alone but with the GTIN (with leading '9').\n\n[4-15] The use of one of the following metric measures is recommended:\n\n□ net weight in kilograms - AI (310n*)\n\n□ length in meters - AI (311n*)\n\n□ area in square meters - AI (314n*)\n\n□ net volume in litres - AI (315n*)\n\n* 'n' indicates the implied decimal point position\n\n[4-16] When the identification of a variable measure trade item is completed by providing the variable count of trade items contained in it, AI (30) VAR.COUNT must be used to specify the count:\n\n□ When used in combination with AI (02) it denotes the total number of items in the logistic unit.\n\n□ When used in combination with AI (01) it denotes the total number of items within the trade item.\n\nSome roll products cannot be identified according to criteria that have been determined in advance. They are, therefore, classified as variable measure trade items. For these products the following guidelines should be used.\n\n[4-17] The GS1 Application Identifier (8001) indicates that the GS1 Application Identifier data field contains the variable attributes of a roll product.\n\nThe variable values of a roll product, N1 to N14, consist of the following data:\n\n□ N1 to N4: slit width in millimetres (width of the roll)\n\n□ N5 to N9: actual length in metres\n\n□ N10 to N12: internal core diameter in millimetres\n\n□ N13: winding direction (face out 0, face in 1, undefined 9)\n\n□ N14: number of splices (0 to 8 = actual number, 9 = number unknown)\n\n4.6 Trade item dates\n\nIt is recommended to include date information whenever it is relevant.\n\n[4-18] If applicable one of the following dates should be given, depending on the type of product :\n\n□ Production date: AI (11) PROD DATE\n\n□ Packaging date: AI (13) PACK DATE\n\n□ Best before date: AI (15) BEST BEFORE\n\n□ Sell by date: AI (16) SELL BY\n\n□ Expiry date: AI (17) EXPIRY\n\nThe included date will normally be of the same type as the date indicated on the product itself (often for legal reasons). This allows for consistent tracking and tracing as the date used on the logistic label will match the date marked on the product.\n\nTraceability systems will not work, and possibly legal requirements will not be met if the correct date is not used. AI (15) is a statement about quality (e.g. a bottle of drinking water past its best before date may have diminished quality but it should not be harmful). AI (16) indicates the date specified by the manufacturer as the last date the retailer is to offer the product for sale to the consumer. AI (17) is the date that determines the limit of consumption or use of a product.\n\nThe following general rules should be applied when using dates on the GS1 Logistic Label:\n\n[4-19] (Normative) Dates always relate to the GTIN specified on the label as AI (01) GTIN or as AI (02) CONTENT or AI (8006) ITIP or AI (8026) ITIP CONTENT. [GENSPECS, 4.14.2]\n\n[4-20] (Normative) For all of the date types mentioned in rule [4-12] only one date value can be specified on a logistic label. If the trade items contained in the logistic unit have various date values, these cannot be specified on the label. [GENSPECS, 4.14].\n\n[4-21] Best practice for FIFO purposes: When trade items with multiple best before dates are loaded on the logistic unit, the earliest date on any item is used in both the despatch advice and on the label.\n\n[4-22] (Normative) When expressed in barcode form, the date format for each AI is always YYMMDD where:\n\n□ YY provides the tens and units of the year (e.g. 2006 = 06) and is mandatory\n\n□ MM provides the number of the month (e.g. January = 01) and is also mandatory\n\n□ DD provides the number of the day of the relevant month (e.g. second day = 02); For Best Before or Expiry Dates it may not be necessary to specify the day. In that case the field must be filled with two zeroes, and will be interpreted as the last day of the noted month.\n\n4.7 Batch / lot number\n\nThe Batch or Lot number of the trade item(s) may be included as AI (10) BATCH/LOT.\n\n[4-23] (Normative) The batch / lot number always relates to the GTIN specified on the label as AI (01) GTIN or as AI (02) CONTENT or AI (8006) ITIP or AI (8026) ITIP CONTENT. [GENSPECS, 4.14.2]\n\n[4-24] (Normative) Only one batch number can be put on a logistic label. If a logistic unit contains products with different batch numbers (at the highest level of packaging), these batch numbers cannot be shown on the label. [GENSPECS, 4.14]\n\n4.8 Serial numbers\n\nA serial number for the trade item may be included as AI (21) SERIAL.\n\n[4-25] (Normative) The serial number always must be used in combination with a GTIN that is specified on the label as AI (01) GTIN or AI (8006) ITIP. [GENSPECS, 4.14.2]\n\n4.9 Extract of main GS1 Application Identifiers for trade item information\n\n(*) 'n' is used to indicate the decimal point position.\n\n(**) Format of the GS1 Application Identifier + Format of the data element\n\n5.1 When would I use this?\n\nCarriers (Logistic service providers) will often not have access to electronic information related to an SSCC. For them the inclusion of additional information is important. Customers / receivers may also not always have access to all the required information.\n\nTypical information used for transport includes ship to postal code, consignment number, and carrier-specific routing and handling information such as a routing code. Typical customer information includes the ship to location, ultimate consignee address, purchase order number, shipment number, etc.\n\nThe label facilitates automatic data capture of SSCCs when tracking packages and is also intended to be used for automatic sorting at transport terminals.\n\nTransport information can be used for basic transport and delivery scenarios, but also in support of more advanced scenarios, such as order reconstruction.\n\nFigure 5‑1 Label including transport information\n\n5.2 Customer (Receiver) name and address\n\nThe ship to address is necessary for carriers in order to know the delivery location and to be able to deliver the goods to the right destination.\n\n[5-1] The ship to information must relate to the physical address where the goods need to be delivered.\n\n[5-2]When the goods are delivered via a cross-dock terminal the ship to information must relate to the physical address of the terminal. The final destination address must be specified separately, see paragraph 5.5 Ship for location / ultimate consignee.\n\n[5-3] The exact Ship To location can be included using the Global Location Number (GLN) in AI (410) SHIP TO LOC.\n\n[5-4] Partial identification of the Ship To location can be accomplished by including the postal code in AI (420) SHIP TO POST or AI (421) SHIP TO POST. The use of AI (421) is recommended and has the following structure: Country code (ISO 3166-1 numeric 3 format) followed by postal code (alphanumeric maximum 9 characters).\n\n[5-5] (Normative) AI (420) SHIP TO POST and AI (421) SHIP TO POST must never be used in combination. [GENSPECS, 4.14.1]\n\nThe customer name and address may be included as free text:\n\n[5-6] Depending on the country, the address can be expressed by one or several lines.\n\n[5-7] Inclusion of the postal code is strongly recommended.\n\n[5-8] The country code in Non-HRI text should be based on ISO 3166 with alpha 2 code.\n\n5.3 Supplier (Shipper) name and address\n\nThe supplier (shipper) name and address may be useful for carriers. The supplier (shipper) name and address may only be included as free text.\n\n[5-9] The supplier (shipper) information may relate to the either the physical address where the goods came from or the business address of the supplier (shipper).\n\n[5-10] Depending on the country, the address can be expressed by one or several lines.\n\n[5-11] Inclusion of the postal code is strongly recommended.\n\n[5-12] The country code in Non-HRI text should be based on ISO 3166 with alpha 2 code.\n\n[5-13] It is recommended to depict the supplier (shipper) name and address in a smaller font than the customer (receiver) name and address.\n\n5.4 Routing code\n\nThe routing code is a code used by the carrier to efficiently steer logistic units through its network. Its content and structure are at the discretion of the carrier issuing the code. The routing code is intended to provide carriers such as parcel networks with a migration path towards full adoption of the SSCC.\n\n[5-14] The routing code can be included using AI (403) ROUTE.\n\n[5-15] The routing code can also be included as free text information.\n\n5.5 Ship for location / ultimate consignee\n\nIf the details of the ultimate consignee are known at the time when the logistic unit is constructed and labelled, it is strongly recommended to include the location number of the ultimate consignee using the AI (413) SHIP FOR LOC.\n\n[5-16] The ultimate consignee location is included using the Global Location Number (GLN) in AI (413) SHIP FOR LOC.\n\n[5-17] The ultimate consignee name and address may also be included as free text information.\n\n5.6 Shipment identification\n\nThe shipment identification can be included on the label to ensure logistic units belonging to the same shipment will be delivered together.\n\nThe GS1 Identification Key for shipments is the Global Shipment Identification Number (GSIN). The format of the GSIN is as follows:\n\nThe GS1 Company Prefix (GCP) is assigned by a GS1 Member Organisation to the company creating the shipment.\n\nThe Shipper Reference is a serial number created by the shipper. The simplest way to allocate the serial number is sequentially, for example ….00000, …00001, …00002.\n\nThe Check Digit is calculated using the algorithm defined by GS1. [GENSPECS, 7.9.1], for a check digit calculator see [CHECK].\n\n[5-18] The shipment identification should be included using the Global Shipment Identification Number (GSIN) in AI (402) GSIN.\n\n5.7 Consignment identification\n\nThe consignment identification can be included on the label to ensure completeness of a group of logistic units being transported together under the same transport contract. This can be important in cases where the logistic units are transported by secondary transport operators, only responsible for part of the total journey (for example via rail or ocean).\n\nThe GS1 Identification Key for consignments is the Global Identification Number for Consignment (GINC). The format of the GINC is as follows:\n\nThe GS1 Company Prefix (GCP) is assigned by a GS1 Member Organisation to the company that allocates the GINC - here the freight forwarder or carrier of the transport units.\n\nThe Consignment Reference is a serial number created by the carrier or freight forwarder. Typically, the GINC is used by freight forwarders to instruct transport providers, and holds the Master Way Bill (MWB) Number, for example a Master Airway Bill (MAWB) or a Master Bill-of-lading (MBL).\n\n[5-19] The consignment identification should be included using the Global Identification Number for Consignments (GINC) in AI (401) GINC.\n\n5.8 Customer's purchase order number\n\nThe customer's purchase order number can be included on the label.\n\n[5-20] The customer's purchase order number can be included using AI (400) ORDER NUMBER.\n\n5.9 Logistic measures\n\nWeight information about the individual logistic unit as well as for the total shipment (for example in the form of nnn/nnn) can be useful information when transiting through intermediate warehouses. Depending on the situation, the label issuer may need to specify:\n\n■ Weight: 50 / 300 the parcel weight and the shipment weight are known.\n\n■ Weight: - / 300 only the total weight of the shipment is known.\n\n■ Weight: 50 / - only the weight of the parcel is known. Total weight is unknown.\n\nBesides weight information also volume, area or dimensions may be of importance.\n\n[5-21] The use of one or more of the following measures is available depending on the nature of the logistic unit:\n\n□logistic weight: kilograms - AI (330n*), pounds - AI (340n*)\n\n□logistic volume: litres - AI (335n*), cubic metres - AI (336n*), quarts - AI (362n*), gallons (US) - AI (363n*), cubic inches - AI (367n*), cubic feet - AI (368n*), cubic yards - AI (369n*)\n\n□area: square metres - AI (334n*), square inches - AI (353n*), square feet - AI (354n*), square yards - AI (355n*)\n\n□kilograms per square metre - AI (337n*)\n\n□length: meters - AI (331n*), inches - AI (341n*), feet - AI (342n*), yards - AI (343n*)\n\n□width: meters - AI (332n*), inches - AI (344n*), feet - AI (345n*), yards - AI (346n*)\n\n□height: meters - AI (333n*), inches - AI (347n*), feet - AI (348n*), yards - AI (349n*)\n\n□ * 'n' indicates the implied decimal point position\n\n5.10 Handling and processing instructions\n\nFree Format\n\nThe label issuer can include text or symbols indicating manual handling instructions on the label as free text.\n\nFor example:\n\nSymbol 1(0- 15kg) Symbol 2(>15-25kg) Symbol 3(>25kg)\n\n5.11 Extract of GS1 Application Identifiers for transport and customer information\n\n6.1 Top building block\n\nThe top building block may include any text or graphics. The name and address of the sender and receiver are typical examples. In many instances companies may also wish to add specific graphics to a label (e.g., company logos).\n\n[6-1] (Normative) All text shall be clearly legible and no less than 3 millimetres / 0.118 inches high. [GENSPECS, 6.6.4.4]\n\n6.2 Middle building block\n\nThe middle building block contains non-HRI text reflecting the information represented in barcode(s) using data title rather than AIs, and optionally additional information not represented in barcodes (preferably including data titles).\n\n[6-2] All barcoded data elements must also be included as text with data titles.\n\n[6-3] (Normative) The data content should be at least 7 mm (0.28 inch) in height [GENSPECS, 6.6.4.2]\n\n[6-4] A GS1 2D barcode, if used, should be placed to the right of the text within the middle building block.\n\n6.2.1Data titles\n\nData titles are the standard abbreviated descriptions of element strings used to support the human interpretation of encoded data. Data titles should be used adjacent to all data fields included in the middle building block.\n\nNote: Data Titles may also be used adjacent to barcodes and HRI.\n\n[6-5] (Normative) Data titles should be provided for all AIs encoded in the barcodes.\n\n[6-6] (Normative) If there is no language agreed between trading partners, data titles must be printed in English. A second language may be added. For English data titles, the exact data titles as specified in the 'GS1 General Specifications' should be used. [GENSPECS, 6.6.4.2]\n\n[6-7] Data titles should be presented in UPPERCASE.\n\n[6-8] To avoid any confusion, the data title for dates may be followed by the chosen format, e.g. BEST BEFORE (dd.mm.yyyy): 24.12.2013. This may be different from the format used within the barcode which is always YYMMDD.\n\n6.3 Bottom building block\n\nThe bottom building block contains the GS1-128 barcode(s) including their human readable interpretation (HRI).\n\nGS1-128 is a special version or subset of Code 128.\n\n[6-9] (Normative) GS1-128 barcodes must be distinguished from Code 128 barcodes by the use of the special Function 1 character (FNC1) after the start character.\n\nAn enlarged section of the first part of a GS1-128 barcode showing the FNC1 in blue is shown below.\n\nFigure 6‑1 . FNC1 character in GS1-128 barcode.\n\nEnlarged section of first part of a GS1-128 barcode\n\nshowing the Function 1 character in blue\n\nGS1 Application Identifiers\n\nEach data field in a GS1-barcode is preceded by a GS1 Application Identifier (AI). GS1 Application Identifiers are used to identify the meaning and format of the data following each AI.\n\nThe data fields are either of fixed or variable length, depending on the AI. There is a range of AIs for additional data, such as weight, area or volume. Full details of all the GS1 Application Identifiers can be found in the 'GS1 General Specifications' [GENSPECS].\n\n[6-10] All the data in each GS1-128 barcode is denoted by the use of GS1 Application Identifiers, which specify the format of the data which follows them. This data may be numeric only, alphanumeric, fixed or variable in length.\n\nConcatenation\n\nA GS1 Application Identifier and the data that follows it are known as an element string, and several element strings may be shown in one GS1-128 barcode. This joining together of element strings is known as concatenation.\n\nConcatenation is an effective means for encoding several AIs in a single barcode and should be used to save label space and optimise scanning operations.\n\n[6-11] It is best practice is to encode data of fixed length before any variable data within a GS1-128 barcode\n\n[6-12] The order in which the element strings appear in GS1-128 barcodes is not specified. Quality software contains optimisation procedures, which improves scanning and printing\n\n[6-13] (Normative) The SSCC, defined by AI (00), shall always appear in the lowest barcode on the label [GENSPECS, 6.6.4.1.1].\n\n[6-14] The SSCC can be alone or concatenated with other data in the same barcode. Concatenation shall not be used with SSCC on cartons and outer cases and on A6 / 4x6 labels.\n\nX-dimension (Symbol size)\n\nThe X-dimension is the specified width of the narrowest element in a barcode symbol.\n\n[6-15] (Normative) The allowed X-dimension range for the GS1-128 barcode symbol is between 0.495 mm (0.0195\") and 0.94 mm (0.0370\"). The target X-dimension recommended for the GS1-128 barcode symbol is 0.495 mm (0.0195\"). [GENSPECS, 5.9.3.5, table 5].\n\n[6-16] When multiple barcodes are used it is recommended to use similar X-dimensions. This helps scanning systems to work more effectively.\n\n[6-17]Note that using an X-dimension at the higher end of the permitted range can support consistent scanning when the barcode might be used in challenging application environments (e.g., freezing can degrade print quality).\n\nBarcode height\n\n[6-18] (Normative) A minimum height of at least 31.75 mm (1.250\") applies to all the GS1-128 barcodes on the label. The minimum symbol height indicated is for bar height only and does not include the Human Readable Interpretation. [GENSPECS, 5.9.3.5, table 5]\n\nQuiet zones / Light margins\n\n[6-19] (Normative) Barcodes shall be printed with quiet zones (or light margins) at each side. The quiet zones must be at least 10 X-dimension (10 X) in width. Centred barcodes will help ensure the quiet zones are respected.\n\nOrientation and placement\n\n[6-20] (Normative) Horizontal orientation (picket fence orientation) of barcode symbols must be used on logistic units. In other words, the bars and spaces shall be perpendicular to the base on which the logistic unit stands.\n\nHuman readable interpretation\n\n[6-21] All the data shown in each barcode should be provided below each symbol. Brackets (parentheses) are normally printed around each AI but these must not be encoded in the barcode.\n\n[6-22] (Normative) The data must be shown in characters at least 3 mm high and clearly legible. [GENSPECS, 4.15]\n\nAI uniqueness (no repetition)\n\n[6-23] Each GS1 Application Identifier (AI) may only occur once on a logistic label.\n\n6.4 Rules related to label segments\n\nThe order and top/down alignment of label segments may vary depending on the size of the logistic unit and the business process being served.\n\n[6-24] (Normative) Within each separate label segment the building blocks must be placed according to the lay-out defined in section 2.2 . Building blocks [GENSPECS, 6.6.3.2]\n\n[6-25] (Normative) A segment holding the SSCC shall always be present, and shall be positioned under any other segments. [GENSPECS, 6.6.3.1]\n\n[6-26] Segments may be printed as separate labels in which case they should be placed vertically in close proximity of each other, with the segment containing the SSCC at the bottom. When segments are added separately, care should be taken not to obscure existing segments.\n\n[6-27] The carrier segment may be replaced during the journey of the logistic unit. The original SSCC should be preserved in that case, either by leaving the segment holding the SSCC intact, or by reproducing the original SSCC on the new label / label segment.\n\n8.1 Label placement on larger logistic units (pallets, roll cages, etc.)\n\n[8-1] (Normative) For all types of pallets the barcodes SHALL be positioned between 400 millimetres (16 inches) and 800 millimetres (32 inches) from the base of the pallet. For pallet less than 400 millimetres (16 inches) high, the barcode SHALL be placed as high as possible while protecting the barcode. [GENSPECS, 6.7.1.1]\n\n[8-2] (Normative) The symbol including its Quiet Zones, SHALL be at least 50 millimetres (2.0 inches) from any vertical edge to avoid damage. [GENSPECS, 6.7.1.1]\n\n[8-3] Each logistic unit should at the minimum have one label. For pallets it is recommended that two sides of the item are labelled the exact same data, to ensure one label is always visible (e.g. pallets that are stored either long or short edge facing). On rolling logistic units a label on one side is usually sufficient.\n\nNote: There is no regulation that specifies where the labels should be placed - to the left, in the middle, or to the right on these sides - but as most forklift operators are right-handed, the most ergonomically correct scanning is done when the labels are placed to the right of each side.\n\nFigure 8‑1 Example of label placement on pallets\n\nNote: This diagram is an example only and in some cases it may be necessary for two labels to be placed on opposite sides of the pallet.\n\n8.2 Label placement on smaller logistic units (including parcels)\n\n[8-4] (Normative) For cartons and outer cases, symbol placement will vary slightly in practice, however the target placement for the bottom of the barcode is 32 millimetres (1.25 inches) from the natural base of the item. [GENSPECS, 6.7.1.2]\n\n[8-5] (Normative) The symbol including its Quiet Zones, should be at least 19 millimetres (0.75 inch) from any vertical edge to avoid damage. [GENSPECS, 6.7.1.2]\n\n[8-6] Each logistic unit should at the minimum have one label.\n\nFigure 8‑2 Label placement on cases\n\nCarton / Outer Case Labels: For Carton / Outer Case Labels the same guidelines apply. In situations where both a Carton / Outer Case Label as well as a Logistic Label need to be applied on the case, the recommendation is to place the GS1 Logistic Label to the left of the Carton / Outer Case Label, and to ensure that the information on the Carton / Outer Case Label remains visible.\n\n8.3 Label placement on stacked pallets\n\nStacked pallets, also referred to as sandwich pallets, are groups of pallets that are stacked for shipment.\n\n[8-7] When pallets are stacked they should be considered independent logistic units (see Figure below), each pallet should be identified with a unique SSCC.\n\nFigure 8‑3 Stacked Pallets as Independent Logistic Units\n\n[8-8] If the group will be shipped as a unit and is physically joined using shrink-wrap, straps, or similar means (see Figure below), the group should be considered as a single logistic unit as well and an additional SSCC should be assigned to the stacked pallet group.\n\nNote: In cases where the stacked pallets are shipped as one single unit, the original labels should not be visible. A master label with the SSCC for the pallet group should be applied to the outside of the wrapping. The wrap and master label may be removed upon receipt and the labels for each stacked pallet will be used to identify each pallet for subsequent processing.\n\nFigure 8‑4 Stacked Pallets combined into a single logistic unit\n\n9.1 Best practice processes by role\n\nUsually the shipper of the goods will create the logistic label and apply it to the logistic unit. Responsibility for the correctness of all the information contained on the label is assumed to rest with the shipper.\n\nIf it is not the shipper but the carrier or receiver creating the label, or replacing the label, or adding additional information to the label, this party is responsible for content and quality its own data and its compliance with data already present.\n\nThe table below lists various parties and how they may use the label in their business processes depending on the role they play.\n\n9.2 Label implementation scenarios\n\nDepending on the business scenario various label formats may be implemented. Some typical variants are:\n\n■ A pre-printed SSCC-only label is a good option when there is no 'print and apply capability'. Pre-printed SSCC labels are applied to a logistic unit, scanned and then electronically associated to the GTINs and all related data. A pre-printed label can be applied anywhere in the supply chain (from when the pallet is produced to when it is received by a customer).\n\n■ A production label containing supplier and trade item information can be printed and applied at the time the pallet (logistic unit) is manufactured. This label can stay with the pallet/logistic unit through the supply chain if it is delivered in a full pallet quantity to the customer.\n\n■ A picked pallet label is printed and applied at the time the pallet (logistic unit) is picked for a customer, and may contain supplier, customer and carrier information.\n\n■ An existing SSCC label (e.g. pre-printed SSCC-only label or production label) is already applied, and the carrier or customer data is added by applying an additional label segment.\n\n9.3 Shipper / Supplier\n\nThe shipper may be the supplier or a logistic service provider (LSP) acting on behalf of the supplier.\n\nIf the LSP acts as the shipper, after the supplier receives an order an Instruction to Despatch will be sent to the LSP. The LSP should be able to pick and load the shipment according to the instructions, this could include a reconfiguration of existing logistic units.\n\n9.3.1Pre-requisites\n\n[9-1] The shipper / supplier should have the ability to communicate electronically.\n\n[9-2] Trade item data alignment is a prerequisite in order to enable efficient shipping and receiving process. The shipper / supplier should ensure that master data have been communicated to the receiver / customer.\n\n[9-3] Each warehouse should have scanners to read the GS1-128 barcode(s) printed on the labels\n\n9.3.2Creating the SSCC\n\n[9-4] SSCC numbers should be generated out of the logistic management system, e.g. the warehouse management system (WMS) or ERP.\n\n[9-5] The shipper should use its own GS1 Company Prefix to generate the SSCC.\n\nNote: If the shipper uses a cloud service to generate labels, SSCCs are usually generated from the IT solution provider's GS1 Company Prefix. This may lead to weaker traceability and is an incorrect use of the GS1 standards.\n\n[9-6] SSCCs that have been created should be archived for traceability purposes.\n\nFigure 9‑1 Examples of system integration problems\n\n9.3.3Printing the label\n\nPreparation\n\n[9-7] Standard paper sizes are recommended, e.g. A5 or A6.\n\n[9-8] Label material and ink have to be compatible. Material or ink which is sensitive to heat is not acceptable, e.g. avoid thermal paper that changes colour when exposed to heat or sun, and inks that can be easily smudged.\n\n[9-9] It is recommended to print black barcodes on a white background.\n\n[9-10\n\n[9-11] The label printer should be checked regularly to ensure it is up and running, and serviced and calibrated correctly.\n\nLabel verification\n\n[9-12] Label verification during implementation should include three different levels (see appendix A for a detailed implementation verification procedure):\n\n□ Visual check of a label\n\n□ Relevant information on a label\n\n□ Technical parameters = barcode symbol verification.\n\n[9-13] After implementation, in the operational phase, regular verifications should be performed to maintain label quality.\n\nFigure 9‑2 Examples of printing-related problems\n\n9.3.4Attaching the label\n\nIt is important the right label(s) is / are attached to the right logistic unit and the labels are scannable.\n\n[9-14] When not attached automatically, an option is to print labels for each logistic unit one at the time in order to limit risk of applying the wrong label.\n\n[9-15] Other common problems to avoid are:\n\n□ Wrinkling when applying the label.\n\n□ Incorrect placement of the label.\n\n□ Obscured label (over wrapping / seal).\n\nFigure 9‑3 Examples of placement problems\n\n9.3.5Sending the transport instruction\n\n[9-16] If available at the time that the transport instruction is sent to the LSP. The transport instruction should specify the SSCCs of the logistic units to be transported.\n\n9.3.6Staging / Loading the logistic units\n\n[9-17] Only loaded pallets should be scanned. This ensures correct delivery information for despatch advice / ASN and transport documents.\n\n9.3.7Sending the Despatch Advice / ASN\n\n[9-18] The Despatch Advice / ASN should be sent upon staging / loading of the goods, in order to maximise the chance that the information matches the actual shipment.\n\n[9-19] The Despatch Advice / ASN should specify for each logistic unit the SSCC and the contained trade items.\n\n[9-20] The variable data related to the trade item must match the information of the actual goods present on the logistic unit.\n\n9.4 Carrier\n\nThe optimal collaboration between a supplier (shipper) - carrier - customer (receiver) is crucial for an efficient shipping and receiving process, and the carrier plays a central role.\n\n9.4.1Pre-requisites\n\n[9-21] The carrier should have the ability to communicate electronically\n\n[9-22] Each truck should have a scanner to read the barcode(s) printed on the labels\n\n9.4.2Processing the Transport Instruction\n\n[9-23] In the Transport Instruction information on the logistic units that need to be transported may be included. If that is the case the carrier should ensure that this information is communicated to the person in charge of the transport execution, for example the driver.\n\n9.4.3Loading the logistic units\n\n[9-24] The carrier may scan the label in order to register which logistic units were loaded.\n\n[9-25] When a label is already present additional transport data is best added on an extra label, attached adjacent to and preferably above the already present label. When a label is added separately, care should be taken not to obscure the existing label. The extra label should only contain data not yet present on the other label.\n\nAny additional labels that contain information already present on other labels pose a potential risk for non-scans/confusion.\n\nFigure 9‑4 Example of problems occurring during transport\n\nWhen no label is present\n\n[9-26] When no label is present upon collecting of the goods the carrier may generate the SSCC based on its own GS1 Company Prefix and for example create an SSCC-only label or a transport label.\n\n9.4.4Unloading the logistic units\n\n[9-27] The carrier may scan the label in order to register which logistic units were unloaded.\n\n9.4.5Sending the Transport Status Notification / Information on Delivery (IOD)\n\n[9-28] Upon completion of the delivery the carrier should send a Transport Status Notification informing his client on the completion of the transport order and on any discrepancies that occurred.\n\n9.5 Receiver / Customer\n\nThe receiver may be the customer, for example a retailer, or a logistic service provider receiving the goods on behalf of the customer.\n\n9.5.1Pre-requisites\n\n[9-29] The receiver / customer should have the ability to communicate electronically\n\n[9-30] Master data of the trade item need to be in place. Unknown items cannot be received efficiently.\n\n[9-31] Each warehouse should have scanners to read the barcode(s) printed on the labels\n\n[9-32] Each warehouse should have a warehouse management system to support the receiving process\n\n[9-33] Rejection of delivery (or otherwise) without Despatch Advice / ASN should be included in the contract\n\n9.5.2Processing the Despatch Advice / ASN\n\n[9-34] The Despatch Advice / ASN should be received and processed into the receivers' system before the goods arrive.\n\n9.5.3Inspecting and registering the received logistic units\n\nDepending on the agreement between the supplier and receiver the SSCC may be scanned and the goods accepted as complete as indicated in the Despatch Advice / ASN. Alternatively, the receiver may wish to check the logistic units to confirm that the contents are as agreed in the Despatch Advice / ASN and also to check for any damage. This would apply particularly where the logistic unit contains multiple products. Checks will depend on the contract between the receiver and their supplier.\n\n[9-35] Labels should not be removed before put away is complete, and preferably kept to assist traceability if necessary\n\n[9-36] When the SSCC is scanned it should match the information in the Despatch Advice / ASN, and the received amount should be automatically added to the Warehouse system and update the stock level.\n\nFigure 9‑5 . Example of issues occurring at receipt\n\n9.5.4Sending the receiving advice\n\nThe receiver can use the Receiving Advice message to notify the supplier that the goods have been received. He may confirm receipt of all products or only those where there may be a problem e.g. damaged or missing goods. This will allow the supplier to replace the missing or damaged goods promptly. For maximum benefit, the supplier should have an automated process to efficiently recognise and action any errors as notified by the customer.\n\n9.5.5Storing the goods\n\n[9-37] Where possible, the goods should be stored preserving the SSCC relationship so that they can be traced when necessary.\n\n9.5.6Handling quality issues found after goods receipt\n\nIf there is damage to the goods, or any other product issues, then the supplier (and haulier if not managed or owned by the supplier) should be notified so that they can make adjustment to their invoice before sending to the customer.\n\n10.1 SSCC-only label\n\nSource: [GENSPECS]\n\nThis example shows a label containing only an SSCC. Such labels can be applied at production time, but also during transport or receipt when no label is present on the logistic unit.\n\nBuilding blocks (top-down):\n\n■ Text with Data Titles: SSCC\n\n■ Barcodes + HRI: AI (00)\n\n10.2 GS1 Logistic Label for homogeneous logistic unit\n\n10.3 GS1 Logistic Label for homogeneous logistic unit with variable measure items\n\n10.4 GS1 Logistic Label for orderable pallet\n\n10.5 GS1 Logistic Label for logistic unit that is a single trade item\n\nIf a logistic unit includes only one trade item, a logistic label should contain the following data:\n\n10.6 GS1 Logistic Label for mixed pallet\n\nMandatory data\n\nSSCC with AI (00)\n\nOptional data\n\nnone\n\n10.7 GS1 Logistic Label with logistic unit and transport information in separate segments\n\nSource [GENSPECS]\n\nThis example shows a case label that may be applied at the time of transport. Besides the SSCC it contains information on the route and destination.\n\nSegments and building blocks (top-down):\n\n■ Carrier Segment\n\n□ Free Format: FROM, TO\n\n□ Barcodes and HRI: SHIP TO POST\n\n□ Text with Data Titles: CARRIER; B/L, PRO\n\n■ Supplier Segment\n\n□ Barcodes and HRI: SSCC; AI (00)\n\n10.8 GS1 Logistic Label with supplier, customer and transport segments\n\nSource [GENSPECS]\n\nThis example shows a case label that may be applied in a cross-docking scenario. Besides the SSCC it contains transport information and information on the final customer destination.\n\nSegments and building blocks (top-down):\n\n■ Carrier segment:\n\n□ Free Format: FROM, TO\n\n□ Barcodes and HRI: SHIP TO POST\n\n□ Text with Data Titles: Carrier; B/L, PRO\n\n■ Customer segment\n\n□ Free Format: PO, DEPT\n\n□ Barcodes and HRI: Store Number\n\n□ Text with Data Titles: Customer\n\n■ Supplier segment\n\n□ Barcodes and HRI: SSCC; AI (00)\n\n10.9 GS1 Logistic Label with transport information including postal code\n\nIn this example, the postal code is used with the GS1 Application Identifier (421).\n\nSource: STILL\n\n10.10 GS1 Logistic Label with transport information including routing code and GINC\n\nIn this example, the routing code is used with the GS1 Application Identifier (403)\n\nSource [GENSPECS]\n\nThis example shows a pallet label that may be applied at the time of transport. Besides information on the logistic unit it contains information on the route and destination.\n\nBuilding blocks (top-down):\n\n■ Free Format: Von/From, An/To\n\n■ Text with Data Titles: SSSC, ROUTE; Dimensions / Weight; Billing No.\n\n■ Barcodes and HRI: AI (403), AI (401), AI (00)\n\n10.11 GS1 Logistic Label for parcel (SSCC-only)\n\nThis example shows a parcel label that only contains name and address information and an SSCC. This shipper-assigned label would be suitable for any parcel carrier network since it does not contain carrier-specific information.\n\nBuilding blocks (top-down):\n\n■ Free Format: Carrier info; From ; To ; Symbol indicating the recipient needs to sign upon receipt.\n\n■ Barcodes and HRI: AI (00)\n\nNote: This example of the GS1 Logistic Label for parcels is compliant with the CEN Harmonised Parcel Label, see [HPARCEL]. It uses the SSCC as the only parcel ID on the label.\n\n10.12 GS1 Logistic Label for parcel (including routing code)\n\nThis example shows a parcel label that contains name and address information, an SSCC and a carrier-specific routing code. The routing code is carrier-specific and intended to aid migration to a fully generic parcel label (see section5.4). The other information is generic and suitable for any parcel carrier.\n\nBuilding blocks (top-down):\n\n■ Free Format: Carrier info ; From ; To ; Symbol indicating the recipient needs to sign upon receipt.\n\n■ Text with Data Titles: SSCC; ROUTE\n\n■ Barcodes and HRI: AI (403); AI (00)\n\nNote: This example of the GS1 Logistic Label for parcels is compliant with the CEN Harmonised Parcel Label, see [HPARCEL]. It uses the SSCC as the shipper-assigned parcel ID on the label, and in addition an optional carrier specific or UPU parcel ID, represented using AI (403).\n\n10.13 GS1 Logistic Label for parcel (including a GS1 2D barcode)\n\nThis example shows a parcel label that contains name and address information, an SSCC and a carrier-specific routing code. The routing code is carrier-specific and intended to aid migration to a fully generic parcel label (see section5.4). The other information is generic and suitable for any parcel carrier.\n\nBuilding blocks (top-down):\n\n■ Free Format: Carrier info; From; To;\n\n■ Text with Data Titles and GS1 DataMatrix: SSCC; ROUTE, SHIP TO POST\n\n■ GS1-128 and HRI: AI (00)\n\nNote: This example shows a GS1 DataMatrix, a GS1 QR Code would also be acceptable.\n\n10.14 GS1 Logistic Label with identification of individual trade item piece - AI (8006)\n\nThis example shows a label that contains the identifier of a piece of a trade item, using AI (8006). It corresponds with item B in the scenario (see section 4.3) in which each piece of a trade item is a separate logistic unit.\n\nBuilding blocks (top-down):\n\n■ Free Format: From; To, Dimensions / Weight, Item\n\n■ Text with Data Titles: SSCC; ITIP;\n\n■ Barcodes and HRI: AI (8006); AI (00)"
