        "text": "With its fantastic Autobahn and spectacular scenery, Germany is a top destination for a road trip. But, like other overseas countries, it has a unique set of rules for drivers. If you’re planning to travel to Germany by car, it’s essential you know the differences to driving in the UK.\n\nTo make your trip to the Continent as safe and stress-free as possible, we’ve put together a guide to everything you need to know before you go, from required documents to rules of the road.\n\nRAC European Breakdown Cover (Basic and Comprehensive) provides a wide range of benefits should you break down in Germany to ensure you stay safe.\n\nTo supplement this, RAC also offers travel insurance. Cover will include medical expenses, baggage, personal money and belongings, among many other benefits.\n\nNeed insurance for your road trip? Our temporary car insurance product is perfect if you're looking for flexible and comprehensive cover for between 1 hour and 30 days.\n\nVehicles from the UK can be temporarily imported into Germany for up to six months in any period of 12 months. In order to stay on the right side of the law, the following documents should always be carried:\n\nFull, valid UK driving licence\n\nProof of ID (passport)\n\nMotor insurance certificate\n\nV5 registration document\n\nEmissions sticker\n\nDo I need a GB or UK sticker for driving in Germany?\n\nSince 28th September 2021, the distinguishing mark (or national identifier) displayed on vehicles registered in the United Kingdom that are driven abroad has changed from GB to UK.\n\nThis means that vehicles registered in the UK must display the letters 'UK' when driven in Germany.\n\nThe identifier can be incorporated in vehicle number plates (along with the Union Flag) or as a separate sticker. Note that vehicles featuring the letters GB together with the Council of Europe golden stars are no longer valid for driving abroad.\n\nIf your vehicle does not have the UK identifier within the number plate, you will require a UK sticker when driving in Germany. GB stickers will no longer be valid from the end of September.\n\nDo I need an insurance green card?\n\nSince 2nd August 2021, drivers no longer require an insurance green card for taking their vehicles to Germany.\n\nETIAS – 2025\n\nETIAS stands for the European Travel Information and Authorisation System. It is a visa program for visitors who don’t need a Schengen visa, who want to travel to the European Union and a few other European countries.\n\nVisitors who purchase an ETIAS will be able to enter the 26 member states of the Schengen Zone as well as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania.\n\nThis will be launching in 2025. Learn more about ETIAS here.\n\nIn addition to essential documents, motorists are also required by law to carry the following items to avoid hefty on-the-spot fines:\n\nReflective jackets\n\nWarning triangle (compulsory in every vehicle with four wheels or more)\n\nHeadlamp beam deflectors (depending on your car, you will either need deflector stickers or have to adjust the beam manually)\n\nFirst-aid kit (only compulsory for four-wheeled vehicles registered in Germany)\n\nWinter tyres (Germany introduced regulations in 2010 requiring all passenger cars and motorbikes to be fitted with winter or all-season tyres in wintry conditions)\n\nCrash helmet if you’re riding a moped or motorcycle. Motorcycles on the road must have their passing lights on at all times, even in daylight\n\nOur European driving kit has all the essentials you need for driving in Germany. If you’re camping, a Camping Card International could also be useful as it gives you additional proof of identity, third party liability insurance, plus discounts at a wide range of campsites and tourist attractions.\n\nIs there anything that I shouldn’t take with me?\n\nBe aware that you cannot take the following with you into Germany:\n\nmeat or products containing meat\n\nmilk or dairy products\n\nYou cannot take the following unless you pay to have them inspected before you leave and get a ‘phytosanitary certificate’:\n\nfresh fruit (apart from bananas, coconuts, dates, pineapples and durians)\n\nvegetables\n\nplants\n\nplant products\n\nOvertaking and passing\n\nIn Germany, motorists drive on the right and overtake on the left.\n\nWhere heavy traffic has built up into queues and two or more lanes of traffic are moving in the same direction, vehicles on the right may overtake those on the left.\n\nTrams must be overtaken on the right if they are moving, unless the space is inadequate. In that situation, they can be overtaken on the left. Trams can also be overtaken on either side of a one-way street, while priority should always be given to those boarding or alighting them.\n\nDrivers cannot overtake a school bus - which can usually be identified by red flashing lights - that has stopped outside a built-up area to let passengers on or off.\n\nFinally, a ‘no overtaking sign’ means you cannot pass a vehicle with more than two wheels.\n\nWho has priority?\n\nTraffic from the right tends to have priority at crossroads and junctions\n\nVehicles turning left at an intersection have to give way to oncoming vehicles\n\nAll road users must give way to emergency vehicles that have blue flashing lights, even if there is no audible warning signal\n\nTraffic on a roundabout has right of way, unless otherwise indicated. Drivers must also indicate before they leave the roundabout, but they should not do it as they enter\n\nDrivers must not enter an intersection in heavy traffic unless their exit is clear. This applies even if they have priority or if the lights are green\n\nBuses and school buses have priority when leaving stops, while vehicles must give way when a bus has signalled its intention to move on\n\nWarning of approach\n\nThe use of light signals and audible warnings is allowed when overtaking outside built-up areas or in cases of danger.\n\nTowing in Germany\n\nYou can take a caravan, camper van or boat trailer into Germany.\n\nIf the caravan contains expensive or unusual items, an inventory is required.\n\nThe following dimensions for vehicles with trailers must be followed:\n\nHeight: 4m\n\nOverall width: 2.55m (1m if towed by motorcycle)\n\nOverall length: 12m\n\nLength of car + caravan: 18.75m\n\nWhen towed by a motorcycle or private car, the fully laden weight of the trailer must not exceed 750kg.\n\nCars towing a caravan must be equipped with two side rear-view mirrors. These may exceed the width of the caravan and must be foldable.\n\nGerman seat belt law\n\nIf seat belts are fitted to your car, they must be worn by the driver and passengers in both the front and rear seats. The driver has a responsibility to ensure that all passengers under 18 are suitably restrained in the car.\n\nA fine of €30 may be imposed for not wearing a seat belt.\n\nTraffic lights\n\nThe international three-colour traffic light system is used in Germany.\n\nA red light with a green arrow pointing to the right allows you to turn right on the condition that you give way to other road users and pedestrians.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle is responsible for ensuring that all children are wearing a seat belt or appropriate restraint.\n\nCar seats\n\nChildren over three years old must travel on the rear seats of vehicles. A child under 12 and measuring less than 150cm must be seated in a child seat or child restraint.\n\nWhere a child restraint/seat is not available, a child of three years and over must use a seat belt or other safety device attached to the seat. A child under three may not be transported in a vehicle without child restraint/seat.\n\nAll child restraints/seats must conform to European safety standards.\n\nA fine of €60 may be imposed (plus one point on your driving licence) for transporting an unsecured child.\n\nBike helmet law\n\nIt is not compulsory for cyclists to wear helmets in Germany.\n\nOn-the-spot fines\n\nThe German police are able to hand out on-the-spot fines of up to €55 to motorists who have been caught violating traffic regulations. The motorist must pay the fine during the following week or legal proceedings could commence.\n\nThe police can also collect amounts above €55 as a security deposit for a higher expected fine and, in such cases, legal proceedings will start.\n\nMinimum and maximum fines\n\nFines range from around €10 for a minor parking violation to more than thousands of Euros for exceeding the speed limit by over 70km/h.\n\nFor drink-driving offences, harsher penalties may apply, and your licence could be suspended.\n\nConfiscation of vehicles\n\nThe police can confiscate the vehicles of foreign motorists if they are involved in serious incidents.\n\nLegal limit\n\nThe maximum level of alcohol in the blood for private drivers is 0.05%.\n\nFor newly qualified drivers with less than two years' experience, and young drivers aged under 21, the limit is 0%.\n\nDrink-driving test\n\nThe police can ask a driver to undergo a breath test if there is a definite suspicion that they are under the influence of alcohol. The driver can refuse, but then has to have a blood test.\n\nIf a novice driver is found to have even a small amount of alcohol in their blood, the fine is €250 and two penalty points. Their probationary period is also extended by two years.\n\nGerman roads do not have tolls for private cars. However, there is a motorway tax on all vehicles (and vehicle combinations) exceeding 7.5 tonnes, which is levied by electronic means.\n\nGerman service areas\n\nThere are many service areas in Germany.\n\nAvailability of fuel\n\nUnleaded petrol, diesel and LPG are readily available throughout Germany.\n\nMost petrol stations are open from 08:00 to 20:00, and many pumps operate using credit cards. In large cities some are open 24 hours a day, while on motorways service stations are open day and night.\n\nIn larger urban centres, there is also a growing network of electric charging points.\n\nFuel prices in German can be found in our up-to-date European fuel prices page."
