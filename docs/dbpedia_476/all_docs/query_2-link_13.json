        "text": "Germany Size\n\nGermany’s Size is approximately 28 times smaller in size than the United States. Germany covers an area of approximately 137,847 square miles, while the United States is approximately 3,791,400 square miles. In terms of area, the closest states in the US are Montana, which is slightly bigger than Germany, and New Mexico, which is a bit smaller. There is also a huge difference in the population of the two countries with Germany being close to 81 million people and 319 million in the United States. While the United States comprises 50 states, Germany has 16.\n\nGermany’s Size Compared to the US\n\nWhen compared with the map of the United States, Germany is about 85% the size of California which is 163,695.7 square miles in area. On the map, Germany would stretch from Los Angeles to Redding, from north to south.\n\nGermany is Europe’s largest economy and second most populous nation. It’s a key member of Europe’s economic, political, and defense organizations. The United States is the world’s largest economy.\n\nGermany’s history has been full of struggles. Germany was involved in the two World Wars in the first half of the 20th century which left it in the hands of Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. In 1949, when the Cold War began, Germany was split into two states: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). However, Germany was unified in 1990 after the decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nIs Texas Bigger Than Germany\n\nHow Big is England compared to Texas?"
