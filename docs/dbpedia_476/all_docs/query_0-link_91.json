        "text": "Wireless RF or Bluetooth transmission – the choice is yours.\n\nWhy choose one or the other when you can have both? A switch on the keyboard and mouse lets you toggle instantly between Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connectivity. The USB receiver for 2.4 GHz wireless transmission is included in the bundle. In both cases, data is transferred with AES-128 encryption over a range of up to 10 meters.\n\nThe keyboard – stable and flexible at the same time.\n\nExcellent design and high quality go hand-in-hand with the CHERRY DW 9100 SLIM. A metal plate provides maximum strength and stability while the keyboard remains flat. In terms of flexibility, it leaves nothing to be desired. The separate, magnetic support bar can be fitted in seconds to provide a steeper typing angle. When not in use, it can be removed just as quickly.\n\nMaximum comfort – everything a keyboard needs.\n\nThe basis for the excellent typing feel of the CHERRY DW 9100 is the high-quality SX scissor mechanism. The defined and precise pressure point is similar to a laptop keyboard and is key to productivity at work. The three status LEDs integrated in the keys are also very useful. There’s no need to look whether the shift key, scroll key or Num-Lock keys are activated. These keys also flash to warn that the battery is getting low. The additional keys on the cordless keyboard have been chosen with practicality in mind. The desktop set only has the most important and frequently used keys: “Windows lock”, “Open browser”, “Volume Down”, “Volume Up”, “Mute” and “Open calculator”. This keeps the cordless keyboard tidy and is very user-friendly.\n\nThe mouse – design meets comfort.\n\nWith its numerous features and rubberised sides, the cordless mouse a worthy partner for the keyboard. The compact shape creates an ideal form for the hand that feels instantly familiar. A DPI switch lets you switch between three levels at the touch of a button: 600, 1000 or 2400 dpi. A two-color status LED provides information on the battery status, the charging status, the selected resolution or the connection status at any time. The cordless mouse, which can handle any mobile use, comes with a metal mouse wheel. It continues to scroll effortlessly throughout the day. Even the USB receiver has its own place in the mouse. A magnet keeps it secure and is always ready for use."
