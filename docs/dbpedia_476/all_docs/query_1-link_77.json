        "text": "If you’re going to be driving in Germany, it’s a good idea to get to grips with the different road signs and their meanings, before hitting the road. There are over 1.000 traffic signs in the German traffic code, including warning signs, speed limit signs and information signs.\n\nNo matter whether you’re learning to drive in Germany for the first time, need to take an exam to change your driving licence, or just need to brush up on your knowledge before coming to the federal republic for a visit, this page contains an overview of all the most important German road signs.\n\nRoad signs in Germany & Their meanings\n\nThe traffic sign system in Germany is comprehensive and uniform. All road signs in Germany have standardised shapes and colours and use easy-to-understand pictograms and symbols that conform closely to European standards. The German sign system is regularly updated to keep pace with changes in traffic and transportation; the last time it had a major overhaul was in the early 1990s.\n\nIn the official German traffic code, all signs are assigned a unique number, which is used by the police on tickets and reports if a sign is involved in an incident. Officially, signs in Germany are divided into four main categories:\n\nWarning signs\n\nRegulation signs\n\nGuide signs\n\nSupplemental signs\n\nFor ease of understanding, this page has grouped the signs slightly differently, into more logical categories. We have included the most important signs from the road sign catalogue (Verkehrszeichenkatalog) of 2017, along with some new signs from 2020.\n\nVehicle class symbols\n\nTraffic signs in Germany use a set of standard symbols to indicate the type or class of vehicle being referred to on the sign. Some symbols also include other types of vehicle as well. For instance, the “motor vehicles” symbol indicates that the sign applies not only to cars but also trucks, motor homes, buses, vehicles with trailers, and so on. Here’s an overview of these symbols, their meanings, and associated subclasses:\n\nSymbol Description Other included classes of vehicle Motor vehicles (all motorised vehicles) Passenger vehicles (cars and light trucks) Vehicles over 3,5 tonnes (includes trailers and other vehicles that do not qualify as passenger vehicles, NOT buses) Motorcycles (includes motorcycles, motorcycles with sidecars, and mopeds)\n\nThese are other vehicle class symbols:\n\nBicycles Mopeds Cargo bicycles Electric cars Electric bicycles Small electric vehicles Passenger vehicles with trailers Vehicles over 3,5\n\ntonnes with trailers Buses Motor homes Cattle / domestic animals Riders Horse-drawn vehicles Pedestrians Trams Trains Farm & Power equipment (top speed <25 km/h) Military vehicles Vehicles with hazardous cargo Vehicles carrying\n\nhazardous cargo to water bodies\n\nTraffic signs in Germany: Warning signs\n\nWarning signs give advance warning of hazards on or near the road. Warnings signs in Germany are equilateral triangles with a thick red border and white background. They usually contain an internationally-recognised black pictogram describing the danger:\n\nGeneral danger\n\nTypically used with\n\na supplementary sign\n\nto specify the danger Aircraft\n\nPedestrian crossing Cattle Riders Amphibian crossing\n\nFrogs & Toads may be in the road Falling rocks\n\nWatch out for rocks on the road; do not stop or park Ice / snow\n\nThe bridge or road ahead may be icy Loose gravel\n\nThe road surface makes sudden manoeuvring, braking or accelerating unsafe Shore / riverbank\n\nThere is an unguarded riverbank or landing ahead Insufficient clearance / Tree overhang\n\nDrivers of tall vehicles beware Moveable bridge Uncontrolled intersection ahead\n\nNo right-of-way at next intersection; yield to traffic from the right Curve Double curve Steep downgrade\n\nDegree of descent is shown Steep upgrade\n\nDegree of ascent is shown Uneven road surface\n\nReduce speed Slippery when wet or dirty Strong crosswind Road narrows Road narrows Roadworks\n\nThere may be workers, machinery or dirt on the road Congestion hazard\n\nThis area frequently has traffic jams; prepare to slow down or stop Two-way traffic\n\nOncoming traffic may be unexpected, for instance if exiting a one-way street Traffic signals ahead Pedestrians Watch for children\n\nSchools and playgrounds in the area Bicycle crossing Wild animal crossing\n\nUse dipped headlights; be prepared to brake suddenly Railway crossing\n\nGerman traffic signs: Speed limit signs\n\nSpeed limit signs in Germany state the maximum speed in kilometres per hour (km/h). The maximum speed limit sign comprising a number within a red circle will be recognisable to most road users.\n\nHowever, Germany also has a minimum speed limit sign (a blue circle), which is most commonly found on the German autobahn. Speed limits are ended with a black and white sign - meaning the statutory speed limit now applies.\n\nHere are some speed limit signs you will see in Germany:\n\nMaximum speed limit\n\nDo not exceed the stated speed limit (km/h) Speed limit zone\n\nYou are entering an area where the speed limit applies to all roads until you pass an “End of speed limit zone” sign Minimum speed limit\n\nYou must travel at this speed or faster, unless the weather, road or traffic conditions make it necessary to drive slower End of speed limit\n\nThe statutory speed limit now applies End of speed limit zone\n\nEnd of minimum speed limit\n\nMaximum speed limit by lane\n\nThe displayed speed limit only applies to the indicated lane(s) End of maximum speed limit by lane End of all restrictions\n\nEnd of all route-related speed and passing restrictions; statutory speed limit now applies Speed limit information sign\n\nMaximum (or recommended) speed limits for urban areas, federal highways and motorways\n\nRegulatory signs: Signs giving orders\n\nRegulatory signs are signs that give mandatory orders - for instance things that you should or should not do. They are orders rather than suggestions, and as such must be adhered to.\n\nLike speed limit signs, most regulatory signs in Germany are round. A red circle is prohibitive (meaning you should not do the action depicted) while a blue circle is prescriptive (meaning you should follow the action depicted). Both prohibitive and prescriptive regulatory signs are ended by a black-and-white sign (although there are some exceptions).\n\nThese are some commonly-used regulatory signs in Germany:\n\nNo passing\n\nYou may not overtake other vehicles (except bicycles, mopeds and motorcycles) No passing for vehicles over 3,5 tonnes\n\nVehicles weighing over 3,5 tonnes are not allowed to overtake other vehicles (except bicycles, mopeds and motorcycles) End of no passing zone End of no passing zone for trucks Road closed\n\nAll vehicles are prohibited; a supplemental sign may indicate exceptions Motor vehicles prohibited\n\nIncludes all multi-lane motor vehicles Vehicles over 3,5 tonnes prohibited Bicycles prohibited Mopeds prohibited Motorcycles and mopeds prohibited Riders prohibited Pedestrians prohibited Horse-drawn vehicles prohibited Cattle prohibited Buses prohibited Passenger vehicles prohibited Hazardous cargo prohibited Weight limit\n\nNo vehicles over maximum weight shown Axle weight limit\n\nNo vehicles over maximum weight on axle shown Horizontal clearance\n\nNo vehicles over maximum width shown Vertical clearance\n\nNo vehicles over maximum height shown Length restriction\n\nNo vehicle or combination of vehicles over length shown Minimum following distance\n\nVehicles over 3,5 tonnes must maintain the indicated minimum following distance Lane crossover width restriction\n\nWidth restriction is in effect for indicated lane(s) Low emissions restriction zone\n\nUsually followed by a supplemental sign (see below) End of low emissions restriction zone No U-turn Do not enter One-way street\n\nTraffic on this street must travel in the direction of the arrow Ahead only\n\nAll traffic must continue straight ahead Turn left ahead\n\nAll traffic must turn; can be left or right Ahead or turn only\n\nAll traffic must continue straight ahead or turn (can be left or right) Roundabout\n\nAll traffic must turn counter-clockwise around central island Turn left\n\nAll traffic must turn (can be left or right) Pass by on right\n\nAll traffic must pass by obstacle (can be left or right) Hard shoulder open to traffic\n\nHard shoulder can be used as a traffic lane Shoulder lane ends\n\nIf you are in the shoulder lane, you must merge End of shoulder lane\n\nDo not drive on the shoulder lane past this point Pedestrian crossing\n\nCrossing ahead where pedestrians have right of way Pedestrian path\n\nPedestrians only Pedestrian zone\n\nYou are entering an area reserved for pedestrians; applies to all streets until you pass an “End of pedestrian zone” sign End of pedestrian zone Bicycle lane\n\nBicycles only; cyclists must not use the roadway Bicycle street\n\nYou are entering a street designated for bicycles End of bicycle street Bicycle highway\n\nMarks a long-distance bicycle-only road End of bicycle highway Pedestrian & Bicycle path\n\nCombined path; both pedestrians and cyclists can use the entire path. Cyclists do not have right of way, but pedestrians must allow them to pass Pedestrian & Bicycle path\n\nDivided path; pedestrians and cyclists must keep to their designated sides Bridle path\n\nHorses only Snow chains or tyres required\n\nA speed limit of 50km/h applies Bus lane\n\nAll other vehicles prohibited Bus lane\n\nShows which lane is reserved for buses\n\nRight-of-way signs\n\nThese signs are designed to demonstrate who has right of way (priority) at a junction. If you come from a country where you drive on the left, priorities in Germany will be the opposite of what you are used to - for instance, at roundabouts you yield to traffic from the left.\n\nThese right-of-way signs are all in use in Germany:\n\nYield\n\nYou must give way to traffic on the intersecting road Stop\n\nYou must come to a complete stop and give way to traffic on the intersecting road Priority\n\nYou have right of way at the next intersection only Priority over oncoming traffic\n\nYou have right of way over oncoming traffic when the road narrows ahead Yield to oncoming traffic\n\nYou must give way to oncoming traffic when the road narrows ahead Priority road\n\nYou have right of way at all intersections on this road until cancelled by a “Yield”, “Stop” or “End of priority road” sign; parking is prohibited on this road except in built-up areas End of priority road\n\nYou must give way at subsequent intersections\n\nParking signs\n\nHere are all the signs you might see in Germany related to parking - including both prohibitive and prescriptive signs.\n\nParking prohibition signs\n\nThese signs show where parking is forbidden:\n\nNo stopping\n\nYou may not stop or stand on this side of the road No parking\n\nYou may not leave your vehicle on this side of the road for more than three minutes, except for pick-ups / drop-offs / loading / unloading Parking restriction zone\n\nYou are entering a neighbourhood where parking is restricted on all streets until you pass an “End of parking restriction zone” sign End of parking restriction zone No stopping (start)\n\nMarks the beginning of a no stopping area - no stopping to the left of this sign on this side of the street No stopping (end)\n\nMarks the end of a no stopping area - no stopping to the right of this sign on this side of the street No stopping\n\nStopping on this side of the street is prohibited in both directions No parking (start)\n\nMarks the beginning of a no parking area - no parking to the left of this sign on this side of the street No parking (end)\n\nMarks the end of a no parking area - no parking to the right of this sign on this side of the street No parking\n\nParking on this side of the street is prohibited in both directions Taxi stand\n\nReserved for taxis; other vehicles may not stop here Tow zone\n\nVehicles parked here illegally will be towed\n\nParking allowed signs\n\nThese signs demonstrate where you may park:\n\nParking area\n\nParking is permitted in this area Parking management zone\n\nYou are entering a neighbourhood where parking is for permit holders only, as indicated by the supplemental sign; this applies until you pass an “End of parking management zone” sign End of parking management zone Restricted parking\n\nYou may use a parking disc to park here for the length of time indicated Reserved parking\n\nParking for disabled permit holders only Parking garage Park & Ride Parking area (start)\n\nMarks the start of a parking area Parking area (end)\n\nMarks the end of a parking area Perpendicular parking\n\nParking spaces are perpendicular to the roadway Angle parking\n\nParking spaces are at an angle to the roadway Parking on pavement allowed\n\nCars may park half on the pavement and half on the street Parking on pavement allowed\n\nCars may park wholly on the pavement Parking on pavement allowed\n\nCars may park perpendicularly half on the pavement and half on the street Parking on pavement allowed\n\nCars may park perpendicularly and wholly on the pavement\n\nInformation & Guide signs\n\nInformation signs are the most commonly-used road signs in Germany and are generally used to provide road users with general information about the road they are using and the road ahead.\n\nDirection signs used on the Autobahn have a blue background, while signs outside built-up areas (federal highways / Bundestraẞen) have a yellow background, and signs inside built-up areas have a white background. As in other countries, signs relating to tourist attractions are on a brown background.\n\nAutobahn signs\n\nThese are signs you are most likely to see on the Autobahn:\n\nAutobahn route number Autobahn junction / exit number Autobahn entrance\n\nAutobahn traffic regulations now apply End of Autobahn\n\nAutobahn traffic regulations end Autobahn direction sign\n\nPoints towards entrance to indicated Autobahn Consolidated direction sign\n\nRoute information for all directions Autobahn entrance direction sign\n\nShows direction for Autobahn entrances ahead Autobahn detour\n\nIf Autobahn is closed, follow numbered Autobahn route (or red dot / circle) to return to next entrance Autobahn distance sign Service station\n\nNext exit has a service station Autobahn exit sign\n\nNext exit (name & number) in 1.000 metres Autobahn reminder exit sign\n\nNext exit in 500 metres Autobahn junction countdown markers\n\nLocated 300 (three stripes) / 200 (two stripes) / 100 metres (one stripe) before a junction Autobahn exit\n\nLocated just prior to the exit Autobahn exit\n\nMarks exit ramp Tunnel ahead Tunnel\n\nLength of tunnel is indicated Turn headlights on\n\nReminds drivers to switch on headlights before tunnels Turn headlights off\n\nReminds drivers to switch off headlights after tunnels Breakdown bay\n\nRoadside bay can be used in case of emergency; other uses prohibited\n\nFederal highway or main road signs\n\nIf you are driving on the federal highway (Bundesstraße), you will see some of these signs:\n\nFederal highway entrance\n\nEntry for motor vehicles capable of speeds exceeding 60 km/h only End of federal highway Federal highway route number European route number Federal highway direction sign\n\nJunction sign showing route number, direction and distance to major destinations Secondary road direction sign\n\nJunction sign showing direction and distance to major destinations Secondary road direction sign\n\nJunction sign showing direction and distance to minor destinations Advance direction sign\n\nAdvises of directions at an approaching junction Advance direction sign\n\nAdvises notice of directions and lane configurations at approaching junction Advance direction sign\n\nAdvises of directions at approaching roundabout Consolidated direction sign\n\nJunction sign showing route information for all directions Federal highway distance sign Federal highway exit sign\n\nNext exit (name) in 1.000 metres Federal highway junction countdown markers\n\nLocated 300 (three stripes) / 200 (two stripes) / 100 metres (one stripe) before a junction Federal highway exit\n\nLocated just prior to the exit Federal highway exit\n\nMarks exit ramp Federal highway exit\n\nShows an exit for local destinations Diversion sign\n\nShows detour route (being phased out) End of diversion Diversion direction sign\n\nShows detour route End of diversion Alternate route\n\nIndicates a recommended alternate route to avoid congestion End of alternate route Route for trucks Route for bicycles Layout of detour route Layout of detour route for designated vehicles\n\nIndicates type of vehicle prohibited ahead and shows detour route Complicated traffic route\n\nSpecial route to go in direction indicated\n\nSigns in urban or built-up areas\n\nIf you’re driving in an urban or built-up area (for instance in a city in Germany), you’ll see signs like these:\n\nEntering urban area\n\nUrban traffic regulations begin, including 50 km/h speed limit Leaving urban area\n\nSpeed limit returns to 100 km/h as urban traffic regulations end; distance to next town is shown Leaving urban area\n\nWhite section indicates the next town is in the same municipality Place name\n\nInformation only - no speed limit implied - used for small towns and other places of interest Local direction marker Traffic calming zone\n\nTraffic calming rules apply to all streets until you pass an “End of traffic calming zone” sign End of traffic calming zone​​​​ Pedestrian crossing patrol No through road Pedestrian underpass Pedestrian overpass Pedestrians must cross road Bus or tram stop\n\nNo parking within 15 metres of this sign. Do not overtake trams stopped to board or discharge passengers, yield to vehicles leaving stop School bus stop\n\nWatch out for children on the days and times indicated Street name sign\n\nTouristic signs\n\nOn holiday in Germany? Pay attention to these brown signs, which direct you to and give more information about tourist attractions:\n\nTourist attraction Tourist route River name\n\nShows the name of the river you are crossing Scenic area\n\nShows a scenic or tourist area near the road Tourist attraction marker\n\nShows direction to indicated tourist attraction\n\nService signs\n\nThese signs are used to give directions to services and facilities on or near the road. They are primarily used along the Autobahn. Service signs are a symbol in a white field on a blue square or rectangle:\n\nPetrol station Electric vehicle charging station Restaurant Snack bar Hotel Auto repair shop Toilet Chapel Police station Tourist information Telephone Emergency telephone First aid Motor caravan park Motor caravan and trailer park\n\nRailway crossing signs\n\nYou will find these signs around railway level crossings:\n\nRailway crossing ahead\n\nYou may not overtake between this sign and the crossing Railway crossing ~240 metres ahead Railway crossing ~160 metres ahead Railway crossing ~80 metres ahead Railway crossing (St Andrew’s cross)\n\nYou must stop if a train is approaching Electrified railway crossing\n\nTall vehicles beware; this railway crossing has electrical wires overhead\n\nSupplementary signs (Zusatzschilder)\n\nThe German road sign system also makes frequent use of supplementary signs (Zusatzschilder). These black and white rectangular or square signs are mounted below a “parent sign” (for instance, a warning sign) and are used to modify or give additional information - for instance the duration of the parent sign’s instruction, or exemptions.\n\nHere’s an overview of some more common supplementary signs in Germany - although this is not by any means an exhaustive list.\n\nDistance to the condition\n\n(Shown on the parent sign) Duration (length) of the condition Remaining duration (length) Duration (length) Ends in… metres Risk of accident Oil slick Smoke End of restriction Bicycles and residents allowed\n\nFrei is used to indicate when the condition does not apply to certain types of road users Entry only for low-emissions vehicles\n\nWith yellow or green Low Emission Zone Stickers At times shown\n\nAdditional signs & Road equipment\n\nYou may also see these common additional road signs in Germany:\n\nCustoms post Toll road\n\nMotorists must pay a toll to use this road Truck toll road\n\nTrucks must pay a toll to use this road End truck toll road Reflector guide post\n\nPosted along roadside Reflector guide post Curve markers\n\nIndicate direction of travel Obstruction marker\n\nIndicates you may pass on either side Obstruction marker\n\nIncludes flashing lights and indicates which side you must pass on Mobile lane closure board\n\nUsed to temporarily close road lanes during construction; you must pass on the side indicated Bollard\n\nPrevents unauthorised vehicle entry into pedestrian areas and bike paths Reduced clearance\n\nMarks edges of overpass or other structure with reduced vertical and / or horizontal clearance Church services\n\nGold denotes Catholic services while purple denotes Protestant services Shut off engine\n\nReminds drivers to turn off engines while stopped to reduce pollution Nature reserve School bus Construction project information Autobahn kilometre marker Self-driving car reference marker\n\nRoad markings in Germany\n\nIt is also important to pay attention to road markings in Germany, which also provide information about actions that are and are not allowed:"
