        "text": "It was an obvious gap in my education. For anyone who professes an interest in the history of Milwaukee and Wisconsin, a trip to Germany would seem mandatory.\n\nMilwaukee, after all, is the most German of America’s largest metropolitan areas, with 36% of its population reporting at least some Teutonic ancestry, and Wisconsin, with 42%, is at the top of the same demographic heap.\n\nBut our German ties go far beyond statistics. Travelers remark on how much the landscape of Germany resembles Wisconsin. Our insistence on clean streets and clean government is said to rise from German roots. Milwaukee, in particular, is supposedly an American version of Munich, with Summerfest taking the place of Oktoberfest.\n\nAnd so my wife, Sonja, and I went to southern Germany this fall. The only time we’d been in the country before was during a layover at the Frankfurt airport long enough to take the train into town and have a frankfurter for lunch. This time we drove a rental car from Frankfurt to the Austrian border by way of Munich and came back again on a more westerly route, through Stuttgart and Heidelberg.\n\nWe found much that reminded us of home. Large sections of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg — the two states that make up southern Germany — resemble central Wisconsin, right down to the cornfields, deer blinds, and roadside pumpkin stands. Dairy cattle abound — mostly Holsteins, the standard breed in Wisconsin — even though the herds are small in comparison with ours. Beer and sausage were staples nearly everywhere we stopped, and we persuaded ourselves that the people we saw on every street corner would look right at home on Water and Wisconsin.\n\nMunich, we agreed, does have some obvious parallels with Milwaukee. With a population of 1.5 million, it’s close to our metropolitan area in size. The city’s English Garden, a park that runs for three miles along the Isar River, is the counterpart of our lakefront, and just as pretty. Munich is sometimes described as a Millionen-Dorf — “village of millions” — echoing Milwaukee’s reputation as a “big small town.” And beer is just as central to life in Munich as it is in Milwaukee; you can actually buy it by the pint at the downtown McDonald’s.\n\nAlthough we noticed strong similarities, the differences, in truth, were more striking. Germany and Wisconsin are separated by an ocean, two world wars, 2,000 years of history, and a host of other factors. The population mismatch is extreme. Despite Munich’s rough parity with Milwaukee, Germany is the home of 83 million people, compared to 5.8 million Wisconsinites. At 138,000 square miles, the country has twice our land area but 14 times our population.\n\nThe landscape, too, is markedly different. Timms Hill, Wisconsin’s highest point, is a pimple compared to the Bavarian Alps, and Lake Michigan, for all its majesty, lacks the sweep of the seas on Germany’s north coast. Land use patterns are just as divergent. Strict development controls and ample farm subsidies have created razor-sharp edges between city and country in Germany, contrasting sharply with the chaotic commercial zones that sprawl away from the outskirts of our cities like cowflop on a rock. As a result, Germany has plenty of open space despite its population density.\n\nTransportation is another point of difference. Germany’s autobahns are every bit as good as our freeways (avoid the left lane if you’re low on adrenalin), but cars aren’t really necessary. Intercity trains can hit 180 miles an hour in the flat, and urban transit is so reliable that automobiles seem redundant. The 9:08 tram at our stop in Munich arrived at 9:08, and another one was 15 minutes behind. The country is also extraordinarily bike-friendly. American bikers feel lucky to have a shoulder wide enough to keep them out of the traffic lanes. Germans enjoy a network of paved paths that run for thousands of miles along highways both large and small.\n\nBut the deepest differences between Germany and Wisconsin are cultural, and they begin with age. Even the smallest German city will have an Altstadt, or “old town,” usually dating back to medieval times and not infrequently to the Roman period. Cobblestone streets, half-timber buildings, and 15-century churches seem nearly as abundant in Bavaria as Kwik Trips are in Wisconsin. The only features of comparable antiquity in our state are Indian mounds.\n\nIf Germany is a much older society, it’s also a much younger democracy. The country was ruled for centuries by royal families who seriously believed that God had given them dominion over their neighbors. Some of the country’s proudest tourist attractions are royal in origin. The nobility’s castles, country estates, and even the churches they so lavishly patronized stand as monuments to privilege built on the backs of the peasant class — grand, to be sure, but the product of savage inequities.\n\nAnd then there are the wars. We saw precious little flag-waving in southern Germany. The fact that the country was the bad guy in two world wars has had a chastening effect that persists nearly 75 years after the last conflict bled to a close. Anti-Kaiser sentiment in the United States during World War I created a yawning chasm between Germany and German Americans and Nazism finished the job. The Third Reich represented such a low point of organized barbarism that its memory remains indelible generations after Hitler’s suicide. Even the smallest American community will have a war memorial. The only one we saw in our German travels honored a hero of the Franco-Prussian War, which ended in 1871.\n\nFinally, Oktoberfest. Is Summerfest really America’s version of Munich’s extravaganza? Entirely by coincidence, we arrived in the middle of the celebration, and it was, beyond a doubt, impressive. Take an area half the size of Wisconsin State Fair Park a mile from downtown, fill its center with 16 halls the size of airplane hangars, pack those halls with benches, line the outer ring with amusement rides, and brace for 400,000 visitors a day.\n\nWhat do those visitors do? They drink, eat, and sing, in roughly that order. Every hall has a regular rotation of oompah bands, heavy on the brass. (Where have all the tubas gone? Gone to Munich, every one.) But the bands don’t play schottisches and polkas. Those you’ll find in Tradition Hall, a smaller venue near the back of the grounds whose atmosphere reminded us of the Holiday Folk Fair. In the main halls, the favored tunes are uptempo Western numbers — anything to get the crowd on its feet. We heard German covers of “Proud Mary,” “California Dreamin’,” “We Are the Champions,” and even “La Bamba.” Every 15 minutes, it seemed, the bands played the “Prosit” jingle, which ends with a cry of “Ein, Zwei, Drei, Zuffa!” (“One, Two, Three, Drink!”). There followed a general raising of one-liter glass mugs and an accelerating slide to intoxication.\n\nThat’s really about it. A large percentage of the men wear lederhosen, and there are many women in dirndl dresses but there are few other pretensions to culture, folk or otherwise. Summerfest, with its carefully curated mix of musical acts, is an art show by comparison, and the 800,000 visitors it attracts over 11 days are a tea party measured against the 6 million-plus who attend Oktoberfest during its 16-day run. Munich’s superfest is an experience well worth having — once.\n\nAlthough direct correspondences proved hard to find, there were times, particularly in the German countryside, when I felt like we’d never left Wisconsin. Rural Germany, after all, is where the bulk of our Teutonic immigrants came from in the 1800s, and attitudes they brought with them persist, however muted, 150 years later. The most familiar, which was on clear display in the bierstuben and backyards of southern Germany, is a shared fondness for the smaller pleasures of life: home and hearth, good friends, good food, and a good glass of lager. Wisconsinites know that taste for domestic tranquility by a single word: Gemütlichkeit. As generations have discovered, it translates easily into many languages.\n\nJohn Gurda writes a column on local history for the Ideas Lab on the first Sunday of every month.
