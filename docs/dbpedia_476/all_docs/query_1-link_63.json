        "text": "The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Or so many politicians in Germany’s three-party ruling coalition are now discovering.\n\nGermany's parliament is set to pass a new bill on Friday to reduce the country’s carbon footprint by mandating changes to the way Germans heat their homes and buildings.\n\nMonths of pained negotiations over the heating bill caused public infighting within Germany’s ruling coalition and sparked an unexpectedly sharp backlash across much of the country.\n\nWhile the coalition has the votes it needs to pass the law without help from opposition parties, it’s likely to prove a pyrrhic victory, with the popularity of the government now near record lows.\n\nAt the same time, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has sought to exploit dissatisfaction over the law, and political experts say it’s one cause for the party’s recent sharp rise in polls.\n\nFor these reasons, Germany’s new heating law has come to represent a cautionary tale with implications far beyond Germany. While many voters appear to support measures to reduce carbon emissions in the abstract, things get more complicated when it comes to mandates that concern something as personal as their own homes.\n\nAttacks from within and without\n\nThe new law effectively will ban new installations of oil and gas heating systems in the coming years in favor of heat pumps that rely largely on renewable energy.\n\nIt’s main advocate within Germany’s coalition government has been Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens, once the country’s most popular politician, but whose popularity has plummeted in recent months.\n\nMembers of the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), concerned about how the law would play out among their economically liberal voters, have attacked Habeck so sharply, it has at times been difficult to discern that the parties are part of the same coalition.\n\nAnd the attacks continue. \"I can understand the dissatisfaction of many people,\" Michael Kruse, the FDP's energy spokesperson, told POLITICO. The FDP, he added, had to rework the heating law “from top to bottom” in order to be able to support it.\n\n\"The reason for this is that Habeck's ministry keeps coming up with draft laws that are closer to the Greens' election program than to the coalition agreement,” Kruse said. “This is not good for our country.”\n\nNo parliamentary party, however, has railed against the law as fervently as the AfD. Alice Weidel, a party leader, has referred to the law an “prosperity annihilation in really absolute gigantic dimensions.”\n\nA cautionary tale\n\nThe German coalition’s troubles with the heating law may serve as a warning to politicians in other European Union countries.\n\nMeasures like these will be needed if EU countries are serious about maintaining the bloc’s ambitious climate targets. But seeing what’s happened in Germany, other leaders may shy away from taking similar steps.\n\nClean-energy heating systems like heat pumps can cost around €20,000 more than a classic gas boiler. Berlin has promised to reimburse Germans up to 70 percent of the cost of newly installed heat pump, depending on their income level."
