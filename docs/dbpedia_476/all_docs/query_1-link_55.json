        "text": "European Union (EU) Member States are often compared with each other, but in reality it can be difficult to contrast small countries like Luxembourg or Malta with larger ones such as France or Germany. Analysing data at a regional level can highlight disparities either across the EU or within Member States, such as an eastâwest divide in Germany or a northâsouth divide in Italy.\n\nRegions in Europe â 2022 interactive edition is a publication that presents data for 242 EU regions, as well as 16 regions of the EFTA countries . At the heart of regional statistics is the NUTS classification which is designed such that regions can be compared with each other. This classification is composed of three sub-national hierarchical levels; this interactive publication is based primarily on NUTS level 2.\n\nHave a closer look at the map to see the borders and names of the regions that are covered.\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and a range of associated containment measures at the start of 2020 had a profound and lasting impact on a wide range of social, economic and environmental issues both within the EU and further afield. At the time of writing, the pandemic is still on-going although most containment measures have been lifted. The impact of the crisis is visible for many of the indicators presented in this edition.\n\nRegions in Europe â 2022 interactive edition offers a selection of visualisations accompanied by short texts that make it possible for you to get a deeper understanding of the social, economic and environmental situation across European regions. The publication is divided into three principal sections: people and society, economic activities, the environment and natural resources.\n\nScroll down, play around with the visualisations and select information for specific regions, for example where you live, study or work â¦ or perhaps would like to live in the future."
