        "text": "Germany: land of the Autobahn, wonderful cars, precision engineering, and efficiency. With its incredible road network and breathtaking scenery, Germany is a natural choice for a road trip. But like any other country it has its unique rules and conventions when it comes to driving.\n\nLicence and documentation\n\nAll you need to drive in Germany is a full and valid UK driving licence, so donât worry about an International Driving Permit.\n\nMake sure you carry the following documents on you at all times:\n\nYour full licence\n\nYour V5C certificate to prove ownership of your car\n\nYour passport\n\nProof of insurance\n\nCompulsory equipment when driving in Germany\n\nSafety on the roads in Germany is a big deal, and there are safety items you must carry in the car at all times. These are:\n\nWarning triangle (compulsory in all vehicles with four wheels or more)\n\nReflective safety jackets\n\nFirst aid kit\n\nBeam deflectors\n\nSafety helmet if riding a motorcycle\n\nIf youâre driving where there may be snow or ice then you can either have winter tires fitted or carry snow chains. Although they arenât compulsory, just be aware that if you have an accident in snowy conditions and donât have either, then you are automatically considered partially to blame for the accident.\n\nDriving rules in Germany\n\nThe following isnât an exhaustive list of rules and regulations, but these are the most important ones to stick to.\n\nSpeed limits\n\nUnless there are signs stating otherwise, the following speed limits apply when driving in Germany:\n\nMotorways â 130 km/h\n\nMain roads - 100 km/h\n\nUrban areas â 50 km/h\n\nMany parts of the Autobahn have no speed limit, which is indicated by a circular white sign with five diagonal black lines. You can drive as fast as you feel safe, but just be aware that cars can appear suddenly behind you, so take extra care when overtaking.\n\nIf you are towing a caravan or trailer you have to display a 100 km/h sticker at all times.\n\nTraffic lights\n\nThe three-colour light system is in use. However, a red light with a green arrow pointing right allows motorists to turn right at a red light if they give way to other drivers and pedestrians.\n\nAt railway crossings a red flashing light means that a train is approaching, and all traffic must stop until the train has passed and the lights cease flashing.\n\nAlcohol consumption\n\nAlthough Germans love their beer, which is some of the finest in the world, they prize responsibility. Drink driving restrictions are even tighter than in the UK with a maximum level of blood alcohol volume of 0.05%. But there is a zero tolerance rule in effect for drivers who have less than two years experience or are under 21.\n\nPolice can request a breath test if they pull you over and suspect you are driving under the influence. If you refuse, youâll have to take a blood test.\n\nSeatbelts and child safety\n\nSeatbelts must be worn at all times by both the driver and passengers. Failure to do so while driving in Germany will result in a fine.\n\nIf youâve got children with you, then remember:\n\nChildren aged under three cannot travel without a child seat.\n\nChildren aged three or over must travel in the rear seats.\n\nAny child under the age of 12 and less than 1.5m tall must use a child seat or restraint.\n\nIf a child seat or restraint is not available, and the child is over three, they may use a standard seatbelt.\n\nAll child seats and safety equipment must conform to European standards.\n\nPriority on the road\n\nPriority on the road is a bit different in Germany:\n\nTraffic coming from the right takes priority at all crossroads and junctions.\n\nVehicles on a roundabout have right of way, unless signs indicate they donât.\n\nDo not indicate when you enter a roundabout, only when about to exit.\n\nAny emergency vehicle that has flashing lights has priority, even if there is no siren.\n\nOvertaking\n\nIn Germany the sign that indicates âno overtakingâ means you cannot overtake a vehicle with more than two wheels. So if youâre in a car then feel free to overtake a motorbike, but donât overtake a car, lorry or other four-wheeled vehicle.\n\nIf two or more lanes are travelling in the same direction and traffic has built up it is OK to overtake on the inside.\n\nA lot of German towns and cities have tram networks and these need special consideration. When in motion on a two-way street, trams must be overtaken on the right, unless space is inadequate in which case they may be overtaken on the left. On a one-way street trams can be overtaken on either side.\n\nTowing\n\nIf you are taking a caravan or trailer with you when driving in Germany remember the following guidelines:\n\nYour car must be equipped with side rear-view mirrors. These may exceed the width of the caravan, but must be foldable.\n\nThe towed item cannot exceed 4 metres in height.\n\nThe towed item cannot exceed 12 metres in length.\n\nThe towed item cannot exceed 2.5 metres in width.\n\nThe total length of vehicle and towed item cannot exceed 18.75m.\n\nIf towing an item with a motorcycle the overall width cannot exceed 1m.\n\nParking\n\nYouâll no doubt need to park up during your trip, and you donât want to fall foul of Germanyâs parking regulations. If you are hit with an on-the-spot fine and cannot (or refuse to) pay, then your vehicle can be confiscated.\n\nIn Germany a vehicle is considered parked if it is stationary for more than three minutes. You are not permitted to park in the following circumstances:\n\nWithin 10m of traffic lights\n\nCloser than 5m to pedestrian crossings and intersections\n\nCloser than 15m to a bus stop or other public vehicle area\n\nBy the kerbside facing oncoming traffic\n\nBlocking entry to buildings, or on the opposite side of the street from an entrance if this makes the road too narrow for vehicles to access\n\nAt any place marked with a parking prohibited sign\n\nOn a bike lane\n\nNext to a traffic island"
