        "text": "What is girth?\n\nGirth measurement\n\nWhen couriers talk about the girth of a parcel, they are referring to the measurement around the middle of your package, this is the girth measurement. You might also call this the circumference.\n\nWhen booking a parcel delivery service, you may be asked for the combined length and girth of your package, so it's useful to know what this is.\n\nLength and Girth Calculator\n\nWork out the combined length and girth of your parcel quickly and easily using our Length and Girth Calculator below. Just enter your parcel's dimensions and we'll do the maths for you!\n\nCalculating combined length and girth\n\nYou can find the combined length and girth of your parcel quickly and easily using our Length and Girth Calculator, but to give you an idea of how length and girth is calculated, we've put together this simple guide:\n\nHow to calculate girth\n\nTo calculate the girth of your parcel, first measure the length (the longest side), width and height. The calculation for working out girth is:\n\nWidth + Height x 2\n\nFor example, if you had a box that measures 20cm x 10cm x 10cm. The calculation would be: 10 + 10 = 20 x 2. The girth would be 40cm.\n\nLength and girth\n\nOnce you know the girth of your parcel, it's easy to get the final combined length and girth measurement. The calculation for working out the combined length and girth of your parcel is:\n\nGirth + Length\n\nSo, if the girth is 40cm and the length is 20cm the combined length and girth = 60cm\n\nWhy is parcel length and girth important?\n\nThe girth measurement, combined with the length, may be used when calculating the cost of sending your parcel, as many couriers have a maximum girth + length limit for particular services.\n\nFor example, Royal Mail’s Large Parcel size states that the combined length + girth must be no more than 300cm. Anything larger than this will have to be sent via Parcelforce and therefore different prices will apply.\n\nGet a parcel quote\n\nUsing our courier quote tool, you won’t need to know the girth of your parcel to get a price. Simply package your item and enter the weight and dimensions into our quote form for an instant quote.\n\nRelated help pages:\n\nHow to calculate volumetric weight\n\nParcel weight and size limits\n\nLarge parcel delivery services\n\nLong parcel delivery services\n\nSmall parcel delivery services"
