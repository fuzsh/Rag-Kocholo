        "text": "Germany, situated in Central Europe, covers a total area of approximately 357,022 km2 (about 137,847 mi2). This country shares its borders with nine countries: Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The Baltic Sea and the North Sea form the northern maritime borders.\n\nThe geography of Germany generally consists of four regions: the North German Plain, the Central Uplands, the Southern German Scarplands, and the Bavarian Alps.The North German Plain is a flat, low-lying area that extends from the country's northern coastline to as far south as the foothills of the Central Uplands; it is a small segment of the North European Plain. The region displays a range of terrain, from sandy beaches and marshlands along the coast to fertile farmlands more centrally located. The North German Plain also incorporates major urban centers, including Hamburg and Berlin.\n\nThe Central Uplands: To the south of the North German Plain lies the Central Uplands, which are essentially a collection of several low mountain ranges. The Harz Mountains, the Thuringian Forest, the Black Forest, the Ore Mountains, and the Schwäbische Alb are among the most notable features of this region. The Central Uplands offer an undulating terrain, interspersed with forests, valleys, and rivers. The region forms a watershed divide between the major river systems of Germany, namely the Rhine and Elbe.\n\nThe Southern German Scarplands, which encompass the Swabian and Franconian Jura, as well as the Bavarian Plateau, occupy the region south of the Central Uplands. This geographical region, featuring Jurassic limestone plateaus, is characterized by its stepped topography, rolling hills, and extensive forests.\n\nThe Bavarian Alps: On the extreme southern edge of the country lie the Bavarian Alps, part of the greater European Alps range. The Zugspitze, the highest peak in Germany at 2,962 meters (about 9,718 feet), resides here. These mountains, renowned for their snow-covered peaks and glacial valleys, are a significant part of Germany's geographical profile.\n\nBodies of Water: The North Sea and the Baltic Seas, connected by the Kiel Canal, serve as important waterways for international shipping in and around Germany. In the interior, Lake Constance is the largest freshwater lake, bordering Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Lake Müritz is another notable body of water, being the largest lake entirely within Germany's borders.\n\nRivers: The most substantial rivers in Germany are the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Danube. The Rhine, the longest river in Germany, originates in the Swiss Alps and meanders northwards, and the upper Rhine portion forms a natural border with France before flowing through western Germany and into the North Sea. The Elbe, flowing from the Czech Republic through eastern Germany, also empties into the North Sea. The Danube, the second-longest river in Europe, rises in the Black Forest of southwest Germany and flows eastwards across multiple countries before reaching the Black Sea."
