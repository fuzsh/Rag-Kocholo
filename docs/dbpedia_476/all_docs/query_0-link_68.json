        "text": "The specification for Code 128 (ISO/IEC 15417) leaves the maximum length undefined and states that this is something that should be defined by any derivative application[*] standard:\n\n4.7.1 Symbology and data characteristics\n\nApplication specifications should consider the following parameters.\n\nb) The number of data characters in the symbol, which may be fixed, variable or variable up to a defined maximum.\n\nFor example the GS1 General Specification define that GS1-128 (the formal application of Code 128 to the supply chain industry) has a limits of 48 characters per symbol:\n\n5.4.1 GS1-128 Bar Code Symbol size characteristics:\n\nThe characteristics of the GS1-128 Symbology are:\n\nGS1-128 Bar Code Symbol size characteristics:\n\nThe maximum number of data characters in a single symbol is 48.\n\nPractically one should restrict the number of characters to whatever fits comfortably in a scanner's field of view. This will vary depending on the type and model of the device, e.g. handheld vs fixed, laser vs CCD, high-end vs budget, etc. In uncontrolled or open environments a high degree of tolerance should be budgeted for.\n\nIt is especially worth noting that Code 128 supports double-density compression of numeric data (\"mode C\") which makes encoding long strings of digits much more efficient.\n\nHere is a 44-digit Code 128 containing 12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234:\n\nThis is appropriately sized for most practical applications.\n\nHowever, here is the same Code 128 this time containing 44 alpha characters ABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCD:\n\nA barcode of this size will not be useful in as many applications since reading this reliably would require a scanner with a high resolution and wide field-of-view.\n\nSo ultimately the maximum length of a Code 128 is dependant not only on the practical constraints of the application but also the type of data to be encoded."
