The external flow through heater reduces the influence of external vibrations and ensures a constant temperature. Every accessory that comes into contact with the dissolution sample is installed in Germany. Therefore our DT light Series has the ERWEKA made in Germany quality.\n\nAll these features make sure that the ERWEKA DT light Series offers the perfect entry-level devices for the world of dissolution testing."
