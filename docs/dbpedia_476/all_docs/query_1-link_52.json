        "text": "Summary\n\nInformation about the 184km long Rhine in France\n\nThe Rhine has its sources in the Swiss Alps southwest of Chur. Passing through Lake Constance, it retains its alpine character along the Swiss-German border down to the Basle region, where navigation begins at Rheinfelden. Just below the busy inland port of Basle the river leaves Switzerland and forms the French-German border over a distance of 184km, down to Lauterbourg. The Rhine then runs north and northwest through Germany and the Netherlands to discharge into the North Sea, 1320km from its source. The Upper Rhine (from Basle down to Bingen in Germany) has always been a difficult and often a dangerous river to navigate. Large-scale channel improvements were carried out between 1840 and 1860, but they had the effect of increasing the current speed and bed erosion. A meandering channel formed within the corrected 250m-wide bed and rocky bars were gradually exposed, the most notorious being at Istein near Kembs. Further works were required, to fix the channel by means of transverse groynes, but Basle was still only accessible to 600-tonne barges under favourable conditions. A more effective solution for navigation was already being envisaged before the 1914-1918 war. This was the construction of a canal stretching down the left bank from Basle to Strasbourg, the Grand Canal d’Alsace, designed as a series of hydroelectric power schemes, with benefits for agriculture as well as navigation. France was authorised to undertake the project under the the Treaty of Versailles and the works were conceded to Electricité de France. The first section of the canal, avoiding the Istein bar, was opened in 1932. By 1956 three further schemes had been completed. The project was then modified under a new agreement between the French and German governments, to limit the serious environmental impact on the Rhine itself. Subsequent schemes took the form of diversion canals of varying length, with a dam on the Rhine and power station and locks towards the downstream end of the canal. In the 1970s two further schemes were completed downstream of Strasbourg. As a result, the Rhine is canalised almost throughout its course on the French border.\n\nDistances on the river are counted from the Rheinbrücke at Constance (under international agreement). The distance table here covers the section of the river shared by France between PK 168.5 and PK 352.1. The right-hand column gives distances working upstream from the French-German border at Lauterbourg. The Grand Canal d’Alsace extends over a distance of 53km, from PK 173.6 to km 226.6.\n\nThere are connections with the Canal du Rhône au Rhin, Niffer branch, at Niffer (PK 185), with the Canal de Colmar (formerly a branch of the Canal du Rhône au Rhin) at PK 226, with the Canal du Rhône au Rhin, northern branch at PK 257.9 and with the Canal de la Marne au Rhin at Strasbourg (PK 291 or 295, see plan).\n\nHistory – Canalisation of the Rhine for hydropower and navigation was authorised under the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 for the exclusive benefit of France. The twin Kembs locks, built in the 1930s, were 182.50 by 25 m and 100 by 25m. After World War II, construction of the Grand Canal d’Alsace continued, until pressure from Germany, supported by environmental studies, called for a change in design. Subsequent schemes, with locks 185 by 12m and 185 by 23m (later widened to 24 m), were built on diversion canals. Below Strasbourg, the locks built in the 1970s at Gambsheim (on the French side) and Iffezheim (on the German side) each have two identical chambers 270m by 24 m.\n\nEssentials\n\nKey Waterway Dimensions\n\nMax Beam: 12m\n\nMax Height: 7m\n\nMax Draught: 2.70m\n\nNavigation\n\nThe Rhine is a challenging fast-flowing river from the German border up to Iffezheim lock. The winding channel, the ferries, the current and the incessant traffic all require constant attention. From Iffezheim upstream to Basle the dams and locks make the river easy to navigate, but it is forbidden to hire boats. Fast currents will also be encountered on the approach to the Swiss border and the port of Basle. The blue flag protocol applies on the Rhine, allowing craft to pass starboard to starboard instead of port to port, so that upstream craft can choose the inside of bends where the current is not so strong. Smaller craft do not display a blue flag, but should of course be out of the main channel and attentive to what may be incorrectly interpreted as erratic zigzagging by commercial traffic.\n\nLocks – There are 10 locks, all built as part of important hydroelectric power schemes. The first four are on the Grand Canal d’Alsace, the remaining six on diversion canals. Each lock comprises two chambers side by side, one 185 by 24m, the other 185 by 12m. In view of the heavier traffic downstream of the busy port of Strasbourg (12 million tonnes per year), the two locks added in the 1970s and early 1980s, at Gambsheim and Iffezheim, each have two 270 by 24m chambers.\n\nDraught – There is a guaranteed draught of 3.00m between Huningue and the downstream end of the Grand Canal d’Alsace. On the canalised river the available draught at the normal stage of the river is 2.70m down to Strasbourg and 2.90m between Strasbourg and Lauterbourg.\n\nHeadroom – All the fixed bridges offer a clear headroom of 7.00m above the highest navigable water level between Basle and Strasbourg, 9.10m between Strasbourg and Lauterbourg.\n\nAuthority – VNF – Direction interrégionale de Strasbourg\n\n– 60 rue du Grillenbreit, BP 40545, 68021 Colmar (PK 168-258)\n\n– 2, route de l’Ill, BP 19, 67761 Gambsheim cedex (PK 258-352)"
