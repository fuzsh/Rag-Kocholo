        "text": "METEOR is Germany's third largest research vessel and is used for basic research in a number of scientific disciplines, including the study of the atmosphere, the water column, marine organisms and the ocean floor. The METEOR accommodates 28 research personnel and operates in the Atlantic, the eastern Pacific, the West Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe METEOR is the property of the Federal Republic of Germany, represented by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), which financed the building of the vessel. Operating costs are financed 70:30 by the DFG and the BMBF. The Review Panel for German Research Vessels (GPF), set up by the BMBF and the DFG, uses scientific criteria to decide which cruise proposals will be included in the cruise planning. The operation of the vessel is managed by the German Research Fleet Coordination Centre at the University of Hamburg.\n\nBy funding the research vessels as central research facilities, the DFG ensures a fair distribution of ship time according to scientific quality criteria. The METEOR, like the MARIA S. MERIAN, is available to all marine researchers in Germany in accordance with generally accepted rules.\n\nAdvisory Board\n\nThe Advisory Board of the METEOR deals with questions about the scientific utilization of the vessel and questions relating to its operation. In particular, it appraises the annual budget and decides on issues of ship deployment in special circumstances, taking into consideration the various interest groups.\n\nAppointed scientific members:\n\nHans Burchard, Rostock\n\nKatrin Linse, Cambridge\n\nBettar Ould El Moctar, Duisburg\n\nKarin Sigloch, Sophia Antipolis\n\nEx-officio members:\n\nVolker Kabott, Federal Ministry of Education and Research\n\nKristian Sudmann, DFG\n\nPermanent guests:\n\nChristian Betzler, German Research Fleet Coordination Centre, University of Hamburg\n\nTom Gobien, Finance and Accounting Department, University of Hamburg\n\nFurther Information"
