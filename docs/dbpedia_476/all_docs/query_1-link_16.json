        "text": "Our current work\n\nOur work focuses on building a deeper understanding of the current moment in German society – what can bring us together and what is driving us apart. We use methodologies drawn from a range of disciplines including social psychology and behavioral science, and tested by More in Common in other national contexts. To find out where we stand as a society in Germany, and the direction we are travelling in, we surveyed more than 4,000 people in 2019. Our report \"Fault Lines: Germany’s Invisible Divides\" offers a different perspective on German society and thereby facilitates new approaches to social cohesion. After launching the report, we disseminated the findings to civil society partnerships, political actors, and other organizations.\n\nTo further deepen understanding we developed a toolkit“Understanding Society - Changing Perspectives” based on the report. With the toolkit, users get to know the sixsegments from our research in a playful way and better understand the different perspectives. Practical methods and insights from the field of communication are used to challenge preconceived ideas.\n\nTo understand social connections, it is important to also recognize the physical space where this happens. With our pilot project on the public sphere we aim to identify the places that have the greatest potential for creating connections across divides. With a specific focus on the public sphere and \"micro publics\" (everyday places such as libraries, fitness centers, or the public transport), we are creating a new evidence base for civil society work.\n\nWe also seek to find new common ground in the German climate debate and build upon our success in this sphere. We are conducting comprehensive quantitative and qualitative research on people’s climate-related values, attitudes and expectations – and are using these fresh insights in trainings and briefings to help civil society actors engage with all parts of the German population in a constructive and inclusive way that focuses on successful collective action.\n\nOur work in Germany would not be possible without the support of the European Climate Foundation, Social Change Initiative, Open Society Initiative For Europe, Schöpflin Foundation, Mercator Foundation, the Bosch Foundation, and the many supporters and advisers who share our vision and contribute their ideas and feedback. Thank you!\n\nMore in Common Germany takes the form of an eingetragener Verein (e.V.) and is recognized as a charitable entity (gemeinnützig) registered with the Amtsgericht Charlottenburg, with a team based in Berlin."
