        "text": "Capital Projects Database\n\nDCP’s Capital Projects Database (CPDB) provides data users with information on current and future capital projects taking place in NYC that are reported in the Capital Commitment Plan. A “capital project” involves the construction, reconstruction, acquisition, or installation of a physical public improvement with a value of $50,000 or more and a “useful life” of at least five years (three years for Information Technology projects). This encompasses spending on physical public works projects, such as roads, sewers, and bridges, as well as investments in core information and technology infrastructure, and critical equipment, like fire trucks. It does not include spending on programs, such as after school funding or community engagement projects.\n\nRelease...........24pre\n\nDate of Data.......May 2024\n\nFacilities Database\n\nThe Department of City Planning aggregates information about 30,000+ facilities and program sites that are owned, operated, funded, licensed, or certified by a City, State, or Federal agency in the City of New York into a central database called the City Planning Facilities Database (FacDB). These facilities generally help to shape quality of life in the city’s neighborhoods, and this dataset is the basis for a series of planning activities. This public data resource allows all New Yorkers to understand the breadth of government resources in their neighborhoods. The data is also complemented with a new interactive web map that enables users to easily filter the data for their needs. Users are strongly encouraged to read the database documentation, particularly with regard to analytical limitations.\n\nQuestions about this database can be directed to dcpopendata@planning.nyc.gov'.\n\nRelease........... 24v1\n\nDate of Data....... May 2024\n\nDCP Housing Database: Project-Level Files\n\nThe NYC Department of City Planning’s (DCP) Housing Database Project-Level Files contain all NYC Department of Buildings (DOB)-approved housing construction and demolition jobs filed or completed in NYC since January 1, 2010. It includes the three primary construction job types that add or remove residential units:new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions, and can be used to determine the change in legal housing units across time and space. Records in the Housing Database Project-Level Files are geocoded to the greatest level of precision possible, subject to numerous quality assurance and control checks, recoded for usability, and joined to other housing data sources relevant to city planners and analysts.\n\nData are updated semiannually, at the end of the second and fourth quarters of each year.\n\nPlease see DCP’s annual Housing Production Snapshot summarizing findings from the 22Q4 data release here. Additional Housing and Economic analyses are also available.\n\nAdditional documentation is available on GitHub.\n\nRelease............. 23Q4\n\nDate of Data...... December 31, 2023\n\nDCP Housing Database: Unit Change Summary Files\n\nThe NYC Department of City Planning’s (DCP) Housing Database Unit Change Summary Files provide the net change in Class A housing units since the 2010 and the count of units pending completion for commonly used political and statistical boundaries. These tables are aggregated from the DCP Housing Database Project-Level Files, which is derived from Department of Buildings (DOB)-approved housing construction and demolition jobs filed or completed in NYC since January 1, 2010. Net housing unit change is calculated as the sum of the three primary construction job types that add or remove residential units: new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions. These files can be used to determine the change in legal housing units across time and space.\n\nData are updated semiannually, at the end of the second and fourth quarters of each year.\n\nPlease see DCP’s annual Housing Production Snapshot summarizing findings from the 22Q4 data release here. Additional Housing and Economic analyses are also available.\n\nAdditional documentation is available on GitHub.\n\nRelease............. 23Q2\n\nDate of Data...... June 30, 2023\n\nCommunity Development Block Grant (CDBG) Eligibility by Census Tract\n\nCommunity Development Block Grant (CDBG) eligible and ineligible census tracts. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires local municipalities that receive CDBG formula entitlement funds to use the 2011-2015 ACS LMISD data file to determine where CDBG funds may be used for activities that are available to all the residents in a particular area. A CD-eligible census tract refers to 2010 census tracts where the area is primarily residential and at least 51.0% of the residents are low- and moderate-income as per the LMISD data file. For New York City, a primarily residential area is defined as one where at least 50.0% of the total built floor area is residential as determined by PLUTO 18v2.1. Low- and moderate-income persons are defined as persons living in households with incomes below 80 percent of the area median household income (AMI). The New York Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area's AMI was $70,300 for a 4-person family at the release of the 2011-2015 American Community Survey.\n\nRelease............. June 2019\n\nDate of Data..... June 2019\n\nBuilding Elevation and Subgrade\n\nThe Building Elevation and Subgrade data contains New York City building centroids derived from the Department of Building's (DOB) February 26th, 2022 building footprint dataset. Each record contains a grade and first floor measurement for each building (recorded as feet above sea-level in the NADV88 vertical datum) and indicates if subgrade space exists. DCP contracted with an external data vendor to generate a single point, or centroid, that represented the location of the center of every building recorded in the DOB dataset. The dataset excluded the footprints of small accessory buildings such as sheds. Each row within the dataset represents one building centroid, and records the X and Y coordinates of that centroid in the NAD 1983 coordinate system.\n\nRelease............. September 2023\n\nDate of Data...... March 2023"
