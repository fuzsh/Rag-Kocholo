        "text": "When it comes to shopping for exceptional writing tools, paper is often overlooked. Flashy pens with gold nibs and colorful, sparkly inks tend to steal the spotlight. Yet, paper is the foundation for you to build your creative work upon. It has to accommodate your work habits, space, and tools. That is why, much like the various sizes and shapes of pens, there are many notebook sizes to choose from.\n\nIn this article, we hope to help you decide which notebook paper size will be a perfect fit for your creative pursuits.\n\nHow the A series notebooks work\n\nAdopted in Europe in the 19th Century, A-series paper is the most common size used in English-speaking countries around the world. Its sizing is based on the international paper standard ISO 216 with an aspect ratio of the square root of two. This means you can take the next largest size A series paper, fold it in half, and get the next size smaller. For example, an A4 sheet of paper can be folded in half to make an A5 size booklet.\n\nHow the B series notebooks work\n\nB series paper sizes are less common with some special applications. B7 is equal to the passport size ID-3. B5 is also a common choice for books. The sizing of B-series sheets is calculated from the geometric mean of the A-series. For example, a B5 sheet is sized between an A4 and A5 sheet.\n\nAs you can see from the graphic of stacked notebooks above, the B-sized notebooks are arranged in between the A-sized pads to provide a smoother transition from largest to smallest. Having both A and B-sized papers allow for a fine-tuned selection based on your creative intentions and work habits, especially when considering the best fountain pen notebooks for your needs.\n\nWhile we have suggested several uses for each notebook size, we encourage you to be creative and know that these are not hard-and-fast rules. If you enjoy writing a novel in pocket-sized A6 notebooks, by all means, do it. If it fits your workflow perfectly, no one can argue.\n\nFor reference, here are all the notebook size dimensions in inches and millimeters for the most common A-series, B-series, and North American conventions.\n\nUltimately, no one expects to find the one greatest notebook size, regardless of how much research one might delve into beforehand. It's a trial and error process that involves trying out one particular size, living in it for a stretch of time, and seeing how it works with your flow. If the size doesn't fit your creative habits (i.e. it's too big to carry in your pants pocket, too small for your large, loopy handwriting, or too cumbersome to carry in your bag. Thankfully, there are so many options available. If one size doesn't work, you can try a larger/smaller size to better suit your needs.\n\nAlso, who expects to only use one notebook all day long? Try purchasing an assortment of sizes - let's say an A7 passport, a B5, and an A4 - and set them to use for specific tasks. You could carry the A7 around with you during walks and commuting. The B5 could be at your work desk to plan your day. The A4 could be for drawing, calligraphy practice, and other artistic pursuits.\n\nHowever you decide to use your notebooks, we hope that this guide will help you find the size that fits comfortably and allows you to be more creative and productive than ever before.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Different Sized Notebooks & Paper\n\nWhat Is The History Of Notebooks?\n\nThe history of notebooks is over 2000 years old from 100 B.C. when paper was invented in China.

Eventually we got to the A size notebooks and B size notebooks we know and love today.\n\nWhat Is Legal Paper Sized Notebooks?\n\nLegal paper is slightly wider and two inches taller than A4 sized notebooks.
