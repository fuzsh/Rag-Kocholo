        "text": "Say goodbye to the frustration of buying clothes that don’t fit with this international size conversion chart. Whether you’re shopping online or in-store, below is a US, Europe, and Australian size conversion chart for children of all ages.\n\nInternational size conversion chart for children’s clothing\n\nThese sizes are applicable to both boys and girls as they grow to similar sizes until teenage.\n\nSize conversion chart for tops or T-shirts\n\nInternational size conversion chart for pants, jeans, bottoms\n\nHow different countries measure children’s clothing sizes.\n\nThe United States, the UK, and Australia use age-based sizes for children’s clothing. This is typically represented by standard sizes such as newborn, 0-3 months, 3-6 months, and so on. Australian sizes start with 00000 while the child is under 1 year age.\n\nEuropean countries measure children’s clothing using height-based sizing. This is typically represented by metric measurements such as 50 cm for newborns, 50-56 cm for 0-3 months, 56-62 cm for 3-6 months, and so on.\n\nChildren’s US size to height and weight measurements\n\nBelow is a size chart for reference on how the clothing size pairs with the height and weight of the child.\n\nChildren’s Clothing Size Categories\n\nThese are the sizing categories you will typically see in the US:\n\nBaby (Preemie, 0-24 months)\n\nToddler (2T-6T)\n\nLittle Kid (4-6X)\n\nBig Kid or Tween (7-16)\n\nHere’s how the size categories are measured in weight and height.\n\nThis app was super useful for setting up size charts for a wide variety of different product types in our store. Our previous app was tag-based, which was not sustainable for our company. Kiwi uses condition-based product matching which is super easy and logical to set up; now we can leave everything be and new products will automatically have size charts with no extra work.\n\nCKS Online\n\nHow to use size conversion charts?\n\nUsing these conversion charts is easy.\n\nFirst, take the size that your child wears in one country and compare it to the sizing chart of another country.\n\nIf your child wears a size 12 in the US, you can look at the chart and find the corresponding size in the UK, European, and Australian sizing measurements. In this case, the size 12 in the US would be equivalent to the size 11-12 in the UK, size 146-152 cm in European measurements, and size 12 in Australia.\n\nAfter finding the corresponding size in the other countries, you can then use that information to help you determine what size clothing to purchase for your child.\n\nTips for perfectly fitting clothes for your child\n\nMeasure your child: Use a flexible tape measure and verify the height and waist of your child. This needs to be done at regular intervals since kids grow really quickly.\n\nCheck the brand’s size chart: Always check the size chart provided by the clothing manufacturer. Each brand and each style of clothing may fit differently, so it’s important to compare your child’s measurements to the chart to find the right size.\n\nConsider the room for growth: Children grow quickly, so keep this in mind when shopping for clothes. Consider buying slightly bigger clothes to ensure they last longer.\n\nLook for adjustable waistbands: Adjustable waistbands can be helpful in getting clothes to fit well, even if your child is between sizes. This can also help to extend the life of the clothes.\n\nDon’t ignore style: Different styles can have varying sizes or fittings. For example, slim-fitting clothes may run smaller than standard sizes.\n\nHow to measure children’s t-shirts?\n\nLay your kid’s existing, well-fitting t-shirt flat on a surface.\n\nMeasure from the highest point of the shoulder (where the seam meets the collar) to the bottom of the shirt. This is called the torso length.\n\nMeasure from one end of the sleeve (at the seam) to the other end of the sleeve (at the seam).\n\nMeasure across the chest from armpit to armpit.\n\nMeasure from the top of the shoulder (at the seam) to the end of the cuff.\n\nWe’ve covered the steps to measure t-shirts in detail in another article.\n\nFAQs for children’s clothing sizes\n\nFinding it difficult to convert the sizes using the above chart? Here are a few of the common questions asked by our readers about sizing for children’s clothes\n\nLooking for children’s clothing size charts for your store?\n\nWhile images may work fine, people are using their mobile phones to shop more often than computers. And image size charts can be frustrating to zoom in, scroll around, and find the right size.\n\nInstead, give your customers the perfect-sized clothing the first time. With Kiwi’s interactive size charts with unit conversion so no matter what sizing units your customers prefer, the size chart can deliver.\n\nKiwi also offers an AI size recommender that asks the buyers a few questions and suggests the best size for them automatically. If you want to reduce returns, offer the perfect size right in the first sale."
