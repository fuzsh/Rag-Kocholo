        "text": "Physiography\n\nThe western and central European section of the plain covers all of western and northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, southern Scandinavia, northern Germany, and nearly all of Poland; from northern France and Belgium eastward it commonly is called the North European Plain. In the east the plain generally is called the East European, or Russian, Plain.\n\nConditions in the North European Plain are complex in detail. The terrain is flat or gently undulating. Most of the area was glaciated several times during the Pleistocene Epoch (i.e., about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago), and the landscape is typically postglacial. Drainage is poorly developed, glacial deposits called moraine blanket much of the area, and large sections are underlain by glacial outwash plains. Hilly terminal moraines, marking the stationary edges of the Pleistocene ice sheets, are strewn in great arcs across northern Germany and Poland and into Belarus (Belorussia) and western Russia. Interspersed with these moraines are long parallel spillways where glacial meltwaters flowed to the sea parallel to the ice front. These spillways were covered with sand and gravel by the rushing glacial streams. Today they are occupied by flat, poorly drained wetlands that are relatively unproductive. Sandy duneland borders the North and Baltic seas, and extensive windblown loess deposits, resulting from the intense wind erosion of the barren interglacial and postglacial landscapes, stretch across the North European Plain from France to western Russia.\n\nOther landforms in the North European Plain include the extensive delta plain of the Netherlands that is formed by the deposits of the Rhine River as it enters the North Sea. Like many other delta plains, this area has rich and fertile soils and a flat terrain that is favourable for agriculture where it is properly drained. The Rhine has historically provided excellent transportation, and the region is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.\n\nExtending from eastern Poland to the Urals, the East European Plain encompasses all of the Baltic states and Belarus, nearly all of Ukraine, and much of the European portion of Russia and reaches north into Finland. Finland in the northwest is underlain by ancient, resistant, crystalline rocks, part of the Precambrian Baltic Shield. Because it was near the origin of the Pleistocene ice sheets that advanced southward over continental Europe, Finland’s landscape is characterized more by glacial erosion than by glacial deposition. With its numerous lakes and swamps caused by the disarranged and immature drainage pattern, together with its thin soils and coniferous forests, the Finnish plain is similar in character and appearance to northern and eastern Canada, another heavily glaciated Precambrian Shield area. The continental glaciers that planed, eroded, and polished the rock surfaces in Finland deposited part of the material over the plains to the south.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

At various times in its history, however, this area has slipped beneath the sea and been covered with sedimentary rocks. These rocks have been mildly bent and warped, but nowhere have they been sharply deformed. Consequently, the whole area from the Black Sea to the Arctic is one uninterrupted plain, everywhere below 1,500 feet (450 metres) in elevation.\n\nDrainage\n\nThe Garonne and the Loire rivers, with their numerous tributaries, drain much of western France before they enter the Bay of Biscay, and the Seine crosses the broad synclinal lowland of the Paris Basin on its way to the English Channel. The Schelde (Scheldt) and its affluents (Lys, Scarpe, Dender, Demer) drain the Plain of Flanders and the low plateaus of central Belgium. The Meuse (Maas) pursues a varied course through the scarp lands of Lorraine, crosses the Ardennes in a valley cut transversely to the structure, turns at right angles along the coal furrow of southern Belgium, and then in a sweeping curve flows across the plain of the southern Netherlands to form a joint floodplain with the lower Rhine.\n\nThe Rhine is the main river of west central Europe, 865 miles in length, crossing the various structural and relief zones from its Alpine sources and entering its plain course in the North Sea lowlands. Farther east the several broadly parallel systems include the Weser, the Elbe, the Oder, and the Vistula, which rise in the uplands of central Europe and flow in a general northwesterly direction across the lowlands to the North or Baltic Sea. Each of these rivers reveals distinct right-angle bends, the result of the Pleistocene ice sheets, the margins and terminal moraines of which lay along an east–west line so that meltwaters escaping to the sea had to flow in a westerly direction, eroding broad intermorainal channels (Urstromtäler). When the ice sheets withdrew, the rivers occupied some sections of the east–west meltwater channels between their northerly courses. During the 19th and early 20th centuries several of these channels were used as routes to construct canals linking the north-flowing rivers. The Mittelland Canal of north central Germany is the most prominent of these."
