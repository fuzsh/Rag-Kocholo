In practice these haven't been used for a long time.\n\nRegarding width and height: It's easy to get confused, so calm down! If you are taller or thicker than usual, you need a bigger size. The sizes get bigger in both dimensions. This means that if you are 190 cm tall and slim, your waist would happily accept size 50 trousers, but the trousers will be short. Or if you have a lot of belly but you are short, you might need a size 56 jacket, on which the sleeves will be long. Yes, it's a pity if you're funny proportioned. Sometimes it pays to be normal.\n\nAs you measure yourself, take the actual measurements, don't add any just to be sure. Correct places for measurements are shown in the picture.\n\nSizes 42 or 60 and above are very uncommon.\n\nThese are measurements of the body, not the garment itself.\n\nEU sizeChestLengthCollarEasy size 42 84 cm 164-170 cm36 cm X-Small 4488 cm164-170 cm37 cm X-Small ½ 46 92 cm 170-176 cm38 cm Small 48 96 cm176-182 cm39 cm Small ½ 50 100 cm 176-182 cm40 cm Medium 52104 cm 182-188 cm 41 cmMedium ½ 54 108 cm182-188 cm42 cmLarge 56112 cm 188-194 cm43 cmLarge ½ 58116 cm188-194 cm44 cm X-Large 60120 cm188-194 cm45 cm X-Large ½ 62 124 cm 188-194 cm 46 cm2X-Large 64128 cm188-194 cm47 cm2x-Large ½ 66132 cm 188-194 cm48 cm3X-Large\n\nSize chart used in\n\nCookies, bloody cookies!
