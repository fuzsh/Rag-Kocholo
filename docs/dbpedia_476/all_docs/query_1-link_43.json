Rigid fork? No problem, just purchase the Veloflexx Bridge and Bracket (sold separately) to accomodate a rigid fork set-up. The bridge allows the fender to be mounted to the top of the seat stay or fork legs without tools, using rubber straps. Quick Release mounts with rubber tension straps and hook and loop straps, so fender eyelets are not necessary."
