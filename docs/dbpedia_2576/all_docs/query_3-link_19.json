        "text": "Commitment\n\nAffording College Is Not the Question\n\nTo attend the United States Air Force Academy, we ask for something more valuable than tuition: your commitment. Because the United States Air Force values your service to this country, covering your expenses is an investment weâ€™re willing to make.\n\nIn Return, the Country Gets a Leader\n\nAttending the Academy is a commitment to serve your country, and an education at the U.S. Air Force Academy is provided at no cost to cadets. All that is required in return is your commitment to serve as an officer in the U.S. Air Force or U.S. Space Force.\n\nThe length of your commitment depends on your career path and other factors, but with your future secured, it will allow for focused ambition, purposeful self-discovery and impactful study during your college years.\n\nOur investment in developing well-rounded leaders at the Academy pays untold dividends to our nation. You get a free, world-class education, free room and board, free medical and dental benefits and the opportunity for a rewarding career in your chosen field upon graduation.\n\nOnce you arrive on campus, you will take the Oath of Allegiance. Failure to take the Oath of Allegiance will cancel all entitlements to travel expenses to the Academy as well as travel expenses back to your home.\n\nIf you entered the Academy from the regular or reserve component of any service and are discharged from the Academy before graduation, you will, under most circumstances, return to your former rank and branch of service to serve the rest of your obligation.\n\nGraduates who complete pilot training incur a longer commitment. The U.S. Air Force policy in effect when you enter flight training determines the length of your commitment, which is currently 10 years after completion of training."
