        "text": "The Air Force is the second-youngest of the six military branches, with only the Space Force being newer. According to the Air Force’s website, they have five core missions: “Air superiority; global strike; rapid global mobility; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and command and control.”\n\nThere are two categories of Airmen within the Air Force: Enlisted (E-1 through E-9), which include noncommissioned officers, and commissioned officers (O-1 through O-10). The Airman’s title and pay grade are represented by the letter and number, while rank is indicated by the corresponding insignia.\n\nEnlisted Airmen\n\nThe Air Force has three tiers of enlisted airmen: Airmen (E-1 through E-4), noncommissioned officers (E-5 and E-6) and senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 through E-9).\n\nAirman Basic (E-1)\n\nA newly enlisted service member’s career begins as an airman basic. In this training role, which includes basic training, Airmen learn about the culture and procedures of the Air Force under the mentorship of more senior members.\n\nAirman (AMN/E-2)\n\nFollowing graduation from basic training, most airmen enroll in a duty specialty school, which will take up to one year to complete. With additional training, an AMN can later fulfill other specialties.\n\nAirman (A1C/E-3)\n\nIn this role, they should be well adjusted to military life and have the ability to easily execute their duties. They should be well aware of the expectations of the Air Force and continue their education.\n\nSenior Airman (SrA/E-4)\n\nAt this level, the senior airman is expected to be proficient in their specialty area and to take on a leadership role in preparation for their next promotion. Their duties may include basic instruction at basic training. In addition, these airmen continue their post-secondary education and their leadership training through a six-week airman leadership program.\n\nNoncommissioned Officers (NCOs)\n\nNoncommissioned officers are senior enlisted Airman (E-5 through E-9) who demonstrate strong leadership skills.\n\nStaff Sergeant (SSgt/E-5)\n\nThe staff sergeant displays their professionalism, leadership skills and technical expertise while mentoring other Airmen. Their duties may include acting as supervisors within their departments, collaborating with other officers or writing performance reports while continuing their education.\n\nTechnical Sergeant (TSgt/E-6)\n\nThe technical sergeant must be proficient in their areas of expertise and demonstrate strong leadership skills. Their duties include supporting the mission of their departments and commanding a flight unit of two or more airmen.\n\nMaster Sergeant (MSgt/E-7)\n\nMaster sergeant is a leadership position requiring attention to detail and strong technical skills. Master sergeants support the welfare of their units in roles such as flight chiefs or section chiefs. Most master sergeants have earned their undergraduate degrees, and continuing education focuses on developing leadership and other skills.\n\nFirst Sergeant (E-7 to E-9)\n\nThe first sergeant is chosen from the senior NCOs (E-7 through E-9). This is a special assignment role reporting directly to the deputy commander.\n\nSenior Master Sergeant (SMSgt/E-8)\n\nSenior master sergeant is an operational leadership role. They are usually assigned to high-level units, where they mentor junior NCOs and may be responsible for training enlisted airmen. They also support the senior officers . They will also continue their professional and leadership development.\n\nChief Master Sergeant (CMSgt/E-9)\n\nThe chief master sergeant is responsible for creating and implementing policies within their units. As such, they support the mission and improve efficiency. They mentor company-grade and field-grade officers and may act as advisors to commanders or general officers.\n\nCommand Chief Master Sergeant (E-9)\n\nA command chief master sergeant is a chief master sergeant with a special role. They carry out the same duties and have the same responsibilities. They also act as advisors to the top commanders of the largest Air Force units.\n\nChief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF/E-9)\n\nThe chief master sergeant acts as a direct advisor to the Air Force chief of staff and secretary of the Air Force and assumes responsibility for the enlisted airmen, including their conduct and training.\n\nSenior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (SEAC)\n\nThe senior enlisted advisor to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff acts as advisor to the chairman and as a spokesperson about issues affecting enlisted personnel and the communication channel for the enlisted members. This is the most senior enlisted rank in the Air Force.\n\nCommissioned Officers (COs)\n\nCommissioned officers are divided into three tiers: Company-grade, field-grade and general officers.\n\nCompany-Grade Officers (O-1 to O-3)\n\nSecond Lieutenant (2d LT/O-1)\n\nNewly commissioned officers begin as second lieutenants. They may train in a rated (flying) capacity, including as a pilot or combat system officer, or in a non-rated (non-flying) capacity, such as in intelligence or cyber operations.\n\nFirst Lieutenant (1st Lt/O-2)\n\nA first lieutenant has similar duties as a second lieutenant but has more experience and training.\n\nCaptain (Capt/O-3)\n\nThe rank of captain is usually attained within four years of becoming a commissioned officer. Captains may serve as flight commanders due to their experience and expert knowledge. They may also be found in administrative positions. Captains can be senior or junior captains (holding smaller leadership roles).\n\nField-Grade Officers (O-4 to O-6)\n\nMajor (Maj/O-4)\n\nMajors usually serve at a squadron or wing level. Their responsibilities become more administrative and managerial. In flying units, they may serve as a flight commander or a squadron commander in a non-flying unit. Majors are expected to continue their post-secondary education, usually toward a master’s degree or higher.\n\nLieutenant Colonel (Lt Col/O-5)\n\nLieutenant colonels serve as assistants to the colonel. They mentor junior commissioned officers, and majors and captains often report directly to them. This is a leadership role, and lieutenant colonels often serve as the squadron commander in a group, which may be flying, non-flying or medical.\n\nColonel (Col/O-6)\n\nColonel is a leadership and operations role responsible for improving services at the base. They are typically group or wing commanders, leading 1,000 to 4,000 airmen. They may also lead training schools. As such, they are expected to hold graduate degrees.\n\nGeneral Officers (O-7 and Higher)\n\nBrigadier General (Brig Gen/O-7)\n\nBrigadier generals usually command larger wings and bases or high-level staff, such as those at the Pentagon or at North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Their duties include administrative, operational and leadership functions, including participating in motivational and morale events.\n\nMajor General (Maj Gen/O-8)\n\nPromotion to major general, which is a two-star general officer rank, is highly competitive. They serve in high-level leadership roles, such as joint force commanders or senior directors on joint staffs. They often command about 10,000 airmen.\n\nLieutenant General (Lt Ge/O-9)\n\nSimilar to a major general, a lieutenant general is involved in all aspects of administration and operations, as well as in leadership and morale issues. Roles include high-level command positions such as at a major command.\n\nGeneral (Gen/O-10)\n\nGeneral is a four-star general officer rank, the highest rank in the Air Force. They hold the highest-level positions at the Pentagon and at organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\nGeneral of the Air Force (GAF/O-10)"
