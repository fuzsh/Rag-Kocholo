        "text": "By Master Sgt. Stephen Wilkerson 437th Maintenance Operations Squadron first sergeant\n\nDo you think we need core values in our society outside the military?\n\nWhen you walk into a store, do you know what their values are? Our core values say a lot about us as a whole. The Air Force core values are integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do. We need to carry these values with us beyond the Air Force, into our local communities.\n\nWhen you go to the mall what does integrity mean to you? It should mean you are getting what you pay for. You are getting the best quality or the best piece of equipment your money can buy. Integrity should be in every company's motto. Integrity comes with some moral traits such as honesty, responsibility, accountability and self-respect.\n\nHonesty is probably the most important trait because it is your word people believe. If you say you are going to do something, then do it.\n\nResponsibility is, knowing your job or duty and performing it correctly; doing what needs to be done even when no one is around.\n\nAccountability is another good trait. You should take credit where credit is due and be ready to accept blame when it comes.\n\nThe last trait is self-respect. You must respect yourself enough as a human being and not bring discredit upon yourself or the organization you work for.\n\nNow, think about the service you receive when you go to a store or restaurant. Do you think the individual helping you is thinking about service before self? Are they thinking about what time they get off work? I would hope they are thinking how they could best serve the customer.\n\nService before self has a lot of different meanings to different people but it should mean your duties take precedence over personal desires when you are working. You should take care of customers' desires when they come into your office and attend to their needs.\n\nIn the military, as supervisors and leaders, a part of your duties is to place the needs of your Airmen ahead of your own. The best example of service before self comes when you see your leaders, bosses, commanders and chief executive officers leading the way. Things flow better when it comes from the top down. In our lives, we all are leaders whether at home or work, so let's set the example.\n\nOur last value is simply excellence in all we do. We should strive to have a passion to do great things. We should always be looking for ways to do things better. We should strive to have an individual mindset to produce the best product and to have the best customer service. If this is done individually, it will definitely make your team or business better. When you work together to reach a common goal, it helps reach the best potential for the team.\n\nDo you think we need core values in our society outside the military? If you think we need core values in our society, then it is up us to take these values out to our local communities. We are a part of our society, and unfortunately, we cannot stay in the Air Force forever. One day we will be an owner or working for a company which needs these core values.\n\nHere is a quote from retired Gen. Ronald Fogleman, which can be used in society as well the Air Force.\n\n\"True quality is embodied in the actions of Air Force people who take decisive steps to improve processes and products; who capitalize on quality as a leverage tool to enhance products, achieve savings, and improve customer service; and who exemplify our core values of integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do.\""
