        "text": "The Air Force has identified 1,175 positions across 10 developmental special duties, or DSDs, for spring 2017.\n\nIdentified as developmental due to their unique leadership roles and the responsibility to mentor and mold young Airmen, the 10 duties are: Career Assistance Advisor, Military Training Instructor, Military Training Leader, Air Force Academy Military Training Instructor, Airman and Family Readiness Center Noncommissioned Officer, First Sergeant, Air Force Honor Guard NCO, Recruiter, Professional Military Education Instructor and specialty training instructors identified with a “T” prefix.\n\nCommanders are encouraged to nominate any Airmen in the rank of staff, technical and master sergeant they feel is the right fit for these critical duties. Nominees must have a demonstrated record of exceptional performance and a high capacity to lead.\n\n“When America’s sons and daughters commit themselves to service, the Air Force takes on the charge to develop them into Airmen,” said Master Sgt. Falon Holman, the noncommissioned officer in charge of developmental special duty assignments at the Air Force Personnel Center. “Airmen selected for DSD must be the best of the best in the Air Force—an ambassador and role model for the Air Force core values of integrity, service and excellence.”\n\nThe nomination process provides commanders, through their respective major commands, an opportunity to nominate their best Airmen to fill these critical positions, providing a developmental career path.\n\nTo be considered DSD for nomination, Airmen must be staff, technical or master sergeants with at least four years of service remaining before they reach their high year of tenure. They require a score of 90 or above on the last fitness test, or 80 or above on the last two tests.\n\nIn addition, nominees must have exhibited excellence in their core career field with a skill level commensurate with their grade, and have a performance assessment rating of either of the top two ratings under the new rating system or an overall “5” under the previous rating system on their last three enlisted performance reports.\n\nThe DSD nomination process truly begins at the unit level.\n\n“Squadron commanders are in the best position to know their Airmen’s strengths, abilities and interests,” Holman said. “They review the developmental duties and identify two for each nominee. However, Airmen interested in performing developmental special duties should ensure their leadership is aware of their aspirations.”\n\nAirmen who are not nominated for DSD, but still interested in career-developing opportunities, can go to the Enlisted Quarterly Assignment Listing-Plus website and review the special duty catalog.\n\nAirmen who are nominated for a developmental duty, but are not selected, remain eligible for selection until the end of each DSD cycle, in the event of future openings.\n\nDevelopmental Special Duty qualifications are outlined in the special duty catalog. Additional information about specific rank requirements, nomination eligibility criteria, process and other specifics can be found on myPers under Special Duty Assignment Programs on the Active Duty: Enlisted Assignments Home Page or select “Active Duty Enlisted” from the dropdown menu and search “DSD.”"
