        "text": "Air Force ROTC is a scholarship program available at nearly 1,000 colleges and universities across the country. The program can help you study at the college of your choice while earning money for school and preparing to be an Officer in the Space Force after graduation. For the most up-to-date information, visit the official Air Force ROTC website\n\nThe Air Force Academy offers world-class education and cost-free tuition in exchange for your service in the Space Force. If you excel at leadership and academics, and you’re determined to become an officer in the Space Force, we’d love to hear from you. For the most complete information on how to prepare and apply, visit the Academy Admissions website.\n\nAFIT allows Space Force Officers to pursue graduate studies as a full-time, active-duty assignment. Located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, AFIT is a world leader in defense technological education, research and consultation. Plus it’s the Air Force’s graduate school of engineering and management as well as its institution for professional, continuing education.\n\nAFIT’s Air Force Graduate School for Engineering and Management is among the nation’s top engineering schools and enables officers to earn a master’s degree or Ph.D. in one of more than 20 areas of specialization.\n\nHelping train and equip future Guardians for cyber careers, the Air Force Institute of Technology Center for Cyberspace Research (CCR) conducts defense-focused research at the graduate level. This center responds to the changing educational and research needs of the Air Force, Space Force, Department of Defense and the federal government.\n\nActive-duty personnel can pursue voluntary, off-duty educational opportunities with assistance from the Military Tuition Assistance (MilTA) program. Currently, the program pays 100 percent (up to $250 per semester hour or equivalent) of the cost of college tuition with a limit of $4,500 per fiscal year. Courses and degree programs may be academic or technical and can be taken from two- or four-year institutions on base, off base or by correspondence.\n\nOfficers can step out of their current specialty and focus on becoming more-effective leaders through the Squadron Officer School (SOS). Participants will initially gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Space Force’s Core Values and mission. Then, through classes and field exercises, they’ll develop leadership skills, experiencing firsthand how their skills as a leader directly influence the success of the Space Force as a whole."
