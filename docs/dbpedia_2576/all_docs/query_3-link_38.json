        "text": "Staff Sgt. Saul Mendoza: I take pride in putting on a uniform every morning because it stands for something — and I honestly don’t see myself doing anything else.\n\nAirman 1st Class Carlos Puga: I wanted to do something that would make an impact in my life and set me up for success.\n\nSenior Airman Jonathan Massey: We all play a role that helps accomplish the bigger mission.\n\nStaff Sgt. Saul Mendoza: Now that I’m older, going to school, I understand how important it is. So I’m giving it everything I got. Because — and that’s also something I got from the Air Force: You’re there, you’re going to do it, why not do it your best?\n\nAirman 1st Class Carlos Puga: The Air Guard really doesn’t interfere much with my studies. I think one of the great things that you learn, even in training, is time management. And I think that has really helped me as far as creating that balance. I tried other things, but it seems like the Military has probably the best way to position you. Even if you don’t know what you want to do in life, at least you’ll have a solid foundation that will always make you stand out above most of your peers."
