        "text": "This Uniform Is Earned, Not Given\n\nIt takes a unique individual to succeed in Air Force ROTC. It takes dedication, drive and discipline. Since the goal of the program is to help students become officers and leaders in the U.S. Air Force and Space Force, you will need to meet certain standards and be able to maintain them throughout the program.\n\nService CommitmentA Duty and An Honor\n\nAfter completing all Air Force ROTC and academic degree requirements, cadets accept a commission as second lieutenants in the Air Force or Space Force, appointed by the president of the united states.\n\nThe length of your initial service commitment depends on your career. Most officers have a four-year active-duty service commitment. Pilots have a 10-year active-duty service commitment, and both Combat System Officers and Air Battle Managers have a six-year service commitment upon completion of their respective training.\n\nNursing graduates accept a commission in the Air Force Nurse Corps and serve four years on active duty after completing their licensing examination."
