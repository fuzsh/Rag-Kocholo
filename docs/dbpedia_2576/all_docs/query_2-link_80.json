I think he's been failed in general by society, you know?\" Johnston said.\n\nBrown's case is just a symptom of a larger problem, said Dr. David Josephs, Ph.D. with the Lakeview Center.\n\n\"We clearly do not have enough resources to meet the needs of these disorders,\" Dr. Josephs said.\n\nThere is a bright spot, he believes. Crisis intervention teams used by law enforcement are trained to deal with people with mental illness and drug dependency in crisis.\n\nBut Dr. Josephs said we have a long way to go before we deal with a national crisis.\n\nMore than 100,000 people a year die in the United States from mental health-related problems.\n\n\"Why can't we get traction on serious mental illnesses? It's because we don't have the focus and we don't pay attention to it, it's not that we can't do it, a significant amount of it is the funding,\" Dr. Josephs said.\n\nThe state of Florida fluctuates between 48th and 49th in the country for per capita spending.\n\nDale's sister said she hopes people will not see him for his faults but for his humanity and the help he needs.\n\n\"I hope he will be evaluated and be put on medication and, you know, taken to a facility that he can be cared for the proper way that he needs,\" Johnston said.\n\nBrown is charged with aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, armed burglary, and trespassing."
