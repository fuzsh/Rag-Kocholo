        "text": "The AF First Sergeant Academy (FSA) is a leadership development and technical training course designed to train, educate, and develop select senior noncommissioned officers to serve as United States Air Force first sergeants. First sergeants advise commanders on the readiness, health, morale, welfare, and quality of life of Airmen and families to ensure a mission-ready force. The FSA is a total force academy and integrates students from the active duty, Air Reserve, and Air National Guard components. Upon graduation, students are awarded the special duty identifier (SDI) 8F000 and authorized to wear the first sergeant chevron.\n\nThe resident learning course consists of 217 hours and is divided into four weeks of demanding curriculum to include First Sergeant Responsibilities, Maintenance and Discipline, Negotiation and Dispute Resolution, Resiliency Training, and First Sergeant Legal Orientation. FSA also partners with other schools across Air University and industry experts. Vectored first sergeants will attend 20 days of resident study at Maxwell AFB–Gunter Annex, Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nIn addition, FSA offers a first sergeant additional duty seminar for each component. FSA provides oversight of the additional duty seminars to ensure core curriculum requirements are met. The areas of study include Human Resource Management, Maintenance of Discipline, and Readiness modules.\n\nLearning Outcomes. The FSA graduate will be able to\n\nProvide commanders with a mission-ready force by advising on all matters affecting unit readiness, health, morale, discipline, welfare, quality of life, legal, and quality force indicators\n\nLead the unit effort in developing, nurturing and cultivating a professional culture grounded in the Air Force Core Values\n\nFacilitate and execute commander’s intent by ensuring Airmen's understanding and compliance with unit policies, goals, and objectives\n\nPrepare the unit’s enlisted force to best execute all assigned tasks through effective written and oral communication\n\nMaintain balance/harmony by practicing self-care throughout the first sergeant tour\n\nFaculty.
