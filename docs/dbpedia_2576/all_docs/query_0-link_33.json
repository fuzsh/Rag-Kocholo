The cases\n\nchosen are designed to illustrate a wide range of organizational\n\nbehavior concepts and principles â those ordinarily described and\n\ndiscussed in any comprehensive textbook in organizational behavior.\n\nThe structure of this casebook parallels my Fundamentals of Organizational Behavior but also is planned as a companion volume to other\n\ncurrent texts in the field. Casebook may be used independently, with\n\na book of readings, or supplemented by appropriate journal articles.\n\nA casebook of the nature presented here is intended for use in\n\ncourses dealing with human behavior in organizations, such as\n\norganizational behavior, behavioral science in management, organizational psychology, human relations, and behaviorally oriented\n\nmanagement. The cases presented are also for college and university\n\nundergraduate and masters level courses, and in programs of management development. Our emphasis is clearly upon knowledge workers\n\n(managers, professionals, staff specialists, technicians, and salespersons) as opposed to first-line foremen, clerical and production\n\nworkers.\n\nThe case method has strong appeal to educators and students in\n\ndiverse fields, including law, medicine, political science, business, and\n\norganizational behavior. People attempting to sharpen their skills in\n\nan applied discipline welcome the opportunity provided for simuix\n\nP:06\n\nPreface\n\nlated experience, personal involvement, and experimental learning.\n\nBeginners as well as experienced practitioners find pleasure in\n\nprojecting themselves into a new situation â one they would not see\n\nfrom the inside except for the case method.\n\nAnother important advantage of the case method is its timesaving element. Few people interested to improve their skills in\n\nmanaging human problems in organizations, for example, have\n\nenough time (or money) to personally investigate 100 different\n\norganizational situations. A well-conceived casebook, at its best, can\n\nalmost substitute for direct experience. Cases that fail to stimulate\n\nreader interest and involvement because of their blandness, vacuity,\n\ncomplexity, or obviousness, however, are poor substitutes for first\n\nhand experience.\n\nAll of the cases presented in this book are based upon true\n\nincidents in business, governmental, educational, community, and\n\nrecreational organizations of the past or present. None of the cases\n\npresented is a reprint of any that have appeared in other texts or\n\ncasebooks. Several are amalgams of incidents that have taken place in\n\ntwo or more real situations. All organization names, locations, and\n\npersonnel have been disguised. When a case researcher other than I\n\nconducted most of the investigation underlying a given case, he or\n\nshe is identified, and appropriate permission has been obtained to\n\npublish the case.\n\nP:07\n\nA ckn Î¿ wledgmen ts\n\nA number of people contributed to this project. Gerry Deegan,\n\nformer Managing Editor at Pergamon, suggested that the world\n\nneeded a casebook of this nature. My students in the MBA program\n\nat Rochester Institute of Technology researched and wrote several\n\nof the cases, as indicated by footnote. Many of my cases stemmed\n\ndirectly from interactions with clients; thus, the contributions of\n\nmany anonymous people from a variety of organizations and perspectives are found in the following pages. Once again Lois Smith\n\nperformed superbly as my manuscript typist. Dottie Miller and\n\nKathy Kulp promptly and willingly executed a variety of clerical\n\nchores.\n\nMy children â Drew, Douglas, and Melanie â served as constant\n\nreminders that effective learning materials must be attention arousing. Marcia DuBrin helped by occupying two roles. A guidance\n\ncounselor in a school system, she provided me with many useful\n\nanecdotes and observations. As my wife, she provided me with large\n\ndoses of emotional support and evaluative reinforcement.\n\nLastly, thanks to the staff at Pergamon for their willingness once\n\nagain to invest time and energy on my behalf.\n\nAndrew J. DuBrin\n\nRochester, New York\n\nxi\n\nP:08\n\n1\n\nGuidelines for Case Analysis\n\nCases are written descriptions of human behavior based upon\n\nreal-life situations. At its best, the case method allows you to\n\nsimulate decision making and decision analysis in a variety of\n\nsituations you would not have access to otherwise. Cases are a\n\nconvenient way of condensing and encapsulating work experiences\n\nâ provided that the cases are meaningful and the approach to\n\nanalysis is thorough. At its worst, the case method is a platform for\n\naimless, free floating, undisciplined and uncensored discourse (unstructured rap or bull sessions).\n\nThe case method has a high probability of adding to the\n\nmanagerial skills of the case analyst when he or she approaches the\n\ntask of case analysis in a focused, planful manner. Even that\n\nmysterious quality called managerial intuition can be improved upon\n\nwhen the person having the intuitive hunches uses appropriate\n\nframework and concepts tp investigate situations.\n\nCommon sense is similarly heightened by a systematic analysis of\n\ndiverse cases. One reason common sense is so uncommon in organizations is that common sense is essentially good judgment stemming\n\nfrom the results of trial and error in a multitude of situations. What\n\nbecomes common sense to the experienced practitioner is regarded\n\nby the neophyte in the field as admirable wisdom. The case method,\n\nwhen used properly, is an economical vehicle for acquiring common\n\nsense about a variety of situations in organizational life.\n\nRealistic, absorbing cases, combined with systematic tools of\n\n3\n\nP:09\n\n4 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nanalysis, give the case analyst a chance to sharpen his or her\n\nmanagerial skills, common sense, and intuition. Such is the purpose\n\nof this casebook.\n\nSEVEN SALIENT OBJECTIVES\n\nEducational technology has advanced to the point where many\n\nformal learning experiences have objectives. Individual instructors\n\nand students will probably formulate some of their own objectives in\n\na case method course, depending upon the unique properties of their\n\nindividual situations. Jeffrey A. Barach, a marketing professor, has\n\ndeveloped a set of performance objectives for case method courses\n\nthat are coincident with the aims and objectives of most users of this\n\ncasebook. 1\n\nA person attaining all or most of these performance\n\nobjectives would undoubtedly improve his or her managerial capability and communication skills.\n\nDecision Making\n\nThe student must be able to make the decisions required by the\n\ncase. Not every question following each case in this book requires the\n\nstudent to make a major decision, but every case involves at least one\n\ndecision. Many knowledge workers are comfortable analyzing facts\n\nabout a given decision situation, but only a few people have the\n\ncourage and self-confidence to actually recommend a course of\n\naction. An important performance objective is thus to learn to \\\"fish\n\nor cut bait.\\\" As stated by Barach, 4 4A passion for passing the buck in\n\nfavor of discussing profundities is inadequate performance.\\\" 2\n\nLogical Thinking\n\n\\\"The student must demonstrate the ability to think logically,\n\nclearly, and self-consistently.\\\" Conclusions should follow from\n\nassumptions made by the student in support of recommendations\n\n1\n\nJeffrey A. Barach, \\\"Performance Criteria Used in the Evaluation of Case\n\nCourse,\\\" Collegiate News & Views (Published by South-Western Publishing Co.)\n\nWinter, 1974, 75, 19-20.\n\n2\n\nIbid., p. 20.\n\nP:10\n\nGuidelines for Case Analysis 5\n\nand analyses. \\\"This statement is not dependent upon subject matter,\n\nbut the definition of what is consistent, what is logical, is subject\n\nmatter dependent. A student must show a knowledge of what are\n\nappropriate fact, assumptions, realities, and the determination of this\n\nis subject matter dependent.\\\" 3\n\nOral Communication Skills\n\nA vital objective of the case method is for the student to acquire\n\nskill in making oral presentations to a group of people. Case method\n\ncourses lend themselves naturally to giving all class members a chance\n\nto make a case presentation during the quarter or semester. When\n\nsmall groups are used to analyze cases, the spokesperson or team\n\nleader for the group is assigned the task of making a class presentation. Most people contemplating careers in managerial work can\n\nbenefit from additional experience in speaking before groups.\n\nImprovement of Common Sense\n\nThe student should heighten his or her common sense (defined as\n\nthe capacity to see the obvious and the relevant) as a result of the\n\ncase method. If common sense were more frequently applied to\n\norganizational problems there would be fewer people in work\n\norganizations who are frustrated, bored, restless, underutilized, overworked, or alienated. \\\" A student should be capable of recognizing\n\nand putting appropriate weight on the fundamental issues and factors\n\nrelevant to the case. This objective is so crucial, that it has been said\n\nthat the total impact o f the Harvard Business School education can\n\nbe summed up as teaching one to apply his (or her) common sense in\n\nan administrative context.\\\" 4\n\nAnalytic Problem Solving and Quantitative Methods\n\n\\\"The student must demonstrate his (or her) willingness and\n\nability to apply analytical muscle and quantitative analysis where\n\n3\n\nIbid.\n\n*Ibid.\n\nP:11\n\n6 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nrelevant. A coherent, self-consistent, basically relevant argument\n\nwhich ignores the fundamental tools of managerial problem solving\n\nanalysis is deficient.\\\" 5\n\nAlthough the cases contained in a casebook\n\nabout organizational behavior typically do not present statistical data\n\nfor analysis, the student should be alert to what types of quantitative\n\nanalysis might be beneficial. For instance, if a case describes the\n\nproblem of turnover in middle management, the case analyst might\n\nsuggest an appropriate research design to discover causal factors\n\nunderlying this turnover.\n\nA case presents raw data for analysis. In attempting to analyze\n\nthe case, the student should reach into his or her armamentarium for\n\nthe most appropriate methodological tool. A real danger exists in\n\noverapplying a selected few concepts and theories to almost every\n\ncase about organizational behavior. For instance, the ubiquity and\n\nsimplicity of Maslow's theory of human motivation has led to its\n\noverapplication in case analysis. Oft repeated is the sentiment, \\\"This\n\ncase is basically a situation of somebody whose needs for selfactualization have been frustrated. Give that person a chance to be\n\nself-actualized and the problem will be solved.\\\"\n\nGeneralizing to the Broader Context\n\n\\\"The student should be capable of transcending the concrete\n\nsituation, adding perspective, and demonstrating competence.\\\" Most\n\ncases have implications beyond the immediate boundaries o f that\n\nspecific case. An important characteristic of an effective case is that\n\nit serve as a springboard to broader discussions. Not every case (nor\n\nevery instructor) requires that the broader implications of a case be\n\nanalyzed, but this will be a desirable objective for many cases. An\n\nimportant purpose served by the case method is to allow the student\n\nto develop some general principles useful in solving other cases and\n\nproblems encountered in live organizational settings.\n\nFilling in the Details\n\n\\\" A student should be able to make use of available data to form\n\na fairly detailed and well-argued plan of action, or a fairly detailed\n\nand well-argued analysis of situations requested for analysis.\n\n5\n\nIbid.\n\nP:12\n\nGuidelines for Case Analysis 7\n\nAlthough like some of those above, this objective is different in the\n\nsense that simply making a decision and arguing for it without filling\n\nin the concrete details â the many little decisions which make the\n\nmain decision meaningful â does not represent a fully successful case\n\nanalysis. There is a quality o f follow-through required.\\\" 6\n\nSimilarly, a staff specialist or manager must consider carefully\n\nand weigh an array of facts and specific acts of behavior when\n\nmaking decisions involving people. Cases frustrate some people\n\nbecause many of the necessary facts have to be assumed or inferred.\n\nInterviewing characters in the cases in order to obtain more details is\n\nnot possible.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR CASE ANALYSIS\n\nCasebooks traditionally present a series of elaborate or brief\n\nsituations, each ending quite as abruptly as a picture on a screen\n\nsuddenly gone dark in a movie or on a television receiver. An\n\nalternative approach, and the one presented in this book, is to ask a\n\nseries of questions following each case. Reacting to these questions\n\nmay seem less contrived to the student than mechanically applying\n\nthe scientific method to every case. Ideally, questions should serve as\n\nprobes which do not discourage the use of the scientific method, but\n\nrather add new perspectives to a systematic analysis of the case at\n\nhand. Questions do not exclude the traditional method of case analysis, but add a new dimension. Whether the traditional method of case\n\nanalysis (without questions) is used or the questions at the end of\n\neach case provide the framework for case analysis, a few experiencebased suggestions might prove fruitful to the case analyst.\n\nDefine and Clarify the Problem\n\nThe initial step in any problem solving situation is to properly\n\ndefine and then (almost simultaneously) clarify the problem. In cases\n\nabout human behavior in organizations, problem definition and\n\nclarification usually involve recognizing and explaining the more\n\nprominent patterns of behavior found. For instance, in \\\"The Decimation of Denver Printing\\\" (presented later in the book) the case\n\n6\n\nIbid.\n\nP:13\n\n8 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nanalyst will anticipate what patterns of behavior will most probably\n\nsurface when a sudden, dramatic reduction in the executive work\n\nforce takes place. The dominant form of behavior occurring in\n\nanother case might be dysfunctional response to managerial controls.\n\nUntil this major pattern of behavior is recognized, further analysis\n\nand recommendations for action are likely to deal with peripheral\n\nissues.\n\nClarification of the problem involves becoming specific about the\n\nmajor behavioral patterns. Assume that a case is primarily concerned\n\nwith resistance to change. Clarification here might ask such questions\n\nas, (1) Which people will resist the change? (2) Why will some people\n\nresist the change and other welcome it? (3) What form will this\n\nresistance take? â Statements of resentment? Turnover? Sabotage?\n\nEspionage?\n\nApply a Wide Range o f Concepts\n\nOne introductory textbook in the field of organizational behavior has 2500 items in its subject index. A dictionary of behavioral\n\nscience terms runs to several hundred pages. Despite the plethora of\n\nconcepts available (admittedly, some more useful than others) many\n\nstudents confine their case analysis to a handful of basic behavioral\n\nscience concepts. All of human behavior in organizations cannot be\n\nneatly tucked under the rubric of a handful of concepts. The student\n\nis, therefore, urged to try a variety of concepts in answering the\n\nquestions to cases. For instance, instead of stating that a manager in\n\na given case appears to be \\\"to o production oriented\\\" in his style, it\n\nmight be appropriate to note that he has done little to make the path\n\ntoward goal attainment easier for his subordinates (one aspect o f\n\nthe path-goal theory of leadership effectiveness).\n\nCases in this book (or any other book of cases familiar to the\n\nauthor) are not written to imply that only one or two variables may\n\nbe used to explain the case dynamics. Even when a case is presented\n\nin a chapter dealing with small-group behavior, it does not mean that\n\nno other concepts may be used profitably. In analyzing the problems\n\nfaced by a work team, for example, it might be profitable to suggest\n\nthe utilization of a different type of communications network in the\n\ngroup â a variable more nearly relating to interpersonal communication than small-group behavior.\n\nP:14\n\nGuidelines for Case Analysis 9\n\nRespond to the Issue at Hand\n\nThe case method has the inherent disadvantage of almost inviting\n\ntangential thinking. Cases are often springboards for discussing\n\nalmost anything related to the general topic of the case. One\n\nobjective stated earlier was for the student to be able to generalize\n\nfrom a specific case to other situations â to look for the general\n\n\\\"message\\\" involved in each case. Springboarding of this nature\n\nshould take place only after the issue at hand has been dealt with\n\nsatisfactorily. Digressions in case analyses take many forms, but three\n\nconcrete examples will illuminate the frequent tendency of people to\n\nneglect the issue at hand.\n\nâ¢ A woman enrolled in a behavioral science in management\n\ncourse made a presentation to the class that involved primarily the\n\nproblem of finding a suitable location for a franchise hamburger\n\nrestaurant. The case was included in a section of the course dealing\n\nwith behavioral aspects to decision making. The student presented an\n\nintriguing analysis of how management would have to perform\n\ndifferent leaderships styles, depending upon the neighborhood in\n\nwhich it was decided to locate the restaurant. However intriguing this\n\nanalysis, it did not deal with the issue at hand.\n\nâ¢ A young man prepared an analysis of a case about a 45-yearold manager experiencing a mid-career crisis. One part dealt with\n\nh ow the manager found himself in that predicament. Another part\n\ndealt with management's attempts to handle the situation. The\n\nanalyst used this case as a platform to discuss how \\\"being nice to\n\npeople\\\" is a solid theoretical concept, but is an ineffectual way to\n\npractice management.\n\nâ¢ An older student was assigned the responsibility of presenting\n\nhis group's analysis of the circumstances dealing with sudden reduction in a work force. Under the pressures of declining business, a\n\nmortgage insurance company found it necessary to lay off one third\n\nof its clerical and managerial staff. The case analyst presented a\n\nlengthy discourse about the importance of tight managerial controls.\n\nHis reasoning was that with proper controls in the past, the company\n\nwould not have been in this predicament. Perhaps his reasoning was\n\ntrue, but he was still ignoring the central issue of the case: the\n\nfunctional and dysfunctional consequences of a company laying off\n\none third of its work force at one time.\n\nP:15\n\n10 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nMake a Few Assumptions\n\nHowever thoroughly written, cases are at best vignettes of\n\nexperience. In frustration, a serious student often bemoans that the\n\ncase writer has not provided enough information for anybody to\n\nproperly answer questions about the case. Since all the information\n\nrequired to analyze a case (or answer questions about it) is almost\n\nnever available, the student must assume that certain facts exist or\n\nthat certain conditions prevail. The case analyst must simultaneously\n\noperate as a case writer to a small degree. Making assumptions to fill\n\nin for incomplete information is not unique to the case writer.\n\nManagers must often use the same process in organizational decision\n\nmaking. Only a limited number of facts are available to make any\n\ndecision. Here is a sampling of the types of assumptions the case\n\nanalyst is often forced to make.\n\nâ¢ A case is presented about how a family business begins to\n\ndegenerate after the President appoints his son-in-law Vice President\n\nof Marketing. Although the case is 15 printed pages in length, all the\n\nfacts desired by the case analyst are not available. In order to prepare\n\nher analysis and respond to questions about the case, one woman\n\nmade these assumptions:\n\n1. The President and his son-in-law do not want the business to fail.\n\n2. If the President confronts the Vice President with his mistakes,\n\nthis will not precipitate a crisis in his (the President's) daughter's\n\nmarriage.\n\n3. Should the Vice President of Marketing have to be replaced, the\n\ncompany would be capable of finding a suitable replacement.\n\n4. The President is accurate in his assessment of the problems facing\n\nthe business â he is not just finding a convenient excuse to fire\n\nhis son-in-law.\n\nâ¢ Another case deals with the dilemma of a hospital administrative staff when they learn that the resident physicians and interns\n\nintend to strike unless working conditions in the hospital are\n\nimproved. Bad conditions cited include excessive periods of time on\n\nduty and too few orderlies to carry the patient load. Among the\n\nassumptions the student might have to make are:\n\n1. The doctors are not bluffing; physicians have been known to\n\nstrike in other situations.\n\n2. It would be extremely difficult to fire the residents and interns\n\nand replace them with other licensed physicians.\n\n3. The hospital is working within the confines of a tight budget.\n\nP:16\n\nGuidelines for Case Analysis 11\n\nThe simple solution of hiring more professional and paraprofessional ward personnel to reduce workloads cannot be quickly\n\naccomplished.\n\nIn both the family business and hospital cases, the case analyst\n\ncould have made a different set of assumptions. Which are made is\n\nnot as important as the fact that certain assumptions are made.\n\nAssumptions made should be stated in the case analysis or in\n\nresponse to questions about the cases. Ordinarily only one, two, or\n\nthree assumptions per case are required to furnish enough information to adequately handle the case assignment.\n\nEmpathize with the Characters\n\nAn insightful case analyst intuitively empathizes â but not\n\nnecessarily sympathizes â with the central characters in a case. To\n\ndevelop a feel for what is transpiring in a given case, it is important\n\nto attempt to see things as they are seen by the principal people\n\ninvolved. Case analysis and role playing have much in common. In\n\norder to effectively assume the role of a character in a role playing\n\nexercise, you must enter that person's phenomenological sphere\n\n(\\\"walk a mile in his or her shoes\\\"). Empathy is possible even if you\n\nhave had no direct experience in the situation faced by a given\n\ncharacter. Sometimes it is possible to relate similar experiences.\n\nâ¢ A woman supervisor presented a case analysis about an\n\naggressive young Black man who felt he was being held back in his\n\ncompany because top management did not want Black people in\n\nmanagement jobs. The woman claimed one of the reasons she could\n\npresent such a lucid analysis was because she has at times been the\n\nvictim of anti-female prejudice.\n\nâ¢ A student presented an in-depth analysis of how a special sales\n\npromotion failed to win new customers to the company sponsoring\n\nthe promotion. He explained how he could empathize with the\n\ncustomers who bought the special promotional merchandise but\n\nfailed to come back as repeat customers. The student mentioned that\n\nhe does most of the shopping for his family. A strategy he uses to\n\nstay within the monthly budget is to shop for bargains, but he does\n\nnot necessarily return to the store that had the sale once the sale has\n\npassed. He argued, \\\"Why should industrial customers feel any strong\n\nobligation to look out for the welfare of their suppliers? Everybody\n\nshops for bargains, and few people have much concern for the\n\nwelfare of the company offering the bargains.\\\"\n\nP:17\n\n12 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nâ¢ An accountant presented a case analysis of a group vice\n\npresident (annual salary $75,000 per year) who, in frustration, quit\n\nhis job to open a bicycle sales and service shop. The group vice\n\npresident, in his letter of resignation to the corporation, explained\n\nthat he now perceived his job as a farce. Despite an impressive\n\nsounding title, he rarely had any urgent or important problems to\n\nresolve.\n\nA common ground of frustration for the executive and the\n\nstudent was that the latter also felt underutilized in his occupational\n\nrole: \\\"That high flying, high paid executive feels like he doesn't have\n\na real job. My situation isn't too different. The kind of accounting\n\nwork I'm doing could easily be handled by an intelligent high school\n\nstudent with decent clerical skills.\\\"\n\nFormulate Action Decisions\n\nHowever grim the predicament faced by an organization or its\n\nmembers in a given case, some action decision must be proffered by\n\nthe student. An important purpose of the case method is to place\n\nyou in the same situation that managerial workers face daily â the\n\nnecessity of doing something about a problem. In some instances the\n\ndecision to \\\"leave well enough alone\\\" may be the appropriate\n\ndecision.\n\nFor many cases it is best to suggest several alternative courses of\n\naction â one, two, or three things you intend to do about the\n\nsituation. The action decisions you choose should stem logically\n\nfrom a careful analysis of the manifest (surface) and latent (underlying) factors in the situation. Assume that a man described in a case\n\nis experiencing migraine headaches because of the stresses he faces in\n\nhis credit manager position. One action proposal that deals with the\n\nmanifest problem would be to transfer this man to a less stressful\n\njob. A proposal that reaches the latent factors in this case would be\n\nto suggest a reengineering of the credit manager's job. Perhaps the\n\nj ob is so inherently stressful that most long term occupants of that\n\nposition will experience stress reactions.\n\nA student in a case course asked \\\"Where do I get ideas for action\n\nproposals when I've never really managed anything? How do I know\n\nif I'm not recommending something that would be preposterously\n\nnaive if carried out in an actual job situation?\\\" My answer to this\n\nstudent and others posing similar questions is to use common sense,\n\nlogic, and direct application of principles of organizational behavior\n\nP:18\n\nGuidelines for Case Analysis 13\n\nand management. Many of the ideas presented in current texts about\n\norganizational behavior or the practice of management are ready for\n\napplication. Give them a try â perhaps just within the safe confines\n\nof the case method.\n\nThese same principles can be applied later to an organizational\n\nsetting when situations similar to the cases present themselves. The\n\nfeedback received from using these principles of management or\n\norganizational behavior (Did it work or not?) will influence whether\n\nor not they are retained in the practitioner's repertoire.\n\nDiscuss Implications of Action Decisions\n\nEvery course of action chosen to remedy a problem in an\n\norganization has implications. Some of these implications are positive\n\nwhile others are negative, as described by the concept of functional\n\nanalysis. Just as management must recognize the calculated risks\n\ninherent in any decision, the case analyst must engage in some\n\nspeculation about the positive and negative implications of each\n\nchosen course of action.\n\nAssume you are analyzing a case about a scientist who occupies a\n\ncentral position in insuring that a large scale, highly technical project\n\nis completed in time to meet contract specifications. Three months\n\nbefore the targeted deadline, he confronts his boss with the fact that\n\nhe has been offered a job with another company for $4000 more per\n\nyear than his current salary. He contends that unless is present salary\n\nis matched, he will leave the company within 30 days.\n\nEvery action you take in this situation will have implications. If\n\ny ou grant the increase, perhaps other employees will learn that\n\n\\\"holding a gun to management's head\\\" is an effective way of\n\nobtaining a higher salary. If you deny his request, the project may\n\nfail or miss its targeted completion date. Your job may then be in\n\njeopardy and your company may lose a valued customer. Perhaps\n\nanother action proposal, such as offering to hire the scientist as a\n\npart time consultant until the project is completed may be the most\n\npromising solution. The implications of this action decision must also\n\nbe examined. Might this action proposal result in additional scientific\n\npersonnel in key positions resigning and then offering to complete\n\nprojects on a consulting basis?\n\nP:19\n\n14 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nDiscuss Implementation of Action Decisions\n\nImplementing a decision is often more difficult than formulating\n\none. Dates have to be set, people have to be informed, and resources\n\nhave to be allocated to carry a decision through to completion. Every\n\ncase cannot become a term project, yet a few thoughts about\n\nimplementation should be carefully described. For instance, after\n\nreading a case about a poorly motivated sales force you might decide\n\nthat a new system of motivating salespersons should be installed.\n\nApparently inspirational talks delivered by tape cassettes and similar\n\nexhortations by sales executives have failed to stimulate sales up to\n\nthe level desired by the company. Your recommendation is to use a\n\nmore rigorous approach to motivating employees, such as expectancy\n\ntheory or behavior modification. How you are going to implement\n\nyour program is equally as important as the motivational system\n\nchosen. Are you going to unleash a task force of junior psychologists\n\nwho will travel around the country administering positive reinforcers\n\nwhenever your salespersons exhibit motivated behavior? Will you\n\ntailor-make an incentive system for every salesperson? Will you,\n\ninstead, simply coach each sales manager on techniques of employee\n\nmotivation?\n\nFinally, would you estimate that your cost of increasing motivation will exceed the profit derive from the additional sales generated\n\nby the program? Since this question is more nearly an implication\n\nthan an implementation item, it cannot be discussed until you have\n\nspeculated about problems of implementation.\n\nDevelop New Insights\n\nAside from its entertainment value, the case method has little\n\njustification unless students develop new insights into problem solving\n\nas a consequence of working with cases. New insights can be\n\ndeveloped in two primary ways via the case method. First, the person\n\ndoing the analysis might realize that the case at hand has implications\n\nfor other situations. A subordinate described in one case might\n\nrectify an unjust wage differential between himself and another\n\nindividual performing comparable work by practicing gentle confrontation. According to this basic method of resolving interpersonal\n\nconflict, the person of lower organizational rank confronts the higher\n\nranking organizational member about a mistake â in an explicit but\n\nnot harsh manner. This same method of conflict resolution may be\n\nP:20\n\nGuidelines for Case Analysis 15\n\nused by the case analyst in his or her work life, or as a method to\n\nrecommend in similar cases.\n\nSecond, new insights develop as the student attempts to use new\n\ntools of analysis or concepts to solve cases. As described earlier in\n\nthis chapter, you are urged to use a wide range of concepts in\n\nanalyzing cases. Unless you try new concepts, few new insights will\n\nemerge. Many case method courses have at least one student in the\n\nclass who insists, \\\"This is all common sense. If you use your head\n\nand treat people like human beings you can solve any management\n\nproblem.\\\" With this rigidity of thought, the student is unlikely to\n\ndevelop new insights into dealing with human problems in organizations.\n\nRarely will the student be able to comfortably implement all of\n\nthe preceding nine suggestions for case analysis. These suggestions\n\nshould be regarded as ideal standards to work toward. Other\n\nsuggestions for case analysis not described here might readily be\n\nsubstituted for some of the items on our list. References concerning\n\nthe case method are given at the end of this chapter.\n\nFORMAT OF THE CASEBOOK\n\nOur book rests upon a foundation of cases about human behavior\n\nin organizations drawn from a wide variety of settings. Cases in each\n\nchapter are chosen to illustrate concepts that fall under the particular\n\nchapter heading, but the classification is not rigid. Organizational\n\nbehavior in practice (cases are a form of practice) does not fall neatly\n\ninto non-overlapping categories. For example, a problem of faulty\n\norganizational climate could also be a problem of ineffective interpersonal communication or inappropriate leadership style.\n\nEach case is accompanied by several questions designed to focus\n\nthe student's attention upon some of the more important issues\n\nraised by the case. It is hoped that these questions add focus to the\n\ncases, but not all course instructors will elect to use these questions.\n\nMany professors and students prefer to provide their own structure\n\nto cases.\n\nA list of key references is also presented after each case chapter.\n\nThe references selected usually refer the reader to an original source\n\nabout several of the major concepts illustrated by the cases. For\n\ninstance, in a case that might profitably be analyzed by using equity\n\ntheory, the reader is referred to an article which describes equity\n\ntheory in considerable depth.\n\nP:21\n\n16 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nThe Appendix is an annotated bibliography that selectively\n\nsamples current (1970 and later) sources of information about the\n\ntopics indicated by the chapter headings. Included in this bibliography are general texts, speciality texts, anthologies and articles.\n\nThe annotations are designed to serve as guidelines for making a\n\ndecision about where to invest your supplementary reading time. All\n\nof the references themselves provide additional references. Textbooks and books of readings cited in the bibliography are also a\n\nconvenient source for locating major written contributions to the\n\nfield of organizational behavior.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAndrews, Kenneth (Ed.).

The cases are\n\nstructured under the general topics of work motivation, the human\n\nelement in decision making, stresses in managerial and professional\n\nlife, and political maneuvering in organizations. Despite the apparent\n\nlogic to this structure, the cases do not belong exclusively under any\n\none topic. For instance, \\\"The Compulsive Career Planner\\\" fits best\n\nunder the chapter on political maneuvering, but concepts of human\n\nmotivation and decision making are also helpful in analyzing this\n\ncase.\n\nAnother qualification about the classification of cases in this\n\nsection is that the study of individual behavior does not preclude the\n\nstudy of group or total organizational behavior. Every individual\n\nmust be understood in terms of the context in which he or she is\n\nfunctioning. The disgruntled sales representative described in a case\n\nin Chapter 4 would have a different problem (or no problem at all) if\n\nhe worked in a different organizational climate.\n\n17\n\nP:23\n\n2\n\nThe Motivation to Work\n\nP:24\n\nCase 1\n\nBruce, the Behavior Mod Landlord\n\nBruce Charter, a tennis professional teaching at the Seaview\n\nSwim and Tennis Club, reached a major business decision. He would\n\ninvest the $14,000 he inherited from his father in real estate. After\n\ncombing the real estate pages of the local newspapers and speaking to\n\nreal estate agents for a three-month period, Bruce decided what kind\n\nof property to purchase. With the assistance of Carol Travis, his\n\nagent, Bruce took possession of a six-family, 70-year-old frame\n\nbuilding in a low to moderate income section of the city.\n\nMargot, Bruce's girlfriend, had some reservations about this\n\nbusiness venture. She explained it this way:\n\n\\\"Bruce, friends of mine have gone into the real estate business\n\nand most of them have wound up broke. They tell me the whole\n\nthing can be a nightmare. If you don't get the right kind of tenants,\n\nthey can wreck the place.\n\n\\\"Another problem I've heard about is collecting rent. Poor\n\npeople just don't send you the rent the first of the month, right on\n\ntime as though they were worrying about getting a bad credit rating.\n\nYou'll probably be spending many of your evenings knocking on\n\ndoors trying to collect rent money that has already been spent in the\n\nneighborhood bars.\\\"\n\n\\\"Margot, I'm well aware of the stories about how landlords have\n\nfailed in their real estate ventures,\\\" said Bruce, \\\"But, I'm going to\n\ntake a scientific approach to dealing with tenants. I do the same\n\nthings with my students on the tennis court. I was never a famous\n\n20\n\nP:25\n\nThe Motivation to Work 21\n\ntennis player myself, but I'm very knowledgeable about teaching\n\npeople the right responses. My study of the psychology of learning\n\nhad made me realize that tennis coaching closely follows the\n\nprinciples of behavior modification.\\\"\n\n\\\"In what way? \\\" asked Margot.\n\n\\\"I may be oversimplifying, but it works something like this,\\\"\n\nreplied Bruce. \\\"In coaching a person about tennis, we give him or her\n\nreinforcement almost every time the right response is made. Either\n\nwe say 'nice shot' or the ball goes over the net in the right way,\n\nwhich is a reward in itself. The more I analyze Skinner's theories and\n\napply them to tennis, the stronger the association I see between\n\nreinforcement theory and tennis.\n\n\\\"When a person is an absolute beginner, he is also subject to\n\ndirect application of some of Skinner's ideas. For instance, we use\n\nsuccessive approximations. Let's say a man age 40 has decided to\n\ntake up tennis. We start him off with the simplest task imaginable.\n\nWe throw him a ball from a few feet away and have him tap it back\n\nto us â just to get the feel of the ball on the racket. It works, the guy\n\nsmiles, he's reinforced for doing something that approximates a\n\ntennis stroke. He get's a little reinforcement at every step. Usually,\n\nhe learns how to stroke a tennis ball by the end of the season.\\\"\n\n\\\"What about punishment?\\\" asked Margot. \\\"Isn't that ever used\n\nin Skinner's framework?\\\"\n\n\\\"As you know, behavior modification emphasizes praise and\n\nreward more than punishment, but punishment of a mild sort is\n\nsometimes used. One of my colleagues, Don, screams at people in a\n\ngood-natured way when they do something awful like standing facing\n\nthe net when they hit a ground stroke. Of course, seeing a ball go\n\nover the fence or dribble off the racket is punishment in itself.\\\"\n\n\\\"Bruce, I like your ideas, and I wish you the best of luck\\\" said\n\nMargot. \\\"But you're forgetting one major thing. People who take up\n\ntennis do so voluntarily. They want to learn. Some of the characters\n\nwho rent apartments in a building like the one you've bought have\n\nno interest in paying the rent, protecting their credit ratings, or in\n\npleasing you. They have no pride. Their values are warped.\\\"\n\n\\\"Margot, there is where you are wrong. In Skinner's system, you\n\ndon't have to worry about values like pride and good citizenship.\n\nY ou just manipulate the environment so you get the right response\n\nfrom people.\\\"\n\n\\\"Bruce, your analysis sounds terrific. I can't argue with logic like\n\nthat, but let's see what happens after you own the building for a\n\nwhile. I hope you do become the first Skinnerian real estate tycoon,\n\nbut I'm skeptical.\\\"\n\nP:26\n\n22 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nThirteen months later, Bruce Charter gave a verbal report of his\n\nexperiences at applying reinforcement theory to real estate management. Margot, intrigued with her boyfriend's behavioral science\n\nexperiment, suggested the case writer interview him. A full disclosure\n\nof the highlights of his experiences follows, at least to the extent that\n\nBruce was able to present an accurate picture of the events that took\n\nplace.\n\n\\\"After over one year of running the building, I would have to say\n\nthat I'm mildly encouraged. The events that have taken place\n\nduring the last year are so complex that I can't give you a categorical\n\n'Yes, it was a success,' or 'No, it was a failure,' response. It's\n\nnecessary to sort out my observations into different categories.\n\nRunning a building involves much more than collecting rents and\n\nmaking minor repairs. It's like running an enterprise all by yourself.\n\n\\\"Who your tenants are is one very important consideration. I\n\nwould assume that if you rent to people who are willing to pay $475\n\na month for housing, you have a different set of problems than if\n\nyou deal with tenants on public assistance who are paying an average\n\nof about $155 per month rent. Welfare pays the rent for all my\n\ntenants, but Welfare sends them the money. They in turn cash the\n\ncheck or mail it directly to me if their welfare payment is the same as\n\nthe rent.\n\n\\\"I'll begin my explanation of trying to use reinforcement theory\n\nat Watkins Street by telling you about the lawn mowing situation.\n\nAlthough the building is hardly a showplace, it does have a front\n\nlawn and some grass in the back yard. When I took over the building\n\nthe lawn and yard were a mess. I made the classical mistake that a lot\n\nof people in the real estate business make â I tried to appeal to the\n\npride of my tenants. I told them that they would have a much more\n\nattractive place to live in if they took it upon themselves to clean up\n\nthe yard and mow the lawn. A few of them nodded in agreement,\n\nbut they didn't seem committed to sprucing up the outside of the\n\nhouse. When no results were forthcoming from the simple approach\n\nof appealing to their pride, I made an attempt to change the natural\n\nbarriers that were preventing my tenants from having a neat and trim\n\nyard.\n\n\\\"I invested about $100 in new garbage cans, a set of clippers, and\n\na push lawn mower. I left the mower with the woman who lived in\n\none of the downstairs front apartments. My assumption was that\n\nanyone who wanted to take his or her turn mowing could use the\n\nmower without having to drag it up and down stairs. Two weeks\n\nafter I bought the garden equipment and the garbage cans, I made an\n\nP:27\n\nThe Motivation to Work 23\n\non-site inspection of the building. The lawn and yard were in\n\npassable condition, but only one garbage can out of six was in the\n\nyard. At least some progress was being made. I had successfully\n\narranged conditions so that tenants who wished too could do a better\n\nj ob of keeping the outside of the house in good shape.\n\n\\\"I praised the tenants for the appearance of the lawn and asked\n\ntheir opinion about what could be done to keep garbage cans in the\n\nyard. One tenant suggested that we use chains and a lock to keep the\n\ncans secured every day but on garbage collection day. I took care of\n\nthat condition for about $12. One night Margot and I were coming\n\nhome from a downtown movie. I drove by the property and saw that\n\nthe yard was fairly clean and that the garbage cans were intact. The\n\nnext day I wrote post cards to each of the six tenants telling them\n\nh ow pleased I was with the appearance o f the yard. According to\n\nbehaviorism, you have to tie the reward (my post card) pretty close\n\nto the response that is to be rewarded.\n\n\\\"After about two months of ownership of the property it\n\ndawned on me that it paid to take periodic trips to the building.\n\nSometimes I would duck down there in the morning before I went to\n\nthe club. One purpose of these trips was to give the tenants an\n\non-the-spot reaction to the appearance of the place. It seemed a\n\nquick transfusion of praise was enough to keep everything in passable\n\nshape for a couple of weeks. Of course, I served another function at\n\nthe same time, so we cannot say that what I was doing was 100\n\npercent behavior mod. I would spend a few minutes chatting with\n\nthe tenants and listening to the problems they were having with each\n\nother or with the plumbing and/or heating. It would be reasonable to\n\nassume that the tenants like the fact that I took a sincere interest in\n\ntheir problems.\n\n\\\"I developed a simple method of dispensing praise or disapproval.\n\nI would tell each tenant something like this, 'The porch is real clean.\n\nIt looks great. But the grass has a lot of dog droppings. What seems\n\nto be the problem?' If I bought some paint for a tenant and she did a\n\ngood jo b painting a room with it, I would buy her a few more cans of\n\npaint (if she wanted them). My approach was taking time and it\n\nseemed somewhat childlike. But, it was working.\n\n\\\"By now you must be wondering why I was turning over the\n\nsupplies to the women, and also dispensing rewards to them, rather\n\nthan also working with the male tenants. My reasoning is simple. In\n\nthese families the women call the shots. They obtain the apartment;\n\nthey pay the rent; they call when there are any problems associated\n\nwith the apartment â plumbing, heating, or screaming neighbors.\n\nP:28\n\n24 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\n\\\"Even if you were the best applied behavioral scientist in the\n\nworld, and even if you had the most sincere, trustworthy tenants\n\nimaginable, you still are left with the mechanical problems in keeping\n\nan old building running. For instance, it's inevitable that a hot water\n\nheater will blow every once in a while, or that a faucet will stop\n\nfunctioning, or that a furnace will shut off at three in the morning\n\nand not return to normal functioning. You also have to cope with\n\nsuppliers of plumbing and heating services.\n\n\\\"I try a little behavior mod in this area, too. The first people I\n\ndealt with were Conkey Heating and Plumbing, an outfit recommended to me by my real estate agent. My first hot water heater cost\n\nme $225 installed. I kind of gulped, but paid the bill without voicing\n\na complaint. Next, I called them to replace a faucet. That bill was\n\nabout $85. Again I paid the bill without complaining. The next time\n\nI had a problem, though, I switched suppliers. I told the man in\n\ncharge of Culver Plumbing and Heating that I was giving them a try\n\nbecause the people I had been using seemed to be high priced and\n\ntheir work wasn't anything exceptional. Culver installed their first\n\nhot water heater for me. I paid their bill of $175 in 48 hours.\n\n\\\"I wrote a note on the invoice, 'Thanks for your prompt and\n\nefficient work. I appreciated your fair price. Keep up the good\n\nwork.' Two weeks later another faucet went out. They replaced it for\n\n$50. Again I paid the bill promptly and wrote a note of appreciation.\n\nI intend to keep up this approach of dispensing praise and paying\n\nbills promptly. Maybe that's the kind of reward suppliers need to\n\nkeep their prices down.\n\n\\\"Rent collection, obviously, is the mainstay of the property\n\nowner's business. If you can't collect almost all of the rent due, you\n\ngo under faster than a restaurant that's been declared unsafe by the\n\nBoard of Health. Another consideration is that you can't spend too\n\nmuch time and effort collecting rent. If I have to give up a tennis\n\nlesson here and there to chase rent, owning real estate becomes very\n\nunprofitable. Also, if I have to worry about rent while I'm supposed\n\nto be coaching somebody, real estate has become a detriment to my\n\nregular work.\n\n\\\"My first step in collecting rent was to promise each tenant that\n\nshe would be eligible for a prize if she was paid to date at the end of\n\na six-month period. Four of the tenants qualified for the gifts â a\n\nchoice of clock radio, lamp, or hanging plant. All chose the clock\n\nradios which I purchased through a friend for $13 each. One of the\n\nother professionals at the club told me that he thought offering\n\npeople prizes for paying rent on time would be demeaning their\n\nP:29\n\nThe Motivation to Work 25\n\ncharacter. My experience was that each of my tenants thought I was\n\na nice guy for doing it and gladly accepted the radios. If their feelings\n\nwere hurt, they sure are good actresses.\n\n\\\"In over a one-year period I have only hand collected rent about\n\nthree times. I insist that the tenants mail the rent directly to me.\n\nWhen a rent check comes promptly, let's say within the first four\n\ndays of the month, I call the tenant to say 'Thanks for the rent. It's\n\nvery helpful to me to receive the rent on time.' I don't make the\n\nphone calls all the time; behaviorists would call this intermittent\n\nreinforcement.\n\n\\\"There are times when rent collection does not proceed swiftly\n\nor smoothly. I did have to ease one tenant out â my only bad\n\nexperience. She finally left without my having to start formal\n\neviction procedures, which has to be a landlord's last resort. It can\n\neasily cost up to $500 in legal fees, plus you don't get any rent for a\n\nminimum of two months. Nobody will send you rent if she knows\n\nabout the eviction.\n\n\\\"When a tenant is more than 10 days late with the rent, I\n\ntelephone her a few times to describe the gravity of the situation.\n\nWhen tenants are behind on their rent, they may not answer\n\nthe phone or one of their children may answer and tell you 'She isn't\n\nhome.' People are hard to locate when they fall behind on the rent.\n\nSo I try my stern letter â a form of punishment to be used only in\n\nemergencies. My recent collection letter goes something like this:\n\nDear Mrs. Gray:\n\nY ou are now 15 days late in your rent. That means the bank\n\nwill fine me for being late. When the tenants don't pay the rent,\n\nthe cost of running this building goes up. That will mean higher\n\nrents for everybody.\n\nIf you do not pay your rent on time you will have to leave\n\nmy building. I like you and your family and I want you to stay\n\nas long as you pay the rent.\n\nCall me right away. This situation is very important.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBruce Charter\n\nLandlord\n\n244-4048\n\n\\\"There are times when I have to use unusual rewards to get a\n\ntenant back on track with respect to paying the rent. Audrey\n\nP:30\n\n26 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nThompson, a woman in her fifties, is a hardworking person. She's on\n\npublic assistance, but she also takes care of elderly people in their\n\nhomes as well as raising her own three children. If she were a better\n\norganized person, she might not be in her present predicament. Her\n\ndisorganization shows up in the fact that she is chronically late with\n\nher rent, despite her good intentions. It would be hard for me to live\n\nwith myself if I evicted this woman and her family.\n\n\\\"Two months ago, Mrs. Thompson had slipped behind in her\n\npayments so that she owed me the December and her current rent â\n\nover $300. She kept telling me that she would be caught up soon,\n\nbut she could never quite get up that past due rent from the month\n\nof December. I decided to offer her a substantial reward if she would\n\nget caught up with her rent. I told her that if she paid up the rent I\n\nwould give her a sofa in good condition. (I was contemplating\n\npurchasing a new sofa, so I could easily afford to give her my present\n\nliving room sofa.) Mrs. Thompson made arrangements with her\n\nminister who owned a car to drive her to my apartment to pick up\n\nthe sofa. She arrived 24 hours late, but she did bring $300 in small\n\nbills with her. She thanked me profusely for the sofa and for having\n\nbeen so patient.\n\n\\\"When I told Margot about the incident, she said, 'Good play,\n\nBruce, but what do you do next month when you don't have another\n\nsofa to give Mrs. Thompson? How will you collect your rent then?' I\n\nhope that Margot isn't missing the point of what I'm doing.\\\"\n\nQuestions\n\n1. What is your reaction to the statement \\\".. . what do you do next\n\nmonth when you don't have another sofa to give Mrs. Thompson? How will you collect your rent then?\\\"\n\n2. What explanation can you offer other than reinforcement theory\n\nfor the good results that Bruce Charter seems to be obtaining?\n\n3. To what extent do you think Bruce is \\\"manipulating people\\\"?\n\n4. What other approaches to motivating the tenants to pay rent and\n\nkeep the grounds clean would you recommend that Bruce try?\n\n5. How appropriate do you think the management approach\n\ndescribed in this case might be for managing a large apartment\n\ncomplex with tenants from higher socioeconomic groups?\n\nP:31\n\nCase 2\n\nThe Elusive Quota *\n\n\\\" If you'll excuse the pun,\\\" said Kevin Graham, \\\"I'll tell you\n\nabout a sales team in the metal industry that is all bent out of shape.\n\nSince I am one of the salesman involved, I may be distorting some of\n\nthe facts. Perhaps even placing too much blame on management. In\n\nany event, I will try to present a description of what happened in as\n\nobjective a manner as possible.\n\n\\\"The packaging division of a large aluminum producer, Vital\n\nMetals, Inc., is organized into five geographical areas for sales purposes.\n\nEach of these major areas is, in turn, subdivided into smaller\n\nunits called districts. Each district follows a traditional sales office\n\narrangement. Four or five sales personnel (up until the last few years\n\nvirtually all Vital Metal field sales people were male) plus an office\n\nsecretary report to a sales manager. Sales service personnel, including\n\ntroubleshooters and sales engineers, are located at the regional level.\n\nIn general, field sales personnel receive adequate support from the\n\nregion when sticky customer problems arise. Shipments are a major\n\nproblem in our industry, but thanks to a sophisticated inventory\n\ncontrol and order entry system, our customers seem to get what\n\nproducts they want at the time they want them.\n\n\\\"Let me explain about the compensation plan. Here is what my\n\nstory is really about. The sales people are salaried, but each salesman\n\nâ¢John H. Gooch conducted the research for this case and is responsible for\n\nmost of its writing.\n\n27\n\nP:32\n\n28 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nor saleswoman can increase his or her total remuneration by means\n\nof the company incentive plan. This plan provides a bonus, payable\n\nat the end of the year, based upon how well the sales district as a\n\nwhole performs against a quota. This quota is a dollar volume sales\n\nfigure. For every percentage point over 85 percent of quota that the\n\ndistrict achieves, each sales person within the district receives one\n\npercent of his average yearly salary up to a maximum of 33-1/3\n\npercent. Therefore, in a good year, a salesman on a $20,000 annual\n\nsalary might receive a $4000 bonus â a sizeable chunk of change. If\n\nthe maximum were reached, this same person might gross close to\n\n$27,000 for the year, including bonus.\n\n\\\"Early in the year the sales manager for the Hartford, Connecticut sales district called his five salesmen together (we had no\n\nsaleswomen in that district at the time) to announce what sales quota\n\nhad been received from headquarters. Although slightly higher than\n\nexpected, the district members enthusiastically went about formulating plans to achieve the maximum payoff. Due to some unfortunate circumstances leading to a loss of several large orders the\n\nprevious year, the last payoff was rather disappointing. Two of our\n\nbiggest customers had major contract cancellations, forcing them to\n\ncancel orders with us. As frequently happens with sales people,\n\nseveral of us had already spent the bonus that we never received. It's\n\nnot unusual for a salesman to purchase a color TV he cannot afford\n\non the way home from a customer's agreement to place a big order.\n\nLater when the customer changes his mind, the salesman may be\n\noverburdened with debt.\n\n\\\"Every salesman in our office was determined to make up for the\n\nprevious year's mediocre performance. Target accounts that had\n\nbetter than average potential were singled out for special effort.\n\nObstacles were identified and strategies developed to overcome them.\n\nEach of our salesmen left that initial meeting eager to do his part in\n\norder for the district to meet its goals. The feeling quickly developed\n\nthat the result of the added effort would be the maximum allowable\n\nbonus at the end of the year for each member of the sales team.\n\nTony, a veteran with the company, expressed it this way, Î was\n\nbeginning to wonder where I could come up with the cash to send\n\nmy oldest daughter to college. Our new quota may be the answer.'\n\n\\\"The district jumped off to an excellent start by landing several\n\ntarget accounts right away. At the end of the first quarter, another\n\nsales meeting was called. According to the figures presented, the\n\ngroup was already ahead of forecast. The nation's economy was in\n\none of its periodic upsurges. As the economy expanded at a rapid\n\nP:33\n\nThe Motivation to Work 29\n\npace, the demand for aluminum products far exceeded the available\n\nsupply.\n\n\\\"These prosperous conditions remained almost unchanged until\n\nlate in the summer when a slackening in demand became apparent.\n\nAlmost as though a spigot was turned off, early in the fourth quarter\n\nthe economy seemed to come to a crunching halt. Order delays and\n\ncancellations poured in as customers frantically tried to react to the\n\nnew situation. Although the fall-off in demand was having a significant effect on the Hartford district's sales, they were far enough\n\nahead of quota at that point to coast the rest of the way.\n\n\\\"Suddenly, in early December, top management announced that\n\ndue to the need to compensate for the extraordinary inflationary\n\npressure experienced during the year, all of the quotas would be\n\nrevised upward. Unbelievably, our targets had shifted right in the\n\nmiddle of the game. The quotas that everyone had been shooting for\n\nall year long were changed. Nobody on the sales force believed\n\nsomething like this would happen. Although the incentive plan\n\nallowed management to make such adjustments, it had never done so\n\nbefore.\n\n\\\"Unanimous reaction to this decision was astonishment, frustration, and anger. Chris, the youngest salesman in the office, lamented:\n\n'It's as if management was looking for a good way to turn us away\n\nfrom the company. I've heard before that sometimes a company wrill\n\nmake life unbearable for people in order to get them to resign. I\n\nwonder if that's what's happening here?'\n\n\\\"Although the Hartford District finished the year only slightly\n\nbelow the original quota, after the adjustment was made each man\n\nreceived only about half the bonus he had anticipated. It was as if\n\nsomebody learned that management had been putting pollutants in\n\nthe water cooler. The effect this management action had on sales\n\nforce morale was drastic. It became obvious that salesmen stopped\n\nhustling as much as they had previously. Quotas for this year haven't\n\nbeen assigned yet, although nearly half of the year is already past.\n\n\\\"More surprising than the fact that quotas haven't been assigned\n\nis that nobody seems particularly disturbed about it. Quotas used to\n\nbe the major topic of conversation every year. The group incentive\n\nplan seems to have completely lost its usefulness as a tool to increase\n\nsales. No longer do the salesmen feel reasonably sure that hard work\n\nwill lead to the promised bonuses.\n\n\\\"It's my analysis that top management will have to start all over\n\nagain and come up with a new incentive plan. Even then it will take a\n\nlot of selling before the salesmen will have faith in the new incentive\n\nsystem.\n\nP:34\n\n30 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nA lot of damage has already been done.\n\n\\\"What I find so puzzling about the changes in our incentive\n\nsystem is that top management doesn't believe anything is wrong. A\n\nmarketing executive who visited our office told us, 'Yo u fellows have\n\nto learn to roll with the punches. We can only stick with a plan until\n\nconditions change. Inflation has made it necessary for us to adjust\n\nour sales quotas. We're still running a business around here.' \\\"\n\nQuestions\n\n1. What might management have done to prevent the negative\n\nreaction to changing the sales quotas?\n\n2. Did Vital Metals management overemphasize financial incentives\n\nin dealing with their sales personnel? Explain your answer.\n\n3. Should management have changed quotas despite the impact of\n\ninflation?\n\n4. Does management now need a new incentive plan for its sales\n\npersonnel?\n\n5. What should be done to get salesmen \\\"moving again\\\" (remotivate\n\nthe sales force)?\n\nP:35\n\nCase 3\n\nWhy Do I Need a License\n\nto Get Ahead? *\n\nEngineer Kurt Hayes, after many years of industrial experience,\n\nis now employed by the state government. Aged 37, he has a wife\n\nand two children. His bachelor's degree in electrical engineering was\n\nobtained from Purdue University. Although an engineering supervisor, he is also involved in some design work in his field. He is well\n\nregarded by his superiors, as reflected in his performance appraisals.\n\nKurt left private industry in a quest for job security. A victim of\n\ntwo layoffs in previous years, he felt he could not risk another layoff\n\nat this time in his career.\n\nThe company for which Kurt worked prior to his joining the\n\ngovernmental agency did not require a Professional Engineering\n\nLicense (P.E.) for job advancement. Such licensure was recognized,\n\nhowever, in that Professional Engineers commanded higher starting\n\nsalaries than engineers who did not possess that designation. However, an individual who did not hold a P.E. could advance on the\n\nbasis of his or her performance record.\n\nKurt worked for the State Engineering Authority for three years.\n\nThe S.E.A. involves itself in all phases of engineering for a city of\n\n400,000 population. The technical personnel employed by the\n\nagency includes engineering aides, and various technical and professional classifications. A person may rise to the highest level of the\n\n* Peter L. Grassadonia conducted the research for this case.\n\n31\n\nP:36\n\n32 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\ntechnical classification without a college degree, but a bachelor's\n\ndegree in engineering is required for further advancement. A \\\"college\n\ndegreed\\\" engineer is allowed to advance one step beyond the\n\ntechnical level classification, but the agency requires a Professional\n\nEngineering license for promotion to the highest level. An exception\n\nto the P.E. requirement exists at the top of the organization. Several\n\nsenior executives in the Agency have advanced to the top without\n\nthe benefit of P.E. licensure.\n\nGovernmental agencies performing similar kinds of work to the\n\nengineering agency (and the medical departments) do not have\n\nlicensing requirements for advancement beyond the technical classifications. Employees of those agencies (such as city planning and\n\nspecialized administrative functions) interface with engineering on\n\nalmost a daily basis.\n\nKurt Hayes expresses his thoughts about his compensation in this\n\nmanner: \\\"My input in terms of dreaming up successful designs,\n\nholding up my own on routine engineering work, and still running a\n\ngood sized department is worth a lot more than the money I receive.\n\nMy job is good, even exciting at times, but I am very discouraged\n\nabout the pay I'm receiving. There are actually other engineers in this\n\nagency who hold the same job title as I do, yet they are doing less\n\nwork and have less formal responsibility.\n\n\\\"What really gets to me though is the handful of people with P.E.\n\ncertificates hanging on their walls with bigger jobs than mine, yet\n\nthey are doing less important work than I do. One P.E. only supervises two people and he rates a higher job classification than I do.\n\n\\\"I never pursued a P.E. license because it is viewed as somewhat\n\nof a frill in a business environment. Right now I'm blocked from\n\nfurther advancement in S.E.A. Yet there is an urgent need for people\n\nof my abilities at higher levels in the agency. The way I see it, a\n\nqualified person should be allowed to travel as far up the organization as his talents will take him.\n\n\\\"My immediate superior, Gus, and I have gone round and round\n\non this issue. I've told Gus that the agency is really using a double\n\nstandard here. Some people in key positions do not have P.E.\n\ncertification. Gus tells me the reasoning behind the license is to give\n\nassurance by examination and state approval that a person so\n\nlicensed be qualified to certify a design and the integrity of that\n\ndesign. Kind of a quality control function.\n\n\\\"My point of contention is that it seems superfluous to have\n\npeople reporting to a supervisor with the ability to certify when the\n\nsupervisor himself has that ability. In fact, the supervisor has to seal\n\nP:37\n\nThe Motivation to Work 33\n\neach project personally anyway. Other agencies comparable to ours\n\nin professional status do not have this requirement. They don't\n\nthrow roadblocks to advancement in those agencies.\n\n\\\"All I get is aggravation from discussions about this topic with\n\nGus. He gives me the bureaucratic routine. Something to the effect\n\nthat the certification of professionals is the criteria set up by the\n\norganization. According to Gus, certification as a Professional\n\nEngineer as a precondition for advancement is part of the system in\n\nevery state governmental agency that employs engineers. He tells me\n\nthat policies such as these must be strictly adhered to.\n\n\\\"I wonder if Gus or anybody else who outranks me in this\n\nagency really understands my point. Although I swore to myself and\n\nmy family that I would never consider relocation again, I must give\n\nsome serious thought to exploring the options available to me\n\noutside of the State Engineering Authority.\\\"\n\nQuestions\n\n1. What would you advise Kurt Hayes to do next?\n\n2. What is the essential inequity that Kurt Hayes perceives?\n\n3. What should Gus do to recapture Kurt's enthusiasm for the job?\n\n4. Should the State Engineering Authority change its policy about\n\nthe P.E. license as a qualification for advancement? Explain your\n\nreasoning.\n\n5. Should the State Engineering Authority provide support for\n\nobtaining the P.E. license such as offering to pay for refresher\n\ncourses for the exam?

Several days overdue, this\n\nletter could be the turning point in Olafs quest for a more challenging job. He turned his back toward his wife and children in order to\n\nmore carefully attend to the contents of the letter. Olafs feelings\n\nturned from eagerness to bewilderment as he worked his way down\n\nthe letter. It read:\n\nDear Mr. Scher:\n\nMy staff and I at Southwestern were favorably impressed\n\nwith your qualifications for employment as Manager of Manufacturing Services, and we appreciate having had the opportunity to interview you for this position. However, a decision like\n\nthis is not an easy one to make. We finally decided to fill this\n\nopening with an individual whose background more closely fits\n\nthe job description.\n\nWe will be back in touch with you should a new position\n\nopen up here that more closely fits your qualifications. Best of\n\nluck in obtaining the right position for yourself.\n\nCordially,\n\nMarshall Goulden\n\nVice President, Manufacturing\n\n36\n\nP:41\n\nBehavioral Aspects of Decision Making 37\n\nAfter shaking off the initial feelings of discouragement, Olaf gave\n\nsome careful thought to this latest letter of rejection. He reasoned\n\nthat Marshall Goulden's letter could not be an accurate description\n\nof the reason he was turned down for Manager of Manufacturing\n\nServices. The job represented a one step jump in responsibility over\n\nhis present position. In discussing the job with the President and the\n\nManufacturing Vice President, both were pleased that he had relevant\n\nexperience in every manufacturing function that would report to\n\nhim. Besides, one of Goulden's initial comments was how pleased he\n\nwas with Olafs work experience â that it represented the kind of\n\n\\\"hands on \\\" exposure the company needed in this job.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, Olaf telephoned Marshall Goulden\n\nthe next day. To his surprise, Goulden did not seem to avoid his call.\n\nOlaf began the conversation.\n\n\\\"Marshall, this is Olaf Scher. I was somewhat disappointed by\n\nyour letter of rejection. Somehow it doesn't satisfy me. I guess you\n\ncould say I don't buy it completely.\\\"\n\n\\\"Gee, that's too bad,\\\" replied Marshall, \\\"we could only fill that\n\nj ob with one person, as much as we liked you as a person.\\\"\n\n\\\"My concern is not so much that I didn't get the job, \\\" said Olaf.\n\n\\\"What I'm worried about is the reason you rejected me. It's just hard\n\nto understand. Could I possibly make an appointment to see you\n\nabout this matter?\\\"\n\nMarshall Goulden obliged, and Olaf and he met in Goulden's\n\noffice two days later. Olaf decided he would not hold back any of his\n\nconcerns since no chance remained of his obtaining the position as\n\nManager of Manufacturing Services at Southwestern Metal Products.\n\n\\\"Marshall, could you please tell me, off the record, why I was\n\nturned down for this position? I promise not to pass our conversation on to anybody else.\\\"\n\n\\\"Olaf, you were turned down because we found somebody else\n\nwith reasonably stronger qualifications than yours for the job. Isn't\n\nthat what we told you in the letter?\\\"\n\n\\\"Yes, that is what you told me in the letter, but it is not very\n\nconvincing. I've ruminated over that one for three days now, and the\n\nreason just doesn't hold water.\\\"\n\n\\\"As you know from your own business experience, Olaf, there is\n\nnever only one reason for giving a job to one person over another. It\n\nis possible that another thought might have passed through the minds\n\nof Jay (the President) and myself. But basically we did find somebody with experience as Manager of Manufacturing Services at a\n\ncompetitive company.\\\"\n\nP:42\n\n38 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\n\\\"Marshall, let's level with each other. It appeared that you and I\n\ngot along well in the interviews and during my plant tours. Everything seemed to be all set in terms of my getting this job. It wouldn't\n\nbe so disturbing to me except that this is the second fine job that has\n\nslipped through my fingers this year. I've got to know if I'm doing\n\nsomething wrong.\\\"\n\n\\\" T o my knowledge, you are not doing anything wrong,\\\"\n\nresponded Marshall. \\\"Yo u have a pretty good background; I would\n\nsay there is not too much for you to worry about. Maybe you will\n\nhave better luck next time.\\\"\n\nOlaf replied, \\\"Marshall, do me a favor. Review my file with me\n\nhere and now. I know that if I wanted to get testy about it, I would\n\nhave the legal right to see all the information you have collected\n\nabout me. But instead of my using a legalistic method, how about\n\nyour giving me the information I want on a friendly, informal basis?\\\"\n\n\\\"Okay, Olaf. Let's do this systematically. I'm kind of interested\n\nin what goes into a selection decision myself. First, here is your\n\napplication blank listing a lot of vital information about you. It looks\n\npretty good, and your experience is certainly appropriate for the\n\njob. \\\"\n\n\\\"That's just what I thought,\\\" interrupted Olaf. \\\"I'll bet it was\n\nthe psychologist's report. She and I seemed to get along well during\n\nthe interview, but maybe she came up with some unusual finding on\n\nthe test results.\\\"\n\n\\\"No, \\\" said Marshall, \\\"her summary report says that you are well\n\nqualified for the job and she recommended you. \\\"\n\n\\\"What about the impressions that you, the President, and the\n\nPersonnel Manager had of me? Was there anything too deviant\n\nthere?\\\"\n\n\\\"On the contrary,\\\" answered Marshall, \\\"yo u made a favorable\n\nimpression across the board. However, a selection decision has to also\n\nconsider background factors about a person. These days you have to\n\ncheck out everything. Any serious red flag, and we are obliged to\n\nturn down a job candidate.\\\"\n\n\\\"Are you getting to the truth now, Marshall? Did you uncover\n\nany 'red flags' about me. I'd sure like to know what they are. To my\n\nknowledge, I have a fine background. My military service was undistinguished, but I had no trouble. I have no criminal record. My\n\nfurniture or car has never been repossessed. What are you talking\n\nabout?\\\"\n\n\\\"Sometimes, Olaf, we have to rely on outside information to give\n\nus a full picture about a job candidate. We are not in a position to\n\nP:43\n\nBehavioral Aspects of Decision Making 39\n\nchallenge the type of sensitive information that such a report can\n\nfurnish.\\\"\n\n\\\"What are you talking about?\\\" Olaf anxiously asked. \\\"What kind\n\nof sensitive information have you uncovered about me? I just can't\n\nimagine what in my background could fit the category of sensitive\n\ninformation.\\\"\n\n\\\"Your Consumer Reference Bureau report was not very favorable,\\\" replied Marshall. \\\"There was some information there that\n\nmade us think twice about hiring you. It was nothing criminal, just\n\nsome indicators that perhaps we should look further for another\n\ncandidate.\\\"\n\n\\\"Now that we've gone this far, Marshall, please let me see those\n\nreports. I'm very skeptical that Consumer Reference Bureau could\n\nhave anything derogatory about me in their files.\\\"\n\n\\\"Let me read you exactly what they found. A field investigator\n\nprepared a fresh report about you, so we figure it's current. We use\n\nthem in hiring just about every employee in this company. We have\n\nfound them to be reliable.\\\"\n\nMarshall pulled an orange-colored report from Olafs preemployment folder. He slowly read the derogatory findings to Olaf.\n\n\\\"One neighbor reports that although Mr. Scher is a good family\n\nman, he is known to date women other than his wife, somewhat on a\n\nregular basis. It has been rumored that the Sehers may split because\n\nof this. It is also rumored that Mrs. Scher would want a substantial\n\nsettlement from Mr. Scher, putting him in an unfavorable financial\n\nposition should the divorce or legal separation come to pass.\n\n\\\" A former business associate reports that Scher can become argumentative if he has one drink too many. Once they were asked to\n\nleave a restaurant because of Scher's boisterous behavior.\n\n\\\"Jefferson Appliance Store says that they were in dispute with\n\nScher over payments for a color T.V. He refused to make the last few\n\npayments until they replaced a major tube. They claim that this was\n\nnot part of the warranty.\n\n\\\"Home Finance Corporation contends that he did not repay his\n\nfull loan because of a dispute over the amount of interest charged.\\\"\n\nOlaf responded with a smile that partially covered his anger.\n\n\\\"Come now, Mr. Goulden, you don't take those reports from the\n\nConsumer Reference Bureau seriously. A cousin of mine used to\n\nwork for them before she quit in disgust. She told me two very\n\ninteresting facts about them. For one, the field reporters are so overworked that they fictionalize many of their reports just to keep up\n\nwith the work load. They sit at their desks and make up things about\n\nP:44\n\n40 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\npeople, figuring that the person being investigated will never get to\n\nsee the report.\n\n\\\"Even worse, they operate a little like highway state troopers are\n\nalleged to operate. They have a certain quota of negative information\n\nto turn up per week, just as the troopers have to turn in a few\n\nspeeding violators. The way Consumer Reference Bureau figures, if\n\nthey never turn up any negative information about people, they will\n\nlose their customers. Maybe I got zapped because the investigator\n\nwas overdue to write a negative report.\n\n\\\"What concerns me as much as the fact that I didn't get this job\n\nis the weight you put on these cockamamie reports. What is society\n\ncoming to? Can backyard gossip condemn me? \\\"\n\nQuestions\n\n1. How much emphasis should the executives at Southwestern\n\nMetals have placed upon the Consumer Reference report?\n\n2. What should Marshall Goulden have done after he listened to\n\nOlaf Scher's comments about the Consumer Reference Bureau?\n\n3. What emphasis should be placed upon background checks in\n\nmaking management selection decisions?\n\n4. What should Olaf do about the negative report about him on file\n\nat the Consumer Reference Bureau?\n\n5. Would you consider the information obtained by the Consumer\n\nReference Bureau to be objective or subjective information?\n\nExplain.\n\nP:45\n\nCase 5\n\nCreativity Requires\n\nthe Right Atmosphere\n\n\\\"Mr. Farnsworth, tell me about the size of your business,\\\" said\n\nHoney Levine, business reporter for a nationally circulated trade\n\nmagazine. \\\"Actually how big is the Maxwell restaurant chain?\\\"\n\n\\\"My latest estimate is that our total annual sales volume is at the\n\nrate of $890 million. That's approaching $1 billion, and the figure\n\nimproves every day. We are a worldwide operation, with outlets\n\nthroughout the non-communist world. But we are concentrated in\n\nthe United States, Canada, and Western Europe. As of this morning\n\nwe had 2300 outlets. By this afternoon we will probably have added\n\none or two more outlets. We are a moving, pulsating, dynamic,\n\nexploding operation. It is a true figure that over seven billion Maxwell Mini-Subs have been consumed by people.\\\"\n\n\\\"Mr. Farns worth, we in the business writers community cannot\n\nhelp but admire the success of your empire. We recognize that the\n\nfailure rate is very high in the fast food franchise business. Could you\n\nspeculate about the factors that underly the success of your\n\nbusiness?\\\"\n\n\\\"Honey, I do not have to speculate. I know the reasons for our\n\nsuccess. It's a simple case of creativity. Our small corporate staff is\n\nvery creative. You have to be creative to prosper in this field.\n\nApplied creativity is undoubtedly the number one success factor in\n\nour business. I'll give you a few examples of the creative approaches\n\nwe have used to promote our Mini-Subs, Maxade, and the total concept of our restaurants.\n\n41\n\nP:46\n\n42 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\n'On e simple, but effective, example is our 'Q.S.T.' campaign.\n\nEvery employee of our firm, from Maxwell Farns worth down to the\n\nminimum wage floor mopper, wears a button whose initials signify\n\nour business motto: Quality, Service, Tidiness. And let me assure\n\nyou, we are tidy around Maxwell's. Our team of field inspectors\n\nmakes sure that every Maxwell location and every Maxwell employee\n\nis tidy looking. Anybody with an open sore is sent home for the day,\n\nusually with pay. Our refuse cans are shiny white enamel. Our dumpsters out back are also shiny and white. We will take a franchise away\n\nfrom an operator who violates our Q.S.T. code. It's written into the\n\noriginal contract.\n\n\\\"Our Mini-Sub University is also a creative concept. We train\n\npotential franchise operators on every last detail of our operation.\n\nPeople take our course work quite seriously in their 10-day program\n\nat our university headquarters. Everybody leaving here knows the\n\nprecise thickness of the slice of ham, and every other ingredient that\n\ngoes into a Maxwell Mini-Sub. They also know exactly how many\n\nshakes of oil are placed on top of the open sub. It's a precision\n\noperation. We want to insure that the Kansas City school teacher\n\nwho visits Honolulu will be guaranteed a Maxwell sub there as tasty\n\nas the one she gets back in Kansas City.\n\n\\\"Perhaps our creativity reaches its greatest heights in our special\n\npromotions. In our business you need an ever changing number of\n\npromotions and special events. A Maxwell shop should be a happening, a place to go for excitement and adventure. One very successful promotion was 'Grandparent Day.' Every grandparent, accompanied by his or her grandchild or grandchildren on a given\n\nWednesday from opening to closing, could order a sub for 10^.\n\nGrandparent Day was a huge success. We wound up capturing a lot of\n\nthe senior citizen business. Most chain restaurants make no special\n\nattempt to attract older people.\n\n\\\"The wildest promotion we ever had was in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nOne of our executives selected Columbus as the site for trying out a\n\n'Mini-Sub Submariner Look-Alike Contest.' Submariner, of course,\n\ngets right at the nostalgia kick. He was a superhero of the original\n\nBatman era. The three kids our judges decided looked the most like\n\nSubmariner received a $50 gift certificate at Maxwell's. We received a\n\ngood deal of T.V. and newspaper publicity on the basis of that\n\npromotion. A couple of local disc jockeys and Miss Ohio State\n\njudged the contestants.\\\"\n\n\\\"Maxwell, it's important for me to comment here that rumor has\n\nit you use very unconventional methods to bring about creativity in\n\nyour staff. Is that true?\\\"\n\nP:47\n\nBehavioral Aspects of Decision Making 43\n\n\\\"Honey, that is absolutely correct. Most people are not creative.\n\nThat means that you have to set up the right atmosphere to induce\n\ncreativity. Suppose I just issued a corporate directive that I wanted\n\neverybody to be creative in their jobs. Predictably, the response\n\nwould be zilch. You need specialized techniques. All of our\n\napproaches to bringing about creativity are not unique, but some are.\n\n\\\"Our corporate Think Tank is certainly unique. When an executive has a creative assignment, he or she is urged to give our Tank a\n\ntry. It consists mainly of a huge waterbed, some 12 feet in diameter\n\nat the bottom of a tank. The executive is supposed to lie on the bed\n\nalone until he or she comes up with a creative solution to the problem at hand. It seems to me that our Grandparent Day promotional\n\nstunt came out of the Think Tank. Even when an executive does not\n\nget the idea that he or she is seeking right away, it tends to clear\n\none's head for later problems. Twenty minutes in the Think Tank\n\nand you are refreshed. Something like Transcendental Meditation.\n\n\\\" A very popular creativity inducing technique is our head\n\nmassage. We have a young woman who gives an executive a gentle\n\nhead massage in the privacy of his own office. So far no woman\n\ncorporate staff executive has availed herself of this service. Melinda,\n\nthe woman we call in for the massages, claims that the massaging\n\nstimulates the passage of blood through the brain cells, thus energizing one's thinking capacity. I find that the experience certainly\n\ndoes clear the mind. It seems to erase distracting thoughts.\n\n\\\"Another approach to bringing about creativity similar to the\n\nThink Tank, is our No Distraction Room. Some call it solitary confinement. We have a room about 20 feet square, with pastel blue\n\nwalls, and no furniture in it but a wire chair, something like what\n\ny ou might find in an old-fashioned candy parlor. According to the\n\nrules we have established, the executive entering this room is forced\n\nto concentrate on the problem at hand. No telephone messages, no\n\ndistracting gazes at the outside world. It seems to work. Our special\n\nholiday promotion of subs in Christmas gift wrapping paper came\n\nout of the No Distraction Room. \\\"\n\nHoney Levine, not content to base her story entirely on the\n\nperceptions of the company president, requested that she be allowed\n\nto interview a few executives to get their ideas on Maxwell Famsworth's approach to fostering creativity. Howard Boyle, Vice President of Field Inspection had praise for Maxwell's unconventional\n\napproach to eliciting creativity from his subordinates.\n\n\\\"It would be fair to say that Maxwell is on to something important. Without his extra special emphasis on using your creativity, you\n\nP:48\n\n44 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\ncould easily get trapped into solving every business problem in a\n\nmechanical way. When you're rushing from meeting to meeting, it's\n\nhard to be creative. Before Farnsworth came up with the Think Tank\n\nidea, I used to do all my thinking at home. I figured you didn't have\n\ntime to think on the job. But thinking at home wasn't all that easy\n\neither. There are all kinds of distractions at home also. If you aren't\n\nshuffling papers other people in the family think you aren't working.\n\nPeople somehow don't equate thinking with working.\n\n\\\"Now, thinking is a formalized activity at the office. You are\n\ngiven a separate place to think in an atmosphere that helps you\n\nbecome creative. I wouldn't be surprised if Maxwell Farnsworth goes\n\ndown in history as the man who brought creativity to the fast food\n\nbusiness.\\\"\n\nAn executive who asked Honey Levine for anonymity had\n\nanother view of the creativity inducing programs at Maxwell's MiniSubs: \\\"Face it, this is a modern day reenactment of the fairy tale,\n\n'The Emperor's New Clothes.' In that story everybody knew that the\n\nEmperor was mistaken, that he was really naked and not dressed in\n\nfancy clothing, but nobody would face up to the fact. Maxwell\n\nFarns worth is a great guy, but his ideas on making executives creative\n\nare far-fetched. People go along with his ideas ot make him happy. I\n\nwould venture to say that nobody would enter the Think Tank or\n\nthe No Distraction Room if nobody was around to observe them\n\nenter. They would simply take their little problem back to their\n\noffice and work out a solution.\n\n\\\"What really happens with Maxwell's gimmicks is that people go\n\nthrough the motion of entering the Think Tank or receiving the head\n\nmassage just to humor Farns worth. If they do come up with a workable idea in one of those creativity sessions, it has to be refined\n\nfurther anyway. The person coming up with the idea usually then\n\ntakes it to a few others to refine it in group discussions.\n\n\\\"It might even be that going off to a formal creativity exercise is\n\ncounterproductive. Although I certainly do enjoy having an attractive woman stroke my head, I could think of a better way to finance\n\nthe expansion of Mini-Sub shops without having her fingers run\n\nthrough my hair.\\\"\n\nQuestions\n\n1. Should the dissenting executive confront Maxwell Farns worth\n\nwith his perception of the effectiveness of the company creativity training program? Why or why not?\n\nP:49\n\nBehavioral Aspects of Decision Making 45\n\n2. What factors (related to the Maxwell Mini-Sub Company) other\n\nthan the creativity inducing techniques may be eliciting creative\n\nbehavior from company executives?\n\n3. In what ways might these creativity training sessions be counterproductive?\n\n4. One of Maxwell Farns worth's former executives described him as\n\n\\\"An old cornball who lucked out. His creativity bit is just hogwash.\\\" Based on the limited information provided in this case,\n\nwhat is your opinion of the preceding statement?\n\n5. What approach would you recommend that Mr. Farnsworth (or\n\nhis subordinates) use to determine if the creativity inducing techniques are functional to the organization?\n\nP:50\n\nCase 6\n\nBaton Rouge is a\n\nLong Way From Home*\n\nAs an electrical design engineer with Surety Electronics, I'm\n\nfaced with making at least one important decision every day at work.\n\nEach decision is unique, but all follow the same format. I do what I\n\ncan to clearly identify the problem in my mind, search for innovative\n\nways to solve the problem, mull over each one of these alternatives\n\ncarefully, and make a choice. Within three months I'm able to discover if I made a good or bad decision from a technical and/or\n\nbusiness standpoint. Recently, I faced a decision relating to my work\n\nthat at the time appeared much more complex than an engineering\n\ndesign problem. My family and my future would be touched by the\n\noutcome of this decision.\n\nOne Monday night a few months ago, I was sitting at home\n\nrelaxing and watching television. The children had been tucked into\n\nbed, the bills had been paid, and no emergency repairs were necessary around the house. In fact, things seemed unusually tranquil.\n\nSuddenly, the phone rang. Terry, an old college and fraternity friend\n\nI hadn't seen or heard from in about four years, was calling from\n\nBaton Rouge, Louisiana. For the first five minutes we exchanged the\n\nusual social amenities; he asked how I was doing and I asked how he\n\nwas doing. Finally, Terry got to the point of why he had phoned. He\n\n* Ronald A. Luchetti researched and wrote this case, with the exception of a\n\nfew editorial changes.\n\n46\n\nP:51\n\nBehavioral Aspects of Decision Making 47\n\nwanted to know if I might be interested in a job with his employer,\n\nBaton Rouge Enterprises, Inc.\n\nMy first reaction was that he was joking. As the conversation\n\ncontinued, I began to take him seriously. Terry's company needed an\n\nelectrical engineer to design and develop some automated machinery\n\nto manufacture the line of home power tools they wanted to sell.\n\nThe type of work was identical in many ways to the work I was\n\npresently doing and which I found satisfying. Baton Rouge Enterprises was a small company, but their line of home power tools was\n\nselling well beyond expectations. According to their analysis, the\n\nonly way they could keep pace with customer demand was to install\n\nautomated, faster machinery to produce the product line. Up to this\n\npoint, they had no electrical engineers on the staff; they were looking for one, and I was their first candidate. For many years, I had\n\nwondered what it would be like to be the \\\"resident electrical\n\nengineer\\\" in a small, promising company. From what I had heard,\n\nthat kind of situation often leads the way to a vice presidency.\n\nDespite the appeal of the position, I told Terry I couldn't take\n\nthe jo b because I liked my present one so well. Also, it would affect\n\nmy family if we just picked up and moved to Louisiana. We would be\n\nfarther from our families than we were in our present location of\n\nIndianapolis. Terry insisted that I at least consider the job. Partly out\n\nof curiosity and partly out of courtesy, I said I would give the\n\nproposition some thought and would get back to him with my\n\nrequirements for salary, vacation, relocation expenses, and job\n\nsecurity. There I was, faced with a more complex problem than\n\nalmost any problem I faced at work.\n\nMy wife, Loretta, and I discussed the offer that seemed like a\n\ngolden opportunity. She told me to do what I wanted, but I knew\n\nthat deep down inside she was reluctant to move farther away from\n\nher parents. She finally admitted this feeling, but still insisted that I\n\nshould do what I felt was best in the long run for my career and for\n\nthe family. I thought about my present position with Surety Electronics and how happy I was. Here I was an electrical design\n\nengineer, doing exactly what I wanted to do.\n\nOut of college for only four years, I had almost doubled my\n\nstarting salary. I was now eligible for three weeks annual vacation.\n\nOvertime pay was becoming quite regular. From what I could determine, the benefits package at Surety was unsurpassed in the industry.\n\nAside from the standard benefits, I received a substantial yearly\n\nbonus. Adding up all these items amounted to almost $25,000 per\n\nyear, $17,500 of which was salary.\n\nP:52\n\n48 Casebook of Organizational Behavior\n\nTo add to the dilemma of making the right decision, I made a\n\ngood initial effort in my pursuit of an MBA at a satellite location of\n\nPurdue University. The company footed the bill for this program. My\n\nwork assignments were very challenging; I loved my job and the\n\npeople I worked with. My job assignments gave me ample opportunity for travel, a rarity for an engineer.\n\nMy future with my present company looked very promising.\n\nDespite all these pluses there wasn't much chance of promotion to a\n\nmanagerial position, though the pay was substantial and my job\n\nsecurity was solid. The logical next step was to see what Baton\n\nRouge Enterprises had to offer. In the back of my mind, I felt that\n\nthey would reject what I would require to leave my present job. I\n\nasked for a starting salary of $22,000, three weeks vacation, benefits\n\ncommensurate with my present benefit package, relocation expenses,\n\nand a promise of a managerial position as soon as I automated their\n\nsystems. I figured it would take two years to complete the automation project.\n\nTo top off my list of demands, I asked the company to take care\n\nof selling my home and finding my family a comparable one in\n\nLouisiana. It might have looked as though I were making unreasonable demands, but I was confident that my talents and experience\n\nwere deserving of an unusual opportunity. I felt that a person could\n\nask for much more in the way of a compensation package if he is\n\nasked to relocate. If Baton Rouge Enterprises wanted me badly\n\nenough to grant all my demands, I would accept the job offer.\n\nAfter reaching this tentative decision, I began to ruminate over\n\nwhat would happen if I left my present job, accepted the new position with Baton Rouge, and it fell through shortly after my family\n\nand I had relocated to Louisiana. My guess was that I had about a 95\n\npercent chance of being rehired by Surety Electronics without losing\n\nanything if I came back within a year. After a year back on the job, I\n\nwould regain all my seniority, vacation, bonus, and retirement\n\nbenefits. Should I return after one year, it would be tantamount to\n\nstarting as a new employee with them.\n\nAside from what the company policy states about rehiring\n\npeople, I had to consider what the management attitude would be\n\ntoward me. It would probably affect my chances for promotion\n\nadversely. Very probably, I would be considered disloyal or ungrateful.\n\nWhile I waited for a reply from Baton Rouge Enterprises, I had\n\nsome research conducted into the past performance of the company\n\nand its future prospects. A lawyer friend of mine with a good back-\n\nP:53\n\nBehavioral Aspects of Decision Making 49\n\nground in analyzing the financial situation of companies did the\n\ninvestigation for me. His conclusion was that the future of the\n\ncompany appeared uncertain. He reasoned that the company would\n\nbe successful or fold within two years because it only had one\n\nproduct line. I assume that every fledgling company gets a similar\n\nrating from lawyers or accountants, but I had faith in this man's\n\njudgment.\n\nTo my surprise, I received an enthusiastic reply from Baton\n\nRouge Enterprises. They were willing to guarantee me everything I\n\nrequested and urged me to visit them at their expense. My wife and I\n\ntook a long weekend vacation to visit the company and the city. We\n\nboth liked what we saw. To make my decision even tougher, they\n\ntold me they thought I could complete the automated system within\n\ntwo years and after that I would become an executive in the\n\ncompany.\n\nThe topic of relocation dominated our thoughts for an entire\n\nweek. It did seem like a unique opportunity, even better than that\n\ndescribed in the initial phone conversation with Terry. When it\n\nlooked as if I was turning in the direction of accepting the position,\n\nmy wife again told me she felt uneasy about relocating to Louisiana\n\nbecause it would substantially increase the geographic distance\n\nbetween us and her parents. Living in Indianapolis, we could reach\n\nher parents in three hours by automobile.\n\nAnother letter and another phone call were forthcoming from\n\nBaton Rouge Enterprises. Although they told me to take all the time\n\nI needed to make my decision, they were pressing me. Financially,\n\nthe situation looked incredibly good, provided that it all worked out\n\nwell once I arrived down there. If within a year I decided to return to\n\nmy old job â and it was available â nothing would be lost (to the\n\nbest of my knowledge). But the anguish of moving twice within a\n\none year period might be more than my family and I could bear.\n\nShould I accept the position, stay more than a year, and then\n\nfind that the position wasn't going to work out for the long range, I\n\nwould have ruined my future with Surety. Assuming the new\n\ncompany fell through after two years, I would be out of a job, my\n\nchildren would be of school age, and the job market for engineers\n\ncould conceivably be quite limited. A move at that point in life\n\nwould be much more difficult than at present. Should the new job\n\nfall through a few years from now, my wife would probably want to\n\nrelocate t"
