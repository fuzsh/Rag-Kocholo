        "text": "February 17, 2024\n\nWith an isolationist President running the US and a nutcase running Russia after taking over in a coup in the previous book, what could go wrong? McLanahan is lowered in rank by a star and loses his command. Something about ignoring orders and not going through the proper chain of command.\n\nAnother very involved book, with plenty of air action and incompetence at the command level.\n\nNovember 6, 2017\n\nConsumed on a six hour car ride to Baguio. Typical \"airport novel\" fare from Dale Brown, moreso since it was read back to back with Air Battle Force, which I *had* read many times before. Felt like ABF Part Two.\n\nThen again, outlandish plots featuring futuristic air warfare are pretty much what you expect to get from Dale Brown, in the same way that one doesn't watch Transformers for the plot but rather for the gritty action scenes.\n\nMarch 19, 2010\n\nOverall this storyline of Patrick McClanahan is just silly. I just don't understand creating an alternative universe and timeline (see Back to the Future 2 for clarification), but referencing things from one universe in the other. For example, this book references all the world events that happened in previous books, which was a crazy depiction of the world, but the author then decides to mention 9-11 as a source of something. I think it references the alternative universe by mentioning all the nuclear bombs exploding all over the world in different conflicts, but then back to reality. I'm sorry, but you can't have one universe intersect the other. It just doesn't make any sense. In his world, 9-11 would not have taken place, as other crap has happened, and prevents the other actions from becoming reality. Oh yea, and the rest of the book sucks too. This is all I will say. P.S. It is a wanna-be Jack Ryan plotline, only much less interesting, and a lot more fantasy-land with the new gismos and gadgets available at just the right time to help kill the bad guys.\n\nJuly 2, 2013\n\nI felt that this book is really bad on so many levels. First, is it really likely that the post-soviet Russia, deep in debt and with its military rusting in storage, could assemble a massive bomber force to attack the US? And even if such a force was raised, how it could get to the American coast without being detected by US intelligence, satellites, or radar? Even more curious, how could NORAD have virtually no fighters on the West Coast, when so many Air Force squadrons are based there along with the multitude of Navy fighters.\n\nAll of these plot holes can be overlooked, abet with a great effort. But what I found really glaring was the use of the term \"American Holocaust\" to describe the Russian nuclear attack. To me, it seemed to be a poor attempt to portray US as a tragic entity by bringing it on part with the Jewish Europeans in WWII. The arrogance.....\n\nMay 9, 2020\n\nWenngleich spannend geschrieben, lastet der fehlende Realismus auf dem Leseerlebnis, insbesondere aufgrund der völligen Überlegenheit des amerikanischen Militärs - jedes Mal, wenn es knapp wird, kommt von irgendwo ein neues stealth Flugzeug mit absurden Thermium-Nitrat-, Plasmasprengköpfen oder unbesiegbaren \"Zinnsoldaten\" um die Ecke und rettet den Tag, was die Geschichte sehr vorhersehbar macht. Für Fans des Genres i.O, für Neueinsteiger ein schwacher Einstieg.\n\nWant to read\n\nSeptember 5, 2011\n\nThe unthinkable is about to happen in this high-flying novel of adventure and suspense.\n\nIn Air Battle Force, Dale Brown introduced U.S. Air Force aerial warfare expert Major General Patrick McLanahan and his air combat unit of the future. Armed with a force of these robotic planes, the general and a handful of commandos were secretly deployed to the oil-rich nation of Turkmenistan to stop a Taliban invasion. And though the Americans won the battle, the war is far from over....\n\nTo punish McLanahan and his fleet of robot warplanes for their audacity, Russian president General Anatoliy Gryzlov decides to do the unthinkable: a sneak attack on America-unlike anything ever believed possible-that devastates her strategic air forces.\n\nMcLanahan has collected information that not only foretold the Russians' daring plan, but also gave him the data he needs to plan a counterstrike that could stop the Russian war machine dead in its tracks. But Patrick is no longer in charge of Air Battle Force, and the Russian sneak attack has left the embattled U.S. president with few options: retaliate with every weapon in his arsenal, even if it triggers a global thermonuclear war, or to a cease fire on Russia's terms...\n\n...or listen to a disgraced and discredited young bomber commander's long-shot plan of attack.\n\nPatrick McLanahan demoted to Military Intelligence after launching a pre-emptive strike on Russian forces invading Turkmenistan. As an act of revenge, Russian president launches a nuclear attack on the US's strategic bases.\n\nMcLanahan then launches an attack on Russia and kills the Russian president thus preventing a nuclear war.\n\nMartindale re-elected as President\n\nCast of Characters\n\nBrigadier General Patrick McLanahan, commander, 966th Information Warfare Wing;\n\nplans intelligence operations; 4 ops groups, 1 intel group\n\nMajor General Gary Houser, commander, Air Intelligence Agency\n\nColonel Trevor Griffin, deputy commander, 966th Information Warfare Wing, Lackland AFB\n\nCommand CMSgt Harold Bayless, Command NCOIC\n\nChief Master Sergeant Donald Saks, NCOIC, National Air Intelligence Center, WPAFB;\n\nproduces foreign aerospace intel for DoD\n\nBrigadier General David Luger, commander, First Air Battle Force\n\nBrigadier General Rebecca Furness, commander, 111th Attack Wing;\n\ncommander, 1 ABF/Air Operations\n\nColonel Hal Briggs, commander, I ABF/Ground Operations\n\nSergeant Major Chris Wohl, NCOIC, 1 ABF/GO\n\nFirst Lieutenant Mark Bastian, Ground Ops squad leader\n\nStaff Sergeant Emily Angel, ABF Ground Ops\n\nTech Sergeant James “JD” Daniels\n\nLance Corporal Johnny “Hulk” Morris\n\nColonel Daren Mace, Ops Group commander, 111th Attack Wing\n\nLieutenant Colonel Samantha Hellion, Fifty-first Bomb Squadron (EB-1 C)\n\nColonel Nancy Cheshire, commander, Fifty-second Bomb Squadron (EB-52 and AL-52)\n\nColonel Kelvin Carter, operations officer, Fifty-second Bomb Squadron, AL-52 AC\n\nLieutenant Colonel Summer O’Dea, EB-52 AC\n\nMajor Matthew Whitley, EB-52 remote-control technician\n\nMajor Frankie “Zipper” Tarantino, AL-52 MC\n\nCaptain Johnny “Soccer” Sammis, EB-52 MC\n\nU.S. Marine Corps Captain Ted Merritt, Marine Special Purpose Forces platoon leader\n\nLieutenant General Terrill Samson, commander, Eighth Air Force\n\nBrigadier General Charles C.

This is one of his best. In this book his protagonist, Brigadier General Patrick McLanahan leads a US military force enforcing a peace agreement between Russia and Turkmenistan. Seeing the Russians move their forces beyond the agreed separation line, he activates his high-tech air and special forces. His team destroys a Russian Air Force brigade and infantry team.\n\nThis decision is (arguably,) beyond McLanahan’s mandate but incites both Russian President Gryzlov and US President Thorn and a handful of his most senior civilian and military advisors. McLanahan is disgraced and given an air intelligence command. Next, McLanahan notices that Russia has relocated her largest bombers and fighter bombers to central and eastern Siberia. Also, Russia’s mobile ground based ballistic missiles have dramatically changed their normal routines. Seeking more data, McLanahan finds that Russia’s tanker aircraft have mostly congregated on and around Yakutsk, her furthest east refueling and support base. McLanahan identifies these moves as preparation for a surprise attack by Russia from her east and north. He escalates this information and analysis to his boss who chooses to sit on it.\n\nOur protagonist escalates his information and analysis around his boss, and the brown stuff hits the fan. McLanahan has stretched his orders and bypassed certain senior people in the past. Some support him but several hate him despite his successes and he is relieved of command. Nevertheless, NORAD, Elmendorf, the largest US base in Alaska, and a few smaller bases in southern Alaska and western Canada are alerted. An Elmendorf pilot on patrol spots the first Russian aerial penetration. The fighter pilot sees the first aerial launched cruise and ballistic missiles and shoots down one bomber and some of the cruise missiles, but Russian nukes have shut down communication from the north and the picture turns bleak.\n\nAs the scale of the Russian attack is discovered, McLanahan is reinstated and his response recommendation is adopted. Brown’s battle scenes are sterling; among the best I have seen. He describes the Russian and US aircraft, weapon systems and other tools in enough detail to make the reader feel that he too is fighting the battle. Their use is described as is their impact and any opposition their foe might use against them. This is one of Brown’s real strengths.\n\nThe only area I find fault with are the scenes where his US military and civilian seniors take him on. These battles are vicious and nasty. To my mind they do not ring quite true. If the President, Secretary of Defense and senior General of the Air Force really thought he had not followed orders properly, they claim enough proof to send him to jail for life, or simply retire him off. They never do. They always promote him, then ignore him until they need him again. In general, the major characters are developed enough that we have good understanding of their behavior. This makes the book and plot feel more plausible.\n\nThis is a very good book that went by quickly. Lots of interest, lots of tension, lots of action. Dale Brown tells a great story. Five stars.\n\nFebruary 23, 2021\n\nThis is a typical Pat McLanahan story both the good and the bad. For the good it is a fast paced story with the usual high standard of high tech battles. The bad is the usual unrealistic ability of McLanahan of disobeying lawful orders within the US Air Force, gets threatened with court martial and demotion, then having been proved right becomes the hero and his rewarded despite all of the issues at the outset of the story.\n\nI was also disappointed with the political story line this time as it failed to feel realistic. Basically in response to McLanahan attack on a Russian air base during \"Air Battle Force\" launches a series of low yield nuclear attacks against the US strategic missile and bomber bases. He then attempts to force the US President to accept these attacks as a simple retaliation and to not respond in kind. The Russian President then becomes obsessed with bringing down McLanahan even going to the lengths of launching nuclear cruise missiles at one of his own bases when he becomes aware that McLanahan has taken control of it.\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\nAnother good book in the Patrick McLanahan series.\n\nThis is a close follow up to Air Battle Force.\n\nRussian president General Anatoly Gryzlov launches a sneak attack on America to get back at Patrick McLanahan and his fleet of warplanes for a previous attack of a Russian airbase.\n\nMcLanahan has collected information that foretold the Russians' daring plan and also gives him the data he needs to plan a counterstrike that might stop the Russian.\n\nThe U.S. president has few options to retaliate. McLanahan may have to take matters into his own hands.\n\nDecember 20, 2017\n\nA readable book even if somewhat futuristic and barely believable in places. It is a good attempt at guessing what the technological advances will be in the near forseeable future but regresses to the old traditional foes to develop the plot. But, it was a story that had me reading well past my self-allotted reading times in an attempt to get to the end just to see what the end of the tale was going to be. Have a go, a book for all armed conflict afficionados.\n\nJuly 20, 2022\n\nUnfortunately, I started this series with book #12. I really enjoyed it, so now I need to go back and read books 1-11.\n\nGood action, great characters, fascinating plot, maybe a little more technical detail than I'm interested in personally, but I know that there are lots of fans of that sort of stuff out there.\n\nApril 10, 2019\n\nI'm mixed on this one. The first half of the book amounts to political infighting and personality conflicts with little action. Once the action starts, it pretty much goes full throttle. Not as much for McLanahan to do in this one, but he does play a pivotal role.\n\nJune 22, 2019\n\nPatrick is the General that doesn't follow the chain of command when he thinks their is an inevitable attack on the U.S. He's back and doesn't back down even when his job is on the line\n\nSlow to start. Well written. But worth the wait. Will read the next one\n\nDecember 16, 2020\n\nPlan of Attack\n\nAn excellent story about responding t a nuke attack by Russia forces, being led by Gryzlov, the Russian general that took over as president during a coup. His sole reason for living was to kill Mclanahan.\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\nThe book definitely starts off slow and is very technical, it took me a while to really get into it but I saw promise with the action and tactics. I love a good war book and this ends up being just that, I couldn’t put it down.\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nReally exciting\n\nThere are really no words sufficient to describe the intensity and nail biting suspense of this book. I was riding a roller coaster of emotions from the start to the finish.\n\nNovember 2, 2019\n\nExcellent! His second best, next to Flight Of The Old Dog!\n\nApril 6, 2020\n\nOK book. Not great character development. Interesting perspective on the military in the future? C\n\nMay 14, 2020\n\nStruggle between two forces and it's drama\n\nAll aspects of staging and implementing a p!an to contain the different strategies by opposing forces.\n\nGreat action book to read.\n\nOctober 5, 2020\n\nAuthor tries too hard to intertwine sex into book and does it awkwardly.\n\nNovember 4, 2020\n\nInteresting story, close to real world science fiction. Looked up all the aircraft codes to see what was been talked about.\n\nMarch 26, 2021\n\nok read, not great. A bit preposterous. All over the place, jumps back and forth... a bit difficult to keep up with.\n\nSeptember 4, 2021\n\nAnother great read\n\nThis one was way more technical in descriptions... but a great read nonetheless. I wish our current military were this far advanced! I know I would sleep better!"
