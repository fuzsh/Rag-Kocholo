But bitter professional rivalries threaten to damage, perhaps even destroy, the mission, as a vengeful opponent takes advantage of the disruption to strengthen his outlaw navy and set its sights horrifically high - raising the stakes in a battle the U.S. and the world simply cannot afford to lose."
