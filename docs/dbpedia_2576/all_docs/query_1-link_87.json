        "text": "Shreve Memorial Library is encouraging children and teens to go back to school with the library and not to forget their library cards. This week and throughout the month of August, Shreve Memorial Library branches are planning fun and interactive programs to get students ready for the upcoming school year and to remind them of the valuable resources available at the library.\n\nStarting a new school year can be overwhelming. Several Shreve Memorial Library branches are offering ways for children and teens to reduce some of the stress by creating a plan and setting individuals goals for the school year. At the library, students can make vision boards, attend a goal-setting workshop, or preserve their hopes for the year in a cool time capsule. Little learners can ease their fears about the new school year in special “Back to School” themed story times, and teens can meet their friends for “Back to School” movie screenings.\n\nIf you have not yet finished your school supply shopping, Shreve Memorial Library can also help with that. Children can prepare for the new school year by making a variety of arts and crafts, including unique DIY school supplies like bookmarks, notebooks, bulletin boards, pencil pouches, journals and more. The best part about these DIY programs is that all Shreve Memorial Library programs are free and open to the public, and all needed supplies are provided.\n\nA complete list of all “Back to School” programs at Shreve Memorial Library can be found on the library’s website.\n\nIn addition to these programs, you cannot forget that Shreve Memorial Library offers resources for students throughout the school year. These resources include virtual student library cards, which provide Caddo Parish Public School students with standard access to the library’s physical collection and the ability to check out up to two items at any given time using their student ID, online educational resources, study rooms, public computers, and free Wi-Fi.\n\nBe sure to stop by your favorite branch of Shreve Memorial Library or visit www.shreve-lib.org to learn more about how the library can support students as they dream, discover, do this school year.\n\nWhat’s New at the Library\n\nThe Summer Escape: A Novel by Jill Shalvis (fiction)\n\nSecrets are revealed and forbidden sparks ignited in this sizzling Sunrise Cove standalone, a tale of enemies to lovers, redemption, missing treasures, and love – by romance superstar and New York Times bestselling author Jill Shalvis. Anna Moore didn’t just wake up one day and decide to go on a wild quest – especially since her life no longer lends itself to wild anything – so how in the world does she end up racing against the clock with Owen Harris, a sexy, enigmatic adventurist, to prove her beloved dad innocent of stealing a million-dollar necklace? It’s all Wendy’s fault. Her older, bossy sister, who’s seven months pregnant and on bed rest in their small Lake Tahoe hometown, is desperate to clear their departed dad’s name. Owen, though, is convinced he’s guilty as hell and wants to return the jewelry back to its rightful owner – his elderly great aunt. Together Anna and Owen go on a scavenger hunt for clues to the past (with Wendy remotely along for the ride via an earbud, supplying a running wry commentary to boot). On opposing sides and suspicious of each other as they are, Anna and Owen still can’t deny the inexplicable and explosive chemistry between them on this heart-stopping adventure, the outcome of which will prove the necklace isn’t the only thing stolen – their hearts have been as well.\n\nOne of Our Kind: A Novel by Nicola Yoon (fiction)\n\nJasmyn and King Williams move their family to the planned Black utopia of Liberty, California hoping to find a community of like-minded people, a place where their growing family can thrive. King settles in at once, embracing the Liberty ethos, including the luxe wellness center at the top of the hill, which proves to be the heart of the community. But Jasmyn struggles to find her place. She expected to find liberals and social justice activist striving for racial equality, but Liberty residents seem more focused on booking spa treatments and ignoring the world’s troubles. Jasmyn’s only friends in the community are equally perplexed and frustrated by most residents’ outlook. Then Jasmyn discovers a terrible secret about Liberty and its founders. Frustration turns to dread as their loved ones start embracing the Liberty way of life. Will the truth destroy her world in ways she never could have imagined? A gripping thriller with wry, razor-sharp social commentary, One of Our Kind explores the ways in which freedom is complicated by the presumptions we make about ourselves and each other.\n\nThe Devil’s Fortress by Dale Brown (fiction)\n\nAfter saving the US from a Russian nuclear attack in the bestselling Weapons of Opportunity, Nick Flynn returns in what could be his most dangerous mission yet. Former US Air Force officer Nick Flynn joined the clandestine Quartet Directorate to continue its long-standing mission: to act decisively against serious threats to the free world. And with the backing of Russia’s authoritarian president, no threat is more deadly than that of Pavel Voronin and his mercenary Raven Syndicate. Twice they have almost succeeded in bringing the United States to its knees, only to be stopped at the last moment by Flynn and his team of highly trained operatives. But Flynn knows it’s only a matter of time before one of Voronin’s plans to cripple the US bears lethal fruit. And so, taking the Russian oligarch permanently off the board is now his number one priority. Operating undetected deep in hostile territory and fighting their way through Voronin’s extraordinarily tough defenses will require every ounce of skill, dedication, and daring that Flynn and his small force can muster. The slightest error could be fatal for all of them – and, ultimately, for millions of Americans. With the clock ticking, and dangers mounting on all sides, it’s up to Flynn and the others to finish Voronin before it’s too late. In this all-or-nothing battle, victory is the only acceptable outcome – no matter how high the coast!\n\nAbout Shreve Memorial Library"
