        "text": "What is the Air National Guard?\n\nThe Air National Guard is a separate reserve component of the United States Air Force, similar to the Air Force Reserves. We work part-time, one weekend a month and a few weeks a year, at a minimum, and have what is unique to the military in a dual role. While Reserve components have a federal mission under the direction of the President, the Air Guard has another role of supporting the states in times of need under the direction of the Governor. As a result, the Air Guard gets additional benefits offered by the state and affords its members both federal and state benefits.\n\nHow much money will I earn working on weekend per month?\n\nYour pay is determined by your rank and time in service. Air Guard members are paid for four active duty days for working two actual days each month. You can check out the pay calculator on our website or ask your recruiter for current pay scale information.\n\nCan Air Guard help me pay for college?\n\nYes, Air Guard members can take advantage of the Montgomery GI Bill, which pays a monthly stipend of up to $362 per month toward college tuition and expenses. If you qualify, you can also receive the GI Bill Kicker, which could provide y ou with an additional $350 per month. Some states even offer up to 100% tuition assistance!
