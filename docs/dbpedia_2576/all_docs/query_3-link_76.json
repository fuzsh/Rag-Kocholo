The salaries for entry-level air traffic control specialists increase as they complete each new training phase.\n\nThe annual salary for more advanced controllers who have completed on-the-job training varies with the location of the facility and the complexity of the airspace. Other factors include, experienced controllers who were directly hired to facilities.\n\nAs a federal employee, air traffic control specialists receive a benefits package that rivals, if not surpasses, those offered in the private sector, with a variety of insurance, retirement, leave and flexible spending options for employees and their families. Learn more about benefits.\n\nMost air traffic control specialists work full time, and some work additional hours. Larger air traffic control facilities operate continuously, and employees may rotate among day, evening, and night shifts, along with weekends and holidays. Smaller facilities have more standard dawn to dusk operating hours.\n\n'My time working in Air Traffic has been rewarding and fun! I can’t think of a better public service profession!' - Brian Throop, Vice President of Air Traffic Services\n\nBecause of the serious nature of this work and zero margin for error, the training regimen and proficiencies needed to become an air traffic control specialist, are demanding.
