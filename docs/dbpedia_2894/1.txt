Clubbers are on fire with the latest rumour circulating in Ibiza. Privilege Ibiza, the world’s largest nightclub, could reopen in 2025. And we’re all for it !

Privilege Ibiza, originally known as Ku Club (1979-95), was a huge nightclub located near the village of Sant Rafael de Sa Creu, less than a kilometer from Amnesia. With a capacity of 10,000 people and a surface area of 6,500 m², it was the largest nightclub in the world according to the Guinness Book of Records until its closure in 2020.

The biggest nightclub in the world

The history of Privilege Ibiza dates back to the early 1970s. At the time, it was a restaurant, which was later extended to include a bar and a community pool. In 1979, the establishment was sold, changed its name to KU (after a god in Hawaiian mythology) and became a huge success.

During the 1980s, the KU Club became Europe’s first polysexual but mainly gay nightclub and was compared to an open-air version of New York’s famous Studio 54. The programme included spectacular parties in the main room around a swimming pool and a statue of Ku. The club continued to be known as the KU Club until 1995, when it was renamed Privilege after a change of ownership.

Reopening in 2025 ?

If we’re talking about Privilege Ibiza, it’s because rumours of a reopen in 2025 have been circulating for weeks. In 2022, the Privilege was bought by Grupo Empresas Matutes after years of legal battles with previous owner. Led by the Tourism Planning Commission of Ibiza, a project to redevelop Ibiza was launched. The project has seen €23 million allocated to renovate existing tourist attractions in Ibiza.

Privilege Ibiza is one of the major beneficiaries of this plan. The club will receive €8.2 million for renovations to improve water circulation and the use of solar energy. A sweet dream that should send shivers down the spines of Ibiza’s biggest clubbers… And add another option to the white island’s nightlife offering.
