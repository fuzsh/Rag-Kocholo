        "text": "19 Guinness World Records Set In North Carolina, Including Some Rather Bizarre Ones\n\nI remember the days of buying the Guinness Book of World Records at the book fair in elementary school. And it’s still going strong. There are records for literally anything you can think of. And hundreds of things you never imagined. In fact, there are over 40,000 records currently held. So it makes sense that some of the Guinness World Records would have been set in North Carolina. I’ve compiled a few of those for your enjoyment, and boy are they entertaining. Some of these records include animals, others that occurred at sporting events, and other random activities you didn’t know people actually did. One thing is for sure, you’ll be entertained!\n\n19 Guinness World Records Set In North Carolina, Including Some Rather Bizarre Ones\n\nYou can read more about the Guinness World Records including others set in North Carolina here.\n\nNorth Carolina Bucket List: 15 Things to Do for Summer 2023\n\nSummer is here and that means summer fun. Good news if you live in North Carolina, we actually ranked as one of the most fun states. This means finding plenty to do this summer shouldn’t be difficult. One of my personal favorite things about North Carolina is that you’re always a short drive from the beach or the mountains, which means there is plenty to do! So with so many options, it can be overwhelming. I know for me personally planning and making lists is the only way I can get things done. And that includes all the summer activities I want to take place in. So of course I had to make a North Carolina summer bucket list, and of course, I had to share it with you!\n\nI spend most of my days browsing endless information about things to do in North Carolina whether that’s restaurants, small towns, beaches, tourist attractions, and everything else. So I had a lot to pull from. On this list you’ll see very specific items such as visiting certain restaurants, but there are also some more generic options that could include several destinations. So take a look at my list, perhaps it will influence you to do some of these things this summer. Have something on your North Carolina summer bucket list? Let me know I’d love to hear about it!\n\nSummer is going to go by quickly so get to work crossing off that list, and most important of all? Have fun!\n\nMelanie Day is a graduate of North Carolina State University. She has worked for Beasley since 2012 in a variety of behind-the-scenes roles in both digital and promotions.
