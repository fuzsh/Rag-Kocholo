The famous super-club Pacha is only a short walk from the centre, as are the smaller venues Heart and Lío. Plan your night at one of incredible clubs in one of the most scenic and gorgeous locations in the world with the expert help of Discotech today.\n\nPrivilege\n\nIt is a privilege just to experience\n\nOriginally known as Ku Club, Privilege is the largest nightclub in the world according to Guiness, with a capacity of up to 10,000 guests. It’s quite difficult to grasp the scale of things in Privilege Ibiza if you’ve never seen it with your own eyes. The club venue is a repurposed airplane hangar that boasts an impressive 25m high roof, 6,500m2 space and a fitting industrial aesthetic. The venue is currently composed of a large main room and a smaller side room that hosts the spectacular Vista Club, various gardens and relaxation areas, and of course the iconic dome, all coming together to create the most captivating multi roomed clubbing experience on the White Island. At the Vista Club guests will be able to dance their toes off while at the Coco Loca bar area, they will be able to enjoy a variety of brews and drinks. At this world-famous venue, many renowned and legendary artists have performed from Freddie Mercury and Duran Duran to Kylie Minogue and Grace Jones. Even celebrities like Madonna, Led Zeppelin, Tina Turner, and David Bowie have shown up to this popular nightclub to enjoy the party. At Privilege Ibiza, you’ll be able to experience a night you’re not likely to ever forget.\n\nAmnesia\n\nForget your worries and dance the night away\n\nKnown currently as the “temple of music”, Amnesia’s history begins with a young philosopher Antonio Eschotado who signed a lease for the venue in the mid 1970’s. He named the premises “El Taller de los Olvidadizo,” or the “The Workshop of Forgetfulness” in English. At his night club Escohotado aimed to create a space where people would be able to come to his disco to enjoy themselves leaving all their worries behind, and temporarily escaping from normal life. He later renamed it to the Greek word ‘Amnesia’ as he believed that this word captured everything he wanted and more from his idea – and so the club was born.\n\nAt Amnesia, located in the village of San Rafeal in Ibiza, guests can party at two massive rooms – the Club Room, a dark cavernous space, and the Terrace, an expansive arena with a glass roof that is flooded with light when the sun rises. Both rooms are guarded by the notorious Amnesia ice cannons that could strike at any time. Amnesia covers the best of techno, house, bass, Latin and even some live shows. Guests can dance on the club’s famous hallowed dance floors which can get extremely busy and are famed for incredible communal moments with every hand in the air. The upper levels of Amnesia are VIP, providing an amazing view of the revelry below. The type of experience that clubbers are offered at Amnesia is unparalleled with the club even winning multiple Best Global Club awards over the years.\n\nHi Ibiza\n\nOne of the newer clubs on the island\n\nHi Ibiza opened its doors in 2017 under the direction of Ushuaia Entertainment. The club used to be formerly known as Space and is located in Playa d’en Bossa. The superclub hosts a massive space that has a capacity of 2,500 people, and contains 7 VIP areas, an open-air terrace, and two rooms: The Theatre and The Club. The best time to visit the club would be in the summer as they host the biggest artists and DJs in the EDM industry then, but the party is always popping at Hi Ibiza. The venue is regularly holding events that are making history in the electronic music industry, and it strives to create a space that is welcoming to thousands of music lovers from all over the world. Since opening their doors, they have received multiple awards as a result of their commitment to offering the best experience and music alongside superb service and cutting-edge production. Although Hi Ibiza has all the accoutrements of a stunning and exhilarating superclub, everyone goes there to immerse themselves in the musical shows and performances that the club puts on from the likes of David Guetta and Martin Garrix. If you consider yourself to be a music aficionado, Hi Ibiza is one hotspot you can’t miss on your trip to Ibiza.\n\nEden\n\nRecently renovated with a new sound system and interior\n\nFounded in 1999 in the heart of San Antonio Bay, near one of the most attractive harbors of the Balearic Islands, EDEN club is one of the main players of the electronic music scene in Ibiza.\n\nIts name, summer nights and parties are all part of the Ibiza night lore. Boasting for guests a large sophisticated main room, a second room (NeXt) with independent access, the powerful exclusive sound system of Incubus Gold by Void, a state-of-the-art piece of sound engineering, two large DJ booths, several bars, main dance floor, multiple levels and two VIP areas with private parking, this professional and modern club has everything needed to completely satisfy the high expectations of clubbers and Ibiza lifestyle lovers alike. This dream venue for nightlife promoters, music lovers and DJs wanting to make a mark on the scene has regularly hosted big names in the music industry like Lady Gaga, Markus Schulz, Luciano, Sasha and more. Eden is a large-capacity nightclub and has recently been reconstructed with a booming sound system and new interior to serve music lovers in the best possible way and serves as a gateway for many clubbers who come to experience the party lifestyle of Ibiza.\n\nHeart Ibiza\n\nWhere food, music and art meet\n\nThe creative partnership between Cirque du Soleil and the Adrià brothers that makes up Heart Ibiza forms an attractive hotspot for hedonists seeking to channel their sensory appetites. Visitors are lured through the vessels of a fresh Balearic chamber to an entertainment hub where a new perspective of hospitality collides with great food, music and art. From sunset through the late hours of the night (or morning), at Heart Ibiza, guests are able to have an innovative multisensory experience that fuses gastronomy, live performance art, world-class live bands, and electronic music that is set to put feasts for the mind and the soul on the menu. The Adrià brothers are some of Spain’s most talented chefs and with the help of Cirque du Soleil’s Guy Laliberté, they were able to come up with an intelligently devised format that invites guests to enjoy drinks with great views of Dalt Vila from Heart Ibiza’s open-air terrace, making the perfect socializing space. Guests are also welcome to enjoy themselves in the atmospheric LAB, the dining room, for a culinary affair that has a backdrop of downtempo art and performance. Finally, it all comes together in the club space which plays host to bona fide superstar acts.\n\nPacha\n\nThe island’s original club\n\nCreated in Ibiza in 1973, this venue in Ibiza Town has transformed itself into a clubbing powerhouse brand that is known throughout the world. Pacha has a reputation for providing clubbing with style and is unparalleled when it comes to adding the exclusivity of VIP service.\n\nWith over four decades of party-planning under its belt, as well as a massive refurbishment in 2018, it has cemented its place as one of the most popular and most iconic nightclubs in Ibiza and its fame has led to it having one of the biggest rosters of talent on the White Isle. The naked walls capture the hippie soul and spontaneity of the 70’s combining it with today’s technology to create a modern take on the famous nightclubs of the past. As guests bask in the whitewashed facade and dance on the open floor plan dancing area, they can enjoy performances from heavy music industry giants like David Guetta, Graham Sahara, Solomun and more.\n\nOctan\n\nA true rave haven\n\nLocated in Playa d’en Bossa, opposite to the Garbi Hotel, the previously known Sankeys, is home to the brand new Octan nightclub which opened its doors in July 2019 and instantly became a rave haven for lovers of underground dance music. This venue is a true rave sanctuary to the techno fanatics and house music lovers. The venue consists of three rooms, roof terrace, and a unique body sonic dance floor. As you enter you will come into the famous Basement with low ceilings and the roof covered with LED lights where the atmosphere is raw and intense. Moving inwards, you might find yourself suddenly raving in the bathrooms where selected local DJs are playing. Further in, is the LAB which gives the underground warehouse party vibes. Upstairs will be a lovely spacious rooftop terrace that is meant for chilling and conversation unlike the party that is going on downstairs. Keeping its visuals and entertainment to a bare minimum, Octan is the place to go to for the music that can be heard courtesy of an amazing VOID sound system.\n\nDC-10\n\nAn open air historic venue right next to the airport\n\nDC-10 is one of the most famous and best-known clubbing destinations on the planet. The venue which is located at a small farmhouse at the end of an airport runway in Ibiza has been firmly etched into the history books of dance music culture and entertainment since its opening in 1999 when it started its beginnings as a no-holds-barred, hedonistic, dance club. The success of DC-10 is due to its music which has always been solid, quality underground electronic music for the past two decades. There is nothing that comes even close to the experience that guests will be able to enjoy dancing in the venue’s famous gardens in the evening, an event known as the daytime party Circo Loco.\n\nSwag\n\nVery relaxed dress code allows you to rock your own style\n\nLocated in the center of Playa Den Bossa, surrounded by hotels, beach clubs, and most importantly, the beach, Swag in Ibiza opened its doors in 2014, taking over the club space that the Garbi Ibiza Hotel offers to visitors. Unlike most of the clubs in Ibiza which are centered around EDM, at Swag, urban music gets to shine through with the beats, grooves and rhymes of hip-hop and R&B taking over the sound that resonates throughout the club. At this club which has a capacity for 1200, guests will be able to spread out between three VIP areas, the dance floors, and bar to have the ultimate clubbing experience. The fully equipped DJ booth can simultaneously host two DJ’s at once with an impressive sound and lighting/visual effect system helping them take their performances to the next level. Guests will also be able to enjoy live music performances at this venue which is open to the public seven nights a week and is always paying the best in urban music.\n\nEs Paradis\n\nA popular celebrity hangout spot\n\nLoosely translated as ‘Heaven on Earth’, the white interior and enormous natural gardens make it one of the most spectacular and stunning venues on the island. The labyrinthian gardens and club of Es Paradis has been around since the 1970s and is one of Ibiza’s lasting nightlife hallmarks. Visiting this venue is considered to be a rite of passage for tourists and also a popular hangout for celebrities while they are on the island. With four VIP areas, three chill bars and just as many hype dance floors, there is plenty to keep guests entertained once they are under the breathtaking pyramid roof of Es Paradis. The venue specializes in its pool parties as well as other fun energetic events like the neon paint party. No matter when you visit Es Paradis, you’ll be sure to enjoy your stay.\n\nIbiza Nightclubs FAQ\n\nWhere is the nightlife in Ibiza?\n\nPlaya d’en Bossa on the east coast of the island, just south of Ibiza town, boasts the longest beach of the island and a pulsating nightlife.
