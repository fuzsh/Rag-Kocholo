        "text": "Of all the clubs DC10 is actually the one you'd shut facilities wise, it's too small for almost all its nights now and causing a health and safety hazard for big events. It's also not the little underground venue it once was, it's an Instagram hotspot.\n\nKnow that DC10 events moving to a Matutes owned club is the stuff of nightmares for some, but for me their nights have already gone corporate anyway, stick em in a club that can handle the crowds\n\nyou'd shut it cos it has busy and popular nights or cos it's too small for the demand to attend??!! on that basis, I guess it should aim for less then! yes it's smaller than other clubs, but don't tell me your average Circoloco is a H&S hazard and Calvin Harris at ushuaia isn't. For the record, IMO neither are, but you made the point.\n\nby ibiza standards, I'd also say it is still definitely little and also underground, given it has no commercial nights and never has. and which club in Ibiza isn't an instagram hotspot? Also, who cares if it is. That's the world we live in. If it existed back in the day, we'd have used it like it is today.\n\nDC10 having big artists move on to other clubs or chase the money is nothing new, been happening for years, so it says more about the artists than it does about dc10. How do you mean by corporate? That's a new one when describing a club event ahah. Without doubt, things have become more popular/mainstream, but you can hardly blame the club for it's own popularity. In fact this year, I've seen regularly people moaning about Circoloco lineups being full of unknown names and new acts, which is what they've always been about. regarding being in a club that handle the crowds, again, I find this bizarre. Artists don't just play at places based on capacity of the venue. Our whole scene is built open on small venues and clubs developing legendary events and parties and thank god they didn't just \"stick em in a club that can handle the crowds\"."
