        "text": "An attempt to create the world’s largest Macarena dance is happening in the Greater Toronto Area and it’s going to be one for the books – the book of Guinness World Records, that is.\n\nThe last world record was set in 2011 by a highschool in the U.K. on July 7, 2011 where 2,219 students gathered on the field for a five-minute min and 36.3 second routine.\n\nThe idea was brought to DJ Starting from Scratch – a Toronto-based DJ who’s currently on tour with comedian Russell Peters in Florida and previously toured with Usher and George Lopez.\n\n“We turned it into a full 90s event with artists and stuff for kids all day long. The biggest thing with this whole thing is community. [We’re] trying to really bring families, kids, adults, everybody back together,” Scratch told Now Toronto.\n\nCentering the event around the Macarena is special for Scratch because his kids are also dancers.\n\n“My kids were already doing the Macarena. I guess just from stuff they see around [on social media]. Because I guess culturally, it just keeps on moving through the times,” Scratch said.\n\nSince the Macarena is so popular it made sense to make the event for all ages, according to the DJ.\n\n“So you know, for you, it may be one thing, and for me, it may be something totally different, but we’re both going there for one reason. That’s because we love that time era. And, like I say, a lot of that stuff has transcended, you know, to small, small kids now, just for whatever platform they watch, or movies or TV or so forth,” Scratch said.\n\nThere will be dancers and dance teams from all over the province teaching the Macarena dance all day at the event venue Improve Canada until the record is reached.\n\n“Everybody can be a part of this. So, everybody could wear that badge of honour saying, I’m in the Guinness Book of World Records. I did this. I was there when I did it, and, and I think that’s a beautiful thing, too,” he continued.\n\nNineties singers of hot hits like “Pump Up the Jam,” “Sexual Healing,” “Rhythm is a Dancer,” and “I Like to Move it” will be performing at the event as well.\n\nTo add to the nostalgia, the event will be MC’d by former MuchMusic VJ Rick Campanelli and Z103 radio host Tony Monaco.\n\nThere will also be live wrestling from Battle Arts Pro Wrestling, dance performances, food trucks, and a 90’s-themed market.\n\nLarge community events like these are the future for the already well-known DJ.\n\n“I don’t have to put myself in positions where I have to do certain things to get a certain amount of fame or a certain amount of money or anything like that. So, I’m really focusing on doing events now that are just long, lasting events, you know what I mean? I keep going back to the community and bringing people together because I’m really passionate about that aspect of it now. I’ve never really had the chance to really focus on doing something like that before because it was such a hustle and bustle and trying to and staying in that rat race of the DJ world,” Scratch said."
