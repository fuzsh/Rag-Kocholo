        "text": "Very large nightclub\n\nThis article is about nightclubs. For the Quebec video store chain, see Le SuperClub Vidéotron.\n\nA superclub is a very large or superior nightclub, often with several rooms with different themes.[1][2] The term was first coined in Mixmag, the British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, in 1995, referring to the new wave of clubs such as Ministry of Sound and Cream, which were dominating the English club scene.[3]\n\nSuperclubs may include nightclubs that have high capacity, or are multi-story, high profile, and operate city and region wide or are well known.[4] Some superclubs are owned and managed by a dance music record label or a club that was or is culturally important. The term may also be used to define its position within the club scene hierarchy.[5][6][7]\n\nForerunners of contemporary superclubs already existed in the early 20th century. The Guardian describes the Moka Efti in Berlin, a major dancing establishment of the Golden Twenties, as a \"1920s superclub\".[8]\n\nPrivilege Ibiza is the \"world's largest nightclub\" according to the Guinness Book of Records, with a capacity of 10,000 people.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes: The list of clubs below indicate the dates they were first established.\n\n1960s\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly examples of \"superclubs\" include Annabel's (London, 1963), Blow Up (Munich, 1967) and Pacha (Sitges, 1967).\n\n1970s\n\n[edit]\n\nExamples of \"superclubs\" from this period include Pacha, Ibiza in (1973), Studio One (nightclub) Los Angeles (1975), BANG (club) London (1976), Amnesia, Ibiza, (1976), Studio 54, New York City, (1977),[9] Paradise Garage, New York, (1977), Ku Club Ibiza, (1978), Xenon, New York, (1978), Roxy NYC, New York, (1978), Dorian Gray, Frankfurt, (1978), Heaven London, (1979), Danceteria, New York, (1979)\n\n1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nExamples of \"superclubs\" from this period include The Saint in New York in (1980), The Fridge, London, (1981),[10] The Haçienda in Manchester opened in (1982), The Limelight, New York, (1983), Hippodrome, London, (1983),[11] Space, Ibiza, (1986),[12] Tunnel, New York, (1986), Palladium, New York, (1985), Quadrant Park, Liverpool, (1988),[13] Excalibur Nightclub, Chicago, (1989),[14] The Sound Factory, New York, (1989), The Venue, Tower Park Poole, (1989).\n\n1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nExamples of \"superclubs\" from this period include Trade and Turnmills, London, (1990),[15] Club 051, Liverpool (1991), Ministry of Sound in London (1991), Juliana's Tokyo, (1991), Zouk, Singapore, (1991),[16] Renaissance (1992), Avalon, Boston (1992), Bunker, Berlin, (1992), E-Werk, Berlin, (1993), G-A-Y, London, (1993),[17] Cream at Nation, Liverpool, (1993),[18] Miss Moneypenny's, Birmingham, (1993), Cavo Paradiso, Mykonos, (1993),Ultraschall, Munich, (1994), Twilo, New York, (1995), The End, London, (1995), Nation, Washington, D.C., (1995), The Emporium.
