        "text": "Ibiza is one of the world’s meccas where nightlife is concerned. Every year, this Balearic island pulls in thousands of people from all over the world, drawn to its disco and club scene.\n\nIf you’re thinking of going for a night out in Ibiza (internal link), you need to be aware of the dates when the clubs open and close, as some of them are not open throughout the whole year.Lots of visitors wait for either the summer season opening parties (May) or the closing parties (between August and October) before traveling to Ibiza.\n\nUshuaia de Ibiza\n\nPachá Ibiza\n\nAmnesia\n\nHi Ibiza\n\nLío Ibiza\n\nBora Bora\n\nPrivilege, la discoteca más grande del mundo\n\nO Beach Ibiza (Ocean Beach)\n\nSwag Ibiza\n\nEs Paradis, pura fiesta\n\nYou also need to know that Ibiza’s best clubs are scattered around the various parts of the island:\n\nIbiza town and Platja d’en Bossa are home to some of the most important clubs in and around the island’s capital.\n\nThose in San Antonio, on Ibiza’s western coast, afford great views of the spellbinding sunsets over the sea.\n\nIn San Rafael (in the centre of the island), we can find other flagships of Ibiza nightlife\n\nIf you’re a real party animal, Ibiza is the destination for you. If you’re planning on going out on the town in a big way, here is a rundown of Ibiza’s best clubs:\n\nUshuaia de Ibiza\n\nIf you’re a real party animal, Ibiza is the destination for you. If you’re planning on going out on the town in a big way, here is a rundown of Ibiza’s best clubs:\n\nIf there’s one thing that sets Ushuaia apart, it is its outdoor experience. The daytime pool parties are a dream come true for any party animal. On any trip to Ibiza with clubbing in mind, Ushuaia is an absolute “must”.\n\nUshuaia is only open during the summer holiday season, and is located in Platja d’en Bossa. Its opening hours vary from between 2.00 and 5.00 p.m., and it closes at 11.00 p.m.\n\nPachá Ibiza\n\nThis is, perhaps, Ibiza’s most legendary club. The two cherries that feature in Pachá’s logo have been hanging on the island of Ibiza since 1973. It is, without doubt, the most iconic of the Pachá chain of establishments, and initially brought the group its fame, which has since spread to more than 10 countries.\n\nPachá is the benchmark for celebrity and stylish clubbing in Ibiza. It presents a selection of the very best electronic music, while also referencing great musical and commercial successes. David Guetta has also appeared here.\n\nPachá is in the heart of Ibiza Town’s marina, in the Talamanca area, and is open all year round.\n\nAmnesia\n\nAnother historic giant of Ibiza’s nightlife is Amnesia. Four times it was voted best club in the world, and with very good reason. This establishment was a hippie stronghold in the 80s, and is currently a mecca for electronic sounds, with two large dance floors (the Club Room and the Terrace), and a capacity of 5,000 people. These days, it combines the best of house, techno, Latin music, and pop. Elrow and Cocoon are among its best-known parties, along with its foam party.\n\nAmnesia is in the centre of the island, between Ibiza Town and San Rafael. The sessions opening and closing the season, and those welcoming the sunrise, are an absolute “must” on the island. Numerous celebrities have been seen here, including Paris Hilton, Cristiano Ronaldo, Shakira, and Mick Jagger.\n\nHi Ibiza\n\nFrom the same stable as Ushuaia is Hi Ibiza, one of the island’s most modern offerings, which first opened its doors in 2017, occupying the site of the historic dance hall Space. It has two large, elegant halls (Theatre and Club), with several open-air areas and capacity for around 5,000 people. Every summer, Hi Ibiza hosts big names such as Martin Garrix and Armin van Buuren.\n\nHi Ibiza is located in the Platja d’en Bossa area, and stands virtually next door to Ushuaia. This temple to hedonism shows off its state-of-the-art technology, offering clubbers a unique, innovative experience that changes every night between the months of May and October.\n\nLío Ibiza\n\nRestaurant, cabaret and disco. This is the novel combination that Lío Ibiza brings to Ibiza Town’s marina, a show in which singers and dancers perform while guests enjoy a sumptuous feast. The establishment’s prices and waiting list attest to all this, and it is patronised by beautiful people ranging from Leonardo di Caprio to Michael Jordan.\n\nIf you’re looking for a party with elements of burlesque and glamour, and with a meal prepared by a genuine chef included, Lío Ibiza is the place for you.\n\nBora Bora\n\nAt Bora Bora, you can enjoy a daylight party right by the sea. It is Ibiza’s beach bar par excellence, a place where, among a bikini- and swimsuit-clad crowd, you can immerse yourself in the beach ambience, have a few drinks and dance to the music, while planes coming in to land at the airport fly just metres above your head. A brilliant vibe in a mega-beach bar right by the sea!\n\nBora Bora is open during the summer season, and its daylight parties start at 4.00 p.m. Of course, if you want to go on clubbing into the night, Bora Bora has its own disco. Bora Bora is located in Platja d’en Bossa, on the seafront.\n\nPrivilege, the world’s biggest nightspot\n\nThis title tells us all we need to know. 10,000 revellers giving their all beneath a 25-metre-high ceiling. A vast space, the scale of which never fails to impress, even before a single chord is played, with a swimming pool below the DJ’s booth.\n\nOff course, if we add over-the-top music and a spectacular show into the mix, the whole thing becomes unstoppable, especially with the presence of the disco star, SuperMartxe. Privilege is not just about music: here you can even see erotic shows.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning the building’s cupola, from which you can get a good view of Ibiza town.\n\nPrivilege is near Amnesia Ibiza, in the San Rafael area. An interesting fact: it was here that the video for the song Barcelona, with Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé, was recorded for the 1992 Olympic Games.\n\nO Beach Ibiza (Ocean Beach)\n\nO Beach Ibiza is one of the most recent discotheques of the Balearic island. A place to enjoy an authentic pool party during the day in a 600 square meters pool and surrounded by beautiful people in an atmosphere of pure hedonism. In the O Beach you can enjoy the best house and dance music while witnessing different shows, with gogos and acrobats enlivening the party.\n\nThis space is located in the bay of San Antonio, west of the island, which allows you to enjoy magical sunsets in full party from its Sunset Roof Garden. O Beach is open from May to October.\n\nSwag Ibiza\n\nAlso in Platja d’en Bossa is Swag Ibiza, one of the island’s newest clubs, having opened in 2014. Its aim is to offer something different. The music styles range from rap, through reggaeton or trap, to hip hop. Urban music, seven days a week, with VIP areas where you can enjoy an exclusive night out.\n\nSince it opened, Swag has established itself as Ibiza’s leading urban music club. So, if that’s your style, this is the place to go.\n\nEs Paradis, out-and-out partying\n\nEs Paradis offers Ibiza’s definitive water party. This classic Ibizan establishment opened in 1975, and its great claim to fame is its magnificent interior, with columns and a huge pyramid-shaped ceiling dominating the venue. Es Paradis also has interior gardens, adding a feeling of freshness to an inviting party ambience. It has justifiably been described as Ibiza’s most beautiful nightclub.\n\nBut what makes Es Paradis outstanding is its water party every Wednesday night. Prepare to get soaked while you give it your all (as always). Having said that, don’t go there in just your swimsuit (wear it under your clothes).\n\nEs Paradis is open during the summer season, although it also holds certain parties during the winter months. You will find it on the beach front at San Antonio.\n\nSpace, dreaming of reopening\n\nWe cannot talk about Ibiza’s clubs without mentioning Space which, although it closed on 2 October 2016, still lingers in the memories of all those who have enjoyed electronic music parties on the island of Ibiza. In fact, Space was frequently acknowledged as being one of the best dance venues in the world.\n\nAnother club, Hi Ibiza, now stands on the site once occupied by Space in Playa d’en Bossa. There are rumours, which have been taken up by several media channels, that it is planned to reopen Space in 2022, so we recommend that you keep your ears open, and ask about it when you arrive in Ibiza. It’s also unclear where the new Space will be located, as Pepe Roselló, its former owner, has let it be known that he is not particularly interested in its former site, and that he and his partner are looking for the ideal location.\n\nEdén, your disco in San Antonio\n\nEdén is one of the most famous clubs in San Antonio (Sant Antoni de Portmany), and a place not to be missed if you want to enjoy its contemporary aesthetic and its latest generation of sound. Edén is no newcomer to the island, as it has been around since 1999, with different names, and in various guises. Renowned DJs such as Disclosure, Cristian Varela, Markus Schulz, Sasha and Lady Gaga have all appeared at this great Ibiza institution.\n\nAt Edén, everyone finds their place: on the central dance floor, in the VIP areas with their private car parks, or having a drink at one of its bars. Keep a date free to come and enjoy the nightlife, the music and the fun at its non-stop parties.\n\nWhere to stay in Ibiza\n\nThe Ibiza experience would not be complete without a stay in a hotel that offers us a much-needed oasis of calm so that later on we can enjoy this island’s party atmosphere. One of the recommended options is the Occidental Ibiza, a four-star hotel located a stone’s throw from the beach at Port des Torrent, and a few minutes away from the stunning coves of Cala Comte, Cala Tarida and Cala Bassa.Tempting, isn’t it? Moreover, the hotel has 346 very comfortable guest rooms, excellent facilities (adult swimming pools, bars, etc.) and a comprehensive range of options for both sport and relaxation. Definitely the ideal hotel if you’re travelling with friends."
