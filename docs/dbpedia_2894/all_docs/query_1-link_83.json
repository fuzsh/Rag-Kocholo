Exclusive clubs are of a high standard with marvellous decor, beautiful location, and offer the best clubbing experience ever.\n\nMuch as they are not easily accessible to all and sundry because of their high entry charges and unspecified membership procedures, a brief description will divulge why they will give you the best clubbing experience.

But one club in Europe - Berghain, seems to have put all this aside and has something else to be identified with - being the hardest club to get into. Is it because of the overpriced party ticket? The answer is no!\n\nBerghain is situated in a former East German power station. The club is famous for its world-class techno, hedonistic spirit, and now, its high-end culture. Whereas other things will help you get into the club, it is complicated to get into it because of the culture surrounding it.\n\nBeginning as a gay, fetish, and techno club, Berghain shaped the \"post-Wall\" clubbing culture in Berlin. According to Sven Marquardt - the infamous Berghain bouncer, only a few guys can select guests at the door. The guests have to understand what the place is all about and its no photo policy.\n\nThere are plenty of excellent refreshing places to hang out or party at that you will be spoilt for choice. Some of the most exclusive night clubs are mentioned above. However, the list is long. Depending on where you are, you can always find a fantastic club to take your clubbing experience to a whole new level.\n\nTuko.co.ke published an article about the best rappers in the world.
