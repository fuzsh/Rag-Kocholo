The” Privilege” is the best choice for everyone’s desires and can be found on the Balearic Islands.

You can meet millionaires, hippies, world stars and simple tourists on the dance floors of the club. This club is located between the hills of San Rafael, like a huge ship floating on the waves.

It creates a fantastic atmosphere, when the club is filled. You can spend all night on a garden terrace with high palms in the VIP area. There are several dance floors with different music styles in the club. Here the MTV program organizes different shows very often. Sometimes you can find free flyers in Ibiza for parties of well- known promoters. There is an opportunity to get discounts on drinks.\n\n“Privilege” enjoys a high status not only at Ibiza, but throughout the world. The light shows and the most beautiful dancers in Ibiza make your evening unforgettable.\n\nBy Nelly"
