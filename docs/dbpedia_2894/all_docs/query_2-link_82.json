        "text": "Privilege Ibiza’s parent company will receive €8.2 million in government funds to renovate the storied nightclub.\n\nPrivilege Ibiza shut its doors for an extended period in 2019 after authorities deemed several of its areas unsafe for patrons. At long last, that looks to change. The Council of Ibiza‘s Tourist Planning Commission has approved €8.2 million to renovate and eventually reopen the historic superclub.\n\nPeriódico de Ibiza y Formentera reports that the funds will be allocated to Grupo Empresa Matutes, which has owned Privilege since 2022. They will go toward structural improvements like plumbing and solar energy.\n\nPrivilege Ibiza was one of five tourist attractions awarded such sums, all of which amount to €23 million total. The biggest is Palladium Palmyra Ibiza. With the help of €13 million in government support, the beachside hotel will undergo renovations expected to bump it from four stars to five.\n\nA further €250,000 will go toward accessibility, air conditioning, and water improvements of the Es Cantó Apartments in Platja d’en Bossa. The improvements are intended to bring the lodgings, which are nearby superclubs like Ushuaïa and Hï Ibiza, up to three stars.\n\nNightlife has remained at the core of Ibiza tourism for decades. It at first drew only a handful of eccentrics during the hippy era — but after visits in the late ’80s by now-influential dance music figureheads like Paul Oakenfold and Danny Rampling, it grew more popular among UK vacationers for its bustling club scene than its scenic beaches.\n\nFrom 1979-1995, the space now occupied by Privilege was called Club Ku. The nearly 70,000-square-foot venue can entertain 10,000 guests at a time and has played host to DJ sets by the likes of Carl Cox, 808 State, Tiësto, The Blessed Madonna, and Jayda G.\n\nAt the time of writing, Privilege Ibiza has not shared a projected reopening timeline.\n\nFollow Privilege Ibiza:"
