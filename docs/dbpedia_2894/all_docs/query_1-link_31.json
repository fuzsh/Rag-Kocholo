Sapphire also took honors of Best Gentlemen's Club Drinks, Best Gentlemen's Club Lap Dances, Best Gentlemen's Club Strippers, and Best Bachelor Party.\" the No Cover Night Clubs reports.\n\n\"Club Sapphire Las Vegas may be the world's largest strip club, but it's also one of the nicest in Las Vegas. It features multiple rooms, multiple bars, and is always receiving rewards for a reason. It's a great venue with a staff that wants guests to let loose and enjoy themselves. Once you sign up on the No Cover Nightclubs guest list we take it from there and organize your free entrance into the club and free limo transportation to the gentlemen's club. Sapphire bottle service packages are also available.\n\n\"Sapphire does enforce a dress code for entrance.

The Las Vegas club is located in Winchester, Nevada, United States, a part of the Las Vegas Valley. The 71,000 sq ft (6,600 m2) enterprise includes 10 VIP sky boxes and three lounges, and is billed as the world's largest nightclub. It was sold in 2006 for US$80 million in an auction to one of the two former part-owners.\n\n\"In 2013 Sapphire Las Vegas opened the Sapphire Pool & Dayclub located at the south end of the club. The Sapphire Pool and Dayclub has 10 cabanas & 5 bungalows. The 10 cabanas are located on the main deck and has 2 pools. 1 of the 2 pools is available as a \"private pool\" package on the website. The 5 bungalows are located on the upper VIP area and includes a private pool area.\n\n\"Sapphire used to host Men of Sapphire, the only male-choreographed revue show with a private show room for women only with lush VIP seating and premium alcohol[3] as well as the Sapphire Comedy Hour featuring national headliners like comedian Jade Esteban Estrada.This establishment was featured in the season 2 finale of Not Safe with Nikki Glaser where Nikki Glaser purportedly spent 24 hours there.\" (Wikipedia)\n\n\"Sapphire LV was recently voted 'Best Gentlemen's Club' by the Las Vegas Review Journal in their annual 'Best of Las Vegas' competition. This was Sapphire's 8th consecutive year winning the title for best strip club in Vegas. In addition, Sapphire Las Vegas won \"Best Bachelor Party”, the official website says.\n\n\"As if this wasn't enough, Sapphire Pool & Day Club won Best Day Club in Las Vegas for the third consecutive year!\n\n\"The World's Largest Gentlemen's Club is BACK and better than ever. Vegas is booming and guests are eager to get back to the Best Gentlemen's club in Las Vegas. It's time to get back to Vegas and perform in front of a packed house every night. We hold auditions nightly after 8pm.\n\n\"Sapphire Las Vegas, the world’s largest gentlemen’s club and adult entertainment complex, debuts the ‘world’s largest club bouncer’ known as Mech ‘The Bot’ Johnson, a 15-ft tall robotic mech suit, during CES 2023,\" the official website says.\n\n\"“It only makes sense that the world’s largest gentlemen’s club would have the world’s largest security guard,” said Peter Feinstein, Managing Partner of Sapphire Las Vegas. “The fully human-piloted mech suit has traveled all the way from Vancouver and is excited to make its Vegas debut at Sapphire during CES 2023.”\n\nTestimonials from Yelp\n\n\"By far the best gentlemen's club I have ever been to. I didn't want to leave. I will be back soon!\"\n\n\"I have been here pre covid for a bachelor party and had a great time. I decided to come here post covid for my birthday with my wife. We wanted a more private experience, so we bypassed the main floor and went to the skybox. The staff was professional and nice, we were very impressed by the customer service. We look forward to coming back in the future.\"\n\n\"Always prepay for the packages online and get the free ride to the club. If you are looking for great entertainment and a time to remember than go to the skybox. Last advice is to be respectful to the entertainers and dress to impress.\"\n\nTestimonials from Tripadvisor\n\n\"You'll have a good time - Las Vegas has the most beautiful and \"classiest\" strippers of anywhere in the world.Also, it is perfectly safe in that area.\"\n\n\"Bottom line is that if you want some adult type entertainment you will have a great time at the vegas topless club.\"\n\n\"We usually go to Sapphire for a few hours one night on our longer trips to Vegas, because there are very few places in the country where couples are truly welcome at strip clubs. When we go, we usually each get a lap dance or two, again more for the novelty, and then enjoy a conversation with the dancer(s). They usually have very fascinating stories, and regardless of what many think, are often quite smart, educated, talented young women. At least that has been our experience at Sapphire.\"\n\nWorld's Largest Gentlemen's Club\n\nAddress: 3025 S Sammy Davis Jr Dr, Las Vegas, NV 89109, United States\n\nFacebook: Saphire Las Vegas\n\nHours: Closes soon ⋅ 4 AM ⋅ Reopens 8 PM\n\nPhone: +1 702-869-0003\n\nwebsite: https://sapphirelasvegas.com"
