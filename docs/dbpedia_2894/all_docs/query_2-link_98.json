        "text": "5 BEST Nightclubs in Ibiza in 2024\n\nUPDATED 2024: It has more than nightlife. In fact, the beaches are gorgeous, the old town is charming, and the food is tip-top. But it’s the Ibiza nightlife that made Ibiza famous. So if it’s your first time, or you’re a veteran, you’ll want to dedicate at least one night (or every night?!) to hitting up the best clubs in Ibiza!\n\nBeing based in Thailand, I know a few things about parties, but there is nowhere quite does clubs like Ibiza. So when you come, take down each and every one of these 5 best clubs in Ibiza:\n\nTOP-TIP: If you want something to either warm you up for the Ibiza night-life, or you’re in recovery mode from the night before, I massively recommend taking this 3 hour boat trip (with unlimited drinks!), snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding etc. $90 is a STEAL!\n\nCheck it out HERE. The perfect answer to those crazy Ibiza nights.\n\nHï Ibiza (formally Space):\n\nThe newest club on the list. The club here used to be called Space, but no longer. Now it’s more plush, a little higher end, but still a crazy club. In fact, Hi Ibiza was voted the best nightclub in the world in 2018!\n\nThis Ibiza nightclub is in Playa d’en Bossa which is located on the outskirts of Ibiza Town, close to the airport. It’s big in the electronic scene, with world famous names playing nightly in high season. Just don’t expect to remember too much of it the next day!\n\nPrivilege:\n\nIt is credited for being the biggest nightclub in the world where a number of International celebrities like P. Diddy, Jade Jagger and Madonna has played host here. This nightclub lies sandwiched between San Antonio and Ibiza Town. Other unique features of the nightclub are its 25-meter high ceiling, tall windows which render picturesque views of the island and a swimming pool. It hosts all-night party during the summer season and also some special weekly events.\n\nTechno and house is the order of play, but it’s the outdoor parties, with the music still blaring at sunrise that brings the people every day. It’s found in San Atonia (10 euro from Ibiza town), and entrance ranges from 30-50 Euro depending on who is playing.\n\nAmnesia:\n\nAnother former official ‘best club in the world’, the aptly named Amnesia doesn’t kick off until around midnight but it runs till dawn so pace yourself guys – it’s not a race! During the summer months, it attracts a huge influx of international tourists. The club can accumulate as many as 4000 people and often features superstars DJs like Paul Van Dyk and Deadmau5, the world-famous Cream parties are held on Thursday nights so get your credit cards at the ready for that whopper.\n\nExpect plenty of foam parties and lasers, and even Cristiano Ronaldo has made an appearance here. It’s found in the Poligono de Montecristo, and cover ranges from 30 to 60 euro.\n\nPacha:\n\nThe old faithful, and an iconic Ibiza nightclub. First established on the Stiges beach in the year 1967 it later arrived in Ibiza in the year 1973. This Ibiza nightclub remains open the whole year round and as host, it currently has Sarah Main a popular Australian DJ. There are other renowned DJs like Peter Tong and David Morales who also are frequent visitors here. But beware, this place is pricer – the most expensive club on the island with regular cover charges of $70 and $15 beers, if VIP style is what you’re after – look no further than Pacha.\n\nFunky room, hip-hop, electric, 80s and 90s stuff. Pacha has it all. Even a terrace to escape the madness. It’s a 10 minute walk from Ibiza town, and entrance can range from 30 Euro all the way to 90 Euro!\n\nUshuaïa, Ibiza\n\nOne of the best clubs in Ibiza, certainly the best open-air club in Ibiza, is undoubtedly Ushuaia Ibiza Beach Club. Opened in 2012, it stays open until midday the next day! It’s an Instagrammers dream with Balinese beds, huge screens. This is what you thought clubs in Ibiza would look like. It’s found on the beach Playa D’En Bossa 10, 10Euro taxi from Ibiza town. Tickets range from 30-70Euro\n\nThere you have it folks – the 5 best clubs in Ibiza. So whether you’ve just received your Spain visa, and your on your search for holiday rentals in Ibiza with cozycozy.com and you’re good to go. Enough dirty baselines, short skirts and heavy-handed cocktails to give you the best night of your life followed by the hangover that promises “I’m never drinking again” – yeah, yeah we never learn. So if clubbing holidays are your thing, nightclubs in Ibiza will never let you down! Happy travels!\n\nRemember, travel insurance is only $9 a week here. Don’t travel without it!"
