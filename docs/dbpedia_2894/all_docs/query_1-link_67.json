        "text": "Superclub\n\nA superclub is a very large or superior nightclub, often with several rooms with different themes. The term was first coined in Mixmag, the British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, in 1995, referring to the new wave of clubs such as Ministry of Sound and Cream, which were dominating the English club scene.Superclubs may include nightclubs that have high capacity, or are multi-story, high profile, and operate city and region wide or are well known. Some superclubs are owned and managed by a dance music record label or a club that was or is culturally important. The term may also be used to define its position within the club scene hierarchy.Forerunners of contemporary superclubs already existed in the early 20th century. The Guardian describes the Moka Efti in Berlin, a major dancing establishment of the Golden Twenties, as a \"1920s superclub\".Privilege Ibiza is the \"world's largest nightclub\" according to the Guinness Book of Records, with a capacity of 10,000 people.\n\nSuperclub\n\nSuperclub is a term used to refer to a nightclub owned and managed by a dance music record label, such as The Ha√ßienda club, which was owned by Factory Records.
