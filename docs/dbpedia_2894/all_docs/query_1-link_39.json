        "text": "Did D12 diss Eminem?\n\nNo, Eminem has not left D12 and is not leaving. Some members from D12 come to concerts and sing with him and they are still his best friends. Though most of the D12 members are busy with solo careers and haven't released an album lately, they are still together, and Eminem is still part of the group. They haven't announced an upcoming album as far as I know, though, but they haven't announced to discontinue the group. They will most likely turn out like G-Unit, where they slowly die and are not well-known but have one member, in this case that being Eminem, that hits big fame, like 50 cent in G-Unit's case. I know Bizarre and Eminem have started solo careers and probably many others have, too. I originally wrote this but forgot to log in. Oops!"
