        "text": "IBIZA USHUAIA CLUB UshuaÃ¯a Ibiza Beach Hotel offers a revolutionary new hotel concept based on a modern environment where design and a relaxed setting are the main protagonists. The hotel will offer five room categories all themed with state-of-the-art features and special amenities from chromotherapy to aromatherapy.\n\nOffering a combination of chic beach club, dance venue and stylish hotel, the property aims to bring back the heyday of outdoor Ibiza where style, sunshine and dance dominated the party scene. Minimalism and the latest technology provide a backdrop for Balinese temples, crocodiles sculptures and even a 3 m elephant statue nestling in the tropical undergrowth.\n\nSpectacular water features are everywhere, cascadi through the sushi restaurant, past the 'swim-up' rooms and in the central pool that comes complete with an aquatic bar. Rooms follow the minimalistic theme and feature LED light chromotherapy, aromatherapy, amd blackout curtains to adapt to your mood. Spectacular LED panels are flashing across the facade. Underneath those lights next to the reception, sushi restaurant and fashion shops is amusical surprise: a state-of-the-art recording studio.\n\nIBIZA AMNESIA CLUB\n\nIf the walls of this old finca could speak, their tales would fascinate you, you may have even been a part of them. From Alfredo's early days to the Oakenfold-Rampling Holloway experience in 1987 through mammoth residencies such as Up Yer Ronson, Cream and Cocoon, Amnesia has always been a true temple to clubbing.\n\nA cavernous main room with the god like elevated DJ booth that has seen pretty much every name in dance music history grace its decks, from which point nights of pure hedonism and lucid malevolence have been composed and experienced by the swinging multitude in the pit of a dance floor below.\n\nVIP - Amnesia VIP area is like another club in itself and is situated above the dance floor; on balconies in the terrace and tiered upwards in the main room. With a capacity, across both rooms, that is close to 1000 when full to bursting (try every Monday at Cocoon for example), the VIP alone has 4 bars and extensive tables overlooking the masses below.\n\nPACHA IBIZA CLUB The Godfather of ibicenco nightlife, Pacha Ibiza club has been at the top of the tree since 1973 when an old finca in the marshland outside Ibiza Town was used for parties bearing the now globally franchised name. Pacha has more charm and character than the rest of island's clubs put together; its endless stairs that interconnect all the rooms, the maze of tiered levels in the main room, the first time you discover the funky room and then stay all night - this is Pacha club.\n\nThere is something about Pacha in Ibiza that oozes class - the original clubbing with style - this is where the rich and famous come to party, yet the music has always been the core component of the club's success! Although there have been the odd variation with nights like Perfecto or Renaissance, Pacha is generally a house music only zone, though it must be recognised that that tag includes everything from the deep and smooth of Def Mix through the high energy and singalongs of Erick Morillo to the blatant sound of F*** Me I'm Famous.\n\nHARD ROCK HOTEL IBIZA Hard Rock Hotel Ibiza is the first Hard Rock Hotel in Europe. An oasis of pure entertaintment that combines the style and energy of the brand and Ibiza.\n\nHard Rock Hotel Ibiza is located on the famous Playa dÂ´en Bossa, only 5 km from the town. Inspired by the purest rock-style and the atmosphere of Ibiza, the hotel offers modern accommodation with a style all of its own and facilities that invite you to try different sensory experiences. The hotel has 493 rooms, Conference Center and meeting rooms space with capacity for up to six hundred people, Rock Shop and unique Memorabilia. We also have amazing facilities such as a Rock Spa, a private Rock Spa VIP Area, as well as a Body Rock fitness centre for you to keep in shape.\n\nFrom our unsurpassed collection of rock memorabilia to the internationally recognized live acts performing at venues right on site, you'll be surrounded by the sound day and night. Who knowsâ you may be the next individual moved to pen lyrics and notes in tribute to our unique slice of paradise. Hard Rock and Ibiza are inextricably immersed and inspired by the power of music. The two combined make for a musical experience you'll never forget.\n\nHI IBIZA CLUB Hï Ibiza is a new club by Ushuaïa Entertainment located in the heart of Ibiza clubland, Playa d'en Bossa. Opening in summer 2019, this state of the art venue will showcase the most exciting names in electronic music, bringing together serious music lovers to experience a nightlife evolution.\n\nHï Ibiza (formerly known as Space) is located in the heart of Ibiza clubland, Playa d'en Bossa.\n\nOpening in summer 2023, this state of the art venue will showcase the most exciting names in electronic music, bringing together serious music lovers to experience a nightlife evolution.\n\nIBIZA DC-10 CLUB Despite being around for over 25 years, this outpost of buildings known as Can Miquel or dc10 is Ibiza's most talked about and controversial club of the last decade - bar none - and it's all thanks to one party. The club, that once had a plane on the roof, began life as just another bit-part small space for random parties until the now very well known Italians Andrea and Antonio, with a little bit of help from Charlie Chester, started a Monday morning afterhours to complement the popular Home Sundays at Space, which finished at 6am.\n\nCirco Loco was marvel of Ibiza afterhours clubbing. free entry, true open air clubbing and top quality house music that never wavered far from tribal, which was flavour of the month. That people like Sasha, Danny Tenaglia, Pete Tong would turn up unannounced and play for free, and sometimes not be allowed on the decks, became part of the growing legend of the club. Gradually, the afterhours party became a party in its own right and the whole operation became much more commercial, even Mixmag was doing cover features on it by 2002.\n\nIBIZA PRIVILEGE CLUB The self-proclaimed 'World's Biggest Club', the club formerly known as Ku had been a classic open air party place for the Ibiza jet set during the 1980s with a swimming pool (over which the DJ booth would later be situated) that became emblematic of the club's flamboyance. After legislation banning open air clubs, Privilege had one roof collapse in a storm before the aircraft hangar of a club we see today was created in the early 90s.\n\nChanging from Ku to Privilege in the early 90s, though it was still called Ku by most people (and promoted that way on flyers), it was to be Manumission from 1994 that would bring the club its greatest notoriety.\n\nFor over a decade, but particularly from 1997-2002, Manumission was quite simply a monster, bringing in close to 13,000 on the busy nights and influencing the whole modus operandi of bars and restaurants on the island each Monday evening.\n\nDESTINO IBIZA Destino Pacha Ibiza Resort is the latest adventure from Pacha Group. Standing atop the cliffs of Cap Martinet, on its own corner of the island, its location offers a spectacular panoramic view of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe resort embodies 163 rooms and suites, some featuring their own private garden with infinity pool, outdoor lounge and dining areas. Every room offers the perfect blend of style and comfort, integrating the indoors with the outdoors.\n\nThe jewel of the property is the swimming pool, a modern oasis surrounded by palm trees, sunbeds and day beds with an extra large Jacuzzi to enjoy the sunset.\n\nThe restaurant, with a capacity for 250 guests, features a fusion of Japanese, Mediterranean and Central American flavors made from fresh local ingredients.\n\nBecause Pacha cares about how you care for your body, there is an outdoor gym, juice bar and yoga studio on the premises. But the fun does not end when the sun goes down, come and enjoy with us the best open air events the White Island has to offer, followed by the amazing Club Tox Prive parties\n\nIBIZA ROCKS HOTEL The Ibiza Rocks Hotel sits right in the heart of San Antonio just 500m from the famous Sunset Strip and 300m from the West End. Since the Ibiza Rocks Hotel opened in May 2008 it has become THE destination hotel for a new generation of music lovers.\n\nThis branded Hotel on the site of the former Hotel Club Paraiso, now plays home to all the Ibiza Rocks events and includes a purpose built and permanent stage set up, locating within the central courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.\n\nOther than the stellar entertainment programme, the Hotel itself is packed with facilities and things to do. Ibiza Rocks Hotel features 2 outdoor pools, one of which plays host to daily pool parties with the biggest club brands around, 2 bars the Tropicana and Lobby, as well as the Electric Bar & Grill which serves up delicious, freshly made burgers, wraps, salads and smoothies by the main pool.\n\nIBIZA O BEACH O beach Ibiza, one of the most luxurious venues of the island, encapsulates the ultimate beach club dedicated to creating a unique and luxurious lifestyle experience for those looking for that ideal daytime destination to relax and party under the Mediterranean sun. Situated on the West Coast of Ibiza in San Antonio, O Beach is located on the S'Arenal beach front with beautiful ocean views by day and the stunning Ibiza sunset at dusk.\n\nDesigned so you can plan your day exactly the way you want to, the 600m2 pool area is surrounded by luxurious day beds both in and around the pool which acts as the perfect place for socialites who like to spend their days partying with friends while bronzing under the Balearic sunshine. Prefer to relax and unwind away from the masses? Escape to your own haven by relaxing in one of our lavish hammocks or sun loungers set within secluded corners of our beautifully landscaped gardens.\n\nOCTAN IBIZA CLUB Octan Ibiza, a new club concept cutting a path in Ibizaâs hectic club landscape. Octan Ibiza offers an alternative to the traditional ibiza super club experience, something more intimate and personal, more welcoming and inclusive. Octan aims to bring back the culture to club culture by taking a more creative approach to both the club environment and their musical programming. Their diverse musical program will cater to a broad range of musical tastes. Their trusted resident DJs set the tone each night, cultivating our musical identity and maintaining a consistency of quality and a diversity of sound throughout the club.\n\nOccupying the former Sankeys Ibiza venue, Octan has kept the essence of the buildings gritty warehouse aesthetic, stripping it back to the most essential club elements, dark rooms illuminated with subtle light schemes and resonating with finely tuned sound systems. The neutral backdrop of the venue acts as a canvas for street artists and projectionists, embracing creativity and injecting vital colour and soul into to the space, creating a heady mix of music, art and light. The club itself is a warren of different environments, low ceiling basements, cavernous main rooms, starlit terraces, secret cinemas and secret sound systems. Different rooms, vibes and music culminating in an enthralling club experience.\n\nIBIZA ES PARADISE Es Paradis Terrenal translates as Paradise on Earth and anyone who has stepped inside this beautiful arena will testify to the worthiness of such a title. Like a cross between a Greek temple and a garden centre, this arena is perhaps the most ornate clubbing space on the globe. Established in 1975, Es Paradis is one of the founding fathers of Ibiza clubland, yet it is the notorious water parties held here, combined with its pyramid roof, that make it iconic of Ibiza's extravagant and majestic clubs.\n\nIts San Antonio location meant that it was one of the first used by British promoters and in the mid to late 90s saw the likes of Sasha, David Morales, Erick Morillo, Danny Rampling gracing the podium like DJ booth above the small central amphitheatre of a dance floor. Since the dawn of the new millennium, Es Paradis' fall from grace could hardly have been more spectacular, with the exciting nights of the 90s long forgotten, the ubiquitous water parties remain the unique draw but if its cutting edge electronic sounds you seek, then look elsewhere.\n\nEDEN IBIZA Eden Ibiza is located in the heart of San Antonio and has been a big part of the ibiza clubbing scene since opening in 1999. The club has recently had a huge refurbishment meaning the venue is now as plush as ever, boasting a great and sophisticated main room, a second room with independent access and a powerful and exclusive sound system to Ibiza: Incubus Gold by Void - a music loverâs dream.\n\nNow for 2015, Eden has re-opened after having a summer off last year with six fantastic new nights called Colours festival; Harder Faster Ibiza; Midnight Ibiza; Cubbo nights; Judement by Judge Jules and Faux Basement. The clubâs DJ portfolio includes key names in the music industry including the likes of Pete Tong, Judge Jules, Disclosure, Goldfish, Markus Schulz, Sasha, Ferry Corsten, Dubfire, Luciano, Cristian Varela, Groove Armada, Lady Gaga.\n\nCLUB CHINOIS Formally Heart Ibiza, London Mayfair's haunt Club Chinois, offers contemporary/Balearic blended sophistication, boasting 3000 sqm in size. If youâre into your celeb spotting, then youâre sure to see quite a few recognisable faces here, as itâll understandably be the go-to spot for the high rollers and haut monde of society. Club Chinois is an exclusive nightclub, with a decadent twist â take a journey back in time and immerse yourself in Asian luxury. Club Chinois is extremely opulent, whilst offering an intimate nightclub setting. Think upbeat, contemporary and very playful with international headliner DJs . Designing a sound experience within their space with diverse references such as âMTV Unpluggedâ 90, new technologies and the real essence of Ibizaâs party spirit from the 60âs is not a dream anymore. Laleh Assefi (Parisian Design Studio) has created something truly sumptuous, and with a host of globally-celebrated DJs and Producers expected to play for the (up to) 1000 revellers. Club Chinois will stay open throughout the year for residents and winter tourists to enjoy.\n\nCOVA SANTA Cova Santa is one of Ibiza's best kept secrets! It's a venue boasting not only a mind blowing club destination but also a top notch restaurant and garden with stunning views within a beautiful villa location. Tucked away in km7 of the island, last seasons Cova Santa threw some of the best underground parties on the island including the Music On after parties,\n\nMaceo Plex's Boiler Room session as well as hosting nights for Guy Gerber and the HYTE crew. This is a perfect destination to spend all evening long dining at the wonderful restaurant and then continuing your night at the club listening to a deep set from the likes of Joseph Capriati, Marco Carola or Loco Dice."
