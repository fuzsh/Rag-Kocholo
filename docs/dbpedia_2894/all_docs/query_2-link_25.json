        "text": "Ibiza is a wish of those who wants a perfect holyday, positive feelings, good music and freedom. The” Privilege” is the best choice for everyone’s desires and can be found on the Balearic Islands. It is the largest nightclub in the world with a capacity of 10,000 people, according to the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nThe main room has the size of an aircraft hangar, with a height of 25m and a huge swimming pool in the center of the room where you can cool down the “enthusiasm”. Before becoming famous, the club was a small pool with bar that served the residents of San Rafael village. The club acquires an excellent reputation thanks to the creative leadership. The building was used in the video for the song “Barcelona” by Freddie Mercury. He often organized extravagant parties in this club. You can meet millionaires, hippies, world stars and simple tourists on the dance floors of the club. This club is located between the hills of San Rafael, like a huge ship floating on the waves. The music is ambiguous such as Home, trance, Progressive, RNB.\n\nThe “Privilege” invites the most famous GJs of the world in recent year – James Holden, Danny Tenaglia, Armin van Buurena, Tiesto. The disco is recording sound office equipment. Entering in the night club through a long staircase, you find yourself in the midst of the events on the biggest dance floor in the world. It creates a fantastic atmosphere, when the club is filled. You can spend all night on a garden terrace with high palms in the VIP area. There are several dance floors with different music styles in the club. Here the MTV program organizes different shows very often. Sometimes you can find free flyers in Ibiza for parties of well- known promoters. There is an opportunity to get discounts on drinks.\n\n“Privilege” enjoys a high status not only at Ibiza, but throughout the world. The light shows and the most beautiful dancers in Ibiza make your evening unforgettable.\n\nBy Nelly"
