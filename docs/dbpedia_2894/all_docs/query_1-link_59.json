        "text": "Luis Fonsi's summer hit Despacito has officially become the most-streamed song of all time - only six months after it was released.\n\nIt has been played 4.6 billion times on streaming services.\n\nOn YouTube, the video for the song has been viewed more than 1.8 billion times.\n\nIt has also reached number one in 35 different countries.\n\nThe song was originally in Spanish, but became popular in the English-speaking world when Justin Bieber heard the song in a nightclub and asked to add a verse.\n\nIt has actually taken the record off Bieber's own song Sorry, which held the streaming title before.\n\nWhen asked why he thinks the song is so popular, 39-year-old Fonsi told BBC Music: \"Obviously, it's a very catchy melody. The way the chorus starts Des-Pa-Ci-To is very easy to remember.\n\n\"And obviously you add Justin Bieber to that, and it brings another angle to all of this. But I wish I knew exactly what the secret was, so I could apply it to all my future songs!\"\n\nSo which other songs have smashed amazing records like this track?\n\nThis record is held by Elton John and his song Candle in the Wind.\n\nIt sold 1.55 million copies when it was released as a tribute to Princess Diana, who died in 1997.\n\nIt has sold almost 5 million copies in total, making it the biggest-selling UK single ever too.\n\nEd Sheeran didn't go breaking a record with just one song - but 14!\n\nIn March 2017, the pop sensation sent the charts into meltdown with the release of his new album Ã·.\n\n14 tracks from the album all went inside the UK Top 15, with Something Just Like This by Chainsmokers & Coldplay stopping him from having every single spot.\n\nEveryone knows the dance to this one - yes, Psy's catchy track Gangnam Style took the world by storm when it was released.\n\nIt was so popular that it became the first video to reach more than one billion views on YouTube.\n\nYouTube had to even change how part of their site worked because it wasn't able to cope with such a high number of views!\n\nJust as Despacito took the streaming record off Justin Bieber's Sorry, Gangnam Style stole this record from Bieber's music video for the single Baby.\n\nYou might think that a song that has spent 40, 50, even 60 weeks in the UK chart would hold the title.\n\nBut no, Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol, which was released in 2006, has spent a whopping 166 weeks in the UK charts.\n\nIts success is partly down to the fact it is used in TV programmes a lot.\n\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, the biggest singalong was by Young Voices and involved 293,978 people at 1,616 different places throughout the UK who all sang Lean on Me at 2:45pm on 9 December 2005.\n\nWe bet that would have been rather loud if they were in the same room!\n\nThe most number of people to sing on one single is 275,000 on S Club 7's Have You Ever.\n\nThe track was released for BBC Children in Need back in 2001 and featured contributions from 3,616 schools in the UK.\n\nYou might know Billie Piper as one of Doctor Who's companions.\n\nBut she used to also be a singer! And her song Because We Want To actually got her the record of becoming the youngest person to debut at No 1 in 1998, at the age of just 15.\n\nThe shortest song to enter the US charts was just 45 seconds long!\n\nPPAP - which stands for Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen - by Japanese artist Piko-Taro entered the Billboard Hot 100 in October 2016."
