        "text": "With so many things to do it´s no wonder that Ibiza nightlife certaily offers it all. Ibiza is renowned for its unique clubbing experience. And boy, clubbing there is as wild as ever. The Spanish island, which bathes in glorious sunlight, has many venues being rated in the top 10 club venues in the world.\n\nSo, where is Ibiza located?\n\nIt is in Eastern Spain, just about 150 km off the Valencian coast. Deemed the largest of Spain’s Balearic Island, the holy ground of electronic music covers an area of around 572.56 square kilometers. The island offers a legendary nightlife full of glamorous parties, world-famous DJs, and some of the best clubs across the globe; hence, it attracts revelers from far and wide.\n\nFor such a tiny island, Ibiza has a lot of stuff going on. If you do not have someone who can walk you through the basics, it can be really overwhelming.\n\nThis article offers simple advice guides on the nightlife in Ibiza to give you a bit of basic knowledge and, more importantly, help you get the most out of your experience in the island.\n\nIbiza Nighlife Scene\n\nThe Ibiza club scene season kicks off in May with the IMS or International Music Summit and loads of opening parties. It then keeps rolling throughout the blazing summer months and ends in late September, particularly during closing fiestas. August is not only the hottest month on the “island that never sleeps” but also the busiest, so be prepared for huge crowds and high Ibiza nightlife prices.\n\nIf you are going to check out the Ibiza party scene in low season, keep in mind that the only big club that stays open all year round is Pacha. Otherwise, you can expect to find lots of smaller venues to dance the night away, including dozens of cool parties around Easter and New Year’s Eve.\n\nWhere`s the best nightlife in Ibiza?\n\nObviously, you want to experience the never-ending partying on the island.\n\nYou have two options here:\n\nFirst, you can head to Ibiza town.\n\nSecond, you can try two of the most energetic resorts, namely, Playa d’en Bossa and San Antonio. Both of these resorts house the most popular and largest clubs on the island.\n\nApart from fabulous nightlives, the island is also known for many Ibiza points of interest like lively boat parties. The latter offers a mix of bouncing beats, sunshine, and bikini-clad revelers – all contributing to an unforgettable clubbing experience.\n\nIt is worth noting, though, that most boats depart from and Playa d’en Bossa and San Antonio, and a ticket often gets you an entry to a club and one free drink aboard. You should also check out some of the island’s sunset boat parties, which are often held in popular Ibiza beaches.\n\nBest Nightclubs in Ibiza\n\nIf you are wondering which part of Ibiza is the best for clubs, look no further. Below is a list of the best Ibiza clubs.\n\nAmnesia\n\nOne of the biggest clubs in Ibiza, Amnesia has been a mainstay on the island’s nightlife scene since its conception. It is home to many of the hottest Ibiza party packages, including Paris Hilton’s glamorous Foam & Diamonds. Amnesia is on the main road that connects Ibiza Town with San Antonio and is also near the village of San Rafael.\n\nPrivilege\n\nPrivilege is actually just right across the street from the aforementioned club. There is a reason why it is considered one of the best clubs in Ibiza, especially since it can cater nearly 10,000 revelers. Otherwise, it would not hold a Guinness World Record for being the “world’s biggest nightclub.” Privilege offers 14 bars and a number of exclusive VIP zones. It is well-known for grandiose shows and internationally-recognized DJs.\n\nSpace\n\nThis is absolutely one of the legendary nightclubs in Ibiza. Not only does it impress revelers with state-of-the-art sound systems, but it also has a star-studded line-up and memorable Sunday sessions. Space, which can be found near Playa d’en Bossa, has won the “Best Global Club” award at the International Dance Music Awards four times.\n\nPacha\n\nPacha is perfect for individuals who are really into upscale clubbing. It is the island’s oldest, flashiest, and most iconic super club. For the past few years, Pacha has been known for house and techno. However, it has also become a home for 5 different musical Ibiza festivals. Pacha can be found in Ibiza Town’s Marina Botafoch area. It is best known for Flower Power and David Guetta’s “F*** Me I’m Famous.”\n\nUshuaia\n\nThis club is also located in Playa d’en Bossa, and sits right next to Space. It offers some of the most spectacular daytime clubbing, which is not only known in Ibiza but also the entire Mediterranean. Ushuaia is an eccentric open-air party venue known for celebrity clientele, frequent collaborations, and hedonistic poolside soirées, among many others. The club has housed some of the greatest names in electronic music, such as Armin Van Buuren and David Guetta.\n\nIbiza has further top-rated clubs to its name, including Es Paradis. The latter is located in the waterfront in San Antonio and offers a striking décor mixed with legendary water parties. Another club worth mentioning is the DC10. It is a nightclub situated on the road to Las Salinas, and is dubbed as Ibiza’s underground electronic music institution. .\n\nUseful Tips in Ibiza\n\nIf you want to travel to Ibiza Spain and experience a one of a kind nightlife, you need to be prepared. You must plan your night out in the island ahead. Here are some useful tips to keep in mind.\n\nClub Tickets\n\nAlthough there is nothing wrong about buying tickets right at the venue, it is always best to buy them beforehand. Doing so simply ensures that you get the most reasonable price and, more importantly, guaranteed entry.\n\nBesides, most nightclubs in Ibiza tend to sell out quickly. So, as much as possible, get your tickets in advance. It is your safest bet.\n\nThe Music Bars\n\nWhen visiting Ibiza, it is a crime not to check many of its music bars. As a matter of fact, they are a vital part of the Ibiza club scene. It is where you can find other clubbers who are warming up with some drinks before going to clubs. The island’s music bars are a perfect place to dance the night away in a more relaxed, less intense atmosphere.\n\nInterestingly, most of these bars offer free entry and their drinks are significantly cheaper. Nonetheless, you will be in awe with their local and guest DJs.\n\nFlying Solo\n\nIf your friends are too busy to accompany you, there is no need to worry. You can still experience the best of the White Isle even when you are on your own. Actually, it is unlikely for you to feel alone you there, as there are tons of individuals who also make the solo trip to the island. What is important is that you are going to go home with a truckload of unforgettable memories.\n\nNothing can absolutely top that!\n\nHere´s a bonus tip, have a look at 7 tips to pack to Ibiza.\n\nWell, there you have it! These heaps of advice should be enough to help you experience the best things to do in Ibiza. Just do not be afraid to ask other clubbers or revelers about what they recommend.\n\nThe island has a friendly atmosphere, anyway. Above all, do yourself a huge favour and enjoy!"
