        "text": "A great bar can be a great many things.\n\nA place you go to wind down, or to blow off steam. A place to try a new cocktail, or order an old favorite. A place to go out on the town, or to pop around the corner.\n\nBars can be all these things to people – and nowhere is it easier to see that than in our inaugural USA TODAY Bars of the Year list.\n\nSelected by our network of food writers across the nation – from The Arizona Republic to Florida Today – these bars represent the best neighborhood taverns, the finest cocktail meccas, the coziest wine bars and the beachiest beach bars.\n\nWhen we set out to spotlight the USA TODAY Bars of the Year, we didn't select the places you would find on your average roundup of best bars. Our food writers are not just spending a few days passing through a city in search of what it has to offer. They live in the towns they cover. They work there. They drink there.\n\nThese bars are the places we love – a mix of old, new and in-between. They’re places with stories to tell, places that should be on your bucket list when you travel and your favorites list where you live.\n\nHere they are, the 27 USA TODAY Bars of the Year for 2024.\n\nBarcoa Agaveria | Phoenix, Arizona\n\nDetails: 829 N. First Ave.; 602-980-0788, barcoaphx.com\n\nBarcoa is a cocktail bar built around celebrating Sonoran spirits with a massive list of tequilas, mezcals, bacanora, sotol, raicilla and distilado de agave available on their own, in flights and shaken into cocktails. From straightforward margaritas to more unusual tipples like a banana-infused mezcal Negroni, an elote old-fashioned and a bright green pistachio milk and mezcal concoction, the drinks are boozy and well-balanced odes to the spirits they contain. Many of the bottles come from small Mexican producers, which means you won’t find them anywhere else. Hidden below a more casual cantina, this basement bar welcomes agave nerds and newcomers alike. There’s always something new to taste or learn. — Felicia Campbell, The Arizona Republic\n\nRead a full review of Barcoa.\n\nBoycott Bar | Phoenix, Arizona\n\nDetails: 4301 N. Seventh Ave.; 602-825-6240, boycottbarphx.com\n\nFeatured in “The Lesbian Bar Project” – a documentary by filmmakers Erica Rose and Elina Street that chronicles the decline of lesbian bars and celebrates the ones that remain – Boycott Bar in Phoenix’s Melrose District is one of only 33 lesbian bars in the United States. Audrey Corley opened the cozy, dimly lit bar in 2004 because, while there were several gay bars in Phoenix, no places catered specifically to women. She wanted to offer a safe, inclusive experience for the community. In the years since, it’s become a Phoenix staple for karaoke, sip-and-paint classes, themed dance parties and a place just to have a drink in a lively watering hole where all are welcome. — Bahar Anooshahr, The Arizona Republic\n\nRead a full review of Boycott Bar.\n\nDeer Park Tavern | Newark, Delaware\n\nDetails: 108 W. Main St.; 302-369-9414, deerparktavern.com\n\nLegend has it that poet Edgar Allan Poe visited the St. Patrick's Inn – now home to Newark's famous Deer Park Tavern – slipped in the mud and put a curse on the building. True story? Who knows, but it's a good tale – and a raven, a nod to Poe's poem, is part of the tavern's logo. No one pays the Poe curse any mind. The landmark, popular with University of Delaware students and town locals, was established in 1851 and has become the best-known watering hole on campus for generations of UD students. The former hotel is always a quintessential college bar experience, although some locals love tossing back a few cold ones in the downstairs side area known as the \"townie bar.\" — Patricia Talorico, Delaware News Journal\n\nRead a full review of Deer Park Tavern.\n\nFlora-Bama | Perdido Key, Florida\n\nDetails: 17401 Perdido Key Drive; 251-980-5118, florabama.com\n\nThe world-famous bar on the Florida-Alabama state line can capture almost anyone’s heart, from greats like Kenny Chesney and Jimmy Buffett to the bikini-wearing, Bushwhacker-drinking barflies who have claimed Flora-Bama as their watering hole since 1964. Decades of Sharpie signatures line the bar’s wooden walls, and a string of well-worn bras sags over the main performing stage. While live music is a main attraction, the Flora-Bama’s calendar of annual events has patrons packing the sandy beaches in April for the Interstate Mullet Toss and gathering around the table for a Thanksgiving potluck. While Flora-Bama screams down-home beach bar, you can splurge on dinner next door at the Flora-Bama Yacht Club with waterfront views, award-winning chefs and local seafood. — Brittany Misencik, Pensacola News Journal\n\nRead a full review of Flora-Bama.\n\nThe Gator Club | Sarasota, Florida\n\nDetails: 1490 Main St.; 941-366-5969, thegatorclub.com\n\nLocated in downtown Sarasota near the city’s famed Bayfront, The Gator Club is a two-story bar and nightclub boasting more than 110 years of history, including bootleg whiskey, illegal gambling, an upstairs brothel and the kind of spirits that can’t be contained by a glass. Upon entering, guests encounter two bars and an elevated stage frequented by bands such as the beloved reggae act Jah Movement. Patrons are advised to proceed with caution up the rickety old staircase to the second floor, where DJs transform a former living room into a pulsating dance floor. In the back of the same floor, a cozy bar offers high-end hooch, the madam’s teller’s cage and the setting for The Gator Club’s scariest ghost stories. — Wade Tatangelo, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nRead a full review of The Gator Club.\n\nSam's Silver Circle | Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nDetails: 1102 Fletcher Ave.; 317-636-6288, samssilvercircle.com\n\nA floor-to-ceiling mosaic of license plates, beverage advertisements and Sports Illustrated covers celebrates nearly a century of slinging hot pizza and pouring cold beer at Sam’s Silver Circle. Anchored at the corner of Fletcher Avenue and Shelby Street since 1938, the Fountain Square staple once attracted the region’s best darts players. Now, it’s a quintessential neighborhood haunt stocked with seemingly inflation-proof beer and plenty of greasy food to soak it up. Karaoke, trivia and bingo nights fall once a week, and there are still always darts to be thrown. The bar’s unofficial slogan, “Follow me to Sam’s,” is one of the best things you can hear on a late-night pub crawl. — Bradley Hohulin, The Indianapolis Star\n\nRead a full review of Sam's Silver Circle.\n\nHello, Marjorie | Des Moines, Iowa\n\nDetails: 717 Locust St.; 515-369-2296, hellomarjorie.com\n\n“The prettiest girls in the world live in Des Moines,” boasts a pink LED sign hanging over a fireplace. The quote from Jack Kerouac’s 1957 novel “On the Road” defines Hello, Marjorie, a step back in time to the 1950s when midcentury modern decor ruled. The retro cocktail lounge in the former Des Moines Register & Tribune building from owner Nick Tillinghast serves some of the most creative cocktails in the Midwest. Tillinghast carved out conversational seating areas outfitted with retro couches in golds and hunter greens, low-slung chairs and buffets decorated with old books, globes and lamps. Order the namesake Marjorie, made with elderberry and spiced pear in vodka. A separate speakeasy, Good News, Darling, sits in the back of the space with its own distinctive menu and vibe. — Susan Stapleton, The Des Moines Register\n\nRead a full review of Hello, Marjorie.\n\nNeat Bourbon Bar & Bottle Shop | Louisville, Kentucky\n\nDetails: 1139 Bardstown Road; 502-690-3254, neatbottlebar.com\n\nIn a town known as Bourbon City, bourbon bars abound. Neat, established in 2019, found a niche: Tourists and locals are drawn to this place on a busy Louisville street, where the dark orange and black exterior welcomes you in with signs saying “vintage bourbon.” As its name suggests, this place doesn’t mess around with the good stuff. They might have one of the best old-fashioneds in town. This is a place with an impressive collection and bartenders ready to show it off. — Amanda Hancock, The Courier Journal\n\nRead a full review of Neat Bourbon Bar & Bottle Shop.\n\nIntracoastal Club | Houma, Louisiana\n\nDetails: 8448 E. Main St.; 985-746-5028, intracoastal-club.edan.io\n\nIn the sinking bayou city of Houma, the Intracoastal Club hosts experimental bands from around the world. Hurricane Ida in 2021 left its mark on the bar’s exterior, and repairs still aren't finished. But patrons who step inside won't notice, as they are transported to a psychedelic space of disco balls and paper jellyfish. On the walls, local artists’ works hang alongside old magazine clippings and portraits of Napoleon Bonaparte, Abraham Lincoln, Keith Richards, Blondie, James Brown and Dracula. The drinks are simple, but the shows, ranging from drag and performance artists to bands of all genre, are not. Bands that have performed here include Quintron and Miss Pussycat, Paisley Fields, Louis Michot, Daikaiju, and Jeff \"J.D.\" Pinkus. — Colin Campo, Houma Courier\n\nRead a full review of the Intracoastal Club.\n\nL Street Tavern | Boston, Massachusetts\n\nDetails: 658 E. Eighth St.; 617-752-4947, lsttavernsouthie.com\n\nTwenty-seven years ago, an Irish pub on the corner of L and East Eighth streets in South Boston gained worldwide fame. Scouts chose L Street Tavern for scenes in what would become an Academy Award-winning movie, “Good Will Hunting,” starring Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Minnie Driver. The same high-top table where one of the most hilarious scenes was filmed remains, covered with movie photos and historic Oscar night memorabilia. Tourists from around the world visit, said co-owner Mark Medico. Seven wide-screen televisions line the wood-paneled walls for Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins and Patriots fans to watch games while drinking L Street’s most popular drink: Guinness in a 20-ounce glass. — Joanna K. Tzouvelis, Wicked Local\n\nRead a full review of the L Street Tavern.\n\nParamita Sound | Detroit, Michigan\n\nDetails: 1517 Broadway St.; paramita.xyz\n\nFrom a quaint space in downtown Detroit, Paramita Sound is a place that shines not solely for its bar program or its selection of wines, but for its ability to bring communities together. The Black-owned wine bar and record shop with just eight proper seats gathers guests across generations and cultural backgrounds. Live DJs – both local and national, up-and-coming and acclaimed – pack the space with a lively crowd of imbibers sipping sorrel cocktails or Michigan reds and dancing the Detroit Hustle to just about any track. When the room lined with old records and a photo of Paramita’s humble beginnings out of an old home in the West Village neighborhood fills, the party spills into the streets of Detroit to continue into the wee hours of the night. — Lyndsay C. Green, Detroit Free Press\n\nRead a full review of Paramita Sound.\n\nThe Apothecary at Brent's Drugs | Jackson, Mississippi\n\nDetails: 655 Duling Ave.; 601-366-3427, apothecaryjackson.com\n\nLocated in Jackson's historic Fondren neighborhood, Brent's Drugs is a classic drug store that's been around since 1946 and serves ice cream favorites, milkshakes and diner comfort foods. But that's not the only thing that's special about the drug store. Toward the back is the entrance to a bar called The Apothecary, which occupies the space where the pharmacy storeroom used to be. The Apothecary is one of the most popular bars in Jackson and the place to be for a fun night out with friends or just a quick stop for an after-work drink. The bartenders specialize in classic-inspired cocktails such as the Adult Swim, a Caribbean Negroni with banana rum and coconut Campari. — Kiara Fleming, Clarion Ledger\n\nRead a full review of The Apothecary.\n\nWonder Bar | Asbury Park, New Jersey\n\nDetails: 1213 Ocean Ave.; 732-455-3767, wonderbarasburypark.com\n\nThere are rock 'n' roll stars onstage, and dogs in the courtyard for Yappy Hour, but manager Debbie DeLisa says it's the community that makes the Wonder Bar in Asbury Park so special. DeLisa and Lance Larson have been managing the Ocean Avenue watering hole for nearly 25 years, and they’ve solidified the Wonder Bar's position as a city landmark. When music is not playing, customers sit at the big circular bar, built that way in the '60s so folks can get to know each other across the room. The popular drink is the Debbie D, named after DeLisa. It has Ketel One Botanicals Cucumber and Mint with club soda and fresh muddled mint. “It's really refreshing in the summer,” DeLisa said. One of the regulars is Bruce Springsteen, who has performed several times at the club but mostly he blends in as well as he can. He's a fan of Yappy Hour, where customers bring their dogs to play in the adjacent courtyard. It's unknown whether he's tried a Debbie D. — Chris Jordan, Asbury Park Press\n\nRead a full review of Wonder Bar.\n\nTierney's Tavern | Montclair, New Jersey\n\nDetails: 136 Valley Road; tierneystavern.com\n\nVintage wooden architecture and secret-menu burgers are the name of the game at Montclair’s 90-year-old community center. Locals – from college kids to boomers – have gathered in the classic Irish bar for generations, often accompanied by family (and, sometimes, celebrities). At one point, “The Sopranos” filmed an episode in the nostalgic space, and at another time, William H. Macy and Emma Roberts enjoyed a drink among its twinkling green lights and hanging sports jerseys. The intrigue of the Hollywood elite, despite the tavern’s unassuming digs, comes as no surprise, though, in a place that has established itself as North Jersey’s “Cheers,” but with better food. — Kara VanDooijeweert, The Record and northjersey.com\n\nRead a full review of Tierney's Tavern.\n\nRadio Social | Rochester, New York\n\nDetails: 20 Carlson Road; 585-244-1484, radio-social.com\n\nIn a city that has a strong craft cocktail scene, the most weirdly wonderful place to drink is Radio Social. It’s a 42,000-square-foot mashup of two bars, an upscale Middle Eastern restaurant, a pizza/burger joint and a 34-lane bowling alley. You can play classic games like cornhole and shuffleboard both indoors and on a spacious back lawn. One cocktail bar features flavors that complement the Middle Eastern fare, while the other leans toward playful concoctions served in vessels compatible with swinging a ping pong paddle. You can also get a Genesee Light, the easy drinking local lager. The colorful, retro vibe is a nod to the building’s history of making radios during World War II. It has one of the best brunches in town. — Tracy Schuhmacher, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nRead a full review of Radio Social.\n\nSaints and Scholars | Yonkers, New York\n\nDetails: 790 McLean Ave.; 914-457-5550, instagram.com/saintsandscholars\n\nThere aren't many bars in Westchester County with floral wallpaper, disco balls and chandeliers, including one in the ladies' room. But Saints and Scholars, which opened in 2018, defies expectations. What looks like your typical Irish bar on the outside is full of surprises, starting with a black and white checkered floor, a red and purple backlit bar, a coffered ceiling and a vibrant atmosphere that changes from sedate to sultry as the night goes on. The cocktails are similarly unique (try the Porn Star Martini!) and can be served in a jumbo glass (which easily serves four) or in a miniature bathtub complete with a rubber ducky. Irish-born owner Aidan Loughran, who loves chatting with his customers, has also made elevated food a priority. Cash only. — Jeanne Muchnick, The Journal News\n\nRead a full review of Saints and Scholars.\n\nThe Crow & Quill ∣ Asheville, North Carolina\n\nDetails: 106 N. Lexington Ave.; thecrowandquill.com\n\nVictorian meets gothic at the speakeasy-style bar and local haunt The Crow & Quill. The craft cocktail bar has an air of mystery with a door with no signage; guests must be in the know to know where to go. The eclectic array of antique decor and furniture, dark-wood fixtures and a flag emblazoned with the emblem of a fictitious secret society set the ambiance. Founder Casey Campfield opened the downtown bar in 2014 as a local hangout, and tourists who've stumbled upon its door have made it a favorite, too. The Crow & Quill offers intimate corners, rousing nights of live music with jazzy swing bands, and classic and signature cocktails made from a library of more than 800 whiskeys and 1,000 spirits. ― Tiana Kennell, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nRead a full review of The Crow & Quill.\n\nOcean Grill and Tiki Bar | Carolina Beach, North Carolina\n\nDetails: 1211 S. Lake Park Blvd.; 910-707-0049, oceangrilltiki.com\n\nOcean views, salt air and tiki drinks? Yes, this spot has the laid-back, surf-inspired vibe you want in a beach bar. The restaurant side at the Golden Sands Motel has an upstairs dining room with panoramic views. But a mini vacation is a few steps away on the remnants of Center Pier, damaged by a hurricane in 1996. When it’s time for tiki business, bartenders open the hut’s plywood flaps to serve cold beer and cocktails such as a mojito, Dark ‘n’ Stormy or the house-favorite Noserider. And the staff will even bring you fish tacos or a sandwich from the restaurant. In the summer, the magical tiki shows bring both touring artists and local bands to the rock out on the end of the pier. — Allison Ballard, Wilmington StarNews\n\nRead a full review of Ocean Grill and Tiki Bar.\n\nLaw Bird | Columbus, Ohio\n\nDetails: 740 S. High St.; 614-636-1053, lawbirdbar.com\n\nEven as Law Bird introduces cocktails with pickled-carrot brine or seaweed-infused mezcal, curates Wednesday night hot dogs with the same finesse as its mixology and turns into a tiki bar in the middle of December, one thing stays constant. There’s a pink neon sign that says, “Not Governed by Reason.” Law Bird, a cocktail bar just outside downtown Columbus, remakes itself regularly through changes in drink menus, bar snacks and decor. In the past year alone, it has gone through five evolutions that include 1990s vintage, Japanese city pop and galactic disco. Customer favorites reappear, and classics such as $5 mini-martinis endure. It’s a small, never-crowded space that takes reservations but leaves half its seating open for walk-ins. — Bob Vitale, The Columbus Dispatch\n\nRead a full review of Law Bird.\n\nLongfellow | Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nDetails: 1233 Clay St.; 513-307-4379, longfellowbar.com\n\nOrder a classic cocktail, an amaro or a pilsner at Longfellow, and it won’t take long to realize why this place is special. Your epiphany might come as your mind goes deep into an old song by Ralph Stanley or New Order playing on the well-curated playlist, when you strike up a conversation with a stranger (it’s rare to come here without making a new friend) or when you look outside the bar’s double-hung windows and fall in love with the Italianate townhomes and cathedrals that surround you. As the night wears on, the bar becomes a beacon for restaurant workers finishing up their shifts and looking for a shot and a beer, or couples out for a nightcap after dinner. You can eat here, too. A rotating menu features modern takes on old-school bar snacks, including radishes with salt and butter, German-style meat platters and tomato soup. All of them are wonderful. — Keith Pandolfi, The Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nRead a full review of Longfellow.\n\nEdna's | Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\nDetails: 5137 Classen Circle; 405-840-3339, ednasokc.com\n\nFor 35 years, patrons have adorned the walls and ceilings of Edna's with dollar bills. At this point, there are few spots remaining without colorfully decorated bills stapled to them. But when namesake Edna Scott opened her bar in 1989, there was no indication it would become so beloved or the origin point of a cocktail combining Coors Light, orange juice and amaretto – The Lunchbox – that many have tried to mimic. The bar was once the location of a Keith Urban music video, and Jimmy Fallon and Questlove were even served Lunchboxes by an Oklahoma chef on “The Tonight Show.” Still owned by Scott's family, offering up a tasty bar menu and having served more than 2 million Lunchboxes, Edna's remains a cornerstone of Oklahoma City's bar scene. — JaNae Williams, The Oklahoman\n\nRead a full review of Edna's.\n\nHey Love | Portland, Oregon\n\nDetails: 920 E. Burnside St.; 503-206-6223, heylovepdx.com\n\nIn a city of perpetual rain, Hey Love is Portland's sunny escape. Fenced in by tropical plants creating a cabana-like ambiance, the bar inside the Jupiter Hotel encapsulates the city's eclectic spirit. A funky, fresh playlist enlivens the space. The team of owners brings decades of experience in the industry and has crafted an experience that all can enjoy, including an ADA-accommodating bar top. There are food options for most dietary restrictions for happy hour, dinner and weekend brunch, plus an almost unending list of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The bar continuously participates in fundraisers and causes, making it the community's bar. — Em Chan, Salem Statesman Journal\n\nRead a full review of Hey Love.\n\nBloomsday Cafe | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nDetails: 414 S. Second St.; 267-319-8018, bloomsdaycafe.com\n\nOn a cobblestone street lined with old trees, this charming pub dresses like the hottest wine bar in town, but the staff will remember your name, your seating preference and your drink. Bloomsday has a long list of natural wines, ciders, orange wines and bubbly from the United States and abroad. If you’re not an oenophile, bartenders will be happy to offer their favorite vermouth from the marble and crystal bar, or make you the Bloomsday Citywide cocktail, a fun spin on the Philly classic that combines a different beer and vermouth each month. Wine clubs, book clubs, tea parties and a menu of brunch classics keep this wine pub filled with locals year-round. — Annemarie Dooling, USA TODAY\n\nRead a full review of Bloomsday.\n\nPreservation Pub | Knoxville, Tennessee\n\nDetails: 28 Market Square; 865-524-2224, scruffycity.com/preservation-pub\n\nThere are two kinds of “Pubby Buddies.” There’s the signature $5 menu item at Preservation Pub – a shot of whiskey and a PBR – and then there are the friends you make while dancing to jam band music in the smoke-filled first floor and while sharing drinks from the rooftop “shot shack” trailer (or the magic beer tree). Owner Scott West, whose career is back on track after a money laundering conviction, considers the divey Preservation Pub and its nightly live music to be the “heart of the heart” – that is, the pulse that makes Knoxville’s Market Square pedestrian plaza come alive as one of the most-visited parts of the Scruffy City. — Ryan Wilusz, Knox News\n\nRead a full review of Preservation Pub.\n\nThe Lipstick Lounge | Nashville, Tennessee\n\nDetails: 1400 Woodland St.; 615-226-6343, thelipsticklounge.com\n\nLipstick Lounge is an icon of once-gritty East Nashville. Now pricey homes surround it. But the bar, which opened in 2002, serves as a reminder of when the neighborhood was less polished. When it was a haven for artists and musicians who hadn't yet struck it big. When it was proudly home to a come-as-you-are attitude. Lipstick Lounge is still that. It's a colorful, raucous good time, with thumping music and costumes everywhere, even on a Sunday afternoon. Customers come for a huge menu of hangover drinks like the peach schnapps-based Flying Phyllis Diller, an ode to the queen of one-liners whose gay fan base is immense. Yes, Lipstick Lounge is a gay bar, but foremost it's \"a bar for humans,\" its owners are fond of saying. It's a bar for anyone who likes to have fun in a welcoming but wild atmosphere. — Mackensy Lunsford, The Tennessean\n\nRead a full review of The Lipstick Lounge.\n\nSahara Lounge | Austin, Texas\n\nDetails: 1413 Webberville Road; 512-927-0700, saharalounge.com\n\nSahara Lounge sits at the eastern edge of Austin and at the heart of a community that still represents Austin at its best: funky, soulful, eclectic and diverse. The ramshackle bar owned by musicians Eileen Bristol and her son, Topaz McGarrigle, sometimes feels like it might fall down when regular Africa Night or Body Rock ATX parties pump at full throttle. Bartenders quench the thirst of clubgoers with cold Sahara Slants, the house’s namesake cocktail made with the Ghanaian spirit akpeteshie. Looking for a beer without the bass drop? Before the show, you can soak in the space’s musical history, documented with old concert posters, or head to a table out back, where the conversation flows like the Quan Yin fountain honoring the Bodhisattva of Compassion. — Matthew Odam, Austin American-Statesman\n\nRead a full review of Sahara Lounge.\n\nBryant's Cocktail Lounge | Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nDetails: 1579 S. Ninth St.; 414-383-2620, bryantscocktaillounge.com\n\nAt Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, owner John Dye is most proud when customers liken his bar to a museum. It first opened in 1937 and serves drinks from every decade it has been open: Depression-era cocktails like rail splitters and sidecars, hurricanes made popular during World War II and colorful cosmopolitans popular in the 1990s. The bar’s bestsellers are ice cream drinks like pink squirrels (rumored to have been invented at Bryant’s) and grasshoppers, along with the Wisconsin old-fashioned. The bar’s interior was well preserved until a fire destroyed it in 1971. The owner at that time rebuilt it as a dimly lit, vintage 1950s cocktail lounge sparing no expense, according to Dye. The lounge has been preserved since, giving Bryant’s its historic charm today. — Jordyn Noennig, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"
