        "text": "It’s touted as the “World’s Largest Honky Tonk,” and with over 100,000 square feet of entertainment space – including an indoor rodeo and concert venue – Billy Bob’s Texas certainly lives up to its claim. Tourists come to experience some friendly Fort Worth hospitality, live music, and some boot-scootin’ fun, but locals love it for its top-name concerts and lively nightlife! Here’s why you’ll want to visit:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBilly Bob’s Texas isn’t just known for being the World’s Largest Honky Tonk, either. The nightclub celebrates other claims of notoriety as well, such as this fun fact: Merle Haggard made the Guinness Book of World Records for buying the largest round of drinks when he purchased 5,095 shots for the entire crowd at the club one night. The bill totaled $12,737.50 and equaled 40 gallons of whiskey!\n\nYou can find this legendary bar in the historic stockyards at 2520 Rodeo Plaza in Fort Worth. Have you ever visited Billy Bob’s Texas, and if so, what was your favorite memory? Did you attend for a concert or show off your skills on the dance floor? We’d love to hear about your experience.\n\nBe sure to check out their concert schedule in order to plan your next visit!"
