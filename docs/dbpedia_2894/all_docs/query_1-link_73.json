        "text": "Ged Jenkins-Omar, 31, has achieved a lifelong ambition of becoming a Guinness World Record holder as the proud owner of the World’s Smallest Mobile Nightclub.\n\nMr Jenkins-Omar, who lived in Bury and Radcliffe before moving to Ibiza, and club partner Stephen Robson were officially awarded their record on Friday, February 3 for their “Club 28”.\n\nHe said: “It’s amazing to get a world record and definitely a tick off the bucket list. My mum has bought me a Guinness Book of Records every year since I was kid and still does now even though I am 31 so I suppose I have to thank her for the inspiration.”\n\nThe club measures 2.01m (6 ft 6in) high, 0.92m, (3 ft) wide and 1.53m (5 ft) deep and holds a whopping six punters and one DJ. In order to get the record the club had to have a name, a sound system, lighting, dancefloor, turntables operated by a DJ, a bouncer and charge entry. Ravers were charged 50p on the day.\n\nMr Jenkins-Omar said: “It’s a bit of fun and brings a smile to the faces of the people who see it and dance in it. A few festivals have started getting in contact to enquire about booking it so it looks like we are going on tour.\n\n“Taking a revamped musical shed on tour — something everybody wants to grow up and do.”\n\nClub 28 is booked at Another Fine Fest in the Lake District and Open Up Sheffield."
