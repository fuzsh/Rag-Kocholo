        "text": "Good morning team,\n\nI'm loving my mornings at the moment, currently I'm on two per day. I have to say how much I am enjoying my sleeping bag (the crew will attest to this). It has been another cold night, and it is the only place where I am sure to warm up.\n\nThe low-pressure to the north has moved east and the sea has become more regular. We sailed all night with the Yankee 1 and changed to Code 3 (Heavyweight Spinnaker) at first light. The area between the low-pressure passed and the one due soon has left a ridge of high and not much wind. Unfortunately we are upwind in light winds now and the current weather forecast suggests boats further south may do better.\n\nThis morning we spotted a tear in the Code 3 Spinnaker with an older patch coming away, so the sail repair team (Mary Frawely) had a new patch made and is trying to squeeze it through the sewing machine.\n\nDuring the night, Peter Nemcek was enjoying the darkness and the glowing of the plankton in the water as we rushed past and as the odd wave arrived onto the deck. I have spent a bit of time next to Leg 6 crew Martin Storer, Chris MaGovern and Ray Kinsella of late and they have been enjoying the sense of speed at the helm.\n\nFood remains very good as always and a particular mention to Dr G – John Gannon and GG – Greg Glover for their coconut milk based beef curry yesterday night.\n\nThat’s all folks,\n\n3062 miles to Seattle,\n\nConall"
