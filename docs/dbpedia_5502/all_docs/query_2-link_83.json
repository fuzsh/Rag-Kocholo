Squat Tony Musto, who fights out of a crouch so low that his nose comes close to making tracks in the resin, lasted up to 1 minute and 86 seconds of the ninth round before the Bomber stopped him and chalked him up as the 16th unsuccessful challenger to the world heavyweight championship. Not only that, but the chunky Chicago challenger was not On the floor at the finish. As a jampacked crowd at the arena cheered Musto on for his gallant stand de was still on his feet, absorbing punishment, when Referee Don imported from New York -stepped in and halted the contest to save Tony turther punishment .\n\nAlthough he never had a to Jolt the crown from its secure pot on Louis' kinky locks, Musto was floored only once. A short left hook caught him off balance in the third and sat him down. He was up at a count of one. As the first heavyweight title tussle in St. Louis, the gate broke all records for local fisticuffing, $52,993, compared to the previous high as $48,000 set by Primo Carnera and Chuck Wiggins 11 years ago .\n\nCrowd Short The crowd, however, fell short of the 18,130 of that occasion. Tinight there were 17,456 paid customers on hand to see Louis make Rig first appearance here since his days as a junior amateur. At the end, Tony was a wellnorn warrior. His nose was dripping blood from the third round on, and his right eye was just 9 red faucet on his face. His blood smeared both of them at the and of each of the last four rounds .\n\nAs it has been on a few ocvaaions in the past, the crouch again bothered Joe. He was throw'ng punches all the time, but he rarely was able to open his man up and measure him for the \"Sunday with a crouch was QUALITY SERVICE CHANGE NOW To summer oils and creases. know how to serve Ice sour car for' summer-long Grizzly isfaction.

In the fifth and sixth rounds several of these landed and Louis didn't like it a little bit. Not Impressive If anything, Louis looked less impressive tonight, in this fifth slop on his fight-a-month campaign, than three weeks ago when ample Abraham Simon went 13 rounds with him in Detroit. And, with the tough summer assignments still ahead, there wasn't too much cheer about for the Bomber. He still has his return date with Sinion in May, probably will face the Pittsburgher, Billy Conn, in June, end it he's still on top, there's some sort of a July outing in the wind and a September trip to the post with Lou Nova .\n\nDon't get the idea that Musto wasn't given a going over by those hatchets hanging at the end Joe's arms, He was. Louis chopped him with swings and scored almost at will with his left jabs. But Tony stood up under everything. Afterward, in his dressing room, Tony, one arm around his wife, pooh-poohed Joe's famous punchding power. \"He doesn't hit any harder'n a lot of other guys I fought,\" he shouted .\n\nLouis explained he wasn't doing much punching with his right hand because of a swollen ring finger, an injury he suffered in the Simon fight. Among other advantages, Joe had a big edge in size over the short, stumpy slugger, although there was less than four pounds difference in weight. Louis scaled 203 Musto The Sports Trail By WHITNEY MARTIN New Tork, April Special News Service)-Lou Nora's vague description of his new cosmic punch brings tolerant snickers, as to the average citizen a sock on the jaw by any other name is still a sock on the jaw, but Max Baer unknowingly that maybe this fancy-handled Lou's wallop isn't entirely At a least, product Max of imagination. is pretty sure he wasn't just hit by a theory. \"I can't understand it,\" Max said after being floored twice by Nova with punches that didn't seem to carry that much steam .\n\n\"I can take a better belt on the chin than those.\" Seated on a rubbing table in his fused, pathetic figure.

And forever bobbing up, as it he were convincing himself, was the subject of quitting. Everything has been said or written about Max, but only one thing has stung. That is the charge he is a quitter. \"I didn't quit .\n\nYou understand that, don't you? he challenged, although nobody had mentioned that subject. \"All I know is that bingo! I hit the floor, and do you know what flashed through my mind? It was 'Baer, it you don't get up you're \"I guess he hit me on the right spot, Say, that's a funny thing.

That's a strong statement on the part of the 71-year-old president of the Boston Bees. Bob Quinn has seen them all. The Browns have had some fair to middling clubs, if you can remember back far enough .\n\nThere were the Browns largely of Quinn's own making, for example--George Harold Sisler and Johnny Allen Elden Auker that bunch whom the Yankees! beat for the pennont by a single game in 1922. It is sufficient to say that in two seasons under Fred Haney the Browns have shaken the defeatist complex. The Browns broke even with Cleveland in 22 engagements last trip. Elden Auker and Vernon Kennedy dealt the Indians a terrific blow by beating them in a double header on the lake front in September. The Browns knocked the last spark out of the Yankees at Sportsman's Park .\n\nThey were first to put the Red Sox on the skids. They dropped the White Sox into a fourth-place tie with the Bostons belted them out of important money in their finall series.

Photographers jumped into the ring and Baer raced between a battery of cameras a8 the bell rang for the seventh. Lafond declared Baer the winner when Tony's handlers insisted on removthe glove. A boxing commission physician examined Galento's hand but declined to comment. Tony left the ring amid a chorus of boos and was taken to hospital for X-rays to determine if his hand was broken .\n\nDr. Marvin McLean, the commission's physician, accompanied him. About 8,500 fans paid around $25,000 to see the bout. Galento, his face swollen and his nose bleeding profusely, looked like a thoroughly beaten fighter as he sat puffing in his corner during the of excitement that preceded announcement of the verdict. Tony started fast and backed Baer into the ropes with a pair of hard rights in the first round, which he took by a good margin .\n\nIn the second, which was ruled even because both fighters landed low blows, Buddy had the advantage by clubbing Galento's body as Tony continued to bore in.
