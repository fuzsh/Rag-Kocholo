He has admitted telling two potential donors that he could use his position as state treasurer to harm their business if they didn't contribute to his campaign for governor.\n\nMusto was under federal indictment on charges he took $25,000 from the contractor in the Luzerne County Kids for Cash judicial scandal. At age 85, Musto was found to be mentally incompetent to stand trial and sent to federal medical prison. Facing terminal cancer, he was released for health reasons and died shortly thereafter. Mitigating factor: After replacing the legendary Dan Flood in Congress in 1980, Musto was offered a bribe in the Abscam sting but flatly refused it.\n\nIn the undercard, notorious senatorial birthday-bash hostess LeAnna Washington goes against Bob Mellow, a fellow state senator who pleaded guilty to a federal charge arising from misuse of his state-paid staff for election campaign work. He got a prison sentence of 16 months, part of which was served in a halfway house.\n\nMellow (D-Lackawanna) was also charged in the recent Pennsylvania Turnpike pay-to-play scandal but a judge dismissed most of the charges and prosecutors dropped the remaining case against him.\n\nWashington (D-Philadelphia) resigned the Senate late last year after pleading guilty to using her legislative staff to help stage her gigantic annual campaign fundraising birthday party bash. She was sentenced to home confinement and ordered to pay $200,000 restitution. Her plea deal allowed her to keep her state pension.\n\nSo who deserves to stay in the running for Pa.'s Kingpin of Corruption, and who should be turned aside as a minor-league wrongdoer? Vote in our two polls below."
