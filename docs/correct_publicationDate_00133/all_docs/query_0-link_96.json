There was like ten of his books all in a row, I started rereading Pushing Ice (because I like causing myself pain, obviously), and I almost, almost, almost checked another book out.\n\nFortunately I couldn't, because I tried and the machine told me that \"Your card will expire before the loan date, please talk to a librarian\" and I didn't have sufficient ID to renew mine.\n\nPushing Ice made me absolutely despair because it is basically about exile. Involuntary, irreversible, complete cut off. Their ship is an ice-miner ordered to follow the suspicious activity of a gas giant's moon. Once out of the solar system, the \"moon\" begins to accelerate and attains a speed a significant fraction of the speed of light. They get caught up in the \"slipstream\" without realizing--they are deceived by their parent company--and Bella, the commander, makes the call that her duty is \"not to get the crew home\" but to keep them alive, the chances being too low to go back.\n\nYeah. And The Prefect was aggravatingly lacking any sort of character arc completion. I actually cared about Dreyfus; I didn't care about the super-sentient-intelligent-thing those two fighting robots were! Maybe it'd have been more interesting to people coming from the previous series, set in the future, though.\n\nOK, I'm done ripping on Reynolds. But still, the science fiction part is very attractive. I keep getting sucked back in, and I refuse to read books that don't have some kind of decent characterization.\n\nI had something else I wanted to talk about but now I have forgotten.\n\n--\n\nThor 2 trailer is out.\n\nTHAT SLAP. That landscape. Oh my god, I can't wait.\n\nCrosspost: http://silverflight8.dreamwidth.org/135881.html."
