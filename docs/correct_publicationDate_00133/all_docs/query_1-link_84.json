        "text": "Pushing Ice, by Alastair Reynolds (Gollancz, £14.99)\n\nHard SF doesn't come much harder than Alastair Reynolds. At the start of Pushing Ice, the author admits that some of the science is real and some fudged, but so confident is his handling that it is almost impossible to work out which is which. Flicking back from a coherent far-future in which failing suns can be rebooted and whole planets shifted on a whim, Pushing Ice explains how civilisation got so advanced by outlining the history of the Rockhopper, a mining ship designed to grab comets and send them Earthwards for capture and processing. Bella is the captain; her best friend Svetlana goes out with Parry, who heads up a mining team. The quarters on the Rockhopper are cramped and the space-suits outdated, but it's a job and DeepShaft, their employer, is no worse than any other mining company. Such is life until one of Saturn's moons uncloaks to reveal itself as an alien spaceship and the Rockhopper is sent to investigate. Suddenly some very ordinary people find themselves representing Earth in a very strange alien encounter. Classic Reynolds.\n\nJudas Unchained, by Peter F Hamilton (Macmillan, £18.99)\n\nIn Pandora's Star, Hamilton introduced us to Ozzie and Nigel, a couple of geeks whose practical application of wormhole-based space travel made them very rich indeed - as well as the heads of galaxy-spanning dynasties, courtesy of rejuvenation techniques and good forward planning. However, all was not perfect. A plan to unwrap a star from its Dyson Sphere resulted in a terrifying war with a hive mind called MorningLightMountain, while not everyone proved happy to live on planets owned by increasingly arrogant and feudal families (space opera's default political system). In Judas Unchained, evil alien the Starflyer continues to manipulate human politics while being pursued by Chief Investigator Paula Myo, a woman given to making enemies the way other people make cups of tea. Ex-geek Nigel has trouble running the Commonwealth, and Ozzie works on being the cosmic surfer dude he always was. If Pandora's Star represented a return to form, Judas Unchained - which wraps up the storyline - is even better.\n\nLooking for Jake, by China Miéville (Macmillan, £17.99)\n\nStreets move about, squatting where they don't belong; the play area of an Ikea-like store begins to traumatise the children it is meant to amuse; the Underground system is haunted by ghosts from an unknown war . . . China Miéville's London is a city beyond the edge of most people's vision. His writing is hard to pigeonhole: the urban hip of King Rat gave way to the gothic Victoriana of Perdido Street Station and the weirdly Hornbloweresque The Scar, while Iron Council (which won this year's Clarke award) divided fans. The stories in Looking for Jake go a long way towards explaining why Miéville is so hard to pin down, showcasing his obsession with city life and his control of language. Many feel it's time for him to move on: some of these more recent stories show that it's already happening.\n\nFlight of the Night Hawks, by Raymond E Feist (Voyager, £18.99)\n\nTad and Zane are friends, given to brawling and drinking and chasing the same girl. Both their fathers are dead and the Widow Marie (mother/foster mother respectively) is just about getting by in one of those towns often found in epic fantasy, where times is hard but folk are kindly. Marie is friends with the mysterious Caleb, who claims to be a trader; this being a Raymond Feist novel, Caleb is actually the son of a powerful sorcerer and quickly becomes a surrogate father to the boys, who embark on a crash course in fighting evil. This novel kicks off a new series, set in the same world as Feist's earlier books. Fans will adore it. Others will wonder what the fuss is about."
