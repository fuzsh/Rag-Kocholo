        "text": "The cube arrived at the structure long before Janus and the Rockhopper did. It then simply sat there for a few ten/hundred million years, waiting for Bella's arrival and its discovery. To help illustrate this, look at the timeline:\n\nAs you can see, the cubes were launched during the era of the Lindblad ring and had ample time for one of them to make its way to the structure. As Alastair Reynolds explains in a comment on his blog:\n\nRockhopper was kept in a holding pattern (orbiting the galaxy, or something), so lots of time elapsed even without travelling megaparsecs in a straight line. The idea is that all the different species would have arrived at the Structure at around the same time, give or take a few 1000s of years. Enough cubes were thrown out such that one or more were bound to end up at the Structure.\n\nTo further elaborate, a quote from the book:\n\nWe made vast numbers of cubes. Short of being dropped into a star, there isnâ€™t much that can harm them. We were thinking long term, extreme deep time. [..] We scattered them to the four winds. Dispersed them throughout the galaxy via automated probes. Dropped them into orbit around a hundred million dead worlds. Cast them into intergalactic space, on trajectories that would eventually bring them into the gravitational influence of every major galaxy, satellite galaxy or globular cluster in the local group. We launched some of them far beyond the local group, towards the great galactic superclusters, halfway to the edge of the visible universe. They'll take a while to get there, of course. We even fired some of them into naked black holes, in the hope that their information would be encoded and released in the immeasurably distant future, when the black holes surrender their parcels of entropy back to the universe. We continued making them for four thousand years. Of course, we never really expected success - it was just a gesture, the decent thing to do.\n\nIn the first chapter, Chromis also explains: \"We'll make them by the billions and cast them to the four winds.\"\n\nFurthermore, the cubes had all the technology of 18'000 years of (accelerated) human development, which was capable of acts such as \"the frame-shifting of an entire world from one system to another\". Each cube also had the full memories of Chromis and knew what to look for, so once a cube approached Janus it would have no problems identifying it. The frame-shifting and reeve technologies demonstrated towards the final chapters hint at the fact that the technology of the cube could be sufficient to bypass the Spican structure's barriers, or perhaps the cube found Janus before it reached the structure and simply followed it around during the time the Iron Sky was in place."
