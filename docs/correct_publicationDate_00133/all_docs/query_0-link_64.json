        "text": "Just curious if anyone here has read this. I didnt see it mentioned too much on here.\n\nI was at the book store earlier today and was looking at this. Its sounded so interesting I bought it. I probably wont get to read it for a while since Im literally reading 3 books right now, but what is everyones thoughts if youve read it? It sounds really good.\n\nI read it last year and liked it a lot. A solid first contact novel.\n\nHere's what I said in the First Contact thread:\n\nPushing Ice was terrific and one of the best SF novels I've read thus far in 2009. Svetlana was a real biatch, man. Holy crow did she hold a grudge. The pacing was great and a lot of times, if I find myself taking a bit longer to read a book, I get a little frustrated. Not so here, because the scale of time and scope of what these people underwent and encountered was handled extremely well. Reynolds's characterization and aliens were top notch, too. I wound up tearing through the last 180 pages or so last night.\n\nI'd also suggested checking out the Alastair Reynolds thread where the book comes up frequently.\n\nI liked it alot too.\n\nBut I do remember the first 100 pages being a little slow. All that changes when they 'get going'. So dont give up on it in the beginning.\n\nBut I think his best book of all is 'Century Rain' - it's quite bleak, but very, very good...\n\nYeah, I was looking at that one as well. I put it on my wishlist.\n\nSpeaking of Revelation Space, are all the books in that series a \"must read\", or can they be read separately? I have a big interest in reading THE PERFECT, but Ive only read RS...\n\nLoved it, definitely a better Reynolds to start with then Revelation Space, though I liked that too. Much more accessible.\n\nAgreed! I read \"Pushing Ice\" as my first Reynolds book and loved it. I have read the first two in the Revelation Space triology but not the third. For some reason I have had trouble getting excited about the third.\n\nYeah, I was looking at that one as well. I put it on my wishlist.\n\nSpeaking of Revelation Space, are all the books in that series a \"must read\", or can they be read separately? I have a big interest in reading THE PERFECT, but Ive only read RS...\n\nThe Prefect and Chasm City have some crossover, especially Chasm City, but they don't follow the same plot line. I read the first three RS books first and I really liked Reynolds, but it wasn't until I read Chasm City that I went out and looked for everything Reynolds has ever written.\n\nThis may be helpful.\n\nI usually recommend starting with Chasm City before reading the trilogy, and then reading Galactic North afterwards (Galactic North is important, as it completes the story arc in the trilogy). I'd hold off on The Prefect and Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days until later, as they do have some minor spoilers for the trilogy.\n\nSo...ok, Would it be ok if I read CHASM CITY next? All Ive read is RS. Ive had Chasm City on my too read pile for a while now, and because of all the praise it gets, I have more interest in reading it first than his other stuff.\n\nSo...ok, Would it be ok if I read CHASM CITY next? All Ive read is RS. Ive had Chasm City on my too read pile for a while now, and because of all the praise it gets, I have more interest in reading it first than his other stuff.\n\nI don't think it will be an issue. There might be some background on characters that you might miss but those characters aren't main characters in either series anyways. And when you get to them in Absolution Gap then you will already have the background from Chasm City. Absolution Gap and Redemption continue the story arc from Revelation Space while Chasm City is more like a spinoff/prequel."
