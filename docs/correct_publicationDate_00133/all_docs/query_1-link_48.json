        "text": "In Pushing Ice, one of Saturn’s moons suddenly departs from its orbit and shoots off into deep space. The only nearby ship chases the errant moon and watches as huge chunks of ice fall off its surface to reveal a gigantic machine underneath.\n\nNot everyone on the ship wants to keep chasing this object. The object seems to have some ideas about that, too.\n\nPushing Ice is a great book, and I lost some sleep because I couldn’t put it down. Even though we follow the same characters throughout the book, so much happens that it has the feel of a big, sprawling, multi-generational epic.\n\nThe science is hard, the humans flawed, and the surprises keep coming."
