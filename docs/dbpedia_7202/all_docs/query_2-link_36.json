        "text": "b.1945 - 2019\n\nJane was a native of Lawton, Oklahoma, where several of her ancestors settled before statehood. Her husband’s military career enabled them to live and visit many places in the US and overseas. Moving every few years across country, overseas, and back with children born along the way, contributed to an exciting and challenging life.\n\nJane particularly enjoyed their tour in Turkey, which gave her the opportunity to view the classical sculpture of ancient Greece and increased her interest in this art form. Although she had dabbled in art most of her life and always appreciated three-dimensional form, this experience solidified what became her raison d’état.\n\nThe last fifteen years, Jane and her family lived in Colorado and considered Monument, a small town north of Colorado Springs, home. After settling there, Jane practiced her art, studying with several excellent sculptors at the Fechin Institute in Taos, New Mexico, the Scottsdale Artist School in Scottsdale, Arizona and the Loveland Academy of Fine Art in Loveland, Colorado.\n\nJane wanted to create sculpture with which people could identify, to provide a catalyst for reflections and pleasant memories. She believed that we need beauty in our lives for emotional and social well-being. Her goal was to create art that has beauty and integrity in the craftsmanship and design.\n\nAt the end of her life, children were her preferred subjects. She had been a schoolteacher; had worked with children in volunteer activities; and had children and grandchildren of her own; it was normal that she felt a connection with them. Years of observation had enabled her work to capture some of the naturalness and spontaneity of childhood.\n\nColorado Springs, CO – Broadmoor Galleries is excited to announce ” Moore Art: A Family Affair,” a special exhibition featuring the works of American impressionist painter Robert Moore and his two children, Anna, and Robbie Moore. The exhibition will open on May, 18, 2023, and run through June 8th, 2023, at Broadmoor Galleries located at The Broadmoor, 1 Lake Avenue, Colorado Springs, CO 80906.\n\nWHAT: Moore Art: A Family Affair\n\nWHO: Featuring:\n\nRobert Moore, Anna Moore, and Robbie Moore\n\nWHEN: Thursday, May 18th, from 4-8PM\n\nWHERE: Broadmoor Galleries at the Broadmoor Hotel\n\n1 Lake Circle\n\nColorado Springs CO 80906\n\n(719)577-5744\n\nhttps://broadmoorgalleries.com/events/\n\nBroadmoor Galleries in Colorado Springs is proud to present “Moore Art: A Family Affair,” an exhibition that showcases the unique artistic styles of American impressionist artist Robert Moore, and his two children, Anna, and Robbie Moore. Robert, who is colorblind and paints with both hands simultaneously, has established himself as a prominent figure in the art world, and his children have followed in his footsteps.\n\nRobert Moore, a celebrated American painter who is colorblind and paints with both hands simultaneously, is known for his signature landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits. The exhibition will showcase a range of Moore’s works alongside those of his talented children.\n\n“Moore Art: A Family Affair” is a unique opportunity to experience the work of three incredibly talented artists from the same family,” said Broadmoor Galleries director, Jamie Oberloh. “Robert Moore’s impressionistic style is a true representation of the beauty and diversity of America, and his children Anna and Robbie are following in his footsteps with their own unique styles and techniques.”\n\nRobert Moore’s artistic achievements are all the more remarkable given that he is colorblind. Despite this, he has become known for his ability to create vivid and striking color palettes in his paintings. He has also developed a unique technique of painting with both hands simultaneously, which allows him to create intricate details and textures in his works.\n\nMoore’s use of both hands to paint has been compared to the way a pianist uses both hands to play a complex piece of music. This technique requires a great deal of focus and coordination, and it has become one of Moore’s signature methods.\n\nMoore’s colorblindness has also influenced his work in other ways. He has said that he is drawn to painting landscapes because he is able to see the world in shades of green, which he can differentiate more easily than other colors. This has led him to develop a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature and the environment.\n\nDespite his colorblindness and unique painting technique, Robert Moore has become one of America’s most beloved impressionist painters. His works continue to inspire and captivate viewers, and his contributions to American art are truly remarkable.\n\nAnna Moore, a professional artist in her own right, draws inspiration from her father’s work and her surroundings, using her skillful brushstrokes to capture the essence of nature in her landscapes. She works in a variety of media, including oil painting, watercolor, and printmaking. Her work is inspired by the natural beauty of the American West and the people and places that inhabit it.\n\nRobbie Moore, who recently graduated with a Finance degree from the University of Arkansas, has always had a passion for art and the natural world. He has developed his skills in drawing, gouache, watercolor, and oil painting, and his work has been featured in a company calendar commissioned by his employer. With his father’s legacy of developing artists and a lineage of artists in his family, Robbie’s future aspiration is to make the most out of his upbringing and create a name for himself in the art world.\n\n“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to showcase the work of three incredibly talented artists,” said Broadmoor Galleries’ director, Jamie Oberloh. “The combination of Robert’s impressionistic paintings with Anna and Robbie’s unique styles and mediums creates a truly exceptional exhibition that will delight and inspire our visitors. Their paintings are a true representation of the beauty and diversity of America, and we are honored to share the work with our community.”\n\nThe exhibition will be open to the public from May 18th, 2023, through June 8th, 2023, and will feature a special reception on May 18th, 2023, from 4-8 pm, where visitors can meet the artists and enjoy light refreshments. All works in the exhibition will be available for sale."
