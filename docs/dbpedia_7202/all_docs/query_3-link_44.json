        "text": "Native Americans have been handcrafting jewelry since they first drew inspiration from their natural surroundings and transformed shell and stone into wearable jewelry. Some of the oldest discovered pieces date from over 10,000 years ago. The skilled artisans at Alltribes continue the age-old tradition and create captivating works of art that will surpass your expectations!\n\nAlltribes is one of the rare jewelry stores that has a workshop employing Native American artists creating extraordinary pieces of jewelry on site. While most of our silversmiths are Navajo, we employ artists from a wide variety of backgrounds. Some work from home, on the reservation, and some work here in our shop. Alltribes Native American Art and Jewelry blends ancient history, natural beauty, and unparalleled expertise flawlessly. We are conveniently located near Scottsdale, Mesa and Phoenix, AZ in the historic town of Gilbert. Unfortunately, due to Covid and other factors, we are unable to take walk in customers at this time.

This unique and exceedingly rare turquoise is renowned for its hardness, durability, and gorgeous color. Our artisans preserve the natural beauty of this precious stone, so you can admire its elegance for years to come. A hand buffed polish protects the stones and heightens its natural beauty.\n\nOur Tradition\n\nIn addition to Native American jewelry, Alltribes upholds the ancient traditions of Native Americans by offering more than remarkable jewelry.
