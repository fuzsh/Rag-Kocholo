        "text": "b.1948\n\nDeborah Copenhaver was born and raised on a cattle and quarter horse ranch in northern Idaho. Her father, a World Champion Bronc Rider, supported the family with his winnings. She and her younger brother Jeff grew up on the ranch often alone with their mother. Work on the ranch was shared by all and a life long passion for horses grew from those responsibilities. Competition was a way of life for the Copenhaver family. Deborah won barrel races before she was a teenager and was a member of the Girls Rodeo Association. Her brother Jeff roped calves and won calf roping competitions at an equally young age. It was at this time that Deborah sold her first drawings of horses.\n\nDeborah spent her first year of college at Washington State University where she earned a full scholarship. That same year Deborah won the competition to become Miss Rodeo Washington and was Runner Up Miss Rodeo America. Her second year of college she transferred to Fort Wright College of the Holy Names in Spokane, Washington. There she met a nun, Sister Paula Mary Turnbull, who taught sculpture. At 19 she sculpted her first commissioned bronze for the city of Spokane, “James Glover.” Deborah received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree following study in Italy where her passion for sculpture came alive and now continues today.\n\nShe successfully owned and operated her own business Classic Interiors; this was an experience that honed her business skills. Yet, despite her success in the business world, the horses called. She and her brother loaded their horses and left Washington to compete in the winter rodeo circuit. By the second go-round of Houston and no winnings, Deborah loaded both horses and headed for Phoenix with just enough money to get to a friend’s ranch in Chandler. During this stay, she went to Prescott and met Ernie Phippen who ran a western art foundry. Her world came together. She went back home, gathered all of her belongings, and returned to Prescott to get a job as a head wrangler in a dude ranch. That year she cast her first bronze and started her art career.\n\nWithin four years, Deborah was commissioned by Gonzaga University to sculpt a monument of Bing Crosby. The project took her to Queen’s New York, to Roman Bronze Works, the foundry that cast bronzes by Charlie Russell’s and Frederick Remington’s bronzes. This was the first of many monuments that she would create.\n\nIt was during this period Deborah married and had her only child, Fabienne. According to Deborah, this was her “life’s greatest accomplishment.”\n\nIn the post Vietnam era, Deborah won competitions to create veteran memorials including the Inland Northwest Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Montana State Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and the Washington State Korean War Memorial. She also received commissions to do monuments of Henry Kaiser, James Irvine, Frank Erwin of the University of Texas, and created a monument for The Boy Scouts Of America.\n\nIn the last decade, Deborah’s life and career have reached new heights as she has returned to her original inspiration source, the American West. Living now in southern Arizona with her husband Fred Fellows, Deborah is devoted to creating fresh, original, and accomplished sculptures which express her heartfelt feelings for the Western way of life. Surrounded by splendid Southwestern scenery and a string of good horses, she is assured an ample source of inspiration for a lifetime.\n\nColorado Springs, CO – Broadmoor Galleries is excited to announce ” Moore Art: A Family Affair,” a special exhibition featuring the works of American impressionist painter Robert Moore and his two children, Anna, and Robbie Moore. The exhibition will open on May, 18, 2023, and run through June 8th, 2023, at Broadmoor Galleries located at The Broadmoor, 1 Lake Avenue, Colorado Springs, CO 80906.\n\nWHAT: Moore Art: A Family Affair\n\nWHO: Featuring:\n\nRobert Moore, Anna Moore, and Robbie Moore\n\nWHEN: Thursday, May 18th, from 4-8PM\n\nWHERE: Broadmoor Galleries at the Broadmoor Hotel\n\n1 Lake Circle\n\nColorado Springs CO 80906\n\n(719)577-5744\n\nhttps://broadmoorgalleries.com/events/\n\nBroadmoor Galleries in Colorado Springs is proud to present “Moore Art: A Family Affair,” an exhibition that showcases the unique artistic styles of American impressionist artist Robert Moore, and his two children, Anna, and Robbie Moore. Robert, who is colorblind and paints with both hands simultaneously, has established himself as a prominent figure in the art world, and his children have followed in his footsteps.\n\nRobert Moore, a celebrated American painter who is colorblind and paints with both hands simultaneously, is known for his signature landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits. The exhibition will showcase a range of Moore’s works alongside those of his talented children.\n\n“Moore Art: A Family Affair” is a unique opportunity to experience the work of three incredibly talented artists from the same family,” said Broadmoor Galleries director, Jamie Oberloh. “Robert Moore’s impressionistic style is a true representation of the beauty and diversity of America, and his children Anna and Robbie are following in his footsteps with their own unique styles and techniques.”\n\nRobert Moore’s artistic achievements are all the more remarkable given that he is colorblind. Despite this, he has become known for his ability to create vivid and striking color palettes in his paintings. He has also developed a unique technique of painting with both hands simultaneously, which allows him to create intricate details and textures in his works.\n\nMoore’s use of both hands to paint has been compared to the way a pianist uses both hands to play a complex piece of music. This technique requires a great deal of focus and coordination, and it has become one of Moore’s signature methods.\n\nMoore’s colorblindness has also influenced his work in other ways. He has said that he is drawn to painting landscapes because he is able to see the world in shades of green, which he can differentiate more easily than other colors. This has led him to develop a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature and the environment.\n\nDespite his colorblindness and unique painting technique, Robert Moore has become one of America’s most beloved impressionist painters. His works continue to inspire and captivate viewers, and his contributions to American art are truly remarkable.\n\nAnna Moore, a professional artist in her own right, draws inspiration from her father’s work and her surroundings, using her skillful brushstrokes to capture the essence of nature in her landscapes. She works in a variety of media, including oil painting, watercolor, and printmaking. Her work is inspired by the natural beauty of the American West and the people and places that inhabit it.\n\nRobbie Moore, who recently graduated with a Finance degree from the University of Arkansas, has always had a passion for art and the natural world. He has developed his skills in drawing, gouache, watercolor, and oil painting, and his work has been featured in a company calendar commissioned by his employer. With his father’s legacy of developing artists and a lineage of artists in his family, Robbie’s future aspiration is to make the most out of his upbringing and create a name for himself in the art world.\n\n“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to showcase the work of three incredibly talented artists,” said Broadmoor Galleries’ director, Jamie Oberloh. “The combination of Robert’s impressionistic paintings with Anna and Robbie’s unique styles and mediums creates a truly exceptional exhibition that will delight and inspire our visitors. Their paintings are a true representation of the beauty and diversity of America, and we are honored to share the work with our community.”\n\nThe exhibition will be open to the public from May 18th, 2023, through June 8th, 2023, and will feature a special reception on May 18th, 2023, from 4-8 pm, where visitors can meet the artists and enjoy light refreshments. All works in the exhibition will be available for sale."
