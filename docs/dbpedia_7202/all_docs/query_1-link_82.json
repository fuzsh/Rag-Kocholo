Cast in the mold of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, The Buckaroos films had one major difference. They sported largely African American casts and were produced by African American companies. With four films usually listed as the Buckaroos legacy, this truly great moment in cinema history has been largely forgotten, except for film experts and fans of great stories.THE ADVENTURES OF THE BRONZE BUCKAROO feature leading authors in Genre Fiction today, each giving their own take on the most unique Singing Cowboy to ever ride into a theater! Load your sixguns, saddle up, and get ready to charge into two fisted matinee movie action with THE ADVENTURES OF THE BRONZE BUCKAROO!\n\nGenre: Western\n\nVisitors also looked at these books\n\nUsed availability for John Lutz's The Adventures of the Bronze Buckaroo\n\nSearch for\n\nAbout Fantastic Fiction Information for Authors"
