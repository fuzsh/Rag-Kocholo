        "text": "Art of Bronze is proud to offer “The Buckaroo” (29” H. Gallery Version) bronze statue after A. Phimister Proctor. This was the model size Proctor sculpted before making the 18 ft. tall monument. In 1914, Proctor was inspired to return to the cowboy theme after attending the Pendleton Round-Up annual rodeo in Oregon. Proctor created a spectacular composition of a cowboy atop a wild bucking horse with its forelegs planted firmly on the ground, its hind legs high in the air. Both rider and horse are perfectly balanced. Six years after starting the 29” H. model size, Proctor finished the 18 ft. monument version entitled “Broncho Buster” which is on permanent display at the Denver Civic Center Park in Denver, CO.\n\nAlexander Phimister Proctor (1860- 1950) was an American sculptor contemporary of Frederic Remington and Charles Russell. He created more public, equestrian monumental statues than any other sculptor in the United States. His monuments tell a story from the Old West and are located in many major American Cities.\n\nEach bronze sculpture is cast in the ‘lost wax’ method and hand finished to capture excellent texture and detail throughout the entire sculpture. Custom fit marble bases are attached to each sculpture. A bronze plaque with etched lettering featuring the title of the sculpture and Remington’s name is available to attach to the front or backside of the marble base.\n\nArt of Bronze is comprised of artisans, craftsmen and dedicated professionals that will guide you through the maintenance and delivery of your new sculpture.
