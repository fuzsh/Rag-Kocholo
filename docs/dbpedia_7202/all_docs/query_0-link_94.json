He was 100.\n\nJeffries died of heart failure Sunday at West Hills Hospital and Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley, said Raymond Strait, who had been working with Jeffries on his autobiography. Jeffries had been in declining health for some time.\n\nKnown for his rich baritone and sensitive phrasing, Jeffries was a member of the Duke Ellington Orchestra in the early 1940s when he scored his biggest hit with “Flamingo,” which sold in the millions and became his signature tune.\n\n“Jeffries’ version of ‘Flamingo’ with Duke Ellington was, and is, a jazz classic,” music critic Don Heckman told the Los Angeles Times in 2010. “Jeffries’ rich-toned ballad style resonated in the work of such male jazz singers as Johnny Hartman, Joe Williams and even Sammy Davis Jr. for decades after the chart-breaking success of his ‘Flamingo.’ ”\n\nAs the African-American answer to Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and other white singing cowboys, Jeffries made a handful of low-budget westerns in the ’30s.\n\nThey had titles such as “Harlem Rides the Range” and “The Bronze Buckaroo” and featured the tall, handsome, wavy-haired singer with a Gable-esque mustache as a dashing, white-hatted good guy in a black western outfit and riding a white horse named Stardusk.\n\nThe idea to make movie westerns with all-black casts was Jeffries’.\n\n“Little children of dark skin — not just Negroes, but Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, everybody of color — had no heroes in the movies,” he told the Times in 1998.\n\n“I was so glad to give them something to identify with,” he said.\n\n“Harlem on the Prairie,” billed as “the first all-Negro musical western,” was released in 1937.\n\nAmong the all-black cast members were Spencer Williams, who later portrayed Andy on “Amos ‘n’ Andy” on television, and comedian Mantan Moreland, who provided comic relief.\n\nJeffries earned $5,000 for the film, which was shot in five days at a dude ranch near Victorville.\n\nEach of the films that followed was produced just as fast. In later years, Jeffries would jokingly refer to them as “C-movies.” But he took great pride in them.\n\n“To say I was the first black singing cowboy on the face of this earth is a great satisfaction,” he told American Visions in 1997.\n\nIn an era when black actors typically played subservient roles on screen, Jeffries stood out.\n\n“Herb was a sex symbol,” New York University film professor Donald Bogle, author of “Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies & Bucks,” a history of black films, told the Times in 2003.\n\n“With his wavy hair and Clark Gable mustache, he might have been a different kind of star had America been a different kind of place,” Bogle said.\n\nThree more musical westerns starring Jeffries were released over the next two years, “Two-Gun Man from Harlem,” “The Bronze Buckaroo” and “Harlem Rides the Range.”\n\nJeffries cashed in on his fame by making stage appearances with the Four Tones, his movie backup singers.\n\nTouring in a Cadillac with steer horns on the front and his name in gold rope on the side, he’d do rope tricks, spin his six-shooters and sing.\n\nWhile promoting his final film in Detroit in 1939, Jeffries showed up at a performance by the Duke Ellington Orchestra and was invited to sing. Ellington later asked Jeffries to join his orchestra on tour.\n\nDrafted into the Army during World War II, Jeffries sang in a Special Services company entertaining troops. After the war, he had a number of hit records, including “When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano” and “Basin Street Blues.”\n\n— Los Angeles Times\n\nOriginally Published: May 25, 2014 at 11:01 p.m."
