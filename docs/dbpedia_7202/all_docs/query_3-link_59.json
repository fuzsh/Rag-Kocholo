        "text": "Herb Jeffries, known as the “Bronze Buckaroo” for his acting in 1930s vintage westerns that featured African-American casts, has returned to the Inland area to celebrate his 100th birthday this week.\n\nHe received visitors at the Café Aroma bistro in Idyllwild on his birthday, Tuesday, Sept. 24, and will be the guest of honor, accompanied by his wife, Savannah, at a banquet at 5:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 28, at the Apple Valley Inn.\n\nJeffries, who also starred in “Harlem Rides the Range,” and was a vocalist with the Duke Ellington Orchestra, lived in Idyllwild until he moved to Kansas a few years ago. He previously lived in Palm Desert.\n\nMarcy Taylor is leading a group organizing various events on behalf of the Apple Valley Chamber of Commerce and the Mohahve Historical Society. The aim is to offer activities for visitors and tourists coming to the banquet, which is nearly sold out, she said.\n\nBanquet tickets, at $35 a person or $60 a couple in advance, are available through the chamber at 760-242-2753.\n\nThere will be a field trip to film locations, the Murray Ranch site and Sycamore Rocks, led by John Bascom, president of the historical society, from 10:30 a.m. to noon Saturday leaving from the corner of Dale Evans Parkway and Waalew Road, at the service station.\n\nThen Sunday, Sept. 29, the two Jeffries films will be shown, along with a Cowboy Church event, beginning at 10 a.m. at the historic Roy Rogers Ranch, 2100 Roy Rogers Road, Oro Grande. Admission is $5 a person and food vendors will be onsite."
