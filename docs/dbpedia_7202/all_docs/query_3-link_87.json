        "text": "Herb Jeffries, \"The Bronze Buckaroo\" who made two singing cowboy movies with an allblack cast in 1939 at the Murray's Overall-Wearing Dude Ranch in Apple Valley, will celebrate his 100th birthday in September. The public is invited to celebrate the weekend of Sept. 28 and 29.\n\nOn Saturday there will be a tour of the movie sites, with a banquet that evening at the historic Apple Valley Inn, and a Sunday mini-film festival at the Roy Rogers Ranch in Oro Grande.\n\nThe first promotion for the birthday celebration at the Juneteenth Festival in Hook Park on June 15 was well-received with several supporting sponsors of the Herb Jeffries event manning their own booths for their organizations. Sponsors honoring this living legend include the town of Apple Valley, the Apple Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, the local branches of the NAACP, the Black Heritage Committee, and the National Council of Negro Women and the Happy Trails Children's Foundation. Tickets, programs and buttons can be purchased at the Apple Valley Chamber office, 16010 Apple Valley Road. For more information, call Marcy Taylor at 760-985-1918."
