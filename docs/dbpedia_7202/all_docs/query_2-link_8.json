        "text": "Herb Jeffries, a jazz balladeer and movie singer known as the “Bronze Buckaroo” who called Idyllwild home for nearly a decade, died Sunday in West Hills. He was believed to be 100, but may have been older.\n\nJeffries, who was Sicilian and Irish, was often taken as black and became the first singing star in cowboy movies aimed at segregated black audiences in the late 1930s.\n\n“I didn’t have to be discriminated against,” he told The Press-Enterprise in a 2008 interview. “I chose it. Because I’m Sicilian, I could pass for black.”\n\nSam Crowell, 55, of Idyllwild, a friend of Jeffries for a dozen years, said the singer dazzled residents with stories from his singing career, including his friendship with entertainer Frank Sinatra.\n\n“Frank Sinatra was a champion of black entertainers,” Crowell said. “When he (Jeffries) was performing in Las Vegas, he would encounter prejudice” from hotel and night club owners who thought he was black.\n\n“Frank Sinatra would say, ‘If he (Jeffries) is not welcome, I’m not performing,’” Crowell said. “He wasn’t black, but the world didn’t know that until his memoirs were written.”\n\nJeffries lived in the San Jacinto Mountains from about 2000 until 2010, friends said, entertaining friends and diners at the Café Aroma in Idyllwild with songs that included his 1941 hit “Flamingo,” which he recorded with Duke Ellington’s big band. He also read poetry at local fundraising events.\n\nA small dining room in the restaurant, containing memorabilia from his career, is named for him. He was grand marshal of Hemet’s annual Christmas parade in 2007.\n\n“He was such a wonderful person,” said Kathy Halkin, who owns the Café Aroma with her husband, Hubert. “He had quite the life being an actor and jazz singer. He sang well into his 90s. We had birthday celebrations almost every year here, including last year.”\n\nDuring his time in Idyllwild, she said, Jeffries came to the restaurant as many as five days a week, holding court sometimes from 7 a.m. to 9 at night.\n\nCrowell described him as “amazing and talented, humble and insightful. He was a man of great wisdom. If people were troubled, they would come in and talk to him. He listened to them.”\n\nJeffries died at a hospital in West Hills. The cause was stomach and heart ailments, said Raymond Strait, a friend of 70 years who had been working with Jeffries on his autobiography. Jeffries liked to exaggerate his age to shock listeners. “He wanted people to say, ‘Wow, he can still sing pretty good for 111,’ ” Strait said.\n\nJeffries had a seven-decade career in film, television, recording and in nightclubs. His baritone voice – extraordinarily rich but delicate – was memorably captured on his greatest musical success, the “Flamingo” recording.\n\nWith a towering physique and a square jaw, Jeffries was perfectly suited to capitalize on the singing-cowboy movie craze that Gene Autry and Roy Rogers popularized in the 1930s.\n\nBlack performers such as the rodeo star Bill Pickett had appeared in silent Westerns, but the Stetson-sporting, six-gun-toting Jeffries inaugurated the concept of a black singer riding in the saddle as the hero.\n\nSometimes billed as Herbert Jeffrey, he starred in a cluster of low-budget “race” pictures in the late 1930s: “Harlem on the Prairie,” “Two-Gun Man from Harlem,” “The Bronze Buckaroo” and “Harlem Rides the Range.”\n\nJeffries learned to ride on his grandfather’s dairy farm in Port Huron, Mich., and he had grown up loving the cowboy films of Tom Mix and Buck Jones. He said the idea for an all-black cowboy picture came to him while touring the South as a singer in the mid-1930s and visiting movie theaters meant for black audiences.\n\nHe had spent fruitless years trying to convince black backers that African Americans would spend money on cowboy pictures featuring people of their own color.\n\nAs a last resort, Jeffries persuaded producer Jed Buell – best known for making the 1938 all-midget Western musical “The Terror of Tiny Town” – to finance the movies.\n\nAt first, he said, Buell was hesitant to cast Jeffries because of his light skin.\n\n“I asked him, ‘What do you want, someone who can ride and sing and act, or a color?’” Jeffries told the Washington Times in 2003. “I called Buell’s attention to a picture called ‘The Good Earth,’ where Paul Muni and Luise Rainer had passed as Chinese peasants.\n\n“I challenged him: ‘Darken me up if you want to. And I’ll keep my hat on tight so no one can see my hair.’ In desperation, he said yes.”\n\nNeither had any illusion about the films’ quality. Many rehashed the plots of low-grade Westerns starring white actors. Jeffries later called his movies, some filmed on a black dude ranch near Victorville, “the first bunch of C-minus Westerns.”\n\nYet he was sentimentally attached to them. Starting in the 1980s, they contributed to a revival of interest in his career.\n\nIn 1995, he sang on a CD called “The Bronze Buckaroo (Rides Again)” that reprised “I’m a Happy Cowboy” and other songs from his movies. The release paired him with an assortment of entertainers, including the Mills Brothers, Take 6 and “Barney Miller” star Hal Linden on clarinet.\n\nJeffries never knew his father. He was raised by his mother in a boardinghouse she ran and where many singers and actors stayed. It was this exposure to show business that led Jeffries to appear, as a young man, in Detroit nightclubs and ballrooms.\n\nIn 1933, he joined up with pianist Earl “Fatha” Hines’ orchestra at the Chicago World’s Fair and spent the next two years with the band on tour.\n\nAfterward, he began vigorously pursuing a career in Hollywood as an actor, editor and songwriter. On the cowboy films, he performed most of the stunts himself.\n\nTo sell the movies, Jeffries said, he would go to black theaters and do rope tricks and sing with a backup group. As the market for race pictures was waning, he said, he “went home to Detroit to show off my ego.”\n\nIn Detroit, he drove up to a Duke Ellington band concert in a Cadillac with steer horns on the hood. Inside the ballroom, he said, Ellington could not help but notice him in his cowboy regalia and invited him to sing with the band. Soon, billed as the “Bronze Buckaroo” as an homage to his movie fame, he became the band’s first male vocalist.\n\nJeffries said he was a devotee of Eastern religions and meditated every morning and night. He had five marriages. Survivors include his wife and five children.\n\nThe Associated Press also contributed to this story."
