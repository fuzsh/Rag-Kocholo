Detroit native Herb Jeffries, the jazz singer and actor known as the “Bronze Buckaroo,” died Sunday morning from heart failure in Los Angeles at the age of 100.

Jeffries became famous for his low-vocal range and handsome looks during the 1930s and 40s era of film industry segregation. He became known as the “Bronze Buckaroo” for his role in the 1930s’ all-black western film series, including films such as: Harlem on the Prairie (1937), Two-Gun Man from Harlem (1938), Harlem Rides the Range (1939), and The Bronze Buckaroo (1939).

His vocal contributions to Duke Ellington classics such as “Flamingo,” “There Shall Be No Night,” and, “You, You Darlin’,” made him a household name, but he was limited to opportunities created specifically for black performers.

Jefferies remains the only black singing cowboy star to ever perform on the silver screen, and was considered the “last of the singing cowboys” following the deaths of Roy Rogers, and Gene Autry.
