Mainly a comedy actor, for his role in Sinners, he won the best supporting actor award at Fajr Film Festival. In the early 2000s, he tried his hand in TV and film directing, in a unique fantasy-comedic mode. This period of his career is marked by directing several successful TV series, as well as the films Spaghetti in Eight Minutes, Son of Adam, Daughter of Eve and No Men Allowed. In recent years, he has achieved immense success as a TV host. His first talk show experience in Small Talk was a success, but with Khandevaneh, he was propelled to the forefront as one of the most beloved TV personalities on Iranian TV.\n\nRambod Javan will be presenting his latest film, Negar, which stars his wife Negar Javaherian, at this year's CineIran Festival."
