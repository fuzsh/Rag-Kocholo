The present study aimed to investigate the status of molecular defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) gene in western Iranian PKU patients (predominantly from Kermanshah, Hamadan, and Lorestan provinces) during 2014-2016. Additionally, the results were compared with similar studies in Iran. Nucleotide sequence analysis of all 13 exons and their flanking intronic regions of the PAH gene was performed in 18 western Iranian PKU patients. Moreover, a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) located in the PAH gene was studied. The results revealed a mutational spectrum encompassing 11 distinct mutations distributed along the PAH gene sequence on 34 of the 36 mutant alleles (diagnostic efficiency of 94.4%). Also, four PAH VNTR alleles (with repeats of 3, 7, 8 and 9) were detected. The three most frequent mutations were IVS9+5G>A, IVS7-5T>C, and p.P281L with the frequency of 27.8%, 11%, and 11%, respectively. The results showed that there is not only a consanguineous relation, but also a difference in PAH characters of mutations between Kermanshah and the other two parts of western Iran (Hamadan and Lorestan). Also, it seems that the spectrum of mutations in western Iran is relatively distinct from other parts of the country, suggesting that this region might be a special PAH gene distribution region. Moreover, our findings can be useful in the identification of genotype to phenotype relationship in patients, and provide future abilities for confirmatory diagnostic testing, prognosis, and predict the severity of PKU patients.\n\nMineralization related to Alvand pluton in the Hamadan, western Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSalehi, M. H.; Doosti, E. A.; Ahadnejad, V.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nThe Alvand (Hamadan) plutonic batholith is one of the largest plutonic bodies in the Sanandaj-Sirjan metamorphic belt. This complex is consist of mafic part (gabbro-diorite-tonalite), intermediate (granite-granodiorite porphyroids), and hololeucocratic granitoids. Previous studies have shown that S-type granite-granodiorites are mostly peraluminous and calc-alkaline; the gabbro-diorite-tonalite suite is mostly metaluminous and tholeiitic to calc-alkaline (Sepahi, 2008). High initial 87Sr-86Sr ratios (0.7081 to 0.7115), low epsilon Nd values (-1.0 to -3.3), and peraluminous character reflects a different origin for the granites, possibly crustal sources (Ghalamghash et al, 2007). Aplite-pegmatite dikes are intruded in granitoide rocks, metamorphic rocks and the contact of Alvand granite with metamorphic rocks. The contact of Alvand granite with metamorphic rocks is sharp. By using heavy mineral studies on the alluvium of Alvand complex, it is recognized 28 minerals amongst Scheelite, Cassiterite, Ilmenite, Zircon and Garnet. Different geostatistical studies such as variant, bivariant and multivariant studies have been done on rough data of heavy minerals. They showed normal concentration of gold in studied rocks and low enrichment of tin and tungsten. The index of the ore elements average, frequeney distribution criteria of elements, the ratio of elements index and multielements show that Alvand granite is barren. Mineralography studies did not recognized any tin and tungsten minerals. The grains of gold was recognized in some of the microscopic thin sections. Calcopyrotite is the most important ore mineral that is accompanied with oxides and iron carbonates. The contacts of aplite-pegmatite dikes with granitoide rocks mostly are not prolific. For recognizing Scheelite, some samples of rocks studied by ultraviolet and few Scheelite is recognized in the samples. Some alteration zone observed in this area but they are not accompany with main mineralization.

METHODS: A control programme in rural areas of Hamadan Province, which began in November 1997, involved giving all persons a single dose of 400 mg albendazole at intervals of three months. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated by the formalin-ether concentration technique for stool examination and by the Stoll quantitative method. FINDINGS: The average rate of infection with Ascaris before treatment was 53.3%, ranging from 40% in Hamadan district to 75% in Toysercan. Two areas, Malayer and Nahavand, were excluded from the programme because the infection rates were only 13% and 4%, respectively. After two years of mass treatment the infection rate had decreased to 6%. The proportion of positive cases excreting only unfertilized eggs increased to 32%. No side-effects of mass treatment were observed. CONCLUSION: Systematic mass treatment giving high coverage proved to be very effective in the control of ascariasis, notwithstanding a lack of other preventive measures.

The phosphorous buffer capacity (PBC) of soil is important in plant nutrition and is an important soil property in the determination of the P release potential of soils. Phosphorus sorption greatly affects both plant nutrition and environmental pollution. For better and accurate P fertilizer recommendations, it is necessary to quantify P sorption. This study was conducted to investigate available P and P sorption by calcareous soils in a semi-arid region of Hamadan, western Iran. The soil samples were mainly from cultivated land. Olsenâs biocarbonate extractable P (Olsen P) varied among soils and ranged from 10 to 80 mg kg-1 with a mean of 36 mg kg-1. Half of the soils had an Olsen P > 40 mg kg-1 and >70% of them had a concentration >20 mg kg-1, whereas the critical concentration for most crops is <15 mg P kg-1. Greater average Olsen P in soils occurred under garlic (56 mg kg-1) and potato (44 kg kg-1) fields than in dry-land wheat farming (24 mg kg-1), pasture (30 mg kg-1), and wheat (24 mg P kg-1) fields. A marked increase in fertilizer P rates applied to agricultural soils has caused P to be accumulated in the surface soil. Phosphate sorption curves were well fitted to the Freundlich equation. The standard P requirement (SPR) of soils, defined as the amount of P sorbed at an equilibrium concentration of 0.2 mg l-1 ranged from 4 to 102 mg kg-1. Phosphorus buffer capacity was relatively high and varied from 16 to 123 l kg-1 with an average of 58 l kg-1. In areas of intensive crop production, continual P applications as P fertilizer and farmyard manure have been used at levels exceeding crop requirements. Surface soil accumulations of P are high enough that loss of P in surface runoff and a high risk for P transfer into groundwater have become priority management concerns.\n\nPrevalence of anabolic steroid use and associated factors among body-builders in Hamadan, West province of Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nRazavi, Zahra; Moeini, Babak; Shafiei, Yones; Bazmamoun, Hassan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAndrogenic-anabolic steroids (AAS) are abused by a growing number of bodybuilders. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to determine prevalence and patterns of AAS use by bodybuilders in Hamadan, western Iran. In this cross-sectional study, participants were recruited from five gym clubs in two area of Hamadan (a total of 10 clubs). Twenty-five bodybuilders from each club were administered. Questions investigating demographic information, sport history, education level, general knowledge about AAS, and their side effects were asked. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16. The frequency of AAS use was 28.8% (72/250). Fifty-four percent of users were 25 years or younger. AAS abuse showed a significant association with duration of exercise. The drugs were suggested mostly from peers (43.1%) and coaches (36.1%). The most commonly consumed anabolic steroid was testosterone (66.7%). The most commonly reported AAS side effect was acne (18.1%). There was not significant association between general knowledge about side effects of ASS and their use. The results of current survey indicate that frequency of ASS use is high in adolescents and young adult bodybuilders. Well educated bodybuilders have a higher prevalence of abuse. Awareness about the side effects of drugs is not deterrent factor for their abuse. Iranian Ministry of Sport and the Youth, and the National Council for Youth, should be urged to conduct more effective prevention strategies.\n\nPredictive Factors of Regular Physical Activity among Middle-Aged Women in the West of Iran, Hamadan: Application of PRECEDE Model.\n\nPubMed\n\nEmdadi, Shohreh; Hazavehie, Seyed Mohammad Mehdi; Soltanian, Alireza; Bashirian, Saeed; Heidari Moghadam, Rashid\n\n2015-01-01\n\nRegular physical activity is important for midlife women. Models and theories help better understanding this behavior among middle-aged women and better planning for change behavior in target group. This study aimed to investigate predictive factors of regular physical activity among middle-aged women based on PRECEDE model as a theoretical framework. This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 866 middle-aged women of Hamadan City western Iran, recruited with a proportional stratified sampling method in 2015. The participants completed a self-administered questionnaire including questions on demographic characteristics and PRECEDE model constructs and IPAQ questionnaire. Data were then analyzed by SPSS-16 and AMOS-16 using the Pearson correlation test and the pathway analysis method. Overall, 57% of middle-aged women were inactive (light level) or not sufficiently active. With SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) analysis, knowledge b=0.84, P<0.001, attitude b=0.799, P<0.001, self-efficacy b=0.633, P<0.001 as predisposing factor and social support as reinforcing factor b=0.2, P<0.001 were the most important predictors for physical activity among middle-aged women in Hamadan. The framework of the PRECEDE model is useful in understanding regular physical activity among middle-aged women. Furthermore, results showed the importance of predisposing and reinforcing factors when planning educational interventions.\n\nPediculosis capitis and relevant factors in secondary school students of Hamadan, west of Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nOmidi, Afsar; Khodaveisi, Masoud; Moghimbeigi, Abas; Mohammadi, Nahid; Amini, Roya\n\n2013-09-17\n\nPediculosis capitis is a problem in children and has worldwide distribution. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of pediculosis degree and its relevant factors in the secondary schools in Hamadan west of Iran. The study was carried out in two phases. A cross-sectional procedure was used to determine the prevalence of pediculosis, and the case study was done to identify the relevant factors to the infestation. Totally, 10841 secondary students were chosen and classified in accordance with the clustering sample. The prevalence of pediculosis was 1.05%. It was 1.27% among the urban student; whereas 0.05% among the rural students. About 2.3% belonged to female students, and 0.11% was pertained to the male students. The greatest amount of infestation prevalence was reported from the schools of urban areas particularly in the public schools of suburbia. Furthermore, the prevalence of infestation was more where some individuals had pediculosis previous history and suffered from head inching. It turned out to be a significant relationship between pediculosis, head itching (P<0.001) and previous history of pediculosis (P<0.001). The prevalence of pediculosis in Hamadan is low, but is more in the areas which are deprived of the access to health facilities. Therefore, there is a need for educational campaigns about danger of infection and regular mass screening at school.\n\nAntibiogram of bacteria isolated from automated teller machines in Hamadan, West Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMahmoudi, Hassan; Arabestani, Mohammad Reza; Alikhani, Mohammad Yousef; Sedighi, Iraj; Kohan, Hamed Farhadi; Molavi, Mohammad\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAim: Bacteria are ubiquitous in the environment. In keeping with the continued expansion of urbanization and the growing population, an increasing number of people use automated banking, i.e. automated teller machines (ATMs). The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial contamination and its antibiotic sensitivity on computer keyboards located at ATMs in Hamadan province, Iran. Method: Out of 360 ATMs at four locations in Hamadan, 96 were randomly selected for this study. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern of all isolates was determined by the agar disk diffusion method using gentamicin (10 Âµg), vancomycin (30 Âµg), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (25 Âµg), amikacin (30 Âµg), tobramycin (10 Âµg), cephalotin (30 Âµg), norfloxacin (5 Âµg), and ceftizoxim (30 Âµg) disks. Results: Melli and Saderat Banks had the most frequently contaminated ATMS, with 18 (27.7%) and 12 (18.5%), respectively. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 12 (18.5%) ATMs, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 12 (18.5%), Bacillus subtilis in 11 (16.9%), Escherichia coli in 6 (9.2%), Klebsiella spp. in 8 (12.3%), Enterobacter spp. in 2 (3.1%), Bacillus cereus in 6 (9.2%), Staphylococcus aureus in 3 (4.6%), and Micrococcaceae spp. in 5 (7.69%) cases. All isolated bacteria were susceptible to gentamicin, cephalotin, tobramycin, amikacin, norfloxacin, and vancomycin. The S. aureus resistance rate to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was 50%. Conclusion: All tested ATM keyboards were contaminated with at least one species of bacteria. Based on these findings, it is recommendable to disinfect the hands after entering oneâs own apartment, work area or a hospital, in order to hinder the spread of critical pathogens in the personal environment or in the hospital.

In this cross-sectional descriptive study, the samples were collected for a periods of 12 months between January 25, 2014 and January 25, 2015 from frequently used household taps as well as from municipal and communal water supplies. The main parameters investigated were nitrate, fluoride, pH, turbidity and chlorine. The maximum and minimum values for nitrate concentrations were measured as 140.80 mg/l and 1.56 mg/l, respectively. Nitrate and fluoride content of samples were higher in wet season than in dry season and their concentration was higher in rural areas rather to urban areas. On average, fluoride contents in both urban and rural areas were well compliance with the WHO guidelines. The pH of all samples of the study regions was in the ranges of 6.25 to 8.41 that were in the standard ranges. Twenty three percent of total samples were exceeded Iranian standards of one NTU for turbidity. The groundwater of the study area is presently having not serious health risks. However, regarding that disinfection efficiency adversely is affected by turbidity, particular attention and more programs for regular monitoring has to be done, which will not always be done in all regions.\n\nSeroprevalence of Brucellosis in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patients in Hamadan, Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKeramat, Fariba; Majzobi, Mohammad Mehdi; Poorolajal, Jalal; Ghane, Zohreh Zarei; Adabi, Maryam\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjectives Brucellosis is a systemic disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of brucellosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients in Hamadan Province in the west of Iran. Methods A total of 157 HIV-infected patients were screened through standard serological tests, including Wrightâs test, Coombsâ Wright test, and 2-mercaptoethanol Brucella agglutination test (2ME test), blood cultures in Castaneda media, and CD4 counting. Data were analyzed using Stata version 11. Results Wright and Coombsâ Wright tests were carried out, and only 5 (3.2%) patients had positive serological results. However, all patients had negative 2ME results, and blood cultures were negative for Brucella spp. Moreover, patients with positive serology and a mean CD4 count of 355.8 Â± 203.11 cells/Î¼L had no clinical manifestations of brucellosis, and, and the other patients had a mean CD4 count of 335.55 Â± 261.71 cells/Î¼L. Conclusion Results of this study showed that HIV infection is not a predisposing factor of acquiring brucellosis. PMID:28904852\n\nA clinicopathological study of odontogenic cysts and tumors in hamadan, iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaghaei, Fahimeh; Zargaran, Massoumeh; Najmi, Hamidreza; Moghimbeigi, Abbas\n\n2014-12-01\n\nOdontogenic cysts and tumors are the most frequent osseous destructive lesions of the jaws; however, there is little information regarding the relative frequency of these lesions among the Iranian population. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of clinically and histologically- diagnosed odontogenic cysts and tumors during a period of 13 years in Hamadan, and also its correlation with age, gender, and the site of the lesion. A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on 413 oral and maxillofacial specimens during 1996 to 2008.The age and the gender of patients, as well as the site of lesion were recorded. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. Totally, 70 specimens were recorded as odontogenic cysts and 11 specimens were diagnosed as odontogenic tumors. The most frequent odontogenic cysts were dentigerous cysts (27.2%), followed by radicular cysts (18.6%) and odontogenic keratocysts (18.6%). In addition, cysts were more frequent in male than female individuals. Ameloblastoma was the most frequent odontogenic tumor (64%). Odontogenic cysts were in correlation with age, gender and location. These results showed that dentigerous cyst and odontogenic keratocyst were more frequent than other studies. More investigations should be performed to determine the frequency of odontogenic tumors in Iran.\n\nSinkhole susceptibility mapping using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and magnitude-frequency relationships: A case study in Hamadan province, Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaheri, Kamal; GutiÃ©rrez, Francisco; Mohseni, Hassan; Raeisi, Ezzat; Taheri, Milad\n\n2015-04-01\n\nSince 1989, an increasing number of sinkhole occurrences have been reported in the Kabudar Ahang and Razan-Qahavand subcatchments (KRQ) of Hamadan province, western Iran. The sinkhole-related subsidence phenomenon poses a significant threat for people and human structures, including sensitive facilities like the Hamadan Power Plant. Groundwater over-exploitation from the thick alluvial cover and the underlying cavernous limestone has been identified as the main factor involved in sinkhole development. A sinkhole susceptibility model was produced in a GIS environment applying the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach and considering a selection of eight factors, each categorized into five classes: distance to faults (DF), water level decline (WLD), groundwater exploitation (GE), penetration of deep wells into karst bedrock (PKA), distance to deep wells (DDW), groundwater alkalinity (GA), bedrock lithology (BL), and alluvium thickness (AT). Relative weights were preliminarily assigned to each factor and to their different classes through systematic pairwise comparisons based on expert judgment. The resulting sinkhole susceptibility index (SSI) values were then classified into four susceptibility classes: low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility. Subsequently, the model was refined through a trial and error process involving changes in the relative weights and iterative evaluation of the prediction capability. Independent evaluation of the final model indicates that 55% and 45% of the subsidence events fall within the very high and high, susceptibility zones, respectively. The results of this study show that AHP can be a useful approach for susceptibility assessment if data on the main controlling factors have sufficient accuracy and spatial coverage. The limitations of the model are partly related to the difficulty of gathering data on some important geological factors, due to their hidden nature. The magnitude and frequency relationship constructed\n\nA Clinicopathological Study of Odontogenic Cysts and Tumors in Hamadan, Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBaghaei, Fahimeh; Zargaran, Massoumeh; Najmi, Hamidreza; Moghimbeigi, Abbas\n\n2014-01-01\n\nStatement of the Problem: Odontogenic cysts and tumors are the most frequent osseous destructive lesions of the jaws; however, there is little information regarding the relative frequency of these lesions among the Iranian population. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of clinically and histologically- diagnosed odontogenic cysts and tumors during a period of 13 years in Hamadan, and also its correlation with age, gender, and the site of the lesion.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors influencing self-medication based on health belief model. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1400 Hamadan Province pharmacies visitors, during spring and summer 2012 which was randomly selected with the proportional to size among different pharmacy at Hamadan for participation in this study. A structured questionnaire was applied for collecting data, which were analyzed by SPSS version 16 using bivariate correlations and logistic regression statistical tests. 35.4% of the participants had self-medication. Pain medication (10.6%), antibiotics (7.3%) and anti-cough and cold medications (4.5%) had the largest consumption. The main reasons of self-medication among participants were previous use of medication, symptoms improve and similar prescribed. The best predictor for self-medication was perceived severity with odds ratio estimate of 0.790 [95% CI: 0.694, 0.900]. It seems that designing and implementation of educational programs to increase seriousness about side effect of self-medication may be usefulness of the results in order to prevent of self-medication.\n\nInvestigation of Nutritional Behaviors in the First and Second Trimesters in Pregnant Women Referring to Clinics in Hamadan, Iran, in 2013.\n\nPubMed\n\nMasoumi, Seyedeh Zahra; Parsa, Parisa; Kazemi, Farideh; Soltanian, Ali Reza; Dadvand, Gissoo; Habib, Shabnam\n\n2016-09-01\n\nPregnancy is a particular period in women's life that is accompanied by an increase in nutritional needs. Having a normal pregnancy period and successful pregnancy outcomes depends on the intake of sufficient amount of food. The present study aimed to determine nutritional behaviors in pregnant women in the first and second trimesters referring to clinics in Hamadan, Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 170 women referred to health and treatment centers of Hamadan in 2013. Among Hamadan's health and treatment centers, 10 were selected as the research setting through cluster sampling. Then, the pregnant women at 8-24 weeks of gestation were randomly entered into the study. The data were collected using nutritional behaviors questionnaire in three months. Accordingly, mean scores below 50, between 50 and 75, and above 75 were considered as weak, moderate, and perfect nutritional behaviors, respectively. The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software, version 21 and P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The results showed that more than three fourths of the study participants had moderate nutritional behaviors. Insufficient intake of fruit, vegetables, and cereals was detected in 80.6%, 54.1%, and 47.1% of the participants, respectively. Besides, 30% of the women had not used folic acid supplement during their pregnancy period or were not aware of its necessity. The results of multivariate analysis indicated that age was only significantly associated with pregnant women's score of nutritional behaviors (P=0.010). Additionally, no significant relationship was found between the women's nutritional behaviors and their strategies for elimination of common pregnancy complications, such as constipation, heartburn, urinary tract infection, and anemia. Considering the participants' moderate nutritional behaviors, health and treatment centers are recommended to provide the necessary training for improving pregnant women's nutritional\n\nThe Resistance to Plague Infection among Meriones persicus from Endemic and Non-endemic Regions in Iran: The Role of Gut Microbiota\n\nPubMed Central\n\nASSMAR, Mehdi; KEYPOUR, Marjan; ROHANI, Mehdi; MOSTAFAVI, Ehsan; DANESHVAR FARHUD, Dariush\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground: The present study was conducted approximately 40 years ago, but its results have not been released. At the time of this study, the importance of the gut microbiota was not fully understood. Methods: Meriones persicus rodents, as one of the major reservoirs of Yersinia pestis bacterium in Iran, were compared in a disease endemic area (Akanlu, Hamadan, western Iran) and a non-endemic zone (Telo, Tehran, Iran) from 1977 to 1981. Results: This study was able to transmit the resistance to Y. pestis to other rodents creatively by using and transferring gut microbiota. Conclusion: The study indicated for the first time that the gut microbiota could affect the sensitivity to plague in Meriones in Telo.

To investigate the bacterial contaminations of house flies and determine the resistance of these bacteria against various antibiotics. An analytical descriptive cross- sectional study was conducted. The study was performed from July to September 2015 in Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran. A total number of 300 house flies were collected from four places, 75 flies from each place, including two educational hospitals belonging to Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, a fruit and vegetables center, and a livestock slaughter. The body surface of house flies was washed using the physiological sterile serum and the obtained solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for five minutes. The identification of bacteria was carried out using the phenotypic methods. The resistance of bacteria against various antibiotics was determined using the disk diffusion approach. Data were analysed by the employment of SPSS software package version 20.0. A total number of 394 bacterial strains were isolated from 275 house flies. The most prevalent type of bacteria was Bacillus spp which was detected in 31.1% of house flies. Moreover, Staphylococcus s pp. (22.9%), Escherichia coli (11.6%) were other prevalent species, whereas, Enterococcus s pp. was the least prevalent type of bacteria in the collected house flies. In terms of resistance to antibiotics, it was identified that bacteria extracted from house flies which were collected from hospital environments were more resistant to antibiotics compared with the resistance of bacteria extracted from house flies which were collected from non hospital environments. The maximum bacterial isolation was found in houseflies from hospital No.1 environment from around the accumulation of garbage. It is a well-known fact that house flies are a source of bacterial\n\nToxicity of Cypermethrin and Chlorpyrifos Against German Cockroach [ Blattella germanica (Blattaria: Blattellidae)] Strains from Hamadan, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nNazari, Mansour; Motlagh, Behrouz Alipourian; Nasirian, Hassan\n\nGerman cockroach has relatively short life cycle and reproduce rapidly. It is the most common medically and public health pest. As a result, it is essential to combat this pest. Cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos are used by private companies in Hamadan to control Blattella germanica. It seems necessary to determine its susceptibility levels to these insecticides. The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility levels of B. germanica strains to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos in Hamadan. In this study, the German cockroach strains were collected from two hospitals (Fatemiyeh and Atiyeh) in Hamadan and transfered to the insectarium. The cockroach strains were reared under the same laboratory condition. Then their sensitivity levels were considered to 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg m -2 for cypermethrin and 0.82, 1.65, 3.31, 6.63, 9.945 and 13.26 mg m -2 for chlorpyrifos using surface contact method. Results based on insecticide treated doses, B. germanica strains showed different percent mortality to the insecticides ranged from 13.3-100. The LD 50 and LD 90 and regression lines of the treated insecticides against German cockroach strains indicate that Fatemiyeh Hospital strain is more susceptible to the treated insecticides than Atiyeh Hospital strain. The LD 50 and LD 90 of chlorpyrifos are also lower than cypermethrin, indicated that chlorpyrifos is more effective than cypermethrin against German cockroach. As the slopes of the regression lines are observed mild in this study indicate that the population of the cockroach strains is very heterogeneous. It can be a symbol of insecticides resistance to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos. As chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin insecticides are also used for residual spraying by private companies and the doses which provide more than 90% mortality are below the WHO recommended insecticide doses. Therefore, chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin insecticides can be used for B. germanica control in Hamadan within regular monitoring and preventive\n\nInvestigation of health promotion status in specialized hospitals associated with Hamadan University of Medical Sciences: health-promoting hospitals.\n\nPubMed\n\nHamidi, Yadollah; Hazavehei, Seyed Mohammad Mahdi; Karimi-Shahanjarini, Akram; SeifRabiei, Mohamad Ali; Farhadian, Maryam; Alimohamadi, Shohreh; Kharghani Moghadam, Seyedeh Melika\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe prophecy of health promoting hospitals (HPH) is bringing about a change and transition from treatment-oriented to health-oriented attitudes. In Iran, hospitals usually play the traditional roles. The present study was aimed at the evaluation of the health promotion status in specialized hospitals associated with Hamadan University of Medical Sciences (HUMS). This applied study was conducted in two Hamadan specialized hospitals in the Hamadan city. The health promotion status was evaluated using a self-assessment checklist designed by the World Health Organization's HPH. The evaluation was done in five standards including management policy, patient assessment, patient information and intervention, promotion of a healthy workplace and continuity and cooperation. The results showed that both the hospitals studied had a poor status in terms of promoting a healthy workplace (averageÂ =Â 31.24%) and management policy standards (averageÂ =Â 35.29%) in comparison with the other relevant standards: patient assessment (53.12%), patient information and intervention (62.5%), continuity and cooperation (65.78%)). The results of the standards and sub-standards status displayed better performance in the cardiovascular hospital (53.67%) compared to the women and parturition hospital (42.64%). The findings indicated that HPH standards are very low in the studied hospitals. The reason behind this wide gap might be due to the fact that hospitals in Iran are more treatment-oriented and patient-oriented and they do not play an active part in health promoting. It was found that management policy and promoting healthy workplace standards had the worst status and must be improved.\n\nEffect of Group Counseling on Quality of Life among Postmenopausal Women in Hamadan, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nParsa, Parisa; Tabesh, Roya Ahmainia; Soltani, Farzaneh; Karami, Manoochehr\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the effect of counseling on quality of life (QOL) in postmenopausal women conducted in Hamadan, Iran in 2015. In this quasi-experimental study, 80 postmenopausal women were randomly selected and allocated to case and control groups (40 per group). Data collection tool included questionnaires of demographic information and QOL during menopause, which were completed by the samples before the intervention. In the case group, training program was run during four sessions in the form of weekly consulting sessions for 45 to 60 minutes. Training program included familiarity with menopause symptoms, confrontation and self-care during this period. The control group, only received routine cares. Three months after intervention, information were collected in both groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows. Before the intervention, mean Â± standard deviation for QOL in case group was 101.2 Â± 31.4 and it was significantly decreased to 96.9 Â± 27.0 after intervention ( P < 0.05). While no significant change was observed in the control group (from 98.9 Â± 35.5 to 102.3 Â± 35.0, P = 0.443). Symptoms of physical ( P = 0.033) and sexual ( P < 0.001) dimensions significantly decreased in the case group. While significant increase was observed in terms of psychosocial ( P = 0.049) and sexual symptoms in control group. Findings suggested impact of consulting on improvement of QOL during menopause. Supportive consulting can be a suitable approach for improving women's health, reducing problems and enhancing QOL in menopause period.\n\nThe magmatism and metamorphism at the Malayer area, Western Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAhadnejad, V.; Valizadeh, M. V.; Esmaeily, D.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nThe Malayer area is located in the NW-SE aligned Sanandaj-Sirjan metamorphic belt, western Iran and consists mainly of Mesozoic schists so-called Hamadan Phyllites, Jurassic to Tertiary intrusive rocks and related contact metamorphic aureoles, aplites and pegmatites. The Sanandj-Sirjan Zone is produced by oblique collisional event between Arabian plate and Central Iran microcontinent. Highest level of regional metamorphism in the area is greenschist facies and injection of felsic magmas is caused contact metamorphism. Magmatism is consist of a general northwest trend large felsic to intermediate intrusive bodies. The main trend of structural features i.e. faults, fractures and other structural features is NW-SE. The Malayer granitoid complex is ellipsoid in shape and has NW-SE foliation especially at the corners of the intrusions. Petrography of the magmatic rocks revealed recrystallization of quartz and feldspars, bending of biotite, and aligment of minerals paralle to the main trend of magmatic and metamorphic country rocks. These indicated that intrusion of felsic magma is coincide to the regional metamorphism and is syn-tectoinc. Non-extensive contact metamorphism aureoles and rareness of pegmatite and aplite in the area are interpreted as injection of felsic magmas into the high-strain metamorphic zone. The regional metamorphic rocks mainly consist of meta-sandstone, slate, phyllite, schist. These gray to dark metasedimentary rocks are consist of quartz, muscovite, turmaline, epidote, biotite and chlorite. Sheeted minerals form extended schistosity and study of porphyroblast-matrix relationships shows that injection of granitic magma into the country rocks is syn to post-tectonic. Syn-tectonic indicating porphyroblast growth synchronous with the development of the external fabric. The thermal contact area of the granite can be observed in the contact margin of granite and regional metamorphic rocks, where it produced hornfelses, andalusit-garnet schists and\n\nPrevalence of zoonotic intestinal parasites in household and stray dogs in rural areas of Hamadan, Western Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nSardarian, K; Maghsood, A H; Ghiasian, S A; Zahirnia, A H\n\n2015-06-01\n\nZoonotic parasitic infections are a major global public and veterinary health problem and widespread among dogs. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasites in stray and household dogs in the rural areas of Hamadan district. During 2012, 1,500 fresh fecal samples from 243 household and 1,257 stray dogs were examined by using direct wet mount, simple zinc sulfate flotation, and Lugol's solution staining. Of 1,500 dogs, 20.4% were positive for intestinal parasites. Helminthes eggs were more frequently found in fecal samples than protozoan cysts or trophozoites (15.9% vs. 4.5%, respectively). Toxocara canis was the most frequently detected parasite, with a prevalence of 6.3%, followed by Taenia/Echinococcus spp. (2.9%), Isospora spp. (2.7%), and Toxascaris leonina (2.6%). Helminthes and protozoa were significantly more prevalent in household dogs than in stray dogs (P<0.001). There were significant differences in the prevalence of Isospora spp., T. canis and D. caninum among three age groups (P<0.05). The wide range of isolated parasites indicated that people residing in this area are at risk of exposure to these potentially hazardous zoonotic pathogens. Mass education of the general population is highly recommended to increase awareness of the potential for horizontal transmission of these parasitic infections from dogs to humans.\n\nInfantsâ Exposure to Aflatoxin M1 from Motherâs Breast Milk in Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGhiasian, SA; Maghsood, AH\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground The occurrence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk, especially breast milk, is a valuable biomarker for exposure determination to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In the present study, the risk of exposure to AFM1 in infants fed breast milk was investigated. Methods: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for the analysis of AFM1 in breast milk samples from 132 lactating mothers referred to four urban Mothers and Babies Care Unit of Hamadan, western Iran. Results: AFM1 was detected in eight samples (6.06%) at mean concentration of 9.45 ng/L. The minimum and maximum of concentration was 7.1 to 10.8 ng/L, respectively. Although the concentration of AFM1 in none of the samples was higher than the maximum tolerance limit accepted by USA and European Union (25 ng/kg) however, 25% had a level of AFM1 above the allowable level of Australia and Switzerland legal limit (10 ng/L). Conclusions: Lactating mothers and infants in western parts of Iran could be at risk for AFB1 and AFM1 exposure, respectively. Considering all this information, the investigation of AFM1 in lactating mothers as a biomarker for post-natal exposure of infants to this carcinogen deserves further studies in various seasons and different parts of Iran.

Having a normal pregnancy period and successful pregnancy outcomes depends on the intake of sufficient amount of food. The present study aimed to determine nutritional behaviors in pregnant women in the first and second trimesters referring to clinics in Hamadan, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 170 women referred to health and treatment centers of Hamadan in 2013. Among Hamadanâs health and treatment centers, 10 were selected as the research setting through cluster sampling. Then, the pregnant women at 8-24 weeks of gestation were randomly entered into the study. The data were collected using nutritional behaviors questionnaire in three months. Accordingly, mean scores below 50, between 50 and 75, and above 75 were considered as weak, moderate, and perfect nutritional behaviors, respectively. The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software, version 21 and P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: The results showed that more than three fourths of the study participants had moderate nutritional behaviors. Insufficient intake of fruit, vegetables, and cereals was detected in 80.6%, 54.1%, and 47.1% of the participants, respectively. Besides, 30% of the women had not used folic acid supplement during their pregnancy period or were not aware of its necessity. The results of multivariate analysis indicated that age was only significantly associated with pregnant womenâs score of nutritional behaviors (P=0.010). Additionally, no significant relationship was found between the womenâs nutritional behaviors and their strategies for elimination of common pregnancy complications, such as constipation, heartburn, urinary tract infection, and anemia. Discussion and Conclusion: Considering the participantsâ moderate nutritional behaviors, health and treatment centers are recommended to provide the\n\nPrevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli isolated from adolescents and adults in Hamedan, Western Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlikhani, Mohammad Yousef; Hashemi, Seyyed Hamid; Aslani, Mohammad Mehdi; Farajnia, Safar\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground and Objectives Pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli are a common cause of acute infectious diarrhea. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency, virulence markers and antibiotic resistance patterns of diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) isolated from adolescents and adults in Hamadan, west of Iran. Materials and Methods A total of 187 stool samples were collected from adults with acute diarrhea. Stool culture was performed by conventional methods for enteropathogenic bacteria. Virulence factor genes for DEC were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using the disk diffusion method. Results Among the 187 patients, 40 (21.4%) were positive for DEC. The most frequently identified DEC was enteropathogenic E. coli (47.5%), followed by enteroaggregative (20%), enterotoxigenic (17.5%) and shiga-toxin producing E. coli (15%). No isolates of enteroinvasive E. coli were detected. All STEC strains were stx+ / eaeA-. Out of the seven ETEC strains, five (71.4%) produced ST, one (14.3%) produced only LT and one (14.3%) of the isolates produced both ST and LT encoded by est and elt genes, respectively. Among the 40 DEC strains 27(67.5%) were multidrug resistant. Conclusion DEC contribute to the burden of diarrhea in adults in Hamadan. Enteropathogenic E. coli was the most commonly identified DEC strain in the region studied.

Using ground based dataset of dust events in western Iran and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, the atmospheric circulation patterns of dust events in the Arabian region and west of Iran are identified. The atmospheric circulation patterns which lead to dust events in the Arabian region and western Iran were classified into two main categories: the Shamal dust events that occurs in warm period of year and the frontal dust events as cold period pattern. In frontal dust events, the western trough or blocking pattern at mid-level leads to frontogenesis, instability, and air uplift at lower levels of troposphere in the southwest of Asia. Non-frontal is other pattern of dust event in the cold period and dust generation are due to the regional circulation systems at the lower level of troposphere. In Shamal wind pattern, the Saudi Arabian anticyclone, Turkmenistan anticyclone, and Zagros thermal low play the key roles in formation of this pattern. Summer and transitional patterns are two sub-categories of summer Shamal wind pattern. In summer trough pattern, the mid-tropospheric trough leads to intensify the surface thermal systems in the Middle East and causes instability and rising of wind speed in the region. In synthetic pattern of Shamal wind and summer trough, dust is created by the impact of a trough in mid-levels of troposphere as well as existing the mentioned regional systems which are contributed in formation of summer Shamal wind pattern.\n\nHeavy metals concentration in vegetables irrigated with contaminated and fresh water and estimation of their daily intakes in suburb areas of Hamadan, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeid-Mohammadi, Abdolmotaleb; Roshanaei, Ghodratollah; Asgari, Ghorban\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study was conducted to estimate the level of heavy metals accumulate in vegetables irrigated with contaminated water compared with those irrigated with fresh water in Hamadan, west of Iran in 2012. Sixty samples of different vegetables i.e., parsley, tarragon, sweat basil and leek irrigated with contaminated water and thirty six samples from three different adjacent areas irrigated with fresh water as control were analyzed to determine heavy metals. The concentration of heavy metals i.e., lead, cadmium and chromium were achieved using atomic adsorption spectrophotometer. The mean concentration of lead, chromium and cadmium regardless of the kind of vegetables irrigated with contaminated water was 6.24, 1.57 and 0.15 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, metals uptake differences by the vegetables were recognized to vegetable differences in tolerance to heavy metals. Based on the above concentrations the dietary intakes of metals through vegetables consumption were 0.004, 0.0008 and 6E-05 mg/day in infants for lead, chromium and cadmium, respectively. The high concentration of these heavy metals in some vegetables might be attributed due to the use of untreated sanitary and industrial wastewater by farmers for the irrigation of vegetable lands. Therefore, treating of these wastewater and bioremediation of excess metals from polluted vegetation land could be considered.\n\nMercury, Lead, Cadmium, and Barium Levels in Human Breast Milk and Factors Affecting Their Concentrations in Hamadan, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nVahidinia, Aliasghar; Samiee, Fateme; Faradmal, Javad; Rahmani, Alireza; Taravati Javad, Masoumeh; Leili, Mostafa\n\n2018-04-26\n\nBreast milk is considered the best source of nutrition for all infants. However, exposure of newborns to toxic metals is of special interest due to their potential harmful effects. Thus, the primary aims of this study were to determine the concentration of toxic heavy metals including lead, mercury, cadmium, and barium in breast milk samples from Hamadan, Iran, in relation to some sociodemographic variables. A total of 100 breast milk samples were collected and their heavy metal contents were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The median breast milk concentrations of Pb, Hg, and Ba were 41.9, 2.8, and 1.95Â Î¼g/L, respectively. Cd levels wereâ<â1Â Î¼g/L in all samples. The Pb level in 94% of the samples was higher than the recommended Pb limit of <â5Â Î¼g/L in breast milk suggested by World Health Organization (WHO). Hg levels in 54% of the breast milk samples were higher than the normal mean concentration (1.7Â Î¼g/L) suggested by WHO. We found no correlation between Hg levels in breast milk and sociodemographic factors. Ba levels in all the breast milk samples were lower than the WHO's proposed health-based drinking water guideline (0.7Â mg/L). Considering the results of the present study and the vulnerability of infants, along with the well-known toxicity of these metals, further studies are warranted to identify the main sources of exposure that contribute their concentration in breast milk, establish harmless intake values of toxic metals in breast milk, and develop preventive measures.\n\nInvestigation of dust storms entering Western Iran using remotely sensed data and synoptic analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoloorani, Ali D; Nabavi, Seyed O; Bahrami, Hosain A; Mirzapour, Fardin; Kavosi, Musa; Abasi, Esmail; Azizi, Rasoul\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOne of the natural phenomena which have had considerable impacts on various regions of the world, including Iran, is \"dust storm\". In recent years, this phenomenon has taken on new dimensions in Iran and has changed from a local problem to a national issue. This study is an attempt to investigate the formation of the dust storms crossing the Western Iran. To find the sources of the dust storms entering Iran, first we examine three determined dust paths in the region and their temporal activities, using MODIS satellite images. Then, four regions were identified as dust sources through soil, land cover and wind data. Finally, atmospheric analyses are implemented to find synoptic patterns inducing dust storms. Source 1 has covered the region between the eastern banks of Euphrates and western banks of Tigris. Source 2 is in desert area of western and south-western Iraq. Finally source 3 is bounded in eastern and south-eastern deserts of Saudi Arabia called Rub-Al-Khali desert, or Empty Quarter. Moreover, south-eastern part of Iraq (source 4) was also determined as a secondary source which thickens the dust masses originating from the above mentioned sources. The study of synoptic circulations suggests that the dust storms originating from source 1 are formed due to the intense pressure gradient between the low-pressure system of Zagros and a high-pressure cell formed on Mediterranean Sea. The dust events in sources 2 and 3 are outcomes of the atmospheric circulations dominant in the cold period of the year in mid-latitudes.\n\nLifestyle of the Employees Working in Hamadan Public Sectors: Application of the Trans-Theoretical Model\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdi, Jalal; Eftekhar, Hassan; Mahmoodi, Mahmood; Shojaeizade, Davod; Sadeghi, Roya\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: A healthy lifestyle is a valuable source to reduce the prevalence of health problems, and promoteehealth. Objectives: The current study aimed to evaluate the lifestyle and obesity status of Hamadan public employees and their status based on the trans-theoretical model (TTM). Patients and Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was performed in 2014 on 1200 public employees in Hamadan city, Iran selected through proportional stratified random sampling. Data collection was performed using a three-section questionnaire including demographic characteristics, The FANTASTIC lifestyle questionnaire, and the five-part algorithm. Data were analyzed by SPSS-20 using linear regression, Chi-square, Fisher exact test, and ANOVA. Results: The mean age of the employees was 38.12 Â± 8.04 years. Most of the employees (61.7%) had favorable lifestyle. About half of the employees were at the preparation stage of TTM. Most of the employees were in a poor condition regarding the physical activity and healthy eating habits. In most of the evaluated items, females got higher scores than males. The associations between lifestyle and age, gender, work experience, income satisfaction, and marital status were significant. Moreover, the associations between obesity and work experience, marital status, number of offspring, and gender were significant (P < 0. 05). Significant predicting variables of obesity were age and work experience; they explained 31.2% variance of obesity (adjusted R2 = 0.312, R2 change = 0.01). Conclusions: Planning health education interventions for employees through effective approaches seems necessary.

Given the key role of employees as valuable human resources and increasing sedentary life style among them, the aim of this study was to evaluate physical activity status and position of governmental employees in changing stage based on the Trans-Theoretical Model (TTM) in Hamadan, Iran, in 2014.This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 1200 government employees selected using proportional stratified random sampling. Data collection was performed using a three-section questionnaire containing demographic characteristics, SQUASH (Short questionnaire to assess health-enhancing physical activity) questionnaire and Marcus et al's five-part algoritm. Data were analyzed by multiple linear and logistic regression, Chi-square, T-test and ANOVA using SPSS-20. The mean age of the participants was 38.12Â±8.04 years. About a half of the employees were in the preparatory stage of TTM.49.2% and 50.8% of the sample were classified as active and inactive, respectively .Associations between physical activity status and exercise stage of change were found. The associations between exercise stage of change and age, sex, work experience, education and marital status were significant (p<0.05). Work experience and education were strongly predictors of physical activity (PA) status and accounted for 31.2% of variance in PA (adjusted R2=0.312, R2 change=0.01). The results of this study showed that TTM was useful to evaluate and predict physical activity behavior among the Iranian governmental employees and can be utilized by health planners to inform appropriate intervention strategies, specifically in work place.\n\nA newly emerged focus of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in South-western Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nAskari, A; Sharifi, I; Aflatoonian, M R; Babaei, Z; Ghasemi Nejad Almani, P; Mohammadi, M A; Alizadeh, H; Hemati, S; Bamorovat, M\n\n2018-04-27\n\nLeishmaniasis is rising in many countries, including Iran, due to climate change, refugee crises, urbanization and etc. The aim of this study was to explore the epidemiology, extent and identity of Leishmania species in a newly emerged focus in Abdanan County, Ilam Province, South-western Iran. This study was performed as a descriptive cross-sectional study by a systematic house-to-house approach. The Leishmania species was identified by RFLP-PCR and sequencing. Altogether, 46799 individuals consisting 0f 22907 (48.9) female and 23892 (51.1%) male were interviewed and physically examined for the presence of skin lesions. Overall, the incidence rate was 0.34% (nâ¯=â¯160). All age groups were affected and the incidence rate was the highest in <10 years of age group (0.49%) and the lowest in >50 years old individuals (0.15%), although there was no significant difference regarding the sex and age. The majority of patients had one lesion (47.5%) on hands (56%) and most of the cases occurred in Abdanan city (%54) in summer. Based on the RFLP-PCR analysis, all the Leishmania isolates were L. major of single genotype. A newly emerged focus of zoonotic CL caused by L. major occurred in South-western of Iran. Multiple risk factors created this epidemic area. Further studies on the vector and reservoir are crucial needed to provide evidences to select the prophylactic and therapeutic measures for future control strategies. Copyright Â© 2018.

The goal of the present study was assessment of the effectiveness of coping skills education program to reduce craving beliefs among opium addicts. Methods In a randomized controlled trial, during September 2011 to August 2012, 70 opium addicted men referred to the Behavioral Disorders and Substance Abuse Research Center in Hamadan, western Iran were assigned to intervention group (receiving coping skills education program) and control groups. The study information was analyzed using SPSS software. Results Regarding craving beliefs for continuing drug use, the two groups had similar scales at the beginning of interventional program, while the level of these beliefs was significantly reduced in the intervention group (P= 0.002), but not in the control group (P= 0.105). Also, a significant correlation was also revealed between taking advantage of the educational program and increase awareness of the signs of relapse in the intervention group (P=0.003) that was not revealed in the control (P= 0.174). On the other hand, executing coping skills education program led to reducecraving beliefs and improve knowledge towards signs of relapse. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate positive impact of coping skills education program after detoxification process on decrease of craving beliefs among opium addicts.

Postpartum depression (PPD) is considered as one of the mood disturbances occurring during 2-3 months after delivery. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of PPD and its associated risk factors in border city of Ilam, western Iran. Methods. Through a descriptive cross-sectional study in 2011, overall, 197 women who attended Obstetrics & Gynecology clinics postpartumly in the border city of Ilam, western Iran, were randomly recruited. A standard questionnaire that was completed by a trained midwife through face to face interviews was used for data gathering. Results. Mean age Â± standard deviations was 27.9 Â± 5.2 years. Prevalence of PPD was estimated to be 34.8% (95% CI: 27.7-41.7). A significant difference was observed among depression scores before and after delivery (P â¤ 0.001). Type of delivery (P = 0.044), low socioeconomic status (P = 0.011), and women having low educational level (P = 0.009) were the most important significant risk factors associated with PPD. The regression analysis showed that employed mothers compared to housekeepers were more at risk for PPD (adjusted OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22-2.28, P = 0.003). Conclusions. Prevalence of PPD in western Iran was slightly higher than the corresponding rate from either national or international reports.\n\nSeroepidemiological survey of Q fever and brucellosis in Kurdistan Province, western Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nEsmaeili, Saber; Pourhossein, Behzad; Gouya, Mohammad Mehdi; Amiri, Fahimeh Bagheri; Mostafavi, Ehsan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGiven that the there is little information about the current status of brucellosis and Q fever in most parts of Iran, the aim of this study was to assay the seroprevalence of these two diseases in high-risk populations of Kurdistan Province in western Iran. Two hundred fifty sera samples were collected from hunters and their families, butchers, health care workers, and those referred to medical diagnostic laboratories in the southwestern regions of Kurdistan Province. Sera were tested to detect specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against brucellosis and Coxiella burnetii (phase I and II). The seroprevalence of brucellosis and Q fever (C. burnetii IgG phase I and II) was 6.4% and 27.83% (20% and 14.52%), respectively. The highest seroprevalence of Q fever (38%) and brucellosis (12%) was seen in butchers, who handled cattle, sheep, and goats during their work. Age had a significant positive association with Q fever seropositivity (p=0.04). The seroprevalence of Q fever was higher in those people who had been in employment for more than 10 years (21.88%) compared to others (7.79%) (p=0.02). The keeping of animals (p=0.03), hunting and eating the meat of wild animals (p=0.02), and not disinfecting hands and faces after working (for health care workers and butchers) (p=0.02) were risk factors for Q fever seropositivity. This study showed a relatively high seroprevalence of brucellosis and Q fever in high-risk populations of Kurdistan Province. It is suggested that complementary studies be carried out in other parts of western Iran to clarify the epidemiological aspects of these diseases.\n\nSocioeconomic, Psychiatric and Materiality Determinants and Risk of Postpartum Depression in Border City of Ilam, Western Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTaherifard, Pegah; Delpisheh, Ali; Shirali, Ramin; Afkhamzadeh, Abdorrahim; Veisani, Yousef\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground.

Type of delivery (P = 0.044), low socioeconomic status (P = 0.011), and women having low educational level (P = 0.009) were the most important significant risk factors associated with PPD. The regression analysis showed that employed mothers compared to housekeepers were more at risk for PPD (adjusted OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22â2.28, P = 0.003). Conclusions. Prevalence of PPD in western Iran was slightly higher than the corresponding rate from either national or international reports.

The aim of this study was to carry out a survey of tularemia among different groups in the province of Kurdistan in western Iran. The following information was collected by means of an in-house questionnaire: participant demographic characteristics, exposure to risks, and use of appropriate personal protective equipment and disinfectant in their occupation. A blood sample was collected from each participant. Sera were tested using an ELISA kit (Virion\\\\Serion) to detect specific IgG antibodies against Francisella tularensis. Of a total of 250 serum samples, 14.40% had anti-tularemia IgG antibodies. The highest seroprevalence was found in hunters (18%) and the lowest in health care workers (12%). Age had a significant positive association with tularemia seroprevalence (p<0.001). The seroprevalence of tularemia in people exposed to foxes (hunting or eating the meat) (25%) was significantly higher than in others (8.65%) (p = 0.01). According to the findings of this study, it is highly recommended that physicians and health care workers are informed about bacteria circulating in this area. By sensitizing the health system, it is expected that some cases of the clinical disease will be reported in the near future. Similar studies in other parts of the country and on domestic and wild animals will clarify the epidemiology of tularemia in Iran. Copyright Â© 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Pregnancy is an important condition for improving nutritional knowledge. The present study aimed at determining effects of nutrition education on levels of nutritional awareness of a representative group of pregnant women in Western Iran. A quasi-experimental intervention was undertaken on a random sample of pregnant women (n = 100) attending urban health centers in Ilam city (western Iran) during the year 2011 for prenatal care. A nutritional education program containing two to four lessons was undertaken for small groups of between six to ten women. Nutritional knowledge was assessed before intervention (pretest) and followed by two posttests within three weeks interval. The awareness level of pregnant women about healthy nutrition was significantly increased from 3% before intervention to 31% after the nutritional education intervention (P < 0.001). This significant difference was independent from maternal characteristics of age and levels of literacy and in obese mothers in particular. A nutritional education intervention will have a positive effect on nutritional awareness of pregnant women.\n\nSeroprevalence of toxocariasis in hypereosinophilic individuals in Ahwaz, south-western Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaraghi, S; Rafiei, A; Hajihossein, R; Sadjjadi, S M\n\n2012-06-01\n\nEosinophilia in human peripheral blood is caused by different agents, including toxocariasis. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of toxocariasis in hypereosinophilic individuals in the city of Ahwaz, located in south-western Iran, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot techniques. Serum samples were examined from 100 individuals with peripheral blood eosinophilia and also from another 100 individuals without eosinophilia as the control group. In hypereosinophilic individuals seroprevalence antibodies against Toxocara were found in 19 (19%), of whom 12 (63.15%) were female and 7 (36.85%) were male. Positive sera were subsequently confirmed by Western blot. All of the observed bands ranged from 24 to 100Â kDa. Antibodies against Toxocara were found in 1% of the control group, but were not confirmed by Western blot. The results showed significant differences between the frequency of infection within age and gender (PÂ <Â 0.05); the highest prevalence of infection was observed in adults. Differences between the hypereosinophilic and healthy individuals, in terms of Toxocara infection frequency, also proved significant (PÂ <Â 0.05).The present study thus confirmed the significant prevalence of toxocariasis as a hygienic problem among hypereosinophilic individuals in this area. It is, therefore, necessary to examine these individuals for toxocariasis.\n\nEffects of Nutrition Education on Levels of Nutritional Awareness of Pregnant Women in Western Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFallah, Farnoush; Pourabbas, Ahmad; Delpisheh, Ali; Veisani, Yousef; Shadnoush, Mahdi\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Maternal nutritional health, before and during pregnancy, influences the health status of herself and her developing fetus.

As a drought prone area in the Middle East, Iran has currently launched a crisis management approach to mitigate the harmful impacts of drought. However, thus far studies indicate that effective drought management strategies should be designed based upon vulnerability management which can increase farmers' ability to challenge the impacts. The purpose of this study was to assess drought vulnerability across three drought intensities (very high, extremely high, and critical) areas in Western Iran. Accordingly, a survey study was applied and 370 wheat farmers who all experienced drought during 2007-2009 were selected through a multi-stage stratified random sampling method. Face to face interviews were used to collect data on vulnerability indices from the farmers. Me-Bar and Valdez's vulnerability formula was applied to assess the vulnerability of wheat farmers during drought. Results revealed that the farmers' vulnerability is influenced mainly by economic, socio-cultural, psychological, technical, and infrastructural factors. The results also indicated that the farmers in Sarpole-Zahab township were most vulnerable compared to those in the Kermanshah township as the least vulnerable. Accordingly, some conclusions and recommendations are drawn for both policy-makers and practitioners who often must prioritize limited resources in the design vulnerability-reducing interventions.\n\nA Field Study of Plague and Tularemia in Rodents, Western Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nMostafavi, Ehsan; Shahraki, Abdolrazagh Hashemi; Japoni-Nejad, Alireza; Esmaeili, Saber; Darvish, Jamshid; Sedaghat, Mohammad Mehdi; Mohammadi, Ali; Mohammadi, Zeinolabedin; Mahmoudi, Ahmad; Pourhossein, Behzad; Ghasemi, Ahmad; Gyuranecz, MiklÃ³s; Carniel, Elisabeth\n\n2017-04-01\n\nKurdistan Province in Iran is a historical focus for plague and tularemia. This study aimed at assessing the current status of these two foci by studying their rodent reservoirs. Rodents were trapped and their ectoparasites were collected. The genus and species of both rodents and ectoparasites were determined. Serological analyses of rodent blood samples were done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for plague and by standard tube agglutination assay for tularemia. Rodent spleen samples were subjected to bacterial culture, microscopic examination, and real-time PCR to search for active plague or tularemia infection. During this study, 245 rodents were trapped, of which the most abundant genera were Apodemus (40%), Mus (24.49%), and Meriones (12.65%). One hundred fifty-three fleas, 37 mites, and 54 ticks were collected on these rodents. The results of all direct and indirect tests were negative for plague. Serological tests were positive for tularemia in 4.8% of trapped rodents. This study is the first report on the presence of tularemia infection in rodents in Western Iran. Since Meriones persicus is a known reservoir for plague and tularemia, and this rodent carried plague and tularemia vectors in Marivan and Sanandaj districts, there is a real potential for the occurrence of these two diseases in this region.\n\nEpidemiological Study of Lumpy Skin Disease Outbreaks in North-western Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nSameea Yousefi, P; Mardani, K; Dalir-Naghadeh, B; Jalilzadeh-Amin, G\n\n2017-12-01\n\nLumpy skin disease (LSD) is a highly contagious transboundary disease of cattle with major economic losses. This study was undertaken to address the emergence and epidemiological features of LSD in four north-western provinces of Iran. These provinces have extensive borders with others country including Iraq, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia. A population of 683 cattle from 91 farms were examined during LSD outbreak in Iran during 2014-2016. The information of the farms including the population size, gender, age, vaccination status, clinical signs and the number of death because of LSD were recorded in the designed questionnaires. A number of 234 blood samples were collected randomly from animals with and without clinical signs of LSD. DNA was extracted from blood samples, and they were used for amplifying a fragment of 434Â bp in size coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for molecular detection of lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). The estimated prevalence, cumulative mortality and case fatality were 17.9%, 3.5% and 19.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference in occurrence of the disease between male and female cattle. LSD occurrence in age groups above 5Â years old and below 6Â months old showed highest and lowest relative frequencies, respectively. Vaccination was significantly decreased the occurrence of clinical disease. The developed PCR-RFLP technique was able to differentiate between LSDV, sheep pox virus (ShPV) and goat pox virus (GPV). It was concluded that LSD was entered into Iran probably from Iraq via uncontrolled animal movements along common land borders between two countries. Developed PCR-RFLP could be used as a rapid and inexpensive method for differentiating Capripoxviruses (CaPVs).

A cross sectional study was carried out to determine knowledge on breast cancer and breast self- examination (BSE) practices of 384 females living in the city of Hamadan, Iran. A purposive sampling method was adopted and data were collected via face-to-face interviews based on a validated questionnaire developed for this study. Among respondents 268 (69.8%) were married and 144 (37.5%) of the respondents reported having a family history of breast cancer. One hundred respondents (26.0%) claimed they practiced BSE. Level of breast cancer knowledge was significantly associated with BSE practice (p=0.000). There was no association with demographic details (p<0.05). The findings showed that Iranian women's knowledge regarding breast cancer and the practice of BSE is inadequate. Targeted education should be implemented to improve early detection of breast cancer.\n\nCatastrophic Health Expenditure of Chronic Diseases: Evidence from Hamadan, Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRezapour, Aziz; Vahedi, Sajad; Khiavi, Farzad Faraji; Esmaeilzadeh, Firooz; Javan-Noughabi, Javad; Rajabi, Abdolhalim\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground: Chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) could increase the risk of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE). The present study aims to analyze CHE among households with and without chronic NCDs in Hamedan. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 780 householdsâ patients, who were being discharged from hospitals in Hamedan, were selected using a proportional stratified random sampling method. Required data were collected through interview and observation using World Health Organization standard questionnaire. A household with chronic NCDs is defined as the one with â¥1 chronic disease patient. Both descriptive and analytical statistics, as well as different approaches and thresholds, were used to study CHE among households. Results: The households with chronic disease had higher incidence and intensity of CHE in all approaches and threshold. This result was shown through distributive-sensitive measures. The Regression analysis revealed that lower economic status, lower household size, and high utilization of health care were associated with the CHE incidence and intensity in the households with chronic NCDs in Hamedan. Conclusions: There is a high degree of CHE were caused by chronic NCDs. By thoughtful reconsideration in health-care financing, along with addressing relevant socioeconomic factors, the health system of Iran could cope with financial adversities caused by chronic NCDs.

Although typically a self-limited disease, sandfly fever can cause significant morbidity and loss of function among soldiers. We conducted this study to determine the extent of past SFV infection in a group of healthy Iranian military personnel in Ilam province on the western border of Iran. A total of 201 serum samples were tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to detect four common sandfly fever virus serotypes. Demographic data were also collected. Overall, 37 samples (18.4%) were positive for specific IgG antibodies to sandfly viruses. Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) and sandfly fever Naples virus (SFNV) were the most common serotypes. A positive test was inversely related to nativity (P<0.01) but was not associated with age (P=0.163), duration of presence in the border region (P=0.08) or employment status (P=0.179). Our findings indicate that past SFV infection is common among military personnel in the western border region of Iran, a Leishmania-endemic region. Therefore, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of troops presenting with acute febrile illness in similar settings.

The medical communication between China and Iran dates back to the 10th century, however, according to current evidences, it is indicated that acupuncture has not been introduced to Iran until the early 1970s. Unfortunately over the last 40 years, the acupuncture in Iran has not presented great development. The history of acupuncture development in Iran implies that geographical advantage and personnel exchanges are not essential to the international exchange of acupuncture, while language and cultural background may hinder the spread of acupuncture in foreign countries.\n\nWife abuse prevalence and predisposing factors in women.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeif Rabiei, Ma; Nikooseresht, M\n\n2009-12-28\n\nSpouse abuse so called intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common problem in the world. This survey was conducted to identify IPV prevalence and related factors in district health centers in Hamadan, western Iran, in hope that, by identifying risk factors, preventive guidelines could be understood. In this descriptive analytic cross sectional study, 600 married women from six district health centers in Hamadan, western Iran were randomly enrolled in 2007. For gathering information we used a questionnaire which included demographic and specific questions about IPV, based on WHO guidelines. For increasing validity of results, questionnaires were nameless and participants were ensured about concealment of their identities. Finally data analyzed by SPSS software (version15). Wife abuse was identified in 34.2% of participants. For understanding IPV risk factors, we used logistic regression method and 27 variables were enrolled in the equation and finally 4 variables were statistically significant to wife abuse (P< 0.05). These variables were: weak religious believe of men, history of wife abuse in participant's mothers, men's criminal history and finally men's alcoholic abuse Wife abuse was prevalent in this survey, so that 1 from 3 women was abused by their husbands. Other similar investigations in different countries also verify this result. Because of so many women who disclaim violence due to cultural texture and religious believe, it is believed that, intimate partner violence is more than those being reported.\n\nTwo-year hospital records of burns from a referral center in Western Iran: March 2010-March 2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmadijouybari, Touraj; Najafi, Farid; Moradinazar, Mehdi; Karami-matin, Behzad; Karami-matin, Reza; Ataie, Maria; Hatami, Masoumeh; Purghorbani, Samira; Amee, Vahid\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBurns are among the most common injuries affecting a great number of people worldwide annually. In Iran, especially in its western region and in Kermanshah province, burns have a relatively high incidence. The present study was aimed at investigating epidemiological characteristics in Western Iran. Within a cross-sectional study, the data on all patients attending the Burns Center at Imam Khomeini Hospital (Kermanshah, Iran) during 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 (24 months) were collected. Then, age, gender, cause of burns, total body surface area, and time of the occurrence were extracted from the hospital records. The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical package (Version 19, for Windows). We used chi-squared test when we compared the categorical responses between two or more groups. For comparing means between two groups we used t-test. In addition, trends were investigated using linear regression. Overall 13,248 people were referred to the Burns Center at Imam Khomeini Hospital (Kermanshah, Iran) during the period of study, including 328 cases of self-immolation. The mean age of the patients was 27Â±19 years and 29Â±13 years for unintentional burns and self-immolation respectively. Out of the total number of unintentional cases, 6,519 (50.5%) were men, while the corresponding percentage of men among the self-immolation cases was 16.6% (p less than 0.001). Trends in the number of cases were cyclic, with the highest and lowest number of burns cases being in March and May. Overall, hot liquids and flammable materials were the two most important causes of unintentional burns. However, flammable materials were the main cause of burns among self-immolation cases. During hospital admission, 168 (51%) self-immolation victims and 43 (0.33%) unintentional burn victims died. While major preventive measures are not adequately used in developing countries, burns and their burden can be significantly reduced by increasing public awareness and by applying simple preventive\n\nEpidemiological characteristics of human brucellosis in Hamadan Province during 2009-2015: results from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.\n\nPubMed\n\nNematollahi, Shahrzad; Ayubi, Erfan; Karami, Manoochehr; Khazaei, Salman; Shojaeian, Masoud; Zamani, Reza; Mansori, Kamyar; Gholamaliee, Behzad\n\n2017-08-01\n\nHuman brucellosis and recurrent brucellosis is an ever-increasing public health concern, especially in endemic areas like Iran. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the epidemiology and determinants of recurrent brucellosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate epidemiological patterns and potential determinants of recurrent brucellosis in Hamadan Province during the years 2009-2015. Data on reported cases of new and recurrent brucellosis from 2009 to 2015 were obtained from the provincial Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. Incidence rates per 100000 were estimated at the county level. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of background characteristics and recurrent brucellosis. The power of discrimination of the model for recurrent brucellosis was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). Among 7318 brucellosis cases, the total frequency (%) of recurrent cases was 472 (6.45%). The rate of recurrent brucellosis was higher in females, people aged 50 years and over, people with a history of consuming unpasteurized dairy products with no history of contact with animals, and in the winter season. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female sex (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.65), age â¥55 years (AOR 4.15, 95% CI 2.32-7.42), consumption of unpasteurized dairy products (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96-1.40), and winter season (AOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.71) are potential risk factors for recurrent brucellosis. The final model that involved all the determinants showed moderate discrimination (AUC 0.61). Female sex, older age, and winter months were found to be significant determinants of recurrent human brucellosis. Enhanced surveillance systems with an emphasis on these population characteristics will allow effective preventive and protective measures to be implemented and might alleviate the recurrence of brucellosis in the\n\nNew insights into the active deformation of accretionary prisms: examples from the Western Makran, Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPenney, Camilla; Copley, Alex; Oveisi, Benham\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Makran subduction zone, along the southern coasts of Iran and Pakistan, hosts one of the largest exposed accretionary wedges in the world. The western Makran has been characterised by a lack of shallow and thrust seismicity in both the instrumental and historical periods. The Mw 6.1 2013 Minab earthquake thus provides a rare opportunity to study the deformation of the accretionary wedge in the transition region between continent-continent collision, in the Zagros, and oceanic subduction, in the Makran. We study the source parameters and slip distribution of this earthquake using seismology, geodesy and field observations. We observe left-lateral strike-slip motion on a fault striking ENE-WSW; approximately perpendicular to the faults of the Minab-Zendan-Palami fault zone, the main structure previously thought to accommodate the right-lateral shear between the Zagros and the Makran. The fault that ruptured in 2013 is one of a series of approximately E-W striking left-lateral faults visible in the geology and geomorphology. These accommodate a velocity field equivalent to right-lateral shear on N-S striking planes by clockwise rotations about vertical axes. The longitudinal range of shear in the western Makran is likely to be controlled by the distance over which the underthrusting Arabian lithosphere deepens in the transition from continent-continent collision to oceanic subduction. The lack of observed megathrust seismicity in the western Makran has led to assertions that the convergence in this region may be aseismic, in contrast to the eastern Makran, which experienced an Mw8.1 earthquake in 1945. The right-lateral Sistan Suture Zone, which runs ~N-S along the Iran-Afghanistan border to the north of the Makran, appears to separate these regimes. However, right-lateral faulting is not observed south of ~27Â°N, within the wedge. The Minab earthquake and the 2013 Balochistan earthquake show that the Makran accretionary wedge is dominated by strike-slip faulting\n\nEarly Pleistocene Climate in Western Arid Central Asia Inferred from Loess-Palaeosol Sequences in North Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, X.; Wei, H.; Khormali, F.; Taheri, M.; Danukalova, G.; Chen, F.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nArid central Asia (ACA) is one of the most arid regions in the mid-latitudes and one of the main potential dust sources for the northern hemisphere. The relatively weak study of Pleistocene loess/dust records from in situ ACA hinders our comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal record of aeolian loess accumulation and long term climatic changes in Asia as a whole. The northern Iran is located in the westernmost part of ACA. The precipitation here is mainly influenced by the zonal Westerlies, while the dust is mainly transported by regional westerly and northwest-northeasterly winds. Previous loess study in northern Iran demonstrate that most of the loess deposits in this region accumulated during the middle to late Pleistocene, and that the palaeosol and loess layers formed during interglacial and glacial periods, respectively. However, the Early Pleistocene loess and paleoclimate history in this key region remains porely constraints. In this work we focus on the chronology, sedimentology, and paleoclimatic records of the early Pleistocene loess-paleosol sequence in north Iran. Multi-sedimentological evidence suggests the widely distributed red-coloured silt-dominated sediments, unconformably underlying the upper Pleistocene loess successions, in north Iran are aeolian in origin. The dominance of the coarse dust component in the loess samples suggests the main body of the Iranian loess was transported predominantly by the local low-level winds from proximal source regions. Magnetostratigraphy with biostratigraphic age constraints indiciate the red-colored loess accumulated between 2.4 and 1.81 Ma, an equivalent of the Wucheng formation on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Paleoclimatic proxy incies and micromorphological evidence reveals that the climate during the early Pleistocene in the western ACA was semi-arid, but wetter, warmer, and less windy than during the late Pleistocene and present interglacial.

In Iran a great number of work-related injuries are occurred in construction industry. However, less than 12% of total workers are active in the construction sector. This study aimed to determine the incidence rate of work-related injuries, the type of injuries, and its other determinants among the construction workers of Ilam (Iran). The participants were the workers and staffs working in the construction activities of Ilam in Western Iran. All the recorded injuries and deaths related to the construction workers of Ilam from 2006-2009 were collected from the Bureau of Labor and Social Affairs and then analyzed by the statistical package of SPSS (version 19, for Windows). During 2006 - 2009 in Ilam, 387workers encountered the building accidents. Their mean age was 34.3 years (SD = 12.4). The average annual incidence of work-related injuries among the workers was 8.2 per 1000 workers. Fracture with 275 cases (71%) was the most common outcome of injuries, and slipping and falling with 77 cases (36%) were the most important events and exposures. The most important factor related to injuries was the lack of surveillance by employers which was also related with the severity of accident-induced injuries (P < 0.004). Considering the effectiveness of the relevant preventive measures activities such as training the workers as well as using safety tools and more surveillance by employers can decrease the number of work-related injuries among constructive workers.\n\nGenetic Epidemiology, Hematological and Clinical Features of Hemoglobinopathies in Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRahimi, Zohreh\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThere is large variation in the molecular genetics and clinical features of hemoglobinopathies in Iran. Studying structural variants of hemoglobin demonstrated that the Î²-chain variants of hemoglobin S and D-Punjab are more prevalent in the Fars (southwestern Iran) and Kermanshah (western Iran) provinces, respectively. Also, Î±-chain variants of Hb Q-Iran and Hb Setif are prevalent in western Iran. The molecular basis and clinical severity of thalassemias are extremely heterogenous among Iranians due to the presence of multiethnic groups in the country. Î²-Thalassemia is more prevalent in northern and southern Iran. Among 52 different Î²-thalassemia mutations that have been identified among Iranian populations, IVSII-1 G:A is the most frequent mutation in most parts of the country. The presence of IVS I-5 G:C mutation with high frequency in southeastern Iran might reflect gene flow from neighboring countries. A wide spectrum of Î±-thalassemia alleles has been detected among Iranians with âÎ± 3.7âkb as the most prevalent Î±-thalassemia mutation. The prevention program of thalassemia birth in Iran has reduced the birth rate of homozygous Î²-thalassemia since the implementation of the program in 1997. In this review genetic epidemiology, clinical and hematological aspects of hemoglobinopathies, and the prevention programs of Î²-thalassemia in Iran will be discussed.

The participants of the study are faculty members,â¦\n\nSpatial Analysis of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMostafavi, Ehsan; Haghdoost, AliAkbar; Khakifirouz, Sahar; Chinikar, Sadegh\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCrimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral zoonotic disease. During 1999â2011, 871 human cases of CCHF were diagnosed in Iran. A history of serologic conversion for CCHF virus was seen in 58.7% of 2,447 sheep samples, 25.0% of 1,091 cattle samples and 24.8% of 987 goat samples from different parts of Iran. Spatial analysis showed that the main foci of this disease in humans during these years were in eastern Iran (P < 0.01) and the second most common foci were in northeastern and central Iran. Two livestock foci were detected in the northeastern northwestern Iran. On the basis of the results of this study, infection likely entered Iran from eastern and western neighboring countries.

The agreement called for a Russian VVER-1000/320 pressurized water reactor (PWR) to be successfully installed into the existing German-built BNPP facilities in 5 yr. System design differences, bomb damage, and environmental exposure are key issues with which Minatom must contend in order to fulfill the contract. The AEOI under the Shah of Iran envisioned Bushehr as the first of many nuclear power plants, with IranmoreÂ Â» achieving 24 GW(electric) by 1993 and 34 GW(electric) by 2000. Kraftwerk Union AG (KWU) began construction of the two-unit plant near the Persian Gulf town of Halileh in 1975. Unit 1 was {approx}80% complete and unit 2 was {approx}50% complete when construction was interrupted by the 1979 Iranian Islamic revolution. Despite repeated AEOI attempts to lure KWU and other companies back to Iran to complete the plant, Western concerns about nuclear proliferation in Iran and repeated bombings of the plant during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war dissuaded Germany from resuming construction.Â«Â less\n\nExhumation of the Deylaman fault trend and its effects on the deformation style of the western Alborz belt in Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHakimi Asiabar, Saeid; Bagheriyan, Siyamak\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe Alborz range in northern Iran stretches along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea and finally runs northeast and merges into the Pamir mountains in Afghanistan. Alborz mountain belt is a doubly vergent orogen formed along the northern edge of the Iranian plateau in response to the closure of the Neo-Tethys ocean and continental collision between Arabia and Eurasia. The south Caspian depressionâthe Alborz basin of Mesozoic age (with W-E trend) in northern Iranâinverted in response to the Arabia-Eurasia collision. Pre-existing extensional faults of the south Caspian-Alborz system preferentially reactivated as contractional faults because of tectonic inversion. These contractional structures tend to run parallel to the trends of pre-existing extension"
