Bita's mother was involved in artistic activities in the 1930s and performed on theater stages, while her father produced cultural and artistic programs for Radio Tehran.\n\nIn 1973, Bita Farahi married Hassan Ghoreishy, the head of Keyhan Publications. She won the Miss World Award in 1973. In 1978, Bita Farahi went to the United States to continue her studies, attending the John Robert Powers School in California. She returned to Iran in 1981.\n\nNaser Cheshmazar introduced her to Dariush Mehrjui for the role of Mahshid in the film \"Hamoun\" (1989), marking Bita Farahi's debut in acting at the age of 31. Her performance in \"Hamoun\" earned her the Diploma of Honor for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the 8th Fajr Film Festival. In the following years, Farahi continued her career with directors such as Ahmad Reza Darvish, Bahman Farmanara, Masoud Kimiai, and Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, receiving nominations for the Crystal Simorgh Award for her roles in \"Kimia\" (1994), \"A House on Water\" (2001), and \"Blood Play\" (2006)."
