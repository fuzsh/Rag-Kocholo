Previous research on alteration, mineralization and hydrothermal fluids indicates that a Cu-Mo porphyry type mineralization system is related with these intrusives (Arjmandzadeh et al., 2012). The rocks studied in this work range in composition from gabbro-diorite to granite, with dominance of monzonites and quartz monzonites, and have geochemical features of high-K calc alkaline to shoshonitic volcanic arc suites. The trends of major element oxides on Harker diagrams, together with textural evidence, point to the crystal fractionation of clinopyroxene, Ca - plagioclase, hornblende, apatite and oxide minerals. Primitive mantle - normalized trace element spider diagrams display strong enrichment in LILE, such as Rb, Ba and Cs, and depletions in some high field strength elements (HFSE), such as Nb, Ti, Y and HREE. Chondrite-normalized plots show significant LREE enrichments, high LaN/YbN (21.5 to 31.0) and the lack of Eu anomaly. Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios of Dehsalm intrusives are respectively 31.6-72.2 and 21.5-33.5, which reveals that, despite their K-rich composition, these rocks also have some adakitic affinity. A Rb-Sr whole rock-feldspar-biotite age of 33.4Â±1 Ma was obtained in a quartz monzonite sample; this date may be interpreted as close to the intrusion age, considering that the chosen sample is almost unaltered and should have suffered fast cooling. The obtained age coincides, within error, with a previous geochronological result in a similar rock from the Chah-Shaljami area (Arjmandzadeh et al., 2011), further northwest along the eastern border of the Lut Block. 87Sr/86Sr(33Ma) and ÉNd(33Ma) values range from 0.70481 to 0.70508 and from +1.5 to +2.5, respectively, which fits into a supra-subduction mantle wedge source for the parental melts and indicates that crustal contribution for magma diversification was not relevant.

It was divided by Tirrul et al. (1983) in five main units: the Lut (1) and Afghan (2) continental blocks where basement is exposed; the Neh (3) and Ratuk (4) complexes which display ophiolitic rocks weakly and highly (HP-BT) metamorphosed, respectively, and the Sefidabeh basin lying over these complexes and interpreted as a fore-arc basin. Sistan is bordered by the Makran and Zagros (formed by the closure of the Neo-Tethys) to the south and by the Kopet Dagh (formed by the closure of Paleo-Tethys) to the North. The aim of this study is to fill the gap between preliminary studies about the overall structure of the Sistan Suture Zone and recent investigations of active tectonics in the region (e.g., Walker et al., 2004 and 2006 a and b). Questions herein addressed are: (1) how are stresses transfered throughout Iran from the Zagros to the Sistan belts? (2) Did the Zagros, Makran and Sistan belts evolve independently through time, or were they mechanically coupled? In order to answer these questions, we have determined paleostress evolution in the Sistan, using a direct inversion method for 42 microtectonic sites in almost all lithologies of the Neh complex and the Sefidabeh basin. We find three successive directions of compression: (1) 87Â°N for the oldest deformation stage dated of the Late Miocene, (2) 59Â°N for the intermediate stage probably dated of the Early Pliocene, and (3) 26Â°N for the youngest stage dated of the Plio-Quaternary. A counterclockwise rotation of about 60Â° of the main stress (Ï1) in less than 10 Ma is therefore documented in Sistan. These same three stages of deformation were also documented by several microtectonic studies in Iran, especially in Makran and Zagros. The direction of the youngest compression is very homogeneous indicating that the mountain belts and continental blocks of Iran\n\nPetrogenesis of Neogene basaltic volcanism associated with the Lut block, eastern Iran: Implication for tectonic and metallogenic evolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaadat, Saeed\n\nThis dissertation presents petrochemical data concerning Neogene olivine basalts erupted both along the margins and within the micro-continental Lut block, eastern Iran, which is a part of the active Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. These data demonstrate the following: (1) Basalts that erupted from small monogenetic parasitic cones around the Bazman stratovolcano, Makran arc area, in the southern Lut block, are low-Ti sub-alkaline olivine basalts. Enrichments of LILE relative to LREE, and depletions in Nb and Ta relatively to LILE, are similar to those observed for other convergent plate boundary arc magmas around the world and suggest that these basalts formed by melting of subcontinental mantle modified by dehydration of the subducted Oman Sea oceanic lithosphere. (2) Northeast of Iran, an isolated outcrop of Neogene/Quaternary alkali olivine basalt, containing mantle and crustal xenoliths, formed by mixing of small melt fractions from both garnet and spinel-facies mantle. These melts rose to the surface along localized pathways associated with extension at the junction between the N-S right-lateral strike-slip faults and E-W left-lateral strike slip faults. The spinel-peridotite mantle xenoliths contained in the basalts, which equilibrated in the subcontinental lithosphere at depths of 30 to 60 km and temperatures of 965Â°C to 1065Â°C, do not preserve evidence of extensive metasomatic enrichment as has been inferred for the mantle below the Damavand volcano further to the west in north-central Iran. (3) Neogene mafic rocks within the central Lut block represent the last manifestation of a much more extensive mid-Tertiary magmatic event. These basalts formed from both OIB-like asthenosphere and subcontinental lithosphere which preserved chemical characteristics inherited from mid-Tertiary subduction associated with the collision of the Arabian with the Eurasian plate and closing of the Neotethys Ocean. Neogene/Quternary alkali olivine basalts erupted mainly along\n\nNew insights on the recent and current deformation in Central-Eastern Iran, derived from a combined tectonic and GPS analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWalpersdorf, A.; Manighetti, I.; Tavakoli, F.; Mousavi, Z.; Vergnolle, M.; Jadidi, A.; Hatzfeld, D.; Aghamohammadi, A.; Djamour, Y.; Nankali, H.; Sedighi, M.; Lutz, L.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nWe have studied the recent to current deformation in Iran and especially Central-Eastern Iran by tightly combining tectonic and GPS analyses. Based on morphotectonic analyses of satellite images, we have identified and mapped the major active faults that dissect the entire â 4500 km x 2500 km2 region that extends from Eastern Turkey to Western Afghanistan/Pakistan and hence encompasses Iran, emphasizing their large-scale organization and kinematic relationships. Doing so, we have identified the major fault systems that control the tectonics of Iran, especially in its central-eastern part. We have also analyzed the 11 years GPS record on the 92 stations deployed in central-eastern Iran in the framework of the Iranian-French collaboration. The GPS analysis reveals that all major faults identified as seismogenic in central-eastern Iran are indeed currently active and slipping at fast rates. The northerly-trending East Lut, West Lut, Kuhbanan, Anar and Deshir faults have a current right-lateral slip rate of 5.7 Â± 0.9, 4.7 Â± 1.7, 2.3 Â± 1.9, 2.7 Â± 1.3 and 0.5 Â± 0.2 mm/yr, respectively, while the â EW-trending Doruneh and Sedeh faults have a left-lateral current slip rate of 3.1 Â± 1.8 and 1.7 Â± 0.2 mm/yr, respectively. The large regions bounded by the northerly-striking faults behave as fairly rigid blocks that are all found to move towards both the N13Â°E ARA-EUR convergence direction and the WNW, at fast rates, in the range 6.5-12.5 and 1-5 mm/yr, respectively. Combined with the available data on the studied faults, our tectonic and geodetic results suggest that a bookshelf faulting strain transfer mechanism has been and is still operating in central-eastern Iran. The coeval dextral motion of the two major, overlapping, North Anatolian-Main Recent and Caucasus-Kopeh Dagh-Herat fault lines that embrace central-eastern Iran, induces a large-scale regional sinistral shear on either side of the region, which forces the northerly-trending right-lateral faults and\n\nGeochronology of high-grade metamorphic rocks from the Anjul area, Lut block, eastern Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrÃ¶cker, Michael; Fotoohi Rad, Gholamreza; Abbaslu, Fateme; Rodionov, Nikolay\n\n2014-03-01\n\nU-Pb and Rb-Sr geochronology has been used to constrain robust ages for leucosomes and high-grade gneisses from the Anjul area in the eastern part of the Lut block, Iran. The new results do not support the previously suggested Proterozoic age for this occurrence, but instead reveal the importance of Jurassic and Cretaceous magmatic and/or metamorphic processes. Ionprobe U-Pb zircon dating yielded four age groups (>200, Ë168, Ë120 and Ë110 Ma). Textural observations suggest that ages >200 Ma represent inherited zircons. The majority of zircons yielded Jurassic (168 Â± 2 and 169 Â± 2 Ma) and Cretaceous (120 Â± 3, 108 Â± 2, 111 Â± 3 Ma) intercept ages. Explanations for the two dominant age groups (Ë168 and Ë110 Ma) include the following alternatives: (a) the Jurassic ages constrain the protolith age of magmatic precursors that experienced metamorphic overprinting at Ë110 Ma; and (b) both the Ë168 Ma and Ë110 Ma ages indicate the time of metamorphic episodes, e.g. zircon-formation during different anatectic events or migmatization followed by a lower temperature overprint associated with new zircon growth. Multi-point Rb-Sr mineral isochrons of three additional gneisses indicated ages of 102 Â± 3 Ma, 102 Â± 1 Ma and 97 Â± 2 Ma. These ages further document the importance of Cretaceous metamorphism in the Anjul area. The difference compared to the U-Pb ages of zircon overgrowths is interpreted to indicate cooling after a thermal event with or without partial melting. The two major occurrences of metamorphic rocks in the eastern Lut block are exposed in the Deh-Salm and the Anjul region. These occurrences may represent two different segments of a single metamorphic belt that can broadly be related to accretionary and/or collisional processes induced by convergence between the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian plates. Our geochronological study provides a conclusive evidence for Cretaceous metamorphism. We speculate that zircon overgrowths with Cretaceous ages reflect\n\nEvaluation Seismicity west of block-lut for Deterministic Seismic Hazard Assessment of Shahdad ,Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNey, B.; Askari, M.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nEvaluation Seismicity west of block-lut for Deterministic Seismic Hazard Assessment of Shahdad ,Iran Behnoosh Neyestani , Mina Askari Students of Science and Research University,Iran. Seismic Hazard Assessment has been done for Shahdad city in this study , and four maps (Kerman-Bam-Nakhil Ab-Allah Abad) has been prepared to indicate the Deterministic estimate of Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) in this area. Deterministic Seismic Hazard Assessment has been preformed for a region in eastern Iran (Shahdad) based on the available geological, seismological and geophysical information and seismic zoning map of region has been constructed. For this assessment first Seimotectonic map of study region in a radius of 100km is prepared using geological maps, distribution of historical and instrumental earthquake data and focal mechanism solutions it is used as the base map for delineation of potential seismic sources. After that minimum distance, for every seismic sources until site (Shahdad) and maximum magnitude for each source have been determined. In Shahdad ,according to results, peak ground acceleration using the Yoshimitsu Fukushima &Teiji Tanaka'1990 attenuation relationship is estimated to be 0.58 g, that is related to the movement of nayband fault with distance 2.4km of the site and maximum magnitude Ms=7.5.\n\n77 FR 6657 - Blocking Property of the Government of Iran and Iranian Financial Institutions\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-02-08\n\n...

MÃ©lange-like units are exceptionally well-exposed in the Sistan suture (Eastern Iran), which results from the closure of a branch of the Neotethys between the Lut and Afghan continental blocks. High pressure rocks found in the inner part of the suture zone (i.e., Ratuk complex) around Gazik are herein compared to previously studied outcrops along the belt. Detailed field investigations and mapping allow the distinction of two kinds of subduction-related block-in-matrix units: a siliciclastic-matrix complex and a serpentinite-matrix complex. The siliciclastic-matrix complex includes barely metamorphosed blocks of serpentinized peridotite, radiolarite and basalt of maximum greenschist-facies grade (i.e., maximum temperature of 340 Â°C). The serpentinite-matrix complex includes blocks of various grades and lithologies: mafic eclogites, amphibolitized blueschists, blue-amphibole-bearing metacherts and aegirine-augite-albite rocks. Eclogites reached peak pressure conditions around 530 Â°C and 2.3 GPa and isothermal retrogression down to 530 Â°C and 0.9 GPa. Estimation of peak PT conditions for the other rocks are less-well constrained but suggest equilibration at P < 1 GPa. Strikingly similar Ar-Ar ages of 86 Â± 3 Ma, along 70 km, are obtained for phengite and amphibole from fourteen eclogite and amphibolitized blueschist blocks. Ages in Gazik are usually younger than further south (e.g., Sulabest), but there is little age difference between the various kinds of rocks. These results (radiometric ages, observed structures and rock types) support a tectonic origin of the serpentinite-matrix mÃ©lange and shed light on subduction zone dynamics, particularly on coeval detachment and exhumation mechanisms of slab-derived rocks.\n\nStructural analysis and tectonic evolution of the eastern Binalud Mountains, NE Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSheikholeslami, M. R.; Kouhpeyma, M.\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe Binalud Mountains are situated in the south of the Kopeh Dagh as a transitional zone between the Alborz and Central Iran zones. The Palaeotethys suture of the north Iran is located in this area. The Binalud Mountains consists of relatively thick successions of sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks. The earliest deformation, a polyphase synmetamorphic deformation which occurred entirely in ductile conditions, is distinguished in the metamorphic rocks of the eastern part. D1, D2 and D3 deformation phases are related to this deformation. The D4 deformation affected the area after a period of sedimentation and erosion. The thrust faults of the central and southern part of the eastern Binalud were classified as structures related to the D5 tectonic event. From the geodynamic point of view, in Late Palaeozoic times the studied area formed an oceanic trench generated by the subduction of the Palaeotethys oceanic lithosphere beneath the Turan Plate. In the Late Triassic, the Early Cimmerian Event resulted in a collisional type orogeny generating a transpression polyphase deformation and the metamorphism of Permian and older sediments. Following this collision, granite intrusions were emplaced in the area and caused contact metamorphism. The exhumation and erosion of the rocks deformed and metamorphosed during Early Cimmerian Event caused the formation of molassic type sediments in a Rhaetian-Lias back arc basin. The continuation of convergence between the Turan and Iran Plates caused the metamorphism of these sediments and their transformation to phyllite and meta-sandstone. During Late Mesozoic and Early Cenozoic times, the convergence between Central Iran and Turan Plates continued and a NE compression caused folding of the Cretaceous and older rocks in the Kopeh Dagh area. In the Binalud area this deformation caused the generation of several thrust fault systems with S to SW vergence, resulting in a thrusting of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic successions on each other\n\nHeterogenity of Echinococcus canadensis genotype 6 - the main causative agent of cystic echinococcosis in Birjand, Eastern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaramian, Mehdi; Haghighi, Fatemeh; Hemmati, Mina; Taylor, Walter Robert; Salehabadi, Alireza; Ghatee, Mohammad Amin\n\n2017-10-15\n\nLittle is known about the genotypes of Echinococcus spp. and their life cycles in eastern Iran. We analysed the partial sequences of the nad1 and cox1 genes from 17 isolates from hydatid cyst-infected patients (n=9), camels (n=5) and sheep (n=3) in Birjand, eastern Iran. A new primer pair was also used to amplify the long fragment (1180bp) of the cox1 gene. All camel and eight human isolates were G6 strains of Echinococcus canadensis while one human isolate and the three sheep isolates were G1 genotypes (sheep strain) of E. granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.). Nad1 and cox1 sequence analyses showed high G6 genetic homogeneity, similar to previously reported G6 strains from southeast and central Iran, Sudan and Mauritania. Low nucleotide and haplotype diversity similar to G6 strains from Russia (Altai republic) and Kazakhstan was also found, consistent with a bottleneck effect. In this study, G6 was the most common Echinococcus genotype. Genetic homogeneity of east, southeast and central Iranian G6 and its low genetic diversity may be due limited mobility and contact between humans and camels from other regions because of large, inhospitable deserts.

Upper Albian and Cenomanian (Cretaceous) ammonites from the Debarsu Formation (Yazd Block, Central Iran). Acta Geologica Polonica, 63 (4), 489-513. Warszawa. New ammonite faunas consisting of 13 taxa provide the first reliable biostratigraphic dating of the Debarsu Formation of the Yazd Block, west-central Iran, indicating several levels in the Upper Albian and Lower Cenomanian, while a foraminiferal assemblage places the top of the Formation in the Middle Turonian. Among the identified ammonite taxa, Acompsoceras renevieri (Sharpe, 1857) is recorded from Iran for the first time. The upper part of the lower Upper Albian is proved by the occurrences of mortoniceratines of the Mortoniceras (M.) inflatum Zone in the lowermost part of the Debarsu Formation. For the upper Upper Albian (traditional Stoliczkaia dispar Zone), the M. (Subschloenbachia ) rostratum and M. (S.) perinflatum zones are proved by their index taxa. However, there is no evidence of the terminal Arrhaphoceras (Praeschloenbachia) briacensis Zone. The upper part of the lower Lower Cenomanian Mantelliceras mantelli Zone (M. saxbii Subzone) is proved by M. saxbii and M. cf. mantelli. Below, there is an ammonite- barren interval of ca. 100 m in thickness between M. (S.) perinflatum zonal strata and the M. saxbii Subzone. The upper Lower Cenomanian is documented by the presence of typically M. dixoni zonal ammonites such as Acompsoceras renevieri. Upper Cenomanian and Turonian ammonites have not been found in the upper part of the Debarsu Formation, but micro-biostratigraphic evidence (planktonic foraminifers) from the uppermost part of the formation indicate that the formation ranges into the Turonian. For the development of the major tectonic unconformity at the base of the overlying Haftoman Formation (which yielded Lower Coniacian inoceramids near its base), only 2-3 myr remain, stressing the geodynamic activity of Central Iran during\n\nOphiolites of Iran: Keys to understanding the tectonic evolution of SW Asia: (II) Mesozoic ophiolites\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoghadam, Hadi Shafaii; Stern, Robert J.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nIran is a mosaic of continental terranes of Cadomian (520-600 Ma) age, stitched together along sutures decorated by Paleozoic and Mesozoic ophiolites. Here we present the current understanding of the Mesozoic (and rare Cenozoic) ophiolites of Iran for the international geoscientific audience. We summarize field, chemical and geochronological data from the literature and our own unpublished data. Mesozoic ophiolites of Iran are mostly Cretaceous in age and are related to the Neotethys and associated backarc basins on the S flank of Eurasia. These ophiolites can be subdivided into five belts: 1. Late Cretaceous Zagros outer belt ophiolites (ZOB) along the Main Zagros Thrust including Late Cretaceous-Early Paleocene Maku-Khoy-Salmas ophiolites in NW Iran as well as Kermanshah-Kurdistan, Neyriz and Esfandagheh (Haji Abad) ophiolites, also Late Cretaceous-Eocene ophiolites along the Iraq-Iran border; 2. Late Cretaceous Zagros inner belt ophiolites (ZIB) including Nain, Dehshir, Shahr-e-Babak and Balvard-Baft ophiolites along the southern periphery of the Central Iranian block and bending north into it; 3. Late Cretaceous-Early Paleocene Sabzevar-Torbat-e-Heydarieh ophiolites of NE Iran; 4. Early to Late Cretaceous Birjand-Nehbandan-Tchehel-Kureh ophiolites in eastern Iran between the Lut and Afghan blocks; and 5. Late Jurassic-Cretaceous Makran ophiolites of SE Iran including Kahnuj ophiolites. Most Mesozoic ophiolites of Iran show supra-subduction zone (SSZ) geochemical signatures, indicating that SW Asia was a site of plate convergence during Late Mesozoic time, but also include a significant proportion showing ocean-island basalt affinities, perhaps indicating the involvement of subcontinental lithospheric mantle.\n\nSpatial Analysis of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMostafavi, Ehsan; Haghdoost, AliAkbar; Khakifirouz, Sahar; Chinikar, Sadegh\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCrimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral zoonotic disease. During 1999â2011, 871 human cases of CCHF were diagnosed in Iran. A history of serologic conversion for CCHF virus was seen in 58.7% of 2,447 sheep samples, 25.0% of 1,091 cattle samples and 24.8% of 987 goat samples from different parts of Iran. Spatial analysis showed that the main foci of this disease in humans during these years were in eastern Iran (P < 0.01) and the second most common foci were in northeastern and central Iran. Two livestock foci were detected in the northeastern northwestern Iran. On the basis of the results of this study, infection likely entered Iran from eastern and western neighboring countries.

In particular, the eastern part of the Eastern Alps is a key area which will provide both, information about the surface response to the Eocene/Oligocene slab breakoff and the response to a proposed isostatic rebound due to slab detachment of the European lithosphere in the Miocene (Handy et al., 2015). The eastern part of the Eastern Alps is characterized by fault-bounded blocks with different thermochronological ages, mean elevations and hillslope angles, indicating a variable spatial and temporal evolution throughout the Cenozoic era. The topographic pattern of the study area can be described in terms of (1) high relief with a rugged surface and steep slopes in the Niedere Tauern and (2) lower relief and distinctly smoother topography in the Seckauer Tauern, the Gurktal, Saualpe and Koralpe blocks. Generally, tectonic blocks with higher relief and rugged topography display the youngest apatite fission track (AFT) and apatite (U-Th)/He data (AHe); the Niedere Tauern concurs with middle Miocene AFT and late Miocene/Pliocene AHe ages (WÃ¶lfler et al., 2016). The other tectonic blocks generally show Eocene to Oligocene AFT ages (WÃ¶lfler et al., 2016 and references therein) and Oligocene to early Miocene AHe ages (Legrain et al., 2014, own preliminary work). New AFT and AHe data from the Gurktal block and Seckauer Tauern indicate that substantial parts of the study area where at near-surface conditions since the Eocene and Oligocene. Thermal history models suggest fast cooling through the AFT and AHe closure temperatures in the Oligocene as a possible response to slab breakoff that was followed by thermal stagnation until the present. In contrast, the neighboring Niedere Tauern experienced\n\nPaleo- and Neo-Tethyan ophiolites of Iran: a progress report\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGhazi, M.; Hassanipak, A.; Babaie, H.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nThe Bitlis-Zagros and Alborz stuture zones of Iran mark two collisional plate boundaries in the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt. The ophiolites of these zones together with the ophiolites of Makran accretionary prism and Central Iran form discontinuous linear belts of Tethyan oceanic fragments, which form a bridge between the Mediterranean and Himalayan ophiolites. Based on age alone these ophiolites have been divided into less abundant Paleozoic and much more abundant Mesozoic ophiolites. The Paleozoic ophiolites are located along the Alborz orogenic belt [i.e., Rasht and Mashhad ophiolites (297 Ma and 268 Ma)] and near Anarak in Central Iran. which are the remnants of the Paleo-Tethys ocean crust emplaced as result of closure of the Paleo-Tethys between the Turan and the Central Iranian Microplates (CIM). The Mesezoic ophiolites of Iran are more abundant and include the Zagros ophiolites (i.e., Neyriz and the Kermanshah ophiolites which appear to be coeval with the Oman ophiolite obducted onto the Arabian plate (Ë96-92 Ma). The Khoy ophiolite in NW Iran which has formation age of Middle to Late Jurrasic (Ë159-155 Ma), and emplacement age Albian ages (Ë 109-104 Ma) has a different tectonics than other Zagros ophiolites. Unfragmented ophiolites of the Makran accretionary prism which are located to the south of the Sanandaj-Sirjan microcontinental block, including complexes such as Band-e-Zeyarat/Dar Anar, Ganj and Remeshk/Mokhtarabad (Ë140-98 Ma) are similar in age to the Masirah ophiolite (i.e., Ë150-120 Ma). The ophiolites of the Central Iran include those inside of the Sanandaj-Sirjan microcontinental block, such as Shahr-e-Babak (120 Ma), Naien (100 Ma), Baft, Sabzevar in north central Iran (98-70 Ma) and Tchehel Kureh on the eastern boundary of CIM.Geochemically, these ophiolites are quite diverse and show a significant variations in rock composition, representing a wide range of tectonic environment of formation.

Most of the apatite-bearing iron ores are associated with alkaline magmas with LREE/HREE fractionation varying from moderate to steep. Iron-apatite deposits in Posht-e-Badam Block (Central Iran) have a high concentration of REE (more than 1000 ppm up to 2.5%), and show a strong LREE/HREE ratio with a pronounced negative Eu anomaly. This REE pattern is typical of magmatic apatite and quiet distinct from sedimentary apatites (phosphorites) which have a low REE contents and Ce negative anomalies. On the other hand, they are comparable to the REE patterns of apatites in Kiruna-type iron ores in different parts of the world. The REE patterns of apatites, iron-apatite ores and iron ores are similar and only have different REE contents. This similarity indicates a genetic relation for these rocks. Most of the iron-apatite deposits in Central Iran have similar REE patterns too, which in turn show a genetic relation for all of these deposits. This similarity indicates a similar origin and processes in their genesis. There are some small intrusions around some of the iron-apatite deposits that are petrographically identified as syenite and gabbro. These intrusions also have REE patterns similar to that of iron-apatite ores. This demonstrates a genetic relation between these intrusions and iron-apatite ores. The REE patterns of apatites in different deposits of Posht-e-Badam Block iron-apatite ores show an affinity to alkaline to sub-alkaline magmas and rifting environment. The alkaline host rocks of Central Iran iron-apatite ores are clearly related to an extensional setting where rifting was important (SSE-NNW fault lines). A probable source for this large scale ore forming processes is relatively low partial melting of mantle rocks. The ores have originated by magmatic differentiation as a late phase in the volcanic cycle\n\nA survey of the current use of neuromuscular blocking drugs among the Middle Eastern anesthesiologists.\n\nPubMed\n\nEldawlatly, Abdelazeem; El-Tahan, Mohamed R\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThis survey aimed to assess the extent of practice of the Middle Eastern anesthesiologists in the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB) in 2012. We distributed an electronic survey among 577 members of the Triple-M Middle Eastern Yahoo anesthesia group, enquiring about their practice in the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Questions concerned the routine first choice use of NMB, choice for tracheal intubation, the use of neuromuscular monitoring (NMT), type of NMB used in difficult airway, frequency of using suxamethonium, cisatracurium, rocuronium and sugammadex, observed side effects of rocuronium, residual curarization, and the reversal of residual curarization of rocuronium. A total of 71 responses from 22 Middle Eastern institutions were collected. Most of the Middle Eastern anesthesiologists were using cisatracurium and rocuronium frequently for tracheal intubation (39% and 35%, respectively). From the respondents, 2/3 were using suxamethonium for tracheal intubation in difficult airway, 1/3 were using rocuronium routinely and 17% have observed hypersensitivity reactions to rocuronium, 54% reported residual curarization from rocuronium, 78% were routinely using neostigmine to reverse the rocuronium, 21% used sugammadex occasionally, and 35% were using NMT routinely during the use of NMB. We believe that more could be done to increase the awareness of the Middle Eastern anesthesiologists about the high incidence of PROC (>20%) and the need for routine monitoring of neuromuscular function. This could be accomplished with by developing formal training programs and providing official guidelines.\n\nAssociation study of four polymorphisms in the interleukin-7 receptor alpha gene with multiple sclerosis in Eastern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaj, Mehrdad Sadeghi; Nikravesh, Abbas; Kakhki, Majid Pahlevan; Rakhshi, Nahid\n\n2015-06-01\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with unknown etiology. Various genetics and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. The interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ra) was identified as the first non-major histocompatibility complex (non-MHC) MS susceptibility locus. In this study we are trying to find the association of IL-7Ra gene polymorphisms with MS susceptibility in Eastern Iran. A case-control study was performed in two provinces Sistan & Baluchistan and Khorasan with 219 patients and 258 unrelated matched healthy controls, using PCR-RFLP method for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7718919, rs11567685, rs11567686 and rs6897932 of IL-7Ra gene. We found a tendency toward association with genotyping analyses in SNP rs7718919 (P=0.048, OR=4.344, and 95% CI=0.892-21.146); also genotype and allele frequency in gender and MS subtype stratification were shown to have significant association with MS. Analysis of two provinces separately showed a significant difference in results of the allele and genotype frequencies. Moreover, haplotyping analysis showed that (GTGC) has an association only in the male secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients in comparison to the healthy controls (P=0.043, OR=0.413, and 95% CI=0.179-0.955). IL7-Ra could be a susceptible gene to MS within the Eastern Iran population especially after MS and gender stratification.\n\nView of cell block eight (left), cell block seven, and ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nView of cell block eight (left), cell block seven, and southwest guard tower, looking from cell block eight roof - Eastern State Penitentiary, 2125 Fairmount Avenue, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA\n\nCell block eleven (left) and cell block fifteen, looking from ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nCell block eleven (left) and cell block fifteen, looking from cell block two into the \"Death Row\" exercise yard - Eastern State Penitentiary, 2125 Fairmount Avenue, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA\n\nGeochronological and geochemical constraints on the petrogenesis of Middle Paleozoic (Kwangsian) massive granites in the eastern South China Block\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Feifei; Wang, Yuejun; Zhang, Aimei; Fan, Weiming; Zhang, Yuzhi; Zi, Jianwei\n\n2012-10-01\n\nTo achieve a better understanding of the Kwangsian orogenic event of the eastern South China Block, this paper documents a set of new zircon U-Pb geochronological and Hf isotopic data and whole-rock elemental and Sr-Nd isotopic analytical results for the representative massive granite intrusions across the Jiangshan-Shaoxing fault. The studied samples are classified into two groups, representing the rocks from the Cathaysia Block to the east of the Jiangshan-Shaoxing Fault (Group 1) and those from the eastern Yangtze Block between the Anhua-Luocheng and Jiangshan-Shaoxing faults (Group 2). The Group 1 samples gave the zircon U-Pb ages of 405-454 Ma and ÉHf(t) values of - 3.6 to - 15.2 with Hf model ages of 1.6-2.4 Ga. Group 2 yielded the zircon U-Pb ages of 400-432 Ma and ÉHf(t) values of - 0.2 to - 12.7 with Hf model ages of 1.3-2.2 Ga. Geochemically, the Group 1 samples (A/CNK = 1.02-1.43) have relatively lower Al2O3, MgO, CaO, P2O5 and ÉNd(t) but higher K2O + Na2O than those of Group 2 (A/CNK = 0.93-1.44). Both groups show similar chondrite-normalized patterns of rare-earth elements with Eu/Eu* values of 0.15-0.92 and strongly negative Ba, Sr, Nb, P and Ti anomalies in primitive mantle-normalized spider diagrams. Their ÉNd(t) values range from - 11.1 to - 8.0 for Group 1, and - 8.9 to - 5.0 for Group 2, generally similar to those of Precambrian paragneiss and contemporaneous gneissoid granites in the eastern South China Block. Our geochronological results indicate that the Kwangsian massive granites in the eastern South China Block were crystallized between 400 Ma and 454 Ma, synchronous to the Kwangsian gneissoid granites along the Wugong and Wuyi-Baiyun-Yunkai domains in the eastern South China Block. The synthesis of these whole-rock geochemical and in-situ zircon Hf isotopic data suggests that both the Group 1 and 2 granites across the Jiangshan-Shaoxing Fault were predominantly derived from a crustal source with some proportional metapelitic and\n\nSarcocystis and Its Complications in Camels (Camelus dromedarius) of Eastern Provinces of Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nValinezhad, Akbar; Ahmadi, Nasrollah\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe prevalence of Sarcocystis spp. was investigated by gross and histopathological examinations in 250 camels (Camelus dromedarius) slaughtered from 2002 to 2005 in the Mashhad Slaughterhouse, eastern Iran. Samples were taken from the diaphragm, heart, tongue, esophagus and masseter muscles for histopathological studies. No macroscopic sarcocysts were found in the samples at gross inspection. Sarcocysts were detected in 209 of 250 (83.6%) examined camels at histopathological level. The infection rate of the esophagus, heart, masseter muscles, diaphragm, and tongue was 58.8%, 48.0%, 46.8%, 41.6%, and 28.0%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the rate of infection between male (85.8%) and female (81.0%) camels. The tissue response to vital cysts was minimal; however, reaction to the degenerating cysts was severe and caused tissue damages resulting in hyperemia, hemorrhages, mononuclear cell infiltration, necrotic changes, and fibrosis. The wild and domestic carnivores especially dogs may be the final hosts of Sarcocystis spp. in this area.

The main reservoir consists of Sinian dolomite rocks. It is a fault block with a large growth fault on the west side which trends north-northeast with throws of up to 1 km (0.6 mi) or more. The source rocks for the oil are Paleogene age and overlie the Sinian dolomite rocks. The structural fractures are the main factor forming the reservoir of the buried-block oil field. Three structural lines, trending northeast, north-northeast, andmoreÂ Â» northwest, form the regional netted fracture system. The north-northeast growth fault controlled the structural development of the buried block. The block was raised and eroded before the Tertiary sediments were deposited. In the Eocene Epoch, the Ji-zhong depression subsided, but the deposition, faulting, and related uplift of the block happened synchronously as the block was gradually submerged. At the same time, several horizontal and vertical karst zones were formed by the karst water along the netted structural fractures. The Eocene oil source rocks lapped onto the block and so the buried block, with many developed karst fractures, was surrounded by a great thickness of source rocks. As the growth fault developed, the height of the block was increased from 400 m (1300 ft) before the Oligocene to 1300 m (4250 ft) after. As the petroleum was generated, it migrated immediately into the karst fractures of the buried block along the growth fault. The karst-fractured block reservoir has an 800-m (2600-ft) high oil-bearing closure and good connections developed between the karst fractures.Â«Â less\n\nDesert and desertification in Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBahrami, M.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nOne of the greatest environmental concerns in Iran as in other arid and semiarid countries is the transformation of once productive, or marginally productive, land to deteriorated land and soil unable to support plants and animals. Because the land becomes barren and dry, the process is described as desertification, which occurs as a sequence of events. The area of deserts in Iran is about 340,000 Km2 (less than one fifth of its total area), of which 100,000 Km2 is being used for some cultivation, 120,000 Km2 is subjected to moving sands about 40 % of which is active sand dunes. Most of features and processes usual in world famous deserts are also observed in Iran: low precipitation, high evaporation, poor or lack of vegetation, saline and alkaline soils, low population and small and sparse oases. The deserts of Iran are generally classified in the subtropical, warm, arid and semiarid group, but the effect and presence of some geographical and geoclimatical factors such as height, vicinity to Indian Ocean and so on do some changes in climatic conditions and geographical features causing some local and regional differences in them. Geographically, two groups of deserts have been known in Iran: (1) Coastal deserts which, like a ribbon with variable width, stretch from extreme southeast to extreme southwest, at the north parts of Oman Sea and Persian Gulf. One important feature of these deserts is relatively high humidity which differentiates them from other deserts. This causes an increase in vegetation coverage and hence a decrease in eolian erosion and also a dominance of chemical weathering to that of physical. (2) internal deserts, which rest in central, eastern and southeastern plateau of the country and in independent and semi dependent depressions. This situation, which is due to the surrounding high mountains, blocks humidity entry and causes the aridity of these deserts. Wind as a dominant process in the area causes deflated features such as Reg (desert\n\n31 CFR 560.423 - Offshore transactions involving blocked property.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-07-01\n\n...

This Visean assemblage shows close palaeogeographical affinities of Iran with Kazakhstan and Russia (eastern Transbaikalia, Kurgan region).\n\nLate Jurassic low latitude of Central Iran: paleogeographic and tectonic implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMattei, Massimo; Muttoni, Giovanni; Cifelli, Francesca\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe individual blocks forming present-day Central Iran are now comprised between the Zagros Neo-Tethys suture to the south and the Alborz Palaeo-Tethys suture to the north. At the end of the Palaeozoic, the Iranian blocks rifted away from the northern margin of Gondwana as consequence of the opening of the Neo-Tethys, and collided with Eurasia during the Late Triassic, giving place to the Eo-Cimmerian orogeny. From then on, the Iranian block(s) should have maintained European affinity. Modern generations of apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) show the occurrence in North American and African coordinates of a major and rapid shift in pole position (=plate shift) during the Middle-Late Jurassic. This so-called monster polar shift is predicted also for Eurasia from the North Atlantic plate circuit, but Jurassic data from this continent are scanty and problematic. Here, we present paleomagnetic data from the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian (Upper Jurassic) Garedu Formation of Iran. Paleomagnetic component directions of primary (pre-folding) age indicate a paleolatitude of deposition of 10Â°N Â± 5Â° that is in excellent agreement with the latitude drop predicted for Iran from APWPs incorporating the Jurassic monster polar shift. We show that paleolatitudes calculated from these APWPs, used in conjunction with simple zonal climate belts, better explain the overall stratigraphic evolution of Iran during the Mesozoic.\n\nAnti-malarial seroprevalence assessment during an elimination programme in Chabahar District, south-eastern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nZakeri, Sedigheh; van den Hoogen, Lotus Leonie; Mehrizi, Akram Abouie; Karimi, Fatemh; Raeisi, Ahmad; Drakeley, Chris\n\n2016-07-22\n\nIran has achieved a substantial decline in malaria incidence over the past decades. A common feature of malaria-endemic settings is the requirement for more sensitive techniques to describe levels of low transmission. In this study, serological and parasitological methods were used to measure transmission levels of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax during an elimination programme (2012) in Chabahar District, Sistan and Baluchistan Province, south-eastern Iran. Participants were randomly selected from 64 different geographical clusters in Chabahar city and surrounding villages. Antibody responses to P. falciparum and P. vivax blood-stage antigens were assessed by ELISA, while microscopy and molecular testing were used to determine parasite carriage by species. Age-adjusted antibody responses were analysed using a reversible catalytic model to calculate seroconversion rates (SCR). There was no evidence of recent transmission in the study areas, indicated by an absence of parasite infections in all ages and low or absent serological responses to either species in young children. The best model for age P. falciparum seroconversion was one with a change in exposure 21Â years before sampling was done in Chabahar city (PÂ =Â 0.018) and 4Â years in the villages (PÂ =Â 0.039). There was a higher level of recent P. vivax transmission compared to P. falciparum, based on the SCRs, in both the city and village settings. Serological analysis identified a decline in P. falciparum transmission in the urban areas of Chabahar, consistent with a previously described decrease in malaria in the early 1990s, demonstrating the utility of this approach to reconstruct exposure history. At present, it remains unclear whether the P. vivax antibody responses reflect active transmission due to new infections or relapse infections. The absence of parasitological and serological evidence of recent malaria transmission in Chabahar District is viable evidence for certification of\n\nInvestigation of dust storms entering Western Iran using remotely sensed data and synoptic analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoloorani, Ali D; Nabavi, Seyed O; Bahrami, Hosain A; Mirzapour, Fardin; Kavosi, Musa; Abasi, Esmail; Azizi, Rasoul\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOne of the natural phenomena which have had considerable impacts on various regions of the world, including Iran, is \"dust storm\". In recent years, this phenomenon has taken on new dimensions in Iran and has changed from a local problem to a national issue. This study is an attempt to investigate the formation of the dust storms crossing the Western Iran. To find the sources of the dust storms entering Iran, first we examine three determined dust paths in the region and their temporal activities, using MODIS satellite images. Then, four regions were identified as dust sources through soil, land cover and wind data. Finally, atmospheric analyses are implemented to find synoptic patterns inducing dust storms. Source 1 has covered the region between the eastern banks of Euphrates and western banks of Tigris. Source 2 is in desert area of western and south-western Iraq. Finally source 3 is bounded in eastern and south-eastern deserts of Saudi Arabia called Rub-Al-Khali desert, or Empty Quarter. Moreover, south-eastern part of Iraq (source 4) was also determined as a secondary source which thickens the dust masses originating from the above mentioned sources. The study of synoptic circulations suggests that the dust storms originating from source 1 are formed due to the intense pressure gradient between the low-pressure system of Zagros and a high-pressure cell formed on Mediterranean Sea. The dust events in sources 2 and 3 are outcomes of the atmospheric circulations dominant in the cold period of the year in mid-latitudes.\n\nCenozoic intracontinental deformation of the Kopeh Dagh Belt, Northeastern Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChu, Yang; Wan, Bo; Chen, Ling; Talebian, Morteza\n\n2016-04-01\n\nCompressional intracontinental orogens represent large tectonic zones far from plate boundaries. Since intracontinental mountain belts cannot be framed in the conventional plate tectonics theory, several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the formations of these mountain belts. The far-field effect of collision/subduction at plate margins is now well accepted for the origin and evolution of the intracontinental crust thickening, as exemplified by the Miocene tectonics of central Asia. In northern Iran, the Binalud-Alborz mountain belt witnessed the Triassic tectonothermal events (Cimmerian orogeny), which are interpreted as the result of the Paleotethys Ocean closure between the Eurasia and Central Iran blocks. The Kopeh Dagh Belt, located to the north of the Binalud-Alborz Belt, has experienced two significant tectonic phases: (1) Jurassic to Eocene rifting with more than 7 km of sediments; and (2) Late Eocene-Early Oligocene to Quaternary continuous compression. Due to the high seismicity, deformation associated with earthquakes has received more and more attention; however, the deformation pattern and architecture of this range remain poorly understood. Detailed field observations on the Cenozoic deformation indicate that the Kopeh Dagh Belt can be divided into a western zone and an eastern zone, separated by a series of dextral strike-slip faults, i.e. the Bakharden-Quchan Fault System. The eastern zone characterized by km-scale box-fold structures, associated with southwest-dipping reverse faults and top-to-the NE kinematics. In contrast, the western zone shows top-to-the SW kinematics, and the deformation intensifies from NE to SW. In the northern part of this zone, large-scale asymmetrical anticlines exhibit SW-directed vergence with subordinate thrusts and folds, whereas symmetrical anticlines are observed in the southern part. In regard to its tectonic feature, the Kopeh Dagh Belt is a typical Cenozoic intracontinental belt without ophiolites or\n\nPlague in Iran: its history and current status.\n\nPubMed\n\nHashemi Shahraki, Abdolrazagh; Carniel, Elizabeth; Mostafavi, Ehsan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPlague remains a public health concern worldwide, particularly in old foci.

It is correlated with the unconformity-bounded lower limestone member of the Elika Formation of the Alborz Mountains of northern Iran. The Sorkh Shale is bounded by the pre-Triassic and post-Lower Triassic interregional unconformities and consists mainly of carbonates, sandstones, and evaporites with shale being a minor constituent. Detailed facies analysis of the Sorkh Shale Formation resulted in recognition of several genetically linked peritidal facies that are grouped into restricted subtidal, carbonate tidal flat, siliciclastic tidal flat, coastal plain and continental evaporite facies associations. These were deposited in a low energy, storm-dominated inner-ramp setting with a very gentle slope that fringed the Tabas Block of east central Iran and passed northward (present-day coordinates) into deeper water facies of the Paleotethys passive margin of northern Cimmerian Continent. Numerous carbonate storm beds containing well-rounded intraclasts, ooids and bioclasts of mixed fauna are present in the Sorkh Shale Formation of the northern Tabas Basin. The constituents of the storm beds are absent in the fair weather peritidal facies of the Sorkh Shale Formation, but are present throughout the lower limestone member of the Elika Formation. The Tabas Block, a part of the Cimmerian continent in east central Iran, is a rift basin that developed during Early Ordovician-Silurian Paleotethys rifting. Facies and sequence stratigraphic analyses of the Sorkh Shale Formation has revealed additional evidence supporting the Tabas Block as a failed rift basin related to the Paleotethys passive margin. Absence of constituents of the storm beds in the fair weather peritidal facies of the Sorkh Shale Formation, presence of the constituents of the storm beds in the fair weather facies of the Elika Formation (the\n\n31 CFR 535.508 - Payments to blocked accounts in domestic banks.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...

Understanding which mechanism(s) is appropriate is important to constrain the behaviour of the lithosphere during compressional deformation. Here we analyse the active deformation of the Fars Arc region in the eastern part of the Zagros, Iran, including slip vectors of 92 earthquakes, published GPS and palaeomagnetism data, and the distributions of young and/or active folds. The fold-and-thrust belt in the Fars Arc shows pronounced curvature, convex southwards. Folds trends vary from NW-SE in the west to ENE-WSW in the east. The GPS-derived velocity field shows NNE to SSW convergence, towards the foreland on the Arabian Plate, without dispersion. Earthquake slip vectors are highly variable, spanning a range of azimuths from SW to SSE in an Arabian Plate reference frame. The full variation of azimuths occurs within small (10s of km) sub-regions, but this variation is superimposed on a radial pattern, whereby slip vectors tend to be parallel to the regional topographic gradient. Given the lack of variation in the GPS vectors, we conclude that the Fars Arc is not curved as a result of gravitational spreading over the adjacent foreland, but as a result of deformation being restricted at tectonic boundaries at the eastern and western margins of the Arc. Fault blocks and folds within the Fars Arc, each 20-40 km long, rotate about vertical axes to achieve the overall curvature, predominantly clockwise in the west and counter-clockwise in the east. Active folds of different orientations may intersect and produce dome-and-basin interference patterns, without the need for a series of separate deformation phases of different stress orientations. The Fars Arc clearly contrasts with the Himalayas, where both GPS and earthquake slip vectors display radial patterns towards the foreland, and gravitational spreading is a viable mechanism for producing fold-and-thrust belt curvature.\n\nSynoptic patterns leading to hailstorm in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSalahi, Bromand; Nohegar, Ahmad; Behrouzi, Mahmoud; Aalijahan, Mehdi\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to extract the synoptic patterns of 500 mb geopotential height and the sea level pressure leading to form hail in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, Iran. To this end, at first, we explored hail occurrence in different areas of the province under investigation. Then, using sea level pressure and 500 mb geopotential height data, the patterns of hail occurrence were investigated through hierarchical clustering and Ward's method. The level of 500 mb patterns resulting in hail formation in the area include: (1) settlement of a cut-off low pressure blocking in Turkey and Iran's position in downstream of trough and injection of humidity coming from the Red Sea; (2) settlement of low ridge in northern Europe and Iran lying in downstream of the trough and injection of humidity of the Mediterranean Sea; (3) settlement of a cut-off low pressure in east of Europe and Iran lying in downstream of the trough; and (4) settlement of a deep trough in the Mediterranean Sea, formation of an omega-shaped blocking in Northern Europe and Iran lying in downstream of the trough. At sea level, the following patterns have caused hail formation in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province: (1) settlement of low pressure in Iran and Russia accompanying high pressure in Taklimakan Desert and east of Europe; (2) settlement of low pressure in Iran and high pressure in Egypt, northern Europe, and Taklimakan Desert; and (3) settlement of low pressure in Iran, Saudi Arabia and south of Italy and high pressure in Egypt and Siberia.\n\nRevised Distribution of Bactrocera tryoni in Eastern Australia and Effect on Possible Incursions of Mediterranean Fruit Fly: Development of Australia's Eastern Trading Block.\n\nPubMed\n\nDominiak, Bernard C; Mapson, Richard\n\n2017-12-05\n\nBactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae), commonly called 'Queensland fruit fly' in Australia, and Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) are the two most economically important fruit fly in Australia with B. tryoni in the east and Mediterranean fruit fly in the west. The two species coexisted for several decades, but it is believed that B. tryoni displaced Mediterranean fruit fly. In southeastern Australia, this was deemed inadequate for export market access, and a large fruit fly free zone (fruit fly exclusion zone) was developed in 1996 where B. tryoni was eradicated by each state department in their portion of the zone. This zone caused an artificial restricted distribution of B. tryoni. When the fruit fly exclusion zone was withdrawn in Victoria and New South Wales in 2013, B. tryoni became endemic once again in this area and the national distribution of B. tryoni changed. For export markets, B. tryoni is now deemed endemic to all eastern Australian states, except for the Greater Sunraysia Pest-Free Area. All regulatory controls have been removed between eastern states, except for some small zones, subject to domestic market access requirements. The eastern Australian states now form a B. tryoni endemic trading group or block. All Australian states and territories maintain legislation to regulate the movement of potentially infested host fruit into their states. In particular, eastern states remain active and regulate the entry of commodities possibly infested with Mediterranean fruit fly. The combination of regulatory controls limits the chances of Mediterranean fruit fly entering eastern states, and if it did, Mediterranean fruit fly is unlikely to establish in the opposition to a well-established B. tryoni population.

Most studies have focused on Europe and East Asia with the genetic diversity of West Asia being less well studied. In particular, the genetic variability and genetic structure of the Iranian populations are not yet known; gaps which prevent scientists from resolving the genetic relationships of the Eurasian wild boar. This paper is the first attempt to provide information about genetic relationships among modern Iranian populations of the Eurasian wild boar (S. scrofa) by sequencing 572 bp of the mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region. As a result of this investigation, it was discovered that Iran contains not only Middle Eastern haplotypes, but also shares haplotypes with Europe and East Asia. The Italian clade, which is endemic in Italy, is not identified in Iran, while all other clades, including Asiatic, European, Near East 1, and Near East 2 are found based on the phylogenetic tree and median-joining network. The results of this study illustrate that north west of Iran (specifically Southwest Caspian Sea) is the contact zone between the Asian (Near Eastern and Far Eastern), and the European clades. In light of the fact that the domestication of pigs occurs in Anatolia, this finding is important. PMID:27442074\n\nHospital admissions in Iran for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases attributed to the Middle Eastern Dust storms.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhaniabadi, Yuef Omidi; Fanelli, Roberto; De Marco, Alessandra; Daryanoosh, Seyed Mohammad; Kloog, Itai; Hopke, Philip K; Conti, Gea Oliveri; Ferrante, Margherita; Mohammadi, Mohammad Javad; Babaei, Ali Akbar; Basiri, Hassan; Goudarzi, Gholamreza\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe main objective of this study was to assess the possible effects of airborne particulate matter less than 10Â Î¼m in diameter (PM 10 ) from the Middle Eastern Dust (MED) events on human health in Khorramabad (Iran) in terms of estimated hospital admissions (morbidity) for cardiovascular diseases (HACD) and for respiratory diseases (HARD) during the period of 2015 to 2016. The AirQ program developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used to estimate the potential health impacts to daily PM 10 exposures. The numbers of excess cases for cardiovascular/respiratory morbidity were 20/51, 72/185, and 20/53 on normal, dusty, and MED event days, respectively. The highest number of hospital admissions was estimated for PM 10 concentrations in the range of 40 to 49Â Î¼g/m 3 , i.e, lower than the daily (50Â Î¼g/m 3 ) limit value established by WHO. The results also showed that 4.7% (95% CI 3.2-6.7%) and 4.2% (95% CI 2.6-5.8%) of HARD and HACD, respectively, were attributed to PM 10 concentrations above 10Â Î¼g/m 3 . The study demonstrates a significant impact of air pollution on people, which is manifested primarily as respiratory and cardiovascular problems. To reduce these effects, several immediate actions should be taken by the local authorities to control the impacts of dust storms on residents' health, e.g., developing a green beltway along the Iran-Iraq border and management of water such as irrigation of dry areas that would be effective as mitigation strategies.\n\nPotential Risk Areas of Aedes albopictus in South-Eastern Iran: A Vector of Dengue Fever, Zika, and Chikungunya\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNejati, Jalil; Bueno-MarÃ­, RubÃ©n; Collantes, Francisco; Hanafi-Bojd, Ahmad A.; Vatandoost, Hassan; Charrahy, Zabihollah; Tabatabaei, Seyed M.; Yaghoobi-Ershadi, Mohammad R.; Hasanzehi, Abdolghafar; Shirzadi, Mohammad R.; Moosa-Kazemi, Seyed H.; Sedaghat, Mohammad M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe possibility of the rapid and global spread of Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, and dengue fever by Aedes albopictus is well documented and may be facilitated by changes in climate. To avert and manage health risks, climatic and topographic information can be used to model and forecast which areas may be most prone to the establishment of Ae. albopictus. We aimed to weigh and prioritize the predictive value of various meteorological and climatic variables on distributions of Ae. albopictus in south-eastern Iran using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. Out of eight factors used to predict the presence of Ae. albopictus, the highest weighted were land use, followed by temperature, altitude, and precipitation. The inconsistency of this analysis was 0.03 with no missing judgments. The areas predicted to be most at risk of Ae. albopictus-borne diseases were mapped using Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing data. Five-year (2011â2015) meteorological data was collected from 11 meteorological stations and other data was acquired from Landsat and Terra satellite images. Southernmost regions were at greatest risk of Ae. albopictus colonization as well as more urban sites connected by provincial roads. This is the first study in Iran to determine the regional probability of Ae. albopictus establishment. Monitoring and collection of Ae. albopictus from the environment confirmed our projections, though on-going field work is necessary to track the spread of this vector of life-threatening disease.

L.; Smith, S.M.; Stewart, H.F.; Forfinski, N.A.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nMultibeam bathymetric data and seismic-reflection profiles collected in eastern Long Island Sound and western Block Island Sound reveal previously unrecognized glacial features and modern bedforms. Glacial features include an ice-sculptured bedrock surface, a newly identified recessional moraine, exposed glaciolacustrine sediments, and remnants of stagnant-ice-contact deposits. Modern bedforms include fields of transverse sand waves, barchanoid waves, giant scour depressions, and pockmarks. Bedform asymmetry and scour around obstructions indicate that net sediment transport is westward across the northern part of the study area near Fishers Island, and eastward across the southern part near Great Gull Island.\n\nHuman Hydatidosis/Echinococosis in North Eastern Iran from 2003-2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndalib Aliabadi, Zohreh; Berenji, Fariba; Fata, Abdolmajid; Jarahi, Lida\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHuman cystic echinococcosis (hydatidosis) continues to be an essential cause of morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world.

Overall, 1342 patients, 711 females (53%) and 631 males (47%) diagnosed as infected with hydatid cyst were evaluated. Their age was between 1 and 91 yr (mean age 37.75). The most affected age group was 20-30 yr old. Totally, 953 cases (71%) were urban and 375 cases (27.8%) were rural residents. The most common localization of cysts was the liver and lung. The housewives were the most frequently infected occupations. The rate of infection with hydatid cyst is high in Mashhad, northeast of Iran, and the incidence of human hydatidosis tends to increase in recent years so control and prevention programs are recommended.\n\nA Narrative Review of Acute Adult Poisoning in Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlinejad, Samira; Zamani, Nasim; Abdollahi, Mohammad; Mehrpour, Omid\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPoisoning is a frequent cause of referral to medical emergencies and a major health problem around the world, especially in developing countries. We aimed to review the epidemiology and pattern of adult poisoning in Iran in order to facilitate the early diagnosis and management of poisoning. The pattern of poisoning is different in various parts of Iran. Pharmaceutical compounds were the most common cause of poisoning in most parts of Iran. Pesticide-related toxicities were more common in northern agricultural regions, whereas bites and stings were seen more commonly in southern Iran. Carbon monoxide poisoning was common in cities with many motor vehicles such as Tehran and in colder climates such as in northern and western regions due to inadequately vented gas appliances such as stoves and heaters. Majoon Birjandi (containing cannabis) is a unique substance used in eastern Iran. Poisoning by opioids, tramadol, and pesticides (organophosphate and aluminum phosphide) has remained a common hazard in Iran. Poisoning-associated morbidity and mortality rates vary by region and have changed over time due to the introduction of new drugs and chemicals. Early diagnosis and proper treatment may be lifesaving; thus, understanding the general pattern of poisoning in different regions is important.

The fuzzy AHP is a popular technique which has been applied for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. In this paper we used fuzzy AHP and geospatial information system (GIS) to generate prospectivity model for Iron Oxide Copper-Gold (IOCG) mineralization on the basis of its conceptual model and geo-evidence layers derived from geological, geochemical, and geophysical data in Taherabad area, eastern Iran. The FuzzyAHP was used to determine the weights belonging to each criterion. Three geoscientists knowledge on exploration of IOCG-type mineralization have been applied to assign weights to evidence layers in fuzzy AHP MPM approach. After assigning normalized weights to all evidential layers, fuzzy operator was applied to integrate weighted evidence layers. Finally for evaluating the ability of the applied approach to delineate reliable target areas, locations of known mineral deposits in the study area were used. The results demonstrate the acceptable outcomes for IOCG exploration.\n\nWater supply management using an extended group fuzzy decision-making method: a case study in north-eastern Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMinatour, Yasser; Bonakdari, Hossein; Zarghami, Mahdi; Bakhshi, Maryam Ali\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to develop a group fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method to be applied in rating problems associated with water resources management. Thus, here Chen's group fuzzy TOPSIS method extended by a difference technique to handle uncertainties of applying a group decision making. Then, the extended group fuzzy TOPSIS method combined with a consistency check. In the presented method, initially linguistic judgments are being surveyed via a consistency checking process, and afterward these judgments are being used in the extended Chen's fuzzy TOPSIS method. Here, each expert's opinion is turned to accurate mathematical numbers and, then, to apply uncertainties, the opinions of group are turned to fuzzy numbers using three mathematical operators. The proposed method is applied to select the optimal strategy for the rural water supply of Nohoor village in north-eastern Iran, as a case study and illustrated example. Sensitivity analyses test over results and comparing results with project reality showed that proposed method offered good results for water resources projects.\n\nNeeds Assessment of International Students at Eastern Oregon State College.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEid, Mamoud Taha; Jordan-Domschot, Theresa\n\nThe purpose of the research project was to assess the needs, satisfaction, and concerns of international students attending Eastern Oregon State College.

Given the total number k of clusters desired, the clustering procedure finds the best assignment of stations to clusters. Clustering is calculated for k= 2 to 14. In geographic space, cluster boundaries that remain relatively stable as k is increased are tentatively identified as block boundaries. That identification is reinforced if the cluster boundary coincides with a geologic feature. Boundaries identified in northern California and Nevada are the Central Nevada Seismic Belt, the west side of the Northern Walker Lane Belt, and the Bartlett Springs Fault. Three blocks cover all of Oregon and Washington. The principal block boundary there extends west-northwest along the Brothers Fault Zone, then north and northwest along the eastern boundary of Siletzia, the accreted oceanic basement of the forearc. East of this boundary is the Intermountain block, its eastern boundary undefined. A cluster boundary at Cape Blanco subdivides the forearc along the faulted southern margin of Siletzia. South of Cape Blanco the Klamath Mountains-Basin and Range block extends east to the Central Nevada Seismic Belt and south to the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block. The Siletzia block north of Cape Blanco coincides almost exactly with the accreted Siletz terrane. The cluster boundary in the eastern Olympic Peninsula may mark permanent shortening of Siletzia against the Intermountain block.\n\nMitochondrial Genetic Differentiation of Spirlin (Actinopterigii: Cyprinidae) in the South Caspian Sea basin of Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeifali, Mahvash; Arshad, Aziz; Moghaddam, Faezeh Yazdani; Esmaeili, Hamid Reza; Kiabi, Bahram H.; Daud, Siti Khalijah; Aliabadian, Mansour\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Knowledge about Alburnoides remains lacking relative to many other species, resulting in a lack of a systematic position and taxonomic diagnosis. Basic biological information for Alburnoides has been constructed, and it is necessary to understand further and obtain more information about this species. Its phylogenetic relationships are still debated and no molecular data have been used to study this taxon in Iran. A holistic approach for genetic methods was adopted to analyze possible spirlin population differences at selected centers in the south Caspian Sea basin of Iran. Methods The phylogenetic relationships were determined based on 774 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 32 specimens of spirlin from nine locations in the south Caspian Sea drainage basin of Iran. The nucleotide sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Results The mitochondrial gene tree largely supports the existence of three major clades. The western populations (clade I) may be considered as Alburnoides eichwaldii, whereas the Talar river populations (clade II) are represented as Alburnoides sp.1 and the eastern populations (clade III) may be distinct taxa of Alburnoides sp.2. Conclusion This molecular evidence supports the hypothesis that A. bipunctatus does not exist in the south Caspian Sea basin of Iran, and that the western and eastern populations are distinct taxa.

Richard; Saltiel, David H.\n\n2002-02-15\n\nparticular, will continue to play a vital role in determining the extent to which Iran is able to pursue WMD options. Without a fundamental change in the regional security environment, however, there is little reason to expect changes in Iranian WMD and missile policies, and the United States, acting alone and short of war, cannot prevent Iran from ultimately developing WMD and delivery systems. Furthermore, U.S. policies that take a tougher line with Russia, China and North Korea are not likely to lead to more restraint among these potential sources of WMD and missile technology. In the absence of engagement with Iran, unilateral U.S. economic sanctions will remain the principal, if flawed, U.S. policy tool for seeking to prevent Iran from acquiring WMD. The rationale is that by discouraging trade and investment, particularly in Iran's energy sector, the government of Iran will have less revenue to pursue proliferation. Without broad international support for economic isolation, however, such an effort may hinder Iran's WMD programs, though it cannot block them. Finally, options are needed to deal with major failures in nonproliferation efforts. These options include measures to deter Iranian use of WMD, to defend against their use if deterrence fails, and to destroy Iranian WMD capabilities should the need arise.Â«Â less\n\n31 CFR 588.205 - Expenses of maintaining blocked property; liquidation of blocked account.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...

The current brief study was conducted to review available national published data on suicide and to interpret the probable discrepancies. Method: We evaluated all 20-year recent published original articles on committed suicides searching Iranian scientific databases, PubMed, and Google Scholar with the keywords of suicide, mortality, and Iran. Results: Articles showed an overall increased trend of suicidal deaths in Iran. Discrepancies existed regarding suicide rate and demographic characteristics among 9 English and Persian published articles. Although a suicide rate of 6.2 per 100 000 was reported in 2003, almost 31 times greater than 1991, an average suicide rate of 9.9 per 100 000 was calculated based on data interpretations. Conclusion: Apparently, Iran has had the highest increase in suicide-related deaths among Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) and Islamic countries during the recent decades. National policies to prevent suicide have not been efficient enough, and urgent intervention is needed.â PMID:28496505\n\nFactor XIII deficiency in Iran: a comprehensive review of the literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nDorgalaleh, Akbar; Naderi, Majid; Hosseini, Maryam Sadat; Alizadeh, Shaban; Hosseini, Soudabeh; Tabibian, Shadi; Eshghi, Peyman\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFactor XIII deficiency (FXIIID) is a rare bleeding disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2-million population worldwide. In Iran, a Middle Eastern country with a high rate of consanguineous marriages, there are approximately 473 patients afflicted with FXIIID. An approximately 12-fold higher prevalence of FXIIID is estimated in Iran in comparison with overall worldwide frequency. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive review on different aspects of FXIIID in the Iranian population. The distribution of this disease in different regions of Iran reveals that Sistan and Baluchestan Province has not only the highest number of patients with FXIIID in Iran but the highest global incidence of this condition. Among Iranian patients, umbilical cord bleeding, hematoma, and prolonged wound bleeding are the most frequent clinical manifestations. There are several disease causing mutations in Iranian patients with FXIIID, with Trp187Arg being the most common mutation in FXIIID in Iran. Traditionally, the management of FXIIID in Iran was only based on administration of fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate, until 2009 when FXIII concentrate became available for patient management. Various studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic regimens in different situations with valuable findings. Although the focus of this study is on Iran, it offers considerable insight into FXIIID, which can be applied more extensively to improve the management and quality of life in all affected patients.

A dataset with a final sequence length of 633 nucleotides including 100 specimens from 31 geographically distant localities across Iran were generated. The result demonstrated that two major clades with strong support can be identified within the genus Bunopus in Iran. Clade A includes Bunopus crassicaudus and two new entities, eastern populations (subclade A2,1) and Shahdad populations (subclade A2,2). The second clade comprises western and southwestern populations (subclade B1,1), Arabian populations (subclade B1,2) and south and southeast populations in Iran, to which Bunopus tuberculatus (subclade B2) is assigned. In addition to Bunopus crassicaudus and B. tuberculatus, three new candidate species in Iran can easily be identified based on the DNA barcoding approach.\n\nIran rebuilds family planning services.\n\nPubMed\n\nButta, P\n\n1993-07-01\n\nAfter the revolution, the Islamic Republic of Iran instituted pronatalist policies which included lowering the minimum marriage age for girls to 9 years, abolishing some laws securing women's rights, and limiting availability of family planning (FP) services. By 1983, Iran's population growth rate was 3.9% which was among the highest worldwide. Before the revolution, Iran had 37 million people. About 2 million more people were added each year, resulting in a population size of 60 million by 1992. By the mid-1980s, economic development stood idle, there were not enough houses, children attended schools on 3 shifts, and malnutrition was spreading. In 1989, the government formed a population council and reestablished FP services. It also increased the minimum age of marriage for girls to 13 years, slightly improved women status, and eliminated fertility incentives for couples with at least 4 children. It also significantly increased funding for FP (from 560 million to 13 billion rials between 1990 and 1992). Government spending for FP will likely increase 2% annually until 2011. The government initiated a promotion of FP mass media campaign, emphasizing a 2-child family. Some posters showed a family with 2 girls. The mass media campaign promoted specific contraceptive methods (even tubal occlusion and vasectomy), a practice other Middle Eastern countries not do. 80% of sterilization acceptors claimed to learn about sterilization from the radio or newspapers. The Ministry of Health has invited the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception (AVSC) to help with its campaign to update sterilization techniques, including the non scalpel vasectomy technique. AVSC hopes to become even more involved in helping Iran update its national FP program.\n\nThe effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere in the collision zone between Arabia and Eurasia in Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZamani, Ahmad; Samiee, Jafar; Kirby, Jon F.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe effective elastic thickness, Te, has been calculated in the collision zone between Arabia and Eurasia in Iran from the wavelet coherence. The wavelet coherence is calculated from Bouguer anomalies and topography data using the isotropic fan wavelet method, and gives Te values between 14.2 and 62.2 km. The lower value is found in the Central Iranian Blocks and the East Iranian Belt which are bounded by several large strike-slip faults with lithospheric origin. The higher value occurs in the east of the South Caspian Sea Basin. The resulting Te map shows positive and negative correlation with shear wave velocity and surface heat flow, respectively. A comparison between the seismogenic thickness (Ts) and Te in Iran suggests that Te > Ts. Results of the load ratio in Iran indicate that in most of the study area surface loads are much more prevalent than subsurface loads, except in the Central Iranian Blocks and NW of Iran. Intermediate to low Te values in Iran were inherited from multiple rifting and orogenic activities from Late Precambrian (â¼650 Ma) to present day which are not only reflected in thin and warm lithosphere but also an increasing seismicity rate.\n\n31 CFR 535.217 - Blocking of property of the former Shah of Iran and of certain other Iranian nationals.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-07-01\n\n...

The Central Iran block was believed to represent a stable Precambrian block. Our results indicate that: (1) Only a very small proportion of Precambrian but abundant Paleozoic and Mesozoic detrital white mica indicate the Phanerozoic, mostly Mesozoic age of metamorphic crust exposed in Central Iran. The oldest but scarce detrital white mica grains have ages ranging from 524 to 826 Ma heralding a Late Precambrian and Cambrian crystalline basement or cannibalism from older clastic successions. (2) Jurassic and Cretaceous sandstones from the west and east of the Chapedony fault yield different age spectra, with a dominance of Variscan ages (ca. 308-385 Ma) in the Biabanak unit west of the Chapedony fault compared to coeval sandstones from the block east of the Chapedony fault, where Variscan ages are subordinate and Cimmerian ages predominate. The micas from the Biabanak unit are most likely derived from the Variscan accretionary complex exposed in the Anarak-Jandaq areas further northwest. This result underlines the importance of a major block boundary identified as the Chapedony fault, which is in extension of a fault previously proposed. (3) Two stages of Cimmerian events are visible in our data set from Cretaceous and Paleogene sandstones, a cluster around 170 Ma and at ca. 205 Ma. These clusters suggest a two-stage Cimmerian evolution of the largely amphibolite-grade metamorphic Posht-e-Badam and Boneh Shurow complexes. (4) The youngest micas in Paleogene conglomerates have an age of ca. 100 Ma and are most likely derived from the base of the Posht-e-Badam complex. No record of the uplifted Eocene Chapedony metamorphic core complex has been found in Eocene and Pliocene clastic rocks.\n\nCell block eleven, looking from the \"Death Row\" exercise yard, ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nCell block eleven, looking from the \"Death Row\" exercise yard, facing north (note cell block fifteen to the right and cell block fourteen in the distance_ - Eastern State Penitentiary, 2125 Fairmount Avenue, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA\n\nActive Tectonics of the Iran Plateau and South Caspian Basin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPriestely, K.; Jackson, J.; Maggi, A.; Talebian, M.; Walker, R.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nWe use observations of surface faulting, well-constrained earthquake focal mechanisms and centroid depths, and velocity structure to investigate the present-day deformation and kinematics of the region. Current deformation is primarily concentrated in three seismically active belts: the Zagros Mountains of southwest Iran,the Talesh-Alborz-Kopeh Dag Mountains of northern Iran, and the Apsheron-Balkhan Sill in the central Caspian Sea. These belts are separated by seismically inactive regions that act as semi-rigid blocks. The extent to which the active shortening is divided between the three belts is still uncertain. Earthquake locations in the region, particularly their focal depths which are determined from teleseismic arrival times, are poor, and reported subcrustal earthquakes have been cited as evidence for present-day subduction beneath the Zagros. A detailed analysis of earthquake focal depths in the Zagros and elsewhere in the region confirms that no substantial subcrustal earthquakes occur in this part of the Middle East except beneath the Makran subduction zone in the south and the Apsheron-Balkhan Sill in the north. The present-day N-S deformation across the Zagros is partitioned with right-lateral, strike-slip motion on the NW-SE striking Main Recent Fault, and NE-SW shortening across the Zagros. Shortening in the Zagros is accommodated by folding in the sediments (0-10 km depth), moderate earthquakes on high-angle reverse faults striking parallel to the surface folds (~10-20 km depth), and aseismic thickening of the lower crust (~20-45 km depth). The south Caspian basin is essentially free of earthquakes and acts as a rigid block which strongly influences the nature of the deformation in the surrounding active belts. No significant subcrustal earthquakes occur in the Talesh, Alborz, or Kopeh Dag Mountains which bound the northeast, south and west sides of the south Caspian basin, but substantial subcrustal seismicity occurs beneath the Apsheron\n\nElemental and carbonaceous characterization of TSP and PM10 during Middle Eastern dust (MED) storms in Ahvaz, Southwestern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nShahsavani, Abbas; Yarahmadi, Maryam; Hadei, Mostafa; Sowlat, Mohammad Hossein; Naddafi, Kazem\n\n2017-08-21\n\nMiddle Eastern dust (MED) storms carry large amounts of dust particles to the Southern and Western cities of Iran. This study aimed to characterize the elemental and carbonaceous composition of total suspended particles (TSP) and PM 10 in Ahvaz, Iran. TSP and PM 10 samples were collected using two separate high-volume air samplers. The sampling program was performed according to EPA guidelines and resulted in 72 samples. Twenty-eight elements and two carbonaceous components in TSP and PM 10 were measured. Over the entire study period, the mean concentration (SD) of TSP and PM 10 was 1548.72Â Î¼g/m 3 (1965.11Â Î¼g/m 3 ) and 1152.35Â Î¼g/m 3 (1510.34Â Î¼g/m 3 ), respectively. The order of concentrations of major species were Si > Al > Ca > OC > Na > B > Zn > Mn > K > Mg and Si > Ca > Al > Na > OC > B > K > Mn > Cu > Mg for TSP and PM 10 , respectively. Almost all elements (except for Cd, Cr, and Cu) and carbonaceous components (except for organic carbon) had dust days/non-dust days (DD/NDD) ratios higher than 1, implying that all components are somehow affected by dust storms. Crustal elements constituted the major portion of particles for both TSP and PM 10 in both DDs and NDDs. The enrichment factor of elements such as Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti was near unity. Species such as Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, Si, and EC had high correlation coefficients in both TSP and PM 10 (except for EC). In conclusion, Ahvaz is exposed to high concentrations of TSP and PM 10 during the MED period. Immediate actions must be planned to decrease the high concentrations "
