        "text": "Pesar adam dokhtare hava – پسر آدم دختر حوا\n\nThe story is about two lawyers both young, beautiful and single… Scammed by two real estate agents (it’s hard to find clients these days with all this crisis… you can’t blame them much lol), they end up sharing the same flat as their office and here start the fun! Nice romantic comedy. I really laughed like a child nearly all movie-long. It reminded me a lot of Tom and Jerry, or more adequately to Persian boy and girl relationship…\n\nSince the first time I saw it I was too sick and druggie, I’ll watch it soon again. Who saw it? and what did you think of it?"
