        "text": "As Iran's athletes prepare for the Olympic games, the team's uniform has come under public scrutiny. After the uniform was unveiled, complaints flooded in that it looked hastily designed or like a poorly done school uniform. One popular Iranian presenter even noted that the outfit bore similarities to an eraser.\n\nA new designer was then brought in to modify the design. But Iranian social media users still weren't impressed. For many, the choice is now between a uniform that looks like an eraser or one that looks like pizza.\n\nThe video below sums up social media responses to the original blue-and-orange uniform's design. The clip begins with images of the flags of brutal militant group ISIS, and the narrator states:\n\nDaesh [ISIS] has claimed responsibility for the design of Iran's Olympic uniform.\n\nThe narration continues with quotes from social media users.\n\nThe uniforms aren't even as well designed as school uniforms… I wouldn't even wear it to go to the corner store and buy yogurt…They are not even suitable for sharing on the “wall of caring.”\n\nThe video makes reference to a popular Instagram post by Iranian comic presenter Rambod Javan, in which he displayed the uniform next to a Pelikan eraser. The result? Well, you can see for yourself:\n\nFollowing the overall disdain for the drab uniform, a new designer, Kamran Bakhtiary, was tasked with sprucing up the outfit, and the revamped version was announced on Twitter by the Iranian Olympic committee:\n\nThe Olympic uniform worn by #Ehsan_Rouzbahni and #Mahsa_Javar.\n\nBut the new design is facing criticism too. Iranian satirist Kioomars Marzban likened the new uniform to Italian food:\n\nThe new Olympic uniform has been revealed | Now what kind of pizza are you in the mood for?\n\nInstagram user lady_ati asked followers to select their preferred uniform, as imagined on child-like cartoon figures:\n\nThe original designer, Mahnaz Armin, finally broke her silence on the “misuse” of her design. Instagram user enaytialireza posted a screen capture of her comment.\n\nIn it, Armin claims that the Olympic Committee destroyed her design to cut costs. She writes that the project was taken from her and given to a young and inexperienced designer. Armin's account appears to have been taken offline since then.\n\nFinally, Twitter user @Aghajoon lampooned the new design in his tweet featuring a baby dressed as a watermelon.\n\n#Kamran_Bakhtiary announced that the Olympic uniform has been modified. Here is the new design. So no one complain — we don't want to upset our athletes"
