        "text": "‘The Good, the Bad, the Gaudy’, the debut film by comedy screenwriter Peyman Qasemkhani, has started Norouz (Persian New Year) screenings in Iran.\n\nWith the end of the 35th Fajr Film Festival (FFF) which concluded last week, a number of movies welcomed by the audiences were speculated to be the possible choices for Norouz screenings. However, the showing of Qasemkhani’s comedy started from Wednesday, February 15, five weeks ahead of the beginning of the Persian New Year, ISNA reported.\n\nThe cast of the high-potential comedy includes Hamid Farokhnejad, Pejman Jamshidi, Sam Derakhshani, Vishka Asayesh, Amir-Mehdi Jule, Azadeh Samadi and Niusha Zeighami, among others.\n\nThe story is about a movie director who is under pressure from his film producer to use “two money-making actors” who he believes are the worst choice for his film, but will help sell the movie.\n\nBorn in Tehran, Qasemkhani, 51, is best known for the comic scripts he has written for 30 films and series and particularly for his collaboration with the popular comedian and director Mehran Modiri in the series ‘Man of a Thousand Faces’ (2008), Mozaffar’s Garden’ (2006), ‘Nights of Barareh’ (2005) and ‘Tiptoe’ (2002-2003).\n\nHe has also served as the head of screenwriters group in some other series including ‘Pejman’ (2013) and ‘The Doctors Building’ (2010-2011) directed by Soroush Sehat, ‘Passengers’ (2009) by Rambod Javan and ‘Fasten Your Seat Belts’ (2004) by Mehdi Mazloomi.\n\nQasemkhani has penned the scripts for eight hit comedies, all among the bestsellers of the year they were screened, namely: ‘Sensitive Floor’ (2013) and ‘The Lizard’ (2003) directed by Kamal Tabrizi, ‘No Men Allowed’ (2010) by Rambod Javan, ‘Saint Petersburg’ (2010) by Behrouz Afkhami and ‘Maxx’ (2004) by Saman Moqaddam.\n\nAs an actor, he has also appeared in films such as ‘Sensitive Floor’ and ‘Saint Petersburg’.\n\nIt has been a booming year so far for local cinema industry in the current year that ends on March 20, as the overall sale of movies has grossed over $40 million, a record-breaking amount, and more than double the total sales in the previous year.\n\nNorouz screenings usually fetch high sales for films, as most of the people have a two-week long holiday which gives them ample opportunity to spend some time at the cinemas.\n\nThree films, out of the total six, screened for this year’s New Year, earned over $3 million in the box-office, a unique record in history of Iran cinema.\n\n‘The Good, the Bad, the Gaudy’ was the second best film by viewer’s choice at the 35th FFF and was also approved by many critics as a good comedy with a flawless script and fine performances. Considering these points, expectations are high that the film will become one of the highest grossing movies of the upcoming calendar year."
