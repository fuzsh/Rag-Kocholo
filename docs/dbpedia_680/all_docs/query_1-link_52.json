        "text": "Iranian director Rambod Javan has started filming his new project 'Murphy's Law'.\n\nThe shooting stage for Javan's new film is currently underway in northern Iran.\n\nHaving a main role in the film, this is Javan's third movie in which he has also starred.\n\nAmir Jafari, Amir Jadidi, Hadi Kazemi and Soroush Sehhat are the other main cast of the action comedy.\n\nBorn in 1971, Rambod Javan began stage acting in 1991.\n\nThree years later, he came into the spotlight with a short role in 'The Spouses' and found fame after appearing in the series 'Green House'.\n\nIn 2002, he directed his first series, 'Lost', which was broadcast during the fasting month of Ramadan and was well-received by both viewers and critics.\n\nRambod made his film-directing debut with 'Spaghetti in 8 minutes' in 2005 and received a Fajr International Film Festival Crystal Simorgh for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for 'Sinners'.\n\nThe diverse roles he took on in 'Mummy 3' and 'A Place of Love' established him as a versatile actor. Many critics, however, believe 'Pink' was the apex of his acting career.\n\nHe was nominated for a Fajr International Film Festival Crystal Simorgh for Best Actor for 'Pink'.\n\nRambod has appeared in many other series and movies, including 'Born Again', 'Help Me', 'The Magic Coat', 'Max', 'Souvenir from Abroad', 'The Music Box', 'Adam's Son, Eve's Daughter', 'No Men Allowed', 'The Lab' and 'Conditional Release'.\n\nFM/MG"
