If you've heard that a person has suffered brain death and then recovered, it hasn't actually been brain death. Patients who have recovered are in fact in a deep coma, and after returning from a coma, their relatives or sometimes even some doctors and nurses who do not have enough information about the difference between brain death and coma have made such a misconception!\n\nTherefore, sometimes relatives of a brain dead person mistakenly assume that he has a chance of recovery and return, so they do not consent to organ donation in the hope of recovery.\n\nIn a coma, there is a chance for some patients to recover, while brain death is, in medical terms, absolute death, and the person will never alive.\n\nIn brain death, the patient's recovery is impossible and his death within a few days is inevitable. Therefore, the opportunity to donate a brain-dead person's organ is limited to a few days!\n\nComa recognition\n\nCortical cells are highly sensitive to hypoxia, so when blood flow to these cells is stopped, they quickly become seriously and sometimes irreversibly damaged. In this case, the person quickly loses consciousness and, depending on the extent of damage to the cerebral cortex, his reactions to environmental stimuli are reduced. However, there is still the possibility of improving the condition and returning the consciousness of the disease that has gone into a coma.\n\nRecognizing brain death\n\nBrain death is the cessation of all brain activity and brainstem at the same time. a person with brain death is actually a person who, due to extensive brain damage, has been unable to communicate with his surroundings, cannot speak, does not see, does not respond to painful stimulations. A person with brain death is also unable to breathe spontaneously. Although he has a heartbeat, he has no recordable waves when we record his brain waves. His heart rate continues with the help of a ventilator and maintenance measures to keep donated organs in optimal conditions for transplantation. Brain death in medical science is absolute death and this person will never come back to life.\n\nTranslator : Javad Eynaki Maleki"
