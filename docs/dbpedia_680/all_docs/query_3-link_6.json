        "text": "Tehran’s Garden Art Museum hosted the celebration arranged by Iran’s House of Cinema in which the directors were honored for their numerous activities and great achievements in Iranian cinema.\n\nMany veterans were invited to the celebration where some made short remarks and expressed their personal feelings toward the honorees.\n\nRoya Teimurian, Masud Rayegan, Parviz Shahbazi, Aborreza Kahani, Tahmineh Milani, Rambod Javan and Jahangir Kowsari were among the guests.\n\nDirector Nasser Taqvaii called Bani-Etemad a moderate filmmaker with a unique position in Iranian cinema.\n\n“I don’t believe in the dissociation of activities of males and females, since whatever enters Iran comes under the influence of Iranian culture.\n\n“Although art is a world without limits for both males and females, women have faced problems in entering the field of cinema since many families regarded cinema with suspension and distrust,” he said.\n\n“Bani-Etemad is a prominent filmmaker. In the world of cinema, our cinema is exclusive. The cinema of the 20th century is the cinema of structure and it is structure that narrates the story. I don’t know how old our movie industry is or how many years longer it will continue to exist, but I hope we would be as diligent as Bani-Etemad,” he added.\n\nActor and director Mehdi Fakhimzadeh was next invited to honor the five decades of activities of Motavasselani.\n\n“I hardly attend theses types of ceremonies. But when I heard his name, I thought it would be a pity not to take apart in this ceremony. He is a good friend, a good director and an outstanding person,” Fakhimzadeh said.\n\n“I am happy to be here tonight and I hope these types of ceremonies bring our hearts closer to one another,” Motavasselani said.\n\nWhen filmmaker Kiumars Purahmad appeared on stage to hand the award to Tavakkoli, he said, “This young filmmaker has proved he is a good director with his first movie.\n\nTavakkoli, director of “Here without Me” and “Walking in the Fog” thanked the organizers and said he was happy to be honored by the veterans.\n\nMirkarimi was next presented with an award by the Academy Award winning Italian director of photography Vittorio Storaro who is in Iran busy filming Majid’s “Muhammad (S)”.\n\nStoraro said he is happy to be here among the Iranian cineastes.\n\nFilmmakers and cinematographers share the same goal; filmmaking is like playing in an orchestra. Cinema is like writing with cameras, it is a spiritual journey, he said."
