        "text": "Article originally published by Middle East Eye\n\nThe news of an artist couple travelling to Canada to give birth to their child has sparked controversy in Iran, with the supporters of rival political parties strongly criticising the couple’s decision.\n\nIranian actor Negar Javaherian and Iranian director and actor Rambod Javan – who is also the presenter of the popular television show Khandevaneh – travelled to Toronto for the first screening of Javan’s latest movie “Murphy’s Law“.\n\nSome outlets reported that the couple planned to stay in Canada until Javaherian gave birth. The Javan daily newspaper, unrelated to the filmmaker with the same name, on 8 June wrote that the premiere date for “Murphy’s Law” was carefully chosen to let the couple have their baby in Canada.\n\nCanada recognises birthright citizenship and many rich Iranian business persons and celebrities travel there to obtain a second nationality for their newborns, and for themselves later.\n\n“Citizens have the right to give birth to their children wherever they like,” wrote the daily.\n\n“But this act will receive serious criticism when those who have always talked and written about their lives in the homeland choose another country for childbirth.”"
