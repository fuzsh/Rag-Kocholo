He won in 2008 the Best Actor Award at the Gol Agha Comedy Festival and is regarded as one of the most creative and prolific Iranian comedy actors.\n\nHe graduated from high school in Mashhad majoring in Economy and moved to Tehran to study Industrial Design at the University of Tehran. Despite enjoying his field of study he turned to acting. In 1980s he started playing theatre under Hassan Hamed, portraying non comic roles until 1992 when Hamed passed away.\n\nAttaran made his television debut playing his first comedy role as Reza back in 1994 in the TV Series Happy Hour (Saate Khosh) directed by Mehran Modiri alongside actors like Reza Shafii Jam, Nasrollah Radesh, Arzhang Amirfazli and Nader Soleimani.\n\nIn 1994 he married Farideh Faramarzi, a film editor and actress. She played with her husband in the movie Absolute Rest (Esterahate Motlagh) directed by Abdolreza Kahani.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2003 he started directing his own TV series where he achieved great recognition and fame for his singing skills. At that time he formed a music band called Dampaei (Slippers) together with Youssef Teimouri and other artists. Since then he has become the most successful comedy series maker in Iranian TV.\n\nAttaran made his debut as a film director in 2011 with I feel sleepy (Khabam Miad). In 2013 he directed and acted in Red Carpet (Farshe Ghermez); Attaran’s sarcastic take on film festivals, fame and stars.\n\nHe was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the 30th, 31st and 32nd Fajr International Film Festival: In 2012 for I feel sleepy (Khabam Miad), in 2013 for The Corridor (Dehliz) and in 2014 for Sensitive floor (Tabagheye Hasas).\n\nTV shows\n\nHappy Hour (Saate Khosh, as Reza, comedy, 1995-96)\n\nAcacia Alley (as Faramaz, director: Reza Attaran, comedy, 2002-03)\n\nVagabond (as Ahmad, director: Reza Attaran, comedy, 2004)\n\nThe Accused Fled (as Ramin, director: Reza Attaran, comedy, 2005)\n\nShirin-va-Torsh (as Naser, director: Reza Attaran, comedy, 2007)\n\nTurning Point (as Nader, director: Reza Attaran, comedy, 2008)\n\nGhalbe Yakhi (as Esfandiar, crime/drama, 2012)\n\nFilms\n\n– 2015: Sperm whale (shooting, as Arjang, director: Saman Moghadam)\n\n– 2015: Absolute Rest (Esterahate Motlagh, as Davoud, director: Abdolreza Kahani)\n\n– 2014: Bar Bad Rafteh (Director: Reza Attaran)\n\n– 2013: The Corridor (Dehliz, as Behzad, Director: Behrouz Shoaibi)\n\n– 2013: Red Carpet (Farshe Ghermez, director: Reza Attaran)\n\n– 2013: Sensitive Floor (Tabagheye Hasas, as Kamali, director: Kamal Tabrizi)\n\n– 2013: Kalashnikov (Director: Kamal Tabrizi)\n\n– 2012: By no reason (Bikhod & Bijahat, director: Abdolreza Kahani)\n\n– 2011: I feel sleepy (Khabam Miad, as Reza, Director: Reza Attaran)\n\n– 2010: Whatever God Wants (Harchi Khoda Bekhad, director: Navid Mihandoost)\n\n– 2010: No men allowed (Voroode Aghayan Mamnoo, as Vahid Jebelli, director: Rambod Javan)\n\n– 2010: Absolutely tame is a horse (Asb Heivane Najibi Ast, as Behruz Shakiba, director: Abdolreza Kahani)\n\n– 2009: Az Ma Behtaroon (Director: Mehrdad Farid)\n\n– 2009: Nish O Zanboor (Director: HR Slahmnd)\n\n– 2009: Khoros Jangi (Director: Masood Atyabi)\n\n– 2009: Bad Az Zohre Saghie Saghi\n\n– 2008: Aghaye Haft Rang (Director: Shahram Shah-Hosseini)\n\n– 2008: Empty chair (Sandali Khalli, director: Saman Astrky)\n\n– 2007: Token (Neshani, director: Fereydoun Hassanpour)\n\n– 2007: Tasvie Hesab (Director: Tamineh Milani)\n\n– 2007: Tofighe Ejbari (as Ata, director: Mohammad Hossein Latifi)\n\n– 2007: Quarantine (Gharantineh, director: Manouchehr Hadi)\n\n– 2006: A hat for the rain Kolahi Baraye Baran (Director: Masood Navabi)\n\n– 2006: Tigh Zan (Director: Alireza Davoodinejad)\n\n– 2005: Havoo (Director: Alireza Davoudinejad)\n\n– 2002: Kolah Ghermezi Va Sarvenaz (Director: Iraj Tahmasb)\n\n– 2000: Cinderella (Director: Bijan Birang)\n\n– 1997: Sarzamine Sabz (Director: Bijan Birang)\n\nAwards\n\nBest Actor Award at the 2008 Gol Agha Comedy Festival\n\nCrystal Simorgh for Best Director in the New Vision section at the 30th International Fajr Film Festival for I feel sleepy (Khabam Miad), 2012\n\nStatuette for Best Actor at the 15th House of Cinema Awards for Absolutely tame is a horse (Asb Heivane Najibi Ast)\n\nStatuette of Golden Smile for Best Comedy Actor in the 2nd Sun’s Smile Awards for both Absolutely tame is a horse (Asb Heivane Najibi Ast) & No men allowed (Voroode Aghayan Mamnoo)\n\nDiploma of Honor for Best Actor at the 6th Critics & Writers Guild’s Awards for By no reason (Bikhod & Bijahat), 2012\n\nSources: Wikipedia | Reza Attaran, Reza Attaran | Biography, picbazi.com | The legendary Attaran, Iran Novin Film | Red Carpet – Director’s Biography\n\nSince his Internet hit, “Bad Shans” (hard luck), Hamid Saeid has become one of the best-known Iranian musicians with African roots. He’s travelling by motorbike across the province of Hormozgan, which is situated in the South of the country on the Persian Gulf, in order to realize his dream. He wants to organize a concert with the best black musicians in the country.\n\nBesides Persians, Indians, Arabs and Europeans, the province of Hormozgan, Iran’s “black south” has been influenced primarily by the descendants of slaves and merchants from Africa. Although Shiites, they still hold Voodoo ceremonies just as their African ancestors did and wakes in Hormozgan are more reminiscent of scenes from New Orleans, with the mourners dancing in an elated and joyous manner to black rhythms.\n\nFilmmaker Kamran Heidari accompanies Hamid Saeid as he attempts to make his dream come true. He must overcome numerous hurdles along the way: Hormozgan’s landscape, which is as inhospitable as it is breathtaking, traveling from the coast over rugged mountains to the desert, the African spirit rites; and the resistance of his wife, who is completely against his plan.\n\nIn an Interview Mr. Heidari talks about the healing tradition of Zar in the south of Iran: “There are wild winds (Dingomaro) coming from Africa and these winds are always in movement. Sometimes these winds take over ones body and then they will stay inside. This is when the Zar ceremony becomes necessary”.\n\nThe healers and masters of Zar ceremonies are called Mama Zar or Baba Zar, depending on gender, and by beating the drums and chanting MamaZar or BabaZar will drive these wild winds away. During the filming of the documentary, Kamran Heidari was asked many times to let Mama Zar drive the Dingomaro away from his body but he declined saying that he has made peace with these African wind spirits and has made friends with them. He would like to keep them in his heart.\n\nBy incorporating African rhythms into the music that he plays, Saeid succeeds in preserving his heritage that he then shares with others. But, at the same time, cultures are dynamic: by mixing African and Iranian beats, he is recreating traditions and moulding them into a new form of hybrid identity. Holding an ‘African-style’ concert in an area where many have rejected, or forgotten about their roots can be challenging. Heidari, together with Saeid, show us how to value this cultural heritage and give it a meaning through music. It was screened as part of the UCLA Celebration of Iranian Cinema in May 2014.\n\nDingomaro – Iran’s Black South (trailer):\n\nDirector: Kamran Heidari\n\nFilm by: Kamran Heidari, Dariusch Rafiy\n\nDoP: Sajjad Avarand\n\nCamera: Kamran Heidari, Bahman Kiarostami, Hasan Rastin\n\nEditor: Kamran Heidari, Martin Homel\n\nAssistant: Tahereh Alavizadeh\n\nSound Recording: Mohamad Hossein Kaveh\n\nSound Mix: Kamyar Behbahani\n\nPhotography: Tahereh Alavizadeh\n\nProducer: Dariush Rafi-y, Kambiz Khorram\n\nDocumentary / 66 min / Color / HD-Video / 16:9 / 2013 / IRAN\n\nSources: The Culture Trip | Kamran Heidari’s universal cinema beauty and humanity from Iran, Kamran Heidari Official Site | Films, Autentic | Dingomaro – Iran’s Black South, Blog Africa to Persia\n\nBorn in 1977, in Gachsaran, close to the old city of Shiraz, Heidari directs documentaries and films about the lives of the people who come from his region. In 2012, Heidari directed his very first full-length documentary about the life of the eccentric and touching figure of Negahdar Jamali from Shiraz.\n\nIn 2013, Heidari directed another documentary, also on the life of an eccentric and touching person with a dream; Hamid Saeed, one of the best-known Iranian musicians with African roots.\n\nOne day while I was taking photos in Shiraz’s old neighborhood near the bazaar where century-old houses were falling into ruin I saw some beautiful writing on a wall which said “don’t know”.\n\nI took a picture of the wall. As I was editing the photo and looking again at the writing it made me wonder about the person who wrote it? Did he or she write the words in a good mood or were they in a philosophical state of mind?\n\nRumi, the great Persian poet and philosopher wrote that “I” is a euphoric state — “What I know, what I know”. This “I” is what I think about when I take photos — it has become my overall concept for the Shiraz Street Photos series.\n\nThese old neighbourhoods serve as my photo workshop, the walls are my interior design and I carry my studio on my back. The subjects of these portraits stand in front of walls scrawlled with text — text full of sadness, happiness, pleasure, love, but also full of hope for life.\n\nApart from text, these walls incorporate other elements such as telephone and electrical cables, heater vents, and cracks, which make this environment even more attractive to me. These people represent the “don’t know” text on the walls. One can view them from an anthropological perspective — the geographic sections of the city of Shiraz become the backdrops for its’ inhabitants. In all of the photos the subjects look somewhat surreal.

Farhadi’s influence can be felt in a number of outstanding, tightly-wound contemporary dramas by emerging directors (Melbourne, I’m Not Angry), while others are charting radically different paths visually and narratively (Fish & Cat, 316).\n\nScreening schedule:\n\nSaturday, April 25\n\nTALES (Ghesse-ha) / 7:30 PM /\n\nIn person: Rakhshan Bani-Etemad (DIR)\n\nIran, 2014 / 91 min. / DIR: Rakhshan Banietemad /\n\nCAST: Fatemeh Motamed Aria, Peyman Moaadi, Baran Kosari\n\nWinner of the Best Screenplay award in Venice, writer, writer-director Rakhshan Banietemad’s return to fiction filmmaking is a tour-de-force portrait of a people and a society at the breaking point.\n\nSunday, April 26\n\nI’M NOT ANGRY (Asabani nistam!) / 3:00 PM\n\nIran, 2014 / 110 min. / DIR: Reza Dormishian /\n\nCAST: Baran Kosari, Navid Mohammadzadeh, Reza Behoudi\n\nDirector Reza Dormishian’s second feature bluntly depicts the seething frustrations of a generation through the emotional and personal struggles of a student activist trying to get his life on track.\n\nFISH & CAT (Mahi va gorbeh) / 7:00 PM /\n\nIn person: Shahram Mokri (DIR)\n\nIran, 2013 / 134 min. / DIR: Shahram Mokri /\n\nCAST: Babak Karimi, Saeed Ebrahimifar, Siavash Cheraghipoor\n\nWith Fish & Cat, writer-director Shahram Mokri emerges as an original new voice in Iranian cinema, blending bravura technical skills with a boldly absurdist, apocalyptic vision.\n\nMonday, April 27\n\nMY NAME IS NEGAHDAR JAMALI AND I MAKE WESTERNS / 7:30 PM /\n\nIn person: Kamran Heidari (DIR)\n\nIran, 2013 / 65 min. / DIR: Kamran Heidari / CAST: Negahdar Jamali\n\nUtterly unexpected and thoroughly charming, director Kamran Heidari’s debut documentary about an amateur filmmaker in southwestern Iran explodes preconceived notions and illuminates the universal power of cinema.\n\nFriday, May 1\n\nTODAY (Emrouz) / 7:30 PM\n\nIran, 2014 / 88 min. / DIR: Reza Mirkarimi /\n\nCAST: Parviz Parastui, Soheila Golestani, Shabnam Moghadami\n\nIran’s official submission for Oscar consideration, writer-director Reza Mirkarimi’s tense, powerful drama unfolds over a single day after a cab driver allows himself to be drawn into the personal crisis of a woman who jumps into his backseat.\n\nSaturday, May 2\n\nRED CARPET (Farshe Ghermez) / 7:30 PM\n\nIran, 2014 / 80 min. / DIR: Reza Attaran /\n\nCAST: Reza Attaran, Marc Ansari, Susan Parvar\n\nOne of Iran’s most famous comedians, Reza Attaran, takes on Hollywood and the international media in this hilarious but gentle satire.\n\nWednesday, May 6\n\nWHAT’S THE TIME IN YOUR WORLD?

Negahdar Jamali, an Iranian from Shiraz introduced himself the same way when I first met him without knowing John Ford that well.\n\n“MY NAME IS NEGAHDAR JAMALI AND I MAKE WESTERNS” he introduced himself with self-confidence and without any weakness in his statement; not in the Monument Valley or in the Grand Canyon but in Shiraz and the deserts surrounding the city. He has been making Western films continuously for the past 35 years under hard conditions, and this film is about the struggle with his family, friends and society to make what he likes the most in his life “Western Movies”.\n\nWhile “My Name is Negahdar…” might begin as an oddity it soon evolves into a moving tribute to a man who will let nothing separate him from his art. “I almost fell into the trap of making a social documentary but then I realised that with this film cinema is the only thing that matters,” said Heidari.\n\n“It is about a man and his love for cinema and for making cinema. His love for cinema is just so pure. He doesn’t want to make money out of them, he just wants to make these films and he puts everything he has into it,” he said. “It’s inspiring and a lot more honest to just tell his story.”\n\nMy Name Is Negahdar Jamali And I Make Westerns (trailer):\n\nDirector: Kamran Heidari\n\nCast: Negahdar Jamali\n\nMovie type: Documentary\n\nPhotography: Kamran Heidari\n\nEditor: Bahman Kiarostami\n\nSound recorder: Sasan Kaveh\n\nSound mix: Kamyar Behbahani, Farshid Zarmehr\n\nMusic selection: Ennio Morricone, Hamid Saeed\n\nProduction Manager: Tahereh Alavizadeh\n\nProducer: Mehrdad Monavarian\n\nColor, SD-Video, 16:9, 65 min, 2012, IRAN\n\nSources: Iranian Film Festival in Germany, The Daily Star Lebanon, My name is Negahdar Jamali and I make westerns (Photos), Kamran Heidari Official Site | Films\n\nFish & Cat (from Persian transliterated as Mahi va Gorbeh) is a 2013 mystery drama slasher Iranian film directed by Shahram Mokri. The film was first premiered at the 70th Venice Film Festival in September 2013.\n\n“Selected in 2014 for New Directors/New Films (the annual spring showcase from the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, USA), Fish & Cat heralds the emergence of a fresh and original new voice in Iranian cinema combining formal experimentation with a sly sense of humour.”\n\nShahram Mokri’s second feature initially seems as if it might be the first Iranian slasher movie, but things are not always as they appear. Filmed in one long, bravura shot by top cinematographer Mahmoud Kalari (A Separation), it plays mind-bending games with time and place while a pair of potential serial killer cannibals stalk a group of camping students at a lake.\n\n“In my short films I was trying to define a new meaning of time, of it being on one plane—very similar to the perspective Escher revealed in his paintings. I attempt to make type of experimental film that shows a new side of what the audience is used to seeing. On the other hand, Fish & Cat was produced due to my interest in slasher and genre films. I wanted to make a movie that would challenge our regular thoughts about time, and also one that used the same old genre structures. For Fish & Cat I took a real-life case and made it my own. It’s also a film that focuses on the Iranian youth generation. Because the film was been shot using just a single one, we rehearsed the film for two months exactly like we would have a theater performance. I decided to prepare with long rehearsals and we ran through the full movie twice a day. The actors do have theatrical backgrounds, so their experience being in front of an audience was helpful throughout.” – Shahram Mokri\n\nAwards\n\n– Special Prize, Venice Horizons Award: 70th Venice Film Festival (2013)\n\n– Best Film Award: Lisbon & Estoril Film Festival 2013\n\n– Muhr Asia Africa Special Jury Prize: Dubai International Film Festival 2013\n\n– FIPRESCI Prize and Youth Jury Award: Fribourg International Film Festival 2014\n\n– Best Film Award (International !f Inspired Competition) and SIYAD (Turkish Film Critics Association) Jury Award: 13th Istanbul Independent Film Festival (2014)\n\nFish & Cat (Mahi va gorbeh) (trailer):\n\nDirector: Shahram Mokri\n\nCast: Babak Karimi, Saeid Ebrahimifar, Siyavash Cheraghi Pour, Mohammad Berahmani\n\nProducer: Sepher Seifi\n\nExecutive Producer: Shahrzad Seifi\n\nScreenwriter: Shahram Mokri\n\nDirector of Photography: Mahmoud Kalari\n\nProduction Designer: Amir Esbati\n\nMusic: Christophe Rezai\n\nSound: Parviz Abnar\n\nProduction Company: Kanoon Iran Novin\n\nSources: Wikipedia | Fish & Cat, trigon-film.org (Photos), UCLA Happenings | Fish & Cat, The Hollywood Reporter, 13th !f Istanbul Independent Film Festival, Vancouver International Film Festival (VIFF) 2014 | Fish & Cat, Houston Iranian Film Festival | Fish & Cat\n\nShahram Mokri (Persian: شهرام مکری‎) is an Iranian writer and film director.
