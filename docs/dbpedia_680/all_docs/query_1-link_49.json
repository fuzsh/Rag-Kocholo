        "text": "Iran is Our Ideology\n\nI escaped Iran because the 1979 Revolution caused a seismic shifted in Iran’s politics. Iran at the time of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi was moving toward the epoch of Cyrus the Great. However, the 1979 Revolution shoved Iran toward the dark ages where superstitious ideas took over the scientific fields like medicine, astronomy, mathematics and social science like economics.\n\nThe revolutionary forces began to reveal true identity to people that they were ruthless individuals. They had no mercy, honour, and lack of reasoning. They did not have emotional intelligence. They were holding swords in their hands as the blood of innocent individuals leaked from the blade of their swords.\n\nThe revolutionary forces were proud of their bloodbath and deemed their behaviour to be divine. The above experiences left countless individuals with shock and awe. The strength of shock and awe overwhelmed numerous Iranians that they could not endure pain and suffering who accepted the self-imposed exile with no prospect of returning to Iran.\n\nThe diaspora found new countries as their adopted homes and wanted to live in a state of tranquility. They did not want to see an innocent person dragged in the street and faced barbaric punishment.\n\nThe diaspora heard a warning from Khomeini that he will export his revolution to the rest of the world. Iranian diaspora did not want to relive the 1979 Revolution one more time.\n\nThe regime in Iran began to deploy its Trojan Horses around the world. Each Trojan Horse selected a nation to plant the seed of the 1979 Revolution. They are working and are having families in their new countries like Rambod Javan.\n\nRambod Javan is a revolutionary person. He is the essential element of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who immigrated to Canada with his wife. They have a son who was born in Canada. Mr. Javan and his wife are in Canada not intending to make a new life for themselves but to pioneer the 1979 Revolution in Canada. Iranians lived in Canada and experienced the 1979 Revolution, and fled Iran for a better life in Canada; they are afraid of Javan. They knew Javan had a hateful heart; he was full of anger and resentment toward Western ideas and culture. He shouted death to America, death to the west. Then why was he in Canada?\n\nCanadian politicians from all sides of the political spectrum saw Iranians in the diaspora in a state of panic. Iranians did not feel indifferent about politics; the stagnant of Canadian politics received a handsome action from the diaspora community. Iranians made campaign contributions and took part in political life.\n\nCanadian politicians from different political factions enjoy seen Iranians are panicking. They call politicians to stop allowing individuals like Javan to come to Canada because Canada is becoming unsafe for them to live. Politicians do not care; it is about the tension in society, enabling them to elect to office. Politicians legislate laws to allow individuals like Javan or mullah Rafsanjani to come to Canada and make Canada their homes. Politicians have an attitude of I do not care. It is all about the well-being of politicians."
