        "text": "Instagram, the sprawling social platform, boasts nearly 50 million Iranian users. Within this vibrant community, individuals join for various purposes, each with their unique aspirations. Some are celebrities, others aim to leverage this social network for financial gain, and many simply gravitate to it for their personal reasons, although fake accounts do exist in this mix.\n\nOne common query that piques our curiosity is: Who reigns supreme as the most-followed figure on this dynamic platform in Iran? What makes this individual the crowned king or queen of Instagram, captivating the hearts of Iranians across the nation?\n\nIn this enlightening piece by howdiscover.com, we embark on a journey to introduce you to the most prominent personalities on Iranian Instagram. Together, we’ll uncover the captivating reasons behind their colossal followings, shedding light on their extraordinary popularity.\n\nHave those who have the most followers in Iran bought followers?\n\nThis is an incredibly challenging question! Have famous Iranian people bought followers on Instagram, or is it better to say how many of the followers of big Iranian pages are fake?\n\nThere are many sites to check the fake followers of Instagram pages, which can be used to determine the number of inactive followers of the pages.\n\nBut in general, buying Instagram followers has recently become popular among famous people on Instagram, and many celebrities, especially Iranian and even foreign actors, buy fake followers and likes for their Instagram posts. Now you might say to yourself, is it not harmful for their page?!\n\nIf the number of followers of a page is very high (for example, 500 k), fake followers will not be seen very much!\n\nAnd even the page interaction rate may not decrease. For this reason, in this case, buying fake followers does not harm the page and many famous people buy fake followers on Instagram.\n\nThe list of people who have the most followers on Instagram in Iran\n\nIn this list, I am going to introduce you to 15 people who have the most followers on Instagram among the Iranian community. I will start with the 15th person in this list. Who do you think is the first person on this list?\n\n1. Serna Amini\n\nSerna Amini is a prominent figure in Iran’s entertainment industry, known for her talents as a comedian, social media influencer, and YouTuber. With her engaging content, she has successfully captivated a substantial following on platforms such as Instagram.\n\nBorn on January 19, 1972, in Mashhad, Serna Amini has rapidly gained popularity through her Instagram account, which boasts an impressive two million followers. Despite her relatively short time in the digital sphere, she quickly made a name for herself by sharing humorous videos and entertaining dubs on her personal page. Her comedic style has resonated with audiences, contributing to her growing success.\n\n2. Navid Mohammadzadeh\n\nNavid Mohammadzadeh is the 15th person in this list with 8.7 million followers.

You may know him by playing in the movie “Delnawazan” with Shah Rukh Ashtari.\n\nHe was one of the most popular actors and has 11.6 million followers, and maybe the reason for having this number of followers is the same.\n\n10. Rambod Javan (rambodjavan1)\n\nYou must know Rambad Javan from the funny show khandevaneh.

By publishing parts of his laughter concerts on Instagram, he makes his audience and Instagram users laugh and happy.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll these people that I introduced to you have gained this position on Instagram in different ways, but the high number of followers of these people is not a proof of the usefulness of their content.\n\nChoose carefully who you follow on Instagram. The more useful and valuable content you see, the more you will feel the positive impact of seeing useful content in your life."
