        "text": "TEHRAN – Tehran Peace Museum and House of Cinema condemn the non-combatant massacres occurring Gaza Strip, exhibiting their concern for the escalating violence, and impel an expeditious termination to the bloodshed through an immediate ceasefire.\n\nIn a joint statement published on Sunday, more than 100 signatories, including chemical warfare veterans from Tehran Peace Museum, as well as artists, filmmakers, and intellectuals from the House of Cinema asked for the end of the violence in Gaza and an immediate ceasefire.\n\nThe statement, which is addressed to Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, reads as follows:\n\n\"In the name of God,\n\nMr. Antonio Guterres, the honorable Secretary-General of the United Nations,\n\nAs Iranian artists, together with chemical warfare veterans and survivors of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), we humbly request that you exert all possible efforts to prevent the blatant injustice being inflicted upon the women, children, and innocent civilians who are besieged in Gaza.\n\nMr. Guterres, the position you hold represents the conscience of human history today and its impact will be judged by future generations. In the name of humanity, stop the war.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nTehran Peace Museum - House of Cinema Iran\n\nNovember 12, 2023.\"\n\nThis statement has been signed by several well-known figures such as Davud Mirbaqeri, Majid Majidi, Parviz Parastui, Reza Kianian, Leila Hatami, Homayoun Asadian, Kamal Tabrizi, Mohsen Tanabandeh, Rambod Javan, Alireza Davoudnejad, Farhad Tohidi, Ahmadreza Darvish, Rasoul Sadrameli, Mohsen Amir Yousefi, Hadi Hejazifar, Mohammad Hossein Mahdavian, Mohsen Kiaee, Shabnam Moqaddami, Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, Seyed Reza Mir-Karimi, Majid Entezami, Amir Esbati, Afsaneh Baigan, Hanieh Tavassoli, and others.\n\nNew names will be announced in subsequent updates.\n\nSince October 7, Hamas launched Operation Al-Aqsa Storm in response to the escalating Israeli abuses against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. As a result, Israel has been conducting airstrikes on the Gaza Strip. Shockingly, more than 10,000 Palestinians, with 4,800 of them being innocent children, have fallen victim to these devastating Israeli bombings.\n\nIsrael's relentless bombings on Gaza have taken an alarming toll on the lives of the civilian population. The sheer number of casualties, especially children, is deeply concerning and highlights the immense suffering inflicted upon the Palestinian people."
