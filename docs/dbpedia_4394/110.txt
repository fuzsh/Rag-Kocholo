About Shade Empire

Since 1999 Shade Empire have strived to forge their own sound. Hailing from Finland, the band inked a deal with Italian label Avantgarde Records for the release of their first critically acclaimed album Sinthetic (2004). Success was to follow in 2006 with their follow- up release Intoxicate O.S, which had been recorded at the famous Studio Perkele, and in its opening week achieved position 25 in the official Finnish charts. Their third release, concept album Zero Nexus (2008) took them higher into the Finnish charts, debuting at no 15. Fourth album Omega Arcane (#13 in the album charts) was released via Candlelight Records in 2014 with Poetry Of The Ill-Minded (#16th) following in 2017.

Sunholy (2023) is a long-aged piece of art and labour of love. Embodying the most comprehensive Shade Empire effort to date, the lyrics are thematically inspired by the Jonestown tragedy, a mass murder-suicide of the Peoples Temple cult, but there's also a fuller contemplation and exploration of the current state of the world.

After a long-endured absence, Shade Empire have returned as grandiose experts in their craft, with an astounding soundtrack to Hell's gates opening and a band relishing being at the top of their game.

The band has toured with bands such as Unleashed, Krisiun, Borknagar, Hate and Keep of Kalessin and appeared at numerous festivals worldwide. More tours and shows all over the world are being expected.
