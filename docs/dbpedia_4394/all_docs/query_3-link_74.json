        "text": "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire quietly released on digital platforms today, less than two months after the movie opened in theaters.\n\nDirected by Gil Kenan, who also co-wrote the script with Jason Rietman, this reboot sequel marked the return of Ghostbusters OGs Bill Murray and Dan Akykroyd, who joined the younger cast that includes Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Celeste O’Connor, and Logan Kim. The sequel to 2021’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife was not the runaway success Sony hoped it would be. But it still made $195 million at the global box office, and to be clear, that’s a modest hit! Maybe that’s why Sony opted to keep the movie in theaters for two months, rather than the one-month theatrical run is the new norm for most major studios. Even the popular Jennifer Lawrence comedy from Sony, No Hard Feelings, was available to buy and rent online after one month in theaters.\n\nBut before you buy or rent Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire on digital, you should know that Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will likely be on Netflix very soon. Here’s what to know about the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire digital release, including where to watch Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire on streaming, and when Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will be on Netflix.\n\nHow to watch Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire on streaming:\n\nBeginning on Tuesday, May 7, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is now available to buy and rent digitally on Amazon Prime, Google Play, Apple TV, Vudu, and more. The price may vary depending on which platform you use to purchase the film, but on Amazon Prime the movie costs $19.99 to rent, and $24.99 to buy.\n\nThe digital release of Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire comes with a host of bonus features, including deleted and extended scenes, Easter Eggs, and a commentary with director and co-writer Gil Kenan. It will also include the following “making of” special features: “Return to the Firehouse: Making Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,” “Busted: Capturing the Ghosts of Frozen Empire,” “Manifesting Garraka,” “New York, New Gear,” “Welcome to the Paranormal Discovery Center,” and “Knowing the Score.”\n\nThe Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire DVD release date has not yet been announced.\n\nWhen will Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire be streaming on Netflix?\n\nUPDATE 7/8/2024: Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will stream on Netflix on July 22, 2024, according to the streamer’s upcoming titles carousel. Netflix ain’t afraid of no ghosts!\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire will likely be on Netflix before the end of summer of 2024. Netflix has a deal with Sony Pictures that gives the streamer the rights to the Sony movies in the “Pay 1” window, meaning the first streaming window after the film’s home media release. Other recent Sony movies, including The Pope’s Exorcist, No Hard Feelings, came to Netflix about four months after opening in theaters. Sony’s most recent movie, Madame Web is coming to Netflix on May 14— just three months after opening in theaters. If Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire follows a similar release strategy, you may see Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire on Netflix around late June 2024 (three months after the movie opened in theaters) or July 2024 (four months after the movie opened in theaters).\n\nIn the meantime, you can watch Mike from Stranger Things bust those ghosts by buying or renting the movie on digital platforms. Bustin’ make him feel good, no doubt."
