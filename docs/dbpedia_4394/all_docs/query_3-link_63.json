        "text": "Website: www.shadowoftheempires.com Argent Archives page: https://www.argentarchives.org/node/211390\n\nFounded in and active since 2013, the guild was originally named ’ Zandalari Empire’ after the Zandalari’s efforts to reunite the trolltribes. With the release of BfA in 2018 and the meaning of the Empire in this expansion, we found this name to be no longer suiting, and are now known as Shadow of the Empires !\n\nWe are still a troll-only for trolls from all tribes. We to aim explore the diverse, rich and sometimes clashing cultures and beliefs of those who are left of the great troll empires, providing an alternative for following the Dark Prophet Zul, the blasphemous traitor who treats the divine, sacred Loa as aids for his grab at power.\n\nWhat is Shadow of the Empires?\n\nShadow of the Empires was formed by those who believe in the dream of seeing the trolltribes united once more, and wished to offer an alternative future to trolls who did not wish to join the legion of the Prophet Zul. They took residence within the walls of Zul’Gurub and began amassing trolls to the sacred city.\n\nThey came from far and wide; remnants of dying tribes, those disillusioned by their leadership and survivors of the losses that took place on Pandaria. Remnants of the once great empires began to grow and flourish, worship of the Loa central to the lives of all within the city. Their numbers are ever-growing as Zul makes more and more mistakes and the values of those who live under the Horde are threatened by their new leadership. Devout trolls flock to the Jewel of the Jungle and the steadfast servants of the Loa carve a new era in history.\n\nOOC Goal\n\nThe guild has been active without hiatus since 2013 and above everything we wish to continue to provide a stable and active environment of non-horde aligned troll roleplay with a diverse mix of tribal life, Loa worship, combat, missions and voodoo!\n\nThe guild focuses heavily on individual character growth of the trolls within our ranks and long-lasting, personal plots where each troll has an opportunity to shine and work towards their goals. Both experienced and new roleplayers or those new to troll lore are more than welcome.\n\nRanks\n\nShadow of the Empires follows a general Zandalari hierarchy of power. The system is not as merciless as the caste system we see in Zandalar, however. Prioritizing the many Loa of the different tribes that risk being forgotten with dwindling numbers of trollkind, trolls are encouraged to grow to their full potential, no matter their previous experience or past.\n\nMystics. Those of the mystical inclination are generally of higher status and power compared to the warriors. Priests and Scholars are the core of the tribes and oversee the functioning of those below them.\n\nSpears. Warriors are expected to be strong and defend those who cannot defend themselves. This does not mean, however, that warriors are not expected to be religious – Loa worship is an integral part of every aspect of troll culture.\n\nTribestrolls. These are the farmers, fishers and craftsmen - all have a role to play to ensure the functioning of the ever-growing numbers of trolls gathering within Zul’Gurub.\n\nWe have a detailed ranksytem for the different paths both Mystics and Spears can take. The page is currently offline as it is being revamped with a few new lore titbits and classes we’ve seen in BfA, and will be up before the end of the month!\n\nEvents\n\nWe host around 3 events a week. Events are often a combination of plotlines, training sessions and Loa-themed evenings. Bigger campaigns that last a few weeks are held twice a year. A few examples:\n\nSpear Training: Training sessions for the warriors of the Empire. Ranging from spars to missions, from weapon training to improving strength and stamina, this event is open for all trolls who wish to develop their skills as a Spear.\n\nMystic Training: The partner event of Spear Training meant for those who focus on the mystical arts of voodoo: aspiring hexxers, menders, witchdoctors and others who wish to master the Loa’s gifts are advised to attend to these trainings regularly. The subject can differ each time: from learning how to cast spells as a group to more practical lessons such as salve making or tending to deadly venom bites.\n\nLoa teaching and offerings: A lore exposition event, to teach both trolls and players about the religion of Trolls. At the beginning of each month, the trolls gather at Hir’eek’s Rise to listen to a stories about the Loa. Based on the Loa covered in the teachings, trolls have a full month to prepare a sacrifice or offering. More often than not these events turn into a competitions who can make the best offering and gives every troll a moment to shine or fail.\n\nLegacy of the Empires: Heavy plotbased events, that progress from week to week, that give the players a big plot line that random role-play can be centred around. From curses to preparing wars, these are the events that influence the tribes the most.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhich tribes and races are accepted?\n\nWe accept trolls from almost every tribe seen in WoW; Zandalari, Ice Trolls, Forest Trolls, Jungle Trolls and Sand Trolls. The full list including subtribes can be found on the FAQ on our website.\n\nWe do not accept:\n\nNon-trolls. We are first and foremost a troll only guild – other races can only joins as OOC alts;\n\nHalf breeds, trolls from made-up tribes and tribes only mentioned in the RPG books;\n\nBlood Trolls, Dark Trolls and Drakkari.\n\nBoth Dark Trolls and Drakkari are confirmed to be close to extinction in Battle for Azeroth. The guild has never allowed Dark Trolls, but you will find a (very small) number of Drakkari within our ranks. These trolls have roleplayed deserters of Zul’s army during MoP or have otherwise joined us during a time where it was still safe to assume some Drakkari roamed the world. We do not want to force people to retcon or delete characters they have developed over years, at the same time we wish to stay as close to lore as possible and reflect the tribe’s rarity in roleplay. New Drakkari applications are therefore declined. **\n\nDo you roleplay on Horde territory or in Horde campaigns?\n\nNo. Roleplay takes currently place in Zul’Gurub and its surrounding jungles unless the plot of the guild requires us elsewhere. Playing non-horde aligned trolls with us comes with roleplay on neutral territory only, and we wish for new applicants to take this into account before joining us! Most of the tribes are sworn enemies of the Horde and the trolls from horde-aligned tribes that are with us are often branded traitors by their original tribe. Roleplay plots might send one or two trolls hailing from Horde-aligned tribes to Horde territory, but this is an exception, not a rule.\n\nRecruitment and Applications:\n\nYou can join the guild by filling in the application form on our website. If you have any questions or wish to brainstorm concepts with us, do not hesitate to contact one of our officers ingame! (Azuak, Dahti, Thallow, Zelujin)\n\nAfter an application is accepted, a two-week trial period starts. It offers you the opportunity to find out whether you enjoy roleplaying with us. Similarly, it allows us to see if you and your character fits Shadow of the Empires. After the trial period you will be invited to our Discord and are a full-fledged member of the guild!"
