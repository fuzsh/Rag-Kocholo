        "text": "Candlelight Records have confirmed details of the fifth album by SHADE EMPIRE; Poetry of the Ill-Minded will be unleashed on June 30, 2017. Pre-orders are available HERE.\n\nHailing from Kuopio, Finland, and already in their eighteenth year as a band, SHADE EMPIRE work unspeakably brutal guitar patterns, multi-layered and yet beautiful synth walls into ingenious arrangements. Throw in mind-bending electronics, devastating drum parts, complex bass assaults and the unique vocals, and you have something coming straight from the deep pits of hell!\n\nThe band have notched up various tours alongside the likes of Unleashed, Krisiun and One Man Army And The Undead Quartet. SHADE EMPIRE’s last album Omega Arcane was a heavily orchestrated concept album and took the band´s sound to a whole new level when it was released in 2014. The album went on to reach number 13 in the Finish album charts."
