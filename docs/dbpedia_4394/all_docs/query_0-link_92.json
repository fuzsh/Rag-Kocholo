        "text": "URNE release new album \"A Feast On Sorrow\" and focus track \"A Stumble Of Words\".\n\n\"A Feast On Sorrow\" out now via CANDLELIGHT RECORDS.\n\nLondon metal trio URNE have released their new album A Feast On Sorrow via Candlelight Records. This deeply personal studio album is a stark rumination on the grim inevitabilities of disease, dementia and deterioration in old age. In celebration of the release, URNE have also shared the album's focus track and visualiser for 'A Stumble Of Words'.\n\nWatch the visualiser for 'A Stumble Of Words' here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xJ1BR8Jv8A\n\nStream A Feast On Sorrow here: https://urne.lnk.to/AFeastOnSorrow\n\nOn 'A Stumble Of Words', Joe Nally comments:\n\n\"For me, 'A Stumble Of Words' is the best song myself and Angus have written, be it in URNE or any other projects. Making longer-crafted songs is what we do best, and we love to see where we can take a song and also, where can we take future listeners. We drew from a number of influences for this song - personally speaking, I drew from our last album, Serpent & Spirit, Tom Keifer and Queensryche. We also listen to a lot of movie scores, so that always seeps in when approaching longer songs.\"\n\nThere are times in life when it feels like darkness will consume the light. Suffering. Loss. The emptiness that follows. An upended hourglass trickling inexorably into the cold shadow of the great hereafter, devouring not only those closest to us, but all the decades of knowledge and memories they held dear. At a distance, we can steel ourselves against the grim inevitabilities of disease, dementia and deterioration in old age, but when more intimately faced with their impact, it becomes easy to imagine some hidden demon gorging on the misery wrought. It was in circumstances such as these that Joe Nally began work on URNE’s savage second album A Feast On Sorrow. “There were a lot of dark times,” the frontman sighs, reflecting on two family members afflicted by degenerative illness. “Losing people is a horrible thing; when the reality hits, it shocks you. I was full of pent-up emotion – anger, confusion – and I could only seem to release that through aggression. That’s meant this record is much more aggressive. It’s a lot darker. There were quite a few ‘fun’ elements to our first LP Serpent & Spirit. There aren’t many of those here.”\n\nJoe Duplantier, frontman of modern metal goliaths, Gojira, unexpectedly reached out to the band directly, - having been a fan of the band’s debut album, Serpent & Spirit - offering URNE the opportunity to record with him at his Silver Cord studio in Brooklyn, New York. Joe Nally adds, “We had many ups and downs throughout this process, but the end result is something the three of us are extremely proud of. Having the honour to travel to New York to work alongside Joe Duplantier and Johann Meyer on this record is something we didn’t think would be possible and, on top of that, to have Ted Jensen master this record, has been an experience we once dreamed of. This whole album is extremely personal for me. It’s made me grow as a person and has also helped me understand the grieving process better than before. This isn’t a joyful or uplifting record, it’s very raw and real, and when the opportunity to work with Joe came to be, we all knew he was the perfect person to capture the message of this record.\"\n\nFollowing the band's appearance at this year's Bloodstock Festival, fans will be able to catch URNE performing as part of the Copenhell Metal Cruise event, scheduled for October 2023.

The track is taken from their sixth studio album, Sunholy, set for release on 15th September via Candlelight Records.\n\nNew album Sunholy is set for release on 15th September via Candlelight Records.\n\nCheck out the single ‘Maroon’ here: Shade Empire - Maroon (Official Lyric Video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOYD7eP3Qa8\n\nPre-save Sunholy here: https://CandlelightRecords.lnk.to/ShadeEmpireSunholy\n\nThe band comments: \"We think that 'Maroon' is one of the finest compositions of our career so far. This is not just a song but a journey that requires you to hopefully stop by and listen. 'Maroon' proves also that Henry is one of the most versatile vocalists in Finland as this track showcases his wide scale.\"\n\nFormed in Kuopio, Finland in 1999, SHADE EMPIRE have developed their own genre, an unholy fusion of symphonic melody interwoven with black and death metal overtones, emotionally rich vocals and tight orchestral instrumentation. New album Sunholy features nine towering tracks of atmospheric beauty, barbed with unspeakably brutal guitar patterns, multi-layered beautiful synth walls, devastating drum parts, complex bass assaults and unique vocals that are delivered straight from the jaws of hell. Fans of Dimmu Borgir, Marduk, Septicflesh and Dark Tranquility will find something here.\n\nMixed by Chris Edrich (Devin Townsend, Leprous, Alcest) and mastered by Pierrick Noël (Klone), with Fleshgod Apocalypse's Francesco Ferrini responsible for the orchestrations and Andy Reich at Collapse Of Art completing the artwork, Sunholy is a long-aged piece of art and labour of love. Embodying the most comprehensive SHADE EMPIRE effort to date, the lyrics are thematically inspired by the Jonestown tragedy, a mass murder-suicide of the Peoples Temple cult, but there's also a fuller contemplation and exploration of the current state of the world.\n\nAfter a long-endured absence, SHADE EMPIRE have returned as grandiose experts in their craft, with an astounding soundtrack to Hell's gates opening and a band relishing being at the top of their game.\n\n\"Sunholy\" Tracklisting:\n\n1. In Amongst The Woods\n\n2. The Apostle\n\n3. This Coffin an Island\n\n4. Sunholy\n\n5. Torn Asunder\n\n6. Maroon\n\n7. All-Consuming Flame\n\n8. Profane Radiance\n\n9. Rite of Passage\n\nAbout SHADE EMPIRE:\n\nSince 1999 Shade Empire have strived to forge their own sound. Hailing from Finland, the band inked a deal with Italian label Avantgarde Records for the release of their first critically acclaimed album Sinthetic (2004). Success was to follow in 2006 with their follow-up release Intoxicate O.S, which had been recorded at the famous Studio Perkele, and in its opening week achieved position 25 in the official Finnish charts. Their third release, concept album Zero Nexus (2008) took them higher into the Finnish charts, debuting at no 15. Fourth album Omega Arcane was released via Candlelight Records in 2014 with Poetry Of The Ill-Minded following in 2017. The band have toured with bands such as Unleashed, Krisiun, Borknagar and appeared at numerous festivals worldwide.\n\nSHADE EMPIRE are:\n\nHenry Hämäläinen – vocals\n\nJuha Sirkkiä – guitars and keys\n\nEero Mantere – bass guitar\n\nErno Räsänen – drums\n\nAapeli Kivimäki - guitars\n\nSHADE EMPIRE online:\n\nhttps://shadeempire.com\n\nhttps://www.candlelightrecords.co.uk\n\nQuelle: Head Of PR"
