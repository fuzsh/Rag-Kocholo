        "text": "Off Records Finland is a Finnish (what a surprise?) metal/punk label that is part of Firebox Agency 'family', so here's some short news regading their activities.\n\nFinnish dark/goth rockers Gotham O.D. have released new videoclip called Blame. The track appears on their debut album Monochromatic, that was just released for distribution on GAS territory by SPV GmbH.\n\nThe band will do a short tour in late October with Agency mates Dark The Suns.\n\nThe new videoclip can be viewed at youtube.com:\n\nFinnish melodic death/dark metal band Manufacturers Pride is right now in studio recording their second album for Off Records. Update from the band: We have recorded everything except some vocal parts for the upcoming album Sound of God's Absence! What I have heard so far it's going to be way more massive and darker than the debut, it won't make your Novembers any brighter.\n\nYou can check out their studio diaries at youtube:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcAhCdU0Cvg\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKK3Nf_6mk8\n\nThis old interview just passed one year anniversary, but it's still worth checking out: http://www.lethalconflict.com/?page=interview&pid=281\n\nManufacturer's Pride update\n\nWe're really busy at the moment. Album is almost recorded and it's going to be stunning. There's also some awesome quest vocals, so be prepared because there's no God on November! Some free goodies are on the way for all of you about month before album release, but we're not going to reveal anything more about it now. Some new videomaterial is coming too, like new part of diary and music video.\n\nYou can also reach the band at Facebook.\n\nManufacturer´s Pride news:\n\nALBUM RELEASE DATE POSTPONED TILL FEBRUARY 2009!\n\nSound of God's Absence release date postponed till February 2009!\n\nWe have decided to postpone the release of the upcoming album till the next February, for it is more favourable time for the album than November. Some samples will still be released on November 26th, for example free downloadable internet single \"Murder Mandate\". All the other announced dates will remain the same, album's pre-listening in Inferno, Jyväskylä 14.11.2008 and the album's release gig, Lutakko, jyväskylä 5.12.2008, where we will play all the new material. More reason to attend the show!\n\nGotham O.D´s new album on the way\n\nThe band is working on the new songs for the second studio album. The composing has been going on practically since the release of the debut, and the guys have very much material ready to work on. These various ideas have been molding into full songs at a few rehearsing sessions during\n\nthe end of the year 2008. These sessions have been taking place in the countrysides peace at Kerimäki and in Pieksämäki rehearsing room.\n\nNew, yet unnamed album is due to be released in September 2009, and the recordings are planned for the spring. As stated before, Firebox/Offrecords will be in charge of releasing. Firebox will also handle the distribution in Finland.\n\nMore information will be given later on the production, so stay tuned!\n\nThe guys are doing a few shows while recording the album, and naturally they will do a tour in the fall promoting the new release."
