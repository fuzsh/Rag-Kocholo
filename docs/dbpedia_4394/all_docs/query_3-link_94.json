        "text": "Summary: Nar Shaddaa is a neutral city-covered moon controlled by the criminal Hutt Cartel. Both the Republic and the Empire conduct clandestine operations here, hoping to gain allies and influence in the galaxy’s shadowy underworld.\n\nNar Shaddaa, the city-covered so-called “smuggler’s moon” orbits the Hutt homeworld of Hutta and is dangerous, unethical, wealthy, sleazy, and glamorous, depending which parts you frequent. A seedy twin to Coruscant, the lower city is dark and dangerous, while the upper city embodies wealth and decadence; presenting an endless parade of glittering neon towers and floating casinos. Behind this facade, criminal organizations thrive, rubbing shoulders with legitimate businesses drawn by a lack of regulation and ethical oversight.\n\nThe Republic, though officially disdainful of this activity, just as often turns a blind eye when these same corporations bring their innovations back to Republic space. Data slicing is a booming industry and gangsters, pirates, slavers and worse crowd the streets. The city has a notorious murder and disappearance rate.\n\nAlthough the Hutt Cartel prohibit open warfare, the Empire and the Republic both conduct espionage operations here, fighting among the dank shadows and superficial glitz for influence among the Galaxies criminal elements. As they spy on and sabotaging one another’s efforts from the shadows. the ultimate goal of both sides is an exclusive alliance with the powerful Hutt cartels.\n\nSummary: The artifact you seek belongs to Lord Paladius, who controls a cult of Nar Shaddaa’s most disadvantaged citizens. You work with two ex-members to undermine him.\n\nBeneath the glittering towers of Nar Shaddaa lies a dark and poverty stricken network of slums. Zash bids you use the people’s hopelessness and desperation against them as leverage as you search for Tulak Hord’s artifact.\n\nThe artifact itself is called the Eye of Tulak and currently belongs to the Sith Lord Paladius. Paladius is a cunning Sith, who has created his own cult of zealous followers among Nar Shaddaa’s disadvantaged population. Zash has contacted Destris Veran and Rylee Dray, two former cultists who are willing to work against Paladius for the promise of taking over the cult for themselves.\n\nYou travel to Lucent Square on the Promenade and enter an Old Storefront to find Paladius himself berating Destris and Rylee via holo before setting his Screaming Blade cultists on them. You defend them and repell the attack. Destris is unimpressed but Rylee warns him to show due deference.\n\nDestris explains that the key to toppling Paladius is to gain the support of the poor and disadvantaged citizens he exploits. Paladius gained this support by taking out the most vicious gang he could find, and the same method should work for you. Destris suggests taking down the powerful Krayt gang by killing its leader, Saben.\n\nRylee, on the other hand, suggests a different approach. A deadly plague called ‘the Rot’ is running rampent in the slums. Anyone who cures it will be seen as a prophet and a hero. This would involve stealing the cure from Tydis Neutronics and distributing it in the Corellian Sector.\n\nYou decide which approach to take.\n\nSummary: The Eidolon manages a large security firm that does business with the Republic. You attack his weapons shipments to place him in debt and draw him out.\n\nGele’ren is intreagued at the audacity of your task. The Eidolon used to work for him and his masters in the Hutt Cartel, though no-one ever met him face to face. At the height of his fame, the Eidolon decided to open a security company. Suddenly half of Nar Shaddaa’s corporations became his clients and stopped paying the Hutt Cartel protection money.\n\nAt this point a young man, Anuli walks in and is amazed to see Mako, who he knew growing up. Anuli is one of Gele’ren’s best slicers and a great fence.\n\nGele’ren believes the key is to draw the Eidolon out by destroying his business. His top client is the Republic, who recieve billions of credits of munitions from Eidolon Security every year. A shipment is waiting in a manufacturing facility right now and Gele’ren and Anuli suggest you blow it up with baradium charges, putting the Eidolon in debt.\n\nYou travel through the Corellian Sector to Eidolon Armaments and take on the security force (Making Them Pay | Bonus Quest). You find and open some blast resistant crates to expose the contents (Maximum Yield | Bonus Quest) and plant the explosives on power generators 1, 2 and 3 and the central computer. Before you blow the charges, you are confronted by a scientist who begs for time to evaculate the staff. If you are incredibly evil you can refuse and kill him.\n\nYou return to Gele’ren.\n\nSummary: The terrorists are trying to aquire a dangerous stimulant called Cyclone. You meet the brilliant Watcher X, an ex-agent who was imprisoned on Nar Shaddaa when his intelligence became a threat, and obtain a Cyclone sample.\n\nIn orbit of Nar Shaddaa, you contact Watcher Two. Nar Shaddaa is a major criminal trade hub and the Eagle’s terrorists use it to produce and distribute weapons and technology. To help you root them out she has enlisted the aid of a former intelligence operative codenamed Watcher X who used to be one of the Empire’s most capable analysts.\n\nEventually he absorbed so much data that he began inferring conspiracies and connections where none existed. Judged unstable he was confined to Shadow Town, the Empire’s open prison on Nar Shaddaa. This is where the Empire confines people who know too to be set free, but who may be useful to it later.\n\nYou speak with Watched X in his cell the High Profile Ward of Shadow Town. He warns you to always be vigilant and trust nothing. Like all Shadow Town inmates, he has a bomb implanted in his head that will detonate should he attempt escape.\n\nHe has discovered that the Eagle’s terrorists are attempting to acquire mass quantities of a new genetic modification serum called Cyclone. Cyclone improves speed and focus but causes long term damage to the user. He wants you to purchase a sample of the drug from a shop in the Corellian Sector for analysis. In order to pose as a Cyclone user, he offers you an optional injection that will mimic the effects of long-term genetic damage but temporarily weaken you.\n\nOnce inside the Augmentation Shop off Coronet Boulevard, you speak to the owners, Nautolans Sabaya and Ekayn Liistot. They have clearly been manipulating desperate people with tales of fighting strength.\n\nIf you took the injection, they offer to fix your bad augmentations and genetic damage for a price. You ask them who makes the Cyclone; they deal with a middleman but they direct you to the last person who bought some, an Evocii who wanted to die gloriously fighting slavers. You find her corpse near the Exchange Headquarters and take a sample of her Cyclone-loaded blood.\n\nAlternatively, if you threaten Sabaya and Ekayn directly or you did not take Watcher X’s injection, they and their clients attack you. After defeating them, they offer you the cyclone, as well as protection money and anything else you want to leave them in peace.\n\nWatcher X contacts you. After admiring the world done in the Augmentation Shop, he asks you to analyse the blood sample at an abandoned medical laboratory in the Duros Sector.\n\nSummary: Despite being sold out to Ukabi by a member of the Shadow Syndicate, you kill him and eliminate the Exchange threat. The Shadow Syndicate reaffirms its commitment to the Empire.\n\nYou return to the Shadow Syndicate Safehouse where Ukabi is making threats via holo. Whichever actions you took, he is unconcerned, telling you he will have your head by dawn. Godoba continues to blame Maro Vizhen for the whole debacle. She claims to have a new strategy (you can express skepticism). From captured gangsters, she has learnt of an Exchange tunnel system beneath the sector and she advocates wiping them all out by using it to attack Ukabi’s base. The Shadow Syndicate approves, though Maro and Vaarko warn you that Ukabi’s inner circle is cybernetically enhanced and equal to a dozen Mandalorian warriors.\n\nYou defeat the Exchange forces inside Ukabi’s headquarters (The Final Assault | Bonus Quest), along with Ukabi’s four lieutenants; Tanith, Xandral, Shandar and Monkabi. You shoot the door controls to access Ukabi’s private chambers only to find them empty. Contacting Maro, you find her desperate; Ukabi is there and the Exchange is attacking the Shadow Syndicate safehouse.\n\nYou return to find that Godobba the Hutt has sold you out. Ukabi boasts about his cortosis skin grafts, intravenous kolto injection system and holographic targeting array and attacks. Despire his boasts, you kill him in combat.\n\nGodobba reveals that entire Shadow Syndicate agreed to offer Maro Vizhen to Ukabi after her incompetence brought him down upon them. They collectively offer you a reward to kill her so that a more capable contact might take her place.\n\nYou can refuse and capture Godoba for the Empire as an example for the rest of the Syndicate. In this case, Maro Vizhen thanks you for your assistance before later sending you a mail informing you that the Syndicate is being restructured into a more Imperial-friendly configuration. Vaarko Tiyai has proved highly competent at giving the Empire a negotiating advantage while the DX annihilator network has already removed multiple targets. Godoba remains in Imperial custody and she sends you a gift from Vaarko’s private reserves.\n\nAlternatively you can take the Syndicate’s offer and kill her, in which case the syndicate re-affirm their support for the Empire, promise to crush your mutual enemies, and anticipate the return of local Exchange activities.\n\nSummary: You arrange for a staged groundquake beneath the hall where Paladius is rallying his followers.\n\nYou head to your new base of operations at Stress House on the Promenade to be confronted by Gar Nok, a Weequay enforcer working for Paladius. Apparantly the people are calling you the Great Healer or the Great Dragon depending on your recent choices. He attacks and you easily dispatch him.\n\nDestris introduces you to a Screaming Blade cultist who has defected to you and who presents you with a gift for your recent efforts (Cultist Praise | Reward). It seems you are beginning to form a cult of your own.\n\nPaladius is holding a large meeting at a place called Meridian Hall in order to rally his cult. Rylee suggests that you attend the meeting and create a groundquake on demand to prove your power over Paladius. If you blow up the gas pipes beneath the hall, it should create the disired effect. On Destris’ suggestion you head to the Nar Shaddaa Works Administration offices in the Duros sector to meet with the engineer Gord Madel, who should be receptive to bribary.\n\nGord Madel concludes some under the table dealings with a gangster and asks what you want. Although he is not above taking bribes, he is very reluctant to blow up the pipes, an action that will bring the local gang leaders down on him and his family as well as destroy his career. You can persuade him in three different ways, with force lightning, with force persuasion, or with the promise that you will protect him and his family by allowing them to live in Strell House and benefit financially from your cult. He gives you a signalling device to use when you want the groundquake triggered and you head for Meridian Hall.\n\nSummary: You put the screws on a company executive and discover the identity of the front corporation that the terrorists use to manufacture Cyclone.\n\nYou travel to the abandoned Mututech Labs in the Rana’Innuli District of the Duros Sector. After clearing out some anti-empire renegades who are squatting at the premises (Militant Looters | Bonus Quest), you use a bioscanner to analyse the Cyclone sample and contact Watcher X who traces its origin to Synchet Industries. Synchet industries manufactured droids, food supplements and medical supplies but went bankrupt 5 years ago. He tracks down a former executive for you to question. On his suggestion, you make an undetectable poison and its antidote from the supplies around you in order to blackmail him.\n\nYou travel all the way to the glitzy Star Cluster Casino where Jordel Tlan keeps his offices. His twi’lek secretary, Netula Pahn is arguing with a protocol droid, JT-02 about scheduled repairs and bemoans the state of Jordel’s technology. It seems Tlan bailed her out of some debt and takes good care of her. Here you have several choices:\n\nChoice 1 – You can lie and say you are a maintenance engineer responding to complaints from the casino, or a Cartel agent doing a security check, or just that want to examine the serving droid with a view to buying one yourself. Either way, she will allow you to look closely at the droids and you take the opportunity to slip the poison into Tlan’s drink. Tlan contacts her via holo gasping for air and admonishes her secretary for not protecting him.\n\nHe tells you that Synchet was bankrupted during the war and was sold off to multiple parties. You give him the antidote and he continues – A group who paid in cash and used fake names bought a medical subsidiary of Synchet called Vervegen and seemed particularly interested in it’s genetic modification serums. He believes they are still in charge and that VerveGen’s headquarters are in the Upper Industrial Sector. He has no further knowledge or involvement so you let him go.\n\nChoice 2 – You badger Netula to let you meet Tlan but do not use the poison. In this case you can extract the same information from him either by saying you work for the Empire, the Hutt Cartel or if you are female, by flirting with him.\n\nChoice 3 – You don’t meet with Tlan at all, but rather flirt with Netula and take her for a drink in the Casino. Afterwards, you can convince her her boss is in trouble and ask her if Synchet ever had dealings with terrorists. She tells you that after the war, Tlan and his partners were strangely desperate to sell it and that one buyer in particular raised some flags. They had credits, but seemed shady. They were only interested in a medical subdivision of Synchet called VerveGen and Tlan has had no dealings with them since.\n\nThis all sounds like conclusive evidence that the terrorists are using the subdivision to manufacture Cyclone. You thank her for the help.\n\nWatched X contacts you and compliments you on your exemplary field work. He wants you to slice into public access terminals near the VerveGen building so that he can spy on the company.\n\nSummary: You end the threat posed by the Flame and his followers to the Empire’s operations on Nar Shaddaa, either by wiping them out or convincing them to leave the moon peacefully.\n\nFelth discovers from the reports that the Flame is planning to attack Admiral Ange. She wants to hide this from him to protect her career, but Ange appears in person and admonishes her; he has already surmised that the Flame has been monitoring his communications and wants him dead. He wants you to accompany him to a meeting with the Hutts where your reputation should prove intimidating. He plans to give them an ultimatum: Either they deal with the Flame’s rebellion or the Empire withdraws billions of credits in business from the Nar Shaddaa.\n\nYou leave ahead of his motorcade to clear a path, killing the Flame’s alien riflemen, slicers and enforces in the Duros Slums (Snuff Out the Flame’s Forces | Bonus Quest) and lighting three beacons to show your progress before entering the Duros warehouse where the meeting is to take place. You discover that the Flame has overpowered the Imperial delegation and taken the Admiral prisoner. He is revealed to be a Gen’Dai, a member of a race whose homeworld and people were devestated by an unprovoked Imperial invasion led by Admiral Ange himself.\n\nThe Flame feels compelled to defeat the Empire and fight for the aliens of the Duros sector, many of whom have a similar story. Either you kill the Flame and his followers or you show mercy and allow them to leave Nar Shaddaa in peace to look for a new home, on the condition they never take up arms against the Empire again.\n\nAt Post Drazaal, Admiral Ange has already informed Agent Felth of your actions. She is pleased if you killed the flame and scattered the rebellion. After all, if the fate of every conquered planet were mourned, the Empire would never have been built. However, she is also surprisingly understanding if you spared him, admitting there are reasons why the Empire might be hated, and that perhaps second chances are warranted.\n\nIf you spared them, Intelligence reports indicate that the Flame and his followers relocate to the Outer Rim world of Garqi to become farmers. The Empire has no plans to pursue and even Admiral Ange is pleased. Your business here concluded one way or the other, she passes on word from General Kolvin of the Imperial Reclamation Service who wants your help in Nar Shadaa’s main industrial area.\n\nSummary: You track down a security expert and retrieve certain codes that will allow you to break into Eidolon Security’s records.\n\nGele’ren reveals why he is helping you take down the Eidolon. If you manage with his help, the Hutt Cartel will make him a boss with his own clan. Anuli also tells you that he is sick of being treated like garbage and that Mako has promised him safe passage to the next planet aboard your ship. Both she and Anuli are overjoyed if you agree, and Mako promises to return the favour. She is greatly dissapointed if you refuse despite Anuli’s help.\n\nAnyway, the Eidolon is remaining quiet so you need to ramp up your provocation. Gele’ren suggests that you make Eidolon Security’s private records public, exposing his clients’ dealings and weaknesses. This would involve travelling to Network access and retrieving some codes from a Bith HoloNet security expert named Zee K’lin.\n\nZee works for Nebula Communications in the Upper Industrial Sector. You crash through the front door and take out the security (Causing Battle Fatigue | Bonus Quest). You subdue one of the guards by taking out his droid protection and he tells you Zee is making a run for Mezanti Spaceport. You decide whether to kill the guard or let him go before cutting Zee off in Docking Bay 27.\n\nZee gives you the codes, though he belivies in doing so he has doomed you both by invoking the Eidolon’s wrath. You kill him or let him leave and return to Gele’ren and Anuli.\n\nSummary: You infiltrate a highlevel meeting at VerveGen where the terrorists manufacture Cyclone, and kill several terrorist leaders, severely damaging their operations on Nar Shaddaa.\n\nYou travel to the Large Scale Production Facilities area of the Upper Industrial Zone and slice the North, Southeast and Southwest public terminals before returning to Watcher X in Shadow Town.\n\nHe explains that Imperial Intelligence fear him so much they will never offer him freedom in exchange for his help. He is compelled to help anyway because his mental conditioning causes headaches that last for days if he disobeys a superior.\n\nUsing the surveillance you arranged at VerveGen, he has confirmed that the terrorists are preparing a large quantity of serum for transport and distribution. The VerveGen staff are also preparing to beef up security in preparation for a visit from the owners. This means that terror cell leaders are gathering; a prime opportunity to attack.\n\nWatcher X has a plan to disguise you holographically as a class-five droid, allowing you to slip into the meeting unnoticed. To do this, he needs your permission to implant you with cybernetic implants designed to mask your organic lifesigns. Reluctantly you agree and he performs the operation.\n\nIn your droid disguise, you enter the VerveGen building and make your way to the executive offices on level 2 where you listen in on the meeting. Several executives lead by Raythen Predot are reporting directly to the Eagle via holocomm about the progress made with Cyclone; no matter what they do, it is still fatal. The Eagle is unconcerned, remarking that any terrorists who use it understand the necessity of sacrifice. He commands VerveGen to use smugglers distribute it to other cells in the network.\n\nYou can either burst in during the conversation or wait for it to finish, at which point your disguise is detected anyway. If you burst in, the Eagle orders you killed. If you want to be nice, you can allow the VerveGen execs to leave before you start shooting terrorists. When the shooting stops, only a single terrorist remains alive, a cyborg named Aphel Jaarn.\n\nWatcher X suggests you to route him into the cyborg’s cortical implant so that he can slice his brain for information on how to destroy the terrorist communication hub. This would severely hamper their ability to rebuild on Nar Shaddaa. Aphel begs you not to slice his brain and if you agree, tells you that the hub is in Network Acess, grid seven-alpha, module five, protected by droids. Afterwards you can kill him, let him try to leave on his own, or heal him first to his surprise.\n\nIf you allow Watcher X to slive Aphel Jaam’s brain he gives you Alphel’s life story – at 16 he came to Nar Shaddaa from Dantooine, earnt his cybernetics working for the Exchange. At 19 he was recruited by the Eagle’s terror cell on Nar Shaddaa. They connected him to the communications hub and gave him codes and patterns that now belong to Keeper. Alphel’s mind is severely damaged. You may kill him as an act of mercy, or let someone find him alive.\n\nYou head to Network Access to find the hub.\n\nSummary: You explore Revan’s secret compound and find a shard of the Star Forge still worshipped by the descendents of his ongree followers.\n\nFor your assistance in disabling its security, General Kolvin allows you to be the first to enter Revan’s facility and recover its secrets.\n\nYou travel to the abandoned factory where lies Revan’s mysterious complex. Fighting through his army of droids (Stop the Moving Parts | Bonus Quest), you find three holographic recordings made by the Ongree servants Reven sealed inside. The first recording was made many centuries ago by an Ongree who knew Revan personally. He talks of Revan’s incredible power in the Force, and of something called the Infinite Engine. Apparently this device, whatever it does, is powered through the force by the feelings and thoughts of the Ongree themselves and even at this point they had become totally reliant on it to provide for their basic needs (Explore Revan’s Past | Bonus Quest (Stage 1).\n\nThe second recording was made centuries later by an Ongree who finds it hard to imagine his ancestors ever lived beyond the complex walls or away from the beneficence of the Infinite Engine. Each new Ongree child is dedicated to the machine which also absorbs the Ongree dead to produce more energy. This Ongree wonders if this would seem strange in a reality where they had not sworn service to Revan, but the point is moot (Explore Revan’s Past | Bonus Quest (Stage 2).\n\nThe final recording is of an Ongree imploring his brethren to keep faith and not to change their lifestyle before ‘the sign’; they have lived this way for 20 generations, believing that a great someone will come seeking the machine, an event which they prepare each new generation to confront (Explore Revan’s Past | Bonus Quest (Stage 3).\n\nExploring further you discover Revan’s own journal wherein he records the incredible power of the Star Forge, an ancient force powered space station built by the long-vanished Rakata capable of creating infinite legions of star ships (Explore Revan’s Past | Bonus Quest (Stage 4).\n\nWhen the Star Forge was destroyed 300 years ago, Revan kept a single shard of its power which he planted on Nar Shaddaa. Though not capable of creating starships, the shard nonetheless feeds on the force to create air, life, food, clothing, tools, weapons, droids and more. Revan concludes with the thought, “Why bother with ships when one day we may create our own galaxies.”\n\nIn the heart of the facility, the living descendents of Revan’s Ongree servants still worship the Infinite Engine and await his return. Their leader, Azraj-Nug welcomes you. He tells you that the Infinite Engine was but the size of a fingernail when they first arrived and sustained few, but over the generations it has grown to the size of an Ongree and sustains many.\n\nYou can claim the device for the Empire, in which case he objects; in his mind only those who nurture the Engine and serve Revan may benefit from it. Furthermore, without the device to sustain them, the Ongree will die, having become totally dependent on it over the centuries. They are, however, willing to give you a seed. Like the one from which it grew, the seed will require generations of careful cultivation but will one day grow into an Infinite Engine of its own. You can agree to this deal and leave the Ongree in peace, in which case they take the Engine and the remnants of their people still deeper into the facility, or you can kill them all and take the Engine by force.\n\nIf you return with only the Infinite seed shard, Kolvin asks why you didn’t wipe out the slaves and take the whole thing. You can argue that the slaves are guarding a powerful weapon and should not be provoked, or simply that the mission orders were not that specific. You can also protect the Ongree by lying that the slaves were already dead, the shard is all you found and there is nothing more to be gained inside the complex. He is somewhat disappointed but glad to at least receive something from the operation and sends the shard to Dromund Kaas for study.\n\nIf you brought back the entire device, he is extremely pleased, doubly so if you eliminated loose ends by killing the slaves or leaving them to slowly perish, as he wants to occupy the compound. In this scenario, Kolvin later contacts you to say that the device has already begun to produce weapons of an unknown alien design and is expanding at a molecular level. You are asked to keep the entire mission confidential. Whatever you did, he passes on a request for help from his colleague Major Damarus in the Network Access sector and you leave.\n\nSummary: You prevent Rathari from aquiring a key Republic base by killing his men, and procure the promise of a favor from the Republic Commander.\n\nYou confront Lord Rathari atop the satellite tower deep in Network Access, killing his apprentices and Imperial guards to reach him (Rathari’s Entourage | Bonus Quest). He arrives with Baras’s spy Agent Dellocon, who objects to being murdered by Baras just for reassurance. Rathari reneges on his promise of a duel and springs his elite guard upon you only to find them attacked by Commander Naughlen and his men. (If you never made your deal with the Commander, you kill them all yourself). With everything on the board, Rathari attacks you.\n\nAfter an epic duel, you subdue Rathari and he yields to your greater power. He murders Dellocon, hoping that it may buy him the chance to serve you. He promises to assist you when the time comes for you to destroy Darth Baras. You can make him your minion, demand that he leave the Empire and never return, or kill him and be done with it.\n\nCommander Naughlen asks if he and his men can leave. You agree with thanks, or murder him in front of his men, sending them home without him. Your companions look forward to leaving Nar Shaddaa for good and you return to your ship.\n\nDarth Baras praises your work. Though he regrets the death of Halidrell Setsyn, power depends on seeing the big picture. With both of his compromised agents dead, he redirects your attention to the matter of Nomen Karr and his padawan. Apparantly your ship is being tracked and Baras has traced the signal to a spaceport near your location. During this conversation you can enrage him so much with impudent behavior that he almost force chokes you to death.\n\nSummary: You finally defeat Lord Paladius and obtain the Eye of Tulak. You also leave Nar Shaddaa in control of a siezable cult of your own.\n\nDestris is amazed at the number of followers you have aquired. One of your cultists appears with a communication from Lord Paladius who’s men threatened to kill him if he did not deliver it. You can kill him yourself for his cowardice if you wish.\n\nPaladius claims to be willing to give up the artifact if you leave him in control of what remains of his cult. He suggests a meeting at his headquarters in Network Access and asks you to bring Rylee and Destris with you. Though no-one believes in his good will, Rylee convinces everyone this is a good chance to deal with him once and for all.\n\nYou travel to Paladius’s sanctuary in Network Access. He greets you cordially but it seems he has betrayed you and found a way to drain your connection to the force. Though your powers are diminished, you best him in lightsaber combat and drive him to his knees defeated.\n\nHe offers you the artifact in exchange for his life and asks to be allowed to manage your cult on your behalf. Destris and Rylee object, having been offered the leadership by Zash. He makes a good case that as Sith, he will obtain more power and influence for you than they ever could, but he is clearly untrustworthy. It’s your decision.\n\nIf you agree, Destris and Rylee are once again under Paladius’s control and you can even kill Destris for objecting. Paladius now controls the cult and reports to you.\n\nIf you disagree and keep to the original deal, then you kill Paladius and allow Destris and Rylee to control the cult in your name. Rylee is quite taken with you and hopes that you return soon.\n\nYou return to your ship and report to Darth Zash.\n\nSummary: You discredit the Eidolon’s company by uploading his client’s records to the holonet, but in revenge he kills Mako’s friend Anuli.\n\nAnuli vouches for the accuracy of Zee’s codes, and marks the ones that will disable security if uploaded to a tranceiver in the Eidolon Datacenter. Gele’ren gives you a HoloNet transmitter that will allow Anuli to upload the Eidolon’s files straight to the holonet once you compromise his main network.\n\nIn the Secured Systems district of Network Access, you enter the Eidolon Datacenter and shoot your way past his security (Industrial Insecurity | Bonus Quest). You upload Zee’s codes to the tranceiver, lowering the Eidolon’s security so that Mako can slice into his network. It’s a challange even for her. The Eidolon’s people know their stuff. When she gets inside, Anuli uploads his files to the holonet and you turn to leave, only to find the Eidolon Security Captain blocking your path. He confirms that Zee tried to sell you out but was killed anyway and attacks.\n\nAfter you defeat his team, Anuli contacts you in a panic. The Roughneck room is under attack by the Eidolon. Even if you tell him to run, he is too terrified and stays on the line as he is killed. You return to find his body. Mako is distraught; all he wanted was a better life. Suddenly Eidolon assassin droids decloak and ambush you. After taking them out, you comfort (or dismiss) Mako, and activate a holocommunicator left by the Eidolon, who contacts you personally.\n\nSummary: You finally confront and take down the Eidolon, deciding if he deserves an honourable death or if you will hand him over to the Hutt Cartel alive for torture. The Huntmaster’s Assistant asks you to travel to Dromund Kaas for a private meeting.\n\nThe Eidolon, a male zabrak, tells you Gele’ren is already dead and you are next. He offers to meet with you and sends you coordinates, planning to kill you as soon as you arrive.\n\nYou travel to his safe house near Shadow Town and kill his personal guard (Professional Killer | Bonus Quest). Eventually, in a large room, you find the Eidolon himself. He is impressed you still live and asks why you are hounding him. You can tell him for credits, for the challenge, or refuse to tell him at all. Either way he considers you a rare and precious opponent and regrets having to kill you. Just as you are about to fight, Mako receives a huge bounty offer from a Cartel Lieutenant named Solash for bringing in the Eidolon alive. You defeat him in an epic confrontation.\n\nHe asks you to kill him, and appeals to your sense of honour as an equel not to hand him over to the Cartel for torture. It’s up to you. You can also make Mako decide in which case she asks you to kill him; no-body deserves what the Cartel would do to him. You can also make her kill him herself, which she does, or reject her suggestion and freeze him for transport anyway.\n\nIf you agreed to take him alive, then you meet with Solash and hand him over. Solash is very impressed and tells you the Hutt Cartel will be watching your career with interest.\n\nBack aboard your ship, Mako asks if you are no different to the Eidolon, killing people for money. You can claim to be different, only killing the bad guys, or agree you are the same. Mako hopes you are more that he was. You contact Crystal Markon to report back.\n\nInstead of Crysta, you are put through to Huntmaster Assistant Lek. Your bounties on Balmorra and Nar Shaddaa are complete. Your next two are on Alderaan and Tatooine. However, before you get started, he requests that you return to Dromund Kaas for a private discussion. Mako informs you this is extremely unusual and against protocol for the Huntmaster’s Assistant to communicate with a contestant.\n\nSummary: You infiltrate a highlevel meeting at VerveGen where the terrorists manufacture Cyclone, and kill several terrorist leaders, severely damaging their operations on Nar Shaddaa.\n\nYou travel to the Terror Cell’s Communications Hub in Network Access and shoot your way past the White Wing terrorists inside (Ending the Terror Cycle | Bonus Quest). After taking out the terrorist leader, you destroy the hub and with it the terrorist’s ability to rebuilt their operations on Nar Shaddaa.\n\nWatcher X calls to congratulate you but reveals that the destruction of the network hub also caused Shadow Town security to fail long enough for him to escape. He has used you to break free. He offers a deal; tell Watched Two that he remains imprisoned and he will share his secrets, everything Intelligence hides from its operatives, with you. Kaliyo, your companion, feels strongly that you should track him down and kill him to prevent him manipulating you.\n\nWatcher Two contacts you and is aware of your work against VerveGen but is concerned about the possibility of Watcher X escaping. Here you make your choice:\n\nChoice 1 – If you refuse his deal admit that he did, she orders you to the spaceport fast to cut him off, noting that she has no authority on Nar Shaddaa to delay departing ships. You race to docking bay 66 and find him there. He reluctantly fights you, but warns you that no-one makes it out of the spy game. Kaliyo expresses regret that he tried to manipulate you; his information could have been valuable. Watched Two calls for an update and is extremely relieved that you prevented Watcher X from escaping. She and him had almost the same training, and came from the same genetic enhancement program, but Watcher X was the better and the smarter. She understands well what he was capable of.\n\nChoice 2 – If you accept his deal then you lie and tell her he is still in custody. She is relieved and apologises for making you work with him. If you do this, Kalyio is absolutely disgusted, to the point of threatening you. Watcher X occasionally sends you tidbits of information from now on.\n\nYou return to your ship.\n\nSummary: In the Network Access data core you find a being named Axis absorbing the galactic information flow. You may let him live in exchange for providing the Empire with secrets, or kill him to protect the integrity of the holonet.\n\nYou enter the Hutt data center and kill the remaining guard droids inside (Droid Wipe | Bonus Quest). When you open the security door that leads to the central core. you discover an Anomid named Axis in the center of the core, protected by a security forcefield.\n\nPlugged directly into the dataflow, Axis is absorbing the Galaxy’s information (and secrets) and offers to relay everything he learns to the Empire in exchange for leaving him alone. He believes it would be illogical to refuse him and equally irrational for him not to honour the agreement, as you could reach him again if he reneged. However, the Hutts would object to his presence and so you must explosively overload the main generators in order to fake his death. The backup generator will remain operational to power his shields, ensuring his survival.\n\nFirst, you activate the nearby security lockdown terminal, making sure that no-one gets in or out and that your ruse goes undetected. Then you systematically overload the three main generators in the data center, Do, Dopa and Duba. Finally, you access backup generator Fwanna. Here you have the choice of following Axis’ plan or really killing him, thereby protecting the Empire’s secrets at any cost.\n\nIf you kill him, Damarus tells you that the Hutt backup systems are coming online; the holonet survives and the Ministry of War will remember your assistance. If you agreed to Axis’s arrangement, Major Damarus has already been contacted by him and is impressed, having received the travel itineraries of every Republic senator for the next six months. The Hutts remain unaware of the arrangement."
