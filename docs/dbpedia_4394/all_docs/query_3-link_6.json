        "text": "Finnish symphonic extreme metallers Shade Empire are celebrating the release of their new album Sunholy, which is out now via Candlelight Records, with a brand new video and single 'Torn Asunder'.\n\nIt's the fourth single to be released from Sunholy, accompanied by a stunning cinematic video of Shade Empire in their natural habitat - the breath-taking landscapes of Finland. Filmed by Oliver König of mbience visuals, amid snow capped mountain peaks and dense forests, the video is the embodiment of the emotional soundscape portrayed in the song.\n\nCheck out the single/video ‘Torn Asunder’ here: https://youtu.be/Xmn1fXZEWB8?si=WeQM3gXUJfPoo-Zn\n\nOrder Sunholy here: https://CandlelightRecords.lnk.to/ShadeEmpireSunholy\n\nThe band are also celebrating their new release with a surprise extended orchestral edition of the album, Sunholy Extended, which is available as a digital release only.\n\nThe band comments: \"Sunholy is our sixth album and it's been six years after the latest release. Many things have changed in the world and also in our band since. We've had some line-up changes and changed our lead singer. Henry Hämäläinen is one of the most versatile singers in Finland and brings so much variability to the album. Compositions have also developed even more so Sunholy is our most diverse album so far. We have always wanted to go forward musically rather than do the same album over again.\"\n\nFormed in Kuopio, Finland in 1999, Shade Empire have developed their own genre, an unholy fusion of symphonic melody interwoven with black and death metal overtones, emotionally rich vocals and tight orchestral instrumentation. New album Sunholy features nine towering tracks of atmospheric beauty, barbed with unspeakably brutal guitar patterns, multi-layered beautiful synth walls, devastating drum parts, complex bass assaults and unique vocals that are delivered straight from the jaws of hell. Fans of Dimmu Borgir, Marduk, Septicflesh and Dark Tranquility will find something here.\n\nMixed by Chris Edrich (Devin Townsend, Leprous, Alcest) and mastered by Pierrick Noël (Klone), with Fleshgod Apocalypse's Francesco Ferrini responsible for the orchestrations and Andy Reich at Collapse Of Art completing the artwork, Sunholy is a long-aged piece of art and labour of love. Embodying the most comprehensive Shade Empire effort to date, the lyrics are thematically inspired by the Jonestown tragedy, a mass murder-suicide of the Peoples Temple cult, but there's also a fuller contemplation and exploration of the current state of the world.\n\nAfter a long-endured absence, Shade Empire have returned as grandiose experts in their craft, with an astounding soundtrack to Hell's gates opening and a band relishing being at the top of their game."
