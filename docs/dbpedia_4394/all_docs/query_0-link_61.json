        "text": "Finnish symphonic extreme metallers SHADE EMPIRE announce new album \"Sunholy\".\n\nFinnish symphonic black metallers Shade Empire have announced their sixth studio album \"Sunholy\" will be released on 15th September via Candlelight Records.\n\nAhead of the release the band have unveiled their captivating new video for first single, \"In Amongst the Woods\".\n\nCheck out \"In Amongst The Woods\" here: https://youtu.be/LcOATNVijkA\n\nPre-save \"Sunholy\" here: https://CandlelightRecords.lnk.to/ShadeEmpireSunholyPR\n\nFormed in Kuopio, Finland in 1999, Shade Empire have developed their own genre, an unholy fusion of symphonic melody interwoven with black and death metal overtones, emotionally rich vocals and tight orchestral instrumentation. New album \"Sunholy\" features nine towering tracks of atmospheric beauty, barbed with unspeakably brutal guitar patterns, multi-layered beautiful synth walls, devastating drum parts, complex bass assaults and unique vocals that are delivered straight from the jaws of hell. Fans of Dimmu Borgir, Marduk, Septicflesh and Dark Tranquility will find something here.\n\nComments the band: \"Six years after the release of Poetry of the Ill-Minded, we are pleased to present you with our new album \"Sunholy\". We are very excited to let our fans hear what we have been up to. The record is brutality and beauty in perfect harmony.\"\n\nMixed by Chris Edrich (Devin Townsend, Leprous, Alcest) and mastered by Pierrick Noël (Klone), with Fleshgod Apocalypse's Francesco Ferrini responsible for the orchestrations and Andy Reich at Collapse Of Art completing the artwork, \"Sunholy\" is a long-aged piece of art and labour of love. Embodying the most comprehensive Shade Empire effort to date, the lyrics are thematically inspired by the Jonestown tragedy, a mass murder-suicide of the Peoples Temple cult, but there's also a fuller contemplation and exploration of the current state of the world.\n\nAfter a long-endured absence, Shade Empire have returned as grandiose experts in their craft, with an astounding soundtrack to Hell's gates opening and a band relishing being at the top of their game.\n\n\"Sunholy\" Tracklisting:\n\n1. In Amongst The Woods\n\n2. The Apostle\n\n3. This Coffin an Island\n\n4. Sunholy\n\n5. Torn Asunder\n\n6. Maroon\n\n7. All-Consuming Flame\n\n8. Profane Radiance\n\n9. Rite of Passage\n\nAbout Shade Empire:\n\nSince 1999 Shade Empire have strived to forge their own sound. Hailing from Finland, the band inked a deal with Italian label Avantgarde Records for the release of their first critically acclaimed album \"Sinthetic\" (2004). Success was to follow in 2006 with their follow-up release \"Intoxicate O.S\", which had been recorded at the famous Studio Perkele, and in its opening week achieved position 25 in the official Finnish charts. Their third release, concept album \"Zero Nexus\" (2008) took them higher into the Finnish charts, debuting at no 15. Fourth album \"Omega Arcane\" (#13 in the album charts) was released via Candlelight Records in 2014 with \"Poetry Of The Ill-Minded\" (#16th) following in 2017. The band have toured with bands such as Unleashed, Krisiun, Borknagar and appeared at numerous festivals worldwide.\n\nShade Empire are:\n\nHenry Hämäläinen – vocals\n\nJuha Sirkkiä – guitars and keys\n\nEero Mantere – bass guitar\n\nErno Räsänen – drums\n\nAapeli Kivimäki - guitars\n\nfollow Shade Empire online:\n\nhttps://shadeempire.com\n\nGlobal doom supergroup MMXX release \"The Next Wave\" EP today.\n\nGlobal doom metal supergroup MMXX have released their new EP \"The Next Wave\" today via Candlelight Records. The band have also dropped two videos for remaining tracks \"Echoes\" feat. Alicia Nurho and \"Isolation\" feat. Mikko Kotamäki (Swallow the Sun).\n\nCheck out the video, \"Echoes\" feat. Alicia Nurho: https://youtu.be/Nhtcb_Frpfg\n\nCheck out the video \"Isolation\" feat. Mikko Kotamäki (Swallow the Sun): https://youtu.be/WepT-gaGWQs\n\nStreaming and purchase options here: https://mmxx.lnk.to/TheNextWave\n\nBorn during the initial worldwide lockdown and incubated as the seasons passed, doom metal supergroup MMXX began as the sound of global isolation. Not unlike the pandemic itself, MMXX has long harboured an unseen chapter: “The Next Wave“. The full three song EP includes the metallic and driving “Isolation“ featuring Mikko Kotamäki (Swallow the Sun), and the melancholic and ethereal “Echoes“ featuring Alicia Nurho. “The Next Wave“ EP will be released on vinyl by Candlelight Records and like its 2022 full-length predecessor Sacred Cargo, contains stunning artwork from Portuguese fine-art photographer Henri Prestes.\n\nComments the band: \"The spirit of MMXX is a profound expression of sonder, realising that each passer-by on the street has a complex life and story just as rich and intricate as your own. The pandemic is the chapter of this story we've told, through the voices and words of collaborators across the globe. \"The Next Wave\" contains three songs, unique from one another but together forming a powerful epilogue for this entire endeavour greater than their parts. Huge thanks to Mikko Kotamäki (Swallow the Sun), Mick Moss (Antimatter), and Alicia Nurho for contributing your talents.\"\n\nThe Next Wave EP Tracklist\n\n1. Isolation feat. Mikko Kotamaki (Swallow the Sun)\n\n2. Alone feat. Mick Moss (Antimatter, Sleeping Pulse)\n\n3. Echoes feat. Alicia Nurho\n\nAt the core of MMXX is Andrea Chiodetti (ex-The Foreshadowing) on guitars and keys, Jesse Haff on drums (Daylight Dies and Gökböri) and Egan O’Rourke on bass (Daylight Dies). Together they channelled inspiration for composition after composition to collaborate with a geographically, culturally, and stylistically diverse collection of celebrated vocalists and musicians from around the world.\n\nMMXX’s debut offering, \"Sacred Cargo\" (2022), displayed the project’s signature multifarious approach to doom metal with new EP, \"The New Wave\", building upon the foundations laid by its predecessor with a newfound conviction.\n\nMMXX are:\n\nAndrea Chiodetti - Guitar/Keys\n\nJesse Haff - Drums\n\nEgan O’Rourke - Bass\n\nfollow MMXX online:\n\nhttps://www.mmxx.band\n\nQuelle: Head Of PR"
