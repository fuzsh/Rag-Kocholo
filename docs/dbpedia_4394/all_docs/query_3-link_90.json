        "text": "It is customary for scholars to remind their readers that the Empire was not one uniform expanse. But were Britons at the beginning of the twentieth century oblivious to the multifarious nature of the British Empire? This paper surveys the ways in which different parts of the British Empire were represented to the British public before the First World War, as well as to what extent these representations changed after the Second World War. A narrow range of source material has been selected for this survey to allow for a more detailed qualitative examination of the individual artefacts. The conclusion is that prior to the First World War the colonies of settlement—the Dominions—took centre stage in representations of the Empire, by being pivotal to the defence of the Empire, and by being linked to Britain by a tie of blood. Exploitation in the ‘tropical empire’ was recognised as valuable to Britain, but those colonies were not part of what could be called ‘the British family’. There was a marked shift in how the Empire was represented to Britons after the Second World Ward. In films and satirical TV, the former empire of domination rather than the empire of settlement became central to representations of the legacy of the Empire. It is suggested that the imagined imperial community before the First World War ceased to be sustained by cultural manifestations in Britain after the Second World War. To some extent, this might add to the various explanations for Britain's pulling up the drawbridges to the former Dominions during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThis article argues that during the closing decades of the nineteenth century a significant group of British imperial thinkers broke with the long-standing conventions of political thought by deliberately eschewing the inspiration and intellectual authority provided by the examples of the ancient empires. While the early Victorian colonial reformers had looked to the template of Greece, and while many later Victorians compared the empire in India with the Roman empire, numerous proponents of Greater Britain (focusing on the settler colonies, and associated in particular with the movement for imperial federation) looked instead to the United States. I argue that the reason for this innovation, risky in a culture obsessed with the moral and prudential value of precedent and tradition, lies in contemporary understandings of history. Both Rome and Greece, despite their differences, were thought to demonstrate that empires were ultimately self-dissolving; as such, empires modelled on their templates were doomed to eventual failure, whether through internal decay or the peaceful independence of the colonies. Since the advocates of Greater Britain were determined to construct an enduring political community, a global Anglo-Saxon polity, they needed to escape the fate of previous empires. They tried instead to insert Greater Britain into a progressive narrative, one that did not doom them to repeat the failures of the past.\n\nDrawing upon the work of Norbert Elias and the process [figurational] sociology perspective, this article examines how state formation processes are related to, and, affected by, expanding and declining chains of international interdependence. In contrast to civic and ethnic conceptions, this approach focuses on the emergence of the nation/nation-state as grounded in broader processes of historical and social development. In doing so, state formation processes within the United Kingdom are related to the expansion and decline of the British Empire. That is, by focusing on the functional dynamics that are embedded in collective groups, one is able to consider how the UK’s ‘state’ and ‘imperial’ figurations were interdependently related to changes in both the UK and the former British Empire. Consequently, by locating contemporary UK relations in the historical context of former imperial relationships, nationalism studies can go ‘beyond’ the nation/nation-state in order to include broader processes of imperial expansion and decline. Here, the relationship between empire and nationalism can offer a valuable insight into contemporary political movements, especially within former imperial groups.\n\nThe history of the rise, decline, and fall of the British Empire has most often been told as the story of an empire whose foundations lay in India during the second half of the eighteenth century. That empire formally encompassed parts of south Asia, Australasia, Africa and the Americas. Its ascent began with British victory at the battle of Plassey in continued almost unabated in South Asia and the Pacific until the end of the Napoleonic Wars resumed momentum in the latter half of the nineteenth century during the European ‘scramble for Africa’, and then unraveled definitively during and after the Second World War. William Pitt was its midwife, Lord Mountbatten its Sexton and Winston Churchill was its chief-mourner in Britain. Its ghost lives on in the form of the Commonwealth; its sole remains are the handful of United Kingdom Overseas Territories, from Bermuda to the Pitcairn Islands. In this account, the American Revolution, and its aftermath divided the two (supposedly distinct) Empires, chronologically, geographically and institutionally. The Peace of Paris that ended the Seven Years War marked the end of French imperial power in North America and South Asia. Twenty years later, the Peace of Paris by which Britain acknowledged the independence of the United States of America marked the beginnings of newly configured British Atlantic Empire, still including the Caribbean islands and the remaining parts of British North America; it also signaled the British Empire’s decisive ‘swing to the east’ into the Indian and Pacific oceans. Historians of the eighteenth-century British Empire have protested against any easy separation between the ‘First’ and ‘Second’ British Empires on the grounds that the two overlapped in time, that they shared common purposes and personnel, and that the differences between the maritime, commercial colonies of settlement in North America and the military, territorial colonies of conquest in India have been crudely overdrawn. Nevertheless, among historians, and more generally in the popular imagination, the British Empire still denotes that ‘Second’ Empire, which was founded in the late eighteenth century and whose character distinguished it decisively from the ‘Old Colonial System’ of the British Atlantic world that had gone before it.\n\nAt its height, the British Empire encompassed close to a quarter of the world's surface and more than a fifth of its population. London—the 'very centre of the Empire on which the sun never sets' in Joseph Conrad's description—constituted a hub of diplomacy, trade, transport, finance, and culture, becoming quite literally, by the end of the 19 th century, the center from which global space and time were measured. This course on the British Empire analyzes the rise, dominance, and decline of this unprecedented global system of political rule, military activity, and economic and cultural interactions by employing a unique two-pronged approach: 1) using London as a lens through which to think about empire and 2) using the British Empire as a means to think about the city of London as an imperial capital. We start with Britain's expansion into the Atlantic World from the late 16C and conclude with decolonization in the mid-20C, considering the empire's legacies in contemporary British life. Spatially, the course alternates between Britain's overseas \" periphery \" and its metropolitan \" core. \" Taking advantage of the Paul Mellon Centre's (PMC) central location, the course involves weekly excursions discovering, exploring, and unpacking a wide range of (to turn Pierre Nora's phrase in this direction) imperial lieux de memoires, or \" sites \" where empire and its memory have been embedded into the fabric of London, from its built environment to monuments, archives, memorials, drink and foodways (i.e. from tea to tikka), and more."
