Using a unique array of cloaking watches, he can render himself invisible or even feign his own death, letting him infiltrate enemy lines with little chance of detection. His Disguise Kit lets him impersonate any class on either team. With enough skill in the art of deception, the Spy can momentarily fool enemies with his disguise, lulling them into a false sense of security. When the time is right, he can emerge from the woodwork to strike a killing blow, stabbing his unsuspecting \"teammate\" in the back. A backstab with any of the Spy's knives will kill most foes in a single hit — provided they are not under the effects of any type of invulnerability.\n\nIn addition to being able to swiftly assassinate key enemies, the Spy can disable and destroy Engineer-constructed buildings with his Sapper. Once attached, the Sapper disables and slowly drains health from the enemy building, eventually resulting in its destruction. However, a Sapper can be removed by an Engineer, or Pyro wielding the Homewrecker, Maul, or Neon Annihilator.\n\nThe Spy has the unique ability to use enemy Dispensers while disguised, and use enemy Teleporters at any time, enabling him to replenish his health and ammo behind enemy lines and enter Engineer nests undetected. Should any enemy be unfortunate enough to be standing on a Teleporter exit as the Spy teleports, they will be telefragged and die instantly. However, the Spy still collides with enemy buildings, even when disguised.\n\nMedics can both heal and apply ÜberCharge effects to disguised enemy Spies. Particularly adept Spies can use this to their advantage by coercing enemy Medics into healing them, allowing him to more easily pull off stabs amidst a group of enemies.\n\nWhereas most players can only see the names and health of their teammates, the Spy can observe the names and health of the enemy team as well (an ability unique to the Spy and a Medic carrying the Solemn Vow), allowing him to relay useful intelligence and coordinate team pushes. This synergizes well with his cloaking ability, which makes him ideal for identifying and calling out enemy positions and upcoming pushes. A skilled Spy can apply pressure from behind the enemy whilst the rest of his team pushes from the front, resulting in a pinch that any uncoordinated team will find difficult to escape from.\n\nThe Spy is voiced by Dennis Bateman.\n\nBio\n\nHealth\n\nMain articles: Health, Overheal\n\nClass Health Overheal Quick-Fix Overheal Spy 125 185 158 With the Big Earner equipped 100 150 126 With Conniver's Kunai equipped 70 105 89 Maximum overheal from Conniver's Kunai backstabs N/A 210 N/A\n\nSpeed\n\nMain article: Speed\n\nCondition Normal Backward Crouched Swimming Spy\n\n107 %\n\n96 %\n\n36 %\n\n85 %\n\nDisguised as a Scout\n\n107 %\n\n96 %\n\n36 %\n\n85 %\n\nDisguised as a Soldier\n\n80 %\n\n72 %\n\n27 %\n\n64 %\n\nDisguised as a Pyro\n\n100 %\n\n90 %\n\n33 %\n\n80 %\n\nDisguised as a Demoman\n\n93 %\n\n84 %\n\n31 %\n\n75 %\n\nDisguised as a Heavy\n\n77 %\n\n69 %\n\n26 %\n\n61 %\n\nDisguised as a Engineer\n\n100 %\n\n90 %\n\n33 %\n\n80 %\n\nDisguised as a Medic\n\n107 %\n\n96 %\n\n36 %\n\n85 %\n\nDisguised as a Sniper\n\n100 %\n\n90 %\n\n33 %\n\n80 %\n\nBasic strategy\n\nUse your knife to backstab enemies from behind, killing them instantly.\n\nDisguise yourself as an enemy with your Disguise Kit.

This also includes weapons worn on players, such as the Gunboats or Ali Baba's Wee Booties.\n\nWhen removing a disguise in third person, the cosmetic items of the player the Spy is disguised as appear on the Spy for a split second.\n\nRarely, disguised Spies can have missing bodygroups. This can cause situations such as a headless Pyro, or a hatless Scout.\n\nWhen a Spy is disguised as a Sniper with the Huntsman or Fortified Compound equipped, arrows do not appear in the Sniper's quiver.\n\nIf a disguised Spy dies, their player model goes into a reference pose when ragdolling.\n\nIf a Spy disguises and then removes their disguise while wearing any item that goes in the bip_head bone (i.e. most items with the Hat equip region), the Spy's equipped hat becomes slightly out of sync with their movement, occasionally clipping on the character's player model.\n\nSometimes, the Spy's left hand moving animation is faster than its default speed when the player is moving. This issue can be fixed by recording a demo (type \"record x\" in console, replacing x with the name of the demo) and quickly stopping it (typing \"stop\" in console).\n\nTrivia\n\nThe Spy's voice actor Dennis Bateman also voices the Pyro class.\n\nThe idea of Spy originally came from a Quake glitch, which caused players of the enemy team to appear as allies. [2]\n\nA common running joke and theory is that the Spy is the Scout's father.\n\nThis is inferred from official media such as the Meet the Spy short and in-game domination lines introducing Spy's liaisons with Scout's mother.\n\nOfficial comics further play into this speculation, with the Heavy giving a passing comment that the Scout's father \"disappears often\", and The Naked and the Dead comic showing the Spy giving comfort to a dying Scout, even calling him \"son\" while disguised as Tom Jones, and grieving when Scout dies.\n\nThe character has made some game crossovers:\n\nThe Spy makes an appearance in Worms: Reloaded as one of the forts; the rest of the fort is composed of Gravel Pit. In addition, the Spy's red balaclava is a selectable hat for the player's worms.\n\nJust like the rest of the classes, the Spy makes an appearance in the Saints Row: The Third in the form of a wearable head mask.\n\nThe Assassin class of Monday Night Combat has a promotional item with the Spy's disguise mask and the Scout's headset named \"Bonk! Slash!\".\n\nThe Spy, together with the Heavy and Pyro, feature as a single character named \"Team Fortress\" in the PC version of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed.
