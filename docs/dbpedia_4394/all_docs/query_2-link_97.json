        "text": "Finnish metal band SHADE EMPIRE have issued the following update:\n\n\"Some sad and good news.\n\nAs many of you may have noticed one is missing out. A few months after we'd record an Omega Arcane, Janne (Niiranen) announced that he has other things in his life where he wants to focus on instead of guitar wanking. We have grown up together and played together 14 years so the case was not easy to deal with and still isn't. We lost a member of the band, but we did not lose a friend. Friendship will remain forever! After four great albums, after many great gigs and paths we respect you, Janne Niiranen, and we wish you all the best for the future.\n\nOn the other hand we have also some good news to share with you. We have found a good person and great guitarist for the band. Aapeli Kivim√§ki from SOULFALLEN will join the SE roster. We are very excited of this and after first booze sessions Aapeli seems to be like one of us. So let's welcome him warmly on future gigs! Cheers!\"\n\nShade Empire will release their fourth album, Omega Arcane, on May 3rd in Finland and May 6th throughout Europe via Candlelight Records.\n\nThe new video for the album's lead-off track, 'Ruins', can be seen below:\n\nMore on Shade Empire at this location."
