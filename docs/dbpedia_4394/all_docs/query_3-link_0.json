        "text": "New album Sunholy will be released via Candlelight Records on 15th September\n\nFinnish symphonic extreme metallers Shade Empire have released their thought provoking third single, ‘Maroon‘. The track is taken from their sixth studio album, Sunholy,set for release on 15th September.\n\nPre-save Sunholy here: https://CandlelightRecords.lnk.to/ShadeEmpireSunholy\n\nThe band comments: “We think that ‘Maroon’ is one of the finest compositions of our career so far. This is not just a song but a journey that requires you to hopefully stop by and listen. ‘Maroon’ proves also that Henry is one of the most versatile vocalists in Finland as this track showcases his wide scale.”\n\nFormed in Kuopio, Finland in 1999, Shade Empire have developed their own genre, an unholy fusion of symphonic melody interwoven with black and death metal overtones, emotionally rich vocals and tight orchestral instrumentation. New album Sunholy features nine towering tracks of atmospheric beauty, barbed with unspeakably brutal guitar patterns, multi-layered beautiful synth walls, devastating drum parts, complex bass assaults and unique vocals that are delivered straight from the jaws of hell. Fans of Dimmu Borgir, Marduk, Septicflesh and Dark Tranquility will find something here.\n\nMixed by Chris Edrich (Devin Townsend, Leprous, Alcest) and mastered by Pierrick Noël (Klone), with Fleshgod Apocalypse‘s Francesco Ferrini responsible for the orchestrations and Andy Reich at Collapse Of Art completing the artwork, Sunholy is a long-aged piece of art and labour of love. Embodying the most comprehensive Shade Empire effort to date, the lyrics are thematically inspired by the Jonestown tragedy, a mass murder-suicide of the Peoples Temple cult, but there’s also a fuller contemplation and exploration of the current state of the world.\n\nAfter a long-endured absence, Shade Empire have returned as grandiose experts in their craft, with an astounding soundtrack to Hell’s gates opening and a band relishing being at the top of their game.\n\nShade Empire are:\n\nHenry Hämäläinen – vocals\n\nJuha Sirkkiä – guitars and keys\n\nEero Mantere – bass guitar\n\nErno Räsänen – drums\n\nAapeli Kivimäki – guitars\n\nShade Empire online:\n\nOfficial Website || Facebook || Instagram || Twitter || Candlelight"
