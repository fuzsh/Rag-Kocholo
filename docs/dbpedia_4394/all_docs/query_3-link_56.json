        "text": "As record-breaking temperatures sweep across New York, caregivers of Alzheimer's patients are implementing creative strategies to protect their loved ones from heat-related illnesses.\n\nDebbie Rosado, whose husband Gary was diagnosed with Alzheimer's five years ago, adapts their daily exercise routine based on weather conditions. On cooler days, they opt for scenic walks in shaded areas. When temperatures soar, Gary uses an indoor exercise bike in their air-conditioned basement.\n\n\"We're trying to find maybe some scenic areas that are more cool where there's trees and shade and bringing the water bottles,\" Rosado said.\n\nWith more than 400,000 New Yorkers living with Alzheimer's, the risks associated with extreme heat are significant. Elizabeth Smith-Boivin, executive director of the Alzheimer's Association's Northeastern New York chapter, emphasizes the importance of recognizing subtle signs of heat-related illness.\n\n\"If your loved one is suddenly or acutely ill, if they are not avoiding going to the restroom as often as they normally do, those are some immediate signs,\" Smith-Boivin said.\n\nExperts advise increased supervision during summer travel and vacations. Caregivers are encouraged to maintain consistent routines and prioritize heat safety measures to ensure the well-being of their loved ones with Alzheimer's."
