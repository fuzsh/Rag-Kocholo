        "text": "How has making 'Intoxicate O.S.' been a different experience from recording 'Sinthetic'?\n\nFirst of all we all are better musicians so I think the actual recordings went on easier than before. We also recorded the guitars and most of the keyboards by our selves so that varied also from Sinthetic recordings. The studio was the same in practise so it was easy to work there again with familiar producer. All in all I think that we have grown as musicians and our technical knowledge is better so the recordings went on more fluent.\n\nWhy should the people out there buy the album? What makes it special?\n\nI think that Intoxicate O.S. has something to offer for all metal fans. It's very aggressive but you can also find electronic and symphonic elements attached to blast beats and such. Some have even said that Shade Empire has quite unique sound. If you like METAL and you open minded go get I.O.S.!\n\nThe artwork on your albums and the single are very different from the average black metal artwork. Did you have any input on that?\n\nActually we gave free hands to Jarno Lahti and I think that we made excellent work. We checked some incomplete versions and gave him suggestions but mostly Lahti made the artwork so stunning. Besides I don't see our music as black metal even we have some elements that are often connected to that scene.\n\nThe new album has been out for a while now - are you working on anything new yet or are you busy with other projects?\n\nWe have started to make some new material little by little. We want to concentrate on new material carefully now and want to pre-produce new songs well. Maybe we'll be ready for recordings next year, hope so!\n\nWas it fun making the video for Chemical God?\n\nYes, it was fun but definitely not easy! Imagine yourself thrashing and head banging for eight hours straight like maniac. Yeah, our necks were aching 'a bit'! I must say that it all was worth it. The video looks stunning and we are more than satisfied with it! Big hails go to Ari Reinikainen who was behind the cameras and edit unit. He did superb work!\n\nWhat's next for Shade Empire?\n\nWe are doing some gigs and busy writing new material. Nothing too big coming up at the moment.\n\nAnything else you'd like to say to your fans?"
