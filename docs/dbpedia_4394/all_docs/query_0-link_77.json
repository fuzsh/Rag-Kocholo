        "text": "\"Ruins\", the new video from Finnish metallers SHADE EMPIRE, can be seen below. The song comes off the band's fourth album, \"Omega Arcane\", which will be released on May 3 via Candlelight Records. The CD consists of 11 songs and totals over 74 minutes in length. It is described in a press release as \"massive, a heavily orchestrated concept album [which] takes the band's sound to a whole new level.\"\n\n\"Omega Arcane\" track listing:\n\n01. Ruins\n\n02. Dawnless Days\n\n03. Until No Life Breeds\n\n04. Ash Statues\n\n05. Disembodiment\n\n06. Malicious Winds\n\n07. Traveler of Unlight\n\n08. Devolution\n\n09. Slumbering Giant\n\n10. Nomad\n\n11. Omega Arcane\n\nFormed in Kuopio in 1999, SHADE EMPIRE has developed its own genre. After three demos they inked deal with Italian label Avantgarde Records. Soon after that SHADE EMPIRE was ready to record the first full-length album, \"Sinthetic\" (2004). The CD received race reviews from all over the world and the band's fan base grew worldwide.\n\nIn January 2006, SHADE EMPIRE entered the Studio Perkele to record the follow-up to \"Sinthetic\". Released in May 2006, \"Intoxicate O.S.\" was a huge success, having debuted at position No. 25 on the Finnish chart. The single \"Slitwrist Ecstacy\" entered the chart at No. 3.\n\nSummer 2006 was quite a hectic time for the band as they played several gigs and festival shows in Finland and that continued until autumn due to fact that SHADE EMPIRE was chosen to headline Popkomm's Metal Evening, held in Berlin in October 2006. In spring 2007, SHADE EMPIRE started to write new material and did only a few, select shows during that time (i.e. Tuska). In October 2007, the band entered Studio 33 to record its third album, \"Zero Nexus\", a conceptual effort which took the band to new dimensions. Released in the spring of 2008, it opened at position No. 15 on the Finnish chart and was followed by a Finnish tour and successful shows at Tuska in 2008 and the main stage of Nummirock."
