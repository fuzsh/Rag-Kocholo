        "text": "DECEMBER, 24TH // 2019\n\nMerry Christmas and an awesome New Year to all you metalheads out there!\n\nAs a little christmas present we invite you to burn away your New Year's hangover with SOULFALLEN at a little place called Seinäjoki!\n\nPS: stay tuned for an update about the recording process of the new album in the coming weeks.\n\nJUNE, 13TH // 2019\n\nOur new We are the sand - 15 year anniversary t-shirts are now available at our webshop!\n\nGet yours now!\n\nMAY, 21TH // 2019\n\nThe Hatefeast draws near and we are proud to announce that we too have something special planned for these events!\n\nOn the feast we will launch the sale of our own 15-year anniversary t-shirts! The t-shirts are available in both black and white design.\n\nBe sure to come and grab your own!\n\nMARCH, 7TH // 2019\n\nBang! We are excited beyond words to share with you all some really great news: We will be playing three very special shows this May with our friends Shade Empire celebrating their 20th year anniversary! The shows will take place in Helsinki, Tampere and Kuopio and include some very special guests as well.\n\nAnd yes, we will be playing new material. So be sure to get your ticket today!\n\n22.5.2019 On the Rocks, Helsinki w/ Shade Empire, Ereb Altor\n\n23.5.2019 YO-talo, Tampere w/ Shade Empire, Ereb Altor\n\n25.5.2019 Ottopoika, Kuopio w/ Shade Empire, Demilich, Survivors Zero\n\nJANUARY, 16TH // 2019\n\nGreetings, friends! Just wanted to let you know that our third album ‘The Promise of Hell’ is now digitally available from all the major streaming services, including Spotify, iTunes, Amazon music, Google play, Deezer, Tidal, etc. Enjoy!\n\nJANUARY, 1ST // 2019\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nAs promised, it is time to shed more darkness on some of our most evil plans. During the preproduction of our fourth album it slowly became clear to us that we have been in fact writing material for not one but for two separate albums. Two different albums that will be recorded and released separately but once aligned they will form something greater than the sum of its parts. Remember when we said we can’t seem to do anything on a small scale!\n\nMusically the two albums will be different in character, mirror images of each other in a way, pushing the SOULFALLEN sound to new heights and extremes. Like two different branches of the same tree, the albums will still be woven together from their very core. Lyrically the two albums will form one coherent stand-alone story set in the same universe but aeons after the events of the World Expiration trilogy. The music will go hand in hand with two very different acts of the story creating thematically one hell of a ride through time and space, life and death, beauty and horror. Expect to be blown away!\n\nNeedless to say we are all more than excited about all of this! The recordings of the first of these albums will begin in the coming months and we will be keeping a studio diary of the process. Be sure to check it out for a taste of darkness to come!\n\nNOVEMBER, 21TH // 2018\n\nBig news! We are proud to announce that the preproduction for our fourth album is complete. We wish to thank all you for your patience. It took a while longer than expected as it seems we are unable to do anything on a small-scale. But before more news about the upcoming album, it is time to look back and wrap up the old ones.\n\nIn 2012 we decided not to release The Promise of Hell digitally due to poor artist royalties from digital sales and streaming services, and instead offer the album ourselves. Since then we have received countless requests from you, the fans, from all around the globe to make our music available in various digital formats. Because of these requests and the fact that it is a different world in 2018 we have decided to go ahead with the release. One can flog a dead horse for only so long and in the end music should be made accessible to the listener. We will be closing our campaign by the end of the year and wish to thank everyone who has participated in it. Your names will be remembered.\n\nWe have also had some lineup changes as Aki chose to step down from his guitarist duties. As our new 2nd guitarist we are extremely proud to welcome our long-time friend and brother-in-arms Jari Kinnunen from Lucidity (they have a new album coming out too, check them out!). Jari has already blended into the dark mold nicely and taken a role in the production process. We feel that again through change our strength has increased.\n\nA greater darkness lies on the horizon. Stay tuned for an update about the album recording process before the year is done.\n\nNOVEMBER, 8TH // 2014\n\nIt has been some time since our last update and it is time to let you know what we’ve been cooking and address some risen concerns. First things first, we are still very much alive!\n\nAs some of you may already know, our guitarist Aapeli has joined the Finnish symphonic death metal band Shade Empire (check them out, they’re awesome!) but rest assured: he is not going anywhere from Soulfallen. We have shared the stage with SE in the past and you can expect more collaboration with them in the future.\n\nThere have been some changes in the lineup though, as our long time bass player Jarno decided to step down from the band (and from Finland!) and we are extremely proud to announce the return of the multi-instrumentalist and former member Matti Auerkallio as our new bass player! Matti has already played with us on a couple of shows last year, filling in for Jarno, and things have fallen into place smoothly.\n\nWe are also pleased to say that the writing process for our fourth album is proceeding as planned! We took some time to finish off some off-band projects, refueling our black hearts with the plague, and now we are full and aflame with new musical aspiration. We also took a deliberate break from live shows, but 2015 will mark our return to stage with new killer material for your ears. Majestic melancholic madness will be unleashed!\n\nLast but not least, we wish to thank all of You for your patience and support during all this time! Darkness is on the horizon. Stay tuned for more.\n\nFEBRUARY, 23TH // 2013\n\nHere it is! We are proud to introduce the latest addition to our merchandise family: The Soulfallen Beanie! The beanies are Finnish high quality products - not your average run of the mill cheaply made ones. The first batch is only 50 items, so be sure to get yours before they run out!\n\nUnit price 20e.\n\nStay warm, stay cool!\n\nIn other news, our first show in 2013 will be in Freetime, Jyväskylä on March 8th! Be sure to be there!\n\nJANUARY, 27TH // 2013\n\nGreetings! Just wanted to wish you all a great New Year! Better late than never, right. You can check out our official New Year's greeting from HeavyMusic.ru.\n\nAnd it's not just any year, since 2013 marks the ten year anniversary of SOULFALLEN! Time does fly fast! We can tell you we have something special in mind for this special year, but details of that will reveal themselves later. All the same, be sure to stay tuned!\n\nLast but not least, we are proud to notice that our most popular song on YouTube, a fan video for the song We Are The Sand made by Nightfallrose, has reached 100,000 views!

Due to reasons stated in the following statement we decided to make the whole album available for downloading for free from our official site at www.soulfallen.com. We hope you will enjoy the new album and see you on the road!\n\n\"Playing in a band for many years and previously releasing two albums, we have discovered that due to the funding policies of various sites that sell music as downloads or provides streaming services, there is very little capital to be gained this way for the ones who have in fact created the music - the band. For this reason we have chosen to take measures into our own hands. From this day forth our third album 'The Promise of Hell' will be available for downloading for free from our official website at www.soulfallen.com. Yes, you heard right, it will be available FOR FREE.\n\nIn addition to making our new album available, we have posted a donate-button to our official website where anyone who downloads the new album can make A VOLUNTARY DONATION via PayPal that will go directly to the band. This way we hope to give direct means for anyone who has enjoyed and wishes to support the music of Soulfallen.\n\nAnd there is a catch. Anyone who donates 2 euros or more and leaves us with their name details, will get their name printed on the booklet of our fourth album once it comes out in the future as our gratitude for your personal support.\n\nWe hope you will enjoy our new album and support the bands you wish to continue making music also in the future.\"\n\nYours,\n\nSoulfallen\n\nDownload new album 'The Promise of Hell' from here.\n\nJANUARY, 15TH // 2012\n\nWe are extremely proud to present the official music video for the song 'Scars Aligned' from the upcoming new album 'The Promise of Hell'! The video was made by CoreCrew. Check it out!\n\nDECEMBER, 23TH // 2011\n\nSoulfallen would like to wish you all a hellish Christmas and an infernal New Year! It has been a good year for us despite its challenges. We've played some good shows with great bands, met some really cool people, but most of all we have recorded our third album! At this point we would like to take the time to thank you all for the support during the year(s). We are truly humbled by the feedback we have received from you all.\n\nAs our Christmas present we present you our first official single 'Dead and Dying' from our upcoming album 'The Promise of Hell'! Hopefully this will get you through the holidays and see you all on the road in 2012 - The year of Hell!\n\nYours, Soulfallen\n\nDECEMBER, 16th // 2011\n\nYou can now pre-order 'The Promise of Hell' from Record Shop X! They support credit card & Paypal payments and ship worldwide, so make sure to order your copy today!\n\nDECEMBER, 1st // 2011"
