The festival is held on 25-27 July 2024.\n\nGreen festival landscape of Park Väinölänniemi will be full of Finnish and international rock stars. The headliner of the festival will be British heavy machine music giant The Prodigy and KISS legend`s solo band Gene Simmons Band. The festival will feature nearly 40 artists on four different stages.\n\nOther artists to be seen at Kuopiorock include Viikate, known for Finnish metal, Maija Vilkkumaa, the sparkling queen of Suomi-rock, Popeda, who has signed the Kuopio-born Olli Herman as their soloist, and Happoradio, known for their songs Puhu äänellä jonka kuulen and Che Guevara. The festival will also feature the energetic metal band Lost Society, Stratovarius fronted by Timo Kotipello, and Dingo, one of the festival’s anniversary specials.\n\nKuopiorock’s programme will also be complemented by an unique band Krypta, FM2000 from Pieksämäki, Atomirotta, a band combining rap, funk and punk, Temple Balls, a hard rock band from Oulu, and Rock band from hell, which won the gig at the festival in the New Sounds competition organised by Teosto and Nelonen Media Live.\n\nLocal colour will be added by Shade Empire, who released their new Sunholy album last year, Linnanrauniot, Rosy Dream and Lohkare. Also, Väinö Stage will feature performances by Kuopio Rock Academy’s Anorexy, Jatkoroikka666, Self Enslaved, Licuation, Violet Garden, Haloshade and Woundstripe. In addition, on each festival night, SKYB – From the Nineties and Back – DJs will play for the festival crowd on the shores of the Kallavesi River.\n\nThe full daily line-up and program can be found on the festival website.\n\nPlease notice that the festival brings changes to the use of Väinölänniemi beaches. Keilinniemi and Peräniemi swimming areas will be closed from 22.7. to 28.7. during the construction of the festival and the festival itself. Väinölänniemi beach will be closed on Wed. 24.7. at 20:00, and will open on Sunday morning, after the area has been cleaned up."
