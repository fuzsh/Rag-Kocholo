        "text": "Introduction\n\nWarren Beatty has returned to Hollywood, playing eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes in “Rules Don’t Apply,” opening November 23, 2016.\n\nIt’s the actor-director’s first film in 15 years.\n\nThat length of time and his low profile surely explains why the poster for “Rules Don’t Apply” reads, “From the Academy Award winning filmmaker of ‘Reds,’ ‘Heaven Can Wait,’ ‘Shampoo,’ ‘Dick Tracy,’ ‘Bonnie and Clyde,’ ‘Bugsy’ and ‘Bulworth.'”\n\nThat’s one helluva track record — listing seven of Beatty’s proudest producing credits, four of which the star also directed himself. How many of them have you actually seen? What follows is a ranking of those seven Warren Beatty movies from Variety’s chief film critic, Peter Debruge.\n\n7. Heaven Can Wait\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the list of movies name-checked on the “Rules Don’t Apply” poster leaves out the most disposable credits of Warren Beatty’s career, so even the “worst” of the lot is a pretty good movie. (If you’re looking for a genuine stinker, check out the colossal flop that was “Ishtar,” which was also co-written by comedy legend Elaine May.) “Heaven Can Wait” was one of 1978’s most successful hits, racking up nine Academy Award nominations and making Beatty the first person since Orson Welles to be nominated as director, producer, writer, and star for the same film. But Beatty’s directorial debut is no “Citizen Kane.” In fact, it’s one of those movies that, if seen for the first time in 2016, looks clumsy and awkward. Beatty plays a white Los Angeles Rams quarterback who’s killed in a bicycling accident but, exploiting a loophole in the afterlife, gets a second chance, taking over the life of a rich old moneybags. What struck ’70s audiences as charming seems sexist and small-minded now, as we try to root for a character who can think only of trying to win the SuperBowl and seducing a woman (played by ex-flame Julie Christie) whose politics he doesn’t understand.\n\n6. Bulworth\n\nMore relevant in today’s election cycle than it was in 1998, “Bulworth” serves as an over-the-top satire of political campaigning, starring Beatty as a washed-up senator who orders his own assassination and uses his last hours on earth to drop the filter, finally saying what he really thinks (to a black congregation: “If you don’t put down that malt liquor and chicken wings, and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife, you’re never gonna get rid of somebody like me!”). But the script, which earned Beatty another Oscar nomination, was an oddity in its own time, simultaneously prescient and hopelessly outdated. It was always awkward trying to watch Beatty rap, and troubling how all the black characters were variations on a tired gangsta stereotype, including Beatty’s love interest (a much-younger Halle Berry). Less than a decade after “Jungle Fever,” that mixed-race coupling was supposed to push buttons, though it’s the age/power difference that feels so wrong today. Still, politics are even more of a media circus today, and there are some zingers here worth remembering.\n\n5. Dick Tracy\n\nImagine a world before the Marvel Cinematic Universe when no one seemed to know quite how to translate pulp comicbook heroes to the big screen. In 1990, Beatty helmed the most daring attempt to date, treating the bright colors and exaggerated design of Chester Gould’s classic detective strip as a direct template for a visually eye-popping live-action film. Everything from costumes to the elaborate hair and makeup prostheses created for characters like Flattop, Pruneface and The Brow was modeled after the comic — except for Beatty, who declined to disfigure his own leading-man looks with Tracy’s square jaw and trademark beak. Beatty plays a debonair Dick Tracy, torn between screen girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly) and slinky femme fatale Breathless Mahoney (off-screen girlfriend Madonna), though the other performances are all over the place, including wildly miscalibrated turns from serious-actor peers Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino (practically foaming at the mouth). The result is not a good movie by any measure, but the choices are bold, and it stands as a piece of kitschy pop art.\n\n4. Shampoo\n\nBeatty began his career with one of the all-time great acting debuts, starring as a hunky small-town mouth-breather who “ruins” a prim young woman in “Splendor in the Grass” (1961), but it was his role as a Hollywood hairdresser who seduces most of his female clients (plus one of their daughters, played by an underage Carrie Fisher) that cemented his image as Tinseltown’s No. 1 rake. Toying with Beatty’s bad-boy image while featuring now-dated scenes in which his character pretends to be gay — all the better to fool the men he’s cuckolding — “Shampoo” (1975) was actually a period piece, set on election night 1968. With its tight pants and shaggy plot, “Shampoo” captures the end of a swingin’ era when a guy like George Roundy might shack up with one woman (Goldie Hawn), seduce his would-be patron’s wife (Lee Grant), and propose to a third (Julie Christie), all in the span of a single day. While “Harold and Maude” director Hal Ashby called the shots, the chemistry between Beatty and Christie was real enough — though the dynamic here isn’t nearly as interesting as it is in Robert Altman’s “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” where the couple played evenly matched frontier opportunists.\n\n3. Reds\n\nA sprawling three-hour homage to the unsung American heroes of the Russian Revolution, “Reds” is about as unlikely a success as Hollywood has seen during Beatty’s lifetime (it was nominated for 12 Oscars, but lost the big one to “Chariots of Fire”). Like “Dick Tracy” and Beatty’s upcoming Howard Hughes project, the epic film was hatched by Beatty at least 15 years before it actually came to pass, and it’s a testament to the quadruple-threat filmmaker’s strength of will (once again, he wrote, directed, produced, and starred) that it exists at all. Even so, what makes the film so powerful isn’t Beatty’s charismatic performance, as Communist journo John Reed, author of “Ten Days That Shook the World,” but the testimony of the “witnesses” — comrades of Reed’s whose documentary testimony grounds what might have otherwise felt like a talky, melodramatic attempt to one-up “Doctor Zhivago,” complete with sweeping Stephen Sondheim score. Once again, the real-life relationship between Beatty and his co-star (in this case, Diane Keaton, assertive enough to hold her own as fellow reporter Louise Bryant) fueled the spark they show on-screen, revealing the intellectual and political dimensions of Beatty that many audiences had never seen before.\n\n2. Bonnie and Clyde\n\nOne of the all-time most influential and revolutionary movies of the American cinema, “Bonnie and Clyde” has lost much of its edge with time, mostly as other filmmakers — from Terrence Malick’s “Badlands” to the Lonely Island’s “Shy Ronnie” sketch — have taken its innovations and polished them through re-use. Beatty’s role extended far beyond merely starring as self-conscious bandit Clyde Darrow; the actor also produced, earning his first best picture nomination in the process. It was Beatty who, turned down by François Truffaut, recruited Arthur Penn (who had directed him in the over-styled dud “Mickey One” two years earlier) to bring a jagged, French New Wave-esque look to the film. In 1967, the handheld camerawork, frisky jump-cut editing, and ultra-violent ending read as “realistic,” making the film seem infinitely more hip than the vast majority of studio-made product. An original touch, Clyde’s impotence was almost a joke coming from Beatty, who gave Method acting a postmodern wink, while starring opposite a talented fresh face (Faye Dunaway). In open defiance of the Production Code-dictated mores of earlier gangster films, Beatty’s crime caper overturned all the rules, making criminals not just sympathetic (they famously die in a bullet-riddled police ambush), but charming to boot.\n\n1. Bugsy\n\nReleased a year after Martin Scorsese’s “Goodfellas,” this meaty portrait of Jewish American mobster Benjamin Siegel (as the film memorably reminds us, nobody calls him “Bugsy” to his face) is as juicy and satisfying as a good steak — and arguably the greatest role of Beatty’s career. With only limited concern for trying to capture the real Siegel, Beatty brings his full star persona to bear, playfully acknowledging the “you’re so vain” side Carly Simon famously criticized (as when Siegel squeezes tanning sessions between hits) while revealing his true romantic potential. Knowing that co-star Annette Bening (who plays Hollywood starlet Virginia Hill) would go on to become his wife merely adds to their already sexy on-screen courtship, which proves even more exciting than all the gangster behavior. When Siegel mistakes Hill’s brother for a rival suitor, he throws the poor guy through a window, and later, she talks him out of suicide by nearly murdering him with his own gun. Before this film, Beatty’s most passionate scene Beatty occured in “Shampoo,” when Goldie Hawn flips out after discovering him in flagrante delicto with Julie Christie, but “Bugsy” reveals the true depth of what Beatty was capable, as an actor and, possibly, as a husband."
