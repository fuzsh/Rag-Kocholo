        "text": "\"Reds\" (1981) is a historical epic film directed by and starring Warren Beatty. The movie tells the story of John Reed, an American journalist and communist activist, who chronicled the Russian Revolution in his book \"Ten Days That Shook the World.\" Set during the early 20th century, the film follows Reed's passionate involvement in socialist and communist movements, his relationship with writer and feminist Louise Bryant (played by Diane Keaton), and his experiences during the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The film explores themes of political idealism, love, and the personal sacrifices made by individuals for their beliefs. It combines romance, drama, and historical events to provide a sweeping portrayal of the tumultuous period of the Russian Revolution and its impact on the lives of those involved.\n\nReds (1981)\n\nMovie Viewing Guide: Summary/Vocabulary/Questions/KEY"
