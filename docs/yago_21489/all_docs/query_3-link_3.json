Warren Beatty interviewed people who knew John Reed and Louise Bryant personally, and they appear in REDS as “witnesses.”\n\n-DID YOU KNOW that Warren Beatty developed REDS for nearly 20 years? After reading John Reed’s autobiographical accounts of the Russian Revolution, Beatty traveled to the Soviet Union in the late 1960s to begin his research.\n\n-DID YOU KNOW that Warren Beatty was asked to star in a Russian co-production about John Reed while he was developing REDS? He turned down the offer because he did not want political interference with the story.\n\n-DID YOU KNOW that Elaine May worked on the screenplay? Although she is not credited onscreen, she revised the script to have a greater emphasis on the love relationship.\n\n-DID YOU KNOW that REDS was Warren Beatty’s debut as a solo director? His success with HEAVEN CAN WAIT (1978) – which he co-directed with Buck Henry – encouraged Paramount to finance REDS.\n\n-DID YOU KNOW that Warren Beatty initially considered casting John Lithgow in the lead role? Sam Shepard and musician James Taylor were among prospects for the part of “Eugene O’Neill” before Jack Nicholson was cast in the role.\n\n-DID YOU KNOW that Polish author Jerzy Kosiński appeared in REDS? It was his first of only three screen roles. He famously stated that he learned to speak English by watching movies.\n\n-DID YOU KNOW that editor Dede Allen also received onscreen credit as an executive producer? She and Craig McKay reportedly cut a record-breaking 2.5 million feet of footage.\n\n-DID YOU KNOW that the Soviet Union denied requests for location shooting in Moscow? Exteriors were instead filmed in Finland and Spain, while Kremlin interiors were constructed on London soundstages.\n\n-DID YOU KNOW that despite its controversial subject matter, one of the first screenings of REDS was in the White House for President Ronald Reagan?

Do you see any parallels to today’s world?\n\n-Hailed by critics, REDS was compared to CITIZEN KANE as a masterpiece of storytelling. What comparisons do you see between the two films? How do they use journalism as a narrative device?\n\n-REDS was released during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, in which Communism was widely feared by Americans. Why do you think REDS was so warmly received by audiences at this time?\n\n-REDS depicts revolution as a vehicle of change in the world. Do the political sentiments of REDS seem dated to you? What does revolution look like in our world today?\n\n-Louise Bryant struggled for equality before women had won the right to vote in America. How does this impact her character in the film?\n\n-Do you believe this is the future the characters in REDS predicted?\n\n-Interviews with “witnesses” adds an element of authenticity to the story.
