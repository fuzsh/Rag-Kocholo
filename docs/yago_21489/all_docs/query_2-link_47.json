        "text": "THE Scott Joplin ragtime tune behind the opening credits of Warren Beatty's ''Reds'' recalls the sounds of pre-World War I America as they were heard then, when Greenwich Village was still a new Bohemia, free love was a way of life for the adventurous, new ideas were shaping the arts, and radical politics were more a matter of theory than practice. As the ragtime music fades out, voices fade in, contemporary voices that form a bridge to the past. ''Was that in 1917 or 1913?'' asks one. ''I'm beginning to forget.'' ''You know,'' another voice acknowledges, ''things go and come back.'' ''Were they Socialists?''\n\nOne by one the faces that belong to these voices appear on the screen, seen in close-up against a luminously black void. Some are familiar - Rebecca West's, Henry Miller's, Adela Rogers St. Johns's - and all are very old (some have died since the interviews were filmed). Some are lined with the cobwebs of long life. Other faces, like Miller's, are as wrinkle-free as stretched parchment. Each in some way remembers that earlier time, if only, like George Jessel, who wears his U.S.O. uniform, to become confused. Jessel cannot remember whether the great anarchist and anti-World War I activist was named Emma Goldberg or Emma Goldman.\n\nThese are the Witnesses - there are more than two dozen of them - who make up a kind of Greek chorus, the members of which appear from time to time throughout ''Reds'' to set the film in historical perspective, as much by what they remember accurately as by their gossip and by what they no longer recall. It's an extraordinary device, but ''Reds'' is an extraordinary film, a big romantic adventure movie, the best since David Lean's ''Lawrence of Arabia,'' as well as a commercial movie with a rare sense of history.\n\nThe focal point of ''Reds,'' which Mr. Beatty produced, wrote (with Trevor Griffths), directed and acts in, is the love affair and marriage of John Reed, the flamboyant American journalist and radical sympathizer, and Louise Bryant, the Portland, Ore., dentist's wife who, in 1915, fled from her husband and middle-class conventions to follow Reed to Greenwich Village and her own desperately longed-for emancipation.\n\nThe film, which begins with a montage of Reed's exploits while covering Pancho Villa in Mexico in 1913, moves from Portland to Greenwich Village; to Provincetown, Mass., where Reed and Louise helped form the famous Provincetown Players with Eugene O'Neill and others; to France, before United States entry into the war, and finally to Russia, where Reed and Louise were covering the successful Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Theirs is the kind of story that only a third-rate novelist would dare make up.\n\nThough very long - more than three hours plus intermission - and broad in physical scale, ''Reds'' has at its center two remarkable characters -Reed, the perennial undergraduate who used wars and revolutions as his personal raw material, but whose commitment to social and political change led him to risk everything on behalf of the world Communist movement, and Louise Bryant, an incurable romantic who, in the course of her association with Reed, became her own tragic heroine.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
