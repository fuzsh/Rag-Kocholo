        "text": "It's way over budget. It won't be screened until the very last minute. There are more editors splicing it together than there are elves in Santa's workshop. Yet it has already been previewed, and audiences have booed.\n\nThe only things all these rumors have in common is that they surround ''Reds,'' Paramount's forthcoming 3 1/2-hour, multimilliondollar epic about the writer-turned-revolutionary John Reed - and that Paramount says they are simply not true.\n\nA month before its Dec. 4 release date, ''Reds,'' which stars Warren Beatty as John Reed, Diane Keaton as Louise Bryant and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill, is already controversial. The combined effects of a story focusing on American Communists active in the Russian Revolution, a very long shooting schedule, a production cost of $33.5 million, and the mystique of Mr. Beatty, the film's producer, director and star, have generated a remarkable flurry of gossip.\n\nSome of the items - like one entitled ''Chubbed Up,'' about the purported weight gain of Mr. Beatty, though he likes to eat sunflower seeds and drink Perrier - are harmless enough. Others can't help but make a few waves at Paramount, where the mood remains calm despite the strained circumstances. ''We're just going about our business,'' said Gordon Weaver, Paramount's senior vice president in charge of worldwide marketing. ''I guarantee you, there's nobody in Biloxi, Mississippi, who's saying 'Oh my God, ''Reds'' is going over budget again.' '' Awful-Preview Story\n\nBut there may be those who think ''Reds'' is headed for trouble, thanks especially to the awful-preview story. This one, which exemplifies the accuracy of the ''Reds'' rumors, originated in Los Angeles, under the headline ''RED HERRING?'' The item reported that 4 1/2-minute-long trailers for the film had been ''roundly booed'' in one Westwood theater. Soon the story had been picked up elsewhere, only now it said that ''in previews at a handful of theaters, 'Reds' drew a mixed response and was even roundly booed at one Los Angeles theater.''\n\nSince the finished - and it is finished, according to Mr. Weaver - movie has yet to be shown to audiences, Mr. Weaver says that the item is misleading. He also points out that the trailers have been playing in 5,000 theaters since September and that Paramount representatives periodically check up on how the 4 1/2-minute film is being received. ''Our experience is that it has been playing sensationally well,'' he said. ''If it were not playing well, we would have heard long ago.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
