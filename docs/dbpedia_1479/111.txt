What’s the Difference Between Irish Stew and Mulligan Stew?

Irish stew and Mulligan stew are both hearty, traditional recipes, but they are a little bit different. Irish stew is typically a simple dish made of lamb or beef, potatoes, onions, and carrots. Mulligan stew is a little more eclectic, usually a colorful combo of various leftovers, which means you might find all kinds of summer or winter veggies, meats, and seasonings. This recipe is a great basic version that you can whip up easily (even if you’re short on leftovers at the moment).

Ingredients for Mulligan Stew

Curious about what goes into this version of classic Mulligan stew? It’s full of tender chunks of beef, a colorful array of vegetables, and plenty of savory seasonings. Here’s the list of ingredients:

Olive Oil: For sauteing. You can use any neutral cooking oil that you like.

Beef: Stew beef or chuck roast, cut into cubes.

Salt and Pepper

Onion and Garlic: Dice the onion, and mince or press the garlic.

Paprika: I like to use smoked paprika to give it that rustic, campfire vibe. Sweet paprika would also be acceptable.

Beef Broth: You could substitute vegetable or chicken broth, but those will not produce that deeper color and flavor.

Carrots: Cut into one-inch chunks.

Potatoes: Cubed.

Tomatoes: Fresh tomatoes are fine if you have them, but I usually go with canned, crushed tomatoes.

Green Beans: I used fresh, but frozen are also okay to use.

Peas: Use frozen peas.

Herbs: Dried oregano and rosemary, and some freshly chopped parsley.

How to Make Mulligan Stew

Making Mulligan Stew is so easy – just brown the beef to build those deep, savory notes, then toss in your vegetables and let them mingle with the meaty goodness.

Brown the Beef. Heat the oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven, and sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper. Brown the beef on all sides, then set it on a clean plate.

Cook the Onion, Garlic, and Paprika. Toss the onion and garlic in the same pot, and cook down until the onions are translucent. Then add the paprika and cook it for just a minute to release the flavor.

Add the Broth and Simmer the Beef. Add the beef back to the pot, and pour in the beef broth, making sure to cover the beef fully. Simmer for about one hour or until the beef is nice and tender.

Add the Veggies. Add your potatoes, carrots, and green beans to the stew, and cook for 30 minutes longer. Follow that with the tomatoes, and last, the peas and dried herbs.

Enjoy! Once everything is tender, taste for seasonings, and then stir in the parsley. Serve hot, with whatever sides you love.

Tips for Successful Mulligan Stew

Layer Those Flavors: Start by browning your meat (beef, lamb, or poultry) in batches to develop rich flavors. Searing the meat creates a savory base for the stew.

Deglaze the Pot: After sautéing the aromatics, deglaze the pot with broth, wine, or beer. Scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot for added depth.

Use a Variety of Veggies: Select a variety of vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, peas, corn, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Consider what’s in season or what you have on hand.

Serving Suggestions

You can serve any side dishes you like with this beef stew. I recommend something that will soak up the rich, flavorful broth. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

Cornbread: Dunk it or crumble it right into your bowl. Either way, you’ll love this sweet, honey-topped Homemade Cornbread Recipe, served with hot Mulligan stew.

Crescent Rolls: Make a double-batch of these, and freeze some for later – trust me, they’re worth it. Flaky Homemade Crescent Rolls (aka butterhorn rolls) are totally irresistible.

Salad: If you’d like something a little less carb-laden, try serving a side salad with your stew. A colorful garden salad would be great, or you could make this Cucumber Salad with Sour Cream Dressing for a creamy, zesty, simple dish.

How to Store and Reheat Leftovers

Like many soups and stews, this one is even better when you reheat it the next day. To store, transfer the stew to an airtight container and keep it in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. When you’re ready to serve the stew again, simply reheat it on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of broth if the stew is too thick.

To freeze Mulligan stew, you can portion it out into freezer-safe containers (leaving a little space for expansion) and keep it in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge before reheating on the stove.

Ingredients

▢ 3 tablespoons olive oil

▢ 1 pound beef stew meat,, or use chuck roast cut into cubes

▢ 2 teaspoons kosher salt

▢ ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

▢ 1 large onion,, diced

▢ 3 cloves garlic,, minced

▢ 1 teaspoon smoked paprika

▢ 6 cups beef broth

▢ 28 ounce can crushed tomatoes

▢ 2 cups fresh green beans

▢ 1 cup frozen peas

▢ 1 teaspoon dried oregano

▢ ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Instructions

In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.

Season the cubed beef with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.

Add the seasoned beef to the pot and brown it on all sides, stirring occasionally. This will take about 5 to 7 minutes. Once browned, remove the beef from the pot and set aside.

In the same pot, add the diced onion and minced garlic. Cook until the onions are translucent and fragrant, about 2 minutes.

Stir in the smoked paprika and cook for another minute to release its flavor.

Pour in the beef broth while stirring all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan and ensuring that the beef is fully covered with the liquid. Bring the mixture to a boil.

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the stew simmer for 1 hour.

After an hour, add the cubed potatoes, carrot pieces, and green beans to the pot. Stir everything together and continue to simmer for 30 minutes or until the vegetables are softened.

Next, add the crushed tomatoes to the stew and mix well. Allow the stew to simmer for 15 minutes to incorporate the flavors.

Add the peas, dried oregano, and dried rosemary to the pot. Stir everything together and let the stew simmer for another 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.

Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning with the remaining 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper, or to taste.

Finally, stir in the chopped parsley.

Remove the pot from the heat and serve.

Notes

Flavor Building: Sear the meat (beef, lamb, or poultry) in stages to enrich the stew’s flavor.

Pot Deglazing: After sautéing, use broth, wine, or beer to deglaze the bottom of the pot.

Veggie Selection: Use root vegetables and mushrooms, too, keeping in mind seasonal availability or whatever you have on hand.

Store: To store, transfer the stew to an airtight container and keep it in the fridge for three to four days. To serve it again, simply reheat it on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of broth if the stew seems too thick.

Freeze: Mulligan stew freezes wonderfully, so if you want to save it for a longer period of time, you can portion it out into freezer-safe containers (leaving a little space for expansion) and keep it in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge before reheating on the stove.
