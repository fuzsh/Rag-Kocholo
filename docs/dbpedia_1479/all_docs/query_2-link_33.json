        "text": "Greetings fellow food lovers,\n\nIt has been awfully chilly the last few weeks around the farm. Normally, we run around in circles and light veggie scraps on fire to stay warm every morning. We’ve also been curating a new dance routine to really turn up the heat in the packing shed. This helps us pack your veggies faster and also keeps our toes from freezing. Although I am just kidding, I often wonder during these cold midwinter stretches, “Why do I live somewhere that if I stayed outside too long, I would die?” On the other hand, the long winter can be a nice break from all of the summer work we do at the farm, and I love that we have real seasons in the Northland.\n\nSpeaking of the Northland, we had a great time seeing our community at Wild State Cider last week for our annual rutabaga giveaway. In case you missed it, this event had a unique twist this year: rutabaga curling! I can’t think of a better way to take advantage of this unique vegetable (aside from, you know, eating it). Plus, curlers can really sweep you off your feet. Our friends helped make a wonderful video with some highlights from the event which you can find on our Facebook page or by clicking this link: https://fb.watch/b8eTjlvrps/.\n\nMake sure you sign up for your summer shares if you haven’t already! These spots tend to fill quickly. More of this information can be found right on our website. Let us know if you have any questions. Throughout these recent times of uncertainty in our food systems, the importance of local farms has really been brought to light. Community Supported Agriculture has given all of us stability and the ability to contribute to something bigger than ourselves. Our crew at the Food Farm continues to take this responsibility seriously and we appreciate our members and your support!\n\nBy the time I write the next newsletter, I expect we will have seen warmer days (by warmer days I mean anything above 20 degrees), and we’ll be starting up greenhouse work and seeding onions! Oh, and remember: organic vegetables make the perfect Valentine’s Day gifts.\n\nStay warm,\n\nEmily\n\nIn your shares this month:\n\nBeets – Carrots – Green Cabbage – Parsnips – Baby Red and Russett Potatoes – Onions – Garlic – Delicata Squash\n\nMulligan Stew (The Soup and Bread Cookbook, B. Ojakangas)\n\n2 lbs beef stew meat cut into 1″ cubes (or substitute beans for a vegetarian version)\n\n4 medium thin skinned potatoes, yellow or red, washed, unpeeled and quartered\n\n4 medium carrots, cut into 2″ pieces\n\n4 small onions, quartered\n\n1 (1/2 lb) rutabaga, peeled and cut into 1″ cubes\n\n3 sprigs parsley\n\n1 tbsp sugar\n\n2 tsp salt\n\n1/4 tsp black pepper\n\n2 tbsp flour\n\n1/2 cup red wine or water\n\nIn a 4-qt soup pot, combine the meat and cold water to cover and bring to a boil. Add the potatoes, carrots, onions, rutabaga, parsley, sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer, tightly covered, over low heat until the meat is tender, about 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nIn a cup, mix the flour and wine/water until smooth. Stir into the stew and cook for 15 minutes, stirring frequently to thicken the stew.\n\nKalldolmer (Danish cabbage rolls)(Danish Food Cookbook)\n\n3/4 lb ground beef\n\n1/4 lb ground pork\n\n1 egg\n\n1/2 cup cooked rice or 1/4 cup breadcrumbs\n\n1/2 cup milk\n\n1 small onion, grated\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n1/2 tsp pepper\n\n2 cans stewed tomatoes\n\n12 cabbage leaves (large)\n\nMix meats, rice/bread crumbs, onion, milk, egg, salt and pepper in a bowl. Rinse a large cabbage head and remove about 12 large leaves. Drop the leaves into boiling water for a few minutes to soften them. Drain the leaves. Place about 1/4 cup of meatball mix into the center of the leaf and wrap it like a package. Brown in a frying pan and then place seam side down in a 9″x13″ baking pan. Pour the tomatoes over them. Bake 350F for about an hour."
