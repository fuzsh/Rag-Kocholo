        "text": "How to Cook Mulligan Stew\n\nWhen I learned how to cook Mulligan stew, I alot about its history. It is made from whatever ingredients are available. “What you can beg, borrow or steal!” It could be leftover Irish appetizers, lamb stew or even Irish cookies! It is really a way to use up all your leftovers in your refrigerator or freezer. For this reason, there is no set recipe for it and every time it is prepared it should be different.\n\nWhen I learned how to make Mulligan stew, I could trace it back to the Irishmen. This term is also used to describe many different things in other parts of the world. I have heard that our hobos along the railroads use to make this stew by stealing from the houses along the tracks.\n\nMy dad use to tell me if he didn’t feed the hobos they would steal what they wanted. He would sit them down at the picnic table and feed them each time they came around.\n\nWhen I learned how to make Mulligan stew, I also learned stories which go along with it. Women would gather together available foods in the kitchen early on wash day. After throwing everything in a large pot, they would begin their wash. Because of the cold damp weather and the fact that they spent much of their washday outside in the cold, this pot of hot hearty stew was a welcome break to warm up.\n\nHere are some stew ingredients you might find leftover in your refrigerator to throw into a large pot to make the stew.\n\nHOW TO COOK MULLIGAN STEW INGREDIENTS\n\nHamburger\n\nRoast beef\n\nSteak\n\nPork chops\n\nSausage\n\nRoast pork\n\nHam pieces\n\nAny fats or bones\n\nLeftover gravies/ meat stock\n\nVegetables: Corn, peas, green beans, carrots, all beans, tomatoes\n\nEven if you don’t have leftover garlic, onions or celery, I would always add them also for flavor. You could also add any leftover rice or macaroni.\n\nStart the stew by adding the meat into a big heavy pot and cover with water. Start throwing in all the vegetables that you have available. Then add the rice or pasta. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer. After a few minutes, taste the mixture for flavor. Season with salt and pepper. Then add the herbs and spices that you like. Remember no set rules! Just go for your favorite flavor. Everyone is different!\n\nIRISH STEW RECIPE\n\nThis Irish stew recipe made by one family might also be called a mulligan recipe.\n\n2 ½ Pounds chunks lamb\n\n8 Potatoes\n\n4 Turnips\n\n4 Small onions\n\n1 Pint green peas\n\n1 Pint lima beans\n\n4 Carrots\n\n1 Quart cold water\n\nSalt/ pepper\n\nChop vegetables and lamb; layer in pot alternately with meat and vegetables.\n\nAdd quart of cold water; cover stew pot and stew slowly until most of liquid is absorbed about 2 to 2 1/2 hours.\n\nStir and Serve.\n\nPRESSURE COOKER BEEF STEW\n\nEven though this beef stew recipe is not slow cooked but is a presser cooker beef stew recipe, it can also be a Mulligan recipe.\n\n2 Tablespoon fat\n\n2 Pounds chunked beef\n\n¼ Pound lean salt pork in ½ inch cubes\n\n1 Can (16 ounces) tomatoes\n\n1 Large chopped onion\n\n1 Large chopped carrot\n\n1 Celery stalk\n\n1 Clove minced garlic\n\n1 Bay leaf\n\n1 Teaspoon salt\n\n1 Teaspoon thyme\n\n3 Parsley sprigs\n\n12 Stuffed olives in halves\n\n1 Cup sliced mushrooms\n\nBrown meat and salt pork in hot fat; add remaining ingredients.\n\nCover and bring cooker to 15 pounds of pressure as manufacturer directs; cook 20 minutes.\n\nRemove cooker from heat and reduce pressure quickly as manufacturer directs before removing cover.\n\nDiscard parsley and bay leaves; serve over hot cooked noodles.\n\nLAMB AND FENNEL STEW\n\nThis Italian version of Mulligan stew is deliciously flavored with fennel and garlic.\n\n¼ Cup olive oil (Divided)\n\n2 ½ Pound lamb shoulder (Cut in 2 inch cubes)\n\n1 Cup thinly sliced red onion\n\n1 Tablespoon coarse salt\n\n2 Teaspoons freshly ground black pepper\n\n¾ Cup white wine\n\n6 Small fennel bulbs (OR cut large ones)\n\n5 Cloves minced garlic\n\n2 Tablespoons balsamic vinegar"
