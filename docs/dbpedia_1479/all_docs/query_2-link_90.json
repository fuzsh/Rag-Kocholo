And since I was level 13, not 15, it couldn't and that caused it to fail out.\n\nI put that item in vcon and excluded it, so I could continue, but is there something that automatically detects that I am not high enough level to take the consumable requested? If that's already coded, did we break it?\n\nExcluding it in vcon works - but vcon itself should exclude items with level requirements you don't meet.\n\nThat should be easy enough. I'll look into it.\n\nHad an odd thing happen today with this script but unfortunately the session log didn't capture the relevant information. I happened to be watching the gCLI when the issue occurred so here's a reconstruction:\n\nAdventuring as normal in Barf Mountain, when the available adventures hit zero\n\nParanormal activity reported at The Haunted Wine Cellar.\n\nOne fullness was left but the script consumed no food\n\nErrors endlessly repeating in the gCLI stating that there were no adventures left\n\nHit the escape key\n\nAte something\n\nI then restarted the script and it ran to completion. At a guess the logic for handling paranormal activity superseded the logic that would have normally taken over and consumed a one fullness food.\n\nAt a guess the logic for handling paranormal activity superseded the logic that would have normally taken over and consumed a one fullness food.\n\nI think the \"recognize when it's time to eat more\" functionality is a little ad hoc. I'll take a look at it by and by, now that I am (slightly) coming out of KoLmafia retirement.\n\nHow is it you had unused fullness? Pantsgiving? (I was going to say fortune cookies, but we only support those via Lucky Lindy, not cookies.)"
