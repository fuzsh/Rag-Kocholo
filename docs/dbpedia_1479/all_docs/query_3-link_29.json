This post may contain affiliate links, which means we may receive a commission if you click a link and purchase something we have recommended. Please see our disclosure policy for details. Thank you for being so supportive!\n\nThis hearty mulligan stew recipe is loaded with tender beef chunks and a rainbow of veggies and makes a deliciously satisfying dinner. It’s an ideal way to use up those odds and ends in the crisper drawer too.\n\nI usually make this on the stovetop in a few hours, but you can make it in a slow cooker as well.\n\nWhy is it called mulligan stew?\n\nThe name suggests an Irish origin, and a mulligan stew is typically made of an assortment of whatever ingredients are on hand, including meat, potatoes, and vegetables.\n\nIt’s sometimes called “hobo stew,” a term derived from the railroad hobo camp meals of the early 1900s.\n\nWhat is mulligan stew made of?\n\nTraditionally, it’s made from whatever you have available, so if there’s a veggie on this list you don’t have, toss in what you do have!\n\nI kinda like the idea it may taste a wee bit different every time you make it.\n\n2 tablespoons oil\n\n2 pounds beef stew meat (more or less, to preference)\n\n1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n\n1 yellow onion, chopped\n\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n\n1/2 teaspoon dried oregano\n\n1/2 teaspoon dried basil\n\n1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary\n\n1/2 teaspoon dried thyme\n\n1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (more or less, to taste)\n\n32 ounces beef broth\n\n15 oz can diced tomatoes\n\n1 lb yellow potatoes, scrubbed and cut into equal bite-sized pieces\n\n3 carrots, peeled and sliced\n\n3 celery stalks, sliced\n\n1 cup of frozen green beans\n\n1 cup frozen lima beans\n\n1 cup frozen peas\n\n1 cup of frozen corn\n\n1 cup fresh parsley\n\nAdditions and substitutions\n\nAdd some Worcestershire sauce for a splash of umami.\n\nIf you don’t have beef stock on hand, use chicken stock or vegetable stock.\n\nHow to make this recipe for mulligan stew\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together flour, oregano, basil, rosemary, thyme, marjoram, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Toss stew meat in the flour until thoroughly coated.\n\nHeat oil in a large stockpot and brown the stew beef in batches so there’s plenty of room for each piece. Brown meat well on all sides, then remove and set aside.\n\nAdd the onions and balsamic vinegar to the pot and cook for several minutes until the onions are tender. Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen all those yummy beef bits. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.\n\nAdd the beef broth and tomatoes to the pot. Then add the stew beef back to the pot along with the vegetables.\n\nBring to a boil, reduce heat to low; cover and cook for about 2 1/2 hours or until beef is fork-tender.\n\nAdd peas and let simmer, covered for another 30-45 minutes.\n\nLadle big scoops of stew into serving bowls.\n\nSprinkle each serving with fresh chopped parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nIs it necessary to brown the meat before stewing?\n\nBrowning the meat gives the beef a nice sear and adds depth to the stew’s flavor.\n\nIs it necessary to flour the meat before browning?\n\nDredging the stew beef with flour before cooking adds body and thickness to the stew.\n\nWhat’s a good cut of meat for beef stew?\n\nThe best cut is probably a nicely marbled beef chuck which you can cut into chunks yourself. I usually go the timesaving method of buying pre-cut beef stew meat. The key to tender beef is low and slow.\n\nHow to make slow cooker mulligan stew\n\nFlour and brown beef in a skillet as directed in the mulligan stew stovetop recipe. Place beef in the slow cooker. Cook the onions and garlic in the skillet, then add to the slow cooker.\n\nAdd remaining ingredients, stir together and cook on low heat for 7-8 hours. I don’t recommend cooking it on high because you really need the time to tenderize the beef properly. Low and slow is the key.\n\nLove stew?
