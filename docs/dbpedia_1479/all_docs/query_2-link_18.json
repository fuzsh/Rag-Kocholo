        "text": "By LINDA MULLEN\n\nTribune Staff Writer\n\nThe first time I met my daughter Kasey, she was 5 years old and in a foster home.\n\nI asked why the foster parents didn't want to adopt her, because she had been in their home for more than three years. The answer I received was a fumbling, mumbling \"oh well, Kasey is just ... Kasey.\"\n\nNow I know.\n\nOnly after the adoption was final and the Indiana Department of Health released Kasey's prenatal and infant medical history was she diagnosed as having fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\nHer birth mother admitted to doctors that she did drink alcohol during her pregnancy with Kasey, but records didn't say how much.\n\nShe also said she smoked marijuana occasionally during pregnancy.\n\nBecause I am a kind person, and because it keeps me from using up too much energy on hatred, I choose to believe that Kasey's mother did not know the damage she was doing to her unborn child.\n\nShe probably was unaware of the lifetime of pain she was creating for her daughter, oblivious to the work she was creating for Kasey's caregivers.\n\nKasey was in the hospital for 10 days when she was born. It was suspected that she was a \"coke baby,\" born addicted to cocaine and/or other drugs.\n\nShe went through several foster homes shortly after her first birthday, because she was such a difficult baby.\n\nBy the time I got Kasey, she had been on several drugs, for hyperactivity, depression, sleeping problems and \"failure to thrive.\"\n\nFoster parents said that Kasey often dug through trash for food. Her mother had left her home alone, even as an infant, and Kasey apparently learned this as a means of survival.\n\nMuch to my horror, she practiced those survival skills even after beginning school. At ball games, she'd run her hand underneath bleachers and pick at the gum stuck to them.\n\nUnder the bleachers, she'd also retrieve crumpled bags of popcorn and scavenge for leftovers.\n\nWhenever we're missing food, the first place I look is under Kasey's bed. Yesterday, I found a pound of raw, ground turkey in her closet.\n\nI've found gallons of milk in her closet and empty peanut butter jars under her bed. You could see how she scraped it out with her fingers.\n\nOne night, I heard her in the kitchen at midnight and found her at the refrigerator. Her head was completely tilted back and she was squeezing a full stream of chocolate syrup down her throat.\n\nFive years ago, Kasey would chew her food, but often would refuse to swallow. I suppose those nightly drinks of chocolate syrup, with no one watching, helped her grow. She still does that, sometimes.\n\nUnlike the craving for chocolate, consuming any alcohol during pregnancy should be avoided. The old wives' tale about a daily glass of wine is wrong. Babies with fetal alcohol syndrome have been born to these mothers. Your doctor is wrong if he is still giving this advice.\n\nFAS can be found in all races and all socioeconomic groups, and the costs (for medication, treatment and education) for one FAS child is estimated to be $2 million over a lifetime.\n\nIt can cause physical handicaps, mental retardation and severe behavioral problems.\n\nWhen Kasey was 4, she spoke only two words: \"mama\" and \"snack.\" At age five, she finally began speaking in sentences. Her first sentence I remember was said when she was brushing her hair. She said, \"Oh Mom, I look a fright.\"\n\nHuh?\n\nKasey wakes up wild, having had no medication for more than eight hours. Twice she has climbed up on the breakfast table and kicked off everyone's full cereal bowls.\n\nShe also got a thrill by shoving forks into electrical sockets, just to watch them blow out of the walls. One morning she was so exhilarated over her hamsters, she squeezed one to death.\n\nTo keep her safe, when she wakes up (time determined by sunlight), I give her four pills and send her back into her room or to the family room in the basement for 30 minutes.\n\nShe plays video games until the medication is in her system.\n\nFor a long time, her room was absent of toys, because if they were in there, she played all night and didn't sleep. Once I put a small desk and chair in her room. The next two mornings, I found the chair in bed with her.\n\nActually, Kasey is learning better behaviors and social skills. She's also finally learning to read.\n\nOne of the most important things that I've taught Kasey and her siblings is about alcohol abuse.\n\nKasey is living proof why no one should drink during pregnancy. Kasey is still \"just Kasey,\" but now she's mine and I'm happy about it.\n\nShe truly is \"100 proof.\"\n\nLinda Mullen can be reached in the Plymouth bureau at (219) 936-2920 or by e-mail at lmullen@sbtinfo.com."
