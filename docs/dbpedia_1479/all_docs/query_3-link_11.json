        "text": "Easy Mulligan Stew is a classic recipe made with whatever you happen to have in the kitchen. Also known as, Hobo Stew or Community Stew, it‚Äôs slow simmered flavor is stick-to-your-ribs comfort food that‚Äôs great for cleaning out the fridge.\n\nThis article may contain affiliate links to products I use and love.\n\nMulligan Stew\n\nIf you‚Äôre a fan of comfort meals, this one is for you. This easy Mulligan Stew is the one beef stew recipe that totally reminds me of my childhood. Hearty, rich and not overly complicated in the flavor department. Just simple beef stew using what you have in your kitchen right now.\n\nWe‚Äôre doing a pretty good job of using up the ingredients we currently have on hand. Grocery prices have gone up, we‚Äôre eating all day long at home and food shortages are rumored to be on the horizon. I‚Äôm working on recipes that you can make with pantry staples and leftovers so we‚Äôre wasting as little as possible.\n\nThis Mulligan Stew recipe is as simple as it gets. You can use up all the remaining frozen vegetables, fresh vegetables and freezer meat you have in the fridge at the end of the week‚Ä¶.there are no rules here. And you can spice it up with whatever you have in the spice cabinet to make it your own.\n\nI‚Äôm just providing the most basic beef stew recipe for you to build off of, more of a tutorial in how to make a classic beef stew using some simple techniques to build maximum flavor with what you have on hand.\n\nWhat is Mulligan Stew\n\nIf you‚Äôre not familiar with Mulligan Stew, it‚Äôs a stew that‚Äôs commonly called Hobo Stew or Community Stew in the US. American hobos back in the early 1900‚Äôs used to make this stew in camps to feed their neighbors. The homeless used to pull together all their collected food to create one big stew they could all share.\n\nThat‚Äôs how the stew originated and how we can learn to use up our leftover ingredients from previous meals earlier in the week.\n\nIngredients in Mulligan Stew\n\nNowadays, this recipe is made most often with beef. Mulligan is also the term for ‚ÄúIrishman‚Äù so the stew takes a few queues from a traditional Irish stew in flavor and ingredients.\n\nThis stew recipe, in particular, is made with beef, potatoes and a variety of vegetables like carrots, onions, green beans and peas. Again, you can add whatever ingredients you have in your kitchen the day you‚Äôre pulling this together.\n\nSometimes I like to add Lima Beans and corn, other days, it may be leftover asparagus or cauliflower in place of the potatoes.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have beef, you can even make your Mulligan Stew with chicken or lamb.\n\nHow To Make It\n\nThis easy beef stew couldn‚Äôt be simpler to make.\n\nSimply start with a good quality chuck roast, if you can find one. Otherwise, any type of stew meat will work for this recipe.\n\nCut your roast into bite sized pieces and toss in the cornstarch to coat.\n\nHeat a heavy bottom stock pot or deep dutch oven with a bit of oil over medium high heat. (This is the dutch oven I have and use for almost everything.) Add the meat to the pan and sear until golden on all sides. Transfer to a bowl and drain off all but two tablespoons fat.\n\nReturn the pan to the heat and add the onions, celery and carrots to the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until beginning to caramelize. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute longer.\n\nAdd the tomato paste stirring to coat. Cook until the tomato paste is caramelized and a deep Burgundy color. This will add TONS of flavor to your stew later on.\n\nAdd the seasonings and beef stock. Stir in the frozen vegetables, potatoes and return the meat to the pot. Cover and transfer to the oven for 1 hour.\n\nAlternatively, you can cook this stew on the stovetop over low heat for 1 hour and up to 2 hours.\n\nTips for Perfect Beef Stew\n\nBe sure to buy a good quality roast that‚Äôs good for long braising techniques like chuck roast, bottom round roast, rump roast or shoulder.\n\nPotatoes matter‚Ä¶.make sure you use a good, sturdy, waxy potato like Yukon Gold or red potatoes since they‚Äôll hold together well in the stew. Russet potatoes will fall apart and become mushy in the stew.\n\nDon‚Äôt skip the step of coating your beef in flour or cornstarch before browning. The flour and cornstarch act as a thickening agent when the stew cooks. Skipping this step will leave you with a very loose, broth-y stew.\n\nGive your tomato paste time to caramelize, you will be rewarded with great flavor if you‚Äôre patient.\n\nIf you have wine lying around, you can deglaze the pan with up to 1/2 cup after the tomato paste is caramelized. Scrape up all those brown bits with a wooden spoon for extra flavor. I‚Äôm sure the hobos did this, too. üôÇ\n\nWhat To Serve With Beef Stew\n\nWe like to serve our Mulligan Stew over buttered egg noodles or a pile of mashed potatoes to make it extra hearty. Or you can serve it with a simple salad to make your dinner a little lighter.\n\nYou could even serve it with these easy Two Ingredient Biscuits for dipping!\n\nIf you like this stew recipe, you may also love this Thai Red Curry Beef Stew‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs sooo good with a little spice.
