Cover and turn heat to medium low. Use a spatula to turn over occasionally.\n\nWhen potatoes and onions are beginning to soften, it’s time to add the corned beef. Remove the corned beef from the can and mash it with a fork. Add to potatoes and onions. Open the can of tomatoes (diced, whole or crushed) and pour over everything. Check your consistency. Chances are you’ll need another half a can of tomatoes. It should be stew-like with some liquid but still fairly thick.\n\nCover and let simmer for a few minutes to meld the flavors. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve."
