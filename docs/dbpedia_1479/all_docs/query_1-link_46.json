        "text": "Corby brings new, acoustic, live off the floor music in his new album El Viejo (The Old One) in memory and tribute to his pal Ian Tyson.\n\nCorby says that this album may be his best yet. I completely agree.\n\nHe brings memories of Ian and their time together. Corb also shares his thoughts on how his audiences are different depending on where he’s playing and how the songs of Alberta and cowboy life are received in the rest of Canada, The US and Japan.\n\nFor El Viejo Corb and the Hurtin’ Albertans played live, letting the songs reveal themselves. It was all captured by CKUA Alumni Scott Franchuk.\n\nCorby describes it as “organic”.\n\nWe talked about his name “is that the name of the band?”\n\nTouched on his time with The Smalls and how this music connects to those days. “half urban/indy and half cowboys/ranchers”\n\nWe touched on Hearts on Fire Michael Barclay’s book on “6 years that changed Canadian music” which in its promo mentioned cowboys who used to play speed metal.\n\n“the alt-country music in the late 90’s and 2000’s was littered with x-punks who suddenly discovered acoustic guitar.”\n\nThat’s Corb. The Poet Laureate of the Albertan people.\n\nMarch 5 Corb is in Vancouver at The Orpheum\n\nMarch 7 Grey Eagle Calgary\n\nMarch 9 Midway Edmonton\n\nMarch 22 Zankel Hall / Carnegie Hall NYC\n\nMay 28 Amsterdam\n\nAnd multiple dates in Europe with The Dead South.\n\nFYI – The MS Podcast is the whole conversation – it has some very interesting exchanges, opinions and storytelling.\n\nAnd the video version can be seen and heard on the Terry david Mulligan YouTube Channel.\n\nHour Two in this week’s Stew is actually only 30 minutes long.\n\nI’m going to be talking to singer/songwriter Wyatt C Louis.\n\nWyatt then takes the Cold Bones Stage at 6:30.\n\nThere is so much promise in his music and voice. His songs are thoughtful but best of all memorable.\n\nThe most interesting music I’ve heard in a while. See if you don’t agree.\n\nWyatt’s new album “Chandler” is released on May 24. He’s touring with William Prince on\n\nMonday, Feb 26 N/Jube\n\nTuesday, Feb 27 S/Jube\n\nWyatt is nehiyaw (Plains Cree)\n\nFrom Montana First Nation in Maskwacis (Treaty 6 Territory)\n\nBy the way the C in Wyatt’s name is “Chandler” and thus the album title.\n\n-TDM\n\nPLAYLIST:"
