        "text": "Anyone in the Twin Cities/ Minnesota area planning on attending next Sunday? I loved this tournament last year and am definitely making it this year as well. I have two friends joining me for the first time, possibly three. I am wondering if any from this board are going to show up as well. And if so, what division?\n\nIt is non-sanctioned, so I am probably going to go Advanced, if I am allowed to stay on the same card as those I am travelling with.\n\nYou get exactly one optional mulligan (rethrow) on any shot on each hole but you have to use that throw if you take a mulligan shot. If you used a mulligan on the hole, you put a dot on your scorecard indicating you used it. In the case of ties on total score at the end, the player who used the fewest mulligans wins the tiebreak. So, you want to have a reasonable chance of reducing your score to make it worthwhile to use your mulligan on a hole. Good examples would be if you miss a 30 ft putt or you yank your drive on a 150 ft hole you normally park for birdie."
