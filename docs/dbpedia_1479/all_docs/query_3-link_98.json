        "text": "NEW BRUNSWICK — A new way to teach nutrition in New Jersey is coming in a package labeled “Mulligan Stew.”\n\nThe package, developed by the United States Department of Agriculture, takes the form of a six‐week television series. It stars a five‐piece rock band, The Mulligan Stews, whose members sing and act out the theme, “You Are What You Eat.”\n\n“Mulligan Stew” will be telecast twice each week over Channels 23, 50, 52 and 58. It can be seen on Tuesdays at 3:30 P.M. and on Thursdays at 6:30 P.M., starting this week.\n\nThe series is sponsored jointly by the 4‐H Youth Development and Nutrition Education programs at the Cooperative Extension Service of Cook College, Rutgers University.\n\nA simple, straightforward message with a bright, entertaining format, the program makes children aware of the need to eat a balanced diet without turning them off on the subject of nutrition. Cartoon figures, come‐alive puppets, one‐liners and a bumbling friend named Wilbur Dooright create an atmosphere reminiscent of “LaughIn,” “Sesame Street” and “Mission: Impossible.”\n\nA Wide Audience\n\nAlthough the series was designed originally for fourth‐fifth‐ and six‐graders, reports to the National 4‐H Service Committee from areas where the programs already have been shown indicate that the actual audience is much wider. In episodes with titles such as “The Great Nutrition Turn On,” “Getting It All Together” and “The Racer Who Lost His Edge,” the group solves “Mission: Impossible” type of assignments keyed to real nutritional problems.\n\nIn one segment, the Mulligan Stews enlist the support of NASA astronauts and research scientists; in another, they shop for and prepare a nourishing international dinner for a group of children from all over the world.\n\nDealing with poor breakfasts, digestion, food additives, new foods, natural foods, international foods, food fads, basic food groups, foods of the future, calories, aquaculture (growing food under water) and snacks, the series is also an enrichment source for science, home economics and health classes."
