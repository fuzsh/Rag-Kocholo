        "text": "Brown beef or meat you have chosen. Drain in colander. Add onion to same pot and saute. Put meat back into the pot. Add tomato sauce, water, Worcestershire sacue and bay leaves. Bring this to a boil. Add frozen vegetables carefully (it'll splash if you just dump it in). Bring to a boil again and simmer for about 25 minutes. DO NOT OVERCOOK. Vegetables will be mushy.\n\nAdd salt, pepper and sugar (optional) to taste.\n\nMix cornstarch with water just to dissolve. Pour carefully while mixing into stew. DO NOT just dump it in. You'll find yourself with cornstarch clumps that you can't eat and it will not thicken the stew. If you want it thicker, make more cornstarch mix."
