A family musical by Stephen Schwartz (''Wicked'') about a lonely young boy whose overactive imagination sends him dreaming on Halloween night (55 minutes). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.    'JERSEY BOYS' Opens Nov. 6.

Patti LuPone and Michael Cerveris star in this intimate revival of the Sondheim classic, featuring 10 actors who play their own instruments. It started at the Watermill Theater in England, before moving to the West End and Broadway (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.    Broadway    'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clich√©s of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Ben Brantley).    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY' Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of the great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Anne Midgette).    'THE BLOWIN OF BAILE GALL' Ronan Noone's play concerns the complicated relationships among four laborers and a general contractor renovating a house in Ireland. Mr. Noone draws his characters sharply and surely, but the play is overburdened with conflict. There's enough here to fuel a whole season of a television soap (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444.(Isherwood)    'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers that she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'EINSTEIN'S GIFT'  Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'IN THE CONTINUUM' A spirited, smart and powerful portrait of two black women whose lives are suddenly upended by an H.I.V. diagnosis. Written by and starring Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, who both possess the strong presence and confident technique to bring out the subtle force and potent flavoring in their writing (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, we only use street locators for avenues.(212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel McIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212)868-4444. (Margo Jefferson)    'THE MASTER BUILDER'  A revival that succeeds mainly through a fine performance by Dan Daily as the superstar architect of the title. Mr. Daily brings the character's tangle of contradictions together in a credible performance that manages to find the hidden troll in the artistic genius (2:20). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802.(Wilborn Hampton)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Jefferson)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an entirely Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    'SLUT'  This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Miriam Horn)    *'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer-Prize winning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. (Brantley).    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jefferson)    'WAR IN PARAMUS'  It is supposedly 1970 in Barbara Dana's new family drama, but you'd hardly know it from the generic troubles on display: two clueless parents, two polar-opposite daughters, two crises that could be from any time between the 1950's and today, only obligatory references to the war and the strife of the period (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger).    Off Off Broadway    'THE ASPHALT KISS' Everything in Nelson Rodgrigues's play is exaggerated, from the deliberately melodramatic situation to the repetitive language, enunciated with Mamet-like emphasis. The strange intensity of the play, with its consciously stilted dialogue and acting, may not be to everyone's taste. But this production is an intriguing sample of Rodrigues's highly original voice (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. (Phoebe Hoban)    'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)    'SAINT OEDIPUS' Combines actors and puppets with Greek and Christian myth to create a fierce, virtuosic theater piece (1:10). The Wierszalin Theater of Poland at La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)475-7710. (Jefferson)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    *'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    * 'CRESTFALL' Taking place in a town described by one character as ''this insidious vicinity, the savage quarter, this perpetual crestfall,'' this speeding train of a play, which features three interconnected monologues spoken by a sex addict, a frigid woman and a whore, reveals a writer who loves words almost as much as he does dirty jokes and bloody faces. Since he made his first American splash with ''Howie the Rookie'' in 2001, Mark O'Rowe, who writes likes a mix of Samuel Beckett and Martin McDonagh, has grown in confidence, if not in maturity (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing Sunday. (Zinoman)    'LATE FRAGMENT'  Matthew, a World Trade Center employee who survived Sept. 11, and Marta are a desperate couple falling out of love in Francine Volpe's often perceptive if muddled drama, titled after a Raymond Carver poem. Under the direction of Michael Imperioli (Christopher from ''The Sopranos'') and Zetna Fuentes, the play has a wobbly style, building tension only to diffuse it with less-than-credible moments (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'THE MARILYN TAPES' This doting biographical musical sticks to the highlights of Marilyn Monroe's life with a concentration on romance. Even if Lenore Zann isn't exactly the spit and image of Monroe -- which the Bert Stern photographs in the lobby make clear -- fans of the star will find her mannerisms and, most impressively, her agile, breathy voice quite convincing (1:30). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212)352-3101, closing Sunday.(Zinoman)    *'MEDEA' Sure, she gets most of the attention, but let's take a moment to acknowledge Jason, who, as embodied by Lawrence Winslow in the Classical Theater of Harlem's jolting production, contributes some terrific laughs to Euripides' grim tragedy. Yeah, that's right: laughs, the kind you get from the incongruity of the good ol' boys' network's encountering Gloria Steinem (1:10). Classical Theater of Harlem, at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday.(Isherwood)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'BEFORE THE FALL' (No rating, 110 minutes, in German) Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside one of Hitler's elite schools (used to indoctrinate future leaders) to observe the fate of a young amateur boxer and his sensitive roommate. Though somewhat overdetermined, the film is a chilling testament to the seductiveness of groupthink and the allure of imagined superiority.(Jeannette Catsoulis)    *BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott)    *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carr√©'s novel. (Scott)    *'DOMINO' (R, 113 minutes) A lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills from Tony Scott about the real life and nasty-girl times of a privileged London brat turned South Central bounty hunter named Domino Harvey. (Manohla Dargis)    'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)    'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Dargis)    'THE FOG' (PG-13, 100 minutes) This occasionally scary remake is about a dense, mysterious fog that hides vengeful spirits with a century-old grudge against an Oregon seaside town. At least there's a good-looking young cast, led by Tom Welling of ''Smallville'' and Maggie Grace of ''Lost.'' (Anita Gates)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    *'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)    'THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED' (PG, 115 minutes) A rousing, obvious re-creation of the 1913 United States Open, in which two sons of the working classes faced off in a game still dominated, on both sides of the Atlantic, by the well-born. Aims for par and makes it. (Scott)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    * 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)    * 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy, best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests. (Dargis)    'INNOCENT VOICES' (R, 120 minutes, in Spanish) Alternately powerful and mawkish, ''Innocent Voices'' remembers the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980's through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy from a rural village who faces forcible conscription into the army. (Stephen Holden)    'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)    'LOGGERHEADS' (No rating, 95 minutes) There is so much that is tender and true in Tom Kirkman's sensitively acted film about adoption that the few times it pauses to flaunt its metaphorical conceit about loggerhead turtles, you just have to grit your teeth and wait for the twitches of literary pretension to subside. (Holden)    'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Gates)    'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)    *'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden)    * 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)    * 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)    'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)    'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)    'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis)    * 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)    'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)    'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis)    * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)    'WHERE the TRUTH LIES' (No rating, 107 minutes) Atom Egoyan's drama about a fictional comedy team from the 1950's features an overly knotty murder mystery, a mess of blondes and two fine performances from Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth. (Dargis)    FILM SERIES    AFTER WAR (Through Sunday) The Japan Society's commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, a series of works about wartime and its aftermath, concludes on Sunday.

BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100; $10.

The event continues tomorrow with a double feature. Elia Suleiman's Israeli/Palestinian ''Chronicle of a Disappearance'' (1996) is a series of vignettes about daily life in Nazareth and Jerusalem and their environs.

Cantor Film Center, New York University, 36 East Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)941-3890; $10. (Gates)    SOME LIKE IT WILDER: THE COMPLETE BILLY WILDER (Through Nov. 13) The Museum of the Moving Image is sponsoring a 26-film retrospective of Wilder, the Austrian-born director-writer who gave the world ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''Double Indemnity.'' This weekend's features are ''The Emperor Waltz'' (1948), Wilder's only musical, starring Bing Crosby and Joan Fontaine; ''One, Two, Three'' (1961), a cold-war satire starring James Cagney; and ''Five Graves to Cairo'' (1943), a wartime propaganda thriller with Franchot Tone, Anne Baxter and Erich von Stroheim (as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel). 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077; $10.

ACID MOTHERS TEMPLE (Tonight) The manic Japanese guitarist Kawabata Makoto leads his long-running band in hard-rocking psychedelic explorations rooted in riffy dirt-rock. 7:30, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212)941-8100; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Laura Sinagra)    BEHOLD THE ARCTAPUS, THE ILLEGIBLE DJ CAPS (Sunday) Behold the Arctapus plays smart heavy metal. DJ Caps is one-half of the Caps-n-Jones duo responsible for this year's sublime mix ''Moving in Stereo.'' Hexa also play. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    JELLO BIAFRA AND THE MELVINS (Sunday) The sardonic frontman of the former California punk band the Dead Kennedys now pops up frequently as a talking head for music nostalgia documentaries. Teaming with the proto-grunge Seattle rockers the Melvins, he's still playing jokester on albums like ''Sieg Howdy'' (Alternative Tentacles). 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $17. (Sinagra)    JON BRION (Tuesday) This multi-instrumentalist and producer's scrapped (but widely downloaded) material for Fiona Apple's new CD created a stir. Now he takes time off from such sonic midwifery, film scoring and playing gigs weekly at a Los Angeles cabaret to display his own versatile pop prowess. 7:30 and 10 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212)941-8100; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    TRACY CHAPMAN (Tonight) This singer-songwriter's angsty pop-folk song ''Fast Car,'' a kind of anti-''Born To Run,'' became an instant classic when late-1980's recession sank in, offering a working-class escape fantasy so modest that it was heartbreaking. 6:30, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)564-4882; $39. (Sinagra)    BRUCE COCKBURN (Tomorrow) The smoky-voiced Canadian folk-rocker Bruce Cockburn is just as opinionated and oppositional as he was when he wrote the anti-imperial ''If I Had a Rocket Launcher,'' though recently he has been letting his guitar do the emoting. 8 p.m., Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, www.concertstonight.com, (212)307-7171 ;$30 to $35.(Sinagra)    CREAM (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) All the members of the 60's British power trio behind ''White Room,'' and ''Badge'' are alive and well, but top dollar is required to see if Eric Clapton's slow hand has gotten slower, or the bassist Jack Bruce's bellow less blustery. Ginger Baker's drumming remains agile. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741 ; $64.50 to $354.50. (Sinagra)    VICENTE FERNANDEZ (Tonight) In Mexico, Vicente Fernandez is a household name, a television star who owes his fame to songs about loving, crying and suffering. With his dramatic tenor voice and his wall-shaking vibrato, Mr. Fernandez brings out all the melodrama of Mexican ranchera songs that bounce and laugh as they detail vast heartaches. 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $54.50-$149.50. (Jon Pareles)    ORENDA FINK (Tomorrow) One-half of the ethereal female duo Azure Ray, Ms. Fink performs her own songs, atmospheric alt-rock that draws on her travels to Haiti, Cambodia and India. She opens for the former Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village (212)353-1600; $20. (Sinagra)    FREAKWATER, JOHN PARISH (Thursday) Catherine Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean of Freakwater harmonize like a country duo from decades ago, calmly examining all the disappointments and morbid fantasies -- heartache, suicide, children's deaths -- of a hard life in the boondocks. Now and then, a proudly clever line signals that they're not as rural as they might sound. John Parish has been an essential collaborator for P.J. Harvey and the Eels, playing guitar and keyboard parts distilled to a stark simplicity. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $12. (Pareles)    GANGBE BRASS BAND (Tomorrow) This 10-piece band from Benin in West Africa melds upbeat Yoruban music with global jazz and pop, singing in several of Benin's indigenous languages and French. 10 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $25 to $37. (Sinagra)    PATTERSON HOOD (Tuesday) One of three songwriters in his southern-rock band, the Drive-by Truckers, Patterson Hood possesses an eclectic pop sensibility that perfectly balances his bandmates' honky-tonk jams and southern-gothic anthems. 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $14. (Sinagra)    JAMIROQUA (Monday and Tuesday) Taking its cues from Stevie Wonder, this British dance-pop band led by the madly hatted singer Jay Kay had a hit in the 90's with the blandly groovy ''Virtual Insanity,'' and gained more a jam-band than a dance-music following. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $40. (Sinagra)    JOHN LEGEND (Thursday) The piano-romancing crooner John Legend, a dapper Kanye West prot√©g√©, plays retro soul music with hip-hop cred and a teasingly rough edge. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)749-5838 or (212)864-0372; $45 to $65. (Sinagra)    MAGIK MARKERS (Tomorrow) This noise-rock trio's sound assaults build from shirring buzz and ominous clang to maelstroms of bash and feedback. Kicking and jerking as the spirit moves her, the vocalist-guitarist Elisa Ambrogio surges from hiss to howl, wrestling with her guitar to choke out its most dangerous peals. The group plays between the Ex-Models and Pterodactyl. 10- p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503; $8. (Sinagra)    JAMES MCMURTRY (Tomorrow and Sunday) James McMurtry packs a lot of story into his low-key songs: tales of loners and losers adrift in wide-open spaces. His voice is deadpan, but his characters survive grand struggles. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $15. (Pareles)    MILTON NASCIMENTO (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) Since his heyday in the early 1970's, the versatile Brazilian singer and songwriter Milton Nascimento has been making experimental jazz-pop that often features inventive vocal improvisations. 8 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592; $30.(Sinagra)    ONEIDA (Tonight) The Brooklyn noise-rockers Oneida are a versatile bunch, sliding album to album from hard squall to heavy riffs to Krautrock precision--and, more recently, to droning meditations that seem a sonic correlate to time-lapse images of gathering storm clouds. 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)    THE RAPTURE (Tonight) This Brooklyn band tops its tight dance-punk grooves with the rhythmically yelping panic of the vocalist Luke Jenner, whose tone recalls the Cure's Robert Smith. 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    THE ROGERS SISTERS, SCOUT NIBBLET (Wednesday) Though the Brooklyn power-trio the Rogers Sisters have plied their perky new-wave craft during the recent spate of 80's revivalism in Williamsburg, they take themselves less seriously than most. Scout Nibblet makes stripped-down alt-rock in the vein of early P.J. Harvey. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (Thursday) The sitarist Anoushka Shankar, who has up to this point been an aesthetic acolyte of her father's lithe, neo-traditional take on improvisatory raga, has recently been experimenting with a combination of acoustic and electronic backing instrumentation. 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8770; $30. (Pareles)    SOUL ASYLUM (Wednesday) The scruffy alt-rock band Soul Asylum, best known for the strummy 90's hit ''Runaway Train,'' pays musical tribute to its bassist, Karl Mueller, who died of cancer this year. Tommy Stinson of the Replacements will play bass. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)    STEW (Monday) This Los Angeles pop craftsman writes songs that slip just enough bitters into the 70's lite rock cocktail to make it subversive. His faux-big production on disc isn't required live, because his songs are cabaret to the core. And aside from chuckling at his own asides, he is a consummate performer. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8770; $15 . (Sinagra)    RICHARD THOMPSON, DANNY THOMPSON (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock's smartest misanthrope is also one of its greatest guitarists. Mr. Thompson, one of the architects of British trad-rock in the 1960's, writes songs steeped in Celtic melody and the stoicism of traditional ballads. Then he plugs them in, adding some rock twang, and plays solos that ring with ancient modes and climb harmonic walls. His guitarist son Danny joins him. 9 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824; $25. (Pareles)    MARTHA WAINWRIGHT (Tuesday) Like her parents, Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright, the folk singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright can be roundly sad or quippishly tart. Like her brother Rufus, whose taste in furniture she sings about with proud envy, she's a talented drizzler of faint praise. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    HANK WILLIAMS III (Thursday) Diverging from Hank Williams Jr.'s caricature, this country music scion plays countrified alt-rock without milking his heritage. His voice has the high, lonesome twang, but his concerns are up to the minute. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    SUZANNE VEGA (Thursday) With her cool, matter-of-fact delivery on 80's hits like ''Luka'' and ''Tom's Diner,'' this singer-songwriter sings from that sometimes spooky emotional space where the quotidian mirrors the tragic. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)501-1390; $32 to $38. (Sinagra)    WOLF PARADE (Monday) Another of the art-pop bands from Montreal that include Arcade Fire and Unicorns, Wolf Parade has a Northern noir take on keyboard-heavy epics. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $14 (sold out). (Sinagra)    ZAKK WYLDE BLACK LABEL SOCIETY (Wednesday) Mr. Wylde, the heavy-metal guitarist best known for his stints with Ozzy Osbourne's band, is outspoken on matters of sex, beer and country. He loves them all. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $28. (Sinagra)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

(Chinen)    JAMES FINN TRIO (Wednesday) On his recent album, ''Plaza de Toros'' (Clean Feed), the tenor saxophonist James Finn teased out a connection between bullfighting and free jazz, with appropriate doses of bravado and humor; he steps back into the ring with Jaribu Shahid on bass and Warren Smith on drums. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, at Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; no cover.

(Bernard Holland)    'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEUE' (Tomorrow) Paul Dukas's mysterious 1907 opera tells the legend of Duke Bluebeard and his disappearing wives from a woman's point of view. That this rich work has become a rarity is inexplicable. Thanks go to the New York City Opera for this new production, suitably Symbolist in look. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Anthony Tommasini)    'IL BARBiERe DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow) The New York City Opera's production of this Rossini classic is an efficient, attractive frame for the composer's florid score, and the company has a generally strong cast, with Hugh Russell as Figaro, Jennifer Rivera as Rosina and John Tessier as the Count. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Allan Kozinn)    'LA CENERENTOLA' (Monday) Olga Borodina's mezzo-soprano is slightly dark for the title role in Rossini's Cinderella story, but she has the clarity and agility to bring this virtuosic, richly ornamental music to life.

(Anne Midgette)    'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Thursday) Nicolas Jo√´l's production of Donizetti's most popular opera seemed pointlessly opulent, murky, confusing and cluttered when it was first presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 1998.

The cast, which looks to be strong, includes Elizabeth Futral as the mentally fragile Lucia.

(Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'√™tre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)    *THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Faberg√©. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)    *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Glueck).    *JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212)423-3200. (Glueck)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video-and-photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13. During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Johnson)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was, in fact, one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3676. (Glueck)    Galleries: Uptown    'Yinka Shonibare Selects: Works from the Permanent Collection' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8300, through May 6. (Johnson)    'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age and the global consumerist economy. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'Harry Kramer' The spirit of Abstract Expressionism lives on in the work of an artist who has been exhibiting in New York regularly since 1970. But Mr. Kramer's lusciously colored compositions of slashing gestures and planes of thick paint are more seductive than confrontational. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through Nov. 5. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'Contemporary Obscurists' Works by contemporary artists who use the camera obscura in variously inventive ways include Vera Lutter's huge negative image of an abandoned factory interior; Shi Guorui's ghostly, panoramic view of Shanghai; and Abelardo Morell's magical photographs of bedrooms with upside-down views of the city projected onto their interior walls. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212)741-4764, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    Franklin Evans, 'freakout' If you like Mr. Evans's densely worked neo-psychedelic mural in the Drawing Center's current emerging artists show, you will appreciate the ink-and-watercolor drawings on view here. Crammed with richly colored geometric patterns, abstracted landscapes and figures, they are both trippy and intimately sensuous. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212)989-0156, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)    YINKA SHONIBARE: 'MOBILITY' This British sculptor presents two spare installations using his signature post-colonialist symbol: the headless mannequin in 19th-century European clothes cut from African fabrics. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)    Sue Williams Few artists have combined figurative abstract painting and existential disgust as variously and effectively as Sue Williams has, and the trajectory continues in this show of new work. Here the battered body parts and de Kooning-esque swipes of the past have been distilled into a tumorous universe of genitals, anuses and noxious emissions, as the biological becomes political. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)255-1121, through Oct. 29. (Cotter)    Other Galleries    *Andr√© KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)    'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212)213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)    LineAge: 'Selections Fall 2005' Among works by nine emerging artists in this entertaining show are poetic, notarized documents by CarianaCarianne, who claims to be two people in one body; intricately cutout linear abstractions by Adam Fowler; big drawings of human navels by Susan D'Amato; and a sculpture by Monika Grzymala, made by wrapping 4.4 miles of paper tape around three columns in the gallery. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)219-2166, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)    *MACCHINE NATURALI: 'ABSTRACT COLLAGES BY JOSEPH STELLA' The largest New York show in some time of Stella's elegant, understated collages, made from dirt-stained scraps of paper, can thoroughly rearrange your grasp of his sensibility and the history of American Modernism. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212)966-5154, through Oct. 29. (Smith)    *'NINE CONTEMPORARY SCULPTORS: FELLOWS OF THE SAINT-GAUDENS MEMORIAL' A lively link between past and present is the Fellowship of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a foundation set up in 1977 to honor the great 19th-century American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Each year the foundation has chosen a contemporary American sculptor to receive a cash award ($10,000) and the opportunity for an eight-week summer show at the Saint-Gaudens estate in Cornish, N.H. This smartly selected exhibition presents representative work by nine award winners, ranging from a huge cube by Tara Donovan, made entirely of toothpicks (2003), to a mini-city sprawled on a vast tabletop, whose buildings of solid graphite were wrought by Alex McFarlane (1983). Saint-Gaudens's own work appears in it, too; surprisingly, it doesn't seem all that far out of context. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212)713-2885, through Dec. 2. (Glueck)    *Evan Penny: 'No-One In Particular' This Toronto-based sculptor creates astoundingly realistic and, in some cases, weirdly distorted bigger-than-life busts of people out of silicone, rubber, hair and other materials. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)999-7337, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)    Last Chance    *Robert Bordo A beautiful, quietistic show by a painter whose work always manages to be both grounded and ethereal, soundless and resonant, abstract and not. Mr. Bordo is at midcareer. The time for a retrospective view is at hand. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)367-7474, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    *Adam Dant: 'Standing under' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    Claire Fontaine Politically charged works by this French artist include a neon-light work that outlines the image of a hooded Iraqi prisoner and child; a neon sign in the gallery's front window that says in Arabic, ''Foreigners Everywhere''; and a tiny sculpture called ''In God We Trust'' in the form of a 25-cent coin with a fold-out box cutter secreted inside. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)477-5006, closing today. (Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON'  Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    'Tracking Suburbia' AND 'Do You Like Stuff?' From Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Schnyder's more-than-30-foot-long photograph of every building on the road between two Swiss towns in ''Tracking Suburbia'' to Frank Olive's countertop display of 100 items you could buy cheaply in a drugstore in ''Do You Like Stuff?,'' these two smart and wry group shows invite meditation on modern materialism. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, SoHo, (212)925-2035, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show says. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600, closing on Sunday. (Michael Kimmelman)    NEIL WELLIVER: 'A MEMORIAL EXHIBITION,' Five large paintings from the late 1970's and early 80's make an exhilarating tribute to this esteemed painter of Maine landscapes, who died last April at 75. Measuring up to 8 by 10 feet, the canvases depict dense woods, a rocky summit and marshland with beaver dams, and they are painted with generous, wide-brush strokes and a keen eye for natural light and texture. They are at once vividly realistic, expressively abstract and sensuously physical. Alexandre, 41 East 57th Street, (212)755-2828, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    HENRY WOLF Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)",
