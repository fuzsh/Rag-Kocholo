Vancouver in 1967 at the height of the Summer of Love and hanging with Cheech and Chong at the famous and now-gone Oil Can Harrys club. Prepping feverishly, as a newbie to television, for an interview with Jimi Hendrix and shopping on Davie Street with Jim Morrison, who was looking for early Hemingway books and Beatle boots. Hes a man whos followed his passions, and theyve taken him from the music world to the actors studio to the wine industry.
