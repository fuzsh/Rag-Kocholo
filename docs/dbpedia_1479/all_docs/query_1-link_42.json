        "text": "One of my favorite meals that my grandmother made was Mulligan stew. She had no patience to teach anyone how to make it. Fortunately, my brother also liked it. He observed her preparations for the stew and then wrote them down.\n\n3 pounds stew beef\n\n6 to 8 medium-to-large potatoes\n\n2 medium onions, chopped\n\n1 cup tomato catsup\n\n3 to 4 tablespoons chili powder\n\nSalt to taste\n\nButchers often slice beef into two-inch square chunks. That’s too large for a spoon and gave me lots of trouble as a child eating this in my soup.\n\nOne thing I do (that my grandmother didn’t) is cut the stew beef into bite-sized portions before cooking.\n\nRinse the meat and add to a large pot. Cover with cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt or season to taste. Cook over medium heat until almost done, about 45 minutes.\n\nI use 8 potatoes because I love them in this stew. Peel and cut potatoes into spoon-sized portions.\n\nWhen the meat is almost done, add potatoes and onions. Stir in a cup of catsup. If you add too much, the stew has a sweet taste. (You may prefer that taste. I modify recipes all the time. I’d suggest trying this amount of catsup the first time and see what you think.)\n\nAdd 3 to 4 tablespoons of chili powder. I used closer to 4 tablespoons in mine. Stir well.\n\nContinue cooking until the potatoes are tender.\n\nIf you cook this in a crock pot, add all ingredients at the beginning and stir well.\n\nI served the stew with rolls. My grandmother served them with bread. Some people prefer crackers.\n\nMy brother asked me to make this stew on a recent visit. He said it was seasoned perfectly. High praise from someone who remembers my grandmother’s stew!\n\nI’d love to hear if you try this recipe. Enjoy!\n\n-Sandra Merville Hart"
