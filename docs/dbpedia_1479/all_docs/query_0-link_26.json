        "text": "This past year’s Burger Tour was quite the undertaking. The roster of “to-be-had” was massive. The list was 102 restaurants deep. These included burger-specific restaurants, diners, casual dining, and more. The list was compiled from suggestions from readers, listeners, friends, and things that I was wanting to try.\n\nI wasn’t alone in this. Street Team Steven was a sponsor of this tour. He accompanied me to a large portion of the restaurants. We talked and conferred but all the ratings were mine. My wife, Stephanie, went with me for several of them, as well. The same went for her, too. She had some say but the rating was mine to make. My friend Jeff Davids sponsored one of the burgers, too.\n\nTo recap the tour, we started this on March 22, 2021 (which oddly enough, is a year tomorrow), and it ran until the week after Thanksgiving. Yes, there were 102 to choose from but I didn’t get to all of them. I couldn’t (and really shouldn’t) have more than 3 or 4 a week. I had to have some breaks. Some that were missed were ones that I really wanted to get to but just didn’t for whatever reason, whether for proximity, convenience, or honestly, desire. Not that I didn’t want to go to some of them but because there were others that I felt I needed to try more. The ones that I missed outside of the Winston-Salem area were because of the distance. The ones outside Winston that I did have were ones that I was either working in that area on an outside project or Steven and I went there together.\n\nI’m going to remind you of the 2019 Burger Tour results. It was the Top 10 burgers in the area. Starting from the 10th and counting down:\n\n10. Small Batch\n\n9. Max Burger\n\n8. West End Cafe\n\n7. Cin-Cin Burger Bar\n\n6. Canteen Market & Bistro\n\n5. Food Freaks of NC Food Truck\n\n4. Zito Pizzeria and Grill\n\n3. Social. Southern Kitchen & Cocktails\n\n2. Zesto Burgers & Ice Cream\n\n1. Boone Doggies\n\nOf those 10, three are no longer in business at all (Zesto, Social. Max Burger); two have changed their concepts (Small Batch, Canteen); one was a food truck that isn’t out much but has a brick and mortar (Food Freaks); and four that are still doing what they were doing, mostly. The “mostly” I’ll talk about in a bit.\n\nThese burgers were different kinds of burgers going up against each other. The list had specialty burgers, pub burgers, diner burgers, weird burgers, and so on. This year, I decided that to be a contender for the list, it was going to have to be a “standard” ingredient burger. That means, as close as possible, it was going to be cheese, mayo, pickle, tomato, onion, sometimes mustard. Perhaps some shredded lettuce if that was the lettuce style, no whole-leaf iceberg or other leaf lettuce were allowed but I did allow spinach as a substitute. If there was a burger sauce like a “special sauce” or Russian dressing type thing, we used that instead of the mayo. The difference wasn’t really noticeable in the grand scheme of things. Some of the ones on this year’s list are pub burgers, others are diner burgers. Pub burgers are usually around 7-8 oz. Diner burgers are generally 3-4 oz. Some of the burgers are fresh beef and some are frozen. I have found that I don’t mind frozen beef as long as the final product is seasoned well and done right.\n\nFor this year, Steven and I devised a system to allow me to put a numerical rating into six different categories. Those categories were “Flavor,” “Quality of Ingredients,” “Presentation,” “Aroma,” “Order Correctness,” and “Overall Happiness.” It wasn’t a straight, across-the-board weighting, either. Order correctness and aroma were 5% each of the total rating. The presentation was 10%. Quality of ingredients 20%. Flavor 25%. Overall Happiness was 35% of the rating. Because, to me what I felt while eating it, the enjoyment of the burger, and the ambiance in which I was consuming it matters a lot to me. After all, the whole purpose is the experience, at least to me. All of those categories equal 100%.\n\nFor this year’s final list I expanded to a Top 15 and really, that’s a misnomer because Nos. 10-15 are basically tied and mostly interchangeable.\n\nThere are some that we couldn’t put in the contention for the official ranking because of several factors; some of which are chains (smaller or otherwise), specialty burgers, availability, etc.\n\nHere are the burgers I did get to:\n\n4th Street Filling Station, 601 Burgers and Brews, 6th & Vine, A Slice of Napoli, Allen’s Dairy Treats, Antojitos Las Delicias, Big Burger Spot (Greensboro Guilford College Area), Big Burger Spot (Kernersville), Big Burger Spot 2 (Greensboro Battleground), Bobo’s Deli & Grill, Boone Doggies, Cafe Arthurs, Cagney’s, Campus Gas, Carolina Ale House, Char’s Hamburgers, Cin Cin Burger Bar, Culver’s, Dari-O, DB’s Grill, Earl’s, Food Freaks, Foothill’s Brewpub (Downtown WSNC), Foothill’s Grill & Tap (King, not related to the brewery), Frank’s New York Style Pizza and Subs (Rural Hall), Grandma Ruby’s, Greek Guys Grill, Hero House, Hop’s Burger Bar WSNC, Hot Dog City, Joe’s Take-Out (Clemmons), John Brown’s Country Store and Grill (King), Johnny B’s Grillhouse, Kermit’s Hot Dogs, King’s Hot Dogs (Rural Hall), Little Red Caboose, Local Artisan (which is currently closed), Mama Zoe Michaels, Mojito (Mojito Burger), Mozelle’s, Mr. Barbecue, Munch Box, Nicks Old-Fashioned Burgers (Welcome), P.B.’s Takeout, Papa Lee’s Grill (currently closed), Piedmont Aviation Snack Bar, Pine Tree Tavern, Putter’s, Quiet Pint Tavern, Rudy’s Cafe & Catering (Greensboro), Small Batch HP, Thunder Road, Times Square Pizza (now The Pizza Place), TJ’s Deli (Parkway), Tuning Fork Provisions, Twin Peaks Restaurant, Wake Mart – Exxon (4100 Cherry), West End Cafe, Willow’s Bistro, Young Cardinal Cafe, Zito’s Pizzeria & Grill, and Zoe’s Kitchen (Trenwest).\n\nHere are the places I had on the list but did not get to:\n\n66 Pizza, 801 Southern Kitchen and Pancake House (Advance), Beef-Burger (Greensboro), Brick Oven Pizza (Clemmons), Burger Supreme (truck), Davie Tavern, Diamondback Grill, Doss’s (Kernersville), East Coast Wings, Grey’s Tavern (Greensboro), Hop’s Burger Bar GSO, J Butler’s, Jeffery Adams, Kickback Jack’s, King’s Crab Shack, Krankies, Lone Star Burger (High Point), Mayberry Ice Cream, Midtown Cafe, Milners, Mossy’s (Clemmons), Old 64 Diner, Old Richmond Grill, Pfafftown Kitchen, Porterhouse Burger Co (High Point), Riverbirch Lodge, Sir Winston, Small Batch WSNC, Sweet Potatoes, The Katherine, The Loop Restaurant, Tipsy’s Tavern (High Point), Tucker’s Grill (Hornytown), Twin City Minis (truck), Villa Grill (Clemmons), Whatyasay Burgers (truck), Zoe’s (Old Walkertown Rd).\n\nAs I said, some of the ones I couldn’t get to were a matter of location and convenience. I had to go to many of these in-between work and lunch hour times, so I couldn’t get to a lot of the outlying places unless Steven and I were making a trip out of it. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to try them. It just wasn’t in the cards this time around.\n\nOn this tour, I am sorry to say that I had some of the worst burgers I’ve ever had in my life. I am not going to mention who they are because I’m about building up my local food establishments, not tearing them down and I think that for the most part, these restaurants offer a lot of good outside of the not-so-good burgers on their menus or they just so happened to have a burger on the menu but they specialize in other cuisines.\n\nThere are some that we couldn’t put in the contention for the official ranking because of several factors; some of which are chains (smaller or otherwise), specialty burgers, availability, etc.\n\nBefore we get to the list, I want to go over some honorable mentions and/or explanations.\n\n*Diamondback Grill, I did have a specialty burger but not their regular menu burger so I couldn’t count that. Plus, being as they are a sponsor of mine, I wouldn’t have included them in the rankings. This way there was no claim of favoritism given to that. The same goes for Mojito Latin Soul Food where I did have their Mojito Burger.\n\nTwo of the last lists’ Top 10 were left off this time.\n\n*Food Freaks couldn’t count because their menu specifically and explicitly says there are no lettuce, tomato, or pickles available. So, it can be a specialty burger, which we had the Godfather and Puff Mento, but still not in compliance with the rules this time around.\n\n*Zito’s Pizzeria scored a 90 and would have pushed numbers 10-15 out of the list altogether. However, because the burger isn’t conspicuous on the menu and she doesn’t have beef all the time (she uses it for the meat sauces and such), I couldn’t count it. But, if you’re going there and want a burger, call ahead to see if they have the beef they need for it. It’s worth it if they do have it.\n\nThere are a few “chains” that could have shown up in the top list, but because I’m narrowing the list to “local independents,” I chose not to include them on the list proper, but here’s how some of the stacked up:\n\n*Culver’s rated a 91. It’s one of the best burgers in town, actually, and Vikram is community-minded and wants to be involved. Give them a try, and… cheese curds.\n\n*Dairi-O. Yes, I know they’re local but they have more than three locations and are a little bigger than I’d like for the “local” aspect. They rated an 89 and I really like their double cheeseburgers. I have been several times for “unofficial” burgers. I do suggest you try them if you haven’t.\n\n*Twin Peaks. They were better than I expected and had a score of 84 which would tie the 15-10 spots but, they’re part of Fat Brands which includes over 2000 restaurant locations worldwide.\n\nSo, here it is. I’m going to start from #15 and count down. I reiterate that numbers 15-10 could have been any number, so just because one is #11 doesn’t mean it did better than the one before it, I just had to put one somewhere. The numbers in parentheses are how that location rated out of a possible 100.\n\n#15 — Nick’s Old Fashioned Hamburger (84)\n\nStreet Team Steven went here to try not only the burger but the tenderloin sandwich, too. I will be 100% upfront here, I’ve had better burgers from Nick’s than we did on this trip. The ratings were for this trip, no matter how much I’d had before (and I have had Nick’s several times). Even with that, though, it was still a strong burger. Mayo, pickles, tomato, onion, and cheese. We had not only a single cheeseburger and the tenderloin sandwich, but a double burger. I think that Steven and I both agreed that the double was the way to go. Had I had this on the 2019 tour, they probably would have been in the top 10. Nick’s is in Welcome at 6999 Old US Highway 52 (just past North Davidson High School).\n\n#14 — Big Burger Spot – Kernersville (84)\n\nThe two Greensboro locations did fairly well, too (one at 80 and the other at 79), but the K-Ville location won due to the “overall happiness” rating. The experience was better here, not that it wasn’t before the onion rings were spectacular, too and that adds to the experience. The burger, though, was solid. All three locations were solid, actually. I think part of it was the owner actually made the burger there. He just so happened to be in that day. Stephanie and I ate there on the way back from Greensboro, where I was working for the day. Mayo, pickles, tomato, onion, mustard, ketchup, cheese. Pub burger with diner burger personality. The experience was more “diner.” Big Burger Spot, 803 Old Winston Road, Kernersville.\n\n#13 — Hero House (84)\n\nThis was recommended to me by my friend Paul Jones and while I have eaten at Hero House before, it has been a long, long, long time. Mostly because it’s on Stratford Road and can be a pain to get in and out of. I just went for a late lunch and missed most of that traffic. But, I’m so glad Paul put me on this burger. It had this great under-flavor of onions like many diner burgers have and many others should have. Mayo, pickles, tomato, onion, cheese. Hero House is a great family-owned business, too. They do good work. 914 South Stratford Road, WSNC.\n\n#12 — West End Cafe (84)\n\nHere’s our first return burger from the 2019 list: the Cheeseburger Grinder. West End Cafe does everything well. I’ve never had a bad meal there. GM John McLemore introduced this to me in 2019 and I returned to it this time, too. This is a burger patty formed in the shape of a rectangle and topped with Thousand Island dressing, spinach (instead of lettuce), tomato, onion, pickle, American and pepper jack cheeses on a hoagie bun. It was a darn fine burger. A bit messy, but delicious. West End Cafe is at 926 W 4th St., WSNC.\n\n#11 — Antojitos Las Delicias (84)\n\nThis was a bit different and a wonderful surprise. A Mexican burger. My Facebook friend Sarai’s mother owns this restaurant and had mentioned that they do a burger. I had to try it. So, in addition to mayo for this, they have avocado as a spread and it added a whole different dimension to the burger. I’m not sure which cheese they use, but it was really good. Here’s a pro tip for you: just get a single patty, you won’t need a second one. Trust me. Antojitos Las Delicias is located at 1521 E 5th St in WSNC. and is take-out only.\n\n#10 — Mozelle’s Fresh Southern Bistro (84)\n\nThe Chef’s Double from Chef Jay Pierce. Let me tell you this burger was one huge mess. In fact, it would have rated higher but it was falling apart from so much stuff happening with it. All that, though, and it was delicious, worthy of a higher placement but the “Overall Happiness” factor took a bit of a hit. Two smashed Brasstown beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, American cheese, pickles, onions, on a brioche bun. Mozelle’s is at 878 W 4th Street in WSNC, just two doors up from West End Cafe. Never a bad meal there, either. Mozelle’s always does amazing work.\n\nOkay, so here we go into the Top 9, where most of the ratings were different.\n\n#9 — Young Cardinal Cafe (86)\n\nThe YC Burger, a pub burger with a 6oz. ground beef patty, onion aioli, pickle slices, sliced tomato, cheddar cheese. I do wish that there was a cheese option that wasn’t cheddar, as I don’t like cheddar on my burgers, but this was white cheddar, which melts a little better so it wasn’t a deal killer. The onion aioli was a bit messy but the flavors were amazing. Chefs Andrews and Swing do amazing work at YCC and I am so glad I had this one, on our anniversary, by the way. The patty was cooked just right and all the ingredients popped well together. Juicy, messy, delicious. YCC is located at 424 4th Street in WSNC.\n\n#8 — King’s Hot Dogs (87)\n\nKing’s Hot Dogs was on the monster Friday trip that Stephanie and Steven and I took to King and Rural Hall. We tried four burgers that day. Steven and I split all four so we really only had two whole burgers. Anyway, with the break and travel in between, we were getting loaded up pretty fast. This was the last one that we had that day and truthfully, I didn’t want it and didn’t enjoy it. It was way too much to try at once and while I don’t usually give second chances, this wasn’t King’s Hot Dogs’ fault. It was mine. So, I went back, on my own to give it a fair shake. That was a darn fine burger and I’m so glad I went back. Double patties, mayo, pickles, tomato, onion, and lite mustard. King’s Hot Dogs is located at 1009 Bethania Rural Hall Rd, in Rural Hall. The picture is from the first trip.\n\n#7 — Greek Guys Grill (88)\n\nThis was another surprise. This is almost certainly a frozen patty. But, this is the perfect example of taking a frozen patty and making it taste delicious. Stephanie and I stopped after going to her mom’s for the nightly check-in. It wasn’t on the list but I saw it on the menu and decided to give it a shot. It was seasoned so well and the ingredients so fresh, that it made me go, “mmm” out loud. Stephanie had one, as well and she agreed with me. It was a double diner patty, mayo, pickles, tomato, onion on a sesame seed bun, which I generally don’t like, but the seeds were sparse and not in the way and not distracting. When we drive by here going to her mom’s, I think, “man, I could go for a Greek Guys’ Burger.” Greek Guys Grill is located at 2545 Somerset Center Dr, WSNC.\n\n#6 — Piedmont Aviation Snack Bar (88)\n\nAnother huge surprise for me. I had seen it in passing and didn’t know if it was actually open. I had noticed it on the DoorDash menu, as well. I just didn’t know much about it. I saw a friend talk about it and decided to jump in there and try it. It’s another situation of taking a frozen patty and making magic with it. Much of the score here is from my enjoyment from eating it, but I cannot take anything away from the flavors. The seasoned grill with years of use along with fresh ingredients and proper seasoning on the patties is certainly magic. It was a double diner patty, mayo, pickles, tomato, onion. I have said this a bit in the last few months, but PASB is a hidden gem in this town and we need to make it less hidden. You won’t be sorry. PASB is located at 3820 N. Liberty St, WSNC. The reason this got #6 is that it had no category below an “8” rating.\n\n#5 — Hops Burger Bar WSNC (89)\n\nThis was a definite surprise. Anyone reading this and having been in WSNC for the last 3 years is probably questioning why it was a surprise. Well, in 2019, Hops Burger Bar had just opened. There was a lot of hype that I didn’t really understand, and in some ways still don’t. But, when Steven and I went for a burger, it was underwhelming, to say the least. This time around, with time to season the grill and the employees, they were able to knock it out of the park. While we had two burgers, “The Spicy Goat” (with goat cheese, applewood bacon, sweet and spicy jelly, and lettuce) which we got just to try, and the “Hops Classic.” The classic came with American cheese, applewood bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, ketchup, mustard, and mayo. Now, I can’t remember what it was but something was wrong with our order. Either it was supposed to not have lettuce on it and did, or something was left off that was supposed to be on it. In the ratings, I nicked it a bit for that. But, my silly self didn’t put down what it was. But, I will say, Steven and I were both very pleased with the Hops Classic. Hops Burger Bar WSNC is located at 901 Reynolda Rd.\n\n#4 — Mr. Barbecue (89)\n\nWhen I did my rankings in 2019, I had said that this would have been my #3, but a devastating fire closed the restaurant and led to its rebuild in early 2021. Mr. Barbecue has risen to my top 4 even if they don’t have the “Jumbo-sized” burgers that they used to have. This is always a solid burger, almost what a diner burger should be, frozen or not (which I’m not sure it is frozen). And, probably a good bit of it is that I just enjoy eating at Mr. Barbecue. We did without it for a period of time and that was harsh. I always get mine, mayo, pickles, tomato, onion. It’s my comfort food. Mr. Barbecue (and Miss Fried Chicken) is located at 1381 Peters Creek Pkwy, WSNC. Mr. BBQ eeked out Hops because the order correctness was a 10 for BBQ and 9 for Hops.\n\nAnd here is the TOP THREE!!\n\n#3 — Joe’s Take-Out (90)\n\nHere we are, top three. Joe’s Take-Out in Clemmons was a “double” so to speak because I had scoped it out prior to the tour’s start. But, nonetheless, Steven and I tried three burgers when we went, the BBQ Burger (which was a specialty burger with BBQ sauce, cheddar, and an onion ring), the OKC Burger (cooked on top of onions, mayo, pickles, tomato, and light mustard), and the Smashed Joe’s Burger. The latter was the one that counted for this. It was mayo, pickles, tomato, onion, and mustard, with cheese, of course. The seasoning was really, really good, the ingredients were very fresh and you could taste it. The onions were crisp, the tomato juicy but not too, pickles crunched and the patty was perfectly smashed. It was a really good burger and it is well-deserving of the #3 spot. Joe’s Take-Out is in the Tanglewood Commons Shopping Center across from Tanglewood Park at 4124 Clemmons Rd.\n\n#2 — 601 Burgers and Brews (92)\n\nThis was probably the biggest surprise for Steven and me on the Burger Tour ’21. We had no expectations and even joked about some of the menu items, expecting it to be a mediocre experience. We could not have been any more wrong. What we got was popped in the mouth with burger magic. We had two burgers (split between us). One was the misnamed, Smash Burger, which should be called “smashed” burger because unlike a traditional smash burger that has two smaller patties that start in a ball and are smashed onto the grill, forming a good crust and char, this was a burger that was smashed onto the grill after being assembled; bun and all. Now, while we laughed at it (we’re not proud), we stopped laughing and were pleasantly surprised at the flavors. Double patty, pimento cheese, Candied Bacon, and smashed grilled on a Brioche Bun. But that wasn’t the “official” burger. The official burger is called “Old Glory” and Steven and I still talk about this burger when we meet up for lunch. American cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato, mayo, and we added onion. Y’all… this burger was near perfection. Properly seasoned and juicy patties, crisp pickles, wonderfully plump but not messy tomato, and a little more lettuce than I wanted so I removed some but that didn’t at all impact the burger. To top it off, the sidewinder chips, which are puffed-on-the-inside, crispy-on-the-outside french fries shaped like little half-moons were the bombdiggity. I can’t believe I just used that word, but oh well. The restaurant is located at 2203 N US-601, Mocksville. It would probably be worthy of the top spot, except…\n\n#1 — Boone Doggies (99)\n\nThe reigning champion returns and kicks butt on retaining its title. I went in knowing that Boone Doggies was going to be hard to beat. I’ve eaten there several times since 2019 and every time, it’s heaven in my mouth. There were some good contenders on the list, but none of them, no matter how hard they tried, could knock Boone Doggies from atop the mountain. Smash burgers, the way they were meant to be with amazing flavor, char, and crust. We had three burgers, but only one of them counted. These are the same three burgers we had in 2019 and we just wanted to revisit to make sure all was right in Burgerland. First, the two that didn’t count for ranking but counted in so many other ways. The Rock, with mayo, homemade BBQ sauce, bacon, grilled onions, and American cheese. Oh, yes. The Peacock, with mayo, homemade pimento cheese (made by Drew’s father), bacon, lettuce, and tomato. Yes, again! But the one you need to know about, in relation to this list, is The Grandfather. This is the classic burger. Two smashed patties, mayo, pickles, tomato, onion, shredded lettuce, and love. I’m not at all religious but this almost makes me find the Lord. This is 100% everything a smash burger or any burger, in general, should taste like and be. The rating should actually be 100 but, I did take a half-point away because I had to drive so far to get there. But it was worth every mile. Boone Doggies is located at 566 E Main St. in Yadkinville. Update: Boone Doggies has announced that they will be closing their Yadkinville location at the end of the month, but they will be concentrating on their Mocksville Location, which has all the same things and then some. That is at the Colin Creek Golf Club:\n\n2251 US Highway 64 East, Mocksville.\n\nThere you have it. The Man Who Ate the Town’s Burger Tour ’21 recap. Which of these is your favorite? Do you disagree with me? I welcome comments and friendly discourse. I don’t want to hear that the list was biased because as with 2019’s list, we learned that it very much IS biased. It’s my list, with my rating, with my opinion, with my blog, and my podcast. So it is my bias.\n\nI had a great time doing these burgers, but I have a doctor’s appointment this week and I doubt he’ll share my jubilation. So, Street Team Steven, my wife, Stephanie, and I are looking for the next “tour” for 2022. I think Cheesesteak has been mentioned, but I’d like to hear thoughts on other tours we could do. Burritos, tacos, pizza, subs, sushi (although that can get expensive), and so on. Throw them at me.\n\nThank you, as always to Street Team Steven for supporting this blog and podcast and being a fun food partner with my wife and me. Thank you to Mojito Latin Soul Food and Diamondback Grill for your support of my efforts. Thanks to the listeners of the podcast and readers of this blog for your valuable support.\n\nIn May, I announced that I was embarking on a quest for the “best burger in Winston-Salem.” I declared it the “Summer of Burgers” and said I was looking for my top 10 burgers in town and would formulate a list from there. My wife and my doctor both grimaced when I said I was going to do this and I had to make promises as to the practice.\n\nSo, let’s review. I could only have three burgers a week with some green/healthier things in between. Toward the end of the summer, I had to have a few more to get the ones in that I needed to get in. I went to places that my readers, listeners and friends recommended. I tried to get every recommendation in but I didn’t achieve that, either by lack of funds available or just timing. A few of the burgers on the tour was sponsored by said listeners, readers and friends.\n\nSo, before I go any further, I want to thank those who did sponsor burgers for me. Daniel Butner, owner of Carrabba’s and our sponsor on this blog and podcast sponsored the Blarney Burger at Finnigan’s Wake and the burger at King’s Crab Shack. “Street Team” member, Steven McDowall sponsored the Boone Doggies trip and Thunder Road Grill burger. Steven Gallo sponsored the Krankie’s burger. My pal Jeff Davids sponsored both the Small Batch “Morning After” burger and Zesto’s “Chubby Decker” burger. Jason Cobb and Yamas! Mediterranean Street Food donated $50 for gas on the “tour.” Brandon Cassidy of Food Freaks, Chef Travis Myers of Willows Bistro, Chef David Swing of Sir Winston, Chef Antwan Hairston of Mac & Nelli’s, and my friend Dawn McDaniel with Bad Daddy’s did sponsor their own burgers. None of the sponsorship consideration influenced the correlating establishment’s standing in this list. No advantage was given for me not having to pay for them. That being said, thank you all so very much for your help and consideration in this very fun and delicious project.\n\nNow, let’s get to the “housekeeping” stuff. I didn’t get to everyone. I just couldn’t. There is a burger in almost every restaurant, it seems. In some, those are the focus and in others, it’s just a menu placeholder. I tried to get to the ones that people were the most adamant about. I think I got most of them but just couldn’t get to all of them.\n\nTo be on this list the burgers had to be on the menu or at least mostly available. Specialty “off-menu” items or things that were made just to “wow” me are much appreciated but I couldn’t count that here. The biggest of these was Chef Travis’ first entry at Willows. Had I accepted that burger, it would have probably been top 3, but it was made for me, special, and not available all the time. Chef Swing at Sir Winston had a “special” burger that couldn’t be counted, as well, but it was darn good. In all, I had 34 burgers from 30 restaurants.\n\nI kept a “journal” of the burgers that I had. It was a spreadsheet that I kept track of the name of the establishment, the name of the burger (if applicable), the amount of seasoning, the “doneness,” the juiciness of the burger, the type of bun and my thoughts on the burger itself.\n\nI thought about breaking it down into “diner burgers” and “gourmet burgers.” Some have said it would be unfair to put a diner burger against a gourmet burger. I don’t see that as the case. I think it’s more unfair to impose some kind of “affirmative action” on burgers. Categorization is more of a problem than letting the burgers stand on their own, in my opinion. And that brings me to what I see as an important aspect of this list. This is my list. It’s not meant as a “readers’ choice” or a popularity contest. I respect the lists made in local publications but I feel it is just a popularity contest more than a true top list. I can’t compete with those lists and I don’t want to. I did take recommendations from others to get a broader knowledge of what is available to us. Burgers I either didn’t know or wouldn’t expect showed up and I am a better burger eater because of it. There were a lot of fantastic burgers on this list and some of your favorites will not make the top list. That doesn’t mean that those burgers that do not show up on the top list aren’t worth having. That’s not what this is about.\n\nAnd it comes down to this, the list is about how I felt while eating these burgers. I love burgers and this list is representative of much joy.\n\nSo, to quote Marty DiBergi, “But hey, enough of my yakkin’; whaddya say? Let’s boogie!”\n\n10. Small Batch\n\nMy pal, Jeff Davids sponsored this burger, which was us having a good lunch together in a place where burgers were prominent. I chose the “Morning After” burger. Yes, it’s a gourmet burger and was what I was in the mood for that day. This burger was a big patty with a fried egg, bacon, fries, pepper jack cheese and grilled onions on what I believe is a brioche bun. In addition to “Done” for doneness and “Very Good” for flavor/seasoning, my notes state: “Some of the juiciness comes from the egg, but still a very flavorful burger. Once you bite into it, you aren’t putting it down until it’s done because of that egg and the mess, but also because it’s a darned good burger.”\n\n9. Maxburger\n\nThis was a late entry and I didn’t know much about it because it is kind of down in the boondocks (Old Salisbury/Hickory Tree Rd area). This was also my first “Juicy Lucy” even though I had heard that term a good bit. I had it with both Pepper Jack and American cheese, onion, tomato and while I usually leave off the lettuce on burgers, I forgot to order it that way, and really on a “diner burger,” that’s not a problem. I think it adds to the flavor. This was on a brioche bun. It was a fantastic diner burger at that. Under the doneness and flavor/seasoning categories, both were listed as “perfect.” And, as the name states, it was juicy. Notes: “A really great burger which I had no expectations of. A surprise. The cheeses and fixings made this a delicious entry.”\n\n8. West End Cafe\n\nFull disclosure, when I had the first burger from WEC just before the start of the burger tour, I was set to let that be the first one but it was a little disappointing. I talked with John, the GM of WEC and he said they had been having a bit of trouble with their grill. I told him that I was going to give him a “mulligan.” This was the only mulligan on this tour and only because I had it before the “tour” started. Now, also in full disclosure, I gave John a heads up that I was coming and he gave me recommendations, as I welcomed from all establishments (after all it is their entry). I paid for the burger and it wasn’t comped. Now, this was certainly a different burger. This was, for all intents and purposes, a burger and a half. This burger was a Hamburger Grinder with habanero jack/provolone cheeses, spinach, 1000 island and pickles. I forgot to add onions, but they weren’t needed. The cheesy/1000 island combo is one thing that made this burger a winner. It was a bit messy but delicious. “Perfect” for the doneness, and “very good” for the seasoning, the majority of the flavor came from the accouterments. Per John, “the most underrated sandwich on the menu.” Per me: “Basically 1.5 burgers, great flavors and great unique sandwich.”\n\n7. Cin-Cin Burger Bar\n\nAnother full disclosure moment: Cin Cin is owned by the Michael family who also owns Yamas! who did sponsor me in gas. Again, that has nothing to do with this burger’s merit which is what this is about. I had the “Speakeasy Deluxe” burger which is their “classic” burger. This is a gourmet burger that tastes like a diner burger. There is a great underlying onion flavor that I enjoy in diner burgers, this I counted in the “flavor/seasoning.” It was a very juicy burger, too. I do kind of wish that restaurants would get away from the brioche bun as the end-all-be-all of gourmet burgers, though. My notes: “A gourmet burger that tasted like a diner burger, onions-on-the-grill quality. A very good burger.”\n\n6. Canteen Market & Bistro\n\nI will be honest and say that I had little expectations for this burger. I can’t explain why, either. This is a “Smashburger” with American cheese, grilled onions, tomato and 1000 Island on a bun. The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The grilled onions made it more like a diner burger and I love that. The burger wasn’t a thing of aesthetic beauty but it was delicious. “Perfect” in both doneness and seasoning. My notes: “A fantastic burger. Pricey but the flavors were top notch with the grilled onions.” My only knock on Canteen isn’t a knock because I try to stay clear of opining on the prices of restaurants’ wares. That’s their business but my business what I pay. It was more than I’d expect to pay for a burger usually, but the flavors made it worth it.\n\nSO! That’s 10-6. Now, for the Top 5 Burgers of Winston-Salem (ish).\n\n5. Food Freaks of NC Food Truck\n\nBrandon Cassidy sponsored this burger, but again, there was no bearing on the outcome for that. This was the only “actual” food truck that I got to, although there were a few that were on my “to do” list. This was also the first “official” burger of the tour on May 29. As I said in the Instagram post, “This is perhaps the messiest thing I’ve ever eaten but goodness! This is phenomenal.” It is the Wild Mexi burger which is andouille sausage stuffed into a double burger with jalapeno peppers, Muenster cheese and topped with a Sriracha chili mayo on Martin’s potato bun. This burger is huge and if you put it down, it would be all over everything. So, I recommend keeping a roll of paper towels near and don’t put it down until you’ve downed it. The flavors in this burger burst in your mouth and it’s juicy as all get out. Perfect in doneness. My notes (being my first entry): “What a burger should be.”\n\n4. Zito Pizzeria and Grill\n\nThe biggest “didn’t see that coming” moment on this tour was when I ate the burger at Zito. It came as a recommendation and I was like, okay, let’s give it a shot. I had only eaten at Zito once and that was right after they re-opened. That was a pizza-kind of day. I sat down and looked over the menu. I decided I wanted a double burger and got it with cheese, onion, mayo and tomato. The flavors in this burger were amazing. It was juicy, seasoned perfectly and worthy of the #4 spot on my list. Doneness and flavor/seasoning was “perfect.” My notes: “Was pleasantly surprised at how good this burger was. Better once it cooled off a bit. Lots of flavor with no fluff.”\n\n3. Social. Southern Kitchen & Cocktails\n\nA beautiful chunk of filet, NY strip, ribeye and ground beef ground together into a delicious patty of perfection. “All that wonderful beef with mayo, American cheese, housemade pickled onions and housemade pickle chips on a brioche bun. Woot… and BAM!” I said on Instagram. The pickled onions were amazing. The pickle chips were also unlike I’ve had anywhere else. This could have easily been #1 on the list. “Perfect” in flavor and doneness. My notes: “A darn fine burger. Great seasoning and temperature. Made with filet, strip, ribeye and ground beef.” It is in a location far from where I usually go, but it was worth that “drive.”\n\n2. Zesto Burgers & Ice Cream\n\nOf course, this had to be on the top 10 list, right? You were probably looking for it earlier, huh? Well, there is undoubtedly no burger that gets as much public love from me than that of the “Chubby Decker” from Zesto. There is something about having this double burger with its 8-minute char, the mayo, ketchup, onion, tomato and melty American cheese that puts me in a great mood. It makes me happy. I love eating at Zesto, too. Algenon and his staff make it a great place to eat a delicious, always flavorful and juicy burger. Zesto is much more than its burgers but for this, the burger reigns supreme. At least at the #2 spot.\n\nAnd, then there’s #1…\n\n1. Boone Doggies\n\nIf you notice throughout my writing of this post, I have mentioned Winston-Salem (ish) a time or two. Boone Doggies is not in Winston-Salem. Luckily for us all, it’s also not in Boone. It located in Yadkinville. Named for the fact that Drew Ausley, who started the Boone Doggies food truck graduated from Appalachian State University in, you guessed it, Boone. The truck focused on hot dogs, mainly. But, the time came to do something different and he opened a restaurant. The location is a true “greasy spoon”-type building and the dining room can get quite crowded. All that being said, you are completely remiss if you don’t make the drive there to have the burgers from this heavenly place. So, about the burger. Steven McDowall alerted me to this restaurant and took me there, and sponsored the tasting. It was an overall win-win for me. I was honored to taste not one. Not two. But three different burgers from Drew and company. I will say that these burgers were probably the best burgers I’ve ever tasted. Ever. First, we had the “Grandfather” which is their classic burger, named after Grandfather Mountain (a Boone reference). It’s a double burger with chopped onion, tomatoes, mayo and American cheese. Next was “The Rock” (another Boone reference): mayo, grilled onions they char in their homemade bbq sauce, bacon, and cheddar cheese. They even char the patty in the bbq sauce for a little something extra! Was it ever. The third is “The Peacock,” named after a chancellor at ASU that Drew had. It’s made with Papa Ausley’s homemade pimento, perfect bacon, tomato and mayo! Seared (and smashed) on the flattop and placed on a buttered toasted bun. I couldn’t pick a favorite of the three but why should I? I got to have all three at the same time. Thank you, Drew and thank you, Steven!\n\nSo, here you have it. MY Top 10 Burgers of WSNC (ish). I want to thank all the restaurants for their contributions to the tour and even if they didn’t make the top 10, they all are worth a try. You can’t know how incredibly hard it was to leave anything off this top list. Except for about three places, any of these could have made this list. Thank you to Mac & Nelli’s, Willows Bistro, Campus Gas, Sir Winston, North Point Grill, PB’s Takeout, King’s Crab Shack, Crafted, Earl’s, Allen’s Dairy Treats, Quiet Pint, Trade Street Diner, Mooney’s, Bad Daddy’s, Thunder Road Grill, Krankies, Mozelle’s, the Katharine and New Yorker Pizza Pasta and Wings for your burgers. My apologies to Burger Supreme, Jeffrey Adams, Athena Taverna, Hot Dog City and Sweet Potatoes for not getting to you.\n\nIt was a long-yet-short summer. It was a great burger summer. It was great eating great burgers with great friends. Let’s just say it was all great. I know some of yours didn’t make the list. I know some of you don’t agree with this list. But, that’s okay. Convince me otherwise. Tell me about your top list. Tell me the ones you like I left off. Tell me why you don’t agree with the list. I love the conversation and I love the interaction.\n\nNow, I’m off to finding the next “tour” to take. What’re your recommendations on that?\n\nAs always, thank you for reading and thank you for listening!\n\nBon appetit!"
