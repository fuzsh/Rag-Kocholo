In all the Southland there is, perhaps,--\n\nnor more interesting house than is to be seen in the quaint, aristocratic, flowery little tbwii of Washington, in Wilkes County, Ga. .It is known far and wide as Heard House, taking its name from Stephen Heard, the first settler of Wash ington, later a governor of Georgia, who reached there after a long journey from Virginia on New Years Day, 1774. He camped his family on the spot where Heard House now stands, where after ward he built a fort of defense against the Indians. The first dwelling erected on t\"he ground, however, was a large wooden structure, .known as the Tavern of Capt. John - Wllliamson, whose -girls were fa mous -Ge.orgia beau-ties; courted by Tialf the young squires in the State. .;\n\nIn 1865, just prior to the capture of Jef-y ferson Dav-is, what is known as the lass cabinet meeting of the Confederacy oc curred in Heard House. The .room in which the discouraged cabinet ministers sat is at the rear of the second story, and has never since been used. For many months what little. money the Confeder acy had was kept in . the old bank vault on the lower floor. The vault is there to-day, and is doing duty as a milk and butter closet.

AViTH the exception of the unhealthy summer months, I spent the greater part of the year following the close of the Eebellion, in traveling through the Jate Rebel States, passing first around their entire coast line; and, on subsequent trips, crossing by various routes through the interior.\n\nI have sought, in the following pages, to show something of the condition in which the war left the South, the feelings of the late insurgents, the situation and capacities of the liberated slaves, and the openings offered, under the changed condition of affairs, to capital and industry from without.\n\nA couple of months, this spring, spent on the great cotton plant ations of the Mississippi Valley, enabled me to make a closer study of the character of the average plantation negro than tourists have ordinarily found practicable; and the concluding chapters are mainly devoted to these observations.\n\nA further word of explanation may be needed as to the part of the volume describing the journey of Mr. Chief-Justice Chase After the inauguration of President Johnson, Mr. Chase deter mined to visit the Southern cities, to learn as much as possible, from actual observation, of the true condition of the country. The Secretary of the Treasury was then-about to send a revenue cut ter to the New Orleans station, and onboard of her a special agent, charged with the duty of examining the agencies, and carry-\n\nIV\n\nPREFACE.\n\ning into effect the directions of the Department in the several South Atlantic and Gulf ports. He tendered the use of this vesgel to the Chief-Justice, and orders were issued by the President and the Secretaries of War and of the Navy, to the officers in. the naval, military, and civil services to afford him all facilities that their respective duties would allow.\n\nIt was under these circumstances that the Chief-Justice made his Southern journey. He had the best opportunities of information, and communicated his views, from time to time, to the President. As a member of the party on board the cutter, I thus enjoyed con siderable, though, in some respects, more limited opportunities of observation.\n\nA small portion of the material in the following pages has pre\n\nviously appeared in the journal with which I was connected, but\n\nit has all been rewritten.\n\nLIBRARY OF THE HOUSE,\n\n\"j\n\nW. B.\n\nWashington, May, 1866. j\n\nAFTEE THE WAE.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nWhy, and How the Trip was Made.\n\nTHE most interesting records of the great revolution just ending have seemed to me to be those portraying the spirit and bearing of the people throughout the South, just before and at the outbreak of the war. Sto ries of battles, and sieges, and retreats, are kaleidoscopic repetitions of deeds with which all history is crowded ; but with what temper great communities plunged into this war, which has overwhelmed them, for what fan cied causes, to what end, in what boundless self-confi dence and overwhelming contempt of their antagonists, with what exuberance of frenzied joy at the prospect of bloodshed, with what wild dreams of conquest, and assurance of ill-defined but very grand honors, and or ders, and social dignities all this, as faithfully set down by the few who had opportunities to observe it, constitutes the strangest and most absorbing contribu tion to the literature of the Rebellion. ( So I have thought that what men now most want to know, is something of the temper arid condition in which these same communities Jiojne out from the struggle^/\n\n10\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nBy the side of the daguerreotypes of the South entering upon the war, even the hastiest pencil sketch of the South emerging from the war may possess an interest and attraction of its own.\n\nTherefore, when early in the month of April I was invited to accompany a small party, bound on a voyage of official inspection and observation, from Portress Monroe around the whole Atlantic and Gulf Coast to New Orleans, and thence up the Mississippi, I congratu lated myself upon the opportunity thus afforded of see ing, under the most favorable circumstances, the South ern centers which had nursed and fed the rebellion. Means of communication through the interior of the South are so thorovighly destroyed, and Southern society is so completely disorganized, that it is only in the cities one can hope for any satisfactory view of the people. Even there the overshadowing military authority, and the absence of all accustomed or recognized modes of expressing public sentiment, as through the press, the bar, public meetings, the pulpit, or unrestrained social intercourse, combine to render the task of observation infinitely more difficult than at any previous period.\n\nBut all the more^ on these accounts, the Southern cities are the places to which we must first look for any satisfactory idea of the Southern condition; and a trip which embraces visits to Norfolk, Newbern, Beaufort, Wilmington, Charleston, Port Eoyal, Savannah, Pernandina, St. Augustine, Jacksonville, Key \"West, Mo bile, New Orleans, Baton Eouge, Natchez, Yicksburg, and Memphis, with visits to plantations all along the route, and occasional trips into the interior, ought not to fail in furnishing a good view of the gradual beginnings to crystallize again out of the chaos to which the war had reduced one-third of the nation.\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n11\n\nThe trip would have been begun some weeks earlier,\n\nbut for the deed of horror in Fords Theater. But, as\n\nSecretary McCulloch well said, the wheels of Govern\n\nment moved on without a perceptible jar; and the ar\n\nrangements of President Lincoln were only temporarily\n\ndelayed by the accession of President Johnson. An\n\nocean-going revenue cutter was ordered around from\n\nNew York to Fortress Monroe for the party, and early\n\non-the morning of the first of May, the cutter \"North\n\nerner\" was announced as in readiness to convey us to\n\nthe Fortress.\n\nIn the afternoon an officer was good enough to bring\n\nme the following:\n\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 1, 1865.\n\nPermission is granted Whitelaw Reid, Esq., to proceed by sea to New Orleans, Louisana, and return by sea or inland to Washing\n\nton, District of Columbia, and to visit any port or place en route in\n\nthe lines of national military occupation.\n\n[Signed,]\n\nANDREW JOHNSON, President of the United States.\n\nI had not supposed a pass necessary; but as the rest\n\nof the party went on official business-, it had been thought\n\nbest to cover my case with a document, about the scope\n\nand authority of which no question could be raised.\n\nAt that time passes to visit many of the Southern points\n\nwere still eagerly sought and procured with difficulty.\n\nThe War Department was the place to which, in gen\n\neral, application was to be made, and the speculative\n\ngentry who mostly wanted such favors, stood in whole\n\nsome awe of the downright Secretary. A pass so nearly\n\nunlimited as mine was an unheard of rarity, and before\n\nthe afternoon was over, two or three who had in some\n\nway found out that I had it, were anxious to know if\n\n\" five hundred or even a thousand dollars would be any\n\ninducement\" to me to part with it!\n\n12\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nBy nine in the evening the last of the little party had entered the cozy cabin of the \" Northerner.\" There were the usual good-byes to the friends who had driven down to the Navy Yard wharf to see us off; playful injunc tions from young officers about laying in supplies of cigars at Havana, and from fair ladies about bringing back for them parrots and monkeys, pine apples and bananas; some consultations among the officials of the party; some final messages and instructions sent down at the last moment by the Government: then fresh good-byes; the plank was pulled in, and we steamed out into the darkness.\n\nEverybody compared supplies with everybody else ; it was found that there were books enough in the party to set up a circulating library, and paper enough for writing a three-volume novel; the latest dates of news papers had been laid in; the last issues of the maga zines, and even a fresh number of the old North Ameri can were forthcoming; while Napoleons Gcesar, in all the glory of tinted paper and superb letter-press, formed the piece de resistance that bade fair to master us all as Horace G-reeley used maliciously to say the old National Intelligencer mastered him, when he couldnt get asleep in any other way!\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n13\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nA School of Unadulterated Negroes An Ancient Virginia Town under the Dispensation of Sutlers.\n\nOUR steamer for the voyage was to be the revenue cutter \" Wayanda,\" a trim, beautifully-modeled, ocean going propeller, carrying six guns, and manned with a capital crew. While Captain Merryman was making his final preparation for a cruise, much longer than he had expected when the telegraph hurried his vessel around from New York, we retained the little \" North erner\" for a trip up to Norfolk only delaying long enough at the Portress to drive out and see a great negro school, established by General Butler.\n\nThe wharves were crowded by the usual curious throng of idle spectators, laborers taking care of sup plies, soldiers on duty, and a very sparse sprinkling of ladies. Rebel soldiers by scores were mixed in the groups, or could be seen trudging along the sidewalks toward the Commissarys.\n\nEverywhere were negroes on the sidewalks driv ing the wagons in the huts that lined the road. All the slaves of the adjoining counties seem to have estab lished themselves at the Fortress. As we crossed the long, narrow isthmus, contracting at last to an atten uated causeway, which separates the fortress from the main land, and came out into the ancient village of Hampton, the negro huts thickened into swarms, and fairly covered the sites of the old aristocratic\n\n14\n\nAFTER THE WAK:\n\nresidences which the Eebels fired early in the war when compelled to evacuate the place. Bricks, two centuries old, imported by the early colonists from Great Britain, for the mansions of the first families, were built up into little outside chimneys for these cabins of the Freedmen; and here and there one noticed an antique Elizabethan chair, of like age and origin, converted to the uses of a portly negress.\n\nTo our right, down on the waters edge, rose a high, narrow residence the former home of John Tyler; near it was another, somewhat less pretentious, as well as less uncouth, which had formerly been occupied by S. R. Mallory. Both find loyal and benevolent uses now at the hands of the Government. 3STear them was a long colonnade, with spacious piazzas, fronting a many-windowed brick hospital, which one of our party was observed closely scrutinizing. \" Upon my word,\" he exclaimed, after a moments reflection, \"that is the old Chesapeake Female College, of which I have been, from the foundation, one of the Trustees.\" Pale-faced men in blue occupied the chambers of the boardingschool misses; and sentries, pacing to and fro, kept a stricter guard than strictest duenna of boarding-school ever achieved.\n\nTo our left extended a stretch of marshy meadows and half-cultivated fields. In their midst was one little field cultivated above all the rest. White boards, with a trifle of modest lettering on each, dotted its sur face, and the grass grew greenest over long, carefullysmoothed hillocks. A file of slow-paced soldiers, with arms reversed, was entering the inclosure; behind them followed an army wagon, with five rude pine boxes piled upon it; beyond, quietly, and, as one loved to think, even sadly, regarding the scene, was a group of paroled\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUB.\n\n15\n\nRebel soldiers; while, as we turned, in passing, to catch a last glimpse of the mourners in blue by the open graves, there was seen away behind us, rippling in the breeze above the fort, the old flag for which these dead had died, and against which these Eebels had fought.\n\nWe found the school-house (a barn-like frame struc ture), a little removed from the cluster of negro huts, and took the school fairly by surprise. Passing up a long hall, wide enough for double rows of desks, in the center, with seats for about ten or twelve boys in each, and an aisle on either side, with benches for the class recitations against the walls, we came to an elevated platform, from which led oif, in opposite directions, two other precisely similar halls. The fourth, completing the cross, was designed for girls, and was yet unfinished. Down these three long halls were ranged row after row of cleanly-clad negro boys, from the ages of six and seven up to sixteen or seventeen.\n\nAll seemed attentive; and though the teachers com plained that the sudden entrance of visitors always led to more confusion than usual, there was certainly no more than one would expect from any school of equal extent anywhere, or under any management. The rolls contained the names of three hundred and seventy-four pupils, of whom about two hundred were present. The Superintendent, who seemed an earnest, simple-minded man, enthusiastically convinced that he had a \"mis sion \" here, spoke of this as about the average attend ance. The parents, he said, were themselves so uncer tain, and so little accustomed, as yet, to habits of regu larity, that they could not well bring up this average to a better point. It seemed to me surely not so far behind\n\n16\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nour ordinary public schools at the North as to suggest any unfavorable contrasts.\n\nThese children had all been slaves, and nearly all had accompanied their parents on their escape from the plantations of the Peninsula, and of the upper counties of North Carolina, to the Portress. The parents had generally been field hands, and one noticed among the children very few faces not of pure African descent. Such masses of little woolly heads, such rows of shining ivories, and flat noses and blubber lips, I had never seen collected before, unless in a state of filth utterly unbear able. The teachers were all convalescent soldiers from the hospitals, moving noiselessly about among the benches in their hospital slippers and cheap calico wrappers as they themselves had often seen moving about among their hospital cots the angels of mercy from the North. Who shall say they were not doing as beneficent a work, or that the little negroes might not well follow them with as longing and affectionate a gaze?\n\nSeveral classes were called up to exhibit their profi ciency. Doubtless the teachers selected their best schol ars for the test I think even Northern schools some times do that but there can be little opportunity for deception in the reading of an unlearned lesson in a book, or in answers to questions in mental arithmetic, propounded by the visitors themselves. It was strange to see boys of fourteen or fifteen reading in the First Eeader; but stranger to observe how intelligently schol ars in the Pirst Eeader went about their work, and with what comparative rapidity they learned. I passed among the forms and conversed with a good many of the soldier-teachers. They all united in saying that on an average the raw negro boys admitted to the school would learn their letters and be able to read well in the\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n17\n\nFirst Reader in three months; while some of them, who were originally bright, and who were kept in regular attendance, made considerably more rapid progress.\n\nAn advanced class, composed of the little negro \" monitors\" who had been longest in the school, was summoned to the platform to read a lesson in the fourth Eeader. One or two of them read very badly; one or two quite well, and with an evident understanding of what was said. The best reader in the class was the smallest boy, an ebony-faced urchin, whose head looked as a six-pound round shot, coated with curled hair from a mattress, might. The Superintendent exhibited his manner of calling out the classes through the whole school to recite, the military style in which the boys were required to march to their places at the word of command, and the general adherence to military forms, even in such minutias as distributing slates, removing the stools for the monitors, returning books to their places, and the like.\n\nThen came a little address from the Dominie of our party, a former South Carolina lawyer and heavy slave holder ; and we finally took our leave, the little urchins eagerly handing up their slates, as we passed, to have us see their penmanship; and laboriously tracing out, in school-boy characters, their oddly-sounding names, to show us how readily they could write.\n\nThis school is kept up at little or no expense to the Government, save the original cost of erecting the rough board structure in which it is held. The parents of the children have been, to a considerable extent, em ployed by the Government as laborers in the Quarter masters Department and, meantime, the convalescents from the hospitals have prepared the sons, in some meas ure, for the new order of things. Still there is more\n\n2\n\n18\n\nAFTEK THE WAR!\n\ndependence on charity than could be desired, especially among the parents. 3STegroes need to be taught just as slaves of any race or color would need to be taught that liberty means, not idleness, but merely work for themselves instead of work for others; and that, in any event, it means always work. To teach them this, do not gather them in colonies at military posts, and feed them on Government rations; but throw them in the water and have them learn to swim by finding the ne cessity of swimming. For the present, these collections of negroes are an inevitable result of the war; and that would be a barbarous Government indeed which would not help in time of distress the men whose friend ship to it has brought them into distress; but it must be the first care of the authorities to diminish the charity, and leave the negroes, just as it would leave the white men to take care of themselves.\n\nOn arriving at Norfolk, we were met, at the shabbylooking old wharf, by General Gordon, commanding the post. Carriages were in waiting, and we were rapidly whirled past the tumble-down warehouses, through streets of stores from which every former proprietor had gone, by the old English brick church, whence the former pastor had departed, past elegant residences of prominent rebels, in whose parlors sat the wives of Yankee officers, and through whose superb gardens we were invited to wander, and pluck at will great bending bunches of flowers that, at Washington, were still scarce in the hot-houses.\n\nFrom the gardens we turned toward the country to see the old line of fortifications (planned, curiously enoiigh, by a nephew of one of our party), by which the Virginians, in the first months of the war, had been con-\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n19\n\nfident they could hold Norfolk forever against the Yan kee scum. Negro soldiers manned the lines the rebel engineer had traced; but wild flowers covered the em bankments, and we plucked azalias of exquisite fragrance from the crumbling embrasures. It was not less strange that another member of our party, then foremost in the Cabinet, had undertaken the search hereabouts for a landing for our troops, after the officers had given it up; and had actually chosen the point where they were safely debarked, and whence they had turned these long lines, and reduced Norfolk \"Merrimac\" and all without a blow.\n\nThe wild flowers filled the moist evening air with their perfume as we drove back through the negro quar ter. Every hut exhibited the tender tokens of mourn ing for the good, dead President, which were missing on many aristocratic residences. There were no evidences of suffering or destitution among these people; and it was not from their windows that the lowering glances were turned upon the General, and the well-known fea tures of the anti-slavery leader by his side. _\n\nNorfolk ought to do, and will do a fine business whenever it has any country to do business for. It must always be the great shipping point for the Virginia and North Carolina coast; the heaviest vessels can lie by its wharves, and between it and Hampton Eoads is room for the navies of the woz-ld. .But, thus far, there is scarcely any business, save what the army has brought, and what the impoverished inhabitants, who remain are themselves able to support. Sutlers have sat in the high places until they have amassed fortunes ; but the merchants whose deserted store rooms they are occupying are paroled and ruined Eebel officers. No trade comes or can come from the interior. The people\n\n20\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nhave no produce to spare, and no money with which to buy. And the very number of able-bodied men in the country has been sadly reduced.*\n\nEverything is controlled by the military authority: and while there may be a genuine Union sentiment that warranted the attempted elections of Congressmen, one may still be permitted a quiet suspicion of the inde pendent and disinterested patriotism of the voters. Just as we were pushing off, Mr. Chandler, a nervous, restless, black-haired Virginian, came hobbling out from his carriage. He was a claimant for a seat in the last House, which was refused; and was the leader of the Virginia delegation to the Baltimore Convention, whose admission to that body his fluent and impassioned rhetoric secured. Naturally he is a warm supporter of the Pierpoint State Government, believes that \"the loyal men of the State constitute the State,\" and doesnt see why the fact that they are few in numbers should pre vent their exercising all the powers of the State. Just now he and the few really loyal men, like him, are very bitter against the Rebels, whom they wish to have excluded from any participation in the ready-made State Government, which they hope soon to have trans ferred from Alexandria to Richmond, and extended over the State. But they frankly admit themselves to be in a very small minority; and it remains to be seen how long a minority, however loyal, can govern, in a repub\n\nlican country.\n\n^Calculations, seemingly accurate, have placed the number of dead and disabled Virginia soldiers at 105,000, or nearly one-tenth of the entire free population of the State.\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUK.\n\n21\n\nCHAPTER III;\n\n\" Beauties of the Sea \" First Views of Cracker Unionism.\n\nON our return to the Fortress, the \" Wayanda \" was ready; there was a hurried transhipment in the dark; not a little dismay at the straitened proportions of the cabin; an assignment of state-rooms, which gave me the D. D. of the party as chum; and so amid the Doctors loud groans and lamentations over confining a rational human being in a straight jacket of a bed like that to sleep.\n\nThere was a very hasty toilette next morning, and a very undignified rush for the fresh air on deck. We had started in the night, were well out on the ocean, a pretty heavy sea was running, and the mettlesome little \" Wayanda\" was giving us a taste of her qualities. Nothing could exceed the beauty of her plunges fore and aft, and lurches from port to starboard; but the party were sadly lacking in enthusiasm. Presently breakfast was announced, and we all went below very bravely and ranged ourselves about the table. Before the nieal was half over, the Captain and the Doctors were left in solitary state to finish it alone. For myself although seasoned, as I had vainly imagined, by some experiences in tolerably heavy storms I freely confess to the double enjoyment of the single cup of tea I managed to swallow. \" For,\" said the Dominie, argumentatively, \"you have the pleasure of enjoying it first as it goes down, and then a second time as it comes up.\"\n\n22\n\nAFTER THE\n\nTo keep one another in countenance as we held our uncertain positions on the rolling and plunging deck, we combined to rehearse all the old jokes about sea sickness. One gave a definition of it, which, like many another indifferent thing, has been unwarrantably fathered on the late President. \"Sea sickness is a dis order which for the first hour makes you afraid youll die, but by the second hour makes you afraid you wont!\" . Another recited Artemus Wards groaning lamentation over Point Judith, to the effect that he \" never before saw a place where it was so hard to keep inside ones clothes and outside ones breakfast!\" \"Sure, it isnt say sick yez are,\" pleasantly suggested an Irish engineer, among the officers, who looked provokingly happy amid all the pitching \"it isnt say sick yez are; but yez mighty sick of the say!\" \" 0 si sic omnes!\" punned the Chief Justice. How the rest stood it I dont know; Tout that was the last straw, and drove one unfortunate of the party to his state-room,\n\nand a basin and towel. Toward evening the sea calmed down, and one after\n\nanother emerged on deck. The air was delightfully bracing; the moon sent its broad streams of light, shaking across the waters; the revolving light of Hatteras shone out guide and safeguard to a hundred eyes besides our own and so with calmest weather, and a delicious beauty of scene that no words need be vainly employed in efforts to describe, we spent half the night in watching the passage of the ship by the most dan gerous part of the Atlantic coast. JSText morning, at breakfast, we were steaming under the guns of Port Macon into the harbor where Butler and Porter ren\n\ndezvoused for Fort Fisher. As a boats crew slowly pulled some of our party\n\nA SOUTHEBN TOUB.\n\n23\n\nthrough the tortuous channel by which even the light est gigs have to approach the single landing of Beaufort, the guns of the naval force began to thunder out a\n\nsalute for the Chief Justice. \" How many guns does a Chief Justice receive?\" inquired one, as he counted the successive discharges. \"Youd a great deal better ask,\" reprovingly hinted the Doctor, \"how many guns a Baptist minister receives ! \" Well, how many, Doctor !\" Oh, just count these up, and then youll know!\" With which church-militant suggestion, we rounded to at a crazy old wharf, climbed up a pair of rickety steps that gave the Doctor premonitions of more immersion than even he had bargained for, and stood in the town of Beaufort, North Carolina. In front of us was the Cus tom House a square, one-story frame building, perched upon six or eight posts occupied now by a Deputy Treasury Agent. A narrow strip of sand, plowed up by a few cart wheels, and flanked by shabby-looking old frame houses, extended along the water front, and constituted the main business street of a place that, however dilapidated and insignificant, must live in the history of the struggle just ended. Near the waters edge was a small turpentine distillery, the only manu facturing establishment of the place.\n\nThe landing of a boats crew, with an officer in charge and a flag fluttering at the stern, seemed to be an event in Beaufort, and we were soon surrounded by the nota bilities. A large, heavily and coarsely-built man, of un mistakable North Carolina origin, with the inevitable bilious look, ragged clothes and dirty shirt, was intro duced, with no little eclat, as \"the Senator from this District.\" \" Of what Senate ?\" some one inquired. \" The North Caroliner Senate, Sir,\" \" Umph, Eebel Senate of\n\n24\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nWorth. Carolina,\" growled the Captain, sotto voce; \"you make a devil of a fuss about your dignity! North Caro lina Eebel Senate be hanged! A New York constable outranks you.\" But the Senator didnt hear; and his manner showed plainly enough that no doubts of his importance ever disturbed the serene workings of his own mind. The Clerk of the Court, the Postmaster, the doctor, the preacher and other functionaries were speed ily added to the group that gathered in the sand bank called a pavement.\n\n\"How are your people feeling?\" some one asked. \"Oh, well, sir; we all went out unwillingly, you know,\" responded the legislator, fresh from the meetings of the Eebel Senate at Ealeigh, \"and most of us are very glad to getback.\" \"Have you no violent Eebels yet?\" \"Yes,quite a good many, among the young bloods; but even they all feel as if they had been badly whipped, and want to give in.\" \"Then they really feel themselves whipped?\" \"Yes, you Ve subjugated us at last,\" with a smile which showed that the politician thought it not the worst kind of a joke after all.\n\n\"And,1 of course, then you have only to submit to any terms the conquerors mayimpose?\" \"No, sir oh, ah yes, any terms that could be honorably offered to a proud, high-minded people!\" The rest of the dignita ries nodded their heads approvingly at this becoming intimation of the terms the \"subjugated\" State could be induced to accept. It was easy to see that the old politi cal tricks were not forgotten, and that the first inch of wrong concession would be expected to lead the way to many an ell.\n\n\"What terms do you think would be right?\" The County Clerk, a functionary of near thirty years service, took up the conversation, and promptly replied, \"Let\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n25\n\nGovernor Vance call together the North Caroliiier Leg-\n\nislater. We only lacked a few votes of a Union ma\n\njority in it before, and we d be sure to have enough\n\nnow.\" \"\"What then?\" \"Why, the Legislator would,\n\nof course, repeal the ordinance of secession, and order\n\na convention to amend the Constitution. I think that\n\nconvention would accept your constitutional amend\n\nment.\"\n\n,\n\n\" But can you trust your Governor Yance?- Did not\n\nhe betray the Union party after his last election ?\" -\n\n\"Yes, he sold us out clean and clear.\"\n\n\"He did nothing of the sort. North Caroliner has not\n\ngot a purer patriot than Governor Vance.\" And so they\n\nfoil to disputing among themselves.\n\n-\n\nI asked one of the party what this Legislature, if thus\n\ncalled together, would do with the negroes?\"\n\n\" Take em under the control of the Legislator, as free\n\nniggers always have been in this State. Let it have\n\nauthority to fix their wages, and prevent vagrancy. \" : It\n\nalways got along with em well enough before.\"\n\n\"Are you not mistaken about its always having had\n\nthis power?\"...\n\n-\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the astonished functionary.\n\n\"Why, I was born and raised hyar, and lived hyar all\n\nmy life ! Do you suppose I dont know?\"\n\n\" Apparently not, sir; for you seem to be ignorant of\n\nthe fact that free negroes in North Carolina were voters\n\n-from the formation of the State Government down to 1835.\"\n\n\"It isnt so, stranger.\"\n\n\"Excuse me; but your own State records will show\n\nit;* and, if I must say so, he is a very ignorant citizen\n\n* North Carolina, by her Constitution of 1776, prescribed three bases of suffrage:\n\n1. All FBEEMES twenty-one years old, who have lived in the 3\n\n26\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nto be talking about ways and means of re-organization, who doesnt know so simple and recent a fact in the history of his State.\"\n\nThe Cracker scratched his head in great bewilder ment. \" Well, stranger, you dont mean to say that the Government at Washington is going to make us let nig gers vote?\"\n\n\" I mean to say that it is at least possible.\" \"Well, why not have the decency to let us have a vote on it ourselves, and say whether we'll let niggers vote?\" \" In other words, you mean this: Less than a gen eration ago you held a convention, which robbed cer tain classes of your citizens of rights they had enjoyed, undisputed, from the organization of your State down to that hour. Now, you propose to let the robbers hold\n\ncounty twelve months, and have had a freehold of fifty acres for six months, may vote for a member of the Senate.\n\n2. All FKEEMES, of like age and residence, who have paid public taxes, may vote for members of the House of Commons for the county.\n\n3. The above two classes may, if residing or owning a freehold in a town, vote for members of the House of Commons for such town: provided-, they shall not already have voted for a mender for the county, and vice versa.\n\nBy the Constitution, as amended in 1835, all freemen, twenty-one years of age, living twelve months in the State, and owning a free hold of fifty acres for six months, should vote, except that\n\n\"No free negro, free mulatto, or free person of mixed blood, descended from negro ancestors to the fourth generation inclusive (though one ancestor of each generation may have been a white per son), shall vote for members of the Senate or House of Commons.\"\n\nThe last clause would seem to have looked to amalgamation as a pretty steady practice, for such zealous abolition and negro-haters. Under the Constitution of 1776, free negroes, having the requisite qualifications, voted as freely as any other portion of the voting population.\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUE.\n\n27\n\nan election to decide whether they will return the stolen property or not.\"\n\n\" Stranger,\" exclaimed another of the group, with great emphasis, \"is the Government at Washington, because it has whipped us, going to make us let niggers vote?\"\n\n\" Possibly it will. At any rate a strong party favors it.\" \"Then I wouldnt live under the Government. Id emigrate, sir. Yes, sir, Id leave this Government and go north!\" And the man, true to his States-Eights training, seemed to imagine that going north was going under another Government, and spoke of it as one might speak of emigrating to China. Meantime, the younger citizens of Beaufort (of Cau casian descent) had found better amusement than talk ing to the strangers in the sand bank of a street. One\n\nof them wagered a quarter (fractional currency) that he could whip another. The party thus challenged evinced\n\nhis faith in his own muscle by risking a correspond ing quarter on it. The set-to was at once arranged, in the back-yard of the house in front of which we were standing, and several side bets, ranging from five to as high as fifteen cents, were speedily put up by spectators.\n\nOne of our party, who joined the crowd at the amuse ment, reported that half-a-dozen rounds were fought a few \"niggers \"gravely looking on from the outskirts of the throng that several eyes were blacked, and both noses bruised; that there was a fall, and a little choking and eye-gouging, and a cry of \"give it up;\" that then the belligerents rose and shook hands, and stakes were deliv ered, and the victor was being challenged to another trial, with a fresh hand, as we left the scene of combat; and so closed our first visit to a North Carolina town.\n\n28\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nNewbern and Beaufort Black and White.\n\nSHORTLY, after our arrival in the harbor, the military authorities had provided a special train for us that is to say,-a train composed of a wheezy little locomotive and an old mail agents car, with all the windows smashed out and half the seats gone. By this means we were enabled, an hour after our visit to Beaufort, to be whirl ing over the military railroad from the little collection of Government warehouses on the opposite side of the harbor, called ; Morehead City, to Newbern.\n\nThe-whole way led through the exhausted turpentine forests of North-eastern North Carolina, which the tur pentine growers have for many years been abandoning for the more productive forests of upper South Carolina. Here and there were swamps which Yankee drainage would soon convert into splendid corn land; and it is possible that Yankee skill might make the exhausted pineries very profitable; but, for the present, this coun try is not likely to present such inducements as to attract a large Northern emigration.\n\nThe poorer people seem to be quietly living in their old places. Where .the paroled rebel soldiers have re turned, they have sought their former homes, and evince a very decided disposition to stay there. Throughout this region there is, as we learned, comparatively little destitution. The , ocean is a near and never-failing resource; and from Newborn and Beaufort (both of\n\nA SOUTHERN IOUB.\n\n29\n\nwhich have been in our possession during the greater part of the war) supplies have gone through the linea by a sort of insensible and invisible perspiration, which it would be unkind, to the disinterested traders who folr low in the wake of an army, to call smuggling.\n\nPassing, the traces of the works thrown up at the point, where Burnside had his fight, we entered the remarkable city of log cabins, outside the city limits, which now really forms the most interesting part of the ancient town of Ifewbern. Before the war, it had be tween five and six thousand inhabitants; now, these newly-built cabins on the outskirts, alone, contain over ten thousand souls.* Yet, withal, there are few old residents here. The city proper is, to a considerable extent, deserted by its former inhabitants, and filled by Union refugees from all parts of the State; while these squares of crowded cabins contain solely Union refugees of another color, but not less loyal.\n\nWithin a few days back, however, men, whose faces have not been seen in JSTewbern for nearly four years, are beginning to appear again, with many an anxious inquiry about property, which they think ought to have been carefully preserved for them during their hostile absence. Sometimes they have kept an aged mother, or an aunt, or a widowed sister, in the property, to retain a claim upon it; and in these cases they seem to find little difficulty in quietly resuming possession. But, in more instances, they are forced to see others in an occupancy they can not conveniently dispute, and\n\n* The census of 1860 gave the population of Newbern at, whites, 2,360; blacks, 3,072; aggregate, 5,432. The Newbern people are now setting forth, as a reason for inducing emigration, that the city is the largest in the State, and has a population of between twenty and thirty thousand. The increase is mainly made up of negroes.\n\n30\n\nAITEK THE WAR:\n\nto learn of fortunes made from the property they aban doned.\n\nThe hotel keeper, for example, has returned.. He finds here a Yankee, who, seeing the house, deserted when we occupied the city, and being told by the offi cers that they wanted a hotel, determined to keep it. The Yankee has paid no rent; he has been at no expense, and he has made a sum reckoned at over a hundred thousand dollars, by his hotel keeping and a little cotton planting which he was able to combine with it. Naturally, he is in no haste to give up his rentfree establishment, and the Eebel owner has the satis faction of contemplating the Yankee in possession, and calculating the profits which might have gone into his own pockets but for the frantic determination, four years ago, never to submit to the tyrannical rule of the Illi nois gorilla. Eeturning merchants find sutlers behind their counters, reckoning up gains such as the old busi ness men of Newbern never dreamed of; all branches of trade are in the hands of Northern speculators, who fol lowed the army; half the residences are filled with army officers, or occupied by Government civil officials, or used for negro schools, or rented out as \" abandoned property.\"\n\nYankee enterprise even made money out of what had been thrown away long before the war. In the distilla tion of turpentine a large residuum of the resin used to be carted away as rubbish, not worth the cost of its transportation to market. The mass thus thrown out from some of the Newbern distilleries, had gradually been buried under a covering of sand and dirt. A couple of Yankee adventurers, digging for something on the bank of the river, happened to strike down upon this resin, quietly had it mined and shipped to a North-\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n31\n\nern market. I am afraid to tell how many thousands of Collars they are said to have made by the lucky dis covery.\n\nThe negro quarter has been swelled to a size greater than that of almost any city on the coast, by accessions from all parts of the State. They came in entirely des titute. The Government furnished them rations, and gave the men axes, with which they cut down the pine trees and erected their own cabins, arranging them reg ularly in streets, and \" policing\" them as carefully as a regiment of veteran soldiers would do. Every effort was then made to give them work in the Quartermas ters Department, to keep them from being simply an ex pense to the Government; but the close of the war nec essarily cuts off this source of employment, and the General commanding is now looking with 110 little uneasiness to the disposition to be made of this great collection of negroes, for scarcely a tithe of whom can the natural wants of the town itself supply employment.\n\nSome have rented a large rice plantation in the vicin ity contrary to the currently-received theory that no human being, white or black, will work on rice grounds except when driven to it and they are doing exceed ingly well. Others could go further into the interior and do the same, if they were sure of protection; but till some understanding with the planters is reached, and the status of the Eebel planters themselves is defined, this is almost impracticable. Something, how ever, must be done to disperse this unwholesome gath ering at JSTewbern, or the tumor, thus neglected, may do serious injury.\n\nA dispatch from General Sherman (on his way north from Savannah, and forced by bad weather to put in at\n\n82\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nBeaufort) had reached K\"ewbern, while we were there, expressing a very earnest desire to see Chief Justice Chase; and on the return of the party, General Shermans vessel was lying at the wharf, opposite the railroad terminus, awaiting us.; .Nervous and restless as ever, the General looked changed (and improved) since the old campaigns in the South-west. He was boiling over with pride at the performances of his army through the winter, and all the more indignant, by conse quence, at the insults and injustice he imagined him self to have received, in consequence of his arrange ment with Johnston. \" I fancied the country wanted peace,\" he exclaimed. \"If they dont, let them raise more soldiers.\"\n\nThe General complained, and, doubtless, with some truth, if not justice, that the Government had never distinctly explained to him what policy it desired to have pursued. \" I asked Mr. Lincoln explicitly, when I went up to City Point, whether he wanted me to cap ture Jeff. Davis, or let him escape, and in reply he told me a story.\"\n\nThat \"story\" may now have a historical value, and I give it, therefore, as General Sherman said Mr. Lincoln told it only premising that it was a favorite story with Mr. Lincoln, which he told many times, and in illustra tion of many points of public policy.\n\n\"Ill tell you, General,\" Mr. Lincoln was said to have begun, \" Ill tell you what I think about taking Jeff. Davis. Out in Sangamon county there was an old tem perance lecturer, who was very strict in the doctrine and practice of total abstinence. One day, after a long ride in the hot sun, he stopped at the house of a friend, who proposed making him a lemonade. As the mild beverage was being mixed, the friend insinuatingly\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n33\n\nasked if lie wouldnt like just the least drop of sometiling stronger, to brace up his nerves after the exhaust ing heat and exercise. ]STo, replied the lecturer, I couldnt think of it; I am opposed to it on principle. But, he added, with a longing glance at the black bot tle that stood conveniently at hand, if you could man age to put in a drop unbeknownst to me, I guess it wouldnt hurt me much! Now, General.\" Mr. Lin coln concluded, \"Im bound to oppose the escape of Jeif. Davis; but if you could manage to let him slip out unbeknownst-like, I guess it wouldnt hurt me much!\" .\n\n\"And that,\" exclaimed General Sherman, \"is all I could get out of the Government as to what its policy was, concerning the Eebel leaders, till Stanton assailed me for Davis escape!\"\n\nA heavy gale blew on the coast all day Friday, Satur day and Sunday, and neither General Sherraans Cap tain nor our own thought it wise to venture out. Mean while, delegations of the Beaufort people came off in little sail-boats to visit the \" \"Wyanda,\" bring us flowers and strawberries, and talk politics. Since their last demonstrations, a few days ago/ they had toned down their ideas a good deal; and the amount of their talk, stripped of its circumlocution and hesitation, was sim ply this: that they were very anxious to re-organize, and would submit to anything the Government might require to that end_J They said less against negro suf frage than before frankly said it would be very obnox ious to the prejudices of nearly the whole population, but added, that if the Government insisted on it, they would co-operate with the negroes in re-organization, \"But the poor, shiftless creatures will never be able to.\n\n34\n\n\"\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nsupport themselves in freedom. Well have half of them in poor-houses before a year!\"* Nothing could overcome this rooted idea, that the negro was worth less, except under the lash.. These people really believe that, in submitting to the emancipation of the slaves, they have virtually saddled themselves with an equal number of idle paupers. Naturally, they believe that to add a requirement that these paupers must share\n\n* And yet an official report, since published in the newspapers, shows that out of three thousand whites in Beaufort last winter, between twelve and fourteen hundred were applicants for the charity of Government rations. Out of about an equal number of negroes, less than four hundred were dependent on the Govern ment! The secret of the disparity was, that the negroes took work when they could get it; the whites were \"ladies and gentlemen,\" and wouldnt work.\n\nA Eichmond letter, of June 30th, in the Boston Commonwealth, testifies to the same feeling among the Virginians. Describing the charities of the Sanitary Commission, it says :\n\n\"The most fastidious, though not too dainty to beg, were yet ludicrously exacting and impatient. They assumed, in many ways, the air of condescending patrons. Do you expect me to go into that dirty crowd? Havent you some private way by which I could enter? I can never carry that can of soup in the world ! they whined. The sick must suffer, unless a servant was at com mand to tote a little box of gelatine; and the family must wait till some alien hand could take home the flour. The aristocratic sometimes begged for work. Mr. Williams, of the Sanitary Com mission, when asked by a mother to furnish work for her daughters, said: If they will serve as nurses to the suffering men in your own army hospitals, I will secure pay for them. My daughters . go into a hospital! exclaimed the insulted mother. They are ladies, sir! Our Northern ladies would rather work than beg, quietly remarked Mr. Williams.- Another mother begged Mr. Chase, of the Union Commission, to give her daughters something to do. Anything by which they can earn something, for we have not a penny in the world. They shall help me measure flour, said Mr. Chase. My daughters are ladies, sir, replied the mother.\"\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n35\n\nthe management of public affairs with them is piling a very Pelion upon the Ossa of their misfortunes.\n\nMy room-mate, the Doctor, appointed me a \" dea con for special service\" even he had absorbed military ways of doing things from our neighbors and I arranged for his preaching in Beaufort, Sunday morning. The people were more than glad to welcome him, and he had a big congregation, with a sprinkling of black fringe around its edges, to appreciate his really eloquent dis course ; while the trees that nodded at the pulpit win dows shook out strains of music, which the best-trained choristers could never execute, from the swelling throats of a whole \"army of mocking-birds. An old Ironsideslooking man, who had occupied an elders seat beside the pulpit, rose at ttie close, and said he little expected to have ever seen a day like this. Everybody started forward, anticipating a remonstrance against the strong Unionism and anti-slavery of the Doctors sermon, but instead there came a sweeping and enthusiastic indorse ment of everything that had been said. He saw a better day at hand, the old man said, and rejoiced in the brightness of its coming. How many an old man, like him, may have been waiting through all these wearv years for the same glad day!\n\nAt other times there were fishing parties which caught no fish, though General Sherman sent them over enough fine ocean trout to enable them to make a splendid show on their return; and riding parties that got no rides, but trudged through the sand on foot, to the great delectation of the artist who sketched, con amore, the figures of gentlemen struggling up a sandy hill, eyes arsd ears and mouth full, hands clapped on hat to secure its tenure, and coat tails manifesting strong tendencies\n\n36\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nto secede bodily, -while in the distance, small and indis tinct, could be perceived the ambulance that could nt be made to go, and underneath was written the touching inscription, \"How Captain Merryman and Mr. E. accepted Mrs. W.s invitation, and took a ride on the beach at Port Macon.\"\n\nAt last the gale subsided a little, and we got off. Another salute was fired as we steamed out; the \"Wayanda\" returned a single shot in acknowledgment, and all too soon we were among the breakers, pitching and writhing, fore and aft, starboard and larboard, diag onally crosswise and backward, up to the sky and down, till the waves poured over the deck, and the masts seemed inclined to give the flags and streamers at their tops a bath. But for some of us, at least, the seasick ness was gone, lo Triumpe 1\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n37\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nFort Fisher.\n\nON the morning of the 8th of May we came in sight of a long, low line of sand banks, dotted with curious hillocks, between which the black muzzles of heavy guns could be made out, and fringed with a perfect naval chevaux-de-frise of wrecked blockade runners, whose bro ken hulls and protruding machinery gave an ill-omened look to the whole coast. As we were closely studying the bleak aspect of this entrance to the great smuggling entrepot of the Southern Confederacy, the glasses began to reveal an unexpected activity along the line of the guns, which our signal shot for a pilot by no means diminished. Our ship drew too much water to cross the bar, excepting at high tide, and we were, conse quently, compelled to go over in the Captains gig to the pilot boat a proceeding that the rough sea made very difficult and even dangerous. Leaving those who could not venture the transhipment, to roll wearily among the breakers till evening, we headed straight through the narrow and difficult channel for Port Fisher-,- and learned that we had been mistaken for the Eebel pirate \" Stonewall,\" and that the guns had been shotted ready to open fire the moment we should show signs of a dis position to run in.*\n\n- *The Stonewall seems indeed to have produced about this time an excitement along tie whole coast, amounting, in Borne places, to\n\n38\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nAh ! that weary day at Fort Fisher! To see a fort is naturally supposed to be not the most formidable of undertakings; but to see ; Fort Fisher means a ride of miles over the bleakest of sand bars; means the climb ing of great heaps of sand, under the hottest of suns; means a scrambling over irregular chasms and precipices of sand, where the explosions have destroyed at once. every semblance of fortification and every foot of solid earth means all this, prolonged for hours, under the penalty of the consciousness that otherwise you would be pretending to see Fort Fisher, when you were doing nothing of the sort.\n\nWe began by climbing Battery Buchanan, near the landing, and inside the main line of works. Trenches, embrasures, casemate and barbette guns, bomb-proofs, gabions, riflemens pits, all in sand that no rifle projec tiles could breach, and bombardment could only render stronger, seemed to assure absolute impregnability to this work alone, except against regular siege operations. Yet it was but protection for one flank of the long line before which Weitzel turned back, and which no sol diers but ours would ever have stormed. To this battery (so called, although a perfect and very strong fort Jn~ itself) the Rebels made their last retreat, after that long, hand-to-hand fight through the sea front of the fort, which stretched far into the night, and seemed doubtful to the last. But Battery Buchanan, though impregna ble, as a flank to the sea line, is itself commanded by the last work of that sea line; and so when the Mound\n\npanic. The naval officer at Key West, for example, issued orders to extinguish the lights in the light-houses along the coast, lest the Stonewall should run into some of the harbors and destroy the shipping.\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n39\n\nBattery fell into our hands, its guns had only to be turned, and Buchanan fell almost without a struggle.\n\nThe Mound Battery is a vast heap of sand, uplifting its guns and embrazures from a flat and desert beach against the sky, and commanding perfectly the whole northern entrance to the river. It contained one of the finest specimens of heavy ordnance ever seen in this country, the famous Armstrong rifle, presented by Brit ish sympathizers to the Confederacy.\n\nImagine a long line of batteries, connected by trav erses in the sand, separated by huge hillocks of sand, and fronted by deep trenches in the sand, stretching away almost interminably along the coast toward the North, and ending in another strong work, which was supposed to protect that flank as perfectly as Buchanan did the other; put in magazines and bomb-proofs, at convenient points, and a very heavy armament; then conceive muzzles of the guns knocked off, guns dis mounted, carriages shattered, the parapets plowed with shells, a great crater in the sand where a magazine had exploded, all shape and symmetry battered out of the works, and only their rude strength remaining; and you have Fort Fisher.\n\nThe ground was covered with showers of musket balls. Behind every traverse could be found little heaps of English-made cartridges, which the Rebel sharpshooters had laid out for the convenience of rapid firing, as they defended line after line of the successive batteries, along which they were driven. Fragments of shells lay everywhere over the works. Behind them were great heaps of shells, bayonets, broken muskets, and other fragments of iron, which were being dug out and collected to be sold for old iron. Hundreds on hun-\n\n40\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\ndreds of acres were under negro cultivation, producing\n\nthis valuable crop.\n\nNo man, I think, will ride along the coast line, which,\n\nby an inconceivable amount of labor, has been con\n\nverted into one immense fort, withoutsympathizing\n\nwith the officers who refused to assault it, and marvel\n\ning at the* seeming recklessness which success converted\n\ninto the splendid audacity of the final attack. *.\n\nThe pilot boat was again placedat the disposal of our\n\nparty, after some hours spent at Fort Fisher, and we\n\nran over to Fort Caswell, one of the main defenses of\n\nthe other entrance. It was originally a regularly-built\n\nbrick fortification, with casemate and barbette guns,\n\nsalients, ditch and interior castle, pierced with loop\n\nholes, for a last defense with musketry. Like Fort\n\nMacon, at Beaufort (and like Sumter), this has been\n\nconverted into an infinitely stronger work, by having\n\nearthen fortifications thrown up outside and against it.\n\nThe Rebels blew it up after the surrender of Fort\n\nFisher, and we shall probably be making appropria\n\ntions, every Congress, for the next dozen years to\n\nrebuild it. \"\n\nThe labor here, as well as the vast amount involved\n\nin the construction of Fort Fisher, was all performed\n\nby slaves, impressed from time to .time by the Eebel\n\nauthorities. Both works were completed Wilmington\n\nhad grown rich on the profits of blockade-running;\n\nThe joint Committee of Congress on the Conduct of the War, after examining Generals Grant, Butler, Weitzel and Terry, and Admiral Porter, as well as the Rebel commander of the Fort, and after a careful inspection of the fortifications themselves, have, in a report published since the above was written, reached substan tially the same conclusions. They attach no blame to any one for the failure to attack, in the first movement upon the Fort.\n\nA SOUTHEBN TOUE. ,\n\n41\n\nNassau had risen to first-class commercial importance, and the beach under these guns was strewn with the wrecks, which spoke more loudly than could any bal ance sheet, of the profits of a business that could afford such losses before our Congress had done disputing whether the Constitution, and a due regard for the rights of our Southern brethren, would permit us to use negroes as teamsters!\n\n4\n\n42\n\nAFTER THE WAR :\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nWilmington Unionism Blockade Running Destitution Negro Talk Land Sales.\n\nGENERAL HAWLEY, commanding at Wilmington, had come down to Port Fisher, on hearing of the arrival of our party, accompanied by General Abbott, General Dodge, and a number of prominent citizens of North Carolina. They were all transferred to our vessel, and, with the tide in her favor, and under sail, the \" Wayanda \" astonished us all by steaming up the river at the rate of fourteen knots an hour. Captain Merryman, however, insisted she could do as much any time, only it wasnt always convenient to get her best speed out of her! And, of course, we were bound to believe the Captain. Do we not make it a point of patriotic duty to believe all the brilliant reports of the running capacity displayed by our iron-clads and double-enders ?\n\nBlockade runners had been sunk for miles up the river, and in some places the hulls and machinery still formed a partial obstruction to navigation. Torpedoes, fished out by the navy, lay here and there along the banks, and a few, it was said, were still in the channel, unless, as was hoped, the tide had washed them away.\n\nAmong the North Carolinians accompanying General Hawley, were a couple of gentlemen from Raleigh Mr. Moore, a leading lawyer there, and Mr. Pennington, the editor of the Ealeigh Progress--who had come\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n43\n\ndown to Wilmington to see Chief Justice Chase. Another gentleman in the company, introduced as \"Mr.\" Baker a tall, slender man, of graceful manners, and evident culture and experience had been through nearly the whole war as Colonel of a North Carolina Rebel regiment.\n\nStrangely enough, Colonel Baker claimed to have been a Union man all the time, from which some idea may be had of the different phases Unionism in the South has assumed. His father had been a Unionist of unques tioned firmness; but the son, returning from Europe in the midst of the secession enthusiasm, found the social pressure of his circle too much to withstand. \" I was forced,\" he naively said, \"to raise a regiment in order to retain my influence in the community!\" And, with equal naivete, he added, that if he had not thus retained his influence, he could now have been of no use in aid ing to compose these difficulties! He pointed out a fine rice plantation on the bank of the river, which he had owned, but about his title to which, now, he seemed .to have some doubts. He claimed, and other \"Wilmingtonians agreed with him, that the rice grown here is superior to that of South Carolina and Georgia, and that its culture, in spite of the latitude, is quite as profitable. *\n\nThe gentlemen from Raleigh and Colonel Baker seemed each to be a representative of a different phase of North Carolina Unionism. The editor had always opposed secession till it was accomplished. Then he was compelled to go with the current, but as soon as\n\n* The farther north you can grow any grain, or other crop, and mature it, the better it is according to the theory of the North Car olina planters. The rice crop is more profitable here, they claim, than on the best plantations about Savannah.\n\n44\n\nAFTER THE AVAR :\n\nthe first fury was over, and the reaction began, he became openly anti-Davis, and as much anti-war as he dared. He was an enthusiastic admirer of General Sherman; thought the censure by the Northern press, of his arrangement with Johnston, very unjust; was anxious now for the speediest possible restoration of civil authority, and believed the people stood willing to acqui esce in whatever basis of re-organization the President would prescribe. If he had his way, he would have no negro suffrage; even that would be preferable to remain ing unorganized, and would be accepted by the people, though it would cause great dissatisfaction.\n\nThe lawyer, on the other hand, insisted that none would revolt, with more loathing, from the bare idea of negro suffrage, than the best Union men in the State, who had suffered the most for their devotion to the Government and opposition to the war. \" It would not even be satisfactory.\" he insisted, \"to leave the negroes, like other non-voting classes, to take care of themselves. To leave them absolutely without any control, save such as the law extends to white people, also, would be unen durable. Either you nrust take pity,\" he exclaimed, on-those of us who, for four years, have endured every thing for the sake of the old flag, and send the negroes out of the country altogether, or you must place them under the control of the Legislature.\" \"What policy toward them would the Legislature be apt to adopt?\" \" It ought to provide against vagrancy; adopt measures to require them to fulfill their contracts for labor, and authorize their sale, for a term of years, for breaches of order.* Either do that, and so protect us against\n\n* In other words, call them freedmen, but indirectly make them slaves again. The same idea seems to pervade the State, and,\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n45\n\nan intolerable nuisance, or colonize them out of the country.\"\n\nThe Colonel was not so emphatic in favor of this virtual re-enslavement of the negroes, nor so peremp tory in his condemnation of negro suffrage; b.ut he thought it would be wise to conciliate as much as possi ble, and to avoid deep-seated prejudices. It was easy to see that he was looking to what would be the least unpopular with the people of North Carolina; and, indeed, I heard later in the evening, that he was not unwilling to ask them to send him to Congress.\n\nClearly enough, few Union men in the South, who have political aspirations, can be safely expected to advocate justice, much less generosity, to the negro, or severity to the Eebels. The latter are sure to be voters many of them now, after carelessly taking oaths of allegiance all of them some day; and politi cians are not likely.to make haste in doing that which they know to be odious to the men whose votes they want.\n\nAt a dinner party at General Hawleys, and subse quently at a little party, later in the evening, we saw\n\nindeed, the entire South. Colonel Boynton, a very intelligent and trustworthy officer, writing from Danville, North Carolina, on the 21st of June, said:\n\n11 The belief is by no means general here, that slavery is dead, and a hope that, in some undefined way, they will yet control the slaves, is in many minds, amounting with some to a conviction. They look for its restoration through State action not yet compre hending that the doctrine of State sovereignty has been somewhat shattered by the war. Here, as in Richmond, the people, instead of grappling with the fact that the war has liberated the slaves, are very busy proving the utter worthlessness of the negroes, and treating them with additional cruelty and contempt neither offer ing them fair inducements to work, or working themselves.\"\n\n46\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nand. heard a good deal of the feelings of the people. The women aje very polite to Yankee officers in partic ular, but very bitter against Yankees in general. Negro troopsare their especialjietestati on; and for the mon strosity of attemptingto teach negroes to read and write, they could find no words to express their scorn. A young oificer told me that he had been \"cut\" by some ladies, with whom he had previously been on very cor dial terms, because they had seen him going into one of the negro schools! The men of North Carolina may be \"subjugated,\" but who shall subjugate the women? \\_G-overnor Yance has been very unpopular, and the people seem to take kindly enough to the idea that his authority will not be recognized.^ They say he was a Union man in feeling and conviction, but that Jeff. Davis, alarmed by the dissatisfaction in North Carolina, sent for him about the time of his last election, and per suaded him that he could be the next President of the Confederacy! The Presidential idea was as baneful in Eebeldom, as it has proved to so many Northern states men, and Yance was destroyed.\n\nEvery Northern man in Wilmington lives in the very best style the place aifords, no matter how slender his visible resoxirces. I was the guest of a civil officer whose salary can not be over two thousand dollars. His home was a spacious three-story double structure, that would have done no discredit to Fifth Avenue. You approach it through a profusion of the rarest shrubbery; it was in the most aristocratic quarter of the city, was elegantly furnished, and filled with servants all on two thousand dollars a year, less the Govern ment tax. But this is modest and moderate. The offi cer at least made the one house serve all his purposes.\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n47\n\nAnother a Colonel on duty here is less easily satis fied. He has no family, but he finds one of the largest and best-furnished double houses in the town only suffi cient for his bachelor wants, as a private residence. Another house, equally spacious and eligible, is required for the uses of his office ! (_And, in general, our people seem to go upon the theory that, having conquered the country, they are entitled to the best it has, and in duty bound to use as much of it as possible^\n\nThese houses are generally such as were shut up by their rich Eebel owners on the approach of our troops below the city. The proprietors have retired to adja cent country places, to be out of harms way till they see how Eebels are to be treated, and already they are making their calculations about returning in the fall, with a coolness almost disconcerting to their selfappointed tenants. Mrs. General Hawley tells a piquant story of a visit from the wife of a runaway Eebel, whose showy but uncomfortable house the General has seized for quarters and private residence. The lady made herself as agreeable as possible, spoke of the Gen erals occupancy and her own absence, much as people who had gone off to the sea-shore for the summer might speak of renting their town house till their return; intimating that she wouldnt hurry the General com manding for the world, and hoped that he would remain with his family until it was entirely convenient to remove, but suggested that she and her husband thought they would probably return in a couple or three months, when, of course, they supposed their house would be ready for them ! Confiscation seemed to have no terrors for her; or, if it had, they were dexter ously concealed under an air of smiling and absolute assurance.\n\n48\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nThe loosest ideas prevail as to the execution of the \" abandoned-property \" act of the Thirty-seventh Con gress. Deserted houses, not absolutely needed for mili tary purposes, can be rented for handsome sums, and to whatever amounts can be thus realized the Government has an equitable as well as legal claim. But here, and report says everywhere throughout the South, are evi dences of the old clashing betwixt War and Treasury Department officials; and between them, the revenue the Government ought to derive from the abandoned property, is sadly reduced.\n\nThe practice of regarding everything left in the country as legitimate prize to the first officer who dis covers it, has led, in some cases, to performances little creditable to the national uniform. \"What shall be thought of the officer who, finding a fine law library, straightway packed it lip and sent it to his office in the North ? Or what shall be said of the taste of that other officer who, finding in an old country residence a series of family portraits, imagined that they would form, very pretty parlor ornaments anywhere, and sent the entire set, embracing the ancestors of the haughty old South Carolinian for generations back, to look down from the walls of his Yankee residence ?\n\nOne sees, at first, very little in the mere external appearance of Wilmjngton to indicate the suiferings of war. The city is finely built (for the South); the streets are lined with noble avenues of trees ; many of the residences are surrounded with elegant shrubbery; there is a bewildering wealth of flowers; the streets are full, and many of the stores are open. Sutlers, however, have taken the places of the old dealers, and many of the inhabitants are inconceivably helpless and\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n49\n\ndestitute. \"While I was riding over the city with Cap tain Myers, a young Ohio artillerist, a formerly wealthy citizen approached him to beg the favor of some means of taking his family three or four miles into the coun try. The officer could only offer the broken \"Southron\" a pair of mules and an army wagon; and this shabby outfit, which four years ago he would not have per mitted his body servant to use, he gratefully accepted\n\nfor his wife and daughter! Struggling through the waste of sand which constitutes\n\nthe streets, could be seen other and more striking illus trations of the workings of the war : a crazy cart, with wheels on the eve of a general secession, drawn gener ally by a single horse, to which a good meal of oats must have been unknown for months, loaded with tables, chairs, a bedstead, a stove and some frying-pans, and driven by a sallow, lank, long-haired, wiry-bearded representative of the poor white trash, who had proba bly perched a sun-bonneted, toothless wife, and a brace of tow-head children among the furniture; or a group, too poor even for a cart, clothed in rags, bearing bun dles of rags, and, possibly, driving a half-starved cow. These were refugees from the late theater of military operations. They seemed hopeless, and, in some cases, scarcely knew where they wanted to go.\n\nFew of the old residents of \"Wilmington. are believed to have profited by the blockade running. It was always considered a disreputable business, in which a high-minded Rebel would not care to be thought con cerned ; and so it fell chiefly into the hands of foreigners, and particularly of Jews. A few prominent Richmond people were believed to be deeply engaged in it Trenholm, Governor Smith, Benjamin and Jeff. Davis are all named but wherever the profits went, they did\n\n50\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nnot go to a general diffusion of property among tho Wilmingtonians themselves.\n\nJay Cooke was under the impression that there must be a great deal of gold throughout the Southern cities, and especially in this center of blockade running, that ought to be available for the 7.30 loan; but the testimony here goes to show that the wealthy people have most of their gold abroad, and that they do not have a great deal of it anywhere. Undoubtedly nothing would more tend to tie these people to the Union than such a cord as a United States bond, connecting their pockets with national permanence and prosperity, but they seem now hard enough pressed to buy the necessaries of life; and money for investments in national securities, is not likely to flow northward, for the simple reason that it is not in the country.\n\nCegroes are already beginning to congregate here from the surrounding country. They do not wish to trust their old masters on the plantations ; and, without any definite purpose or plan, they have a blind, but touching instinct, that wherever the flag is floating it is a good place for friendless negroes to go^f Others are hunting up children or wives, from whom they have long been separated. Quite a number have been located on plantations, and these are working better than could be expected ; but the uncertainty of their tenure of the land, the constant return of the old proprietors, and the general confusion and uncertainty as to the ownership of real estate, under the confiscation and abandonedproperty laws, combine to unsettle both them and the. Superintendents of Preedmen, who are trying to care for them.\n\nThe native negroes of Wilmington, however, are doing\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n51\n\nwell. They are of a much higher order of intelligence than those from the country; are generally in comfort able circumstances, and already find time to look into politics. They have a Union League formed among themselves, the object of which is to stimulate to indus try and education, and to secure combined effort for suf frage, without which they insist that they will soon bo practically enslaved again. A delegation of them waited on Mr. Chase; and certainly looked as well and talked as lucidly as any of the poor whites would have done. There are a very few of the whites who encourage them; but, in general, the bitterest prejudice against these black Unionists, is still among those who have been the only white Unionists the often-described poor white trash.\n\nThe Wilmington negroes have no faith in the ready assent to the proposition that slavery is dead, which all the old slaveholders give. JThey say and the negro refugees, all, and some of the whites bear them out in it that in the country slavery still practically exists. The masters tell them that slavery is to be restored as soon as the army is removed ; that the Government is already mustering the army out of service; that next year, when the State is re-organized, the State authori ties will control slavery. Meantime, the negroes are worked as hard as ever in some cases a little harder and they have no more protection from the cruelty of the whites than ever. * \\\n\n* Numerous instances were told, while I was at Wilmington, but the following case, related by Colonel Boynton, occurred farther in the interior:\n\n\" Here in Salisbury, two prominent men are on trial by a mili tary court, for killing a negro, and one of the wealthiest, most refined and respectable young ladies in all this section, is under\n\n52\n\nAFTER THE WAK:\n\n\"I tell you, sah\" said a.very intelligent negro, who had been reciting the present troubles of his people, \"we aint noways safe, long as dem people makes de laws wes got to be governed by. Wes got to hab a voice in de pintin of de law-makers. Den we knows our frens, and whose hans wes safe in.\"\n\nThe war, according to these negroes, had, in some respects, made slavery harder for them than before. They were naturally trusted less, and watched more. Then, when provisions became scarce, their rations, on the large plantations, were reduced. On one, for exam ple, the field hands got no meat at all, and their allow ance consisted of a peck of unsifted corn-meal and a pint of molasses per week. On another, they got two pounds of meat, a peck of meal, and a quart of molasses per week. Before the war, they had double as much meat, and a peck and a-half of meal. Thus fed, they were expected to begin work in the fields at day-break, and continue, with only the intermission of half an hour at noon, till dark.\n\nIn some cases the negroes, understanding that they are freed, have refused to work without a contract for wages. Some of them have been promised their board, and a quarter of the corn crop; others three dollars for\n\ntwenty thousand dollars bonds to appear and answer for shooting a negro woman with her own hands. Miss Temple Neeley is con sidered one of the belles of the State. The family is very wealthy, aristocratic, and all that, and stands at the very top in this section. Her mother was flogging a little negro child, when the mother of the child interfered to protect it. Miss Neeley stepped up, and, draw ing a revolver from her pocket, shot the negro woman dead, firing a second ball into the body. She was arrested, and will be tried by a military court. The papers here are defending her, and try ing to stir up the old feeling toward the slaves, and excusing her under the black laws of the State.\"\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUK.\n\n53\n\na seasons work; others a dollar and a-half or two dol lars a month. But the town negroes, especially those of the League, say they have but little faith that the contracts will be kept.\n\nFurther conversation with the people led me to think that, in the main, they might be divided into three classes. One, embracing, I think, a majority of the people, is thoroughly cowed by the crushing defeat, has the profoundest respect for the power that has whipped them so badly, and, under the belief of its neces sity, will submit to anything the Government may require negro suffrage, territorial pupilage anything. A smaller class are Union men, if they can have the Union their way if the negroes can be kept under, and themselves put foremost. And another class are violent and malignant Eebels, enraged at their defeat, and hardly yet willing to submit to the inevitable.\n\nThe loss,of life has been frightful. Half the families are in mourning. I hear of a Danville regiment, twelve hundred strong, of whom less than fifty survive. Not less than eighty thousand arms-bearing men of the State are believed to have been killed or disabled. This, and the disorganization of the labor system, have naturally left thousands of families through the State utterly destitute. Mr. Pennington, the editor of the Ealeigh Progress, predicts great distress next winter. In fact, the Government is already issuing rations to thousands of destitute whites.\n\nAs yet, notwithstanding their poverty and destitution, few of the large landowners have put their estates in the market. No such feeling exists here, however, as in Virginia, where the farmers are said to hold on with\n\n54\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\na death grip to their lands, and to consider it discred itable to sell to a Yankee. Many of the most violent Rebels here will sell at exceedingly low rates, in order to get out of the country, where everything reminds them of their mortifying defeat and disgrace. And of those who remain, large numbers will be forced to sell part of .their lands, to get means for living comfortably on the remainder. * The new blood, likely thus to be infused\n\n* On the 1st of August a single real estate firm in Kaleigh adver tised no less than sixty-three different tracts of North Carolina lands for sale at low rates, and on easy terms. Here are a couple of specimens:\n\n\"We offer for sale one of the finest rice plantations in the State of North Carolina, known as Lyrias, and situated on the north west branch of Cape Fear river, three and a-half miles above Wilmington. This plantation contains 275 acres, 250 of which are cleared, and 25 are river swamp lands. There is also an upland settlement attached, with a dwelling-house, all necessary outhouses, comfortable quarters for fifty laborers, and an excellent well of water.\n\n\"The rice lands, with the exception of about 20 acres, are of a clay soil, of unsurpassed and inexhaustible fertility, and capable of producing rice, corn, wheat, oats, peas and hay.\n\n\" It is every way susceptible of being also made a good stock farm, for cattle and hogs, and an excellent market garden.\n\n\"The entire plantation is in good order. It has on it two com modious barns, 100 by 40 and 75 by 60 feet, respectively. Also, a steam engine of ten-horse power, together with a powerful pump, or water elevator, worked by the engine, which throws out two thous and gallons of water per minute. Also, a threshing machine, in a building 25 by 35 feet.\"\n\n\" All that really baronial estate, known as William S. Pettigrews Magnolia Plantation, for sale cheap. 1,000 acres improved! Over 600 acres in a high state of cultivation! 50, or over, bushels of corn per acre! Rich alluvial soils, suitable for farms and vege table gardens! Only ten hours from Norfolk ! Water transport*-\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUK.\n\n55\n\ninto North Carolina, will be its salvation; and the capital which is now seeking openings for trade, will presently find vastly more profitable returns from invest ments in lands.\n\nGeneral Hawley, General Abbott and their wives, the Collector, the Treasury Agent, a party of staff officers and others, pursued us with kindness till our vessel had absolutely pushed off from the almost deserted wharf, which, four years ago, was crowded with the keels of a thriving commerce, and even a year ago bustled with scores of adventurous blockade runners. Trade, indeed, follows the flag; but for trade you must have money; and of this there is far too little in the exhausted country to bring back business into its old channels, as speedily as. Northern speculators are imagining.\n\nSome of the officers and their wives came down with\n\ntion from the barn. The far-famed Scuppernonggrape is a .native of this county, and grows in a luxuriant abundance unsurpassed in any country. The residence, barns, out-buildings, groves, etc., eta., are very superior. Good well of water, etc., etc.\n\n\" This very large, and really magnificent estate, contains seven thousand acres of those rich alluvial Scuppernong river lands; one thousand acres already drained, and most of it in a high state of cultivation, and the whole of the rest can be easily and effect ually drained; thus opening up large plantations scarcely sur passed in fertility by the Mississippi bottoms, which they greatly exceed in proximity to markets, having cheap and easy carriage, almost, if not quite, from the barn door to Norfolk, Baltimore, Phil adelphia, New York, Boston and the whole world!\n\n\"Sea-going vessels can now come within a few miles of the barn door, and by deepening one canal, this desirable result can be obtained.\"\n\n56\n\nAFTER TUB WAR:\n\nus in the river steamer, to the bar, whither the \" Wayanda\" had returned to await us; and kindly good byes and fluttering handkerchiefs could still be heard and seen after the vessels had each begun moving. At the North, we think little of loyalty; here loyal men, and especially those in the service of the Government, seem drawn toward each other, as are men who serve under the same flag in a foreign country.\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n57\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nCharleston Harbor Could Sumtor have been Stormed Negroes and Poor Whites.\n\nWE steamed into Charleston Harbor early in the morning; and one by one, Sumter, Moultrio, Pinkney, and at last the City of Desolation itself rose from the smooth expanse of water, as the masts of ships rise from the ocean when yon approach them. Where, four years ago, before the fatal attack on this now shapeless heap of sand and mortar, the flags of all nations fluttered, and the wharves were crowded with a commerce that successfully rivaled Savannah, Mobile and every other Southern city save New Orleans, and even aspired to compete with New York in the Southern markets, only transports and Quartermasters vessels were now to be seen, with here and there a passenger steamer, plying to and from ISTew York for the accommodation of Yankee officers and their wives! The harbor itself was dotted with insignificant-looking iron clads, min gled with an occasional old ship of the line, and, in ampler supply, the modern \"Yankee gunboats,\" of the double-ender type, which formed so potent a cause for alarm in the councils of the privates in the Eebel armies.\n\nThe elegant residences along the battery front retained the aristocratic seclusion of their embowering\n\nO\n\nshrubbery, creepers and flowering plants; but even through these gracious concealments which Mature cast\n\n58\n\nAFTER THE WAR:\n\nover them, the scars from the Swamp Angel could everywhere be seen. Pavements had been torn up from the principal business streets, to build the bat teries that lined the shore; and great embankments, crowned with Tredegar guns, shut out the prospect from many an aristocratic window. The unfinished Custom House was among the most conspicuous buildings, the white marble blockslying scattered about it, as they were left by the workmen four years ago. \" We 11 never finish it,\" the fervid revolutionists said, as they began the war. \"Weve paid Yankee tariffs long enough; now, hurrah for free trade with our friends of France and Great Britain!\" But the Custom House stands, and next winter Mr. Fessenden will be reporting to the Senate an item in the military appropriation bill for its completion.\n\nAdmiral Dahlgren and Fleet Captain Bradford came alongside in the Admirals gig, soon after our arrival; and while our boatswain was piping his whistle as the Admiral came over the ships side, the guns of the \" Paw nee\" began, a salute for the Chief Justice. The Treasury Agent and some other officials soon followed, and the Admiral took the party under his charge, transferred us to a comfortable and speedy little harbor steamer, and started toward that first goal of every mans curi osity Sumter.\n\nThe rfBellion has left its marks on the pale, thought ful features of the Admiral, not less than upon the harbor he has been assailing. The terrible death of noble young Ulric Dahlgren, a martyr to the barbarism of slavery, might well grave deep traces on a fathers face; but the climate here, and the labors of the past have also been very trying, and one can readily believe, what used to be rather sarcastically urged by the Admirals enemies,\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUK.\n\n59\n\nthat ,his health did not permit him to keep up in gun nery with General G-illmore.\n\nWe passed a little sailing vessel manned by blacks. The Admiral told us that they had brought it down one of the rivers, the other day, and he had allowed them to keep it. They earn a livelihood bringing wood to the city. Recently there have been a number of out rages perpetrated on the blacks inland, by their late masters and some of the returning Eebel soldiers. Greatly infuriated, the blacks came to him begging for arms. \" I have never before doubted their orderly dis position,\" he said, \"and^I am not sure that anybody would remain orderly under those circumstances.\"\n\nThe Charleston city negroes were represented as unexpectedly intelligent. \" Out of two hundred and seventy-four laborers at work on the streets,\" said one of the city officials who had joined us, \" one hundred and seventy-four are negroes the rest whites. Of the negroes, over a hundred (or over four-sevenths) can read, while scarcely one-seventh of the whites .have made the same advancement!\"* Captain Bradford gave a significant illustration of the progress of some ideas among the less intelligent negroes of the country. They had again and again asked him, he said, what good it did them to make them free, unless they were to own the land on which they had been working, and which they had made productive and valuable. \" Gib us our own land and we take care ourselves; but widout land, de ole massas can hire us or starve us, as dey please.\"\n\n*The ignorance of tlie poor whites in South Carolina is pro verbial. But, as a negro acutely pointed out, \" Dey have nt learned, because dey dont care; we, because dey wouldnt let us.\" A little before the time of this visit, James Eedpath, acting as Superintend-\n\n60\n\nAFTER THE WAR\n\nA huge mass of iron was pointed out as we passed, not unlike the plates of the famous \"Merrimac,\" or like the gunboat \" Benton,\" on the Mississippi. It was one of the Eebel iron clads, sunk just before the evacuation of the city. They had injured it very little, and our authorities are confident of making it one of the best iron clads in the service. Enforced self-reliance, had, indeed, gone far toward making the South a nation ; for here were fine engines, worthy of our most extensive Northern shops, which had been manufactured in Geor gia within a year. Before the war, such an undertaking as making engines for a great steamer, in the South, was scarcely dreamed of. ISfear the iron clad lay some of the cigar-shaped torpedo boats an invention never very successful, and now, let us hope, with its occupa tion, wholly gone.\n\nThe obstructions in the harbor, which so long kept the iron clads under Dupont and Dahlgren at bay, still stretched in a long line, unbroken in parts, across from Sumter toward the land on either side. Plenty of tor pedoes were supposed to be still in the harbor Captain Bradford himself had been blown up not long ago by one of them, to the serious discomposure of his personal\n\nent of the schools, reported nine public day and five night schools, under the superintendence of his bureau, with the following aver\n\nage attendance:\n\nAt Normal School...................................................................................... 620 At St. Philip School...................................................................................1,100 At Morris Street School.............................................................................. 822 At Ashley Street School.............................................................................. 305 At King Street School (boys)...................................................................... 300 At Meeting Street School (boys)................................................................ 250 At Ch.ilmers Street School (girls)............................................................... 161 At St. Michaels School (boys).................................................................... 160 Night Schools for adults contain................................................................ 500\n\nA SOUTHERN TOUR.\n\n61\n\neffects, in cabin and state-room, but without actual phys ical injury.\n\nBut for two things, a stranger might have supposed Sumter a mere pile of mortar, stones and sand, which only culpalole lack of enterprise left to block up the harbor. From the center of the rubbish rose a flag staff, with the stars and stripes floating at the top ; arid near the waters edge, uninjured casements still stood among the debris, with black muzzles peeping out, as from the lower deck of an old ship of the line. Closer inspection showed, also, some little howitzers and other light pieces, placed on what was once the parapet.\n\nThe sun fairly parboiled us, and, coming into this tropical heat so suddenly for the night before, on the deck of the.\"~VYayanda,\" at sea, we were wearing over coats it was so oppressive as to produce a sickeningfain tness on some of the party; but we patiently fol lowed everywhere, clambered over the shapeless sea wall, inspected the sand gabions, worked our way into the snugly-protected little out-looks for the sharp-shoot ers, ran down the inside of what had been the walls, and dived into the subteranean regions where the case mate guns stood all the time of the bombardment, xminjured, but not deigning to waste their ammunition in useless replies. The contracted but comparatively com fortable quarters here remain almost as the Rebels left them. A long, damp hall, with a few cots still stand ing in it, was the place for the garrison, where they slept in comparative indifference to the explosion of shells overhead; a rather more airy hall still contained the old, split-bottom arm-chairs, which the officers had collected; on another side were the hospitals, and ghastly sight there, on a shelf, were half a dozen coffins, which had\n\n62\n\nAFTER THE AVAR:\n\nbeen all ready for the reception of the next victims to\n\nGillmores shells !\n\nFresh from Port Fisher, which had been stormed, it\n\nwas natural that one should look on Fort Sumter with\n\nsurprise, when told that it could not be stormed. The\n\nofficers say the garrison would have retreated to the\n\ncasemates, from whence they could have made the occu\n\npation of the interior area of the fort impossible; but\n\nsurely the men who swarmed over that northern end of\n\nFort Fisher, and fought through the whole afternoon\n\nand far into the night, from traverse to traverse, down\n\nto the Mound battery, would have needed little time to\n\nestablish themselves here. They say, too, that the fire\n\nfrom the Rebel works on Morris Island would have ren\n\ndered Sumter untenable, but that fire could not have\n\nbeen more powerful than ours had been from James\n\nIsland. Tet the Rebels did not find Sumter untenable\n\non account of our fire. Whether an assault upon Sum\n\nter necessarily bloody beyond precedent could Have\n\nfteen justif"
