        "text": "Mulligan Stew\n\nFriday night is coming so you′re saving all your money\n\nCause you need to buy some buds and some beer\n\nYou won't be doing nothing cause you spent up all your money\n\nSo you smoke until you choke and drink your beer all alone\n\nYou drank up all your beer and you′re feeling fine\n\nYou look up at the clock, it's only quarter till nine\n\nSo you woof a bunch of munchies cause there's nothing to do\n\nBut when you find they don′t mix, you′re chuckin' mulligan stew\n\nNow you′re moving up\n\nSmoking major league base balls\n\nYour price is getting higher each hit\n\nThe night keeps getting longer, a couple hits will make you stronger\n\nSo ya smoke another 8-ball and get deeper in debt\n\nYou've got this young blonde\n\nWho′s as thin as a dime\n\nShe's inhaling all your blow and leaving nothing behind\n\nAs your debt keeps coming with the rising sun\n\nWhen you look for what you want you know that she′ll be gone\n\n(You got it)\n\nJesus Christ is coming\n\nSo we've got to get ready\n\nFor broad is the road to death\n\nJesus hasn't come to call the righteous (but the sinners)\n\nFor all have fallen short of the glory of God\n\nWriter(s): Gerry Mulligan<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
