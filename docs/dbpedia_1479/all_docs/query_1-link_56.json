Prepare for a rib-sticking dish that’s easy but always warm and delicious.\n\nThe Best Old-Fashioned Mulligan Stew, Perfect for Fall!\n\nDo you want a one-pot meal that’s a little different from the same old chili or beef stew? Then you’ve got to give this one a try. If you’ve never had Mulligan Stew before, it will become a favorite in your kitchen. Made with tender chunks of beef, tangy tomatoes, sweet peas, green beans, and more, it’s a hearty cross between your favorite vegetable soup and thick, hearty beef stew. Share this on a chilly evening, and you’ll be in heaven!\n\nWhy You’ll Love Making Mulligan Stew\n\nNostalgic: Mulligan Stew is old-fashioned comfort food at its finest. You’ll love this campfire-style family favorite.\n\nFrugal: Mulligan stew is one of those recipes where you can use up whatever ingredients are on hand, making it a great way to enjoy your leftovers and reduce food waste!\n\nCozy: Stews are the best comfort food, and mulligan stew is no exception. It’s a warm, satisfying classic.\n\nSimple: Who knew you could get so much flavor from a few basic ingredients, plus, it’s incredibly easy to make.\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between Irish Stew and Mulligan Stew?\n\nIrish stew and Mulligan stew are both hearty, traditional recipes, but they are a little bit different. Irish stew is typically a simple dish made of lamb or beef, potatoes, onions, and carrots. Mulligan stew is a little more eclectic, usually a colorful combo of various leftovers, which means you might find all kinds of summer or winter veggies, meats, and seasonings. This recipe is a great basic version that you can whip up easily (even if you’re short on leftovers at the moment).\n\nIngredients for Mulligan Stew\n\nCurious about what goes into this version of classic Mulligan stew? It’s full of tender chunks of beef, a colorful array of vegetables, and plenty of savory seasonings. Here’s the list of ingredients:\n\nOlive Oil: For sauteing. You can use any neutral cooking oil that you like.\n\nBeef: Stew beef or chuck roast, cut into cubes.\n\nSalt and Pepper\n\nOnion and Garlic: Dice the onion, and mince or press the garlic.\n\nPaprika: I like to use smoked paprika to give it that rustic, campfire vibe. Sweet paprika would also be acceptable.\n\nBeef Broth: You could substitute vegetable or chicken broth, but those will not produce that deeper color and flavor.\n\nCarrots: Cut into one-inch chunks.\n\nPotatoes: Cubed.\n\nTomatoes: Fresh tomatoes are fine if you have them, but I usually go with canned, crushed tomatoes.\n\nGreen Beans: I used fresh, but frozen are also okay to use.\n\nPeas: Use frozen peas.\n\nHerbs: Dried oregano and rosemary, and some freshly chopped parsley.\n\nHow to Make Mulligan Stew\n\nMaking Mulligan Stew is so easy – just brown the beef to build those deep, savory notes, then toss in your vegetables and let them mingle with the meaty goodness.\n\nBrown the Beef. Heat the oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven, and sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper. Brown the beef on all sides, then set it on a clean plate.\n\nCook the Onion, Garlic, and Paprika. Toss the onion and garlic in the same pot, and cook down until the onions are translucent. Then add the paprika and cook it for just a minute to release the flavor.\n\nAdd the Broth and Simmer the Beef. Add the beef back to the pot, and pour in the beef broth, making sure to cover the beef fully. Simmer for about one hour or until the beef is nice and tender.\n\nAdd the Veggies. Add your potatoes, carrots, and green beans to the stew, and cook for 30 minutes longer. Follow that with the tomatoes, and last, the peas and dried herbs.\n\nEnjoy! Once everything is tender, taste for seasonings, and then stir in the parsley. Serve hot, with whatever sides you love.\n\nTips for Successful Mulligan Stew\n\nLayer Those Flavors: Start by browning your meat (beef, lamb, or poultry) in batches to develop rich flavors. Searing the meat creates a savory base for the stew.\n\nDeglaze the Pot: After sautéing the aromatics, deglaze the pot with broth, wine, or beer. Scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot for added depth.\n\nUse a Variety of Veggies: Select a variety of vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, peas, corn, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Consider what’s in season or what you have on hand.\n\nServing Suggestions\n\nYou can serve any side dishes you like with this beef stew. I recommend something that will soak up the rich, flavorful broth. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\nCornbread: Dunk it or crumble it right into your bowl. Either way, you’ll love this sweet, honey-topped Homemade Cornbread Recipe, served with hot Mulligan stew.\n\nCrescent Rolls: Make a double-batch of these, and freeze some for later – trust me, they’re worth it. Flaky Homemade Crescent Rolls (aka butterhorn rolls) are totally irresistible.\n\nSalad: If you’d like something a little less carb-laden, try serving a side salad with your stew. A colorful garden salad would be great, or you could make this Cucumber Salad with Sour Cream Dressing for a creamy, zesty, simple dish.\n\nHow to Store and Reheat Leftovers\n\nLike many soups and stews, this one is even better when you reheat it the next day. To store, transfer the stew to an airtight container and keep it in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. When you’re ready to serve the stew again, simply reheat it on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of broth if the stew is too thick.\n\nTo freeze Mulligan stew, you can portion it out into freezer-safe containers (leaving a little space for expansion) and keep it in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge before reheating on the stove.\n\nMulligan Stew\n\nIt's time to cozy up with a bowl of pure comfort with this Mulligan Stew!
