        "text": "I made this for our St. Patrick’s Day dinner. It took 2 hours to cook. I used our own stew meat, but unfortunately this time of year we have to purchase carrots, potatoes, and onion. Surprisingly there are no spices in this recipes. I did add salt and pepper at the end. Here it is in the bowl:\n\nIt was good, much like any beef stew. One difference is using stewed tomatoes. The other is the red wine.\n\nI found a bizarre photo of Von’s restaurant at https://content.lib.washington.edu/ There is a good story about John G. von Herberg at http://www.historylink.org/ Per the Roosevelt Hotel web site “(Please note that the restaurant and lounge is currently closed for renovations) Providing its dining guests with delicious cuisine and fantastic service for well over a century, Von’s RoastHouse & Martini Manhattan Memorial is located off the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel, and specializes in offering ten different, freshly roasted meats daily – including prime rib, salmon, chicken, pork, and much more. The atmosphere is fun and casual, and if you’re in a pinch for time, there’s a special lunch menu that guarantees to have your meal on your table within ten minutes of it being ordered or it’s free. Popular for its Happy Hour and having the largest collection of spirits in the city with over 800 bottles, enjoy watching them spin a giant wheel that decides what the drink specials will be for the next thirty minutes. Von’s serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, and room service is available from 7:30 am – 10 pm.” I think I will need to go there if it re-opens.\n\nPer http://wikipedia.org/ Mulligan stew is an American hobo dish likely influenced by Irish-Americans. So it is not exactly Irish, but close enough for this Scotch-Irish-Swedish-British-German-Welsh-American gal.\n\nHappy St. Patrick’s Day!"
