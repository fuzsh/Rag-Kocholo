        "text": "hello\n\nTwo Words\n\nTOM COCHRANE\n\nIn the spectrum of popular music in Canada, which is as wide as the country, Tom Cochrane falls somewhere between an electrified Gordon Lightfoot and a solo Gordon Downie.\n\nBetween the universal prose of Leonard Cohen and the blood passion of Tom Wilson.\n\nThree times we went to the war torn fields and roads of Africa for World Vision and became life long friends. That’s what seeing men, woman and children dead or dying will do to you. You seek humanity. Tom’s got humanity in spades.\n\nHe came back from the first trip under a heavy dark load and sought out the only thing that he knew would lift him up. Music. He wrote a song called Life is a Highway. It became an anthem for millions. All lifted up by his music.\n\nTom Cochrane is heading back West now. The tour is called Duo.\n\nFriday night in Medicine hat, Saturday night in Edmonton (Expo Centre)\n\nThen to the coast and a complete tour of Vancouver Island.\n\nWednesday Victoria\n\nThursday Courtney\n\nFriday Nanaimo\n\nSunday Campbell River\n\nMonday Nov 20 – Duncan (in the Cowichan)\n\nwww.tomcochrane.com\n\nTom guests on Mulligan Stew Saturday night 5-7 CKUA Radio – streamed and CKUA App.\n\nThe complete interview drops after radio show on Mulligan Stew Podcast and the video version of the epic chat on TDM YouTube Channel\n\nNEXT week\n\nThe Trans Canada Highwaymen\n\nWell, two of them anyway\n\nSteven Page (BNL/Trio) and Chris Murphy (Sloan)\n\nhello\n\nBarney Bentall is a quick 2-3 minutes. Tom Wilson is slightly longer. (As befitting a member of the Order of Canada.)\n\nBoth have dates in Calgary and Edmonton over the next couple of weeks.\n\nTom with a trio including his son Thompson.\n\nBarney is touring with Cariboo Express. (18-19 years now)\n\nRaising funds this time for\n\nClassroom Champions\n\nAnd CASA Mental Health\n\nThey’ve raised over 5 million dollars. A lot of it is for food banks who are hit hard heading into year-end.\n\nCariboo Express includes\n\nMatt Masters\n\nDustin Bentall\n\nRidley Bent\n\nGeoffrey Kelly -spirit/west\n\nSimon Kendall – Doug/Slugs\n\nAlmost 15 members in total.\n\nEvery show has a surprise guest. (In Calgary it’s William Prince)\n\nBuffy’s documentary Carry It On has been nominated for an International Emmy Award. Only one from Canada. She’s stopped touring. Reflects on her life shown on screen and surprisingly what was left out. Awards Nov 20.\n\nSusan Tedeschi has rereleased her 25-year-old second solo album Just Won’t Burn.\n\nShe remembers that back then there were really only two female solo artists trying to break through in the blues. She and Bonnie Raitt.\n\nThe album includes original tracks, outtakes and newer versions of original songs done live by Tedeschi Trucks Band. She was also awarded recognition from the Smithsonian Institute.\n\nThe complete interviews with Buffy and Tom will be found on Mulligan Stew Podcast and the TerryDavidMulligan YouTube Channel\n\nThank you\n\nPLAYLIST:\n\nMulligan Stew – Four Guests Buffy.

The video version on the TDM YouTube\n\nThere’s a second guest on this week’s Stew. A brief visit with Anna McGarrigle (from the much-loved duo Kate and Anna McGarrigle)\n\nIn 1975 Anna wrote an amazing song called Complainte Pour Ste Catherine.. Initially as a B side for a single about Henri Richard and the Habs.\n\nIt was then rerecorded for their first self-titled album and became one of those rare songs that just stays with the listener no matter what age. It also became a hit.\n\nIt’s now the centrepiece for a National Film Board animated short The Girl in the Red Beret.\n\nNot so much about Ste. Catherine Street in Montreal but underneath it in the subway.\n\nThe song is sung by Kate’s daughter Martha Wainwright and Anna’s daughter Lily Lanken.\n\nThe screenings take place on Tuesday, Sept 26 at the Edmonton International Film Festival and Sunday the 24th at Calgary International Film Festival.\n\nIn Edmonton Sept 26 : Muttart Theatre at the Stanley Milner at 12:10 (Lunchbox series)\n\nIn Calgary Sunday 4 PM at Eau Claire 1(Radiant Jewels Shorts)\n\nDetails at\n\nEIFF Edmonton program: LUNCHBOX Shorts 2.0 – Tuesday, September 26, 2023, at 12:10 PM MDT\n\nhttps://eiff2023.eventive.org/schedule/64da65d780b360006ac12f5a\n\nNew: CIFF Calgary 2023 program: Shorts: Radiant Jewels: Tue, Sep 26th, 7:00 PM @ Eau Claire 4https://ciff2023.eventive.org/films/64e3e3203bb86e005f95ba1e\n\nA longer version of the Anna McGarrigle interview will run on a future Stew and Podcast.\n\nWe’ll celebrate the birthdays of Ray Charles and Bruce Springsteen\n\nWe’ll remember Bob Marley’s last concert.

Landreth. If Ariel is playing beside Joey Landreth and more than holding his own, you know he is good)\n\nHe began his career quietly showcasing new guitars online for the companies making them.\n\nHe had no idea the effect he was having on the guitar and music fans of the world, especially in Europe.\n\nSo. when he finally decided to start his solo career and released his first album How Long (2019) Ariel was gobsmacked to find a ready and willing audience in Europe and across Canada, then in the USA.\n\nThen came Headway, Mile End, Mile End 2, Familiar Ground, the Downtown EP and just now Reasons Why.\n\nHe’s touring Canada\n\nSept 26th in Calgary\n\nSept 27 in Edmonton\n\nSept 28 in Saskatoon\n\nSept 29 Winnipeg (home town)\n\nBUT FIRST – On Sept 23 he performs at the 2023 Eric Clapton Crossroads Festival in LA.\n\nAlso invited by Eric are The Bros.

We talked Art Bergmann and his next album.\n\nWhat brings you here? Says I\n\nPlaying with Jill Barber. Says Russ\n\nAnd that’s how Jill and I ended up sharing a freshly poured Big Rock and a wonderful interview in the green room.\n\nJill covers thoughts and emotions on her home and Homemaker, her latest album.\n\nThis Summer Stew starts and ends with Bob Dylan and his album Rough and Rowdy Ways. He’s just announced an R & R Ways tour. It includes two nights at Massey Hall Oct 26/27 with the next night in Montreal.\n\nNew Music from Mike Farris/Dolly Parton (with Paul and Ringo), Eric Clapton, Valerie June and Bill Frisell, Jesse Roper, Robert Finley, and Iris Dement.\n\nThe complete interview – over a cold beer – starts a two-part Mulligan Stew Podcast.\n\nFYI. Tasting Room Radio is an hour special with winemakers and locals on the fires that raged through the hills of West Kelowna.\n\nIt ends with a message that they’re “open for business”. Farming is tough enough. To have roads closed during the high tourist season is hard to survive.\n\nHow can we help?\n\nIf you’re buying wine soon please buy BC from your favorite winery. It all helps.\n\nSpeaking of the recent wine country fires, the interviews we did with locals and winemaking friends for Tasting Room Radio will be Part Two of this week’s Mulligan Stew Podcast\n\nBuy Local.
