        "text": "Preface\n\nby Francis Edward Abernethy\n\nIn which the editor justifies the title of this publication with a learned discussion of sonovaguns, jambalayas, mulligans, and slumgullions—among other things.\n\nOnce upon a time up in Panola County we made one sonovabitch of a stew—which I shall politely refer to hereafter as a sonovagun stew. Some kinfolks of Alfred Jernigan's were having an all-day squirrel hunt and sonovagun stew on their place on the Sabine River. The family had an old shed roof of a camp on the river bank where they gathered to fish, hunt, play dominoes, or drink, according to the season. They had an assortment of tables and chairs and cooking equipment, an iron skillet and a blue enamel coffee pot and a syrup bucket of forks and spoons. A container of grease, another of com meal, and salt-and-pepper shakers in an orange-crate shelf showed that they were prepared to cook a squirrel or catfish on an instant. And in the middle of the campground—on this cool clean October day before the world got so crowded—squatted a smoked-black, cast-iron wash pot, one foot gone, just waiting to boil a missionary, make lye soap, or host a very large stew.\n\nThree of us splash-banged down an old logging road in Alfred's ’39 Chevy, dodging stumps and praying through mudholes and finally got to the camp. A half-a-dozen men—as compared to us early-twenties boys—were sitting around a fire. Two were cleaning squirrels; two others were telling them how; two were refereeing the operation. Alfred, who was younger than Hubert and I but acted older, introduced us around and gave us a couple of beers out of an iced washtub to show that he was one of the official hosts. We stood around awhile until we got Alfred settled down by the campfire; then we got off to the woods.\n\nWe had a good hunt. There was a lot of mast that year, and the leaves had fallen enough that you could see to get a shot. We hunted along the road—Hubert on one side, I on the other—so we wouldn't wander off in the wrong direction and then whistled each other in about dark. It was good dark by the time we got back, and the camp was settled down in another dimension, ringed by trees, in firelight and long shadows, with voices bouncing out into the darkness. They had set the wash pot on the fire and had it cradled in rocks so it wouldn't tip over. An old pickup and a jeep had arrived with more Jernigans, and everybody was laughing and talking and doing things to the pot.\n\nWe skinned our squirrels and quartered them and tossed them in the pot. The stock was already boiling and squirrel parts were cooking tender. Somebody had tossed in some young cat squirrels, heads and tails, and they periodically rolled to the surface to see what was coming next. A young coon and a rabbit were added to the pot, and some uncle threatened the stew with an armadillo that was snuffling around in the brush just outside the firelight.\n\nWhen the meat started coming off the bones, the cooks—everybody there—added carrots, potatoes, onions, and God knows what else, canned or cut. One old man kept seasoning the broth with cigar ashes. Other creative souls contributed splashes of beer, whiskey, and coffee “to add character,” they said, to the mixture. I heard somebody say, “Dammit, Casey, quit spittin’ in that pot” I'm sure he was just joking with those of us who were new to the tradition.\n\nI was starving to the point of eating my hat and gloves when the head cook forked into a piece of meat and finally announced that the stew was ready. We all lined up with a variety of bowls, cups, and coffee cans while the cook ladled it out. It didn't look like the stew you have around the house, probably because there was so much of it, but it smelled about the same, maybe a little stronger. Hubert and I looked over at each other when we sat down to eat, wondering how much of a new experience our stomachs would stand. Alfred was already slurping away as if he had washpot sonovagun at every meal. We might have hesitated but the moment was short, and we ate with hunger whetted appetites. My God, but that was a good stew! I don't know how to describe how good that stew was except to say that that stew took place about forty years ago and I can still savor it on tongue and palate. Everybody was eating and carrying on about how good it was, and the whole scene was like a communion, with people sitting on the edge of the firelight, with stars sparkling on the blue-black sky and owls six-feet tall hoo-haing across the river at each other.\n\nWe ate all of it before we got through. In the final stages we were dipping soup and straining the pot for any animal parts that might have escaped the earlier ladlings—and wishing like hell that we had put in the armadillo.\n\nThat sonovagun does not square with recipes and descriptions I've encountered of West Texas chuckwagon sonovagun stew—which uses every part of a fat calf except his hide, horns, and hooves—but it is built on the same principle. And this use of whatever is edible and handy is the common denominator of a long standing, traditional run of stews.\n\nThe French folks over in Louisiana have their version of a sonovagun, which they call a jambalaya and which I once encountered under interesting circumstances.\n\nRight after I got out of the Navy in ’46 I worked a short haul on the Forty Fathom, a shrimp boat out of Morgan City, Louisiana. I washed dishes, hosed and swabbed the deck, and headed shrimp for what little pay I got—enough, by the way, to buy my first guitar, a second-hand Stella. The cook was one of Justin Wilson's “smart Cajuns from New Roads,” who had recently gotten control of the word perceive and used it every time he should have said see. In spite of which, he could cook fish more ways and better than any I have tasted since. We had trout, pompano, and snapper and once dragged the try net over an oyster reef and nearly foundered eating raw oysters dipped in some kind of pink sauce he concocted.\n\nWe were lying off the mouth of the Atchafalaya one evening when the cook decided he wanted to fry up some venison backstrap. He got his headlight and an old beat-up .30-30, and in the black dark we rowed a pirogue over the flat swells and then through the nastiest mess of water hyacinths that a family of cotton-mouth moccasins ever bedded down in. The cook “perceived” a pair of deer eyes shining back at him in the dark and stepped out of the pirogue on what he thought was true ground. He immediately sank through floating slush to his armpits. We went back to the Forty Fathom, hosed him off, and had beer and boiled shrimp.\n\nWe always had boiled shrimp on hand. The cook boiled it in an old bucket, and the sweet time of the day was when we sat on the fantail in the evening drinking a beer and grazing on boiled shrimp. Now I remember that! And I remember his jambalaya, which was just a Cajun sonovagun. His jambalaya was darker than Texas sonovagun and thicker because he added rice sometime during the cooking process. He was very casual about his cooking and put into the jambalaya whatever meats were handy—ham, spam, whatever—but shrimp and chicken (there seemed to be a lot of wings) dominated the completed dish. He served it in big bowls with hard-crusted bread, and we sat on the bitts and ate like we were having dinner at Antoine's.\n\nThe following summer I sailed out of Ketchikan on the Pride of Juneau, a salmon boat, as cook and seine hauler, and I became acquainted with a salmon mulligan, an Alaskan sonovagun. I wasn't much of a cook, but the three-man crew would have put up with Filthy McNasty himself not to have to cook, wash dishes, and keep the galley clean. The Pride was thirty-six feet long, and the galley was in the forward part of the cabin, which also held our sleeping quarters. The stove was a simple device, and heat was maintained by firing diesel oil that dripped on a pair of porous bricks. Once in the Gulf of Alaska in the iceberg water below the Bering Glacier, I wide-opened the diesel petcock to get the stove heated in a hurry, then forgot all about it during the flouring of breaded veal cutlets and some lurid fantasizing about my sweetheart back in Texas. I came back to the real world which included a cherry-red-hot stove and paint smoking and bubbling on the bulkhead. Rocky was dousing water on the outside, and the skipper (whom we appropriately called “Bligh”) was cursing and flinging flour in on the fire and trying to shut off the still dripping valve. I remained in a conscious but suspended state and continued to automatically flour the veal cutlets during the commotion. After things settled down I was bothered more by my reaction to the incident than I was by the mistake I made—or the fine cussing I got from the skipper.\n\nAs a cook I couldn't have gotten anything but better, and the crew was satisfied with the chow, instructing me regularly on what to cook and how to do it. One memorable dish was fresh sardines, fried crisp and eaten whole—lips, livers, and lights. I did various things to fresh salmon and regularly fixed what the crew called a salmon mulligan. It was another version of a sonovagun. I boiled the salmon with potatoes and at the critical time put in whatever canned goods we had in the food locker—com, peas, carrots, tomatoes. I remember those mulligans fondly and wonder sometimes if a salmon mulligan would taste as good now as it did during those salad days on the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nIn my early wanderings I encountered another type of sonovagun, called a slumgullion, but knew it only by reputation. I was on the road and stopped one night to enjoy the hospitality of the Salvation Army in Jacksonville, Florida. The sleeping quarters was a large barn-like room over the mission, with double-deck bunks, barracks style, and I sociably bedded down near two old drifters. I think as much for my benefit as for memory's sake they talked long into the night about their adventures on the road, hopping freights, outsmarting the bulls, just getting by during the hard-times Thirties.\n\nMost of their energies during those Depression years were spent getting food, and times happened when they welcomed a vagrancy charge just to get something to eat and a warm night's sleep. During the good times when the weather was tolerable and the skies were dry, they and their fellow knights would camp at a hobo jungle on the edge of a town, usually near a railroad track, and have a slumgullion. In preparation for the event all would sally forth in search of ingredients. They wandered alleys, both residential and commercial, looking through garbage cans for vegetables in any state of use. They raided gardens, and they stole where possible, at night gently lifting a chicken off its roost and tucking its head under its wing to prevent an outcry. If they were successful panhandling on the steets, they bought a little stew meat. Some preferred door-to-door bumming, knowing that many a Christian housewife wouldn't deny them a handout for fear of “turning away an angel, unaware.” At day's end the collection of foods was pooled and a great slumgullion was cooked to the delight and gustatory satisfaction of all the denizens of the jungle. The two old souls reminisced happily about the good old days, before the demands of World War II had forced them into an assortment of jobs and a rash of insensitive bosses. I listened respectfully, agreed that it was bad to have to work for the likes of those who were always put in charge, and honestly wished I could have sat in with them when they had made a real slumgullion.\n\nAll this reminiscing sounds as if I'm setting myself up as the galloping gourmet of the stewpot, but that's not the case. I got to be a pretty good cook on the Pride, and I sharpened my skills during another year of bachelorhood, but I gave up cooking when I got married. I sure didn't intend to spoil what promised to be a real good wife by homing in on her kitchen duties.\n\nAnd I hope that readers will understand the significance of the title of this forty-sixth volume of the Society's publication. This is one of our traditional literary sonovaguns and the cook has put into it whatever was savory and on hand—everything but the horns, the hide, and the hooves. I hope that you enjoy partaking of it as much as I did the building of it.\n\nFor the tenth time since I became editor in 1971 I thank the Society members whose literary involvements in folklore have resulted in interesting, readable, publishable articles. You keep the Society alive.\n\nThe Texas Folklore Society thanks William R. Johnson, President of Stephen F. Austin State University, and Roy E. Cain, Chairman of the Department of English and Philosophy, for continuing financial and moral support. And I thank Marlene Adams, the Society's secretary, for holding off from having her baby until she got these manuscripts to the publisher.\n\nStephen F.
