If you did, take a tour down memory lane with Renee Montagne as she checks out a new National Archives exhibit called What's Cooking, Uncle Sam?\n\nYou might be surprised at how far we've come since vitamin-fortified doughnuts.\n\nWe also discuss the latest in caffeine delivery devices, as well as beverages that aim to make us sleepy â€” and what they actual do to our bodies, as well as a the high cost of drugs."
