        "text": "Also known as hamburger stew, hobo stew, mulligan stew, and beggar's stew, this delicious Crockpot Ground Beef Stew is great for fall and winter days. It's the ultimate wintertime comfort food!\n\nNeed more comforting dishes for a cold night? Try one of these Beefy Slow Cooker Recipes or this Hearty Chili.\n\nThis Ground Beef Stew is my absolute favorite dish for fall and winter. Just like my Perfect Hearty Chili, it offers the warmth and comfort you crave during colder seasons.\n\nI was raised by my grandma, and she used to make this hamburger stew on Sunday's while I was at church. I loved coming in the door from the crisp, cool day to a warm home filled with the smell of this Ground Beef Stew!\n\nPure comfort, Y'all!\n\n{This post may contain affiliate links.}\n\nAs flavorful, hearty, and delicious as this stew is, it's also super easy to make. You can make it in no time at all on the stove top. Or you can toss everything into the crockpot in the morning, and it's ready at lunch time. That's my kind of meal!\n\nThe one difference between my grandma's recipe and mine is that hers would have required several cups of broth. In my own recipe, I've cut the broth down to 1.5 cups, and substituted spicy vegetable juice.\n\nHow to make Crockpot Ground Beef Stew - Step by Step\n\nIn a skillet, brown the ground beef until done.\n\nAdd meat, potatoes, and veggies to the crock pot. Add the spices, vegetable or tomato juice, and broth. Cook on high for 4 hours or until veggies are tender.\n\nCan you freeze ground beef stew?\n\nYes, you can freeze ground beef stew. Be aware, though, freezing changes the texture of potatoes, making them soft and grainy. Also, stews thickened with flour or cornstarch may separate after freezing. So if you're planning to freeze the stew, wait until reheating to thicken it. At that time, you can also add cooked potatoes.\n\nStore stew in heavy plastic, airtight containers, leaving Â½- inch of space to allow for expansion in the freezer.\n\nStew can be kept frozen for up to 3 months.\n\nHow to thaw ground beef stew:\n\nCooked stew that has been thawed in the refrigerator can be kept for an additional 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator before reheating. Stew that was thawed in the microwave or in cold water should be eaten immediately.\n\nOnce reheated, any remaining should be thrown away.\n\nWhat to serve with Ground Beef Stew\n\nLoaded with veggies and meat, stew is pretty much a stand-alone meal. I usually serve with cornbread or saltines, but you could serve with French baguettes, a simple salad, or rice.\n\nVegetarian Stew Option:\n\nThere are several options for making this a vegetarian stew. First, replace the beef broth with vegetable broth. Then replace the beef with one of the following options, or come up with your own replacement.\n\nReplace the meat with seasoned jackfruit\n\nReplace the beef with meatless version of beef.\n\nUse portobello mushrooms in place of beef.\n\nIf you're looking for more recipes perfect for fall or winter:\n\n- Tex Mex Cheesy Beef and Bean Skillet\n\nBe sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest for more delicious recipes!\n\nWant to receive recipes in your inbox?"
