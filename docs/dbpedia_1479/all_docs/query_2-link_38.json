        "text": "There are some things that remind you of your upbringing. This particular event reminds me that I am a daughter of Little River County.\n\nOn Saturday, October 5th, our friends in Alleene are hosting a Mulligan Supper. How many of us know what a Mulligan Supper is, exactly? Well…a Mulligan is basically a squirrel stew. Our friends hunt and dress those bushy-tailed rascals in the trees in your yard, or theirs, or out in the woods, with their faithful ‘Squirrel Dog’. Really, the Squirrel Dog isn’t any different from any other hound, or critter that will tree and hopefully, retrieve the squirrel, without eating it. Sometimes that doesn’t always work out.\n\nBack to the Squirrel Mulligan, though. This is an annual event/get-together in Alleene. It’s been going on, as long as I can remember. In election years, the Squirrel Mulligan is an important stop, if one is ‘politicking’. I have no idea if attendance or non-attendance was a deal-maker or deal-breaker for those running for office, but it couldn’t have hurt.\n\nThe Squirrel Mulligan is from 5pm-7 pm, in the Alleene Community Center. Anyone age 12 and up, pays $7.00. Ages 6–12 pay $4.00. Any kiddos age 5 and under can eat free.\n\nOther than the actual mulligan, there might be other soups or foods. My friend Judy Rose didn’t say…but I am sure she knows.\n\nEven better than this true, rustic meal, is the dance afterward, from 8 pm–midnight. Charlie McBay, who was a piano player for Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, and is a member of the Texas Western Swing Hall of Fame, is bringing his band out to the Community Center. To hear traditional Country music, and dance the night away, is a mere $3.00 per person, or $5.00 per couple.\n\nOther than the great fall get-together, the proceeds from the evening go to the upkeep of the Alleene Community Center, and the Volunteer Fire Department. This group of family and friends creates a lot of fun, for a modest price.\n\nSo…I invite you to do something that is a throwback to our youth (well, some of us, anyway). For the rest, you are cordially invited to get off your phone, your computer, from in front of your TV, and go to the center of Little River County Arkansas. This is definitely a County Time Machine."
