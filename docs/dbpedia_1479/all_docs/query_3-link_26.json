        "text": "A few years ago I heard a song by Ma rk Knopfler called “Old Pigweed” from his album (CD) “The Ragpicker’s Dream” As I learned the song, I began to relate to it. No, it related to me, to life and living, succeeding and screwing up and forgiving and being forgiven, averting wars and striving for peace and most of all finding the fulfillment that God desires that we experience in this life. But then there’s the damned pigweed and that wretched person who put the toxic and foul tasting weed in what would have been a great tasting stew, even a masterpiece. Sometimes the “who” that put the pigweed in the Mulligan Stew is a dysfunctional train wreck who can’t help themselves. Sometimes it’s even a mean spirited, hateful, spiteful perverted troll who does it because they have no heart, no soul or no conscience. And sometimes it’s me….or is it you?\n\nMulligan Stew used to be the standard fare of hobos during the heyday of the hobos in America. However, it is uniquely Irish. It is the comfort food, the staple, like a hot bowl of chili or chicken and dumplings. It makes you feel better, even good on an otherwise miserable day. “All you needed was a pot, a fire and water” plus the ingredients. The basic recipe is laid out in the lyrics to the song. Of course, metaphorically some added ingredients, blessings from above and love, kindness and forgiveness are essential if you can liken the song to life, living, loving and relationships between we, at times, wretched humans.\n\nMulligan Stew? No it’s not the singular events in your life like a luxury cruise, a sudden rise to fame, being queen for a day or a catapulting career even. These are temporal. They come and go. They don’t make your life and they don’t break or handicap you when they don’t pan out like you had hoped they would.\n\nI liken the metaphor to those vital things in life you hope, rather you expect will be a crowning achievement, will fulfill your life and bring you full circle at the end of the day when you sit on the porch with your wife and sip a little whiskey, smoke some Virginia tobacco in a huge Calabash and listen to the peeper frogs and the crickets. Then as the night cools, you say to yourself “Yes God, I feel good. I’m at peace. We got through it with your help and we succeeded.\n\nYour kids and your relationship with them as they grow up to do their thing, your marriage and your relationship to your wife or husband, your brothers and sisters, you parents, coworkers and supervisors, the people you worship with: these are your Mulligan Stews. You will sacrifice anything and never be satisfied with mediocrity. You will fight for these relationships, especially those with your spouse and your children. You will lower expectations and even standards to maintain peace when need be and then you will circumspectly fight with yourself for caving when you should have stuck to your guns, or for sticking to your guns when you could have given a little. And you pray that you don’t become another statistic, that “till death do you part” is a reality and not a hope, that your children admire you after your gone rather than wish they had gotten their two cents in before you kicked off.\n\nBut for all of your striving to create that remarkable Mulligan Stew you can take pride in, there must be the person who either unintentionally or deliberately taints the mingling of flavors with the toxic Pigweed. You can count on it. We are human and incredibly flawed. Therefore Pigweed happens. But then there are those toxic people who live for it. They harvest and horde it, keeping it in their front pocket looking for any and every opportunity to drop it in the pot. They even flaunt it, daring you to stop them.\n\nAnd yet, there apparently is always a way to redeem the stew, (or as the poet says “Brotherhood of man”) through understanding, wisdom, forgiveness, grace and mercy.\n\nThis will be most of the theme of this blog as time goes on. As you read the words to the song, I hope you can see the metaphors and the allegory in the meaning."
