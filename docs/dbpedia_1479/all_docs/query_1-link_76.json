        "text": "Hobo stew is a recipe straight from my time as a YMCA camp counselor. It can be cooked on the fire pit in your backyard or at a campsite.\n\nWhat Is Hobo Stew\n\nHobo Stew is my all-time favorite camping recipe. I learned about it while I was a camp counselor at YMCA’s Camp Piomingo in Kentucky. It’s a great dish to prepare with your kids on a camping trip or in your backyard fire pit.\n\nAs counselors, we would pack up all of the pre-chopped ingredients along with lots of foil. Then we hiked out to an elevated ridge near the Ohio River for an under-the-stars adventure buffet and campfire tales.\n\nThe campers would each grab a piece of foil, and they would travel down the line of counselors who each had an ingredient. Everyone started with ground beef. Then, they could add their veggies of choice.\n\nThe mound of ingredients was usually topped with a slice of American cheese and a few squirts of ketchup or mustard.\n\nThe kids would fold the foil over their ingredients to make a ball, add their initials on their pouch using a marker, and then, they’d find the perfect spot on the fire to start cooking their campfire entrée.\n\nCampers had such pride in their creations.\n\nI hadn’t made Hobo Stew in almost 20 years. When my husband and I decided to go camping a few weeks ago, I had to introduce him to it.\n\nPacking for 2 was a lot easier than packing for 50. I just packed up a few containers of ground beef and chopped veggies. This time, I added some more adult flavors, including minced garlic, jalapenos and some of my favorite seasonings.\n\nIt was a true treat. I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to make this again. It will become a regular fire pit meal this fall.\n\nGround Meat: Ground beef is the most popular meat in hobo stew, but you can also use ground pork or ground chicken.\n\nVegetables: The most popular veggies used include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, peppers and carrots. If you like a little heat, add jalapeños.\n\nCheese: Any melty cheese will work.\n\nCondiments: We always use ketchup and mustard and sometimes mayonnaise.\n\nSeasonings: Plan to have salt and pepper handy, but you can also use garlic powder, onion powder or pre-made seasonings and rubs.\n\nSubstitutions: This dish is all about substitutions, because everyone builds their own packet.\n\nSTEP ONE: Start your campfire in a safe campfire ring or fire pit with charcoal or logs. Let it burn, until the coals start to ash over and the flames subside.\n\nSTEP TWO: On the picnic table, lay out two sheets of foil stacked on top of each other and shape that into a bowl. The easiest way to do this is to place a bowl upside down and then lay the foil right on top. Press it down. Gently remove the foil and flip it over so you have a foil bowl.\n\nSTEP THREE: Start layering in your ingredients. Start with the meat. Then, add the vegetables, condiments and seasonings. You can give it a little stir, but you don’t have to.\n\nSTEP FOUR: Add a slice of cheese right on top and fold it close, trying not to press down too hard toward the cheese, otherwise it can stick. Write your initials on the foil packet so you know whose is whose.\n\nSTEP FIVE: Place the foil pouch onto the hot coals and cook for 30-60 minutes. I like to use long tongs to rotate the packets occasionally.\n\nEXPERT TIP: Hobo stew made with potatoes can take about an hour to cook, depending on how you slice the potatoes. Slices cook faster than cubes. If you leave out the potatoes, dinner is ready in about 30 minutes.\n\nHow to serve hobo stew\n\nAfter about 30 minutes, start checking the hobo stew by carefully opening the pouch and piercing the harder vegetables like potatoes and carrots with a fork. Once they are tender, use heat gloves or long tongs to remove the pouch from the coals.\n\nThe pouch will be very hot, so be mindful of what surface you set it on. Putting it on a plastic picnic tablecloth is a bad idea.\n\nOnce it’s had a bit of time to cool, open the foil and dig in with a fork. You can add more seasonings if you feel like it needs it.\n\nStorage\n\nBecause this dish is made to order, you can make it as big or as small as you’d like. So you shouldn’t have any leftover hobo stew. However, you may have leftover raw ingredients.\n\nIf you do, be sure to keep them refrigerated or in a cooler that’s lower than 40F degrees. Then, you can make another batch on a later night of your camping trip."
