        "text": "The Digital Research Library of Illinois History Journal™ was created to help 6th through 12th-grade public and private school students in Illinois find a topic for their Chicago Metro History Day and Illinois History Day projects.\n\nThis blog is a free, not-for-profit resource that is not academically funded. The compiled data in the articles are not subject to copyright unless otherwise stated.\n\nInstead of relying on pre-digested references and citations, these journal articles empower students to become independent researchers. It also encourages students to learn and engage in the vital skills of source exploration and evaluation, develop critical thinking skills, confidence in their research abilities, and a deeper understanding of the topic. This hands-on approach lays a strong foundation for future academic success, preparing students to navigate the information landscape and essential skills for academic success and beyond. Ultimately, the absence of references in this journal is not a void but an opportunity. It empowers students to become independent researchers, a valuable asset in today's digital dynamic knowledge ecosystem.\n\nMy passion for historical exploration spans from presenting my own project at the inaugural Chicago Metro History Fair in 1979 to judging at Illinois History Day in Springfield, Illinois, and exchanging ideas with university history professors from coast to coast.\n\nTeachers and educators widely advocate for using uncited history articles, similar to newspaper and magazine pieces, as a pedagogical tool to train students in independent research and accurate citation practices."
