        "text": "By Jenn Segal\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Read my full disclosure policy.\n\nCozy up with a bowl of Guinness-spiked lamb stew—each spoonful promises succulent meat, hearty broth, and pure comfort.\n\nSt. Patrick’s Day is the perfect occasion to indulge in some hearty Irish cooking. One of my favorites is this lamb stew, which is similar to my #1 most popular recipe, Beef Stew with Carrots and Potatoes, but with a distinctly Irish twist. It features tender, seared lamb that’s slowly cooked in a broth enriched with Guinness, giving it a unique, malty depth. Vegetables are added at just the right moment, ensuring they remain vibrant and tender-crisp. Paired with my Cheddar soda bread, this lamb stew makes a hearty and comforting meal that’s perfect for celebrating St. Patrick’s Day or for warming up any day.\n\n“Delicious! I doubled the recipe and made it for a crowd of friends all from Ireland the weekend before St Patrick’s Day…No leftovers, unfortunately!!”\n\nCatríona\n\nWhat You’ll Need To Make Lamb Stew With Vegetables\n\nLamb Shoulder: This is the main protein and flavor base of your stew. It’s rich in flavor and becomes fork-tender when cooked slowly over low heat.\n\nOnions and Garlic: These aromatics add depth and a foundation of flavor, creating a savory backdrop for the stew.\n\nTomato Paste: Concentrated tomato paste adds umami, richness, and a slight acidity that enhances the overall taste and color of the stew.\n\nFlour: Used to thicken the stew, giving it a hearty and satisfying texture.\n\nGuinness: Adds a unique, malty depth and a hint of bitterness that complements the lamb beautifully.\n\nBeef Broth: Provides the liquid base for the stew, contributing to its richness and depth of flavor.\n\nBay Leaf and Fresh Rosemary: These herbs infuse the stew with aromatic and earthy notes.\n\nCarrots and Baby Yukon Potatoes: These vegetables add sweetness, texture, and nutritional value, making the stew more filling and balanced.\n\nPeas: Added towards the end of cooking, peas provide a pop of color, sweetness, and freshness to contrast the rich and savory flavors of the stew.\n\nJump to the printable recipe for precise measurements\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\n\nPat the lamb dry and season with salt and pepper.\n\nIn a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat one tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Brown the lamb in three batches, adding one more tablespoon of oil for each batch. Do not crowd the pan and let the meat develop a brown crust before turning with tongs. It should take 5-8 minutes per batch.\n\nTransfer the browned meat to large bowl and set aside.\n\nAdd the onions, garlic and 2 tablespoons of water to the pot.\n\nCook until the onions are soft, stirring with a wooden spoon to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of pan, about 5 minutes. The add the tomato paste.\n\nCook a few minutes more.\n\nAdd the lamb with its juices back to the pan and sprinkle with flour.\n\nStir with a wooden spoon until the flour is completely mixed in, 1to 2 minutes. Add the Guinness, beef broth, water, bay leaf, rosemary sprig and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the pan and bring to a boil.\n\nCover the pot with a lid, turn the heat down to low and simmer for one hour and twenty minutes. Add the carrots and potatoes to the stew.\n\nCover and continue simmering until the vegetables are cooked and the meat is very tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and rosemary sprig, and then taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. If serving right away, add the frozen peas and cook until the peas are warmed through.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan lamb stew be made ahead?\n\nDefinitely! Lamb stew can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and reheated gently on the stovetop. Just be sure to add the peas right before serving so they stay fresh. The broth may thicken in the fridge, so thin it with a bit of water or beef broth when reheating, if necessary.\n\nCan lamb stew be frozen?\n\nYes, the stew can be frozen for up to 3 months. However, leave out the potatoes, if possible, as they do not freeze well. When ready to serve, you can cook some potatoes separately and then either mix them into the stew or serve them alongside it.\n\nWhat’s the ideal cut of lamb for making stew?\n\nLamb shoulder is the best choice. Avoid using leg of lamb since it’s better suited for roasting or grilling and doesn’t become tender in stew. Ask your butcher to remove as much excess fat as possible, or trim it yourself at home. I\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nLamb Stew with Vegetables\n\nCozy up with a bowl of Guinness-spiked lamb stew—each spoonful promises succulent meat, hearty broth, and pure comfort.\n\nIngredients\n\n3 pounds lamb shoulder, well-trimmed and cut into 1½-inch pieces\n\n2 teaspoons salt\n\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n3 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil\n\n2 medium yellow onions, cut into 1½-inch\n\n6 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed\n\n3 tablespoons tomato paste\n\n¼ cup all-purpose flour\n\n1 cup Guinness\n\n3 cups beef broth\n\n2 cups water, plus 2 tablespoons more for cooking onions and garlic\n\n1 bay leaf\n\n1 small sprig fresh rosemary\n\n2 teaspoons sugar\n\n4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks on diagonal\n\n1 pound small white boiling potatoes (baby yukons), cut in half\n\n1 cup frozen green peas\n\nInstructions\n\nPat the lamb dry and season with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat one tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Brown the lamb in three batches, adding one more tablespoon of oil for each batch. Do not crowd the pan and let the meat develop a brown crust before turning with tongs. It should take 5-8 minutes per batch. Transfer the browned meat to large bowl and set aside.\n\nAdd the onions, garlic and 2 tablespoons of water to the pot. Cook until the onions are soft, stirring with a wooden spoon to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of pan, about 5 minutes.\n\nStir in the tomato paste and cook a few minutes more.\n\nAdd the lamb with its juices back to the pan and sprinkle with flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until the flour is completely mixed in, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nAdd the Guinness, beef broth, water, bay leaf, rosemary sprig and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the pan and bring to a boil. Cover the pot with a lid, turn the heat down to low and simmer for one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nAdd the carrots and potatoes to the stew, then cover and continue simmering until the vegetables are cooked and the meat is very tender, 30-40 minutes. (Be sure to stir a few times to prevent vegetables from sticking to bottom.)\n\nRemove the bay leaf and rosemary sprig, and then taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. If serving right away, add the frozen peas and cook until the peas are warmed through. Otherwise, let the stew cool, then cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Reheat gently on the stovetop and add the peas right before serving.\n\nMake Ahead: This stew can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in a covered container in the refrigerator. Wait to add the peas until right before serving so they maintain their freshness and vibrant green color. Reheat the stew gently on the stovetop. The stew may thicken in the fridge, so add a bit of water or broth if necessary when reheating.\n\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions: The stew can be frozen for up to 3 months. However, leave out the potatoes, if possible, as they do not freeze well. When ready to serve, you can cook some potatoes separately and then either mix them into the stew or serve them alongside it.\n\nPair with\n\nNutrition Information\n\nPowered by\n\nPer serving (6 servings)\n\nCalories: 789\n\nFat: 52g\n\nSaturated fat: 20g\n\nCarbohydrates: 36g\n\nSugar: 9g\n\nFiber: 6g\n\nProtein: 42g\n\nSodium: 1242mg\n\nCholesterol: 150mg\n\nThis website is written and produced for informational purposes only.
