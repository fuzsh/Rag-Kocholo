Bring all the best ingredients together in one, steamy pot with this Mulligan Stew! Often thought of as a St. Paddy’s Day entrée, Mulligan Stew was meant for improvising, so throw whatever you’ve got in the pot with the brisket, potatoes and green beans. With such great foundational flavors coming from the garlic, bay leaves, onions, and thyme, you can’t go wrong! This recipe features a bit of stout beer, if you have it, to really up the Irish ante.

Ingredients:

2 pounds brisket, cut into 1-inch pieces

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 medium yellow onion, chopped

2 large garlic cloves, minced

1 tablespoon tomato paste

4 cups chicken or beef stock

1 cup stout beer

1 bay leaf

1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

1 teaspoon sea salt

1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

2 medium carrots, peeled & cut into 1-inch pieces

3/4 pound Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces

Directions:

1 In a 6-quart stockpot, heat oil over medium heat. Add brisket and brown on all sides. Remove from pan and set aside.

2 Add onion and saute until tender, adding more oil as needed. Stir in tomato paste and garlic; cook for an additional minute.

3 Add stock, stout, bay leaf, thyme, salt, and pepper. Return brisket to the pot and bring to a simmer, cover, and reduce heat to low; continue to cook for 1 1/2 hours. Add potatoes and carrots; cook for an additional hour.

4 Add in green beans in the last 30 minutes. When brisket is fork tender, remove 1/4 pound green beans, cut into 1 inch pieces bay leaf. Adjust seasoning to taste and serve.
