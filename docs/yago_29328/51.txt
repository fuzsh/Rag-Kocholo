:"Bolesław (Boleslaus) IV of Poland redirects here. For a 15th century prince of Masovia, see Bolesław IV Warszawski."

Bolesław IV the Curly (Polish: "Bolesław Kędzierzawy"; 1120 &ndash; 1173) was High Duke of Poland from 1146 until his death.

He was the eldest surviving son of Bolesław III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, from his second marriage with Salome von Berg-Schelklingen, daughter of Henry, Duke of Berg.

When their father died, Boleslaus' elder half-brother Vladislaus the Exile, Duke of Silesia, succeeded him as the overlord of all Polish. Young Boleslaus received the quarter of Masovia and Kujavia as his own in the partition, whereby he became also known as Boleslaus of Masovia.

Younger half-brothers eventually drove Vladislaus to exile, and in 1146 Boleslaus thus became the technical overlord, and received the central principality of Cracow in addition to his own domains.

He married St. Vsevolod's daughter Wierzchoslawa, and had one surviving son, Leszek of Masovia (the elder son, another Boleslaus, having predeceased the father), who succeeded him in the Masovian-Kujavian principality at the age of eleven or less. As overlord and holder of Cracow and Gnoezno, he however was succeeded by his next brother Mieszko III the Old, duke of Greater Poland.
