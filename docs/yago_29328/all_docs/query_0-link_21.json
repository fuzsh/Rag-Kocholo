The core arguments of the authors have not been changed, but the explanation and development of certain problems have of necessity been altered to cater for a wider readership, whose members may not be familiar with the intricacies of Hungarian and, in a broader sense, Eastern European medieval history. The bibliography has been changed, to include studies both in EasternEuropean languages and in world languages. This shows how Hungarian and other Eastern European historians are increasingly publishing the results of their research in foreign languages, although these papers may not always be known to the Western scientific community. In addition, the number of citations has been reduced in order to make the text easier to read. Coloman, the main character of the book, it is important to recognize, is a significant figure in the historiography of several contemporary countries, which means that we as historians need to be aware of sensitivities around his heritage. His role in Galicia makes him interesting for Ukrainian and Russian historical researchers; his Polish wife has the same importance for Polish scholars, while his years in Scepus are of note for Slovak his­ torians and his role as the duke of Slavonia engages Croatian and Bosnian historians. But as a member of the Á� rpádian dynasty, Coloman’s life was organized and led by the rules of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and so we need to examine him carefully in the context of the kingdom of the Á� rpáds. So, while the authors utilized information found in the historiography of various countries, a secondary aim of this book has been to make available the results of recent Hungarian research, especially as this has previously been somewhat neglected internationally due to the language barrier. The fact that Coloman is a key historical figure in Russia and the Ukraine, Croatia and Bosnia, Poland and Slovakia, as well as Hungary today justifies this first monograph on Coloman in English. We hope that this work will resonate among scholars in our neigh­ bouring countries as well as among medievalists worldwide, and we hope that this pub­ lication draws more scholars into the fascinating world of medieval east-central Europe.\n\nIt is quite a challenge in the case of a study on Eastern European history written in English to handle the diverse spellings of toponyms and personal names in different versions in both historical sources and modern languages. The personal names and toponyms of Slavic languages using Cyrillic letters complicate this picture even further, especially because the rules are not the same regarding the English transcription of each language (Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and so on). One cannot rely exclusively on spelling in sources either, because the name of a single person can appear in different versions, not to speak of the difference between the languages of the sources (especially the medieval Eastern Slavic chronicles) and those used in today’s countries. Even when a set of rules exists for the transcription of Cyrillic in scientific publications, in practice one can find more than one version in historical works written in English. It seems clear to us that there is no single solution, which would not be open to criticism, which is why we have produced below a pragmatic table of alternatives and our preferred forms.\n\nx\n\nforeword\n\nWe have had to face other challenges beyond transcription and transliteration, par­ ticularly the usage of geographical and personal names in general. For toponyms for places which lay within the borders of the Medieval Kingdom of Hungary, generally Hun­ garian versions have been adopted, although their current names in other languages, if outside present-day Hungary, are also supplied at the first mention. Rivers are referred to in their English form (for instance, Danube, Vistula). Furthermore, the medieval practice regarding the names of certain territories is often inconsistent, and the size of some of the territories has changed over the course of time. In certain cases, the medieval term has been used (for instance, Scepus), but in other places a different approach has proved necessary. For instance, to distinguish between the medieval principality and the settlement, the term “Galicia” is used exclu­ sively for the principality, while “Halych” is used for the settlement, even though Eastern Slavic Chronicles did not make any distinction. The term “Poland” is also used, although the authors are aware of the fragmentation of the territory in the twelfth to thirteenth centuries. So, Poland refers in this study to a particular territory, not a single politi­ cal entity. We have also added nicknames for certain persons, to help identify people with the same forenames, even if in several cases they are not historically adequate, for instance Iaroslav “the Wise,” Mstislav “the Mute,” and so on. The book is in two parts. Part One focuses on Coloman’s life in the Principality of Galicia and on the circumstances and events leading up to his coronation and on his reign as a Hungarian royal prince in this Rus’ian principality. Part Two concentrates on his life and actions as duke of Slavonia, when he ruled the southern territories of the Realm of St. Stephen (medieval Hungary) at the grace of his father, Andrew II, and later his older brother, King Béla IV. The rationale for this division is that Coloman’s life falls into two separate phases. He became ruler of the Rus’ian principality of Galicia as a child as a result of his father’s political achievements and Hungarian expansion in the region, but after a few years he was forced to leave Galicia and move back to the Kingdom of Hungary. At this point a new phase of his life began. He became the duke of Slavonia in 1226 and consequently the second mightiest person in the kingdom, with power over several territories (Sla­ vonia, Croatia, Dalmatia) as well as Hungarian counties. The first part of the book has been written by Márta Font, the leading expert of Hungarian-Rus’ian relations in the early and central Middle Ages, who dicusses this period of Coloman’s life in its broader political context. The second part has been written by Gábor Barabás, whose research on Coloman has focused on papal-Hungarian contacts in the early thirteenth century, due to the duke having an especially good relationship with Pope Gregory IX. This book combines the fruit of their separate researches, providing new insights into both phases of Coloman’s life. The bibliography consists of a full list of primary sources and selected secondary lit­ erature. Where necessary, titles have been provided in English in square brackets. Short forms are provided in the footnotes where the full reference is in the bibliography. All other secondary material is cited in full in the footnotes. The authors would like to express their gratitude to Dániel Bagi, Tamás Fedeles, Gergely Kiss, Endre Sashalmi and their other colleagues in Pécs, as well as colleagues at\n\nforeword\n\nxi\n\nother universities and institutes in Hungary.

He was the second member in his dynasty with this name, the first being King Coloman the Learned (1095–1116). The man who would later become King of Galicia and Duke of Slavonia was born in 1208, the fourth child of Andrew II and Queen Gertrud of Andechs, making him a prince of the ruling Á� rpád dynasty.1 Coloman was barely six years old when he was engaged for marriage to Salomea, the daughter of Leszek the White (Biały), Duke of Kraków, as a result of an agreement in 1214 between their fathers over the Scepus region (Szepes, Spiš). Not long afterwards (it is disputed exactly when, as we shall see later) he was crowned king of a principality of the Kievan Rus’, Galicia (Halych), receiving the royal title with crucial papal approval and crown coming from Pope Innocent III (1198–1216). A few years later, probably in 1221, Coloman and his wife were forced to leave Gali­ cia, in today’s western Ukraine, and moved to Hungary, and settled down in the Scepus. Another few years passed by and he became the duke (dux) of the southern part of the medieval Hungarian Kingdom, Slavonia, in 1226, and retained his royal title, derived from his coronation in the Rus’ian principality of Galicia. As the ruling leader of a part of the Kingdom of Hungary, he was authorized to govern Slavonia, Croatia, Dalmatia, and the attached Hungarian counties (comitatus). Nevertheless, he was also active in other Hungarian affairs that have not been considered strictly as his remit; for instance, he mediated between his father and older brother, Béla, or supported the new king even after his enthronement. Coloman probably led a successful military campaign to Bosnia around 1236 against the local Bogomil heresy, the so-called Bosnian Church, and also took part in the battle of Muhi against the Mongol invaders in 1241. He was able to escape from the battlefield but was seriously wounded and died from his injuries a few weeks later near Zagreb, in Č� azma (Csázma).2 1 Wertner, Az Árpádok családi története, 436–38, 448; Kristó, A feudális széttagolódás Magyarországon, 32–33; Korai magyar történeti, 316 (entry by Tibor Almási); Attila Zsoldos, Az Árpádok és alattvalóik.

The first member who bore this name was King Coloman the Learned, and the prince was probably given this name by his mother, Sophia. The queen would have been familiar with the cult of the Irish pilgrim, Coloman, who died as a martyr at the Bavarian–Moravian border in 1012.3 The figure of King Coloman the Learned was not very popular among later members of the dynasty, since he blinded both his brother, Prince Á� lmos, and his son, King Béla II (1131–1142). Therefore, it is no wonder that the name Coloman was given only to the child of Prince Boris, a son of Coloman who had been expelled to Byzantium,4 and it must have served merely to emphasize dubious ties to the Á� rpáds. It is quite surprising that Roger of Apulia, archdeacon of Nagyvárad (Oradea), in the early thirteenth century counted King Coloman among the holy kings of Hungary (i.e., the Á� rpáds) while describing the Mongol invasion of 1241–42 in his work Carmen miserabile.5 His mistake can be possibly traced back to information in the Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (Chronicon Pictum, a variant of the chronicle-family known in his­ torical research as the Chronicle-Composition of the Fourteenth Century) that Coloman was bishop of Várad before he became ruler. Roger may have heard these favourable recollections in local oral history while he was in Várad. Nevertheless, the memory of Coloman the Learned was not cherished in the ruling dynasty and that is why we assume that Andrew II’s second son was not named after Coloman the Learned, but it just have been his mother’s choice. Gertrude, being a mem­ ber of the Andechs family, must have been familiar with the cult of St. Coloman, who was especially popular in the territory of the Babenbergs, in Austria. The earliest source, the Annales Mellicenses of Melk, mentioned the tomb of the martyr around 1012–14, and is confirmed by several later monastic annals. A Passio of Coloman was written in the mid-twelfth century, while a century later Friedrich of Babenberg intended to establish a new bishopric under the patronage of Coloman.6 This testifies to the continuing popu­ larity of the saint. In our opinion, the cult must have been known across the Austrian duchy among the members of the Andechs dynasty, even though there is no evidence of Coloman being used elsewhere as a family name. Let us also not forget Andrew II’s 3 Font, Koloman the Learned, 13.\n\n4 Scriptores rerum Hungaricarum, 1:429; In Byzantium Boris was called Kalamanos. see Gyula Moravcsik, Az Árpád-kori magyar történet bizánci forrásai [Byzantine Sources for Árpádian Hungary] (Budapest: Akadémiai Kiadó, 1988), 271 and 303.\n\n5 Master Roger; Korai magyar történeti, 576–77 (entry by Tibor Almási); Kornél Szovák, “A váradi irásbeliség hagyománya,” in Nagyvárad és Bihar a korai középkorban.

Just three points of interest are mentioned with regard to his life and all of them very con­ cisely; firstly, he is listed among the children of Andrew II; secondly, his presence is noted at his elder brother’s coronation; and, lastly, his death is mentioned as caused from his fight against the Mongols.8 The role of the young Coloman in Galicia is reflected in several Old-Russian Chronicles. Significant information can be found in the thirteenth-century Codex Ipatiev, the so-called Galician–Volhynian Chronicle (hereinafter GVC), and other texts that used this source. Several codices from the Moscowian and Novgorodian codex-family also contain relevant information, primarily related to key figures from the history of Galicia. The First Novgorodian Chronicle reports the deeds of Mstislav Udaloy (Удалой� / Удатный� / udaloy (the “Reckless”, or “Brave”) or udatnyj (the “Successful”) who defeated and cap­ tured Coloman. The Voskresensk Chronicle describes the Galician interest on the part of the princes of Smolensk, especially Mstislav Romanovich Staryj (“the Old”, Старый� 1212–23), the grand prince of Kiev at the time of Coloman’s stay in Galicia. The earlythirteenth-century events of Galicia–Volhynia also found their way, although signifi­ cantly shortened, via various redactions, into the compilations constructed in Moscow in the late fifteenth century.9 The content from the Galician–Volhynian Chronicle prevailed in several traditions; the most complete form of the text can be found in the Codex Ipatiev, which is straight narrative with no chronological division. The separation of the text into sections by dates is solely the work of a later copyist or redactor, not the chronicler, and so the dating is not reliable. The Ukrainian historian, Hrushevsky, made the necessary cor­ rections, clearing up the chronological mess, and historical research uses information based on his corrections. Despite the problematic chronology, the GVC is a very valuable source also for literary, linguistic, historical, and art-historical aspects.10 It has impor­ 7 Cf.

The editors argue that the original text survived in the so-called Hlebnikov Codex, in previous literature used the text of Ipatiev Codex, see: Hrushevsky, “Khronologia podij,” 2; Hodinka, Az orosz évkönyvek, 285; Антон I. Генсьорский� , Значення форм минулого часу в Галицко-Волыньскому\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\ntant information also on Hungary. The text of the GVC contains several parts—svod (свод)—written by different authors in different places. The chapters about Coloman are in the svod which contains the gesta-style biography of Prince Daniil (1201–1264).11 Accordingly, the Hungarian prince and his supporters as enemies of Prince Daniil are depicted negatively. Polish narrative sources emphasize the relationships of the Polish princes in Rus’, and Coloman is only touched upon because of his role in the dynastical relations and his involvement in the fight against the Mongols in 1241. The chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek, bishop of Kraków, was written in the early thirteenth century and describes events only till 1206, so Coloman’s years in Galicia are not included. Kadłubek’s chron­ icle is useful for showing the relation of Lesser Poland to Rus’ in the previous period, since it illustrates the relationship of Duke Leszek of Kraków, Coloman’s father-in-law, with his eastern neighbours. Another part of the chronicle about the Kingdom of Galicia written by Bishop Boguchwał of Poznań and his continuator Godysław Pasko, also has to be considered. The value of the source is disputed, since it contains important mistakes (e.g., it calls King Coloman the Learned’s descendant Boris (Colomanidis), king of Gali­ cia, and believes him to be the son-in-law of Bolesław III (1107–38)). But the legends surrounding Salomea, Coloman’s wife, is an essential part of the traditional legends in Polish literature. The princess got engaged to Coloman as a young child and after her husband’s death she returned to Poland and established the Order of the Poor Clares. The princess was later beatified and her title as queen, thanks to her marriage to Colo­ man, has been emphasized. This seems to be the sole reason why the Hungarian prince is mentioned in the legend at all. The text reveals no details on Salomea’s childhood in Galicia or her life in Hungary.12 The chronicle of Jan Długosz from the late fifteenth century seems to offer the most information. The author used earlier Polish chronicles, and he must have been familiar лiтопису [Significance of the Perfect Forms of Verbs in the Galician–Volhynian Chronicle] (Киї�в: Видавництво Академii наук Украї�нскої� РСР, 1957); Антон I.

Długosz recites the events of 1205–21 combined, there are repetitions concerning 1211, 1220, and 1224, and sum­ maries for 1217 and 1220. In Labuda’s view, Długosz had relatively rich source-material, and at the same time he had no information of his own. The value of Długosz as a source is hard to determine, since he got events the wrong way round sometimes and also made mistakes concerning the years, supposedly, on account of his use of the thirteenth-cen­ tury Old Rus’ian Chronicles.15 Concluding this survey of the narrative sources, we should note a peculiar work, the so-called Hungarian–Polish Chronicle (Chronicon mixtum, Chronicon Hungarico– Polonicum).16 It is a quite extraordinary literary work, yet as a historical source it requires especially careful treatment. It contains elements from the legend of St. Ursula and from the legend of St. Stephen by Bishop Hartvik at the start of the twelfth century, yet all other stories in the chronicle regarding the conquest and early history of Hungary contradict more authentic records, so belong to the realm of imagination.17 Despite its low value as historical evidence, it has played a disproportionate role in modern histo­ ries and what it might say about Coloman. According to certain scholars, it was written in Coloman’s environment, in his court in Slavonia (Ryszard Grzesik), or in the Scepus (Martin Homza), as the narrative indeed suggests. It is likewise assumed that the chron­ icle reflects the disagreement of Coloman and his younger brother, Andrew, which might link the chronicle to Coloman as duke of Slavonia. In terms of the survival of the text, we should mention the theory that Salomea was the one who brought the manuscript with\n\n13 Ioannis Dlugossii Annales seu Cronicae, 6:168–286.

With these caveats, we can still make use of the Hungarian–Polish Chronicle as historical source.\n\nCharters as Sources of Coloman’s Life\n\nThe reconstruction of Coloman’s life would not be possible based solely on narrative sources; so we have to examine relevant charters. The diplomas issued in the name of the prince form most important group. Fortunately, a modern edition contains all of the necessary information regarding the known charters. Unfortunately, not every text is nowadays available in its entirety; some are only available as later transcriptions or even just mentions. The first of Coloman’s charters was issued in 1226 and the last in the year of the prince’s death in 1241, so all of them belong to his Slavonian era, even if some reveal information concerning his earlier years. These charters represent the corpus on which the actions of Coloman as the duke of “whole Slavonia” has been reconstructed here. However, beyond the ducal charters we can avail ourselves of the documents of his father, Andrew II, his older brother, Béla IV, and their descendants, most of all King Stephen V (1270–72). Lastly, we can make use of Hungarian ecclesiastical charters, sec­ ular ones, as well as the papal charters.18\n\nMaterial Remains as Sources of Coloman’s Life\n\nOnly a handful of material artefacts exist that could be linked to Coloman. He was likely the initiator of the construction of a part of the castle of Scepus, but separating it from other parts of the stronghold has proven almost impossible. The same can be said for several other buildings in Galicia or Slavonia. No contemporary illustration of Coloman has survived, and his tombstone with his figure carved in stone is unfortunately lost for good. The only likeness is an image of him as Salomea’s husband in the church of the Poor Clares in Kraków and that dates from the seventeenth century.19\n\n18 See Regesta ducum, ducissarum, and Regesta regum stirpis Arpadianae.

The Kingdom of Hungary and its Neighbouring Territories in the 1230s—The Stages in Coloman’s Life.\n\n7\n\nChapter 1\n\nTHE GALICIAN CONTEXT IN 1205 Taking over the territory of Galicia was one of the aims of Andrew II’s reign in\n\nHungary (1205–35). The principality of Halych (a form of the Latinized name, Galicia) had formed during the twelfth century under the rule of Volodymerko (1124–53) and merged at the end of that century with Volhynia to create the principality of Galicia– Volhynia under Roman Mstislavich (1199–1205). The principality existed until 1340 when it was split: Galicia then fell under the control of the Polish crown, with Volhynia under the grand duchy of Lithuania. Today the territory of Galicia belongs partly to Poland (Przemyśl) and partially to Ukraine (Lviv, Halych). Andrew’s first campaign in Galicia started straight after his enthronement in 1205, and he abandoned these attempts only after the death of his youngest son, Andrew, in 1234. Whether the prince’s sudden death or other circumstances forced the Hungarian king to stop, we cannot be sure, since he died the following year. Andrew II’s interest in Galicia reflects that of his father, King Béla III (1172–96), who intended to strengthen the Hungarian rule in the principality of Galicia by placing his offspring there.1 Andrew was born around 1177, so he must have been about eleven or twelve years old at the time of the Hungarian campaign of 1188–89. He may have been aware of the nature of the Hungarian claim on Galicia, and his father’s military and dip­ lomatic plans might have made an impact on him. Andrew II’s grandmother, Euphrosyne Mstislavna, came from the Rurikid dynasty, whilst his grandfather, King Géza II (1141–62), had led several campaigns into the terri­ tory of the Kievan Rus’, even if their goals diverged in several aspects from those under Béla III. Experiences from Géza II’s time long predated Andrew but a memory of the campaigns probably lingered. Andrew II, in fact, did refer to his grandfather, father, and the events of their time, however different in nature.2 The short reign of Béla III in Galicia shows different kind of political actions. He incarcerated Vladimir Iaroslavich, the Galician prince, and started negotiations with the Galician elite and the grand prince of Kiev. Vladimir fled from the Hungarian court, and returned to Galicia, and stabilized his rule with the help of the duke of Kraków, Casimir II the Just (1177–94), and the sovereign of Vladimir–Suzdal. This episode foreshadows Polish–Hungarian struggles for Galicia.\n\n1 PSRL, 2:659–67; Font, Magyarok a Kijevi Évkönyvben, 293–311; Font, Árpád-házi királyok, 179–87.\n\n2 See the charter of King Andrew II, the so-called Andreanum: “our pious grandfather of blessed memory” and “our father of blessed memory” (Anjou-kori Oklevéltár. Documenta Res Hungaricastempore Regum Andegavensium Illustrantia 1301–1387, ed. Julius Kristó, vol. 4, 1315–1317 (Budapest and Szeged: Szegedi Középkorász Műhely, 1990–), 178–80).\n\n12\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe “Lordless” Territory of Galicia and Volhynia Andrew II started his first campaign in 1205, and the reason for the attack was likely a request from a widowed princess of Galicia. To understand how this happened, we have to explore the life of Roman Mstislavich, a member of the Rurik dynasty who was previ­ ously prince of Novgorod (1168–70), and subsequently of Vladimir Volynsky in Volhynia (from 1170), and then of Halych in Galicia (from 1199). This made him leader of the western Rus’ region, but in so doing brought Galicia and Volhynia into the spotlight for both Poland and Hungary. Roman had ruled, between 1199 and 1205, not only Galicia and Volhynia, but he also controlled the river route along the Dniester down to the Black Sea, whilst his expan­ sion towards the east had caused tension with the grand prince of Kiev, Rurik Rostislav­ ich. Roman locked Rurik’s daughter, his first wife, into a nunnery and married a new bride from the Byzantine Empire. Not satisfied with disputes in the east, the Galician prince intervened on several occasions in the quarrels of his western neighbours, with the princes of Kraków and Mazovia, which led to princes Leszek the White and Conrad respectively to unite in 1205 and turn against Roman and his expansionism. The prince of Galicia lost his life on the battlefield of Zawichost as the result of this new conflict.3 The new situation was now ripe for eastern expansion by Kraków and Mazovia. Roman’s death did not mean that his family became extinct; he had three children from his second marriage. The oldest child, his daughter, became at some point the wife of Prince Mikhail of Chernigov. She appears in documents only when his adult son, Rostislav, made a claim to Galicia in the 1230s basing his claim on his maternal descent.4 Roman’s first-born son, Daniil, was four and his second son, Vasilko, two years old in 1205. The prince’s widow attempted to hold the territory together for the benefit of their young offspring.\n\nThe Widow of Roman of Galicia-Volhynia and her Kinship with Hungary\n\nWho Roman Mstislavich’s widow was and what her ties were to the Hungarian king are long disputed. She is called a “ятровь / jatrov,” a term that refers generally to the “wife of the brother,” but here the word “brother” certainly does not mean sibling, or kin for that matter. It can indicate a distant relative, even a fictional one, or an ally. The name “Anna” does not appear in early documents and can only be traced backwards from later sources. Szaraniewicz asserted that Gertrude, queen of Hungary, and “Anna” were kin, but we disagree. Given that the widow’s name is unknown, she could have had rela­ tives from the Byzantine Empire too. Recent genealogical works argue for Byzantium and new archaeological research also implies this. Previous research ignored Andrew II having contact with the Byzantine world both through her mother and sister, so the\n\n3 Medieval Polish texts provide a detailed narrative of this event. See Ioannis Dlugossii Annales seu Cronicae, 6:192–97. For the relationships among the Polish princes see Chrzanowski, Leszek Biały, 64–65. 4 PSRL, 2:776; Font, “Prince Rostislav,” 64–65.\n\nThe Galician Context in 1205\n\n13\n\nwidowed Galician princess may indeed have been kin to the Hungarian king. Andrew’s own mother, Anna of Antioch, was the daughter of Constance of Antioch and Reginald de Châtillon, and her sister became the wife of Emperor Manuel.5 The older sister of Andrew II, Margaret, married Byzantine Emperor Isaac Angelos (1185–1204).6 Voytovych thinks that Roman’s second wife might have been born from this marriage. According to him, this daughter had been born by 1187, married Roman around 1200, and may have given birth to Daniil as early as 1201. Nevertheless, Voy­ tovych disregarded two pieces of evidence: on one hand, Margaret was born in 1175, so she could not have been older than ten by the time of her marriage; on the other hand, Prince Roman’s first child was not Daniil but a daughter, born around 1199–1200 who became the future wife of Mikhail of Chernigov. In turn Alexander Maiorov built on Voy­ tovych, and also believes that Roman’s wife was the child of Isaac’s elder daughter from a previous marriage, not with Margaret. Maiorov developed his argument based on a statement from Niketas Choniates. According to Choniates, the eldest daughter of Isaac became a nun and it is widely known that Roman’s widow also entered a nunnery after her sons reached adulthood. Maiorov linked these two statements and corrected Voy­ tovych’s theory, yet he left the question unanswered why the Byzantine historian, Choni­ ates, did not mention that the daughter at issue was previously the wife of Roman and had given birth to several children. Maiorov also offered a new proposition for the name of the widow, who previously was thought to be “Maria” or “Anna”: her name might have been “Ephrosinia” and she adopted the name “Anna” upon entering the convent.7\n\n5 For Prince Roman’s widow see PSRL, 2:717; Izidor Szaraniewicz, Die Hypathios Chronik als QuellenBeitrag zur österreichischen Geschichte (Lemberg: Dobrzańki & Groman, 1872), 42; Władysław Abraham, Powstanie organizacji kościoła łacinskiego na Rusi.

Mailath, Geschichte der Magyaren (Wien, 1828));\n\n14\n\nChapter 1\n\nIn our opinion, Maiorov’s view also needs further work, even though most research now looks for a solution in Byzantium. The name, Daniil, would also support this focus since while not unknown previously in Rus’ it was only used in church circles.8\n\nCustomary Law and Roman Mstislavich’s Widow in 1205\n\nIn Kievan Rus’ and in the newly established principalities of the twelfth century, which includes Galicia, customary law prevailed, drawing on existing, traditional practice. Power within the dynasty (clan) belonged to the oldest male by order of seniority (in Slavic: starshinstvo). Naturally, the first condition was the belonging to the dynasty. Local chronicles report that among the princes of the Rus’ conflicts were partially caused because de iure every member of the dynasty had the right to claim his share in power (in terms of territory and income). Distribution of power depended on who was the old­ est, yet within a populous family it was often not easy to decide the ranking of seniority and this led to a great deal of conflict. On several occasions in the twelfth century actual birth order was ignored, either with the help of a fictitious father–son relation or by sup­ porting a younger son against the first-born. Examples from Galicia during the twelfth century show that the boyars (or high-borns), resisted those decisions. Roman Mstislavich’s widow, in 1205, attempted to keep her late husband’s terri­ tories together for her small children, whilst intending to wield power in the name of the sons. This notion completely contradicted customary law in the Kievan Rus’. The underage orphans were in no position to hold their fathers’ lands, since the custom of seniority ranked them behind every adult member of the dynasty. A woman exercising power was almost unprecedented, and maternal ancestry gave no legitimacy on a can­ didate for gaining a territory; even an attempt based on support from outsiders would have offered better chances. A statement in a later source that Daniil and Vasilko “had a right” to the territories of their father is no more than the opinion of a later, sympathetic chronicler (Daniil’s Gesta being written by an author with ties to the prince’s court). This comment has instead been taken by modern historians at face value.9\n\nMilitary Conflict in Galicia from 1205 to 1214\n\nThe events of 1205 made it obvious that a key part of the local elite, the so-called boyars, was not willing to accept the rule of the underage princes and their mother; they pre­ ferred the Hungarian or Polish claims. Both options had their supporters in Galicia, and this contradiction was apparently solved with the first Polish–Hungarian agreement in Олександр Май� оров, Ɛфросинiя Галицька дочка вiзантiйського iмператора в ГалицькоВолинськiй Русi: княгиня i черниця [Ephrosinia of Galicia, Daughter of a Byzantine Emperor in Galician-Volhynian Rus’: Princess and Nun] (Бiла Церква: Пшонкiвский� , 2013), 23, 198–204.\n\n8 For instance, Monk Daniel, who went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, or Daniel “the Exile” (Zatochnik, Заточник), the author of a petition to a prince (see Gerhard Podskalsky, Christentum und theologische Literatur in der Kiever Rus’ (988–1237) (München: Beck, 1982), 195). 9 PSRL, 2:430, 2:657.

The Principality of Galicia–Volhynia and its Vicinity in the Twelfth to Thirteenth Centuries (3_galicia_volhynia).\n\n1206. However, internal struggles within the Polish claimants, each hankering after dif­ ferent territories in Galicia, led to military conflict there. The most important sites in Galician territory were Peremyshl, Terebovl, Zvenig­ orod, and Halych (later they were Iaroslavl, Kholm, and Lvov); while Cherven’, Vladimir Volynsky, Belz, Berestie, and Lutsk belonged to the Volhynian part. The duke of Kraków, Leszek, claimed rights over the western part of Galicia (Cherven’ and Vladimir Volynsky) and certain parts of Volhynia, whereas the rest of Volhynia was of great interest to Con­ rad, the prince of Mazovia. In Kraków Leszek “the White” (Biały) was duke (1202–27); it was his father, Casimir the Just, who had earlier helped the Galician ruler, Vladimir (1189–99), to return to the principality after his escape from Hungarian captivity. However, rivalry was developing in 1205–06 between Leszek and his brother, Conrad of Mazovia, concerning the overall rulership of Kraków. The Hungarian–Polish agreement of 1206 may have been reached during Leszek’s stay in Vladimir Volynsky. Mykhailo Hrushevsky believed that a personal meeting took place between the Hungarian king, Andrew II, and Leszek from Kraków.10 After the departure of the Hungarians, Leszek sent his envoys to Andrew II and proposed joint support for Roman’s children.11 The Polish prince and Andrew II divided up Roman’s\n\n10 For the events of 1205 see: PSRL, 2:717–18; Kronika halicko–wołyńska, 7–9; and Hrushevsky, Istorija Ukrainy–Rusi, 3:19. Leszek could have referred to this through his envoy. See also PSRL, 2:719; Leszek agreed with Conrad (see: Ioannis Dlugossii Annales seu Cronicae, 6:201–2). 11 PSRL, 2:719–20; Kronika halicko–wołyńska, 14–15; Bronisław Włodarski, “Rola Konrada\n\n16\n\nChapter 1\n\nformer principality: Volhynia became Leszek’s, while Galicia would now belong to the Hungarian king’s sphere of interest. As part of the agreement, Daniil Romanovich was kept in the Hungarian court from 1206 onwards. A planned military campaign in 1207 fell through due to an arrangement with the Galicians, but the division of the spheres of interest probably remained intact. Leszek granted Vladimir Volynsky to his fatherin-law in 1209, Berestie became the dominion of Vasilko Romanovich and his mother, while meanwhile in Belz his ally, Alexander Vsevolodich, was in charge. After the Hungarian campaign of 1207 Andrew II gave none of Galicia to Leszek; on the contrary, as the “guardian” of Daniil he started to use the title rex Galicie Lodomerieque in the intitulationes of his royal charters.12 He must have thought that he was able to operate without the cooperation of the Polish ruler. Furthermore, he based his assumption on his agreement with the Igorevich brothers from Chernigov who as lead­ ers of four of the centres of the Galician principality paid taxes to the Hungarian sover­ eign. But Daniil’s presence in the royal court was a stimulus for further actions. Polish–Hungarian cooperation was also damaged from the Polish side. Leszek’s plans for Volhynia were only partially realized and his influence was barely recognized in certain parts of the territory. As a result, Leszek tried to expand in Western Galicia, regardless of his agreement with Andrew II, which caused tension with the Hungarian king.13 Andrew II tried to pacify the situation by enthroning the child Daniil. Meanwhile, Leszek granted power in Volhynia, where he held influence due to his father-in-law (Ingvar, prince of Lutsk), to Daniil’s brother, Vasilko, and their mother. In 1211 the prince of Kraków joined a Hungarian-led campaign; he sent his captain, Sudisław, and his Volhynian military force (Vasilko from Belz, Alexander from Vladimir, his brother-in-law from Lutsk, and Mstislav Iaroslavich “the Mute” (Nemoj, Немой� )) from Peresopnica to Peremyshl. This enormous army could easily take Peremyshl, and after a series of Hungarian–Polish joint victories the young Daniil was inaugurated in the principality. His mother remained with him in Galicia, still fostering her own political ambitions. However, as soon as the Hungarian forces left, the local elite rose up against them and the boyars overcame the aspiring regent mother. The princess travelled to Belz in late 1211 and sought help again, probably via her envoys, from the Hungarian court against the boyars who were now in power. Andrew II helped her reclaim Galicia in the winter of 1211–12, and Volodislav, the leader of the boyars, was imprisoned in Hungary. Nonetheless, the widow and her sons could not retain power and fled to Hungary in late 1212 or early 1213 and later went to Kraków.14 Andrew II took off for Galicia anew in September 1213, but the campaign was disrupted because of Queen Gertrude’s assassination (September 28). Nonetheless, the conflict at home did not affect the king’s intentions towards Galicia. He may have returned home but his army, now led by his appointed boyar, Volodislav Kormilichich, mazowieckiego w stosunkach polsko-ruskich [Conrad of Maziovia’s Role in Polish–Rus’ian Relations],” Archiwum Towarzystwa Naukowego we Lwowie, series 2, 19, no. 2 (1936): 85–138. 12 Codex diplomaticus Hungariae, 3/1:31–32.\n\n13 Włodarski, Polska i Rus, 44; Szczur, Historia Polski, 260.\n\n14 PSRL, 2:728; Kronika halicko–wołyńska, 43; Font, Árpád-házi királyok, 200–2.\n\nThe Galician Context in 1205\n\n17\n\nMap 3.

Volodislav might even have received some estates in return for his cooperation, lands that were to become in 1218 the possession of the archbishop of Esztergom.15 The Poles then attacked Volodislav, who was seen as representing Hungarian rule in Galicia, a new Hungarian–Polish conflict.16 Leszek brought together the armies of Volhynia (Alexandr Vsevolodich and Mstislav “the Mute” (Храбрый� )) with the elite of Lesser Poland, Daniil and Vasilko, and attacked Galicia. He was triumphant on the battle­ field but failed to seize the stronghold of Halych. He was urged to come to an agree­ ment with Andrew II, since probably both of them realized that Volodislav’s rule was not favourable for either of them. 15 PSRL, 2:729; Kronika halicko–wołyńska, 45–46; Font, Árpád-házi királyok, 200–2; Włodarski, Polska i Rus, 53; Codex diplomaticus et epistolaris Slovaciae, 1:180; Codex diplomaticus Hungariae, 3/2:310.\n\n16 Volodislav is probably identical with Ladislaus Ruthenus, who is mentioned in the Hungarian charters. See Font, Árpád-házi királyok, 104, 199–205. The hypothesis that Vоlоdislav might have lived in Hungary until 1231–32 (for which see Jusupović, Elity ziemi Halickiej i Wolyńskiej, 286; and Мирослав Волощук, «Русь» в Угорскому Королiвствi (ХI–друга половина ХIV ст): суспiльнополiтична роль, мaйнови стосунки, мiграцiï [“Rus” in the Hungarian Kingdom (Eleventh to Second Half of the Fourteenth Century): Social-Political Role, Potencial Conflicts, Migration] (IваноФранкiвск: Лiлея НВ, 2014), 145) is not convincing, and similarly his presumed role in the Hungarian elite is also a misunderstanding (Мирослав Волощук, “Володислав Кормильчич: венгерская бытность 1214–1232 гг [Volodislav Kormilichych: in Hungary between 1214 and 1232],” Древняя Русь. Ворпосы медиевистики 37, no. 3 (2009): 19–20).\n\n18\n\nChapter 1\n\nAt this juncture, the elite of Kraków was divided on reaching an agreement with the Hungarians; those who favoured it were motivated by the failure of their own endeav­ ours. The other group wished to expand the influence of Kraków over Galicia and wanted no alliance with the Hungarians. Within Leszek’s court, the main figures behind the active politics towards the Rus’ belonged to the Odrowąż and Awdaniec families, particularly the chancellor, Iwan Odrowąż, and the castellanus,17 Wojewoda Pakosław from the Awdaniec family, who led Leszek’s campaigns.\n\nThe Polish Dynastic Element: Leszek, Conrad, and their Rus’ Wives\n\nLesser Poland, Sandomierz, and Mazovia were all close to the south-western centres of the Rus’, yet the border between the eastern and western Slavs was not fixed at all, as the western endeavours of Roman Mstislavich and Leszek’s interests in the east demonstrate.18 Members of the Piast and Rurikid dynasties often wed members from the other’s families. If we take a look at the ancestors of Leszek the White, we know that the first wife of his grandfather, Bolesław III Wrymouth, was Zbyslava, daughter of Grand Prince Sviatopolk of Kiev (1093–1113). Two of Leszek’s uncles also wed princesses from the Rus’: Bolesław IV “the Curly” married Verhuslava, daughter of Vsevolod Mstislavich, the prince of Novgorod, while Mieszko III “the Old” wed Eudoksiya, daughter of Iury Dolgoruky (Долгорукий� ). Likewise, their sister, Agnieszka was married to Mstislav Iziaslavich.19 The sources provide no explicit reference to the kinship of Leszek’s mother. Recent studies state that Helena, his mother, was the daughter of Conrad II, the prince of Zno­ jmo. This assumption is based on Kadłubek the chronicler’s remark that Prince Conrad III of Olomouc was the brother-in-law (frater iugalis) of Casimir the Just. Conversely, Balzer believed Helena to be a descendant from the Rurikid dynasty, basing himself on the records of the Old-Russian Chronicles in which Leszek is thought to be related to certain princes. According to Balzer, Helena was the daughter of Grand Prince Rostislav Mstislavich of Kiev (1159–67). This replaced his earlier theory that she was the daugh­ ter of Grand Prince Mstislav Iziaslavich of Kiev (1167–70). Balzer’s argument contra­ dicts Kadłubek, yet the report of the Old-Russian Chronicles regarding kinship between certain princes and Leszek is not necessarily false, since Leszek’s uncles married within\n\n17 The Polish word wojewoda looks similar to the Hungarian word vajda, but they have different meanings. The term wojewoda means “warlord” and “castellan” (from the Latin word castellanus), and it did not become an office with a secure territorial power, like the Transylvanian vajda in Hungary, where it is used solely with this meaning.\n\n18 Rhode, Ostgrenze Polens, 103–8; Marcin Wołoszyn, “Grody Czerwieńskie – między fascynacją a zapomnieniem [The Cities of Cherven’: Between Fascination and Oblivion],” in Czerwień – gród między Wschodem a Zachodem.

Leszek opposed him and supported Alexandr Vsevolodovich, the ruler of Belz, in trying to seize the core town of Vladimir Volynsky. Eventually they made peace in 1207. Leszek wed Grzymisława, the daughter of Iaroslav Vladimirovich afterwards.22 It is no wonder, with this in mind that Leszek held some influence in Volhynia, even being in a position to later bestow Belz to Vasilko (Daniil’s brother), whilst also gaining control over the territory between the rivers Wieprz and Bug, the so-called border region, or “Ukraine,” in the GVC.23 Leszek’s brother, Conrad, also married within the Rus’. His second wife was appar­ ently, Agafia/Agatha, according to Balzer, basing this on Długosz’s chronicle and later sources. But his first bride may have been the daughter of Sviatoslav Igorevich, who had interests in the territories of Novgorod–Seversk and Galicia. The dual marriage is largely ignored in recent research.24 The Hungarian kings had significantly fewer family ties with the princes of the Rus’. Their primary interest was capturing Galicia, and expended little effort on Volhynia, even if the name of the territory eventually featured among their titles, with Andrew II the first to signal himself as king of Galicia and Volhynia (“Lomoderia”). The Hungarian royal troops (the army of the whole realm) was superior to the forces from Kraków, yet the military contingent they left in Galicia was never sufficient enough to hold onto their gains. Meanwhile, the presence of Daniil in Kraków was to prove disadvantageous for further Hungarian expansion. The solution to this ongoing rivalry and internal struggles was to be the Agreement of Scepus, which we will now describe. 20 Magistri Vincentii Chronica Polonorum, 4:162; Kazimierz Jasiński, Rodowód Piastów śląskich.

Their shared priorities were primarily to strengthen their influence, and they supported Daniil and Vasilko while their mother acted as their regent (1205–06). Andrew II came to an agreement with the sons of Igor (Igorevichs), who were given Galicia in return for paying taxes (1207–10). Meanwhile, the young Daniil continued to reside at the Hungarian court. Once the minor Daniil was expelled from Galicia, Hungarian–Polish cooperation reached a new level (1211, 1213), yet soon enough the collaboration faced new problems. It became clear for both parties, as early as 1214, that rule over Galicia would be possible only as the result of Polish– Hungarian cooperation, with a more solid foundation. To this end, the idea emerged to marry their two children, Coloman and Salomea, who would then rule Galicia together.\n\nThe Agreement\n\nLeszek and Andrew came to an agreement at a personal gathering in Scepus (Hungarian: Szepesség, today in Slovakia: Spiš).1 This council was prepared by the duke’s envoys, “Lestich”2 and Pakosław, castellanus of Kraków. The GVC credits Leszek with the idea of the dynastic marriage to bind the alliance. Pakosław took an active part in the arrangements, not least because the agreement was favourable for him. The object of the bargaining was the Galician territory, yet Kraków laid claim only to Peremyshl and Liubachev. Those two important settlements belonged to the watershed of the river Vistula (around the San and Bug tributaries) which ran north to the Baltic, whereas all the other rivers belonged to the watershed of the Dniester which headed south towards the Black Sea. It is worth mentioning that Pakosław, not Leszek, gained possession of Liubachev which underlines the political strength of the so-called “Galician party.”3 1 PSRL, 2:732; Pauler, A magyar nemzet története, 2:54–55; Włodarski, Polska i Rus, 58; Pashuto, Ocherki po istorii, 200; Procházková, “Postavenie haličského kráľa,” 66; Hollý, “Princess Salomea and Hungarian–Polish Relations,” 12, 14–15; Nagirnyj, Polityka zagraniczna księstw tiem Halickiej i Wołyńskiej, 171; Dąbrowski, Daniel Romanowicz, biografia polityczna, 83–84.\n\n2 “Lestich” is not a given name, but it derives from the word Lestco (the Latin version of Leszek) and is a “paternal name.” It was not used by the Poles; still, the eastern-Slavic chronicler could use it referring to some relative of Leszek. It could logically refer to his son, but Leszek married only in 1207, and he had no son by that time. A mystical Polish king also bore the name Lestco (See Magistri Vincentii Chronica Polonorum, 18), so the passage could be also interpreted as “someone from the family of the Polish prince.” The historiographical sources only name Pakosław and noone else. The name Lestich as an independent version can be seen in the name register PSRL, 2:xxi. For the origin of the name Leszek and its bearers see Chrzanowski, Leszek Biały, 25–26. 3 PSRL, 2:731; Kronika halicko–wołyńska, 59–60.\n\n22\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Polish–Hungarian rule of Galicia was now to be embodied in the children of Andrew and Leszek, respectively the roughly six-year-old Coloman and three-year-old Salomea (probably born around 1211). The agreement was theoretically perfect, but the practice showed its weakness, and several problems emerged. They mostly abandoned the earlier justification and pretence that the combined forces were merely there in sup­ port of the sons of Roman Mstislavich. This was dangerous for Leszek, who relied on the Volhynian military force, and an alliance between Daniil and Vasilko supported by the local boyars could imperil Polish influence. The autonomy of the siblings was also a threat to Andrew II’s Galician chances, since they could offer an alternative to Hungarian rule. The Hungarian army was significantly larger than that of Lesser Poland, so Leszek was almost forced to follow Andrew II.4 But the prince intended to ease this pressure through the search for new allies. The date of the Scepus Agreement cannot be ascertained from the GVC or any other sources, yet the year of 1214 is not disputed by scholars.5 A more precise dating is impossible and moves into the realm of possibilities. Most researchers assume the date to be the fall of 1214, with Holovko only opting for a summer meeting of the rulers.6 The logic behind the date lies in the previous events and the later cooperation. Leszek was still fighting in Volhynia in the spring of 1214, whereas a united Polish–Hungarian force had appeared by the end of the year.7 The chronicles offer an intense narrative, yet it seems sure that weeks passed by between the journey of Leszek’s envoys and the rendezvous of the sovereigns. Implementing the agreement needed further time, and the combined army probably took some weeks to reach Galicia. Therefore, the meeting 4 Олександр Б. Головко, Корона Данила Галицького.

Implementing the Scepus Agreement needed military and political preparations, especially the occupation of Galicia. Volodislav, the boyar leader, was captured and impris­ oned once again, never to escape. This imprisonment has been called into question by Włodarski, as he interpreted the verb “zatoči” instead as exile.8 In the light of later events, this is improbable. On the contrary, Volodislav never appeared again in any of the sources and an exile probably would not have hindered him from some forms of involvement. From the Polish side, Pakosław must have been present during the negotiations, but we know nothing certain about the Hungarian participants. Several royal officials must have accompanied the king. Among Andrew’s key dignitaries were Palatine Nicholas, who was also count (comes) of Bodrog County, Marcel, son of Marcel from the Tétény genus (for which term I will use kindred henceforward), who was the judge of the royal court (iudex curiae) and count of Csanád, Gyula from the Kán kindred, who was the voivode of Transylvania and count of Szolnok, and Atyusz, son of Atyusz from the Aty­ usz kindred, who was the ban of Slavonia. The master of the treasury was Miska, son of Solomon, from the Atyusz kindred, later the first master of the horse, a title that only appeared in 1217. If we look at the region where the meeting took place, royal control was clearly still in flux; from 1214 only the counts of Borsod, Ú� jvár, and Zemplén coun­ ties are known (Jacob; Alexander, son of Thomas, from the Hontpázmány kindred; and Martin, respectively). The first count of Scepus appeared in sources only from 1216, the one of Gömör (Gemer) from the mid-thirteenth century, while Sáros (Š� ariš) was merely a royal estate (predium) at the start of the fourteenth century.9 The presence of Archbishop John of Esztergom (1205–22), one of the prelates of the Kingdom of Hungary, was presumably required for the coronation of Coloman. Marcel, the royal judge, was probably there too, since his career started in 1206, right after the enthronement of Andrew II, and he also playd an important role in leading the realm’s military in 1211.10 Denis (Dénes), son of Ampud, also could have been present; his career started as master of the treasury and count of Scepus in 1216. It can be assumed that the events of 1214 promoted the formation of the royal county in Scepus. Furthermore, Demetrius of the Aba kindred and File (Füle, Filja), who both played a later role in Prince Coloman’s rule in Galicia, were presumably present at the meeting. There would have been no participants who would have also witnessed Andrew II’s adventure in Galicia as a child. Palatine Moch (Mog) served under King Béla III: as judge of the royal court (iudex curiae) in 1185–86, and in 1188 as count of Nyitra (Nitra). At the beginning of Andrew’s reign, he received the palatine’s office for the third time (1206) but he was probably dead by 1214. 8 PSRL, 2:731; Kronika halicko–wołyńska, 53–54; Włodarski, Polska i Rus, 65.\n\n9 Zsoldos, Magyarország világi archontológiája.

The Castle of Scepus in 2016 (with kind permission of Márta Font).\n\nThe Location It was convenient for the meeting of the Hungarian king and the Polish prince to take place near the common border; it is similarly understandable that the sovereign of lower rank and of younger age, the prince, visited the older king. We do not know where exactly they met in Scepus, or what suitable venue (perhaps a royal residence) could accommodate such a council, a reception, and catering for the king, the prince, and their entourages. The GVC refers only to the name of Scepus. The settlement of the Scepus region happened only in the second half of the thir­ teenth century, and it must have been quite unpopulated still in 1214. The lack of an established royal county supports this, since across the Kingdom of Hungary royal coun­ ties were established to make the inhabitants belong to and depend upon royal power. The name “Scepus” derives from the Hungarian adjective szép (“beautiful”); varia­ tions in other languages were based on that (Latin: Scepus, German: Zips, and later the Slovak Spiš).11 The county of Scepus was a royal county, a kind of structure that first appeared in the thirteenth century. According to Gyula Kristó’s categorization of the counties, the region was one of the later formed counties, since records of the first ruling count, Denis, son of Ampud, only appear from 1216; likewise, the earliest dating of the castle is unknown. It can be assumed that development started at the turn of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries from the territories originally belonging to Borsod and Gömör. 11 Földrajzi nevek etimológiai szótára, I–II [Etymological Dictionary of Geographical Names], ed. Lajos Kiss (Budapest: Akadémiai Kiadó, 1978), 609; Korai magyar történeti, 636 (entry by Gyula Kristó).\n\n26\n\nChapter 2\n\nAt that time Denis was also count of the neighbouring Ú� jvár County, so it was reason­ able to give him jurisdiction over the newly forming county as well. One reason for the separation into two distinct counties might have been the income from the trade route; as data from 1198 shows, it led through the area terra Scepusiensis (land of Scepus) from which the royal men took a toll.12 The next record of the tolls dates to after the attack of the Mongols (1243), at which point the toll-free status of the noblemen of Scepus to the markets of Szepesváralja (Spišské Podhradie) was secured. Research by Attila Zsoldos demonstrates the special nature of the formation of Sce­ pus, and he compares it with other counties. Zsoldos13 differentiates two types of county formations, the first being based on a close symbiosis between the county and the royal castle (várispánság), whereas the other type (the later counties) were based on the kings’ personal estates. These were generally formed on the basis of so-called forestdominions (erdőuradalom). But Scepus fits neither group.14 The territory’s formation was still in flux in the opening decades of the thirteenth century. It is unclear if the construction of the royal castle, which could have been the location of the meeting, was already finished or whether it was even started. The first mention of this stronghold derives from a charter of Béla IV issued in 1249, so the begin­ ning of the construction must have been by the 1230s. The three-storey palace included a freestanding tower and a large hall (22×12 metres) on every floor. Slovak historians believe that these buildings were constructed by Coloman, even if certain investigations date the whole castle to the second half of the thirteenth century. Archaeological finds suggest an earlier construction, yet their interpretation is somewhat doubted. István Feld summarized the history of the research in his recent study; according to him, the round building of twenty-two metres in diameter with a middle pillar on the top of the hill was originally a residential tower, and it was turned into a water tank only after the reconstruction of the building. Other scholars argue that it was originally built for water catchment. The latest Slovak research suggests that the tower was a residential building built in the late twelfth century, whilst its first floor was meant to be a water tank. Martin Homza even stated that Béla III imprisoned Prince Vladimir in the tower after he fled to Hungary from Galicia, but this seems fanciful. A comprehensive monograph on the whole castle, describing the history of the construction, is sorely needed. Notwithstanding, we 12 Boglárka Weisz, A királyketteje és az ispán harmada.

Denis, son of Ampud, held the titles of count of Scepus and Ú� jvár, and he also bore the office of master of the treasury in 1216. Later on he had a major role in Hungarian affairs in the Balkans as the count of Bodrog (1220–22), and subsequently as palatine (1227–28, 1231, 1234). See Zsoldos, Magyarország világi archontológiája, 295 (Regesta regum stirpis Arpadianae, no. 308); Zsoldos, “Szepes megye kialakulása,” 30.\n\nThe Agreement of Scepus\n\n27\n\nmight presume that the tower could have served as a royal court house, like a curia, as Alexander Ruttkay believes, and if not, there could have been a separate “court house without any fortification,” as seen at other administrative units on the periphery of the forest county/comitatus (erdőispánság),15 which would only be suitable for shorter stays.16 The first mention of a provost of the collegiate chapter of Scepus, a certain Adolf, originates from 1209; he was given the estates along the River Poprad “to populate them with people.” The building of the provostry is later; according to Ernő Marosi the con­ struction started in the mid-thirteenth century. Attila Zsoldos stated that the foundation of this collegiate chapter meant that ecclesiastical estates must have existed in Scepus at the beginning of the thirteenth century, whilst the royal benefactions presented the possibility for the appearance of private estates.17 Whether secular or religious, the formation of Scepus (Szepes) County seems to be dated to the start of the thirteenth century, whilst the buildings were a generation or two later.18\n\nThe Impact on Dynastic Legitimacy and the Succession\n\nHow did the Scepus Agreement affect the legitimacy of the new Polish–Hungarian rulers of Galicia, Coloman and Salomea, in a region where different customary traditions and clans had held sway? We have already noted how Roman Mstislavich’s widow, after his death in 1205, attempted to keep his lands together for her small children, tried to wield power herself in the name of the sons, but how this generated great resistance by the boyars who forced her into exile. The statement that “Roman’s sons had a legitimate right to the throne” appeared on several occasions in the historiography of the period.19 In the principalities of the Rus’ seniority (staršinstvo), as we previously described, was the basic principle,20 yet as a dynasty grew not even adults were always able to enforce their rights: many times uncles and nephews were not only of the same age, but an uncle could be the younger one. Therefore, traditional seniority was almost impossible to follow. Claimants often had resource to military help of their western neighbours or nomads of the steppe to 15 That is, forest regions overlapping the administrative boundaries of royal counties and administered by a forest count (comes).\n\n16 Korai magyar történeti, 637 (entry by István Feld); Feld, “Az erdőispánságok várai az Á� rpádkori,” 371, 376–79; Homza, “Včasnostredoveké dejiny Spiša,” 1:126–50; Vladimí� r Olejní� k , Magdaléna Janovská and Martin Stejskal, “Spišsky hrad ako kráľovské sí�dlo [The Castle of Spiš as a Royal Seat],” in Spišský hrad ako královské sídli, ed.

The chances of the orphans—and as a matter of fact widows— were almost hopeless. The consequences of staršinstvo were obvious. An attempt to formulate the principle took place at the convention of Liubech, as early as the eleventh century, underscor­ ing that everyone should preserve their fathers’ heritage, yet its implementation was often only possible with accompanying, often military, force. Local branches of the Rurik dynasty emerged in the course of the twelfth century (for instance, in Chernigov the offspring of Oleg Sviatoslavich, while in Vladimir–Suzdal the descendants of Iury Dol­ gorukii shared the incomes of the territory). In the south-western part of the Rus’, in Galicia, power was passed down from father to son on several occasions: Vladimirko to Iaroslav Osmomysl (Осмомысль) to Vladimir. When the branch died out, however, with the last prince of neighbouring Volhynia, Roman Mstislavich followed his usual process of absorbing Galicia into his Volhynian territory (in 1199). Despite expansion along the river Dniestr between 1199 and 1205, there was no real cohesion between the two principalities, with the Galician boyars distrustful. The incomes were more significant in Galicia,21 so it is no wonder that the local boyars sought independence. Roman’s children’s right to the succession was rejected after their father’s death. The adult Igorevichs from Chernigov22 also claimed their right to Galicia based on their mother’s descent, whilst Roman’s distant relatives from Novgorod appeared too, with favourable connections on the steppe: Mstislav “the Brave” (Khrabry, Храбрый� ), and his son Mstislav “the Successful” (Udaloy, Удалой� ).23 In this situation Roman’s sons, or rather their mother, chose the obvious solution and tried to make use of their Polish and Hungarian connections. The claims were all based on various titles; yet everyone was being led by the goal of expansion, including the Krakówian and the Hungarian rulers. Slavic historiography holds, following Shusharin, that Andrew II’s purpose regard­ ing Galicia was to form a personal union, as had happened in Croatia in the late eleventh century.24 Nevertheless, the parallel of the two cases is not just invalid but misleading, 21 See the incomes of Vladimirko and later his grandson, Vladimir, in order to hold their power in the twelfth century. The former sent several gifts to the Hungarian kings, whereas the latter promised the Holy Roman emperor two thousand grivnas per year. See Font, Magyarok a Kijevi Évkönyvben, 228–31, 310–11.\n\n22 The rival sides among the branches of the Rurik dynasties were the descents of Vladimir (Vsevolodovich) Monomakh and Oleg Sviatoslavich. Prince Roman and his son were offsprings of the Monomakh branch, and the princes of Chernigov derived from Oleg. One of the newest branches among Oleg’s offsprings was that of the Igorevichs, and they were related to a certain part of Chernigov, Novgorod Severskii. There were several kinships among the various branches at the beginning of the thirteenth century. Unfortunately, the names of the female members are mostly unknown. 23 Rapov, Kniazheskie vladeniia, 163, 182.\n\n24 Владимир П.

Nagirnyj has misinterpreted my statement (Márta Font, “Ungarn, Polen und Halitsch-Volhynien im 13. Jahrhundert,” Studia Slavica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 38, nos. 1–2 (1993): 27–39 at 35), since the reference regarding the territory banats did not refer to Croatia.\n\nThe Agreement of Scepus\n\n29\n\nsince Croatia had already begun to form a state in the tenth century, and the Croatian kings had received a crown from the papacy in the eleventh century. The personal union between Hungary and Croatia was emphasized by King Coloman’s separate coronation in 1102.25 The state of Croatia diverged fundamentally from that of Galicia, where the institution of a kingdom and its later tradition was only established by Prince Coloman’s coronation at the start of the thirteenth century. We see the plans of Andrew II in Galicia as being far more analogous to Hungarian expansion and administration on the Balkans.26\n\n25 Diplomata Hungariae antiquissima: accedunt epistolae et acta ad historian Hungariae pertinenta, vol. 1, Ab anno 1000 usque ad annum 1131, ed.

We know it happened and a few details are revealed thanks to four charters: two letters of Andrew II written to Pope Innocent III, a diploma of Honorius III, and a grant from the Hungarian sovereign to Demeter of the Aba kindred, one of the officials of the newly crowned Coloman. The last two sources were issued long after the events (in 1222 and 1234), and neither reveal the location nor the date, but do confirm the fact of the enthronement. The first royal letter sent to Innocent III is dated to 1214 and must have followed the Scepus Council. Andrew II intended to handle several items. First, he requested papal permission for Coloman to be crowned king of Galicia by Archbishop John of Esztergom (filium nostrum […] in regem inungat).1 The second letter2 was meant to offer thanks for the received licence and formulated a petition for a golden crown for Coloman (coronam auream Regie dignitati congruentem filio nostri conferre). Furthermore, the Hungar­ ian king promised to send a clergyman from Galicia to participate at the Fourth Lateran Council. The council started in November 1215, so the royal letter was probably written in August, at the very latest. Regarding the coronation, while in the Kingdom of Hungary the reigning archbishop of Esztergom had the right to conduct the enthronement,3 this privilege concerned solely the Hungarian kings and it did not require papal permission. The case of Coloman was different; it was a new phenomenon with no precedent, and therefore papal licence was essential. Innocent III’s approval was intended to be secured using the formulation of a request that it was motivated by the local elite and people, who were eager to join the Roman Church (Galiciae principes et populus, nostri ditioni subiecti humiliter a nobis postularunt). The Scepus Agreement was not even mentioned in the first letter, whereas the second mentions a matrimonial contract (contractum) and asks for papal mediation to convince Leszek to send help for Coloman, who was under siege in the castle of Halych. It is significant that Andrew II also expressed gratitude for the papal approval of Colo­ man’s coronation (referentes gratiarum actiones, quod postulatio nostra super coronando 1 Codex diplomaticus Hungariae, 3/1:163–64; Regesta regum stirpis Arpadianae, no. 294.\n\n2 Codex diplomaticus Arpadianus, 6:374–75; Regesta regum stirpis Arpadianae, no. 302; Pauler, A magyar nemzet története, 2:496n55; Włodarski, Polska i Rus, 62.\n\n3 The right of the archbishops of Esztergom during the coronation can be documented as early as the eleventh century. Archbishop Berthold of Kalocsa, brother of Queen Gertrude, tried but failed to extend the rights of the prelates of Kalocsa. The quarrel was ended by a charter of Pope Innocent III issued on May 9, 1209 (see László Koszta, A kalocsai érseki tartomány kialakulása [The Formation of the Archdiocese of Kalocsa], Thesaurus historiae ecclesiasticae in Universitate Quinqueecclesiensi 2 (Pécs: Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2013), 109–11; Kiss, Királyi egyházak, 46–47; Barabás, Das Papsttum, 295–99.\n\n32\n\nChapter 3\n\nfilio nostro in Regem Galicie ad mandatum Apostolicum optatum consecuta est effectum), and it was no longer an anointment with unction, as earlier, but in fact a coronation. The golden crown and letter that were requested were meant to help stabilize Coloman’s rule in Galicia (perpetuam stabilitatem pretendat).4 There is no record of the crown’s delivery; but, a royal charter of 1234 states: sepedictum filium nostrum optento ex indulgencia Sedis Apostolice dyademate, Illustrem Regem Gallicie feliciter inunctum fecissemus inclite coronari [“We made our aforementioned son to be crowne"
