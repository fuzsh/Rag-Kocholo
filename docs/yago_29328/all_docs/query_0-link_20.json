Her father which some give as Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, is not attested in any reliable primary source.\n\nEupraxia of Kiev, a sister of Vladimir, became notorious all over Europe for her divorce from the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV on the grounds that he had attempted a black mass on her naked body.\n\nIn his famous Instruction (also known as The Testament) to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the Polovtsi. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin Oleg, but after Vladimir was sent by his father to rule Chernigiv and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company.

In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, Vladimir, the future capital of Russia.

The same year he entered Kiev to the great delight of the crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125.

Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from Constantinople to Rus of such precious relics as the Theotokos of Vladimir and the Vladimir/Muscovite crown called Monomakh's Cap.\n\nMarriages and children:\n\nVladimir was married three times. His first wife was Gytha of Wessex, daughter of Harold of England who fell at Hastings and Edith Swannesha.

Han var dotterson till den bysantinske kejsaren Konstantin IX Monomachos. Han blev prins av Smolensk 1077 och prins av Tjernigov 1078. Vladimir fortsatte som sina företrädare att dels hålla samman det kievryska riket, genom att bekämpa de hotande stäppfolken, framför allt polovtserna, dels centralisera den politiska makten till Kiev. Som ett av den fornryska litteraturens viktigaste dokument framstår Vladimirs testamente från cirka 1117, vilket i huvudsak utgörs av en självbiografi och en brevsamling.\n\nVladimir II var gift tre gånger. Han gifte sig år 1074 i London med Gytha av England, född i London 1053. De fick följande barn:\n\nMstislav I, född 1076, furste av Kiev.\n\nIziaslav, född 1077.\n\nSvjatoslav, född cirka 1080.\n\nJaropolk II, född 1082.\n\nVjatjeslav, född 1083.\n\nMarina, född ca 1087.\n\nPrince, Grand Duke of Kiev\n\nFamilj med Gytha\n\nVigsel: omkring 1070 1)\n\nBarn:\n\nMstislav I av Kiev (1076 - 1132)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKällor\n\n1) Directory of Royal Genealogical Data, Hull, England\n\nWladimir married Storfurstinna av Kiev Gythe Gyda, daughter of Kung av England Harald II Goldwinsson and Unknown, in 1046.\n\nFyrste av Smolensk 1067 - 1094.\n\nFyrste av Chernigiv 1078 - 1094.\n\nFyrste av Pereyaslavl 1094 - 1113.\n\nStorfyrste av Kijev [Kiev] 1113 - 1125.\n\nVladimir (Volodymyr) ble fyrste av Pereyaslavl da hans far, Vsevolod I, døde og støttet sin kusine Sviatopolk som storfyrste av Kijev for å unngå krig mellom de russiske prinsene.\n\nHan ble populær etter sine vellykkede kampanjer (1103-11) mot kumanene, nomadiske innvandrere som var en konstant trussel mot Russland.\n\nHan etterfulgte Sviatopolk som storfyrste da denne døde.

Volodar Glebovitj av Minsk var en furste av Minsk tillhörig den så kallade polotskdynastin (eller polovtserna) efter det vitryska staden och furstendömet Polotsk, varifrån den stammade. Han var son till Gleb Vseslavitj av Minsk (död 1119) och Anastasia Jaropolkova. Volodar dog efter 1167, möjligen 1176. Volodars familj hade sedan längre tid varit i strid med storfursten av Kiev, Vladimir Monomach, vilken 1113 (enligt vissa uppgifter 1119) erövrat Minsk från Volodars far. Senare hade polotskdynastins återstående besittningar erövrats av Vladimirs son Mstislav Vladimirovisj och dess medlemmar tvingats i landsflykt till bland annat Konstantinopel. Efter Mstislavs död 1132 föll dock Kiev-riket sakta samman och polotskdynastin kunde återvända till den ryska politiska scenen. Volodar gifte sig den 5 juni 1135 (troligen medan han befann sig i exil i Polen) med Rikissa av Polen, dotter till Boleslav III av Polen och änka efter den danske prinsen och kortvarige svenske kungen Magnus Nilsson av Danmark, vilken året innan stupat i slaget vid Fotevik. Volodar och Rikissa fick dottern Sofia av Minsk, vilken senare gifte sig med Valdemar den store av Danmark. Volodars och Rikissas äktenskap var ett politiskt drag av hennes far riktat mot den dåvarande alliansen mellan Erik Emune av Danmark och Monomachs ättlingar. Sedan ett flertal centrala aktörer i denna konflikt dött och monomachernas ställning i Ryssland kraftigt försvagats föll också grunden för äktenskapet vilket upplöstes i skilsmässa varefter Rikissa gifte om sig med Sverker d.ä. av Sverige. I äldre historieforskning förväxlades Volodar i regel (bland annat av Nikolaj von Baumgarten) med den halvt mytiske furst Vladimir Vsevolodisj av Novgorod.\n\nPrince Volodar ?

These Greek connections played an important role in his foreign affairs.\n\nEupraxia of Kiev, a sister of Vladimir, became notorious all over Europe for her divorce from the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV on the grounds that he had attempted a black mass on her naked body.\n\nVladimir was married three times. His first wife was Gytha of Wessex, daughter of Harold of England who fell at Hastings and Ealdgyth Swan-neck.

Married Leon Diogenes. A pretender to the throne of the Byzantine Empire, claiming to be a son of Romanos IV. Rose to the rank of khan of the Cumans in Ossetia.\n\nThe second wife is considered to have been a Byzantine noblewoman. The Primary Chronicle records her date of death on 7 May 1107. However the Chronicle does not mention her name. They had at least six children:\n\nRoman Vladimirovych, Prince of Volhynia (d. 6 January 1119).\n\nEufemia of Kiev (d. 4 April 1139).

Her people belonged to the Kipchaks, a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of Turkic origin.\n\nHowever the Primary Chronicle identifies Aepa as father-in-law to Yuri Dolgoruki. With Vladimir negotiating the marriage in name of his son. Whether father and son married sisters or the identity of intended groom was misadentified is unclear.\n\nVladimir II Monomakh ( Russian: ???????? ???????; Ukrainian: ????????? ???????; Christian name Vasiliy, or Basileios) (1053  May 19, 1125) was a famous Velikiy Kniaz (Grand Prince) of Kievan Rus'.\n\nHe was the son of Vsevolod I (married in 1046) and Anastasia of Byzantium (d. 1067). Her father which some give as Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, is not attested in any reliable primary source.\n\nEupraxia of Kiev, a sister of Vladimir, became notorious all over Europe for her divorce from the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV on the grounds that he had attempted a black mass on her naked body.\n\nReign\n\nThe Testament of Vladimir Monomakh to Children, 1125. Lithography of 1836.\n\nIn his famous Instruction (also known as The Testament) to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the Polovtsi. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin Oleg, but after Vladimir was sent by his father to rule Chernigiv and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company. Since that time, Vladimir and Oleg were bitter enemies who would often engage in internecine wars. The enmity continued among their children and more distant posterity.\n\nFrom 1094, his chief patrimony was the southern town of Pereyaslav, although he also controlled Rostov, Suzdal, and other northern provinces. In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, Vladimir, the future capital of Russia. In order to unite the princes of Rus' in their struggle against the Great Steppe, Vladimir initiated three princely congresses, the most important being held at Lyubech in 1097 and Dolobsk in 1103.\n\nWhen Sviatopolk II died in 1113, the Kievan populace revolted and summoned Vladimir to the capital. The same year he entered Kiev to the great delight of the crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125. As may be seen from his Instruction, he promulgated a number of reforms in order to allay the social tensions in the capital. These years saw the last flowering of Ancient Rus, which was torn apart 10 years after his death.\n\nVladimir Monomakh is buried in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the golden age of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from Constantinople to Rus of such precious relics as the Theotokos of Vladimir and the Vladimir/Muscovite crown called Monomakh's Cap.\n\nMarriages and children\n\nVladimir was married three times. His first wife was Gytha of Wessex, daughter of Harold of England who fell at Hastings and Edith Swannesha.

Whether father and son married sisters or the identity of intended groom was misadentified is unclear.\n\nVladimir II Monomach var kievrysk storfurste från 1113. Dotterson till den bysantinske kejsaren Konstantin IX Monomachos. Vladimir fortsatte företrädarnas strävanden att dels hålla samman det kievryska riket genom att bekämpa hotande stäppfolk framför allt polovtserna dels centralisera den politiska makten till Kiev. Som ett av den fornryska litteraturens viktigaste dokument framstår Vladimirs testamente från ca 1117 vilket i huvudsak utgörs av en självbiografi och en brevsamling.\n\nKälla: \"Nationalencyklopedin\"\n\nVladimir var gift 3 gånger.
