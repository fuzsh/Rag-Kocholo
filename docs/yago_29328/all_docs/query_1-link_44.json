Jahrhundert, published in Cologne by Böhlau in 2007 as volume 21 of the series “Quellen und Studien zur baltischen Geschichte” issued by the Baltische Historische Kommission (Göttingen, Germany). Apart from the slight amendments and updating of the text, the bibliography has also been updated and ‘anglicized’ to some extent. A few minor parts were abridged to avoid unnecessary repetition and details of local interest tangential to the main narrative. Any flaws and mistakes identified and located by reviewers have been corrected. The adaptation of the monograph was supported by Estonian Research Council grant no. PUT 107. The Baltic region is a multilingual area in which several languages have been used throughout history. Accordingly, there are parallel traditions of placename usage. Since the medieval and early modern language of administration and correspondence was predominantly German in this region, or more specifically Middle Low German in the Middle Ages, and a major part of the relevant historiography is written in German, preference has generally been given to German place names in this book. English place names have been used where there is an established equivalent. The toponyms of local languages can be found in the index and in the multilingual place-name concordance (p. 318). The transliteration of Russian names and places follows the Library of Congress standard, except where the established English equivalents differ. I would like to thank the Baltische Historische Kommission and its president Professor Matthias Thumser, and the Böhlau publishing house for the kind permission to publish the book in English. I would also like to thank Professor Florin Curta, who accepted the monograph in his series “East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450–1450”, and Dr Fiona Robb, who carefully carried out the translation work. Marcella Mulder of Brill was responsible for all the organisational and technical aspects of publication. Dr Tõnno Jonuks helped to find the cover illustration, commented on it, and provided the photograph. Kristel Roog drew the maps, and last but not least, Madis Maasing produced the index. I’m extremely grateful to everyone who has supported, collaborated, and provided encouragement throughout the course of this work.\n\nList of Abbreviations AR Akten und Rezesse der livländischen Ständetage AV Analecta Vaticana BD Bullarium Danicum BGP Die Berichte der Generalprokuratoren des Deutschen Ordens BLDR Библиотека литературы Древней Руси DG Древнейшие государства на территории СССР.

Consequently, this period is crucial for determining the way in which these groups and the modern states now occupying this space view their history. On an even larger scale, the subject is also linked to the formation of both Catholic Europe and the Orthodox world as well as the relationship between them. The Baltic is an area that has been disputed by various political powers across the centuries, and this tension is reflected in the historiography, both in terms of volume and approach. The amount of literature devoted to the region, either as its main subject or just tangentially, and the variety of points of view and interpretation are vast. Authors in this field have tended to be swayed more by their own personal political and ideological prejudices than by the actual source material or professional standards of scholarship. This is regardless of whether the subject of their research is the establishment of the German colony in Livonia, the end of the Estonians’ and Letts’ age-old freedoms, the defence of Russia, or simply an episode in the history of the crusades.1 This tendency had been established by the 15th and 16th centuries at the very latest, when Russia and its immediate western neighbours each portrayed themselves as the victim of the other’s unjust aggression. This perspective found expression in the 15th- and 16th-century chronicles from Livonia and elsewhere in eastern European on the one hand, and the Russian chronicles (летописи) on the other, all of which gave accounts not only of contemporary events but those from the more distant past as well. These works, most notably the 16thcentury Russian Nikon Chronicle (Никоновская летопись) and the chronicle of the Reval pastor Balthasar Russow (d. 1600), in turn served as the basis for the first scholarly investigations in the 18th and 19th centuries, resulting in the creation of certain historiographical traditions some of which have continued 1 For recent studies in English on the modern concept of the Baltic crusades, see Linda Kaljundi, “The Chronicler and the Modern World: Henry of Livonia and the Baltic Crusades in the Enlightenment and National Traditions,” in Crusading and Chronicle Writing on the Medieval Baltic Frontier.

A distinctly unforgiving tone skewed the writings of many scholars from the outset, who often saw themselves as the descendants of one of the medieval powers from this region. From the end of the 12th century onwards various Catholic powers organized military expeditions and crusades against the pagans in the Baltic. This had the consequence of bringing the conquerors of these lands into conflict with Rus’ and its various principalities. This development raises a whole series of questions. Was this confrontation merely a by-product of the war against the pagans or did the crusaders harbour secret plans from the beginning of gaining control of Russian territories as well, or perhaps even the whole of Rus’? Who were these crusades initiated by: popes and emperors, or local ­powers? Were they a Scandinavian, Livonian or German enterprise? The different ways in which these questions have been answered have determined the different points of departure adopted by historians, ranging from detailed and carefully researched studies on specific questions, eschewing generalization, to free adaptations of the historical facts to preconceived schema. One of the most influential interpretations was the dictum of Drang nach Osten (‘push to the East’), condemning what was seen as the German tradition of eastward expansion. This notion originated in Polish and Russian journalism in the second half of the 19th century, but was then adopted by German authors, who transformed it into a positive development as a crucial stage in German cultural dominance of the area.2 The political struggles and conflicts of the 20th century gave renewed impetus to the East-West dichotomy, one of whose consequences was the enthusiastic reception given to the idea of heroic resistance against Western aggressors in the Russian tradition and those derived from it. The saintly Russian grand prince Aleksandr Nevskii (d. 1263) and the Livonian master of the Teutonic Order Wolter von Plettenberg (d. 1535) in particular served as symbolic figures used by many writers to project their contemporary ideas of the enemy onto Livonian-Russian relations in the past.3 Above all in the past few decades the so-called pluralist use of the term ‘crusades’ has started to prevail as a result of the increasing influence of AngloAmerican historiography in general and its impact on the history of the Baltic 2 Wolfgang Wippermann, Der ‘Deutsche Drang nach Osten’.

According to this approach, the term ‘crusade’ refers not just to the crusades in the Holy Land but to all wars based on the same ideology as the crusades.4 Thanks to this line of research it has become possible to move away from the narrowly defined national scholarly traditions. A closer look at these different historiographical tendencies (which cannot, of course, be completely separated from one another) must first examine what is known as the ‘patriotic’ Russian school of thought.5 Here the past is examined from the perspective of a strong Russian centralized power and its aim of territorial expansion. A key component is veneration of Prince Aleksandr Iaroslavich, better known as Aleksandr Nevskii,6 while the Catholic or ‘German’ camp is portrayed as the aggressor. In both the ecclesiastical Orthodox and secular strands of this tradition it was claimed that the pope and the Catholic church as a whole, depicted as a powerful, cruel and ruthless institution motivated purely by self-interest, were behind the eastward aggression. The wars to propagate Catholicism in the area now comprising modern Estonia, Latvia, and Finland, bearing in mind that these countries were ruled by Rus’ in the 12th century, must have been aimed from the beginning against Rus’ and the Orthodox church since the pagan peoples of the Baltic region were too weak to be the real target of the aggressors. Even just temporary agreements between individual Russian territories and the Catholics are seen as ill-fated and fraught 4 Edgar N. Johnson, “The German Crusade on the Baltic,” in A History of the Crusades, ed. Kenneth M. Setton, vol. 3: The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries, ed. Harry W.

Such a view of history has been propounded by modern scholars such as George Vernadsky (1887–1973), Vladimir Pashuto (1918–83), and Igor Shaskolskii (1918–95), as well as by Patriarch Aleksii of Moscow (1929–2008),7 to name only a few.8 The hypothesis of Western aggression allows authors to explain everything that happened with a view to supporting the desired conclusion. For example, the Russian archaeologist Elena Rybina, the author of a series of notable works on the economic history of Novgorod, explained the changing pattern in the importation of western European goods to Novgorod as identified based on the archaeological evidence as follows: if a particular commodity turns up in the archaeological finds less frequently in the 13th century than previously, this can be attributed to Western aggression in the Baltic; however, if it turns up more frequently, then this means that merchants refused to be affected by the aggressive policies of Western rulers.9 A fascinating aspect of this now virtually abandoned school of thought is how it was perfected to the level of absolute absurdity in the period from about 1940 to the end of the 1960s in the works not of Russian authors, but historians from the countries conquered by or dependent upon the Soviet Union. Its most extreme form can be found in the East German-based Austrian historian Eduard Winter (1896–1982). One of his works includes such chapter headings as ‘The Papacy’s General Attack on Rus’,’ (Der Generalangriff des Papsttums auf die Rus’) or ‘Rus’ in a Pincer Attack between East and West’ (Die Rus’ im konzentrischen Angriff von Ost und West). The tract in question describes the plans of the popes, together with another force called ‘feudalism’ but not defined in greater detail, to conquer Rus’. It was in pursuit of this objective, according to Winter, that the popes aimed to establish a papal state in the Baltic and thereby surround Rus’ with aggressive Catholic territories in that region, just as they allegedly tried to do in the Balkans and Poland. The popes were supposedly working in close alliance with the Mongols, whose invasions made it impossible for the Russians to drive the Germans from Livonia. Pagan Lithuania was, so the argument goes, later used as a tool by the popes against Rus’.10 The 7 Aleksii II (Ridiger), Православие в Эстонии (Moscow, 1999), pp. 6–67. 8 See the bibliography in Natalia A.

The analysis of events is often appropriated here to argue for the purported ‘Germanness’ of these cultures. In addition, the tradition of legal scholarship within this strand overestimated the formal juridical aspects present in the medieval sources by regarding 13th-century papal bulls and princely correspondence as equivalent to modern legislation. According to this perspective, the areas recently converted to Christianity were then faced, in defence of Western culture, with repelling the ‘savage attack’ from the East; or, to put it more diplomatically, the influence of the Orthodox religion was feared in Livonia and the hope was that Catholicism could be spread east of Lake Peipus. This approach had certain similarities to the pan-Russian school of thought in its presentation of the facts and even in the hypotheses based on them, but differed in the emotional tone of the narrative, value judgements, and, of course, by providing a different answer to the question of who was the aggressor. A crucial role was attributed to the Roman curia in these versions too. As well as encompassing the Baltic German tradition, particular mention should be made of the contribution of the Finnish and Finnish-Swedish historians Jalmari Jaakkola (1885–1964), and Gustav Adolf Donner (1902–40) to this interpretation. Jaakkola argued that there had been a permanent ‘eastern crisis’ in the relations between Rus’ and the West from the end of the 1230s until 1270.15 In Estonia Hendrik Sepp (1888–1943), writing in the period between the two world wars, claimed it had been a tragedy that the expansion led by the Roman curia had not been capable of saving the Finnish peoples east of the Baltic from Russian rule and the consequent Russification that this entailed in the modern era.16 A series of rather more marginal historical approaches were developed roughly along the lines of these overarching schema. The Estonian folklorist Oskar Loorits (1900–61), who had a distinctly hostile attitude towards the West and the Germanic peoples, contrasted what he called the German mission by sword with a peaceful Orthodox mission, which, according to him, was distinguished by its great spiritual force, and also considered the Christianization of 15 See the overview provided by Jukka Korpela, “‘The Russian Threat Against Finland’ in the Western Sources Before the Peace of Noteborg (1323),” Scandinavian Journal of History 22 (1997), 161–62. 16 Hendrik Sepp, “Eesti idapiiri kaitse kuni 15. sajandi keskeni,” Sõdur 12 (1930), 123–27.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nLivonia to be part of the conflict between Rome and Constantinople.17 In addition, in a more restricted context, a succession of authors have portrayed the hero of their particular study, whether Bishop Albert of Riga,18 the papal legate William of Modena,19 Bishop Thomas of Finland20 or the Order of the Sword Brothers,21 as the instigator and master of events. This picture of aggression, animosity, and conflict has begun to break down in the historical studies published since the 1980s. One of the pioneers of this development was the German historian of Baltic-German origin Manfred Hellmann (1912–1992).22 It is above all Norbert Angermann and his pupils who have made a notable contribution in this direction.23 In Russia, recent discussion has focused mainly on the significance of the Battle of the Ice at Lake Peipus (1242). This was triggered to a large extent by the publication, in 1989, of the Russian translation of the book by John Fennell (1918–92) on Rus’ in the 13th century.24 Despite the fact that many scholars have not been able to come\n\n17 Oskar Loorits, “Zur christlichen Terminologie bei den Esten, Liven und Letten,” Trames.

It is perhaps inevitable that the quality of the older publications does not generally meet modern standards, but most editions can still be used as long as the research subject lies outside the philological or diplomatic field. A large volume of the documents published by earlier historians has subsequently been reedited, usually with much greater precision in those cases where it was possible to use the original documents and not just early printed editions. The majority of the charters and letters relating to Livonia were published as part of the series Liv-, Est- und Kurländisches Urkundenbuch started by Friedrich Georg von Bunge (1802–97) in 1853; the material for the 12th to 14th centuries is contained in the first four volumes and the sixth volume. The central place in medieval Livonia’s chronicle writing is held by the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia, written in Latin. Henry of Livonia, the priest thought to be the author of the chronicle, is likely to have come from the area of Magdeburg to Livonia c. 1205.27 He personally took part in a number of military and mission25 See for example the discussion in Древний Псков.

There is still no consensus about why Henry began to write the chronicle c. 1224, completing it in 1227.28 Its tone at least is distinctly apologetic insofar as it justifies the privileges and merits of the Rigan church as against those of Denmark and other rivals. Although it is based to a large extent on Henry’s own memory of events, the author must certainly also have used charters and other records. Indeed, the chronicle stands out for its precise chronology, generally accepted as reliable, which is based largely on the calculation of Bishop Albert’s years in office. Its oldest surviving manuscript, which was the main source used by Leonid Arbusow Jr (1882–1951) in his reconstruction of the original text, dates from the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries.29 The other Livonian chronicle from the 13th century, the older Livonian Rhymed Chronicle written in Middle High German, narrates the history of Livonia up to about 1290 in 12,017 lines. This chronicle emanates from the milieu of the Teutonic Order; it was written by a Teutonic Knight based in Livonia during the last quarter of the 13th century and thus reflects late 13thcentury attitudes. Its narrative revolves around the battles with the pagans and the exaltation of military virtue. It was traditionally classified as an example of what is known as a Tischbuch, which was read out at the communal meals of the brothers. Recent research suggests, however, that its original purpose might have been to help the Order recruit external troops for crusades, an interpretation which would in turn explain the important role ascribed in the narrative to crusaders who did not belong to the Order.30 Apart from of Western Civilization); The Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, trans.

It has been suggested based on the fact that the bishops of Dorpat are mentioned in some episodes that the chronicler also drew on the hypothetical ‘Dorpat Annals’.31 But the Order’s own activity is also described in these sections of the ­narrative—relating to the military campaigns of 1240 and 1268—making such an explanation unnecessary, while on the other hand it has not been proven that the ‘Dorpat Annals’ ever existed. A considerably more complex problem is posed by the tradition of Old Russian narrative sources and their research history. In some cases, the Old Russian chronicles (летописи) are annals continually kept up to date or containing short intervals. These chronicles were sometimes corrected or added to, either when the manuscripts were transcribed or a particular entry was deleted or corrected. In most cases, however, the variants of the летописи that have come down to us are reworked and consolidated versions of several chronicle traditions.32 The most important Old Russian source for Livonian history in the 13th century is the older recension of the so-called First Novgorod Chronicle.33 This chronicle is practically contemporary to the events it describes. The first part of the surviving manuscript, with entries up to 1234, was recorded in the second half of the of the 13th century, while the following part dates to c. 1330, with entries up to then and some later additions.

Other 15th-century chronicles also contain the information found in the same tradition with slight changes and additions based on another, no longer known source.34 The main original source of the chronicles was provided by the annals continued by scribes of the archbishop of Novgorod.35 The original text for the years 1226–74 relevant to this study was apparently written by the sacristan Timofei, who famously referred to himself in the chronicle.36 Whereas the style of the Russian chronicles of the 13th century is generally extremely concise—containing only brief reports about events deemed important—Timofei used a series of literary models as the basis for his descriptions. It has been argued that his writing style, which is adorned with a plethora of moralistic epithets, also bears some relation to the conventions used in hagiographic texts.37 The chronicles of Pskov are extant in manuscripts from the 15th to 18th centuries, but contain only scattered local references dating back to the mid13th century. Earlier events have been described at a later date based on other sources such as the Novgorod chronicles and hagiographic accounts. A continuous narrative does not begin until 1323, when its main subject is the military clashes with Livonia.38 A special place in the Russian sources is assumed by two Old Russian vitae, those of Prince Aleksandr Iaroslavich39 and Prince Dovmont,40 both of which refer to Livonian history in the 13th century. Aleksandr Iaroslavich’s vita was 34 E.g. Новгородская четвертая летопись, ed. Fedor I. Pokrovskii et al. (Moscow, 2000) (PSRL 4/1); Софийская первая летопись старшего извода, ed. Boris M.

The text of the vita known to us today is also likely to contain traces of the Novgorod tradition.43 Aleksandr Iaroslavich’s vita was already known in Pskov at the end of the 13th century, attaining some popularity there, and was used as a model in the writing of a similar regional vita, that of Prince Dovmont of Pskov in the second quarter of the 14th century.44 The focus of this study is the 13th century. In this case it is a ‘long’ 13th century, however, since the period under consideration stretches from the 1180s to the 1320s and the portrayal of Rus’ in the Livonian sources is examined up to the middle of the 14th century. The book’s structure is determined by the course of historical events, on the one hand, providing it with its chronological layout, while an analysis of the different historiographical traditions also provides certain points of intersection. Most of the historical scholarship in this field takes the view, as discussed above, that there was a divide and ideological antagonism between the Eastern and Western worlds, regardless of whether this is seen as the prerequisite for, or result of, events in the 13th century. This study sets out to examine whether such antagonism did in fact exist, by what mechanisms it arose, and how—to the extent that it did exist—it manifested itself and was used at the time. The work follows the sequence of recorded events while also comparing the source texts, allowing not just the event itself but also the intention of the relevant source to be analysed. From the end of the 12th century onwards the centres of political power in the various Scandinavian and north German territories gradually began to bring the area known by consensus as ‘Livonia’ in the historiography under their sovereignty. This entailed simultaneously both contact and conflict with 41 Begunov, Памятник, pp. 57–61. See also Lur’e, Россия, pp. 105–08. 42 Vladimir A.

Livonia was considered by the Catholics as a land settled by ‘pagan tribes’; Rus’, while Christian, was regarded as a schismatic nation. The campaigns against the pagans were seen as crusades in West European culture and society. The question is whether this crusade ideology was also extended to the military clashes with Rus’, and if so, in what cases. A further issue is how the neighbouring Russian rulers actually responded to the crusades in the Baltic lands. What powers in Catholic Europe might have been interested in a conflict with Rus’ and what means did they have of manipulating this conflict? Can the political situation be described as an opposition between different religious confessions or, to put it another way, was politics determined by a conflict between different confessions? Before discussing the possibility of a crusade against Rus’ in Livonia, however, it must first be shown that the conditions necessary for a military conflict between Catholic Europe and Rus’ were present. In the 12th and 13th centuries the criteria for a crusade were designed and formulated within a complex system of rules and practices. From the perspective of Livonian history, it must be asked whether it was possible to adapt these legal criteria, ceremonies, and language to the wars against Rus’ and whether there is any evidence of this in the sources. This study thus has certain points of contact with the study of images and the way in which foreign lands and peoples are imagined and the ‘Other’ is constructed. However, it should be noted that an investigation solely of the ‘image’ of an adjoining region runs the risk of confining itself to generalizations with little concrete substance and which tend to express the historian’s idealized vision rather than the situation as it was in the past. The sources, which are primarily of a political nature, indeed provide no more than fragmentary glimpses of the image held of the neighbouring region. Moreover, it must be remembered that these fragments were recorded in the context of specific disputes: they often do not provide evidence of widely held views, but rather express isolated polemical attitudes. Consequently, when scholars attempt to understand the reasons for what they see as an outsider’s supposedly distorted idea of their country during some period in history, in this case in the Middle Ages, there is always the risk of self-projection in which the scholars see themselves as the victims of an unfair image. The aim of examining the expressions found in the sources in the context of contemporary political relationships is to make it possible to be more precise when looking at descriptions of, or references to, neighbouring peoples. This is because the sources drawn upon to investigate the image of the other are at the same time, and indeed primarily, sources on contemporary politics. It must also be taken into account that the ‘crusading literature’ that originated in north-eastern Europe in the 12th and\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\n13th ­centuries used language and interpretive frameworks already available from the traditions of Latin written culture. ‘A new world’ was thus put ‘into old words’,45 also with the aim of making it intelligible to readers in ‘Old Europe’. The ethnonyms used in this work, such as ‘Estonians’, ‘Germans’, ‘Russians’ etc., do not designate the modern nations, but ethnic and political groups, just as they do in the sources, and for that reason they are inevitably just as vague and generalizing. Indeed, the same applies to the term ‘pagans’, which in some contemporary sources refers to a political rather than a religious community (see p. 72). Choosing the terms to describe the different political interest groups is not without its complications. ‘Livonia’ as used here refers not to the area of settlement of the Livs, but to the whole of Livonia, which generally coincided from the 14th to 16th centuries with the territories of the modern republics of Estonia and Latvia. As regards the 13th century, however, it was only during the process of the different conquests and alliances that the territory of medieval Livonia eventually came to be defined. Consequently, for this earlier period ‘Livonia’ refers to that part of the future medieval territory of Livonia which had already been conquered or brought under control by the Catholic powers, with the result that the geographical area covered by the term shifts over the chronological period covered in this work and comes to designate a larger territory at the end than at the beginning. Livonia at the end of the 12th century initially meant no more than the area in which Bishop Meinhard was active. The success of the crusaders, the bishop’s vassals, and the Sword Brothers who set out from the city of Riga, just founded in 1201, led to the defeat of the Livs by 1207 and of the principality of Kokenhusen shortly afterwards. The Order entered into an alliance in 1208 with the Lettgallians of Tolowa, while in 1209 the prince of Gerzike was obliged to become a vassal of the bishop of Riga. The conquest of the south-east of the country began in 1208 and was completed by 1216. The Rigans were suddenly pushed back by the Estonians, but then went on to complete the subjection of mainland Estonia, following a major uprising by the Estonians in 1224, along with the Danes, who were involved in military operations in Estonia continually from 1219 onwards. Ösel was defeated in 1227, although several rebellions took place there later. Driven by the threat of famine, the Curonians surrendered to the papal vice-legate Baldwin in 1230–31. The Livonian army was 45 Marek Tamm, “A New World into Old Words: The Eastern Baltic Region and the Cultural Geography of Medieval Europe,” in The Clash of Cultures on the Medieval Baltic Frontier, ed. Alan V. Murray (Farnham, 2009), pp. 11–35; Marek Tamm, “Inventing Livonia: The Name and Fame of a New Christian Colony on the Medieval Baltic Frontier,” ZfO 60 (2011), 186–209.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\ndefeated at the Battle of Saule in 1236 by the Lithuanians and the Semgallians. As a consequence, in the 1240s it was necessary to defeat the Curonians again and sometime later the Selonians and the Semgallians were also conquered. The crusaders suffered a further defeat at the Battle of Durben in 1260, but the Curonians and Semgallians were finally conquered by 1290. These, very roughly, were the main phases in the military conquest of Livonia by the crusaders. In the 13th and 14th centuries Livonia consisted of a conglomerate of independent powers. These were the Rigan church and its bishops and, later on, archbishops, other Livonian bishoprics, the Danish king and his representatives in northern Estonia, the Order of the Sword Brothers (until 1237), the Teutonic Order and, in the early part of this period, indigenous rulers too. These protagonists were later joined by the Livonian trading towns, which originated in the 13th century. It was therefore the exception rather than the rule for the different Livonian forces to work together. On the other hand, a number of Russian and Livonian powers did have common interests and would occasionally form alliances in pursuit of these. The question must even be raised as to what extent Livonia and Rus’ actually represented distinct societies and cultures during the early 13th century, confronting each other as internally cohesive entities.46 The entity known as Rus’ essentially comprised the lands ruled by the members of the Riurikid dynasty. This house of Scandinavian origin established its rule in the vast area along the rivers from the Baltic to the Black Sea during the 9th and 10th centuries. The head of the princely family resided in Kiev, where Prince Vladimir Sviatoslavich (d. 1015) adopted Christianity from Byzantium in 988. Even though the Riurikid princes still ruled Rus’, the realm gathered around this dynasty had long ceased to form a political unity in the 13th century. The grand princes of Kiev had forfeited their central position and had been replaced by new regional centres and dynasties by the 12th century. Although all these dynasties descended from the house of Riurik, they fought among themselves 46 On the concept of the ‘frontier society’ in medieval Europe that has become popular in recent years, see, for example, Medieval Frontier Societies, ed.

The areas controlled by these centres were themselves sometimes split up into smaller, more or less dependent principalities governed by the younger members of the princely line. Rulership in the Russian principalities was generally based on two models: either governing power was handed down, according to age, from the elder brother to the younger or from father to son (Suzdal), or the local town had the main role, appointing the prince, whose power was limited (Novgorod). The social structure and the ways in which decisions were reached internally in many of the Russian principalities during the High Middle Ages remains largely hypothetical, however. The number of written sources is often very limited or indeed lacking in the case of several territories. Apart from the princes themselves, the aristocracy (boyars) played an important role and also controlled the towns. Towns with communal government or institutions were unknown in Russia; merchants and craftsmen generally remained dependent on the nobility even when they were personally free. Even where the Veche, the meeting of free town inhabitants, played the decisive role in Novgorod and elsewhere, these towns still cannot be considered communes in the Western European sense since they did not include a legal definition of the citizenry or communal legislation. As Kiev lost its former importance, Chernigov und Volhynia came to prominence in western Rus’. The princes of Volhynia were the rivals of the other Russian princely houses, as well as of the Polish and Hungarian rulers. They succeeded in subjugating another western principality, Galicia, c. 1200. However, due to internal conflicts and external claimants to the princely throne, the power of the Volhynian house became consolidated only by the middle of the 13th century, by which time it was in a position to play the role of mightiest Russian principality in the west. Chernigov for its part was the main centre east of the Dniepr. Despite its fragmentation into smaller semi-­independent principalities in the 12th century, the princes of Chernigov managed ­effectively to control the area and participate in dynastic struggles in Russia until the Mongol conquest. The region from which the rivers Dniepr, Volga, and Daugava originate was in turn the location of the principality of Smolensk. The independence of its princely line was established by the middle of the 12th century, when Smolensk became one of the main economic and cultural centres of Rus’. During its heyday from the 1160s to the 1230s Smolensk and its princes were able to influence actively the political developments in Rus’ and partly to control the smaller neighbouring principalities. By far the most powerful rulers in northern Rus’ in the 12th and 13th centuries, however, were the grand princes of Vladimir, of the Rostov-Suzdal dynasty.\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nThis area began to emerge as one of the core territories of Rus’ at this time. At first Suzdal and then from the 1150s onwards, Vladimir, were the residences of princes, developing into prominent towns of commerce and crafts. Vsevolod Iur’evich ‘Big Nest’ (‘Bolshoe Gnezdo’, 1177–1212) became the permanent holder of the title of grand prince of Vladimir. As a territory that had been recently colonized, the area lacked a well-established nobility with the result that princely power had fewer limitations than elsewhere in Rus’. By contrast, Novgorod in the north-west had a different social and political structure. Novgorod was already a large town in the Viking Age, collecting tribute—mainly furs—from the extensive forests in the north and north-east. The town community was dominated by aristocratic landowners (boyars), but could express its political will in the Veche which elected the leaders of the town community, the posadnik and tysiatskii. In the 12th and 13th centuries the posadnik was elected from among boyars for an unspecified time period, and acted as mayor of the city. Commoners were represented by the tysiatskii who originally commanded the militia, but was now mainly involved in the organisation of trade, as well as in commercial adjudication and taxation. From the 1150s onwards the archbishop of Novgorod ceased to be appointed by the metropolitan of Kiev but was elected from the local clergy. The archbishop was not only the leader of the church but also the highest political representative of the community. The community invited the prince to lead the army and administer justice. However, if there was a conflict between the community and the prince, the former could expel the latter. This accounts for the sometimes extremely frequent changes of prince in the town. To the west of Novgorod was the small territory of Pskov, which still managed to play a key role in Livonia’s history. It consisted of a rather narrow land strip along the eastern coast of Narva River and Lake Peipus, and the Velikaya River basin in the south. Water bodies and poorly settled areas formed a division between Pskov and the Livonian lands. However, it was the main, more than 300 kilometers long frontier of medieval Livonia against Rus’ where several border conflicts occurred, especially during the 14th–15th centuries. The governmental system of Pskov was similar to that of Novgorod. To the west of Smolensk between the Daugava and the Dniepr rivers lay the region of Polotsk-Vitebsk. Polotsk emerged as a centre of Scandinavian chieftains where in the late 10th century a branch of the Riurikid family secured its rule. After its cultural and economival heyday in the second half of the 11th century, Polotsk split into smaller principalities by the end of the 12th century. A significant role among them played Vitebsk (see p. 78). The principalities of Ryazan and Pereiaslav bordered on the steppes in the south-east. Despite the fact that in this work the term Rus’ is used to refer to the entire eastern Slavonic\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nworld from Halych to Vladimir and from Novgorod to Ryazan, far from constituting a political unity, this area was extremely heterogeneous in political, ethnic, and even religious terms throughout this period. From 1236 to 1242 Rus’ was conquered by the Mongols, apart from Novgorod, Pskov, Smolensk, and Polotsk. Novgorod and Smolensk were forced to pay the Mongols tribute sometime later but only for a short time and as the very consequence of the policies of the Russian princes. During the 1250s a relationship of interdependency between the Russian princes and their Mongol rulers developed in which particular importance was assumed by the rivalry between the Russian princes to secure the title of grand prince of Vladimir and to obtain the accompanying patent from the Khan, the iarlyk. The princes of north-eastern Rus’ (Suzdal and Pereiaslav, and later Moscow) and Tver (principality detached from Pereiaslav in the 1240s) competed for this honour. In western Rus’ the influence of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania spread quickly from the second half of the 13th century. The pagan dynasty of Lithuania began to control politically a conglomerate of Rus’ lands which simultaneously preserved some degree of autonomy and often also the local rule of its traditional Riurikid princely family. Thus various branches of the Russian ruling house, various princes, and various centres of power fought in defence of their own interests. The historiographical tradition that regards the formation of a central power stretching across this area as a strength and an objective pursued by the historical development of Rus’ did not emerge until much later on. Although the region belonged together by virtue of historical tradition, ecclesiastical organization, literary language, and culture, almost exactly the same can be said of Catholic Europe and it did not develop into a single unitary state. Even the dialects of Old Russian reveal quite major differences, much greater than the written variants.47 Rus’, Livonia, and Catholic Europe were thus anything but unified entities in the 13th century. This aspect has far too often been neglected in historical studies to date. The aim of this work, in contrast, is to investigate these questions, above all based on the relationships between local and regional powers. It was these specific relationships that ultimately shaped the relations between Latin Europe as a whole and Rus’ as a whole, and between Catholicism and Russian Orthodoxy, not vice versa. It thus transpires that the decisive roles were played not by the popes, emperors, or other individuals at the top of the hierarchy in faraway countries, but by the people taking decisions locally and able to take account of local requirements and conditions. This is not to say that Livonia 47 See Andrej A. Zalizniak, Древненовгородский диалект (Moscow, 1995) (Язык. Семиотика. Культура), pp. 3–5.\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nand its closest neighbours in Rus’ can be dealt with completely in isolation from wider European developments. During certain periods Livonian politics was linked to a greater or lesser extent with the areas to the north and south of it, with western Rus’, Poland, and Prussia, not to mention influenced by relations between the Finnish and Swedish regions and Novgorod. At least this should be assumed as a starting point. In investigating these actual links and those taken for granted in the historiography, and parallel developments, this work will also have to touch upon, without going into detail, specific issues in the history of south-western Rus’ and Karelia, particularly as they relate to the period from the 1230s to the 1250s. It is nevertheless hoped that these occasional and unavoidable digressions will not detract from the main thrust of the narrative: the relations between the different powers on the ground.\n\nchapter 1\n\nThe Religious Frontier in Eastern Europe in the Twelfth Century 1.1\n\nThe Schism and the Russian Church\n\nTwo different Christian confessions faced one another in the conflicts that took place in and over Livonia in the 13th century: the Roman Catholic church of the crusaders, vassals, merchants, and ecclesiastics who had come from the West, and the Russian Orthodox church. According to the conventional view, the division between the Latin and Greek churches was the result of the mutual excommunication each imposed on the other’s hierarchy in 1054. It is precisely in this acrimonious context, it is argued, that the history of the Baltic region in the 12th and 13th centuries must be seen. The flagship date of 1054 is one of those, however, that did not actually acquire its symbolic significance as a historical turning point until much later, namely in the 19th century. The doctrinal and liturgical differences between the Eastern and Western churches together with the accusations of heresy on both sides were already present earlier on in the Middle Ages. Yet these differences were not in any case what caused the split: the reasons behind the schism and how it became entrenched were mainly political in nature. Nor was there any indication in the mid-11th century that the rift would be lasting. The church of Rome never gave up its aim of bringing the Greeks under papal authority. While the crusades served to intensify contact between the different Christian communities, the ensuing political conflict was dressed in religious tones. As far as the deterioration in the relations between the Eastern and the Western churches is concerned, the turning point is seen as the Second Crusade (1147–54), which ended to the West’s disadvantage. Perhaps it became more difficult to consider one another as fellow Christians just at the moment when Byzantium made peace with the Seljuks, who had, after all, defeated the crusaders, and just when the Catholic king Roger II of Sicily (1105–54) fought alongside Muslim Egypt against Byzantium. Any chance of reconciliation was thwarted once and for all when Constantinople was conquered in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade. This was when the difference in faith undoubtedly became the symbol of political conflict. Even though most of the Greek clergy continued in their positions after the foundation of the Latin Empire, they did not accept the election of a Latin patriarch of Constantinople, Thomas Morosini (elected 1204), after the © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���5 | doi ��.��63/9789004284753_003\n\nReligious Frontier in Eastern Europe in the Twelfth Century\n\n21\n\ndeath of the previous patriarch John Kamateros in 1206. The bishops who fled to Nicaea elected the Orthodox patriarch Michael Autoreianos (1208–14) in 1208, who was also recognized by the Russian church. Rome’s attempts to overcome the split and bring the Greek ‘schismatics’ under its authority continued unabated: the curia in any case considered that the Greek church was already subject to the Roman obedience as a result of the events of 1204.1 According to Georgii Avvakumov, what was at issue in the 12th and 13th centuries was an ambivalence on the part of Catholic theologians even to recognize the Eastern church as a Christian one combined with “Rome’s political practice of ‘tolerant non-recognition’ ”.2 The relations between Rome and Constantinople and/or Nicaea were in turn reflected in the relations between the Latin church and the regional Orthodox churches. Political causes can be identified even in the conclusion and collapse of ecclesiastical unions with some of these churches. The relevant treaties were not even agreed with the spiritual, but with the secular rulers. Thus in 1204 Innocent III sent a royal crown to the Bulgarian ruler Kaloyan (1197–1207) and Honorius III sent one to the Serbian ruler Stefan Nemanjić (d. 1228) instead of discussing the union with the relevant church hierarchies. Both of these ecclesiastical ‘unions’ fell apart extremely quickly, however; in the case of the Serbs, almost immediately.3 Just as in the history of the Byzantine mother church, there is no consensus in the history of the Russian Orthodox church about when the schism began to take effect and become an important factor in those areas of eastern Europe where the different faiths came into contact. It has been argued the Latin faithful were considered schismatics by Rus’ as early as the 11th and 12th centuries.4 Yet there are counter-examples suggesting the opposite. There are episodes in Old Russian literature in which the Russians (i.e. the Orthodox) and the Latins form a common front against the pagans.5 The author of the original text of the 1 Axel Bayer, Spaltung der Christenheit.

When the Kievan prince Vladimir Sviatoslavich (d. 1015) adopted Christianity from Byzantium in 988, by no means the entire region under his dominion was baptized. The Christianization of Rus’ took several centuries and was still far from complete in the 13th century. A number of pagan tribes also inhabited the lands ruled by Russian princes. Pagan shrines existed side by side with Christian churches even as late as the 13th century, not only in the nonSlavonic periphery, but also in many purely Russian areas. Not until after the Mongol invasions was the word крестьяне introduced, meaning ‘people of Christ’, to describe the Russian villagers.8 To grasp the schism and its doctrinal causes and fundamentals ordinary people would need a reasonable knowledge of Christianity and a basic level of education. But, with the exception of the clergy, this could hardly be expected of a population at Europe’s periphery, where there were still few Christian institutions, and given such slow and haphazard internal Christianization. It follows therefore that any anti-Roman polemical literature produced by the Russian church was not of local origin. Such literature borrows from Byzantine models and was propagated in Rus’ by the Kievan metropolitans of Greek origin and by the clergy in their entourage. In the 13th century this type of literature virtually disappeared from the Old Russian tradition altogether, coinciding as it did with the continuing decline\n\nGeburtstag von Günther Stökl, ed.

Moreover, it must be questioned to what extent the medieval legal codes often cited as evidence of hostility actually reflect everyday life in the first place. For example, the extended version of the Old Russian ‘Church Statute of Iaroslav’ (Устав князя Ярослава о церковных судах) from the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries forbids, under threat of punishment, eating and drinking with non-­Christians and those of other faiths or with foreigners.11 Such decrees originated in early Christian literature. It is not clear whether the Russian clerics who worked on their redaction understood those of other faiths and non-Christians to include other Christians as well or just Muslims and pagans.12 Feodosii (d. 1074), one of the founders of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves), described\n\n9 See Andrei Popov, Историко-литературный обзор древне-русских полемических сочинений против латинян (XI–XV в.)

They do not hold the right beliefs and do not live purely: they eat with cats and dogs, drink their own piss, eat turtles and wild horses and donkeys and anything that has been strangled, and carrion and bear flesh and beavers and beaver tail in Lent. Yet even this epistle, although hardly likely to have had a significant influence on contemporaries, was motivated by political concerns, namely Prince Iziaslav’s use, in 1069, of Polish forces to help defeat his opponents in Kiev.13 Moreover, writings hostile to Catholicism focused less on doctrinal differences than differences in custom. The proposition that the reality of the religious frontier should not be exaggerated is also supported by the fact that the Russian church celebrated saints and feast days either not recognized by Byzantium or even initially viewed with hostility. An example of this was the Feast of the Translation of the Relics of St Nicholas on 9 May. This reliquary was brought from Myra (modern Demre, Turkey), which had been plundered by the Seljuks, to Bari in southern Italy in 1087. Since, as far as the Greeks were concerned, this meant that the relics had been stolen, there is no way in which the Russian church could possibly have adopted this feast day from Byzantium.14 If it can be argued that it took centuries for the schism to become part of the general consciousness even in the countries of the Mediterranean, this must surely apply even more so as regards its impact on religious differences and their perception in north-eastern Europe. Northern Europe as a whole was still a politically and culturally integrated area in the 11th century, regardless of religious denomination. Nor did the contacts established through dynastic relations and trade break down after the mid-11th century when the schism occurred. Some scholars have gone so far as to suggest that there was even a mission from Byzantium and Rus’ to Sweden, specifically Uppland, in the 13 Igor P. Eremin, “Литературное наследие Феодосия Печерского,” in Труды Отдела древне-русской литературы Института литературы АН СССР 5 (1947), 159–62, quoted from p. 170–71. The letter’s date and authorship are far from settled; it has also been suggested that its author is actually a 12th-century monk known as Feodosii the Greek. See Viktor Aleksandrov, “То же и с латины: Запрет браков с католиками у православных славян в средние века,” Studia Slavica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 47 (2002), 102–03. Feodosii’s anti-Catholic accusations belong within the Greek tradition. Iziaslav’s mother was Swedish and his wife of Polish descent. 14 Shchapov, Государство, p. 172.\n\nReligious Frontier in Eastern Europe in the Twelfth Century\n\n25\n\n11th century.15 The archaeological finds of artefacts with Byzantine influences would seem to point not so much to a mission from Byzantium to Sweden, however, than to the high regard in which Byzantium was held in Scandinavian society and the symbolic value of objects from its material culture. In other words, people who otherwise observed Catholic rituals saw nothing contradictory in using objects from the cultural sphere of the Eastern church.16 The Varangians and their successors for their part transmitted what might be loosely termed ‘Catholic’ influence to Rus’, above all in the nearby Novgorod area. There was still a certain ‘common denominator’ between Scandinavian and Old Russian ecclesiastical culture in the 12th century.17 Its most striking example was the cult of a Catholic saint in Novgorod, that of the Norwegian king Olaf the Holy (d. 1030). Many of the miracles worked by the saint took place in Rus’ according to his vita. It is noteworthy that most of these miraculous deeds affected Novgorod’s native population.18 A spiritual text written in Rus’ sometime in the middle of the 12th century mentions a whole series of martyrs and saints from the Roman Catholic world, mostly Scandinavians such as Magnus Erlendsson (d. 1115), Knud the Holy and his brother Benedict (d. 1086), Alban (3rd century), Olaf, and Botulf (d. 680).19 Scandinavia’s 15 John H.

These answers reflect religious practices and throw light on everyday life in the Novgorod church at the time. In response to the question about what ought to be done when someone baptized in the Latin faith wanted to come “to us” (к намь) comes the reply that one should treat the ‘church changer’ in the same way as a neophyte: he must be rubbed with ointment, but rebaptism was not required.21 There had been cases in Novgorod in which parents had taken their children to a “priest from Scandinavia” (к варяжкомоу попоу). This was punished by a six-week penance usually in the form of a fast.22 The supposed displeasure felt by Novgorodians towards Catholicism is recounted by the Russian archaeologist and historian Elena Rybina, citing the legend of the construction of a Catholic church in Novgorod. The city’s posadnik, Dobrynia, was miraculously punished when he gave the Latins permission to build their own church (ропата)—despite opposition from the bishop and the people—and, to make room for the site, even had the Orthodox Church of John the Baptist moved elsewhere: a gust of wind threw him from his boat, causing him to drown in the river Volkhov. The story is full of rhetoric against the Latins and their culture. Yet even if part of the pro-Moscow text from Историко-филологические очерки (Moscow, 2002) (Studia philologica), pp. 115–31.

The view held by some scholars that the title of archbishop was introduced in Novgorod in 1165 is erroneous. 21 Памятники древне-русского канонического права, part 1 (памятники ХI–ХV в.), 2nd ed.

In the 13th century the Greeks were accused by the Latins of not recognizing Latin baptism and forcing converts to be baptized again. See Dekrete der ökumenischen Konzilien, ed.

On the contrary, the absence of a clear distinction between the Catholic and the Orthodox worlds would be a more accurate description of the Baltic region at the end of the 12th century. Some ecclesiastical texts might have been antagonistic, but their effect on society, on everyday behaviour and attitudes, and on the political course of events was evidently extremely slight.26 23 Rybina, Торговля, pp. 168–73 and 331–37; Anna L.

They would likely have formed their own idea of it as they made their way along the eastern Baltic coast. Rus’ was generally seen as a distant, strange, unknown, and unruly land in contemporary German literature.27 Ruthenia was a common term used for Rus’ in European geography,28 although the word could equally stand for the entire eastern Baltic coast or a much larger area. When the English chronicler Matthew Paris (d. 1259) told of the death of King Valdemar II of Denmark (1241), he added that the king had conquered Frisia et Ruscia, where he had founded six or seven bishoprics.29 The name of the island of Rügen must have also caused confusion. At the time it was under Danish sovereignty and the terms Russia and Rugia were used interchangeably for both territories.30 Eastern 27 Michail Sverdlov, “Nachrichten über die Ruś in der deutschen historischen Überlieferung des 9.–13.

For Matthew, the regions of Frisia, Sithia, and Gothia lay somewhere in eastern Europe. He relates that the Mongol threat meant that no one from Gothia and Frisia appeared in Yarmouth in 1238 to buy herring (Matthaei Chronica, vol. 3, p. 488). Cf. Vernadsky, Mongols, pp. 53–54, who identified these lands with Novgorod. ‘Frisians’ in Matthew could also be a general description for the merchants trading eastern goods in the north; cf. for example HCL XIV.3, p. 74. Valdemar’s power also extended to Frisia. Six or seven fits in rather well the number of Livonian bishoprics. 30 See Natalia I. Shchaveleva, “Древнерусские известия Великопольской хроники,” in Летописи и хроники 1976 г.

For example, the 12th-century chronicle of Magdeburg in its account of the crusade against the Wends in 1147 relates that, in addition to Polish fighters, the Russians—“although less Catholic, still Christian men”— had also taken up arms against the pagan Old Prussians.32 The Holstein-based chronicler Helmold of Bosau (d. after 1177) speculated that it had been the Greeks who had converted the Russians to Christianity based on the fact that Rus’ was not far from Greece.33 Chroniclers also believed that the western European and Russian nobility had common ancestors.34 When in 1193 King Philip II Augustus of France (1180–1223) married Ingeborg (d. c. 1237), the daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark (d. 1182), only to demand a divorce after a few months, the marriage was defended by William (d. 1203), the French abbot of the Danish monastery of Æbelholt. One of his arguments was that Ingeborg’s mother, also the mother of King Knud VI (d. 1202), was of extremely high birth: she was the daughter of a Russian prince and her brothers continued to govern in Rus’.35 There are instances of Russian princes mentioned as guests at European courts.36 Where central Europe is concerned, it is more likely that they came from Galicia or Kiev.

According to Lindner, this was Prince Iaroslav Vladimirovich of Galicia (d. 1187), who might have recognized Emperor Frederick I (1152–90) as his feudal lord. See Michael Lindner, “Ein regulus Ruthenorum am Hofe Kaiser Friedrich Barbarossas. Das Wiener Dreikönigetreffen des Jahres 1165 und die ‘Ostpolitik’ des Staufers,” ZfO 50 (2001), 337–69). Cf.

These were transmitted via Polish, Hungarian, German, and Lombard master builders working in Russian dominions.37 The Laurentian Chronicle, when praising the local Bishop Ivan, even noted under the year 1194 that a church in Suzdal had been rebuilt exclusively using home-grown labour, without “German” help.38 There was thus considerable contact in both directions during this period. The relationship of north-western Rus’ with its northern Catholic neighbours was also portrayed in contradictory terms in the Russian sources. These neighbours included the “nemcy” (немцы). This term did not refer just to ethnic Germans; in Old Russian literature the word can refer to any people of the Roman faith in central and western Europe, although mostly to the Germanic peoples.39 In the Novgorod Chronicle the term not only refers to the populations of Livonia and Germany in the 13th and 14th centuries, for example, but also to the Swedes in particular. It is unclear to what extent this was a pejorative expression. The Danish historian John Lind has argued that the replacement of the earlier term for Scandinavians, “variagi” (варяги), by немцы should be seen as an expression of religious hostility.40 It is true that the Varangians are mentioned by name for the last time in the First Novgorod Chronicle at the 37 Iurii A.

Zsolt Hunyadi and József Laszlovsky (Budapest, 2001), pp. 481–93, where it is stressed that the original meaning of the word nemcy was ‘followers of the Latin or non-vernacular liturgical language’. Yet Lind also concedes in the same article (p. 497) that the word could be used in a neutral way in the 13th century despite its supposed etymology.\n\nReligious Frontier in Eastern Europe in the Twelfth Century\n\n31\n\nbeginning of the 13th century; but the “Germans” are mentioned in connection with military clashes in Livonia and then for the first time in Novgorod in 1232 as grain merchants. The word немцы is used to designate the Swedes from the end of the 13th century. In relation to events outside of Novgorod’s immediate vicinity, use is also made of the term “Latins” (латиняне).41 On the other hand, it has also been argued that the terminology of the Novgorod Chronicle was, overall, far from derogatory towards Germans and Western nations during the early 13th century.42 According to the American scholar Thomas Noonan (1938–2001), the word ‘Christian’ in the Russian sources is a synonym for ‘Russian’, the latter being used in contrast to foreigners. As far as animosity towards Catholics is concerned, however, his evidence43 is not entirely convincing. The material actually draws an opposition between Christian Russians and pagans (e.g. Lithuanians and Mongols) or even describes the “spilling of Christian blood” among the Russians themselves.44 Scholars have repeatedly drawn attention to Novgorod’s buoyant cultural relations with the West at the end of the 12th century, which allegedly became weaker later on or were broken off following the propagation of anti-Rus’\n\n41 NL1, p. 45 (trade conflict with Varangians, 1201/6709); pp. 48–49 (‘Varangians’ as bodyguard of the Byzantine emperor, 1204/6712); p. 57 (Varangian church in Novgorod burnt together with goods, 1217/6725); p. 183 (a punished slave flees to the Germans, 1058/6566); p. 46 (the German emperor is mentioned, 1204/6712); p. 49 (the Latin emperor will govern in Constantinople, 1204/6712); pp. 59–66 (Germans mentioned in connection with events in Livonia 1219–22/6727–36); p. 71 (Germans supply grain during a famine in Novgorod, 1232/6739); p. 325 (Swedish military campaign in Ladoga, 1283–84/6791–92); p. 361 (the Latin church service is introduced in Volhynia, 1349/6857).
