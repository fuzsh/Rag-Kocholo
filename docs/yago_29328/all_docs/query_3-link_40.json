The letters here were translated by Stephen Pearl. The editor of this volume, Marina Kostalevsky, translated the notes (which were provided by the Russian contributors Polina Vaidman, Ada Ainbinder, and Valery Sokolov) and wrote an Introduction for the book, along with introductory notes for each section that follows. She also made some alterations to the notes to adapt the material for English readers. A note on the Russian calendar: dates here are often given in both the Julian (old style) and Gregorian (new style) calendars. Russia adopted the Gregorian calendar only after the Revolution of 1917. A general note on Russian names. Russian names consist of a given name, a patronymic, and a surname. The male patronymics end in -ovich or -evich, and female patronymics in -ovna or -evna. These endings mean “son of” or “daughter of” the father whose first name is converted into a patronymic. For example, Ilya Petrovich means Ilya, son of Pyotr; Aleksandra Andreevna means Aleksandra, daughter of Andrey. The male surnames end in -ov, -in, oy, or -y (sometimes transliterated as -ii). For example, Goncharov, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Tchaikovsky. The female surnames end in -a, or -aya. For example, Goncharova, Pushkina, Tolstaya, Tchaikovskaya. The editor of this publication is above all indebted to a leading Tchaikovsky scholar, the senior curator at the Tchaikovsky State HouseMuseum in Klin and editor of the original Russian edition Neizvestnyi Chaikovskii, Polina Vaidman, who sadly passed away during the preparation of the American edition of the book. I am also grateful to Frances Brent, Elizabeth Frank, and Olga Voronina for their comments and suggestions. Finally, I would like to thank the anonymous readers for making my quest for accuracy even more meaningful.\n\nIntroduction It is hard to imagine how such a large—indeed impressive—number of letters, official papers, and notes related to someone as beloved, famous, and familiar as Tchaikovsky could have remained, until recently, unknown. Moreover, it’s not as if these documents have been sitting, for more than a century, in an abandoned attic waiting for some lucky person to come along and discover them. On the contrary, they have been faithfully preserved at one of Russia’s most esteemed cultural institutions: the archive of the Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky State House-Museum in Klin. Why then did these important documents remain either unpublished for many years or published only in part, with deliberate distortions and omissions? The reasons are simultaneously public and private, cultural and political, specifically Russian and more or less general. Tchaikovsky’s monarchism, his adherence to the Russian Orthodox tradition, and his homosexuality have presented, at different times, different but similarly uncomfortable topics for the composer’s biographers. Some taboos were implemented over the course of Tchaikovsky’s lifetime, others after his death in 1893, and most of them under the Soviet regime. The Soviet historians usually dismissed out of hand Tchaikovsky’s ardent patriotism toward Imperial Russia and his sincere loyalty to Alexander III, whose patronage the composer enjoyed in his later years.1 Needless to say, during the Soviet period, this kind of ideological “makeover” was methodically applied to all famous Russian figures of the past. In order to enter the Soviet pantheon, the Russian greats had to be purified of their ideological and moral “errors.” In Tchaikovsky’s case, his respectful references to the Russian monarchy and its policies were deliberately erased from any public discussion of the composer’s life. As a result, the notification letters of awards and gifts sent to Tchaikovsky from the office of Alexander III were not published until recently.2 The same ideologically motivated approach was applied to his musical heritage. It is telling that in the Soviet Union, Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture (from 1880) was performed without its climactic section, the old Russian\n\nnational anthem “God Save the Tsar” [Bozhe, Tsarya khrani]. The new and “improved” version of the famed overture was reworked with the help of a Soviet composer, Vissarion Shebalin, who replaced the “God Save the Tsar” section with the chorus “Glory” [Slav’sya] from Mikhail Glinka’s opera Ivan Susanin. In all likelihood, the irony of such a rearrangement would not have escaped the well-educated and intelligent Shebalin: the original title of Glinka’s opera had been A Life for the Tsar, and the original opening line of his chorus used to be “Glory to Our Tsar.”3 In similar fashion, Tchaikovsky’s sacred works, such as the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (1878) and the AllNight Vigil (1882), were excluded from performance in the atheist Soviet Union, and his contribution to the art of Russian Orthodox music was consciously ignored.4 The central prohibition concerning Tchaikovsky’s life has been his homosexuality—public discussion of the topic has been taboo in his home country for almost a century. Ironically, in early Soviet publications from the archive of the Tchaikovsky House-Museum in Klin, the editors regarded the composer’s homosexuality as a matter that should not be excluded from scholarly study of his life.5 But aside from a few such exceptions, Tchaikovsky’s intimate life was zealously concealed by his family members, by au courant music scholars, and by the officials of such opposing regimes as the Romanov empire and Stalin’s Soviet Union. In the eyes of the authorities, it would have been unthinkable to accept the idea that Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Russia’s national treasure, was a homosexual. Therefore, he wasn’t. Outside of Russia, also, the issue was not properly addressed for a long time. Though the fact of Tchaikovsky’s homosexuality was fairly known in the West and often mentioned in studies of the composer, his biographers did not elaborate on it any further.6 In general, even apart from this point, an interval between the fiftieth anniversary (in 1943) of Tchaikovsky’s death and the last decades of the twentieth century cannot be considered particularly fruitful for research on Tchaikovsky in the West.7 A significant exception during this period of calm seas is David Brown’s monumental four-volume study of the composer’s life and music from his early to his final years.8 The discourse on Tchaikovsky started to pick up steam in the late twentieth century, when homosexuality and related issues had finally become a legitimate part of scholarly inquiry. It has notably benefited from the most\n\nrecent historical and sociological methods in biographical studies and put the issue of Tchaikovsky’s sexuality in the relevant sociocultural context. As it happened, the new direction in Tchaikovsky scholarship has been additionally energized by a whiff of sensationalism resulting from the publication of articles by an émigré musicologist from the Soviet Union, Aleksandra Orlova.9 According to her interpretation of the circumstances surrounding Tchaikovsky’s death, he committed suicide in order to avoid a public homosexual scandal that was about to break. Orlova’s version has provoked “the great suicide debate,” which has involved energetic participants from opposite camps.10 Years later, Richard Taruskin, who refuted the idea of the suicide plot in favor of the official “death in the time of cholera” scenario, expertly provided analysis of the debate within its broader setting.11 Yet another expert in Tchaikovsky studies, Roland John Wiley, has also summed up the pros and cons of the theories about Tchaikovsky’s death and come to a more cautious conclusion: “the singular failing of the cholera theory is that it cannot disprove that Tchaikovsky poisoned himself with something similar in its effect.”12 The most comprehensive study of Tchaikovsky, his homosexuality, and the question of his death has been produced by Alexander Poznansky, who had the chance to examine, back in the 1980s, the originals of Tchaikovsky’s intimate letters, kept in the Tchaikovsky House-Museum Archive. Poznansky efficiently used his findings to shape the biographical narrative in his book, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man.13 He followed this influential volume with a number of publications focused on discrediting the suicide theory. Meanwhile, the Tchaikovsky archive began more and more actively to publish previously unknown materials, including some concealed or censored letters of the composer. These commendable, though arguably belated, efforts led to the publication of Neizvestnyi Chaikovskii—the original for our translation.14 Unquestionably, this edition of the archival documents accompanied by precise references to primary sources filled in conspicuous gaps in both public knowledge and research. Both the Russian and English versions are composed of correspondence between Tchaikovsky’s parents; letters from his governess, Fanny Dürbach; Tchaikovsky’s letters to his brothers, friends, and associates; and some official papers. Taken together, they remind us that Tchaikovsky was a\n\nproduct of a cultural environment that encompassed not only important characteristics of his own time but also sensibilities of the preceding century.15 The first part of the book, the letters of the composer’s parents, offers an intimate glimpse into the everyday life of a family from the Russian gentry in the first half of the nineteenth century. More importantly, it brings us closer to understanding Pyotr Tchaikovsky as a man born into this milieu. Regarding the first point, these letters, written between April 1833 and September 1851, clearly demonstrate an established social practice of privileged classes everywhere in Europe, including the vast Russian Empire, where travel and letter writing came—literally—with the territory. For the members of the Russian nobility, frequent travel, either in government service or for personal reasons, shaped in many ways the dynamics of relations with family and friends. Letters, of course, were the common form of communication during periods of absence. At the same time, the practice of correspondence became the best answer not only to the difficulties of separation but also to the aesthetic challenge of writing a text and went hand in hand with the sentimental style in literature. Similar to its visual model of the family portrait eulogizing emotional ties between husbands and wives, and parents and children, an epistolary adaptation of the sentimentalist trend also relied on an image of the family as emotional unit.16 Metaphorically speaking, within the domestic universe of Sentimentalism, the familiar letters acted as a reassuring representation of the gravitational force that held all family members together. For families that were well off, writing letters didn’t require a special occasion, but was part of daily activities and as customary as a cup of tea in the morning and a shot of stronger drink in the evening. Often, because of irregular mail collection, people would stretch the writing of a letter over a number of days, thereby blurring the distinction between letter and diary. One historian has described letter-writing practices of the period this way: “Letters, between parents and children, siblings and spouses, use emotional declarations, nicknames, conversational language, and occasional vulgarity to express and create intimacy between writer and audience. Family news, gossip and business are interspersed with descriptions of emotional and physical health and queries about that of others. Although the letters encompass a number of distinct relationships, a common concern with\n\ndomestic harmony and emotional intimacy marks the correspondence as a whole.”17 Though it would be a stretch to claim that the correspondence of Tchaikovsky’s parents belongs to the literary genre of familiar letters,18 the literariness of these texts (especially those penned by Pyotr Ilyich’s father) is rooted in the same tradition of epistolary writing that flourished among all distinguished Russian writers, such as Nikolay Karamzin, Vasily Zhukovsky, Pyotr Vyazemsky, and many others. Like his renowned contemporaries, Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky used various narrative devices to create a lively picture for the enjoyment of his reader, who happened to be his wife, Aleksandra Andreevna Tchaikovskaya. Today I can picture you, my Angel, if not in St. Petersburg itself, at least very near there. I can feel your heart beating when you think how far it is to the last way-station and how slowly your coachman is driving. Kolya is showering you with questions: “Isn’t this St. Petersburg? Mommy, over there I can see a lot of churches, it must be St. Petersburg, mommy.” “No, darling, it’s Tsarskoye Selo.” [ . . . ] There you all are, stopping for a rest, shaking the dust from your clothes, hurrying to get washed. [ . . . ] You are being offered food, but you’re not hungry. Finally you’re seated again in the carriage, moving fast, although it seems slow to you.\n\nIt is not difficult to notice that the language and tone employed with considerable grace by Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s parents echoes a literary model popular among educated Russians through the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and represented foremost by the doyen of Russian Sentimentalism, Nikolay Karamzin. In accordance with the culture of sensibility, their letters are permeated with expressions of love, tender reproaches, and descriptions of feelings, as in the following example written by Aleksandra Andreevna to her husband-to-be. May is almost over, and you will be back in August, I hope. So there will still be those two cruel months to wait; June and July! Oh dear! If they would only fly by! I have so much to tell you that I can’t possibly write it!! It’s so dull and dreary without you. I just can’t wait for the moment when I will see you and convince you of the sincerity of my devotion to you! How happy I will be then! In your letter from Voronezh you really hurt me—you wrote that you were even sure that I don’t love you, and that I couldn’t love you—but who then could force me to give you my hand and my heart as long as I live?\n\nLetters from the age of Sentimentalism are embellished with emotional exclamations, characteristic diction, and distinct stylistic devices, which were employed to convey the sensitivity of the author, whether it was a novelist or an epistolarian. This kind of emotional refinement is expressed, in the words of a scholar of Russian literature, by “means of a highly stylized language and specific lexical markers, such as selected epithets to describe a person’s\n\npsychological traits, the physical repercussion of certain mental conditions (such as sighs, tears, paleness, faintness), and culminating in highly emotional utterances.”19 Many passages in Ilya Tchaikovsky’s letters reveal his predilection for these figures of speech and verbal gestures, such as this one written to his wife:20 My Angel! When I said goodbye to you yesterday evening, I had to hold back my tears, because I didn’t want to seem weak in the eyes of the people around me, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears welled up—and I had to keep my eyes closed while I was trying to comfort Petya who was crying inconsolably because his mommy didn’t take him to St. Petersburg. While I was seeing you off, as well as the whole procession following you, I felt so keenly the pain of separation that I could hardly contain myself.\n\nWhile “mommy” visits St. Petersburg, her son Pyotr (Petya) does what anyone of his time would do: he writes letters. The very first epistolary example of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s handwriting, included in his parents’ correspondence, looks like a zigzagging outline of nonverbal exclamation. His sensitive father helpfully “translates” the boy’s scribble: “Dear Mommy, I’m well, don’t forget to bring me toys and candy.” Another following message from the future composer is, as might be expected, musical in nature: “Sasha and Petya,” their father reports, “have composed a song, ‘Our Mother is in St. Petersburg.’” When Aleksandra Tchaikovskaya returned home, she brought her children not only toys and candy but also a governess, Fanny Dürbach, who would remain part of the Tchaikovskys’ “emotional unit” until the family left Votkinsk in September of 1848. Although “Fanny’s reign” lasted less than five years, Tchaikovsky scholars agree that the composer’s first mentor had significant influence on the formation of his personality and his general development. What kind of influence, we may ask? The second section of this volume, which contains Fanny Dürbach’s letters, gives us some answers. Especially telling is the information about the reading materials she used in her classes with the Tchaikovsky children: Apart from “L’Education Maternelle” by Mlle. Amable Tastu, I also had “Family Education” by Mrs. Edgeworth in several volumes. In natural history, I also had a small illustrated copy of Buffon. For reading: the “Tales of Guizot” and also Schmidt’s “Canon,” and my class books, which I also used. One of our favorite volumes was “Celebrated Children” by Michel Masson; we read it and recounted it in the evenings and on Saturdays.21\n\nJust like Tchaikovsky’s parents’ letters, the reading list of the future composer belongs to a particular cultural paradigm ushered in by the age of Sensibility. The first author in Fanny Dürbach’s pedagogical library is\n\nAmable Tastu.22 During her long life, Tastu proved herself a prolific writer, working in many genres and fields such as children’s literature, the pedagogical treatise, historical writings, short fiction, literary criticism, travelogue, and translation. However, Tastu’s early reputation as a French woman of letters was established in 1826 when she published her first collection of poetry; this was praised by the foremost literary critic of the time, Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, who characterized one of her poems as a model of the “domestic elegy.” In one of her later pieces of literary criticism, Tastu eloquently elaborated on the poetic virtues of sensibility, claiming that “sentimental poetry expresses more than domestic affection or resignation,” but also awakens our sympathies for the sorrows of others.23 The “Tales of Guizot” read by the children in Tchaikovsky’s home could have been one of the French editions of Moral Tales or Popular Tales written by Pauline Guizot (née Pauline de Meulan),24 the first wife of the celebrated French historian, political thinker, and statesman François Guizot.25 Before her marriage in 1812, Pauline de Meulan was already known as a respectable woman of letters, contributor to the periodical press, and an author of sentimental novels. But her union with Guizot created a husband-and-wife team that had a great impact on the intellectual and political climate of early nineteenth-century France. Together, they published the six-volume collection Les Annales de l’éducation, which included many of Pauline Guizot’s stories and articles on morality and education. By all accounts, she had an enormous influence on her husband and, according to his biographer, Gabriel de Broglie, taught him to value emotions and sentimental intimacy.26 Another author on Fanny’s list for the Tchaikovsky children is Maria Edgeworth.27 She wrote one of the most famous sentimental novels, Castle Rackrent, which stands in the same row as Samuel Richardson’s Pamela, Laurence Sterne’s Sentimental Journey, Henry Mackenzie’s The Man of Feeling, and Rousseau’s Julie, or the New Heloise. We don’t know exactly which of Mrs. Edgeworth’s works Fanny included in her pedagogical practice, but most likely she used collections of children’s stories as well as Edgeworth’s Practical Education, a theory of education in which she made sensible use of the ideas introduced by John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The information provided by Fanny Dürbach further illuminates the cultural landscape of Tchaikovsky’s upbringing, which served as an aesthetic\n\nbackground for him throughout his entire creative life. For many reasons, Tchaikovsky’s reunion with his “old teacher and friend” on the eve of 1893 held a special meaning for both of them. We can also say that it was symbolic, as this turned out to be the composer’s final year. Their first and last meetings, separated by almost fifty years, served as emotional bookends to Tchaikovsky’s sentimental education. After seeing Fanny Dürbach in Montbéliard, Tchaikovsky wrote to his younger brother and future biographer Modest: Upon her return to Montbéliard, she spent the next 42 years living quietly and uneventfully. And her younger years, so different from the rest of her life in Montbéliard, remained completely undisturbed in her memory. At times, I have been so vividly transported to that distant past that it felt somewhat eerie but also sweet; we both were holding back tears all the time.28\n\nDuring his visit, Tchaikovsky learned that all these years Fanny Dürbach had safeguarded his childhood notebooks, which contained compositions, writing assignments, and drawings as well as letters from his family members. In Fanny’s own words, “those precious letters” and notebooks possessed great sentimental value for her. As she later expressed herself to Modest Tchaikovsky, “if time destroys every thing, [ . . . ] it has no power over those sincere affections which, like our most treasured possessions, we will carry with us beyond the grave.”29 After Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s death, Fanny Dürbach kept up an active correspondence with Modest Ilyich. She provided him with a substantial portion of her archive and promised to bequeath the remaining documents to the Tchaikovsky House-Museum in Klin, then just established.30 Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s own letters reproduced in the third section of this volume are an especially valuable and engaging addition to the corpus of previously published correspondence between the composer and his numerous addressees. They represent only a fraction of Tchaikovsky’s correspondence, and naturally should be read in the context of the entire body of his letters and diaries. Considering that Tchaikovsky left more than five thousand presently known letters and presumably a few hundred missing ones, the term “man of letters” characterizes him quite literally. As numerous examples from the composer’s epistolary output testify, he possessed natural gifts of verbal expression. After all, his childhood teacher, Fanny Dürbach, had reason to call him “my dear little poet” and even believed that his main talents lay in literature. A particular set of Tchaikovsky’s letters goes as far as to echo a literary genre—the epistolary novel—which was very popular in the\n\neighteenth century but had fallen out of favor by his time.31 I am referring here to the composer’s remarkable correspondence with Nadezhda von Meck, which mirrors the literary convention of a long-distance love affair unfolding through writing. Their relationship developed exclusively through letters, and they never actually met in person.32 Furthermore, in his letters to von Meck, his “best friend” and patroness, Tchaikovsky often uses the rhetorical devices favored by Sentimentalists, as in this instance: You ask whether I can call you my friend. Could you truly doubt this; is it possible that you did not see within the lines of my letters how deeply I value your friendship, how sincere and most warm are my friendly feelings towards you. How pleased I would be at some time to show you, not in words but in deeds, the full measure of my gratitude and my love for you!33\n\nIn later years, such stylistic features as emotional declarations, dramatic questions, and expressions of feeling appear less and less in Tchaikovsky’s writing. However, the overall “rhetorical orchestration” of his letters underlines their affinity with the epistolary practice of late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century Russia. In the spirit of that tradition, the composer’s letters speak of intimacy and the atmosphere of trust conveyed by both sensibility in subject matter and style. Similar to Karamzin and his younger contemporaries, such as Konstantin Batyushkov, Vyazemsky, and Alexander Pushkin, Tchaikovsky, over time, moved in his letters from lofty observation and emotional outpourings to daily reports casually peppered with a different kind of emotional release—obscenities and self-deprecating vulgarities. In a letter to his publisher, Pyotr Jurgenson, for example, Tchaikovsky refers to his music as excrement: Well, my dear fellow, for some time now I have been feeling that this miniature march is just a miniature piece of shit. To be frank, I would like to discard this garbage altogether. [...] Yours P. Tchaikovsky (Begetter of the little piece of shit)\n\nModest Tchaikovsky provides a valuable commentary on the reasons behind the changes in his brother’s writing style: He [Tchaikovsky] preferred the system of brief and imperfect notes, because in reading through the diaries of his childhood and youth, in which he had gone more fully into his thoughts and emotions, he had felt somewhat ashamed. The sentiments and ideas which he found so interesting, and which once seemed to him so great and important, now appeared empty, meaningless and ridiculous, and he resolved in the future only to commit facts to paper without any commentary. Disillusioned by their contents, he destroyed all his early diaries.34\n\nNeedless to say, however, Tchaikovsky’s desire to convey his sentiments\n\nto the world was not undermined by his embarrassment over his youthful attempts to do it verbally. He had long been aware that the language best suited for him to express human feelings was music. “Where words leave off, music begins,” he asserted, quoting Heinrich Heine. Comparing the process of composing to writing a poem, he elaborated further: “the difference is just that music has incomparably more powerful resources and a more subtle language at its disposal for expressing a thousand different nuances of inner feeling.”35 Tchaikovsky’s explicit attention to “nuances of inner feeling” should be seen not only as an indicator of his personal emotional traits but also as the artistic attitude that corresponds to the fundamental idea of Sentimentalism: an intrinsic ability of all people to feel and to love is the key to higher truth and harmonious society. The ideas of Sentimentalism certainly did not vanish with the end of the eighteenth century and even with the related period of early Romanticism. A number of celebrated artists and writers of the nineteenth century, such as Charles Dickens and Fyodor Dostoevsky, inherited the rich culture of feeling that had been instigated by the “cult of sentiment.”36 Tchaikovsky’s emotional sensibilities as an artist, as well as his appeal to the emotional sensibilities of his listeners, were also shaped by the cultural paradigm of Sentimentalism. The collection of letters published in this volume provides a new ground for understanding the composer’s connection to that European movement. They also allow us to take a new look at Tchaikovsky’s rather infamous sentimentality. For it is important to see this not just as the reflection of his psychological and sexual makeup but as the manifestation of his loyalty to Sentimentalism—a positive culture of feeling. Arguably, such an approach can offer yet another perspective in our search for new insights into Tchaikovsky’s life and music.\n\nTHE TCHAIKOVSKY PAPERS\n\nThe Tchaikovsky family.

(All photographs are reprinted courtesy of the P. I. Tchaikovsky State MuseumReserve)\n\n1 Correspondence Between Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s Parents PYOTR ILYICH TCHAIKOVSKY was born into the family of a mining engineer and manager of the Kamsko-Votkinsk iron factories in the Ural Mountains, Major General Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky (1795–1880). The composer’s father was the youngest child in a large family belonging to the gentry. Ilya did not follow in the footsteps of his older brothers, who were sent to military schools. Instead, in 1817 he entered Russia’s first higher technical college, established by Catherine the Great, the Mining Cadets’ Corps in St. Petersburg.1 Six years later he graduated from the school with a silver medal.2 His career lasted more than forty years and was marked by many contributions to the Russian mining industry, including its management and education. At the time when Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky began courting the future composer’s mother, Aleksandra Andreevna Assier (1812–1854), he was a widower with a very young daughter from his first marriage, to Maria Karlovna Keiser. Aleksandra Assier was born to a French émigré, Andrey Mikhailovich Assier, and a Russian mother, Ekaterina Mikhailovna Popova. The composer’s grandfather arrived in Russia in 1795 to teach German and French at the Artillery and Engineering Gentry Cadet Corps in St. Peters burg.3 There he met his future wife, a daughter of an Orthodox deacon. The couple became parents of five children, the youngest being Aleksandra, but Ekaterina Assier (née Popova) died when the girl was only four years old. At that tender age, Aleksandra was placed in the Patriotic Institute for Girls in Moscow, where she eventually received her education. Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky and Aleksandra Andreevna Assier married in October 1833. The bride was seventeen years younger than the groom.\n\n* * *\n\n1. ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY TO ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA ASSIER St. Petersburg, April–May 18334 What was the meaning of those tears? Please tell me frankly. I didn’t expect to see them, but having seen them, I had to assume that I was the reason for them. My darling whom I adore! I have long been seeking an opportunity to declare my feelings, but there have always been other people around, and to tell you the truth, it is hard to bring myself to speak of something so important, something on which my whole fate depends. From the very moment when you pronounced that fateful word, “yes,” when fire raced through my veins, when I felt I was on the very summit of heavenly bliss, when everything went dark before my eyes except the vision of you—one thought has been tormenting me more and more: are you not regretting the haste with which you uttered that word which bespoke my happiness. It’s difficult to read your eyes, but those tears . . . why oh why didn’t you hide them from me? Better to be deluded for a time than forever. I haven’t closed my eyes for three nights. Now your tears have condemned me to a fourth sleepless night—don’t think I’m complaining, no, all that time I have been with you in spirit—I have been cheerful, joyful, right up to this moment when that very first thought came back to me. I knew—it was something impossible to miss—the passion—or more simply—the love for you of a certain young man. You didn’t know me at that time—but tell me, did you have the same feelings for him? If you did, then on the strength of my passionate love for you, let me build a sincere friendship, and in the way a friend would tell you, that you were indeed too quick to utter that word which made me so happy, before you had searched your heart. You should know, my dear Conqueror of hearts, that my love for you is not news to you. Do you believe in predestination and the notion of soul mates? If you do, then by the same token, do not reject premonition either! But we’ll leave that subject for another time. As it is, by that single word you have given me leave to love you, and it inflamed me, and I love you more than life itself. I know of nothing I would not sacrifice for you. But I have reached that stage of life when, for all this noble passion, my reason has not deserted me, and the wound is perhaps not too deep for it to heal, and I will have the strength to rip\n\nmy desolate heart away from yours, if you tell me frankly and confess that you acted in haste. Don’t torment me. You were born with a good heart, so try to understand how hard it will be for me to bear this confession in four months’ time. At that time, I can’t be certain how I will feel, but right now there is still time, I’ll forget—I’ll convince myself that it was all just a lovely dream, a mirage; I’ll go away and you’ll never see me again, and I’ll devote myself to raising my motherless daughter,5 and in fifteen years’ time, I’ll come back and witness your happiness. My dear one, I adore you, and fall to your feet to beg you to decide my fate—the sooner the better. It would be foolish of me to condemn you, and even worse to despise my rival, when in fact I respect and admire that young man precisely because he shares my tastes. He is my superior in every respect and I won’t be surprised in the slightest if he prevails . . . As for my passion, I can only repeat that there is still time—make the best use of it, and don’t forget that for me it has to be all or nothing. Marriage is life’s most important step. A man and his bride to be must put themselves to the test over a long period. Perhaps you have been told that I am a kindly man—don’t believe it, I am capricious and short tempered, and can flare up at any time. You’ve heard that I am rich; well you have simply been misled, I have nothing, nor do I want to marry into wealth. In this regard, my philosophy could not be more different from that of society at large; I want to be happy without wealth, and happy in the same way I was before—that is in my family; I don’t want to be made happy because of wealth, but I want to make as happy as is within my power the one with whom fate has ordained that I be united. I am someone who is happy when my love is pure, unreserved, and sincere. In a word, it has to be all or nothing. What people think and what they say means nothing to me; I don’t give a fig for their opinions. You perhaps respect those opinions, and I won’t argue with you or judge you, and you will act as you see fit. Finally, I must tell you that if you sacrifice yourself on the altar of my complete happiness, you run the risk of forfeiting the pleasures of society, for it has been my fate to spend my life far removed from society and, I have to confess, I prefer the quiet life away from the hustle and bustle, and have grown accustomed to living within a small circle of good people, and am a great believer in Caesar’s dictum: “It’s better to be number one in your village, than the last man in Rome.” Anyway, it’s high time I finished. It’s beginning to get light, and you, angel of my heart, are asleep—please don’t take offense, don’t follow my example!\n\nMay the King of heaven take you under His protection. Whether you are mine, I do not know, but no one can stop me loving you! No it’s not that I love you, that’s not the right word, I adore you—and you are worthy of it. God give me the strength to endure what I expect—and must expect! Don’t make me wait for an answer. If you can’t tell me, then write, and destroy what I have written. * * *\n\n2. ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY TO ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA ASSIER Moscow, 10 May 1833 Feeling and writing are two completely different things. There are people who can combine the two, but I am not one of them. My soul mate! I am just not capable of expressing what I was feeling as I took leave of you, nor what I am feeling now—not to see you, not to feel you near me for four months is really hard on me! You can imagine what an ordeal it is. But God is merciful, and with His help I will withstand this ordeal. Moscow has nothing of interest to offer me, so, housebound by necessity, it is the thought of you that keeps up my spirits. I have my nice nephew Pyotr I[vanovich]6 to talk to—after all what is there for me to do in Moscow, I’ve seen the city several times, I’ve lived here—the sooner I get to the Caucasus and back to you the better, so that I can fall at your feet, my darling whom I adore. I can’t describe our journey as romantic, as people are wont to do—that’s been frightfully overdone. To put it simply and frankly, I just went along, kept silent, and did more thinking and musing than talking. There were various topics of conversation, but there was just one, and only one, subject of my thoughts and reveries. You and Zina,7 Zina and you occupied my entire being. Do you know, my darling, do you recall how that innocent being, even before it might have happened, betrothed us with rings. It must have been something she sensed, or else the Almighty was prompting her. You should find out if she had been coached; if she hadn’t, then it must have been the work of the Almighty, who, not for the first time, was revealing to me my destiny. My darling! When you gave me your hand, you took on the job of being a mother to that child—love her my dear, for my sake, and protect her! By so doing, you will be expressing your love for me doubly, just\n\nas I will be striving twice as hard to deserve it. You promised to write to me; for the love of God, please do! I will find your precious letter everywhere. That is my only joy. Even now I am feeling the need for your letters—write, but don’t make it a burden; just a line, or even a word will do! I would like to write more, but people keep interrupting. I smother your hand with letter-borne kisses—I kiss all of you. Your first timid kiss when we parted kept my lips aflame long afterwards, and even now I feel its sweet caress, and with it I shall remain faithful to you to the grave. I[lya] T[chaikovsky]. P.S. I’ll write from Voronezh. * * *\n\n3. ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY TO ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA ASSIER Voronezh, 15 May 1833 My soul mate! Can you imagine that you are with me everywhere and always, and don’t think I am just paying idle compliments, because up to now there hasn’t been a minute, even a second when I haven’t been thinking of you; you actually and truly inhabit my imagination, my thoughts, my head. I am even astonished at myself, a man of my years with graying temples, a wrinkled forehead, a man of so much experience of life, who can still be moved by his feelings as strongly as a young lad. For some time now I have been feeling as if I’ve taken on a new lease of life, and my past now seems like a dream. I know and remember that six years ago I was loved and was in love myself,8 but you shouldn’t be jealous, my dear, my love then was just as pure and unblemished as it is now, but fate has rewarded me generously for my loss; and you know what fills me with delight, and why that same noble, unsullied passion has been born again within me. It’s the fact that you, my dear, have freely, spontaneously and without hesitation yielded your hand and heart to a man of my advanced years. I am sure, and it is only natural, that you have not yet had time to grow to love me truly, well, so be it, I will earn it and convince you of my own love in time. In Voronezh, I have made it my first duty to kneel in worship at the tomb of the saint,9 and to have a prayer said for your and Zina’s health. Since the\n\nfourth of the month you have been included in my daily prayers, and I’ll be bringing you back an icon and other sacred objects of St. Mitrofan. What is my Zina doing? I’m sure she hasn’t been left without her “mommy’s”10 guidance. Oh, if only I had found a letter, or at least could look forward to finding your first one soon on my arrival. Only, when you write it, please don’t use such sweet ink as this, other wise I might very well eat it. I kiss both your hands and their dear fingers, and even take the liberty of grazing your tender cheek. This is the last letter from me while I’m on the road. On from Novocherkassk there stretch sparsely settled regions which even the mountain people frequent on occasion. What if I’m captured? Although, of course, that can’t happen since I’m already captive. Goodbye, my soul mate. Yours until the grave I[lya] T[chaikovsky] P.S. Please give Zina my blessing. * * *\n\n4. ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA ASSIER TO ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY [St. Petersburg,] 29 May [1833] My dear incomparable friend! How long you’ve made us suffer from your silence. Precisely two weeks after you left, on Thursday the 18th, Pyotr Ivanovich11 arrived bringing your letters. For a whole two weeks we didn’t know what to think. Every day Daddy12 grew more and more worried and kept on repeating: “It must mean something!” Zina’s nanny13 and I both suspected Panov, who went with you, and were really sorry that you didn’t take your own manservant with you, but finally Pyotr Ivanovich was able to set our minds at rest! You won’t believe how happy I was to see him! I was sitting in my room looking anxiously out of the window for the postman, sure that he would be bringing us a letter from you, when suddenly I heard a familiar voice. I ran into the living room and saw Pyotr Ivanovich, and even then had to wait impatiently for a good hour before I was handed the letter addressed to me, because Mommy14 didn’t want to give it to me in his presence. He comes to visit us quite often, and talks to me about your life in\n\nMoscow, and by the way, he told me that you very often sing the romance “The Ring of the Fair Maiden . . . ”15 I also sing it very often, and think of my own ring, which you wear on your hand! Pyotr Ivanovich has noticed it. I would like to know if he knows something, I imagine that you’ve been open with him! In your first letter, you write that you are going to be away for another four months, so, as I see, it, that means that there’s much less time to wait now. May is almost over, and you will be back in August, I hope. So there will still be those two cruel months to wait; June and July! Oh dear! If they would only fly by! I have so much to tell you that I can’t possibly write it!! It’s so dull and dreary without you. I just can’t wait for the moment when I will see you and convince you of the sincerity of my devotion to you! How happy I will be then! In your letter from Voronezh you really hurt me—you wrote that you were even sure that I don’t love you, and that I couldn’t love you—but who then could force me to give you my hand and my heart as long as I live? I would like to know the reason why you suppose I made that decision! Surely you don’t think that I did it out of some kind of desperation—not at all, I was free, happy, and carefree living in my parents’ home; or perhaps you think I did it to please Daddy, absolutely not! I love you, it would be impossible to love you more than I do! Zininka, thank God, is healthy, happy and in good spirits, and up to her tricks all day long; and every day she grows to love her grandma and grandpa16 more and more. She talks about you often. She has also become really attached to me, and I love it when she cuddles up to me. She’s such a dear and so obedient that you can’t help loving her, and what’s more she’s the living image of her daddy. You also happen to mention my duties towards her—I understand them very well, and I am sure the time will never come when you have to remind me of them again! After yourself, of course, there is no one else I will ever care for more. Mommy, of course, will be writing to you herself about Katerina Grigorievna’s misfortune. I won’t describe to you how upset everyone is over it, Fyodor Vasilievich most of all. You know this from your own experience! For the love of God, please write more often, and tell me about your health. For me that’s the most important thing. Nanny and Zina send you their best, and Zina kisses your hands; and hugs from both of us. Yours until the grave\n\nA. Assier * * *\n\n5. ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA ASSIER TO ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY [St. Petersburg,] 18 July [1833] I’m sorry, I’m totally at fault for missing the last post. I hadn’t written to you, but I somehow just couldn’t get round to it—I can’t remember why. So I’m relying on your kind heart, and am sure that you will forgive me, especially now that I’ve confessed my guilt! I don’t have much good news for you! In her last letter I know Mommy has told you that Daddy has had another one of his attacks; and two weeks later on the 12th of July, Mommy’s birthday, and Daddy’s name day, the same thing happened again. It was on the day we were planning to go to Pargolovo17 and spend the whole day there. I got up at four o’clock to see what the weather was like. Well, it was glorious, and I could hardly wait until it was time to go, but I went back to bed. Half an hour later, Mommy comes into my room and says that Daddy is not feeling good again. I was really taken by surprise because it was so totally unexpected, and so we had to stay home! Oh dear, what a disappointment! But there was nothing to be done; it seems that there is some truth to that proverb: “man proposes, God disposes”! Yes, it’s really too bad that Daddy is having these attacks so often now,18 and no wonder since he spends days on end not saying a word to anyone, and doing nothing but dwell on those things which can only have the effect of damaging his health! Let me send you my best wishes for the forthcoming day of Your Angel,19 and hope you have a really nice time, it’s just a pity that my good wishes will arrive so late in the day. I would have wanted to be the first of all to congratulate you! Nadenka has already been to see us three times since you left. She is in good health, thank God! And is spending most of her time with the Sobolevskys.20 They are very busy preparing for the weddings. Their oldest girl is getting married on the 21st of this month, so she is helping out there! P. I. Evreinov is a regular visitor. You certainly found the right word to describe him, he is an out and out crook! Zina is becoming more and more lovable every day, and she’ll be writing to you soon!\n\nSo, until the next post. Yours until the grave A. Assier * * *\n\n6. ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA TCHAIKOVSKAYA TO ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY Nizhny Novgorod, 26 March 183721 Ilyichka, my dear, incomparable, divine friend! When I said goodbye to you, I couldn’t immediately grasp how long it would be before I saw you again, but as time goes on I miss you more and more, and am more keenly aware that my Angel, my dear, precious husband is not here by my side! I reproach myself so often now for not being able to persuade you to take me with you, the road, I am told, especially as far as Kazan is still in great condition. Several times now, I have been on the point of packing everything up and following you—but couldn’t do it against your wishes; when I’m separated from you, I feel ever more strongly that I can’t live without you. The habit of kissing you or your hand every day has become so powerful that, when I wake up in the morning I immediately find myself imagining you or your angelic hand are beside me, and I pick up the first thing that comes to hand, my night-cap or whatever, kiss it passionately. What can I tell you about how I’ve been spending my time? Since you left, we’ve visited the Stremoukhovs again. Katenka22 has made a big hit with everyone here—we’ve become very popular, but just because of her—but no matter where I am, I miss you, my Angel, my darling! Yesterday I sent for Evenius,23 but he couldn’t come because he was going back to his village. Since I don’t know any of the doctors here, I had made up my mind not to use any of them, but two days after you left, the plaster fell off my chest. The next day I put the ointment on a new one and put it back on. But yesterday, when I arrived back from the Stremoukhovs, I felt my chest itching terribly and started to scratch it, and noticed that it was damp under the plaster. I immediately lifted off the plaster and saw that there was a milky substance oozing from me, but not from the nipple, and what looked like white blisters had broken out. Today I made up my mind to send for another doctor, Dr. Lindegrein,24 who is the leading doctor here and an obstetrician. He came\n\nand after asking me a lot of questions, told me that I was suffering from a hidden rash and that there was a sickly bluish look about me. When I told him about the ailment I had been suffering from before my pregnancy, he told me that it had appeared during my pregnancy in the form of a rash, and regretted that it had been cooled and had moved into the breast. When I told him that I had an open hemorrhoid, he said that was from taking sulphur powder, exposed to the cold, but felt that that was all to the good. He wants to treat me with homeopathic medicine, and advised me to take off the plaster and wash it thoroughly, but when I did, I found that some kind of pus was starting to ooze, and it’s still going on. Not only that, but now I have a bad headache. He is coming to see me again tomorrow to start the treatment. We had a long conversation and he asked me if my baby was alive. I showed him Katya25—she happened to be sleeping—and he found her very weak and sickly, examined her briefly and repeated that she was very weak, and said that she too was suffering from a hidden rash, and that was the reason why she was screaming, and said she should be given some chamomile when she screamed, and then gave sulphur both to her and to the wet nurse whom he had also examined. He is obviously very fond of children, and spent a long time with Katya, and examined her again when she woke up. Right now she is indeed extremely pale and just as restless as before, but is becoming more lovable every day, and beginning to clutch with her little hands, and is burbling so endearingly that I simply can’t keep back the tears when I look at her. Now I’m telling her: “What message shall I give Daddy from you?” And she replies: “agu, o, ay” etc., and smiles so winningly that you would want to smother her with kisses. Oh, and I forgot to tell you that Lindegrein is set on bringing my rash to the surface. God knows what will be the result of this treatment. Ilyichka, my dear friend! Your prayers for me to the Lord God are my only hope. Zinochka, thank God, is well and smart. Every morning she studies a little, and has learned the prayer Lord and Master of My Life. I bought her material for a dress which I’m making for her for the holiday. Yesterday, I met Messing26 in a shop. He deeply resents the fact that you didn’t stop by to see him, and says that if he ever happens to pass by the Votkinsk Factory, he will never come to see us. Our servants here are having a very dreary time here, they can’t wait for spring. Artemy27 has several times tried to get me to spring a surprise on you and turn up unannounced. It seems his wife is now pregnant. I’ve just been brought your letter from the Sherchins,28 as well as your parcel; the eggs and dolls for Zina I haven’t\n\nreceived, but I did get the tablecloths and the pictures. Don’t get annoyed with me, my Angel, if I scold you and make fun of you about the tablecloths —to pay 33 rubles for each one is a little extravagant, they’re just headscarves that nobody wears anymore, and they were sold to you as tablecloths. I have to confess we all had a good laugh at your expense, it was a complete waste of money. I have to leave you now for a day or two. * 28 March. Sunday. Sherchin29 has just been here, he told me that he had seen you in Kazan. He is preparing only two of those long carriages—hardly enough for our purposes. I’m thinking of taking an extra vehicle, particularly since we are going to have another person travelling with us, a mining engineer30 to work as your assistant whom he is sending at your request. Anyway, it’s still a long time until that happy event. Viktor Timofeevich says that we won’t be able to set off before the twenty something of May, so I won’t reach you before June. Now, although my heart is in my mouth, and with tears in my eyes, I’m going to have to tell you, my friend, that I have a bone to pick with you. A wrong cannot be hidden for long. Sooner or later the Lord God will find it out. Yesterday after dinner I went into that small, dark room by the bedroom, and overheard Arisha31 talking to the landlady upstairs. In the course of the conversation she told her that Zinochka, out of my hearing, had asked you for money which she gave to her for a dress. Yesterday, I didn’t pay much attention to those words, since I hadn’t heard them too clearly and was just ticking Arisha off for going upstairs without my permission, especially since the landlady’s young son lives up there. But today, to my surprise, I discovered that all this had been done with your approval. Arisha comes into the bedroom to see me, looking none too clean, and I asked her why she hadn’t changed her dress for Sunday. She replied that it’s all she has with her, and that the day before she had bought some calico with her own money, whereupon Aleksandr,32 who was here at the time, tells her that she must have money if she was able to buy cloth for a dress. Arisha replied that she only has the money given to her by the young lady. Zinochka, who was present, went all red in the face and ran over to me, and stammering, confessed to me that you had given her five rubles to give to\n\nArisha and gave her strict orders not to tell me. I didn’t say anything to her, and forced myself not to say how upset I was by such behavior, especially since Aleksandr had witnessed the whole thing. You can judge for yourself what he must think of me knowing that you and Zina have secrets from me. I’m not going to reproach you, but you must see for yourself, my friend, that this was not a nice way to treat me, and understand what a difficult position you have put me in vis-à-vis Zina. If it had been Katya, I would have come down hard on her, especially if she had dared to hide something from me, especially in league with you, but all I said to Zina was that you had told me about it. Right now, I just don’t know what to think about your opinion of me, if you think that I’m stingy, I don’t understand what could have given you that idea, up to now I’ve done my best to protect you from your own endlessly inappropriate generosity, and if you think that it’s only with Zina that I’m stingy, then I must tell you that not just with her, but with anyone at all, I’ve never tried to stop you or even dissuade you, as long as it has been in accordance with your wishes. The hundred rubles you gave to Fyodor, which I wasn’t supposed to know about, only confirms my feeling that you must have a very poor opinion of me. From now on I must ask you no longer to make me spend your money, I don’t want to put you in the ridiculous position of doing things behind my back, particularly when it all belongs to you anyway. Please forgive me, my dear friend, for writing to you about such petty matters, but I can’t conceal from you what’s on my mind and in my heart, and how it troubles me when all our servants know that you did this behind my back. I won’t write any more about this, nor will I mention it again, I only ask you to understand me better. You can be sure, my Angel, that you have no need to hide anything from me, because your wish is my command, it always has been, and always will be, and that not only in these trivial matters, but in all things, I am ready to follow your wishes. If sometimes my advice may seem to be more like a refusal, or you feel it is inappropriate and out of place, then you only have to say so openly, and you’ll never hear advice from me again! I started the treatment yesterday, i.e. I’ve started taking the medicine, and so have Katya and the wet nurse. Yesterday, the doctor spent a long time feeling my pulse and breast, and found that I still have a lot of hardening. He applied a poultice and gave me some medicine. Today we were all invited to General Rebinder’s,33 but I didn’t go—Katenka and Aleksandr34 are not at\n\nhome, they went there to eat. But once again, don’t think that it was just a caprice; not at all, as I’m sure you know, homeopathic treatment doesn’t permit any vegetable roots or perfume. I am staying home alone with the children. Zina is sitting by my side busy with her sewing, she thanks you for those little pictures which she finds very interesting, and I’ve just fed Katya some porridge, and then she fell asleep. Lindegrein said not to give her any porridge, but just breast-feed her, but she had gotten so used to porridge that at those times when she was usually fed it, she would just start to scream, and there’s no way you can suddenly break her of the habit. Without telling the doctor, I feed her porridge once a day and she eats it with relish. Since I am at home alone, there is no one to prevent me chatting with you, and that’s what gives me the greatest pleasure these days, I just hope I’m not boring you, my delight, my lovely angel! In your letters, you say you are afraid of boring me. How can you of all people think that, when you know how I adore you, and the only thing that makes me happy is being with you, or thinking about you? Katenka35 has just come back from Rebinder’s. Goodbye for now. * 31 March Even though I’m not at all keen on visiting people, there is no way I can refuse an invitation from Rebinder. His concert for Katenka was scheduled for yesterday. When he discovered I wasn’t feeling well, he came round in person to try to persuade me, but I replied that the doctor hadn’t been to see me the day before, so I couldn’t possibly go without his permission. On that very same day, he persuaded the doctor to allow me to go, and sent the doctor himself to see me the very next day and Lindegrein gave me permission to go, so bon gre, mal gre [French: like it or not] I had to force myself to go out and meet people. Yesterday morning, he sent a servant round again to ask about my health, and to invite us again to his house. So I decided to go. He had told us that no one else would be there, and that he wasn’t going to invite anyone. It was true, he didn’t invite anyone, but as soon as word got out that we were going, people decided to go to his house supposedly in order to hear Katenka.36 Pyotr Mikhailovich37 found out that people were planning to come and warned us, and Katenka decided that on no account would she agree to sing. When we arrived there, we found the rooms full of guests, ladies and gentlemen, the former dressed to the nines, all arrayed in fine lace\n\nand flowers, while we, not expecting to see such a crowd, were dressed very simply. I felt so embarrassed that I had to keep my eyes lowered. It became apparent that everyone had been waiting for us, even though such personages as Mme. Zubova, the wife of the deputy governor, Baroness Shlipenbach, and others were present. The concert began the moment we appeared. The first item was called “Ouverture” from some opera or other. Then Pelagini38 sang a rather long and difficult aria, but was terribly intimidated by the sight of Katenka. This was followed by a string quartet, very nice! Then Pelagini sang another, again rather difficult aria; and finally there was some other “Ouverture,” and that was it. After the concert, there was a game of whist for two rubles. I joined in and won 1 r[uble] 80 kop[ecks] from Pyotr Mikhailovich. No matter how hard people tried to get Katenka to sing something, it didn’t work, and she was just playing une difficile [French: hard to get]. A propos [French: Incidentally], Messing did most of the persuading. I advise you, my darling Ilyichka, to send for me soon. Since you’ve long since stopped noticing my good looks, I never hear any compliments from you about them, while here I hear nothing but compliments. As for Katenka, my sister of course, what can I say, she goes round telling everyone what a beauty I am, and she’s not the only one. Yesterday, for example, at the party, a lot of people found me not at all unattractive. Messing, for one, told me three times that I had pretty eyes; even old Pyotr Mikhailovich Stremoukhov told me that I had beautiful eyes. As for me, I’m finding a lot of pretty eyes, noses, lips, and intelligent company, so that if you don’t make an effort to send for me, I won’t want to leave here, and I’ll even start forgetting you, my little old man; as it is I’m now even finding it a great effort to write to you, my divine Angel. I’m even surprised to find that for all my reluctance, here I am filling a third page. Our Katisha is very restless. In the town, there’s smallpox going around, and it scares me a little, and that’s why I want to get her vaccinated against it as soon as possible. Karl Maksimovich Rebinder even promised to get me a sample from a healthy child. At first, Lindegrein himself agreed to vaccinate her against the smallpox, but after giving her a physical examination, pronounced her too weak and thin; on top of everything, the weather here is not too good. So I really don’t know what will happen; will the Lord God spare her this disease? Zinochka, thank God, is healthy and happy. I’ve bought all the servants39 new clothes for the holiday, but so far I haven’t bought anything for myself. I’m still pleased with all of them, especially Lukeria, who is constantly nauseated and throwing up; she\n\nwon’t eat this, she won’t drink that, and can’t stand the smell of tobacco. Katenka and Aleksandr,40 thank God, are in good health. They’re so affectionate and unbelievably loving towards me. I miss you, my only treasure in the whole wide world, my Angel and dearest friend, and I can’t find pleasure in anything. Every day, from the moment I wake up, I can’t wait for it to be evening. In short, I have never found myself in a more painful position than I am now, my only delight is—writing to you, my pet. Zina and Katya kiss your hands and ask for your blessing. Although I hate to part with you, there’s no help for it, I have to prepare this letter for the post. I kiss your dear hands, your bright blue eyes, your forehead, your hair, your nose, your cheeks, all of you, and especially your lovely Angelic lips. I close with your blessing. Your faithful, adoring friend and wife Sasha. * * *\n\n7. ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY TO ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA TCHAIKOVSKAYA Votkinsk Factory, 27 March 1837, Saturday, 11 p.m. My Angel, my incomparable dear wife! Finally, after a long journey, I arrived this morning, or should I say, dragged myself here. I was advised to take the shortest route from Kazan, but God help us, what a terrible road! It’s full of ruts and potholes, and the carriage is always in danger of keeling over and falling into a pit, and it would take four horses to pull it upright. That was bad enough, but the worst was that the sides of the carriage were scraping the trees, and sometimes it took us an hour or more to struggle along for one verst.41 Just imagine my predicament. Of course, all this would have to happen at night. The horses were no problem, but the coachmen, damn them to hell, they’re all Tatars, Ostyaks, Chuvashes, and Cheremises, and not a word of Russian among the lot of them. So I spent three whole days of constant hardship, unable to wash or shave, or even drink a drop of tea. When I reached the main road, which you will be using, I gave up the idea of taking the country road to the Votkinsk factory, and went straight to the Izhevsk factory, and got there early yesterday morning. The police chief (Kun’s brother-in-law) found me a nice apartment, and immediately came to see me. I put on my full dress uniform and went with him to call on General\n\nNeratov.42 He gave me the warmest of welcomes, and arranged for me to visit the factory and the arsenal. He offered to show me around himself, but couldn’t spare the time from his duties, so I went round the factory with the police chief. The general invited me to dinner, and so warmly that I couldn’t refuse. After our tour of inspection, the police chief asked me round for a snack. His wife (Kun’s sister, Susanna Ivanovna),43 a delightful woman, was really upset because I didn’t want to stay with them, so she made me promise to insist on your stopping by, if only for a moment, so I do urge you, my dear friend, to do as she wishes. They have a large family, and they’re both really wonderful people. By two o’clock I was already at the general’s, and he introduced me to his wife.44 What a wonderful woman! I’m sure you will like her. She told me to ask you not on any account to deprive her of the pleasure of your acquaintance, and would even like you to stay with them. They have so many children that I even lost count. I don’t know whether it was because of me or not, but there were a lot of officers there; very nice people whom I got to know. On Fridays during Lent people are not usually asked to dinner, so that’s what made me think that those guests were invited to mark my arrival. Before dinner I joined them at whist45 and came out ahead of all of them, even the general’s good lady herself, who had been so nice to me. After dinner, we finished off the last hand of whist and I left. Susanna Ivanovna insisted that I visit her for a cup of tea and then go for a ride in her carriage. Meanwhile we had sent a courier to the Votka to tell them that His Honor was on his way. At the way stations (it’s seventy versts between the Izh and the Votka [rivers]), fresh horses were supplied promptly, and everywhere we were met and seen off. This morning at six o’clock, I saw the Votkinsk factory and mounted Cossacks in the distance. At the checkpoint I was met by the police chief on horseback who reported to me. The Cossacks were riding ahead; it was just like the cavalcade for Abbas-Mirza.46 Everyone half asleep, watching me from their windows and gateways as if I were some kind of marvel. Finally, we came to a halt at full gallop at the entrance. Sleepy officials, some with plumes in their hats and some without, rode up. One reported that all was well at the factory, another that all was well in the district, and a third that all was well at the workshops. A young lieutenant of a line battalion paraded his squad and orderlies and yelled: “All is well in my\n\nsquad.” Well, you clear out, I want to sleep. Luisa had gone to Zlatoust and Yekaterinburg and had already returned. I was going to see her in the annex, but she was still sound asleep. Today at twelve noon all the officials reported to me. Father Vasily47 and his retinue of priests offered me communion. Von Ziegel (our former mayor’s son)48 was waiting to meet me as instructed. He is married to Silina, who was at school with you. She is here with him and is very much looking forward to seeing you. Tomorrow they are going back to Zlatoust. I saw Luisa last of all. Just imagine, she can only sleep in the morning; she spends all night coughing. The poor thing appears to be suffering from consumption, and she’s dreadfully thin, but it cheered her up a lot to see me. I couldn’t stay with her for long, and left for the factory just to take a quick look round, and stayed until three o’clock. I dined at Luisa’s because she keeps a cook. The house, where we’ll be living, is nice and spacious. After dinner I went to the bathhouse, as is the Russian custom, and I’m still lying in my bathrobe in a cubicle. In the meantime, I’ve been getting down to business, and have had a lot of people coming to see me about various matters. Would you believe, neither our baggage nor our servants have arrived yet. Tomorrow, I’ll be sending a courier to Vyatka to find them and bring them back. Yesterday I was kept busy until eleven o’clock. As it happens, I’m keeping the post waiting just for this letter. I’m dying of hunger, and even more anxious to go to bed. I can hardly sit and keep my eyes open. Petya Grenov has spent the whole evening hovering around me and playing with the dogs. I send a thousand kisses to my dear friends, my brother Aleksandr and dear Katechka, my sister. To you, my precious treasure, a million kisses; I hug you tight to my heart. Tomorrow, I’ll be attending church for the service, and then the swearing in, followed by a bite with Father Vasily. My blessing to Zinochka and Katechka,49 and I’ll be praying for you all. I’ll write to you every evening. Until tomorrow, light of my life. Yours with all my heart, body, and soul, Ilya. * * *\n\n8. ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY TO ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA TCHAIKOVSKAYA\n\nVotk[insk] Fac[tory,] 7 April 1837, Wednesday, Midnight 4, 5, 6 April. My Sashenka, the most wonderful, beautiful wife in the world! I’ve been neglecting my journal since Sunday, partly because of so many claims on my attention throughout the day, and partly because I can’t think of subjects to interest you. However that may be, I should give you a brief account of what’s been happening in the last few days. On Sunday, I had hardly opened my eyes when practically every single official turned up and gathered in the hall—it’s the usual practice in factories in these parts. So I had to get dressed in a hurry to go out so that people could greet me and report. Talking business with so many people took up so much of my time that I was almost late for church. Anyway, I hurried there in time to hear a very good concert and the sermon by Father Vasily who came out to see me after the service with the news that he was inviting himself to my place in the evening. After church I made some visits: to the doctor,50 and was introduced to his wife, nee Meyer (daughter of the former manager of the Gornobl[agodatsk] factory. She has known me since she was a girl in Perm.51 They have quite a few children and live well. Then there was the first member, Vilegzhenin— his wife is Swedish, and, judging by her accent, probably even Finnish. She is a very simple woman, but judging by her face, good hearted and quiet. Then it was the manager, Major Romanov;52 his wife is nice looking, but has thick lips—otherwise she might be pretty. However, being pregnant, she was not her usual self physically. They have two or three children, lively kids, who get their good looks from their father. Next it was Penn,53 the Englishman— didn’t meet his wife, but her picture showed her with a red nose, he says she’s a very good woman. I saw the daughters the first day after my arrival at Luisa’s, but I’ve forgotten what they look like—apparently not beauties—but people say they are very nice girls; I think there are more than one of them.54 I like Mr. Penn, pleasant and intelligent fellow. Finally, I went to see Luisa, drank coffee and had a bite to eat, and spent some time at home looking at my notes—a lot have been accumulating on my desk—and then went to a dinner party at Vilegzhenin’s. By way of entertainment I mangled my orchestrina55 piece. Everyone listened and wept. Conversation and discussion about this and that went on until midnight. Luisa served some snacks, we ate everything, and then everyone went home. Monday was a normal working day, and began in the usual way. I did\n\nsome work at home until noon, and then set off for the office. I went from there to the factory, and stayed there until four o’clock. I had dinner at Luisa’s, went home to rest and then worked until past midnight, and many officials called on me. Yesterday, i.e. Tuesday, I waited impatiently for the post, hoping for a letter from you, my Angel, but didn’t get one. Why did you wait so long after I left before writing—it was quite a few days? It was a bit dispiriting not to have heard from you for three weeks, so I’m feeling a little down in the dumps right now. Yesterday, I had to deal with a lot of paperwork, among other things, which, since I’m still new here, is taking a little more time and effort than I would like. I need some more time to learn how to negotiate all the ins and outs. But I’m confident that I will master all of this. Thank God, I’m in good health, and activity is not only necessary, but is also very good for me. I got a letter from Mommy,56 which I am attaching. Today I prepared the mail, and not long ago sent it to Siberia or Yekaterinburg. My rooms are being painted. Goodbye, my treasure. May God bless you with peaceful sleep. * 8 April. I don’t know if you will like the way I have arranged the apartment. The corner room I’ve turned into our bedroom, and the bedroom into the nursery where we’ll put in two simple partitions. On one side we’ll put Katya with the wet nurse and the nanny, and on the other side Zina with Glafira Timofeevna.57 Of course, if you don’t like what I’ve done, then I’m in trouble. Although, of course, you can always rearrange things the way you want. The walls are finished: the reception room is yellow, and the billiard room is in lilac, the drawing room is light blue, the recess in the round living room with a divan in the shape of a bench is in blue and yellow stripes. The bedroom is also painted lilac, and the nursery pale yellow, the maids’ room remains its original pink, and hasn’t been repainted, the dining room remains yellow, and the study is still the original green. The maids’ storeroom under the staircase is very small, I’m not sure where to put the new one, but we can deal with that when you come. There is no cold pantry at all, but there is a big iron cupboard. The basement is in good condition and divided into two compartments. The hothouses and\n\ngreenhouses are not in good shape, but now they’re putting in compost for heating. In any case, the cucumbers won’t be ready by the time you arrive. Katerina was not very well, but the doctor has been treating her, and she’s feeling better. Akulina58 is putting on weight and is looking as round as a barrel. Mitka has grown up, and does nothing but sleep, the rascal. The dogs are in good health. In any case, you’ll be given a full report on all these household matters by F. V. Mironova, my housekeeper, when you arrive, and the floors, doors, and window frames will be painted in time for the holiday. It’s past midnight now. I took a nap after dinner, that’s why I’m not sleepy yet. So, how are things with you, my incomparable one? Are you in good health? What are the children doing? And my dear brother Aleksandr and sister Katechka, are they in good health? All this keeps passing through my mind even when I’m busy in the office, in the factory, or at home in my study. Pretty soon you’ll have to start preparing to leave. For a long time now I’ve been using a droshky. At the moment I only have two black horses and a capable coachman, he’ll be yours. When you want to drive somewhere we have a trap here, as for a carriage, we’ll have to send away for one. Goodbye. Hugs and blessings for you and the children. * 9 April I usually write to you in the evening, when I’ve finished working—a substitute for a real live conversation with you. How vividly I can imagine I’m with you—it’s as if you were in this very room with me, my adored friend! My thoughts are mingling with our last conversation about your journey out here. You should already be thinking about the preparations for it. Twenty-one days from now, I’ll be waiting for you. It’s dry here, but there’s still snow in the woods, and the water’s not rising in the pond, it’s infuriating. Ask my brother Aleksandr if he wouldn’t mind inspecting the carriages ahead of time; Vic[tor] Tim[ofeevich] Sherchin will be preparing them, let him decide who is going to sit where. If two kachalka carriages59 aren’t enough, then take three, but the main thing is your comfort and convenience. I urge you, my Angel, to spare no expense, just so you arrive safe and sound. Make Katechka a basket, as Aleksandr suggested. From Kazan go to Elabuga, there’s a good highway, only make sure to get a samovar and cups in Kazan and take them with you;\n\nyou know how fastidious you are, and you won’t want to drink from their dirty samovars and teapots when you are among the Tatars, the Cheremises, and the Votyaki. As far as Kazan you will find excellent way stations where you can rest and sit down for a while, but after Kazan it gets worse and worse, although not everywhere. I think there will be two places where you will have to cross the Volga, the ferries are excellent and safe. There will also be the Vyatka, but nothing after that. If you are travelling at the beginning of May, then in the town of Sviazhsk or just before it, you will have to travel four versts by water. But don’t worry, it’s quite safe and easy. You’ll be going by ship, and I hear that those ships can carry a whole regiment. Today they finished painting the walls, and washed the floors, and tomorrow they’ll be painting just the floors in the drawing room, the bedroom, the other places don’t need it. I’m doing everything in my power to please my lovely wife, and I know even now that she will be pleased. I have ordered beds and a cradle. I have given orders that the Lutheran church upstairs60 is not to be demolished before you arrive, when you’ll be able to see for yourself whether you want it removed, in which case it will be done in a few hours. You must be sure to write and let me know the date and even the time of your departure, so that I can work out what time to meet you at the Izhevsk factory or at Sarapul. It’s better to come via Izhevsk, but in any case do whatever suits you. If you don’t want to meet General Neratov’s wife, then come via Sarapul, and let me know so that I can send horses and the various carriages you will need. In springtime the road is very pleasant, there are wonderful views, meadows and woods. However, please remember that at the beginning of May the Volga area is still cold. Goodbye, my Angel, my blessings for you and the children, and a kiss for my brother Aleksandr and my sister, that Angel Katechka. * 10 April. The mail just got here, and I hasten to send these scribblings to my adored friend. They will tell her that not just every day, but every minute I long to be with her. My most precious friend! I am reluctant to tell you how much I miss you for fear that it will encourage you to feel the same way. I really don’t want you to pine, but want you to be in good spirits in Nizhny;61 it’s so\n\nimportant for your health. You just can’t imagine how joyful and delighted I will be to set eyes on your pretty—or rather rosy—plump and cheerful self. I’ll be beside myself, I’ll shout, shriek, and jump up and down with excitement, and squeeze the breath out of you with my embrace. A good mood and disposition promotes health; it’s rare to have one without the other. If you romp and gambol, then I will too, and my working day will seem like a vacation, and everything will become easy for me. But if you start to get bored, then I will too, and my head will grow heavy, and I’ll turn into a grumpy old man. So my beautiful, sparkling star, shine for me and gladden my heart. I’ve just come back from the bathhouse, and I’m not yet fully rested, but supper is ready now. I’m grateful to good-hearted Luisa Karlovna who has taken me under her wing, and makes it her business to see that I am well fed. I have a good dinner, supper, and breakfast with coffee; all this is mostly sent up to my room, but I go to her quarters for dinner. This morning I spent a long time working, right up to four o’clock. I’m getting used to the St. Petersburg way of life, i.e. having dinner at four o’clock. It looks as if I’ll have to make a habit of dining at that time, otherwise it’s a problem. Of course, when you come, we’ll have to agree about that. Bring some vegetable seeds with you for the garden. Luisa has given me a lot, but they all appear to be too old, and also there don’t seem to be any watermelon, melon, cauliflower, or winter radishes among them. Goodbye, my Angel. Stay healthy and in good spirits. I kiss your dear little hands, fingers, feet, knees, cheeks, lips, forehead, eyes, and all of you. Devoted to you heart and soul, your Ilya. A thousand kisses to my dear brother Aleksandr and sister Katechka. Oh, if only Aleksandr could unbend enough to allow Katechka62 to come here to us, I would kneel at his feet, and smother him with kisses, I would consider such a sacrifice a real boon. * * *\n\n9. ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY TO ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA TCHAIKOVSKAYA St. Petersburg, 20 January 1841 Now I’m on my way to Kolpino. The problems with Zina are continuing. I have been received by the Heir to the Throne,63 and was given a very warm\n\nreception. Yesterday I asked Mommy64 to go to see Kavelin65 to make a request for Zina, and that bastard gave her a very cold reception and pretty well flatly refused.66 I’m extremely busy today, but tomorrow I’m going to make another attempt; I’ll ask the chief of staff, and if he’s not willing to help, that’s it, I’ll enroll Zina at my own expense, and if possible at the Patriotic Institute,67 where you went to school, my incomparable Angel, a school of the highest moral standards. I’m thinking of traveling with General Anosov,68 otherwise expect me in a week. My blessing for the children, Kolya and Petya.69 Zina is well. Your faithful, I. Tchaikovsky. * * *\n\n10. ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY TO ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA TCHAIKOVSKAYA 6 August 1844, Votk[insk] Fa[ctory] Sunday My Angel! When I said goodbye to you yesterday evening, I had to hold back my tears, because I didn’t want to seem weak in the eyes of the people around me, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears welled up—and I had to keep my eyes closed while I was trying to comfort Petya who was crying inconsolably because his mommy didn’t take him to St. Petersburg. While I was seeing you off, as well as the whole procession following you, I felt so keenly the pain of separation that I could hardly contain myself. I felt strange, distracted, in a total daze. The horses were ready to go, and Petya had started to calm down. They put him in a carriage with Nad[ezhda] Tim[ofeevna]70 and Pal[ageya?] Petr[ovna]. Six horses and the postillion were there to keep him entertained, but he kept on bursting into sobs, and insisting on catching you up and being put in your carriage. At that moment we rode up. Petya had fallen asleep. Kar[tashev] and Bad[aev]71 were playing pitch and toss out of boredom. I have spent every minute accompanying you in my mind, my incomparable friend! At that time you were probably crying yourself. I consoled myself with the thought that you were not alone, and that [R]omanov was doing his best to supply you with everything you need for a\n\nquiet and comfortable journey. As we were traveling, the way stations flew by as if they were only a kilometer apart. At the third one, while we were changing the horses, I drank a glass of porter, and I took Petya and we walked on ahead. We had covered over two kilometers on foot when we were caught up by the carriages and rode on. At Toykino,72 where I had been advised to go by Vas[ily] Sem[yonovich], we drank tea so as not to use up our travel allowance. The night was dark; I gave Fishka a dressing down for losing the candlestick from your lantern. You didn’t have as much light as on the first night, but I’m sure you slept well. By seven o’clock this morning we were already home. We found everything in order. Sasha73 and Polya74 shrieked when they saw us. The day before Polinka had been washed in the bath, and slept well that night. It seems that he’s over the diarrhea, and at least for now, is doing well. The children went with Nast[enka] and Nad[ezhda] Tim[ofeevna] to the cemetery church for the holiday service, and I was kept busy with the guests and the officials. I’m extremely grateful to Pal. Petrovna for holding Petya in her arms and looking after him for the whole journey. Apart from Kartashev and Badaev no one came to dinner. They left right after dinner, and I went to bed, but I didn’t sleep for long. The mail arrived. There was a letter from Vanya Evreinov.75 He writes that Petinka76 stayed with them for a short time, and that on my name day77 Emilia L[illegible] decorated my portrait with flowers and they had a celebration. There was no important news. The children have gone out for a ride. I’ve been reading the papers. Life is dreary, so dreary without you, my dear good Angel! You’re on your way now, may God bless you! Sleep peacefully, my cherub—I’m going to bed. Bless Kolya for me. It’s striking midnight. * * *\n\n11. ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY TO ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA TCHAIKOVSKAYA 8 August 1844, V[otkinsk] F[actory], Tuesday morning I’m very grateful to Nad[ezhda] Tim[ofeevna]78 and Nastenka79 for taking such good care of me, the children, and the whole house. Each of them has been outdoing the other in trying to please, and so far everything is going perfectly. Nastenka is sleeping in the nursery on Kolya’s bed. The children\n\nare sleeping soundly, thank God, so I too have been sleeping well. Polya went three times early this morning, but is in good health and good spirits, thank God. However, they’ve still been feeding him egg white, and rubbing ointment on his tummy. Sasha is in good health and in high spirits, like an Angel. Since he was punished yesterday, Petya has been sensible and obedient. Everything here is going fine. Please kiss dear Mommy’s hand for me, and a proper kiss for Liza and brother Vasinka.80 May the Lord God bless you! We’ll continue this conversation this evening. Your true friend, I[lya] T[chaikovsky] * * *\n\n12. ILYA PETROVICH TCHAIKOVSKY TO ALEKSANDRA ANDREEVNA TCHAIKOVSKAYA [Votkinsk Factory,] 15 August [1844,] Tuesday evening The picture is of Polenka sitting on my desk, using a feather to sweep up the sand he spilled, and Nastenka is sitting in front of him. After sending you a second letter, or rather a complete account of our domestic events, I went to church with everyone except Polenka. Soon after returning from church I got the sacred icons from Vyatka, that is: St. Nikolai Velikoretsky (Yavlennyi), St. Mikhail, and the Tikvinsk Blessed Virgin. The Father Verger, archpriest of the cathedral,81 took the service. We all prayed for our most precious mama, and for dear Kolya, and for the Lord God to bless your journey. I left the Father Archpriest at home to sample my pies. From my place, he went to our neighbor M. S., and then to Olyshev.82 We dined early. It was a windy day, so the children didn’t go out for a ride after dinner, but agreed among themselves to go and see A[leksandr] Pav[lovich] Alekseev.83 After seven o’clock Nad[ezhda] Tim[ofeevna] together with Lida,84 Petya, and Sasha set off, and Nastenka and I stayed at home with Polya. This time Polya was nice and very amusing. He is beginning to stand up and babble. He’s particularly good at saying: “Give me, take me, go go, here” and an approximation of “pipe” etc. After dinner I was starting to feel bored, but the\n\nchildren entertained me. Then soon after the doctor85 appeared, and we talked with him for rather a long time, and then Olyshev, followed by the police chief,86 and that’s how we whiled away the time until eight o’clock. After Polya had settled down to sleep, we went to fetch the children. We found them playing happily, stayed no longer than three quarters of an hour, and went home. * 16 August. Wednesday Evening. The arrival of the Kartashevs prevented me from chatting with you this morning. They arrived yesterday evening after I had gone to bed, and was obviously sleeping so soundly that I didn’t hear any noise—Pal. Petr. had gone to bed upstairs, and Vas. Sem. in my study. In the morning we talked over tea and coffee. I’m very grateful to him for his help with that business of mine with Izhb.87 By appealing to that old scoundrel’s better self, he managed to talk him round, but it should be said that it was under the influence of his dissolute son that he had behaved so badly. Izhb. willingly agreed to pay 1,800 rubles in September, and gave an IOU to V.S., acknowledging that he had borrowed that sum from him. Now I won’t be dealing with Izhb., but with Kartashev. Although I didn’t receive any money from him, nevertheless the matter is settled, and I intend to pay that official debt also. That’s why I am in a good mood today. Let me know as soon as possible: you didn’t give some money to Florovsky, did you? Now you don’t need to. I’m going to send him the necessary amount officially from the office. Accounts will be settled, and I’ll be relieved. I think you’re due to leave Nizhny today. I hope you managed to cope with the shopping, my dear. I can’t wait to get your letter from Nizhny. Did you buy me a couple of mirrors, some chamber pot covers, and some rugs? Kartashev volunteered to order me some good furniture for the living room; it’s cheap there, so I need to know in detail what exactly you bought there. You will have done very well, if you didn’t forget to buy one or two pieces of that drap de dames88 for the furniture at the fair. The children are well, and have gone to sleep; we played cards. *\n\n17 August. Thursday morning. I can just see you, my true friend, on your way to Moscow. My heart leaps to think that your days and nights are blessed with fine weather. God grant that there be no interruptions in your journey. That’s precisely why it’s so tedious travelling in a caravan, willy-nilly, you have to stop for repairs, or for the horses. The time of your return from St. Petersburg will depend entirely on you. Stay there as long as is necessary to achieve the purpose of the journey, and when you’ve had enough, come home. Try to leave when the sky is light at night, and make a point of letting me know the day you are setting out, the route you’ll be taking, where you intend to spend the night, whether you would think of going to your sister, Katerina Andreevna, or to Ledengsk,89 and the precise day when you expect to arrive. Work it all out carefully. Yesterday, Kartashev and I arranged to meet you if you come via Kazan, or if you come by way of Vyatka, then we’ll meet you there. In either case, apart from the Kazak, Belokrylov, who you’ll find if you place an order, I think maybe in Moscow, or in Yaroslavl, or in Vologda, or in Ledengsk. Anywhere in the Vyatsk province you will be able to place an order through Al. Dm[itrievich] Ignatiev to get an escort and obtain horses immediately. If you feel like going to Ledengsk, which is perfectly possible, then write beforehand to Vanya, or to I[van] Yak[ovlevich], asking to be met in Vologda and escorted to Vyatka. In that case, you’ll need to get a voucher for the horses you need only from St. Petersburg to Vologda. Here am I, prattling on about your return journey, before you’re even ready to leave. So, I hope that before that time comes, you will enjoy yourself in St. Petersburg . . . They have begun painting the nurseries and they’ve put cots in the living room. We went to church, and after dinner went out to accompany the icons, and have just come back. * 18 August. Friday morning. Everything was fine yesterday, we thought Polenka had recovered, but tonight his diarrhea started up again, and he’s already been four times. He probably caught cold when we were out for a ride. It’s really annoying, especially since we’ve been so careful with him, and just to make things worse we’ve been giving him kvass and everything just like the others. The doctor has prescribed some medicine, which we’ll be giving him. God\n\nwilling, it will pass; but we’ll be continuing him on his diet at much as possible. The doctor says the epidemic had all but ended, when the hot weather started, and it is still with us, it brought the diarrhea back with it. To a degree that exonerates me, because perhaps we are not to blame for the relapse, but I think it’s a bit of both, and most of all I blame myself, because yesterday, when I was escorting the icons to Mishkino,90 at Beryozovka,91 I sat him on the sand, which I thought was quite warm, when I shouldn’t have done. But apart from that I blame myself for giving him some pancake at dinner made from rice gruel, which is, of course, not fatty. But whatever the reason, the fact remains that it’s bad, and for that I’m punishing myself by becoming morose, and I won’t be myself again until the thing is over, and the worst of it is I can’t overcome this tedium which is beginning to really get me down. No, my cherub, don’t linger in St. Petersburg out of cowardice, just do what you have to do there, have a good time, and then God speed you home, to me and the children. Ah! how sweet it will be to hug you to my breast! Polenka is constantly in my arms; that’s why my writing is so jerky. He has just been playing with the sand on my desk, but he got tired of it. Petya and Sasha are playing outdoors. Sashechka, thank God, is much better now and has filled out, and is her playful self again. Petya is as sweet as ever. He hardly ever cries. * 6 o’clock. During tea. At the factory, I have a lot to take care of. Olyshev manages things quite well, but he lacks experience, and often forgets things and makes mistakes. S[ofia] I[vanovna]92 is getting treatment and never goes out. At Sashechka’s request, the doctor sent his children round today, and they’ve been kicking up a din upstairs—he himself spent almost the whole evening with me. * 19 August. Saturday morning. Polenka slept well last night, but had to go twice early in the morning. The doctor said that we should continue with yesterday’s medicine, but he’ll probably change it today. Augusta is constantly rubbing Polenka the wrong way; if he sees me, then\n\nhe always rejects her, “Go away, go away!” That’s why she was crying so much yesterday, and got mad at Nad[ezhda] Tim[ofeevna] for taking Polya away from her when she was holding him. Today, my Angel, I’m picturing you in Moscow, or near there. How is the journey? Are you and dear Kolya well? I’m with you in spirit every step of the way, and never even for a moment do I part company with you. You and Kolya are my most precious treasures—how could you ever be far from my thoughts? Thinking about you is sheer joy and a balm to my soul. There is no moment of the day or night when I do not picture you on your journey, or at the way station, and seeing you sitting, resting your dear heads on a pink pillow, seeing you casually watching from your carriage a wood, or a village as it flashes past, something of no interest to you, and which you hardly notice, since your imagination is busy picturing your arrival in St. Petersburg, and relishing the prospect of soon reaching the next station, of quickly changing horses and—but suddenly Fishka93 is reporting that the seventh carriage has a broken wheel, and that V. I. [Romanov] has sent for a carpenter and a blacksmith, and has sent someone to find a comfortable lodging for you. God knows how long you’re going to have to wait while they repair that damned wheel. It’s annoying, but you console yourself with the thought that, although all these delays are a bore, you are perfectly safe. And that’s when you think of me, and say to yourself: “Oh, if only he were here with me! I wonder what they’re doing at home now, Petya, Sasha, Polya. I’m never going anywhere again without my friend.” And I’m never going to let you go anywhere except to take the waters at Sergiev94 together with me and the whole family. It’s only been two weeks since you left, but already I’m going crazy from boredom. * 6 o’clock in the evening. Polenka is better, but we’re still giving him the medicine, and don’t take him out of the room. He’s lost weight, poor thing, and practically never lets me out of his sight, and I can’t bring myself to refuse. I almost forgot to tell you the dream I had today: it seemed that you were married to some handsome, blond young man, and, poor me, I had to be content with trailing after you— and, my God, how galling it was not to be able to see you often. I humbly implore you not to let this happen in real life.\n\n* 20 August 1844, Sunday morning. Bonjour, mon ange! [Good morning, my angel!] Polenka slept well last night, but we are continuing with the medicine. He was in good spirits this morning. He almost gave up going to sleep during the day, but now he’s getting used to it again, and is sleeping longer. So much for him for the time being. For the last few days, there has been no going out for rides. N[adezhda] T[imofeevna] has been going to church with Petya and Sasha. It’s unbearably hot today, the temperature is 21 degrees in the shade, and more than 30 in the sun, so we haven’t let the children go out during the day. Sashenka fell asleep before dinner, and suddenly woke up sobbing from a dream, and Nastenka and I rushed in to see her, and what does she tell us? “Mommy came back from St. Petersburg and didn’t bring me any candy. She gave some to Petya, but not to me.” And that’s why she was so upset. A minute later, she had calmed down, and even laughed at herself. Shultz, the forest warden, came to call. I began to think he might be staying to dinner, but the doctor had already got in first with his dinner invitation. In the course of our conversation I alluded to the trouble in the forestry sector in the presence of Vasiliev. * 7 o’clock in the evening. After dinner I slept for a long time, and that’s why I am so late in writing to you, my incomparable, precious golden-diamond friend, my soul mate, my heart’s delight! God knows what I wouldn’t give just to be allowed a look at you, to touch your little hands and lips. Without you even the brightest days are dark, and my only pleasure is thinking about you and writing these words. You will be holding these sheets of paper in your dear hands, and seeing these words before you see me. I would never have imagined that I could miss you so much, and you haven’t even reached Moscow yet. Of course, you have nearly completed your business, but you should have a chance to stay a while in St. Petersburg, so I still have a long wait before you return. Well, there’s no help for it, I’ll just have to wait it out. The p"
