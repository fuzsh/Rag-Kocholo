I ask the distinguished members of the Council to sit down. Knight Mathias, do you have any questions, requests before meeting?\n\nKnight Mathias. Please forgive me, your Excellency, but I don't understand the reasons why I appeared before such a high Council. Upon returning from Kiev, I wrote a full report about his mission and sent him the Grand master of the order of the Temple, through the commander of the order of the brotherhood Germany Stefan von Lyskirchen.\n\nCommander Henry. My brother Matthias, we have all read your report. But new circumstances arose, forcing us to revisit your mission and to ask you to tell about all its intricacies.\n\nKnight Mathias. My brother, I'm not at liberty to talk about their missions to anyone except his Holiness the Pope, his Majesty the Emperor and his the order of the chief, i.e., commander of the brotherhood, or the Grand master. You it should be well known.\n\nCommander Henry. But do you know, my brother Matthias, who I am?\n\nKnight Mathias. I see that you're my robe Templar brothers.\n\nCommander Henry. I – knight Henry from Angouleme.\n\nKnight Mathias. I have heard about you and I know that you have a high position in our order.\n\nCommander Henry. By the grace of God I am the commander of the order of military brotherhood of Gaza, and Ascalon, to which God and you are worthy to belong. I took this position after death knight from Henri de Toulouse last year. At this time you were doing your mission in Russia and could not know that brother Henri went to the Lord and his place by the will of the Grand master appointed me, sinful and unworthy knight Henry.\n\nKnight Mathias. Eternal memory to our brother Henri, Yes rest his soul with the Holy saints.\n\nHumbly kneel before you, my brother, and the Lord, and all thy powerful hand decorated commander ring brotherhood of Gaza, and Ascalon. Obey every word equal to me divine revelation.\n\nCommander Henry. So be it.\n\nKnight Mathias. I'm sorry, my brother, my Lord, but what happens is still a mystery to me. Accompanying from Kiev to Regensburg, Embassy of the Russian Prince George (Yuri Dolgoruky – approx. transl.), I, like prescribe our order's rule introduced the commander of the German brotherhood of the knights Templar Stefan, got shelter and food in the Abbey of St. Emmeram, wrote a report to the Grand master of the order of his stay in Russia, gave a report from brother Stefan and waited for further instructions.\n\nBut it has been almost three months, and guidance is still not received. Now it turns out that for the consideration of my humble deeds convened such a representative Council. Could not would you like me to explain what's going on?\n\nCommander Henry. My brother Matthias, the reasons for the convocation the Board you'll know in due time, but now such knowledge may affect the accuracy and impartiality of your narrative. So bless you for detailed and sincere story about your mission in Russia. Give you the right not to conceal from the Council, all members of which is duly authorized by his Majesty and his Holiness to review your report and take solution.\n\nKnight Mathias. I hear and obey, my brother, my Lord.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Dear knights of the Temple, all of you discussed? Commander Henry, ready knight Matthias to answer our questions?\n\nCommander Henry. Yes, your Excellency.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Are you ready, my son Matias, to take an oath on the Holy Bible?\n\nKnight Mathias. Ready, your Excellency.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Lead knight Matthias sworn I ask the Bishop to Tybalt.\n\nBishop Tybalt. My son Matias, put your hand on The Holy Bible and repeat after me the oath.\n\nI am humble and sinful servant of Christ Matias from Passau, knight of the order of poor knights of Christ and of the temple of Solomon, before this high Council, gathered in the name of the Lord Jesus Of Christ and blessed his mother, the virgin Mary, solemnly I promise to answer all questions openly, frankly and truthfully. If I will hide from this high Council, may befall me deserved the punishment as the sky and on the ground. Amen.\n\nKnight Mathias. I am humble and sinful servant Of Christ Matias from Passau, poor knight of the order of the Temple, before this high Council, gathered in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the blessed virgin Mary, solemnly I promise to answer all the questions truthfully, openly and candidly. If I something to hide from this Council, may befall me deserved the punishment, in heaven and on earth. Amen.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Now, knight Mathias, what Protocol your name, age, birth place, origin, rank.\n\nKnight Mathias. Matias from Passau, in Bavaria, the son of the free master stone Affairs Hans, was born forty-four years ago, 1113 Christ, baptized in the true Holy Catholic faith in twenty-first day of September of the same year. In 1144 knighted.\n\nCount Wilhelm. When you joined the order of the Temple, knight Mathias, and what rank you had in the order of the brotherhood?\n\nKnight Mathias. In the year 1131 I made pilgrimage to the Holy Land, took monastic vows and joined the order the poor knights of Christ and of the temple of Solomon. First was a novice, then a Sergeant military order of the brotherhood of tyre and Sidon. Then was transferred to non - the military brotherhood of Jerusalem, then – the military brotherhood of Gaza, and Ascalon.\n\nFor their modest merits before the Holy Church was knighted, being in the military brotherhood of Gaza, and Ascalon. As I just said, it was in the forty-fourth year.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Why you moved from Jerusalem to Gaza, my son? You something wrong?\n\nKnight Mathias. It was like the Grand master order, and not for me to discuss his orders.\n\nCommander Henry. Your Eminence, I'll answer your question. Faults nothing to do with it, its members combat brotherhood with necessary, punishes itself, and does not humiliate other brotherhood translation there guilty. Just the fact that the combat brotherhood of Jerusalem deals first of all, an open struggle against the infidels Palestine by the Saracens, and the brotherhood Gaza and Ascalon performs secret mission of the order throughout God's world.\n\nI hope that you will keep this knowledge secret, like everything else that you will hear during the work of our Council.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Commander Henry, you are missing just to remind his Excellency, that the knights Templar severely punishes those who gives out his secrets. Please remember. Bishop Tybalt is a member of Council as you, and similarly gave a vow of silence.\n\nBishop Tybalt. I think, commander, that the rank of legate his Holiness Pope is a serious guarantee of safety and much more important secrets.\n\nCommander Henry. Excuse me, your Eminence, but I had to warn you about the necessity of strict secrecy, it's my duty commander of the order of the brotherhood.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Maybe then I warn?\n\nCommander Henry. Are you kidding me, your Excellency. I never dared to inform the head of the secret service of the Holy Of the Roman Empire.\n\nCount Wilhelm. You flatter me, commander. I lead not all of the Imperial secret service, and the only one that knows the Affairs of other States. But I digress. Knight Mathias, when you got an assignment to go to Russia?\n\nKnight Mathias. The task to go to Russia after annual vacation at his home in Bavaria I got in the forty-third year, while in Baghdad.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And in Baghdad, how did you get my son?\n\nKnight Mathias. Your Eminence, it was related to my previous job, and I'm not sure whether me about it to tell.\n\nCommander Henry. Tell us briefly. I know the job, you performed brilliantly in the fortress of Alamut, and I have no doubt that the story of it will make a favorable impression on the high Council.\n\nKnight Mathias. I hear and obey, my brother, my Lord.\n\nI suppose his lordship and his grace heard of the brotherhood of assassins. Is it worth it detail to dwell on its history?\n\nBishop Tybalt. I admit, I would be interested at least briefly acquainted with her.\n\nKnight Mathias. After the death of godless Mohammed's followers created their faith disintegrated into two warring camps – Sunnis, who were the majority, and the Shiites, whom the Sunnis considered heretics.\n\nCount William. And what the essence of their differences? Recall, please.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Main is that Sunnis believe the false prophet Muhammad the last mediator between people and God, whom they call Allah. Shiites believe that can to be and other intermediaries. Other differences are in some rites, reverence some books, and in vain questions like, who should to be the authority in Islam.\n\nKnight Mathias. The Shiites, too not one hundred years ago, among them the Ismailis, and they can say, had a special faith. According to their doctrine, the world consists of two halves, mirror reflecting each other. And if in earthly life they were bad, they were oppressed, hurt and robbed, then in the hereafter everything should be Vice versa: they will to oppress, to hurt and Rob, not only infidels but also Muslims.\n\nOne of the Ismailis, Hassan Ibn Sabbah, at the end of the last century with his supporters captured the fortress of Alamut – this name is translated from Persian as \"eagle the nest\". The fortress is among the Caucasus mountains, not far from the hyrcanian (Caspian – approx. transl.) sea. There Hasan and founded their little state. Then he took several neighbouring fortresses, but its capital remained Alamut. By the time when I got there, Hassan twenty years as were in the hell fire, but his power was flourishing.\n\nAs Ibn Sabbah knew that his state was too small to contain great and strong army, it is the troops created in Alamut school of the assassins – the secret assassin ready to eliminate anyone, anywhere. The important thing is that instilled in this school, is indifference to his own life and disregard to death. Plus, of course, all the skills of killing and survival in any conditions. Selection into this school is very strict, take it not more than five candidates out of a hundred.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And where is the name of the assassins? Rumor has it that from hashish, which Hasan fooling their supporters.\n\nCommander Henry. If the warrior constantly dizzy hashish, he will never master the martial and secret art.\n\nKnight Mathias. Really this name means only Hasanov, i.e. followers of Hassan Ibn Sabbah. In Arabic it sounds like \"hasanayn\". And the pronunciation of the Christians this took the form of \"assassin\".\n\nBishop Tybalt. But hashish this godless Hasan use? I heard that he could at one stroke hands to get all the guards of Alamut to jump from the walls of the gorge. I guess people first need pretty intoxicating, so they all committed suicide?\n\nCommander Henry. I think your Eminence, that is just rumors: hardly any ruler so unreasonable disposes of his detention.\n\nKnight Mathias. Of course, it is only a rumor, similar to what Hassan-I Sabbah had a lot of doubles, which by his order drugged with hashish, committed self-immolation under the guise of the Hassan, and then he pretended that he rose again from the dead. Or the fact that the dish was placed allegedly severed the head of one of the brothers, and Hassan her \"revived\". All these fair tricks, maybe good for ignorant peasants, but in assassins accept experienced warriors, and deceive them thus, of course, impossible. In Alamut hashish was used no more than in other fortresses East.\n\nMore importantly, Ibn Sabbagh set for all, without exception, very harsh way of life, imposed a strict a ban on any manifestation of luxury, nullified the difference between the lowest and highest sectors of society. He gave his close personal example, until the end his days leading an ascetic lifestyle. Usually simple people respect to such rulers.\n\nAnd, of course, Hassan was very hard even for Eastern standards. Once he ordered the execution of one of his sons only on suspicion of violation of the established laws equality.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Similar equality preach and our heretics-the Bogomils. I have no doubt that all they will burn in hell, like other enemies of the true Catholic faith.\n\nCount Wilhelm. So be it. And what was your job in the fortress of Alamut, knight Mathias?\n\nKnight Mathias. My job was to identify the most dangerous of cooking in Alamut hostile missions and its breakdown.\n\nI got to the fortress in the the thirty-ninth year, and after a few years he became a disciple of the school of assassins.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Judging by the fact that you, knight Mathias, told about strict selection in this school, it was tough.\n\nKnight Mathias. Not easy, your Excellency. I came to Alamut as a lost and half-frozen traveler, he settled in the school of assassins first cleaner, then cook, gradually became acquainted with many students and mentors. And when I expressed a desire to study at school, and it was received kindly. I was twenty-eight years old, at this age in the school has taken.\n\nBishop Tybalt. So you, my son, gave himself for Mohammedan and did all the disgusting Islamic rites?\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, of course.\n\nCommander Henry. Members of the military brotherhood of Gaza, and Ascalon of the order of the poor knights of Christ and of the temple of Solomon permitted sham the adoption of any false faith, and all these sins are remitted to us by indulgence his Holiness the Pope.\n\nBishop Tybalt. My son Matias, forgive my persistence, but the Mohammedans, as well as the Jews, when making their great God of faith are the rite of circumcision? Your deception could be disclosed in any bath, which in the East, as I know, a lot.\n\nKnight Mathias. My brother, my Lord, may I to answer this question of his grace?\n\nCommander Henry. I'll answer that. All members of our military brotherhood, preparing for special missions among Muslims and Jews, circumcision is done.\n\nCount Wilhelm. I know, commander Henry, that you had been circumcised, so if you are someone that surprised, only the Bishop Tybalt and, perhaps, our Secretary Alfred. Tell me, knight Mathias, the representative of the people you claimed? Appearance you do not Arab.\n\nKnight Mathias. A short, thin, blond a lot of people among the inhabitants of the Caucasus, among the nomadic Berbers, among others Mohammedan peoples. The school of assassins people with such an appearance,are particularly appreciated, as if the man looked like an Arab, it is difficult to perform the mission in the Catholic countries.\n\nI pretended to be in Alamut for a Turk-Anatolia, whose mother was a native from the North Caucasus.\n\nBishop Tybalt. My son, you are such an excellent know the Turkish language, which can masquerade as a Turk?\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, your Eminence. I say Turkish as spoken by the natives of Anatolia.\n\nCount Wilhelm. And what other languages do you speak the same excellence, knight Mathias?\n\nKnight Mathias. Arab, Arabian reprimand nomads. After a stay in Russia – in Russian, with the accent of the inhabitants of any of two principalities: Pereyaslavl and Suzdal. Also speak Persian, in Hebrew and Greek, but not so completely to impersonate indigenous Persian, Jew or Greek. And, of course, in one degree or another multilingual Catholic countries.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Knight Mathias, you forgot mention your native tongue and the Latin which, as I see it, well say.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Well, this education deserves respect.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Continue with his story, the knight Mathias.\n\nKnight Mathias. After the school of assassins about two years and finally having gained the confidence of its leaders, I learned that preparing group sending assassins to the king of France, Louis the Young, to rip prepare a speech on a crusade.\n\nI was able to learn the day the departure of these assassins from Alamut, left the fortress after them, and overtook them and destroyed.\n\nCount Wilhelm. And how many were there?\n\nKnight Mathias. Five, your Excellency.\n\nBishop Tybalt. You could single-handedly destroy five killers, trained at the school of the assassins?\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, your Eminence. It was possible due to the fact that they went under the guise of simple peasants in a cart drawn by mules, and of the weapons they had only axes. So when I caught on the fine horse, which I managed to get from the stables of the head school two I was able to shoot from a bow.\n\nCommander Henry. And bow and arrows where did you get brother my? I read your report about this glorious act, but it does not remember.\n\nKnight Mathias. Took killed me guard fortress.\n\nBishop Tybalt. My God, how much blood shed people in our imperfect world.\n\nCommander Henry. Suppose, your Excellency, that the murder of a guard brother Mathias not shed blood, and applied the technique \"Look back\". I guess, my brother?\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, my brother, my Lord.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And what is the reception?\n\nCommander Henry. To the person sneak up behind him, cover for the neck and jerk back and to the side. Neck broken, and the head is unable to control the body. Man can neither move nor to shout nor breathe. After a couple of minutes from lack of air in his mind go blank and he dies.\n\nKnight Mathias. Due to the fact that the person still lives a couple of minutes, but already doomed to inevitable death, the assassins called this technique \"Deprivation of hope.\"\n\nBishop Tybalt. Sounds even more inhuman.\n\nCommander Henry. And the remaining three of you, my brother Mathias, as I recall from your report, killed by the sword?\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, my brother, my Lord. In school assassins pay much attention to the secret ways of killing, and much less – fencing and other techniques noble knight fight. In this sense the level of training in the order of the poor knights of Christ and of the temple of Solomon much higher.\n\nHowever, with the sword I killed only two. I managed to disarm and to learn from him the missing information about the impending murder of the French king, and also about the organization the assassins in the Holy Roman Empire and other Christian countries.\n\nCount Wilhelm. And I heard that the assassins are not given their secrets even under pain of death.\n\nKnight Mathias. Depending death your Excellency. If the caught assassin knows that he is dealing not with some of the Imperial executioner, and with a knight of the Temple, choose not slow and painful death under torture, during which he still will tell, and instant death from a blow with a dagger.\n\nSo this killer told me everything he knew, and received a deserved reward in the form of an easy death.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Are you saying, my son, that if you place this assassin, you too would have revealed the secrets of their order?\n\nCommander Henry. We, the Templars, understand that there is torture, which cannot move anybody. Not because it is impossible to sustain pain itself, but because sooner or later a person in pain goes crazy and unable to control himself. Sometimes a man starts to kiss the hands of his tormentor, pleading not even on the termination of torture, and the protection and patronage.\n\nI believe that if you your Eminence, subjected known to torture you too would have given all mysteries of the Holy see.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Commander Henry, you re forgotten.\n\nKnight Mathias. I'm sorry, my brother, my Lord, but I also try to give an answer to his grace. The duty of well-trained and highly experienced knight of the order of the Temple – not to surrender alive, and to kill a immediately see that the prisoner is inevitable. The assassin not did he paid the secrets of your brotherhood.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Thank you for the clarification, son Mathias.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Valiant knight Mathias, and why after so laudable deeds you went to Baghdad?\n\nKnight Mathias. These assassins were soon to meet their accomplices, and I knew that they will be missed, connects their disappearance with my escape from school, and then after me will hunt the best forces of their brotherhood.\n\nCommander Henry. The head brother Matthias was assigned to the small reward.\n\nKnight Mathias. That is why I went not to the West and the East, directly through the mountains. I decided that there, in the heart of Baghdad Caliphate, look for me no one will guess. The going was hard, passes was snowy, and I was weakened by the wound in his shoulder, received in battle with assassins. But I, with God's help, managed to reach Baghdad. There I was, as expected, found the commander of the local secret brotherhood of our order, received shelter and food, wrote the report and was waiting for a new job.\n\nKnight from Henri de Toulouse, the then commander of the military brotherhood of Gaza, and Ascalon, was pleased to resolve that while I'm looking for assassins, among the Mohammedans I do not work. So it was decided to send me to Russia, after giving an opportunity to the course of the year to relax at home and finally to heal his wound.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And if it was not severely from the the chiefs of the knights Templar – after the hot climate of Palestine send knight Matthias to Russia, famous for its frosts?\n\nCommander Henry. We, the poor knights of Christ and of the Temple Solomon, are obliged to serve the Holy Church in all conditions, from the Arabian Sands to the North of snow.\n\nCount Wilhelm. But the road to Germany from Baghdad all still not escape from Palestine. You, knight Mathias, was not afraid to fall into the hands of of the assassins?\n\nKnight Mathias. Of course, your Excellency, some the risk was, but couldn assassins carefully examine all the caravans, they were not enough people. Besides, I while in Alamut the school has grown a great beard, and in Baghdad shaved it off, and get to know me was it is not easy. So I hired a muleteer to German merchants, who traveled from China along the silk road, and reached Regensburg.\n\nI was knighted, and I was given a sabbatical year that I was able to spend at home in Passau near my elderly father, who was very glad of my arrival. For my modest merit order generously gave me money, and I built for my dad a large new house.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Unless permitted poor knight the order of the Temple to own a house?\n\nKnight Mathias. Of course not. But I have built house for his father. After his departure from the earthly life I this house will inherit and will give the order.\n\nCount Wilhelm. And, father, you said that dedicated in the knights? It would probably be this happy.\n\nKnight Mathias. No doubt, your Excellency, that it was making him happy. But the late commander Henry has been pleased to decide that before the trip to Russia my knighting was to remain a secret for all. And this decision was wise, as in Russia, I had to play the role Mason.\n\nCommander Henry. And what did you tell him how where did you get the money?\n\nKnight Mathias. I told him that earned them engaging in the Holy Land and construction contracts, and my father was very happy. I believe that ensuring a dignified old age for parents is the duty of every Christian. I have not seen their parents for thirteen years, and knew that I soon will have them again for a long time to leave, so tried to be thoughtful son.\n\nCount Wilhelm. A laudable veneration parents, knight Mathias.\n\nCommander Henry. Some falsely assume the order of the poor knights of Christ and of the temple of Solomon consists of soulless warriors, not know any warm feelings. This is not so. Not only the order of the Hospitallers, but the knights Templar contains hospitals, hospice and an orphanage, generously distributes alms, do not leave without care of the aged brothers.\n\nBishop Tybalt. I am moved by the true Christian the relation of the Templars to the poor, the elderly and orphans, but I know that on the orders their orders bosses they can't kill that poor, elderly and orphans, and their parents.\n\nCommander Henry. Your Excellency, can you tell us at least one case of murder Templar their parents?\n\nBishop Tybalt. I specific cases is unknown.\n\nCommander Henry. Then I ask you not to talk about you do not know.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Well, then I ask the question knight Mathias, who is under oath and must tell the truth. Son my Mathias, if commander Henry ordered you to kill your father, you would did it?\n\nKnight Mathias. I'd done my duty.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Order or FILIAL?\n\nCount Wilhelm. Thank God, need to kill the honourable Hans from Passau and, I hope, will not arise, and without necessary, commander Henry, of course, such orders not to give will. So please stop the discussion of abstract questions and return to the report of the knight of Mathias. As I understand it, valiant knight, on Russia you need was to go be a Mason?\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, your Excellency. In the spring of forty the fifth year I was invited to Landshut, where at that time was the commander Henri, and got the job. In the centre of Speyer (another version of the Russian spelling the name of the city of Speyer. Approx. transl.) during this time he studied Russian master-builders, and I had to meet with them and go with them to Russia.\n\nBishop Tybalt. But as Russian masters were in Speyer?\n\nKnight Mathias. The great Imperial Cathedral in Speyer – a role model for the Church builders from all over the world, and there often come to study masters from different countries. Besides, the Cathedral is not built completely, and masters can be trained directly at the construction site: completed side naves, portals, arches, surrounding buildings, among the Bishop's courtyard.\n\nTherefore in Speyer and came to work and share our experience in the construction of Russian masters led by architect Savva Nazirovich. Sent them the Prince of Suzdal earth George, nicknamed Dolgoruky. The one who now reigns in Kiev, there is not just a Prince and Grand Duke.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Was. Let it be known, knight Mathias, Grand Duke George gave up the Ghost two months ago, in the fifteenth day of may.\n\nKnight Mathias. This is news to me, your Excellency. Am I allowed to know the cause of death of Prince George?\n\nCommander Henry. You'll know it at the time, brother my Mathias. Yet, your debt is detailed and accurate story.\n\nKnight Mathias. I hear and obey, my brother, my Lord.\n\nWhat in Speyer worked Suzdal wizard created for me a great opportunity to get to Russia with them, not hiding the fact that I'm German, and not trying to pretend a Russian before studying in the perfection of the Russian language. So I had to meet and make friends with these masters, and when they will return to his Principality, to go along with them, pretending to be going there work on the construction. In fact, I had to spend in Suzdal the ground only the time necessary to study the General situation in the country, habitsthe Russian people, and the main thing – the Russian language, to such an extent that easily to pass for a Russian. After that, I had to move to Russia.\n\nBishop Tybalt. My son, do Suzdal the Principality is not in Russia?\n\nKnight Mathias. It depends on where to watch. If the Holy Roman Empire, and Suzdal, and Kiev and Novgorod, and Pereyaslavl and Chernigov – Russian city. But if you look inside Russia, actually Rus called only the oldest land in the South – Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Pereiaslav Principality, sometimes even only Kiev Principality. And Suzdal is located in Zalesie over the dense forests on the North-East of the country, so it is commonly called Rus, Suzdal, the title of one of the oldest cities.\n\nCommander Henry. Similarly, the Arabs call us all the Franks, regardless of whether it is French, German or Italian.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Clear. But since we're look out Empire, then still, let's call Russia, the country as a whole, and to think that Suzdal is located in the North-East of Russia, and Kiev in the South. Otherwise we will get confused, where Russia where not Russia.\n\nKnight Mathias, you asked you define the job that gave you the late commander Henry.\n\nKnight Mathias. I was ordered to meet by Prince Iziaslav Mstislavich, who then ruled in the city of Pereyaslavl (now Pereyaslav-Khmelnitsky – approx. transl.), in two or three days ' journey from Kiev. I had to do Izyaslav I contribute to its enthronement in Kiev, and he, if successful, invites to Russia legate his Holiness the Pope leads the country to the Holy true cross.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Why you are told to do such a proposal is Pereyaslavl Prince Izyaslav, not to Suzdal Prince George?\n\nCommander Henry. Your Excellency, on this issue can I answer as a sign that preceded the mission of brother Mathias at Russia.\n\nWe knew from our representative at the court of the Polish Prince, Izyaslav Mstislavich ready to rapprochement with the Holy Catholic Church, and one of the officials of Pereyaslavl Prince led the negotiations with the Chancellor of Poland.\n\nThere were indirect evidence of the readiness of Izyaslav to accept the true faith. Prince Of Poland Boleslaw Curly married his niece, the king of Hungary Geza – his sister, kinship Izyaslav had with Vladislav, Prince of Bohemia (the Czech Republic – approx. transl.). In addition to family ties, Izyaslav were allied relations with Poland, Hungary and Bohemia.\n\nAnd George at that time was seen as a serious contender for the throne of Kiev. It was Prince to the far North-Eastern edge of Russia, and the work of his master in Speyer has created a good opportunity to visit the Russia of knight Mathias, no more.\n\nCount Wilhelm. But George was the son of Kiev Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh.\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, your Excellency, but one of the a younger son, a child having received from the father in the reign of marginal Suzdal. The Monomakh had many children, and when I was going to go to Russia, was still alive, one of his older sons, much older George, – Vyacheslav. He reigned in the small town of Turov.\n\nIzyaslav was although not the son and grandson of Monomakh, but a descendant in the senior line, his father Mstislav Putin also ruled in Kiev, Izyaslav age and George was about the same, and so Izjaslav could have become of the Kiev Grand Duke.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And who reigned in Kiev when you came to Russia?\n\nCommander Henry. For five years there reigned not Monomakhovichi and II of Kiev – Vsevolod.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Then why didn't you do that the proposal Vsevolod Olgovich?\n\nCommander Henry. Vsevolod became Grand Prince of Kyiv, if I am not mistaken, in the thirty-ninth year, and soon in Russia was sent the Embassy headed by our brother He from Caesarea, a member of the The General Chapter of the order of the Temple. The aim of the Embassy was such offer Vsevolod. But the Grand Duke refused to knight he is in the audience and ordered the Embassy to immediately leave Russia.\n\nTherefore, we made the decision to secretly send to Russia brother Matthias, as it is not in this order so prominent, as the brother Arnulf, and experienced in covert acts.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Dear knights of the Temple, will ask you to tell about the genealogy of Russian princes little more, for I am not wise With the Lord in it. Monomakhovichi – clearly, a descendant of Vladimir Monomakh. And Ol?\n\nCommander Henry. The son of Oleg Svyatoslavich, cousin Monomakh.\n\nKnight Mathias. Let me tell you, as before going to Russia, I studied the history of this country.\n\nRussian princes have their the origin of the Norman Rurik, who lived three hundred years ago. But perhaps it makes sense to start with the deceased a hundred years ago the great Prince Yaroslav, which the Russians called Wise, and in which Russia was included into number of the strongest States in God's world.\n\nWhen Yaroslav died, after he left several sons. According to the customs of Oriental despotism, all of them, except older, had to be killed, not to create strife.\n\nCount Wilhelm. According to the customs of enlightened monarchies, all the sons of the ruler should be with his father, under his vigilant supervision, and after his father's death under the supervision of the eldest brother, and only the most trusted of they can be sent to other areas of the country, not rulers, and governors.\n\nKnight Mathias. But in Russia, your Excellency, all it was different. Izyaslav, Svyatoslav and Vsevolod, the sons of Yaroslav, during the life of the father got their own Principality, which gradually became their hereditary possession.\n\nFather Vsevolod II Of Kiev was Oleg, son of Svyatoslav Yaroslavich. Father of George Dolgoruky, and his grandfather Izyaslav Mstislavich of Vladimir Monomakh, son of Vsevolod Yaroslavych.\n\nBishop Tybalt. How did monotonous Russian princely names. Entirely Izjaslava, Vsevolod, Vladimir...\n\nCommander Henry. Yes, and almost all the sovereign princes. Almost all of them claim to special principalities for their children.\n\nYaroslav, dividing the country among his sons, has commanded that Kiev was owned by the eldest in the family, and the rest the princes obeyed his Supreme authority. But his descendants, the Lord gave a rare fertility: three – five sons and many daughters – here it is normal. And the sort of Yaroslav gradually so multiplied, and was divided, that if in the first generation was still possible to clearly identify older, then there was great confusion, generating an endless fragmentation of the country and internecine war.\n\nBishop Tybalt. During the war even undeniable seniority rarely respected, dominates only strength.\n\nCount Wilhelm. I wonder why so short-sighted Prince Yaroslav remained in the memory of descendants with the nickname Wise.\n\nCommander Henry. This can only guess, your Excellency.\n\nBishop Tybalt. But Vladimir Monomakh, as I I remember that was the sole ruler? Or am I mistaken?\n\nKnight Mathias. Monomakh, indeed, gradually conquered a Russian Principality, but not for long, not fully. For example, ruled in Chernigov land, the descendants of Svyatoslav Yaroslavich, although he admitted his Supreme power, but not fully obeyed him.\n\nAfter the death of Vladimir Monomakh in 1125, Grand Prince of Kiev became his son Mstyslav, the father of the Izyaslav, to which I was directed. When Mstislav Vladimirovich in Russia had been more or less calm. Died this Prince, if I am not mistaken, in the thirty-second year, and in Kiev began to rule his younger brother Yaropolk, and Izyaslav Mstislavich Pereyaslavl received one of the largest and oldest cities Russia.\n\nBut soon Yaropolk, in the avoidance of displeasure of the brothers, took Pereyaslavl Izyaslav, and gave him two a small town Pinsk and Turov. In the town of Turov was transferred Vyacheslav Vladimirovich – the son of Monomakh, the younger brother of Mstislav and Yaropolk, the elder brother of George Dolgorukiy. But he did not long remain there and returned to Tours, expelling Izyaslav. Devoid reign, Izyaslav went to Novgorod, where the rules his younger brother, Vsevolod Mstislavich, and from there they entered into the possession of his uncle – Dolgoruky. George in the battle on the mountain Ganoi repelled their invasion, but thenThe mstislavichi together with Vsevolod and Svyatoslav Olegoviches attacked Pereyaslavl and Kyiv.\n\nYaropolk was forced to cede and transfer Izyaslav Vladimir Volynsky, a large city in South-West Russia.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Not tired yet, your Eminence, from the vicissitudes of Russian strife?\n\nBishop Tybalt. In any case, your Excellency. Knowledge of the knight of Mathias in the history of Russia deep, the story interesting and fascinating, and in this regard I recall the words of Scripture: \"If the Kingdom is divided against itself cannot stand that Kingdom\". And you can specify why Prince Vladimir was surnamed Monomachos? There was also a Byzantine the Emperor...\n\nCommander Henry. Yes, your Eminence, and Prince Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh on the maternal side was the grandson of the Emperor.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And George Dolgorukiy why got this nickname? Remember the so-called ancient Persian king Ahasuerus – for the craving for profit.\n\nKnight Mathias. George got his nickname, when I was in Russia, and was originally the Prince is so called precisely of the thirst for profit, when he ruled in Kiev and was mercilessly besieged Kiev taxes. However, then the approximate George made up less offensive interpretation of what he, ruling in Suzdal, fought for Kiev, that is, as if stretched out his hands in southern Russia.\n\nCommander Henry. All right, brother Mathias. And I still add to your story that Yaropolk Vladimirovich died in the thirty-eighth, and soon Kiev was captured Vsevolod II – as you know, the representative of another branch of the descendants of Yaroslav. George Dolgorukiy tried to speak out against Vsevolod, but to no avail. Soon the great Prince Vsevolod reasonably lost Izyaslav Mstislavich Pereyaslavl, and in Russia, finally, to establish peace.\n\nIn the forty-fifth year, when Russia was sent to the knight Mathias, there was still calm. Further the events he witnessed, and not only witnessed but also a party, and he will tell you better than me.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Please, knight Mathias.\n\nKnight Mathias. Before going to Russia I met in Regensburg with the knight He from Caesarea, our noble brother in Christ and a member of the General Chapter of our order. Brother Arnulf in opportunities have prepared me for the trip, telling what he knew about this the country during his stay there. I have read and I am devoted to Russia,the work of Tamara, Bishop of Merseburg. The main conclusion, which I then made for myself: half a century ago, at the Kiev Grand Prince Vladimir the Baptist, the father Yaroslav the Wise, the Holy Catholic Church almost didmissionary work in Russia and made her baptism in the Byzantine faith, and now it's time to catch up. Byzantium is now much weaker than in those times, and its serious interference can not be expected.\n\nThen I went to Speyer.\n\nBishop Tybalt. You went to Speyer, then to Russia, under his own or under an assumed name, my son?\n\nCommander Henry. Your Eminence, if you read carefully the report of brother Matthias, you could see that under his.\n\nBishop Tybalt. I have carefully read the report, but ask those questions that I see fit.\n\nCount Wilhelm. It seems to me, commander Henry, that you again forgotten. I remind you that we need to check how exactly knight Mathias realized my job, how I did it, and how outlined the progress of in its report. To do this, we are forced to ask those questions, it would seem, has been previously received satisfactory answers. Otherwise it would not make sense in the work of our Council.\n\nCommander Henry. I apologize to him grace.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Commander Henry, your experience for brother Matthias commendable, and not feel entitled for you to be offended, especially the Savior said, \"judge Not, that ye be not judged\". Go on, my son Mathias.\n\nKnight Mathias. Indeed, it was agreed that the easiest way is not to invent for me a new name and origin, and I arrived in Speyer as Matias from Passau, a bricklayer and stone Mason's son. Had to invent only work on the construction in the Holy Land, but I am good enough I know there temples and fortresses and can answer any questions about them. I have said that at the time of my arrival the great Imperial Cathedral in Speyer was in General, ready, completed a lateral naves, portals and the surrounding buildings including the Bishop's yard. I was going to get to worka bricklayer. More precisely, pretended that he was going.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And this Savva, the second part of the name which I can't spell...\n\nKnight Mathias. Nazirovich is a patronymic, your Eminence. The noble and respected people in Russia are named not only for its behalf, but on behalf of his father. Therefore, for simplicity, we can talk about it Sawa.\n\nBishop Tybalt. This Sava – the Abbot? We have almost all architects abbots or just monks.\n\nKnight Mathias. No, your Eminence, a noble and sovereign Russian nobleman. In Russia such people are called \"nobles\", which can be translated as \"great people\". Savva occupied high public office of the captain, meaning \"head of thousands\".\n\nCount Wilhelm. But if Sava – Russian sovereign nobleman and high-ranking government official, he certainly did not work directly on the construction site. How did you manage to make friends with him? Over come with him artisans?\n\nKnight Mathias. Using the mechanics – the way is very long since in Russia the nobles have little contact with artisans. Moreover, become a friend of a craftsman means to discredit itself in the eyes of the Lord. So was necessary to make friends with Savva Nazirovich.\n\nAs you quite rightly noticed, your Excellency, Sava rarely appeared on the site: mainly, he studied the great Cathedral and received General skills building calculations from the abbé background Vertern, Speyer architect. Worked on the construction site only two who came with him artisans, but, as I said, I was not need. Needed Savva.\n\nI had to resort to the reception called in our order of \"Charge for rescue\" and assassins \"Mirage the oasis\".\n\nBishop Tybalt. And what is the reception with such strange name, my son?\n\nKnight Mathias. This salvation from the imaginary attack, your Eminence. I found out what time Savva Nazirovich usually returned to the Inn in the evening: he loved to go in pubs, then walked down the street in a strong drunk. I went to the outskirts of Speyer, found there are a few vagrants, paid them and persuaded to attack the architect, when he will return home in the evening, ostensibly to beat and Rob. Savva – the man is fat and short, so many vagrants were not required. They attacked, and at the right moment I stepped in, the attackers beat up and chased them away.\n\nSavva was me immensely grateful, he invited me to his place, we drank and became friends. The following the day I showed him and his companions several techniques that facilitate the treatment stone, and they had finally filled me with respect. About a week we the architect visited each other, I told him about Germany, I – about Russia. It turned out that Prince George had sent him to learn from the experience of our architects and master masons, but the deposits of natural stone in Suzdal the land has not yet been found, and there were built only of wood or plinth, as almost everywhere in Russia.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Plinfa? What is it, knight Mathias? In Greek this word means stove.\n\nKnight Mathias. Your Excellency, plinthite in Byzantium called flat brick, usually of irregular shape. Russia together with the Byzantine accepted the Byzantine methods of construction, and all the temples in all the principalities of Russia, except for the Galician and Suzdal, and now built or from plinfy or in mixed technique – with the addition of rough stone. To put it simply, cobbles.\n\nSuch construction very cheap and requires no searching quarries: a good clay cannot be found except in the mountains or deserts. And the skillful firing of the bricks is very strong, much stronger than many types of stone.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Then why Prince George at all decided to build out of stone? Would build of time, since it is cheaper and stronger.\n\nKnight Mathias. I dare say, your Eminence, you could ask the same question to any of our Margrave or Duke, we, too, all the churches are built of stone. This is our Imperial tradition, established since the times of Ancient Rome. Of brick, different from plinfy only more precise moulding, we also build, but usually it is either household buildings or churches in the villages. For example, near my home Passau, in the village of Allersberg on a tributary of the Danube. the Church is built of such brick.\n\nBishop Tybalt. In my country, in Lombardy, and large temples built of brick.\n\nKnight Mathias. But then either they are faced with stone, as the city's Cathedral in Modena, or the lining was provided, but for some reason not done or not completely done.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Yes, that's right. So it happened the Duomo Cathedral of St. Ambrose, and St. Michael Church in Pavia.\n\nCommander Henry. How do you, my brother Matthias, profound knowledge in how built the Lombard churches?\n\nKnight Mathias. In my youth, I traveled to Lombardy from father, and he told me about it in detail. I was always interested in construction the case, and if I, by the will of God was not a Templar, he would have become a bricklayer.\n\nCount Wilhelm. As we build, of course. And Dolgoruky what was build out of stone?\n\nKnight Mathias. Dolgoruky wanted to build the same as in the Holy Roman Empire, for it is the expression of the power and glory of his Principality. That's why he sent his masters study in Speyer, not in Kiev or in Byzantium. Pity, then, in the forty-fifth, it was still unclear. I decided that's just a whim of the small Northern chieftain. I confess, this error occurred my fault.\n\nCommander Henry. My brother Matthias, this error was not only and not so much your fault. You before departure in Speyer consulted with the brother He from Caesarea, and it was he, not once been to Russia had to wonder if George accidentally sent in Speyer Sava and advise you to make George the same suggestion, what did you do Izyaslav. Perhaps, then, events would have gone differently.\n\nKnight Mathias. Brother Arnulf little versed in construction and could not appreciate the importance the directions of the architect Savva in Speyer.\n\nBishop Tybalt. I'm glad my son Matias, are you ready to admit their mistakes and not trying to anyone to separate them. But I fear that it is not only one of the errors committed by you.\n\nCommander Henry. To err is human, and do not mistake only he who does nothing.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Not get ahead of ourselves. Tell in order, knight Mathias. You said that you became friends with Sawa.\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, your Excellency. And I learned from Savva Nazirovich that Prince George was going to be built from natural stone, but the stone he had not. Deposits of stone were found only in the Galician the Principality, and this is the other end of Russia: Suzdal is located in the North-East, Galich in the South – West, and between them not one week. Of course, to carry the stone from Galicia it was impossible.\n\nTherefore, Russian the architect was very interested in how to find deposits of stone. But on the construction Speyer Cathedral, one he could not help: the quarries around the city appeared two hundred years ago.\n\nI knew, as being the search for the stone and its production in Palestine, Sawa offered their services and immediately was invited to Russia. I was promised content Sotsky, and it is in Russia pretty important state and military position, roughly translated as \"chief of hundred\".\n\nCommander Henry. My brother Mathias, and when you have time learn how we are searching for deposits of the stone in the Holy Land? Do you have had time to the quarry? After all, the duty Sergeant of the order of poor knights of the Temple is very cumbersome, and served you very different mission, not related to construction.\n\nKnight Mathias. My brother, my Lord, I am the son a stone Mason and studied with his father until he went pilgrimage to the Holy Land. And then, in Palestine, the stone as such is not to be found, he comes to the surface almost everywhere. Difficulties arise only in the selection of good and bad types stone, and this requires a trial punching of the layers. But still it's all done near the building: the most remote of quarries I've seen at the Belvoir, in Galilee, there is a stone chapel was carried seven miles (15 kilometers – approx. transl.).\n\nWe in Germany look the stone is harder because it is not everywhere, and its deposits are hidden under the ground. But on the slopes of ravines sometimes you can see exposed layers of rock under opolska soil, and along the banks of rivers – screes, indicating that there deposits. All this taught me dad in childhood. However, the search stone in our country is simplified by the fact that the quarry has been spent already not the first hundred years, and the question is only in their extension and discovery of new layers. For example, around my home Passau under the high banks of the Danube is many quarries.\n\nSo show Sawa your knowledge in this area I was easy. I hadn't imagined how hard can it be to move from words to deeds and to find the stone in Suzdal. But then, in Speyer, it was unclear even whether there is generally in Zalesie but here I not only went to a calculated risk, but honestly warned architect about the possible failure of the case. For credibility, I even expressed fear before the possible wrath of the Prince Dolgoruky, if the stone can not find. On reality, of course, the Prince's wrath I fear it was not necessary: even if hedecided to put me in prison, I managed to flee.\n\nBishop Tybalt. You sound so sure, my son, that you managed to escape?\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, I can escape from almost any prison.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Aren't you arrogant? So ? Russian prison – okay, maybe they're not so strong, but ours, for example?\n\nKnight Mathias. Your Eminence, I said from almost any. Of course, the one who knows that it is a member of the military brotherhood Gaza and Ascalon, can create such conditions that I can't even think about escape. But from any prison, which put ordinary people, I will be able to run, there are many ways. That's why I felt no fear before the wrath of the Russian Prince.\n\nBut Savva Nazirovich believe in my sincerity, assured me of their support and promised more additional award in the case of finding the stone. And the salary of the Russian Sotsky was considerable and justified the risk to any other Mason, if he's in my spot. And soon we went.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Driving you must be on Rus regular merchant way – through one of our Northern cities, Hamburg or Bremen then in the East sea (the Baltic – approx. transl.), then through a large Russian city of Novgorod, and from there to Suzdal?\n\nKnight Mathias. Your Excellency, your knowledge extensive, the path of the Holy Roman Empire to Russia, indeed, is used most often. It is not the shortest, but it does not go through any other countries that may be hostile.\n\nBut we have not gone North and South by the Danube and the Russian sea (Black – approx. transl.), since I was invited Sava and his companions to stay at my venerable parents in Passau. We still went worked in Speyer, the Builder of Galich: South path for him, too, was more convenient.\n\nMy father was very happy I'm going to work to Russia in the high rank Sotsky, told all that he knew about search quarries, and gave me a samples of building stone, so I can compare them with those who find in Russia.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And you're not afraid to invite to your home of the barbarians?\n\nKnight Mathias. Excuse me, your Excellency, Yes what are they barbarians? Nice and friendly people. Savva Nazirovich well spoke Latin, and two of his fellow-craftsmen during his stay in Speyer, though not fluent, but have studied German.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Suppose the architect Savva and his satellites, while in Germany, tried to behave the best way. But Russia clothing, manners, habits, customs isn't barbaric?\n\nKnight Mathias. Certainly, your Excellency. Dresses there the people, in my humble opinion, not worse than in the Empire, and all the assumptions we have stories about Russian barbarians, dressed in raw animal skins, – the same, God forgive me, nonsense, as stories about living in China people with dog's heads. Very different from our only clothes and weapons local soldiers, and that's more due pointed helmets, which in our army no. About these helmets are incorrect in hostile areas Palestine.\n\nPerhaps the only thing what looks different from the Russian citizens and of our Empire and the countries of the East, – the fact that in Russia the majority of people somehow has the faces very grim expression. Why it happened – don't know how to actually relationship simple Russian people are quite peaceful and good-neighbourly, if only they do not involve the princes in their feuds. Fighting there often occur due to of the Vice of drinking, this Vice is the cause of most murders.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Unfortunately, this Vice has place in our Imperial cities, and how often, or more often known only The Lord, as it is impossible to count.\n\nCount Wilhelm. But if Russian princes have their the origin of the Norman Rurik, then, probably, the feasts they are in the spirit barbaric feasts of the tales about Valhalla?\n\nKnight Mathias. Differently, your Excellency. I seen in Russia and is quite gracious and dignified feasts, and those where guests get drunk to the point that he could not get up from the table. In General, we have so and no barbarism I do not see here.\n\nCommander Henry. Us martial brothers in Gaza and Ascalon, it is recommended to respect the peoples among whom have to work, even if it is heathen Arabs, Turks or Jews. Russian Christians, although the Byzantine style.\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, and customs are completely Christian. Of course, there are pagan traditions, but there is enough and among the peoples of our Empire.\n\nCommander Henry. Respecting people quickly get used to its customs and its become in this nation. I am not a deep connoisseur The Holy Scriptures, but it seems that even our Lord Jesus Christ was talking about in the future there will be neither Greek nor Jew.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Commander Henry, a connoisseur of The Scriptures you really are not, for it was written by the Apostle Paul in The Epistle to the Colossians.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Thanks for the clarification, your Eminence, but in General I like the reasoning of the knights of the Temple. Continue his story, knight Mathias.\n\nKnight Mathias. Stayed three days at my venerable parents, we moved on, down the Danube. From Passau to Russia you can get short land route through Bohemia, but this way is through the mountains, and the merchants prefer to sail on rivers, especially in Russia still most of the roads and river, on dry land there is almost no travel, except the so-called winter – sled tracks on the ice of frozen rivers.\n\nSo we went with a large merchant caravan down the Danube to the town of Kiliya, and there boarded a marine ship and sailed along the coast of the Russian sea to the mouth of the Dniester, where is Belgorod.\n\nCount Wilhelm. If my memory serves me, in ancient times the Dniester was a Greek city of Tiras.\n\nKnight Mathias. Quite true, your Excellency. Now it is Belgorod. There was separated the Builder of Galich: he moved on to the merchant ship, going up the river Dniester. We Savva and two of Suzdal artisans sailed across the sea to the mouth of the Dnieper, where is the city Oleshshya. There we again boarded the river ship and on the Dnieper river rose to Kiev. This road at that time was safe.\n\nCount Wilhelm. At the same time? And when it happens unsafe?\n\nKnight Mathias. It depends on the steppe nomads owns the lower reaches of the Dnieper. Generally, merchant caravans they robbed, Yes it is not easy, as the Dnieper river is wide and deep, and shore to reach ships very difficult, the distance is too great even for archery. But on the river there are several rapids, and through them we have to move ship land – in Russia these places are called \"roads\". Around these roads usually there is a small settlement, and that they sometimes attack the nomads.\n\nYet, since the nomads come from the East, where there is a tradition of integrity merchants, they prefer to Rob trade settlements and the surrounding area of southern Russian cities.\n\nMemorable Prince Vladimir Monomakh caused the nomads a number of severe defeats, and since they usually attack Russia only during the time of princely feuds, at the invitation of one or other Prince who employs them in the war against their relatives. But then, in the forty-fifth year, Russia was still.\n\nCommander Henry. And sea and river robbers?\n\nKnight Mathias. My brother, my Lord, such thieves are everywhere – and on the Dnieper, and the Danube river and the Mediterranean sea. But Kiev we went with a large merchant caravan, and they are afraid to attack. Their victims are usually single ships.\n\nCommander Henry. But Savva was not afraid to go through Kiev? If Grand Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev was at odds with George Dolgorukiy, could he hold masters and get to work on yourself? Or even execute to deprive the enemy of the ability to build temples and fortresses?\n\nKnight Mathias. Savva Nazirovich was well aware of the princely strife, and knew that at the time Vsevolod was with Dolgoruky although not in the best relations, but in the world. And, of course, the architect had all the necessary security certificates.\n\nCount Wilhelm. By the way, about Kiev. His grace talked about the barbarism of Russian, you disagreed with him. In your opinion, Kiev is also not barbaric city?\n\nKnight Mathias. In General – perhaps not, your Excellency, although there are traits that I would call barbaric. They there are both in Kyiv and in other Russian cities, where I had a chance to visit.\n\nFirst of all, of course, for the fortifications, which in Russia is very weak. They are based on low and not very steep shafts, about five to seven cubits (3-4 meters – approx. transl.) height. Before the shafts is as shallow ditches, usually boggy. On the shafts is low, also five – seven cubits, log the walls, which consist of filled land of log cabins from the battle move upstairs. Sweep away from the shaft these walls with the help of a little bit of modern siege equipment is not difficult. Shafts inside the fortified wooden huts, but the defense it did not strengthen, as if the fortress walls are so weak, when siege to destroy the shafts themselves there is no need.\n\nThe gate tower in Rusi also wooden, except only a stone's Golden gate in Kiev. More no towers, useful for strengthening of defense, Russian fortresses there.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Judging by your story, knight Mathias, fortresses look like the fortress of the ancient Gauls, who in many captured even the great Julius Caesar in the era preceding the Nativity Of Christ.\n\nKnight Mathias. I don't have such a profound knowledge of history of fortresses, your Excellency, but I believe that this is so is. To me this is even more amazed, because in Russia I came after Palestine, which is already built more than a hundred stone fortresses, and about the same built. And what is the fortress!\n\nCommander Henry. Yes, you can recall at least fortifications of Acre, which consist of a system of double walls converging the right angle, and components in terms of a rectangular triangle, the base of which is the sea. Each of the walls – a length of about a quarter of a mile (500 meters – approx. transl.), and has twelve powerful towers. At the intersection of Eastern and the inner North wall of the North-Eastern corner of the fortifications – is huge the round \"tower of Henry.\" In front of the city walls, deep trenches and ditches, covering the message of the city with the outside world by land, are still towers, surrounded by its own moat. All walls are equipped with interior corridors loopholes. And all this, of course, stone.\n\nKnight Mathias. And the Northern outskirts of Acre, Memzar, also double fortified stone wall with towers.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Honor and praise to our masters building so subtly even in Palestine – poor, desolate and uninhabited region, in constant wars with the Mohammedans.\n\nCount Wilhelm. While the Russian residential construction looks as savagely as fortresses?\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, your Excellency. In Russia almost all the houses are hidden behind high fences and the street is almost not visible, only from all sides are heard growling dogs chain. Bridge on the largest streets are not paved with stone as in our Empire, and wood. On the streets where no bridge, dirty, even in the summer, and what is happening there in spring and autumn you must can't even imagine.\n\nThe vast majority of houses and churches of wood. All buildings in the strongest way bloated due to the fact that almost all the huts have no chimney and are heated, as they say in Russia, \"black\": the smoke from the hearth escapes through small Windows under the roof.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And what is house?\n\nKnight Mathias. Small one-storey log house with a gable roof. If the house has two floors or more, it is usually called tower.\n\nCommander Henry. It turns out, apparently Kiev is still looks like the barbarian city.\n\nKnight Mathias. So, my brother, my master, although all Russian cities it produces the most pleasant impression.\n\nKiev is very large, I it seemed that he is almost a thousand acres (approximately400 hectares – approx. transl.). It is located in the middle of the steppes with small copses on high the right Bank of the Dnieper river, separated by many rivers on big hills. Median part of the city is located on the Old mountain up to a height of one hundred and twenty cubits (about80 meters – approx. transl.). Other hills are also settlements.\n\n- Building in Kiev built so that the city is split in two large fortresses, one so called \"the city of Vladimir the Baptist\" stone Desyatinnaya Church dedicated to the virgin Mary, the other \"the city of Yaroslav the Wise\" with the largest in Russia stone the Church of Hagia Sophia. Actually, I'm not a fan of the Byzantine shapes of buildings, but this temple is very large, the height from the ground forty cubits (29 meters – approx. transl.), and crowned with twenty five gilded domes located ledges. Such a pile of brightly shining domes impressive.\n\nBishop Tybalt. The temple dedicated to the Holy Martyr Sophia, mother of Faith, Hope and love, or Sophia – the Wisdom of God? In our The Holy Catholic Church, both of these cult not so honored to dedicate the largest city temples.\n\nKnight Mathias. The wisdom of God, your Eminence.\n\nCount Wilhelm. I guess the subtleties of Byzantine cults now isn't important to us. What's more, knight Mathias, you can tell us about Kiev?\n\nKnight Mathias. Strengthening Kiev, as elsewhere in Russia, consist of ramparts and wooden walls. The height of the trees on the plain reaches seven cubits (5 meters – approx. transl.), above the cliffs shaft is much lower, sometimes none at all. In the city of Yaroslav are stone Golden gate, which I already mentioned. The rest wooden gate. Around Kiev in many monasteries, fortified with ramparts and Palisades, some even with walls and large stone temples.\n\nAt the bottom of Dnipro is the so-called Hem, reinforced only by a palisade. If in the upper town lives, mainly the aristocracy and rich merchants, the hem of artisans and poor merchants. There are also the Kyiv trade and monastery of merchants from different countries. There is even a small wooden Catholic Church. In General Kiev the buildings, as in other Russian cities, almost entirely of wood, although there are stone towers.\n\nBishop Tybalt. You said – \"the stone towers\", \"stone temples\". So, in Russia stone already built and in Kiev?\n\nKnight Mathias. I'm sorry, your lordship, I it is said that the word \"stone\" in Russia is a generalization: construction of hewn natural stone was carried out only in the Galician Principality and prepared in Suzdal, and in all other Russian lands, including in Kiev, plinth is used, sometimes in combination with small boulders or fieldstone.\n\nCount Wilhelm. How long are you, knight Mathias, stayed in Kiev?\n\nKnight Mathias. Then, in the forty-fifth year – about two months since we Savva Nazirovich left of the Empire in the autumn, our way to Kiev took more than a month, on the rivers was about to begin ice on the road came the thaw, and we had to wait this time in Kiev.\n\nBishop Tybalt. What is the ice and slush?\n\nKnight Mathias. The freeze-up in Russia is called the time when swimming in the rivers becomes impossible due to the occurrence of ice, but this ice is not so strong to be able to take the sled and go winter road. Freezing happens early – in early November, sometimes late in the beginning December, and at that time no one on the Russian rivers don't go. At the same time takes place slush – when driving on land roads turns into things torment because of of the mud.\n\nSo we waited the freeze-up and thaw in Kiev and with the onset of cold moved on.\n\nCommander Henry. It was difficult used in the famous Russian cold, my brother?\n\nKnight Mathias. Not more difficult than to get hurt, alone, through the snowy mountain passes of Alamut in Baghdad. To the same Savva Nazirovich knew that I had never experienced such cold, and very worried about my health, even bought me winter clothes. It was important to take me safe and sound as a person that could help with the search deposits of stone, and sometimes I was amused that he treated me like pampered lad.\n\nHowever, the late Sava was much older than me, was nice to me and I was grateful for the imaginary salvation in Speyer, so that his concern was dictated not only by necessity, but good feelings.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Late?\n\nKnight Mathias. Unfortunately, Yes. I had to...\n\nBishop Tybalt. I'm sorry, son, I remembered that in the report you wrote about the unfortunate need to take the life of this architect. It really was such necessity?\n\nCount Wilhelm. In any case, it happened later many years. If I am not mistaken, a year ago. So let's not go that far forward. While we are talking about winter forty-fifth and forty – sixth years, when Sava was still alive and healthy.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Like many other honourable people who fell in Russia by hand valiant knight of Mathias.\n\nKnight Mathias. Your Excellency, I only fulfilled the duty of a knight of the Temple.\n\nCount Wilhelm. We are here just for also, knight Mathias, to determine whether you are in a particular case understood his duty, and what the consequences were performing their duty.\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, of course. Can I go to the story of the Suzdal Principality, or the high Council are interested in some more details my way?\n\nCommander Henry. In Suzdal you by Savva went on frozen rivers?\n\nKnight Mathias. No, my brother, my Lord. Even with the time of Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev to Suzdal leads permanent land road, it is a much shorter river path, and we drove by it on the sledge. Monomakh in specially paved this road to bypass the major cities to its it was more difficult to cut hostile Chernihiv princes, but still it is not to called safe as vyatichskoe in remote forests on the border of Ryazan and Suzdal in passing often attacked by robbers. They attacked and us.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And what is this forest – veticka?\n\nKnight Mathias. In these forests live Vyatichi – pagan tribes who owned these lands before the arrival of the South Russian the conquerors, led by Vladimir the Baptist.\n\nCommander Henry. And a lot of you was attacked by robbers?\n\nKnight Mathias. Little, seven people. But our sledge caravan was small, only five of the sleigh. However, there were eight of us – I, Savva, two masons and four Byzantine merchants, while in Suzdal land from Constantinople expensive clothes and jewelry. We all had axes, and the architect is also a sword. So we could just give thieves a worthy back. But when on the road in front of us fell a huge cut tree, and with all sides were heard the ominous whistle, my companions was frightened and fell down, begging for mercy.\n\nOf course, I could take from Savva of Nazirovich sword and immediately to deal with the robbers...\n\nBishop Tybalt. And you think you do you could win in open battle with swords seven robbers?\n\nKnight Mathias. I think that it would be no more difficult than to win a battle three assassins trained in Alamut.\n\nCommander Henry. The fact that the robbers are usually little to nothing about military Affairs. Most often it is the peasants or artisans, which unjust way pushed poverty or injustice superior.\n\nBishop Tybalt. I think, commander, that you partially justify robbers.\n\nCommander Henry. Your Eminence, understand and to justify different things. We, the Templars, we must understand what motivates each person, be it the robber or the legate his Holiness the Pope.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Once again you forget yourself, commander.\n\nCommander Henry. Sorry. I hope it Eminence already understood that should not pay attention to rude remarks heartless old fighters.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Commander, I'm older than you, and can to assure you that not less heartless. But the work of our Council requires sensitivity and shutter speed, which I all call. I have a question for knight Matthias: why Sawa or Byzantine merchants didn't hire at least three – five warriors to accompany? I think seeing armed men, thieves actually dared to attack.\n\nKnight Mathias. During the time that we had to spend in Kiev in anticipation of winter, Savva with his propensity for drunkenness was sderzhalsya so, that money was barely enough to hire the sleigh. And military support, the more at such a great distance, as from Kiev to Suzdal, is very expensive.\n\nCount Wilhelm. But you went and Byzantine merchants. They also didn't have the money?\n\nKnight Mathias. The money they had, your Excellency. Anyway, after the rescue, they gave me very generous. So I think that they just showed carelessness.\n\nAnd so it happened that no one but me unable to protect my companions from the robbers. But once to join with the wicked in battle, in any case, it was unreasonable, as it was necessary first understand, do not hide in the forest their associates, which could be Luke and arrows. I didn't want to show his fencing art on the front Sava Suzdal masters, so as not to cause issues, where a simple German Mason learned to fight with swords. So I decided to wait. And then I fell prostrate and begged for mercy with all.\n\nBishop Tybalt. But it was risky, my son. Suddenly they all you immediately killed?\n\nKnight Mathias. Usually, your Eminence, the robbers don't do that. They are either taken from the merchants product and let them go back home, or take them to the forest and tortured to see if they had another product, will pay anyone for a ransom, which the caravans going along this path, and stuff like that. Sometimes tortured just for fun.\n\nHowever, if merchants released, in the winter it also usually means death for them, because are selected not only goods, but also stripped almost naked, because the clothes are too valuable. And naked man to pass through the frost a few dozen miles from the nearest habitation, of course, impossible.\n\nSometimes, merchants lucky enough to stay alive and be sold in the slave markets, but that is, if they are captured by steppe nomads or sea and river thieves. The villains are also in the midst of Russian forest with the slave markets are not connected. So my companions, not wanting to fight, hope to survive not was no, and I could only wonder at their cowardice, passivity and short-sightedness.\n\nCount Wilhelm. And how did you manage to escape?\n\nKnight Mathias. The robbers took us into the forest. Bind us as we did not resist. Five villains were under the reins of the horse harnessed to our sledges, and two customized us. Had to get between the trees, the sled often clung to the branches and stopped outlaws started to release them, and curiously, my companions helpful help them, vainly hoping for leniency and mercy.\n\nWhen everything once again was busy with the release of the sled, didn't cost me anything to take a step to the side and hide behind a large tree. No one noticed my disappearance. After that I just had to miss the caravan by himself, to follow him and one by one to destroy thieves, starting with the one who led the last sled.\n\nBishop Tybalt. This technique without the shedding of blood? As he called, I forget...\n\nCommander Henry. \"Look back\".\n\nKnight Mathias. \"Look back\" I had to use one of those killed me robbers. After that I took the axe and sledge just cut their heads, one by one, crawling behind them. So four were killed, were the ones who went ahead with my companions, paving the way. I loudly asked them to surrender. The nearest of them rushed at me with a sword, but I easily dodged the blow and then killed the villain. My companions, inspired by my example and using numerical predominance, rushed to the robbers and disarmed.\n\nWeak and cowardly people usually can't suppress my desire to show off on the defeated enemy, therefore, at the insistence of the Byzantine merchants robbers were stripped naked brutally beaten, tied to trees and left in woods to die from the cold.\n\nBishop Tybalt. May the Lord have mercy on them wayward Christian souls.\n\nCommander Henry. Amen.\n\nCount Wilhelm. And in the end you arrived safely to Suzdal – the capital of George Dolgorukiy?\n\nKnight Mathias. Not exactly, your Excellency.\n\nCount Wilhelm. You have been on the road yet something deserving of the story for us?\n\nKnight Mathias. No, your Excellency, on the road no more adventures we had, I just wanted to clarify that about the city Suzdal is not quite true to say as the capital of Dolgorukiy. Capital in understanding, for example, Constantinople in Byzantium, Paris in France, St. city in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Kiev Rus, in Suzdal,no, it is in this sense more similar to our Holy Roman Empire, where Rome and Aachen are symbolic capitals, and his Imperial Majesty prefers to stay in Regensburg.\n\nThe ancient city Suzdal – Suzdal and Rostov. At the beginning of his Suzdal reign, and reigned there George almost from the beginning of this century, Dolgoruky lived primarily in Rostov. But then he built the princely courts in the Suzdal, in the village of Kideksha near Suzdal, and Vladimir. Vladimir courtyard he preferred the last years of his reign.\n\nBy the way, frequent moves George had created many difficulties for the princely officials, who also had to up to his master. Savva Nazirovich, for example, told me that he was not at home, in Rostov, for a few years: had it to be Dolgoruky in Vladimir, to ride with him in the Principality.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Your Excellency, may be the story of the knight Matthias about staying in Suzdal Principality better to wait until tomorrow, when we're less tired and more attentive?\n\nCount Wilhelm. I agree with your Eminence. Let's take a break until tomorrow.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Lord, we, the unworthy, grateful for Your great blessings to us. We praise You, we bless, thank you, much praised and magnified Thy goodness, and with devotion and love You shout: Benefactor, our Saviour, glory to You!\n\nAll participants meeting. Amen.\n\nCount Wilhelm. The meeting was closed. Thank you all members.\n\nPROTOCOL THE SECOND MEETING OF THE\n\nof the Council of representatives of his Imperial Majesty, his Holiness the Pope and the order of the poor knights of Christ and Of the temple of Solomon on consideration of the report of the knight of Matias of Passau on the implementation of the mission in Russia in 1145-1157 years from BC\n\n(Room on the inventory of the Vienna library: XII-21-8357/P-II)\n\nIn the name of God, the will of his Imperial Majesty Friedrich, his Holiness Pope Hadrian and the Grand master the order of the poor knights of the Temple, Bertrand de Plansfor held this meeting under strict secretly in the Imperial Abbey of St. Emmeram in Regensburg in the seventeenth day of July 1157 from BC\n\nPresent:\n\nChairman of the Board – count Wilhelm von Veldhoven, Vice-Marshal of the court of his Imperial Majesty.\n\nMember of the Board – Bishop Tybalt Surminski, the legate his Holiness the Pope.\n\nCouncil member knight Henry from Angouleme, commander of the military brotherhood of Gaza, and Ascalon of the order of the poor knights Of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon.\n\nThe Secretary of the Board Alfred from Bamberg, a monk of the Imperial Abbey of St. Emmeram in Regensburg.\n\nThe Council reports knight Matias from Passau, a member of the military brotherhood of Gaza, and Ascalon the order of the poor knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon.\n\nCount Wilhelm. In the name of God, continue the hearing of the report of the knight Mathias, a member of the military brotherhood of Gaza, and Ascalon the order of the poor knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Lord, I ask that You grant me peace, wisdom and strength. Let me watch the world through the eyes of love, to be patient, benevolent, gentle. Protect my hearing from all slander, my tongue – from all condemnation. Be in my heart only good thoughts. Put me in Your beauty, Lord, so I radiate Your light and Your love.\n\nAll participants meeting. Amen.\n\nCount Wilhelm. I ask the distinguished members of the Council to sit down. At the last meeting, knight Mathias, you stopped on that safely profit in Zalesie together with the architect Savva.\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, your Excellency. When we Savva came Dolgoruky was in Vladimir, and we immediately went there.\n\nCount Wilhelm. And what a city Vladimir? It, as the name implies, was founded by Vladimir Monomakh?\n\nKnight Mathias. About its base are different gossip: whether Monomakh, or even Vladimir the Baptist. Even the name is unclear: perhaps in honor of one of these princes, but it is possible – and in honor of the great the southern Russian city of Vladimir, the capital of Volhynia. In Suzdal earth in General are very common southern Russian names – Zvenigorod, Przemysl, Gorodets, Starodub, Mikulin, when I was laid Pereyaslavl Zaleski (now Pereslavl-Zalessky – approx. transl.) and Georgiev Opole (now Yuriev-Polish – approx. transl.). Apparently, the Russian princes, who built the city in Zalesie, lacked imagination for inventing new titles. Even some of the local river received the southern Russian names. I remember the Trubezh and Lybed Rpen. The last two rivers, by the way, flow just Vladimir.\n\nAround Vladimir located fertile plains, and the city is on the mountain height, probably, sixty cubits (40 meters – approx. transl.), between the deep ravines and rivers Klyazma and Lybed Cenu. It turned out that strong fortifications nature itself, and the rulers used the benefits of the location, erecting over the slopes is low, two or three cubits tall (1.5–2 meters – approx. transl.), ramparts and walls on them.\n\nBut the benefits of its location at the mountain between the rivers and ravines created and inconvenience. The size of the city is quite large, the length of fortifications is more than a mile (2500 meters – approx. transl.), but he is cramped within the old borders, and extensive Posad, and extending East and West along the Klyazma, was separated from fortress and unprotected. Torg, located at the bottom of the river, is also not protected.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Posad? What's that?\n\nKnight Mathias. I'm sorry, your Eminence, I forgot to explain that the Posad in Russia, called the urban development outside the fortress.\n\nTwo gates in hardwood the towers lead into the city from the West and the East. Deaf turrets in Vladimir no, as in all I have seen Russian fortresses. Between the Western and the Eastern gate is the main street, paved with wood.\n\nWooden churches in Vladimir slightly less than in Kiev, but the stone temple when I go there for the first time arrived, there was only one. This temple is dedicated to the Transfiguration of our Lord Jesus Christ and built by Vladimir Monomakh in the Byzantine technique – time.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Interestingly, while the main tower is in Russian fortresses?\n\nKnight Mathias. No, your Excellency. Architect Savva Nazirovich told me that at the end of the last century Vladimir Monomakh built a full main tower in the castle ljubech on the Dnieper river near Of Kiev, but this case remained the only Russian fortress construction.\n\nIn the fortresses in Russia the main towers in the siege clad in stone temples, if any. With the threat the attack of the enemy under their drums (here and hereinafter are modern architectural terms – approx. transl.) even arranged wooden decks, so they could shoot the archers.\n\nCommander Henry. But the temples strengthen weak and unreliable, and no serious assault, no Church not stand: the besiegers, it is easy to sum up the battering RAM and knock the door, or to impose the building of brushwood and to strangle defenders smoke.\n\nCount Wilhelm. But a certain reason to use temples as the main towers still there, and not coincidentally, many such examples in my native Germany: just remember the fortress Church in the See of Abbey.\n\nBishop Tybalt. And in Sirmione on lake Garda, the main city of my diocese, too, there is a Church embedded in the fortifications.\n\nCount Wilhelm. In any case, if the enemy already were able to overcome the main town fortifications and capture the city, taking even the strong main tower is just a matter of a relatively short time. But at least a symbolic main tower of the fortress is still needed, because during the capture the enemy city walls, the military commander must be able to lock in any strengthening and, while the enemy is preparing for his assault, to arrange honorable surrender. And even the weakest of the main tower is a noble class enough protection during the uprising of the citizens.\n\nCommander Henry. Yes, your Excellency, I agree with you.\n\nCount William. Me by the way, always was interested in this. I heard that the Apostolic rules and definitions The Ecumenical councils forbid the monks and clergy to participate in military actions with weapons in their hands. But it happens very often, that example – if present here the knights of the monastic order of Christ and of the Temple Solomon. Same thing with using the churches as the main towers. Isn't there contradictions?\n\nBishop Tybalt – a profound expert on the sacred texts, maybe he will explain it to us?\n\nBishop Tybalt. There is no contradiction, your Excellency. Eighty-third Apostolic rule says: \"the Priest, exercising in the military and wants to keep both, that is, the Roman the authorities and the priestly office, let him be deposed from the sacred rank. Because Caesar what is Caesar, and God of gods\".\n\nAnd the definition of the Fourth Ecumenical Council States: \"Clerics and monks determined not to join any military service, nor in worldly rank, and dared to this, and not returning with repentance to that first chose for God anathema\".\n\nAs you can see, both cases we are talking only about the ban for the monks and priests to combine the service of God with service in the armed forces of the earthly rulers or any other secular service.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Your theological knowledge truly limitless, your Eminence. Thank you. And about the strengthening of Russian cities I would say very unflattering: what are strongholds, these are the main tower.\n\nKnight Mathias. But fortresses from George was a lot, and the Prince built them, subjecting a single system: the distance between them should exceed two days, to catch up to the enemy, if he set out the fortress to get around. This system includes the Vladimir, Tver, Moscow, Ksnyatin, Dubna, Zvenigorod, Przemysl, Mikulin, Sochi, Starodub, Gorodets and mnonmany of the city, enumerating the names of which I do not want to bore the high Council. During my stay in Russia Dolgoruky built three: Pereslavl Zalessky, Georgiev Opole and Dmitrov. Have some of the fortresses of the Prince renewed strengthening.\n\nI must say that I don't unable not to admire the activity of George Dolgorukiy, which transformed the hitherto unsettled pagan Suzdal region in a prosperous land, in which dominates the Christian Church, even if not the papal and Byzantine. And as I heard in the beginning of his reign on the squares of Rostov and Suzdal stood the idols.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Yes, a worthy ruler, nothing say. Continue, knight Mathias, your story about the arrival in Vladimir.\n\nKnight Mathias. In Vladimir we arrived in the eve The Baptism Of The Lord. From Savva of Nazirovich in this city was a big house, and he put me in one of the side rooms. The house was built, and a, we are happy to warm up immediately after arrival, and then soared almost on a weekly basis. Russians really love baths.\n\nCount Wilhelm. What do you mean \"steam\"? To sit in the warm and moist a couple, as in the Palestinian baths? Forgot what they are called...\n\nKnight Mathias. They are called hammams, your Excellency. But the Russian method of washing in a bath is very different and hammams, and our hot tubs. In the Russian baths the air is very hot and the hearth are large hot stones, abundantly watered, and this is a strong vapor. So in Russia, say – \"steam bath\". And in the Russian baths taken smacking each other with bundles of thin rods, and in winter is to pop up a steamed the cold and jump in the snow.\n\nCount Wilhelm. And why was that?\n\nKnight Mathias. I think to strengthen the body and spirit.\n\nBishop Tybalt. Strange way.\n\nCount Wilhelm. I, however, think interesting. Somehow try to arrange a Russian bath in his castle Veldhoven. My friend, Duke von Oldenburg, have made something similar and highly praised.\n\nCommander Henry. Since we are talking about baths, ask a question. My brother Matthias, shortly before the trip to Russia you were serious wounded in battle with the assassins, and you certainly left a big scar...\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, on the left shoulder.\n\nCommander Henry. You've been hurt before. How much received in battle scars you had when you came to Russia?\n\nKnight Mathias. God spared me: compared to the many of our other brothers of the scars I have are few, only six. Later in Russia I got another one, now there are seven.\n\nCommander Henry. Yes, it's a bit: I eleven.\n\nBishop Tybalt. It's valiant of knights is considered a little?\n\nCount Wilhelm. A little, your Eminence. I different times received fourteen wounds.\n\nBishop Tybalt. God, how cruel this world...\n\nCount Wilhelm. Another world Lord we don't provided, have to live in it. Commander Henry, your question knight Matthias consisted only in the number of scars?\n\nCommander Henry. Not only that, your Excellency. My brother Mathias, what do you think: when Sawa saw your scars, one of which, obtained under Alamut, was very fresh, not have arisen if he had suspicion, you're not who you say you are? For the knight you have scars, really not very much, but for the average Mason too much.\n\nKnight Mathias. When Savva Nazirovich in the bath noticed my scars, he asked me where they came from. I answered him the same way answered and his father, who asked me the same questions: supposedly, when I worked construction in Edessa, the city was besieged by the infidels, I had to fight on the walls, I was severely wounded, captured and survived by a miracle. My father, and Russian architect not so well versed in military and medical, to understand that all my wounds were obtained at different times, and directly to them I never: would've died from the first three.\n\nCommander Henry. And your circumcision Savva noticed?\n\nKnight Mathias. Unlikely. He could know what it is. However, in this case I was ready to tell you that in prisoner was forced to accept Islam, and after fleeing the sin of apostasy was I released my Confessor as forced.\n\nCount Wilhelm. Knight Mathias, who else in Russia could see your scars and circumcision? With whom you have soared in a bath?\n\nKnight Mathias. Yes, perhaps, no one but The Petryliv Of Maravich.\n\nCount Wilhelm. I wonder, I wonder. Tell us about him, please.\n\nKnight Mathias. Petrila, or just Peter, – attracted me to work for the good of the Holy Catholic Church and baptized me in the true Catholic faith by a senior official of George Dolgorukiy. I Petrillo mentioned in the report written by me.\n\nCount Wilhelm. The report we read, but we ask you elaborate Petrila.\n\nKnight Mathias. Listen to and obey, your Excellency.\n\nPetrila Maravich – almost my age, a year younger than me. It comes from a pagan tribe under the name \"ves\", living around the North of the Russian cities – Beloozero (located in the modern district of Belozersk – approx. transl.). At birth, Peter had been given the name of Anelim. His father, MERT was the ruler a small town nestled in the woods in a few days from Beloozero.\n\nAround Beloozero lives only the whole, but Meria – also pagan tribes, pastoralists and agriculture. These tribes are much more powerful and numerous, lots of Mary and around Suzdal, Rostov and around. When from the South came the Russian invaders, they gradually subjugated and baptized in the Byzantine faith and meyrueis, and the whole, and Vyatichi, about which I have already described. But the tribe from which came Anelim, remained pagan in Beloozero Russian was still very small, and they out in the surrounding forest only to collect tribute.\n\nYears seven or eight up to my arrival in Suzdal town, where rules father Anelma was ruined one of the Merya tribes. The ruler of the dead were killed in battle, the population was slaughtered or enslaved. Anela managed to escape, he wandered for a long time through forests and barely alive, came even to the Beloozero and Rostov, because the path to Beloozero were blocked by his enemies.\n\nPrince George Dolgoruky, who lived then in Rostov, graciously accepted Anelma, acknowledged his noble origin, invited him to be baptized, himself became his godfather and granted a title of nobility: so here are usually did the leaders voluntarily conquer the pagan tribes. At the baptism of Anelim received the name Peter, in Russia it was called Petroleu. Some Russian when you leave the pagan baptism names, especially doing so the princes: for example, Yaroslav the Wise got the Christian name of George, Vladimir Monomakh – Basil, Izyaslav Mstislavich –Panteleimon, but still they are all called pagan. Petrila is not only was called by Christian name, but did not like when he was reminded that he was once Angelmom.\n\nFather Petro, despite that was a pagan, gave his son a good education, so Petrila was immediately also employed in the princely Treasury.\n\nCommander Henry. My brother Matthias, what you now told about the origin of the Petryliv, you only learned from him, or you had other sources of information? Or maybe you've been under Beloozero among there the Gentiles?\n\nKnight Mathias. My brother, my Lord, I know that shall carefully check each of whom are attracted to work on good of the Holy Catholic Church. But to go to Beloozero and check that told Petrila, there was no way, as only the path to that the city takes several weeks, it is very far to the North. Distance from Vladimir beloozerov slightly less than to Kiev, and thus no a direct land route to Beloozero no, you long to sail on the rivers. To the same town where rules father of Peter, no longer existed, and look for itthe remains in the surrounding woods of course, I could not.\n\nSo I just had for those that asked about Petrila Savva Nazirovich. The architect told me about the same thing at different times told Peter.\n\nI also knew that Wisata Nikiforovich, the Supreme Governor of Yuri Dolgoruky, who was in charge at court and search cases, checked all people taken to court. And since Petrila occupied a high position in the Treasury and was a gentleman, I decided that this is enough to read his stories about himself tested.\n\nCommander Henry. Well, my brother, here to you unlikely to be claims. And what kind of position at that time held Peter?\n\nKnight Mathias. He was one of the assistants the Prince's Treasurer and was in charge of collecting one of the types of taxes in Suzdal Principality.\n\nCount Wilhelm. In Russia the position of tax collector is called the word \"osmanic\" or \"volmink\"? Am I pronouncing that correctly?\n\nKnight Mathias. Your knowledge is deep, your lordship, and you pronounce these words correctly. Even their name is mytniki or publicans, but Osmaniye often.\n\nCount Wilhelm. In addition, you, knight Mathias, drew Osmania Petrilo to work for the good of the Holy Catholic Church, you and he were friends?\n\nKnight Mathias. You could say that, your Excellency.\n\nCount Wilhelm. And what exactly was your friendship?\n\nKnight Mathias. In the ordinary understanding of friendship. I stayed at his house, we went together to the feasts, have soared in the bath...\n\nBishop Tybalt.
