        "text": "Situation of Poland during the 1080s\n\nIn 1086 the coronation of Vratislav II as King of Bohemia, and his alignment with Laszlo I, King of Hungary, threatened the position of the Polish ruler, Prince Wladyslaw I Herman. Therefore, that same year Wladyslaw I was forced to recall from Hungarian banishment the only son of Boleslaw II the Bold and a rightful heir to the Polish throne, Mieszko Boleslawowic. Upon his return young Boleslawowic accepted the over-lordship of his uncle and gave up his hereditary claim to the crown of Poland in exchange for becoming first in line to succeed him. In return, Wladyslaw I Herman granted his nephew the district of Krakow. The situation was further complicated for Wladyslaw I Herman by a lack of a legitimate male heir, as his first-born son Zbigniew came from a union not recognized by the church. With the return of Mieszko Boleslawowic to Poland, Wladyslaw I normalized his relations with the kingdom of Hungary as well as Kievan Rus (the marriage of Mieszko Boleslawowic to a Kievan princess was arranged in 1088). These actions allowed Herman to strengthen his authority and alleviate further tensions in international affairs.\n\nBirth of Boleslaw. Name and nickname\n\nThe lack of a legitimate heir, however, remained a concern for Wladyslaw I and in 1085 he and his wife Judith of Bohemia sent rich gifts, among which was a life size statue of a child made of gold, to the Benedictine Sanctuary of Saint Giles in Saint-Gilles, Provence begging for offspring. The Polish envoys were led by the personal chaplain of Duchess Judith, Piotr.\n\nThe date of birth of Boleslaw is closely linked with the death of his mother Judith. This fact is evidenced by contemporary sources:\n\nGallus Anonymus in the Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum reported that Duchess Judith gave birth to Boleslaw on the day of King Saint Stephen of Hungary (whose feast since the 11th century was celebrated on 20 August). However, the Duchess' health never recovered from childbirth and died on the night of Nativity (i.e. 24–25 December). Gallus didn't put in his chronicle any date year.\n\nCosmas of Prague wrote in Latin in his Chronica Boemorum (\"Chronicle of Bohemians\") that Boleslaw was born three days before the death of Judith, who died in VIII Calends of January (25 December) of the year 1085.\n\nThe Kalendarz krakowski said that Duchess Judith died on 24 December 1086, and only indicated that the birth of Boleslaw was in the same year.\n\nThe Obituary of the Abbey of Saint-Gilles reported the death of Judith on 24 December 1086.\n\nThe Rocznik kapituly krakowskiej (closely related to the Kalendarz krakowski) placed the death of Judith on 24 December 1086.\n\nHistorian August Bielowski established Boleslaw's birth on 26 December 1085 and the death of his mother two days later, on 28 December. According to him Gallus Anonymus committed two errors. First, instead of the Sunday after the Nativity of the Lord wrote incorrectly in the Sunday of the Nativity. Secondly, he mistaken the day of Saint Stephen (26 December) with the festivities of King Stephen of Hungary (20 August). Both corrections lead to the birth date of Boleslaw on 26 December. This theory was supported by the fact that in 1085 28 December fell on a Sunday.\n\nOswald Balzer refuted Bielowski's theory and pointed that Judith's death was on the night between 24–25 December 1086, and the birth of Boleslaw was four months before, on 20 August. According to him, if Judith died on the night between 24–24 December, are possible discrepancies in determining the exact date of the event. All known sources who placed the death of Judith, would then right. Gallus wrote that Judith died shortly after giving birth to a son. Later sources interpret this as a death in childbirth and Cosmas of Prague followed this fact, despite he didn't received the information at first hand. Hence, his mistake would result in this point. In contrast, the right -indicated by Gallus- date of birth of Boleslaw would be 20 August. In the medieval tradition the year began on 25 December. In that case, the reports of Cosmas must be concluded that Boleslaw was born yet in 1085. This information, however, was in contradiction with the reports of the Kalendarz krakowski, who gave the year 1086. Judith was styled by the authors of the Kalendarz as \"regina Polonia\" (Queen of Poland in Latin), and this title could be associated with her father's coronation as King of Bohemia and Poland on 15 June 1086 (according to Cosmas). Karol Maleczynski refuted the arguments of Balzer, who accepted the date of the coronation of Vratislav II given by Cosmas. However, most researchers indicates that the coronation took place on 15 June 1085, so Judith could be called Queen a year earlier.\n\nKarol Maleczynski determined that the death of Judith took place on the night between 24–25 December 1085, and Boleslaw was born four months before, on 20 August. Researchers found that the date given by the Rocznik kapituly krakowskiej (24 December 1086) was the same established by Cosmas (25 December 1085). The difference in the year could be explained in the different of style dating followed by Cosmas, who began the year according to the Julian calendar on 1 January and Christmas (Nativitate in Latin) on 25 December. For Maleczynski, Kazimierz Jasinski not consider this calendar difference who occurs only during the period 25–31 December.\n\nArchaeologist Wojciech Szafranski reasumed the theory of Bielowski: Judith of Bohemia died on 28 December 1085, and Boleslaw was born two days before, on 26 December. According to Szafranski Cosmas used the term VIII Calends of January, with no specific date. However, in the Chronicle of Gallus should read that Judith died on Christmas Day, but on Sunday in the Octave of Christmas. Using such a broadened range of days, the investigator determined the birth of Boleslaw in the feast of Saint Stephen (26 December). For this reasons, the date of 1085 given by Bielowski is correct according to him. However, Jasinski pointed the weaknesses of the argument of Szafranski because Gallus has written about the Octave, but specifically about Christmas night, but the investigator didn't consider all other sources, as well as the achievements of research in genealogy.\n\nMarian Plezia argued that Boleslaw was born on 2 September 1085 or 1086. According to Gallus, the day of King Stephen of Hungary was also celebrated on 2 September. Jasinski considered this theory unfounded. In Poland the feast of King Stephen of Hungary is pointed by the Kalendarz krakowski and the kalendarz Kodeksu Gertrudy on 20 August. Besides, if Boleslaw was born on 2 September, Gallus probably would be noted that this was the day after the celebration of Saint Giles (1 September), which was attributed to be the intercessor of his birth.\n\nKazimierz Jasinski placed the death of Judith in the night between 24–25 December 1086 and the birth of Boleslaw four months before, on 20 August. In this point he agrees with the findings of Balzer. He supported his views with additional arguments: All sources are based in the missing Rocznika kapituly krakowskiej, and the next known text of this source refers to events in the year 1086. Cosmas, writing his chronicle a few decades later, probably benefited from oral tradition and could make a mistake when he placed the year. His reports who placed the birth of Boleslaw three days before the death of his mother denoted a quite short time.\n\nToday is widely recognized the view of both Jasinski and Balzer, that Boleslaw most likely was born in the day of King Stephen of Hungary, 20 August 1086.\n\nAccording to Cosmas of Prague, Boleslaw was named after his uncle, Boleslaw II the Generous. Wladyslaw I Herman had no reason to named his first-born legitimate son after his brother, but probably in this way tried to placate the former allies of his predecessor.\n\nBoleslaw's nickname \"Wrymouth\" (pl: Krzywousty) appeared in Polish and Latin sources of the 13th century: Genealogii plockiej (Criwousti) and the Roczniku swietokrzyskim mlodszym (Crzyvousti). Probably the origin of this nickname dates back on the 12th century and is relationed with some physical characteristics of the Polish ruler, who were noticed at the time of his reign. Probably he began to be named in this way after 1114, because Gallus Anonymus in his Chronicle never mentioned it. In the Kronice ksiazat polskich and Kronice polsko-slaskiej Boleslaw was qualified by the Latin adjective curvus, whose significance remains unclear. According to the 14th century Kroniki o Piotrze Wlostowicu the Prince was hunchbacked (Latin: gibbosus) or had a crooked mouth. The 15th century chronicler Jan Dlugosz wrote:\n\nIn 1974, in the Masovian Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral of Plock, where according to tradition Boleslaw was buried, an archaeological research project was conducted. A coffin was discovered containing the bones of 16 men and women. One of the skulls, of a man who died aged 50, had a deformed mandible. There is a hypothesis that these remains belonged to Boleslaw. Opponents of this theory suggest that the Prince was named in this way many years after his death, and his contemporary Gallus did not mention any physical defect in the hero of his Chronicles. The defenders of the hypothesis argue that the work of Gallus has the characteristics of a panegyric in honor of Boleslaw, because the chronicler did not mention his physical infirmities. It is also speculated that the bone damage occurred as a result of childbirth complications, which led to the death of his mother a few months later.\n\nThe nickname of Boleslaw was also explained in other ways. According to a legend, Boleslaw slammed his face against a wall after watching his father's subservience towards the Germans and Czechs. According to Jan Dlugosz, the Prince in his youth suffered from an ulcer, which caused the deformity of his face. According to older historiography, he received the nickname Wrymouth for his perjury.\n\nEarly Years\n\nFollowing Boleslaw’s birth the political climate in the country changed. The position of Boleslaw as an heir to the throne was threatened by the presence of Mieszko Boleslawowic, who was already seventeen at the time and was furthermore, by agreement with Wladyslaw I Herman himself, the first in line to succeed. In all likelihood it was this situation that precipitated the young prince Mieszko’s demise in 1089. In that same year Wladyslaw I Herman’s first-born son Zbigniew was sent to a monastery in Quedlinburg, Saxony. This suggests that Wladyslaw I Herman intended to be rid of Zbigniew by making him a monk, and therefore depriving him of any chance of succession. This eliminated two pretenders to the Polish throne, secured young Boleslaw’s inheritance as well as diminished the growing opposition to Wladyslaw I Herman among the nobility. Shortly after his ascension, however, Wladyslaw I Herman was forced by the barons to give up the de facto reins of government to Count Palatine Sieciech. This turn of events was likely due to the fact that Herman owed the throne to the barons, the most powerful of whom was Sieciech.\n\nAround this time Wladyslaw I Herman married again. The chosen bride was Judith-Maria, daughter of Emperor Henry III and widow of King Solomon of Hungary, who after her wedding took the name Sophia in order to distinguish herself from Wladyslaw I Herman's first wife. Through this marriage Boleslaw gained three or four half-sisters, and as a consequence he remained the only legitimate son and heir. It's believed that the new Duchess was actively aiding Sieciech in his schemes to take over the country and that she became his mistress.\n\nPosition of Sieciech in Poland\n\nIn 1090 Polish forces under Sieciech's command, managed to gain control of Gdansk Pomerania, albeit for a short time. Major towns were garrisoned by Polish troops, and the rest were burned in order to thwart future resistance. Several months later, however, a rebellion of native elites led to the restoration of the region’s independence from Poland. The following year a punitive expedition was organized, in order to recover Gdansk Pomerania. The campaign was decided at the battle of the Wda River, where the Polish knights suffered a defeat despite the assistance of Bohemian troops.\n\nPrince Boleslaw’s childhood happened at a time when a massive political migration out of Poland was taking place, due to Sieciech’s political repressions. Most of the elites who became political refugees found safe haven in Bohemia. Another consequence of Sieciech’s political persecution was the kidnapping of Zbigniew by Sieciech’s enemies and his return from abroad in 1093. Zbigniew took refuge in Silesia, a stronghold of negative sentiment for both Sieciech as well as his nominal patron Wladyslaw I Herman. In the absence of Sieciech and Boleslaw, who were captured by Hungarians and kept captive, Prince Wladyslaw I then undertook a penal expedition to Silesia, which was unsuccessful and subsequently obliged him to recognize Zbigniew as a legitimate heir. In 1093 Wladyslaw I signed an Act of Legitimization which granted Zbigniew the rights of descent from his line. Zbigniew was also granted the right to succeed to the throne. Following Sieciech and Boleslaw’s escape from Hungary, an expedition against Zbigniew was mounted by the Count Palatine. Its aim was to nullify the Act of Legitimization. The contestants met at the battle of Goplo in 1096, where Sieciech’s forces annihilated the supporters of Zbigniew. Zbigniew himself was taken prisoner, but regained his freedom a year later, in May 1097, due to the intervention of the bishops. At the same time his rights, guaranteed by the Act of Legitimization, were reinstated.\n\nSimultaneously a great migration of Jews from Western Europe to Poland began circa 1096, around the time of the First Crusade. The tolerant rule of Wladyslaw I Herman attracted the Jews who were permitted to settle throughout the entire kingdom without restrictions. The Polish prince, took great care of the Hebrew Diaspora, as he understood its positive influence on the growth of the country’s economy. The new Jewish citizens soon gained trust of the gentiles during the rule of Boleslaw III.\n\nDivision of the country\n\nIn view of his father’s disapproval, and after discovering the plans of Sieciech and Duchess Judith-Sophia to take over the country Zbigniew gained an ally in the young prince Boleslaw. Both brothers demanded that the reins of government should be handed over to them. It is difficult to believe, however, that Boleslaw was making independent decisions at this point as he was only 12 years of age. It is postulated that at this stage he was merely a pawn of the Baron’s power struggle. Wladyslaw I Herman, however, agreed to divide the realm between the brothers, each to be granted his own province while the Prince – Wladyslaw I himself – kept control of Mazovia and its capital at Plock. Wladyslaw also retained control of the most important cities i.e. Wroclaw, Krakow and Sandomierz. Zbigniew’s province encompassed Greater Poland including Gniezno, Kuyavia, Leczyca Land and Sieradz Land. Boleslaw’s territory included Lesser Poland, Silesia and Lubusz Land.\n\nThe division of the country and the allowance of Boleslaw and Zbigniew to co-rule greatly alarmed Sieciech, who then began preparing to dispose of the brothers altogether. Sieciech understood that the division of the country would undermine his position. He initiated a military settlement of the issue and he gained the Prince’s support for it. The position of Wladyslaw I is seen as ambiguous as he chose to support Sieciech’s cause instead of his sons'.\n\nFight against Sieciech\n\nIn response to Sieciech’s preparations Boleslaw and Zbigniew entered into an alliance. This took place at a popular assembly or Wiec organized in Wroclaw by a magnate named Skarbimir of the Awdaniec family. There it was decided to remove the current guardian of Boleslaw, a noble named Wojslaw who was a relative of Sieciech, and arrange for an expedition against the Palatine. Subsequently, in 1099, the armies of Count Palatine and Prince Herman encountered the forces of Zbigniew and Boleslaw near Zarnowiec by the river Pilica. There the forces of Boleslaw and Zbigniew defeated Sieciech's army, and Wladyslaw I Herman was obliged to permanently remove Sieciech from the position of Count Palatine. In the same year, at Christmas, Boleslaw concluded to short-lived peace with Bohemia. The agreement was concluded in Zatec. According to Cosmas, Boleslaw was appointed Miecznik (en: Sword-bearer) of his uncle Bretislaus II, Duke of Bohemia. In addition, the young prince would be paid the amount of 100 pieces of fine silver and 10 talents of gold annually as a tribute to Bohemia (it was about the land of Silesia, for which he paid tribute to Wladyslaw I).\n\nThe rebel forces were then further directed towards Sieciechow, where the Palatine took refuge. Unexpectedly, Prince Wladyslaw came to the aid of his besieged favorite with a small force. At this point, the Princes decided to depose their father. The opposition sent Zbigniew with an armed contingent to Masovia, where he was to take control of Plock, while Boleslaw was directed to the South. The intention was the encirclement of their father, Prince Wladyslaw I. The Prince predicted this maneuver and sent his forces back to Masovia. In the environs of Plock the battle was finally joined and the forces of Wladyslaw I were defeated. The Prince was thereafter forced to exile Sieciech from the country. The Palatine left Poland around 1100/1101. He was known to sojourn in the German lands. However, he eventually returned to Poland but did not play any political role again. He may have been blinded.\n\nStruggle for the supremacy (1102–1106)\n\nWladyslaw I Herman died on 4 June 1102. The country was divided into two provinces, each administered by one of the late prince’s sons. The extent of each province closely resembled the provinces that the princes were granted by their father three years earlier, the only difference being that Zbigniew also controlled Mazovia with its capital at Plock, effectively ruling the northern part of the kingdom, while his younger half-brother Boleslaw ruled its southern portion. In this way two virtually separate states were created. According to some historians, Zbigniew tried to play the role of princeps or overlord, because at that time Boleslaw was only 16 years old. Because he was still too inexperienced to independently direct his domains, the local nobility gathered around him took great influence in the political affairs, included his teacher, Skarbimir from the Awdaniec family.\n\nThey conducted separate policies internally as well as externally. They each sought alliances, and sometimes they were enemies of one another. Such was the case with Pomerania, towards which Boleslaw aimed his ambitions. Zbigniew, whose country bordered Pomerania, wished to maintain good relations with his northern neighbor. Boleslaw, eager to expand his dominion, organized several raids into Pomerania and Prussia. In Autumn of 1102 Boleslaw organized a war party into Pomerania during which his forces sacked Bialogard.\n\nAs reprisal the Pomeranians sent retaliatory war parties into Polish territory, but as Pomerania bordered Zbigniew’s territory these raids ravaged the lands of the prince who was not at fault. Therefore, in order to put pressure on Boleslaw, Zbigniew allied himself with Borivoj II of Bohemia, to whom he promised to pay tribute in return for his help. By aligning himself with Boleslaw’s southern neighbor Zbigniew wished to compel Boleslaw to cease his raids into Pomerania. Boleslaw, on the other hand, allied himself with Kievan Rus and Hungary. His marriage to Zbyslava, the daughter of Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich in 1103, was to seal the alliance between himself and the prince of Kiev. However, Boleslaw's first diplomatic move was to recognize Pope Paschal II, which put him in strong opposition to the Holy Roman Empire. A later visit of papal legate Gwalo, Bishop of Beauvais brought the church matters into order, it also increased Boleslaw's influence.\n\nZbigniew declined to attend the marriage of Boleslaw and Zbyslava. He saw this union and the alliance with Kiev as a serious threat. Thanks to bribery, he therefore prevailed upon his ally, Borivoj II of Bohemia to invade Boleslaw’s province, ostensibly to claim the Polish crown. Boleslaw retaliated with expeditions into Moravia in 1104–1105, which brought the young prince not only loot, but also effectively disintegrated the alliance of Pomeranians and Zbigniew. During the return of the army, one part commanded by Zelislaw were defeated by the Bohemians. Boleslaw, who commanded the other part of the army, couldn't defeated them. Skarbimir, thanks to bribery, could stopped Borivoj II. With a vast amount of money, the Bohemian ruler returned to his homeland and was concluded a short-lived peace with Bohemia. Then Borivoj II ended his alliance with Zbigniew. In order to paralyze the alliance of Pomerania and his older brother, Boleslaw carried out multiple attacks on northern land in the year 1103 (the battle of Kolobrzeg, where was defeated), and in the years 1104-1105, ended with success.\n\nThe intervention of Boleslaw in the dynastic dispute in Hungary led him in a difficul political situation. At first, he supported the pretender Almos,and marched to Hungary to help him. However, during the siege of Abaujvar in 1104, Almos changed his mind and made peace conversations with his brother and rival King Coloman, at that point Zbigniew's ally. Boleslaw then retired his troops from Hungary and in 1105 made a treaty with Coloman. It was decided then that Boleslaw didn't support Almos against the alliance Coloman-Zbigniew. In addition, the Hungarian King broke his agreements with the Bohemian Kingdom. The dynastic dispute in Prague between Borivoj II and his cousin Svatopluk caused the intervention of Boleslaw and his ally King Coloman in support of Svatopluk, with the main objective to placed him in the Bohemian throne. However, a new rebellion of Almos forced Coloman and his army to return Hungary. Boleslaw also decided to retreat. Svatopluk tried to master the city alone, but suffered a complete defeat; his attempt to seize power in Bohemia was unsuccessful.\n\nAlso in 1105, Boleslaw entered into an agreement with his half-brother, in the same way like just a few years before entered with their stepmother Judith-Sophia (who in exchange of an abundant Oprawa wdowia (dower lands), secured her neutrality in Boleslaw's political contest with Zbigniew). The treaty, signed in Tyniec, was a compromise of both brothers in foreign policy; however, no agreement about Pomerania was settled there. One year later, the treaty ended when Zbigniew refused to help his half-brother in his fight against Pomerania. While hunting, Boleslaw was unexpectedly attacked by them. In the battle, the young prince almost lost his life. Bohemia, using the involvement of Boleslaw in the Pomeranian affairs as an excuse, attacked Silesia. The prince tried to re-established the alliance with his half-brother, without success. The effect of this refusal was the rapprochement to the Bohemian Kingdom in 1106. Boleslaw managed to bribe Borivoj II and have him join his side in the contest against Zbigniew and shortly after formally allied himself with Coloman of Hungary. With the help of his Kievan and Hungarian allies Boleslaw attacked Zbigniew’s territory, and began a civil war for the supreme power in Poland. The allied forces of Boleslaw easily took control of most important cities including Kalisz, Gniezno, Spycimierz and Leczyca, in effect taking half of Zbigniew’s lands. Through a mediation of Baldwin, Bishop of Krakow, a peace treaty was signed at Leczyca, in which Zbigniew officially recognized Boleslaw as the Supreme Prince of all Poland. However, he was allowed to retain Masovia as a fief.\n\nFirst Expedition to Bohemia and exile of Zbigniew\n\nIn 1107 Boleslaw III along with his ally King Coloman of Hungary, invaded Bohemia in order to aid Svatopluk in gaining the Czech throne. The intervention in the Czech succession was meant to secure Polish interests to the south. The expedition was a full success: on 14 May 1107 Svatopluk was made Duke of Bohemia in Prague.\n\nLater that year Boleslaw undertook a punitive expedition against his brother Zbigniew. The reason for this was that Zbigniew didn't follow his orders and refused to burn down one of the fortresses of Kurow near Pulawy. Another reason was that Zbigniew not followed his duties as a vassal and didn't provide military aid to Boleslaw for a campaign against the Pomeranians. In the winter of 1107–1108 with the help of Kievan and Hungarian allies, Boleslaw began a final campaign to rid himself of Zbigniew. His forces attacked Mazovia, and quickly forced Zbigniew to surrender. Following this Zbigniew was banished from the country and with his followers, took refuge in Prague, where he found support in Svatopluk. From then Boleslaw was the sole lord of the Polish lands, though in fact his over-lordship began in 1107 when Zbigniew paid him homage as his feudal lord.\n\nIn 1108 the balance of power in Europe changed. Svatopluk decided to paid homage to Emperor Henry V and in exchange, received from him the formal investidure of Bohemia. At the same time, King Coloman of Hungary was under attack by the combined forces of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia. Svatopluk also directed an attack to Poland; in this expedition took part Zbigniew and his followers. Boleslaw avoided a direct confrontation because was busy again in his fight against Pomerania. Now, the Polish-Hungarian coalition decided to give help and shelter to Borivoj II. Later that year, Boleslaw and Coloman made an new expedition against Bohemia. This expedition was prompted by the invasion of the German-Bohemian coalition to Hungary (siege to Pozsony Castle) and the fact that Svatopluk, who owed Boleslaw his throne, didn't honor his promise in which he returned Silesian cities seized from Poland (Raciborz, Kamieniec, Kozle among others) by his predecessors. Boleslaw then decided to restore Borivoj II in the Bohemian throne. This attempt was unsuccessful as a result of the attack of the Pomeranians. Boleslaw was forced to bring his army to the north, where could repelled the invasion. Thanks to this situation, Borivoj II failed to regain the throne.\n\nPolish-German War of 1109\n\nIn response to Boleslaw’s aggressive foreign policy, German king and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V undertook a punitive expedition against Poland in 1109 (the later called Polish-German War). In this fight, Henry V was assisted by Czech warriors provided by Svatopluk of Bohemia. The alleged reason for the war was the exile of Zbigniew and his restoration. Boleslaw received an ultimatum from the German King: he abandoned the expedition against him only if Zbigniew was restored with half of Poland as a rule, the formal recognition of the Holy Roman Empire as overlord and the payment of 300 pieces of fine silver as a regular tribute. Boleslaw rejected. During the negotiations between Germany and Poland, the Polish ruler was in the middle of a war against Pomerania. On the west side of the Oder river, Henry V hurriedly gathered knights for his expedition against Poland. Before the fight ended in Pomerania, the German troops have been able to approach Glogow.\n\nThe military operations mainly taken place in southwestern Poland, in Silesia, where Henry V’s army laid siege to major strongholds of Glogow, Wroclaw and Bytom Odrzanski. At this time along with the defense of towns, Boleslaw was conducting a highly effective guerrilla war against the Holy Roman Emperor and his allies, and eventually he defeated the German Imperial forces at the legendary Battle of Hundsfeld on 24 August 1109, who received that name because the dogs devoured the many corpses left in the battlefield. In the end Henry V was forced to withdraw from Silesia and Poland altogether. The heroic defense of towns by villagers, where Polish children were used as human shields by the Germans, in large measure contributed to the German inability to succeed and gave the battle a national character.\n\nSecond Expedition to Bohemia\n\nIn 1110 Boleslaw undertook an unsuccessful military expedition against Bohemia. His intention was to install yet another pretender on the Czech throne, Sobeslav I, who sought refuge in Poland. During the campaign won a decisive victory against the Czechs at the Battle of Trutina on 8 October 1110; however, following this battle he ordered his forces to withdraw further attack against Bohemia. The reason for this is speculated to be the unpopularity of Sobeslav I among Czechs as well as Boleslaw’s unwillingness to further deteriorate his relations with the Holy Roman Empire. In 1111 a truce between Poland and the Holy Roman Empire was signed which stipulated that Sobeslav I would be able to return to Bohemia while Zbigniew would be able to return Poland. Boleslaw probably also agreed with the return of his half-brother as a result of pressure from the many supporters of the exiled prince in 1108, who according to the reports of Gallus Anonymus was surrounded to bad advisers (in this group unfavorable to Boleslaw was probably Martin I, Archbishop of Gniezno). Once in Poland, Zbigniew could claim the sovereignty over his previous domains at the instigation of this group. The first step towards this was his presence in the Advent ceremonial (which was forbidden to him by Boleslaw after recognizing him as his overlord in Leczyca in 1107), which is reserved only for rulers. Zbigniew arrived surrounded by attendants, being carried before him a sword. This could be perceived by Boleslaw as an act of treason and caused a definitive breach in their relationship, under which Zbigniew was the vassal and Boleslaw the ruler. Probably these factors influenced Boleslaw's decision of a terrible punishment to Zbigniew: a year later, in 1112, he was blinded on Boleslaw’s orders.\n\nExcommunication\n\nThe blinding of Zbigniew caused a strong negative reaction among Boleslaw's subjects. It should be noted that unlike for instance in the east, blinding in medieval Poland was not accomplished by burning the eyes out with a red hot iron rod or knife, but a much more brutal technique was employed. The condemned man's eyes were pried out using special pliers. The convict was made to open his eyes and if he did not do so, his eyelids were torn out along with his eyeballs.\n\nContemporary sources don't provide clear information if Boleslaw was indeed excluded from the community of the Church. Is generally believed that Archbishop Martin I of Gniezno (who was a strong supporter of Zbigniew) excommunicated Boleslaw for committing this crime against his half-brother. The excommunication exempted all Boleslaw's subjects from his oath to obedience. The prince was faced with a real possibility of uprising, of the sort that deposed Boleslaw the Bold. Seeing his precarious situation Boleslaw sought the customary penance that would reconcile the high priesthood. According to Gallus Anonymus, Boleslaw first fasted for forty days and made gifts to the poors:\n\nIt's possible that Boleslaw decided to celebrated a public penance as a result of the negative public response to the blinding of Zbigniew. His intention with this was to rebuild his weakened authority and gain the favor of Zbigniew's supportets. Punishment of blinding was used in medieval Europe to the rebellious nobles. This act of Boleslaw against his half-brother could be received by the Polish society as a breach of the principle of solidarity among the members of the ruling dynasty, accepting the foundation of public order.\n\nAccording to Gallus, Boleslaw also sought and received forgiveness from his half-brother. In the next part of his penance, the prince made a pilgrimage to Hungary to the Abbeys of Saint Giles in Somogyvar and King Saint Stephen I in Szekesfehervar. The pilgrimage to the Abbey of Saint Giles also had a political goal; Boleslaw strengthened his ties of friendship and alliance with the Arpad dynasty. Following his return to Poland, Boleslaw even traveled to Gniezno to pay further penance at the tomb of Saint Adalbert of Prague, were poor people and clergy received numerous costly gifts from the prince. Only after this the excommunication was finally lifted. Following his repentance the Polish prince made a vague commitment to the Church.\n\nAbout Zbigniew's death there are not preserved information. In the obituary of the Benedictine monastery in Lubin dated 8 July 1113 was reported the death of a monk in Tyniec called brother Zbigniew. Historians believed that he could be Boleslaw's half-brother. The information marked that his burial place was in the Benedictine monastery of Tyniec.\n\nConquest and conversion of Pomerania\n\nThe separation of Pomerania during the reign of Casimir I the Restorer contributed to the weakening of the Polish state, and subsequent rulers during the second half of the 11th century weren't able to unite all the lands that once belonged to Mieszko I and Boleslaw I the Brave. All attempts made to reconquer this area failed. Only after defeating Zbigniew and repelling the claims of Bohemia against Silesia during the Polis-German War of 1109, Boleslaw III Wrymouth was able to directed the expansion to the West, which he intended to return to Poland.\n\nStrengthening the Polish-Pomeranian borders\n\nThe issue of conquest of Pomerania had been a lifelong pursuit for Boleslaw III Wrymouth. His political goals were twofold; first – to strengthen the Polish border on the Notec river line, second – to subjugate Pomerania with Polish political overlordship but without actually incorporating it into the country with the exception of Gdansk Pomerania and a southern belt north of river Notec which were to be absorbed by Poland. By 1113 the northern border has been strengthened. The fortified border cities included: Santok, Wielen, Naklo, Czarnkow, Ujscie and Wyszogrod. Some sources report that the border began at the mouth of river Warta and Oder in the west, ran along the river Notec all the way to the Vistula river.\n\nBefore Boleslaw III began to expand in Gdansk Pomerania (Pomerelia), he normalized his political relations with Bohemia. This took place in 1114 at a great convention on the border of the Nysa Klodzka river. In addition to Boleslaw also assisted Bohemian princes of the Premyslid line: Vladislaus I, Otto II the Black and Sobeslav I. The pact was sealed by the marriage of Boleslaw (a widower since his wife Zbyslava's death) with Vladislaus I and Otto II's sister-in-law, the German noblewoman Salomea of Berg.\n\nThe conquest of Gdansk Pomerania\n\nAfter being normalized his relations with Bohemia, Boleslaw directed his efforts against Prussia, and in 1115 he made a victorious expedition, ravaging their tribal lands. As a result, the north-east border was at peace, which allowed to freely prepare the invasion to Gdansk Pomerania. The conquest of this part of the Pomeranian lands (made during the years 1115-1119), crowned a long-time struggle of previous Polish rulers. The result was the complete incorporation of the territories on the Vistula River, including the castellany of Naklo, to Poland. Northern borders were established Polish Duchy probably on the line along the rivers Gwda and Uniesta (in later times currents of these rivers were the boundary between Pomerania and the Oder Slavic). It's also possible that the border ran along the Leba.\n\nThe local rulers of the conquered Gdansk and Slupsk were removed from power and replaced by Polish nobles. Boleslaw also introduced Polish clerical organization, which was made in order to protect his interests in that territory. However, these areas refused to follow the church organization. The incorporation to the Polish Church occurred only during 1125-1126 at the time of the visit of Papal Legate Gilles, Cardinal-Bishop of Tusculum.\n\nRebellion of Skarbimir\n\nDuring Boleslaw's Pomeranian campaign a formidable rebellion led by Count Palatine Skarbimir from the Awdaniec family began. The rebellion was quelled by the prince in 1117 and the mutinous nobleman were blinded as punishment. The conflict between Boleslaw and the Awdaniec family is difficult to explained due to the lack of sources. The cause was probably the growing influence of the family, the ambition and jealousy of Skarbimir against Boleslaw and his increased popularity. Another probable factor was the desire to put Wladyslaw II, Boleslaw's first-born son, as the sole ruler after his death or also Boleslaw's fears to lose his position, as it was in the conflict with Sieciech. It was also suggested that Skarbimir entered in contacts with Pomeranians and Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kievan Rus'. Medieval historiography also associated the rebellion with the Law of Succession issued by Boleslaw. The problem with the principle of inheritance appeared between 1115-1116 (after the birth of his second son Leszek, first-born from his second marriage). According to one hypothesis Skarbimir objected the adoption of the statute who changed the traditional Polish succession customs. In the suppression of the rebellion played a major role Piotr Wlostowic of the Labedz family, who replaced Skarbimir as Count Palatine. Defeated, Skarbimir received a minor punishment from Boleslaw. The rebellion of Skarbimir also rested importance to the conquest of Gdansk Pomerania.\n\nIntervention of Kievan Rus'\n\nProbably in the rebellion of Skarbimir intervened the Rurikid ruler Vladimir II Monomakh and his sons. In 1118 Monomakh incorporated Volhynia to his domains and expelled his ruler, Yaroslav Sviatopolkovich, who sought refuge firstly in Hungary, then in Poland. In Yaroslav's place, Monomakh put his son Roman as a ruler of Volhynia, and after his early death in 1119, replaced him with another son, Andrew, who in 1120 invaded Polish territory with the support of the Kipchaks tribe. A year later, Boleslaw with the exiled Yaroslav (who was his brother-in-law), organized a retaliatory expedition to Czermno. After this, for several years Boleslaw intervened in the dynastic disputes of the House of Rurik.\n\nDuring the 1120s the Kievan princes continue their expeditions against Poland. The neutrality of the neighboring Principality of Peremyshl was attributed to Count Palatine Piotr Wlostowic, who in 1122 captured Prince Volodar. A year later Boleslaw intervened again in Volhynia, where he wanted to restore Yaroslav. The expedition (aided by the Bohemian, Hungarian, Peremyshl and Terebovl forces) failed due to the death of Yaroslav and the stubborn resistance of the besieged Volodymyr-Volynskyi, aided by Skarbimir's supporters. This failed military expedition led to disturbances in the Polish-Hungarian-Halych alliance.\n\nConquest of Western Pomerania\n\nIn 1121 (or 1119) Pomeranian Dukes Wartislaw I and Swietopelk I were defeated by Boleslaw's army at the battle of Niekladz near Gryfice. Polish troops ravaged Pomerania, destroyed native strongholds, and forced thousands of Pomeranians to resettle deep into Polish territory. Boleslaw's further expansion was directed to Szczecin (1121-1122). He knew that this city was well defended by both the natural barrier of the Oder river and his well-built fortifications, like Kolobrzeg. The only way to approach the walls was through the frozen waters of a nearby swamp. Taking advantage of this element of surprise, Boleslaw launched his assault from precisely that direction, and took control of the city. Much of the population was slaughtered and the survivors were forced to paid homage to the Polish ruler.\n\nA further step is probably fought battles on the western side of the Oder River, where Boleslaw had addressed areas to the Lake Morzyce (now the German Muritz). These areas were outside the territorial scope of Pomeranians. In parallel with the expansion of the Polish ruler to the west continued the conquest of these lands by Lothair, Duke of Saxony (and future Holy Roman Emperor). According to contemporary sources, a Saxon army approaching from above the Elbe River in the direction of today's Rostock. They conquered the Warinis, Circipanes, Kessinians and part of the Tollensers tribes. The expansion led by the two rulers was probably the result of earlier unknown agreements. This was the first step for the later Christianization of Pomeranian lands.\n\nIn 1122 Boleslaw finally conquered Western Pomerania, who became a Polish fief. Duke Wartislaw I was forced to paid homage to the Polish ruler, paying an annual tribute of 500 marks of fine silver and the obligation to give military aid to Poland at Boleslaw’s request. In subsequent years the tribute was reduced to 300 marks. This success enabled Boleslaw to made further conquests. In 1123 his troops even reached to Rugen, but didn't mastered these areas.\n\nAccording to modern historiography, Boleslaw began to pay tribute to Emperor Henry V, at least from 1135. Is believed that the amount was 500 marks of fine silver annually. It's unknown why Boleslaw began to paid homage to Henry V, as the sources do not mention any reference about the Polish ruler being tributary of the Holy Roman Empire in the period 1121-1135.\n\nChristianization of Western Pomerania\n\nIn order to make Polish and Pomeranian ties stronger, Boleslaw organized a mission to Christianize the newly acquired territory. The Polish monarch understood that the Christianization of the conquered territory would be an effective means of strengthening his authority there. At the same time he wished to subordinate Pomerania to the Gniezno Archbishopric. Unfortunately first attempts made by unknown missionaries did not make the desired progress. Another attempt, officially sponsored by Boleslaw and led by Bernard the Spaniard, who traveled to Wolin during 1122-1123, has ended in another failure. The next two missions were carried out in 1124–1125 and 1128 by Bishop Otto of Bamberg (called the Apostle of Pomerania). After appropriate consultation with Boleslaw, Bishop Otto set out on a first stage of Christianization of the region in 1124. In his mission Otto stayed firstly at Boleslaw's court, where he was provided with appropriate equipment, fire and several clergymen for his trip to Pomerania.\n\nThe Bishop was accompanied throughout his mission by the Pomeranian ruler Wartislaw I, who greeted him on the border of his domains, in the environs of the city of Sanok. In Stargard the pagan prince promised Otto his assistance in the Pomeranian cities as well as help during the journey. He also assigned 500 armored knights to act as guards for the bishop’s protection, and obtain the baptism of the elders tribal leaders. Primary missionary activities were directed to Pyrzyce, then the towns of Kamien, Wolin, Szczecin and once again Wolin. In the first two towns the Christianization went without resistance. In Kamien the task was facilitated by the intercession of Wartislaw I's own wife and dignitaries. At Szczecin and Wolin, which were important centers of Slavic paganism, opposition to conversion was particularly strong among the pagan priests and local population. The conversion was finally accepted only after Boleslaw lowered the annual tribute imposed on the Pomeranians. Four great pagan temples were torn down and churches were built in their places. Otto's mission of 1124 ended with the erection of bishoprics in Lubusz for Western Pomerania and in Kruszwica for Eastern Pomerania (Gdansk), which was subordinated to the Archbishopric of Gniezno.\n\nIn 1127 the first pagan rebellions began to take place. These were due to both the large tribute imposed by Poland as well as a plague that descended on Pomerania and which was blamed on Christianity. The rebellions were largely instigated by the old pagan priests, who had not come to terms with their new circumstances. Wartislaw I confronted these uprisings with some success, but was unable to prevent several insurgent raids into Polish territory. Because of this Boleslaw was preparing a massive punitive expedition that may have spoiled all the earlier accomplishments of missionary work by Bishop Otto. Thanks to Otto’s diplomacy direct confrontation was avoided and in 1128 he embarked on another mission to Pomerania. Wartislaw I greeted Otto at Demmin with some Polish knights. This time more stress was applied to the territories west of the Oder River, i.e. Usedom, Wolgast and Gutzkow, which weren't under Polish suzerainty. The final stage of the mission returned to Szczecin, Wolin and Kamien. The Christianization of Pomerania is considered one of the greatest accomplishments of Boleslaw’s Pomeranian policy.\n\nIn 1129 Boleslaw concluded with Niels, King of Denmark an alliance directed against Wartislaw I and the attempts of Lothair III, King of Germany to subordinate Western Pomerania. In retaliation for the sack of Plock by Wartislaw I in 1128, Polish-Danish troops taken the Western Pomeranian islands of Wolin and Usedom.\n\nAt end of the 1120s Boleslaw began to implement an ecclesiastical organization of Pomerania. Gdansk Pomerania was added to the Diocese of Wloclawek, known at the time as the Kujavian Diocese. A strip of borderland north of Notec was split between the Diocese of Gniezno and Diocese of Poznan. The bulk of Pomerania was however made an independent Pomeranian bishopric (whose first Bishop was one of the participants in the missionary expedition and former Polish royal chaplain, Adalbert), set up in the territory of the Duchy of Pomerania in 1140, and after Boleslaw had died in 1138 the duchy became independent from Poland.\n\nThe project of Archbishop Norbert of Magdeburg\n\nDuring the 1130s a project was designed by Norbert, Archbishop of Magdeburg, under which Pomerania would be divided between two dioceses subordinated to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. At the same, he revivied the old claims about Magdeburg's ecclesiastical sovereignty over all Poland. A first Bull was prepared already in 1131, but never entered into force. Despite adversity, Norbert continued his actions to subdue the Polish Church during 1132-1133. For the Polish bishops, a call was made in the Curia.\n\nThe Polish bishops didn't appear before Pope Innocent II, which resulted in the issuing of the Bull Sacrosancta Romana in 1133, which confirmed the sovereignty of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg over the Polish Church and the projected Pomeranian dioceses. The formal privilegium maius was the culmination of Norbert's efforts. Boleslaw, trying to save his past efforts in Pomeranian politics, opted for his submission at Merseburg in 1135.\n\nConquest of Rugen and alliance with Wartislaw I\n\nTo consolidate his power over Pomerania Boleslaw conducted in 1130 an expedition to the island of Rugen. For this purpose, he concluded an alliance with the Danish duke Magnus Nilsson (his son-in-law) who provided him with a fleet in exchange for support in his efforts to obtain the Swedish throne. The fleet of Magnus transported Polish troops to the shores of the island of Rugen. However, the intended battle on the island doesn't happen, because the Rani at the sight of the Polish-Danish combined forces recognize Boleslaw 's overlordship.\n\nAfter the successful invasion to the Danish capital, Roskilde in 1134 Boleslaw formed an alliance with Wartislaw I of Pomerania against King Eric II of Denmark (an ally of Emperor Lothair III). The role of the Polish prince was limited only to aid the House of Griffins, not due while the real interest in Danish affairs. The Danish, after repelling the first attack, in retaliation led an expedition who led to their expansion into the lands of Pomerania.\n\nPolitical Background\n\nIn 1125 Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany, died. His successor, Lothair of Supplinburg, has been embroiled in disputes over his inheritance. For the Imperial crown, he became involved in the affairs of the Papacy. In 1130 there was a double election to the Apostolic See. Lothair supported Pope Innocent II, hoping in this way to secure his own coronation. Contrary to was expected, Lothair's Imperial coronation didn't end his disputes against the contenders for the German throne.\n\nIn 1130 Boleslaw controlled the areas situated on the left bank of the Oder river on the island of Rugen. Germany also wanted to control these lands, but the internal political situation and the involvement in the civil war in Hungary, however, didn't allow an armed conflict. The Bull Sacrosancta Romana of 1133 give the Archbishopric of Magdeburg sovereign rights over the Pomeranian dioceses instituted by Boleslaw.\n\nThe death of King Stephen II of Hungary in 1131 led the country into civil war between two claimaints to the throne: Bela the Blind (son of Almos, Duke of Croatia) and Boris (the alleged son of King Coloman). Boris sought the help of the Polish ruler, who hoped for a closer alliance with Hungary and cooperation with the Kievan Rus' princes (Boris was a son of a daughter of Vladimir II Monomakh). However, Boleslaw overestimated his strength against Bela, who counted with the support of almost all his country. The Polish army faced the combined forces of Hungary, Bohemia, Austria and Germany in the Battle of the Sajo river (22 July 1132), where the coalition had a complete victory over the Polish prince, who was forced to retreat.\n\nThe success in Hungary was used by the Bohemian ruler Sobeslav I, an Imperial vassal, who during the years 1132-1134 repeatedly led invasions to Silesia. The issue over the property of Silesia was subjected to the decision of Lothair III.\n\nPreparations for the Congress\n\nIn February 1134 Sobeslav I of Bohemia and dignitaries of King Bela II of Hungary, together with Bishop Peter of Szekesfehervar went to Altenburg, where they presented their allegations against the Polish ruler. They asked the intervention of the Holy Roman Empire (preliminary requests occurred two years earlier). Lothair III accepted the request, acting as an arbitrator in the dynastic disputes in Central Europe.\n\nAt the same time Bela II and Prince Volodymyrko of Peremyshl undertook a military expedition against Poland. The combined forces occupied Lesser Poland, reaching to Wislica. Shortly after, Boleslaw received a summons to the Imperial court at Magdeburg on 26 June 1135. Playing for time, however, he only send deputies. The emperor sent another delegation and requested a personal appearance of the Polish ruler, setting a new date on 15 August 1135, this time in Merseburg. Boleslaw realized that without an agreement with Lothair III he couldn't maintain the control over the newly conquered lands on the west side of the Oder and the island of Rugen.\n\nEven before the Congress of Merseburg was performed, Boleslaw persuaded one of ruling princes of Western Pomerania, Ratibor I to made an expedition against Denmark. It was a clear expression of ostentation to Emperor Lothair III because the King of Denmark was a German vassal. The fleet formed by 650 boats (with 44 knights and 2 horses) attacked the rich Norwegian port city of Kungahalla (now Kungalv in Sweden).\n\nProvisions of the Congress\n\nThe Congress took place on 15 August 1135. During the ceremony, Emperor Lothair III recognized the rights of the Polish ruler over Pomerania. In retribution, Boleslaw agreed to paid homage for the Pomeranian lands and the Principality of Rugen, with the payment of 6000 pieces of fine silver from these lands to the Holy Roman Empire; however he remained fully independent ruler of his main realm, Poland. With Boleslaw's death in 1138, Polish authority over Pomerania ended, triggering competition of the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark for the area. The conflict with Hungary also ended, with Boleslaw recognizing Bela II's rule. The agreement was sealed with the betrothal of Boleslaw's daughter Judith with Bela II's Geza (this marriage never took place). In case of the Bohemian-Polish dispute the Imperial mediation failed. Boleslaw argued he must be treated as a sovereign ruler, who wasn't the case of Sobeslav I, an imperial vassal. Lothair III, unable to come to an agreement with the Polish ruler, proposed to discuss the matter in subsequent negotiations.\n\nThe Congress ended with church ceremonies, during which Boleslaw carried the imperial sword. This was an honor granted only to sovereign rulers. An indirect goal of Polish diplomacy was the successful invalidation of the Papal Bull of 1133 and the recognition of metropolitan rights of the Archbishopric of Gniezno at the Synod in Pisa in 1135. On 7 July 1136 was issued the protectionist Bull Ex commisso nobis a Deo under which Pope Innocent II confirmed the unquestioned sovereignty of the Archbishopric of Gniezno over the Polish dioceses.\n\nNormalization of relations with his neighbors\n\nAfter entering in the imperial sphere of influence, Poland normalized his relations with Bohemia at the Congress of Klodzko on 30 May 1137 (the so-called Peace of Klodzko), but the details of this agreement are unknown. This treaty was confirmed in the town of Niemcza, where Wladyslaw, the eldest son of Boleslaw, stood as godfather in the baptism of Wenceslaus, Sobeslav I's son.\n\nIn the last years of his life, Boleslaw's main concern was to arranged political marriages for his children in order to strengthening his relations with neighboring countries. In 1137 Boleslaw reinforced his relations with the Kievan Rus' with the marriage of his son Boleslaw with Princess Viacheslava, daughter of Vsevolod, Prince of Pskov. In the year of his death, by contrast, finally normalized his relations with Hungary through the marriage of his son Mieszko with Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Bela II.\n\nDeath\n\nBoleslaw III Wrymouth died on 28 October 1138, probably in the town of Sochaczew. There are no records about the circumstances of his death. 12th century sources didn't provide information about his place of burial. It was only in the 15th century, when Jan Dlugosz recorded that the Prince's tomb was in the Masovian Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral in Plock. However, he didn't showed from where took this information. Presumably the chronicler took this report from the lost Rocznik mazowiecki. Wawrzyniec Wszerecz, Canon of Plock during the 16th-17th century, wrote that Boleslaw was in a common coffin at the Cathedral, where the remains of his father Wladyslaw I Herman and several other Piast Masovian rulers were also placed.\n\nMarriages and Issue\n\nBoleslaw was married twice:\n\nZbyslava (b. ca. 1085/90 – d. ca. 1114), his first wife, was a member of the Rurikid dynasty. She was the daughter of Sviatopolk II Michael, Prince of Polotsk (1069–1071), of Novgorod (1078–1088), of Turov (1088–1093) and Grand Prince of Kiev (1093–1113). The marriage was probably concluded in 1103 with the purpose to obtain future military help from Kiev in the fight against Zbigniew. This union also notoriously limited the attacks of the Princes of Galicia and Terebovlia against Poland. Until Zbyslava's death the relations between Poland and the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia remained friendly.\n\nSalomea (b. ca. 1093/1101 – d. 27 July 1144), his second wife, was a German noblewoman. She was the daughter of Henry of Berg-Schelklingen, Count of Berg. The marriage took place in January or February 1115. This union was motivated by the current political situation, on the occasion of the signing of a peace treaty between Poland and Bohemia. Salomea came from a powerful and influential family, who, after the death of Emperor Henry V in 1125, as a result of the support of the opposition in Germany, lost their political influence at the court of Lothair III.\n\nIn older historiography Adelaide, daughter of Emperor Henry IV, was erroneously considered as another wife of Boleslaw. The information about this stated that after the death of Zbyslava, Boleslaw married her in Bamberg in 1110. This report is provided by Jan Dlugosz and Archdiacon Sulger. This view was challenged by Oswald Balzer.\n\nIssue of Zbyslava of Kiev\n\nWladyslaw II the Exile (b. 1105 – d. 30 May 1159), the only son of Boleslaw and Zbyslava, was Prince of Krakow, Silesia, Sandomierz, eastern Greater Poland, Kuyavia, Western Pomerania and Gdansk Pomerania (1138-1146). Gallus Anonymous wrote that the heir of the Polish throne was born in the winter of 1107-1108, but omitted the gender and name of the child. The Rocznik swietokrzyski and Rocznik kapitulny recorded Wladyslaw's birth in 1105.\n\nA daughter [Judith?] (b. ca. 1112 – d. aft. 1124), married in 1124 to Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of Murom. Her filiation is doubtful, because in Russian chroniclers was only noted that Vsevolod's wife came from Poland; she probably could be either Boleslaw and Zbyslava's daughter or a member of the Awdaniec family as daughter of Skarbimir.\n\nOlder historiography attributed another child born from the marriage of Boleslaw and Zbyslava. In addition to Wladyslaw II and the unnamed daughter was also added an unnamed second son. Gallus Anonymous wrote that this son was born around 1107-1108. According to Oswald Balzer, he died shortly after birth. However, Karol Maleczynski believed that he never existed, pointed that probably the sources who provided the year of 1105 as Wladyslaw II's date of birth (Rocznik swietokrzyski and Rocznik kapitulny) could be made a mistake.\n\nIssue of Salomea of Berg\n\nLeszek (b. 1115/16 – d. 26 August bef. 1131), the eldest son of Boleslaw and Salomea. He probably died in infancy.\n\nRyksa (b. 1116 – d. aft. 25 December 1156), eldest daughter of Boleslaw and Salomea, in 1127 she married with to Danish prince Magnus Nilsson, future King of Vastergotland. This union was made to obtain Danish support for Poland in the war against Germany, but in 1134 Denmark took the side of Germany in the conflict. After Magnus' death in 1134, Ryksa returned to Poland. Later she married with Volodar Glebovich, Prince of Minsk and Hrodno; this marriage was concluded in order to obtain an ally in the Polish war against Hungary. Her third marriage was with King Sverker I of Sweden.\n\nA daughter (b. bef. 1117/22 – d. aft. 1131), betrothed or married in 1131 to Conrad, Count of Plotzkau and Margrave of Nordmark.\n\nCasimir, known in historiography as the Older (b. 9 August 1122 – d. 19 October 1131), according to sources (like Rocznik kapituly krakowskiej), he died aged 9. Jan Dlugosz in his chronicle wrote that he was born from the marriage of Boleslaw and Adelaide, the Prince's supposed second wife.\n\nGertruda (b. 1123/24 – d. 7 May 1160), a nun at Zwiefalten (1139).\n\nBoleslaw IV the Curly (b. ca. 1125 – d. 5 January 1173), Prince of Masovia and Kuyavia (1138-1146), of Krakow, Gniezno and Kalisz (1146-1173), of Sandomierz (1166-1173), married aged 12 with Viacheslava, daughter of Vsevolod, Prince of Pskov. Jan Dlugosz reported his birth in 1127 as the second son born from Boleslaw and Adelaide.\n\nMieszko III the Old (b. 1126/27 – d. Kalisz, 13 March 1202), Prince of Greater Poland (1138-1202), of Krakow (1173-1177, 1190, 1199-1202), of Kalisz (1173-1202), of Upper Gdansk Pomerania (1173-1202) and Kuyavia (1195-1198), around 1136 married to Elizabeth, daughter of King Bela II of Hungary. The marriage was concluded as one of the provisions of the Congress of Merseburg.\n\nDobroniega (b. 1129 – d. by 1160), after her father's death she was married by her mother Salomea around 1141-1142 to Theodoric I, Margrave of Lusatia, who later repudiated her.\n\nJudith (b. 1130 – d. 8 July 1175), betrothed in 1136 to Prince Geza, son of King Bela II of Hungary; however the marriage never took place and in 1148 she married to Otto I, Margrave of Brandenburg.\n\nHenry (b. 1131 – d. 18 October 1166), Prince of Sandomierz (1146-1166), according to Jan Dlugosz he was born in 1132. Further mention of him was made in his chronicle by 1139, describing the division of the country in districts. Karol Maleczynski placed his birth between 1127 and 1131. During his father's lifetime Henry didn't play an important political role. He died in 1166 in battle against the Prussians, unmarried and childless.\n\nAgnes (b. 1137 – d. aft. 1182), around 1140-1141 she was a proposed bride to one of the sons of Grand Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev. This union was to ensure the support of Kiev in the dispute between Salomea's sons and Wladyslaw II, their half-brother. At the end, the marriage never took place and she married around 1149-1151 to Mstislav II, Prince of Pereyaslavl and Grand Prince of Kiev since 1168.\n\nCasimir II the Just (b. 1138 – d. 5 May 1194), Prince of Wislica (1166-1173), of Sandomierz (1173-1194) of Krakow (1177-1194), of Masovia and Kuyavia (1186-1194), for a long time considered a posthumous child, and for this reason not included in his father's testament.\n\nOlder historiography attributed another two daughters from the marriage of Boleslaw and Salomea: Adelaide and Sophia. Adelaide (b. ca. 1114 - d. 25 March bef. 1132), was the first wife of Adalbert II the Pious, eldest son of Leopold III, Margrave of Austria. Modern historians denies that she was a daughter of Boleslaw. Sophia (d. 10 October 1136), was probably the mother of Mateusz, Bishop of Krakow.\n\nThe Senioral Principle\n\nHis own experiences during his youth probably motivated Boleslaw to made a division of his domains between his surviving sons. At the trustee of his provisions was appointed the faithful Count Palatine Piotr Wlostowic. In his testament, also known as the \"Statute of Succession\", Boleslaw introduced in Poland the Senioral Principle, in an effort to keep the unity of the state and to prevent the struggle for power among his sons. This regulation about the succession came into force after Boleslaw's death, although is unknown the exact date of his establishment. It's believed that his creation could happen in 1115 or 1116, after the birth of a son Leszek, or after the suppression of the rebellion of Skarbimir (in 1117). Sources indicate that the original document about the succession was established in 1137. The Statute was nullified in 1180 but restored by Pope Innocent III in 1210 after a petition of the Silesian rulers; however, historians challenge the approval of the Statute by the Pope in the absence of any other information.\n\nThe \"Senioral Principle\" established that the eldest member of the dynasty was to have supreme power over the rest and was also to control an indivisible \"senioral part\": a vast strip of land running north-south down the middle of Poland, with Krakow its chief city. The Senior's prerogatives also included control over Pomerania, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. Sources showed a discrepancy in terms of the power exercised by the Senior Prince. Pope Innocent III talked about Primogeniture, while Wincenty Kadlubek refers to both Seniority and Primogeniture. Kadlubek combined in one sentence the two systems, i.e. inheritance of supreme power in individual districts, where Primogeniture was in force. Among historians, there is a view that Boleslaw not established Seniority, but Primogeniture that belongs exclusively to Wladyslaw II and his descendants. A fact who supported this hypothesis was the coverage and nature of power exercised by Boleslaw IV the Curly in 1146.\n\nDivision of the Polish state\n\nBoleslaw divided his domains into the following provinces:\n\nThe Seniorate Province (with his capital Krakow) was supposed to be non-inherited and indivisible. It consisted of Lesser Poland, Sieradz and Leczyca, the western part of Kruszwica and Kuyavia, the eastern part of Greater Poland, Kalisz, Gniezno and Gdansk Pomerania. Western Pomerania as a fief would remain under the control of the Princeps.\n\nWladyslaw II received the Silesian Province, comprising Silesia, with his capital Wroclaw and the Lubusz land. He probably received this domain already between 1124-1125 after his marriage with Agnes of Babenberg. As the eldest son, he became in the first Senior Prince (or Princeps).\n\nBoleslaw IV received the Masovian Province, with his capital in Plock and eastern Kuyavia.\n\nMieszko III received the Greater Poland Province, composed of the remaining western parts of Greater Poland, with his capital in Poznan.\n\nHenry received the Sandomierz Province, composed of eastern Lesser Polish territories centered around the city of Sandomierz and the Bug River to the north, with his capital in Lublin.\n\nSalomea of Berg, Boleslaw's widow, received Leczyca or Sieradz-Leczyca as her Oprawa wdowia or widow's seat. After her death, these lands were to be included in the Seniorate Province.\n\nCasimir II, Boleslaw's youngest son, wasn't included in the Testament, because he was born after his father's death or shortly before.\n\nAmong medievalists there is a view that the Statute only provide the inheritance of Boleslaw's descendants in the first generation (i.e. his sons). After their deaths, their lands were to be included in the Seniorate Province. However, the later fights between them made the provinces transformed into a hereditary domains.\n\nFeudal division of Poland\n\nThe \"Senioral Principle\" was soon broken, leading to a period of nearly 200 years of Poland's disintegration, also known as feudal fragmentation, a phenomenon common in medieval Europe. Among others countries who were affected by this are Russia, Hungary and Germany. This was a time of internal struggles that caused the weakening of the Polish state and the enormous growth of internal development, culture, and improving the situation of the broad masses of the population. Distribution of the then princely rights by contemporary historiography also had a good side, which include: the reconstruction of the political system in the new economic fundamentals and increasing responsibility for the fate of the country placed upon its upper echelons.\n\nOrganization of the Polish state during Boleslaw's rule\n\nA detailed knowledge of the internal organization of the 12th century Polish state is impossible. There are no documents from this period and the reports of chroniclers showed problems about a real knowledge of the principality's management.\n\nBoleslaw divided his domains into provinces, districts and grods (a type of fortified village or castellany). Within them remained the Opole. Territorial scope of the province corresponded to the laters Dzielnica. It's believed that 6-7 provinces were created: Masovia, Silesia, Greater Poland, Krakow, Sandomierz, Kalisz-Leczyca and Pomerania (from the lands of Gdansk Pomerania). During Boleslaw's reign attempts were made to organize the borders areas marches following the German model. Among the marches corroborated in the available sources are: Glogow, Gdansk and probably Lubusz. Probably Boleslaw had a number of well-maintained castles that served in the political, economic and administrative spheres.\n\nThe State's nature during the Piast dynasty was patrimonial. The Ducal court (Latin: curia ducis) was a center of power, which belonged to the reigning family (along with a separate court by the Duchess), after them came the secular and Church dignitaries and subjects, next to lower officials, chivalry and courtly princely members and chaplains. The most important office at the court of Wladyslaw I Herman and Boleslaw was the Count Palatine (also known as Voivode). The Count palatine (Latin: comes palatinus) included major command of the military expeditions (in place of the ruler), defense of the State, supervision of the administration (as head of the Ducal court), control and appointment of the heads of the castellanies and the exercise of the courts. The Count Palatine Office was abolished in 1180. Already during the reign of Mieszko II Lambert saw the development of Polish bureaucratic apparatus. The Collector (Latin: camerarius), managed the economy of the ducal court. Another specific offices in the Ducal court the Czesnik (cup-bearer), the Stolnik (esquire), the Straznik (guard), the Miecznik (Sword-bearer), the Koniuszy (Master of the Horse) and the Lowczy (Master of the Hunt). During Boleslaw's reign appeared the office of the Chancellor, who directed the work of the court offices and the Ducal chapel (Latin: capella), which consisted of a bunch of secular and religious duties. Also belonged to the central government the Treasurer, the Mint Master and others. Also during the rule of Boleslaw the structure of the state was closely linked to the organization of the Polish Church. The church was subject to the ruler, which had the right of Investiture.\n\nThe Ducal court was in contact with the subjects via the castellanies, who were managed by the Naczelnik or Town Chief (Latin: princeps terrae). He had sovereignty over the castellanies or Grods (Latin: comes), while the castellans (Grod rulers) should exercise the local civil authority, getting benefits from the public, organizing the defense and probably exercising the courts. Under the direct obligation of the ruler are the Bailiff, the Zupan (Gastald), the Minters, the Celnik (Tax collector) and collectors. All important functions in the principality are held by the nobility. The Castellan belonged to the group of nobles, officials and ministerialis. Some had served directly to the ruler, others held the offices, while the role of others are of food shortages. The Margraves (who are in charge of the border areas) were directly subordinate to the Polish ruler and had greater power than the Provincial chiefs.\n\nAt the end of the 11th century waned this princely organization. Was replaced with the Western European model of troops consisting of chivalry. The Latin term milites, which previously was used to determine the soldiers came to be called the category of Knights and warriors who could afford to keep a horse. Polish armed forces in Boleslaw's times are composed of three types of forces: the Princely army (Oddzialu nadwornego), the Lords army (Druzyny moznowladcow) and the militia (Pospolite ruszenie), composed of branches of small feudal lords and peasants (according to other views the militia adjutant troops were powerful and also composed by clergy and laity).\n\nThe Princely army consisting of his nobles -at the end of the 11th century, the so-called \"New People\" (pl: Nowi Ludzie): tribal chiefs, local leaders and opolne rulers who aspired to participate in government, sent their sons to the Prince's court, where he was accompanied the ruler-. Boleslaw's personal guard was probably chosen by himself, using an invocation which was written in the Chronicles of Gallus Anonymous:\n\nThe nobles maintained their own army, which consisted of poor knights supported by peasants. They also are responsible for their armament. Among the equipment used by them was a wooden weapons (like spear), blunt weapons (like club), cutting weapons (like sword) and belching weapons (like crossbow, bow and arrow, sling), and the so-called protective equipment (shield, helmet, armor). These armies over time become larger than the princely one, the most notorious example from this was Sieciech. During the constant conflicts at the beginning of the 12th century, the nobles invoked the militia, particularly of endangered lands. The whole militia was divided into branches, which were given the names of their native districts (for example, the Kruszwiczan hordes). In the case of an armed conflict to a greater weapon are invoked independent branches composed by peasants (for example, during the Polish-German war of 1109).\n\nIn addition to the nobles (who were tied to the ruler and his court) and warriors the Polish society in Boleslaw's times also consisted of free peasants and servants (attached to his place of residence). A distinct social group were the free people, the so-called guests (Latin: hospites) -who do not own property-, the warriors (Latin: milites gregarii) who had farms and are counted into the common people. At the end of the social scale are the slaves (brancy of war, or their descendants). There are little difference between them and the free peasants, but their duty to their master was higher. Non-free population was also used for personal services or to work on the land in favor of the ruler.\n\nAll aspects of life in the State were regulated by the Ducal Judge (Latin: ius ducale). He covered all the rights of the Prince, in relation to the subjects or property, the enforcement of a variety of benefits, dues and ministries. The expanded state apparatus and the church maintained by benefits from the population producing material goods. The main burden of the tax rests on the lowest social class: the peasantry (Latin: heredes, rustici ducis, possesores). Up to them to submit certain levies, tithes, and other forms of taxes like the Podworowe (in the form of a cow, which consisted of the entire village), Podymne (for every house), Poradlne (for each piece of land), Narzazu (for grazing pigs in the woods), the Stacji or Stanu (who allow the maintenance of the Prince's court) and the poslug komunikacyjnych, who regulated the transport ways in the country and was divided in three main taxes: Przewod (\"the cable\"), Powoz (\"the carriage\") and Podwod (\"the wagon\"). Other minor taxes involved hunting, military, guards (who custodied the Grods), taxes on regalia and criminal penalties. In addition, subjects were required to repair roads, bridges, construction and maintenance of castles.\n\nSeals and Coinage\n\nOf the five oldest preserved seals from Polish rulers four were discovered in various places during the years 2002-2006, while one of more than 100 years ago. Polish archaeologists made further discoveries in Glebokie (2002), in Ostrow Tumski (2005), in Gniezno (2005) and in an undisclosed location in the village of Susk near Sierpc, 32 km. from Plock (2006). The first preliminary studies suggested that the seals could belonged to Boleslaw III Wrymouth. They are made of lead, a durable material, with a diameter of 36–40 mm. The lead seals are used at that time in European courts and are from the Bulla tipe. Seals are known in municipal and military orders. Occasionally, in the most important documents (acts) were used golden bullas.\n\nThe discovered bullas from Boleslaw's reign fall into two major types, differing in the form of writing:\n\nType I: extended stored on the obverse in the genitive, with the Latin word sigillum.\n\nType II: short and around the bulla.\n\nOne example from both type of seals came from the relationship with St. Adalbert, where he emphasizes his pontifical recognition (in type I) and in the crosier, with the gesture of the imposition of hands, clearly visible in the seals after restoration (in type II). The use of the genitive seals in Poland came from the 12th century, a phenomenon (unprecedented), with its only then monetary equivalent in the denarius with the Latin legend: Denarivs ducis Bolezlai. At the end of Boleslaw's reign returned to the staid mold inscriptions with the Latin legend: Dvx Bolezlavus. According to S. Suchodolski the bullas were used for the authentication of princely documents like letters, privileges, judgments, etc., and by T. Jurek, they could also be used to secure the business arrangements (like buy of doors, chests, reliquaries).\n\nIn October 2006, the Poznan Society of Friends of Learning has confirmed that the discovered bullas during 2002-2005 belonged to Boleslaw III Wrymouth.\n\nDuring Boleslaw's reign appeared a two-sided denarius, which was denominated the foreign coin (Polish: moneta obca). The first known denarius from this time bears the Latin legend Bolezlav. For the others most commonly used coins bears the Latin inscription Bolezlavs, denarivus, dicis Bolezlai with St. Adalbert in the reverse. Another type of coins didn't have legends. They differ mostly came from the weight: they were much lighter, punched for purely economic purposes.\n\nIn this time was also modeled mainly on the Magdeburg technique a bracteate, who was one of the oldest in Europe. There are two types of bracteates who dated from Boleslaw's reign:\n\nThe type II shows in both sides before Boleslaw and St. Adalbert, who put his hand over the ruler in a gesture of protection. The legend shows the Latin inscription Bolezlaus Adalbertus. This bracteate initially was considered a way of penance from Boleslaw for Zbigniew's blinding. Was probably minted in Krakow around 1127.\n\nThe type I is less frequent. Showed St. Adalbert in episcopal robes, holding a crozier and Gospel. Legend of the coin determines the form of the Archbishop of Gniezno. Further studies have shown that the coin was minted between the period of the Congress of Merseburg (1135) and Boleslaw's death (1138). It's now called the protective, since illustrates the protection of St. Adalbert to the Polish ruler, who after the his homage to the Holy Roman Empire in 1135 only recognizes the saint as his protector. It's one of the few examples of political propaganda in the coin's legend. According to A. Schmidt this was an Archbishop's coin which was minted in Gniezno, probably in 1135.\n\nIn addition to the two presented bracteates from Boleslaw's there is one, which is now counted among the oldest known in numismatics. This bracteate was found in Brzeg (in Gmina Peczniew) and preserved almost the 2/3 part of the whole weight of 0.61 g and a diameter of 27 mm. The coin shows the figure of the ruler with crown, sword in hand and an outstretched hand. Initially, was believed that showed Wladyslaw II the Exile. Further studies, included by A. Mikolajczyk, identified this image with Boleslaw III Wrymouth. Among researchers, however, today, there are discrepancies about what ruler showed the coin, because the inscription preserved is incomplete.\n\nPrincely mints are mostly located in Wroclaw, Plock, Gniezno and Krakow. In that time also existed private mints, such as Palatine Sieciech, who placed them in Sieciechow and near Krakow.\n\nChurch foundations\n\nIt was customary between the 12th century ruling families a wide-ranging religious activities like donations in the benefit of the Church. The main objective was to spread Christianity. This was to include show religious rulers in the face of God, church hierarchs, clergy and society. Boleslaw wasn't the exception, and he wasn't not only a predatory warrior, a cunning politician and a diplomat; he was also a patron of cultural developments in his realm.\n\nLike most medieval monarchs, he founded several churches and monasteries. Among the most important of which are:\n\nThe Benedictine monastery of Holy Cross atop the Lysa Gora which was founded in place of an ancient pagan temple. The first Abbot of this monastery, Boguchwal, wrote about the foundation and the prince:\n\nStored documents from about 1427 (called the swietokrzyskie dokumenty pergaminowe) confirm the history of the Bishop, adding that the co-founder of the monastery was the knight Wojslaw.\n\nThe St. Giles-Church in Inowlodz was built in the Romanesque style. According to a modern plate inscription (presumably from the 17th century) this temple was built in 1082 by Wladyslaw I Herman. However, modern research revealed that the foundation of the Church was probably during the 12th century (at the latest from 1138) and the founder was Boleslaw.\n\nThe Collegiate Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Ostrow Tumski was founded thanks to the donations of Haymo, Bishop of Wroclaw and comes Wojslaw in 1120, following the reports of the 15th century Rocznika glogowskiego. Modern scholars believed that the founder was Boleslaw (T. Lalik), or the foundation was made by Bishop Haymo and Wojslaw with the consent of the Prince (H. Gerlic) or was a foundation made by Bishop Haymo and Boleslaw (T. Jurek). In earlier studies of the history of Silesia existed the opinion that Boleslaw founded the Collegiate as a gesture of gratitude for the loyalty and bravery of the people of Glogow during the Polish-German War of 1109 and also a as a way of penance for Zbigniew's blinding.\n\nThe Benedictine Abbey in Tyniec according to some hypotheses was also founded by Boleslaw. In 1124 the Papal legate issued the confirmation of the goods received from the Abbey's estates.\n\nThe Abbey of Lubin was restored during 1137-1138 by Boleslaw and the Awdaniec family.\n\nThe Wawel Cathedral was completed during Boleslaw's reign. In 1118 Bishop Maurus was buried there.\n\nThe Canons regular of St. Augustine in Trzemeszno was probably founded by Boleslaw. Evidence of this was in a document issued by Mieszko III the Old in 1145.\n\nThe connection of Boleslaw and his second wife Salomea with the Swabian monastery of Zwiefalten was well-known. The detailed description of Berthold of Zwiefalten was the only evidence of the cultural, artistic and religious development of the 12th century Polish court:\n\nThe same source mentioned that the golden cross donated to the monastery was made by master Leopard, who worked for the Polish ruler during 1129-1137.\n\nThe Reliquary of 1113 is an example of the artistic development during Boleslaw's rule; was made during the penitential journey to the tomb of Saint Adalbert in Gniezno Cathedral after the blinding of Zbigniew, according to the reports the Gallus Anonymous:\n\nThe Reliquary contained the head of Saint Adalbert. At the end of the 15th century was melted in order to made a new one. According to the notes of 1494 had the form of octagonal shrine. The side walls have the shape of squares and were separated by small columns, which were based on the figures of saints or prophets. The monument was decorated with 8 pearls and 40 sapphires.\n\nPolish historiography during Boleslaw's reign\n\nDuring his rule, Boleslaw wanted the history of the Piast dynasty to be written. This task was assigned to an unnamed Benedictine monk (who previously was incorrectly named as Gallus Anonymous). Modern research, however, suggests that the monk was a Venetian."
