        "text": "In 1138 when Poland was partitioned into different principalities, which were granted to Boleslaw III's sons, Silesia fell to the oldest son Wladyslaw. As such he was also senior of Poland with control over the capitol Krakow and the region of Little Poland, but already in 1146 was he exiled from all his lands by his brother Boleslaw. Poland was however at that time a vassal state to Germany so the Holy Roman Emperor intervened in 1163 and placed Wladyslaw's three sons as dukes/princes of Silesia. The two oldest sons had many descendants who partitioned Silesia into numerous duchies. Because of space considerations are the dukes from the Upper Silesian branch of the dynasty listed on a separate page.\n\nMost dukes in Lower Silesia severed their ties with Poland 1329 and instead recognised Bohemia's supremacy, something the Upper Silesian dukes had done two years earlier. From 1335 was all of Silesia a part of the Bohemian crown but the Silesian dukes had considerable autonomy. Because the dukes encouraged German immigration became the Polish population to a large extent assimilated with the Germans and during the 14th century was Silesia practically a German speaking country. The last branch of the ruling house of Piast became extinct 1675 and thereafter was Silesia placed under direct rule by the Bohemian-Austrian regents. Most of Silesia was conquered by Prussia 1742, which then lost it to Poland after the World Wars.\n\nNote that only the duchies originated from the partitioning of Poland 1138 and ruled by members of the house of Piast are listed on these pages. The other Silesian duchies that existed were fiefs granted by the Bohemian kings (Troppau, Münsterberg-Öls and Jägerndorf for example) and these did not have the same degree of autonomy as the Piast duchies."
