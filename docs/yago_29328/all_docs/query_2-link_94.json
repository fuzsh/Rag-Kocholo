        "text": "Boleslaus III the Wrymouth (Boles≈Çaw III Krzywousty), (1086-1138) was duke of Poland from 1102. he was a son of son of Ladislaus Herman of Poland and Judith of Bohemia.\n\nHe defeated the Pomeranians at the battle of Naklo in 1109, and took control of Pomerania between 1119 and 1123, regaining Polish access to the sea. He also defeated Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1109, in the Battle of Hundsfeld.\n\nBoleslaus also campaigned in Hungary from 1132 to 1135, but to little effect.\n\nFirst he married Zbyslava of Kiev, daughter of Swiatopelk II grand duke of Kiev. They had one son:\n\nLadislaus (b. 1105), King of Poland\n\nSecond he married Salome von Berg-Schelklingen, with whom he had 14 children (6 sons + 8 daughters) from whom we know of 4 sons and 5 daughters:\n\nBoleslaus IV the Curly (b. 1125)\n\nMieszko III the Old (b. 1126)\n\nHenry of Sandomierz (b. 1127)\n\nCasimir the Just (b. 1138)\n\nRycheza of Poland (b. 12 April 1116), married to grandduke Volodar\n\nDobronega of Poland (b. 1128), married Markis Dietrich of Niederlausitz\n\nGertruda of Poland\n\nJudith of Poland (b. 1132), married Otto I of Brandenburg\n\nAgnes of Poland (b. 1137), married Mstislav II of Kiev\n\nBefore his death in 1138 he announced the testament (Boleslaw the Wrymouth's testament) dividing his land between four of his sons. The \"senioral principle\" established in the testament stated, that at every time the oldest member of the dynasty was to have a supreme power over the rest and also control an indivisible \"senioral part\" - a vast stripe of land running N-S through the middle of Poland, with Krakow as the main city. Senior's prerogatives included also control over Pomerania, which was a fief of the Empire. The principle was quickly broken, which began an almost 200 years period of feudal dissolution in Poland."
