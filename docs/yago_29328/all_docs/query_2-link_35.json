An al­ly of the San­do­mierz Duke Ka­zi­mierz II the Just. Since child­hood he had se­ri­ous health prob­lems, which made his life short. He died child­less at the age of about 23.\n\nKaz­imierz II the Just (1186-1194) - the young­est son of Bo­le­s³aw III and Sa­lo­mea of Berg. Duke of Wi­¶li­ca, San­do­mierz, Cra­cow, and from 1186 Ma­zo­via and Ku­ja­wy. As a young man, he stayed at the court of Fred­er­ick Bar­ba­ros­sa as a hos­tage of his broth­er's loy­al­ty to the em­per­or. He was re­gard­ed as an ex­cel­lent com­man­der and skill­ful politi­cian. Ka­zi­mierz had five sons and two daugh­ters. He died dur­ing a feast, drink­ing from a cup.\n\nKon­rad of Ma­zo­via (1194-1247) - son of Ka­zi­mierz II the Just and He­le­na. Duke of Less­er Poland, Ma­zo­via and Ku­ja­wy (un­til 1200 co-ruled with his broth­ers). He brought the Teu­ton­ic Knights to Poland. Kon­rad be­came known as a tyr­ant, for po­lit­i­cal pur­pos­es he re­peat­ed­ly kid­napped, im­pris­oned, maimed and killed. He mar­ried Aga­fia, a prin­cess of No­wo­gród-Sie­wierz. Ten chil­dren were born to him from this mar­riage: five daugh­ters and five sons.\n\nSiemow­it I of Ma­zovia (1247-1262) - son of Kon­rad of Ma­zo­via and Aga­fia. While Kon­rad was still alive, he be­came a cru­el ex­ecu­tor of his sen­tences (in­clud­ing the tor­ture and hang­ing of the P³ock schol­as­tic Jan Cza­pla). Sie­mow­it came in­to con­flict with his broth­er Ka­zi­mierz, as a re­sult of which he was im­pris­oned in the cas­tle of Sie­radz.

He had on­ly one daugh­ter.\n\nBoles³aw II of Ma­zovia (1275-1313) – Kon­rad's broth­er. He ruled in the Duchy of P³ock from 1275, and in the whole of Ma­zo­via from 1294. At the be­gin­ning of the 14th cen­tu­ry, he found­ed a cas­tle in War­saw. Bo­le­s³aw mar­ried twice: to Gau­de­mun­da of Lith­ua­nia, and to Ku­ne­gun­da, daugh­ter of the King of Bo­he­mia. From these mar­riages he had three sons and two daugh­ters.\n\nSiemow­it II of Rawa (1313-1345) - the el­dest son of Bo­les­³aw II and Gau­de­mun­da. The duke of War­saw and Liw, from 1313 the Duke of Ra­wa. Sie­mo­wit II made al­liances with Teu­ton­ic Knights, which made him a threat to Pol­ish Duke W³a­dy­s³aw £o­kie­tek.

He con­sid­ered him­self a vas­sal of Czech King Jan Luc­em­bur­ský, which was sup­posed to guar­an­tee him the ter­ri­to­ri­al in­tegri­ty of his duchy (lo­cat­ed be­tween two mighty coun­tries - Poland and Teu­ton­ic state).

The prince ac­cused An­na of mar­i­tal in­fi­deli­ty and had her stran­gled (his­tor­i­cal fact), and gave the al­leged bas­tard child (now a leg­end) to the vil­lagers to bring it up. This sto­ry is sup­posed to have in­spired Wil­liam Shake­speare, who used it in his dra­ma The Win­ter's Tale.\n\nSiemowit IV of P³ock (1381-1426) - son of Sie­mo­wit III and Eu­phe­mia of Opa­wa, can­di­date for the hus­band of Queen Jad­wi­ga and would-be king of Poland.

Dur­ing his reign in the duchy, he con­tin­ued its eco­nom­ic re­con­struc­tion, mod­ern­ized the law, and lo­cat­ed new towns. He mar­ried the Pol­ish king's sis­ter, Alek­san­dra Ol­gier­dów­na.

He was a can­di­date for the ti­tle of Grand Duke of Lith­ua­nia and for the Pol­ish throne (af­ter King Ja­gie³­³o's death). He was al­so in­volved in a fa­mous ar­gu­ment be­tween princes and bish­ops about who should take the place clos­est to King W³a­dy­s³aw III War­neñ­czyk dur­ing his coro­na­tion. Sie­mo­wit mar­ried the princess of Ra­ci­bórz, Ma³­go­rza­ta. He had one daugh­ter.\n\nW³adys³aw I of P³ock (b. 1442-1455) - broth­er of Sie­mo­wit V, po­lit­i­cal man, par­tic­i­pant of many al­liances, but gen­er­al­ly not fa­vor­able to Poland. He was mar­ried to An­na Ole¶­nic­ka and had two sons with her. He died of tu­ber­cu­lo­sis.\n\nAn­na of Ole¶ni­ca (1455-1476) - daugh­ter of the Sile­sian Duke Kon­rad V and W³a­dy­s³aw's wife.
