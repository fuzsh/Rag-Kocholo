It is the author’s behef that only within the larger framework of Russian artistic and cultural evolution can the contemporary scene, with its alter- nation of change and tradition in the dissolution and survival of literary schools, be fully understood. In this survey of novelists and poets I have followed the same method as in The Epic of Russian Literature: From Its Origins through Tolstoy (Oxford University Press, New York, 1950), of which this book is an organic sequel even though each volume can be read separately. I have endeavored to combine the aesthetic analysis of individual writers and the artistic currents they represent with the outline of their socio-political, psychological, and cultural background; I have continued to devote more attention than is customary m English studies of Russian letters to , poetry, to criticism, and to the philosopWcal, religious, and social debates that reflect the very essence of national spint and intellectual life. The importance of these ideological aspects is particularly apparent in Soviet prose and poetry, where extra-literary factors promote or destroy artistic currents and aspirations. It is a commonplace to say that writing about contemporary literature is an uncertain, arduous task; historians of literature, as is well known, feel much more at ease with the dead than with the living. A chronicler and critic of contempormy Russian letters is confronted with special dif- ficulties of a very peculiar kind. He is exposed to current political passions V VI FOREWORD and to politically motivated misreading by contending factions Even if he emerges unscathed from the political wrangle, he is still menaced by other pitfalls He has to plow through a staggering number of Soviet novels, poems, essays, articles, party resolutions, and oflScial commen- taries — a task far from entertaining, requiring a great deal of time and a special skill for catching hidden meanings behind the prmted word (Only a selection of the works consulted by the author is mentioned in the pres- ent work, lest the reader be crushed under the avalanche of unfamiliar names and titles ) And, finally, he has to determine, if he can, to what extent literary expression has been occasioned by the pressures of the Communist Party and Soviet State. Since the latter has devised, at vanous moments during the last thirty-five years, different ways of controlling the arts and using them as a weapon on both the domestic and the interna- tional front, many phenomena of Soviet literary life have no counterparts in Europe and America, and are likely to remain puzzling. In the maze of political tactics and dramatic changes in Russian life, Soviet criticism is hardly ever enlightening. It is highly significant that, except for a few evasive and pedestrian chapters in some textbooks, not a single general survey of post-Revolutionary literature has been pub- lished in the USSR Communist literary policy apparently underwent so many violent shifts of taste that nobody has dared to write a history of Soviet literature. Such an enterprise is conceivable only outside of the Soviet Union. The fragments of c9*Stelnp*orary criticism that are available in Soviet books and essays preset a disheartening example of falsified perspective, biased exaggeration, be rearrangement of history Facts are discarded, writers or single works omitted, names excluded — ^all to make literary his- tory fit into the latest pattern of Communist exegetics After each purge or shift in party strategy titles and names disappear from the Soviet canon, and no factual material on the life and death of recent victims can be found in Moscow publications Because of this lack of information the author has had to revert to sources outside of the USSR; he has been very cautious, however, in using various data at his disposal. In many in- stances he has been able to recheck by personal contact — during the last three decades — ^with a number of contemporary Russian writers, from Bunin to Remizov, from Essenin to 'Tsvetayeva, from Zamiatin to A. Tolstoy. The author has tried to remain objective to the best of his ability. He has endeavored to present and to describe rather than to formulate final judgment. This does not prevent him from holding his own point of view, from being firmly opposed to both Communist and Marxian aesthetics. FOREWORD VII and from personally rejecting any form of totalitarian ideocracy that en- tails the negation of intellectual and artistic freedom. I hereby extend my thanks to Bernard G. Guemey for his aid in the revision of the text, and to Mrs Ruth Matthewson and the editorial staff of the Oxford University Press for their assistance in editing the manu- script.

The emancipation of the Russian serfs in 1861 and the subsequent reforms in the administrative, judicial, military, and educational branches of the government marked the rise of a new world. Modem Russia began in this era, and all the problems, drives, and aspirations that shaped ite course for decades to come stemmed from the great change the Empire had undergone in the ’sixties. The tremendous impact of this transitional period is analogous to that of the years immediately following the American civil war. During the reign of Alexander II ( 1 855-8 1 ) new political and social, artistic and intellectual patterns were established; the technical and eco- nomic expansion of the ’sixties and ’seventies opened the way for the development of capitalism; and a new generation of builders and revolu- tionaries displayed their energy and enthusiasm in many different fields. At every level of society there was a cultural quickening. The eager- ness for learning and for action, the desire for self-improvement, die in- creased pace of Westernization, the new trends in science and literature — all seemed to justify the most opffmistic outlook. The remnants of feudal slavocracy, however, were far from uprooted, and the living stainiards cff the masses were incredibly low; the peasants were burdened by taxes and payments for their land-allotments — the price oi their emamt^tirm-— and were tnmted as third-class citizens; ' 3 ' , 4 MODERN RUSSUN LITERATURE caste distinctions were strictly maintained; the government remained auto- cratic, political freedom was still forbidden, and coercion, abuse of office, and authoritarianism characterized Russian admmistration The dreams of educated society went unrealized when the Czar and his mirasters refused to crown the reforms with a liberal constitution In the mid-sixties it be- came obvious that the brave hopes of the intelligentsia were without foun- dation, and the frustrated and discontented mtellectuals mmced no words in their cnticxsm of the regime. The government, impressed by the growth of the opposition, alternated concessions with repressive measures Bu- reaucracy, red tape, pohce reprisals, and arrests of popular writers aU served to exasperate the younger element, which became turbulent and aggressive. In 1866 Karakozov, a university student, attempted to shoot the Emperor and was duly executed This attempt, so indicative of the rismg revolutionary tide, also served to intensify the forces of reaction. Between 1866 and 1872 socialist ideas made considerable headway, especially among university students and the Raznochintsi (mtellectuals from the clergy, peasantry, and the middle class). All the leading critics and sociologists of the penod — Herzen, Chemyshevsky, Pisarev, Lavrov, Bakunin — and a number of mmor journalists espoused the cause of socialism; others were only friendly to socialist doctrine After 1861 many Russian men and women went to foreign umversities. In Paris and Geneva, in Heidelberg and Bonn, they met imigres who had fled from Siberia or had simply gone abroad to escape the clutches of the Imperial Police. These associations led to the formation all over Europe of hundreds of intellectual circles where young Russians listened avidly to lectures on social conditions and discussed the future of their country. A number of them organized printing plants and smuggled books and tracts into Rus- sia. Those returning home concealed quantities of subversive literature in false-bottomed trunks or other ingenious hiding places. Socialist propa- ganda soon assumed vast proportions and by the beginning of the ’seventies two prominent emigres, Lavrov and Bakunin, were heading the most important factions of the new movement. Peter Eavrov (1823-1900) was forty-five when, in 1868, under the pen name of Mirtov, he began to publish his Historical Letters, as a serial in a monthly magazine. The following year, when they were pubhshed in book form, the Letters were ordered suppressed, but the police could not find a sm^e copy in bookstores: they all had been sold. The author, who was a colonel and a Professor of Philosophy at the Artillery School in St. Petersburg, was arrested and banished to Siberia. Shortly afterward he escaped and went to Paris, where he remained until his death. Scientist and revolutionary, Lavrov published numerous books (in- duding the bulky Essay on History of Thought, which contained the out- THE POPULIST MOVEMENT 5 line of his doctrine of anthropologism), and directed various radical pub- lications. The success of his Letters was the sign of a new era. It marked the passing from Nihilism, with its emphasis on the natural sciences, to Populism, with its mam mterest in social problems. According to Lavrov, aU cultural progress was made possible by the millions who sweated and toiled, thus gaining for a privileged minority the opportunity for observation, study, and creativeness. His appeal, ad- dressed to the youth of the educated classes, contended that they were indebted to the people for their artistic and intellectual pleasures. The happy few could cultivate the precious flowers of philosophy, literature, and the emotions of refined love because the unhappy majority was com- pelled to crush rocks, lay roads, dig tunnels, till the land, and mine coal. Their anonymous labor made possible the erection of magnificent tem- ples of learning and beauty, yet access to these was denied to the poverty- stricken and ignorant masses. Whoever realized that this was the price of culture should pay his debt to the people by working for their educa- tion and emancipation. A new regime must be established that would put an end to oppression, exploitation, and social injustice, and make culture universal and available to all. Lavrov believed that the social revolution which would create such a regime would be brought about by the work- ing masses, but he insisted on the necessity of first awakening their dormant conscience and acquainting them with their true interests. This was the task assigned to the mtellectuals: ‘go to the people’ and spread the truth among peasants and workers. In the early ’seventies Lavrov had scorned democratic reforms as of secondary importance: Why trim the twi^, asked his disciples, when the axe of revolution can fell the tree itself? It was not worth while expend- ing time and energy in promulgating constitutionality and liberty in Rus- sia when social revolution could take care of all such issues. Lavrov told his followers not to worry if there were but ten of them today: there would be a hundred tomorrow and a thousand within a month. Social revolution could be achieved through propaganda among the people, be- cause the Russian peasant had ‘unconscious socialistic leanings,’ as mani- fested in the mir (or rural commune), the artel (artisans’ co-operative), and in the independent spirit of the religious sects. Here Lavrov’s Populism joined hands with Herzen’s revolutionary messianism. Rejecting fatalism or determinism, whether religious or scientific, Lavrov emphasized the creative role of the individual in history, and addressed himself to the moral sense of his contemporaries. Although later he came to share many ideas of economic socialism as formulated by Marx, he never accepted the Marxian interpretation of historical processes. The class struggle, economic conflicts, tihe clash of the oppos- 6 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE ing interests of the haves and the have-nots are evidently of great im- portance, Lavrov declares, but we must also take into consideration other factors of human life and psychology The future regime is not merely a matter of economic necessity but also one of moral justification Sociahsm must be based on ethical grounds and serve the cause of freedom, justice, fraternity, and ‘the harmonious development of the individual.’ It has to be reached through a revolution, smce the rulmg classes would never sur- render their power without a struggle: this belief m the inevitabihty of the ‘supreme battle’ made Lavrov call himself a sociahst-revolutionary, and he thus initiated one of the most important political movements in Russia. The Lavrovists, aroused by their master’s individualistic ethical ideas, set themselves the task of enhghtening the people by means of mass edu- cation. These were the tactics so sharply criticized by the disciples of Bakunin ^ Michael Bakunin (1814-76), one of the founders of international anarchism, had taken part in the European revolution of 1848, and had been imprisoned and eventually extradited by the Austrian government. Brought back to Russia, he was chained to the wall of a cell in the Fortress of SS Peter and Paul, but later gained some mitigabon of this treatment by ‘confessing’ his errors in a long document, obviously in- tended for the Emperor Nicholas I. Finally deported to Siberia, he made an adventurous escape in 1861, crossed the Pacific and the Atlantic, and returned to Europe, where for fifteen years he agitated, fomented strikes, provoked uprisings, and participated in aU sorts of conspiracies. The rival and enemy of Marx, he established militant workers’ groups and revolutionary societies throughout the Continent (particularly in Latin and Slav countries), and practically undermined the First Socialist International. Adored by his followers and hated by his opponents, this formidable man, who firmly believed in the imminence of world revolu- tion and displayed irresistible energy m preparmg for it, was the first Russian revolutionary to play a leading role in the European labor move- ment Even more than Lavrov, he despised the petty game of politics and denied the importance of democratic institutions for the total emancipa- tion of the working classes. He endorsed Proudhon’s statement that uni- versal suffrage is counter-revolution, and saw but two opposing forces: the State, which he identified with coercion, injustice, exploitation, and falsehood (in which he included State Religion as the greatest falsehood of all), and Revolution, which to him meant liberty, complete emancipa- tion of the mdividual, and a socialistic organization of economy based on autonomous self-governing labor unions. , * See yol. i, cfa. $, 7. THE POPULIST MOVEMENT 7 Despite Herzen’s warnings Bakunin clung to the formula he had an- nounced in the ’forties: The lust for destruction is a creative lust; the old world has to be demolished before the building of any new order can be- gm Bakunin therefore considered a waste of time any activity that was not strictly revolutionary, while democracy he regarded as an utter sham, as sheer nonsense To encourage the revolutionary movement in Russia he recommended an immediate appeal to the insurrectionary impulse of the masses and a resort to direct action. ‘Go to the people’ was his slogan, too, yet he urged his followers not to trust the Lavrovist methods of slow, planned propaganda, but rather to adopt the tac- tics that would brmg out the Russian peasants’ inherent desire for rebel- lion The teachings of Lavrov and Bakunin went straight to the hearts of Russian intellectuals. In Western Europe, during the same period (the late ’sixties and early ’seventies), socialistic ideas held an appeal for only a small fraction of cultivated society, but m Russia they became the gos- pel to a large majority of the intellectuals. Among university students and, in general, among those under thirty, socialism grew to be a sort of unofficial religion. The slogan ‘Go to the people’ found an enthusiastic response: the people, their sufferings, their future, and their education constituted the focal problem of the period. Among the upper classes the desire to help the underprivileged was combined not only with compassion but also with a sense of guilt which gnawed at the conscience of the repentant noblemen. Ashamed of their social status and their economic security, they yearned to atone for ail their advantages of birth and education and strove to turn their backs on the class to which they belonged As a matter of fact, most Russian social reformers, from Pestel to Leo Tolstoy, and most revolutionaries, from Bakunin to Lenin, were well born. For most of them, this disposi- tion toward social atonement was coupled with the longing for a ‘clean’ life. The men and women of the ’seventies pursued sacrifice with an almost masochistic eagerness, and their political activity bore all the stigmata of a psychological complex. They created a myth. Many young radicals, whether followers of Lavrov or of Bakunin, idealized the muzhik, that lofty symbol of kindliriess, wisdom, and patience; they were con- vinced that the people were ready to join in their socialistic strivings and to support their revolutionary dreams. ‘Service for the people’ had the sound of an incantation on the lips of a repentmit nobleman; it had a more realistic ring whmi used by the Raznochintei, with whiaa the nobly bom idealists were constantly min- gling, The diffeareoces in backgrou:^ and psycholo^cal motivations did not prevent the two groups from johwg forces in what they considered 8 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE the supreme expression of social consciousness by ‘going to the peo- ple’ they hoped to bridge the gap between educated society and the workmg masses, and thus correct the fundamental evil of Russian his- tory. In this the Populists were striving to realize the dream of the Slavo- philes. During the ’thirties and ’forties, however, the unage of the people was somewhat theoretical, and it remained part of a vast utopian scheme engendered by the awakening of national consciousness. The Populists cherished utopian illusions about the people which led to tragic results, but as men of action they began to carry out their program. And their ‘discovery’ of the people, their meeting the muzhik face to face, became the most important event in the evolution of the Russian educated classes For the first time the issue of the relation between the two elements of the nation — the educated ehte and the large masses of toilers, the division of which had been sharpened by the reforms of Peter the Great and the sub- sequent St Petersburg period of the monarchy — was raised not as an ab- stract problem but as a concrete proposition. This was the true historical significance of the Populist movement. n The freedom and happiness of the people, for which the idealists were ready to devote their lives, were passionately discussed m clandestine circles. Thousands of young men and women in various parts of the country spontaneously arrived at the same decisions: they wanted to ‘go to the people,’ to share their existence of toil and deprivation; they wanted to bring to the peasant and to some extent to the worker the enlightenment of socialistic propaganda. Theo- retical speculations soon led to practical conclusions, and thus began a movement which rapidly assumed the nature of a true crusade. The ‘mania’ overwhelmed even many who were mature and held important positions: magistrates, government ojfficials, army officers, physicians, teachers- The summer of 1873 marked the great trek led by a few scions of the aristocracy. Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921), whose family claimed more right than the Romanovs to the throne of Russia, worked as a house painter in the suburbs of the northern capital; Sophie Perovskaya, daugh- ter of the military governor of St. Petersburg, went to work at a cheese maker’s; Catherine Breshkovskaya, who was later to earn the title of the Grandmother of the Russian Revolution, Lisogub the millionaire, whose tragic fate was described by Leo Tolstoy in Divine and Human, and thou- sands of others went to live with the peasants in their godforsaken vil- lages. But the results of this collective sacrifice seemed meager enought The efforts of the Populists were scattered, no contacts had been made THE POPULIST MOVEMENT 9 between the spontaneous crusaders, and the people remained cool and in many instances actually hostile to their preaching. The Czarist police adopted all sorts of repressive measures against the Populists By 1875 the futility of this first wave became obvious, since the failure was attributed mainly to administrative reprisals and lack of organization, the Populists decided to unite their forces and to estab- lish a rudimentary pohtical party Its name, Land and Freedom, was also their favorite slogan. The aim of the various groups that formed the party remained the same: ‘Social revolution prepared by propaganda’ — but its members, now numbering several thousand active militants, their ranks swelled by numerous sympathizers, had already begun dis- cussing the problems of political democracy as a necessary prerequisite for the success of socialism m Russia. The new party was decidedly more revolutionary than the pioneer- ing Populists The Land and Freedom party established not only secret printing plants and various executive agencies, but also special detach- ments whose specific task it was to organize escapes of political prisoners from Siberia and elsewhere, or to carry out dangerous missions, such as those of ‘defense’ and counter-espionage. A central committee directed the activity of all these sections, and also organized mass demonstrations in the streets of the capital to bring to the notice of the public the sufferings of the people. In 1875 the central committee gave the signal for a new crusade' Populists again made their way to the villages and to the fac- tories. Despite new methods and the moral support of public opmion, the second wave also fell short of expectations. Government counter- measures thwarted many excellent plans. Durmg the six years of the Pop- ulist movement more than seventeen thousand persons were imprisoned or banished by the authorities, and the leaders of the Land and Freedom party felt the need to revise their tactics. Violent disputes were already en- dangering the unity of the organization. The Bakuninists urged still more vehemently a shift to direct action and some of them actually organized an uprising in the Ukraine. The newly formed circles of Marxists (Capital was published in Russia in 1872) recommended an intensification of propaganda among factory workers (the pioneer labor organizations, such as the Northern and the Southern Unions joined the party), while some Jacobins, such as Peter Tkachev (1844-85), claimed that autocracy, devoid of any real social foundations, was in an indefensible position and that a resolute group of revolutionaries could seiz^ power and then promulgate reforms from above. In general, by 1876 the idealistic propa- gandists were being supplanted by more aggressive individuals, who were 10 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE The government retaliated by ordering court-martial for all ‘political criminals,’ and by creating the notorious Okhrana, or Security Section, a secret police force with unlimited funds and wide powers The Okhrana had virtual control over the country. All these measures, however, instead of frightening the Populists, merely embittered them and increased their terroristic tendencies As a matter of fact, the events of 1875-9 forced the Populists to admit that autocracy constituted their immediate and primary enemy, and that no social revolution was possible in Russia unless the Czarist regime were overthrown. Thus the struggle for political freedom, which Lavrov was inclined to disregard and which Bakumn rejected with contempt, was im- posed upon the Populists by the logic of events They now spoke of po- litical revolution and democratic freedoms as constituting but one mile- stone on the road toward socialism. It is most important to see that democracy as a political regime was accepted by the Populists not as an end but only as a means for attain- ing a still higher form of social equity They were ready to fight for de- mocracy in so far as it facilitated the achievement of their socialistic ideals While in other countries the struggle for political democracy had been led and supported by the third estate, the bourgeoisie, in Russia it was the socialists who had been compelled, really against their will, to wage the political battle. Furthermore, when they finally became convinced of the necessity of taking on what was really the task of the bourgeoisie, they had to resort to force and revolutionary tactics. In 1879 the clash between the Economist faction and the partisans of a struggle for political reforms came out into the open at the under- ground convention of Populist leaders. The meeting ended in a schism. The orthodox Populists formed the short-lived group known as the Black Division, with most of its members, such as V. Plekhanov, V. Zassulich, L. Deutsch, and others faithful to the dogma of ‘pure’ socialism, subse- quently joining the Marxists. They contended that people’s rights, po- litical liberty, universal suffrage, and so forth, were of no immediate im- portance, and that the socialists who were fighting for democratic free- dom were merely playing into the hand of the bourgeoisie, since the latter would profit from a democratic regime, largely at the expense of the work- ing masses. Their opponents led by Andrei Zheliabov, Alexander Mik- hailov, Nicholas Morozov, and others, formed the famous Party of the People’s Will, which was destined to give its name to a whole era of Rus- sian history. They affirmed that the leadership of the socialists in the poEtical struggle in Russia was bound to have significant results. So long ^ sociaHsts^ backed by the working masses, directed the fight for freedom, fee downfall autocracy was inevitable, and this would immMiately THE POPULIST MOVEMENT 11 Open the way for vast social reforms, chief among which must be a so- cialist land reform. The main innovation, however, was m tactics. The Populists decided to initiate ‘destructive and terroristic activities’ which would suppress the most obnoxious among the ruling clique, defend the party against spies, and punish oflSicials guilty of special violence and abuses These activities were designed to awaken the revolutionary spirit m the people by undermining their faith in the Imperial power and by offering con- tinued evidence that opposition to the government was possible. However this phenomenon is interpreted — and some historians claim it reflects the very essence of the ‘Russian mentality’ — the Party of the People’s Will (as well as other Russian revolutionary parties, including the Bolsheviks) was more akin to some sort of priestly order than to a political organization in the Western sense. Russians brought to their political struggle a religiosity, an all-embrac- ing spirit of total and self-annihilating devotion, an enthusiastic sharing of a doctrme, extremism m action, and often a Byzantine rigidity of thought and ritual unknown to Western tradition. The problem of ter- rorism represented for the Populists no mere question of political oppor- tunity; it was, first and foremost, a moral issue that caused poignant psychological conflbtcts. Each terrorist had to pass through a painful crisis before making his final decision. Most of the members of the party felt that their right to kill was won by their readmess to die. To become a terrorist signified a moral and physical sacrifice: they had to overcome all doubts, to conquer fear and pity, to renounce family, love, security, to bend all their will and thought toward a single sinister end; they had to lead the life of hunted animals, persecuted by a powerful enemy and facing untold dangers. Their socialist fervor had a strong religious tinge, but the historians of this most heroic period of the Russian Revolution have failed to stress the fact that these idealistic devotees of terror also possessed a keen practical sense. As a matter of fact, despite their limited means and all the obstacles they had to overcome, they succeeded in forming a vast and complicated organization which included printing plants, workshops for the fabrication of explosives, special meeting places, codes, surveillance agencies, forged-passport bureaus, and so on. In Au- gust 1879, the executive committee pronounced sentence of death on Emperor Alexander 11, and from that moment all its efforts were directed toward one goal: the ‘liquidation’ of the Czar. Between 1879 and 1881 several attempts on his life took place: mines exploded under the wheels of Imperial trains, delayed-action bombs yiasted the Imperial dining room in the Winter Palace. At the same time a numter of ^Vemment officials were shot or knifrf. Despite the mo- 12 MODERN RUSSUN LITERATURE bilization of all the forces of the state and gigantic police operations that resulted in thousands of arrests and deportations and several executions, the invisible committee contmued its fanatical warfare against the regime Czar Alexander II, who felt like a hunted beast and who changed his bedroom every night, alternated between reprisals and the preparation of reforms. After the explosion m the Winter Palace he granted dictatorial powers to General Loris-Melikov, who worked out a project of constitu- tional changes but, at the same time, contmued to suppress the socialists with an iron hand On 1 March 1881, the Emperor, while riding through the streets of St. Petersburg, was killed by bombs thrown by the terrorists. This supreme deed proved their undomg Of the thirty-six imtial mem- bers of the committee, five, mcludmg Andrei Zheliabov and Sophie Perovskaya, were hanged despite the appeals for mercy addressed to the new Czar by Leo Tolstoy and Vladimir Solovyov,^ the philosopher; one was driven insane, twelve died in prison, while the rest (with the excep- tion of three who had escaped abroad) were sentenced to hard labor m Siberia. Ill The assassination of the Emperor proved to be a Pyrrhic victory for the revolutionists It did not fulfil their expectations' the masses remained unstirred, the regime remamed un- compromising. The new sovereign, Alexander III, after briefly hesitat- ing between Loris-Melikov, who was proposing a moderate attitude, and Pobyedonostzev, the leader of the die-hard conservatives, decided to fol- low the latter’s advice and to extirpate the ‘subversive elements’ with fire and sword. Two months after the death of his father, Alexander III made it known that he would rule over Russia ‘with faith in the strength and truth of autocracy,’ An oppressive reaction set in throughout the country The supporters of the regime rallied all their forces and launched a counter- offensive against the socialists and liberals. Their leader, Konstantin Pobyedonostzev (1827-1907), the head of the Holy Synod and therefore of the Church, concealed his cold cymcism and his lust for power under a mask of Christian humility. Erudite and highly intelligent, he held knowledge and intellectuality m contempt. Like Dostoevsky’s Grand In- quisitor, for whom he probably served as a model, he was convinced that men are cornqit, rebellious, capable of all evil, and that culture and reason are of no avail. He preferred to back the ‘forces of inertia,’ and to preserve the status quo through repression and fear. According to Pobyedonostzev, whose subtle mind had a Jesuitic twist enhanced by Byzantine formalism, the Russians were innately rebels and tronblemakers; the peril of revolution was therefore real and great, un- * iSee ch. 6. ■ THE POPULIST MOVEMENT 13 less the combined authority of Church and State could rule both soul and body To control education, Pobyedonostzev estabhshed a network of parochial schools in the villages, with the catechism as the basic study, while Count Dmitri Tolstoy, appointed Minister of Public Instruction because he was a known enemy of science, decided to fight subversive ideas in secondary schools by establishing a fixed curriculum with Latin and Greek predominating, and by severe censorship. His successor, Delianov, made himself notorious by ordermg the gymmsias, in 1887, not to enroll the ‘sons of coachmen, servants, laundresses, petty grocers, cooks’ and so on; unless they were exceptionally gifted, the leader of the Russian educational system explained, ‘they ought to remain where they belong.’ In 1884 the universities were deprived of all academic freedom and scores of professors were dismissed, while special measures were taken to discourage higher education for women. The internal policy of the government was openly inspired by the support of the landed gentry, who were granted financial assistance, while at the same time special rural police officers, recruited from the nobility and vested with broad administrative powers, were flogging the recalci- trant peasants In a monument put up in St Petersburg the sculptor Prince Paolo Trubetzkoy represented Alexander III as a clumsy giant whose weight so overburdens his steed that it cannot move. After the October Revolution the Bolsheviks decided to preserve this monument as a symbol of the reign that had crushed the whole country. The atmosphere of the ’eighties was as stifling and oppressive as the air in the small, low-ceilinged rooms of the Imperial dwellmg at Gatchina, where Alexander III and his family led the Me of the typical petty bourgeois Moral prostration and apathy pervaded educated society; Russia seemed to have resigned itself to the rule of a narrow-minded bureaucracy, to conformism, to mediocrity. At the same time the decade of 1880-90 was decisive in the economic development of the country. The peasants continued to fare badly. Of nine million peasant households, two and a half million did not possess so much as a horse. A great many of the poorer peasants were slaving as farm hands at very low wages, or struggling on their tiny holdings. The agrarian crisis was aggravated by the drop of prices on the world wheat market, and the low level of husbandry turned droughts or poor crops into catastrophes for vast regions. In 1891-2 a famine spread over an area with thirty-five million inhabitants. Hundreds of thousands of peasants perished from starvation and epidemics of typhus and cholera. The hardships in the villages compelled the have-nots to flee to tpwns, and the industrial labor of the period was drafted almost entirely from the poorest elements of the peasantry. On the other hand, the industrial out- 14 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE put of Russia increased steadily, and by 1887 had reached the volume of one and a half billion gold rubles, the railroads underwent vast expan- sion, and the textile, steel, and coal industries made enormous progress. While these developments brought about revisions in socialistic and hberal doctrines, they were also not without influence upon the mon- archist ideology The die-hards listened to Prince Vassily Meshchersky (1839-1914), editor of The Citizen and author of various pohtical essays, whose ‘Speeches of a Conservative’ and ‘The Evidence agamst the Times’ (1879) were as widely read in high society as were his novels, wherein he cancatured the revolutionaries (particularly in Mysteries of Contemporary St. Petersburg, 1876-7). Those who looked for a more original approach turned to Konstantm Leontiev (1831-91). A land- owner who had given up a brilliant diplomatic career for monastic se- clusion (after many tribulations he finished his life as Father Kliment in an Orthodox monastery), Leontiev wrote novels, stories, and essays, both pohtical and literary (among the latter are penetrating articles on Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in which he displayed an uncommon artistic sense). Toward the end of the ’seventies he formulated his religious and political opinions in a two-volume collection. The Orient, Russia, and Slavdom He had a consistent philosophy, a blend of aestheticism, re- ligion, and science. ‘Mysticism is only for the faithful,’ he used to say; ‘ethics and politics for men; biology only for the orgamc world; but physics and aesthetics apply to all men and all things.’ His contemporaries underestimated him as a religious thinker, since they were chiefly im- pressed with his frank approval of reaction and his ‘voluptuous cult of flogging.’ Leontiev, who loved his ancestral estate as much as Leo Tolstoy did his, and who worshipped whatever reminded him of the ‘good old times of serfdom,’ sincerely hated anything that might threaten his way of life as a wealthy squire, whether that threat came from the ‘disgusting Nihilists,’ whom he wanted flogged, women as well as men, or from the ‘contemptible bourgeoisie.’ Democracy and freedom he considered consequences of the ‘general dfeintegration engendered by the French Revolution,’ which had brou^t the Third Estate to the fore. Leontiev warned autocracy against the danger of making concessions to the middle class and the bourgeoisie. As for thd common folk, he recommended ‘fear, as a foundation of wis- dom.’ In his essay, ‘The Principles of Byzantium and Slavdom’ (1875), he contended that ‘a firm monarchical power, strict to the verge of ferocity, and an authoritarian Church are the only elements capable of maintain- ing the oiltural , structure of a nation.’ He recommended that Russiap so- dtoy bei, as itwerei ccmgealed or oystallized, so as to pres^e its idiosyn- cr^ies. A believe in Russia’s mission in the Orient and among the THE POPULIST MOVEMENT 15 Slavs of the Balkans, Leontiev was inclined toward anti-Western isola- tionism: ‘Instead of dancmg,’ he wrote, ‘we ought to pray; but if we stiU want to dance, let us dance in our own way.’ Another leader of Slavophiles and nationahsts m the ’eighties was Nicholas Danilevsky (1822-95), a historian and naturahst Firmly op- posed to Darwin’s theory of evolution, he believed m immutable proto- types of species and also sought such prototypes m history He discerned ten cultural types: Hindu, Iranian, Hebrew, Greek, Arabian, Latin- Germanic, and so on Russia and Slavdom were one of the types, but he was dubious whether North America would be able to produce any. His analysis of the historical process included four areas of activity, in which the ori^nality of each type was manifested: religion, culture proper (science, the arts, industry, crafts), politics, and socio-economics. While some peoples concentrated in but one field (Jews in religion, for ex- ample), Russia was destined to attain high objectives in all the four fields of human endeavor. The development of Russia and Slavdom as special historical categones presented, in Danilevsky’s opimon, a su- perior degree of fulfilment and mtegration. Danilevsky’s practical conclusions were paradoxical and anti-liberal. He saw the essence of the Russian people in absolutism, and identified the originality of the Russian cultural type with the immutability of the Empire’s political regime Capitalism suited Europe but was alien and even hostile to the spuit of Russia and Slavdom. ITbe dealings of Russia with the West had, therefore, to be based on cold calculation and oppor- tunism: all international problems ought to be considered by the Rus- sians solely in the light of their own national interests. In keeping with this point of view, Russia could gain nothing from supporting any balance of power in Europe; Russia’s chief aim was the union of all the Slavs with Constantinople as their capital ‘The idea of Slavdom must be the supreme idea, above freedom, science, or enlightenment,’ he wrote. Dostoevsky, and Solovyov after him, criticized this new brand of Pan- Slavism, which led to national smugness and cultural isolationism Dan- ilevsky’s magnum opus, Russia and Europe (published in 1871, with second and third printings in 1888 and 1889), gained a wide audience after the death of its author; it was translated into German after the 1917 Revolution and exerted a strong influence on Oswald Spengler, who adopted many of Danilevsky’s ideas on cultural types and the cyclic process of history. Danilevsky’s Russian disciples — Konstantin Bestuz- hev-Riumin and Nicholas Strakhov, a well-known literary critic — added little to the theories of their master. Tte oiBSdal tendency of the reigp of Alexander HI was blatantly nationalistic. The Czar loved to be tailed a ‘fundamentally Russian and 16 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE Orthodox ruler.’ The Russian Style, which was an ugly conglomerate of pseudo-folk art and ornamentation, was proclaimed the Style of the Empire. Militant nationalism was called upon to construct a barrier against subversive Western ideas Michael Katkov, the watchdog of autocracy and editor of the Moscow Gazette, and the St Petersburg daily, The New Times, waged vociferous propaganda for ‘Russism’ and adopted the slogan ‘Russia for the Russians.’ In practice this meant boast- ing of successes in international politics (since the ’eighties Russia had outdistanced England m Asia, had consolidated its positions m the Balkans despite the tension with Austna, had begun a rapprochement with France, and was gaining foreign markets), and a forced Russification of the vari- ous peoples and nationalities that formed the Empire. This policy was applied not only to the vast regions of Central Asia, where Kokand, Khiva, Bokhara, and Turkmenia became Russian provinces, but to all other parts of the country The ban on publishing books in Ukrainian was reinforced. National languages were prohibited m Byelorussia and Lithu- ania, and ignorant administrators tried to stamp out the spirit of inde- pendence in Poland. Non-Orthodox Christians as well as Mohammedans were treated as aliens and conversion to Orthodoxy was imposed upon the native tribes of Siberia and Central Asia. Jews particularly were affected by this policy of aggressive national- ism: anti-Semitism was part and parcel of the official program. Jews were not allowed to live or travel outside a restricted area — the Jewish Pale, which formed a sort of gigantic ghetto in the southwest of the Empire. They had no right to buy land or settle down as farmers; a numerus clausus restricted their enrollment in schools and universities; they were excluded from all state posts and the navy, and were accepted in the army only as conscripted privates. Their rights were curtailed in trade and the professions, and the government advised local authorities to take ‘special protective measures against the pernicious activities of the Jews,’ In 1881-2, to create a diversion from revolutionary troubles and to offer an outlet to the discontent of the lower classes, the Czarist admin- istration provoked pogroms against the Jews in Southern Russia. When General Gurko reported this to the Czar, Alexander III answered ‘Speak- ing frankly, I am pleased when the Yids get beaten.’ The Jews became the scapegoats of the regime; ‘Freemasons and Jews are fomenting all the trouble in the country,’ proclaimed the chauvinist newspapers. Official imperialism had borrowed part of its terminology from the Slavophiles, whose right wing was gradually incorporated into various monarchistic groups. After the death, in 1881, of Dostoevsky, the last original thinker of Slavophilism, the reactionary doctrine of the three sacred principles of Autocracy, Orthodoxy, and Nationalism was de- THE POPULIST MOVEMENT 17 veloped, under Alexander III, into a state ideology. It soon became viti- ated by all the evils the great leaders of liberal Slavophilism had denounced with disgust nationalistic vainglory, contempt of Europe, blatant boast- ing, pohtical provincialism, and cultural isolationism. These are recurrent whenever Russia suffers from fits of nationalism. After the war against the Turks in 1877-8, when the Empire acted as a champion of the Slavs and Russian soldiers displayed remarkable stam- ina and courage on the shores of the Danube and m the mountain passes of Shipka, the liberal Slavophiles, led by the venerable Ivan Aksakov, showed signs of a political Indian summer They had been bitterly disap- pointed by the Congress of Berlin, at which Bismarck, Germany's Iron Chancellor, and the British diplomats had outwitted Russia, compelling her to grant substantial concessions in the Near East This outcome of the war for the liberation of Balkan Slavs again threw the Slavophiles into the ranks of the opposition. Without ever becoming an organized body they were fairly influential among the educated nobility, which charged the government with enslavmg the Church and treating the people bru- tally. Subsequently many of the Slavophiles served as links between the government and the mild opposition, and tried to unite the Bureaucratic Left with the Liberal Right In 1905 most of them joined the party of the Octobrists; in the ’eighties, however, they remained relatively passive. The Westemizers of the liberal stamp did not fare much better: the Liberal League, their clandestine organization, and the Union of the Zemstvos,^ which had propagandized in favor of constitutional monarchy and whose spokesmen, Malchinsky and Dragomanov, had pubhshed their organ The Free Word abroad, were dissolved by 1884. Like everyone else, the moderate hberals were infected by the viruses of the times — apathy, indecision, and boredom — and this despite the fact that the ris- ing upper bourgeoisie (merchants, bankers, industrialists) were eager to join with the educated nobility, the members of zemstvos, university pro- fessors, lawyers, physicians, and white-collar workers, aH of whom made up the effective working forces of the Gradualists. The Russian Gazette, of Moscow, and the respectable monthly, Messenger of Europe, directed by Arseniev and Pypin, were the rallying points of the Westemizers, who condemned the violent methods of the socialists and, without engaging in a direct political struggle, hoped to mitigate autocratic abuse through a defense of legality. They also had faith in a pale and uneffectual propa- ganda of constitutional doctrines and in ‘small deeds,’ and loved to re- peat the proverb, gutta cavat lapidem — ‘the drop hollows out the stone.’ The radicals and socialists were, meanwhile, undergoing a great change. The majority of the intellectuals had been hard fait fay the de- s See voi I, p. 205. 18 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE feat of the Party of the People’s Will. Like Chekhovian characters, they felt bored, disgusted, and morbidly isolated. Some of them responded to Tolstoy’s preachmg of moral regeneration, since they had lost faith in political action, and particularly in the transformation of the regime through violence; the philosophy of non-resistance to evil found many followers. On the other hand the doctrine of ‘small deeds,’ as opposed to extensive social activity, also appealed to people who had found disap- pointment in heroism and sacrifice, while a great many simply adopted an attitude of utter resignation. Weariness, opportunism, and boredom also greatly affected the pe- riphery of the radical circles There was, however, a minority which was determined to carry on the revolutionary traditions of Popuhsm Despite arrests and executions, various attempts were made to revive the party and between 1882 and 1887 new conspiracies and certam terronstic acts gave proof of the underground activity of the intransigents In 1887 a group led by Lukashevich, Chevyrev, and Alexander Ulianov began lay- ing the groundwork for the assassination of Alexander III, but all were arrested and executed. In signing the death sentence of Alexander Ulianov the Czar could hardly have foreseen that Vladimir, the terrorist’s younger brother, then aged seventeen, was destined to become the leader of Communist Russia thirty years later, under the name of Nicholas Lenin. Despite the defeat of the party, however, which definitely disap- peared from the Russian scene by the end of the ’eighties, the Populist circles continued to exist and to spread their ideas. Paradoxical though It may seem, the period that saw the tnumph of reaction and the quelling of revolutionary activities was also the time of an extensive diffusion of socialistic ideas. What was lost in intensity, force, and action was gained in scope. And while the ruling classes rejoiced at the apparent calm that finally descended upon the Empire, in thousands of clandestine circles the intellectuals, young and old, were discussing the problems of the revolution and participating in the controversies between the Marxists and the Populists. IV After the split in the Land and Free- dom party, a young member of the Black Division group, George Plek- hanov (1856-1918), a nobleman and a former ofiicet in the army, went abroad to study the socialist movement in Switzerland, France, and Ger- many. In 1883 he founded the Emancipation of Lalxa: party, die first Russian Marxist organization. His two books. Socialism and the Po- Uticsl Struggle (1883) and Our Divergencies (1885), in which he analyzed, the reasons for the Populists’ faffure, evoked violent polemics ih Russia and among Russian imigris^ These books, like most books by, THE POPULIST MOVEMENT 19 Russian socialists, had as a matter of course been prmted by the under- ground press, or had been smuggled m from abroad Plekhanov mamtamed that Russia was already following the path of Western capitalistic development, and rejected the Popuhst hopes of her non-capitalistic evolution. He also attacked the doctrine of the role of the individual in history, labeling it an idealistic illusion, and pomted to the prmciples of dialectical materialism according to which historical events are determmed by forms of production and distribution and by the class struggle. Political developments in Russia seemed to corroborate Plekhanov’s point of view. Industrialization had brought into being a proletariat of peasant origin, which was constantly growing in numbers. The growth of the proletariat was accompanied by the strengthening of the bour- geoisie, which demanded the extension of its rights and often clashed with the landed gentry Despite subsidies and special privileges, the land crisis seriously threatened the nobility. As a class the gentry was declining rapidly, although by the end of the nineteenth century approximately thirty thousand landowners possessed seventy miihon dessiatinas (a des- siatina is two and a third acres) while ten million peasant families had but seventy-five million. Land and agriculture still constituted the crucial problem of Russian life. It was also the pivotal point in the debates be- tween the Populists and Marxists, groups of both of which had multiphed abroad and at home. In 1885 A Projected Program for a Russian Workmen* s Socialist Democratic Party was published by the emigres. The Social Democrats rejected both the Slavophile and the Populist theories of a ‘special way of development’ for Russia’s peasantry. Plekhanov criticized these ‘danger- ous delusions’ with irony and vehemence: for him the mir, collectivistic psychology, and all that the Populists called ‘socialistic tendencies’ were just so many ‘relics of a dated economic order’ bound to collapse under the impact of advancing capitalism. Concentration of landed property in the hands of big holders and the exodus of poor peasants into the city would deal the last blow to the archaic way of life of the Russian masses. The majority of the peasantry would be ‘toiled down in the cauldron of capitalism.’ Thus, all hopes in the revolutionary role of the peasantry were sheer nonsense. The proletariat alone was a truly revolutionary class. Plekhanov and his friends were convinced of the necessity for po- litical struggle. ‘The winning of democratic freedoms is the first step of the proletarian movement,’ the Marxists affirmed in 1885, in apparent agreement with pxt stand of the Populists six years before. The Populists, however, had claimed that the political struggle would lead to a revolu- tion strongly tinged with sociatet reforms; die Marxists contended that 20 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE the revolution in Russia would be a bourgeois one, ‘with the help of the proletariat ’ Thirty years later, after 1917, the tables were turned the Bolsheviks, who were a faction of the Social Democratic party, were ac- tually striving for a socialist revolution, while the Social Revolution- aries, the heirs of the Populists, contended that the revolution was po- litical and bourgeois. The Marxists tended to glonfy the workingman, just as the Populists had idohzed the peasant. At the First International Socialist Convention in Pans in 1889, Plekhanov surpnsed his audience by saying: ‘The revo- lutionary movement in Russia can tnumph only as a labor movement.’ The man who made this categorical statement was, however, far from being a utopian His mind was clear and logical, and he fought re- lentlessly against ‘vague Bakunimsm,’ ‘socialism of the heart,’ ‘Populist falderals,’ and ‘revolutionary castles m the air.’ This nobleman, who had abandoned a career in the army for that of a Marxist revolutionist, was a disciple of the French rationalists, and his materialism, like that of Marx and Engels, stemmed from Holbach, Helvetius, and Diderot. Thought, for him, was but a function of matter, and he saw m social life the ex- pression of economic, material processes He warned Russian intellectuals not to build their socialism on such notions as ‘moral responsibility,’ ‘a debt to the people,’ and ‘Duty and Beauty’; he wanted them to compre- hend the factors leading to an inevitable economic transformation of society. Their task was merely to help history in the accomplishment of what was already determmed. It was imperative to make Russia open her doors to capitalism — and to accept all the consequences thereof. Such formulas aroused the ire of intellectuals, the majority of whom were hostile to capitalism either on emotional and traditional grounds, as in the case of the anstocrats who were disgusted by the vulgarity of the newly rich and the ugliness of industrialization (Chekhov’s Cherry Orchard pictures these uirforgettably), or because of political considera- tionSy as in the case of the liberals, Populists, and Slavophiles, who felt alarmed by the disintegration of the peasant way of life. They all labeled Marxism horrible and monstrous. The Populists were also worried by the irresistible progress, the boldness, and the scope of the Marxist move- ment. A small group of orthodox Populists took a firm stand against ‘the capitalist plague,’ still believing that salvation would come from the mir and the artel; most of the Populists, however, were forced to admit the validity of the scientific methods of the Marxists and of their criticism of Populist errors, and they felt the urgency of a revision of their own doctrines. Between 1885 and 1895, under the onslaught of Marxism, Populism was snp|danted by ‘critical Populism, as expounded by Nicholas Mik* the populist movemekt 21 hailovsky (1842—1904). In the ’seventies and ’eighties, and even in the ’nineties, his position was similar to that of Chernyshevsky or Pisarev in the ’sixties. Sociologist, journalist, editor of influential monthlies, this so- cialist of noble birth had acquired considerable renown as a literary critic with his brilliant essays, such as ‘The Right Hand of Count Tolstoy and Khs Left’ (1873) and ‘The Cruel Genius’ (1812), dealing with Dostoev- sky, and by his sociological studies, particularly What Is Progress^ (1869), Darwin\" s Theory and Social Science ( 1 870-73 ) , Struggle for Individuality (1875—6), and Heroes and the Mob (1882), in which he displayed his talent as a witty polemicist Taking up Lavrov’s anthropologism as a doctrine of ‘socialist indi- vidualism based on moral values,’ Mikhailovsky offered a system of ideas that reinforced the trend of non-Marxist sociahsm m Russia. The term ‘system of ideas’ is used advisedly As in the ’forties, the Russians of the ’seventies and ’eighties were looking for an all-embracing doctrine, for some sort of secular religion, and they joined Popuhsm or Marxism just as Chnstians of vanous denominations join them respective churches Mikhailovsky, like Plekhanov, was a leader because he offered a faith, an amalgam of thought, emotion, and will-for-action; he was, not unlike Belinsky, a moral authority, and his articles taught men how to live as well as how to think. But he was neither a utopian nor a doctrinaire. A follower of Herzen, Chernyshevsky, and Lavrov, he blended various cur- rents of Populism into a single stream. He fully recognized the merits of Marxism, particularly in economics, yet he refused to accept historical matenahsm and denied the possibility of explaining social and cultural evolution in terms of economic factors alone. According to Mikhailovsky, moral, religious, psychological, national, and many other factors are as operative m human life as are the class struggle and economic forces Man creates values of good and evfl, of justice and injustice, which are ethical concepts; we judge everything and we set our goals in accordance with our ideals, which are also an ex- pression of our moral consciousness Individual and collective activity is inspired and guided by values we recognize as supreme. These values determine our interpretation of history (which interpretation is, there- fore, subjective) and our attitude toward current conditions. In the course of human evolution there was a supreme value that had affirmed itself above aU errors and passions, human individuality, the respect for and integral development of which could be defined as one of the highest aims of mankind. Social progress was the march toward such forms d col- lective life, by which the interests of the individual and the satisfaction of his needs were assured. It is true ffiat social progress does not always coincide with personal 22 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE happiness. In modern society technical achievements and division of labor often act to the detriment of the individual, who is caught m the net of political and economic complexities. He is demed his human rights, he is a slave, a tag, a number, a cog in the machine This leads to what Mikhailovsky called the struggle for individuality. Man aspires to a regime in which the interests of the individual and those of society are harmoniously reconciled. Such a happy blending could exist only m a new social order based on co-operation and exclusion of economic competition. Sociahsm, which proclaims the sohdarity of all who labor, IS such a social order Men are going to be emancipated by labor, since — and this was Mikhailovsky’s famous ‘formula’ — ‘the mterests of labor coincide with the interests of the individual, and man manifests hunself fully in creativeness and work.’ It IS interesting to notice that this cult of labor, and particularly of manual labor, was typical of the repentant noblemen; Mikhailovsky’s apotheosis of labor is similar to Tolstoy’s; and since the ’twenties of our century, in Soviet literature, the same theme, although with different overtones, has been resumed. Socialism, claimed Mikhailovsky, is emancipation by work and through work, since it liberates the people, the majority of individuals. Yet Mikhailovsky was careful enough not to lapse into a sentimental idealization of the people, or into any deification of the peasant. He pointed out that while the intellectuals are inspired by idealistic concepts, the masses are often deaf to ideas of justice, freedom, and beauty. The intellectuals, however, must adhere to these high values at any cost; they have the duty of defending the interests of the people, but that does not mean sharmg the people’s prejudices, backward opinions, and be- nighted attitudes. One of the significant features of Mikhailovsky’s doctrine was his identification of the objective scientific truth with justice and beauty. ‘The truth of a theoretical heaven apart from the truth of the practical earth,’ he wrote, ‘was far from being satisfactory and always offended me. And on the other hand, the noble practice of life and the highest moral and social ideals seemed to me offensively helpless if they despised scientific truA.’ He attempted to reach a synthesis of knowledge and morality;, consequently his system was directly effective in determining the aims and behavior of his followers. As a critical positivist, Mikhailovsky warned the Populists against any overestimatton of the mir and the artel and he carried on polemics against the Old Guard of Populism — V. Vorontzov, P. Cbervinsky, I, Kablitz-Yuzov, and others. He recognized that certain traihtibns of Rus- han peasantry contained positive elements that could be used in a future THE POPULIST MOVEMENT 23 socialist transformation. Yet he was aware of all the changes capitalism and the increasing Western influence were bnnging into Russian life. This did not prevent him from insisting on the pecuharities of Russian economy and history While the Marxists spoke of the universal pattern of social evolution and claimed that the difference between Russia and Europe was due to the gradation of the same process, the disciples of ‘Russian social- ism’ emphasized Mikhailovsky’s discrimination of types of development, thus establishing a quahtative instead of a quantitative criterion of com- parison. Mikhailovsky applied his distinction between the type and de- gree of development to many social and moral phenomena. Without sharing the enthusiasm of early Populists and Slavophiles, Mikhailovsky believed that Russia would not copy Western standards, and that her revolution would be the result of an alliance between the peasants, the proletariat, and the intellectuals. Under a new guise, he brought Russian socialism to the fore again. This re-entry was fairly suc- cessful; Mikhailovsky’s doctrine attracted many followers, and Marxism and Neo-Populism were the two mam currents that divided the radical intelligentsia at the end of the ’eighties and the beginning of the ’nineties. 2 Uspensky, Garshin, and Saltykov I Populism as an intellectual influ- ence was to transcend political programs and inform virtually all the literary activity of the period Its emphasis on ‘reunion with the people,’ Its dream of the unity of the masses with the intelligentsia, was to dom- inate the ’seventies and ’eighties As Alexander Ertel put it, one might not share the illusions and ideology of Populism, but one could hardly escape the Populist mood. TTiis IS true even of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, who were going against the current and opposing socialism and the revolutionary movement. The peasant Platon Karataev in War and Peace warmed the hearts of all Populists, so did Levin’s discovery, in Anna Karenina, of supreme wis- dom in the peasant mentality and way of life; and the infallible peasant justice described in Power of Darkness, with the stammering, illiterate Akim representing the muzhik’s high moral sense. Tolstoy’s Populism was religious, but even those who did not share his faith accepted both his contrast between the peasant’s ‘healthy morality’ and the shallowness and h3?pocrisy of the upper classes, and his cnticism of capitalist civiliza- tion. Dostoevsky’s vision of the ‘simple people’ as bearers of orthodox sanctity (e g. The Idiot, Notes from the House of the Dead) and his messianic faith in the salvation of the world through Russia were other examples of the Populist trend. Minor wnters followed the dominant tendency in a more direct and obvious manner. Some simply idealized the muzhik as a social type of high moral standing. This idealization went hand in hand with the anti- capitalist trend and was also combined with a , biased interpretation of all the evils of peasant life: the latter were represented either as consequences of a backward environment (superstition, ignorance, poverty) or as ' 24 , USPENSKY, GARSHIN, AND SALTYKOV 25 superficial ills on the otherwise healthy body of the peasantry (rugged individualism as exemplified by the kulaks and the exodus of villagers to the big cities). Others, however, were gradually cured of such illu- sions, and their pictures of the peasants were strongly colored by ‘ob- jective realism’; m the ’eighties most of them felt the disillusionment and the despair of defeat. A close link could be established between them and the writers of the ’sixties such as Pomialovsky and Reshetnikov.^ The Populist movement in hterature encompassed many and various writers- the moralistic and sentimental Nicholas Zlatovratsky (1845- 1911), whose major work — The Foundations (1878-82) — depicted the clash between the village commune and the kulaks; the ironical tramp Alexander Levitov (1837-77), author of Sketches of the Steppe (1866) and forerunner of Chekhov and Gorky, the witty Vassily Sleptzov (1836-78), a tireless defender of emancipation of women and a humor- ous recorder of peasant vernacular; a member of the Land and Freedom party, Nicholas Karonin (pen name of Petropavlovsky, 1857-92), a rather bitter chronicler of the village life {Parashkino Villagers, 1881); Nicholas Naumov (1838-1901), whose short stones (The Forgotten Country, 1882) were devoted to Siberian farmers; Paul Zassodimsky (1843-1912), who wrote lachrymose stories about the poor people of town and country; Kazimir Baranzevich (1852-1927) and the more talented Michael Albov (1851-1911) followed m Zassodimsky’s wake. A new note was sounded in The Gardenins (1889), a vast panorama of country life by Alexander Ertel (1855-1908), a critical Populist and a Tolstoyan; his remarkable sense of language gave him a supremacy over other minor writers of the period. A group of Popuhsts who remained faithful to the traditions of the ’sixties devoted their attention to educated society and portrayed their generation. Some of them, such as Andrei Ossipovich-Novodvorsky (1853-82), descnbed the failure of the movement; others centered their works around the burning issues of their times: emancipation of women, the struggle against social prejudices, the clash between the young radicals and their conservative environment in family and society. The favorites with the intelligentsia were Alexander Sheller-Mikhailov (1838-1900), author of the highly popular novel When a Forest Is Cut Down Splinters Fly (1871); Gregory Machtet (1852-1901), a roving idealist and a short-story teller; Konstantin Stamukovich (1843-1903), author of Sea Tales (1885), a widely read collection of tales about the Russian navy; and Innokenty Fedorov-Omuievsky ( 1836-83), a Siberian poet and novelist whose One Step After Another (1870) was hi^y praised by the Socialists. iSeevoL,i,di. 10. 26 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE The Populist and radical literature found its counterpart in the writ- ings of Serghei Terpigorev-Atava (1841-95), whose stark, reahstic Im- poverishment (1882) depicted the decay of the landowner class, and in the melodramatic novels by Boleslav Markevich (1832-84), Vassily Avseyenko (1842-1913), and Konstantm Golovm-Orlovsky (1843- 1913) . By the end of the ’eighties, however, this kind of conservative and anti-Populist prose was distmctly on the declme, despite political condi- tions favorable to it. The only truly anti-radical and ‘reactionary’ writer of the period — Dostoevsky — was himself m many ways a religious Pop- ulist. II The winding paths of Populism led from the idealization of the people to the more sober study of their hfe and mentality This was the course followed by Gleb Uspensky (1843- 1902), the most important author of the movement. He was highly rep- resentative of the radical conflicts of the ’seventies and ’eighties An unhappy childhood had developed a morbid sensitivity in Uspen- sky, the son of a petty official After attending the University of St Peters- burg he became a contributor to The Contemporary, an mfluential monthly. In 1866 he published a series of sketches under the title Life in Rasteryaeva Street. Written in the manner of ‘physiological natu- ralism,’ these dealt with artisans, petty clerks, the poor, and the disin- herited. Like all Populist writers, Uspensky focused his attention on the ‘hu- miliated and the wronged,’ on their poverty, drunkenness, and brutality, Rasteryaeva Street presents every aspect of the idiotic, the vulgar, and the monstrous. Partly autobiographical, the book shows an evident Gogolian influence, although its realism is almost one-dimensional. It depicts downtrodden men and women, exhausted by hard work, by worry and the struggle for a daily pittance, whose only consolation is the Oblivion of drunkenness. They pawn their shabby belongings and commit all sorts of petty larceny for a glass of vodka. The provincial ‘acquirer’ and pawnbroker Porfyrich exploits the misery and ignorance of his fel- lows, and makes their existence even more dismal. Uspensky’s radical and Populist inclinations were developed by con- tact with the socialist imigris he met during a trip to Europe in 1872, and by the close ties he formed with members of the Imnd and Freedom party and the Party of the People’s Will. Later Mikhailovsky was also to exert a strong Muence on Uspensky. His sensitivity, his exposed nerves, made him extremely susceptible to ‘the travail and diseases (rf the conscience,’ as Mikhailovsky put it. His %oeal consciettce’ tormented him, and he saw injustice, poverty, and adl- USPENSKY, GARSHIN, AND SALTYKOV 27 ministrative abuses as personal affronts. He traveled extensively, living in villages and small towns and gathering material for his literary work everywhere. His great populanty was due mainly to his sketches of peas- ant life He presented facts on an almost ethnographic level, but always related them to the larger social and political issues As a Populist, Uspensky tended to celebrate the moral stamma of the peasant; yet as a realistic writer and a keen observer he never faOed to give a true picture of village life. As a matter of fact, he concentrated largely on its seamy side: the sordid existence of poor farmers burdened by taxes and fettered by cruel and stupid administrators; the tragedies of evictions and debts and lawsuits; the epidemics, droughts, and famines; the ignorance and prejudices of the peasants themselves, who persecuted the progressive elements in their midst; and the grim practices of preda- tory kulaks, who were growing into a caste of petty despots and were in- troducing capitalism in the villages (these accounts were to win him Lenin’s praise). He earned his realistic approach so far as to revise the intellectual’s attitude toward the peasants; he warned the idealists against what they would find in the country. He believed that although the peasant was po- tentially a higher type of individual, he still remained on a very low level of development — a distinction that often escaped the Populists. A humorist with a good ear for speech differences among various so- cial groups, Uspensky was essentially a writer of sketches, part fiction, part sociological essay, part newspaper article. In this genre he was in- dubitably a master. His writings, however with some rare exception, re- semble an enormous scrapbook in which a highly gifted artist has jotted down his observations and thoughts. Everything is tentative, incomplete, and rough, and the sketch, despite occasional passages of brilliant in- sight, never becomes a definitive artistic achievement. That which bestows life upon them is the intensity with which the author responds to the suffering of men. Uspensky was particularly sensitive to the moral effects of the autoc- racy and of poverty. He saw two main groups in Russia: the terrorizers and the terrorized. The lower classes were constantly crashed by fear: ‘keep your mouth shut,’ ‘lie low’ — these were the usual admonitions. In his wanderings he had learned that most common people were morally crippled by insecurity and servility — and he violently resented this dis- tortion of human soi^. His most significant sketch, ‘She Put Me Straight’ (1885), deals with a half-starved village schoolmaster, Tiapushkin, who sleeps on a wooden bench in a dirty hut, with a tom sheepskin cc®t for a blanket, and who is piwsecuted by the police, scowled at by the uncouth muzhiks, threaten^ by his enranies and the .oj&aafe. But no matt^ how 28 MODERN RUSSUN LITERATURE grieved and heartsick Tiapushkin may be, he finds comfort in a wonder- ful recollection: he had once gone to France and had seen the Venus de Milo in the famous Square Hall of the Louvre The statue had given him joy and faith. He can now endure fear and misery, for the goddess had ‘put straight’ his warped soul. She had made him realize ‘the happi- ness of bemg a human being, the possibility of bemg beautiful, all the infinite perspectives of human improvement, of a glonous future.’ In- human conditions and cruel men can certainly oppress, offend, and dis- tort humamty, but as long as the Venus de Milo stands tnumphantly on guard in the Louvre, the ideal of harmony and freedom still lives m men’s minds, and the village schoolmaster Tiapushkin will not go down before the ‘disgusting reahty.’ Uspensky’s faith that the future would put everything straight could not fortify him against the ugliness and dissonances of his day His rest- lessness and the fervor with which he reacted to all the evils of his society took a morbid turn In 1889 Uspensky showed undeniable signs of in- sanity, and three years later he was placed in a mental institution, where he remained until his death in 1902, having had but few lucid intervals Uspensky’s dream of an ‘infinitely bright future’ for the Russian peo- ple, his belief in the ‘tremendous beauty of the human being,’ and his ardent search for harmony and justice endeared him to hundreds of thou- sands of Russian readers. Very similar to Uspensky in sensitivity was another popular writer of the period, Vsevolod Garshin (1855-88). But while Uspensky, with his conception of literature as a public service and his ‘factology,’ was fundamentally a man of the ’sixties who had carried his realism and his faith over to the Populist era, Garshin reflected the mood of the ’eighties after the defeat of the Party of the People’s Will. There were two other differences: Garshin was an intellectual who made no attempt to step outside his social group and to ‘unite with the people’; his poetic tempera- ment led him away from Uspensky’s naturalism toward symbolic images and psychological analysis. Most of the Populists described life realistically and attempted to give a faithful picture of social actuality. Garshin analyzed the psyches of the intellectuals, with their burden of doubts and woe. Both men suffered, of course, from the same disease of guilt, of hypersensitivity, of what Chekhov, speaking of Garshin, called a case of a ‘sore conscience.’ The son of a small Ukrainian landowner and army officer, Garshin studied at the University of St. Petersburg. Although he was an anti- militarist by conviction, he enlisted in the army as a private in order to take p^rt in the 1877-8 war against the Turlra, because he wanted to share the dangers and sufferinp of the people. This gesture was typical USPENSKY, GARSHIN, AND SALTYKOV 29 of the Populist ‘mood’; the young men and women acted according to the proposition ‘If the people suffer, so must I.’ Although Garshin left a comparatively small body of work, his hterary reputation was very quickly established durmg his lifetime This afforded him httle satisfaction, how- ever, since his fits of despair and the recurrent attacks of a mental disorder kept him from systematic work. In 1888, durmg severe depression, he committed suicide by leaping down a stairwell. ‘Four Days’ (1877), his first and perhaps his greatest short story, is partly autobiographical, written after he was wounded in battle. His hero, one of whose legs has been shattered by a Turkish bullet, lies for four days on a battlefield, close to the putrefying body of a Turk killed by a Russian bullet. Details and descriptions have a nightmarish quality; ‘Four Days’ is a story of quiet horror. Garshin was always concerned with the problem of evil In one of his best tales, ‘The Red Flower’ (1883), an inmate of a lunatic asylum comes to believe that all the evil of the world is concentrated in three red poppies growing in the backyard of the institution. He picks them and hides them in his shirt, close to the heart. He feels that the slow poison of these horrible plants is slowly killing him, but he is ready to make the supreme sacrifice, to save mankmd by renouncing his own life. Thus he dies thinkmg he has eradicated evil forever; the three wilted flowers are found on his corpse. Evil and suffering seared the heart of Garshin, and he perished like his own hero, finding the burden of evil unbearable. Each of Garshm’s stories deals with pain, bloodshed, and dread. The painter Riabimn, in ‘Artists’ (1870), wants to paint a steel worker whose task is to use the weight of his body to buck the rivets on the inside of a boiler as they are being dnven in from the outside. Garshin, like his Riabinin, was obsessed by these victims of human cruelty and greed; he wanted to provoke a feeling of pity and horror in the reader. His pangs of conscience were not relieved by any hope of immediate amelioration. This ‘Hamlet of the heart’ craved love and harmony but, like Gleb Uspen- sky, he knew that his dreams would never come true durmg his lifetime. In ‘Attalea Princeps’ (1884), one of Garshm’s symbohc tales, an exotic palm is stunted and warped by the low glass of a hothouse. In a supreme effort the proud tree breaks through the glass and rears its head in triumph over the roof, only to discover a leaden sky, biting frost, and the squalor of a northern city. In this story, as in all his others, Garshin was revealing his personal tragedy, and his contemporaries felt he was mirroring their impotence and pain as well. They did not realize that this mad artist differed from his fellow writers. He called himself a realist, yet his writings veered further and further from the realistic school De- tails of physical suffering and the intricaci^ of moral torment attracted 30 MODERN RUSSUN LITERATURE him as they did Dostoevsky; the dramatic plots and romantic spirit of his longer stories such as ‘Nadezhda Nikolaevna’ ( 1 895 ) , the tale of a prosti- tute murdered by her diabohcal lover, who also shoots his rival and kiUs himself, reveal Garshin’s kinship with the author of Crime and Punish- ment. On the other hand, in his rhythmic prose, his symbolic, allegorical style, and his sense of the uncanny, he pioneered m a new direction. This ill-starred writer undoubtedly anticipated Chekhov and the Decadents. Garshm was paralleled m poetry — although on a much lower artistic level — by Semion Nadson (1862—87), the beloved bard of a generation of frustrated ideahsts. His father, of Jewish descent, died msane, his mother was a sickly aristocrat, -after a sad and solitary childhood, he studied at the military school in St. Petersburg, and subsequently served in the army as a commissioned officer, but his poor health (he had con- sumption) compelled him to resign The premature death of a young woman whom he adored made his condition worse, and he spent the rest of his life a semi-invahd m sanitariums and health resorts in Russia and abroad. When Nadson was sixteen, and the Party of the People’s Will came to the fore, he imitated Nekrassov and sang of ‘the battle agamst dark- ness,’ of the sufferings of the people. Later he became the spokesman for a generation that was rottmg m the atmosphere of defeat and stiffing reaction, and yet vividly recalled the heroic deeds and the sacrifices of its elder brothers. Nadson, with his quivering sensitivity and forebod- ings of imminent death, was able to express the exact mood of his con- temporaries. They felt they were slowly disintegrating in a period of corroding compromise and betrayal, and they were delighted by the whin- ing and highly idealistic stanzas of the dying Nadson. Efis verses, en- hanced by the legend of his unhappy life (not imlike that of Lorenzo Stecchetti in Italy or John Keats in England), were extremely popular — his collected poems were reprinted fourteen times in twelve years. He addressed himself to youth in its own naive language of generalities; idealistic, melanchoHc, highly individualistic, although filled with gen- erous altruistic flights. Though he was wordy, inflated, exclamatory, his lines were moving, and his readers seemed unaware of the triviality of his expressions and similes. In the ’eighties such poems had a contemporary relevance and the immediacy of a living voice. Now that the voice is no longer audible and the times have changed, we do not respond to the pathetic intonations of this po^ of weakness, sobs, and sickly dreams. His bad taste and cheap lyricism are hardly aimpensated for by his sincerity and longing for bmuty. That Nadson for decades remained a favorite with young in- t^ectoals is a of social rathey than literaiy significance. USPENSKY, GARSHIN, AND SALIYKOV 31 It is noteworthy that the three most popular writers of the period — Uspensky, Garshm, and Nadson — all had a tragic fate: insamty, illness, premature death were their common lot. And m this they seemed to sym- bolize for their contemporaries the doom and melancholy of a whole generation. in The greatest writers of the ’seventies and ’eighties — Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Fet — did not identify themselves with the socialist intelhgentsia. There were, however, two prominent men of letters — Nekrasov in poetry and Salty- kov-Shchedrm m prose — who were acknowledged leaders of the left wing. Saltykov’s position was unique: he belonged to the generation of the ‘Natural School’ and his were the methods and spirit of the critical real- ism that had characterized the literary climate of his youth. In this sense he continued a tradition; at the same time he originated and developed a special genre of social and political satire. Saltykov’s place in Russian literature is comparable to Swift’s in the English. Although he drew upon all the currents of Russian satire, spe- cifically upon Griboyedov and Gogol (the latter’s influence is evident even m the sentence structure of his early works), he was much angrier and much more programmatic than his predecessors. ‘Saltykov alone,’ said Chekhov, ‘knew how to express openly his contempt; two thirds of his readers disliked him, but all trusted and beheved him.’ Chekhov’s comment suggests three salient characteristics of Saltykov: the accuracy of his realistic descriptions, his scrupulous fidelity to facts, and the Bibli- cal wrath of his satire. Mikhail Saltykov (1826-89), who wrote under the pen name of N. Shchedrin, and who is often referred to by the double name, Saltykov- Shchedrm, was bom into a family of ancient nobility on an estate in the province of Tula. In his childhood he had ample oppoitumty to witness family despotism and the abuses of landowners. He was educated at Pushkin’s alma mater, the Lyceum of Czarskoye Selo, and after gradu- ation entered the civil service. His association with the Petrashevsky circle and his interest in the French utopian socialists, especially in Fourier, formed his political views. His first tales (‘An Involved Affair’ and ‘Contradictions,’ 1848), in which he wondered why some people drove in carria^s while others must slog through the mire, provoked administrative reprisal: the young author was exiled to Viatka, in the extreme North, where he was compelled to live until 1856. By one of those inconsistencies then current among the administrative anthorities, he was allowed to resume his dvil-service activities. Saltykov described Viatka as ‘a world of stinking vapors, swamps, gossip and grea^ |nes, 32 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE card games, mounds of red tape, and papers ’ He recorded his impres- sions in Provincial Sketches (1856—7) — a caustic expose of adminis- trative abuses and stupidity. No one since Gogol had assailed bureaucracy and the vices of the regime so effectively, and the progressives, including Chemyshevsky and Dobrohubov, hailed the new writer with enthusiasm The wide popularity of the books by N Shchedrin, the writer, did not affect the career of Mikhail Saltykov, the official. He rose in the bureau- cratic hierarchy and was appointed Deputy Governor of Riazan and Tver He had achieved the rank of State Councillor by 1862, when he resigned to devote himself entirely to wnting. After the arrest of Chemy- shevsky he became one of the editors of The Contemporary, from 1868 he shared with Nekrasov the management of Notes of the Fatherland, in which he pubhshed most of his works His role in rallymg liberals and radicals around this influential monthly was very important In 1884 this publication, to which he had sacrificed sixteen years of labor and anx- iety, was suppressed by government order. Saltykov, whose pugnacious genius needed an outlet, was thus depnved of his most powerful weapon in the stmggle against hypocrisy, ignorance, injustice, and perfidy. He spent the last five years of his life writing his astringent satires and auto- biographical novels. Saltykov’s writings may be divided into three main groups, the first of which includes his masterpiece. The Golovlev Family. Saltykov worked eight years on this novel, which was published in 1880. It is a chronicle of the life and gradual decay of a noble family on their ancient estate Goncharov, Aksakov, and Turgenev also descnbed the disintegration of nests of the gentlefolk, but they did so with nostalgia, lyricism, and sym- pathy. Saltykov did it with contempt and disgust. An implacable foe of the regime that supported the nobility as a ruling caste, he saw in the manorial estate the source of all evil: ‘all death, all poisons, all sores derive therefrom.’ The decay of the Golovlevs is drawn with the most repellent details; it becomes the symbol of the disintegration of a class that is driven toward madness, baseness, and degeneracy Arina Petrovna, the domineering and rapacious head of the family, rules her husband, her sons, and her serfs with an iron hand — and is loathed by all of them. Bent on the accumulation of wealth, she sacri- fices herself, torments her children, and ruins her husband’s life — and all ‘for the sake of the family.’ When her predatory mstincts are satisfied at last and she has accumulated a fortune by acquiring land and villages with many soub (i.e. serfs), it becomes apparent that the fruits of her labor are so many grapes of Sodom, and she finds herself living in a void; in the end her son Porflry, throu^ a series of well-planned frauds and USPENSKY, GARSHIN, AND SALTYKOV 33 schemes, divests her of land, serfs, and money, and the old matriarch dies a sad and lonely death The figure of Porfiry Golovlev belongs among the great creations of Russian fiction. His nickname of Yudushka (Little Judas) has become a symbolic colloquialism; as a type, he ranks with Pecksniff, Unah Heep, and other arch-hypocntes of world literature This Russian Tartuffe is ingratiatmg and suave to his mother, although he actually is a beast of prey and a vampire. Unctuous to his victims, he ruthlessly pursues his avaricious course His devotions are never of the closet: he is forever invokmg God, and never undertakes a swindle without uttermg a prayer and making the sign of the cross. But after his successes in fleecing his mother and his relatives and becoming sole master of a large fortune, there is very little for him to do. To fill the vacuum created by his idleness Porfiry gives free rein to his evil imagination, and plays all sorts of nasty tricks under the guise of morahty and fear of the Lord. He wastes his time m futile account- ings, petty worries, senseless litigations. These give him an illusion of activity — just as his prayers and the repetition of quotations from the Bible or of the most trivial sayings give lito a veneer of religion and re- spectability. This obsequious hypocnte is also a liar and a babbler. He talks contmuously, he conceals all his moral degradation, all his evil doings, behmd a screen of chatter. His end is, nevertheless, as tragic as that of any of his victims Abandoned by all, sickened by his drunken- ness, surrounded by filth and heaps of dusty papers, he lives in his den like a savage, loquacity and sanctimoniousness are of no avail against his inevitable physical decay This horrifying family chronicle records nothing but frustration, fail- ure, and death. Few novels in Russian literature are as gloomy and un- relieved as this, in which even the descriptions of nature are keyed to the general atmosphere of doom and decay: clouds shrouding the earth, rams that turn everything into morasses, blizzards and frost that kill all life, the destroying blaze of summer with its ‘darkness of heat.’ The qual- ity of tenseness in the novel suggests Dostoevsky, who, by the way, also tried to create a type of hypocrite and parasite in Thomas Opiskin, the hero of The Village of Stepanchikovo; Opiskin, however, is benign and innocuous in comparison with Yudushka. A realistic treatment of the family and private ownership of property, two of the institutions the autocratic regime sought to defend. The Golovlev Family showed the moral and physical decadence of the nobility as a class. This was accomplished throu^ the psychological analysis of the main characters, a method that distinguished the novel from family 34 MODERN RUSSIAN LITERATURE chronicles written by other realists. Saltykov’s use of realistic details is highly functional. The author chooses them deliberately, and they all serve a sharply defined purpose, fitting into a well-ordered design Tur- genev, who compared Saltykov to Juvenal and Swift, pointed out ‘the grave tone of his frightening humor, his realism remains lucid and sober amidst the wildest display of fancy.’ These qualities, although with less psychological insight, are also present m his last book. Old Times in Pochekhome (1887), a seim- autobiographical chronicle of pre-Reform Russia It lacks the power and unity of The Golovlev Family, but contains masterful descriptions of customs and life on a typical country estate and striking portraits of the landed gentry and their peasants Some of its episodes have a highly dramatic quality. The second group of Saltykov’s works includes his satires, for the most part drawn as caricatures in broad, dashing strokes. Their sarcasm often turns into harshness and loathing. Saltykov’s scornful pages crackle with the bitterness of his civic indignation and contempt for stupidity The imps and demons of iniquity and greed, of narrow-mindedness and conservatism, are alike impaled by the stabbing attacks of his humor Among many works of this sort The Story of a Town (1870) is probably the most characteristic as well as the most popular Following Gogol’s example of attacking the present through the past, Saltykov represented the history of Russia as the history of the imaginary town of Glupov (Fooltown) , the inhabitants of which accept their rulers with a kind of onental fatalism. The Glupovians, like the characters of Uspensky, are frightened for all time, they are destined to tremble forever — ^just as their administrators are destined to inspire life-long fear through floggings and mistreatment. The townsfolk are sluggish, submissive, and apathetic, their rulers are mad, willful, ignorant. One of the administrators of Glupov has an empty receptacle instead of a head but apparently nobody seems to mind this, since his regime is precisely like every other regime: ‘The citizens are nabbed and Jailed, beaten and flogged, framed and sold ’ Readers had no difficulty in recognizing in this extravagant gallery the individual features of the Czars and their favorites. Negodiaev (Good- for-nothing), who blasted the streets paved by his predecessor in order to use the material for building monuments, was a thinly disguised por- trait of Paul I, while the lustful mystic Grustilov (Grieving), who flogged his subjects ‘melanchohcally,’ was a parody of Alexander 1. A devastat- ing caricature of General Arakcheyev, Alexander’s favorite, was drawn by Saltykov in his famous Ugrium-Burcheyev, a governor who entered Glupov on a white horse; burned down the school, and abolished all USPENSKY, GARSHIN, AND SALTYKOV 35 learning. His dream was to make the straight hne triumph everywhere — in men’s minds as well as in streets. With the coming of his reign ‘the course of history ceased ’ Certain chapters of the book were so ob- viously aimed at famous historical events and were interspersed with such bold allusions and impertinent hmts that the censors never dared to recognize the truth, lest they be accused of irreverent inferences about Emperors and Empresses The fact is that the authorities preferred to play deaf and dumb, and The Story of a Town, published m 1870 as a senal in Notes of the Fatherland, was subsequently issued in book form and enjoyed a tremendous success Of course, this parody on history (m- cludmg the historians themselves, particularly the representatives of the ofiScial Slavophiles, such as Pogodm, whom Saltykov tore to shreds) was but a method by which Saltykov lashed out at his own times. He was right when he wrote: ‘I have nothing to do with history; I deal only with the present.’ When Saltykov recounted the adventures of Glupov’s ad- mimstrators, whose reforms consisted of planting bay trees and encourag- ing the cultivation of cucumbers, or when he told of the occasional revolts of the burghers against the leadership of the bandits, quacks, and swindlers, his allusions to contemporary life were perfectly clear. The same holds true of his remarks on the national characteristics of Glupov’s citizenry: its mhabitants, said Saltykov, had had a number of potentialities in ancient times before the name of the town was changed by Jupiter from Umnov (Braintown) to Glupov, but their sleep had lasted for too many centuries and now they could only ‘bow and sweat.’ This political satire hit out not only at the rulers with their coarseness and despotism, but also at the Russians in general for their passivity and timidity. Saltykov called himself a party man; he meant that, unlike other writers, he had firm political convictions. He expressed the temper of the revolutionary democracy of his times. His onslaught was deliberately virulent, and in his attacks on autocracy he went much further than any of his hterary predecessors, such as Gogol, had gone. The Story of a Town was not merely an expose of certain isolated phenomena, of cer- tain specific ills of the regime: it questioned the Russian state in its entire historical structure; it radically rejected everything that had grown out of Czarism. While his forerunners had m the main merely aroused lau^ter, Saltykov provoked disgust and a violent desire to fight against all the Ugrium-Burcheyevs of Russia. The great satirist himself said that his intention was to dig beyond gaiety and fun. Indeed, one might add, Saltykov should be read by all who wish to comprehend the forces of hatred and cruelly that brought about the terrific explosion of the Rus- sian Revolution and Civil War. Turgenev, who had attended public read- ings of Saltykov’s satirical pieces, tells us that the tourer of Ihe aucHeime 36 MODERN RUSSIAN LIIERATURE sounded uncanny: the satirist’s lash stung sharply and spared nobody. ‘Saltykov was intelligent, honest, austere, and never failed to tell the truth, no matter how painful it might prove,’ wrote Gorky ‘He is a gigantic writer; the range of his creative effort is astonishingly wide, his laughter does not resemble Gogol’s — it is far more stunmng, truthful, deep, and powerful. Without Shchedrin one cannot grasp Russian history of the sec- ond half of the last century ’ After the publication of Provincial Sketches (1856-7), the sarcastic exposd of provincial officialdom became one of Saltykov’s principal con- cerns. Instead of concentrating his fire on the bureaucracy of St Peters- burg, as had been the custom in the literature of cntical reahsm, he de- voted his attention to local despots who admimstrated the remote re- gions of the immense empire Just as Ostrovsky had studied and pictured the samodurs, the stupid, willful merchants,^ Saltykov wrote the natural history of the samodurs among Caarist officials His Pompadours and Pompadouresses (1863-73) is a series of character sketches of the stupid, crass administrators who formed a close caste, lived on bnbes, legislated through whims, perverted the law, and carried on vulgar love affairs The Tashkentsians, a sequel, describes the greedy and empty-headed young men and women who regard government jobs as sinecures and op- portunities for graft. ‘We are ruled by morons, nincompoops, foul swin- gers, and unscrupulous bribetakers — all of them venal, hypocritical, and vulgar’ — this was the inevitable conclusion Saltykov’s contemporaries drew from his works His later writings. The Reign of Moderation and Order (1874-7), The Refuge of Monrepos (1879-80), Letters to an Aunt (1881-2), and others, were conceived in the same spirit of political caricature. In all of them Saltykov also attacked the provincial gentry and the new bourgeoisie. He pictured the nsing class of homespun capitalists in the ridiculous figures of the merchants Derunov"
