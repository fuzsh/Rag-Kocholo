The first volume in the Longman series was originally to have been produced by him. We took over the project at his suggestion and with his encouragement. Others have helped along the way. Francis Thomson, Constantine Zuckerman, Alexander Kazhdan and Andrzej Poppe kindly allowed us to see proofs or typescripts of forthcoming articles. Christopher Ward and Lesley Abrams read and commented on draft chapters. Anna Richardson offered valuable last-minute assistance with some tricky points in Arabic sources, Metin Kunt advised on a Turkic term and Rosamond McKitterick loaned a book at a critical moment. The Law of the Dog and the Forest is cited with the permission of Ihor Ševčenko. Special thanks are due to our publisher, Longman, who consistently contrived to give a plausible impression of optimism in the face of delay. Last and least one should mention the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), without whose multiple initiatives the book would undoubtedly have been finished sooner.\n\nix\n\nA Note on Spellings, Dates and References i. SPELLINGS In controlled tests, the inconsistent transliteration of foreign names and terms might emerge as one of the main causes of high blood-pressure in the academic community. Transliteration is like gambling: however subtle the system, the odds will always defeat one in the end. Our own guidelines are as follows. For Slavonic words we use the modified Library of Congress system, without diacritics: hence Andrei, rather than Andrey, Andrcj or Andrew; lurii, rather than Yury, Yuriy, Jurij or George. In certain place-names, however, we retain 'ë', pronounced 'yo', as in yacht. Medieval word-forms are transliterated according to modern spelling conventions, i.e. rendered without nasal or reduced vowels. In the modernized forms the 'soft sign' ('), showing that a consonant is palatalized, is included in bibliographical references and in italicized terminology, but omitted when the word appears as an ordinary part of the text: hence Suzdal rather than Suzdal', Rus rather than Rus', but volost' rather than volost. In rendering Turkic or Arabic or Scandinavian words we follow the equivalent convention. In general we prefer to reflect linguistic diversity rather than to impose familiarity. The practice of monolingual standardization seems needlessly condescending, as if readers arc incapable of spotting equivalent forms. The names of Greek-speakers are therefore Greek rather than Latin: hence Nikephoros rather than Nicephorus; unless they are culturally active among the Rus, in which case they are Slavonized: hence Metropolitan Nikifor. This is illogical, except that it helps to circumvent the problem of having to make a choice of spellings when ethnic origins are unknown. Very famous people must, however, remain English: hence St Andrew, or Constantine the Great. That is the simple part. Consider the name of the prince of Kiev at the turn of the eleventh century. The modern Russian equivalent is Vladimir, the modern Ukrainian equivalent is Volodymyr. Either choice could be seen as tendentious. So we turn to the sources. In the chronicles the prince tends to be Volodimer,ǔ with local East Slav vocalization, closer to the Ukrainian. But on the coins which he himself issued, he is Vladimirǔ, with Church Slavonic χ\n\nA N O T E ON SPELLINGS, DATES A N D REFERENCES\n\nvocalization, closer to the Russian. There is no right or wrong. We plump for Vladimir. Other names, too, appear in variant forms, forcing an arbitrary solution. A similar problem can arise with respect to some place-names in modern Ukraine and Belarus: Russian Belgorod or Ukrainian Bilhorod, Russian Galich or Ukrainian Halych? In cases of doubt, our map is medieval: hence Belgorod and Galich; and hence also, incidentally, a small and not very significant place called Moskva, which would sound too grand for its context if it were to be called Moscow. So much for rules and systems. Within these broad limits we have tried to be consistent, except where we judge it appropriate to be inconsistent. We hope that the results are less confusing than their prefatory explanation. ii. DATES Some readers may wish to follow up the references and look at the 'authentic' versions of the tales of the Rus. They will notice frequent discrepancies between the dates in the sources and the dates in our own narrative. Our dates are not - we hope - misprints, nor are we particularly maverick in our chronological hypotheses. It may be helpful to provide in advance a general indication of why such discrepancies occur so often. The chronicles of the Rus date events from the Creation, not from the Incarnation. As is well known (at least to medieval eastern Christian chronologists), Christ was born around the middle of the sixth cosmic 'day'; that is, around the middle of the sixth millennium; that is, around the year 5 5 0 0 after the Creation. But the precise sums could be added in a variety of ways, producing different 'eras'. The Rus adopted the 'Constantinopolitan' era. In order to convert an AM (anno mundi) date from this era into an A D date, one has to subtract 5 5 0 8 , not 5500.\n\nThat, at any rate, is the basic rule. The complication here is that the Constantinopolitan year began in September, whereas the standard year in the Rus chronicles begins in March: usually in the March following the start of the equivalent Constantinopolitan year (this is called a 'March year'), but sometimes in the March preceding it (an 'ultra-March year'). Thus, for example, the date 6 6 5 8 would cover the period from September 1149 to August 1150 according to the Constantinopolitan year, or from March 1150 to February 1151 if the chronicler is using a 'March year', or from March 1149 to February 1150 if the chronicler is using an 'ultra-March year'. Just for good measure, some native Rus sources also use the Constantinopolitan year, starting in September. No author ever explains his own usage. Some compilers unwittingly mix all three. One should also bear in xi\n\nTHE EMERGENCE OF RUS 750-1200\n\nmind that the annalistic framework for the first couple of centuries of dated local narrative was constructed by chroniclers writing long after the events. In short, dating is a problem even when the sources make it appear straightforward. iii. REFERENCES TO SOURCES Where there is a choice of editions, we tend to cite from that which is likely to be most convenient, unless a particular variant reading is important in context. Most of the translations are our own, although we also provide references to published translations where they are likely to be useful, which is not always the case.\n\nxii\n\nList of Abbreviations\n\nAbramovich/Miiller, Erzahlungen\n\nL.

The further we pursue the thing into the past, the more misleading our modern vocabulary becomes. O n l y in nationalist fantasy can the word 'Russia' stand for a kind of Platonic form, immanent even when invisible, constant in essence though variable in its historical embodiments. If we picture Russia as a state with its focus of power in Moscow or St Petersburg, or as an area inhabited mainly by people who think of themselves as Russians - if, that is, our notion of Russia is coloured by current political or ethno-cultural geography - then most of this book is not about Russia at all, or at least not about Russia alone. Instead it is about russia in the original Latin sense: about a land ruled by people known as the Rus (pronounced rooss). The story of the land of the Rus could continue in one direction towards modern Russia, or in other directions towards, eventually, Ukraine or Belarus. The land of the Rus is none of these, or else it is a shared predecessor of all three. Modern state boundaries are irrelevant here, as are the distinctions between modern national identities. So as not to confuse the main plot with its divergent sequels, the subject is labelled 'Russia' neither in the title nor in the text. W h o were the Rus and what was their land? Visitors at different times would have produced dramatically different answers. Around the turn of the ninth century the Rus were barely visible: small bands of traders trekking along the rivers through the dense and sparsely populated northern forests between the Baltic and the Middle Volga, lured towards the silver of the east; faint specks on a vast landscape; transient Scandinavians among Finno-Ugrian tribes. Returning after a couple of centuries the visitor would have found the Rus firmly established in thriving fortified cities, fattened with trade and tribute; but based in a new place, hundreds of miles to the south, on the Middle Dnieper, near the frontiers of the steppes; speaking a new language, since significant numbers of the Scandinavian Rus had become assimilated to the Slavs among whom they had settled; and promoting a new culture, for their rulers had accepted Christianity, the faith of the 'Greeks' (i.e. of the Byzantines). T w o centuries more, and the lands of the Rus stretched from the Carpathians almost to within sight of the Urals: centres of wealth and power had proliferated across a network\n\nxvii\n\nTHE EMERGENCE OF RUS 750-1200\n\nof territories in many respects diverse, but lent coherence (if not always cohesion) through sharing a single dominant dynasty, a single dominant language and a single dominant faith. These are large changes. The Rus and their lands are, so to speak, moving targets. The first task is to track the changes in sequence, to construct a framework of political or geopolitical narrative. The second and concurrent task, more interesting and important, is to explore the texture of change, the interlinked transformations in economic, social and cultural life which give substance and sense to the plain political chronology. The Rus therefore provide a convenient peg, but the theme of this book is not so much the people as the processes in which they participated. To drape a history of the period around a history of the Rus is an old device. It was used by the Kievan compiler of the earliest surviving large-scale native narrative, the Povest' vremennykh let, literally the 'Tale of the Years of Time', better known as the Primary Chronicle, which seeks to relate 'whence the land of the Rus came into being' and 'who first began to be prince in it'. 1 The Primary Chronicle is an immensely rich and colourful source, lively and varied, ambitious and informative. N o b o d y now would accept it as precise or adequate 'fact': the extant manuscripts date from much later than the work itself, the compiler was far removed from all but the most recent of the events described, his own sources of information were patchy and tendentious, and the whole was shaped to fit the political morality of a section of the Kievan elite in the early twelfth century. Yet despite the continual emergence of new material, and of new kinds of historical inquiry, the chronicle has in many ways proved remarkably resilient. Its uses are adapted rather than diminished, and the old device - to explore the age through an account of 'whence the land of the Rus came into being' - can still be effective in serving new purposes. Over the past few decades specialized auxiliary studies have moved far ahead of general syntheses. There have been regional histories, economic histories, urban histories, church histories, social analyses, legal and diplomatic histories, textual reconstructions and deconstructions, theoretical ruminations, cultural interpretations and evaluations, plus enormously productive archaeological excavations. Yet there have been few attempts to draw the themes together, to reconsider the entire period, to re-integrate the particulars into a thorough reassessment of the whole: no extensive monograph in English for 50 years, and surprisingly little of the requisite scope even in Russian or Ukrainian. The gap that this book aims to fill is therefore not entirely parochial. While our main brief is to introduce the period to those who know little about it, the fresh synthesis may also be of some use to those who already know quite a lot. 1 Note the variant 'in Kiev': PSRL, I, cols 1-2; PSRL, II, col. 2.\n\nxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n'The period' is a chronological abstraction, to which historians try to give shape. Shape is inevitably a product of hindsight: one picks the beginning which fits the end. The Rus of the early ninth century would be a very minor footnote were it not for the Rus of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Nevertheless, to focus on a particular people (the Rus) as narrative device remains justifiable, so long as one remembers that the end is not necessarily implicit in the beginning. But the Primary Chronicle employs another shaping device which has proved equally durable, although in more recent retrospect it ought to be more questionable. This is its focus on a particular place: on the city of Kiev. Political assessments of 'the period' take as almost axiomatic the view that the Kiev-based polity of the eleventh century - preferably ruled by a monarch - was and is the proper yardstick by which success and failure, or virtue and skulduggery, are to be measured; that it was the necessary culmination of all that went before and the proper aspiration for all that followed afterwards. Hence the catch-all label 'Kievan Rus' (or 'Kievan Russia') - not, as it happens, a medieval term - frequently applied to the entire span of some 400 years from the legendary origins of the ruling dynasty to the Mongol conquests of 1237-41. Hence also, from a 'Great Russian' perspective, the common division of Russian history into three parts, as a tale of three cities: Kiev, Moscow, St Petersburg. The city of Kiev was enormously important to the economic, political and cultural life of the Rus, and must figure prominently in any narrative or analysis. The problem with using Kiev as an emblem for the period is that the story of the land(s) of the Rus and the story of the Kievan Rus are different: though they overlap significantly in the middle, they do not coincide either at the beginning or at the end. An acceptance of normative, kievocentric values has led historians from the twelfth century to the twentieth to shape the politics of the period in terms of rise and fall, triumph and decline: first the prehistory of Kievan dominance, then the Golden Age, then political decay and the erosion of Kievan authority. But this leads to a paradox: the time of Kiev's political 'decline' was also a time of economic and cultural expansion for the Rus as a whole. If one abandons the Kiev-based, centralist schema, then there was no rise and fall, but rather a rise and rise, a continual growth and expansion. The paradox disappears: the lands of the Rus flourished economically and culturally not in spite of political decay but in part because of political flexibility. The adaptability of the Rus is a leitmotif throughout the present book. We do not see the Rus at any stage as implementing a single grand plan or as operating according to a fixed system. They explored and exploited opportunities, improvised, probed for alternatives. They adapted and modified their own conventions, both in order to initiate change and, increasingly, in order to cope with its effects: in order to stay abreast of the social and political consequences of their XIX\n\nTHE EMERGENCE OF RUS 750-1200\n\nown economic and territorial success. It was a kind of success that implied continual 'failures': false starts, paths tried and abandoned. Such 'failures' are as necessary to an explanation of the 'rise' as they are deceptive as an indication of a 'decline'. The dynamic adaptability of the Rus should be obvious even from the brief summary of their transmutations. But in the writing of their history it has tended to be overshadowed by schematic structures, whether of medieval providentialism, or of Soviet determinism, or of nostalgic nationalism. To stress that the Rus were flexible is not, of course, to argue that change was random or amorphous. Rather the opposite: it is simply to emphasize that patterns of political behaviour among the Rus were closely tied to shifting patterns of circumstance and development around them. This raises a question of form. One could choose to separate the various strands and devote a different sub-section to each: a chapter on the physical setting, a chapter on political chronology, a chapter on modes of production, a chapter on social structures, a chapter on culture, a chapter on dealings with neighbours. The result might be a very convenient work of reference, mirroring the division of the subject into distinct sub-disciplines, but with little sense of process and interrelationship. We prefer to integrate the narrative rather than to segregate the themes. By and large, therefore, we stick to a linear sequence, while accumulating sub-themes as appropriate along the way. Thus, for example, the reader will find the main discussion of military recruitment in Chapter Five; of the economy of steppe peoples in Chapter Two; of the status of women in Chapter Eight; of ecclesiastical organization and finances in Chapter Six; of architecture in Chapter Nine and so on. The thematic digressions look forwards and backwards in time, but they are anchored in their narrative context and do not pretend to be comprehensive. The inconvenience is mitigated to some extent by the use of copious cross-references. Further sins of omission ought also to be confessed in advance. Readers can be spared a certain amount of frustration if they are warned of what not to expect. We have concentrated more on the variables than on the constants, more on processes than on events, more on the dynamics of change than on the description of routine. The result is elitist, in that we devote relatively little space to what most of the people through most of the lands were doing most of the time. Worse still, we virtually ignore the huge quantities of scholarly debate as to the precise status of various groups among the rural population, or on the precise meanings of social terminology relating to dependent or semi-dependent or semi-free categories of people: when or where or whether one might or might not detect what features of what stage of feudalism, or of the predominance of slave-ownership, or of democracy. Indeed, most of our remarks on social structures are deliberately approximate. For this we are only slightly apologetic, since the majority of the debates xx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nlie on the wrong side of the line between hypothesis and guesswork. Systematic reconstructions, so high on the agenda for Soviet historians, tend to push the available evidence a long way beyond what it can persuasively be made to show; which is why different historians have been able to produce radically different versions of the most basic sets of social relationships. O t h e r conventionally major questions likewise loom small. In setting priorities we have been acutely aware of Ševčenko's Law of the Dog and the Forest. A dog approaches a virgin forest, goes up to a tree, and does what dogs do against trees. The tree is chosen at random. It is neither more nor less significant than any other tree. Yet one may reasonably predict that future dogs approaching the same forest will focus their own attentions on that particular tree. Such is often the case in scholarship: the scent of an argument on one issue draws scholars into more arguments on the same issue. We have not felt obliged to linger at all the traditional landmarks. N o t that we imagine our own agenda to be in every respect beyond question. In a field where evidence is notoriously sparse even by normal medieval standards, the very simplest facts are often extremely fragile. The modern criterion of forensic proof - beyond reasonable doubt - can rarely be applied. There are only grades of hypothesis, from the almost certain to the probable to the plausible to the just conceivable. For purists, all statements should be recast as investigations, and narrative should dissolve into source-annotation. As far as possible we attempt to convey the flavour of the evidence, but in a single volume it is not practicable to remain constantly in the investigative mode or to spend much time discussing the received opinions. Where there is a legacy of major dispute, notes can guide readers towards it. However, we cannot requisition extra space so as to justify or qualify in detail every judgement which may happen not to coincide with received opinion. To do so would be to distort the balance of narrative by making a fetish of innovation; and to repeat the word 'perhaps' every other sentence would be tedious. However responsible one may try to be, no account of the Rus is definitive. Finally, a word about dual authorship. Historians tend to be nitpickers by professional habit and often by temperament. The eye is trained to scan quickly across areas of consensus before focusing sharply on points of disagreement. When we started on this project we were by no means certain that we would be able to reverse the procedure so as to arrive at a common perspective. In practice it was easier than we had feared and more productive than we had suspected. O u r individual interests and preoccupations turned out to be complementary rather than contradictory. Each of us took on a separate set of chapters for first drafting, and these preliminary versions were then revised after long sessions of what the diplomats would call 'frank and open' discussion. The final product is not quite\n\nxxi\n\nTHE EMERGENCE OF RUS 750-1200\n\nseamless. Intonation and emphasis vary to some extent, but it would have been absurd to try to standardize all aspects of style, and a mildly stereophonic effect might be no disadvantage. For those who may be curious, Part I was initially drafted by Jonathan Shepard, Part II and most of Part III by Simon Franklin. Work on the first sub-section of Chapter Nine was shared in ways too complicated to be worth explaining. We are jointly to blame for the results.\n\nxxii\n\nPART I:\n\nRoots and Routes\n\nCHAPTER O N E\n\nThe Silver-Seekers from the North (c. 750-c. 900) 1. BEGINNINGS When the compilers of the Primary Chronicle tried to explain where in the world their land lay, they conceived of it largely in terms of rivers and riverways. Tribes and peoples are named in connection with them, and great thoroughfares are described, together with journeys of famous men. Surprisingly, perhaps, for a work which sets out to record the deeds of a series of princes and of their subjects, the chronicle's opening pages treat the land as essentially one of transit, somewhere between other, more famous, places. There is a clear bias in the direction of the river Dnieper, and in favour of those living around one section of it. We are told that St Andrew, wanting to travel from a town on the Crimea to Rome, travelled up the Dnieper until he halted one night on the bank below some hills. Getting up next morning, he exclaimed to his disciples, 'Do you see those hills, how God's Grace shines forth upon them? God will cause a great town to stand there, and many churches to be built'. 1 Andrew blessed the hills and planted a cross on what was to become the site of the town of Kiev. He made his way further up the Dnieper and came eventually to the land of the Slovenes and the site of the future town of Novgorod. He observed their daily practice of beating themselves with young branches within an inch of their lives after baths of scalding hot water; having finished their self-flagellation, they plunged into cold water. Andrew continued on his journey and arrived in Rome. He recounted all that he had learnt and seen, and that the Slovenes 'do this as their way of bathing, not battering'. Andrew's listeners are said to have 'marvelled'. The anonymous contributor of this tale to the chronicle was fostering the sense that the northerners were different, and comically inferior; it was Kiev, and not the wooden bath-houses of Novgorod, that evoked the saint's prayers and prophecy. This bias reflects the outlook of Kiev-based authors of the later eleventh and early twelfth centuries, wishing to demonstrate that churches and refinement were preordained for the banks of the Middle Dnieper. They had only hazy notions about 1 PVL, I, p. 12.\n\n3\n\nTHE. EMERGENCE OF RUS 750-1200\n\nevents of more than three or four generations before their own, and their picture of Rus' extent and place in the world was not clear-cut. Yet in their attention to rivers as markers of settlements and as the means of travelling huge distances the contributors to the chronicle were not simply reading back the conditions of their own time into a distant past. As we shall see, rivers were used by a variety of people and peoples, sometimes to traverse the land mass, but far more often for the purpose of short trips, or simply as a source of food and water. Other animals besides man came to the river bank, and could be hunted or trapped, and finds of fish-hooks and weights for nets are common in settlements throughout the 'prehistoric' and 'medieval' periods. River-basins were channels for gradual, piecemeal migrations of groups of people living from hand to mouth in the seventh and eight centuries as in previous periods. Such movements were still under way at the time of the compilation of the chronicle, when several groupings bore the names of 'tribes' (see below, p. 77, 336). The chronicle's editors assumed that most of the ancient inhabitants of their land were Slavs. But in fact the Slavs were relatively recent arrivals to most regions north-east and north of the Dnieper, and even c. 1100 they probably constituted only a minority of the population in the north-east (see below, p. 131, 332). The chronicle's assumption is that the Dnieper is the pivot of its story, and some of the most dramatic events which it relates are set there, for example the mass-baptism of the inhabitants of Kiev c. 988 (see below, p. 163). In its awareness that rivers are more important than frontiers, it is responding to, and highlighting, one of the distinctive features of the history of Rus, in contrast to that of many other peoples or political structures. Frontiers were developed in Rus, and became defined by fortifications, from the end of the tenth century onwards (see below, pp. 170-3). But they were seldom clear-cut, and they could not usually be marked by natural barriers. There were dense forests, and marshes which were impenetrable in spring and summer. These stretched for thousands of kilometres across the plain in no particular pattern, save that in a wavering line running mostly to the south of the 57th parallel the pine forests gave way to those mixing conifers with deciduous trees such as chestnut and oak; further south still, the forests thinned out and eventually gave way to what Rus chroniclers called 'the open field'. There was no obvious focal point in this wilderness, nor were there the roads or ruins of more ancient cultures - nothing man-made to facilitate travel or direct attention towards some central place or half-forgotten authority. Rome was little more than a name even to the bookmen contributing to the chronicle and, as we shall see, awareness of the achievements and the ideology of the Roman empire was very slight (see below, p. 240). The best legitimizing myth that the editors of the chronicle could come up with was the tale of St Andrew planting his cross in the hills above Kiev. St Andrew is not said to have\n\n4\n\nTHE SILVER-SEEKERS FROM THE NORTH (c. 750-c. 900)\n\npreached there, or anywhere else in the eastern lands. He was merely a traveller, passing through. The tale of St Andrew's journey is probably a fairly late contribution to the chronicle. It seems to have been inserted in a geographical description of the land of Rus, and it is in this description that we find a more coherent attempt to give the land a shape, in terms of routes. The chronicle comes close to providing it with a kind of centre - but a forest, not a city or a trading post. We are told that one could travel along the Dnieper to the Greeks or from the Dnieper, by way of other rivers, to 'the Varangian sea' (the Baltic), and on from there to Rome and thence to Tsargrad (Constantinople) and ultimately back to the Dnieper's mouth: 'the Dnieper flows from the Okovskii forest and flows to the south, but the Dvina flows from the same forest and goes to the north, and enters into the Varangian sea. Now from this same forest the Volga flows to the east'. 2 Thus in so far as there is any basic starting-point inside the Rus lands, it is the forest of Okovskii, which stretched from Lake Seliger to the upper reaches of the Western Dvina and south-westwards as far as the river Kasplia. Even though it straddled the head-waters of great rivers which offered geographical bearings of a sort to the inhabitants of Rus, it was densely packed with trees and undergrowth, and parts of it were still virtually impenetrable in the later middle ages. Thus even where nature provided fairly convenient means of communications and some sort of focal point, it threw up massive barriers, hindering the concentration of populations in any one area. Not that travel by means of the great rivers was easy for those covering long distances. Rafts, canoes of stretched hides and dugout canoes enabled the native inhabitants to get about for the purposes of fishing or pursuit of the deer, beaver, wild fowl and other game which tended to congregate near the banks. But they were less suitable for long distances, especially if laden with passengers or bulky cargo. Besides, there were many natural hazards facing anyone sailing far from his home waters. This was the case even along the Volga, which is, rightly, seen as one of the great waterways of the later medieval and modern periods. There were numerous sandbanks, shoals and stretches of white water to be negotiated, and towards the end of summer the water-level could fall so low as to make navigation in all but the smallest and lightest craft awkward and slow. For example, there were more than eight sandbanks along the Volga in the region of modern laroslavl, where some important trading settlements would arise in the ninth century. These navigation hazards literally vanished each spring, when the snows melted into the tributaries feeding the river and burst its banks. During the weeks of the thaw, a boat could be\n\n2 Ibid., p. 12.\n\n5\n\nTHE EMERGENCE OF RUS 750-1200\n\nswept quite rapidly downstream towards the point where, according to the Primary Chronicle, the river flowed into the Caspian Sea through 'seventy mouths'. 3 The speed and turbulence of the flood waters posed new dangers, especially for small, light, craft, while the breadth of the expanses of water and the lack of landmarks posed navigational problems for boatmen unfamiliar with local conditions. Moreover, a return journey after the force of the current slackened involved coping with the sandbanks and other hazards which now re-emerged from the waters. The Volga was the longest river in the eastern land and its floods were among the most spectacular of all. But there is no reason to suppose that navigation was significantly easier or safer elsewhere. So while the major rivers offered a means of piercing the forested land mass, they did not present a particularly soft option for those planning a round trip across great distances. By the time the final version of the Primary Chronicle was being compiled, there were settlements of boatmen, pilots and hauliers at the more difficult stretches of water, and the growing number of villages strung along the river banks could provide food or overnight shelter to the crews of oarsmen. Long-distance commercial travel with a cargo of goods depended on these services, especially if the cargo was a human one of slaves, in need of food. These back-up facilities for regular travellers were not available 400 or so years earlier, at the beginning of our story, and it is likely that the riverways were then most in use for short journeys by boat, or were followed in winter by those able to travel by ski or sledge. In these circumstances, the case for staying at home might seem to have been overwhelming, and for the vast majority of persons in the eighth and ninth centuries, it was. But 'home' was itself a movable and uncertain affair for the inhabitants of the river valleys and the depths of the forests alike - part hunter-gatherers, part fishermen and part agriculturalists. They had few ties other than, in some areas, burial-grounds and ancestor worship to bind them to a particular spot, and dearth and hunger offered periodic stimuli to move on, while the increase in mouths which prolonged freedom from dearth could engender would ultimately have the same effect. Therefore the population of major river valleys was never wholly immobile and the small but fairly numerous promontory settlements in the region of the Upper Volga seem to have been meeting-points and places of co-residence of diverse ethnic groups over a protracted period. These settlements came into being there between the fifth and the end of the seventh or the earlier eighth centuries. The majority of their inhabitants belonged to one variant or another of the Finno-Ugrians, an\n\n3 Ibid., p. 12.\n\n6\n\nTHE SILVER-SEEKERS FROM T H E N O R T H (c. 7 5 0 - c . 900)\n\nethnic group characterized by a basically common language of which modern Finnish is one descendant, Hungarian another. Members of this group inhabited the expanses from northern Scandinavia to the Urals, and their ability to talk with one another perhaps went some way towards offsetting all the obstacles to travel. Finds of metal ornaments and decorative bonework at one of the earliest of the promontory settlements, Berezniaki, on the banks of the Volga, suggest the gradual infiltration there of Finno-Ugrians from as far east as the basin of the river Kama. But a community of language cannot be the sole, or even the main, reason for these movements of small groupings of people. Finds of pottery and ornaments at some of the settlements point to the presence in them of Baits, members of a quite different ethnic group, whose language belongs to the Indo-European stock of languages. They must have made their way from the west to the Volga through forests such as the Okovskii. The pace, scale and dating of the Baits' seemingly piecemeal migration across the land mass is still very unclear, but that they were on the move is not in doubt. There were also, in the sixth and seventh centuries, some longdistance exchanges which can reasonably be classified as 'trade' and which involved deliberate journeying. The evidence for them is very sparse, but it is important as an indication that long before the appearance of towns or the rudiments of politico-military organizations, the land mass could be traversed in its entirety, seemingly fairly regularly. The historian of the Goths, Jordanes, wrote in the sixth century of the 'Swedes', 'a people famed for the dark beauty of their furs', who 'send by way of trade through innumerable other peoples the sapphire-coloured skins for Roman use'. 4 Jordanes does not state that the 'Swedes' themselves made the long journey down to trade with the 'Romans' (i.e. Byzantines). But he leaves no room for doubt that commercial ties existed, and the Swedes had gained their reputation for sables by visits to the regions where high-quality furs were to be had, such as Lake Ladoga and the lands to its north and north-east. There is also archaeological evidence of exchanges much further east. The sixth- and earlier seventh-century Persian and Byzantine silverware and Byzantine coins found in the basins of the rivers Kama and Viatka reached the far north by means of trade rather than some non-commercial method such as gifts, plunder or tribute. The Byzantine silver coins and the cups and bowls, many of them bearing the stamps of the Constantinopolitan authorities or Persia's ruling dynasty, the Sasanians, had most probably been exchanged for furs. They had, presumably, been brought north to the Kama by Persian or other oriental traders. The vessels were highly valued by the Kama region's inhabitants. Some were used for 4 Jordanes, Romana et Getica, 111.21, MGH Auctores Antiquissimi, V, p. 59; tr. C. C. Mierow, Gothic History (repr. Cambridge, 1966), p. 56.\n\n7\n\nT H E M E R G E N C E OF RUS 750-1200\n\nritual purposes, but they were also kept as treasures, and occasionally drawings were scratched on their sides. Others were melted down and turned into ornaments responding to the Finno-Ugrians' tastes. 5 These two commercial nexuses linking the Byzantine and the Persian civilizations with the extreme north were, however, fragile. They slackened drastically in the course of the seventh century, although it is not certain that contact between the Middle East and the Middle Volga region was, or could be, totally severed. The change had less to do with the arrival of new groups of nomads in the Black Sea and Kazakh steppes - zones which had not been notably tranquil during the sixth century - than with the collapse of the market for sables and similarly high-priced furs in Byzantium and Persia. The Sasanian dynasty was overthrown by Emperor Heraclius and soon afterwards, in the 630s, the Arabs overran Persia and the ruling elite suffered impoverishment. The manufacture of elaborately ornamented silver vessels appears to have ceased. For more than a century the Arabs were at odds not only with the Byzantines but also with the people which had installed itself in the northern Caucasus and along the north-west shores of the Caspian, the Khazars. This people will be discussed later (see below, pp. 82, 95), and here we will note simply their prolonged confrontation with the Arabs. This reached a climax in 737, when an Arab army surged north of the Caucasus and advanced upstream along the Volga. The Khazars' ruler was obliged to submit and even agreed to accept Islam, albeit not for long. During this period of hostilities the risks for those contemplating a journey to the far north, never negligible, became formidable and elaborate series of short-distance exchanges between the Middle East and the far north could scarcely have avoided dislocation. Even so, there were in place several of the links in a possible chain of long-range contacts and exchange. Excavations have uncovered small Scandinavian settlements at various points along the eastern coast of the Baltic. There had been exchanges of goods and some circulation of persons between Central Sweden and Estonia and Finland since the early Iron Age. Such contacts are not very surprising, seeing that Sweden lies little more than 150 kilometres from the Finnish mainland and the Aland Islands and the archipelago of islets off the south-west coast of Finland offer many landfalls. There is archaeological evidence suggesting periodic voyages of Swedish kin-groups as far as Lake Ladoga already in the sixth century. Their objective, at a time when the area lacked any permanently settled inhabitants, is very likely 5 V. P.

Later, in the course of the seventh century, a substantial Scandinavian settlement was established on the main island of Aland and pottery was regularly imported there from Finland and perhaps also from Estonia. Finds in Finland of bronze, and of glass beads most probably of West European manufacture, point to commerce as being one of the activities in which the Aland islanders engaged. By the eighth century, some seem to have been taking Finns from the mainland as wives. 6 The handful of Scandinavian settlements known on the eastern side of the Baltic took diverse forms. A unique complex of settlements arose at Grobin, a few kilometres inland from the coast of Kurland. The numbers of the settlers and the extent of the territory which they occupied seem to have been sufficient for them to keep their identity distinct from the local Baits for over 200 years, until the mid-eighth century. This was the case even though the settlers traded with the inhabitants of the hinterland. Grobin was, in that sense, a 'colony'. Recent excavations have disclosed a commemorative stone depicting what appears to be a sea-going vessel of the sort which would have kept the settlers in touch with their homeland. Other Scandinavian settlements lay south of Grobin - on a navigable river in the case of Apuola, some 40 kilometres south-east of Grobin; and in an inlet in the Bay of Gdansk in the case of the settlement at Elbing. That some Scandinavians were interested in the forests' produce, or simply in seizing their human contents, is suggested by sagas which relate the expeditions of Scandinavian heroes to raid the eastern lands and also the imposition of tribute on the inhabitants by Swedish kings. These tales are largely fictitious and gained their present form in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, or later still. However, they probably relay an echo of a Scandinavian interest in the eastern Baltic coastal regions of low intensity, but long standing. These various forms of contact between Scandinavians and the Balt peoples were not of momentous significance in themselves. The forementioned settlements are few in number and scattered along a lengthy coastline. Yet their presence along the fringes of the Eurasian landmass helps account for the speed with which long-distance commercial ties appear to have knitted together, once a commodity generally deemed even more valuable than furs was to be had from the east. Such a commodity became available quite suddenly, in the middle of the eighth century. It is something still of value today, silver. There is controversy concerning many aspects of the process whereby the forested landmass became a meeting-point for members of various 6 J.

EMERGENCE OF RUS 750-1200\n\ndifferent peoples, united by the one common aim of material gain. The part played in this, and in the eventual formation of some form of political structure, by the Scandinavians is still more hotly contested. Much will always be unclear, and one reason for this is that the number of persons directly involved in the exchanges was exiguous, a minute proportion of the total number of inhabitants of the interior - itself in all probability a modest enough figure. But there are three developments which can be traced through the murk. Firstly, major changes in the Middle East followed the Abbasids' seizure of power from the Ommayad dynasty in 749. No further attempt was made to advance beyond the northern Caucasus and overrun the steppes. Instead, the Abbasids in 762 moved their capital from Damascus to Baghdad. This city was their own foundation and they instituted markets, seeking to attract traders with privileges and the protection of their caravans. From that time onwards their mint in Baghdad began to strike silver dirhams in quantities markedly greater than those of any other mint. The total annual output of Abbasid mints seems to have been substantial for the rest of the century, while much effort went into maintaining a high silver content. Many courtiers and officials populated the caliph's huge palace complex. Thus a ruling elite with a strong purchasing power and a penchant for luxury goods re-emerged in the neighbourhood of the Sasanians' old centre of power. And they disposed of a metal much prized by the inhabitants of the frozen north. In c. 759 Yazid, the emir of the Abbasid province of Arminiya (Armenia), married the daughter of the Khazar khagan, upon the instructions of the caliph. Peace was instituted between the two powers and even when armed clashes resumed at the end of the eighth century, they were now local affairs between the Khazars and the petty emirs and factions of Moslems of the border districts of Darband and Sharvan. Thus some of the man-made deterrents to journeys northwards along the Volga or across the adjacent steppe were lessened. Already in the 730s Khazar merchants were frequenting the port of Darband, on the north-west Caspian coast, while Darband's merchants could, upon payment of a tenth of their goods to the authorities, travel north from there 'to the countries of the Khazars'. 7 During the second half of the eighth century the town expanded and became the most important channel of trade between the Khazars and the Moslem world. Silver dirhams and such manufactures as glazed pottery, metal ornaments, glassware and beads were offered to the Khazars. The Khazars were living an essentially nomadic way of life in the steppes north of Darband and the Lower Volga and they do not seem to have 7 Derbend-Nameh, cited in T. S. Noonan, 'Why dirhams first reached Russia: the role of Arab-Khazar relations in the development of the earliest Islamic trade with Eastern Europe', AEMA 4 (1984), 265.\n\n10\n\nTHE SILVER-SEEKERS FROM THE NORTH (c. 750-c. 900)\n\ngrown or manufactured things which were of commercial interest to the Moslems. Such, at least, was the view of the mid-tenth-century Persian geographer, al-Istakhri. So they needed to procure goods from elsewhere to exchange with the Moslems and to a large extent that meant furs. The identity of those who ventured northwards in quest of them is obscure. It probably included Moslems as well as Khazars and members of the Burtas, a people living up-river from the Khazars on the Volga. This was, after all, an era when Arabic literature celebrated the daring and resourcefulness of merchants, and Sinbad the Sailor plied the seas as far as China. A second development of this period was that silver dirhams (then averaging around 2.8-2.9g in weight, but subsequently subject to much fluctuation) began to be transported to the north-western extremity of the forested land mass, and on to central Sweden or the island of Gotland. Dirhams are found individually or in 'hoards', which can vary in size from a handful to several hundreds or even thousands. No comprehensive catalogue of dirham hoards found on the territory of the former USSR has been published to date, and this leaves much obscure. Serious problems anyway attend the use of the dirhams - like all early medieval coin finds - as evidence for fluctuations in trading patterns or even as evidence of trade at all. Stray finds of one or two coins made outside an archaeological context need have nothing to do with the date when they were (according to their inscriptions) struck. They may have reached the area in which they were discovered long afterwards, entering the earth later still. Hoards, defined as finds of not less than 20 coins, 8 are a less random form of evidence in that their constituent parts can tell us something about the date when they were deposited. Unfortunately, many of the hoards known for Russia were reported in the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, and were not systematically described before being dispersed. Only fractions of several once-large hoards have been published, and the 'youngest' coin in these remnants of hoards may not have been the youngest in the original hoard. So it cannot be taken for a reliable guide as to the date when that hoard was deposited, a function which many archaeologists are willing to give to the youngest coin in reasonably large and accurately described hoards. Moreover, a hoard deposited for long-term safe keeping or as a religious offering might contain coins of a particular sort, perhaps long treasured as an heirloom or favoured on aesthetic grounds. So the inferences made from even a fully studied hoard about the date of its deposit contain an element of hypothesis.\n\n8 T. S. Noonan, 'Ninth-century dirham hoards from European Russia: a preliminary analysis', in M. A. S. Blackburn and D. M. Metcalf, eds, Viking-Age Coinage in the Northern Lands.

In north-west Russia there have been found several hoards of dirhams whose youngest pieces date from the late eighth or the first quarter of the ninth centuries. In one of them, the youngest coin dates from as early as 786-7. If one makes the common, if contentious, assumption that only ten to fifteen years elapsed between the date of issue of the youngest coin and its deposit, one may conclude that dirhams were trickling into the north-west by c. 800. Hoards possessing youngest coins of about the same date have been found in Central Sweden and on the south side of the Baltic. That there really is some correlation between these hoards' youngest coins and their date of deposit is suggested most spectacularly by a gold coin of King Offa of Mercia, England. Its Kufic inscriptions are said to be skilful, if uncomprehending, copies of an Abbasid gold dinar struck in 773-4, and they may be the work of an English moneyer. Since Offa died in 796, a specimen of Caliph al-Mansur's dinar was available to his moneyer in or before that year. The dinar may well have made its fairly rapid way from the Middle East to the west via East European riverways and trails. The same goes for another gold coin, struck for Offa or his next successor but one, Coenwulf. It was copied from an Abbasid dinar of 789-90 or 792-3. 9 A third new feature was the appearance in the mid-eighth century of a settlement at Staraia Ladoga. This was situated beside the inflow of a settlement at Staraia Ladoga. (See Map A). This was situated beside the inflow of the little river Ladozhka into the river Volkhov, 13 kilometres up the Volkhov from Lake Ladoga. At Staraia Ladoga in the late twentieth century only the area nearest the town is cultivated. The surrounding countryside consists of forests and enormous stretches of bog, no less impenetrable in the early middle ages. A surface area of 2,500 metres has been excavated systematically. The bottommost substratum of the lowest stratum, 'Horizon E 3 ', has been dated precisely with the help of dendrochronology, the technique which seeks to establish an absolute chronology from the sequences of tree rings discernible in the wood used for structures, paving and so forth. Dendrochronology's methods of dating are more or less free of controversy and the dating of the settlement's earliest 'micro-horizon' to the 750s has met with general acceptance. 10 Almost as certain has 9 I.

The 26 pincers, hammers, tongs and so forth found in the 'complex' have precise analogies in kits found in Scandinavia proper. In other words, persons from afar were working at Staraia Ladoga from the first.\n\nIn construction technique and lay-out the large wooden houses with heating apparatus in their centres are not dissimilar to those of indisputably Finno-Ugrian settlements, but they could as well be Scandinavian workmanship, and the virtual absence from the stratum of the eighth and earlier ninth centuries of finds of ornaments or tools classifiable as Finnic is striking. The indigenous population of the surrounding countryside was Finno-Ugrian, but it was very sparse indeed. Thus outsiders, and probably only outsiders, were the founders. This is shown most clearly by the finds of leather shoes, combs and other personal belongings characteristic of Scandinavians. The combs are found from the lowest substratum onwards. They are believed to have been made by itinerant craftsmen (see below, p. 16). 13\n\nT H E M E R G E N C E OF RUS 750-1200\n\nThe earliest types of combs are likely to have been brought to Ladoga by their owners, or were worked up on the spot: they were not objects of barter or gift exchange. For most Scandinavian adults of either sex possessed a comb, and made frequent use of it on their hair. Combs were valued, and had some decorative features, but they were not de luxe. Clay pitchers of the type known as 'Tatinger ware', made somewhere in Francia, have also been found at Staraia Ladoga - as well as at other trading settlements in the Baltic region. Scandinavian-style tools and everyday articles have, then, been found at Staraia Ladoga, and an obvious inference is that the earliest frequenters of the site were Scandinavians. They were not, though, the only ethnic group at Staraia Ladoga in the first generations of its existence: Baits were also present. 11 There must have been some activity or commodities which attracted a medley of persons to this seemingly inhospitable and previously uninhabited spot in the mid-eighth century. The question is: what? The answer comes from joining up the three above-mentioned developments in a straight line of cause and effect. Staraia Ladoga's formation may be seen as a function of the influx of silver dirhams into the north-west, while this in turn could be regarded as the consequence of the Abbasids' less belligerent policies and their striking of huge quantities of dirhams. The arrival of dirhams in the north does in fact seem most likely to have been a by-product of the Abbasids' accession and active promotion of commerce. The hoard whose youngest coin dates from 786-7 is the earliest to have been discovered in the north up to now. This suggests that exchanges between the Middle East and the far north-west started or resumed soon after the Khazaro-Arab warfare abated. The location of this hoard was none other than Staraia Ladoga, and it is not a freak phenomenon. Another apparently complete hoard, having a youngest dirham of 808, has been found to the south of Staraia Ladoga. Still more significantly, oriental coins have been excavated on the site of two successive wooden buildings at the bottom of the settlement's 'Horizon E 3 '. Thus silver coins from the Middle East were to be had at Staraia Ladoga in the very earliest buildings and in effect they constituted its basic raison d'etre. This would mean that news of the Abbasids' output of silver coins reached the shores of the Baltic within a few years. But we cannot be sure that trade between the Middle East and the fur-yielding regions to the north of the Kama ever stopped entirely. And the Swedes probably continued to go on hunting or bartering expeditions to Lake Ladoga after the sixth century, while their settlements on the Aland islands continued. They may also have been intermediaries in the long-distance connections between the Arctic north and Anglo-Saxon England: by 11 Ο. I. Davidan, 'Etnokul'turnye kontakty Staroi Ladogi V11I-IX vekov', Arkheologicbeskii sbornik (Gosudarstvennyi Ordena Lenina Frmitazh) 27 (1986), 101-3.\n\n14\n\nT H E SILVER-SEEKERS FROM THE N O R T H (c. 7 5 0 - c . 900)\n\nthe late eighth century walrus ivory was being used in Anglo-Saxon carvings. If movement of populations along the great river valleys of the northern forest zone was more or less incessant, news of traders bearing silver from the Moslem south could have travelled quite rapidly. And that silver could move fast between the Middle East and the north-west is shown by the sequence of coins in structures at Staraia Ladoga. A silver piece struck in Tabaristan in 783 has been found in a structure built over one containing an earlier Tabaristan coin, issued in 768. 12 Silver is not the only commodity of external origin to be found in the earliest substrata of Staraia Ladoga. Amber from, most probably, the coasts of the southern and south-eastern Baltic occurs in the form of small ornaments and also as unworked raw material. The lumps of amber were carved and drilled (without any heating process) into beads and pendants in workshops such as the 'complex' where the 26 smith's implements were found. Amber was highly valued and it was frequently reworked. Finds of amber are fairly plentiful at Staraia Ladoga, in stark contrast to anywhere else in the north-west. Glass beads have been found in very great profusion at Staraia Ladoga. In the lowest two substrata of 'Horizon E 3 ', the variety of shapes and colours is particularly wide, and these layers contain some of the most inherently valuable types, silvered beads and silver beads covered with light-brown glass to give the effect of gold. A workshop for glass-making has recently come to light at Staraia Ladoga and it appears to have started functioning at the beginning of the ninth century. But it probably depended on imported scrap for its raw material, and it cannot have produced every type of bead found at Ladoga. Many, probably most, of the beads represent imports. Furthermore, the beads found are too numerous to have been intended only for use by the earliest habitues of Ladoga. They were continuously being brought or manufactured so as to be exchanged for other commodities, and while at first many of them were made of silver or were of intricate construction, these types gave way during the ninth century to simpler, though still brightly coloured ones. Presumably the latter were less valuable, and reflected growth in the volume of commercial activity. This archaeological evidence points unmistakably to the original function of Staraia Ladoga. It was a trading post, and diverse crafts to service the trade were practised there. In fact, there is evidence that amber beads were being fashioned on the spot even before the first wooden structures were built at Staraia Ladoga. There may have been a brief period when workshops with drainage channels were in seasonal operation but no actual settlement had been established. Craftsmen were making things from the 750s in the forementioned 12 E. A. Riabinin, 'Novye otkrytiia ν Staroi Ladoge (itogi raskopok na Zemlianom gorodishche 1973-1975 gg.)\\ in V. V. Sedov, ed., Srednevekovaia Ladoga (Leningrad, 1985), pp. 51,73.\n\n15\n\nT H E M E R G E N C E OF RUS 750-1200\n\n'production complex', whose forge had walls of light wickerwork and lacked any solid roofing. Clearly, business developed rapidly. The decision of the 'founding fathers' then to take up permanent occupation and build a number of wooden residences and workshops would have been quixotic, had they not felt reasonably confident of at least an intermittent supply of goods to buy and to sell (see below, p. 35). The site of Staraia Ladoga was probably chosen on account of its water-communications. Downstream lay Lake Ladoga, which seems to have debouched directly into the sea in the earlier middle ages, while a few kilometres upstream lay a series of treacherous rapids. Staraia Ladoga's relative isolation, set back from Lake Ladoga itself and in a kind of no-man's-land, recommended it to outsiders seeking to enrich themselves without risk of disturbance from local inhabitants. It was bleak, yet accessible by water. Staraia Ladoga's contacts also reached far to the west, judging by the finds of Scandinavian-style combs and Tatinger-type pitchers. These are among the more humdrum of the objects which form a kind of trail, spidery but persistent, eastwards from Hedeby across the Baltic via Central Sweden or along the southern Baltic coast. The earliest firmly datable hoards of dirhams in the Baltic region, of c. 800, form a similar distribution pattern and amber, albeit a natural product on the south shore of the Baltic, is found in only a very few other sites, notably Birka and Staraia Ladoga. Beads belonging to several of the types known in Ladoga have been found in ample quantities at Birka. Their place of manufacture is uncertain, but at least some types were probably made in the Rhineland or elsewhere in Francia or the Mediterranean basin. These scattered bits of evidence imply a nexus of long-distance exchanges and ventures which were essentially for the purpose of gain. They were not primarily objects of gift-exchange between members of ruling or noble elites. The combs made of bone or deer antlers are particularly suggestive in this respect, for they belong to types which have been found as far west as Dorestad in Frisia, York and Dublin. They were everyday objects, of less value than ornaments of precious metal, and so less likely to be kept in use, or on display, indefinitely. They were therefore sensitive to changing fashions in design and decoration and, one might suppose, responsive to the peculiarities of local tastes. Yet combs of the same date show a striking uniformity of size, proportions and ornament. It seems that they were made by itinerant craftsmen who shuttled constantly from trading post to trading post in the Scandinavian world. Using materials which they obtained on the spot, they worked up these combs for local customers. 13 13 K.

Hedeby is thought to have been occupied as early as the mid-eighth century. The traditional date for the foundation of Birka, c. 800, is now open to revision, partly because some of the combs found there are identical to examples found in the earliest substratum in Staraia Ladoga. It appears possible that Birka may have been functioning as a settlement as early as the mid-eighth century. 14 It is not certain that these two settlements were from the first involved in long-distance trade, but the connections of Birka, in particular, with Staraia Ladoga are obvious and it is probable that demand for silver stimulated other significant commercial activities such as the manufacture of beads and dealing in amber. A furnace for melting glass to make beads, together with numerous moulds and other materials from metal workshops, have been found in the early, central, part of the settlement at Hedeby. It is possible that some of these products were destined for sale in markets such as Staraia Ladoga. Hedeby probably owed its commercial significance to its position on a convenient route for the transport of goods by river and, for a short distance, overland across the neck of the Jutland peninsula. Finds of Arab silver coins in Hedeby or points further west are rare, but we have already noted Offa's 'dinar' and, from 789, Charlemagne's edicts pay considerable attention to the imposition of new standards of weights and measures; around the same time a new, heavier, silver denier was introduced into the Frankish lands. 15 Access to a new supply of silver from the east would be one explanation of why fuller recourse to this metal now seemed feasible. The overall weight and the quantity of the goods in play was not, however, very great, judging by the totals of finds of 'imported wares' and tools found in strata of the eighth and ninth centuries at Staraia Ladoga. The number of persons directly involved in handling them was correspondingly small. This was the case in the earlier stages of settlement at Birka and Hedeby, too. The round-the-year residents at Birka probably amounted to no more than 700-1,000 men, women and children - and perhaps considerably fewer. Numbers were swollen by visitors to the markets, and there were most probably winter fairs at Birka to which full- and part-time traders and itinerant craftsmen could bring their wares. Likewise, Staraia Ladoga's settled area does not appear to have been extensive, even after expansion during the ninth century (see below, pp. 58-9). But the limited scale of these exchanges raised the kudos attached to, and the price placed upon, luxury goods, above all, silver: scarcity generated value. The physical constraints on 14 H. Clarke and B. Ambrosiani, Towns in the Viking Age (Leicester, 1991), pp. 63, 75. 15 R. Hodges and D. Whitehouse, Mohammed, Charlemagne and the Origins of Europe (London, 1989), pp. 109-10.\n\n17\n\nT H E M E R G E N C E OF RUS 750-1200\n\ntrading were immense: the carrying capacity of the boats was modest and it was only worthwhile for Frisians or Scandinavians regularly to brave the seas if there was a robust enough demand for high-priced goods obtainable from the east. Clearly, such a purchasing power did exist in Charlemagne's Francia. But there were few royal courts besides Charlemagne's with the patronage and revenues capable of sustaining a steady demand for luxury goods. And there were few other population or patronage centres with strong purchasing power. The scarcity of luxuries could trigger off enterprises of a different sort, piratical raids, either to relieve traders of their goods or to acquire commodities which could then be exchanged for exotic luxuries. The handful of emporia which dealt in them regularly thus stood out from their immediate surroundings. Almost from the first, the nexus to which they belonged involved elements of violence as well as exchanges by consent. It may seem rash to connect events in the North Sea with those occurring in the Gulf of Finland, but the vitality of the link provided by Birka is demonstrated by the Vita of Ansgar. This German missionary visited Birka in 830-31 and again in 852. The boatload of merchants with whom Ansgar set off from Francia on his first visit to Sweden was attacked by pirates; they lost their boats and nearly all their goods. Subsequently, Birka was the target of an exiled Swedish king, named Anund. He mustered a fleet of Danish adventurers with promises 'that there were many wealthy traders there and an abundance of every good thing and loads of money [pecunia thesaurorum mnlta]'.l(> When Anund was mollified by the 100 pounds of silver promptly offered by the merchants in Birka, his followers objected that 'any one of the merchants there possessed more than they had been offered, and that they could in no way bear such calumny'. The Vita depicts a get-rich-quick society of long-distance entrepreneurs, in which trading intermingled with raiding. Slaves were an important source of Birka's prosperity and they had been seized from distant places, in Western Europe: Ansgar encountered 'many . . . Christian captives' there. They had presumably been imported as commodities, to be exchanged for eastern silver. Wine was to be had in the town, and a pious woman named Frideburg bought some for use as a viaticum, in the belief that she was dying and for want of a priest. When eventually the rich old woman lay on her death-bed and thought of deserving candidates for her charity, the place which sprang to mind was Dorestad in Frisia, rather than Birka, where there were few poor persons; at Dorestad, in contrast, 'there are very many churches, priests and\n\n16 Rimbert, Vita Anskarii 19, in W.

[and] a crowd of the needy'. 1 7 Her daughter's journey to Dorestad in fulfilment of her wishes is treated as praiseworthy, but not extraordinary. Through their tenuous but resilient network of contacts with points such as Dorestad to the west and Staraia Ladoga to the east, Birka's inhabitants grew rich. Staraia Ladoga was most probably the principal source of the pounds of silver which attracted to Birka merchants as well as pirates. But it is questionable whether things were as insecure at Staraia Ladoga as they appeared to be to Ansgar's party at Birka. Staraia Ladoga is not even mentioned in any western source other than the Norse sagas, which are much later in date. The impression that Staraia Ladoga lay beyond most people's horizons in the ninth century emerges from the Vita of Ansgar. Journeys across the Baltic are made, but they are southwards, where King Anund and his fleet sack a town 'in the confines of the Slavs', or south-eastwards to Kurland, where first the Danes and then the reigning king of the Swedes attacked the inhabitants of, seemingly, Grobin and Apuola (see above, p. 9). The Swedes are said to have reimposed tribute which had long since lapsed. But no journey north-eastwards features in the Vita's anecdotes and Ansgar himself apparently interpreted his mission to Birka as being in fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy of salvation brought 'unto the end of the earth', as if nothing lay beyond it. 1 8 The archaeological evidence from Staraia Ladoga is incomplete, but it, too, suggests that the settlement was set apart from goings-on in the rest of the Baltic region. For Staraia Ladoga seems to have been unfortified during the first 150 or so years of its existence, and finds of weapons in the settlement and the burial-ground are not particularly abundant. There are few signs of a warrior elite capable of intervening in defence of the inhabitants, as was sometimes the case at Birka. Yet Staraia Ladoga does not seem to have paid a price for this. The conflagration which it suffered during the later ninth century may well have resulted from a raid, but it seems to have been the first major upheaval (see below, pp. 56-7). If this impression of relative tranquillity at Staraia Ladoga is valid, a question arises as to the reason for its neglect by predators. Sheer remoteness and the lack of alternative ports of call in the vicinity put a dampener on piratical ventures. There was no major trading\n\n17 Rimbert, Vita Anskarii 20, in Trillmich and Buchner, eds, Quellen, pp. 64-7. The story of Frideburg illustrates the vitality of Birka's ties with Dorestad, whether or not she was herself of Frisian stock: see S. Lebecq, Marchands et navigateurs frisons du baut moyen age, I (Lille, 1983), pp. 31-2, 61-2, 81-4, fig. 46 on pp. 198, 202. Seals-cum-amulets of Frisian merchants have been found in tenth-century sites in the eastern lands: V. P. Darkevich, 'Mezhdunarodnye sviazi', in B. A. Kolchin, cd., Drevniaia Rus'.

Moreover, the general thinness of the native population in the region had deprived raiders of easy opportunities for acquiring slaves. Nonetheless, Staraia Ladoga's stocks of silver might have been expected to attract some predators or self-styled 'protectors'. Perhaps Staraia Ladoga was shielded by its function as a kind of 'flow-valve' of eastern silver, too intricate for any one group of outsiders to master, a kind of silver goose which must not fall victim to casual destruction. This is to impute enlightened self-interest to the leaders of war-bands. But any who got as far as contemplating a raid on Staraia Ladoga probably concluded that they could easily obtain all the silver their boats could carry by other means: delivery of a consignment of slaves or furs gathered through some kind of bartering, raiding, 'tribute' or extortion in the coastal regions of the Baltic or further west. Moreover, little fame was to be had from sacking so remote an outpost. In contrast, expeditions in quest of slaves from relatively well-populated countries in Western Europe provided the slave-traders with the means to obtain silver at markets in the Baltic, and relieved them of the need to travel all the way to Staraia Ladoga itself. The number of persons who made that journey each year during the second half of the eighth century was probably tiny, perhaps less than a hundred. And knowledge about the spot where they acquired most, if not all, of their silver was correspondingly restricted. Staraia Ladoga's locale and the pattern of archaeological finds there suggest that it became the node of exchanges of considerable complexity. Produce and products converged from many directions and it was essentially as a meeting-point that Staraia Ladoga's unique economic role developed. One of the functions of its workshops, from the mid-eighth century onwards, was to produce rivets and planks for boats. From the Baltic region and beyond came slaves who could be exchanged directly for eastern dirhams. The North Sea and Mediterranean regions were probably the source of most types of beads and also provided the glass scrap for the manufacture of those made at Staraia Ladoga. Fur-bearing animals roamed the forests throughout the northern regions, but those with coats of finest quality in terms of colour, texture or thickness mostly lived in the furthest north, towards the Arctic Circle. Lake Ladoga was well connected with the far north by riverways, being linked by the Svir to Lake Onega, whence one could travel by lake and river due northwards to the Northern Dvina, itself rich in furs. The forms of barter which had probably long been in play between Swedish fur-traders and the Finno-Ugrians living near Lake Ladoga and further north could now be invigorated by the beads and inexpensive bronze ornaments stored in the new trading post. It is probable that these suppliers of furs were the main customers for the beads, although Scandinavian women, too, 20\n\nTHE SILVER-SEEKERS FROM THE NORTH (c. 750-c. 900)\n\nwore them in abundance. The use of force, or threat of force, was not of decisive advantage as a means of regularly extracting furs from the more northerly peoples. They tended to be scattered across a huge area, thus denying Scandinavians opportunities for sudden, devastating, assault. And, no less importantly, aboriginal peoples living to a large extent as hunter-gatherers were not rooted to any one spot and could permanently withdraw from areas easily reached via waterways. This is what they seem to have done, even in the relatively circumscribed vicinity of Staraia Ladoga itself. The fur-traders' task was to lure them to a meeting-point and motivate them to seek out the finest pelts. Staraia Ladoga played an essential role in this - partly as a manufacturing centre, but above all as a kind of giant warehouse, where the beads and other goods could be brought by water during the summer, stored and then, in late winter or spring, exchanged for the winter's harvest of furs. For a long time, Staraia Ladoga's role seems to have been more or less unique, a reflection upon the small scale of the trading operations. These considerations prompt two basic questions: why did the Scandinavians trouble to probe far beyond Staraia Ladoga into the interior? And what routes were used to convey the silver to the north? The original raison d'etre of Staraia Ladoga was as an aid to bartering and, unlike most of the Scandinavian settlements on the Baltic coast, it was very well placed for journeys into the interior: cargoes could be unloaded onto river vessels capable of negotiating the formidable Volkhov rapids, or ships could put in at Staraia Ladoga before sailing up another river from the south-eastern shore of Lake Ladoga. It is most probable that the silver was extremely highly valued in the period when it first began to arrive, in very limited quantities. The fact that some of the earliest types of bead contained silver suggests that the Finno-Ugrians needed substantial inducements to part with their furs (see above, p. 15). There was accordingly every reason for entrepreneurs to hasten into the interior, vying with one another for more abundant supplies of both furs and silver. This, in turn, would lead one to expect that a variety of trails was followed. Secrecy may well have been of the essence. There is no reason to suppose that these journeys were made exclusively by water, or that Scandinavians were the sole travellers. In fact, the speed with which dirhams reached Staraia Ladoga in the mid-eighth century indicates conveyance by persons well acquainted with part, or all, of the way from Tabaristan. They are unlikely to have been newcomers from the Baltic region. This raises the questions of who were the bearers of the dirhams, and whether the coins were transported in one long-haul journey, or in several stages by different traders. To this, as to so many questions about happenings in the eastern lands, the answer is that the scanty evidence does not permit a decisive answer. But a few clusters and trails of archaeological finds offer pointers to strong tendencies in what was, most probably, a far-flung and volatile series of contacts and ad 21\n\nT H E M E R G E N C E OF RUS 750-1200\n\nhoc arrangements. Thus it is clear that some Finno-Ugrian settlements near the Upper Volga were involved in the movement of silver within about a generation of the foundation of Staraia Ladoga, and probably earlier still. One of the most significant clusters was in the vicinity of Lake Nero, approximately 50 kilometres south from the Volga. Lake Nero's district became the centre of a Finno-Ugrian grouping known to the Primary Chronicle as the Mer. Near the lake has been excavated a settlement on a promontory overlooking the valley of the river Sara. Four earthen ramparts blocked off the neck of the promontory and they give the settlement the status of a 'fort'. Precise dating is not possible, for the stratigraphy of the settlement was not recorded by its excavators in the 1920s, but it seems clear that while the .site was occupied by Finno-Ugrians from the sixth or the beginning of the seventh centuries, significant enrichment in their material culture, together with expansion of the settlement, occurred some time later. In, apparently, the eighth century the inhabitants of the 'Sarskii fort', as it is known to Russian archaeologists, began to make extensive use of iron tools and spearheads and arrowheads appear. This was also the time when metal ornaments in the form of wire triangles with jingling pendants made their first appearance among the Mer of the Sarskii fort and elsewhere. This development is probably connected with the fact that three dirham hoards, deposited in, apparently, the early ninth century have been found at the Sarskii fort or nearby. They are among the earliest hoards to be uncovered outside the district of Staraia Ladoga. In the settlement on this promontory fort have been found Scandinavian ornaments and tools or weapons, two of them datable to the beginning of the ninth century, or earlier still. The only other place where both early hoards of oriental silver and Scandinavian objects of c. 800 or earlier have been found is Staraia Ladoga. They probably attest a Scandinavian presence at the Sarskii fort rather than simply the import of objects of exchange. These are not, however, sure signs of permanent settlement. 19 The elasticity of archaeological periodization precludes a decisive answer to the questions: did the coming of the Scandinavians trigger off the other developments, or were Scandinavians drawn to the area by the presence of silver there already? But the materials for an answer may come from the fact that the Sarskii fort is not situated on a major river. The region of Lake Nero was fertile and the fish in the 19 On the beginnings of the Finno-Ugrian settlement at the Sarskii fort, and the Scandinavian objects (and also dirhams) found in and near it: Ε.

It was, most probably, for reasons such as this that a number of settlements arose there, as they also did in the vicinity of Lake Pleshcheevo, about 40 kilometres to the south-west. But the very fact that these districts were, so to speak, oases of human habitation amidst largely unpopulated forests made them convenient points of exchange. And for those local inhabitants familiar with the rivers, lakes and crossing-points, there was fairly easy access to the Volga and, in the south, to the Kliazma, which flowed into the Oka. On the other hand, the region could have had no inherent attraction for persons travelling from Staraia Ladoga on 23\n\nT H E M E R G E N C E OF RUS 750-1200\n\na route which took them along the upper reaches of the Volga. If Scandinavians frequented the Sarskii fort and other settlements of the district, it was not because they were obvious stopping-places for voyages down or along the Volga. They probably diverted there because the Sarskii fort was already a local centre of exchanges. It straddled different routes from the one straight down the Volga towards the Caspian: south-eastwards from Lake Ladoga up the rivers Sias or Pasha and along rivers such as the Mologa, then across the Volga-Oka basins towards the steppes; or southwards via the river Kostroma from the fur-rich river valleys of the far north, for example the Northern Dvina. It is likely to have been the ready availability of furs and silver which attracted travellers to the Sarskii fort. So the Scandinavians were probably not the prime movers of the exchanges. They were not even an indispensable cog in the movement of furs and silver dirhams. The key personnel were the hunters and trappers possessing local knowledge of the fur-runs and breeds of animal in the neighbourhood, whether around Lake Nero or in the distant north. The Scandinavians did not bring essential new nautical technology to the peoples of the interior, seeing that furs could be heaped on light, flat-bottomed river craft, or rafts. In any case, it is far from certain that boats were the sole or even the principal means of conveyance of furs during this early period of exchanges. Arabic and Persian geographers regarded fast winter travel by sleigh and ski as characterizing trade in the northern lands known to them best, those of the Volga Bulgars and the peoples beyond them. 2 0 In the region between the Upper Volga and the Oka, the days of snow cover average 140 per year. Late autumn and early winter is also the season when the fur of squirrels and other fur-bearing animals is at its thickest and finest. These considerations suggest that in the eighth century routes may have run from the far north and the north-west to the region between the Volga and the Kliazma, perhaps revitalizing a more ancient one. But their direction south of the Kliazma has not been determined and anyway there were probably various alternative trails towards the dirhams' sources. There is most probably commercial significance in the numerous hoards of dirhams found near the Middle and the Upper Oka, a notable concentration being around the settlement which grew, during the eleventh century, into the town of Riazan. The hoards nearly all occur on the right, southern bank of the Oka, or on its southern tributaries. They form an elaborate curve around the head-waters of the Don, where it spearheads a broad salient of 20 On the Volga Bulgars' use of sleighs and skis to cover great distances and to transport goods to the far north, see J.

This could have served as a convenient meeting-ground between forest-dwellers and inhabitants of the steppe. Such suppositions would remain just that, were it not for the evidence of several dirham hoards along the Don and the Severskii Donets, and further south. Their location is suggestive in itself, but the dates ascribed to the earliest hoards and their composition are even more striking. The three earliest hoards from the Don and the Kuban steppes date from c. 800, while dirham hoards first appear in the southern Caucasus region around the same time. Since the late eighth and early ninth century is also the date of the earliest hoards in or near Staraia Ladoga, and the Sarskii fort hoards are datable to the early ninth century, the obvious inference is that the distribution pattern of these roughly contemporaneous hoards registers the principal route by which the Staraia Ladoga dirhams reached the north. Such an inference gains support from a study of the date and composition of these early hoards. They indicate that the principal area where the dirhams left Moslem territory was Caucasia. Taking into consideration the other indicators, one may conclude that their route further northwards ran along the rivers Don or Donets, passing the white stone 'fortresses' of the semi-nomadic peoples living in the Khazar ambit. 21 This conclusion gains support from finds of a variety of rock-crystal and cornelian beads of similar, and sometimes identical, types at Birka, Staraia Ladoga and burial-grounds in Dagestan. The cornelian beads are found in 'Horizon E 3 ' at Staraia Ladoga, and they occur in sites in Dagestan - the northern Caucasus, encompassing the port of Darband - from the sixth or seventh century onwards. Over 10,000 examples have been found in the burial-ground of Agach-Kala and they have long been known to archaeologists. Finds of small cornelian pendants carved in the form of a 'dung-beetle' have also been made in roughly contemporaneous sites in Birka, Staraia Ladoga and Dagestan. The examples from Sweden and Dagestan are very similar in design. Such pendants are extremely rare in sites of the ninth to eleventh centuries, and this alone would suggest a special relationship between the places where they are found. The question of where exactly the cornelian was worked up into ornaments — Dagestan, Iran or India remains unanswered. But the probability that their route northwards, together with that of the beads and dirhams, ran along the Don and the Donets valleys seems overwhelming. Some of the objects 21 In five of the six fairly fully published Russian hoards of the late eighth or early ninth centurics, southern Caucasian dirhams are among the youngest coins in the hoard. It is most likely that these dirhams were added to the other pieces as the latter were being conveyed across the Caucasian lands: Noonan, 'Why dirhams first reached Russia', 155, 159, table II on 161, 163, 165. On the white stone 'fortresses' and the Khazars, see below, pp. 79-84.\n\n25\n\nT H E M E R G E N C E OF RUS 750-1200\n\nwere probably manufactured or worked up in the Khazar sphere of influence. Crescent-shaped ornaments of dark-blue glass are found at Verkhnee Saltovo, in the central section of the foothills of the northern Caucasus and in Dagestan. Their only other find-location appears to be in various substrata of 'Horizon E' at Staraia Ladoga, datable to between the late eighth and the late ninth centuries. Small lumps of amber are a very common find in the burial-ground at Dmitrievskoe, a fortress on a northern tributary of the Donets. These lumps, used as amulets, may well have originated in the Baltic region. 22 There is, then, evidence pointing clearly to the existence of a trade-route from the Moslem lands of the Caucasus towards the steppes north of the Sea of Azov. And there seems to have been a strong tendency for traders to follow - though not necessarily to navigate - the course of the Don northwards to the Middle Oka and the forest zone. However, this was not the sole route taken by the bearers of silver. The Severskii Donets could as well lead to the Vorskla and other tributaries of the Middle Dnieper as towards the Upper Oka. Groups of dirham hoards found between the Western Dvina and the Upper Dnieper suggest that some silver was carried this way up to Staraia Ladoga, or directly down the Dvina to the Baltic, at least by around the mid-ninth century. 23 Evidence of trade up the Volga from its mouth is much scantier. Earlier ninth-century hoards have been found on or near the rivers Kama and Viatka, which linked the Middle Volga with the far north, and a hoard whose youngest coin dates to AD 821 has been found near the Volga itself. Silver vessels of oriental origin have also been found in the regions of the Kama and the Viatka. There is no reason to deny the possibility of travel further upstream from the Middle Volga, but the lack of hoards or other silver objects reported along the 700-kilometre stretch of the Volga above the junction with the Kama contrasts sharply with the configuration of evidence on\n\n22 For find-locations of the cornelian beads and pendants, and of the crescent-shaped, dark-blue gla"
