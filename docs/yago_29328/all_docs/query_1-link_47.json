FOREWOEX) Kievan Russia — ^that is, Russia in the period from the coming of the Varangians to the Mongol invasion — is much better known to us than ancient, pre-Kievan, Russia. The student of the Kievan period has more written sources at his disposal than the ancient era provides and, in contrast to the preceding period, Slavic documents occupy an important place among those sources. Moreover, the Russians of the Kievan period were themselves already interested in their history; the first history of the Kievan period was written by a contemporary, in the early twelfth century. Since then the Kievan period has been covered in all major histories of Russia and in the course of the nine- teenth and twentieth centuries several generations of historians have studied in more detail various aspects of life and civilization in that period. A revival of interest in Kievan Russia is particularly notice- able in Soviet historiography and many valuable monographs have been added recently to those published before the Revolution. Thus, at first glance, the task which the student of Kievan Russia faces seems not as difficult as that of exploring ancient Russia, and yet the study presents enough riddles and moot problems of its own. While there are contemporary written documents which constitute important evidence, they are few compared with those which are available for the study of western Europe for the same period, and the gaps left are often too wide to be fully bridged. Also, while there exists ample literature on many important topics in Kievan history, there are gaps in it too, and in many cases there is no consensus of scholarly opinion even on major problems. I have therefore had to offer my own interpretation of many aspects of Rus- sian history of the period. Though not every reader may accept my solution on all points, I hope that the attempt at reappraisal of dis- puted historiographical issues and criticism of sources may help to- ward a better understanding of Russian history. The conscientious reader may wish to turn to the sources himself in order to obtain a more immediate acquaintance with the society described and to use his, or her, own judgment in understanding its life. It is fortunate that at least three of the major sources for the study of Kievan Russia are now available in English. The so-called vi KIEVAN RUSSIA Russian “Primary Chronicle” {Book of Annals) has been translated by the late Samuel H. Cross and published by the Harvard University Press (1927). Cross has also prepared a new translation of the Lay of Igor’s Campaign which is to appear in the “Igor Volume” of the Annuaire de I’Institut de Philologie et d’Histoire Orientales et Slaves (1948). The most important juridical document of the period — the oldest Russian Code of Laws (Pravda Russkaia) has been translated by the author of the present volume. This is published in the collec- tion entitled Medieval Russian Laws (Records of Civilization, No. 41 [Columbia University Press, 1947] ) and the reader of Kievan Russia may well use it as a companion volume to the present one. A few words should be said concerning the organization of this volume. Chronological narrative alternates in it with a systematic treatment of various aspects of Kievan civilization. The last chapter is an attempt to give a general picture of the interrelations, in the Kievan period, of the Russians and other nations in order to help to understand Russia’s specific gravity in the medieval world. The disad- vantage of this organization is that it makes some repetitions un- avoidable. The author believes, however, that the advantages of the method outweigh its inconveniences, since no adequate idea of the development of a nation — the Russian nation in this case — can be obtained from a mere chronological survey of facts. As in the preparation of Ancient Russia, I have profited much from the help and advice of friends and colleagues. Roman Jakobson was kind enough to read the entire manuscript. His comments and sug- gestions, in philology as in other matters, have been invaluable. Among the problems discussed with him was Slavic paganism, on which I also had the advantage of consulting Walter Bruno Henning and Vsevolod Basanoff. It goes without saying that none of these scholars is responsible for any of the unorthodox conclusions con- tained in this book. George P. Fedotov let me read his Russian Re- ligious Mind: Kievan Christianity in manuscript and, while I am un- able to accept all of his conclusions, I have profited greatly from the reading. I wish also to express my gratitude to Jacob Bromberg, Nicholas N. Martinovitch, and Vladimir F. Minorsky for valuable suggestions, and to Pierre E. Kovalevsky and Sergius Yakobson for bibliographical references. Last but not least, I am indebted to my irife, Nina Vernadsky, for assistance in preparing the section on Rus- sian music. The map has been drawn by Nicholas N. Kriianovskv of the American Geographical Society. FOREWORD vii The author’s thanks are also due to the staff of the Yale University Library for their kind cooperation; to the Editorial Department of the Yale University Press and to Miss Annabel Learned and Mrs. Frank McMullan for their assistance in preparing the manuscript for the printers. Acknowledgment of their courtesy in granting permission to quote from books published by them is hereby expressed to the Columbia University Press (quotations from J. W.

(quotation from Russian Fairy Tales). The publication of this volume would not have been possible with- out the financial support of the Hmnanities Fund of New York City, and the author wants to express his gratitude to that organization.

Geographically, Europe is but a western extension of Asia — an Asiatic promontory, as it were. In conventional school geographies, however, the area is considered a separate continent extending east- ward.to the Ural Mountains. According to this view Russia is assigned a sort of intermediate position, being. divided into two parts: “Asiatic Russia,” east of the Ural range, and “European Russia,” west of it. Thus from the point of view of elementary geography the question, “Is Russia Europe?” may be answered without much hesitation. Only part of Russia is Europe. And yet such an answer, although definite, is hardly satisfactory, since the traditional division of the country into two parts is artificial; the Ural range is low and does not break the continuity of the lath tudinal landscape zones so characteristic of the Russian geographical background. Moreover, it is not in the geographical sense that the question has been persistently asked. By “Europe” is meant not a geographical but a historical and cultural unit. The inquiry, then, should be made more specific: Is Russia Europe in the historical and cultural sense? Does Russia belong, historically and culturally, to the European comity of nations? This form of the question has been answered more often than not in the negative, in any case by non-Russians. Sir J. A. R. Marriott may be chosen as a typical exponent of the negative view. Russia is not [he writes] , and has never been, a member of the European family. Ever since the fall of the Roman Empire, and the migrations conse- quent upon Norse and Teutonic conquests, there has been a measure of kinship, despite wide diversities of development, between Scandinavians, Englishmen, Germans, Frenchmen, Iberians, and Italians. Even Poland, thanks to its adherence to the western form of Christianity, had some affini- ties with Europe. Russia during long centuries had none.’- I. Sir J. A. R. Marriott, Anglo-Russion Relations, 168^-1943 (2d ed. London, Methuen & Co., 1944), p. I. 2 KIEVAN RUSSIA Among Russians themselves there have always been two schools of opinion, of which the “Slavophiles” and the “Westernizers” of the nineteenth century may be considered the classical representatives. The Westernizers looked upon Russia as the eastern part of Europe and explained the divergencies between Russia and western Europe by a “retardation” of the historical process in Russia, due to the un- favorable geographic background, the Mongol invasion of the thir- teenth century, and various other causes. The “Slavophiles,” on the contrary, were ready to recognize the basic difference between Russia and Europe and, instead of speaking of a retardation of Russian civilization, dwelt on its originality and self-sufficiency. The chief spokesman of this school, as to the question which interests us here, was Nikolai Danilevsky. In his book, Russia and Europe, this author expounded a theory of differing “cultural types” as represented by the various nations and groups of nations in ' their history. He admitted the greatness of the “Romano-Germanic” civilization but refused to recognize it as the civilization — the only path to progress. By this theory he attempted to assert the rights of the “Slavic cultural type” to an independent development. In his opinion, the civilization which is usually called “European” should be called “Romano-Germanic.” To identify “European” with “Romano-Germanic” would be a logical error from his point of view. But, since the identification has generally prevailed, he asks himself: “Does Russia belong to Europe in that sense (i.e., to Romano- Germanic Europe)?” His answer is an emphatic “No.” ^ What position shall we take in regard to this old controversy? It may be suggested, first of all, that the very premises of the argument are now out of date, since from the point of view of the historian there is no longer a Europe in the traditional sense. In the course of the last three centuries Europe has expanded politically, each of the leading European states subjecting to itself vast territories on other conti- nents; nay, absorbing whole non-European nations. The area has also expanded demographically by emigration, as a result of which new “European” nations have asserted themselves in the Americas, in Australia, in Africa. More recently still, Europe has expanded 2. N. la. Danilevsky, Rossiia i Europa (St. Petersburg, 1871), p. 60. More recently the contrast between Russia and “Romano-Germanic Europe” has been brilliantly ifccussed by the late Prince N. S. Trubetskoy, founder of the “Eurasian” school of thought. See his Europa i Chelovechestvo (Sofia, 1920). KIEVAN RUSSIA’S PLACE IN HISTORY 3 technologically and industrially, putting in motion forces which, once released, she has hardly been able to control. As the European powers one by one — Spain, Portugal, Holland, Great Britain, France, and more recently Germany — each built for it- self a colonial empire, and as they thus stepped out of Europe proper, they finally shattered the unity of the region. While Russia acquired no colonies overseas, she expanded steadily eastward through a con- tinuous territory until she found herself controlling a vast subconti- nent. As a result of all this, several “world powers” have come to be- ing, while the core of Europe, crushed by the effects of two world wars, is now politically divided and culturally confused. What about these world powers in their relation to Europe? Is the United States “Europe”? Yes, in the sense of her cultural background and traditions; no, in the sense that she has created a civilization of her own which is now affecting Europe in its turn. Is Britain Europe? Again yes, in the sense of historical derivation; and again no, as, being the leading body of the British Commonwealth, she lives a life of her own. Is, then, Russia Europe? Yes, in the sense that her civilization has had many contacts with the European culture — even by the Romano- Germanic interpretation — since the Middle Ages. No, in the sense that she is a world apart, a subcontinent within herself, not only geographi- cally but also politically and culturally. Even world powers are transitory. The levelling effect of technology and industrialization is rapidly erasing old cultural differences be- tween single nations. The harnessing of atomic energy makes “one world” imperative, although world unity cannot be achieved over- night. To this unity each nation is destined to contribute and each has already contributed a share. Projecting this argument back into the earlier periods of history we begin to realize that one cannot gauge the whole historical process by European standards, the less so since there have always been centrifugal trends in Europe itself. To answer the question posed at the beginning of these pages, there- fore, we have first to come to common agreement on another point: What is Europe? The argument thus leads to a dead end. But the very fact that the question has been asked about Russia indicates the feeling that, if Russia is Europe, she is only partly so and that more often than not her historical ways have been different from those of other European powers. 4 KIEVAN RUSSIA It is significant that both those who would exclude her from Europe and those who would not, agree that in the course of history some basic divergencies between Europe and Russia have been revealed. When all is said, Marriott’s point of view on the complete cultural isolation of Russia is certainly untenable. Throughout, the long passage of time there have existed not only divergencies but parallels between Russian and European history, and both should be taken into account. Con- tacts between Russia and Europe have been manifold at every stage of medieval and modern development and, putting aside for the mo- ment the modern age, one may say that they were especially close in the Kievan period. 2. Russia’s Place in the Medieval World A nation’s history is conditioned not only by its own material and spiritual resources but by its international environment as well. No nation has ever been, and none is, completely isolated. This is plain enough in our day but even in earlier periods, long before the revolu- tion in means of communication, some kind of intercourse between nations was unavoidable. Owing to her geographic position, China seems to have come closer to isolation than any other country. Yet, even in ancient times, a trickle of maritime commerce connected China with India and Arabia and through the latter with the Mediterranean area; in addition, the overland commercial road through Turkestan, controlled by the nomads, assumed great importance in the Roman and the early medi- eval periods. In the Roman period, which corresponds to the Sarmatian period of Russian history, Russia was certainly not isolated; on the contrary, the proto-Russian tribes were engulfed at this time in an alien sea.’* Similar conditions prevailed in the Hunnic and Elhazar periods. In a still later age, the prosperity of the Kievan state was based on foreign commerce. The question now before us is to examine the international environ- ment of Kievan Russia and the changes it underwent within the Kievan period (878-1237). It must be emphasized at the outset that in early medieval times the dynamics of international relations were quite different from those of the modern age. The main European na- tions were already in the process of formation but the center of grav- 3. See Andent Russia, chap. III. KIEVAN RUSSIA’S PLACE IN HISTORY 5 ity, both politically and culturally, was located neither in western nor in central Europe but in Byzantium. The Byzantine Empire outstripped by far the Carolingian Empire in the field of economics as well as in diplomacy. As a matter of fact, it was one of the two world powers of the period, the other being the Moslem Caliphate. By no means could western Europe claim at this time any leading role in the advancement of science and technology. Such a role be- longed to the Caliphate, where the traditions of Hellenistic scholar- ship were being revived. Arabic became the language of leading sci- entists and physicians. To a certain extent, until the Crusades, Byzan- tium served as an intermediary between the Arabic world and western Europe. Spain, conquered by the Arabs in the eighth century, was an- other channel through which the west absorbed Arabic science. While Russia was in close contact with the nations of central and northern Europe, it was the Byzantine influence which prevailed with her, as might be expected in view of the predominant role of the Em- pire in that age. As to the Caliphate, she was deprived of any direct contact with it. It was unfortunate that Khazar control of the Pontic steppes was, from the late tenth century, replaced by that of wild nomadic tribes such as the Patzinaks and the Cumans; the fact that the Russians themselves had destroyed the Khazar Empire hardly made the situation easier for them. However, the barrier of the steppe nomads was not impenetrable and there was always some intercourse between Russia and the Chris- tian states in Transcaucasia and, through them, with Syria. Behind the steppe area dominated by the nomads also lay such important com- mercial and cultural centers as Khoresm and Bukhara. In the tenth century Bukhara was ruled by the enlightened Persian dynasty of Samanids. Later, in the eleventh century, the wild Seljuqs replaced them, undermining the level of civilization in Turkestan. In the north, the Moslem state of the Volga Bulgars, with whom the Russians were in close commercial relations, seems to have achieved not only material prosperity but also a comparatively high level of culture. Potentially, it might have served as an intermediary between Russia and the Arabic culture but it does not appear that Russia profited much by this opportunity. Economically, Russia kept lively relations with the East, both through the Volga Bulgars and through Tmutorokan, until the end of Russian control of that city in the late eleventh century. Later on. 6 KIEVAN RUSSIA the Cumans — ^in periods of peace, at least — allowed the Khoresmian and other Eastern merchants to trade with the Russians. The influx of Oriental silver to Russia ceased, however, about a.d. iooo, probably in connection with the overthrow of the Samanids by the Seljuqs. The era of the Crusades (1096-1270) brought about radical changes in the international situation. Byzantium’s power was now de- clining and that of the west ascending. In 1204 the western knights conquered and mercilessly sacked Constantinople, after which a “Latin” empire was established in Greece, to last until 1261. Russian commerce, which in the earlier period had gravitated toward Con- stantinople, now shifted to the western markets. Politically, through Hungary, Poland, and Bohemia, Russia in the period of the Crusades became involved in European affairs much more closely than she had been in earlier times. Now belligerent, now peaceful, the Russians in their relations with the west succeeded dur- ing the twelfth century in establishing a kind of equilibrium in eastern and central Europe. This balance was upset in the early thirteenth century by the formation of German crusader states in Prussia and Latvia. Simultaneously the Mongols gave their first warning by a raid into the Cuman steppes in 1223. To siun up, the international constellation in the Kievan period, so far as it affected Russia, was favorable to her in the south, less so in the west, and decidedly unfavorable in the southeast, where con- stant nomadic raids sapped her strength and drained her resources. 5 . Divergent and Parallel Trends in Russian and European History The division of “universal history” into the ancient, medieval, and modern ages is one of the traditional generalizations which become almost meaningless with closer approach, especially from any truly universal point of view — that is, taking into account the historical de- velopment not only of Europe but of other continents as well. As a matter of fact, the conventional division was formulated with only the history of Europe in mind, and only in regard to European history has it any meaning. In Europe the Middle Ages were the era of feudalism par excellence. Feudal institutions developed as a result of the degeneration of the Roman Empire, its disintegration under the pressure of the “bar- KIEVAN RUSSIA’S PLAC^ IN HISTORY 7 barians” — chiefly Teutons — and an adaptation of Teutonic institu- tions to the Roman and vice versa. Not all of the Roman Empire was destroyed, however, in the catas- trophes of the fifth century — only its western half. In the east the Empire survived to last for another thousand years under the name of Byzantium. The development of the Byzantine Empire was in turn affected by new social and political trends and gradually some institutions similar to the feudal appeared in the east but never as- sumed such momentum as in the west until the conquest of Constanti- nople by the Crusaders. In the period of the so-called “Latin Empire” (1204-61), feudal institutions of the western t5q)e were transplanted wholesale to Greek soil. But the restoration of the Byzantine Empire once more checked this process of feudalization. As we turn farther east, certain feudalizing tendencies are notice- able in the social organization of the Moslem states but these were of a different pattern from the western. As to the nomadic tribes of the Eurasian steppes, they lived in an entirely different environment, not only geographically but economically and socially as well. While Russia was never part of the Roman Empire (so much we may concede to Marriott) , the Antes and other proto-Russian tribes were in some contact with the northeastern fringe of the Empire, as in the Crimea, for example. In the later period Russia was drawn into the Byzantine orbit both economically and culturally. On the other hand, the Russians lived from time immemorial in close contact with the steppe nomads; they were at times almost submerged in the Iranian and Turkish sea. The steppe empire thrived on commerce, and the protection of the transcontinental overland roads, especially the “silk road” from China to the Mediterranean, was always one of the primary tasks of the steppe emperors. One might well expect that, built on a different foundation, Russia’s economic and social structure in the early Middle Ages would be different from the European. And so it was in many respects. As is convincingly shown by Henri Pierenne, the Arab conquest of North Africa, Sicily, and Spain severed for a time commercial rela- tions between Western Europe and the Levant,^ and it was the urge to open new roads to the Orient which guided the Norsemen in their audacious drive from the Baltic Sea to the Azov region. In Carolingian 4. Henri Pirenne, Economic and Social History of Medieval Europe (New York, Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1937) ; also Medieval Cities (Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1925) and Mohammed and Charlemagne (New York, W. W. Norton & Co., 1939), by the same author. 8 KIEVAN RUSSIA Europe (from the eighth to the tenth century) trade was at its lowest level in long ages. Carolingian feudalism had as its economic founda- tion an impoverished agricultural civilization and, with all due reser- vations, the growth of early feudal institutions corresponded to the establishment of a “natural,” or “closed,” economy. Against this agrarian and feudal Europe, Byzantium with her ex- tensive commerce and profitable industries stood out in bold relief. “Money economy” and not “natural economy” prevailed in the By- zantine Empire. Note that Italy, from the Age of Justinian, was partly controlled by Byzantium until at least the tenth century. Economi- cally, in the Carolingian period Italy belonged to the Byzantine world rather than to the European. Russia was likewise a part of the Byzantine world, besides being directly connected with Oriental commerce. Although, contrary to the opinion of Kliuchevsky and his school, agriculture was as important an element of Russian economics as commerce, the sociological impli- cations of its development in that period were not the same for Russia as for the West because of the closer connection in Russia between the two spheres of activity, especially in the form of a lively grain trade. In any case, in Kievan Russia as in Byzantium, a money econ- omy prevailed over natural economy. And, in contrast to the West, not the feudal manor but the city was the dominant factor in the coun- try’s economic and social development. But if there were important divergencies in the Middle Ages be- tween the sociopolitical development of Russia and of western Europe, there were also many similarities. In Kievan Russia the regime of “commercial capitalism” was superimposed over a primitive tribal and clan society. The early social organization of the Slavic and Teutonic tribes was similar in many respects, as a result of which there are striking parallels in the old customary laws of the Slavic and Teutonic peoples. The early version of the Kievan code of laws — the Russian Law (Pravda Russkaia, or Lex Russica ) — may be con- sidered, together with the Lex Salica and other western Leges, as be- longing to the same general type of “Barbaric Laws.” There were also many similarities in the organization of princely administration. In Russia as in the west, the public administration of the rulers developed out of their household administration. The rise of the maire du palais (Major Domus) in the Frankish monarchy in the seventh and eighth centuries is but one of the characteristic ex- pressions of this process. In Russia as in the west, the prince tried to KIEVAN RUSSIA’S PLACE IN HISTORY 9 assert his authority by granting special protection to his assistants in the management of his estates. The Pravda of laroslav’s sons has many a common feature with the Capitularia of the Carolingian kings. Politically there was, however, a great difference between a ruler’s authority in the west and in Russia. Both the prince in Russia and the king in the west had to share their rule with a powerful aristoc- racy but, in addition, in Russia there was a third important political element lacking in the west at the time: the city. 4. The Notion of East European History So far I have spoken of the Europe of this period as if it were a single socio-political body. Actually, various nations lived together there, whose. integrated or similar functioning was only relative. The universal church and universal empire are commonly considered the two pillars of unity in medieval Europe, feudalism being recognized as its third fundamental institution. However, we must not forget that the area in which these three factors were at work did not cover the whole region geographically. More often than not, when we speak of “medieval Europe” we mean western and central Europe only. The alleged “universal empire” — the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation — ^was actually not uni- versal but local, since it was counterbalanced by the Byzantine Em- pire in the southeast. Nor was the Roman Catholic Church universally recognized; many an east European nation preferred Greek Ortho- doxy. And, as we have just seen, the economic and social foundations of the Byzantine east were markedly different from those of the feu- dal west. It appears that we must recognize the existence of two medieval Europes rather than one — a western and an eastern Europe. Of these, the historical role of eastern Europe has long been underestimated. Even now, in general outlines of medieval history, by “Europe” west- ern Europe is usually meant, while eastern Europe is treated as a superfluous appendix, if at all. Ethnically, western Europe is populated for the most part by Latin and Teutonic peoples, eastern Europe by Slavs, Greeks, and a num- ber of other groups. In the neglect of east European history, racial prejudice, especially the Teuton’s traditional contempt of the Slav, must have played a not inconsiderable role. It is significant that even such a powerful thinker as Hegel could find no room for the Slavs in his Philosophy of History. As he explains, 10 KIEVAN RUSSIA These peoples did, indeed, found kingdoms and sustain spirited conflicts with the various nations that came across their path. Sometimes, as an advanced guard — an intermediate nationality — they took part in the strug- gle between Christian Europe and unchristian Asia. The Poles even lib- erated beleaguered Vienna from the Turks; and the Slavs have to some extent been drawn within the sphere of Occidental Reason. Yet this entire body of peoples remains excluded from our consideration, because hitherto it has not appeared as an independent element in the series of phases that Reason has assumed in the World.® To what extent German nationalist theories have influenced even modern American scholarship may be seen from John W. Burgess’ Foundations of Political Science, first published in 191 7 and reprinted in 1933. In that author’s opinion both the Greeks and the Slavs have manifested “a low order of political genius,” because of which it is “absolutely necessary that the political organization, in highest in- stance, of the Greek and Slav nations should be undertaken by a foreign political power.” ® He then suggests that the Teutonic na- - tions “as the political nations par excellence” should “assume the leadership in the establishment and administration of states.” One reason for the possibility of such advice from an American scholar is precisely the lack of understanding of the historical role of tlie Greek and Slav peoples. In regard to the Greeks, old ignorance and prejudices have long since been overcome by the splendid development of Byzantine stud- ies. Since the labors of the great Du Cange and others in the seven- teenth century, the Byzantinological tradition has been kept alive by a number of French and Belgian scholars, as well as by Russian, Ger- 5.

Hegel, Sdmtliche Werke, H. Glockner, ed. (Stuttgart, 1928) , XI, 447, It must be noted that Hegel foresaw the possibility of a great future for the Slavs and especially for Russia. In his letter of November 28, 1821, to Boris von Yxkuell, a Baltic German and a Russian subject, he writes as follows: “You are fortunate to belong to a country which occupies so great a place in the field of universal history and which undoubtedly has an even higher destiny. It seems that other contemporary states have more or less reached the goal of their development; it is possible that they have already passed their peak and their position has become static. Russia, on the contrary, potentially already the mightiest state of all, carries in her womb immense possibilities of further develop- ment of her intensive nature.” See Kuno Fischer, Geschichte der neuern Pkilosophie Vni, Part I (Heidelberg, 1911), pp. 118-119; also D.

II KIEVAN RUSSIA’S PLACE IN HISTORY man, British, American, Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, Polish, Czech, Bulgarian, and Yugoslav Byzantinologists, and of course by the Greeks themselves. Tremendous progress has been made in this , field in the last fifty years and the great historical role of Byzantium has now been clearly revealed. Byzantium, however, was but one of the political and cultural cen- ters of eastern Europe in the Middle Ages. The church schism pre- vented Roman Catholic peoples such as the Poles from accepting the cultural leadership of the Byzantines. On the other hand, while pledging allegiance to Rome, the Poles — as well as the Hungarians — belonged geographically and economically to eastern Europe, not to the west. They may be said to have constituted an east European group of their own, with which a number of other peoples, such as the Lithuanians, the Belorussians, the Ukrainians, and the Romanians, were in close contact. Moreover, the peoples of this area maintained a lively intercourse with central Europe, in particular with the Czechs and the Slovaks. It is the Polish sphere of cultural influence, then, which may be called the nucleus of eastern Europe in the late Middle Ages and early modern period. And it is to the Polish, Ukrainian, and Czech historians that the credit must go for setting the problem of east European his- tory as an independent branch of research. The first chair of east European history in a European university was founded in 1894 in Lvov, western Ukraine (then Lemberg in Austrian Galicia). Its first holder was the prominent Ukrainian scholar Michael Hrushevsky (Grushevsky). In 1904 he published a valuable study on the interrelation between Russian history and the history of the eastern Slavs, in which he treated the Ukraine as a part not of Russia but of eastern Europe.® In the interval between the two world wars the problem of east European history was the subject of a lively discussion in which several Polish and Czech historians took a prominent part.® The main point in the debates was how to establish 8.

She is indeed a predominantly Slav nation but is she an organic part of eastern Europe? Are we to include Russia in the group of eastern European nations or not? When it comes to modern times it is obvious that Russia is a unit by herself, and by Russia I mean here the Soviet Union, including both Ukraine and Belorussia. What was the situation in the Middle Ages? In the late Middle Ages — that is, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries — both the Ukraine and Belorussia were part of the Polish-Lithuanian federa- tion; both, therefore, may be conveniently placed in eastern Europe from the political point of view. In the Kievan period, the Ukrainian and Belorussian lands be- longed to the Russian federation and their place in history must be considered together with that of all Russia. As the territory of Kievan Russia did not extend beyond the limits of “Europe” from the con- ventional point of view, there is no formal objection to including it in “eastern Europe.” This would be rather misleading, however, and little would' be gained by it for our understanding of either Russian or east European history. In spite of her ties with the Balkans on one hand and with Hungary and Poland on the other, Russia even then formed a distinct sociopolitical body of her own. Moreover, historically Kievan Russia was the nucleus of the later continental, “Eurasian” Russia. From tlie geopolitical point of view the area of the Kievan state may be defined not only as “eastern Europe” but likewise as “western Eurasia.” Cul- turally, Russia may be thought of in this period as the northern frontier of Byzantium. 5 . The Challenge of Geopolitics The expansion of Russia resulted in her occupying a vast and con- tinuous territory stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific and from Pamir to the Arctic Ocean. This subcontinent is best called “Eurasia,” not only because it comprises parts of both Europe and 193s. pp. 1-20; November, pp. 204-233; 0 .

These zones have played and, to a certain extent, still play an important role in Russian economics. No less significant have been the political implications of the interrelation between the forest zone and the steppe zone. The latter, together with the adjacent des- erts, served in old times as the abode of various nomadic hordes of Manchu, Mongol, and Turkish extraction. Powerful steppe empires were built in this zone from time immemorial, following upon each other with brief intermissions.^^ The steppe zone stretches from Mongolia westward to the Car- pathians and has an extension into the middle Danubian area. In old times it offered an excellent road for the Mongolian nomads, with no natural obstacles to bar their way until the Carpathian Mountains. Once a nomadic military empire had established itself in the Eurasian steppes, it tended to subject to its control the whole steppe zone as well as at least portions of the adjacent forest-steppe area. At times, instead of one huge empire, a belt of lesser khanates dom- inated the steppes, some of them allied among themselves, others opposing each other. Thus after the fall of the Hunnic Empire the Avars established themselves in Hungary, the Khazars and Magyars in the north Pontic area, and two Turkish khanates in Kazakhstan and Mongolia. In the late ninth century the Magyars migrated westward to the middle Danubian area (present-day Hungary) and a century later the Elhazar Empire was destroyed by the Russians. But the Russians were not able by themselves to control the Pontic steppes, since new Turkish hordes were constantly pushing from Kazakhstan; after con- testing the steppes against the Patzinaks they were pushed northward by the Cumans. Then, in the thirteenth century, the Mongolian inva- sion flooded the whole of European Russia. The Mongol Empire was vaster than even the Hunnic and the Mongols united the whole of Eurasia under their authority. After the emancipation of Russia from the Mongol yoke the process was gradually repeated in reverse, with the result that in the course of 10. See P. N. Savickij, Sestina sveta (Prague, 1933). 11. See Ancient Russia, pp. 64, 63, 78-84, 123, 123, 178, 179, 206, 213. 14 KIEVAN RUSSIA time the Russians succeeded in uniting under their own authority most of the area of the former Mongol domination. It is interesting to note that in their drive the Mongols had ad- vanced westward through the steppe zone and while advancing had gradually extended their authority to the forest zone. The Russians, on the contrary, expanded eastward through the forest zone and only after controlling it penetrated into the steppe and desert zones. Bearing all this in mind, let us now consider the position of Kievan Russia from the geopolitical point of view. In the Kievan period the Russians occupied the European part of Russia only, and not all of that. In the south they at first extended their control to the Crimea and the Azov and lower Volga regions but lost those areas by the late eleventh century, when they were compelled by the Cumans to evacu- ate the steppe zone and retreat northward to the forest-steppe and forest zones. In the east the middle Volga region was held by the Volga Bulgars, with whom the Russians were in close commercial relations from the ninth century and with whom from time to time they also clashed. In the beginning of the thirteenth century the east Russian princes showed their obvious intention of subjecting the Bulgars to their control as a preliminary step to controlling the whole course of the Volga River. But their drive was barred by the Mon- gols, who conquered both Bulgars and Russians. Even if the jRussians failed to control all of European Russia in the Kievan period, the space they occupied seems large enough, espe- cially as compared with the areas of their European neighbors. Geo- graphically, the Dnieper riverway was the pivot of Kievan Russia and the Russians had access to both Baltic and Black seas, although the Cuman raids made the use of the Black Sea precarious. ^ Speaking in terms of geopolitics as represented by Mackinder and his followers, the Russians in the Elievan period controlled a consid- erable portion of the European “heartland,” ygt, in spite of this, proved unable to parry the Mongol invasion. One reason for the vul- nerability of their position was their failure to round out a full control of the heartland; had they succeeded in controlling the whole course of the Volga River as well as the southern steppes they would have been in a much better position to meet the Mongol onslaught. 12. H. J. Democratic Ideals and ReaUty (New York, H. Holt, igig; 2d ed., 1942) ; K. aushofer et al., Bausteine zur GeopoUHk (Berlin-Grunewald 1028I • KIEVAN RUSSIA’S PLACE IN HISTORY 15 Another cause of the Russian disaster in the thirteenth century was the fact that Russia was subjected to simultaneous pressure from both east and west. The German drive from the west assumed mo- mentum exactly in the period of the Mongol invasion from the east. But perhaps the main cause of the Russian failure was the lack of protection of the heartland on the eastern side. The Eurasian steppes represented the real heartland in the conflicts of that period. Owing to the westward extension of the steppe zone, European Russia was geopolitically a part of Eurasia and prior to the era of military artil- lery there was little hope, if any, for the Russians to stop the nomads once the latter were united. The Kievan period was one of disunity among the nomads; though suffering from Cuman raids, the Russian people were at this time in no real danger of being crushed by them. But the Mongol invasion overthrew the balance of power between forest and steppe zones in favor of the latter. The lesson which the Russians drew from the Mongol yoke was that security from the nomadic east could be obtained only by con- trolling Eurasia altogether. To that goal they approached gradually and by stages. The eastward expansion started in the middle of the sixteenth century; Russia’s first move was to secure control of the whole course of the Volga River. Within the next century all Siberia was occupied. The colonization of Siberia was a spontaneous move- ment of Cossacks and trappers rather than a formal military con- quest but the Muscovite statesmen knew how to take full advantage of the popular movement. In the case of the expansion into Kazakh- stan and Turkestan in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the initiative belonged to the government rather than to the people. In the course of the same period the southern steppes, as well as the Crimea and the Caucasus, were conquered — or, if we may refer here to the events of the tenth century — reconquered. Thus the task which the Russians failed to achieve in the Kievan period was completed. d. The Significance of the Kievan Period in Russian History Old Russia is usually associated, in the mind of tlie American reader, with autocracy and serfdom. It has even been suggested that totalitarianism emanated directly from the “Russian soul.” And, indeed, in 1833 a Russian, Count S. S. Uvarov, proclaimed that Rus- sia rested upon “Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality.” Looking i6 KIEVAN RUSSIA back to Uvarov’s time with the benefit of our knowledge of subse- quent events, we know that, when he made his statement, undiluted autocracy had less than four score years to live. Serfdom was abol- ished less than thirty years after Uvarov’s declaration. In fact, during the whole imperial era (i 721-19 17), periods of re- action alternated with those of liberalism. The last twelve years of the imperial regime were those of constitutional experiment, however limited in scope. But even prior to that, since 1864 autocracy had been somewhat checked by the local institutions of self-government {zemstvo) and a well-balanced judiciary. Irt the tsardom of Muscovy of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies, the authority of the tsar was limited, actually if not legally, by a people’s assembly {zemsky sobor), a system of local self- government, and the church. Simultaneously, democratic institutions flourished in the Cossack communes, especially in the Zaporozhie and the Don Host. The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were the period of the forma- tion of the Muscovite state. The nascent Muscovite autocracy was itself subordinated to a much more rigid and implacable absolutism — ^that of the Mongols — and the power of the Moscow grand dukes was partly shaped on that forceful pattern. However, in the Mongol period Muscovy controlled only a corner of present Russian terri- tory, the central Russian “Mesopotamia”; that is, the basin of the upper Volga and Oka rivers. Other Russian lands at this time had a different political and social milieu. Paradoxical as it may seem, the Mongol age was the period of blossoming of democratic institutions in the north Russian city-states of Novgorod and Pskov, in spite of the fact that north Russia was under the nominal authority of the Mongol khans and that the grand duke of Moscow was more often than not elected prince of Novgorod. In Ukraine the Mongol domination came to an end in the middle of the fourteenth century— that is, about a century earlier than in Mus- covy; in Belorussia the period was even shorter. These two nations eventually ex^anged Mongol rule for that of the grand duke of Lithuania, while the western Ukraine (Galicia) was occupied by Po- land in 1349' ^385 ^ union was formed by Poland and Lithuania, at first dynastic only, to become a real union later on. ^ In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the grand duchy of Lithu- ania was a loose federation which the Ulcrainian and Belorussian ands Joined as so many autonomous units. An aristocratic constitu- KIEVAN RUSSIA’S PLACE IN HISTORY 17 tion was eventually established and thus, in contrast to both auto- cratic Muscovy and democratic Novgorod, an aristocratic Ukraine and Belorussia asserted themselves. These three elements of power — ^monarchic, aristocratic, and demo- cratic — ^which in the Mongol period developed separately in three distinct geographic regions of old Russia, coexisted in each of the Russian lands during the Kievan period in various proportions and combinations in each case. It is this variety of political experience which makes the Kievan period a fascinating study for the student of government. Thus a glance at the political history of Russia is sufficient to dis- pose of the myth of totalitarianism’s being inherent in the Russian mentality. It was not because of any alleged innate sympathy of the “Russian soul” to autocracy that the tsardom of Moscow came into being but out of the stern necessity of organizing a military force suf- ficient to overthrow the Mongol yoke and then of securing control of a territory vast enough for strategic defense. In the fifteenth and six- teenth centuries Muscovy became a military camp. The energy of both rulers and people was concentrated on defence. Political freedom was sacrificed for national survival. It is probable that the Russians would have emancipated them- selves from, Mongol domination much earlier than they actually did, had they not been threatened simultaneously from the west. Faced by the dilemma of war on two fronts, two Russian princes of the thir- teenth century each tried an opposite course of policies. In western Ukraine Prince Daniel of Galicia made a bid for the support of the west, and lost. In eastern Russia, Prince Alexander Nevsky accepted Mongol suzerainty in order to have his hands free in the west, and won. By defeating the Swedes at the mouth of the Neva River in 1240 he secured to Novgorod an outlet to the Baltic. Two years later he saved Russia from a German invasion by crushing the German knights in the famous “battle on the ice.” Serfdom was another price paid by the Russians for the sake of survival. Although slavery existed in both Kievan and Muscovite Russia, slaves did not represent a large proportion of the population. In Kievan Russia it coexisted with a “capitalistic” economy just as in the United States prior to the Civil War. On the other hand, serfdom as a feudal institution was hardly known in Kievan Russia. In the Mongol period the process of attach- ing free peasants to the large estates made rapid progress in both 1 8 KIEVAN RUSSIA Muscovy and Lithuanian Russia. Serfdom was officially introduced in Ukraine and Belorussia by the charter {privilei) of the Grand Duke Kazimierz of 1447. In Muscovy, from 1581 certain years were proclaimed “prohibited”— that is, no migration of peasants from one estate to another was allowed in these years. Serfdom was finally con- firmed by the Code of Laws (Ulozhenie) in 1649. As a contrast to both Muscovite and Lithuanian states, Kievan Russia was a country of free political institutions and free interplay of social and economic forces. The Kievan period was also that of the Christianization of Russia; it witnessed the rise of a brilliant civiliza- tion, revealed especially in architecture, literature, and applied arts, such as filigree and enamel. While the Mongol invasion administered a heavy blow to Kievan institutions and culture and resulted in the formation of an abso- lutist state in Muscovy, the development of the elements of Kievan civilization was not altogether stopped. Some traditions of the Kievan period evolved in Novgorod and Pskov, others in Ukraine and Belo- russia; still others in Muscovy itself. From the point of view of legal history, the foundations of the charter of the City of Pskov (1397- 1467), the first Lithuanian statute (1529), and to a certain extent even the first Muscovite Code of Laws (Sudebnik) of 1497 are to be sought in the Russian Law of the Kievan period. Besides the positive achievements of the Russian people in the Kievan period, life in Kievan Russia had many negative aspects as well. Constant raids of the Turkish nomads from the southeast as well as the internecine wars between Russian princes harassed the population and made life insecure more often than not. The ever- widening gulf between the upper and the lower classes resulted in periodic economic and social crises. In spite of all its deficiencies, however, Kievan Russia was warmly cherished in popular memory, as manifested by the Russian epic songs — ^the byliny. No other era of the country’s history is referred to in Russian folklore with so much S3nnpathy and gratification as the Kievan. There must have been something in Kievan Russia which made people forget its negative side and remember only its achievements. That “something” was the spirit of freedom — individual, political, and economic — ^which prevailed in the Russia of that day and to which the Muscovite principle of the individual’s complete obedience to the state was to present such a contrast. Chapter II THE IMPERIAL PLAN AND ITS FAILURE, 878-972 I. The Imperial Plan: Dreams and Realities The political history of Kievan Russian opens with a century of bold adventure: with an attempt on the part of the Norse rulers of Kiev to build up a vast empire stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea and from the Carpathian Mountains to the Caspian Sea. A series of daring campaigns was undertaken, both by sea and by land, with Constantinople and Transcaucasia as the two main objectives; at one time the mouths of both Volga and Danube were controlled by the Russians. This ambitious effort may be considered from two angles — as an episode of viking expansion and as a stage of Russian history. Toward the close of the ninth century the vikings controlled both the North and the Baltic seas and not only raided adjacent parts of the Euro- pean continent and the British Isles but were able to establish them- selves firmly in northwestern Europe. Even earlier, as we know, they had entered Russia and penetrated as far to the southeast as the Azov region. Cruising along the western shores of France and the Iberian peninsula, they also explored the Mediterranean and even- tually built a state of their owm in Sicily. Constantinople — Miklagard, the Imperial City — ^was the focal point where the Black Sea and Mediterranean drives eventually met. It is against this background of the adventurous spirit of the vikings that the imperial dreams of the Russian princes of Kiev should be studied. Amazing as is the wide range of their political plans, it fits well into -the general picture of Europe in this period. However, we must not forget that by the end of the ninth century the Norse new- comers in Russia had already merged wnth the native population to a considerable extent, becoming part of the Russian background. This is particularly true of the Swedes in the Azov area, who borrowed their very name — Rus’ — from the natives.’^ That name was now assumed by the Kievan Norsemen as well. Sviatoslav, the most dar- I, See Ancient Russhf pp. 274-275. 20 KIEVAN RUSSIA ing of the first Kievan princes, not only bore a Slavic name but both in physical appearance and in attire was a typical Slav of the south, a prototype of the Zaparozhie Cossacks. His grandson laroslav the Wise had few Nordic features, if any, anthropologically speaking. And, while the bulk of the druzhina or retinue of the first Kievan princes consisted of Norsemen, Slavs were not excluded from it and both Norsemen and Slavs were interested not only in war but in com- merce as well. The Russian Slavs had old traditions both of long-range military campaigns and of international trade behind them, beginning at least as far back as the sixth century when the Antes penetrated into the Danubian area. In the seventh century some of the Antian tribes firmly established themselves in the eastern part of the Balkan penin- sula, later to be known as Bulgaria. In the seventh and eighth cen- turies the Antes and the Rus’ helped the Khazars to ward off Arab raids on the Caucasus.^ Under the auspices of the Khazars the Antian Slavs took active part in international commerce, and from Mas’udi and other Oriental authors we know that Antian-Slavic merchants had permanent quarters in the Khazarian capital Itil and presumably in other Khazar cities as well. Antian-Slavic troops constituted an important element in the Khazar army.® It thus appears that the Norse princes of Kiev must have found considerable support to their imperial plans among the upper classes of the Slavs. In their imperialist undertakings plunder was a pre- liminary to trade — the driving motive of the imperial plan of the first Kievan princes was essentially commercial; their strategy aimed at the control of a vast network of commercial highways in the Pontic and the Caspian areas. Geographically the cornerstone of this system was the Azov region, more specifically Kerch Strait, already held by the Russian kagans since the late eighth century. To round out the structure they needed control of the lower Volga and lower Danube areas. In case of the complete success of their undertakings, the seizure of Constantinople — that is, of the Bosporus and the Darda- nelles — ^loomed as the crowning prize. However, their attacks on Constantinople were motivated not so much by the hope of capturing it as by a desire to compel the Byzantines to open their markets to the Russian trade. We find here an exact parallel to the aspirations of the Huns in the past. The last Byzantino-Hunnic war, in the late fifth 2. Idem, pp. 220, 2S9, 260, 273, 3. IdeMt p. 214. 21 THE IMPERIAL PLAN AND ITS FAILURE, 878-972 century, was the result of the refusal of the Byzantines to throw the Danubian market towns open to the Hunnic commerced Command- ing the Black Sea and entrenching themselves in Bulgaria, the Rus- sians would be in position to dictate their conditions even without actually controlling Constantinople. Thus even a partial realization of the imperial plan promised rich rewards. But, if the driving motives behind the great plan and the advantages expected from it were obvious, so were the tremendous difficulties to be overcome. First of all, there were two centers of Russian action in the period — Kiev and Tmutorokan — ^and, while a certain degree of coordination between the policies of the princes of Kiev and the Russian kagans must have been reached, it was not so easy, if pos- sible at all, to achieve complete unity. Furthermore, the Kievan realm consisted both politically and socially of heterogeneous elements, not to mention ethnographic variations. The authority of the Kievan prince was recognized at first by only a few Russian tribes. Later, other tribes were brought within the Kievan political sphere but some only reluctantly; thus in some cases the link between Kiev and local centers was weak and unstable. There was a great divergency between single tribes in regard to their respective economic and cultural levels and even greater di- vergency within each tribe. While the upper classes in most cases could be interested commercially in the projects of Kievan princes, the bulk of the population was rather indifferent. We have here the traditional contrast between cities and rural communes. Some of the tribal aristocracy, moreover, must have been suspicious of Kievan imperialism. Thus Prince Oleg and his immediate successors had a twofold task before them: to organize their own state and to lead their campaigns of conquest. Each of the tasks was in itself tremendous; in addition, in their foreign policies the attention of the first Kievan princes was perforce divided between the Byzantine Empire and the Khazar kaganate; either problem, again, was one to require the full attention of the Kievan rulers and, for the successful solution of either, vast resources were necessary. As it proved in subsequent events, the princes did not have strength enough for a' war on two fronts: against Byzantium and against the east. Sviatoslav came closer to success than any of his predecessors but overreached himself and ended in failure. Yet his victory over 4. Idem, p. 151. 22 KIEVAN RUSSIA the Khazars had fateful consequences for Russia, since the breaking of the Khazar kaganate opened the gates for the Patzinaks, to be followed by other Turkish tribes from beyond the Caspian Sea, and neither Sviatoslav himself nor his successors had sufficient power to prevent the Turkish flood from spreading over the Pontic steppes. 2 . First Successes: Oleg Around the year 878 Oleg, originally ruler of Novgorod in north Russia, seized Kiev and eventually established his authority in south Russia.® It is he rather than his predecessor in Novgorod, Riurik, v/ho may be considered the first Norse prince to become the sovereign of all Russia. For this reason if for no other, the personality of Oleg made a deeper impression on the historical memory of the Russian people than that of Riurik. In the Russian chronicles as well as in oral tradition Oleg is known as Veshchi, the Far-Sighted, the Wise, the Holy. This epithet seems to have originated from a play upon the meaning of the name in the Norse; Helgi (the original Norse form of Oleg’s name) means “the Holy”; the Russian adjective Veshchi is thus but a translation of Helgi. In Norwegian, Oleg Veshchi is called Helgi Helgi. In Russian tradition Oleg is glorified as a wise ruler and a successful warrior; he is particularly praised for his shrewdness in dealing with his enemies. The story has it that after his victorious campaign against the Greeks, which brought him to the gates of Constantinople, the Greeks opened negotiations by sending him choice food and wines. With quick penetration Oleg refused to partake, feeling that both food and wine were probably poisoned. Whereupon the Greeks aban- doned treachery and accepted his peace terms. With this wisdom of Oleg the last legend concerning him — that of his death — ^is in obvious contradiction. According to the legend, popu- larized by the poet Pushkin in his magnificent “Song of Oleg the Wise,” the ruler had been warned by a sorcerer that his death would come through his steed. Impressed by the prophecy, he took care not to ride it. Later, being shown the horse’s carcass, he stepped upon it, abusing the sorcerer; at that moment a snake crept out of the carcass and bit him, causing his death.® The legend is obviously didactic, its object to prove that even the wisest man is helpless before Fate. The same idea was poetically 5, Idem, pp. 363-368. 6. Cross, pp. 150, 15s. THE IMPERIAL PLAN AND ITS FAILURE, 878-972 23 expressed in the famous Lay of Igor’s Campaign of the twelfth cen- tury: “And said Boian the sagacious poet: ‘Neither a shrewd and successful man, nor a fledgeling can escape the God’s judgment.’ ” It is characteristic that the Russian legends of Oleg, including that of his death, have close parallels in the Norse saga of Odd, The saga has it that Odd died — of snake bite — in Norway, whither he allegedly returned after his Russian exploits.® It is patent that Kiev could not be the final objective of Oleg’s drive from the north. It was to serve him as a base for further cam- paigns southward aimed at opening paths to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, with Transcaucasia and Constantinople as his ultimate goals. However, his immediate task was to make the base itself suf- ficiently strong and his control over the riverways between Novgorod and Kiev absolutely secure. According to the Book of Annals it was Riurik who began to build a network of forts in the lands of the Slo- vene, the Krivichians, and the Merians ° — that is, in the regions of Novgorod, Smolensk, and Rostov. Bands of Varangians were stationed in the newly built forts and the three tribes had to pay tribute for their maintenance. Thus, Oleg had only to follow Riurik’s policy to con- solidate his authority in the north. The Kievan base itself was enlarged by his conquest of the Drev- lianians, a warlike tribe whose abodes were at this time in the Pripet basin, northwest of the land of the Polianians, that is, of the Kiev region proper. Oleg imposed on them a tribute in furs (around 880 A.D.). Further expansion to the south and southwest, down the Dnieper and the Bug rivers, was barred by the Magyars. The lands east of the middle and lower Dnieper were controlled by the Khazars. The Khazar problem was the first to be approached by Oleg. Like his predecessors in Kiev, Askold and Dir, he must have been anxious to establish a connection with the Russian kaganate in the Azov and Tmutorokan region. Presumably in the first or second year of his reign in Kiev, Oleg partly succeeded in this undertaking. His envoys and possibly some of his troops sent along to reenforce the army of the Russian kagan may have used the riverways extending across the steppes from the Dnieper bend to the Sea of Azov. Encouraged by the help received from Oleg, the Russian kagan 7. Slovo, p. 37- 8. A. I. Liashchenko, “Lctopisnye skazaniia 0 smerti Olega Veshchego,” ANORI, ap (1924)1 2S4-28S. 9. Hyp., col. IS. 24 KIEVAN RUSSIA sent a plundering expedition to the Caspian Sea, which landed at its southeastern corner in the Mazendaran region around the year 880. The expedition ended in disaster, however.^® Obviously the situation called for a closer union of forces between Kiev and Tmutorokan. In order to achieve this, Khazar control over the Slavic tribes east of the middle Dnieper had to be done away with. And, indeed, Oleg’s next move was to extend his authority over these tribes. Around 882 he defeated the Severians, after which they discontinued their tribute to the Khazars and instead agreed to pay a “light tribute” to Oleg. Impressed by his victory over the Severians, the latter’s neighbors to the northwest, the Radimichians, voluntarily agreed (885) to pay to Oleg the tribute they had hitherto paid to the Khazars. In this case the tribute was in silver coins (shcheliag ) . At that juncture Oleg’s attention shifted to the southwest. The chronicler mentions vaguely that he waged war against the Ulichians and the Tivertsi, two south Russian tribes who inhabited the lower Dniester and Bug basins.^^ Both tribes were at the time to a certain extent controlled by the Magyars and we may assume that in their opposition to Oleg they acted as vassals of the Magyar voevoda Arpad. Thus, while the chronicler presents that conflict as a war between Oleg and the two south Russian tribes, it must actually have been a war between Oleg and the Magyars. The Magyars controlled at this time the whole southwestern cor- ner of the Ukraine — the basins of the lower Dnieper, Bug, and Dnies- ter rivers. Previously, one may suppose, the Magyar voevoda had also been suzerain of Kiev, where Askold and Dir acted as his lieu- tenants or vassals.^® Oleg’s seizure of Kiev meant the end of Magyar authority over it and, after his murder of Askold and Dir, the rela- tions between Oleg and the Magyar voevoda must have been strained. Each side had its claims against the other. Presumably the Magyars meant to recover their hold on the Kiev region; the new ruler of Kiev, on the other hand, needing access to the Black Sea, had either to come to terms with the Magyars or to push them out of his way. The conflict between Oleg and the Magyars, the Ulichians, and the Tivertsi must have taken place around 890, in any case not later than 893, for in the next year the Magyars were already engaged in 10.

Ancient Russia, pp. 341, 342. THE IMPERIAL PLAN AND ITS FAILURE, 878-972 25 a war against the Danubian Bulgars.^® Judging from the tone of the passage alluding to it in the Book of Annals, the war between Oleg and the Magyars was indecisive. It is to Byzantine diplomacy that the initiative in arranging for a Magyar invasion of Bulgaria around 894 may be ascribed. To quote the Book of Annals, Emperor Leo the Wise “hired” the Magyars against the Bulgars, who at this time threatened the safety of Byzan- tine possessions in the Balkans.^^ The Bulgars were defeated and their country plundered. In despair they appealed for help to the Patzinaks (Pechenegi), a Turkish people whose abodes were in Kazakhstan and of whom a band was then roving in the Pontic steppes. Whether the Patzinaks managed to pierce the Khazar de- fences along the lower Volga and the lower Don or the Khazars for some reason of their own allowed them to cross the Don westward, is not known. Simultaneously attacked by the Bulgars from the south and the Patzinaks from the east, the Magyars were completely defeated (around 897) and had no alternative but to evacuate south Russia. A group of them went westward up the Danube and eventually reached Pannonia. Another group went north toward Kiev and pitched their tents on its outskirts.^® Failing to take the city, they turned west- ward to Transylvania. This group is called the “Black Ugrians” in the Book of Annals. Eventually the two groups were reunited, estab- lishing their control over the region of the middle Danube and the Tisa River — that is, over present-day Hungary (around 899).^® The occupation of Hungary by the Magyars proved a fateful event in the history of the Slavs, of which the three groups — the western, eastern, and southern — ^were now partly separated from each other by the Magyar wedge. The immediate result of the Magyar invasion was the downfall of the kingdom of Great Moravia. Most of it was occupied by the Magyars. White Khorvatia — ^that is, Galicia — ^pledged 13.

The event is dated, in both Hypatian and Laurentian versions, in 902, obviously a mistake. According to Zlatarski the war between the Bulgars and Magyars started around 894; according to Grot, around 889. I accept Zlatarski’s dating. See G. Moravcsik, Byzantinoturcica, I (Budapest, 1942) , 58-59. 15. The appearance of a Magyar horde before Kiev is dated in the Book of Annak in the year 898 (Hyp., col. 19). 16. See Grot, op, cit,, pp. 305\"337- 26 KIEVAN RUSSIA allegiance to Oleg. In the chronicler’s narrative of Oleg’s campaign of 907 against Constantinople, both the Khorvatians and their neigh- bors the Dulebians (in the Volyn region) are mentioned among the Russian tribes participating in the campaign. For Oleg the most im- portant result of the Magyar migration was that the whole Dnieper riverway from Kiev down to the Black Sea was now at his disposal. In later sources the island of St. Gregory (Khortitsa) on the Dnieper, below the cataracts, and that of St. ^therius (Berezan) in the Dnie- per estuary are mentioned as the two main stations of Russian mer- chants on their way to Constantinople. Presumably naval bases on both islands were established by Oleg immediately after the with- drawal of the Magyars. In the list of Russian tribes which took part in Oleg’s campaign of 907 we also find the name of the Tivertsi, whose abodes were at the mouth of the Dniester. They may have been conquered by Oleg in a naval expedition started from Berezan. However, Oleg’s troops may also have reached the Tivertsi from the north by descending along the Dniester from Galicia. Let us now turn to Oleg’s campaign of 907. According to the Book of Annals it was a combination of a cavalry raid across Bulgaria and naval operations.^’' In the latter, two thousand boats are said to have participated. The Russians reached Constantinople simultaneously from land and sea and the outskirts of the Imperial City were merci- lessly plundered. The Greeks barred access to the inner port of Con- stantinople — the Golden Horn — ^by chains, but according to the chronicler’s story Oleg ordered boats to be put on wheels and in this way part of the Russian squadron at least sailed overland to the upper reaches of the Golden Horn. The Greeks sued for peace, agree- ing to pay tribute and to conclude a commercial treaty favorable to the Russians. Before withdrawing from Constantinople Oleg is said to have posted his shield at the gates of the city. There is no direct mention of this campaign in Byzantine sources and many a historian has expressed his doubt of the authenticity of the Russian story. Among those who refuse to accept it are the Ger- man scholar Gerhard Lahr and the Belgian Byzantinologist Henry Gr6goire.’« However, the majority of students of both Russian and 17.

THE IMPERIAL PLAN AND ITS FAILURE, 878-972 27 Byzantine history still consider the story of the Book of Annals re- liable on the whole. The Byzantinologist George Ostrogorsky has subjected Gregoire’s views to a detailed criticism,^® the validity of which, to be sure, Gregoire is so far not willing to accept. I do, how- ever. In my opinion, the best proof of the authenticity of the story of the Book of Annals is the contents of the Russo-Byzantine treaties of 907 and 91 1. Of the first we have only a brief expose in the Book; of the second, the full text. The authenticity of the latter is self- evident, since the wording of the Russian text makes it absolutely certain that it was a translation from the Greek, showing all the fea- tures of the formal style of Byzantine documents of this kind. Now, the contents of both these treaties are so favorable to the Russians that no Byzantine emperor of this period would have agreed to sign such documents without being compelled to it by a military defeat. Furthermore, as Ostrogorsky points out, while there is no direct mention of Oleg’s campaign in Byzantine sources, some indirect evi- dence may be procured. In his book, De Cerimoniis Avlae Byzantinae, Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentions the participation of auxiliary Russian ships in the Cretan expedition of 910. These must have been sent by Oleg as a token of his friendship to the emperor.®® It may also be pointed out that in the Arabic work Taba’i al-Hayawan by Mar- vazi (written around 1120) the Russians are said to have reached Constantinople “in spite of the chains in the gulf.” As V. F. Minorsky suggests, this is possibly a reference to Oleg’s campaign of 907.®^ According to the provisions of the treaty of 907 the Greeks had to pay a huge indemnity — computed on the basis of twelve grivna for each rowlock of the two thousand Russian boats — and, in addition, to assign special funds for each of the important Russian cities (Kiev, Chernigov, Pereiaslav, Polotsk, Rostov, Liubech, “and others”). Out of these funds the Byzantine Government undertook to provide ample food for the merchants of those cities throughout the stay of each in Constantinople; also to provide them with food and all necessary equipment for their boats for the return trip from Constantinople to Russia. During their visits at Constantinople the Russians were to be quartered in a suburb of the city, near the Church of St. Mamas. 19. G.

KIEVAN RUSSIA 28 They were allowed to enter the city, carrying no weapons, in groups of not over fifty men accompanied in each case by a Byzantine com- missar. Characteristically enough, the Russian merchants in their commercial transactions were exempt from paying any customs duties.^^ The treaty of 907 laid the foundation for further commercial inter- course between the Russians and the Greeks. In tire treaty of 91 1 a number of juridical technicalities were added.-® The settlement of mutual offenses, murders, thefts, and other crimes perpetrated by the nationals of one state against those of the other was regulated, with special attention to the case of fugitive slaves. All provisions were made in the spirit of complete equality of the two nations. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the treaty is the promise on each side to help the shipwrecked merchants of the other. This was con- trary to the so-called “strand law” practiced in most European coun- tries at the time, by which in a case of shipwreck the local rulers were entitled to confiscate all stranded goods of the shipwrecked merchant and to enslave him and his crew. The law was abolished in Italy in the twelfth century, in England and Flanders in the thirteenth century, at first only with respect to the Hanseatic merchants. General aban- donment of the practices of strand law in Europe took place even later. 5. First Setbacks: Igor Oleg’s success in opening the Black Sea to Russian trade cleared the path for a lively commercial intercourse between the Russians and the Greeks, and on the profits from this trade the prosperity of the Kievan realm was founded. A good idea of how Russian trade with Constantinople was man- aged in the tenth century may be obtained from Constantine Por- phyrogenitus’ De Administrando Imperio?^ According to this au- thority there was a regular timetable for collecting goods and ship- ping them. In November the prince of Kiev and the members of his druzhina would start their tour of the Slavic tribes subject to tribute {poUudie) in order to collect it. From other sources we know that the main items of the Russian export trade at the time were furs, wax, honey, and slaves. All these were to be furnished to the prince of Kiev, 22.

THE IMPERIAL PLAN AND ITS FAILURE, 878-972 29 as he visited them, by the tribes subject to tribute in kind. Some tribes, as we know, paid in money. The prince and his druzhina would spend the whole winter in this way, to return to Kiev by April. Simul- taneously, the Slavs living in the upper reaches of the Dnieper would be engaged in making boats by hollowing out the trunks of trees, and as early in the spring as the lakes and rivers were free from ice these were floated down to Kiev and there sold to “the Russians” — that is, to the prince, his acol5d;es, and the Kievan merchants. Then the boats would be equipped with rowlocks and loaded. We may easily imagine the feverish activities of assembling the flotilla, in which presumably thousands of people were engaged. Each year in April and May Kiev must have looked like a great shipyard bursting with human effort. As soon as everything was ready, the flotilla moved downstream until it reached the Dnieper cataracts. There the boats were unloaded and hauled overland, together with the goods, along the bank of the river to a point below the rapids where they were reloaded. Later on, when the Patzinaks came to the Pontic steppes in strength, to pass the cataracts became a dangerous operation for the Russians; busy hauling loads, they were severely handicapped in case of a Patzinak attack. Below the cataracts the newly assembled flotilla stopped at the island of St. Gregory, where the pagan Russians sacrificed cocks to their gods under a huge oak. The next stop was in the Dnieper estu- ary, at the island of St. jEtherius, where the boats were equipped with sails. They then sailed westward along the northern shore of the Black Sea into the Dniester estuary, whence, after another stop, they cruised to the mouth of the Danube. From the Danubian delta they proceeded to Konstantsa, Varna, and Mesembria, which at the time of Constantine’s writing (around 953) was the terminal point of the Russian journey. On their return trip (not described by Constantine) the Russians carried goods of a more delicate kind — silk fabrics, spices, wines, and fruits. Since the return load required much less shipping space, part of the boats were probably sold to the Greeks and the Bulgars or simply abandoned after being stripped of rowlocks, sails, and other equipment. It is hardly possible to determine with any degree of accuracy the volume of goods shipped every summer from Kiev to Mesembria; however, it will not be amiss to speculate on it. From Constantine’s picture we gain the impression that the flotilla was a huge affair. Pre- 30 KIEVAN RUSSIA sumably it consisted of several hundred boats, possibly over a thou- sand. To be sure, they were monoxyla, as Constantine calls them: that is, each made of a single tree trunk. But such trunks, cut in the primeval forests of northern Russia, must have been enormous. Similar boats were used by the Zaporozhie Cossacks in the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries.-\" As a matter of fact, the Cossacks had boats of two kinds: river boats and seagoing boats. The Cossack word for “boat,” chaika, derives from the Turkish chay, “river,” and was applied originally to small boats only but later came to designate the other type as well. The river boat was a monoxylon pure and simple — a canoe. It was used for fishing and for carrying small loads; its capacity was ten men. Such canoes were undoubtedly used by Kievan Russians for similar purposes but a Kievan monoxylon in- tended for the Byzantine trade must have been much larger, of the tj'pe of the sea-going Cossack chaika. For this the tree trunk served as a foundation only, on which the boat proper was built of heavy oak boards. The chaika had a length of from fifty to seventy feet; its width was from eighteen to twenty feet, and height about twelve feet. It carried from fifty to seventy armed Cossacks, from four to six falconets, and ample supply of munitions and food. It was equipped with a mast and twenty to forty oars. Assuming that the boats of the Russian flotilla of the tenth century were similar to the Cossack sea- going boats and that the annual flotilla consisted of no less than five hundred of them, the total load of goods shipped must have been not short of ten thousand tons. Assuming again that half the amount was used for the transportation of “live goods” — slaves — as well as for other purposes, this leaves around five thousand tons for the goods proper, as a conservative estimate. This is a small load for a commercial fleet by our standards. How- ever, it is much more impressive when compared with common medie- val practice. Even in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the total goods transported annually from Italy to Germany over the St. Gott- hard Pass — one of the main gateways of European continental com- merce in the Middle Ages— averaged i ,2 50 tons.^® The aggregate ton- nage of the Italian and Hanseatic commercial flotillas at that period was much larger but in the tenth century western maritime commerce 25. See D. I. Evarnitsky, Istoriia Zaporozhskikh Kozakov^ (St. Petersburg 1892), 1 , 454-456. 26, I. M. Kulisher, LektsH po istorii ekonomicheskogo byta Zapadnoi Evropy (5th ed, Petrograd, 1918), p. 173. THE IMPERIAL PLAN AND ITS FAILURE, 878-972 31 could show nothing comparable to the Russo-Byzantine trade. Thus, if we think of the annual Russian flotilla in the terms of Carolingian trade, we must come to the conclusion that the volume and scope of Russian foreign commerce was far above the west Euro- pean standards of the period. Constantine’s description of the Russian trade flotilla is a valuable source not only for the study of Russian commerce but also for that of the Russian state and government of the first half of the tenth century. According to this writer the core of the Russian state was in Kiev and the Kiev region alone was called Russia proper. Every- thing else was the “periphery of Russia” {exo Rossia), consisting of Slavic tribes paying tribute to the prince of Kiev.^^ However, it would be wrong to conclude that all these lands were merely Kievan colo- nies. The picture given by Constantine is not complete and must be supplemented with evidence available from other sources. First of all, it should be mentioned that the various tribes submitted to Kiev on different conditions. Some paid tribute in kind, others in money; some paid a heavier amount, others but a “light,” i.e., nominal, tribute. Then we must consider the evidence of the Russo-Byzantine treaty of 907, according to which the Greeks were obliged to assign separate funds for each of the leading Russian cities — Kiev, Chernigov, Pereia- slav, and so on. As the chronicler remarks at this point, in each of these cities sits a prince of its own. And indeed, from the preamble to the Russo-Byzantine treaty of 91 1 as well as that of the treaty of 945, we know that neither Oleg nor Igor was the sole ruler of Russia. Both in succession had the title of “grand prince” {yelikii kniaz’) of Russia but other princes are mentioned as imder the authority of the grand prince. Thus we have a feudal ladder with the suzerain at the top and his vassals beneath. Furthermore, while we know very little about the relations between Kiev and Tmutorokan at that time, from the scant evidence we have we may surmise that the latter city was still ruled by a prince of its own — the kagan. In any case, the political structure of Russia in the first half of the tenth century, although primitive, was much more complex than one might think solely from the evidence of Constantine Porphyro- genitus’ narrative. One may suppose that the degree of subordina- tion of tribal princes to the prince of Kiev differed in the various cases. Some must have been allies rather than vassals. The position of a tribal prince in provinces where tribute was col- 27* See A. Soloviev 'irKSQ TQ2IA, Byzantion, 13 (1938), 227-232, 32 KIEVAN RUSSIA lected in kind by the grand prince himself was probably the hardest. However, even in such cases there must have been a definite agree- ment as to the share of the grand prince in local collections and if the agreement was violated on his part the local prince was entitled to resist, as we may see from the story of the death of Prince Igor in the Book of Annals. Let us now turn our attention to Igor and his policies. According to the tradition Igor was a descendant of Riurik and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the tradition. However, one may guess that he was Riurik’s grandson rather than his son as stated in the Book of Annals. Under Oleg, Igor must have played a totally subordinate role. He is mentioned only once, on the occasion of his marriage, and even here it is stated that the alliance was arranged by Oleg (903). Igor’s wife was Olga, a native of Pskov. Her name is Scandinavian but she must have been a Slav girl as will be explained presently. While Igor is portrayed in the chronicle with little sympathy, his wife is glorified as “the wisest of women.” As Olga eventually became a Christian, her popularity with the chroniclers may be easily ex- plained. However, neither Oleg’s nor Sviatoslav’s paganism deprived those princes of the chronicler’s praise. There must have been some- thing in Igor’s nature which caused the chronicler’s coolness toward him. In the story of his death he is portrayed as a greedy and treach- erous man. He probably was. According to the Book of Annals, Igor and Olga had but one son, Sviatoslav. At the time of Igor’s death (945) he was an infant, born in 942 according to the Laurentian chronicle. If the date of Igor’s marriage in the Book of Annals (903) is to be credited, Olga must have been in her late forties, or even in her fifties, at the time of Sviatoslav’s birth, even if we suppose that she had been a mere girl at the time of her marriage.. We are led thus to think that Sviatoslav may not have been her first child. If we admit that he might have had elder brothers, we may tentatively identify one of them as “Halgu, King of the Rus” mentioned in a Hebrew document, the so-called “Letter of a Khazar Jew of the Tenth Century” first published by Schechter in 1912. Of him more will be said at the close of this sec- tion. Suffice it to note here that Halgu is obviously the same name as Helgi, in Russian pronunciation Oleg. According to the Book of Annals Prince Oleg died in 913 (perhaps in 912). It seems probable that after bringing his negotiations with Byzantium to a successful conclusion and securing the Black Sea for THE IMPERIAL PLAN AND ITS FAILURE, 878-972 33 Russian commerce, he must have shifted his attention to the Caspian Sea and Transcaucasia. For this, close cooperation between the Kievan Russians and the Tmutorokan Russians was essential. In 909-10 sixteen Russian boats, presumably sent by the Tmutorokan kagan, appeared along the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. The Russians attempted a landing at Enzeli but were repulsed.^® This was clearly a reconnoitering expedition to be followed by a real campaign, for which preparations must have started immediately afterward. The campaign took place after Oleg’s death (913). His successor Igor must have personally led his druzhina to Tmutorokan, the nat- ural base for the drive. However, he did not go farther, the news of the revolt of the Drevlianians compelling him to return to Kiev with part of his entourage. The other part remained in Tmutorokan, whence the Russians went up the Don River to the Volga portage and down the Volga to the Caspian Sea. They received the permit of the Khazar kagan for the expedition in return for a promise of a share in the booty. The Russians plundered the southwestern shores of the Caspian, using the Apsheron peninsula (the Baku region) as their base of supplies and for storage of booty. They maintained the base for several months, after which, their ships heavily loaded with pltm- dered goods, they set forth homeward. In spite of the fact that they sent the kagan his agreed share, as soon as they entered the Volga estuary they were treacherously attacked by his guards and com- pletely defeated. According to Mas’udi around thirty thousand Rus- sians perished and only few escaped (914).^® Meanwhile Igor crushed the revolt of the Drevlianians, imposing on them a heavier tribute as punishment. His troubles were not over, however, for in 915 the Patzinaks invaded Russia (that is, the Kievan land) for the first time. Somehow an agreement was reached and they retired to raid Bulgaria. Five years later (920) they appeared again and Igor had to fight them. From these brief statements in the Book of Annals it may be seen that at this time the Patzinaks did not yet represent any real danger for Russia. Their main horde was still east of the Volga. Subsequently, in Igor’s Balkan campaign of 944, the Patzinaks acted as his allies. There is no information in the Book of Annals about Igor’s policies from 920 to 941. Presumably this was a period of peace during which 28. Dorn, pp. 4-6. 29. Idem, pp. vi-viii, is, 16, 28; Markwart, pp. 333 - 33 S- KIEVAN RUSSIA 34 the Russians accumulated strength for further expeditions against both Anatolia and Transcaucasia. The Book describes only the Ana- tolian campaign (941); Arabic sources speak of the Russian cam- paign in Transcaucasia (943-44), while Hebrew documents throw some light on the connection between the two. Let us start with Igor’s Anatolian campaign.*® Asia Minor was at this time a part of the Byzantine Empire. The reasons for Igor’s break with the Greeks are not known; his naval expedition to Anatolia in 941 was apparently a joint undertaking of the Kievan and Tmutoro- kan Russians. The “Letter of the Khazar Jew” mentions the name “Halgu, King of the Russians,” in connection with the Russian war against the Greeks and the subsequent “withdrawal” of the Russians to “Persia” (Transcaucasia).®* According to my conjecture, Halgu, or Oleg, was Igor’s son. He could not have been king of tlie Kievan Russians, since the Kievan throne was occupied by Igor himself. Therefore we may suppose that he was king, or kagan, of the Tmu- torokan Russians. The Russians landed on the Anatolian shore of the Black Sea and plundered the Byzantine provinces of Bithynia and Paphlagonia, penetrating as far west as Nicomedia before the Byzantine generals had time to muster sufficient troops to repel the invaders. When the latter took to their ships, their flotilla was attacked by the Byzantine naval squadron and easily defeated by the use of the famous “Greek fire.” ®® It appears that, while Igor himself returned to Kiev, the bulk of what remained of the Russian army went to Tmutorokan, whence two years later they undertook a campaign against Trans- caucasia. This time the rich city of Bardaa in Azerbaijan proved to be the main objective of the Russian drive. Thus the Russians in this case followed the path of the Savarti, who attacked Bardaa between 7 50 and 760. By my conjecture, the Savarti may have been Swedes.®® The Russian campaign in Azerbaijan is described in detail in the 30. Cross, pp. 157-158. See also K.

THE IMPERIAL PLAN AND ITS FAILURE, 878-972 35 Arabic chronicle of Ibn-Miskawaih who lived in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries (died ca. 1030). He writes: “In this year A.H. 332 [a.d. 943-44] the army of the nation called the Russians invaded Adharbaijan, where they attacked and seized Bardha’ah, taking its inhabitants captive. They are a mighty nation with vast frames and great courage. They know not defeat, nor does any of them turn his back till he slay or be slain.” As they approached the city the Russians issued the following proclamation: “There is no dispute between us on the matter of religion; we only desire the sovereignty; it is our duty to treat you weU and yours to be loyal to us.” Since the city refused to capitulate, however, the Russians stormed it and ordered all the population to evacuate it within three days. Those who remained after that term were either slain or obliged to pay huge ransom. Using Bardaa as their base the Russians plundered the country around it and amassed immense booty. They spent several months there but were eventually surrounded and defeated by superior Mos- lem forces. Their commander was killed in battle. Finally the rem- nants of the Russian army “made for the river Kur where the ships in which they had issued from their home were in readiness with their crews. They embarked and departed, and God saved the Mos- lems from them.” Now, in the Hebrew document quoted before it is said that King Halgu perished “in Persia” with most of his troops. We may assume, then, that the “commander” of the Russians mentioned in Ibn- Miskawaih’s story was Halgu. The disastrous result of the Transcaucasian campaign and the loss of his son Oleg (if Halgu was his son) did not deter Igor from another attempt to strike at Byzantium. According to the Book of Annals he hired a band of Varangians “across the sea” (i.e., in Scandinavia) as well as a horde of Patzinaks to reinforce his Kievan troops. Of Slavic tribes, the Slovene, the Krivichians, and the Tivertsi agreed to par- ticipate in the campaign.®® In the summer of 944 Igor’s army reached the banks of the Danube River, where they were met by the envoys of the Byzantine emperor 34.
