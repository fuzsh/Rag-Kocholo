Daily e-schmoozing about our favorite movies eventually led to academic questions about the peculiarities of Russian melodrama. We solicited answers from our other Webmates and, instead of holding a conference, came together @style. Fear not, though, that technology rationalized relations and factored out feelings. The Web turned out to have the same fundamental structure as melodrama, a crisscross of private and public concerns, coincidental twists of fate, some excess emotions, and several crossed paths. We thank all of those who deepened our appreciation of Russian melodrama. There would never have been a book in the ﬁrst place if not for two ﬁlmmakers who inspired our passion for melodrama, Evgeny Bauer and Douglas Sirk, and two actresses who made it unforgettable, Vera Kholodnaia and Dorothy Malone. Our contributors inspired us with their creative answers to our original questions, and they did so with extraordinary eﬃciency and good cheer.We are sincerely appreciative of the institutions that have come to respect the importance of popular culture in academics and supported our research: the International Research and Exchanges Board (irex), the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies, and the University of Hawai‘i and the University of Texas Faculty Development Programs. In Honolulu, Linda Engelberg actively collected sources of prerevolutionary popular culture, especially movie melodramas, and Matthew and Michael Kunihara assisted with the illustrations. In Austin, the Uni-\n\nversity Cooperative Society generously awarded the volume a Robert H. Hamilton subvention grant. We thank our editors at Duke University Press: Valerie Millholland, Miriam Angress, Jonathan Director, and Jean Brady. We thank our friends, the heros and heroines of our lives: Laurie Bernstein, Judy Coﬃn, Margot Henriksen, Val Kivelson, Lynn Mally, Dan Orlovsky, Don Raleigh, Jim von Geldern, Bob Weinberg, and Reggie Zelnik. Our families deserve far more than thanks: these protagonists of our private lives oﬀer us, their captive audiences, an embrace of excess and ambiguity that keeps us engaged in every scene; to Charters, Max, and Joel Wynn, and to Alice, Betsy, and Rebecca McReynolds, inﬁnite gratitude. Above all, we thank each other for the years of performing supporting roles in the melodramas of each other’s life.\n\nx Acknowledgments\n\nImitations of Life\n\nLouise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger Introduction\n\nNot one of the books that later made Nikolai Nikolaevich famous was yet written. . . . He passionately sought an idea, inspired, graspable, which in its movement would clearly point the way toward change, an idea like a ﬂash of lightning or a roll of thunder capable of speaking even to a child or an illiterate. He thirsted for something new. —Boris Pasternak, Doctor Zhivago1 Sirk has said: you can’t make ﬁlms about things, you can only make ﬁlms with things, with people, with light, with ﬂowers, with mirrors, with blood, in fact with all the fantastic things that make life worth living.—Rainer Werner Fassbinder2\n\nEnter the world of Russian ﬁlmmaker Evgeny Bauer and you enter a world of things. Each of his popular turn-of-the-century melodramas is crammed with objects: clocks, telephones, gadgets, and statuettes clutter his desks; rooms overﬂow with sofas, chairs, and tables; long, deepfocus shots create corridors of fashionably dressed, swirling ﬁgures who occupy spaces that seem to stretch inﬁnitely toward an interior horizon; and planes of empty space are broken up by so many artiﬁcially placed architectural columns that contemporary critics ridiculed him for it. Bauer’s cult of the object, his romance with things, signiﬁed more than a Victorian cliché of accomplishment and acquisition. It was an antidote to the Russians’ nineteenth-century cult of the idea, a string of\n\nThe protagonist’s study crammed with objects in Evgeny Bauer’s Child of the Big City (A. Khanzhonkov and Col., 1914).\n\ngarlic worn to ward oﬀ the diabolical Red Domino stalking the pages of Andrei Belyi’s Petersburg. As the incarnation of the sacred idea, the alluring Red Domino makes a remarkably eﬀective trope in modern Russian history, where the intelligentsia mounted the most articulate opposition to the autocracy and designated themselves a political elite.3 In a country where intellectual exchange had to substitute for political action under an autocracy stubbornly opposed to popular expression and participation, Belyi’s symbolism in Petersburg accentuates the dominant role that culture played in Russian politics, while warning of the danger implied in Pasternak’s personiﬁcation of the intelligentsia’s faith in ideas. During the course of the nineteenth century, artists and intellectuals across the political spectrum reﬁned their uses of the idea, the singular weapon they possessed in their struggle against autocracy and backwardness. By century’s end, they had endowed thought itself with the power to resolve Russia’s perennially ‘‘accursed questions,’’ to integrate its warring classes into one harmonious society, to change the world, and ultimately to transform humankind. In essence, the prerevolutionary intelligentsia believed that culture, as they understood it, could resolve social inequities by constructing a single shared national identity. Not surprisingly, the intelligentsia also believed that by virtue of their part in possessing and creating ideas, they 2 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nmerited the leading role in society. Faith in the idea was not restricted to one or another political party but was shared by people as diverse as the ultraconservative Konstantin Pobedonostsev, the historian and liberal spokesman Paul Miliukov, and Bolshevik leaders Vladimir Lenin and Lev Trotsky. Historians and literary scholars, by and large, have accepted the intelligentsia’s aspiration to power as the driving force in the narrative of the imperial period, and they have constructed the era as a teleology, leading fatalistically toward revolution as the only event capable of realizing the idea. In the end, their aims turned out to be as furtive as the Red Domino.4 Among the cultural elite, Belyi and his percipient Symbolist colleague, poet Alexander Blok, although they were great proponents of the transcendent powers of abstractions and ideas, understood the seductive power of material desire and earthy entertainment. Belyi and Blok acknowledged the temptations of the marketplace and recognized that the existence of those whose desire for things would challenge the utopianism rooted in the cult of ideas. Belyi and Blok watched the crowds that surrounded the Red Domino on the boulevards of St. Petersburg: the growing population of peasants, workers, and bourgeoisie whose own cultural traditions and thirst for innovation had equally deep roots in Russian cultural life, and whose consumption of commercial culture was already transforming public discourses, political as well as cultural. And these crowds did not disappear in 1917, or for that matter in 1991. Commercial culture in general and melodrama in particular remain a central, if underappreciated, force in Russian society. As an alternative to the old intelligentsia’s valorization of reason, propriety, and public and political commitment, melodrama oﬀered its audiences a world of feeling, sensation, and private moral dilemmas. But for all its emphasis on the interior landscape, melodrama was by no means detached from the real world of transformation and conﬂict. In every age, setting, and medium, melodrama explored the social issues that preoccupied its audiences and oﬀered models of behavior for changing times. Both before and after 1917, as shifting lines between private and public were being drawn and the public invasion of the private was being justiﬁed on new ideological, economic, and political grounds, melodrama helped people negotiate new boundaries in social life. The Russian cult of the idea and a privileging of political thought and revolutionary ideology have obscured the genuine diversity of RusIntroduction 3\n\nsian cultural production and consumption. Just as the boundaries separating classes had become more porous by the end of the nineteenth century and social identity had become more complex, artists of the period intentionally mixed genres that had previously been associated with speciﬁc classes. Painters, architects, and musicians, for example, incorporated folklore and commercial motifs into their work. At the same time, commercial artists often larded their entertainment with social and political commentary, a device monopolized previously by belles lettres.5 In social terms, the consumers of culture were themselves becoming highly heterogeneous.6 The survival of this culture into the soviet period, when political circumstances should have written its death sentence, testiﬁes to its power and underscores the historical signiﬁcance of commercial alternatives to the utopian cult of the idea. The popularity of commercial culture in the nineteenth century indicates at least one overlooked historical path that Russia might have taken. The collection of essays in this volume examine one of those alternatives by looking at Russian and soviet melodrama, a genre perennially popular with consumers of commercial entertainment but long held in contempt by those distrustful of popular tastes. The essays presented here address the questions raised by the seeming paradox of a bourgeois cultural form in an ostensibly hostile environment. The marginalization of commercial culture, both before and after the revolution, the idealization of abstract thought over materialism and consumption, and the widespread suspicion of bourgeois, western individualism, would suggest at the very least a peculiar reception for melodrama in Russia. On the other hand, the characteristics of excess, sensation, spectacle, and affect, so closely associated with melodrama, are also deeply ingrained in Russian cultural history, suggesting conversely fertile ground for the reception of melodrama there. The essays in this volume explore the uses of melodrama by Russian writers, artists, ﬁlmmakers, and playwrights in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to ask, in part, whether there was a uniquely Russian melodrama. The modern history of melodrama in Russia stretches back to the genre’s earliest days following the French Revolution. From its origins in France in the 1790s as a speciﬁc form of staged drama, melodrama has been adapted to every artistic genre and has entered everyday life as a distinct mode of behavior. Despite its resulting diversity of forms and uses, common formulaic properties continue to give it recogniz4 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nable integrity. As Peter Brooks argued in The Melodramatic Imagination, the classical study of the 1970s that rescued the genre from two centuries of intellectual condescension, melodrama is best understood as ‘‘a mode of conception and expression, [and] as a certain ﬁctional system for making sense of experience.’’7 The particular features of this ‘‘ﬁctional system’’ consist of an aesthetic of excess and a Manichaean narrative structure, which pits good against evil in what seems today to be almost satirical extremes. Brooks understood that ‘‘melodrama has the distinct value of being about recognition and clariﬁcation,’’ a capacity that allowed it critical perspective on the issues of its age, from national politics to gender, class, and consumption.8 Simply stated, melodrama exaggerates the circumstances of time and place in which it is produced, and as a result it oﬀers a uniquely accessible mode of analysis for audiences to perceive the interaction among politics, art, and everyday life. Because melodrama is self-consciously about its own present, it oﬀers scholars a new perspective on the dominant ideologies—political, cultural, social—in which each story is set. But because the cultural elites routinely denigrated melodrama, its doubtful status made it a guilty pleasure for those who indulged in its production and consumption. In order to place Russian melodrama in a historical and international context, it is important to review the history of melodrama alongside its contemporaneous critique. Both contexts were extensively shaped by the cultural politics of their times, and shaped in turn the evolution of melodrama and of its reception. The genre’s association with the disreputable crowd dates from its inception in France following the revolutionary upheavals that began in 1789; its perseverance derived from its continued ability to make the contemporary world, especially in times of transformation, comprehensible to audiences who lacked the ability to articulate many of the ambiguities and contradictions that social change brought into their lives. Although philosophe Jean-Jacques Rousseau coined the term melodrame to underline the musical element he added to his theatrical dramas, it was his fellow countryman René-Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt, from a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent intellectual background, who produced the ﬁrst corpus of plays to be recognized as representative of this new theatrical genre. A writer with little taste for revolution but with great sensitivity to the profound changes he observed in the 1790s, Pixérécourt referred to his Introduction 5\n\nworks as ‘‘spectacular prose dramas’’ written ‘‘for those who do not know how to read.’’9 Because the oﬃcial censorship forbade spoken dialogue on the nonoﬃcial stage, Pixérécourt pioneered a new type of production that drew on traditional popular culture and the drama unfolding in the streets of France.10 He introduced special sight and sound eﬀects to engage his audiences on a fundamental sensory level, which complemented the intense emotionalism of the situations that entangled his characters. This primal sensationalism led to the accusations of escapism that have always tarnished melodrama’s successes, by those who would reduce it to its simplest elements. From the French stage the genre spread briskly across Europe and to the United States, and it spread into new media as well, especially with the advent of cinema at the end of the century.11 Melodrama raced into new territory in the wake of dissemination of ideas of the Enlightenment. One of the underlying tensions that had prompted revolution in France produced what would become a central motif in melodrama: the conﬂict between identities in the private and public spheres. The private individual, conceived during the Enlightenment as an autonomous agent, struggled to ﬁnd appropriate public identities in the emergent spheres created by new social, political, and economic institutions. The narratives of melodrama aimed to resolve these conﬂicts through emotion and happenstance rather than logic. Providence and coincidence replaced reason and social institutions as the narrative motor in these stories, which were served up in an aesthetic of excess: inﬂated emotion, stylized sets and acting, and wildly unbelievable plots. In political terms, however, excess did not generate subversion. However wild the plot, the existing order was restored at the end. This apparent stability gained western melodrama a reputation as a fundamentally conservative genre. Melodrama resolved conﬂicts by reaﬃrming rather than challenging contemporary hierarchies and was presumed, therefore, to leave its audiences satisﬁed with the status quo.12 Assumptions about the composition of the audience further supported a conservative reading of melodrama. Contemporary critics and retrospective scholars believed that its fans came from the political periphery: women and workers who had not yet developed a secure political identity derived from either gender or class. Presumptions about the political naïveté of the audience impelled these critics to im6 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nplicate melodrama in a cultural debate that had explicitly political ramiﬁcations about the relationship between high culture and low, and the relative social value accorded to each. For social critics, the image of the disenfranchised spending their meager earnings and their few leisure hours reincorporating themselves vicariously into the system that denied them access to power suggested an ignorance that bordered on complicity. The aesthetics of emotion, sensation, and excess appeared to render melodrama an irrational, escapist entertainment, prompting critics to charge the genre with undermining the rational justiﬁcations for an enlightened legal and political order. Melodrama’s reliance on coincidence to move the action toward climax also encouraged charges of political conservatism. Stories structured by forces over which the protagonists exercised no control, it was thought, could not encourage audiences to take charge of their own lives. Enlightened intellectuals’ faith in agency in the early nineteenth century, central to both representative and revolutionary politics, was drowned out by the sensationalist spectacle on the stage. Small wonder that early opponents of melodrama despaired of a genre that appeared to bolster dominant power structures and the complacency of the subordinate multitudes.13 In large measure, however, the political complexion of the audience was read backward from critics’ stereotypes about popular tastes. Melodrama’s subtle but pointed challenge to gender and class hierarchies and its engagement with public issues of morality and power eluded early critics. Indeed, over the decades changing conditions had transformed the composition of melodrama’s public as well—ticket prices, literacy skills, and the media themselves all complicated the audiences for melodrama. Nor, for that matter, were the plots as predictably uniform as critics charged. Despite formulaic aesthetics and excesses, melodrama’s makers often used the genre’s formulas in innovative ways to explore social identities and social change. Early critics misunderstood melodrama because they saw it as a debased form of the theatrical genres that they knew: tragedy and realism. However, as Peter Brooks has persuasively argued, melodrama originated as a response to the limited capacities of these two forms to address the conﬂicts ordinary individuals faced in post-Enlightenment society, where moral certitude, shaken by industrial and cultural revolution, was defending itself against the heavy artillery of secularization. Introduction 7\n\nBrooks pointed out that the distinction between melodrama and the familiar forms of tragedy and realism was paramount at ﬁrst, when melodrama oﬀered audiences a fundamentally modern theatrical mode for experiencing the changes connected with industrial and political revolution. Unlike tragedy, which for dramatic tension relied on forces that individuals could not control and, therefore, ended in inescapable ruin, melodrama mired its characters in adverse situations, but provided resolutions that restored order to their worlds. Brooks noted that in contrast to realism, and despite melodrama’s grounding in the secular and familiar, the genre fostered self-indulgent emotional expressionism over rational discourse. Generations before modernism received credit for shattering the surfaces of realism, Pixérécourt’s innovations in sensory experiences soon led artists to use an aesthetic of emotional excess to explore the content of emotions lying repressed beneath the surface rationality of realism. Melodrama, popular with those unable to articulate their own needs clearly, came to depend on nonverbal means to convey what words were inadequate to communicate. Hence the performance techniques of a heightened style of acting, with its exaggerated gestures and mannered characterizations, became synonymous with the genre. In creating a new mode for perceiving modernity, melodrama borrowed heavily from Romanticism, the initial reaction against the Enlightenment. Appealing to the visceral rather than the cerebral, melodrama drew from romantic obsessions with feelings and the occult, and from gothic novels with their dark secrets and mistaken identities. Elucidating what Brooks termed ‘‘the ‘moral occult,’—the domain of operative spiritual values, which is both indicated within and masked by the surface of reality,’’—melodrama helped its audiences sort out the ethics of a secular world.14 The characters’ inability to express themselves in words remains central, as they negotiate their conﬂicts through repression and sublimation. Because their private anxieties are rooted in public policies, the melodramatic expression of their anguish reﬂects something about the larger ediﬁces that structure their lives. As Brooks noted, melodrama anticipated the two philosophical strains that emerged in the course of the nineteenth century to address the eﬀects of both social structure and the unconscious: ﬁrst Marxism and then Freudianism.15 Like psychoanalysis, melodrama became increasingly preoccupied with the return of the repressed; signiﬁcantly, it did so in forms that linked it directly with social and political life. 8 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nOne of melodrama’s essential properties lies in its engagement with contemporaneous social issues.16 In Patrice Petro’s words, the genre oﬀers ‘‘a heightened and expressive representation of the implications of everyday life.’’17 Originally, the limited scope of such presentism contributed to its cultural marginalization because, as critics argued, melodrama located social stress within speciﬁc sets of circumstances instead of advancing universal truths about the human condition.What was intended as a reproach, however, reﬂected characteristics of melodrama’s audience and its cultural function, which historical perspective casts in a more positive light. Melodrama proved to be a medium for cultivating cultural self-awareness and self-expression for the social groups emerging from the upheavals associated with the industrial revolution.18 As Thomas Elsaesser noted, the genre was integral to the development of bourgeois identity because it provided these new classes with a ‘‘particular and socially conditioned mode of experience.’’19 This presentism, however, also constitutes an obstacle to analyzing melodrama; the typical plot’s reliance on speciﬁc moral contexts has not served individual texts well. Individual melodramas aged quickly when situations that appeared life-altering to one generation came to seem ridiculous to the next, after past conﬂicts had been resolved or became irrelevant. In the late twentieth century, historical melodrama becomes most readily accessible through the camp sensibility that has reconstituted one era’s moral occult in terms of its own.20 Paradoxically, however, presentism has proven to be melodrama’s most enduring advantage for cultural and social historians by providing documentary evidence of the social traumas of the past. As the wrenching changes of the French and industrial revolutions gave way to technological and political revolutions in the twentieth century, melodrama continued to oﬀer emotionally cathartic probing beneath the surfaces of new ideologies, and it provided dramas of identity formation to audiences eager to consume them. In so doing, these aesthetically remote texts bring the burning social and cultural issues of the past within the reach of scholars in the present. By the end of the nineteenth century, melodrama had left behind its origins on the bourgeois stage to enter many other forms of popular culture, especially literature. Literary melodrama borrowed from both the supernatural of the gothic novel and the ‘‘glistening tear’’ inspired by sentimental ﬁction. It also increased the audience base for the genre, Introduction 9\n\nattracting more educated women and creating a unique space for them, a psychological ‘‘room of their own.’’21 On the stage, the music of the ‘‘melo’’ lost its importance once the censorship relaxed controls over spoken dialogue, but the use of theatrical spectacle to intensify the action remained. Music would return as an integral element at the very end of the century with the emergence of the silent cinema, a medium particularly well suited to melodrama because of its own capacity to dramatize emotion and its immediate popularity among women and the urban poor. As the movie industry advanced technologically in developing sound and color, ﬁlm melodrama remained popular by utilizing its uniquely sensational visual elements to amplify the emotional impact of its images. By the end of the nineteenth century, melodrama had already proven its durability as a prism of contemporary culture by adapting both form and content to suit changing times.22 From the very beginning, melodrama’s orchestrated appeal to the broadest public guaranteed rejection by intellectuals. In the 1960s, though, when academics began to revise their understanding of popular culture and recognize the powerful role it could play in mediating political and social conﬂict, melodrama won recognition as an important source of cultural commentary. Douglas Sirk, a refugee Weimar intellectual who found his way to Hollywood and directed the most extravagant of the 1950s movie melodramas, played the determining role in the elevation of melodrama to a critically acceptable art form. One of technicolor’s ﬁrst masters, and one of the ﬁrst to bring Berthold Brecht’s inﬂuence to ﬁlm, Sirk consciously turned some of Hollywood’s biggest stars into Freudian simulacra for the angst of repressed sexuality and irrational passions underlying the surface complacency of the 1950s. Sirk’s cinematic portrayals of glamorous middle-class women trapped in the false security of the domestic economy demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to serve both the priests and the rabble. He became the darling of both crowds and critics with ﬁlms that oﬀered moralistic examinations of postwar conformity through characters who inevitably violated the norms of middle-class morality in lurid, melodramatic excess.23 Sirk’s movies about women frustrated with bourgeois life made natural texts for the nascent ﬁeld of feminist studies in the 1970s, when feminism joined forces with ﬁlm criticism to redress the inferior status of melodrama.24 Together they reimagined the female viewer, formerly construed as passive and marginal, by endowing her with critical agency. 10 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nThe opulent sets characteristic of melodramatic mise-en-scène were no longer disdained for cultivating bourgeois values but rather were appreciated for their use of contrast and extravagance to expose social inequalities and tensions among genders, classes, and cultures.25 The new scholarship acknowledged the complexity of the audience, and it replaced assumptions about melodrama’s Manichaean morality with a sophisticated appreciation for its capacity to render dichotomies ambiguous. In a key revisionist point, Laura Mulvey recognized the ambiguity in melodrama’s conventional restoration of the status quo. In most melodrama, the same problems that had generated conﬂict in the opening scene still simmered below the surface calm as the curtain fell or the last page was turned.26 Once it was understood that melodramas could problematize hierarchies as much as they reinforced them, the genre could oﬀer a signiﬁcant new category of cultural analysis.27 This critical reappraisal, initiated by Sirk’s reinvention of an ambiguous melodrama and the feminist discovery of its capacity for a submerged challenge to underlying cultural, sexual, and class conﬂicts, has expanded possibilities for revealing readings of melodramas in other times and contexts.28 In Russia, audiences for melodrama experienced the industrial revolution under signiﬁcantly diﬀerent social and political circumstances from those that spawned the genre in the West. Yet melodrama was as popular in Russia as in the West, from its inception at the turn of the nineteenth century through the collapse of communism. Was there, then, a uniquely Russian melodrama? Yes and no. Sharp diﬀerences are readily apparent between Russian and western melodramatic texts, but their cultural functions are remarkably similar. In short, what made Russian melodrama unique was Russia, not melodrama. Throughout this volume, individual authors show repeatedly that melodrama as a genre followed the same historical trajectory as its counterparts in western Europe and the United States. Peter Brooks’s conceptualization of the genre’s prescriptive functions applies to Russian melodramas of every type and period. Literary authors, playwrights, and ﬁlmmakers used melodrama to address issues of social identity in times of transition, to explore the shifting boundaries between public and private, and to both challenge and reaﬃrm existing hierarchies, but they did so to explore speciﬁcally Russian or soviet versions of those issues. As the studies in this collection will show, melodrama in Russia was Introduction 11\n\na malleable form, as useful for the radical intelligentsia as it was for the middlebrow. Melodrama oﬀered a counternarrative to challenge the intelligentsia’s view of itself as the country’s sole conscience and primary cultural authority. The private pleasures and passions on the domestic palette of commercial melodrama encompassed a social world as large and varied as any represented in the radical cultural narrative, or even in the works of renowned novelists. By dramatizing class tensions, urbanrural transformations, marriage politics, struggles over national memory, the nature of heroism, and the conﬂict between the worship of ideas and the accumulation of things, melodrama had the capacity to explore the most important cultural conﬂicts at the heart of the construction of both national and individual identity. In Russia, melodrama was useful even for some of its harshest critics among the intelligentsia. The Freudian notion of the repression of sexuality found a Russian political analog in the repression of the Russian people. Even more signiﬁcant, radical narratives, both political and literary, plotted revolution in melodramatic terms: good battled evil; ravished innocence and virtue were restored by moral action; and radical male heroes defended the honor of the (female) motherland. From the intelligentsia’s point of view, Russian society before the revolution was a Manichaean world where an evil government deﬁled an innocent people and where educated heroes—and heroines—intervened on their behalf. Despite the communalism of nineteenth-century socialist theory, the intelligentsia’s view of itself as the ‘‘conscience’’ of the nation revealed at least one strain in radical thought to be an individual aﬀair, preoccupied with choices about individual values—honor, sacriﬁce, commitment, morality. During the revolutionary era and into the postrevolutionary reconstruction, when Bolsheviks adopted melodrama’s moral purity for the deceptively simplistic political narratives of socialist realism, the genre was less useful for exploring transformations and revealing the repressed than for establishing new categories of good and evil and opening up the private to the purgative glare of public, politically charged morality. The rich tapestry of prerevolutionary urban cultural life was badly burned by the Bolshevik revolution, but it was never entirely destroyed. The Bolsheviks’ eﬀorts to tame private passions and expose the hidden arenas of private life deprived the revolutionary-reconstruction melodrama of its century-long fascination with everyday complexities, thereby forcing 12 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nartists, ﬁlmmakers, and writers to seek new ways of stretching the limits and plumbing the depths of the permissible. As tensions increased between oﬃcial discourse and everyday experience—between the public and private, the collective and individual, and the idea and the thing— artists found abundant material for melodramatic treatment. In socialist realist works of the 1930s and 1940s—in the boy/girl/ tractor/machine-gun melodramas—domestic passions were never far from the surface. After Stalin’s death, the recovery of private life oﬀered melodrama a new role as a self-reﬂexive, at times ironic, genre for exploring the legacy of revolutionary culture (well before the collapse in 1991, it should be noted). The revival of private life as a legitimate subject for the arts raised questions about the impact of public values on domestic ones. By exploring basic human relations, post-Stalinist melodrama oﬀered insights into the survival of the individual after the assault of the collective. Despite their diﬀerences, the long history of aﬃnities between melodramatic and revolutionary modes of thought, despite their diﬀerences, made melodrama an especially apt tool for exploring the individual within the collective, the private morality underneath the strictures on public performances, the tensions resulting from political manipulations of both public and private morality. Issues that lay at the heart of melodrama’s staging of the conﬂict between public and private life were also central to Russian political culture throughout the modern era, when social responsibility turned into coerced conformity and demands for a right to privacy became an excuse for greed and hedonism. Rightfully identiﬁed as a chorus from below, melodrama oﬀers escape not from political reality but from a social and moral certainty imposed from above. The essays in this volume examine the uses of melodrama within Russian political culture to rethink several features of Russian and soviet historiography. They bring the middle classes back to a status long denied them, for example, because melodrama examines attitudes toward the status quo without assuming a direct connection between the bourgeoisie and electoral politics. Gender roles, a central preoccupation of melodrama, are examined for their ability to focus moral dilemmas and reveal hidden strengths as well as hidden weaknesses of identity. Both the power and the limitations of the pervasive soviet state become apparent in its blatant manipulation of the genre, and a subtext of resistance allows melodrama to provide its fans with Introduction 13\n\none means to circumvent the predations of that state. As an authentic reﬂection of popular sentiments, melodrama contains all the ambiguities, contradictions, and ironies implicit in such a mediative cultural idiom. Furthermore, the Russian example suggests possibilities for a deeper and broader understanding of melodrama as a genre across cultures. The study of Russian and soviet melodramas shows, for example, that the presumed audience for propaganda enjoyed an alternative source for simpliﬁed social and political discourse. Moreover, these studies provide evidence that the political elite considered the genre useful for state purposes as well. In the ﬁrst essay in this volume, Richard Stites identiﬁes the Russian audience for early melodrama as socially diverse. In so doing, he expands Pierre Bourdieu’s argument that culture provides a form of capital, by suggesting that cultural taste can also supply a marker of social identity distinctly diﬀerent from that prescribed by class. Contrary to common assumptions about melodrama’s middle-to-lower-class audience, Stites ﬁnds a signiﬁcant element of the audience for melodrama in the more elevated populace at the Winter Palace, and he reveals an international constituency for plays performed in radically diﬀerent political climates, from New York to St. Petersburg. The speciﬁc plays he discusses star one of melodrama’s most celebrated characters, the vulnerable female whose return to patriarchy is ensured, but only after suﬃcient tears have been shed. Because these early plays established patriarchy as the site where social conﬂict could be reconciled, Russia’s autocracy shows an often overlooked cultural aﬃnity with bourgeois capitalism. Furthermore, Stites’s concluding discussion of Alexander Herzen’s revolutionary adaptation of one of the era’s most popular melodramas demonstrates both the underlying aﬃnities between revolutionary and melodramatic modes of constructing social reality and melodrama’s inherent challenge to convention, which Sirk brought to the surface a century later. The diﬀerent cultural uses to which Russian and western writers put melodrama are explored by Julie Buckler, who looks at how ‘‘Russia’’ became at once a location and a character in several important western melodramas. Such writers as Victorien Sardou and Oscar Wilde utilized melodrama’s Manichaean dualism to emphasize the political diﬀerences between Eastern and Western Europe, identifying eastern autocracy as the villain that made western liberalism look ‘‘good.’’ From the western 14 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nviewpoint, the ‘‘evil’’ Other portrayed by Russia had two equally odious sides: autocratic oppression and revolutionary socialism.Western melodramatists resorted to a familiar trope, the power of female love, to redeem unsavory politics. The melodramatic ‘‘Russia’’ that appeared on western stages, however, enacted western rather than Russian anxieties. True love could redeem the western heroic versions of Russians, but tsarist audiences who lived in genuinely oppressive circumstances were less impressed by love’s redemptive potential. Wilde and Sardou drew their Russian heroines straight from contemporary stereotypes of revolutionaries. Placing their women in a melodramatic conﬂict within a western, liberal context, those women had little choice but to take their own lives in order to demonstrate the primacy of true love over political action. At ﬁrst glance this might evoke favorable comparison with the heroines created by Russian authors. But, as Beth Holmgren shows in her portentously subtitled essay, ‘‘Why She Died,’’ there were stark diﬀerences between western and Russian women’s motivations for suicide. These, together with diﬀerences between the meanings death imparted to conﬂict resolution, demonstrate the conﬂicting cultural uses of the generic conventions, just as Herzen had suggested earlier. The western heroines committed suicide in order to dramatize their marginalization in society. The women created by the authors in Holmgren’s study—one Polish and the other Russian, both female—make political statements with their deaths, but the stakes are reversed. The West’s idealized Russians, as described by Buckler, reaﬃrm patriarchy and the capitalist status quo; on the other hand, the authentic Slavs die questioning capitalism, not autocracy. The suicidal Russian heroine in Holmgren’s essay, Mania Eltsova of The Keys to Happiness, found her fate recast by the proliﬁc moralist Count Amori, the pen name used by ‘‘boulevard’’ author Ippolit Rapgof, who rewrote some of the most sensational novels of the ﬁn de siècle. As Otto Boele points out in his essay, the way in which melodrama sets up the conﬂict between good and evil made it an appropriate medium for identifying some of the tensions that beset society as the old regime tottered toward its collapse. Amori included Mania in a cast of decadent ﬁctional characters, but he erased the suggestive ambiguities that her creator, Anastasia Verbitskaia, had raised about her self-indulgent, self-fulﬁlling lifestyle. More to the point, by calling on readers to accept his own unequivocal righteousness, he was emulating the moral certiIntroduction 15\n\ntude of the old intelligentsia and trying, unsuccessfully, to subvert the very power of the genre he employed. Amori tried to redraw the moral world in black and white, an agenda he did not carry over into the scripts he wrote for the emergent blackand-white world of early cinema. Movies and melodrama were made for each other. From the acting styles that played on emotional rather than verbal expression to its ability to hide hollow morality beneath glamorous or virtuous surfaces to their socially heterogenous audiences, cinema was able to refract as well as reﬂect cultural mores. More than in any other mass medium, the vision of Russia that ﬂickered across its silver screens showed a country that had lost its moral compass as a direct result of the disarray in the national domestic economy. The weakening of tsarist authority was represented metaphorically in Russian melodrama as a troubled and problematic head of the household. As Louise McReynolds argues in ‘‘Home Was Never Where the Heart Was,’’ her essay on the enormously popular silent cinema, the familiar melodramatic trope of domesticity appeared repeatedly in Russia as a home without a patriarch. As ﬁgures more than simply incompetent in running their households, melodramatic fathers were prone to violate the vulnerable young ladies left in their care. In a signiﬁcant departure from generic convention, these movies ended without closure or resolution. A rickety status quo remained in place but, unlike in western melodrama, it was hardly restored. The last shot in a prerevolutionary movie melodrama, in which the possibilities for reconciliation lay dead literally as often as ﬁguratively, contrasts sharply with post-1917 melodramas, equally popular and made manifestly political by the new regime. Commissar of Enlightenment Anatoly Lunacharsky recognized the power of melodrama to reach the unsophisticated audiences whose support was critical to the new regime. As Julie Cassiday argues in her study of the temperance drama, another conventional melodramatic scenario, the genre provided a familiar cultural site for identifying good and evil and negotiating an individual’s banishment from and return to the community. An alcoholic who drinks away his family’s chance for happiness wrenches our tears for those defenseless against his weakness, and in the early soviet temperance drama such a drunk could just as easily personify a public issue as a private grief. Unlike such classic western plays as Ten Nights in a Bar-Room, in which drinking marked speciﬁcally individual behavior, 16 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nthe soviet temperance drama mobilized the audience into judging the drunk’s behavior for its impact on the collective. For a government determined to heal the wounds left by civil war, the activist temperance drama depended on reconciliation and return in order to lay the foundations for what would become the new status quo. Most signiﬁcant, it also set into motion the uniquely soviet melodramatic tendency to privilege public over private concerns. Temperance dramas put citizens on trial for unethical behavior that tore the social fabric, and the juxtaposition of alcoholism with sobriety made an especially easy contrast of good and evil. Stalin, however, found the most radical political use for melodrama since Pixérécourt’s initial questioning of the French Revolution. Lars Lih uncovers the melodramatic structure underlying the show trials of 1936 to 1938, where life imitated lowbrow art with devastating results. The trials deployed classic melodramatic tropes to illustrate political good and evil and to villainize political threats. The evildoers singled out for exposure and banishment in these real-life melodramas were the ‘‘waverer,’’ an individual who still had doubts about the new community, and the dvurushnik, one who hid his hatred of the virtuous soviet community under a mask of surface loyalty. The emotion that these melodramas played on was fear, a categorically public fear that worked to transform the very nature of privacy into a threat to public order and thereby justify the exposure of all private life to the state’s gaze. Stalin’s brilliant manipulation of melodramatic structures could not, however, sustain a status quo that derived so much of its authority from exhausting, debilitating fear, nor could soviet society maintain its excessive intrusion into the private sphere. The versatility of melodrama proved itself once again during the ‘‘thaw’’ that followed Stalin’s death in 1953, when artists reclaimed private life as a legitimate, if contested, subject. Susan Costanzo’s study brings us yet another public trial about private life, but this one staged in an experimental theater at Moscow University in 1957. Director Rolan Bykov used the innovative staging of a Czech melodrama to highlight the potential for ambiguity that had been in decline under Stalinism. Like his contemporary Douglas Sirk, Bykov had been inﬂuenced by Brechtian uses of form to evoke psychological moods. At the same time that Sirk was questioning the American ideals of consensus and conformity during the cold war, Bykov was raising comparable doubts about conformity under soviet socialism. Introduction 17\n\nAlthough Bykov used the conventions of melodrama to challenge the moral certainty of Stalinist public values, Mikhail Kalatozov used similar conventions to rework the central trope of late Stalinist culture, the Second World War. One of the signal cultural events of the period, Kalatozov’s ﬁlm The Cranes Are Flying, undermined sacred icons of soviet wartime heroism. Comparing The Cranes Are Flying to a war-era movie melodrama Wait for Me, Alexander Prokhorov argues that in the late 1950s Kalatozov fulﬁlled people’s need to reconcile the public memory of national victory with their devastating personal losses. As the action shifted from the external battleﬁeld to the domestic and internal one, Russian men and women replaced the Nazis as the sole source of evil during the war. And again, like Sirk in the United States, Kalatozov used melodramatic conventions to raise questions about the private individual held captive by public ideology. In the 1970s, director Nikita Mikhalkov took cinematic melodrama a step further into moral ambiguity and a subtle questioning of the late soviet status quo. Joan Neuberger’s discussion of Slave of Love, Mikhalkov’s complex melodrama within a melodrama, shows this ﬁlm to be much more than the ‘‘retro-chic’’ costume drama that critics branded it. Setting his story in the ﬁnal days of Russia’s old regime, Mikhalkov used the world of bourgeois ﬁlmmaking to explore the aﬃnities between revolutionary and melodramatic approaches to life’s basic questions. By collapsing categories usually seen as mutually exclusive, Mikhalkov uncovers the the moral interdependency of public and private life. In Slave of Love, Neuberger argues, Mikhalkov used the old-regime setting to challenge the revolution’s repression of private life, while at the same time decry the seductive dangers of private self-absorption, a pointed reﬂection on the revived private sphere of his own time. Ultimately the ﬁlm represents choices between good and evil as primarily individual aﬀairs, but also as ambiguous and diﬃcult in the renewed (and remembered) soviet private life as they had been in the heroic and conformist soviet public sphere. Helena Goscilo brings this volume to a ﬁtting end by connecting prerevolutionary to postsoviet society with her analysis of celebrity funerals. Structured like melodrama, these public rituals accentuate the presentism of the genre, as the urgencies of the present determine celebrity status. The ﬁrst funeral she discusses, that of silent ﬁlm star Vera Kholodnaia, recalls both the popularity of the silent movies themselves 18 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nand Mikhalkov’s calculated use of a Kholodnaia-like heroine in Slave of Love. The funerals of Stalin and of the dissidents who spoke out against the soviet privileging of public over private remind us that Stalinism never entirely erased opposition, and they illustrate some of the particularly Russian forms that opposition took. Melodrama in the soviet period assumed a heightened political function precisely because so little was permitted to be said out loud. In a society where reason struggled against impossible conditions, emotions ran persistently high. The last funeral Goscilo discusses shows that melodrama will continue to play an important function in postsoviet culture, as the terms of good and evil and public and private again undergo redeﬁnition: these funeral melodramas mark the death ritual of the monopoly of the idea.\n\nWhether electrifying from beneath the proscenium arch of the legitimate stage, springing to life from the pages of a romance novel, ﬂickering on the silver screen, or lying in funereal repose, the heroes and villains of Russian melodrama interpreted their audience’s contemporary worlds, and they did so in terms that illuminate the writing of Russian history. The story of melodrama would be worth telling even if the essays here simply recreated images of the past. As fragments of a story heretofore deemed unworthy of analysis, the essays in this volume ﬁll an important blank spot in the historical record. The now-established ﬁeld of cultural studies, however, suggests ways that melodrama can isolate stress points in social and political structures that are not otherwise visible. These studies of melodrama in Russia restore a limited agency to groups long regarded as the passive pawns of oppressive political systems, autocratic and communist. They reveal a lively, ongoing negotiation over issues of morality, power, and identity. And they show how such subjects could be approached in ways that were both aesopic and quotidian in times when direct speech about the everyday was impossible. Most important, though, these studies of Russian and soviet melodrama reaﬃrm Belyi’s Red Domino as an apocalyptic and tragic symbol of old-regime, Enlightenment culture in decay, and they oﬀer a corrective to the dangers of the Russian cult of the idea. Such postsoviet fare as Masha Gessen’s Dead Again and Andrei Siniavsky’s The Russian Intelligentsia, which hold the intelligentsia responsible for the successive failures of attempted democratic transformaIntroduction 19\n\ntions, underscore the continuation of the belief that high culture plays a uniquely important role in Russian politics and history.29 Although they reverse the intelligentsia’s own judgment of itself as tragic heroes and blame the intelligentsia for the current crisis, Gessen and Siniavsky are still taking the view from the top and obscuring the rest of the Russian world. Observers who would look instead for the culture that was actually, and voraciously, consumed at the end of the soviet era would ﬁnd melodrama in a prominent place. No television program before or since, and perhaps no cultural product, has matched the popularity of the imported, outdated Brazilian telenovelo The Rich Also Cry, which dominated the airwaves during the ﬁrst year after the failed coup of 1991 elevated Boris Yeltsin to power. Horriﬁed critics reverted to stereotype and denounced the soap opera as ‘‘escapism.’’ Without giving serious thought to what else viewers might be gleaning from the long-running saga of Marianna, the beautiful heroine who raised her son in secrecy from the father who never knew of his birth, intelligentsia critics missed the essential appeal of the addictive serial. Of all the melodramas imported by Russian television studios, including the American Santa Barbara (which enjoyed greater success in Europe than at home), The Rich Also Cry generated the most devoted following along with a cottage industry of spinoﬀs, including a Russianlanguage novelization. The original show contained the classic ingredients of melodrama: a self-sacriﬁcing mother, the concealed identity of a son, the threat of incest when the boy meets his younger and unknown sister, and a father forced to negotiate the oedipal conﬂict with the son he never knew he had. Douglas Sirk would have appreciated the richly exaggerated aesthetics of its spike heels, big hair, tight skirts, and hot tempers. In the 1990s, as in revolutionary eras past, Russian audiences appreciated a narrative that reﬂected the everyday turmoil in their lives far more coherently than they did the reigning political ﬁgures and ideologies.30 The Brazilian melodrama ‘‘worked’’ because it was grounded in the moral dilemmas of the everyday and it was structured to dramatize the complex issues its viewers understood implicitly but could not yet articulate. The millions of Russians who glued themselves to the television to follow Marianna’s exploits tuned in for the show’s most obvious value, entertainment. But if they watched obsessively, they did so with considerable irony and self-reﬂexivity—the funniest joke in Moscow at the time was that ‘‘the poor also cry.’’ Marianna’s 20 Louise McReynolds and Joan Neuberger\n\nfate was more than simple escape from political reality; the soap opera helped people to conﬁgure and comprehend the essential elements of the new national melodrama that began its run in 1991. As this book goes to press, the Russian government has just announced a rise in vodka and bread prices and the return of the second most popular soap, Santa Barbara. Canceled following the economic crisis of 1998, Santa Barbara returns to the broadcast schedule during a particularly desultory presidential campaign and, according to the Moscow Times, the program matters to Russian voters as much as the economic crisis or the war in Chechnya.31 Like earlier audiences who enjoyed Kotzube,Verbitskaia, Bykov, and Mikhalkov, or who sat anxiously through show trials and temperance dramas, Russians needed and still need the contemporary melodrama to make sense of their lives in times of change.\n\nNotes\n\nBoris Pasternak, Doctor Zhivago, trans.

The Theater Encyclopedia of thirty years ago oﬀered an elitist and politicized discussion of melodrama—barely admitting the genre’s existence in Russia. Melodrama’s cardinal sin was that its alleged concern for the poor and the weak was oﬀset by an aﬃrmation of the ‘‘bourgeois’’ order and a preachy message of class peace. The genre thus masked real, systemic social evils behind a war between abstractions of good and evil.1 In actuality, the opposite may have been the case: Russian audiences who regularly saw legally permitted productions about the struggle of the poor and the weak against the rich and the strong in a secular setting may have become as attuned to social evils as did the far fewer readers of antiserfdom novels and essays. In any case, there is no denying melodrama’s enormous popularity in the last half century of serfdom when it ﬂourished on the Russian stage. Today’s viewers come equipped with a well-established antimelodrama lexicon bulging with as many clichés as are found in the genre itself. In a world where horse opera has been with us for a century and soap opera for seventy years, it is not hard to be ‘‘sophisticated’’ about melodrama. Even some of its avid consumers utter the word as a sneer. Original melodrama as it emerged out of the French Revolution, the storm and stress of early romanticism, and ‘‘bourgeois sentimentalism’’ had its instant critics, but not a long history of dismissal. Melodrama\n\nwas born on stage—a story in dialogue spoken by actors, visually decorated, and accompanied by music. The European public enthusiastically devoured vaudevilles and melodramas along with operas—many of which had melodramatic story lines. All evidence shows that audiences enjoyed the wonderfully outrageous plots. They identiﬁed with characters, wanted a certain plausibility, and accepted colorful exaggeration of that plausibility. When the genre was young, consumers of all classes were able to suspend disbelief. One did not have to be a gruﬀ merchant or a poor clerk to immerse oneself in the toils of Pixérécourt or Kotzebue or Scribe. In melodrama, certain character types and situations recur constantly.2 A useful typology, although not rigorous or unfailing, suggests the melodramas of the grotesque, the adventure, and the family setting. The ﬁrst drew on gothic novels of the eighteenth century, ruled in the ‘‘bloodbath theater’’ of London, and culminated at the turn of the twentieth century in the Paris Grand Guignole. The ‘‘cape and sword’’ adventure journeyed out to exotic places and back to historical times imagined. The family or domestic melodrama diﬀered, and still does, from these two. In fact a more basic division lies between the melodrama of eﬀect (or action) and that of aﬀect (or emotion)—or, more bluntly, that of blood and that of tears. The gender appeal for the latter seems clear, and the playwrights of the age were fully aware of the growth of female audiences everywhere. Of the three works I will discuss, the Kotzebue domestic melodrama is of the second type and the two French pieces are of the ﬁrst. Each partook of the other’s modes; and all employed sensational devices. These devices were especially eﬀective—because unexpected—in the family or domestic play, whose ﬁnale was often acted out in a wild place—from the mountains of Savoy in Pixérécourt’s Coelina (1800) to the rushing ice ﬂoes of D. W. Griﬃth’s ﬁlm Way Down East (1920). The sensation could also be provided in the gritty urban version of domestic melodrama by a contrastive visit to back alleys and slums. Melodrama is replete with much-scorned coincidences, with deus ex machina, and with the tricks of switched babies, mistaken identities, and the stirring moment of reconnaissance, or discovery of true identities. Such features are also found in classic drama, but in melodrama, justice—usually poetic—triumphs, wrongs are righted, and villains are punished. Tragic catharsis, the property of high art, never occurs. In the 26 Richard Stites\n\nmoral sphere, early European melodrama eﬀected a transfer of revolutionary virtue and justice and populist values to the stage. Added pathos arose from inﬂicting evil on the already aﬄicted—the poor, the female, the weak, the child, the orphan, the blind, the deaf, the slave, the convict. The villains could come from outside the law—bandits and pirates; or they could emerge, slimy and unambiguously wicked, from respectable social milieux. A recurring conﬂict was that between a maiden ready to sacriﬁce her life to preserve her purity and the villain who falsely denounces her after his sexual advances are rebuﬀed. This surely resonates with Christian hagiography: Saints Agatha, Lucia, Margaret, and many others were martyrs not only to their faith but to the frustrated lust of men who brought about their deaths. Scholars of great drama enjoy the advantage of being able to supplement textual study with live performance, however diﬀerent the present versions are from the originals. It is now almost impossible to see melodramas of bygone days on stage. There is no market in the theater, and no interest in the academy. Historians must thus be doubly alert to what audiences might have seen and heard when melodramas were performed, including the setting, the seating, and the theater building itself. Stage eﬀects in the more successful houses played for sensation: exotic locales and elaborate machinery imitating warships, fortresses, grottoes, alpine crevices, jungles. When the taste for historical, biblical, and mythological themes declined, more weight was given to urban contemporary settings, particularly in the 1840s in France under the inﬂuence of Eugène Sue’s novel Mystères de Paris. Acting styles are hard to imagine even when we have script notes: the story was told by declamation, exaggerated gestures, coded movements, tirades, soliloquies, and asides—in which, for example, the villain would conﬁde to the public his evil designs. A feel for the style may be gotten by watching the silent ﬁlm melodramas of the 1910s.3 Music is often overlooked in theater history, and it is all but gone today on the drama stage where it was a vital component in the nineteenth century. Beethoven’s incidental music to Goethe’s Egmont and Mendelssohn’s to Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream was the fruit of a common practice even in high drama. Melodrama always used music, not only in the overture to get people seated but to signal entrances, exits, and dramatic moments; and as a means for emotional and character underlining—a plaintive ﬂute for the innocent heroine, The Misanthrope, the Orphan, and the Magpie 27\n\ngrowling double basses to announce the villain, a lively tune for the comic. These devices were drawn straight from German musicological doctrine of the eighteenth century, a code known as Aﬀektenlehre according to which minor slow meant elegiac; major slow, majestic; major fast, vigorous and triumphant; minor fast, menacing. This code guided composers of nineteenth-century melodrama music (and opera) and, later, of ﬁlm scores.4 What follows is an attempt to delineate the experience that Russians had with European melodrama in the early nineteenth century, those last decades of serfdom when Russian theater was in fact a theater of war—a war of classic and romantic, state and private, elite and popular, capitals and provinces, declamatory and ‘‘natural’’ acting. The Russian experience of culture—what people saw and heard—is as important as Russian cultural production itself. This is particularly true for the melodrama of this era, which was largely imported. As in all other arts, when Russians came late to a genre they consumed what was available—in this case the French and German products. I oﬀer in this essay a triptych of European melodramas that were popular everywhere in Europe and became an integral part of the Russian stage. Russian histories of theater usually dismiss them scornfully, yet without some understanding of these and similar works, what can we ever understand about the people in the theater itself—the cast, the writers, the translators and adapters, and those who outnumbered everyone else: the audience? Mellow Drama: Kotzebue’s First Hit\n\nAugust von Kotzebue (1761–1819) is a name known—if at all—to students of European history as the German playwright in the service of Tsar Alexander I who was stabbed to death by a German nationalist student in 1819—a deed that launched Prince Metternich’s infamous Carlsbad Decrees. But to hundreds of thousands of theatergoers in places ranging from the United States to Siberia, Kotzebue was a household name. Better known than Goethe and Schiller in his day, Kotzebue wrote about 230 plays and boasted of being able to write one in a threeday period. All but forgotten now, his plays were translated into French, Russian, Danish, Swedish, Spanish, Romanian, Italian, Dutch, Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian, and English. In the German states, they made up one-fourth of the repertoire of plays performed in the years 1795 to 1825; 28 Richard Stites\n\nin New York, ﬁfty-two of the ninety-four theater performances in 1799 were of Kotzebue’s plays. A student of his work has called Kotzebue ‘‘a phenomenon of literary and social history.’’5 In Russia, Kotzebue effected a reorientation of theater taste as surely as did Beaumarchais in France a few decades earlier. His characters populated Russian stages in the capitals and in the provinces and helped launch the careers of well-known actors during the reign of Alexander I and Nicholas I.6 The great appeal of Kotzebue’s works lay in their stageability, spectacle, immediacy of sentimental expression, and in their sense of empowerment and agency that was wholly absent in the neoclassical genre based on Greek models where the gods were in charge. Kotzebue wrote crisp dramatic material in plain language. His success—and his badge of shame to critical scholars—arose partly from his willingness to cater to a public weary of the tirade in rhymed verse of French neoclassical drama and comedy. The entertainment quotient of his work was provided by exotic settings in South America, the Near East, and on the ocean.Viewing his comedies, operas, one acts, farces, adaptations, and melodramas, audiences gaped at the animated impersonations of pirates, Gypsies, slaves, Peruvian Indians, uprooted Asians, rebels, impoverished nobles, and misused women—to say nothing of kings, sultans, and innumerable pseudohistorical ﬁgures attired in colorful costumes and backed by elaborate sets. Interwoven into the spectacle was the open expression of ‘‘naturalistic’’ feeling, with an occasional hint of sex and a down-toearth sentimentalism. The socially expanding Russian audiences who were surfeited with—in Beaumarchais’s scorching words—‘‘the death of a Peloponesian tyrant or the sacriﬁce of a young princess of Aulis’’ could readily identify with his works.7 People reared in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century could relate more easily to everyday dramatic situations and to heroes who could triumph over evil than they could to exalted ancients locked in an uneven battle with the gods. Kotzebue was a well-traveled bourgeois man of the world who claimed no depth of intellect. He skillfully played the strings of a sentimentalism that was already in literary vogue, and he spiced it with high adventure. Born into a family of Weimar petty oﬃcials in 1761, he moved in the environment of Schiller and Goethe, studied law, and became entranced by theater. He took up a minor post in St. Petersburg under Catherine II and began his dramatic career there with Demetrius the Impostor, one of many plays on this theme penned by European writers. Settling in The Misanthrope, the Orphan, and the Magpie 29\n\nEstland in a judicial post, Kotzebue immersed himself in amateur productions and founded the ﬁrst theater in Reval (Tallin). For two decades from 1781 onward he lived on and oﬀ in the Baltic or in other parts of Russia before settling most of the time in Germany. Arrested under Tsar Paul in 1799, he was sent to Siberia on an unfounded suspicion of radicalism. Pardoned after a few months, Kotzebue returned, made his peace with Paul, and later became a favorite of Tsar Alexander I.8 An enlightened conservative, with a humanist outlook at least in his youth, Kotzebue in his works frequently criticized abuses of privilege and even of monarchical power. But in later years, like many of his contemporaries, he became an apologist of the Restoration and a keen foe of liberalism, democracy, constitutions, student rights, and a free press. Although not exactly a ‘‘spy’’ for Tsar Alexander I, he was certainly on his payroll as a nominal state councilor and supplied him with political intelligence, mostly in private correspondence. For all these reasons, Kotzebue was assassinated by Karl Sand in 1819. And this dramatic demise obscured Kotzebue’s importance in history as a successful dramatist who dominated the stages of two continents for decades in all genres of melodrama. Misanthropy and Repentance (1788), Kotzebue’s ﬁrst international sensation, premiered in Reval and then opened in Berlin where it was acclaimed by audiences composed of, in Oscar Mandel’s words, ‘‘kings, lords and ladies, wealthy merchants, humble spectators—everyone except disgruntled intellectuals.’’9 European readers and playgoers had been steeped in sentimentalism for decades before this play opened. As a ‘‘melodrama of aﬀect’’ it was designed to appeal to popular sentiment, especially to female audiences. Misanthropy and Repentance was the ultimate gusher melodrama—both dialogue and stage directions are soaked in tears. It contains no villain and no violence, only the emotional turbulence in the ﬁnale when an errant wife repents to her husband in a lengthy dialogue and is forgiven. Baron Meinau, the male protagonist known as the Stranger, has spent three years of bitter hatred of self and of the human race as a result of the aberrant inﬁdelity of his young wife, Eulalia. Repentant, she has gone into humble service to atone. The reunion is coincidental, their reconciliation organized by noble friends. The play presents an aﬀecting dramatic treatment of the utter desolation of the two protagonists. Meinau, ‘‘an ice-cold man of clever mind’’\n\n30 Richard Stites\n\nin the words of his servant, is an ancestor of those hard-faced, harshtalking heroes with a soft heart who later inhabited westerns and crime melodramas on ﬁlm. Eulalia, whose ‘‘heart bleeds and [whose] tears ﬂow’’ at her fate, was an early model for heroines endowed with kindness, charity, and chaste modesty. In the very ﬁnal moment of the play, after extended speechifying suspense, the aﬄicted couple are reunited in the presence of their children.10 The extraordinary impact of this play, and especially its heartwarming and eye-wetting ﬁnale, was conditioned not only by the sentimentalist literary movement of the time, but probably also by liberal life-aﬃrming philanthropic currents among the bourgeoisie—the mainstay of Kotzebue’s European and American audiences. This ideology encapsulated the antislavery crusade (Kotzebue wrote Negro Slaves [1796] on that theme) and other reformist movements. Eulalia was a perfect stand-in for the repentant convict so beloved of the penal reform movement of the time in many countries—especially in the AngloSaxon ones where Kotzebue ﬂourished luxuriantly.11 Having fallen afoul of the moral law, Eulalia has ‘‘paid the penalty’’ by years of separation from her loved ones, is now ready to ‘‘re-enter society’’ (family), and is given ‘‘a second chance.’’ The emotional interplay of Misanthropy has direct analogies in prison literature. Meinau’s friend and comrade-inarms describes Eulalia in terms of her underlying virtue, her momentary lapse, her prolonged penance, and her worthiness of pardon. Eulalia, in the dialogue with Meinau, emphatically contrasts her own remorseful and atoning posture with that of ‘‘a hardened criminal,’’ the unredeemable element in progressive penological discourse.12 Child of Love (1796), which dealt with illegitimacy, was the ﬁrst Kotzebue play performed in St. Petersburg. By the late 1790s, he was well known in the Russian provinces, and dozens of his plays had been translated into Russian, with Misanthropy and Repentance in the lead. Of the many versions of the play, a partial list includes two published in St. Petersburg (1792), two in Moscow (1796, 1801), one in Smolensk (1812), and two in Orël (1824, 1826). As early as 1800, during his brief sojourn in exile in Siberia, Kotzebue met people in Moscow, Kazan, and Tobolsk who knew his name and work. A friendly governor of Tobolsk province oﬀered the playwright a chance to stage one of his new short comedies. On his way out of Tobolsk to his place of exile in remote\n\nThe Misanthrope, the Orphan, and the Magpie 31\n\nKurgan, Kotzebue was accosted by a Russian actress from an itinerant troupe asking him costume details about a play of his in which she was about to perform, Virgin of the Sun.13 On returning to St. Petersburg after his pardon, Kotzebue served at Tsar Paul’s court theater. Kotzebue’s complaints about the stringent censorship are well known and often quoted. Less known was the reaction of the iron disciplinarian Tsar Paul—he was ‘‘deeply moved’’ to the staging in 1800 in French by French actors of Misanthropy and Repentance at the Hermitage Theater. Kotzebue’s popularity thereafter grew apace: in the years 1800 to 1820 up to half of the plays in a season in Moscow and St. Petersburg were his. In 1806, a German correspondent in St. Petersburg reported that ‘‘the name of Kotzebue in the [theater] announcements is here always the surest magnet for a full house.’’14 Within a decade Kotzebue was fully established in Russian provincial stages, serf theaters, and amateur productions. At Kazan University, his works inspired an amateur student theater in which Sergei Aksakov played the role of Meinau. Aksakov soon became known as a theater critic, long before his other reputation was made as the poetic memoirist of the Orenburg steppe or as the father of two Slavophiles.15 Audiences in Russia adored Kotzebue for what he delivered, whether in German, French, or Russian. Directors and theater entrepreneurs loved him for the full houses. And certain actors found in his work a natural vehicle for their talents. Kotzebue’s plays required acting gifts untapped by the classical repertoire. Pavel Mochalov, Peter Plavilshchikov, Alexei Iakovlev, and ‘‘a whole series of major Russian actors’’ made their name in Kotzebue roles. Mochalov, the icon of the ‘‘Moscow’’ emotional style (contrasted with the classical demeanor of the St. Petersburg players) found his ﬁrst stage success in Kotzebue’s plays. A memoirist recalls that when Mochalov played Meinau in Misanthropy and Repentance, ‘‘he would begin [his tale of woe] calmly, almost indiﬀerently; but little by little his emotion rose to a pitch that seized the audience. Every added word expressing the accumulated bitterness of his soul moved their hearts more strongly, till ﬁnally they were unable to suppress their tears.’’ Plavilshchikov’s best role was Meinau, but Aksakov, while a student in the newly opened Kazan University, was thrilled by his performance in Child of Love. A. S. Iakovlev (1773–1817), the son of a Kostroma merchant, was a shop clerk when his talent was discovered. On stage, he privileged emotion over reason and when he played 32 Richard Stites\n\nPavel Mochalov as Meinau in August Kotzebue’s Misanthropy and Repentance. From Robert Leach et al., A History of Russian Theater (Cambridge: Cambridge University Preess, 1999), 108.\n\nMeinau, not even ‘‘a heart of stone’’ could withstand his acting. Iakovlev turned on a ‘‘faucet of tears’’ in the audience and could bring tears to his own eyes at certain moments. A contemporary Russian critic, Stepan Zhikharëv, comparing various well-known actors of the 1810s, observed that although they all played Meinau with merit, none could compare to Iakovlev who ‘‘made you cry.’’16 At the coronation of Tsar Paul in 1797, Alexandra Karatygina played Eulalia opposite Iakovlev as Meinau in Misanthropy and Repentance. She was noted for the ‘‘feeling and tenderness’’ of her style. It was, in the view of one scholar, the role of Eulalia that brought her talent to perfection. By contrast, the most famous actress of the age, Ekaterina Semënova, daughter of a serf, initially played the Kotzebue emploi but found her true line of business in classical and neoclassical plays. Her electrifying performance in Medea was as far from the Kotzebue genre as any could be. And it is Semënova who is canonized in theatrical history, although both her declamatory style of acting and her repertoire were on the verge of decline when she reached the peak of her career.17 A well-known soviet scholar of the 1920s called the Kotzebue oeuvre meshchanskaia drama (lower middle-class or philistine drama) and repeated the familiar Marxist cliché that melodrama, along with other The Misanthrope, the Orphan, and the Magpie 33\n\npopular forms, deﬂected popular passions away from the terrible reign of Nicholas I, just as it was doing in the France of Louis-Philippe. He also quoted contemporary classicists who called Kotzebue’s plays kotsebiatina (Kotzebue trash). Those writing from an aesthetic perspective ﬁxed on the playwright’s simplicity and lack of art. Kotzebue frankly admitted that he was a second-rate writer—but one who wished to give pleasure to the masses of theatergoers. Pleasing audiences, to certain critics then and now, can be considered pandering—a cheap and ultimately immoral act.18 The Decembrist V. K. Küchelbecker (Kiukhelbekker), for example, detested the ‘‘sentimental-German’’ drama of Kotzebue ‘‘which gave the ladies of the Zamoskvorechie District [of merchant Moscow] much to rave about.’’19 Here the resentment is leveled not only at the creator but at the very audience he serves, an audience that allegedly has been hoodwinked and is thus worthy of contempt. But let us listen to a diﬀerent voice, that of Rafael Zotov, novelist and dramatist, author of over one hundred plays, including melodramas and historical pastiches. He spoke for the seatless parterre, where stood teachers, journalists, youth, and oﬃcers who, he believed, came for the ‘‘theater’’ as opposed to the seated public who came for the ‘‘show.’’ ‘‘The parterre,’’ he wrote, ‘‘is a crucial element in the theater. Without it, the passion of the middle classes [srednoe soslovie] would not develop. The life that is imparted by the parterre encourages actors and makes them fear the stern and educational judgement that is located there.’’ Elsewhere he wrote that ‘‘our audiences were raised on exclamations, shouts, and turgid phrases. But as soon as they were shown a domestic environment, the joys and sorrows of ordinary life, as soon as they saw verisimilitude and naturalness, as soon as they heard the voice of natural feelings—they joyfully jumped oﬀ the high horse of Sumarokov [the eighteenth-century classical dramatist] and with all their hearts attached themselves to the plays of Kotzebue.’’20 Kotzebue’s numerous ‘‘cape and sword’’ plays, replete with nasty villains and exotic locales, also did well on the Russian stage, but none had the resonance in Russia of Misanthropy and Repentance. This is probably because the French imports in the ‘‘action’’ subgenre of melodrama were better and more timely (as will be discussed below) or because it was easier in Russia to translate them fast. Misanthropy appeared early and won patronage at court and in the German theater of St. Peters34 Richard Stites\n\nburg and elsewhere. It could be heard in three languages, sometimes in the same city. Although no detailed evidence of audience reaction is available, we do know that this melodrama gained instant popularity. It would be tempting to ascribe some peculiarly soulful element in the play that had special appeal for Russians.Were Russians especially sympathetic to the ‘‘agency’’ of a Eulalia or forgiving of her sin? Was there operating a moral equivalent of the European prison reform movement, a tendency to pity the wrongdoer? One thinks of the peasant habit of lining the road to Siberia and praying for convicts; and of the enduring tenderness in Russian literature to ‘‘fallen women.’’ The evidence allows no more than speculation. Like their European counterparts, Russian critics of the time diﬀered over the pivotal moment in Misanthropy and Repentance: the moral propriety of forgiving an unfaithful wife on stage. But accounts of its public reception—in Russia and elsewhere—almost aways focus on the favorable impression made by the ﬁnal scene of reconciliation, clearly indicating that the key ingredient of the play was forgiveness and redemption, enduring features of New Testament Christian theology and ecclesiastical practice. In spite of the secularism launched by the French Revolution and the preceding Enlightenment, the deep wells of religion (and of Freemasonry) still oﬀered sustenance to the public, perhaps all the more so when decked out in simple domestic ﬁction and acted on stage. Russian audiences who ﬂocked to and wept through Misanthropy were cosmopolitan not so much in the sophisticated sense, but rather as sharers of that transnational collective surge of philanthropic emotionalism and charitableness that at this time was being exhibited—and constantly violated as well— all over the European continent. An Orphan on the Provincial Circuit\n\nKotzebue has been compared to Guilbert de Pixérécourt (1773–1844), the ‘‘father of French melodrama.’’21 The ‘‘melodrama of eﬀect’’ in Pixérécourt’s work and that of his Parisian rivals, Caigniez and Ducange, ruled the day. In the backdrop of melodrama hung the French Revolution with its own melodramas of violence, betrayal, pathos, rescue, and a world reversed. Pixérécourt fought on the side of both royalist emigrés and Jacobins, and he met real prototypes for the stock villain that he virtually invented for Parisian audiences who frequented theThe Misanthrope, the Orphan, and the Magpie 35\n\naters located on what was called the Boulevard of Crime. Pixérécourt wrote about 120 plays, half of them melodramas, that were performed thousands of times in the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century. After the appearance of his ﬁrst full-formula melodrama, Coelina, or, The Child of Mystery (1800), at the very moment of the transition between the inward turmoil of the Revolution and the outward spectacles of Napoleon, Pixérécourt was hailed as ‘‘the man who made all France weep.’’22 Not far behind him came Victor Ducange, famous for breaking all the rules of drama by putting three generations of life on stage in Thirty Years, or, The Life of a Gambler (1827), a play about a compulsive gambler who kills a fellow train passenger for money to feed his gaming frenzy and subsequently discovers that the victim is his son. Thirty Years was very popular in Russia where the table and the deck could also be a lethal occupation (the well-known composer Alexander Aliabev was convicted of murder over a card game in the 1820s). But it was Ducange’s Theresa, or, The Orphan of Geneva (1821) that achieved world acclaim. The plot of Theresa is crucial in providing clues to audience reaction. Like Misanthropy and Repentance, it deals with high-born people. Kotzebue’s cast resided in a castle; Ducange’s characters live in the Swiss château of the widow de Sénange and her son Karl. The mysterious young woman who has been taken in by the châtelaine is Theresa, disguised as ‘‘Henriette,’’ and she is about to be betrothed to Karl. The back story, slowly revealed, is her early life as an adopted (although in fact biological) daughter of a high noblewoman. When her mother dies, Theresa is revealed as the beneﬁciary of her vast fortune until the swindler Walther falsely accuses her of malfeasance and has her sent to jail.While she is out on bail, Walther concocts a plan—as he informs the audience in a long aside—to force her to marry him and thus get his hands on the fortune by revealing the truth about the will. But Theresa ﬂees and ﬁnds shelter ﬁrst with the kindly Pastor Egerthon and then with the de Sénanges. Walther appears at the engagement party and reveals Theresa’s shameful arrest. At this point the plot accelerates into high, but still verbose, action. Theresa ﬂees in shame to a hiding place arranged by Egerthon. Madame de Sénange and Walther learn of her whereabouts and both arrive when Theresa is absent. In the dark,Walther, now resolved to murder Theresa, mistakenly kills the older woman. When Theresa returns and discovers the body, she is suspected of murder. In court, however,\n\n36 Richard Stites\n\nEgerthon accuses Walther without telling him who the victim really is. The pastor confronts the killer with the live Theresa, and he is so frightened by what he takes to be a ghost that he breaks down and confesses. Theresa is absolved of all criminal activity.23 French melodrama ﬂooded into Russia in the 1810s and 1820s. St. Petersburg and Moscow repertoires in the years 1813 to 1825 contained ten melodramas of Pixérécourt. (His works were so well-known that his Pizarro, or, The Conquistador of Peru was satirized by Dmitri Lenskii in Russia’s most durable stage comedy, Lev Gurych Sinichkin [1839]). In those years, the capitals saw four plays of Caigniez and several of Ducange, including Theresa, which by then had already played around the world. Imperial Theater actors had to take the roles assigned to them and shift from serious tragedy to melodrama or vaudeville and even to opera and ballet. The classical star Semënova in St. Petersburg played de Sénange, with her sister Nimfodora Semënova as Theresa and Iakov Brianskii as Walther. Detailed sound eﬀects and music are marked in the margins of a Moscow copy of the script. Many of the silent scenes demanded very expressive mimicry and clarity of movement in order to motivate the plot; as obvious as it sounds, we must remember that there are no closeups in theater. Stage movement was carefully taught by dancing masters, ballet being a mandatory part of the training of all dramatic actors in this era.24 I have no data on the reception of Theresa in the two capitals, but the experience of the provincials throws some light on the levels at which people saw melodrama. Frequent assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, theater ﬂourished in the Russian provinces during the preemancipation era. The Imperial Theater system held a monopoly in its half-dozen houses in St. Petersburg and Moscow but was little concerned about what went on in the provinces. There, close to two hundred serf theaters operated at the apex of their development (ca. 1770s– 1820), mostly on estates but also in provincial and district capitals. To these must be added commercial theaters owned by nobles, merchants, and other classes in the towns, and traveling troupes that crisscrossed the country in a permanent caravan of troikas and carriages, rattling with musical instruments, sets, machines, and costumes. At almost every one of the thousands of fairs one could ﬁnd some kind of theatrical performance—not only puppet and folk entertainments but\n\nThe Misanthrope, the Orphan, and the Magpie 37\n\nalso King Lear, Wilhelm Tell, and Russian tragedies, comedies, vaudevilles, operas, and melodramas. Out of this circuit came some of the ﬁnest actors on the Moscow and St. Petersburg stages—including the most famous of all, Mikhail Shchepkin, a serf. All three of the plays discussed here played this circuit. At the high end of the scale stood the once famous provincial theater of NizhnyNovgorod, which ﬂourished during the reign of Nicholas I. One of its standbys, borrowed from the capital stages, was Theresa, or, the Orphan of Geneva. For the highest-paid star of this theater, Anna Vysheslavtseva, Theresa was a bread-and-butter role. In her production, the murderer Walther used arson rather than the knife in order to enhance the spectacle.25 At the lower end of the scale—fairground performance—we have the comments of the musician Iury Arnold from about 1835.While in Kharkov at the time of the Kreshchinskaia Fair, Arnold saw Theresa, disliked it, and conceded, rather sourly, that it was at the time a very popular melodrama.26 The comments of I. I. Lavrov, later an actor at the Maly and the lead singer at the Bolshoi in Moscow, oﬀer a diﬀerent perspective. Lavrov began life as the son of a petty merchant in Tambov province, worked as a peddler, a factory worker, and other menial occupations. In 1844 he began acting in a provincial repertoire that included Shakespeare, vaudevilles, operas, and melodramas. Lavrov’s account of the provincial years—about sixty engagements in about thirty towns, villages, and fairs—is richly descriptive of theater life, including conditions of employment, audiences, managers, patrons, interfering oﬃcials, sudden dismissals, money matters, and backstage romances. It is also brutally frank about brushes with the police and about drunk and disorderly actors who were run out of town. How did Lavrov become an actor? During visits to the fairs along the Volga, while still a peddler, he became enchanted with carnival entertainment. The turning point of his life occurred in Astrakhan where in 1844 he saw his very ﬁrst play, Theresa, or, The Orphan of Geneva. Lavrov was so captivated by the play and its performance that he was permanently hooked to life in the theater. In the pages of his memoirs, Lavrov pauses to give a plot summary of Theresa and to admit, after many years, that he wept for Theresa and felt a deep hatred for Walther.27 Lavrov recounts another incident at this performance. In the scene where Walther denies his guilt of the murder, a spectator cried out from 38 Richard Stites\n\nthe audience: ‘‘You lie, you son of a dog, bandit. You killed [her]. Look at these good folks [in the theater]; they are witnesses. Am I right, friends.’’28 The public in the stalls and in the loges laughed and the police removed the spectator. This episode was fairly typical of audience behavior in the theater—and not only in Russia. According to an anecdote, at the premier of Rossini’s opera Otello in Naples in 1816, when the singer playing Othello approached Desdemona in her bed, the audience shouted to the actress: ‘‘Watch out, he has a knife [sic]!’’29 Another example, related in Herzen’s ‘‘Magpie,’’ was the ‘‘old joke’’ about a good German viewer at a performance of Don Giovanni who shouted to those chasing Don Juan: ‘‘He ﬂed down the alley to the right.’’ If opera could induce this kind of belief, how much more could melodrama evoke such reactions, despite its artiﬁcial music and stylized gestures.30 The evidence on the reception of Theresa is thin and anecdotal, but certainly it can indicate its durability for at least three decades, and it can attest to its wide trajectory—from the imperial houses of the capital to commercial theaters at important Volga towns to the barns of the Kreshchinskaia Fair in Ukraine.What caused the classical composer and violinist Iury Arnold to curl his lip in scorn also drove a budding actor to tears (and to a career) and at least one spectator to near intervention. As in the other plays discussed here, the central ﬁgure Theresa is an agonized and ﬁnally redeemed or rescued woman. Theresa’s status as an orphan doubtless had its own resonance; a Russian melodrama titled The Lunatic Orphan Susanna was playing the circuit during the same period. According to detailed topographical studies of Russian towns, virtually all of the towns possessed an orphanage and beneﬁt performances for the support of orphans were common in provincial theaters.31 Judging from what I have read of reactions to melodrama and related genres all over provincial Russia (and in the capitals as well), audiences delighted in both ‘‘pity and terror’’—Aristotle’s vaunted description of tragedy. But they also wanted agency, action, spectacle, and thrill. A murder plot twisted around the fate of a victimized young woman ﬁt this formula to perfection. The Flight of the Magpie\n\nThe origin of the story of the ‘‘thieving magpie,’’ who unwittingly sent a young woman to her death, is obscure.
