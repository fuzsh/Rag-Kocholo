        "text": "Moody Amphitheater, the OTHER Moody Theater, the Moody Center...\n\nFrankly, if you're like us, you have whiplash trying to keep up with everything named Moody in Austin. And with two of Austin's biggest venues with Moody in the name, you may be feeling extra confused. We're here to break it down for you. Why's everything named Moody in Austin?! And what are all these things?!\n\n___________________________________\n\nWho is this Moody fellow or lady?\n\nPhoto via UT Austin\n\nWell, it may be 2024, but of course Moody was a dude. You don't think big city landmarks would be named after a woman, do you?! (Please read our sarcasm.) The Moody family began with Col. William Lewis Moody, who settled in Galveston and started the family business in cotton. His son, a Jr. by the same name, expanded the business into banking and insurance, and the empire began. Through several generations, the Moodys expanded their operations into news, politics, universities, and philanthropy. Their efforts in the latter are the main reason they're beloved today and represented around the city in various forms, which we'll break down below. The current Moody Foundation provides grants primarily in Austin, Dallas, Galveston and Houston with an emphasis on education, social services, children's needs and community development.\n\n___________________________________\n\nWhat's the difference in all the things named Moody, then?\n\nvia Moody Amphitheater\n\nMoody Ampitheater at Waterloo Park - This is a newish outdoor music venue located in the new Waterloo Park, an 11-acre green space in the heart of downtown Austin with more than 1.5 miles of hike-and-bike trails, stunning Hill Country Gardens, local food trucks, welcoming gathering spaces, and of course, the 5,000-capacity Moody Amphitheater.\n\n________________\n\nvia Moody Center\n\nMoody Center - Designed specifically for concerts, the arena replaced the 42-year-old Frank C. Erwin Jr. Center at The University of Texas and is home to The University of Texas women’s and men’s basketball games as well as other sports and community events. Moody Center is a 15,000+ seat premier venue featuring over 150 nights a year of unique entertainment, hosting the biggest artists and acts on the planet.\n\n________________\n\nACL Live at the Moody Theater - The venue that you already know and love sits down on the corner of 2nd and Lavaca. Hosting the best worldwide performers, ACL Live hosts both the historic ACL TV Tapings and SXSW official showcases every March.\n\n________________\n\nVia Moody College\n\nMoody College of Communications - The communications college at the University of Texas at Austin, hosting majors such as Radio-Television-Film and Journalism.\n\n________________\n\nMoody Drive - A street on the St. Edward's Campus, on which none of these buildings live.\n\n________________\n\nMary Moody Northen Theatre - A theatre on St. Edward's Campus.\n\n___________________________________\n\nGot it?"
