        "text": "Post by fatalthirteen on\n\nSo Amy Lee announced this will be the next single from The Open Door at the album premiere in Milan. I think it's one of the best songs on their new album and it definately has the biggest chance of being a hit. It's starts of pretty slow though and is sort of a power ballad so I don't know how successful it will be on alternative radio. Pop should eat it up though...\n\nPost by Crushcrushchris on\n\nI don't know so much about this one being second. I think they'd be better off releasing this third. It's a great song, but it's not alternative material.\n\nI think it'd be better to release Lacrymosa or something as heavy second before dropping Lithium.\n\nPost by The Human Strobe on\n\nThe second I read the title to this thread, I instantly thought \"aw crap, they're covering Nirvana\".\n\nBut seeing the lack of Nirvana comments in this thread so far, I'm going to guess this is most definitely not a cover?\n\nPost by Crushcrushchris on\n\nleo said:\n\nThe second I read the title to this thread, I instantly thought \"aw crap, they're covering Nirvana\".\n\nBut seeing the lack of Nirvana comments in this thread so far, I'm going to guess this is most definitely not a cover?\n\nYou mean...NOT a hot Nirvana remake!\n\nPost by singingsparrow on\n\nIt's wise that they're already thinking about their next release. They need to escape the mainstream overexposure in pushing their lead single \"Call Me When You're Sober\" simultaneously on both the alternative and mainstream formats.\n\nI think in any case the days are numbered for Evanescence at the edgier formats, but a more heavier single release could slow down the inevitable rejection from these formats.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNoah Eaton\n\nPost by Nicholas2.0 on\n\nleo said:\n\nThe second I read the title to this thread, I instantly thought \"aw crap, they're covering Nirvana\".\n\nBut seeing the lack of Nirvana comments in this thread so far, I'm going to guess this is most definitely not a cover?\n\nThey did cover \"Heart-Shaped Box\" when I saw them a week after Fallen came out.\n\nI would've preferred they covered something significantly more obscure than that, like a Siouxsie and the Banshees song would have been appropriate, but learning a little later how much Amy loves Bjork, perhaps they might have done \"Army of Me\" and sustained more credibility.\n\nPost by Gorminako on\n\nThis is one of the standout songs of the new album. I, too, was concerned about it being a Nirvana cover, as this wouldn't seem to be a popular title for a song, but I was relieved to find out it wasn't. (Not that I don't like the Nirvana song; I just don't care for covers.)\n\nPost by Lancifer Fama on\n\nthis is a pretty good second choice\n\nlately this song (and like you and good enough) have really stood out as my fav's on the album\n\nbut even so most other songs on this CD could have great single potential....\n\nkind of wondering what the video would look like!!\n\nEDIT:\n\nI also agree with wind-up ho-- lacrymosa would make for a GREAT second single... it has a really epic sound to it and compared to lithium, lithium might be pushing the harder ballad envelope which might be too much too soon....\n\nbut i also thought that weight of the world or sweet sacrifice could have some serious second single potential too...\n\nPost by fatalthirteen on\n\nI wish I could say that 'Sweet Sacrifice', 'Weight of the World', or 'Lacrymosa' could be hits at alternative but I'm not so sure, especially when 'Going Under' (a PHENOMENAL song that followed a massively successful first single) could only make it to #5 on modern and somewhere in the twenties on mainstream rock. If GU couldn't do it then I can't say these 3 will as there are just as hard and much less catchy. But I hope I'm wrong when one of those 3 are surely sent out as the third single.\n\nPost by Lancifer Fama on\n\nyeah the more and mroe i dwell on the topic to kinda figure out which are my fav's and which would be good singles i draw a complete blank because this album (as with the first) was a great listen thru from beginning to end\n\nnone of the singles from fallen really stood out to me either (except my immortal) because i loved that album so much as a straight litsen thru as well...\n\noh well im still anticipating this release!!\n\nPost by vinyl on\n\npicpak said:\n\nGeez, I thought it was \"You pour sweet innocence and drag your eyes, and testify\".\n\ni got that from the booklet lol.\n\ni cannot choose one favorite from this album. the list would be endless.\n\nand i have developped an unhealthy obsession with \"Lithium\" now. hahaha.\n\nPost by pen on\n\nAmy Lee is a stone cold b**ch.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nEvanescence vocalist Amy Lee is publicly urging her ex-boyfriend and former band member Ben Moody to stop trying to contact her - because she feels any relationship with him would be \"poisonous.\"\n\nLee told Blender, \"I don't hate Ben; I just don't ever want to speak to him again. He was truly kind of poisonous. Some people just aren't good for you.\"\n\nthanks Audio Aggression\n\nPost by vinyl on\n\npenance said:\n\nLee told Blender, \"I don't hate Ben; I just don't ever want to speak to him again. He was truly kind of poisonous. Some people just aren't good for you.\"\n\nActually, I know that feeling too well.\n\nPost by JayBoozer on\n\npenance said:\n\nAmy Lee is a stone cold b**ch.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nEvanescence vocalist Amy Lee is publicly urging her ex-boyfriend and former band member Ben Moody to stop trying to contact her - because she feels any relationship with him would be \"poisonous.\"\n\nLee told Blender, \"I don't hate Ben; I just don't ever want to speak to him again.

What she says probably has a lot of weight.\n\nPost by pen on\n\nevanescence0 said:\n\npenance said:\n\nAmy Lee is a stone cold b**ch.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nEvanescence vocalist Amy Lee is publicly urging her ex-boyfriend and former band member Ben Moody to stop trying to contact her - because she feels any relationship with him would be \"poisonous.\"\n\nLee told Blender, \"I don't hate Ben; I just don't ever want to speak to him again.

What she says probably has a lot of weight.\n\nShe's certainly throwing it around. That makes three people (Scooter, Shaun, and Ben for the uninformed) where she's taken what should be private and personal matters and dragged it out in public because she has trouble keeping her mouth shut when the camera is on her. And if it weren't for Ben, she wouldn't even have an opportunity to attack him for the media, so the least she could do to show her gratitude is to have a little respect.\n\nPost by Crushcrushchris on\n\nBeing a fan of the band, I can't really defend or blast anything that she says because I'm not in the position to...but the music that the band has made over the last decade (a good portion of which Amy either wrote or co-wrote with Ben) has been about somebody good or bad.\n\nShe puts everything out in the music.\n\nKROQ's started playing this."
