If you have stumbled across this page then that means you have found your way to my professional portfolio where I post some of my favorite work that I’ve done during my time at UW-Madison.\n\nI am a Senior from Los Angeles, California, so to say that the cold Wisconsin winters are something that is new to me would be an understatement. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, hiking, camping and essentially all activities that involve being outdoors.\n\nI am majoring in strategic communications with a minor in sport communication and am set to graduate in May 2023. I am actively searching for a full-time position at an advertising agency for this Fall.\n\nFeel free to reach out with any questions at all, or if you want to chat!"
