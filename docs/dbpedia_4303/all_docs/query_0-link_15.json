        "text": "Hell of a news blast incoming, but this won't be news to you if you've already signed up for our Seven Clean Seas newsletters... *hint* *nudge* I was just 23 when I joined as co-founder at Seven Clean Seas. 5 years later, after meeting Tom Peacock-Nazil, I've decided to step back from my role operationally within Seven Clean Seas and I'm shifting to an advisory board position. 🎉 What a ride, filled with blood, sweat, and a lot of laughter (woo, plenty of Linkedin content incoming). 💼 Looking back on the Journey is not something I can do in one post. From pioneering Plastic Credits to mobilise corporate capital for waste management, meeting incredible people and working with some insanely talented individuals, to working with on the FIFA World Cup and with Microsoft, the journey has been spectacular. We’ve prevented and removed millions of kilograms of plastic from our oceans and scaled our team from 2 to over 100 individuals. 🌊 SOME top Moments: - Meeting Tom Peacock-Nazil on the beaches of Asia back in 2019. Then every moment after that enjoying the sad beers, the happy tears, and the unbelievably good times. - Bringing in Oliver Kade to the company as part of the founding team who helped build the foundations for our world class plastic measurement department. - Being able to work with the incredible Siti Kusmiati, I will forever be inspired by your work ethic. - Finally, winning the tender to create the world's first plastic neutral mega-event, it's something we definitely don't talk about enough! The team we have at Seven Clean Seas is an incredible unit, thank you to everyone I've met along the way, I've learned so much that I'll take into my next venture. 👣 What’s Next? Seven Clean Seas is still scaling and I'll always be there for the ride! The best is yet to come, and I’m thrilled to watch the next chapter unfold. #Environment #Legacy #MakeOceansGreatAgain #NotSatire #Wastemanagement\n\n🔵Did you know... Seven Clean Seas started of being blue BEFORE the iconic yellow... 💛 Back in 2019, Seven Clean Seas was near unrecognisable to what it is today. It wasn’t yellow, we didn't have any Ocean Impact Projects it was just Tom Peacock-Nazil and Ben Moody (yes I referred to myself in third person) going back to back day-in, day-out. Without realising it we began paving the way for a monumental journey. We started laying the foundation into the unknown and slipped on founders shoes for the first time. Below are a collection of photos from our past-lives when we were blue our past, I'd need an entire photo album to show some of my favourite ones: 1. Group photo from Green Is The New Black with our some of the incredible people that help build our Ocean Loving community 2. In our yellow shirts, two very wet and wild plastic collection events! 3. Sweaty photo from the Singapore Marathon back in 2019, after 42kms 4. Miscellaneous mischief...featuring Pamela Correia and Tom's modelling days 5. Keeping the social media pumping during COVID-19, I was the original cardboard holding man - iykyk It was hard work but we definitely played hard too. From late-night strategy sessions to early morning clean-ups building a community who really care about the Ocean and figuring out real world solutions to the plastic pollution problem. This is the \"Past\" section of my 3ish part \"Charles Dickens\" esq. series. Expect the big one on Monday. #SevenCleanSeas #Throwback #StartupJourney #Resilience #Teamwork\n\n🌊 What Did Surfing Teach Me About B2B Sales? 🌊 Let’s dive into the deep end: What’s the connection? 🕵️ Prospecting: Not every wave (or prospect) is the right fit. You’ve got to paddle around, observe, and pick the perfect wave. You can’t be afraid to let a few pass to find the one that’s worth the ride. 💡 Discovery: Deep discovery is critical. It’s easy to get excited after a promising first ride, but you need to keep assessing the wave to understand if it’s a good long-term fit. Calculating the potential ROI of each wave (or client) is crucial at this stage. Just like knowing the tides and currents, understanding your client’s needs is key. 📺 Demo: Once you’re confident there’s a good fit, it’s time to show your skills. Don’t just focus on the big turns; highlight the exhilaration and satisfaction the other person can expect. Give them a taste of the experience with a trial run. Like showcasing your best moves on a wave, show your product’s true potential. 💰 Pricing: After showcasing your skills, your prospect is ready to paddle into a wave (buy in). Big tip is, like negotiating with the ocean, you must respect the value of your product. 🤝 Negotiations: Just like positioning yourself for the best wave, strategic negotiation is key. There will be some give and take. Know your priorities and be prepared to negotiate for what matters most while offering concessions on lesser points. 🏄♀️ Handling Objections: Even after this, some hesitation might remain. Use this time to reassure the other party that they've chosen the right wave and the commitment is worth it. Like riding out a tough wave, handle objections smoothly and confidently. 🚪 Closing: If you’ve navigated the earlier waves (stages) well, closing the deal should be a breeze. Send the contract, close the sale, and move the deal to Closed Won (update CRM else its all pointless). Just like catching the perfect wave, a smooth close is the culmination of all your efforts. If you've made it to the bottom of this awful post. Firstly, yes, this post is satire -Linkedin is turning into Facebook. Secondly, in the next couple days, I'll be running through the past, present and future of Seven Clean Seas until a big announcement. Turn on your notifications for me, follow me, connect whatever, grab my whatsapp number and buckle up. Fiver goes to whoever messages me first with what they guess the news is. #sales #b2bsales #salestips #closingdeals #B2BSales #StartupLife\n\nMy prediction for the end of 2024 - all social media influencers will be looking for the largest Tumblers, Drink Flasks, Water bottles, Thermal Cups, I don't think they're going to stop getting bigger. All of the big brands are taking off at the moment on across all SM platforms. Depicted below \"influencer carrying water bottle at the end of 2024\" 💀 I'm all for switching out to reusables but the rate at which people are acquiring multiples flasks is insane, not to mention the size of them now. With the rise in popularity of larger flasks, such as Stanley tumblers most recently, it has created a fascinating interplay of functionality, green habits and mainly social media influence. This trend highlights a consumer shift towards sustainable products that offer both utility and aesthetic appeal. After delving into the booming popularity, I'm not even sure people are buying them for their green purpose or to switch out plastic bottles, but is that such a bad thing? Many questions, not many answers. Will report back soon. *no affiliation with Stanley 1913 lol but there could be 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀\n\nPeople quite often give me the advice \"You can't chop wood with a blunt axe\". The same goes for theory and practical learning, I've learnt a lot when it comes to building an organisation and, like most, I never want to stop learning. I find it difficult to set aside time in the week and so recently I've take to solidifying and putting more effort into my business financial literacy over my weekends (excel sheets and a beer - what a thrill!). If you want to get better at something, it starts with the effort. Fantastic course, I'd highly recommend! What's something that you would like to improve upon? :) https://lnkd.in/gMfPsujU"
