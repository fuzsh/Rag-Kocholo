        "text": "Evanescence is a Grammy Award-winning American alternative rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1998 by singer Amy Lee and former guitarist Ben Moody. After recording two private EPs, and a demo CD named Origin with the help of Bigwig Enterprises, the band released their first full-length album, Fallen, on the Wind-up Records label in 2003. Fallen sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards. After abrupt changes to the band’s lineup, Evanescence released their second studio album, The Open Door,\n\nin 2006.\n\nFounding\n\nEvanescence was founded by singer, pianist and songwriter Amy Lee and former lead guitarist and songwriter Ben Moody. The two met in 1994 at a youth camp in Little Rock, Arkansas, where Moody heard Lee playing “I’d Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That)” by Meat Loaf on the piano. Their first songs were “Solitude” and “Give Unto Me”, written by Lee, and “Understanding” and “My Immortal“, written by Moody. The songs were edited by both artists, and they shared equal credit.Two of Lee and Moody’s songs found playtime on local radio stations, raising local awareness of the group and demand for a show. The band eventually appeared live, and became one of the most popular acts in the area. After experimenting with band names, such as Childish Intentions and Stricken, they decided on Evanescence, which means “disappearance” or “fading away” (from the word evanesce, which means “to disappear”). Lee has stated she loves the name because “it is mysterious and dark, and places a picture in the listeners’ mind.”\n\nTheir first full-length demo CD, Origin (released in 2000), is relatively unknown. The band also released two Extended plays (EPs). First, the self-titled Evanescence EP (1998) of which about 100 copies were made, and second the Sound Asleep EP, also known as the Whisper EP (1999), limited to 50 copies. Origin and the EPs contain demo versions of some of the songs on their debut album, Fallen. Forexample, the recording of “My Immortal” found on Fallen can also be found on Origin, minus a handful of additional string accompaniments. Only 2,500 copies of this record were produced; in response, Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download the band’s older songs from the Internet.\n\nLineup changes\n\nOn October 22, 2003, Moody left the band during the European tour for Fallen, reportedly because of creative differences. In an interview several months later, Amy Lee said: “…we’d gotten to a point that if something didn’t change, we wouldn’t have been able to make a second record.” This became a point of confusion for some people, as Moody and Lee stated on the Fallen album liner notes that they were best friends. Since then, Lee has said it was almost a relief that he left because of tensions created within the band. Moody was replaced by Terry Balsamo from Cold.On July 14, 2006, it was confirmed by a spokesperson for the band’s label that bassist Will Boyd had left the band for “not wanting to do another big tour” and wanting “to be close to his family.” Amy Lee originally broke the news to the fans in a post on an unofficial Evanescence site, EvBoard.com. In an interview with MTV, posted on their website on August 10, 2006, Lee announced that Tim McCord, former Revolution Smile guitarist, would switch instruments and play bass for the band.On May 4, 2007, John LeCompt announced that he had been fired from Evanescence, and also stated that drummer Rocky Gray had decided to quit. On his MySpace blog, LeCompt stated that Lee called his cellphone to fire him, and that no warning had previously been given nor were any negotiations made available. Gray later released a statement on his MySpace stating that he was served a gag order by label Wind-up which prevents him from discussing the reasons for his departure from the band. On the band’s official website, Lee wrote that the band was still alive and that no tour events had been canceled or changed.On May 17, 2007, Wind-up issued a press release stating that two Dark New Day members, drummer Will Hunt and guitarist Troy McLawhorn, would be joining the band to replace LeCompt and Gray. However, Lee wrote on the EvThreads.com forum that “We’re just borrowing Will and Troy for a while” and that they would not be leaving Dark New Day. It was initially stated that Hunt and McLawhorn would tour with Evanescence until the end of the Family Values Tour in September 2007, but both continued to play with the band through The Open Door tour.\n\nLabeling controversy\n\nOriginally promoted in Christian stores, the band eventually made it clear they did not want to be considered as part of the Christian rock genre. Wind-up Records chairman Alan Meltzer issued a press release in April 2003 asking for the band’s music to be removed from Christian retail outlets.During a 2003 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Ben Moody stated, “We’re actually high on the Christian charts, and I’m like, What the f–k are we even doing there?” This seemed to go against earlier sentiments by Moody that “We hope to express in our music that Christianity is not a rigid list of rules to follow…” and also “The message we as a band want to convey more than anything is simple—God is Love.” This has led to criticism of the band within the Christian community, even more so given that the band themselves approved of the plan to distribute Fallen to the Christian market. Terry Hemmings, CEO of Christian music distributor Provident, expressed puzzlement at the band’s about-face, saying “They clearly understood the album would be sold in these [Christian music] channels.” In the wake of the controversy, “Bring Me To Life” was dropped by many Christian radio stations; the song was Top 5 on Radio & Records‘ Christian Rock Top 30 one week, and completely gone the next. Ex-vocalist and keyboardist David Hodges eventually left the band over the controversy, with other members stating that he had been pulling them in more of a Christian direction than Lee and Moody were comfortable with.\n\nWhen asked by Billboard in 2006 if Evanescence was a “Christian band,” Amy Lee responded, “Can we please skip the Christian thing? I’m so over it. It’s the lamest thing. I fought that from the beginning; I never wanted to be associated with it. It\n\nwas a Ben thing. It’s over.’’\n\nDiscography\n\nFallen (2003)\n\nAnywhere But Home (2004)\n\nThe Open Door (2006)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
