        "text": "The Warriors are certainly hoping that people remember the name Moses Moody for a very long time.\n\nDrafted No. 14 overall by the Warriors, Moody's selection on July 29 resulted in a viral moment from ESPN's Kendrick Perkins on the live draft broadcast.\n\nMody Moody? Mody Mosey? Moosey Mody? Regardless, the Warriors are hoping that he develops into a star at the next level.\n\nWeeks later, MOSES MOODY joined ESPN's \"The Jump,\" where he was asked about his reaction to the hilarious mix-up.\n\n\"[Laughter] It was funny,\" Moody said. \"Everybody was sending it to me. It was a running joke [and it is] still going on.\"\n\nPerkins responded on the air with some praise for the rookie.\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\n\"At the end of the day, you were going to make a household name for yourself anyways,\" Perkins told Moody. \"But I think I just added a little spice. Now you're a household name. Everybody knows who Moses Moody is -- even my grandmother.\"\n\nRELATED: Warriors rookie Moody making quiet noise in Summer League\n\nNBA Summer League action is underway, and Moody's performance so far has Perkins doubling down on his earlier praise, which Moody appreciated.\n\nWhether or not Moody develops into the player the Warriors are hoping for, it's probably a good idea to learn the name: Moses Moody."
