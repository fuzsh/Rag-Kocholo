        "text": "President\n\nTexas will hold its primary on Super Tuesday and will be an important state for both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates in 2024. There are 161 Republican and 244 Democratic delegates up for grabs which can be awarded proportionally, meaning more than one candidate can secure some of them. President Joe Biden is seeking reelection and has no serious competition in the Democratic primary. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has a commanding lead among RepublicanÂ candidates.\n\nAt least some of the candidates on the ballot will likely drop out by primary election day, however. Texas follows Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina on the primaryÂ calendar.\n\nTexas House\n\nThere are 150 members of the Texas House. Each state representative serves a two-yearÂ term.\n\nThis election year, Attorney General Ken Paxton is seeking revenge against Republicans who voted to impeach him by endorsing their primary challengers. Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is also working to unseat the House Republicans who voted against school vouchers, one of Abbottâs top legislative priorities inÂ 2023.\n\nDisclosure: The Texas secretary of state, Theresa Boisseau, Santos Limon, Sylvia R. Garcia, Stuart Whitlow, Julie Johnson, Dayna Steele, Jan McDowell, Katherine Culbert, Pam Little, Merrie Fox, Gary VanDeaver, Jill Dutton, Kyle Biedermann, Erin Shank, Michelle Beckley, Walter Coppage, Stan Lambert, Norma ChÃ¡vez, Yvonne Davis, Donna Howard, Terry Canales, Senfronia Thompson, Brooks Landgraf, Vikki Goodwin and Todd Hunter have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
