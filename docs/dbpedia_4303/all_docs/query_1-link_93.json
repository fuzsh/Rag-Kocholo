        "text": "Imposingly tall allrounder Tom Moody arguably went on to enjoy more prominence as an in-demand coach in T20 leagues worldwide after his playing days for Australia in the 1980s and '90s.\n\nMoody overcame an early awkwardness against short bowling to become a batter who at his best hit through the covers and down the ground with power. He was a capable medium-pace swing bowler, safe slip fielder, and natural leader. His Test career was brief - though he made a hundred in his second match, against Sri Lanka in Brisbane, and another two games on, against India in Perth.\n\nMoody's ODI debut came in the 1987 World Cup. He took seven wickets and made 202 runs in the 1996 tournament, and took two wickets in the 1999 final against Pakistan when Australia won their second title. With that, he and Steve Waugh became the first Australians to win two World Cups.\n\nIn domestic cricket, Moody led Western Australia and Worcestershire to all manner of silverware. Dogged by back injury, he retired in 2000-01 and became president of the Australian Cricketers' Association and coach, while also dabbling in TV analysis and commentary.\n\nIn 2005 he was appointed as Sri Lanka's coach and was in the role through to their World Cup final appearance in 2007. Moody embarked on his T20 coaching career with Kings XI Punjab in the early years of the IPL before switching to Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2013; in 2016 they won the title under his tutelage. Elsewhere, he served as director of cricketer for the CPL, for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League, and in the early 2020s for Sri Lanka."
