        "text": "It's a tale as old as rock - band becomes famous, creative partnership behind the band falls apart. Tiffany Bakker asks Evanescence's Amy Lee what happened.\n\nEVANESCENCE\n\nHordern Pavilion, Fox Studios, Moore Park\n\nSunday, 7.30pm\n\n$72\n\nBookings: 9266 4800\n\nIt's fair to say you couldn't turn on the radio last year without hearing the very big, very operatic rock sounds of Arkansas-bred Evanescence blaring from the speakers.\n\nAd nauseum.\n\nBring Me to Life, the first single from the band's major label debut Fallen, went massive globally, reaching No 1 in Australia, the US and the UK. It was promptly followed by two more hits, Going Under and My Immortal.\n\nGrammy nominations beckoned (five, in fact), appearances at awards shows were commonplace, and sales of Fallen were fast approaching 6 million copies worldwide. They were also the darlings of the US Christian music charts even though they later claimed they weren't a Christian group.\n\nThings were looking pretty sunny for singer Amy Lee, guitarist Ben Moody, drummer Rocky Gray, bassist William Boyd and rhythm guitarist John LeCompt.\n\nBut the year ended on a sour note when founding member and Lee's co-writer Moody abruptly left the band in October mid-way through a European tour.\n\n\"It's actually been a relief,\" says Lee of her childhood friend's departure. \"I don't mean that as a negative toward Ben, but we've all been through a lot and we were at breaking point.\n\n\"And the thing is, we'd gotten to a point that if something didn't change, we wouldn't have been able to make a second record.\n\n\"Something had to give and it did - and we're all much happier.\"\n\nLee hasn't spoken to Moody since and won't be drawn on his reasons for bailing. However, she did comment to a reporter at UK music magazine Rock Sound shortly after his departure that: \"You don't do that to your band. You wouldn't do that to your friends or family. You don't do that to anyone.\"\n\nGiven the pair's history, it is surprising that Moody abandoned ship.\n\nLee, who grew up on a staple of her musician father's Neil Young and Simon & Garfunkel records, met Moody at school camp in Arkansas after he heard her playing Meatloaf songs on the piano. Discovering a shared love of Hendrix and Bjork, the pair clicked and set about writing songs.\n\n\"I don't think that either of us fit in that well and possibly that's what drew us together,\" she says.\n\n\"We were both musicians out of our element in this silly camp environment.\"\n\nWithin a month, the pair were playing acoustic sets at Arkansas book stores and coffee houses, before eventually recording a demo, Origins, and hawking it at shows.\n\nTo round out their live sound, Lee and Moody would rope in mates by offering them $20 or promising them dinner, but the vision of Evanescence never went beyond the two of them.\n\n\"It was more because that's what we did and how we worked rather than not wanting any other input,\" says Lee.\n\nBut ask Lee if she's apprehensive about penning another Evanescence album sans Moody and she gets a little bristly.\n\n\"I've always written by myself - even when Ben was in the band,\" she says.\n\n\"We wrote separately. I'd write my songs and he'd write his and then we'd add things to each other's. I work best by myself so it really is no different.\n\n\"I just think the next album can be nothing but better. I just plan to have my actual band writing and playing on the next record - they weren't really in the band before.\"\n\nNames have been bandied about as a replacement for Moody, with even former Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Boreland getting a mention in industry circles.\n\n\"Wes is a friend and we're talking about writing together on the next record,\" says Lee. \"But we'll see.\"\n\nFor now, though, one-time Cold guitarist Terry Balsamo has slotted in for the band's Australian tour. And for Lee, things are just perfect again.\n\n\"We're finally a real band, not just Ben and I and a few others thrown together,\" says Lee. \"The first show we played without Ben was sort of strange and weird and highly stressful. But when it was over, we had a really big party because we just felt this huge sense of relief - that we could do it without him.\n\n\"And it wasn't the end of the world and our lives would continue. Nobody died, y'know.\""
