        "text": "Brian was the son of Bill and Audrey Moody. He was born in Charleston, South Carolina on Christmas Day 1963. Brian was a loyal brother to his sister Alison and brother Brantley and a true and faithful friend to so many people. He was known for his integrity, candor, pragmatism, quick wit and infectious smile. One of Brian’s favorite pastimes was attending Clemson football games and enjoying all the tailgating that went with the game. It was his idea of the perfect day…family, friends, food, beer and Clemson football. Brian loved more than anything to spend time with his sons, whom he considered his best friends.\n\nBrian graduated from Middleton High school in 1982 and Clemson University in 1986. He was a CPA and owner and managing partner of Moody and O’Neal CPAs and Advisors. Formerly, he was managing partner of Gamble Givens and Moody LLC and Dixon Hughes Goodman LP. Throughout Brian’s life, he tried to follow what he called his “grand plan.” That plan was to leave Charleston and South Carolina better than he found it. He accomplished this by serving on many boards and committees from the Charleston County School Board, Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce, John Wesley United Methodist Church to the Operation Sight Board of Directors just to name a few."
