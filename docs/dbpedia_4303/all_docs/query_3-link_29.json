        "text": "Aug 16, 2024\n\nCVG and Cincinnati regional partners promote development opportunities at Farnborough Airshow\n\n8/16/2024Cassie Kiser / CVG Airport / August 2024Economic growth in the Cincinnati region is fueled by aviation-related economic development. CVG Airport â one of the worldâs fastest growing cargo airports â joined its regional partners, REDI Cincinnati, BE NKY, and JobsOhio, on the world stage in participating in the Farnborough Airshow in July 2024. The global event took place just outside of London, England. In addition to promoting how CVG has helped spur tremendous growth for DHL Express and Amazon Air as [North America's sixth-largest cargo airport](https://www.cvgairport.com/business/business-opportunities/air-service/air-cargo/), the Airshow provided valuable opportunities to promote major developments underway at CVG, including [Hangar Row](https://www.cvgairport.com/business/business-opportunities/air-service/air-cargo/hangarrow/) and CVG [Global Logistics Park](https://www.cvgairport.com/business/business-opportunities/air-service/air-cargo/globallogisticspark/). These two projects are key components of the airportâs vision to create a self-sufficient aviation ecosystem.An environmental study is currently underway on the Hangar Row site, and this activity is quickly building the case for investment opportunities. The site covers 350 acres of prime airport real estate, with direct connections to taxiways and CVGâs longest runway. The vision of Hangar Row is to create a one-stop shop for any aircraft maintenance and manufacturing-related needs. âWe want our partners to have the opportunity to acquire resources they need without leaving our campus,â said Rich Elwell, director of commercial management, CVG. âHangar Row will complement the existing business operations at CVG, as well as future business partners.â Global Logistics Park also contributes to CVGâs plan of creating a self-sufficient aviation ecosystem. Freight forwarders and cargo operators will have direct access to aircraft ramps and multiple truck loading docks when this site is built out. In addition, the Park will diversify cargo operations at CVG because its supporting facilities and infrastructure will allow for businesses to ship high-value goods and large parcels that do not have time-sensitive delivery requirements as is often the case with express air cargo and e-commerce logistics fulfillment. âCVG is a critical element of the Cincinnati region, already supporting more than 49,000 direct and indirect jobs and a $9.3 billion annual economic impact,â said Simon Wood, director of air service development, CVG. âWe are working quickly to fill Global Logistics Park, which will boost cargo efficiency at CVG.âHangar Row and Global Logistics Park are new developments underway at CVG. The team that attended Farnborough continues conversations from the Airshow and welcomes the opportunity to connect.
