        "text": "Ben Mouton — a name etched deep into the soul of the Bayou. Born in '75, New Orleans wasn't just a place on a map for him; it's the rhythmic heartbeat pulsing through his veins, gifted by Janice and Al, two NOLA natives. Whether it's chasing a fish in its waters, hunting in its marshes, or savoring a bite of genuine Cajun cookery, Ben's love for the service world and that iconic Louisiana zest came alive in those familial moments.\n\nHere's a spicy tidbit for you: The Mouton legacy isn't just about Ben. For over six decades, the McKenzie's bakeries, a gem in the crown of Southern Louisiana, were the Mouton family's pride and joy. From the fluffiest king cakes to the most delightful buttermilk drops, McKenzie's was more than just a bakery—it was an institution. But like all good things, it met its twilight when it was sold post his grandfather's passing.\n\nOur boy Ben might have grown up in Texas, but his spirit has always danced to the beats of jazz from the French Quarter. A high school graduate from Bastrop, an Eagle Scout, student council member, and a thespian at heart, Ben's journey from the Bastrop Opera House stages to the culinary lanes of New Orleans is nothing short of a rich gumbo of experiences.\n\nFlashback to a 15-year-old Ben, elbow-deep in suds at La Fuentes in Bastrop. Fast forward, and he's diving deep into the culinary arts, both in San Marcos and later at Delgado Culinary School in New Orleans. He's not just another name in the crowd; he's got the grit of Bourbon Street and the class of Arnaud's.\n\nReturning to Austin in '99, fate had a BBQ-flavored twist for him at Earl Campbell's. That's where he met Rachel, the spice to his gumbo. Their journey together saw them through iconic spots like Austin Java Co, Apple Computers, and Sherlock's Baker Street Pub. But 2012 was the game-changer. Moody's Breakfast House in Leander turned its keys over to Ben, and by March that year, Mouton's Southern Bistro was born, later growing into Mouton's Bistro & Bar in Cedar Park by 2018.\n\nToday, Ben's not just a chef; he's a storyteller, a community pillar in Cedar Park since '06. Alongside Rachel, their two treasures, Cade and Colette, have been muses for some of his most beloved dishes. Surrounded by family, both in the kitchen and out, Ben's gratitude runs as deep as the Mississippi. And that, my friends, is the savory tale of Ben Mouton."
