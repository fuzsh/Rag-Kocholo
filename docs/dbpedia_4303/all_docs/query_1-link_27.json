        "text": "Different styles\n\nIn our library, you can find and download thousands of multitracks of the most popular songs from the World repertoire! We do not have any preferences for a certain narrow genre: in this catalog, you will see music in many different styles!\n\nMinimal efforts\n\nWe help professional musicians to achieve perfect results in their creative work. With ready-to-use multitrack, so many difficult things become so easy! For instance, you do not need to spend your money on an expensive audio-hardware, pay for a studio, invite musicians, waste your time on recording, and so on, and so on.\n\nDownload stems, then import them to your accustomed software and work as you used to do!\n\nHigh quality\n\nAll multitracks represented in high quality. High-quality of source recordings allow a sound producer or musician to make a great final mix. But there're more opportunities which are not so obvious. For example, per-channel transposition and tempo changes, which are able with stems, give much more quality results than you can get transposing standard stereo-mixes and karaoke downloaded from the web!\n\nCreative approach\n\nWorking with multitrack is not a standard routine. It pushes the envelope! You have freedom in your artistic expression, but the potential to get an extraordinary final mixdown is much higher! Each of us can impress others, we need some time to try, and stems can help us make things right!\n\nFor any instruments\n\nWith multitracks, you will be able to learn music and transcribe parts very easy and very fast! If you would like to listen to the licks of masters, but do not have enough listening skills to transcribe complex arrangements and parts, you may learn your instrument in the multitrack by simply muting all others. All the details will be transparent for you while no other sounds around your part!\n\nFor any purposes!\n\nYou may be a vocalist or an instrumental player, a DJ, a master or a novice, a teacher or a student, a sound-producer or an engineer, a participant of a cover/wedding band or a one-man-band, multitracks are useful for all the people who have a relation to music!"
