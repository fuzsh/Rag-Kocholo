        "text": "We visited Ancient Olympia this week. The Olympics were very important to the Greek Culture. Why? Many reasons… It got everyone in the Greek Nation together…it was suppose to be fair competition (no trickery) and it allowed people to cheer for good sportsman. They called a Olympic Truce for people to participate or attend the games even when wars were happening. These games traditionally occurred every 4 years for many centuries. What traditions are important to you? Without tradition, art is a flock of sheep without a shepherd. Tradition is the illusion of permanence. Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay. It takes an endless amount of history to make even a little tradition. #tradition #comforting #history #security #peaceofmind #soulfulresting #olympics #games #competition #fairplay #cheering #goodvsbad KanKeta Global Sytems\n\nDo you know what the five #Olympic rings represent? And why they are the colors they are? It’s always wonderful to tell a story that teaches and connects to you, or your company’s passion or purpose. As always, Pantone, does a great job of storytelling through color. You won’t see the rings now throughout these games without thinking of them and their swatches. What story can you make more colorful? #branding #marketing #CMO #Storytelling\n\nFive valuable business lessons we can take from Mr. Dikec’s win at the Olympics: 1. 𝑺𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑭𝒐𝒄𝒖𝒔: success doesn’t always require complex tools or the latest technology. Sometimes, focusing on the fundamentals and mastering the basics can be more effective. 2. 𝑨𝒅𝒂𝒑𝒕𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑹𝒆𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒇𝒖𝒍𝒏𝒆𝒔𝒔: the ability to adapt and make the best use of available resources is crucial. Even without all the optimal tools, success is possible through creativity and resourcefulness. 3. 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒇𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑺𝒆𝒍𝒇-𝑩𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒆𝒇: believing in one’s abilities and skills can outweigh the need for external aids. Confidence can lead to high performance, even in the face of seemingly better-equipped competition. 4. 𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑵𝒐𝒓𝒎𝒔: just because everyone follows a certain standard or uses specific tools doesn’t mean it’s the only path to success. Challenging the norms and thinking outside the box can lead to unique achievements. 5. 𝑭𝒐𝒄𝒖𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒐𝒏 𝑪𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝑺𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒕𝒉𝒔: emphasizing one’s core strengths and capabilities, rather than relying solely on external tools or enhancements, can be a key differentiator. These lessons emphasize that in business, as in sports, having the right mindset, focusing on core competencies, and being resourcefulness can lead to remarkable success, even in a competitive environment. Do you agree?"
