        "text": "If there was any doubt, \"The Open Door\" makes it quite apparent that Amy Lee is truly the dark heart and tortured soul of Evanescence.\n\nThe trials and tribulations of this Christian Goth band from Little Rock, Ark., started when Evanescence co-founder and guitarist Ben Moody abruptly left during the band's tour for its 2003 debut album, \"Fallen.\" The album would go on to win two Grammy Awards and sell 6.5 million copies in the U.S. to date. On top of that, Moody's replacement, former Cold guitarist Terry Balsamo (who co-wrote with Lee many of the songs on \"The Open Door\") suffered a stroke last year, and bassist Will Boyd left the group in July.\n\nDespite being only 24, Lee is a powerhouse when she unleashes her blessed pipes and cursed spite. Refusing to play the role of victim, Lee, who now lives in Manhattan, shows there is more venom than honey hiding under her jet-black hair, pasty white skin and expressive light-green eyes.\n\nWhether she is reeling from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or slipping off this mortal coil to reunite with a lover who is 6-feet-under, Lee casts an enchanting spell on the listener with her sensual, seductive and high-strung operatic vocals. Lee intimately aches and quakes her dark tales of unrequited love, suicide pacts, vengeance and even necrophilia.\n\nInstead of Prometheus unbound, Lee is more like Pollyanna unbound on the leadoff track, \"Sweet Sacrifice.\" As if welcoming an exciting new chapter in her topsy-turvy life, Lee declares her independence, her emotional instability and her inseparable bond with all her damaged goods fans in the opening line: \"It's true, we're all a little insane/ But it's so clear/ Now that I'm unchanged.\" After getting reacquainted with the listener, Lee unleashes her festering hatred at a former associate-turned-antagonist (Moody perhaps). She scolds, \"One day I'm gonna forget your name/ And one sweet day/ You're gonna drown in my lost pain.\" With industrial-strength percussion that sounds like a nail gun riveting a creaky casket lid shut, the song shifts to Middle Eastern-tinged orchestration that gives the song a forbidden dream quality. That is, before the ethereal arrangement is pummeled by crunchy guitar chords.\n\nLee knows how to make a guy feel lousy. Not only did Lee give Seether's frontman Shaun Morgan his walking papers, she airs their dirty laundry on the hit single, \"Call Me When You're Sober.\" Arguably better than rehab (which Morgan checked himself into), the song unflinchingly chronicles their nasty split because of broken promises and excessive drugs while showcasing Lee as a fierce, feminine presence.\n\nIn Lee's universe, life is a constant free fall. And on \"Weight of the World,\" the listener is not sure if she's crying out for the return of Ben Moody or if a tube of Ben Gay would do the trick. Commiserating about the burden of her hapless existence, Lee makes a desperate plea to a confidant (or, quite possibly, God) to give her permission to let her old self die so she can start anew. Reaching operatic highs and gut-wrenching conviction, it's enough to even make the Almighty take notice.\n\nLee dives deep into the tortured mind of an obsessive fan on the scary stalker tale, \"Snow White Queen.\" Snarling guitars\n\npermeate as Lee reveals the diseased mind's dark and disturbing intentions. In the guise of the psychotic stalker, Lee takes the listener uncomfortably close to the action. Sung in sinister whispers, she threatens, \"You belong to me/ My snow white queen/ There's nowhere to run.\"\n\nOn the chilling Goth opus \"Like You,\" Lee suffers from a bad case of Edgar Allen Poe envy, where she wants to dig up the corpse and spend eternity sealed in his casket. The listener get tell-tale signs that the singer's a little bit loopy in the lines, \"I long to be like you/ Lie cold in the ground like you/ There's room inside for two/ And I'm not grieving for you/ I'm coming for you.\" Although we question her sanity (and are sickened by her necrophilia tendency), the listener never doubts her sincerity.\n\nWith her pulsating heart like putty in her abusive lover's hand, Lee pleads, \"torture me so sweetly\" on the album's sweeping piano-and-strings closer, \"Good Enough.\" Wrestling with low self-esteem and the stranglehold an unhealthy relationship has on her heart, a tender but tortured Lee sings, \"Good enough /I feel good enough/ It's been such a long time coming/ But I feel good.\"\n\nNo argument here."
