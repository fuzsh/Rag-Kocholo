On Monday, Moody, along with former Evanescence mates Rocky Gray and John Lecompt and new guy Marty O’Brian, will formerly announce the formation of Fallen, a band named for Evanescence’s 2003 album that’ll feature, on lead vocals, Carly Smithson, the “American Idol” season seven alum who looks and sounds an awful lot like Amy Lee.\n\nMoody told the LA Times he discovered Smithson when a friend pressured him to watch a video of her doing Evanescence’s “Bring Me to Life” from the “Idols Live” tour.\n\nAs to how the band will differ from Evanescence, Moody said the Fallen has “more intensity behind it. Evanescence was pretty intense. I’m telling you, this is bringing more energy than Evanescence could ever muster.” He also said he wanted to borrow from Cirque du Soleil.\n\nOn Monday, the band will offer a free download of its first song on its website, www.wearethefallen.com, set to go live that day.\n\nThe band will then gear up for a national theater tour that’ll go for a year and a half. There are no immediate plans for a debut album."
