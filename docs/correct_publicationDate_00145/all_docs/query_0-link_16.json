WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, Stokes, 1933, first edition, slight wear to the spine extremities and 3 of the 4 fore edge corner tips, some light dust-soiling to the covers, else a vg copy.

The source book for the 1951 film of the same name.\n\nFirst edition in book form, first printing. Publisher's original red cloth, with light blue titles to the upper board and spine, lacking the scarce dustwrapper. A good or slightly better copy, the binding firm with some bumping and a little fraying to the tips of the slightly faded spine. The contents, with the name of ['Obelists' crime writer] C. Daly King in blue ink on the front endpaper (in capitals rather than his signature so difficult to say in whose hand the name is written), a light water stain to the lower corner of approximately 100 pages towards the rear and the occasional mark to a couple of page margins, are otherwise clean and without loss or tears. First published in six monthly parts between September 1932 and February 1933 in 'Blue Book' magazine. A novel of world destruction by an invading planet and the flight of a few survivors to a new world. The basis for the 1951 Academy Award winning film of the same name directed by Rudolph Maté.

The top rear corner of the spine on the jacket has a 1-inch open tear and the remaining corners each have ½-inch open tears. The pages are bright and clean. Used Book.\n\nFirst Edition. WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, Stokes, 1933, 1st edition, a bright near fine copy of this classic world catastrophe novel in an equally bright vg+ first printing full color pictorial dust-wrapper with a small chip missing from the upper left corner of the bit faded dust-wrapper spine panel. Of three binding states, this is by far the scarcest and while we cannot prove it to be the first of the three such bindings, the logical evidence certainly seems to support this case as this binding has gold lettering on the spine only and measures an 1/8 inch higher than its other two counterparts; both shorter and identical in size, one with powder blue lettering on both the burgundy cloth spine and front cover and the other with black lettering on both the brick red cloth spine and front cover. While the priority of these bindings may remain unknown, it certainly was a long time custom for first state bindings to have gold-gilt lettering and later state bindings to be without. Also it seems most illogical for a contemporary later issue binding to be larger than its companions. Thus we argue and thus we rest, perhaps forever without certainty. The source book for 1953 film of the same name.\n\nOctavo, pp. [i-vi] vii-viii 1-344, original red cloth, front panel stamped in light blue and ruled in blind, spine panel stamped in light blue, fore and bottom edges rough trimmed.
