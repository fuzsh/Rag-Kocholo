        "text": "Classic sci_fi\n\nI read this 50 years ago and I still like it. Classic science fiction. Great\n\nOne of my favorite books.\n\nI first read this book in junior high school. This is the third time that Iâ€™ve read it. I highly recommend it to everyone.\n\nLiked It !!!!\n\nThis was a very good sequel to When Worlds Collide. written in the 30's, but still fresh 80 years later . I enjoyed both stories but thought they could have tied up the ending a little bit better. All in all though , I would certainly recommend this book. It was intense and kept your interest hour after hour. Should read the first book before this .\n\nEight hours later I am still thinking about it :) Good character development and plot and twists .\n\nI would certainly recommend . Thank you !\n\nDated but interesting.\n\nThe story definitely shows the political situation in the world in the early 1930s as well as the racial and ethnic prejudices. If you can put those things in perspective, it is a very interesting and exciting story. I read both books as a teen in the early 70s and remembered enjoying them then. I mostly do audio books now so I don't strain my eyes and do other productive tasks.\n\nThe Rest of the Story\n\nI've watched the 1952 film of \"When Worlds Collide\" many times. At the end of the film I always wondered what happened after they landed. When this book appeared as a daily special I bought it without hesitation.\n\nThe book was written in the early 1930's. The writing style seems formal, and sometimes wordy. Attitudes about nationality, race and gender were different then.\n\nEven with these drawbacks, I enjoyed the story. In my mind I could visualize the locations described. There were a number of plot twists. As I listened I wasn't sure how it would end.\n\nFor me this was an enjoyable, if somewhat flawed, book.\n\nGreat old sci-fi\n\nFun to read old sci-fi. Absolutely no computers in this story. Interesting to see how an advanced society would exist by author from the 1930's.\n\nlove this\n\nthese books have a great storyline and are consistent throughout. I have read the books and now listened to them and probably will again.\n\nVery interesting piece of history\n\nThis series was written between the wars, so it's have a little gaps of science and technology.\n\nbut if you ignore it, the story is good and well written.\n\nthe narrator is superb."
