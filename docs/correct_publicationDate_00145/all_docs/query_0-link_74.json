        "text": "Published first as a six-part serial in 1932, When Worlds Collide is a story of golden-age cataclysmic vision, bursting into the hearts and minds of science fiction readers ever since. The thrilling plot follows an astronomer, Sven Bronson, as he tries to save humankind from two approaching rogue planets that are sure to destroy the Earth as they readjust their orbit. Banding together with a team of scientists, the race to escape to the skies beginsâ€”but the more immediate threat seems to already be on the ground. When Worlds Collide was made into a film in 1951, and inspired various comic strips and pulp conventions in Science Fiction, and is now available as an ebook for the first time.\n\nAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied."
