Having made tremendous new discoveries upon landing on Bronson Beta, Tony and the American survivors, along with the other survivors of Earth, discover that their new home on this alien world isn't as safe as now thought. Further investigating the cities of The Other People, the aliens that once called Bronson Beta their home, reveals an ancient conflict between the Humans and The Other People, a conflict still burning. In Tony's adventures with his fellow survivors, they will discover the true origins of the Human race, and of a war fought so long ago that it has been lost for millions of years in the darkness of space. Now, as the fate of Bronson Beta itself is at stake, The Humans must unite with unlikely friends to finally conclude what happens when worlds collide. The Terrans of Beta is sure to please both science fiction and fantasy fans fans looking for an inspirational and patriotic tale of intense action and adventure while being able to let their imagination play freely with the abundant imagery and intricate characters with a plot that moves quickly from the introduction until the novel's dramatic conclusion. Fans of Philip Wylie's \"When Worlds Collide\" duology will not be disappointed with the effort this novel has made to stay in step with Wylie's original creation, while elaborating more on the story, and bringing it to it's grand finale in The Terrans of Beta, concluding a science fiction masterpiece nearly 80 years in the making.",

Captivated by the \"When Worlds Collide\" duology, and its apparent inconclusive ending, Helms spent many years researching the first two novels, as well as sciences used in \"The Terrans of Beta\", to create a coherent story that readers of all ages, backgrounds, and cultures could enjoy. An avid scientist himself, Helms has also participated in a vast variety of activities including volunteer firefighting, engineering/drafting, auto mechanics, lapidary, the full spectrum of writing, and is also a college graduate from GRCC with emphasis on CAD drafting, English and the arts. Throughout his experiences, Helms has been awarded in multiple honor roles, from Honor Society at GRCC to awards as Most Improved Student in the 2004 WA State Fire Academy. Also an avid political activist, Helms has participated in the late Congresswoman Dunn's \"Youth Advisory Council\" for several years, and is a strong advocate against discrimination and social intolerance. A patriot at heart, Helms wanted his strong passion for liberty and justice to be evident within his novel, while incorporating a small portion of moderate Christian perspective. Having been a civil servant for several years, Helms respects those who serves our country, especially those who have sacrificed themselves in the preservation and procreation of freedom and justice. Although Helms began writing \"The Terrans of Beta\" before the attacks on 9/11/2001, Helms has been inspired by his nations determination and perseverance, an inspiration that shows in this novel. Helms hopes that readers of his material will be similarly inspired, and while taking a moderate and tolerant approach to social climates, hopes that this book not only embraces the times, but transcends a message to inspire future generations as well. While \"The Terrans of Beta\" is Helms' first novel, he has also privately written a vast collection of poetry, short fiction, and inspirational essays, and would hope to share that material with his audience in the future. Helms aspires to be an elementary grade English teacher as well, so that he could pass on his talents to others just learning literary skills and trying to explore their own talents."
