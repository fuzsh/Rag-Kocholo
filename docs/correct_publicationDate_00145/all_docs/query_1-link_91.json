That is a euphemism forsaying I have written for money… But commercial glibness, such as I have practiced, is onething; life is another.” For much of his creative life, Wylie struggled with the desire to be asuccessful writer as well as an important one, a distinction that consistently surfaces in hischaracters who, while wildly ambitious, often fail to affect the world around them. Though hewrote for many audiences and in many genres over the course of his massively prolific career,Wylie was a formidable contributor to science fiction in the twentieth century and he broughtto the field an intellectual perspective and sharp wit that was more reminiscent of his Europeanpredecessors Jules Verne and H.G. Wells than his American contemporaries. Born May 12, 1902 in North Beverly, Massachusetts to Reverend Edmund Melville andnovelist and poet Edna Wylie, Philip Gordon Wylie was the oldest of four siblings in a familythat counted Puritan Jonathan Edwards and Aaron Burr as distant relatives. After his mother’sdeath in 1907, an event that greatly affected him as both a child and as an adult, Wylie’s family moved to Ohio where he became an intense and introspective child, spending much of his timedeveloping his own storytelling talents through retellings and modifications of Wells’s stories.But as he grew in his imaginative life, Wylie began to nurse a bitter animosity toward hisfather, an anger that intensified as his father remarried in 1911 and the family moved toMontclair, New Jersey. With a near-death experience and yearlong convalescence in 1912 dueto a burst appendix misdiagnosed by his stepmother, Wylie retreated even further away fromhis family. This growing isolation helped turn his storytelling into a desire to create his ownnarratives As an adolescent, Wylie published verse in school and church magazines, and, by thetime he went to Princeton in 1920, he was writing frequently as a columnist (under the namePhilip Speyce) in the Princetonian. In 1923 he published his first book, a privately printedcollection of poetry called Dormitory Ditties. But despite these achievements, Wylie’s time atPrinceton was not an academically successful one. His contempt for what he saw as ineffectualinstructors and incompetent (and over-privileged) fellow students helped keep his collegecareer short; he was suspended in 1922 due to poor grades and he left Princeton for good thefollowing year. Wylie’s experience with academia was to haunt his writings for much of his life,most notably surfacing in the scathing attacks that make up Generation of Vipers. After leaving Princeton, Wylie worked in a public relations firm in New York and hewent on to join the first staff of Harold Ross’s new magazine the New Yorker. During thisperiod, Wylie worked in all aspects of the magazine’s publication, from writing poetry toworking on layouts, while outside of work he was becoming acquainted with the artists andwriters of the New York scene, including Theodore Drieser, Dorothy Parker and JamesThurber, Wylie didn’t care for the modern art and literature championed by what he called the“Liberal Intellectual Establishment” or “LIE” and, though he too desired recognition, he foundhimself growing to distrust and detest those he saw as shallow and effete. After being dismissed from the New Yorker in 1927, Wylie hired an agent and tried tomake a living on his writing. During this financially difficult period, he began writing sciencefiction for pulp magazines such as Black Mask, Zest, and Live Girl Stories, work that wouldinspire his first real successes. His first novel accepted for publication by Knopf was a sciencefiction tale called Titan. Wylie, however, wanted his first novel to be a “serious” work, so hewrote a fictionalized biography of his father called Heavy Laden (1928) and, shortly thereafter, agender study called Babes and Sucklings (1929). Though both novels received praise from the“establishment” (Drieser lauded Heavy Laden and wrote the advertisements for Knopf), neithersold very well. For his third novel, Gladiator (1930), Wylie returned to the manuscript for Titan and,because Knopf was not fond of the novel’s style (it was significantly influenced by LaurenceSterne, author of Tristram Shandy (1760)), rewrote it in its entirety. Gladiator is the story ofHugo Danner, a man born with incredible strength and resilience due to his father’sexperiments on his mother with a human-tissue altering “plasma.” Danner is raised as anidealistic and restrained man, instructed to “use his powers for good.” After college, his idealismleads him to join the French army in WWI and later work in every way he can to curb themisery and greed of human existence. When his attempts are thwarted, Danner decides toeschew sympathy and pity and harness pure reason to help cure society’s ills. He joins with anambitious scientist to create a race of titans, just like him, that will work (through force) tocontrol and correct humankind, or destroy it if that fails. In the end, Danner rejects this plan aswell and his dashed hopes for humanity lead him to the top of a mountain where he curses Godasking, “are You, like all mankind, impotent?” only to be answered by a “bolt of lightningstabbed earthward” that killed him instantly. While the hero of Gladiator is, in many ways, a direct descendant of Frankenstein’smonster, he is probably best remembered as the inspiration for the comic book hero Supermanthat debuted in Action Comics in 1938 (a claim that some deny). Regardless of its purportedinfluence, at the time of its publication Gladiator did not fare well financially, selling around2500 copies and marking the end of Wylie’s relationship with Knopf. Following Gladiator, Wylie continued his steady output and slowly began to garnerfinancial and artistic credentials. In 1930, Wyle became acquainted with Edwin Balmer, theeditor of Redbook, a publication that would later feature a number of Wylie’s stories andserialized novels. In addition to finding a collaborator, this same year Wylie also found a newpublisher, Farrar and Rinehart, with whom he would work with for the next thirty years. Wylie’s first novel for Farrar was The Murderer Invisible (1931), a tale inspired by Well’sInvisible Man. He then went on to write a few “serious” novels and worked through a series ofquite successful murder mysteries with Balmer. Next, Wylie and Balmer wrote When WorldsCollide (1932), a retelling of the Noah’s ark tale in which humankind struggles to build a giantspacecraft to help save earth’s creatures and cultures from a wandering planet on a collisioncourse with earth. In contrast to Balmer’s wild disregard for scientific verisimilitude—an issuethat would often emerge in the course of their partnership—Wylie insisted on getting thescience of the novel “right” and thus he consulted with astronomers on the novel’s variousastrophysical details. When Worlds Collide was slated to be made into a film directed by Cecil B.Demille, but a suitable screenplay couldn’t be found, and the idea was shelved for twenty years.(In 1951 Rudolph Maté a version approved by Wylie starring Richard Derr and Barbara Rushthat received much praise.) When the novel first appeared in serial form in Bluebook, it wasgreeted with tremendous sales and has remained in print since, becoming one of the mostsuccessful science fiction stories of the period. Following the success of When Worlds Collide, Balmer and Wylie set out to write asequel logically titled After Worlds Collide where the survivors of earth’s destruction colonize adistant planet and struggle to maintain their ideals about humanity. By 1932, Wylie had movedto Hollywood to work as a writer for Paramount studios where he wrote the script for TheIsland of Lost Souls, a screenplay in the spirit of Robinson Crusoe or Verne’s The Mysterious Islandand adapted from Wells’s The Island of Dr. Moreau and The Savage Gentleman, At Paramount healso wrote two other science fiction scripts, The King of the Jungle (1933) and Murders in the Zoo(1933).It was also during this period that he composed his most critically acclaimed workFinnley Wren, a vaguely autobiographical and remarkably sophisticated story about a 48 hourperiod wherein a novelist named Philip Wylie listens to stories of the title character’s life. Awildly verbose book, Finnley Wren is rife with Wylie’s scathing commentary on everythingfrom education to gender to politics, but embedded in the sprawling book are individual talesthat reflect Wylie’s interest in science fiction narrative. Given its wild ambition and unflinching critical stance, it is no surprise that Finnley wasa commercial failure. Wylie’s success with scripts and genre fiction, when coupled with thefailure of his “serious” work only fanned the flames of his burgeoning alcoholism and bitterness.As the 30s ended, Wylie found began to redirect his energies as he discovered the teachings ofCarl Jung (Wylie met Jung in 1937) and, after a visit to the Soviet Union, he became a staunchanti-communist (as evidenced in Smoke Across the Moon (1937)). In 1942 Wylie composed the work for which he is best known, the Swiftian jeremiadGeneration of Vipers. Wielding Jung and two decades of accumulated bitterness, Wylie attemptsto eviscerate all the sacred cows of American life and culture—most infamously the scourge of“momism”, the product of that self-centered and useless creature that Cinderella becomes aftermarriage. The book was tremendously popular and, within a decade, sold almost two-hundred thousand copies and through conflict and controversy, made Wylie and momism householdwords. In the wake of Vipers’s success, Wylie continued elaborating on the various subjects thathad earned him his notoriety and during the war wrote radio scripts and manuals for the armedforces and even flew training missions in B-29 bombers for the Air Force. Wylie’s work with civil defense and the war effort eventually led him into thecongressional battle to create the Atomic Energy Commission. He gained top-secret securityclearance, working with Truman’s advisors and even visiting atomic tests in the Nevada desert.Not surprisingly, Wylie’s fiction began to confront the various circumstances of atomicdestruction, beginning with the story “The Paradise Crater,” which depicted a Nazi plot tocontrol the world using atomic weaponry, Blunder: A Story of the End of the World (1946) and theessay “Science Fiction and Sanity in an Age of Crisis” in Modern Science Fiction (1953). Wyliecontinued on the subject of civil defense in The Smuggled Atomic Bomb (1951); Tomorrow!(1954), a tale about a Russian attack on American soil; The Answer (1955), a story about anatomic bomb that kills a guardian angel; and Triumph (1963), a novel that tells about thedestruction of the northern hemisphere by nuclear weapon and the creation of a new worldorder. In the midst of this run of atomic destruction tales, Wylie returned to his investigationof gender politics in America with the oddly engagingly The Disappearance (1951). His lastmajor critical and financial success, the novel begins on Valentine’s Day, 1950, when everyfemale human being simultaneously disappears from earth and re-emerges in a parallel world.In the wake of this abrupt separation, cultures then disintegrate as people begin to learn thattheir lives were predicated upon foolish and shortsighted sets of gender expectations anddemands. By the 1960s, Wylie’s remarkable pace began to slacken as many of the magazines hewrote for struggled to compete with television and, as a result, his celebrity began to decline.But ever in tune with the times, in 1970 Wylie turned from nuclear destruction toenvironmental destruction, writing the script “Los Angeles: A.D. 2017” for the television seriesThe Name of the Game. The story imagines the protagonist is poisoned by carbon monoxidewhilst driving on the LA freeway and dreams of a dystopic future where everyone must liveunderground to avoid the lethal smog. Continuing this theme is his unfinished novel The End ofthe Dream (1972) (some claim this novel is co-authored with John Brunner) in whichhumankind, by attempting to use technology to control the earth’s environment, succeeds indestroying it utterly. According to his biography, Wylie estimated in his last years that he had writtenaround forty-eight million words and published one third of them. He truly wanted to believethat the import of his millions of words would not be simply “literary”, but something sograndiose as the attempt to save the human race from its own destruction. For Wylie, sciencefiction presented a real opportunity to not only speculate on the disasters created by theunfortunate confluence of ignorance and arrogance and power, but it afforded him a venue inwhich to present possibilities for change—ways to avert the catastrophes that, in his mind,were the necessary result of humanity’s technological and cultural impulses. But despite hisbelief in his work, he remained realistic in his expectations. He remarked in Vipers that, “while Iwrote about hundreds of worlds and solved all the problems they presented to all the charactersI colonized them with, my own world remained perplexing.” Now, as many of Wylie’s workscome back into print to join the others that have never fallen out, it seems that these narrativesstill hold weight for both the vividness of their fictional imaginings as well as for the sincerityof their attempts to solve the problems of the all-too-perplexing world that inspired them.
