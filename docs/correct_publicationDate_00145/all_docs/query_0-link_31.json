As it draws near, massive tidal waves, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions wrack our planet, devastating continents, drowning cities, and wiping out millions. In central North America, a team of scientists race to build a spacecraft powerful enough to escape the doomed earth. Their greatest threat, they soon discover, comes not from the skies but from other humans.”\n\nFun Fact: “The 1951 film adaptation of the book starring Richard Derr altered the story in several aspects and gave the spaceship a complete redesign.”"
