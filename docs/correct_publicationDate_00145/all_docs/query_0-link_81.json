I just discovered that there was a third sequel in this series published in ~2011, I am wondering whether anyone has read it and whether it is a worthy follow-on to the original books. Personally, I preferred the second book to the first, but that is, I am sure, a matter of opinion.\n\nBob\n\nHello everyone. I just discovered that there was a third sequel in this series published in ~2011, I am wondering whether anyone has read it and whether it is a worthy follow-on to the original books. Personally, I preferred the second book to the first, but that is, I am sure, a matter of opinion.\n\nBob\n\nI'm intrigued by this but have not heard of a second sequel in this series. I did some Googling but was unable to find a third book, just a lot of talk about a re-make of the George Pal movie that seems to be dead in the water. Do you know the title or author?\n\nCharlie\n\nI'm intrigued by this but have not heard of a second sequel in this series.

Do you know the title or author?\n\nCharlie\n\nThe title is Terrans On Beta and is available on Amazon - http://www.amazon.com/Terrans-Beta-...eta&qid=1464305671&ref_=sr_1_2&s=books&sr=1-2\n\nIt is a bit expensive, as you can see, for a paperback, but there are some used copies for a little less. I would also have to get After Worlds Collide to refresh my memory.\n\nBob\n\nThe title is Terrans On Beta and is available on Amazon - http://www.amazon.com/Terrans-Beta-Three-Collide-Worlds/dp/1461020638?ie=UTF8&keywords=terrans on beta&qid=1464305671&ref_=sr_1_2&s=books&sr=1-2\n\nIt is a bit expensive, as you can see, for a paperback, but there are some used copies for a little less.

Shame though, the story description sounds like it could have been interesting in the proper author's hands. Interesting, the Amazon listing implies it is based on a story draft written by one of the original co-authors of the first two novels.\n\nCharlie\n\nThanks, Bob.

I was just getting my hopes up, I guess. I assumed that Philip Wylie was still alive (instead of dying in 1971) and thought that he directed the book. However, it seems that the actual author, Helms, did a piss poor job of constructing a 'sequel' to the classic books.\n\nHowever, If anyone comes a 3rd book in the Hiero series (also left with a cliffhanger, of sorts), I would appreciate knowing about that. I kept expecting Lanier to finish the series, but he died on me too.\n\nBob"
