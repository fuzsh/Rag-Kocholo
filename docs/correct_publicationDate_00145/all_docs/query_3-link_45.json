        "text": "So, I recently learned that Philip Wylie, author of the classic science fiction novel Gladiator, one of the inspirations for Superman considered suing the creators and publishers of the Man of Steel for plagiarism shortly after the character's debut, but decided not to, because A: the creators were a pair of penniless kids, and B: it's not like he wasn't drawing on a thousand years of mythology anyways.\n\nBut what if he did? Would he be able to win? What would the fallout be?\n\nIf he sued a couple of penniless kids, I imagine the newspapers would vilify him. Could he have sued National Comics instead? If National lost, I guess it would lead to a comic book industry that's frightened of taking risks, and the superhero genre fizzling out in the 50s. If National won, that would have weakened their cases against Wonder Man, Captain Marvel, and several other characters. This would seem like a good thing, but it also has a downside of making a lot of superheroes that are dangerously close copies of older characters."
