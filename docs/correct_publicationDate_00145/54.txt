This is a novel about the end of the world -- the destruction of the earth by man himself through his willful poisoning of the atmosphere, the land, the seas and rivers, and ultimately of the human race itself. The end does not come in a blaze of glory; it is relentless, agonizing suffocation in a polluted environment, and all of it the consequence of human folly. The ultimate catastrophe need never have occurred.

In "The End of the Dream," the last book Philip Wylie wrote before his death in 1971, he renews his warning of the dangers of pollution. He wrote it in the hope that it was not too late for constructive action to counter the menace.
