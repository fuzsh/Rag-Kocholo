        "text": "Auditorium de la Maison de la Radio is an entirely new concert hall dedicated to the performance of classical music, built as part of the overall refurbishment of the Paris-headquarter of French national radio broadcasting organization Radio France, opened in 1963. It was designed to serve as the residence of the 4 musical ensembles of the organization, including the two full-sized orchestras Orchestre National de France and Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France.\n\nA competition held in 2005 awarded the design of the refurbishment and new Auditorium to Paris-based firm AS.Architecture-Studio. Within the constraints of a tight site in the middle of an existing building, the room shape of the Auditorium developed based on a central stage surrounded by audience on all sides and with 2 levels of balconies, thus creating an exceptional proximity between the audience and the musicians, and a deep sense of intimacy. In addition to computer simulation studies conducted during design phases to develop the room shape in details, a 1:10 physical scale model was built for acoustical studies.\n\nâ­³ Fact-sheet"
