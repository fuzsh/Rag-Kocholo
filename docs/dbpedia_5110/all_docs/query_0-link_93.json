        "text": "It is the middle of January and we already have a candidate for 1975's pop‐music ripoff of the year—or if not ripoff, then at least bummer.\n\nThe perpetrator was Sly and the Family Stone, which out of some well of egotism totally out of touch with recession realities, booked itself into the 6,000‐seat Radio Seat Music Hall for eight shows. Thursday night's opener attracted an official count of 1,100, and it looked smaller.\n\nAdmittedly, it is difficult to project in the cavernous Music Hall under any circumstances and certainly the task was made more difficult by the paltry crowd and the tacky leftover‐looking settings.\n\nAnd admittedly Sly's band sounded crisper than either some of its own past performances here or the soppily turgid opening band, Kool and the Gang.\n\nBut that does not excuse the indifference of the whole presentation. The show was set to begin at 8 o'clock, but actually got under way at 8:45, and Kool and the Gang finished their set at 9:30. Sly came on a full hour later, played 45 minutes and that—apart from a few lonely boos—was it.\n\nWorst of all was the quality of Sly's music. In the not‐toodistant past, Sly was one of the most exciting and significant forces in American pop music. But now he has taken to the stalest of rehashes of his greatest hits, ignoring his most recent work, submerging the communal energies of his band under a silly ego trip and rushing perfunctorily through the music he does play.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss Sly out of hand. Except that memories of what he used to be make one more sad than angry."
