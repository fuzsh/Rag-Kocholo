        "text": "HOUSTON, Aug. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nauticus Robotics, Inc. (NASDAQ: KITT), a leading innovator in subsea robotics and software, announces a partnership with Florida Atlantic University (FAU) for further testing of its flagship underwater vehicle, Aquanaut Mark 2.\n\nNauticus has contracted with FAU to perform Aquanaut Mark 2 vehicle development testing in the protected waters near the university's Institute for Ocean and Systems Engineering Dania Beach facilities as well as in the deeper waters of the Atlantic Ocean. This partnership is expected to result in approximately 90% savings on vehicle development testing. This phase of testing requires both shallow and deeper waters to fully test functionality while maintaining real-time communication via tether for instant feedback. It also provides the opportunity to carry out tetherless missions that simulate operations the Aquanaut vehicle is designed to accomplish. Without this partnership, testing in mid-range water depths would require the use of more expensive ocean-going vessels.\n\n\"Working at FAU this summer has provided a perfect platform to efficiently test the Aquanaut vehicle, in both protected waters for product development and open waters for data collection and sea trials. The location, and campus, at FAU has allowed us to expedite the Aquanaut system technology in preparation for commercial use,\" stated Daniel Dehart, Nauticus Robotics' Vice President of Field Operations.\n\nNauticus plans to continue testing Aquanaut vehicles in conjunction with FAU. The Aquanaut vehicle currently undergoing its final testing will move to the Gulf of Mexico later this month to begin commercial operations. Once ready, the second Aquanaut vehicle is planned to take its place at FAU to continue development of the next round of capabilities.\n\nThe Aquanaut vehicle leverages Nauticus' proprietary ToolKITT software, a versatile and platform-independent solution previously tested across various subsea vehicle classes. By harnessing the power of ToolKITT and the pioneering design of Aquanaut, Nauticus is spearheading the industry's shift from traditional tethered operations to augmented autonomy. This initiative aims to fully transform subsea operations into autonomous, highly efficient processes.\n\nAbout Nauticus Robotics\n\nNauticus Robotics, Inc. develops autonomous robots for the ocean industries. Autonomy requires the extensive use of sensors, artificial intelligence, and effective algorithms for perception and decision allowing the robot to adapt to changing environments. The company's business model includes using robotic systems for service, selling vehicles and components, and licensing of related software to both the commercial and defense business sectors. Nauticus has designed and is currently testing and certifying a new generation of vehicles to reduce operational cost and gather data to maintain and operate a wide variety of subsea infrastructure. Besides a standalone service offering and forward-facing products, Nauticus' approach to ocean robotics has also resulted in the development of a range of technology products for retrofit/upgrading traditional ROV operations and other third-party vehicle platforms. Nauticus' services provide customers with the necessary data collection, analytics, and subsea manipulation capabilities to support and maintain assets while reducing their operational footprint, operating cost, and greenhouse gas emissions, to improve offshore health, safety, and environmental exposure.\n\nCautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Act\"), and are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Act as well as protections afforded by other federal securities laws.
