        "text": "LORIENT, France — Founded in 2012 and based in Lorient, Jaime Radio is a relative newcomer to the Category B radio landscape. With a single FM frequency, it has opted for hyperlocal coverage. It is now the No. 1 radio station between Quimperlé and Vannes and from Pontivy to Lorient on France’s northwest coast. The station’s future lies in its proximity.\n\n“We’ve turned our weakness into a strength,” explains Jean-Philippe Olivieri, president of Jaime Radio. “We only have one frequency but make the most of it.” Olivieri, an entrepreneur, bought the radio station 12 years ago when it was in receivership and completely transformed it. The aim was to turn it into a music radio station for 25- to 65-year-olds during the day and for 13- to 24-year-olds in the evening.\n\nJaime Radio offers four presented segments a day, 10 local news flashes and a daily theme program in addition to its music program. “It took three or four years to set it up,” explains Olivieri, “and today we have a very high awareness rate.”\n\nJaime Radio has a daily regional audience of 7,300 listeners, almost enough to fill Lorient’s Stade du Moustoir stadium every other day. The challenge for Olivieri: How can the station expand beyond its home territory? Like many others, Jaime Radio is banking on DAB+ and has obtained six broadcasting authorizations for several towns in Brittany. But there’s no question of Jaime Radio seeking frequencies in other regions, as it wants to retain its local radio station identity. And to develop the audience, it believes the recipe will be simple: Be at the service of listeners and advertisers.\n\nGames and gifts galore\n\nBusinesses and retailers in the Lorient area are at the heart of the program. “Seventy-five percent of our revenue comes from local sources,” notes Olivieri. The level of local advertising remains stable despite the challenging economic climate. “Many stores broadcast us, and shopkeepers immediately see the impact of radio. We achieve a 70% loyalty rate.” Jaime Radio organizes numerous special operations, such as the “Galette” game in January, a partnership with 100 bakeries that entitles customers who find a Jaime Radio “fève” (a small hidden trinket) in an Epiphany cake.\n\n“The games work very well,” explains Laurie Aguirre, head of partnerships. “We give away €40,000 worth of gifts annually — tickets to shows or the cinema and products from partner stores.” Every evening at 8 p.m., the listener who wins goes on air. “They’re happy to hear each other and make a dedication — it creates a bond with the listeners,” says Aguirre.\n\nBeing present in the field\n\nThe station maintains this link with listeners through a daily presence in the field. Jaime Radio is a partner of all the major sporting, associative and cultural events around Lorient. The Interceltic Festival and Vieilles Charrues Festival are annual highlights. Every summer, a camper van called the “car magique” travels the beaches to broadcast on air. On April 6, Jaime Radio also organized the public casting for TF1’s The Voice, which drew 1,000 people.\n\nWith their four Renault Zoé vehicles bearing the Jaime Radio logo, the teams crisscross the area, posting photos and videos on the radio’s website and social networks. “We need to put down roots to stay strong and sustainable,” says Olivieri. This is a recipe that the station intends to duplicate for its future DAB+ frequencies (one, serving the Brest area is already up and running). It’s a specific program and boasts 100% local DNA.\n\nThe author writes for RedTech’s sister publication Lettre Pro de la Radio.\n\nThe French Connection.
