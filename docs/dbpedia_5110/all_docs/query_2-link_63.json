        "text": "On August 8, the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 will officially mark the end of France’s 100-year wait to host the Summer Olympic Games. Paris 2024 has invited the artist Woodkid to compose the original music for the special Handover segment of the ceremony, which will be recorded by the National Orchestra of France and the Maîtrise de Radio France choir school.\n\nTony Estanguet, President of Paris 2024, said: “On August 8, we want to share a genuinely emotional moment with the whole world, in order to demonstrate our enormous pride in officially taking up the baton from our friends at Tokyo 2020. The Games are the greatest event in the world, celebrating not just sport in all its power and splendour but the cultural treasures of each host country. Between now and 2024, we will endeavour to showcase the diversity of talents that France has to offer. On the occasion of this first ceremony of the Paris 2024 Games, we are proud to team up with exceptional artists such as Woodkid and the National Orchestra of France, who share the same passion for creativity and high standards as we do.”\n\nWoodkid and the inspirational force of the Games\n\nYoann Lemoine, a.k.a. Woodkid, is a true virtuoso. A writer, composer, singer and video artist, he is capable of creating veritable masterpieces of music, sound and light. With three Grammy nominations to his name, as well as a series of collaborations with internationally recognised artists (including Lana del Rey, Katy Perry and Drake), he is flying the flag for France on the world stage.\n\nWoodkid said: “It is with honour and excitement that I have accepted the invitation to create the first artistic statement of the Paris 2024 Games. For me, ever since I was a child, the values of sport and Olympism have always represented the absolute pinnacle, in terms of both performance and emotions. From The Civil Wars by Glass and Wilson at the Los Angeles Olympic Games to Dimitris Papaioannou's piece for Athens in 2004, there are certain Olympic works that fascinate me by their capacity to understand the ideology of sport and to make it universal. Performance, hope, endurance, never giving in; the intimate relationship between the body and the mind; the collective and the individual. These are all themes that I find deeply moving. This piece has also given me a new opportunity to work with the Maison de la Radio et de la Musique and to record with, among others, the children of the Maitrise de Bondy choir school and the National Orchestra of France, led by the extraordinary Sofi Jeannin and Chloé Dufresne. I am grateful to them for having elevated my work.”\n\nA performance by the National Orchestra of France and the Maîtrise de Radio France\n\nThe National Orchestra of France, led on this occasion by conductor Chloé Dufresne, is never far from the action whenever major international events are held in the country. A renowned ambassador of French classical music on the world stage, it also participates in innovative artistic projects involving a wide range of aesthetic forms, including the recording of film scores.\n\nParis 2024 also wished to team up with the Maîtrise de Radio France choir school based in Seine-Saint-Denis, the host department of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024. The symbol of a shared desire to involve young people in the wider project of the Games, the Maîtrise is a true school of cultural awareness and excellence that chose in 2007 to establish its new premises in Bondy – a town on the priority education network – in order to offer training for children and support throughout their studies. Around 20 of the 65 pupils taking part in the recording are based at the Bondy site.\n\nMichel Orier, Director of Music and Creation at Radio France, said: “Our collaboration with Paris 2024 and Woodkid is an opportunity to promote France’s culture and musical excellence to the whole world. On the occasion of this global event, we are delighted to see the National Orchestra of France team up with the Maîtrise de Radio France, an alliance built around talent and the nurturing of young artists, something that is particularly close to our hearts. This work is a powerful and joyous gesture that pays tribute to French artists and the values of Olympism.”\n\nSave the date: August 8"
