        "text": "It is common practice for news organizations to pre-write the obituaries of famous people, to ensure prompt and accurate announcements; The New York Times has more than 1,800 waiting to be rapidly updated before they are published.\n\nBut Queen Elizabeth II, Pelé, the Brazilian soccer player, Clint Eastwood, Brigitte Bardot, and many other world leaders, scientists, authors and celebrities discovered on Monday that French broadcaster, radio france international, had published their obituaries, much earlier than planned.\n\nAs reported by The New York Times, the obituaries—in unedited draft format—were accidentally published as the website was moved to a new content management system. Unfortunately for rfi, these obituaries were then automatically picked up by online platforms such as Google and Yahoo News.\n\nAs reported by Le Parisien, the channel apologized for its problème technique (technical problems).\n\nUnfortunately for some people, it wasn't the first time that their death has been announced—Bernard Tapie, the French businessman who used to once own the Olympique de Marseille soccer team, has had his death announced by news organizations three times now; first by Le Monde in 2019 and once earlier in 2020 on the sports channel La Chaine L’Équipe.\n\nFrench singer and actress, Line Renaud, whose death was also announced, tweeted that she was en pleine forme (in great health).\n\nAs one would expect of incomplete obituaries, not all of the details were complete either—one read, Ali Khamenei, supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, died on XXXXX at the age of XXXXXXX."
