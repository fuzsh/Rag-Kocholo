Based in Victoria, Radio Victoria offers innovative programs in diverse fields such as news, education, society, culture, entertainment and community development.\n\nSince September 2017, Radio Victoria is located in the heart of Victor Brodeur school. Thanks to this ideal location, our staff can be in contact with young francophones and introduce them to the radio world.\n\nOur mission is to manage and administer innovative, quality programs that meet the needs of the entire local Francophone and Francophile community through information, entertainment, and education.\n\nRadio Victoria is always looking for new partnerships and volunteers. You can get involved with our radio by hosting a show in French, by donating or by becoming a member of Radio Victoria."
