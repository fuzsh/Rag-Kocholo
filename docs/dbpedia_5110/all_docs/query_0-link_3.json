The local station France Bleu DrÃ´me ArdÃ¨che collaborated with us for four months as part of the innovative Sandbox Radio France program aimed at \"geo-documenting\" its content.\n\nIt sounds like a simple task, but the process of searching for locations is actually rather complex. Our NLP engine proved to be the perfect solution for accomplishing this. Every day, audio recordings are automatically analyzed and the results are presented in the form of reports, spreadsheets and easy-to-analyze overview maps."
