        "text": "The last episode of Season 1, is based on another conversation we recorded on the beach in Sainte-Marie.\n\nIn today’s episode, we have a special dialogue for you. We’ll be listening to a conversation recorded on the beach in Sainte-Marie where Anna talked with a French family.\n\nThis week, we are continuing our series of dialogues recorded in France. Anna is not feeling too well so we take a trip to the pharmacy to get something to make her feel better.\n\nIn this episode, Mark is asking the hotel receptionist for some information. Listen to the dialogue and the breakdown of the conversation in order to learn new vocabulary and constructions as well as using what you already know to work out what they are saying.\n\nIn this week’s episode, we are continuing our series of dialogues recorded in Pornic and Sainte-Marie. We have 2 conversations recorded on shopping trips in France – one with Mark and one with Anna and her friend.\n\nIn this week’s episode, Mark and Anna are in the Tourist Information Office in Sainte-Marie, looking for some information about the area.\n\nIn this episode, it’s breakfast time in Ste-Marie sur Mer. Mark and Anna are joined by Anna’s friend as they order breakfast. Having learned the content from previous lessons, listeners will understand much of the material in this lesson.\n\nIn this episode, join Mark and Anna in France as they arrive at the hotel. Anna plays the role of Jane Johnson, a British tourist who is checking in at the hotel. In this dialogue, you’ll recognise lots of the words and phrases covered in Lessons 22 and 23.\n\nJoin Mark in this week’s episode as he arrives at Nantes Airport and asks for directions to get to Sainte-Marie. This gives you the chance to practise listening to French conversation and learn some new language at the same time.\n\nThis episode introduces Unit 4 which will feature dialogues recorded live in France. Join Mark and Anna en route to Brittany as Anna tries to remember the words and phrases she’ll need for her visit.\n\nIn this episode, marking the end of Unit 3, we put Anna and you, the listeners, to the test. We cover all the topics included in Lessons 21 to 29 to see how much you have learned!\n\nIn this week’s episode, we continue with the theme of ‘feeling unwell’ but this time we head to the pharmacy to find a remedy for whatever is wrong.\n\nIn this week’s episode, we talk about different ways of saying you’re not feeling well and how to say different parts of the body are sore. If you’re lucky, you may even learn a song which will help you to remember those body parts!\n\nIn this episode, we continue our “transactional” theme. A very common situation while traveling is having to visit the bank so we take a look at some vocabulary and constructions which could be used in this situation to help explain your money matters!\n\nIn this week’s episode, we continue the theme of shopping but this time in a market place. You’ll learn how to ask for different types and quantities of food and how to ask the price. Finally you can listen to a typical conversation in a market place and hear the words and phrases in context.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Anna’s favourite pastime: shopping! We also test your knowledge of the French alphabet by spelling out the names of some shops you’d see in France.\n\nIn this episode, we continue the theme of accommodation, this time looking at the campsite. Even if camping is not your thing, the constructions covered in this week’s lesson can be easily adapted. We’ll also learn how to spell in French.\n\nIn this episode, you’ll learn how to make complaints about a hotel room in France – something which we hope you will never have to do!\n\nIn this episode, you’ll learn how to book into a hotel in France – something which is likely to be very useful when on holiday in France or any other French-speaking country. After learning the material in this lesson, you’ll be able to book the exact type of room you want!"
