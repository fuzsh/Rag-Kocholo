The content includes songs, stories and games focused on grammar, vocabulary and punctuation.\n\nThe series is based on an imaginary French radio station hosted by Jean-Baptiste and Juliet. There are ten topics that each feature a song, a story, conversations, games, rhymes, quizzes and sometimes voxpops. There is also a resident expert for listeners who âphone inâ with their grammar or pronunciation queries.\n\nEach of the ten topics is split into four clips, each numbered from 1-40. Topic 1 = Clips 1-4, Topic 2 = Clips 5-8 and Topic 3 = Clips 9-12, etc."
