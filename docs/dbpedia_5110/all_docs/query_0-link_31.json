        "text": "Aida Alami\n\nSomali and American, a Minnesotan Community\n\nEstablished by European settlers in the nineteenth century, it was once referred to as “White Cloud.” But today, this town of 68,000 inhabitants has seen a growing number of Somali refugees arrive in the last two decades to work in meat factories or to attend the local campus of the state university.\n\nJuly 2, 2019\n\nGarry Wills\n\nThe People’s Choice\n\nWhen Jesse Ventura revealed that he does not wear underwear, Fruit of the Loom sent him 12,000 pairs of undershorts. He donated them to two charities. Even boorishness, in the alchemy of this moment, became a benefaction. The citizens of Minnesota treat Ventura as a sly practical joke they are playing on themselves.\n\nAugust 12, 1999 issue\n\nRussell Baker\n\nThe Heights of Charm\n\n“Though all FDR’s medical advice indicated the job might kill him, he had grown into it. It was what he did and who he was. His love for it was so obvious that millions would have cried out in disbelief if told that he was quitting.”\n\nSeptember 29, 2016 issue\n\nArthur Schlesinger Jr.\n\nThe Ages of Jackson\n\n“If the frontier was the force driving the Jacksonian upheaval, how to account for the preoccupation in the pamphlet literature by Jackson’s supporters with problems of a commercial society—with monopoly, with banking, with the business cycle, with the unequal distribution of the fruits of labor, with workingmen, with trade unions, with class conflict?”\n\nDecember 7, 1989 issue\n\nGarry Wills\n\nThe Party Isn’t Over\n\n“Carter is criticized for his Georgia mafia, his personal righteousness, his remaining an ‘outsider’ even while in office. But all of these are necessary if he is to retain some claim upon the South. Denied the easy appeal of Wallace and Nixon to repression and veiled racism, he must cling to the distinctive style that links him to the South.”\n\nJune 15, 1978 issue\n\nMargot Hentoff\n\nThe You and Me that Used to Be\n\n“Looking back, I am aware that much of my life took place to music as if it were a film with a score: phonograph or radio interminably on, conversations held under the sound of music because sometimes when there was no music and we were driving or sitting around or drinking in a bar, an awkward silence hovered. Something necessary was missing. Things did not go on well without music.”\n\nNovember 4, 1971 issue\n\nChristine Smallwood, interviewed by Merve Emre\n\nWhy Do You Do It This Way?\n\nEpisode Eleven of “The Critic and Her Publics”\n\nJuly 9, 2024"
