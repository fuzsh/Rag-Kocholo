But hese frequencies are occupied by kids, idiots, ets…. You can compare them with the rubbish you previously came across in CB (Citizen Band). :o\n\nTherefore some of us are sometimes using the FRS/GMRS channels.\n\nThe only counter-plea I can ventilate, is that I am ccasionally using these frequencies over a year. I have been on these frequencies in Belgium, Hongary, the Netherlands, Turkey and France. I will swear an oath and tell you that before we start transmitting on these channels, we always do an intense scan on these channels on several moments. Before we start transmitting we also investigate the local European frequency plan on\n\nhttp://www.ero.dk/pmr446\n\nAccording to my experiences, these channels are not occupied. Obviously, this still does not give us not the right to use them, but I just want to describe the circumstances. Besides, we are never using the channels for a long time on the same spot. Mostly, we use them during holidays while we are moving around. So, even with the hypothesis that local enforcement agencies, police or a federal control organisation, should have discovered our illegal use of frequencies, how can they capture us.\n\nBut, let us stay tranquil and paceful. No one is scanning these FRS/GMRS frequencies for illegal use ! In worst case scenario somebody who reserved one of these frequencies for private use will be unhappy and make an official complaint. But at that time, we are already flown away, as a bird !\n\nNow, my clarification does not mean that you AMERICAN PEOPLE, coming as tourists to Belgium and the rest of Europe, can bring along your two way radio’s. Because if you all do so, the frequencies will be stuffed and my problems start all over again :eek:\n\nThanks and have a fine day.\n\nIvan, Antwerp, Belgium (Europe)"
