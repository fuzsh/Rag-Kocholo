Roughly one million people were executed as suspected political enemies or due to their ethnicities, and another million died of starvation, disease, or overwork. How did this happen? Timothy Williams details the rise of the Khmer Rouge. [Directed by Héloïse Dorsan-Rachet, narrated by Safia Elhillo, music by Salil Bhayani, cAMP Studio].",
