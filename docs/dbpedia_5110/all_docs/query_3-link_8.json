        "text": "Music was the emphasis of GI Jive with the soldiers’ favorite, GI Jane. She was the on-air persona of Martha Wilkerson, hosting a DJ music program playing the most popular records. It is said to have had the biggest impact on the troops’ morale with a young woman who presented a simple, yet successful formula: a collection of record requests, some cheerful banter, and occasional interviews with celebrities. Here’s a link to an episode from 1944 with GI Jane’s typical introduction.\n\nThe Jubilee Program (1942-53) was distinctive and innovative in many ways. It was directed toward African American soldiers and included some of the best wartime live-jazz performances. Jubilee featured the genius of greats like Lena Horne, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie. The stage MC was the jovial Ernie “Bubbles’ Whitman whose jazzy jive-talk made the show popular with a wide range of listeners, crossing cultural and national borders with its devoted military and civilian audiences. You can hear Ernie “Bubbles’ Whitman introduce Duke Ellington and a whole show from March 1944 here.\n\nAFRS was churning out an astounding amount of shows of great quality. But it was not only the pre-produced programs from Hollywood that were aired and were successful with the GI listener base. The most popular of the local shows produced in England was Duffle Bag with the DJ Johnny Kerr. The 26-year-old from Ohio had radio experience and was found peeling potatoes as a private at an Army Camp when Hayes was looking for people to work at his new network. In a poll of US Army troops on their favorite radio shows, Duffle Bag was number one. The daily two-hour show received over 200 fan mail music requests each week!\n\nAll in all, AFN was a huge success. American soldiers loved their own network as an audible link to home. For a moment, their business of carrying on the war could be pushed into the background. British listeners appreciated the station, too. Older listeners were reminded of the eclectic and innovative Radio Luxembourg of the past, younger listeners loved AFN for the music and the relaxed style it presented. In fact, AFN is known to have sparked the love for music in none other than the likes of youthful Van Morrison, Robert Plant, and many of their contemporaries.\n\nWith the preparations for the invasion of Europe came the question of combined broadcasting for the Allied troops. General Eisenhower was concerned that the Allied forces display unity. A joint radio format was envisioned as a cooperation between the AFN and the British and Canadian Broadcasting Corporations. The proposed “Allied Expeditionary Forces Program” (AEFP) was by no means an easy endeavor and never surpassed AFN in its success.\n\nAFN didn’t stop broadcasting during AEFP’s existence. It, too, had been gearing up for D-Day. Mobile broadcast vans were prepared, and their operators briefed and trained to accompany the troops across the Channel. The plan was for AFN to have one mobile station with each of the US armies in the field. When the actual invasion began, AFN programs were beamed to battlefronts via long-wave transmitters from the BBC, and then re-transmitted by mobile vans that were attached to the various units. They reported activities on front line and fed the news reports back to headquarters in London.\n\nBroadcasting from the moving front came with its perils, and bombings were a daily occurrence. The Seventh Army mobile unit was strafed regularly and Sgt. Jim McNally became AFN's first fatality when he was killed operating a unit. Shortly thereafter, Sgt. Pete Parris, an AFN news correspondent, was killed while accompanying a paratrooper unit into France.\n\nWith their mobile units, AFN touted itself as “On the road to Berlin,” and several mobile units eventually would be used to help establish the AFN network in Germany, Italy, and Austria. Once ‘in Berlin,' AFN had its part to play by providing information and entertainment for the now occupying forces. The final goal remained the same: “To Bring Yank Radio to Yanks in Europe.” It was here that AFN would develop the greatest dynamic that would affect even more listeners.\n\nAFN Munich was the network’s first station in Germany. It was founded in early June 1945 from a mobile unit attached to the Seventh Army. The house had been used by Nazi Gauleiter Adolf Wagner, who had a radio station and link to a transmitter installed in order to broadcast air raid warnings. Since neither the house nor the broadcast system had suffered major damage, it was a perfect setup for AFN to start operation in 1945—albeit with a famous blunder:\n\nStation Commander, Major Bob Light, signed the station on air with the words, “Good Morning, this is AFN Munich, The Voice of the Seventh Army.” He didn’t know at the time that Patton’s Third Army had taken control of Bavaria that his mistake was heard by General Patton himself—while shaving. He is reported to having lost control of both his temper and his straight razor when he heard Major Light’s mistake. With blood on his face from the razor gone astray, he is said to have shouted that he wanted “that announcer court-martialed.\"\n\nBumpy beginnings aside, AFN Munich was a huge success, and produced many memorable radio shows including Luncheon in Munchen and Bouncing in Bavaria. In addition, AFN Munich is famous for its historic news reporting from the Nuremberg Trials from November 1945 to early October 1946.\n\nAFN Frankfurt was set up only shortly after AFN Munich and began its operation in July 1945 from a confiscated home in the city. Once the station was made AFN headquarters in 1946, it moved to “romantic Hoechst,” outside of Frankfurt. The castle quickly became the most remembered and well-loved location AFN ever had, from which they aired the country music show Stickbuddy Jamboree, among others.\n\nAFN quickly expanded in Germany with stations in Stuttgart, Bremen (soon after to become AFN Bremerhaven), and Nuremberg amongst others. In 1947, Radio Annual reported that AFN was “still building morale” and explained to the folks stateside the importance of AFN for the men serving overseas.\n\nIn the years following the end of the war, the shows AFN broadcast changed, too. They aired less and less made-for-troops shows from AFRS. Instead, local programming hosted by GIs with news and music got more airtime, along with shows rebroadcast from commercial stations. Thanks to these transcriptions, popular American disc jockeys like Charlie Tuna, Roger Carroll, Casey Kasem, and Wolfman Jack later were also heard on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nIn typical American broadcasting style, AFN’s local stations aired a combination of “network time” (all local transmitters broadcasting the same program), and “local option time” (unit hosts and producers broadcast their own programs specifically geared towards the local audience). In some cases, these local soldier DJs , who created their own program and presented pop music, country, blues, swing, and jazz to the listeners, became local celebrities. George Hudak from AFN Berlin is a classic example whose live shows from public places in Berlin were attended by thousands of listeners, American and German alike."
