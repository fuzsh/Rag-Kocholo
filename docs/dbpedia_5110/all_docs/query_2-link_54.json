I know some anglophone ones but would love to know more diverse and more focused on “local artists” ones.\n\nThese are some I know:\n\nhttps://www.nts.live/ (based in London, United Kingdom)\n\nhttps://www.dublab.com/ (based in Los Angeles, UEA)\n\nhttps://modular-station.com/\n\nhttps://longformeditions.com/ (not a radio stations but cool mixtapes anyway)\n\nhttps://www.thelotradio.com/ (based in Greenpoint, NYC, UEA)\n\nhttps://stegi.radio/ (based in Athens, Greece)\n\nhttps://lyl.live/ (native to Lyon, France)\n\nhttps://radiorelativa.eu/ (based in Madrid, Spain)\n\nhttps://www.intergalactic.fm/ (based in The Hague?, Netherlands)\n\nAdded (who suggested it):\n\nhttps://www.sub.fm/ (@blaize)\n\nhttps://www.retreatradio.net/ (@proskynesis)\n\nhttps://9128.live/ (@graeissepia)\n\nhttps://somafm.com/ (@alechko)\n\nRinse Kool FM | Rinse FM (@proskynesis)\n\nhttps://www.noodsradio.com/ (@looms)\n\nhttps://echobox.radio/ (@Zijnvolt)\n\nOpenLab (@Native_Layer)\n\nhttps://resonancefm.com/ (@KF6GPE)\n\nhttps://radio.garden/ (@Forklift)\n\nhttps://www.netilradio.com/ (@waftlord)\n\nStream 10k Radio music | Listen to songs, albums, playlists for free on SoundCloud (schoolbabyboy)\n\nChill Channel (AhNaLogo)\n\nhttps://hirschmilch.de/ (deadfly)\n\nhttps://beloved.wtf/ (thesimplemachine)\n\nhttps://radiooooo.com/ (d4ydream)\n\nhttps://repeater-radio.com/ (DoS)\n\nWhat would you add?\n\nI like subfm\n\nMalmö, Sweden\n\n9128.live fantastic radio station!\n\ncheck the station descriptions to see the rough genre focus, one of my favorite radios ever.\n\nmy personal favs are groove salad, deep space one, drone zone, cliqhop idm, the dark zone, beat blender…\n\n(from SoMa SF)\n\nLooks like Kool Fm is under Rinse now but yeah, Rinse and Kool\n\nhttps://www.noodsradio.com/ Bristol, UK\n\nThere’s an iOS app for Rinse/Kool now too, lots of good archive stuff on there.\n\nhttps://echobox.radio/ is an amazing Amsterdam based station.\n\nResonance and Resonance Extra (resonancefm.com) have a lot of good stuff. I particularly like Resonance Extra for the experimental field recording stuff they run frequently.\n\nI’d echo @alechko about SomaFM, too. Great set of stations, and pretty cool merch. I have a ridiculous number of stickers from them.\n\nI use an app very similar to Google Earth to search for interesting broadcast radios:\n\nWell, it’s not electronic oriented, there’s any type of sound. I find it fun to listen to for those non-globalized nations where I can finally find something that amazes me\n\nIncredible stuff, added all your submissions!\n\nelectronic music not always the focus, but that’s never a bad tihng.\n\nI make a radio show podcast on Soundcloud where I showcase music from artists with less than 10,000 followers on Soundcloud. Focuses mostly on bass focused music but theres also chiller, brighter music highlighted as well!\n\nI really dig Psyndora Chillout!\n\nThat Synphaera channel on SomaFM is top notch as well!\n\n+1 for Soma and NTS\n\nAlso I just discovered Hirschmilch which seems to have about 3 decent stations\n\nGroove Salad is awesome! Used to listen to this over a Shoutcast stream on Winamp back in the early 2000s.\n\nGreat thread! Jumped on to suggest intergalactic fm but it’s already in the OP. Some awesome recommendations here and many I’ve not heard of so keen to get exploring - thanks!\n\nBeloved Radio, based in Chicago, has drawn comparisons to NTS and Dublab in local publications. They’ve only been around a year, but doing some cool stuff focusing on musician- and artist-curated shows rather than strictly DJs."
