        "text": "Thank you for joining us on the official Paris 2024 Olympic Games live blog!\n\nIt’s been a wonderful 16 days of official action (and an additional two of preliminaries before that), but all good things must come to an end.\n\nAnd that means for us, the journey has finished for another Olympic Games.\n\nBut don’t turn your attention away. The Paralympic Games begin on 28 August in Paris. And the next Olympic Winter Games in Milano-Cortina, Italy, are in only a year and a half’s time.\n\nDon’t forget to keep coming back to Olympics.com for all the best sports action between now and then – we’ve got you covered, even when the Olympic Games aren’t underway.\n\nAll that’s left to say is Merci, bonne soirée, au revoir et à bientôt – thank you, good evening, goodbye and see you soon.\n\nIt’s been an absolute pleasure bringing you all the action from Paris.\n\nWe leave you with a gallery of the best images from tonight's Closing Ceremony.\n\nClosing Ceremony: The Olympic Games are declared closed\n\nLéon Marchand has arrived at the Stade de France with the Olympic Flame from the Jardins des Tuileries.\n\nThe audience who have stayed are giving him a warm welcome. \"Léon, Léon,\" the stadium chants as one.\n\nThe six athletes who accompanied Tony Estanguet and President Thomas Bach's speeches earlier wait for him on stage, as does the IOC President.\n\nPresident Bach declares the Games closed, then the six athletes and Marchand blow out the flame in the lantern.\n\n“In accordance with tradition, I call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in Los Angeles, United States of America, to celebrate with all of us the Games of the XXXIV Olympiad,” President Bach adds.\n\nClosing Ceremony: Wait, is that Tom Cruise?\n\nYes, that is Tom Cruise, rappelling from the Stade de France roof!\n\nHe will help transport the Olympic Flag from here in Paris to Los Angeles, via the streets of Paris and the hills of Hollywood, as he takes the flag from Simone Biles.\n\nAnd that's the famous Hollywood sign, with a few extra Olympic rings! All the while, the Red Hot Chili Peppers play in the background.\n\nAlong the way, we see cameos from friends and Olympians Kate Courtney (mountain bike, 2020), Michael Johnson (track and field athletics, four-time Olympic champion, 1992-2000), and Jagger Eaton (skateboarding, two-time Olympic medallist, 2020-2024).\n\nCourtney takes us downtown to the LA Memorial Coliseum, which was a venue in 1932 and 1984; Johnson through the neighbourhoods of LA; and Eaton finishes the flag relay at the world-famous Venice Beach.\n\nClosing Ceremony: IOC President Thomas Bach gives speech\n\nAddressing the athletes, IOC President Thomas Bach, 1976 fencing Olympic champion, says: \"Despite all the tensions in our world, you came here from all 206 national Olympic committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team, to make the City of Light shine brighter than ever before.\n\n\"Your performances were amazing. You competed fiercely against each other. Every contest on the edge of perfection. Every performance sparking excitement around the world. You showed us what greatness we humans are capable of.\n\n“The Olympic Games Paris 2024 were a celebration of the athletes and of sport at its best.\n\n“The first Olympic Games delivered completely under our Olympic Agenda reforms: younger, more urban, more inclusive, more sustainable. The first Olympic Games with full gender parity.\n\n“These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish – or dare I say: Seine-sational Games.”"
