        "text": "Timeline: The History of Public Broadcasting in the U.S.\n\nPublic broadcasting in the U.S. has grown from local and regional roots at schools and universities into a nationally known source of news and entertainment for millions of listeners and viewers. Our timeline of public broadcasting’s history traces its growth from the earliest radio broadcasts to its days as the home of Big Bird, Frontline and Terry Gross. We hit the landmark events, like the signing of the Public Broadcasting Act, and include lesser-known milestones as well — like the airplane circling over Indiana that broadcast educational TV shows to six states. Dive in and discover how public media became what it is today.\n\nThis is a revised and updated version of the timeline that appeared in our book A History of Public Broadcasting, published in 2000. A new version of the book is forthcoming.\n\nEntries by Karen Everhart, Mike Janssen and Steve Behrens\n\nWith the Morrill Act, Congress endows state universities with land grants, creating what some observers believe was a philosophical precedent for public broadcasting and its public funding.\n\nGuglielmo Marconi sends a wireless signal from his family estate in Italy.\n\nIowa State College’s station 9YI (named WOI since 1922) experiments with broadcasting in Morse code.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin begins voice broadcasting with radio station 9XM, forerunner of WHA, under an experimental license.\n\nThe federal government issues the first license to an educational institution, Latter-day Saints University in Salt Lake City.\n\nA forerunner of PBS and NPR is formed: the Association of College and University Broadcasting Stations (ACUBS). It later becomes the National Association of Educational Broadcasters.\n\nThe Carnegie Corporation of New York, with NBC, creates the National Advisory Council on Radio in Education (NACRE) to promote a “Cooperation Doctrine” — alliances between commercial radio and educators.\n\nACUBS asks Congress to reserve channels for education.\n\nACUBS changes its constitution and renames itself the National Association of Educational Broadcasters.\n\nThe FCC establishes a new class of noncommercial educational radio stations in the high-frequency band.\n\nThe FCC reserves five of the 40 channels in the new high-frequency band for noncommercial educational stations. Though planned for AM, the stations go to FM as technology develops.\n\nThe FCC moves FM service to the VHF band and expands noncommercial FM reservation to 20 channels (88-92 MHz) of the total 100 FM channels.\n\nWNYC begins a “bicycle network,” shipping taped radio programs from station to station.\n\nPacifica begins operation of KPFA in Berkeley, claimed to be the first listener-supported station.\n\nThe FCC allocates local TV channels and reserves 242 for noncommercial educational TV.\n\nThe Ford Foundation funds the Educational Television and Radio Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., to distribute programs.\n\nThe University of Houston signs on the first noncommercial educational TV station, KUHT.\n\nKQED in San Francisco pioneers the public TV fundraising auction.\n\nCongress passes the National Defense Education Act, which aids numerous instructional TV projects.\n\nUnder new president John White, Educational Television and Radio Center adds “National” to its name. It later moves to New York City and becomes National Educational Television, NET.\n\nTaped live with an early videotape machine recently installed at Denver’s KRMA, The Ragtime Era premieres. It becomes NET’s most popular show, adding fun to educational TV’s arts programming and making Max Morath a star.\n\nEastern Educational Television Network (EEN) incorporates after a 1959 demonstration of a hookup between Boston and Durham, N.H. Founded by WGBH President Hartford Gunn to boost the supply of programs available to stations in the Northeast, it was the first regional public TV network. Julia Child’s The French Chef, produced at WGBH, later becomes one of EEN’s most successful programs. EEN later grows into the national distributor now known as American Public Television.\n\nThe Midwest Program for Airborne Television Instruction (MPATI) experimentally broadcasts instructional television programs to six states from an airliner circling above Indiana.\n\nThe Educational Radio Network achieves regional interconnection to distribute Kaleidoscope, a daily newsmagazine that originates in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.\n\nEducational TV stations begin airing the BBC’s An Age of Kings, a 15-part combination of Shakespeare’s history plays that becomes one of public TV’s earliest hits.\n\nPresident Kennedy signs the Educational Television Facilities Act, bringing the first major federal aid to public broadcasting. The act was a predecessor of the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program.\n\nThe All-Channel Receiver Act is signed into law, aiding reception of UHF stations, including many educational stations.\n\nNew York City finally gets a public TV station, as WNDT, later WNET, signs on.\n\nKRAB-FM, the first of community-radio pioneer Lorenzo Milam’s “Krab Nebula” of stations, signs on in Seattle.\n\nThe FCC authorizes the first statewide educational TV translator network, in Utah.\n\nThe FCC allows Instructional Television Fixed Service microwave transmissions for education. Public TV stations were among the educational institutions awarded licenses for the channels, which delivered ITV programs to receivers in public and private schools, colleges and universities.\n\nNAEB’s First Conference on Long-Range Financing proposes a presidential commission on future funding. The idea for a study of educational TV’s financial needs is suggested, which later becomes the Carnegie Commission.\n\nThe Carnegie Corporation of New York establishes the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television (Carnegie I).\n\nThe Ford Foundation proposes to the FCC that profits from a nonprofit communications satellite system for all broadcasters would go to public broadcasting. The proposed “Bundy Bird,” named after Ford Foundation President McGeorge Bundy, was quashed at the FCC by “bureaucratic torpor” induced by opposition from “all the giant communications companies,” James Day writes in The Vanishing Vision: The Inside Story of Public Television. But media coverage of the “Bundy Bird” called attention to educational TV’s funding needs. The proposal also helped make the case for an interconnection system to transmit programs to stations.\n\nMister Rogers’ Neighborhood debuts on Pittsburgh’s WQED. It premieres nationally on NET Feb. 19, 1968.\n\nCarnegie I releases a report proposing federal aid and an extension of educational TV called “public television.”\n\nWETA premieres Washington Week in Review. It goes national on PBS in 1969.\n\nAn NAEB report, The Hidden Medium, promotes aid to educational radio as well. Though the Carnegie report and original legislation would have aided only TV, the final Senate bill creating CPB also includes radio, thanks to a concerted campaign by Jerold Sandler and other radio advocates.\n\nThe Ford Foundation launches Public Broadcast Laboratory, a live Sunday-night magazine program. (CBS starts 60 Minutes a year later.)\n\nPresident Johnson signs the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, authorizing federal operating aid to stations through a new agency, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. CPB funding decisions would be made year to year; Congress wouldn’t consider endowing a long-term funding source.\n\nCPB incorporates. Its first president, John W. Macy, signs on in January 1969.\n\nNewsroom, a daily local news program that KQED in San Francisco launched as Newspaper of the Air during a newspaper strike, returns with funding from the Ford Foundation. Staffed by a team of print-trained reporters and anchor Mel Wax, the show pioneered the roundtable format of journalists discussing news of the day. Newsroom won duPont-Columbia and Peabody Awards during its nine-year run, but KQED couldn’t sustain it when Ford’s grant ended.\n\nNET begins regular interconnection for educational TV; the BBC drama The Forsyte Saga is a hit.\n\nCPB begins general support grants to stations, later called Community Service Grants.\n\nFred Rogers makes a successful appeal for CPB’s first appropriation with a moving plea to Sen. John Pastore (D-R.I), who says afterward, “Looks like you just earned $20 million.” Hartford Gunn accompanies Rogers at the witness table.\n\nSesame Street debuts. The show’s creator, Children’s Television Workshop, developed Sesame with new levels of collaboration among writers, producers and researchers, and extensive testing on young viewers to determine how effectively the program achieved its educational goals. An instant success, Sesame Street goes on to win two Peabody Awards, dozens of Emmys and many other honors.\n\nThe PBS Board chooses Hartford Gunn as the network’s first president.\n\nNPR incorporates. Don Quayle is to become its first president.\n\nNET and WNDT merge, creating WNET.\n\nPBS carries NET’s Banks and the Poor by Morton Silverstein, generating controversy.\n\nWGBH’s Masterpiece Theatre debuts with “The First Churchills,” a BBC drama about the 17th-century forebears of Winston Churchill.\n\nWNET debuts The Great American Dream Machine, a groundbreaking variety TV show featuring contributions from Kurt Vonnegut, Albert Brooks, Studs Terkel and others.\n\nNPR begins service with a live broadcast of Senate hearings on ending the Vietnam War.\n\nNPR launches All Things Considered with a 24-minute sound portrait of protests against the Vietnam War that took place that day in Washington, D.C. Robert Conley hosts the program. In 2017, the broadcast was inducted into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.\n\nCPB announces the creation of the National Public Affairs Center for Television (NPACT) as a headquarters for public affairs programs covering the nation’s capital. Sander Vanocur, an experienced NBC journalist, is hired to co-anchor programs with Robert MacNeil, a Canadian broadcast journalist and international correspondent. In his book The Vanishing Vision: The Inside Story of Public Television, James Day writes that the hiring of Vanocur and MacNeil enraged President Nixon, who was nursing a grudge over Vanocur’s aggressive questioning during his 1960 presidential campaign.\n\nNixon aide Clay Whitehead challenges public TV in a speech at an NAEB meeting. Criticizing local broadcasters for betraying the vision of the Carnegie Commission, he assails decisions to create PBS and NPACT as moves to centralize program decisions and turn over control of public-affairs programming to the Ford Foundation.\n\nPresident Nixon vetoes a two-year CPB authorizing law; a reduced one-year bill is enacted later. John Macy resigns as CPB president over the board’s refusal to protest the veto. Macy is succeeded by Henry Loomis. Frank Pace, CPB’s first chairman, also quits, succeeded by Tom Curtis.\n\nTo shield program funding decisions from political interference following Nixon’s veto of CPB’s authorization, PBS President Hartford Gunn proposes the Station Program Cooperative, a marketplace for stations to choose which national programs they would support. PBS manages the SPC until 1989.\n\nPBS airs WNET’s first Great Performances with a production of The Rimers of Eldritch, a Lanford Wilson play featuring the up-and-coming actress Susan Sarandon.\n\nRobert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer team up on NPACT’s coverage of Senate Watergate hearings.\n\nPublic radio stations form the Association of Public Radio Stations to lobby for their interests.\n\nCPB and PBS resolve a dispute over interconnection and program decision-making with the Partnership Agreement, which allows PBS to manage program feeds and requires CPB to consult with PBS on programs it proposes to fund.\n\nWith Texas businessman Ralph Rogers as chair, PBS reorganizes its governance by adding a board of lay leaders — prominent citizens usually involved with their local stations — to balance the oversight of a station manager board. The change solidifies PBS leadership as it cuts parental ties with CPB.\n\nA Prairie Home Companion debuts at the Janet Wallace Auditorium at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. Hosted by Garrison Keillor, the show charges $1 admission, 50 cents for kids. “There were about 12 people in the audience,” according to the show’s website.\n\nKERA in Dallas begins airing a discontinued British comedy series, Monty Python’s Flying Circus. WNET soon follows, and in October 10 additional stations license the offbeat show from distributor EEN.\n\nNPR expands All Things Considered to the weekend with Mike Waters as host.\n\nPBS launches the first national pledge drive, Festival 75.\n\nTerry Gross becomes host of Fresh Air, a talk show airing on WHYY-FM in Philadelphia.\n\nThe National Federation of Community Broadcasters incorporates.\n\nWNET starts The Robert MacNeil Report, in 1976 renamed The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.\n\nPresident Ford signs a five-year funding act anticipating a new feature: advance appropriations. In 1976, Congress follows up with appropriations through fiscal 1979.\n\nThe Native American Public Broadcasting Consortium is formed to support Native programming for public broadcasting, making it the first of the system’s five minority consortia to incorporate. In 1995 it changes its name to Native American Public Telecommunications; in 2013, it becomes Vision Maker Media.\n\nNPR takes on public radio’s lobbying functions, merging with APRS.\n\nFrank Mankiewicz begins work as NPR president.
