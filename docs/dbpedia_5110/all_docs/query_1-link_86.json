        "text": "Even though the Musee de Radio France closed its doors within the Maison de Radio, the building can still be visited where different concerts are held, and temporary exhibitions are also organised at various museums in Paris at present.\n\nAbout the Maison de Radio and Museum\n\nThe Maison de Radio France building was designed by the architect Henry Bernard, in a cylindrical shape that has a circumference of 500 metres and a tower, which is approximately 68 metres high.\n\nAlso being one of the more modern buildings in the city utilising architectural elements of glass and aluminium, it is now recognised as one of the monuments in Paris even though it was only inaugurated on 14th December 1963.\n\nThe Musee de Radio France was also set up within the building in 1966 and provided a unique collection that spanned from 1898 through to the age of television, and when it first opened to the public there were approximately 450 different items.\n\nAnd over the years, the museum collection has grown substantially, with over 2500 items catalogued, and the Musee de Radio France has in its inventory technical documentation, numerous different devices for broadcasting, a driver radio developed by Edouard Branly in 1890, early radios, speakers, microphones, studio equipment, along with signed advertising posters and much more.\n\nBut unfortunately, in 2007, when the Maison de Radio France set out on a major renovation plan of the building, regrettably it was at this time that the Muse de Radio France had to also close its doors to the public. And although plans were put in place for the radio museum to reopen its doors in 2012, according to the official website this has not happened so far.\n\nYet the Musee de Radio France has organised temporary exhibitions in other museums in Paris, such as one at the Musee des Arts et Metiers, so there are still opportunities that arise to discover parts of the unique collection.\n\nHowever, there is some other good news, as the Maison de Radio France also organise concerts including Jazz along with the philharmonic orchestra called the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, although there is a charge for these which does vary, and they do have to be booked in advance.\n\nVisiting the Musee de Radio France and the Maison de Radio France in Paris\n\nThe Maison de Radio France is located in the 16th Arrondissement close to the River Seine and the Pont de Grenelle Bridge, and if you are thinking of arriving by public transport in Paris, then the nearest RER train station is the Avenue de President Kennedy stop via line C."
