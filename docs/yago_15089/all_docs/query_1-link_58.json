        "text": "WARDER CLYDE ALLEE AWARD: BEST STUDENT PAPER\n\nThe Warder Clyde Allee Symposium for best student paper is always a highlight of the conference as it features outstanding graduate student research, with an award for the best paper and talk. The session honors Dr. Warder Clyde Allee (1885â1955) who was very influential in the development and direction of animal behavior research in the 20th century. Dr. Allee earned his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1912, was a faculty member at the University of Illinois, University of Oklahoma, University of Chicago, and University of Florida. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1951 and ranks among the leading twentieth century ecologists.\n\nIn the 2019 ABS Allee Session, 15 finalists were selected to present their research based on the quality of their papers. Any independent graduate student research is eligible, but the students must have had the principal responsibility for the conceptualization and design of the research, the collection and analysis of the data, and the interpretation of the results. These presenters also cannot have completed their defense of the doctoral dissertation before the preceding ABS annual meeting.\n\nThis year, J. Colton Watts (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) was co-awardee for their talk and paper entitled âMate Sampling Behavior Determines the Density-Dependence of Sexual Selectionâ. Additionally, Natalie S. Roberts (University of Maryland Baltimore County) was co-awardee for their talk and paper entitled âThe evolution and significance of male mate choice in behavioral isolationâ.\n\nRunner-up was awarded to Rickesh N. Patel (University of Maryland Baltimore County) for their talk and paper entitled âMantis shrimp navigate home using path integration\".\n\nABS FILM FESTIVAL AWARD\n\nNow in its 38th year, the ABS film festival featured top films that were produced in the preceding five years that portray important concepts in animal behavior research and education. Categories included both amateur (non-commercial) and professional (commercial) films. This year the film committee chair (Barbara Clucas and) received 3 film submissions that were ranked based on their accuracy, quality of narration, quality of videography, degree of anthropomorphism, and overall appeal. They narrowed the field down to one commercial film and one non-commercial film. Based on results compiled from an online survey, and input from all audience members the Film Committee was happy to announce that the ABS Jack Ward Film of the Year in the Non-Commercial category was âWings & Wetlands â A Story of Migrationâ directed by Raghunath Belur & Sugandhi Gadadhar. The ABS Film of the Year in the Commercial category was âMt. Suswa â Life in a Volcanoâ directed by Oliver Goetzl.\n\nTURNER AWARDS\n\nIn 2002, the Animal Behavior Society created the Charles H. Turner Program for undergraduate participation at the annual society meetings. Charles Turner was the first known African American researcher in animal behavior. He earned his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1907. Among other things, his research showed that insects can hear and exhibit trial-and-error learning. By naming the undergraduate program after him, the ABS Diversity Committee emphasizes its goal of increasing the diversity of its membership by encouraging researchers of all ages, levels and ethnic groups to participate in the annual meetings.\n\nThe ABS Diversity committee selected twelve Charles H. Turner Fellows to host this year, covering all expenses and providing a full program of events including a pre-meeting workshop and direct mentorship from junior and senior scientists. This yearâs deserving Turner award winners include: Chelsea Sinclair, Emily Miller Kristie Falconer, Tasia Slater, Ana Pemberton, Apsara Gurung , Blanca Ortega, Ebony Taylor, Lizbeth Jardon, Valeria Perez, Elena Gomez, and Cesar Estien.\n\nSpecial thanks goes to ABS Diversity Committee members: Program facilitators: Dr. Jen Hamel, Elon University Dr. Kasey Fowler-Finn, St. Louis University Dr. Carrie Hall, University of New Hampshire Facilitator and Sponsor: Dr. Damian Elias, Chair of the ABS Diversity Committee, University of California Berkeley The Diversity Committee of the Animal Behavior Society ”\n\nABS FILM FESTIVAL AWARDS\n\nNow in its 36th year, the ABS film festival featured top films that were produced in the preceding five years that portray important concepts in animal behavior research and education. Categories included both amateur (non-commercial) and professional (commercial) films. This year the film committee (Barbara Clucas, Cassandra Nunez, John Swaddle, Chris Templeton, and Michael Noonan) received 44 film submissions that were ranked based on their accuracy, quality of narration, quality of videography, degree of anthropomorphism, and overall appeal. They narrowed the field down to one commercial film and one non-commercial film.\n\nAfter careful deliberation, and input from all audience members the Film Committee was happy to announce that the ABS Jack Ward Film of the Year in the Non-Commercial category was âNow or Neverâ directed by Matt Senior. The ABS Film of the Year in the Commercial category was âPower of Playâ directed by Erin Oakes.\n\nANNOUNCING THE 2020 STUDENT RESEARCH GRANT AND DEVELOPING NATIONS RESEARCH AWARDS\n\nChris Templeton, 1st Member-at-Large\n\nChair, 2020 Student Research Grant Committee\n\nWe are pleased to announce the recipients of the 2020 Student Research Grants and the Developing Nations Research Awards. We received many high-quality proposals, but as in previous years, the number of applications exceeded the number we could fund. We received a total of 168 applications across award categories, and were able to award funding to 59 applicants.\n\nEach proposal was reviewed independently by at least 2 referees, who provided evaluations and constructive feedback for the student grant writers. As always, members of the Society went above and beyond to provide constructive reviews. The Research Grant Committee extends a very heartfelt thank you to the following (150!) volunteer referees:\n\nAbraham Miller, Amanda Melin, Amber Kincaid, Amy Bishop, AndrÃ¨ Guaraldo, Andrea Bierema, Andrea Grunst, Andrea Presotto, Anita Aisenberg, Ann Paterson, Anna Bastian, Anne Clark, Anne Jacobs, Arrilton Araujo, Barbara Clucas, Blair Costelloe, Boris Almonacid, Brent Stoffer, Bret Pasch, Bruce Cushing, Bryan Arnold, Caitlin Wells, Carley Faughn, Carolin Sommer-Trembo, Charles Gunnels, Charles Walcott, Chris clark, Clare Rittschof, Claudia Rauter , Cristina Romero Diaz, Damian Elias, Dan Charbonneau, Darren Minier, David Fisher, David Wilson, Debottam Bhattacharjee, Dhanashree Paranjpe, Diego Pereira Nogueira, Doris Audet, Eli Baskir, Eliane de GonÃalves, Elizabeth Hobson, Emilie Snell-Rood, Emily DuVal, Enrique Font, Eric Walters, Erica Westerman, Gabriella Gall, Ginny Greenway, Hangkyo Lim, Heather Auld, Ivana Schoepf, Jaime Grace, James Hare, Jan Murie, Jane Waterman, Janice Enos, Jason Keagy, Jason Watters, Jay Mager,, Jean-Nicolas Audet, Jennifer Essler, Jennifer Gleason, Jennifer Hellmann, Jennifer Mather, Jennifer Stynoski, Jessica Cusick, Jianqiang Li, Jill Goldman, Jimena Aracena, Joao Menezes, Jodee Hunt, Joel Slade, Joseph Leese, Julie Miller, Kacharat Phromkhunathon, Katherine Houpt, Kathleen Church, Katie LaBarbera, Kelly Kissane, Ken Yasukawa ,Kenneth Chapin, Kevin McGraw, Lauren Guillette, Leonie Baier, Leslie Curren, Lilian Manica, Luis Robledo, Luiz Henrique Santana, Luiz Varzinczak, Lynne Beaty, Malini Suchak, Maria Abate, Maria Albo, Maria Florencia Scaia, Mariana de Carvalho, Mariana Pueta, Marie Claire Chelini,Melissa Shyan-Norwalt, Michael Cramer, Michael Reichert, Michael Sheehan, Molly Morris, Natalia Albuquerque, Natalie Freret Meurer, Natalie van Breukelen, Nobuaki Mizumoto, Nora Carlson, Nora Prior, Paul Nealen, Peter Bednekoff, Pierre-Paul Bitton, Rachel Chock, Ratna Ghosal, Rebecca Adrian, Rebecca Fox, Robert Dale, Robert Hegna, Robert Srygley, Sarah Fauque, Sarah King, Sayantan Das, Sean Walker, Shala Hankison, Shannon Digweed, Sheryl Walker, Stacey Weiss, Stacy Goodman, Stephen Ferguson, Stephen Nowicki, Stuart Leonard, Sue Margulis, Susan Jenks, Susan Parks, Tamra Mendelson, Tasmin Rymer, Theresa Rueger, Todd Freeberg, Tom Contreras, Trevor Price, Trish Schwagmeyer, Trish Sevene, Ummat Somjee, Vicki Fishlock, Vinicius Caldart, Wendi Wolfram, Wendy King, William Searcy, Ylenia Chiari, Yvonnick Le Pendu, Zachary Shaffer.\n\nWe were helped immensely by Lorena McMahon and Adam Kohm at SPLTrak, who administered the online grant submission and review system, which ran smoothly.
