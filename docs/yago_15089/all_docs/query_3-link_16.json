        "text": "BEAVER or BEAVERS - BROWN Family photograph\n\nI’ve recovered an old photograph identified as Sam, Rheak, and Vergie BEAVER or BEAVERS. The photograph appears to have been taken some time between 1907 and 1917 and given to Miss Finnie PARDON or LARDON who is a cousin to those in the photograph. The baby in the photograph appears to be about one year old and the parents likely in their teens or 20’s at the time. Based on limited research I was able to locate the following information regarding this family: Samuel “Sam” Starling or Sterlin BEAVER or BEAVERS was b. Oct 1890 in Georgia to parents John Anderson BEAVERS (1859-1934) and Mary Amanda “Mandie” or “Manda” Melissa HASSLER (1873-1939). Sam was one of 18 children born to this couple including William Dane or David; Samuel S.; Jonathan “John” Morgan; Tom “Tommy” Anderson; Jimmy “Jim” Jothan, Jonathan, or Jathan; Mary; Lillie May or Mae; Joe Henry; Charlie Fulmer or Austin; Eli Owen; Mattie Ree; Annie Lee; Ben Farrington; Myrtle Amanda; Norman William; Corrie Oneda; Rudolf or Rodolf or Rudolph Monroe; Fred; and Woodrow W. BEAVER or BEAVERS, all born between 1889 and 1918. Sam & Rheak BEAVER or BEAVERS had 8 children including Virginia “Vergie” or “Virgie” Kennedy; Winnie B.; Opal L.; Enna: Vick S.; Samuel S. Jr.; Kenneth Hassler BEAVER or BEAVERS and one other boy, all born between 1912 and 1927. Sam died 20 Jun 1953 in Boone Co., WV and is buried in Madison, WV. Uereka or Ureca or Ureka or Ulreca “Rheak” SWANSON was b. 5 Aug 1894 in Murray Co., GA to parents Ballous “Bailey” McGensg or McGeng SWANSON (1857-1933) and Maggie May MOORE (1867-1920). Rheak was one of 6 children born to this couple including Rheak; Pearl Mae; William “Willie” or “Will” Edgar; Millie; Ralph or Routh McKinley; and James “Jim” Joseph SWANSON, all born between 1894 and 1906. Rheak died 31 Mar 1943 in Georgia and is buried in the Cool Springs Baptist Church Cemetery in Murray County, GA. Virginia “Vergie” Kennedy BEAVER was b. 7 Sept 1912 in Georgia and married William Paul “Barney” BROWN (1910-1972) on 19 Feb 1928 and they had a daughter. Vergie died 26 Aug 2005 and is buried in the Clearfield Cemetery in Clearfield, KY. I am hoping to locate someone from this family so that the photograph can be returned to their care. If you are a member of this family or know someone who might be, please contact me. Thanks, Shelley\n\nStarted by Shelley Cardiel @\n\nWARDER Family Photographs\n\nI've \"rescued\" two photographs belonging to the WARDER Family. The first is one of Willell \"Willi\" WARDER which was taken at the T. J. Stevens Studio in Maysville, KY. The photograph was taken in the 1860's with Willi appearing to be in her teens at the time the photograph was taken. A note on the back also says \"This was taken four years ago.\" The second photograph is of Isabel WARDER which was taken at the J. G. Mangold Studio in Du Quoin, IL. Isabel appears to be in her teens or 20's at the time it was taken. Based on limited research I was able to locate the following information regarding this information: Willella “Willie” H. WARDER was b. 4 Aug 1850 in Maysville, KY to parents William Henry WARDER (1821-1894) and Cordelia or Cordella Green ARTUS (1822-1854). Willella was one of four children born to this couple including, Walter James; Harriet Mary “Hattie”; Willella; and Cordelia or Cordella “Corrie” W. WARDER all born between 1847 and 1853. After his wife died William remarried and had 5 additional children including, William Henry; Byrd; June; Amy; and Fred Norcum WARDER, all born between 1857 and 1878. Willella married Ormond Griffith SEXTON (1848-1925) and they had two children, Cordelia “Corrie” (b. 1880) and Ormond Griffith Jr. (b. 1888). Willella died 18 Mar 1939 in Tampa, FL. Isabella “Belle” WARDER was b. 10 Oct 1848 in Flemingsburg, KY to parents Joseph WARDER (1810-1887) and Anne Thomas KIRKHAM (1822-1890). Isabella was one of 12 children born to this couple including, Mary Elizabeth; Virginia S.; Isabella; Walter; Corrie; William H.; Anne “Annie” Gertrude; Jude; Byrd “Birdie”; Amy; Frederick Morcom; and Walter Joseph WARDER, all born between 1844 and 1879. Isabella married William Hershel BUNDY (1846-1938) and they had three children, Marian “Mamie” or “Mayme” BUNDY (1873-1961); Benjamin Thomas BUNDY (1877-1953) and Elizabeth “Lizzie” T. BUNDY (b. 1878). Isabella died 29 Jun 1883 in Carbondale, IL. I am hoping to return the photographs to family and would appreciate you contacting me if you are a member of this family, or you know someone who might be. Thanks, Shelley\n\nStarted by Shelley Cardiel @\n\nMORRIS - WARDER - FARR Family Photograph\n\nI've \"rescued\" an old photograph of Maria MORRIS FARR which was taken at the Charles K. Bills Studio in New York City, NY. The photograph appears to have been taken in the 1860's or 1870's with Maria likely in her 20's at the time it was taken. It appears that the photograph was given to E. ALWARD. Based on limited research I was able to gather the following information regarding Maria and her family: Maria Warder MORRIS was born 1 Jul 1845 in Liberty, MO to parents John MORRIS (1809-1873) and Emily WARDER (1811-1857) who were married about 1832 in Mason County, KY. Maria was one of 12 children born to this couple including, John H.; Emily M.; Mary W. or Elizabeth or Jane; David; William Winslow; William Warder; Louisa; Harriet “Hattie” Russel; Maria Warder; George Washington; Benjamin Franklin; and James K MORRIS, all born between 1832 and 1847. Maria married Watson or Walter Barnes FARR (1836-1900) on 26 Feb 1866 in Lafayette, MO and together they had a daughter, May FARR (b. 1873) and Maria died in 1914 and is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, MO. Her sister Mary W. MORRIS (1835-1879) married Ephraim ALWARD (1830-1910) on 16 Aug 1855 in Clay County, MO so I believe that this photograph was gifted to Ephraim ALWARD. I am hoping to locate someone from Maria’s family so that this wonderful old treasure can be returned to the care of her family.

One of my gggg-grandfathers was a fellow named Austin Bohannon (ca. 1768-1850/60). According the 1850 Census for Kenton County, KY he was born in VA. The earliest record I've been able to find of him in Kentucky is April 16, 1796 in Franklin County, KY when he served as the bondsman to the marriage of Anna Hawkins to Edmond/Edmund Scanland. Anna was the daughter of William Hawkins and his first wife, Mary. Her father's second wife, whom he married on July 28, 1785 in Culpeper County, VA was a woman named Ann Bohannon Smith. I'm not sure if there's a family relationship between Austin Bohannon and Mrs. Ann Bohannon Smith Hawkins or not, but it is something I am trying to discover. The second record I can find for Austin is from April 2, 1799 when he married Mrs. Elizabeth Jackson in Franklin County, KY, with Robert White serving as bondsman. As far as I can determine, this was at the very least his second marriage, and it is not clear which if any of his known children might be the daughters of Mrs. Elizabeth Jackson. Austin Bohannon's know children were: 1. Mary \"Polly\" Bohannon m. (July 22, 1813) Abraham Louderback [I've placed her as the oldest due to her marriage date.] 2. Mildred Ann \"Milly\" Bohannon (1793-1861) m. (July 17, 1817, Franklin Co., KY) Robert Knox (my ggg-grandparents) 3. Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Bohannon (1795-1879) m. John R. Crockett 4. Martha \"Patsy\" Bohannon (b. ca. 1796) m. (July 21, 1824, Franklin Co., KY) Dr. Alexander Moss 5. Sarah \"Sally\" Bohannon m. (Nov. 25, 1825, Franklin Co., KY) Richard Berry Austin Bohannon shows up in the Franklin County, KY Census in 1810, 1820, and 1830, but I have not been able to locate him the 1840 Census. His last appearance in the census is in 1850 when he is living with his widowed daughter Elizabeth Bohannon Crockett, in Covington, Kenton County, KY. There is however, a record of an Austin and Elizabeth Bohannon in the Franklin County, Kentucky Appraisement and Inventory Index, indicating that a settlement for Austin Bohannon was recorded in September 1809 on page 174 of Book 1: 1795-1823, and a settlement for Elizabeth Bohannon (widow) on Sept. 17, 1809 on page 177 of the same book. I'm not sure what to make of this... The other Bohannons that I can find in Franklin County, KY in the same period are Richard Bohannon (who show up in a marriage record in 1797) and Larkin Bohannon who shows up in another marriage record in 1802. There is also a record in 1810 when Austin Bohannon was the admistrator of the will of James Tracy, which was entered for probate on February 19, 1810. It appers that James Tracy, was the son of Samuel Tracy and his wife Nancy Ann (who may have been the daughter of an Ann White) who were all of Culpeper County, VA. I know there isn't a lot to work with here, but any help will be much appreciated. Thanks. Jeff Duvall ​Jeffery A.

Joseph was the son of Abraham Lewis (1751-1813) and Esther Todd (1750-1821). I do not know who Margaret’s parents were. There are a few family trees that show her father as Peter Hart, but I have not seen any proof of this. Joseph and Margaret were married on 06 Sept 1798 in Madison County, Kentucky. Joseph and Margaret had 11 children: Mary, Abraham, Esther, Elizabeth, Susanna, Jonathan, Tasy, John, William, Joseph and Margaret. They stayed in the Madison County area until sometime between 1810 & 1813 when they moved to Wayne County, Indiana (Tasy b. 1810 in Madison KY, John b. 1813 in Wayne IN). I am a descendant of their son Jonathan Lewis and Celinda Cobb. What I am searching for in Madison County, KY is information on Margaret Hart’s family. Some documents state that Margaret Hart was born in Madison County KY in 1781 but I believe this was still Lincoln or Fayette County Virginia and prior to this area becoming Kentucky. There is a lot of information in Madison County about Hart families, but none reference a Margaret Hart. These families were in the Fort Boonesborough area along with Abraham Lewis and his family. I am hoping to find more information on the Hart family from Madison County. Margaret’s husband Joseph died in Crawford County IL in 1820, soon after they arrived there from moving from Wayne County Indiana, and there are no records other than Joseph’s probate records that give any indication as to what happened to Margaret after that. Thanks for any information you may have…\n\nStarted by Byron Lewis @\n\nLewis: Warren, Simpson, maybe Barren Counties KY\n\nI am a 3rd Gr-Grandson of Isaiah Lewis (1769-1837) and Nancy Julian (1770-1845). Isaiah was the son of David Lewis (1747-1822) and Ann Beason (1749-1812) and one of three Lewis brothers (Isaiah, Joab & Neriah) that moved their families from the Carolina’s in the 1790’s to Warren County Kentucky and settled in an area that is now Franklin in Simpson County. In 1816 Isaiah and Nancy moved their family north to Edwards (now Lawrence) County in Illinois and later in 1821 to Vigo County, Indiana where he lived until he died in 1836. Nancy stayed in Vigo County until 1844 when she moved back to Lawrence County IL and she died there in 1845. According to a biography of Neriah and his wife Mary Moss they stayed in Simpson County until later in life and then moved to Macoupin County, Illinois. It appears that all of their children had also moved to this area of Illinois and five of their sons had joined the LDS Church and 4 of them later moved out to Utah and the greater north west area. Joab and his wife Katherine Leonard stayed in Simpson County and probably died in the 1830’s. Isaiah and Nancy had 11 children: Rebecca, David, Peter, Ann, twins Philip & Paul, Jacob, John, William, Isaiah Jr. and Mary. I am a descendant of their son Isaiah Jr and Mary “Polly” Smith who were married in Vigo County, Indiana on 13 March 1828 and had 7 children: Joab, Arlander, Marion, Sarah, Dennis, John & William. Isaiah Jr died in Vigo County, Indiana on 27 March 1856 and his wife Mary died sometime in 1874, place unknown (year comes from the “History of George Smith” written in 1946 by Marion W. Smith. George Smith was Mary’s father.) In Simpson County KY I am interested in information on Joab and Katherine (Moss) Lewis and their descendants. I only know of 3 children: Alice, Leonard and Isaiah. Alice and Leonard stayed in the Simpson County area and Isaiah moved to Tennessee and then to Arkansas. I don’t have any information on any other children. In Barron County KY I am looking for information on the 2nd wife of David Lewis, Penelope (last name unknown). There is very little information about her or the two children they had, David b. 1814 and Rosannah b. 1815. David & Penelope were married in Anderson County SC and both children were born there. David died in 1822 and there is no information as to what happened to Penelope, David or Rosannah after that. On a recent trip to Simpson County Genealogy I ran across a paper that suggested that Penelope had moved to the Simpson County area where 3 of the sons of David and his 1st wife Ann had moved (Isaiah, Joab & Neriah). This paper suggested that Penelope had remarried and was living in Barren County KY and that her children David & Rosannah were there also. Cannot find any information about them in Kentucky. I am hoping that I can find more information on the Lewis families of Simpson County and possibly fill in some of the missing information that I have. Thanks for any info that you can share.\n\nStarted by Byron Lewis @\n\nDillons in Kentucky 1825-1840\n\nInterested in any Dillons in Kentucky during period 1825-1840. Especially looking for William Dillon (1805-1843) and his wife Elizabeth T. Nunn (1801-1861). Also interested in their children, some of whom were born in Kenhtucky. Those names would be Milton Crittenden Dillon (1828-1900), Reuben Miller Dillon (1832-1899), Andrew Jackson Dillon (1834-1864), Rebecca Jane Dillon (1836-after 1880), Thomas Dillon (1838-after 1850) and Dorothy Dillon (1838-1915). Thank you\n\nStarted by Bill Dillon @\n\nLooking For Charles Rice 5\n\nI am looking for Charles Rice who died in 1809 in Madison County, Kentucky. I know a lot about his family and can trace my lineage to him, but I can’t get back beyond him. Where did he come from? How did did he get there? Not from the Deacon Rice line as posted some places because the DNA doesn’t support that. I can provide more details if it would help. Thanks for any help.
