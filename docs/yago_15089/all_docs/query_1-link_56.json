        "text": "National Historic Trail\n\nButterfield Overland\n\nMO, AR, OK, TX, NM, AZ, CA\n\nIn 1857, businessman and transportation entrepreneur John Butterfield was awarded a contract to establish an overland mail route between the eastern United States and growing populations in the Far West. What became known as the Butterfield Overland Trail made an arcing sweep across the southern rim of the country. Stagecoaches left twice a week carrying passengers, freight, and mail.\n\nNational Historic Trail\n\nCalifornia\n\nVarious States CA,CO,ID,KS,MO,NE,NV,OR,UT,WY\n\nFollow in the footsteps of over 250,000 emigrants who traveled to the gold fields and rich farmlands of California during the 1840s and 1850s: the greatest mass migration in American history. The California National Historic Trail is over 5,000 miles long and covers portions of 10 states. Step into history along more than 1,000 miles of ruts and traces from travelers and their overland wagons.\n\nNational Park\n\nGateway Arch\n\nSt. Louis, MO\n\nGateway Arch National Park commemorates President Jefferson’s vision of a continental nation, the individuals and cultural groups who helped shape its history, St. Louis’ role in westward expansion, and Dred and Harriet Scott, who sued for their freedom in the Old Courthouse.\n\nNational Monument\n\nGeorge Washington Carver\n\nDiamond, MO\n\nThe young child known as the \"Plant Doctor\" tended his secret garden while observing the day-to-day operations of a 19th century farm. Nature and nurture ultimately influenced George on his quest for education to becoming a renowned agricultural scientist, educator, and humanitarian.\n\nNational Historic Site\n\nHarry S Truman\n\nIndependence and Grandview, MO\n\nPresident Harry S Truman took America from its traditional isolationism into the age of international involvement. Despite his power, he never forgot where he came from. Today, visitors can experience the surroundings Truman knew as a young man of modest ambition through his political career and final years as a former president.\n\nNational Historic Trail\n\nLewis & Clark\n\nSixteen States: IA,ID,IL,IN,KS,KY,MO,MT,NE,ND,OH,OR,PA,SD,WA,WV\n\nThe Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail winds nearly 4,900 miles through the homelands of more than 60 Tribal nations. It follows the historic outbound and inbound routes of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1803-1806 from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the Pacific Ocean. Follow the trail to find the people, places, and stories that make up the complex legacy of the expedition.\n\nNational Historic Trail\n\nOregon\n\nVarious States ID,KS,MO,NE,OR,WA,WY\n\nImagine yourself an emigrant headed for Oregon: would promises of lush farmlands and a new beginning lure you to leave home and walk for weeks? More than 2,000 miles of trail ruts and traces can still be seen along the Oregon National Historic Trail in six states and serve as reminders of the sacrifices, struggles, and triumphs of early American settlers.\n\nNational Scenic Riverways\n\nOzark\n\nVan Buren,Eminence,Salem,Winona, MO\n\nOzark National Scenic Riverways is the first national park area to protect a river system. The Current and Jacks Fork rivers are two of the finest floating rivers found anywhere. Spring-fed, cold and clear: they are a delight to canoe, swim, boat, or fish. Besides these two famous rivers, the park is home to hundreds of freshwater springs, caves, trails, and historic sites such as Alley Mill.\n\nNational Historic Trail\n\nPony Express\n\nVarious States CA,CO,KS,MO,NE,NV,UT,WY\n\nIt is hard to believe that young men once rode horses to carry mail from Missouri to California in the unprecedented time of only 10 days. This relay system along the Pony Express National Historic Trail in eight states was the most direct and practical means of east-west communications before the telegraph.\n\nNational Historic Trail\n\nSanta Fe\n\nCO,KS,MO,NM,OK\n\nYou can almost hear the whoops and cries of \"All's set!\" as trail hands hitched their oxen to freight wagons carrying cargo between western Missouri and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Follow the Santa Fe National Historic Trail through five states and you'll find adventure and evidence of past travelers who made this remarkable trip before you!\n\nNational Historical Park\n\nSte. Geneviève\n\nMO\n\nEstablished by 1750, Ste. Geneviève was the first permanent European settlement in Missouri.

Grant is known as the victorious Civil War general who saved the Union and the 18th President of the United States. He first met Julia Dent, his future wife, at her family home, named White Haven. From 1854 to 1859 the Dents, Grants and an enslaved African-American workforce lived on the property.\n\nNational Battlefield\n\nWilson's Creek\n\nRepublic, MO\n\nWilson's Creek was the first major Civil War battle fought west of the Mississippi River, and the site of the death of Nathaniel Lyon, the first Union general killed in action. The costly Southern victory on August 10, 1861, focused national attention on the war in Missouri. Wilson’s Creek NB commemorates and interprets the battle within the context of the war in the Trans-Mississippi West."
