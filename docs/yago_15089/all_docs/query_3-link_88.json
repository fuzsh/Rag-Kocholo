        "text": "Were this the 16th century, this unwor‘thy epistle might be dedicated to that noble and virtuous patron of the arts, the editor, who might then bloom forth with a pittance of. alms, a pension of substance, or a barrel of port, or, if displeased, could have the author condemned to penitential labor or cry, “Off with his headline!”\n\nIn “Patrons and Publishers: The Economics of English Literature,” the new show at the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42d Street, the trials of past authors are linked to quests for patronage and eventually to the profits of present‐day publishers. Lola L. Szladits, curator of the Berg, sums up the course of five centuries as the shift “from royalty to royalties,” and she displays examples from the Houses of York, Tudor and Stuart, as well as the houses of modern publishers.\n\nEven in the Middle Ages, writers did not live by faith alone; to keep body and soul together they required patronage of the landed and wealthy. Patrons simultaneoulsy fulfilled their own obligations to the arts of charity and discerment.\n\nIndignities of Their Calling\n\nBut few were the authors who rose hevond genteel poverty to a life of ease, Even Chaucer, beneficiary of royal pen‐1 sions and a yearly cask of wine, hinted of his poverty in a “Complaint to His Empty Purse,” and the Berg exhibits a 1532 copy of the poem in the poet's collected works.\n\nWith the introduction of printing, authors remained subject to the indignities of their calling, hymning dismal graces\n\nand striking off poems to commemorate royal births, mourn royal deaths, and lament royal amnesia. When Queen Elzabeth l's promise of £100 for some poems went unfilled, Edmund Spens:r produced mother verse:\n\nI was promised on a time\n\nTo have reason for my Mime.\n\nFrom that time unto this season, I received nor Mime, nor reason.\n\nThe reining style of dedication was lattery—eyes shielded from the bright sun of royal splendor, knees bent in obsequious obeisance before the majesty of office, ‘Ali that is hers is pure, cleere, holie,” Edward Fairfax writes of his monarch in the 17th century. “Olive of peace, Angell of pleasure, What. line of praise can your worth measure?”\n\nBecause patronage was the privilege of nobility as well as of royalty, fulsomeness was appropriate there as well. “To the Right Honorable my best‐best Benefactors,” John Florio wrote, “and mostmost honored Ladies, Lucie Countess of Bedford; and hir best‐most loved‐loving Mother, Ladie Anne Harrington.”\n\nWith superlative abandon, authors multiplied dedications—sometimes page after page of those deemed worthy of flattery, since susceptible of largesse. George Chapman's transatlion of the Iliad was dedicated to Prince Henry, bore a sonnet to Queen Anne, and concluded with 18 additional sonents to miscellaneous nobility.\n\nMerit Not to Starve\n\nHad Lord Sunderland interceded for him, Dryden asked the Earl of Rochester, noting that he had “two other advocates, my extreme wants ... and my ill health ... I only thinke I merit not to starve ... I have three sons growing to man's estate Be pleased to looke on me with an eye of compassion: some small employment would render my condition easy.”\n\nDryden's prayer was answered, and he was named a collector of customs.\n\nSamuel Butler's work was so admired by Charles II that butler was given E300 outright and an annual pension of £100. In the end he was neglected and povertystricken, his fatal misfortunes enshrined in an inscription in Westminter Abbey: “The Poets Fate is here in emblem shown: he asked for Bread and received a Stone.”\n\nOnly blockheads write except for pay, Samuel Johnson warned, and in “The Vanity of Human Wishes” he lamented:\n\n“There mark what ills the scholar's life assail, Toil, envy, want, the patron and the gaol.”\n\n“For we that live to please, must please to live,” he noted. But when Lord Chesterfield failed to offer timely help, Dr. Johnson asked: “Is not a patron, my lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help?”\n\nFrom patronage guided by noble whim evolved a publishing industry bound by profitable expectations, as literature went from court to market, from art to article, from pleas for favor to bargaining over contracts. Heroic pioneers such as Dickens and Shaw learned the tricks of the traders and insisted on their rights, and the Berg documents the new style, as when it displays an imperious telegram from Kipling: “MARTINDELLS PROPOSALS IMPOSSIBLE MY TERMS MUST BE ACCEPTED BEFORE CHRISTMAS THIS FINAL NO MORE DELAYS.”\n\nThough publishers now rule, patrons survive in foundations such as the Guggenheim and Ford and Rockefeller. And who would make light of the benevolence available from such a latter‐day patron as Joseph E. Duffey, head of the National Endowment for the Humanities. With a nod, he can assure prosperity to one author's enterprise, with a shrug condemn another's to poverty and indifference.\n\nQueens and Bees\n\nIt would he understandable if auto ors took to dedicating their scholarly works to this keeper of the hive, just as it ‘as the custom in’ Britain to dedicate hooks about bees to queens.\n\nIn 1634, Charles Butler dedicated “The Feminin’ Monarchie, or the Historl of Bee's” to Queen Henrietta Maria; in 1713, Joseph Warder dedicated “The True Amazons, or the Monarchy of Bees” to Queen Anne; Thomas Wildman dedicated his “Treatise on the Management of Bees” to Queen Charlotte, and Edward Bevan honored Queen Victoria with “The Honey Bee.”\n\nAll this was reported 14 years ago in The Times of London, and whatever munificent fee the diligent author may have received in pounds sterling she did not get the pleasure of seeing her name in print: Her identity was concealed within the phrase “From a correspondent.”\n\n$360 for the Drone\n\nBut there is another sting in this tale. When a British publisher was preparing a book celebrating the Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, he chose this same correspondent, an authority on queens and queen bees to write the text. This she did, and her name—Olwen Hedley—was listed as author when “The Queen's Silver Jubilee” appeared.\n\nThe illustrated volume became the nation's best‐seller—two million copies. As the Berg notes, this was small comfort to the drone. For writing the text, her sweet recompense was $360,"
