        "text": "Friends of the Library News\n\nVOL. 4, Nos. 1 AND 2 * WINTER-SPRING 1947\n\nThe Ray Stannard Baker Collection of Bee Books Comes to Michigan State College\n\nOfficers of Friends of the Michigan State College Library\n\n*The Secretary and Joseph G. Duncan, Department of Public Relations, serve as editors of the News.\n\nThe Baker Bee Collection\n\nThis fine gift of apicultural rarities, so rich in associational value because of the great literary distinction of the original collector, came to the Michigan State College Library through the kind assistance of Mr. Ray Baker's son, Mr. James Baker of Detroit, last July. The books had been in process of being packed for shipment to us at the time of Mr. Ray Baker's death. As noted in the last number of our News, Mr. Ray Baker served as a Council Member of our group from the founding period until the expiration of his term, in June 1945.\n\nIt was originally Ray Stannard Baker's intention to write a pamphlet to accompany his remarkable collection \"of old books about bees.\" But the pressure of many other duties kept him from this during the last months of his life.\n\nWe have re-arranged the original list as sent us by Mr. James Baker from alphabetical to chronological, have collated the entries with the actual title pages of the volumes, making a minimum number of changes and in a number of instances have provided annotations for the items by quoting directly from the chapter on \"My Bees\", and from the two subsequent chapters, in Under My Elm, which is one of the \"Adventures in Contentment\" Mr. Baker published under the pseudonym of \"David Grayson\". We trust that the resulting bibliography may serve as a partially acceptable substitute for the pamphlet Mr. Baker had contemplated writing.\n\nIn the previous number of our News the many books by Mr. Baker were enumerated in our biographical summary.\n\nThe bee books were first exhibited in the glass cases in the main hallway in the College Library in October, 1946.\n\nJ.

Hyll \"gathered and Englished\" from the ancient classics, using without acknowledgment, as Charles Butler pointed out, \"the labour of Georgius Pictorius.\")\n\n\"I was able to get a copy of the earliest, and probably the most precious English book on beekeeping. To this day I recall the thrill I had when the dealer took it from his fireproof vault, held it a moment in his hand, then passed it to me. . . It was a small volume, printed in black letter, in the year 1568. It was bound in old calf with a gilt ornamental border. There were bookworm holes through a few of the pages, and the names of various owners down through the centuries written in unsuspected places, imperfections which possibly reduced its money value, but added to my interest. I delighted in the frontispiece, a woodcut portrait of the author. . . with his thin beard and Elizabethan cap and rolling collar. The book was at once a treasure and a temptation; and I fell!\"\n\nHeresbachius, M. Conradus\n\n1601\n\nFOURE BOOKES OF HUSBANDRY. . .

London, 1601.\n\n\"In less than no time Mr. Cowan had in his hand a most beautiful copy of Herebachius' Foure Bookes of Husbandry.It was `Newly Englished, and encreafed by Barnaby Googe, Esquire' and published in London in 1601. It had the original sheepskin parchment binding with rawhide clasps.

Oxford, 1634.\n\n\"This Charles Butler, for his time, was a thorough-going scholar. He had 'read' at Oxford and settled down to a poor vicarage near Basingstoke, where he served the people of his neighborhood, and kept bees and wrote books, for forty-eight years. I like to think of him there in his garden, a poor man in worldly goods, but rich in the delights of a lively mind, and inspired by a passion to know. He was irritated, as some of us are to this day, by the 'capriciousness of English orthography' and made the highly sensible proposal that 'men should write altogether according to the sound now generally received.' He became such an enthusiast that he translated his own book on the honeybee into his strange new spelling. I have a copy of it (printed at Oxford in 1634) which is extremely difficult to read.\"\n\nWorlidge, J.\n\n1691\n\nSYSTEMA AGRICULTURAE; The Mystery of Husbandry Discovered.

Being again in England, I went to call on the best-known beemaster and bee authority in all the kingdom. I had had some previous correspondence with him and had long wished to meet him face to face.\n\nHis name was Thomas William Cowan, and he lived in Bristol. He had been, at one time, president of the British Beekeepers' Association, and had written a number of excellent manuals and guidebooks on beekeeping. What interested me most of all that summer morning, when I entered his home, were the book-lined walls of his library. I believe he had at that time, one of the largest independent collections of books on bees and beekeeping in the world. . . He must have had thousands of books and pamphlets and journals - including many in French, Dutch, German, Latin. . .\"\n\nLovell, John H.\n\n1926\n\nHONEY PLANTS OF NORTH AMERICA.

( 141 pp.)\n\nMr. Baker's collection included some unbound numbers of certain bee journals, such as The American Apiculturist, The Bee Hive, The Bee-Keepers Review, The British Bee Journal, and The Progessive Bee-Keeper, ranging in dates from 1887 to 1937.\n\nAlso included are several bulletins of the U. S. Department of Agriculture on bee-keeping, dated from 1905 to 1925 ; and an interesting collection of marked rare book catalogues issued by such firms as Bernard Quaritch and Wheldon and Wesley, ranging from 1912 to 1936. There is an accompanying correspondence.\n\nThere are also \"some original notes\" of Mr. Ray Baker's bearing upon his actual bee-keeping experiences. These manuscript memoranda give dates of the swarming of the \"David Grayson\" bees, and include such whimsical notations as the following, on the card used for the year 1936: \"I was ill part of spring and summer, got little comb honey but good crop extracted honey.
