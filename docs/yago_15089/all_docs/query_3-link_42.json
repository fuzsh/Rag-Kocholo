Folsom State Prison also includes a Minimum Support Facility.\n\nHISTORY\n\nCalifornia’s second oldest prison, Folsom State Prison (FSP), primarily houses Medium Security General Population Level II and Level III male inmates. Additionally, Folsom houses Minimum Security Level I male inmates within a minimum security facility located just outside of the main security perimeter. Folsom offers Rehabilitative programs, to include academic courses and career technical education, which are provided through Folsom’s Greystone Adult School.\n\nThe California Legislature authorized the construction of Folsom State Prison in 1858. Twenty years later, in 1878, construction began on one of the nations first maximum-security prisons. On July 26, 1880, Folsom received its first 44 inmates. The inmates were transferred by boat from San Quentin State Prison to Sacramento and then by train from Sacramento to the prison.\n\nFolsom State Prison’s location was selected due to an unlimited amount of native granite stone for building the prison. Also, the American River offered ample water and formed a natural boundary. Inmate laborers built the first dam and canal on the American River, which led to the first hydroelectric power generation for the Sacramento area.\n\nOriginally designed to hold inmates serving long sentences, habitual criminals, and incorrigibles, Folsom State Prison quickly gained the reputation of being the end of the line. Prior to the completion of the granite wall in the 1920’s, the prison witnessed numerous escape attempts; the first one occurring shortly after the first inmates arrived in 1880. Throughout Folsom’s violent and bloody history, numerous riots and escape attempts have resulted in both inmate and staff deaths.\n\nThe Folsom Museum is located near the entrance of Folsom Prison. Run solely through the support of volunteers, the museum contains an abundance of documents and artifacts from throughout Folsom’s long and colorful history.\n\nUnder the administration of FSP, Folsom Women’s Facility (FWF) was activated in January 2013. This 523 bed stand-alone facility provides housing, rehabilitative and reentry programming, substance abuse treatment, and job training to the medium and minimum security female population. FWF is the northern most female facility in the State, allowing female offenders to maintain closer ties to family and relatives in the area.\n\nFolsom State Prison is California’s second-oldest prison, and one of the nation’s first maximum-security prisons built in the decades following the California Gold Rush.\n\nJoseph R. Tuggle has been acting Warden at Folsom State Prison since January 2024. Prior to this assignment, Mr. Tuggle accepted the assignment of Chief Deputy Warden at FOL, a position he had held since May 28, 2023. He also acted as the Chief Deputy Warden at the California Medical Facility from August 2022 to May 2023. Mr. Tuggle began his career in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in 1998, as a Correctional Officer at Pelican Bay State Prison in Cresent City, CA. from the timeframe of July 11, 1998, until his transfer to Folsom State Prison on June 12, 2000. he served in several positions at Folsom State Prison, including Correctional Sergeant, Correctional Lieutenant, Correctional Captain, and Associate Warden. Mr. Tuggle exemplifies excellence in areas of peer mentorship and constructive relationships between staff and the incarcerated population. Notably, his commitment to continuous education for incarcerated persons, and unwavering support for staff professional development, highlight his proactive and visionary approach to leadership."
