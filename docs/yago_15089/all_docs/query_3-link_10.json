Most, if not all of the Warders, in the United States, can trace their ancestry back to a very few of these pioneers from England. The name is not a com¬ mon one like the Wards or Wardens or other similar names. A careful examination of the di¬ rectories in the large cities will disclose but lim¬ ited numbers bearing the name of W’arder. How¬ ever, these early settlers have, in the course of four or five generations, left many descendants, the greater number of whom are residents of the states of Virginia and' Kentucky. It would re¬ quire the expenditure of far more time and labor than the writer has at his disposal to pre¬ pare a genealogy that would give the names and relationship of all the offshoots of the family. For that reason he will attempt no such formid¬ able and impossible task. It will be his purpose to show the origin of the Warder family in and around Wiltshire, in the Western part of England. Sir Chiodoke Warder was Knighted in the year 1585. The Ilook of Heraldry by John Guiliam, Pursivant at Arms, London, England, 1742, says: “Arms wore granted to Sir Chiodoke Warder, who was the cousin and heir of John Warder of West- bury, Wiltshire, in the County of Wiltshire, England, 1585.” Part I page 196. Descended from this Sir Chiodoke Warder was Sir Philip Warder, bearing arms, the first of the clan to emigrate to America. He married Mary Fairfax and together with her brothers, Thomas and William Fairfax, they emigrated to America and settled in Charles County, Mary¬ land. They had three sons, Joseph, born De¬ cember 5, 1752, Philip and Walter. My infor¬ mation through family sources is that Walter went to Boston and there engaged in the ship¬ ping business. Philip with his brother, Joseph, after the Revolutionary War, emigrated to Vir¬ ginia and settled in Fairfax and Fauquier Coun¬ ties. The records of the Surrogate's Court of Charles County, Maryland, gives a list of the citizens of Baltimore who signed, in the year 1778, the Oath of Allegiance to the State of Maryland and the new government of the United States. Prominent in this list of patriots stand the names of Thomas Fairfax, William Fairfax and Philip Warder, the names standing together and evidently signed at the same time, a circum¬ stance strongly corroborating the fact of their relationship. The Revolutionary Records of the Maryland Historical Society show that Joseph Warder, the son of Philip and Mary (Fairfax) Warder was enrolled as a Revolutionary soldier in the military company commanded by Captain Hugh \" ' 4 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY Garner, of Charles County, Maryland, his name being 34th on the list. This was in 1779. The above facts have been ascertained and satisfactorily established by very careful person¬ al and expert examiners of the original records and sources of information. They have been accepted by the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution as satisfactory evidence for admission of the descendants of Joseph Warder, Sr., for membership in those orders based on his military service in the Revolution¬ ary War. Many of the female descendants of this Joseph Warder are members of the Daugh¬ ters of the American Revolution. Prior to his enlistment, Joseph Warder, Sr., who was born December 5th, 17 52, was, on De¬ cember 23rd, 1773, married in Charles County, Maryland, to Esther Ford, wTho wras born April 13th, 1755. A short time after the Revolution, Joseph Warder and his wife, Esther, together with his brother, Philip Warder, and probably the brothers, Thomas and William Fairfax, follow¬ ing their relative, Lord Fairfax, emigrated from Maryland to Fairfax County, Virginia, and the adjoining County of Fauquier. The following children were born to Joseph Warder and Esther (Ford) Warder: Joseph Warder, Sr., was born December 5th, 1752. Esther Ford was born April 13th, 1755. They were married December 2 3rd, 1773. They had children: William Warder, the first born, died in in¬ fancy. John Warder was born September 9th, 1775. Minister. Married Ann Elliott, daughter of Judge Elliott of Virginia. Mary Warder was born January 18th, 1777. Married Zachary Quesenberry. Henry Warder was born January 24th, 1779. Died in infancy. Joseph Warder, Jr., was born October 17th, 17 81. Married Fanny Elliott of Virginia. Rev. olutionary ancestor. Elisabeth Warder was born February 1st, 1 7 84. Married Clement Hitch. William Warder was born January 8th, 178G. Minister. Married Margaret Morehead, sister of Gov. (’. S. Morehead. Walter Warder was born December 13th, 1787. Minister. Married Mary Madox of Glas¬ gow, Kentucky. Elisha Warder was born October 19th, 1789. No record of Elisha’s marriage. Sarah Warder was born July 4th, 1792. Married Robert Ritchie. Judith Warder was born January 3rd, 1795. Married Hayden Trigg. Henry Warder was born December 28th, 17 9 6. Married Louisa Page. Esther Warder was born March 10th, 1798. Married H. Caloway. The above entries of births are copied from the original Family Bible of Joseph and Esther (Ford) Warder, and all of them have been carefully certified. Two of the sons, Walter and William, in the year 1807, being then respec¬ tively 20 and 21 years of age, left Fauquier County, Virginia, and travelled on horseback across the mountains of Virginia and Kentucky, joining the great rush of Virginians who from about the year 1800, had poured, in constantly increasing numbers, to take up the rich land in the beautiful blue grass country of Kentucky, just opening up for settlement after years of fighting by the early pioneer hunters to redeem it from the bloody and warlike Indians who had long claimed it as their hunting ground. This prospecting brought the two. adventur¬ ous Virginians to Barren County, Kentucky, where they were so charmed with the richness of the land, the beauty of the scenery, the boundless expanse of waving blue grass and the substantial character of the new settlers, mostly from their own native State of Virginia, includ¬ ing many surviving veterans of the Revolution¬ ary War, that they at once wrote back to the family in Fauquier County, urging them all to join them without delay to settle and enter the land in this wonderful and favored region. The arguments of the brothers must have been strong and convincing for we find that in a ver>r short time, being in the year 1807, Joseph War¬ der and all the rest of his family decided to leave the old home of the Warder and Fairfax families once and for all and to cast their fate with the two sons in Kentucky, which was then often known as the new Virginia. They selected lands for their new homes in the County of Barren, a few miles east of Glas¬ gow, the County Seat. Here they opened up I x ; ..fill ; 1 1 . ' . THE WARDER FAMILY 5 their farms and entered upon the life of the pioneer settlers in the wilderness. They had come of a fine race of ancestors and they made sturdy and exemplary Citizen They were highly regarded in the community and for many years they and their descendants occupied the lands where they first settled. Many of them deep in an old burying ground on one of the farms originally settled by ..hem. It is near the old Dripping Springs Baptist Church of which the family were all members. On the front wall of the County Court House, in the City of Glasgow, the County Seat of Barren County, there is a bronze tablet erect¬ ed by the Daughters of the Revolution in mem¬ ory of the 4 6 veterans of the Revolutionary War who are buried in Barren County. On this is the name of Joseph Warder. These Warders seem to have been a deeply religious people, most generally leading Chris¬ tian lives as devoted members of the Church. In England and in Virginia, before the Revolution, and before public sentiment had become embit¬ tered against the mother country, they had ad- « hered and supported the Protestant Episcopal Church of England, known also by the name of the Anglican Church. About that time there swept through Virginia a great revival of religion led by the Baptist de¬ nomination and by reason of the adherence of the Curates and Rectors of the Anglican Church to the British cause, thousands of it' mem¬ bers in Virginia, through patriotic motives and sentiment, severed their connection with the Episcopal Church and became ardent members of the Missionary Baptist Church. This was the course pursued by ..he Virginia Warders. They must have been very earnest Chris¬ tians for we find that in the year 1S07, shortly after their settlement in their new home, they united with the Dripping Spring Baptist Church located in ..heir neighborhood. The first church house was built of logs and has long since dis¬ appeared, but the Dripping Spring still flows on, a beautiful fountain of pure and sparkling water as the writer who recently visited it can testify. In 1809 the Warders, with other of their neighbors, entered iiuo the constitution of a church known as the Mount Pisgah Missionary Baptist Church, of which the Rev. Ralph Petty became the pastor. This history, however much it may be im¬ perfect, and lacking in many details which, if known, would add greatly to its interest and value, is yet fairly descriptive of a family of several generations of pioneers, such pioneers as were forceful and constructive in forming our institutions and laying the foundations for our country’s future greatness. It will be interesting here to note the char¬ acter of the times and the circumstances sur¬ rounding this family at the period of its advent into Kentucky. The Kentucky country had, in the years im¬ mediately succeeding the year 18 00, just emerg¬ ed from a long and bloody struggle to conquer the cruel and vengeful Indians, and though some remained they had ceased to impede the tide of frontier immigration. The conquest of the In¬ dians accomplished, the conquest of the soil was now begun by these settlers from Virginia with the zeal and enthusiasm of crusaders of civili¬ zation. Theodore Roosevelt says in his history of the Winning of the West of these pioneers: “The bulk of the settlers were men of sterling worth; lit to be pioneer fathers of a mighty and beau¬ tiful state. They possessed the courage that enabled them to defy outside foes, together with the rough, practical common-sense that enabled them to establish a simple but effective form of government, co as to preserve order among themselves. To succeed in the wilderness it was necessary to possess not only daring but also patience and the capacity to endure grinding toil. These pioneers were hunters and husband¬ men. Each, by the aid of his axe and brand, cleared his patch of corn in the forest cloce to some swift flowing stream, or pure sparkling spring, and by his skill with the rifle won from canebrake and woodland the game on which his family lived until the first crop was grown.” Winning of the West, Vol. I, page 219. There are two most powerful factors in the formation of character and the development of manhood, heredity and environment, and in both of these the Warder family was highly fa¬ vored and fairly typical of the forces under¬ lying the development of the country and the organization of society. We have briefly traced the heredity evolu¬ tion of this Warder family from its earliest origin in England and Virginia to its final set- ' 6 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY tlement in Barren County, Kentucky. The claim that their ancestors were among the “First Families of Virginia,” a phrase often used, is well authenticated by record evidence and it stands undisputed and accepted. The writer feels sure that it will be of in¬ terest to the reader of these notes, especially if he be a descendant of that family, to recall and review something of the environments of these Virginia forefathers both prior to and at the time of their removal to Kentucky. In searching the various sources of information on this subject I have found no better description of the early settlers who came from Virginia to Kentucky than that given by Professor Shaler in his History of Kentucky. He says: “The original settlement brought to the soil of Vir¬ ginia a well chosen representation of English people. At the time of the Revolution Virginia was the most populous, and in many ways the richest of a!l the colonies. Her population was nearly all agricultural and less dependent on the outer world than any of the American settle¬ ments. The institution of slavery made her able to send a large part of her white men imo the field when they were called to arms. This pop¬ ulation was in excellent condition for military duty. Her considerable service in the French War together with her long struggle with the Indians in her own dominion and in North Caro¬ lina had kept her accustomed to arms; more¬ over, their habits of field sports contributed to this training. Virginia furnished a larger share of soldiers than any other of the colonies except Massachusetts, during the Revolution. Nearly all cl her loyal, able-bodied folk saw service during the war, both in the field and in the more difficult paths of legislation. She sprang at once into a marvelous activity. Men who had not exhibited the ability for statecraft and lead¬ ership petty and hampered politics of the col¬ ony showed at once an amazing capacity for broad-minded statesmanship and the higher work of the soldier. The seven years of war had sufficed to awaken the long-dormant ener¬ gies of the people. Every hour of the struggle was fertile in intellectual growth. To the end they had given a larger share of vigorous and able men than had perhaps sprung from any equal population of the race. It teems likely that it can be accounted for in part by the in¬ heritance of culture, the united life of a homoge¬ nous people and the strong control that nat¬ ural leaders had upon the society in which they dvyelt.” “The conditions of a community at the close of a long and successful war are peculiarly fa¬ vorable for the making of new colonies; and it is natural that at this time Virginia, no longer herself a colony, but a State where the choicest land had long been taken up and cultivated, should have been permeated by the colonizing spirit.” “The pioneering fever was still in the blood and ready for an opportunity to reassert itself once more. These circumstances led to a very large exodus of her population to the new fields of the West.” “The recently founded settlements in Ken¬ tucky, begun ten years before, had gone far enough to prove that land in abundance and of excellent quality could be had for the trouble of possessing it. Every ambitious spirit, every man who had within him the sense of power necesrary for the arduous work of facing the dangers of a wilderness 'where he would have to battle for everything, with nature and the savage, sought these new fields. It is to these conditions that the new settlements beyond the Alleghanies owed the most of the population that came to them in the years immediately fol¬ lowing the Revolution. A small part of the Kentucky settlers came from soutnern Mary¬ land and from central North Carolina, sections essentially like that of Virginia in their general aspect.\" “By far the most important element of the Kentucky colonists came from the soldiers who were disbanded at the close of the war with Great Britain. The number of Revolutionary soldiers who emigrated to Kentucky may oe judged by the fact tha. in 1840, nearly 60 years after the termination of that struggle, the pen¬ sion returns show that there were about 900 of those veterans still living in the State, their ages according to the record, varying from 7 0 to 100 years. This was of course but a small part of the host who had found a dwelling place in tin- state. Probably at least ten times this number had gone to ..heir graves. Such men were, by their native strength and their deeds the natural leaders in the new settlements, both in peace and war. The Kentucky spirit, the offspring of the Revolutionary War, was elrewhere over- # ' ' I THE WARDER FAMILY 7 whelmed by the tide of commercial life; here it lived on, fed by tradition and by a nearly con¬ tinuous combat down to the time of the Re¬ bellion.” “We have now traced in brief outline the conditions of the people who made the Common¬ wealth of Kentucky from the time of their set¬ tlement in this country to the exodus into Ken¬ tucky.” “We have seen that in the beginning they were mainly Englishmen, who came voluntarily to America, not generally under the pressure or political or religious persecution, but with a view to bettering their conditions. It was doubt¬ less, on the whole, a selecton of the best coun¬ try blood of the mother land. From this pickea people, after a century or more of development in Virginia, a second selection was made to found the Virginia of the Wes,. As before not¬ ed, such a budding of a new state from an old colony has hardly a precedent in the history of America. Most of the other states have been settled by an admixture of people from differ¬ ent states and sections including foreign nations. “In Kentucky, on the other hand, we find nearly pure English blood, mainly drawn through the Old Dominion and altogether from districts that shared the Virginia conditions.” “It is moreover, the largest body of pure English folk that has, speaking generally, been separated from the mother country for two hun¬ dred years.” “We see, -therefore, how interesting is the problem of Kentucky population.” Shaler’s History of Kentucky, pages 18-27. “The history of Kentucky is at once unique and attractive. It begins like a romance, thrill¬ ing in tales of heroic deeds and exciting adven¬ tures. From the earliest settlement of the state, all through the crises in its own life and the life of the nation, Kentucky has held an honored position, and lias produced men of great and noble character. None but the brave dared or desired to risk the perils of these untried for¬ ests; therefore Kentucky was founded by men of forceful qualities, remarkable as well for strength of mind as for endurance of body.” Kinkead’s History of Kentucky. The writer has endeavored in the foregoing pages to give a brief but true perspective of the background and environments of the Warder family at the date of its removal from Virginia to Kentucky, in 1807. The descendants of Joseph Warder, Sr., the Revolutionary ancestor, and his wife, Esther Ford, at once became an active part of the new pioneer community, all o.f them to prove good and substantial citizens and members of soci¬ ety; some of them to become prominent and in¬ fluential in the history of Kentucky and other states. Originally, before and after the Revo¬ lutionary War, they had been members and ad¬ herents of the Anglican Church, but owing to their patriotic sentiment and loyalty to the cause of Independence they were swept, with vast numbers of Virginia Episcopalians, into the Baptist Church which about that time was the leader in a great revival of religion within the entire state. In politics it is needless to say they were Whigs at that time, though in later times many of them joined the Democratic Party. It has often been asked of the writer why this Warder family became alienated from the church of their English and early Virginia an¬ cestors. The reason is not far to seek. We have seen that during the Revolutionary War, the Warders, Philip and the brothers, Thomas and William Fairfax, as shown by the Court records of Baltimore, had taken and recorded their oath of allegiance to support the new state and national government and had ceased to ne subjects of Great Britain. It is a fact of history that most of the English curates and rectors and many of the members of the Episcopal Church in Virginia were avowed tories and in sympathy with the mother country. The popular feeling against tithing and other oppressive legal re¬ quirements of the established church created an intense feeling of antagonism to it and led to its uisestablishment as a state church and substitut¬ ed absolute freedom of religious action and equality of all church denominations under the law. A great revival of religion, as before stated, had been led by the Baptists which made that denomination first in point of numbers and in¬ fluence. Joseph Warder, Sr., and Esther Ford, while residing in Fauquier County, became members of the Thumb Run Baptist Church then under the charge of John Munroe as pastor. Probably all of their children and family had joined the Baptist Church with them, excepting ' . . V 8 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY Walter and William, the two young adventurers who had crossed the mountains on horseback to locate a home beyond the Alleghanies. In the year IS 07 and shortly after their ar¬ rival in Barren County, all the adult members of the family, including the young sons, Walter and William, then just coming to manhood age, became members of the Dripping Spring Bap¬ tist Church, then under the pastoral care of Rev. Robert Stockton, an able and distinguished preacher who had also, some time before, emi¬ grated from Virginia and had become one of the leading ministers of the Green River Associa¬ tion. They had doubtless known him in Vir¬ ginia and it may be inferred that it was largely through his influence that the family came to Barren County. It is also probable that his ad¬ vice and encouragement had much to do witn inducing three of the sons, Walter, William and John, very shortly after, to enter the work of the ministry. In 1809, for reasons of convenience perhaps, the members of the Warder family and some ot their immediate neighbors entered into the con¬ stitution of the Mount Pisgah Baptise Churcn which w'as near their home. The historian gives this brief epitaph of the founders of the family: “Here the parents, Jo¬ seph and Esther, remained faithful church mem¬ bers till the Master took them home.” Such the brief and simple annals of these worthy pi¬ oneers. History and tradition has left few and faint records of their daily lives and few are the monuments that mark where these “fore¬ fathers of the forest lie.” They left five sons, John, Joseph, Henry, William and Walter. Of these, three, John, Wil¬ liam and Walter, became Baptist ministers. John went to Missouri while William and Wal¬ ter gave their lives to the work in Kentucky. Walter and William became bright and shin¬ ing lights in the church, noted and distinguish¬ ed in the history of the state as pioneer . found¬ ers and builders of the Baptist Church in North¬ ern Kentucky. Especially is this true of Rev. Walter War¬ der, who removed to Mason County, near Maysville. As the story in his life is both interesting and dramatic, the writer feels justified in giv¬ ing it space and prominence in these memoirs, in order that his descendants, wherever they may be, may learn of his fine character, his great ability, his remarkable career and his life¬ long devotion to the cause of Christian religion. His name well deserves to be rescued from obliv¬ ion. A century and a quarter is a long time and the records of the past are soon obliterated oy the hand of time. It is a source of regret that so little remains io fill in the details of this story of a life. My information has been gathered from a variety of sources but mainly from my own pa¬ tient investigations covering a number of years and from tuch historical sources, consisting of church and family records and biographical sketches as I have, with much effort, been able to find and examine. In this connection I men¬ tion especially Benedict’s History of the Bap¬ tists in America, Spencer’s History of the Ken¬ tucky Baptists, and Kev. Z. T. Cody's History of the Mays Lick Baptist Church. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF REV. WALTER WARDER Rev. Walter Warder was born in Fauquier County, Virginia, December 13th, 1787, the fourth son of Joseph and Esther Ford Warder. He was barely twenty years of age when the family removed from Fauquier County, Virginia, to Barren County, Kentucky, and they settled near the present city of Glasgow, the county seat. Little is known of his early boyhood life but from the prominence and social position of the family in Virginia it is certain that his early training was not neglected. While probably not a graduate of college or university it is recorded that he made good use of such facilities for ed¬ ucation as were afforded by the intelligent and advanced community in which he grew up to manhood. Such of 111”. writings as remain show that he wrote a beautiful hand and had com¬ mand of good and forceful Englisn. He was by \\ ■ . ' ' THE WARDER FAMILY 9 no means a rude or uncultured frontiersman. A biographer says of him: “The things he wrote will never cease to be readable.” The same writer says of aim that his ac- quirments were greatly supplemented and aug¬ mented by wide reading and persistent and con¬ tinuous study throughout the entire period of his ministry. His biographer also says he was of handsome appearance ana impressive and winning manners. His early years had been spent among the very best of Virginia people directly descended from the earlier English set¬ tlers. We may think of him at this time of his life, as being fond of outdoor sports, so char¬ acteristic of his English and Virginia cotempo¬ raries, including hunting and the then popular diversion of the fox-chase. He was recognized as a well-born and well-bred gentleman in the society of his day and country. In the latter part of the winter of 1807, we are told in Rev. Spencer's History of Kentucky Baptists, that Walter and his elder brother, William, entered into a covenant to seek the salvation of their souls. Soon after this Wil¬ liam set out on a journey to Virginia. On his return the brothers met with great joy. They had both found what they sought, peace in Christian faith. They were both baptized on the same day in 1808. Walter came up out ot the water a preacher. “He immediately com¬ menced to declare what great things the Lord had done for his soul and to exhort others to turn to Christ and live.” On December 7th, 1807, he had married Mary Maddox, daughter of Samuel Maddox, a substantial citizen of Barren County. In 1809, he with members of his family and some of their neighbors entered into the con¬ stitution of the Mount Pisgah Missionary Bap¬ tist Church. He was regularly ordained as a minister in the year 1811, and shortly thereafter was called to the pastoral, charge of tne Dover Baptist Church, in Barren County, near his home. Of his ministry there we know but little. Bene¬ dict’s History of the Baptists in America tells us that the Green River Association was held at Dripping Spring Church, in Barren County, July in 1812. Jacob Locke was Moderator and Wal¬ ter Warder, Clerk. He was accredited to the church at Dover with 7 5 members. While his church was a small one in point of numbers it was one of 33 churches constituting the Green River Association containing 2,499 communi¬ cants. That he was named as Clerk of this large body indicates that his first year in the ministry had been successful and tnat he had already won recognition and distinction among his co-laborers in that section of Kentucky. However satisfactory might have been his surroundings at Dover, a great change was very soon to come in his life and fortunes. He was soon to be called to enter upon a new and a wider field for his future growth and develop¬ ment. His way of life was to broaden. No longer a hunter of game he was to become a hunter of men’s souls. He was to sound forth the gospel trumpet calling men to follow the cross of Christ. He won multitudes of men and women to embrace the cause oi religion and the church. It will be of interest and an aid to the reader in following the story of his life to briefly con¬ sider the country and place to which he was to transfer the field of his ministerial activities. In the year 1813 Jeremiah Vardeman and Wil¬ liam Warder had visited the Baptist Church ot Mayslick, in Mason County, Kentucky, and held a series of meetings which had caused a great revival of religion and had added 150 converts to the church. William’s brother, Walter, then only 2 6 years old, had preached a few time^ during this revival. At the close of the meet¬ ings the Church first called William Warder, who declined their invitation. They then gave his brother, Walter, a call to take the pastoral charge of their church, which he accepted. Mason County has an interesting place in the building of the West and in the history of Kentucky. It was established in 17 88 by the Legi: lature of Virginia and was the eighth ot the nine counties which existed in 17 92, when Kentucky was separated from the mother state and admitted into the Union. The soil, based on limestone, is deep, rich and highly product¬ ive; much of it is the finest quality or blue grass land, not surpassed in the world.” Collier’s History of Kentucky. The county seat was first at Washington, a few miles from Mayslick. Maysville was afterwards the county seat. Up to 1800 it was known as Limestone. From the very beginning of western settlement, Limestone had been the landing place and port of entry where the army of emigrants from the Eastern . * 10 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY and Northern states first landed. It was from there what was known as the Old Buffalo Trail led, by way of Mayslick, Washington and the Lower Blue Lick Springs, 65 miles to Lexing¬ ton, along what afterwards became the celebrat¬ ed Maysville and Lexington Turnpike. It was the trail over which came the most of the set¬ tlers, by way of the Ohio River, into the in¬ terior of Kentucky. In 1812 Maysville was only a small frontier town but it was a point of intense activity as the gateway into the rich blue grass meadows of Kentucky. Mayslick was a little village, or settlement, a few miles southeast of Maysville, both named from James May, who entered the land on which they were located. Mayslick was so named from a salt spring where in early days salt was made by the Indians and first settlers. Here Walter Warder, the young preacher, found a new world far different from the quiet backwoods surroundings of Dover and Scags Creek, in Barren County. A continuous proces¬ sion of emigrants, settlers, hunters, surveyors, Indians, scouts, prospectors and adventurers poured along this trail, making an exciting and ever changing drama of life in the great West. Mason County had already come into prom¬ inence by reason of its strategic location, the richness of its soil and the beauty of its land¬ scape. Besides the Virginians, a considerable number of the settlers had come from New England and had brought with them their well known enthusiasm for education. Professor Shaler says: “The effect of their presence was seed in the rapid development of education in this section. Mason County became the best schooled county in the State, and from it came a large number of teachers, educators, states¬ men, lawyers, orators and other scholarly men.\" The town of Mayslick was located in the best part of Mason County, between Washing¬ ton Court House and Maysville and but a few miles from those places. On October 15th, 1804, Robert McMillan deposed: “That Mayslick or May's Spring was, in early days, one of the finest places on the north side of Licking River, and as much talked of; it lay on the Buffalo Trail, leading out from Limestone to the Lower Blue Licks Springs and was much noted as a camping ground and also noted as being troubled with Indians.” The scholarly divine and traveller, Timothy Flint, in his Letters from America, wrote: “To the south of Limestone is a rich table land di¬ versified by gentle slopes and moderate emi¬ nences. Mayslick is a small village a few miles sou.h of Limestone. A rich soil and a fine un¬ dulated surface unite in forming a neighbor¬ hood truly delightful. The most florid descrip¬ tions of Kentucky have conveyed to my mind no idea of a country finer naturally than this.” Cumings’ Tour of the West says of this area: “The country on every side appears to be better improved than I have observed in any part of America.” General Levi Todd, of Lexington, in 1784, deposed, “That from 17 7 9 to that date, Mays¬ lick has been a place of much note. It was for some years called May's Spring after the large spring near the Buffalo Trail or road.” The original settlers of Mayslick, who float¬ ed down the Ohio from the East, were three brothers. Abraham, Cornelius ana Isaac Drake, John Shotwell and David Morris. They pur¬ chased from James May 1,400 acres of land of great beauty and fertility upon which they laid out their farms and built their rude homes. The land was purchased in common but they after¬ wards divided it into separate tracts in such a manner that each had a corner in the lick or salt spring from which their salt was manu¬ factured. They worked hard and soon were rich and prosperous. They were strong men of sterling worth and their names and the names of their descendants became prominent and dis¬ tinguished in the history of Kentucky and the West. All of these first settlers were Baptists and in 17S9, shortly after their arrival, they or¬ ganized the Mayslick Baptist Church afterwards lo play an important part in the religious his¬ tory of the State. One of the officiating min¬ isters on that occasion was James Garrard, who afterwards served two terms as Governor of the State. The tradition is that the church was con¬ stituted in David Morris's barn, in which the congregation met for worship until a suitable building was erected. He often conducted the services. in this connection it is of interest to briefly note the religious tendencies in that country, at or about that particular time. Professor Whaler says of the Baptists in Kentucky: “The first minsters of the gospel were almost always THE WARDER FAMILY 11 Baptists, who with their usual valor entered the state with the earliest settlers. In 17 80 a vig¬ orous immigration of that faith took place. When the Revolution was over and the trek of immigration was at its Hood, it brought a host of Baptist preachers with it. The Baptists were the original pioneers of Kentucky, and to this day they hold the first place in its churches. Of the religious tendencies of that time Pro¬ fessor Shaler further says: ‘‘The first years after the beginning of 18 00 were eventful ones in Kentucky. Tne long pause in warfare had given a chance for tne minds of the people to turn into other more peaceful channels. The firs, woik of this social change was a great increase in the religious sentiment. The revivals were frequent and caused much excitement amongst all classes. These exciting revivals had their psychological and mental culture. Thousands who never oth¬ erwise would have been taken from the life of the day obtained an insight into the depths of the problems of existence which could come to them in no other way; a large part of them got it from effects that lasted all their lives. No one who remembers the people who owed their conversion to this time can doubt that on the whole it was a blessed influence which the end¬ less combats of thirty years had put upon the people.” Shaler’s History of Kentucky, Page 147. Such were the good influences and happy en¬ vironment that welcomed our Walter Warder, the young Virginian, who had come to make his home at Mayslick and to later take a leading and an active part in the growth of the village and all of Mason County. Later his work and personal influence were to extend to a wide ter¬ ritory in Northern Kentucky and to leave their imprint on a vast number of his fellow country¬ men. That Joseph Warder, Sr., father of the Bap list ministers, Walter, William and John War¬ der, after he emigrated to Kentucky from Vir¬ ginia, became a man of considerable estate and the owner of extensive tracts of fine lands in the neighborhood of Glasgow, is evidenced by the following copies of the Court Records of Barren County, Kentucky: WILL OF JOSEPH WARDER, SR., OF GLASGOW, KY.

Copy furnished by Mrs. W. B. Smith of Glas¬ gow, Kentucky. In sketching herein briefly and imperfectly the story of Walter Warder’s life after his re¬ moval to Mays Lick, I will have to draw largely from two reliable sources, one the \"History ot Kentucky Baptists,’’ by Reverend Spencer, of Eminence, Kentucky, a work of great labor, anu highly regarded as an authority by Kentuck¬ ians, the other ‘‘The History of Mays Lick Bap¬ tist Church,” by Reverend Z. T. Cody, prepared and read by him at the Centennial Celebration of the Mays Lick Baptist Church, October 9, 1889. I will, in some instances, make liberal quo¬ tations, and in others will make use only of the substance of the text. ‘‘When Walter Warder entered on his min¬ istry, he preached in a church built of roughly hewn logs about twenty years before he came to Mays Lick, probably in 179 3. It was erected on the very spot where his monument now stands. The first founders, ihe Drakes, the Shotwells, the Morrises, and others, with their offspring, were doubtless still faithful pillars of ■ THE WARDER FAMILY 13 the church. Reverend Spencer says of these founders: “Despise not the day of small begin¬ ning:-. ” Eitner small or great things seem not to have occurred to these sterling believers as they erected the cross of Christ in the midst of their homes. Organizing a churcb without a pastor, or the prospects of soon obtaining one, in an almost unbroken wilderness, with no house but a barn, with only four members, all of whom were closely related, that every Bible form was minutely and colemnly observed, that every doctrine and religious duty was carefully weighed and expressed, indicates that the whole aim of the founders was to do the will of God.” “Their aim was not to prepare tor the com¬ ing flood of immigration. How much of it would settle around them they knew not. They want¬ ed to observe God acceptably. Their eyes were on God rather than on man. If this loyalty was the germ which God’s grace developed into a mighty church around which no other grew, or could grow for many years.” “Other first members were Allen, Hixon, Langly, Young, and Johnson, and many that space forbids me to mention.” “For a time the church prospered and num¬ bered perhaps one hundred members, bUo its ranks had been greatly reduced, and interest had abated. This was the condition of the church in IS 13 when Jeremiah Vardeman and William Warder conducted a revival, bringing more than one hundred fifty members into the fold. Reverend Spencer says: “There was another great blessing which this meeting brought to the church. They became acquainted with Wal¬ ter Warder, who had preached a few times dur¬ ing the progress of the revival and gave him a unanimous call. However unfortunate the church had previously been in the selection of pastors, they -now had one of the noblest men, not only of his state, but of his day. Mr. War¬ der was of medium height, slightly curved nose, and gray eyes. His carriage was with great dignity. His manners were ever serious ana solemn, sometimes seemingly austere. Levity found no place in his composition or presence. He had tha„ John Bunyan power to seize upon those great truths that lie close to men's hearts and express them in words befitting their im¬ portance. IHe was perhaps the greatest exhorter of his day. ^ Everything about the man contrib¬ uted to his power over the hearts of his fellows; his character of mind; his voice, which was clear and persuasive; his solemn, earnest manner; his intense love for human souls; his living, vivid sense of the realises of eternity; and above all, the fact that men knew that his words were the expression of realities in his own heart. His dai¬ ly walk was most exemplary. He was deeply humble and amazed at the consideration that his brethren loved to bestow on him. in the pulpit and out of it he was the same man. He was humble, dignified, serious; for his character was natural, rather than professional; it grew and was not made. Religion, like blood, was in ev¬ ery part of him. He was just a man, and like the garment of Christ, he was without seam. No man ever loved peace more, or strove more to preserve it. He served his church from 1814 to 1836, more ihan twenty-two years, and his labors were highly blessed, there being in all more than one thousand added to the member¬ ship.” In 1817 the church rejoiced in a precious revival, which added \"fifty to the membership, and again in 1819, ’20, ’21 and ’22 it was great¬ ly blessed in common with the cause throughout the state. “At the close of 1822 the membership num¬ bered three hundred thirty-five, the highest point that had yet been reached. * There were not protracted meetings. Mr. Warder himself seems to have done most of the preaching, not night after night at the church, but with inter¬ missions, sometimes of weeks, and very fre¬ quently at private houses or school houres in different parts of the community. There were not any turnpikes then, and it was more diffi¬ cult to come to church than to gather at some Godly neighbor’s and hear the Word. The re¬ vival spirit would then last for months; for in¬ stance, the meeting of 1817 continued with shoi\\ intermissions from March to July. This was the fourth year of his ministry, and his work had met with wonderful success. The community had grown rapidly, and he had grown with it. From a small and weak organi¬ zation, he had built up a large and flourishing church. The population of that area was rapid¬ ly increasing, and many new settlers were locat¬ ing and improving the land in the neighbor¬ hood. The country was becoming not only rich and prosperous, buc for some cause, not easily ' 14 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY accounted for, the revival spirit which he had aroused, and which had been almost continu¬ ously with Mr. Warder’s pastorate, suddenly stopped at the close of 1822. For the five years from 1822 to 1827 there was a period of spirit¬ ual barrenness and inactivity. The church ret¬ rograded and its membership fell from three hundred thirty-nine to two hundred sixteen. The cause of this falling off would be interest¬ ing if it were known. Perhaps a number ot causes were involved. The people were very prosperous and with material prosperity came indifference to religious and spiritual concerns. The territory of this church was extensive. There was not another church then in Mays Lick, and with the exception of a small Pres¬ byterian church a few miles io the east, and a small Methodist church a few miles to the west, there was no other church in the thickly settled district, and the territory now covered by the Lewicburgh, Mt. Pisgah and Ewing churches was then under the spiritual charge of the Mays Lick Baptist church. In this large, prosperous, and thickly settled territory there had been not even a poor revival of religion in five years, and the membership of the church had decreas¬ ed more than one hundred. Dissension over questions of doctrine had begun to cause trouble growing out of the preaching of Alexander Campbell, an able ana scholarly man from Virginia who was then preaching as a regular ordained Bapti t preach¬ er, from time to time, at the Baptist churches in northern Kentucky. Owing to his popularity as a great orator he had been invited by Mr. War¬ der and the Mays Lick Baptist church to preach occasionally io the people from his pulpit. Mr. Warder little realized that this was the opening wedge which was afterwards to create schism and dissension, to aid in ihe diversion of the Mays Lick church and the forming of a new religious faith and denomination. “The questions which Mr. Campbell were bringing to the front had already begun to agi¬ tate the church, but the result lay far in tire future and was then unforseen. From these causes Mr. Warder became deeply dejected in spirit and mourned over the condition of Zion, so much so that he thought seriously of giving up the care of the church. In 1824, when the annual call was extended to him, he asked for a month to consider the matter. Under the date of February 12, 1825, the church minutes re¬ cord, that. Brother Warder informed the church that he did not wish to continue to hold or ex¬ ercise the office of pastor of the church, but that he was willing, as he is a member with us, to exercise his gifts of teaching the Christian re¬ ligion among us as usual.’ Nor did he again take the pastoral care of the church until April. 1827, though he continued to preach regularly for them. He must have, even at that time, forseen with grief and regret the future and impending storm of warfare and dissension. He earnestly sought and prayed that it might be averted. He longed for peace, and at the sacri¬ fice of his personal conviction, his worldly in¬ terests, and his professional pride and ambition, he placed his resignation in the hands of his flock that they might, without regard to him, exercise perfect freedom of conscience and lib¬ erty of action. This act of renunciation of seir is perhaps one of the illustrations of the fine and noble character he possessed. That the members throughout this interim, in spite of his resignation, persisted' in following his lead¬ ership, attests their great affection and person¬ al regard for him.” “The darkest hour is just before dawn. At (his critical time the church became deeply con¬ cerned about the condition of herself and the community. Days were set apart for fasting and prayer. Their prayers were not in vain, for in 182 8 a revival, the most remarkable that ever visited this community, and one of the greatest (hat ever blessed any church, was given to them as God's abounding answer. Jordan over-flowed all its banks. I will here give a brief account of that remarkable meeting:” “As Mr. Warder was coming from his home, then abou. three miles northeast of the town, where Mr. B. T. Cleft now lives, to attend the church meeting on Saturday, January 12, 1828, lie felt unusually sad and wept as he thought of the spiritual condition of the community. He stopped for a few minu.es at the home of the late John Shotwell, and in conversation with his daughter, Mrs. Priscilla Wilson, said that: ‘It would do as much good to preach to the rocks and stumps and trees as to these people.’ Th.it day there was no business that came before the church, but we find this record made: ‘No busi¬ ness done to make a record of. Yet the clerk would here remark that a proposition was made THE WARDER FAMILY 15 and unanimously agreed to, for the church to meet one hour earlier on the next day than the usual time, and spend that hour in confession of sin before God and in earnest supplication to him to save the souls of our children ano neighbors.” ‘‘Never before or since did the church trans¬ act more important business, or any that paid better in results. They met on the next day ac¬ cording to agreement. After the hour of con¬ fession and prayer, Mr. Warder preached a ten¬ der and powerful sermon. The congregation was melted to tears, and many trembled because of sin. To quote an eye witness: ‘A great ef¬ fect was visible at the time and confirmed by future evidence from many persons, and the great refreshing from the presence of the Lord commenced in an astonishing manner.’ In this way the revival began and continued all the year, and until March, 1829. The seed had been sown and the harvest was rich and bountiful. The preaching was done chiefly by Mr. Warder, with whom the revival commenced, and upon whom, under God, it mainly depended. He de¬ voted nearly all the year to this community, but there were many intermissions of weeks in which he would labor in other parts of Bracken Association, where the revival spirit had flowed or to which he would carry it. Already his rep¬ utation had spread into adjoining counties, and his services were eagerly sought by many churches in times of revival.” “The meeting had not progressed far when the small brick house in which they had wor¬ shipped since 1810 was so damaged by fire as to be unfit for use. The committee appointed to recommend the best course to pursue report¬ ed to make temporary repairs on the old house to fit it for present use and to proceed at once to build on the opposite side of the street a large brick house fifty, by seventy-five feet. The re¬ port was agreed to, and the work begun, but neither the burning of the old, nor the building of the new church could stop or retard the progress of the revival. It had taken deep hold upon the community.” “Religion was the topic of conversation at church, in the store, at home, in the field, on the road, everywhere. Men, women, masters, and slaves were interested in seeking their soul’s salvation. The whole pyramid of society was shaken as by an earthquake. It was a revival in which men mourned on account of sin and rejoiced with joy unspeakable in a new found hope. This, the greatest of all Mays Lick’s re¬ vivals, was pre-eminently one of experimental religion. Grace was again over-flowing all this mountain of sin, and every part of the large ter¬ ritory of the church was washed by the precious and cleansing waves. When the house was dam¬ aged by fire, Mr. Warder commenced to preach in private houses and in the woods. A preaching stand was erected in the grove about one mile west of town, where Dr. H. L. Parry now lives, and great crowds came together to tremble and rejoice beneath Warder’s terrible and persua¬ sive Gospel. The preaching of Mr. Warder was eminently adapted to such a meeting. Rever¬ end William Vaughn, a co-worker, himself a noted preacher, who was an intimate friend, says: ‘His manner of preaching showed that his object was to win souls, and not to make a dis¬ play of his abilities. He preached not himself, but Christ. He never attempted to play the orator, yet he was both eloquent and impres¬ sive; sound speech, soujid common sense, and great seriousness adorned his sermons. He did not deal in the meager traffic of unfelt truth, or preach an unfelt gospel. He possessed a good degree of moral courage, and fearlessly pro¬ claimed what he conceived to be in accordance with the word of God, regardless of the smiles and frowns of men. He was both a son of con¬ solation and a son of thunder.” “There were no turnpikes and but few ve¬ hicles, and it was not an uncommon thing for the first women of the community to walk two and three miles at night through bad weather to Divine service. This custom on Hie part of the rich made the poor feel that the chasm be¬ tween them and their neighbors were not so great, and so. all classes and conditions came freely together. As a result of the revival of 182 8 more than 500 converts were received into the church, and about four hundred eighty-five were baptized. During that same year within the bounds of Bracken Association, Mr. Warder baptized more than a thousand persons. It was a meeting never to be forgotten while the church or ics memory shall live.” We can imagine how great was the joy of this good apostle of the Kentucky meadows at the wonderful change that had come over his beloved church and his own stewardship. His 16 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY star was now in the ascendant, and his ac¬ complishments far beyond his most ardent ex¬ pectations. The future to him must have seem¬ ed full of promise, but this period of peace and happiness was not to be for long. The cloud of dissension that had grown above the horizon in 1824 again made its appearance, foreshadow¬ ing the coming storm that was to bring shadow and disaster to this now great and populous organization. “The wonderful revival had scarcely closed before serious trouble began to arise in the church. Doctrines strange and contrary to what had ever before been on Baptist lips began to be fearlessly, yea, boldly, proclaimed by a few of the leading members. Mr. Alexander Camp¬ bell, at that time a member of a Baptist church in Bethany, Virginia, a native of Scotland, for¬ merly a Presbyterian, for a number of years had been promulgating his views through his paper, the “Christian Baptist,’’ with a view of produc¬ ing a religious reformation in society and of uniting Christendom upon his dogmas. He was a man beloved by his brethren for his noble qualities of heart, and admired for his gifts of leadership. As early as 182 4 he had especially endeared himself to the Baptists of this imme¬ diate section in a debate at nearby Washington, with Mr. McCaHa, an eminent Presbyterian di¬ vine, on the question of Baptism. It is claimed that in the debate he let fall come sentences of uncertain sound, but on the main question ai issue his victory was so complete that the breth¬ ren were willing to overlook what might other¬ wise have seemed ambiguous.” The above, ana much that is to follow in this biographical sketch, is quoted from Reverend Cody’s History of Mays Lick Baptist Church. The author wish¬ es to disclaim any feeling of partisanship in this historical controversy between Mr. Camp¬ bell and the Mays Lick Baptist church, which finally resulted in a division of that church and the founding of the Campbellites, or what is widely known as the Christian Church. He is merely giving the facts as related in the history of the evolution, out of the Baptist Church, of the now large and influential body of Christians called the Christian Church. To further quote from Reverend Cody: “The debate at Washington, only three miles from Mays Lick, opened the door for Mr. Campbell and his paper. Both entered and were exceed¬ ingly popular. By degrees his aims and views became manifest. The word ‘‘Reformation” had a tremendous sound, but Mr. Campbell had the rare art of inspiring in the hearts of his constantly increasing number of followers the firm confidence that he was fully able to bring all that the vague word meant. He and his fol¬ lowers became impressed that they were in a very great religious movement — one that would parallel the Great Reformation. In fact, Mr. Campbell was constantly drawing parallels be¬ tween his time and that of the sixteenth cen¬ tury, between his work and that of Martin Luther.” “His intention, so far as 1 am able to judge, was not to effect a reformation in the morals of the people, but simply to produce a change of religious belief. Without doubt there was much in religions and practices that then needed ref¬ ormation. Calvinism by many was carried to an extreme. The “experiences” of some fur- niched a fine mark for ridicule. The letter of the creed was somtimes given more prominence than the spirit of scripture. Theology, with many, took the place of religion. Mr. Camp¬ bell proclaimed a crusade against all creeds; he exalted baptism to the importance of faLh and repentance and made it the third condi¬ tion to salvation; h£ affirmed that faith was simply the belief of testimony, and that the Holy Spirit did not act directly upon the human heart until after baptism. Many other notions and practices he taught, but around these the fight was made in Mays Lick church. That part of the field upon which the battle was hottest was ‘That baptism was in order to the remis¬ sion of sins.’ The communion question which has been exalted as a cause of separation cut but little figure in the first controversies. It should be borne in mind that the split was upon the doctrine of baptismal remission and thore doctrines of faith, and the work of the Holy Spirit which necessarily follows.” “For a number of years the leaven was at work in tnis church. It affected some quite strongly in 1827. During the progress of the great revival in 1828, the followers of Mr. Camp¬ bell were active in promulgating their views. When the revival closed, there was not, so far as I can learn, a larger or stronger church In the state than the one at Mays Lick; and a finer field for new religious theories Mr. Campbell s THE WARDER FAMILY 17 never found. The membership was nearly eight hundred, and five hundred of these had recently- joined. They were clay for the potter. Mr. Campbell frequently visited the church, and no preacher of his day could count for more before a popular audience than he. He was a fair, but not a great scholar, and did not make pre¬ tensions to a scholarship above what he thought he possessed, but he told what he did know in such a manner that it produced the impression that he knew a great deal more. He was a man of commanding address, of the most perfect selt- possession, of a fluent, stately speech, and of as¬ suring self-confidence. Abtruse questions he could handle in the most popular manner, and yet they appeared none the less abtruse, such was his dignity and the great importance he attached to them. He was unconscious of his own limitations, and in all the questions he touched, wrote and talked with the confidence of one who felt that he was speaking the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, yet he, without doubt, made many changes in his Theology, but the present conviction was held with as much paternal blindness as the last.” “Not that he was extremely or offensively egotistical; for he was not, but simply that his theory, for the time, covered his whole mental horizon. Most men feel oppressed by what they do not know of the truth they have under con¬ sideration, but it seems that Mr. Campbell’s mind was satisfied by what he believed he knew. I would not be understood by this as intimating that he was either limited in knowledge or nar¬ row in mind. He was far from both, but upon the boundary of his positions there was the sign *Ne plus ultra.’ Nature formed him for a great debater. He could throw an interest around whatever he touched. Theories and doctrines, however old and commonplace, looked brand new in his hands, and men thought they were new. Such was his style and manner that his audience would think that his arguments were new, profound, logical, clear, simple, important, nnd complete. I_ was difficult for an ordinary man to successfully debate with Mr. Campbell. However much headway- might be made against his arguments, nothing disturbed his self-pos¬ session or his confidence in his position. There was in Mr. Campbell a wonderful blending of acuteness and obtuseness. Both served a fine Purpose in debate. He did not feel a point, but could turn it quickly against his opponent. Now, added to his popular gifts were goodness of heart, rectitude of character, and humility be¬ fore God. Picture for yourself this man, then a member of the Baptist Church, and while many disagreed with him, yet he was warmly loved for his heart, admired for his head, and honored for his many victories over pedo-Bap- tists and infidels before the Mays Lick Baptist church soon after the great revival; where there was much wealth, sound common sense, and fair intelligence, but where there was no man equal to him in native genius and scholarsnip and forensic ability, and where out of a mem¬ bership of nearly eight hundred, there were five hundred new converts without much doctrinal or Biblical instruction of any kind, and in com¬ mon with the rest of the church had never be¬ fore heard of Mr. Campbell's peculiar views, what would naturally be the result? No prophet was needed to predict. Soon the church was divided on doctrine. Many of the first mem¬ bers were too firmly rooted in the doctrines of grace to be shaken by any transient wind. Stone mountain itself is not safer upon its everlasting base from the devastation of the cyclone than was Deacon Allen and some others amid the storms. They raged around tneir heads and passed over without leaving a mark. But there were others, and among them some of the first men, who were swept from their religious moor¬ ings. Too radical was the difference between the old and the new, that contention, bitter and fierce, was inevitable. Gradually from a begin¬ ning so faint that we cannot tell when it com¬ menced, the storm increased in power until in 1820 it roared amid utter confusion. The church became a Babel. In these hot days the self-constituted preachers abounded more than the men. Everyone of them seemed to feel able to give authoritative interpretations of the scriptures. They argued and argued and ar¬ gued. The new ridiculed the old. The old de¬ nied all the claims of the new. The effect of this torn and distracted condition of his church must have brought the most poignant grief to its gentle and peace-loving pastor. He had al¬ ways been a man of peace, avoiding controversy in matters of doctrine. His efforts had been em¬ inently and wonderfully successful. He had made his church the largest, and one of the most prominent and influential in the state of Ken- > 18 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY tucky. To see this splendid structure, the very crowning accomplishment of his life work threatened, was a disaster to be averted by any means short of a sacrifice of conscience and loy¬ alty to his church. Mr. Campbell was still pro¬ fessing to be a Baptist. Mr. Warder noped the storm would soon blow over and former peace¬ ful relations be restored among his members. He told his friend, Reverend William Vaughn, that he thought it better to agree with Mr. Campbell, as far as he could conscientiously, than cause a rupture in the denomination by openly opposing- them. He had loved, admired, and honored Mr. Campbell, and had welcomed him to preach from his pulpit. He became sat¬ isfied that Mr. Campbell was consciously trying to inculcate new and alien doctrines, but he never was shaken in his own faith and doc¬ trines.” “It was difficult for him to decide what was best to do, but he doubtless considered it the part of wisdom not to take sides if possible, but to strive to bring back peace and fellowship.” The above is quoted from Reverend Cody’s history. He was the ministerial charge of Mays Lick church, and was for some years its pastor. He must have been personally acquainted with some of the aged members who had known Mr. Warder in his lifetime, and were abie to give facts and reminiscences of the period of growth and also the period of diminution and division. He was on the ground and doubtless availed himself of such sources of information as he could discover. That the most complete story of the life of Rev. Walter Warder may be preserved, the writ¬ er has quoted freely from Mr. Cody’s history, for the History of the Mays Lick Church is his history, so interwoven was his life with that of his beloved church. For any possible unintentional errors or partisan statements of opinion the writer as¬ sumes no responsibility. Especially does he dis¬ claim any reflection upon the character and teachings of that large and respectable body of Christians in Kentucky and other states known as the Disciples of Christ, or Christian Church, and sometimes referred to as the ‘‘Campbellite Church,” because of the leadership of Alexander Campbell. The members of that denomination disclaim the appellation of “Campbellites,” for they deny that he was the founder of their church, but it can not be denied that it has grown and developed to its present numbers and influence by reason of his powerful leadership. However, the writer, judging by present- day standards of courtesy and honorable action, cannot refrain from expressing his opinion that under the circumstances it was in violation of the rules of courtesy, good society, and fair sportsmanship for Alexander CampDell, sailing under the colors of the Baptist church and coming on the invitation of its regular pastor to deliberately attempt, and finally consummate the complete aisruption and division of the Mays Lick Baptist Church. History seems to prove beyond a doubt that he did this very thing. That it may not be thought that the writer has any feeling or antagonism against that denomina¬ tion, at this time, he here states that he knows of several of the descendants of Reverend Wal¬ ter Warder who belong to that faith, and who are faithful and devoted Christians. To further portray the growth of this un¬ happy schism as it affected Mr. Warder and his church, Reverend Cody records as follows: “Mr. Warder was more opposed to the spirit of the so-called Reformation than to its doctrines. In fact, the doctrines were proclaimed with such skillful subtlety and ambiguity that it was dif¬ ficult for a mind of peaceful and unsuspecting mould to detect their true character. The Re¬ formers laid great stress on obedience. Mr. Warder could emphasize even their stress. All his life he had in Christ’s name demanded the fullest submission of the human will to the Di¬ vine. But there was much ambiguity in the way obedience was preached. “Unless you obey you cannot be saved.” A Baptist could say that, for he would mean by it that disobedience was the evidence of an unregenerated heart, and obedience was the fruit, and so the proof of a saved soul. But in all such expressions the Re¬ formers would mean that “You must obey in order to be saved.” Between this and the Bap¬ tist’s meaning a universe rolled — the one is “Live and do,” the other “Do and live.” There was also in their arguments mucn ambiguity i: the meaning of the word “obedience.” To the Baptists it covered the whole of life and was the attitude of the will toward God. The Re¬ formers would hold about the same, but in prac¬ tical fact they narrowed it down to the act of baptism. Baptism and obedience with them be¬ came almost synonymous terms. All general ar¬ guments on obedience to which a Baptist would THE WARDER FAMILY 19 readily assent were by the Reformers referred to immersion. If pressed with the argument that they made salvation depend upon an overt act performed by another upon the candidate tor salvation, they denied it with emphasis. ‘It is not the act, but the obedience in the act.’ Nev¬ ertheless they strongly insisted that no man, however pious, had any assurance of salvation who had not submitted to the act of immersion.’’ “But suppose that one has believed and re¬ formed or repented and the whole heart bowed in obedience to the will of Christ, but the act of immersion has not been administered, then what? The answer was, ‘An! We do not know. There is no promise. He might be saved by the uncovenanted mercies of God. Be immersed. That makes it all certain. You may be right; you may be wrong; we are right, and we can’t be wrong.’ But there was tnis much of cer¬ tainty about it all, they clearly taught that without immersion there was not any promise at all of salvation. Whatever baptism did or did not do, and however much in addition to baptism one must have to be saved, it remain¬ ed an indisputable fact that without baptism there was no ground of hope.’- “Again, the familiar word faith took on a new meaning with Mr. Campbell’s followers. With them, where it was used as the first con¬ dition of salvation, it meant simply the belief of testimony, and when it wras used as the condition it meant faith operative or a faith that went on through baptism. So it could be shown by them that the word ‘works’ was used in various senses, but chiefly they made it refer to the act of baptism.” “These old familiar words, with which Baptists had all their lives been on intimate terms, were used by the Reformers with new meanings. Coming from an accredited preach¬ er of the Baptist Church and a man of Mr. Campbell’s scholarship and ability, it is not strange that the unsuspecting members of this pioneer country church did not at first detect the departure from the true Baptist faith and doctrine. It was early in 1829, recognized by Mr. Warder, their peace-loving pastor, who worked and prayed to avert disunion and di¬ vision of his church of great numbers and wealth and influence, the structure builded by a life-time’s labor, love, and devotion.” “He soon became convinced of the necessi¬ ty of actively opposing the new system. He said that in its very germs there was an ir- reconciliable difference to Baptists principles. The two would not and must not live together. The time for reconciliation had passed. Mr. Warder now threw his whole energies into the fight to hold the lines of the true faith and preserve the auconomy of his organization. In this work he was greatly aided by his life-long friend and co-laborer in Bracken Association, Reverend William Vaughn, an able and forci¬ ble Baptist minister who had just returned from a year’s work in Ohio in 1828 and found the churches of the Association in much confusion and especially the Mays Lick church. It must be lemembered that this was an age of re¬ ligious controversy and debate, especially in northern Kentucky. The debate was a popular method of propaganda, particularly for the Re¬ formers, at that time and for many years there¬ after. They had able and skillful debaters, but the king of them all was Alexander Campbell. Henry Clay, moderator of the celebrated Camp- bell-Rice debate, held in Lexington, Kentucky, said of him: ‘Mr. Campbell is the profoundest theologian and the most eloquent debater of the age.’ These debates, and the prominence and fame of the delegates attracted hoses of inter¬ ested listeners and fanned to white heat the partisans of the contending orators. Fortu¬ nately they are a thing of the past, and denomi¬ native jealousy and antagonism has given peace to Christian fellowship and sympathy. % ‘For modes of grace let graceless zealots fight. He can’t be wrong whose life is in the right.’ This is the spirit of modern-day Christianity. It soon became evidenc that Mr. Campbell with his Re¬ former following was not to gain an easy vic¬ tory. In Walter Warder and William Vaughn, Alexander Campbell found foemen worthy of his steel. Of this he himself bore testimony. Of William Vaughn he said: ‘He was the clearest- ner.ded man in Kentucky.’ Mr. Spencer says in his History of Kentucky Baptists: ‘During an interview with William Vaughn, in Mayville, in 1829. Mr. Campbell said to him: “If you and Walter Warder will join the Reformation, this whole community will go into it’.” Mr. Spencer continues in his book: “Walter Warder was a burning and shining light in his generation. He was contemporary with Wil- 20 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY liam Warder, William Vaughn, Joseph Vardi- mas, and others, a corps of giants who occupied the pulpits of Kentucky at that time.” “The battle was on, and it was to be a fight to the finish. Mr. Warder was a orave, fear¬ less man, and from that hour he threw all his strength against the so-called Reformers. In love and meekness, and in agony of mind he had labored day and night to reclaim his breth¬ ren. He had done all that man could do. But it was too late to stop the tide of rebellion. A goodly number of the leading members had fully accepted the new doctrines imparted to them, and' in the matter of doctrine he had no mote influence over them than any other man. They had caught Alexander Campbell’s spirit, and were proclaiming his views in that confident manner indicating a feeling that all else muct, as a matter of course, give way to doctrine so plainly infallible. They said, ‘Your creeds must give way to our word of God’.” “They resorted to ridicule, especially the doctrine of the operation of the Holy Spirit. Holding up a Bible they would say, ‘WThat is the Holy Spirit? Here is the Holy Spirit. You can buy one for five cents.’ Of course Baptists, hearing the things so near to their hearts ridi¬ culed, retaliated in kind. They derided the claim of the Reformers that their aim was to bring the church back to simple Apostolic Christianity, notwithstanding the fact that very many of the- best of men had gone into the movement from conscientious convictions. When Mr. Warder had become convinced that the cur¬ rents of the Reformation had become too strong for him to check them, he determined that there was but one alternative, the two systems must separate. There was a wide difference in funda¬ mental principles, and there was no possibility of the two living together in peace. It must not be thought that the Reformers sought separa¬ tion, but reformation, which meant absorption of the old faith by the new. They were boring from within. Of all things, they desired dis¬ union the least. Principle and policy carried them to the other side. From first to last they fought separation. They made a distinction be¬ tween faith and opinion in such a way as to place about all the Baptists held as essential un¬ der the head of opinion, and all of their own dis¬ tinctive principles under the head of, faith. They were willing to fellowship Baptists, for they could not see why simply an opinion should be made a cause for separation. If the Baptists could have accepted their distinction, union would have been possible, but they could not be persuaded to relegate to the region of mere opinion what they believed the Bible clearly taught, and they could not fellowship those who denied almoct all they believeu, and tauglu much which they did not believe. “The church determined to stand by its Scriptural and time-honored principles which were being subverted by this new element.” “The powerful sermons of Mr. Warder and Mr. Vaughn were potent forces in organizing and strengthening the adherents of the church, and preserving its integrity. But final separa¬ tion was not to be effected without serious strug¬ gle and dire dissension. Families were divided in every way, father against son, husband against wife, brother against sister, mother against daughter, and it was not certain which party was, in the beginning, in the majority. At this time, when separation was under considera¬ tion, the excitement and confusion reached their highest pitch. They, and in such times ‘they’ means almost everybody, would meet at the church in the morning and stay there till dark¬ ness drove them home. Inside of the house ana out they spoke and talked and argued and dis¬ cussed and debated and disputed and wrangled and quarreled for hours and hours together, and got farther and farther apart. They lost their tempers and lost their heads. Only a few here and there remained sweet and cool, and to these the example was set by their loving pastor.” On June 12th, 1830, Deacon William Allen, at the request of the pastor, moved a peaceable separation. The motion was referred to a com¬ mittee of twenty-five who were to report at the next meeting. The church met again July 10, but the committee could make no report. The Baptists then made this offer to the Reformers: That the church dissolve, and then to organize two new churches out of the membership of the old, according to the views of each party and for the church house, grounds, books, papers, debts, and graveyard to belong equally to each body. The Reformers asked for a few days to consider the proposition, and many of their lead¬ ing men expressed themselves as in favor of ac¬ cepting a proposition so exceedingly liberal. But when the church met again on July 17, the Reformers were solidly opposed to any form of disunion. What was next to be doue? Ex-com- * ' * THE WARDER FAMILY 21 munication was out of the question, peaceable separation had failed, dissolution was impossi¬ ble, and to stand where she was would simply have been the destruction of the Baptist Church.” At this day and age it seems almost unbelievable that otherwise good and intelligent people could have behaved in the manner re¬ corded by the historian, but it must be remem¬ bered that these pioneers had no railroads, no telegraphs, no automobiles, no radio, no moving pictures, and but few newspapers and maga¬ zines. It was more than a century ago and there were few things to break the monotony of their lives. The forensic combats of brilliant and elo¬ quent religious debaters like Alexander Camp¬ bell, and those who with equal combativeness opposed his attacks on their old time faith and doctrine, evidently created great excitement and aroused the spirit of antagonism that shook the whole church to its very foundation. To the better educated it may have furnished a kind of mental stimulus, to the illiterate it perhaps ap¬ pealed to the sporting instinct, in the absence of baseball, golf and our more modern sports and college activities. The story of these struggles is interesting in portraying the life of Walter Warder, show¬ ing the development of his character from that of a gentle, kind, peace-loving disciple to that of a brave, courageous contender and fighter tor the faith of his fathers, and the integrity and life of the church he had so long labored to place at the head of the Baptist churches of his state. His whole life had oeen one of gradual growth and development, and nature and his environment had made him what he was, a man of dramatic experiences, rare ability, and noble qualities. Mr. Warder was determined, with the staunch support of many able members of the church, to make every man show his colors. On the seventh of August, 1830, he prepared and caused to be introduced, a preamble and resolu¬ tion which has since become widely known and which at the time was severely criticized and the wisdom of which was questioned, but time has proved its wisdom and that nothing better could have been done under all the circum¬ stances. I will give the document in full: ‘‘Our church being in a state of painful con¬ fusion, resulting from an attempt by Alexander Campbell and others to produce a reformation in society (as they have been in the habit of calling it), among other things denying the di¬ rect influence of the spirit until baptism; con¬ tending that persons confessing faith in Ctmst shall be baptized for the purpose of actualij re¬ ceiving forgiveness of sins; denying what we call Christian experience, in part at least, viz., a burdened heart on account of sin and a sensi¬ ble manifestation of God’s pardoning mercy by faith in the blood of Christ; slandering the Bap¬ tist society by saying they are in Babylon. Against them we do solemnly protest; also against the conduct of Campbell, Creath, and others, who in May undertook to administer the Lord's Supper in our own meeting house, a num¬ ber of our brethren joining in that thing, with¬ out any authority from the church, some without thinking of the wounds and distress they were to oiing on their brethren. A number of our brothers have been encouraging preachers to occupy our meeting house that many of us be¬ lieve to be Arians, knowing they were trampling on our feelings, which we conceive to be con- *■ trary to good order. We have made every ef¬ fort to place them and us on grounds upon which we might live in some degree of peace, but in vain, and we are now compelled to adopt the following resolutions: “That all of us whose names are hereunto subscribed, protesting as above stated against the reformers, so falsely called, are willing and determined to rally around the original consti¬ tution and covenant of this church which lni. never been disannulled, associating them with the principles of union between Regular and Separate Baptists, which was adopted by the Elkliorn Association when this church was member of that body, and according to which we have acted ever since, which is a fact as re¬ lated to the Baptists generally thereby occupy¬ ing precisely the same ground as we did before this confused and confusing system of things (that has destroyed our peace and the peace of many other churches) came amongst us: That no person shall be considered- a member of this church who refuses to acknowledge the above by subscribing their names or causing them to be subscribed, or who encourages the before named reformation.” The record continues: “And after debate on the subject, the resolution was adopted.” 22 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY “This action was bitterly denounced by the opposition. Those who fought creeds made much of it as a proof that the Baptists demanded subscription to a creed rather than the accept¬ ance of the Bible. This argument was power¬ ful with many. But this was only a temporary expedient to bring about a division of the two systems, and when this was accomplished, the preamble and resolution were annulled, and many of the old members who had not subscrib¬ ed to them, but who agreed with the Baptists, were received into full fellowship again, by sim¬ ply having their names placed upon the roll of the church.” “Whatever might be said of the preamble and resolution, it did what nothing else was able to effect, and what it was intended to do. Three Hundred Eighty-five of the members signed the declaration of faith and allegiance, which then constituted a majority. Many who did not sign it at that time later had their names enrolled. The fight was won and the church was saved. The followers of Mr. Campbell were excluded from church fellowship. But the matter was not finally settled. Bracken Association met in Washington on the first Saturday in September. Both parties from Mays Lick sent delegates and letters to that body, each claiming to be the Baptist Church of Mays Lick.” “The Association recognized the majority, and the minority returned home and with their brethren immediately constituted what they denominated ‘The Church of Jesus Christ at Mays Lick,’ perhaps the first among the churches of Northern Kentucky afterwards, for some jears, to be called in that locality, the ‘Camp- bellite Church,’ to be later known as the ‘Dis¬ ciples or Christian Church,’ as it is called to¬ day.” “The reformation at Mays Lick progressed rapidly. This was the one thing the Reformers feared; it was the one thing the Baptists de¬ sired. Henceforth they were to face each other as separate denominations.” “Notwithstanding the signal victory won by Walter Warder in the preservation of his church, and the faithful and devoted support of so many of his followers, the bitterness of the struggle must have left, to one of such gentle and loving nature, wounds that would take years to heal. Sad memories, never to be forgotten.” “It was truly a sad sight that Zion present¬ ed. Less than a year ago this was the largest church in that state. Among her numbers were many educated, wealthy, influential citizens. Her territory extended to Washington, to Hel¬ ena, to beyond Pisgah, to Sardis. They had lived together in unity, peace, and love. But now they were divided beyond the hope of reconcilia¬ tion. Families were split asunder. Many who had been pillars of the old church were now counted as her enemies. The two churches were about equal in numbers, wealth, education, social position, and piety. Some noble and good men had gone out from the Baptists. Among them were James Morris, who since 17 9 8 had been clerk, Levy Dobyns, Levi Vancamp, Aaron Mitchell, Jasper Shotwell, Asa R. Runyan, and others who had been prominent in all the work of the church. The two churches, however, di¬ vided time in the use of the house until August, 1842. There was considerable friction as to the ownership of the property of the church.” “The Baptists asserted that the Reformeis had no rights in the property of any kind, but expressed willingness to .give them something for what they had paid. The Reformers proceed¬ ed to erect, at considerable cost, a new church building. The Reformers claimed that they hau paid part of the cost of the old building, and that they had rights which the courts would rec¬ ognize. However groundless as a matter of law these claims might be, they refused to settle the matter as a gift from the Baptists. They were about to appeal to the courts to settle their differences, when through the instrumentality of Aaron Mitchell for the Reformers and David Morris for the Baptists, a compromise was ef¬ fected. The Baptists paid the Reformers $1,- 000.00 and they relinquished all their claims; also, the records of the church were to be sub¬ ject to the examination of each church when desired.” “For two years after the split the church was prostrated. Walter Warder continued in ministerial charge, and in 1833 had a revival meeting which added fifty members to the church; it gave encouragement and hope of a return to its old-time prosperity.” After the several years in which the church had been torn by dissensions, and probably by reason of them, the health of Walter Warder had begun to show signs of failing. . . ' THE WARDER FAMILY 23 Unwilling to accept his resignation, the church called Reverend William Vaughn to aid and alternate with him in holding the regular services. This arrangement was most accepta¬ ble to Mr. Warder. They had been co-workers and bosom friends for more than twenty years. There would be no friction between them. Both able and eminent, they united their efforts to rebuild the walls of Zion. In the spring of 183 6 Mr. Warder went on a journey to Missouri to visit his brother, Rever¬ end John Warder, where he suffered an acute at¬ tack of pneumonia from which he died. He was buried in Missouri, but so dear was his memory that in 1S4 3 the church caused his remains to be brought back and interred where his conse- ciated life had been spent. He was buried in the Mays Lick Baptist cemetery upon the very site of the old church where he had preached his first sermon in the pioneer days of his pastorate. Everybody had loved and reverenced him. His life had been a benediction to thousands. On tiie spot on which had stood his pulpit, his con¬ gregation erected to his memory a notable and peimanent monument bearing the following in¬ scription: “Walter Warder was born in the State of Virginia, December 13th, 1787, and died in the State of Missouri, while on a visit, April 6, 1836. “His remains were removed to this place and this Monument erected to his memory by the Baptist Church, A. D. 1S44.’’ On the reverse side of the Monument ap¬ pear these words: “In memory of Elder Walter Warder, who departed this life, April 6th, 1836, in the 4 9 tii year of his age.’’ “He was Pastor of the Baptist Church of Mays Lick twenty-two years previous to his death, beloved and respected by the people of his Church: In life and in death a Christian.” On a horizontal stone tablet lying alongside the above monument are inscribed the words: “In Memory of Alary Warder, wife of Rev. Walter Warder, who departed this life, October 21st, 1829, aged 43 years, 6 months and 8 days.” It is interesting to know that this monument stands on the site of the old church and over the very spot on which stood the old pulpit in which he had proclaimed the Gospel for so many years. It is a source of fregret to the writer that he can add but little to the facts above given of the life of Reverend Walter Warder. Nearly one hundred years have elapsed since his death. His contemporaries have long since passed away. His descendants are widely scattered. But lLtle has come down to us at the present day, either by history or tradition, other than the well au¬ thenticated record of his public life as a minister of the Gospel. This I have endeavored to pre¬ sent in this biographical sketch as fully and truly as circumstances would admit. As to his personality, his habits of life, his home sur¬ roundings, his family ties, his daily pursuits, his social recreations, his literary tastes, his politcal affiliations, his early struggles for a competency and the acquisition of material independence and fortune, all these are subjects on which I have been able to find little accurate informa¬ tion. My parents moved from Maysville, Mason Go., Ky., the place of my birth, in 1851, more than fifteen years after the death of my grand¬ father, Walter Warder. From infancy I was removed from the atmosphere and surround¬ ings in which he had spent his life. My par¬ ents moved to southern Illinois, where I spent the early years of my life. The country was then new, and much of it was still a wilder¬ ness. The struggle of the pioneers to clear away the brush and to found a home was so intensive and so engrossed their thoughts and and energies that they had little time to spend looking up the history of their ances¬ tors or keeping alive the family traditions. These hardy pioneers were rather looking for¬ ward to what they and their descendants were to accomplish in the future than to treasuring up and perpetuating the story of what their ancestors had been doing in the past. How¬ ever reprehensible that state of mind appears to us now, in these modern times when desira¬ ble ancestors are much sought after, it was their psychology. In view of the success they made in the building of a great state and the imprint they left in the history of Illinois it is not for us to severely criticize their philosophy of life. It has been stated heretofore that Walter Warder married Mary Maddox in Barren Coun¬ ty, Kentucky, in 1808. She was a daughter 24 HISTORY AND GENEALOGY of Samuel Maddox, a substantial citizen of Glas¬ gow. She is said to have been a devoted and exemplary wife and mother. They were the parents of a large family of children. Their education received the careful attention of both father and mother as the opportunities were near at hand. In the neigh¬ boring town of Washington were the best of schools, conducted by noted educators. His¬ torian Collins tells us that Mason County rank¬ ed first in the state in schools and educational institutions. Twelve children in all were born to them, several of whom died in infancy. Of those reaching maturity there wei'e three sons and three daughters. The sons were Joseph, William, and Walter; the daughters, Emily, Louann, and Mary Esther. Joseph, the eldest, married Ann Kirkham, a daughter of Captain Thomas Kirkham, and in 1851 emigrated to Johnson County, Illinois. Her father was in command of a company of Mississippi artillery and was with General Andrew Jackson at the battle of New Orleans. Joseph Warder and Ann Kirkham were the parents of the writer. William, the second son, married Miss Ar- tus, a daughter of Janies Artus, a wealthy mer¬ chant and leading citizen of Maysville, Ken¬ tucky. They removed in the fifties to Chicago, and for many years were associated with Mr. Honore, the father of Mrs. Polter Palmer, in the real estate business. The third son, Dr. Walter Warder, a successful and popular phy¬ sician, married a Miss Artus, daughter of James Artus, and a sister of the wife of his brother, William H. Warder. His home was in Mays¬ ville. He died some time in the forties, before reaching old age. Of the three daughters, the eldest, Louann, married Horace Anderson and they settled in Clay County, Missouri; the second daughter, Emily, married John Morris, and they also re¬ moved to Missouri; the third daughter, Mary Esther, married David Runyan. They first re¬ sided in Maysville, but afterwards removed to New York City, where for many years Mr. Run¬ yan was associated with the firm of Lord and Taylor, a well-known and extensive mercaniile house, Mr. Runyan acting as the European agent and buyer for the company. They had no chil¬ dren. All of the other five children of Walter Warder left families, and their descendants are numerous and widely scattered. Further on in these notes the author will give a more or less complete genealogical record of this branch of the Warders, gathered with much care and la¬ bor from the original sources of information. So far as the writer has learned, they have near¬ ly all enjoyed college or university educations, and have achieved success in life and honorable position in society. Some of them have won honors and distinctions in public positions ana in patriotic service, of which the writer will treat more fully hereafter under other heads. There is little more the writer can add to the story of ihe unusually interesting, beautiful, and successful life of Rev. Walter Warder. Tradition tells us that notwithstanding his unselfish and untiring devotion to his ministerial labors, he was a man successful in the business and ma¬ terial affairs of life. He early acquired title to a considerable holding in the rich blue grass section of Mason County, which together with the rapid growth and development of this new country made possible the rapid accumulation of wealth. With thrift and good management, a dignified and hospitable home in keeping with the style of the times and the custom of his wealthy neighbors and like them, he became the owner of slaves for ihe cultivation of his estate. After the death of his wife, Mary Maddox, who had faithfully and efficiently aided him in all his undertakings, he was married to Mrs. Eliza¬ beth Dobyns, the widow of Lervy Dab'yns, both of whom had long been members of his church. She was also well-to-do, the owner of land and slaves. How many slaves they owned is not known, tut I know that my father, Joseph Warder, inherited some slaves and blooded horses as his share in the distribution of his father’s estate. Owing to my mother’s life-long opposition to the institution of slavery, my father soon parted with his slaves and ceased to be a slave-holder, much to the gratification of my mother. That the slave owners of north¬ ern Kentucky were universally kind and hu¬ mane to their slaves is a matter of history and general acceptation. I visited Mays Lick last summer and stood at my grandfather’s grave and read the inscrip¬ tions, still quite plainly readable on his monu¬ ment, now almost one hundred years old. It stands in the neat and well-kept little cemetery where each “in his narrow tomb, the rude fore¬ fathers of the hamlet lie.” . * . ■ ' I re / THE WARDER FAMILY 25 Mays Lick is now a small village, and the rival churches still stand, but the salt springs have almost disappeared, and much of its past glory has departed, but the great pastoral work of Walter Warder, the preaching of Alexander Campbell, and the battle of the churches have given it a substantial and permanent place in the history of Kentucky. Oh, Kentucky! Beautiful land of the blue grass, home of the Indian fighters and incon- querable pioneers, home of eloquent preachers, lawyers, orators, statesmen, poets, and soldiers, noted the world over, it is with pride and af¬ fection that I have attempted, however imper¬ fectly, to leave to posterity this tribute to the memory of one of your best and noblest sons, the Reverend Walter Warder of Mays Lick.
