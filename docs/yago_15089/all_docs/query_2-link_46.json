        "text": "Prison warder Joseph Zammit, who was accused of sexually abusing two underage inmates at the juvenile prison in 2018, has had charges lifted after his acquittal was confirmed.\n\nAs reported by the Times of Malta, the 52-year-old man was assigned to carry out maintenance works in the youth section. In November 2022, he was charged with sexually abusing and raping a 15-year-old female inmate after her comments to a fellow inmate triggered an internal inquiry.\n\nShe claimed that the warder would comment about her figure while she was showering, had oral six with him six or seven times, and was raped inside a washroom.\n\nAnother alleged victim claimed the warder had commented abut her breasts and show up while she was in the shower.\n\nHowever, Judge Consuleo Scerri Herrera flagged inconsistencies in the accounts given by the two victims and warned that the prosecution was unsuccessful in proving its case since no evidence of the footage was produced, rendering the minors not credible. She pointed out that a camera had been placed close to the washroom where the alleged rape took place, but the prosecution didn’t preserve the footage and present it as evidence.\n\nShe also observed that one of the minors had threatened male officers that she “would do to them like she had done to Zammit”, indicating that she had known her allegations were untrue.\n\nShe therefore agreed with a first court’s conclusion that the prosecution didn’t manage to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the minors weren’t credible.\n\nLawyers Franco Debono and Herman Mula represented Zammit."
