WOODS\n\nGrand High Priest, R.A.M. 1897 Grand Master R.& S.M. 1910-1911 General Grand Master, General Grand Council, 1933-1936\n\nRobert A. Woods was referred to as \"the incomparable Bob Woods, beloved patriarch of Indiana Masonry.\"\n\nAnd indeed he was. He left in his wake an exceptional record of Masonic labor that extended over a span of 74 years. Those who knew him revered him; they have said, and probably did say, at his passing, \"We shall not look upon his like again.\"\n\nA native Hoosier, and inordinately proud of it, Robert Archer Woods was born January 5, 1861 on a farm near Princeton, son of John B. and Lucilla Charlette (Archer) Woods, both of whom had pioneer ancestors dating back to colonial days and the American Revolution.\n\nAfter graduating from Princeton High School in 1877, he entered Indiana University, receiving his bachelor of science degree in chemistry in 1881. His alma mater conferred upon him the honorary master of arts degree"
