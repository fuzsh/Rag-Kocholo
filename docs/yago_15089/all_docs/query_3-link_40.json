They are here to help the citizens of Texas with an integrated team of professionals.\n\nFrom well-trained helicopter pilots to K-9 teams to sonar-equipped dive teams, they risk their lives to protect others. From swift water rescue boats to helicopter hoists, there is no value that can be placed upon losing a human life.\n\nYour Texas Game Wardens strive to maintain funding levels to have an appropriate response to persons in need in Texas."
