        "text": "“But while Joseph was there in the prison, the LORD was with him.” Genesis 39:20-21\n\nGenesis, the first book of the Bible, closes with the harrowing account of the second youngest son of Jacob, the patriarch renamed Israel.\n\nJoseph suffered at the hands of his brothers, his masters, and his friends. His pride made his brothers so angry they decided to kill him. While they stopped short of murder, Joseph was consequently beaten, tossed in a pit, and sold into slavery.\n\nWhen he was a stranger in a far away land, he was set up by a beautiful woman and tossed in a cell for trying to do the right thing.\n\nIn prison, he earned the trust of the guards and other prisoners. But despite his good nature and helpful attitude, Joseph was forgotten by all when he needed them most.\n\nJOSEPH’S RESTORATION\n\nThroughout Joseph’s life however, he never lost sight of the One who was in control of it all. Eventually, we see God had a plan for Joseph. There was a rhyme and a reason for his wandering, abuse, slavery, imprisonment and, eventually, his redemption.\n\nIt is easy to lose sight of the plans God has for all of us. When times are hard and the world seems to be set against us, it is helpful to remember Joseph’s words to the brothers that turned on their own family with murder in their hearts. Joseph reminds them what they meant for evil against him God intended for good (Gen. 50:20)."
