        "text": "FOX 25 is continuing its investigation into questions surrounding the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.\n\nA former warden came forward, detailing his experience after he said he was fired \"out of the blue.\" He then took ODOC to court.\n\nGarner Pettigrew explained that he was a dedicated employee with the department for 22 years and ran the cleanest facility in the state. Then, on Mar. 7, his life's career got turned upside down.\n\nBefore his termination, he was the head of the Joseph Harp Correctional Center in Lexington.\n\n\"Out of the blue one day on a Tuesday, my superior walked in and... said, 'This is one of these days nobody likes,\" recalled Pettigrew.\n\nRELATED |\n\nHe received an official termination letter, but he asserted it lacked details supporting any justification for his termination.\n\nCourt records show the reasons behind his firing were for, \"the good of the service\" and a rules of conduct violation. FOX 25 was unable to determine exactly conduct violation the court filing referenced after examining the cited document.\n\nAccording to the former warden, \"It still devastates me. You know, at my age, I, I need retirement. And... you know, it's just, it's just been really hard.\"\n\nRecords show that Administrative Law Judge Lexie P. Norwood ruled in Pettigrew's favor after he took ODOC to court to contest his firing.\n\nThe final order from the civil service division asserted that, \"that there was no reasonable basis for Appellant’s termination,\" and that Pettigrew, \"is to be hereby reinstated with back pay and benefits, and his personnel file shall be expunged of the Termination Letter.\"\n\nHowever, according to Pettigrew, ODOC is fighting the ruling in district court— and he hasn't received a cent yet.\n\n\"I've given my life to department of corrections. I made that choice in 1989, to make that my career. Lacked one year from retiring and they come in an terminated me. And to this date, they still haven't told me why they terminated me,\" he added.\n\nRELATED |\n\nOne relevant question to the case concerns whether Pettigrew was a part of the 5 percent of employees not covered by state law that prevents at-will civil service termination.\n\nAccording to an ODOC spokeswoman, \"We feel comfortable in our position that he is a 5% employee.\"\n\nPettigrew is disputing ODOC's characterization of his employment status, telling FOX 25 that he was never informed of his inclusion in the 5 percent category until it came up in court.\n\n\"They expect for their employees to follow policy and procedure. In my case they didn't follow their own policy and procedure, and still not,\" argued the former warden.\n\nWas this the last straw for Pettigrew after a series of missteps at work? According to him, it was not.\n\nHe asserted that he never received any formal discipline in his entire ODOC career, and only ever had a minor informal disciplinary notice sent to him in Aug. of 2022.\n\nPettigrew explained that he had the option to resign instead of being fired, but he chose firing over admitting he had done anything wrong.\n\nHe said he's on standby until a district court takes up the department's appeal, which he believes could take months— or even years— due to a case backlog stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic."
