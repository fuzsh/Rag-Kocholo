After he is seen taking out the garbage, 28-year old Jerry Bricca returns to his residence, where he lives with his 23-year old wife, Linda, and their four-year old daughter, Debbie. Two days later, the entire family is found murdered, as they have each been stabbed to death inside their respective bedrooms. Police begin to suspect Fred Leininger, a local veterinarian whom Linda had recently started working for and was rumoured to be having an affair with, but there is not enough evidence to implicate him and no one is ever charged with the crime. On this week’s episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we explore the disturbing story of the Bricca Family Murders, which has remained unsolved for nearly 60 years.\n\nIf you have information about this case, please contact the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office Criminal Investigation Section at (513) 851-6000.\n\nSpecial thanks to Factor sponsoring this episode.

Daviess County, Kentucky. The nude body of a white male who appears to be in his thirties is found in a remote wooded area. The victim has been shot and severely beaten and his hands and feet were removed, but since he cannot be identified, he becomes known as the “Daviess County John Doe”. Seventeen years later, investigators announce that the victim has been identified as Scott Morris, a 14-year old boy who went missing from Indianapolis, Indiana in 1978, but this turns out to be mistake, as DNA testing later shows that the decedent has no genetic connection to Scott’s family. Finally, in April 2024, the Daviess County John Doe is correctly identified as William Mathews, a former Louisville resident who was 37 years old at the time of his death, but his murder remains unsolved. On this week’s episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we explore two separate unsolved cold cases which wound up being linked together in a very unlikely fashion.\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nhttps://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/William_Mathews\n\nhttps://www.doenetwork.org/cases/133umky.html\n\nhttps://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_6f162764-e767-11e4-a441-8bdf44f3238c.html\n\nhttps://www.14news.com/story/1753449/stefanie-silvey-investigates-alleged-murders-of-james-cable/\n\nhttps://transdoetaskforce.org/index.php/articles/case-solve-owensboro-ky-doe-1990\n\nhttps://fox56news.com/news/kentucky/victim-in-34-year-old-daviess-county-cold-case-identified/\n\nhttps://www.wdrb.com/news/crime-reports/37-year-old-louisville-man-identified-as-victim-in-1990-daviess-county-cold-case-ksp/article_b6f1ee08-fea3-11ee-a482-4bfd956cc402.html\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/scott-michael-morris\n\nhttps://www.14news.com/story/7059575/brutally-murdered-john-doe-identified/\n\nhttps://www.14news.com/story/7077566/family-prepares-to-bring-home-body-of-murdered-man/\n\nhttps://www.14news.com/story/145375/unsolved-murder-unidentified-man/\n\n“The Trail Went Cold” is on Patreon.

Toronto, Ontario. 32-year old Turkish immigrant Hatice Corbacioglu leaves on a road trip to New York in order to meet her 28-year old Turkish boyfriend, Riza Cosa, with whom she has been carrying on a long-distance relationship for six months. Hatice never returns and breaks off all contact with her family, but Riza claims that she left on a flight to Turkey. However, it eventually comes out that Riza is already married and his 45-year old wife, Winsome Angela Perez, has also gone missing. In May 2010, Winsome’s murdered body is discovered behind Riza’s former workplace and within days, it is announced that Riza has taken his own life in Turkey and no trace of Hatice can be found. On this week’s episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we cover the bizarre story of a Canadian citizen who went missing on American soil after becoming involved with a married man.\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nhttps://disappearedblog.com/hatice-corbacioglu/\n\nhttps://torontosun.com/news/local-news/police-hope-for-new-information-in-missing-woman-case\n\nhttps://toronto.ctvnews.ca/family-suspects-missing-woman-met-with-foul-play-1.514415\n\nhttps://www.thestar.com/news/gta/family-hopes-for-leads-on-missing-woman/article_2f516e9c-d0ab-574a-95f6-2eb972f3158c.html\n\nhttps://www.thestar.com/news/crime/missing-toronto-woman-s-boyfriend-kills-self-in-turkey/article_29b8e1d3-cc52-5e14-ad0a-db0e343ac011.html\n\nhttps://www.newsday.com/long-island/crime/hicksville-woman-s-remains-identified-husband-sought-w87768\n\nhttps://www.newsday.com/long-island/crime/global-search-for-slain-hicksville-woman-s-husband-o73447\n\nhttps://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/hatice-corbacioglu-planned-to-marry-riza-cosa-family-says-y05036\n\nhttps://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/cops-man-suspected-in-wife-s-death-may-have-killed-himself-w18129\n\nhttps://abc7ny.com/archive/7453929/\n\nIf you have any information about this case, please contact the Toronto Crime Stoppers tip line at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)\n\n“The Trail Went Cold” is on Patreon.

Pierrefonds, Quebec. 42-year old Janet Kuchinsky leaves her residence in order to go out for a walk, but never returns. The following morning, Janet’s body is found in a wooded area next to a bicycle path located one kilometre from her home and she has been bludgeoned to death by a blunt instrument. Months later, a serial killer named William Patrick Fyfe is charged with the murders of a number of other women which also happened to occur in the West Island region of Montreal during this time period, but no evidence links him to Janet’s death and the crime is never solved.\n\nApril 29, 1996. Senneville, Quebec. 51-year old Andre Lalonde, a veteran constable with the Montreal Urban Community Police, pulls over a Ford Tempo with a noisy muffler for a seemingly routine traffic stop before he is fatally shot by the driver. It turns out the vehicle was stolen and it is later found abandoned in an industrial section of Montreal after having been set on fire. There is speculation that in the weeks prior to Lalonde’s murder, the Tempo may have been used during a series of bank robberies, but while investigators believe they have a potential suspect in the shooting, they lack the evidence to file charges.\n\nOn this week’s episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we travel back to our home country of Canada to explore a pair of unsolved murders which took place in the West Island of Montreal.

Charles Mix County, South Dakota. After an all-night partying spree, 20-year old Arnold Archambeau, Arnold’s 18-year old spouse, Ruby Bruguier, and Ruby’s 17-year old cousin, Tracy Dion, get into a car accident and roll over into a frozen ditch. By the time help arrives at the scene, Tracy is still trapped inside the car, but Arnold and Ruby have disappeared. Three months later, Arnold and Ruby’s bodies are found submerged in water in the ditch over 75 feet away from the accident scene and their cause of death is determined to be exposure. However, the investigation turns up some odd discrepancies to suggest that Arnold and Ruby may have still been alive during the three-month window they were missing before their bodies were brought back to the ditch and placed there by an unknown party. Did the couple actually die of exposure on the same morning of the accident or did something else happen? On this week’s episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we explore a bizarre unexplained death case which was featured on “Unsolved Mysteries”.\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_of_Arnold_Archambeau_and_Ruby_Bruguier\n\nhttps://unsolved.com/gallery/arnold-archambeau-ruby-bruguier/\n\nhttps://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Arnold_Archambeau_and_Ruby_Bruguier\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/239872047/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/239936120/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/239873722/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/240264744/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/527815632/\n\nhttps://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/area-sheriff-leaves-office-after-28-years\n\n“The Trail Went Cold” is on Patreon.

Denver, Colorado. An armed gunman commits a robbery from the underground vault at the United Bank Tower on Father’s Day and makes off with $197,000 in cash. While the six employees from the vault are allowed to live, the assailant fatally shoots four guards: 41-year old Phillip Mankoff, 21-year old Todd Wilson, 33-year old William McCullom Jr. and 21-year old Scott McCarthy. Two-and-a-half weeks later, a 54-year old retired police officer named James King, who once worked as a guard at United Bank, is arrested and charged with the robbery and the murders. However, since the stolen money is never recovered and no physical evidence links King to the crime, the case against him is very circumstantial and King is acquitted of all charges at trial. Was James King actually responsible for this crime or did law enforcement allow the real perpetrator to get away with it? On this week’s episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we explore a controversial unsolved bank robbery/quadruple homicide which has become known as “The Father’s Day Bank Massacre”.\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%27s_Day_Bank_Massacre\n\n“Murders in the Bank Vault: The Father’s Day Massacre and the Trial of James King” by Walter Gerash and Phil Goodstein\n\nhttps://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/17/Murderous-robber-had-detailed-knowledge-of-bank/5477677131200/\n\nhttp://blogs.denverpost.com/crime/2011/06/29/denvers-fathers-day-massacre-20-years-later/307/\n\nhttps://www.denverpost.com/2013/06/10/james-king-key-figure-in-mystery-of-denver-fathers-day-massacre-dies/\n\nhttps://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/denver7-archive-inside-the-investigation-into-the-colorado-fathers-day-bank-massacre\n\nhttps://torontosun.com/news/world/crime-hunter-fathers-day-massacre-still-vexes-cops\n\n“The Trail Went Cold” is on Patreon.

Anadarko, Oklahoma. 61-year old pastor Carol Daniels drives from her home in Oklahoma City to the Worthy Temple Christ Holy Sanctified Church in order to perform her Sunday morning duties there, but less than two hours after her arrival, Carol is murdered. She has been stripped naked, stabbed several times, and had a dissolving chemical sprayed over her body in an apparent attempt to destroy DNA evidence, but no one can figure out the motive for this crime. Nearly eight years later, investigators announce that a deceased criminal named Denise Kay Cooper and another suspect may have been responsible for Carol’s murder, but even though evidence is presented to a grand jury, no charges are filed. On this week’s episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we explore the unsolved murder of Reverend Carol Daniels, one of the most shocking and brutal crimes ever featured on this podcast.\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna32566988\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/01/oklahoma.pastor.killing/index.html\n\nhttps://www.news9.com/story/5e35b63d83eff40362bf1103/man-claims-he-saw-murder-suspect-fleeing-anadarko-church\n\nhttps://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/columns/2017/03/30/the-morning-brew-anadarko-cold-case-under-grand-jury-scrutiny/60609650007/\n\nhttps://www.oklahoman.com/article/3461176/completed-autopsy-report-released-in-anadarko-pastors-death\n\nhttps://www.theodysseyonline.com/gods-razor-of-judgment\n\nhttps://www.news9.com/story/5e3349b71290151d52141e1a/9-years-later-evidence-revealed-in-the-murder-of-pastor-carol-daniels\n\nhttps://kfor.com/news/grand-jury-looking-into-brutal-unsolved-murder-of-anadarko-pastor/\n\nhttps://www.swoknews.com/news/11-years-a-mystery-the-violent-murder-of-rev-carol-daniels/article_5b9896ad-5eef-5d45-899b-19a981056d6f.html\n\n“The Trail Went Cold” is on Patreon.

Investigators eventually come to believe that Edyth and Nicholas were the victims of foul play, but no suspects are named and the case is never solved.\n\nOn this week’s episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we explore two unsolved missing persons cases in which a mother and son disappeared together.\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nhttps://unsolved.com/gallery/cecilia-newball-rene-perez/\n\nhttps://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Cecilia_Newball_and_Rene_Perez_Jr.\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/cecilia-elizabeth-newball\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/rene-perez-jr\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-09-29-me-44410-story.html\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130718060712/http://www.lacountymurders.com/wanted/099-00062-3199-011.pdf\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/edyth-ann-warner\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/nicholas-vincent-smith\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-10-30-vw-653-story.html\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/431536244/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/997619150/\n\n“The Trail Went Cold” is on Patreon.

Palmyra, Pennsylvania. After spending the evening at a bar, 21-year old Kortne Stouffer returns to her apartment building alongside a male friend named Cody Pruett, but gets into a confrontation with her neighbours. The police are called to the scene and manage to de-escalate the situation, so Kortne goes into her apartment with Cody. When Cody wakes up later that morning, he claims that Kortne has vanished without explanation and she has left her car and all of her personal belongings behind. Investigators explore a number of different leads, but can find no evidence of foul play or any strong suspects, so Kortne’s disappearance remains unsolved. On this week’s episode of “The Trail Went Cold”, we explore a bizarre case about a young woman who seemingly vanished from her apartment in the middle of the night. Special thanks to listener Becki Routsong for narrating the opening of this episode.\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/kortne-ciera-stouffer\n\nhttps://www.pennlive.com/topic/kortne-stouffer/posts.html\n\nhttps://www.pennlive.com/midstate/2012/08/kortne_stouffer_disappeared_am.html\n\nhttps://www.wgal.com/article/disappearance-of-kortne-stouffer-palmyra-pennsylvania/40680399\n\nhttps://www.wgal.com/article/timeline-for-disappearance-of-kortne-stouffer-palmyra-pennsylvania/40690263\n\nhttps://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/kortne-stouffer/\n\nhttps://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/lebanon-county/family-of-kortne-stouffer-look-for-answers-11-years-cold-case/521-0f80fc96-c646-42aa-99f7-c5dc8c12c98b\n\nhttps://www.abc27.com/local-news/kortne-stouffer-remains-missing-after-11-years-family-hosts-annual-float-event/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/995947179/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/995947204/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/995958181/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/995958172/\n\n“The Trail Went Cold” is on Patreon.
