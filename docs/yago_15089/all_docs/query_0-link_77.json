        "text": "Vice presidential hopeful Joe Biden made a campaign stop in Jeffersonville on Sept. 24.\n\nBiden told a crowd of 2,300 supporters at Warder Park that GOP presidential nominee John McCain is “flat out of touch” and out of tune with the needs of the middle class.\n\n“Eight to ten thousand people per day are going into foreclosure. These foreclosures are more than an economic crisis for these people, they are an emotional crisis,” Biden said.\n\n“It means turning to your son or daughter and saying, ‘you’ve got to empty the bedroom, honey.’ It means you can’t come back to the neighborhood. You can’t play in the same ball club. The middle class is under siege and we will end that siege,” he said.\n\nA vote for McCain is a vote for the failed policies of George W. Bush, Biden continued.\n\n“Eight years ago the Republican nominee claimed he wasn’t a typical Republican, claimed he was a reformer. He said he’d bring honor back to the White House,” Biden said of President George W. Bush.\n\n“Now, eight years later, we have another man telling us he’s different. We’ve seen this movie before, and the sequel is always worse than the original,” he said.\n\nSteve Stenbro of Jeffersonville came to the rally to show his support for the Democratic campaign.\n\n“I like Biden a lot, he has a lot of good points,” Stenbro said. “He covered an immense amount of ground in that speech. I’m hoping he gets a little more aggressive in the future, though.”\n\nSharon Scott of Louisville came out with her one year old son, Maxwell, to hear the vice presidential candidate’s take on the issues.\n\n“I’ve been a big Obama supporter since the beginning. I’m really excited for Joe Biden to take center stage and step into the spotlight nationally,” Scott said.\n\nScott said she’s excited to see Biden take on Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the upcoming debate.\n\n“Even though Joe hasn’t enlivened the Obama ticket the way Palin has for McCain, Biden has so much more experience. He’ll shine in the debates,” Scott said."
