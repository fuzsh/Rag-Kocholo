Through our secure website, you can make a donation to one fund or several.\n\nMany of our donors choose to make gifts to the Community Foundation’s Community Impact Fund. Your gift to this permanent fund will allow the Foundation to support the most pressing needs in our community and is the best way to make a general donation in support of the Foundation.\n\nIf you have questions about making a gift to CFSI or a particular fund, contact Linda Speed at (812) 948-4662 or e-mail her at lspeed@cfsouthernindiana.com.\n\n(* If you are interested in giving a gift to our $2-for-$1 match for the Lilly Endowment’s GIFT VIII initiative, please select ‘Community Impact Fund’ below.)"
