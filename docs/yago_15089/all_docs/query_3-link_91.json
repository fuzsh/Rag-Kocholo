Dublin, Ireland. 1832–1902.\n\nThe 1841 revelation regarding the Nauvoo temple and Nauvoo House instructed the Saints “that your anointings and your washings, and your babtisms for the dead and your solemn assemblys, and your memorials for your sacrifices, by the sons of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places, wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes, and judgements, for the beginning of the revelations and foundation of Zion, and for the glory and honor and endowment of all her municiples, are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are allways Commanded to build unto my holy name.” (Revelation, 19 Jan. 1841 [D&C 124:39], underlining in original.)\n\nBennett commenced his public campaign against JS and the church in July 1842 with several letters to the Sangamo Journal. He eventually compiled those letters in an 1842 book titled The History of the Saints. (See Bennett’s letters printed in the 8, 15, and 22 July, 19 August, and 2 September 1842 issues of the Sangamo Journal; and John C. Bennett, The History of the Saints; or, An Exposé of Joe Smith and Mormonism [Boston: Leland and Whiting, 1842].)\n\nSangamo Journal. Springfield, IL. 1831–1847.\n\nBennett, John C. The History of the Saints; or, an Exposé of Joe Smith and Mormonism. Boston: Leland and Whiting, 1842.\n\nIn August 1842, the editors of the New York Herald used the phrase “secret system of wives” in reference to Bennett’s claims about JS practicing polygamy, and that article was reprinted in Bennett’s The History of the Saints. JS and other close associates viewed his plural marriages—which involved formal proposals to the women and religious ceremonies with witnesses—as fundamentally different from Bennett’s promiscuous behavior and from the claims Bennett was making about him. (Bennett, History of the Saints, 54; Historical Introduction to Letter to the Church and Others, 23 June 1842.)\n\nBennett, John C.
