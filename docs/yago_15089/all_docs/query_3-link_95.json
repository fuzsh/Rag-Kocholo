        "text": "Hi Hilary,\n\nI just wanted to let you know that I came across some more history pertaining to your family when I was looking at a history of Eastnor recently http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=6014http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=6014. I also found on a document from Bruce County, a notice for Richard Tackaberry's marriage. It would appear that he may have been the first or one of the first people married in the Lion's Head and Eastnor areas.Finally, there is a reference to Nathaniel or it appears to be Nathaniel in the book of Eastnor having been the first person buried near where the current cemetery is located.This is interesting because I remember that story being told to me when I was young by my grandfather Warder (although I don't think he said or knew who the person was).You can find it in the section on the cemetery in this book.\n\nThis book indicates that in 1868 (same date as is indicated in my grandfather's history documenting the arrival of Nathaniel in - Between You and Me and the Gatepost)Nathaniel Tackaberry came into the Eastnor area south of Astrop's hill (highest point of land)and what would become known as Tackaberry Corners the hub of the area, as per my understanding.The date is documented because Nathaniel and his family (persumably including Richard) spent the night at Joseph Waugh's home at Hope Bay (I'm decended from Joseph on my paternal grandmother's side of the family, I think he is my great-great-great-grandfather) the first pioneer to live in Eastnor Township in 1866. Nathaniel appears to be the first person in Eastnor in the area around Lion's Head as my Grandfather's book indicated.Sometime shortly after, Richard appears to have secured 400 acres of land part of which consitutes much of what is now Lion's Head.I don't think that Richard owned this land when the family first came to Eastnor (although I can't be sure without finding a deed on the land)but may have been setup by his father on this parcel of land a couple of years later (Richard was only 18 years old when the family arrived and I'm assuming that because his father had been a successful merchant in Listowel and possibly other areas, had enough money to purchase this large amount of land for him).Richard's brother was John Tackaberry the father of Dr. William Tackaberry who was my dentist, as I indicated previously. John was only a very young child or baby when the family arrived, as the Waugh family remembers him and this is recorded.As well, the family may have had as many as 4 children with them when they arrived in the area or shortly afterward because I have found the names Richard, Thomas, John and Elizabeth in documents pointing back to Nathaniel.As Nathaniel is known to have had a very large family, there could have been others.I believe Elizabeth married a McMasters another prominent early pioneer family and I'm not sure what happened to Thomas. Richard's family is documented in this history of Eastnor and it shows reasonable detail as to his descendants including your line of the family - near the back of the book.John was a very prominent business man who went on to make his mark in a number of different ventures.\n\nThe Tackaberry family were very prominent in the area in the early days and I think it is safe to say that along with Frank Stuart and George Moore, Richard Tackaberry can be considered one of the founders and fathers of Lion's Head. The stone Tackaberry homestead, still largest in Lion's Head, Frank Stuart's home which was the first brick home in Lion's Head (now in the Warder family and for many years my grandfather's home)and the George Moore home, the oldest house in Lion's Head are testaments to these three great pioneers.\n\nIt amazes me to read about the resourcefulness and hard work of these early pioneers and their families.I wish I could go back for a short time to see the establishment of Tackaberry Corners, the founding of Lion's Head with the severing of lots by Richard Tackaberry, Frank Stuart and George Moore, as well as the establishment of the early dry goods stores by Frank Stuart, the Moore's, Richard Tackaberry and Richard's sons - John Nathaniel (John N) and Ernie (REW or Richard Ernie) Tackaberry.\n\nHope you find all this interesting! The book on Eastnor is a great resource not only for our families but in understanding the early life of the area and many of the other prominent pioneer families as well.\n\nKind regards,\n\nBrian\n\nP.S. - One of John N sons, Clinton, married a school teacher by the name of Beatrice Clements.Beatrice taught my uncle - Maitland Warder, in high school.My uncle wrote several books of history relating to the Lion's Head area and one of them he dedicated to her in recognition of her important contribution to his education. It is fitting that the Tackaberry name is remembered in relation to education as the first two schools in the Lion's Head area were on or beside Nathaniel's property (1st) and on Richard's farm going out of Lion's Head, near where the Missionary church now stands."
