        "text": "Edward E. Longbons, the first president of the Bank of Marion in 1937, was born on May 18, 1869 near Albion in Edwards County, Illinois, the son of Thomas Longbons and Mary Jane Colyer Longbons. His mother was the daughter of Edward Colyer (1795-1858) and Jane Thread Colyer (1792-1860).She was born May 10, 1828 in Albion and died there Jul 24, 1895. Thomas, his father, was born on February 21, 1834 in Nottinghamshire, England and died in 1910 in Albion, Edwards County, Illinois. Thomas and Jane had at least nine children andEdward appears to have had a twin sister, Eliza.\n\nIn the 1870 census Thomas was listed as a farmer, living in Albion and born in England. Both he and his wife’s parents were born in England. He claimed $5,100 in real estate and $1,925 in personal property. Edward, listed as Edwin, was one year old. Ten years later, in 1880, Thomas was still a farmer living in Albion.\n\nEdward attended Southern Illinois Normal University for four years and in 1895, he came to Marion as the Superintendent of Schools where he met Mamie Bundy, a school teacher.\n\nProfessor Longbons and Mamie Bundy were married on August 13th of 1896. She was born on October 3, 1872 at 8 Mile Prairie near Carterville, Illinois.Mamie Ellen Bundy was the daughter of William H. Bundy, (1846-1938), early Marion druggist, banker and businessman, and Isabelle Warder (1848-1883) daughter of Joseph Warder and Anne T. Kirkham (1822-1890).\n\nAt the time of the 1900 census, Edward and Mamie were living in Metropolis in Massac County, Illinois. He was Superintendent of Public Schools there. They had two daughters, Belle and Elizabeth. The couple stayed in Metropolis until 1904 when they returned to Marion to live and he became a traveling salesman selling books and other educational supplies.\n\nEdward’s father, Thomas, died in August of 1910 in Edwards County, Illinois. By this time Edward and Mamie had four daughters and one son: Belle, Elizabeth, Helen, Annie and Edward.They were living at 104 N. Vicksburg St. in a home they owned free of mortgage.\n\nIn February of 1913 their daughter Annie Louise died of scarlet fever and was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery.\n\nThe new Carnegie Library was built in 1916 and Edward served on the first library board.\n\nIn 1920, the Longbons were living in Champagne, Illinois.

In 1924 or 1925 they returned to Marion and bought a home at 514 E. Everett Street.\n\nIn the 1928-1929 Marion directory Edward and Mamie were listed at the East Everett St. address. Children present in the home were: Belle, teacher; Ed Jr., student; Elizabeth, teacher; and Helen, music teacher.\n\nIn 1930, only Helen was still living at home. Elizabeth and Belle were teaching in other towns and Edward, Jr. was probably away at school. Helen gave piano lessons in their home.\n\nThe Bank of Marion opened in 1937 as the area pulled out of the depression. Oscar Schafale told of the problems trying to get someone to be president of the new bank because the salary was so low, “no salary to speak of”, only $50 a month.Ed Longbons who had retired as a traveling salesman took the job. In 1940 his salary was still only $1200 a year; however, he had other income. He was re-elected every year after his first year at the bank’s organization. Interestingly, when Longbons died in 1944, Oscar Schafale succeeded him as president.\n\nIn the 1940 census the Longbons family still lived at their home on East Everett Street.The home was valued at $6,000.Helen was still home with her parents and lived on there after their deaths.\n\nOn February 18, 1944 Edward E. Longbons died after a short illness. He was very active in his memberships. He had served as a member of the Marion High School Board; the Christian Church, the Masonic Lodge, the Chamber of Commerce and the Rotary Club.\n\nMamie Bundy Longbons died on August 12, 1961. Helen remained in the home and as her sisters retired they returned home to live with her.\n\nNotes on the Children:\n\nBelle Longbons was born Sept. 13, 1897, in southern Illinois, the oldest of five children born to Edward and Mamie Bundy Longbons.

At the age of 20, Miss Longbons was employed full time as a violin and orchestral instructor in Herrin.
