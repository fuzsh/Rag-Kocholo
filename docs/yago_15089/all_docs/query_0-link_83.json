From accurate information ob-\n\ntained here it can be stated as a fact\n\nthat the first expedition toward Cuban\n\nsoil has started and the outlook is for a\n\nsuccessful trip. .\n\nWednesday, May 18, the United States\n\ntransport Florida left Port Tampa with\n\nseveral hundred volunteer troops on\n\nboard. The passengers belonged to the\n\nregiment of Cuban volunteers organized\n\nin the lower extremity of Florida some\n\nweeks ago. It was thought best to send\n\nthese men, as they speak Spanish and\n\nare more acquainted with the topography\n\nof the country which it is proposed to\n\ninvade. It cannot be learned what\n\nUnited States officers accompanied the\n\nregiment of volunteers. If this expedi-\n\ntion is a success other troops will be\n\nrushed into .the island as soon as possi-\n\nble. _\n\nOFF FOR MANILA.\n\nFirst California Regiment Goes Aboard\n\nthe City of -Pekin.\n\nSan Francisco, May 23.—The Presidio\n\n■was the center of attraction yesterday.\n\nThe published report that the Frst regi-\n\nment California volunteers would em-\n\nbark in the City of Pekin today drew\n\nthousands of people to their camp to say\n\ngoodby.\n\nThe First regiment was a scene of ac-\n\ntivity, having received orders to break\n\ncamp and march to the steamer Pekin\n\nthis morning, and officers and men were\n\nbusily engaged in making final prepara-\n\ntions.

A\n\npart of these equipments have arrived\n\nand General Williston hopes to get all\n\nneeded supplies by the middle of the\n\nweek.\n\nFORT M’PHERSON.\n\nTwo\n\nRecruits Arriving at the Rate of\n\nHundred a Day.\n\nAtlanta, May 23.—About 2,000 re-\n\ncruits have arrived at Fort McPherson\n\nsince that post was made the centraliza-\n\ntion point for that branch of the army.\n\nEvery recruiting station in the country,\n\nfrom Maine to California, has sent some\n\nmen, and they are still arriving at the\n\nrate of 200 a day.\n\nIt was not intended to send any of the\n\nmen away until they were uniformed\n\nand equipped, but the need of men for\n\nthe Philippines has brought about the\n\nnecessity of getting more men in the\n\nregular army regiments in the west.\n\nColonel Cook yesterday asked for\n\nvolunteers to go to the Philippines and\n\n900 responded almost instantly but only\n\n600 are wanted to make out the Third\n\nbatallion of two regiments. It is likely\n\nthese men will go to New Orleans to join\n\nthe Eighteenth or Twenty-third regi-\n\nments of the regular army before these\n\nregiments, which have been assigned to\n\ngo with General Merritt, start for San\n\nFrancisco.\n\nThe Spanish prisoners who are to be\n\nexchanged for Correspondents Thrall\n\nand Jones, now in Morro Castle will be\n\nstarted for Cuba as soon as the depart-\n\nment here is assured of connection at\n\nMiama with a boat for Havana. Colonel\n\nCortijo and Surgeon Julian are still in\n\nignorance of the exchange.\n\nSLOW WORK IN ALABAMA.\n\nNational Guard Want to Preserve Their\n\nOrganization and Name.\n\nMobile, Ala., May 23.—The Alabama\n\nvolunteers are organizing slowly. The\n\nfirst regiment still requires 25 men.\n\nThe second regiment is short several\n\nhundred. The difficulty arises from the\n\nfact that the militia companies belong-\n\ning to the national guard want to pre-\n\nserve their name and organization. The\n\nmost of these companies have not more\n\nthan 30 or 40 men and the communities\n\nbeing small, this number cannot be in-\n\ncreased to the regulation number of 80.\n\nTo merge with companies from other\n\ncommunities is to lose name and some-\n\ntimes history extending through two\n\nwars.\n\nThe batallion, which is to be com-\n\nposed of negroes exclusively, will be\n\nbrought to camp here tomorrow. The\n\nnegroes have volunteered far in excess\n\nof the call and the pick of the number\n\nwill give one of the finest bodies of\n\ntroops the south will contribute.\n\n“McKinley Peacemakers.”\n\nReading, Pa., May 23.—On a rush\n\ntelegram from Washington, the Carpen-\n\nter steelworks late Saturday night sent\n\none hundred and fifty 13-inch projectiles,\n\ndestined for Sampson’s fleet. These\n\nweigh 1,200 pounds each and will go\n\nthrough anything Spanish afloat. Over\n\n800 projectiles of somewhat smaller size\n\nwere sent today to San Francisco, for\n\nDewey at Manila. The 13-inch projec-\n\ntiles are popularly known here as “Mo-\n\nKinley’s peacemakers.”\n\nWESTMINSTER\n\n....aILecture by....\n\nREUBEN DAILEY,\n\n-AT THE-\n\nPresiuierian 6HurcH,\n\n--ON\n\nMONDAY NIGHT, MAY 23/98.\n\nILLUSTRATED BY\n\nLANTERN VIEWS.\n\nEntire Proceeds to the Church.\n\nADMISSION, - 15 Cents.\n\nDoors Open at 734); Lecture at 8 p. m,\n\ng Have You Seen 1\n\nThe Latest Styles\n\nX\n\nin Wall Paper?

The Second Nebraska regi-\n\nment arrived and were assigned to the\n\ncampgrounds selected for the first di-\n\nvision of the Third corps. Only two\n\nbattalions arrived yesterday. The sec-\n\nond battalion of the Second Nebraska,\n\nwhich had become seperated from the\n\nregiment at St. Louis, came in over the\n\nCincinnati Southern. The belated bat-\n\ntalion was commanded by Major W. C.\n\nMace.\n\nThe First batallion of the One Hundred\n\nand Fifty-seventh Indiana infantry ar-\n\nrived in Chattanooga yesterday, accom-\n\npanied by the regimental band of 24\n\npieces. The batallion spent the day on\n\nLookout mountain and reached the park\n\nlast evening sleeping under the stars on\n\nLytle hill during the night. As a re-\n\nsult of the few arrivals the railroad\n\nyards which have been enormously con-\n\ngested with loaded and empty cars for\n\nnearly a week were given an oppor-\n\ntunity to clear off the tracks and sidings\n\nto make room for the troops that begun\n\nto arrive this morning.\n\nTwenty-five cars of provisions arrived\n\nyesU-day and were stored in the large\n\nwarehouses now completed on the park\n\ngrounds near the depot of the railroad\n\ncompany. Fifty-one of the latest and\n\nmost improved ambulances, built with a\n\nspecial view to adaptijpility in a hot\n\nclim®:e, arrived from Sofeth Bend, Ind.,\n\nand will be distributed to the first\n\ncorps. \\\n\nWill Erect Waterworks.\n\nIt has been definitely decided to er8ct\n\nimprovised waterworks, and a contract\n\nhas been let and all the material or-\n\ndered, the first consignment of pipe ar-\n\nriving yesterday. There is no scarcity\n\nof water now, but it is feared that some\n\nof the wells are from “wet weather”\n\nsprings and that later they will dry up\n\nand the piping of water from the ci’eek\n\nand Crawfish springs is a precautionary\n\nmeasure.\n\nThe Fourth Ohio regiment, under\n\nColonel Coit, has been assigned to pro-\n\nvost guard duty in Chattanooga, Uy\n\nIllinois Troops at Jacksonville, Fla.\n\nJacksonville, Fla., May 23.—The first\n\nof the troops to be encamped here ar-\n\nrived last night, the second regiment of\n\nIllinois reaching here first, followed by\n\nthe second Wisconsin. Both number\n\nabout 1,000 men each. The north camp\n\nis in command of Brigadier General H-\n\nW. Lawton. The North Carolina regi-\n\nments will reach here today and others\n\nwill follow later on.\n\nNever Pays Twice.\n\nLondon, May 23.—The Brussels oorre-\n\npondent of The Daily Mail says: United\n\nStates ^Consul George W. Roosevelt,\n\nwhen asked to take an active part in\n\nthe Hispano-American war declined,\n\nsaying: “I was wounded in the war of\n\nsecession a dozen times and have paid\n\nmy debt to my country. An American\n\nnever pays the same debt twice.”\n\nHavana Official Dispatch.\n\nMadrid, May 23.—An official dispatch\n\nfrom Havana says: “Two American\n\nwarships attempted to force an entrance\n\nat Isabela Sagua (near the mouth of the\n\nSagua river, Santa Clara province, on\n\nthe north coast). The troops were\n\nmassed upon the shore and compelled\n\nthe Americans to retire.”\n\nThat Cadiz Squadron.\n\nGibraltar, May 23.—An unconfirmed\n\nrumor is in circulation here that the\n\nSpanish squadron at gCadiz is about to\n\nsail for Cuban waters. A Spanish bat-\n\ntery of artillery arrived yesterday after-\n\nnoon at Son Roque, seven miles north-\n\nwest of Gibraltar, and has been placed\n\nin position. _\n\nGeneral Merritt In Chicago.\n\nChicago,\" May 23. — Major General\n\nMerritt, governor general of the Philip-\n\npines, arrived in this city last night\n\nfrom Washington. He will reuiain here\n\ntwo or three days, it is said, and will\n\nprobably sail from San Francisco for\n\nManila in about „10 days.\n\nUNSATISFACTORY TRAIN SERVICE.\n\nThe local accommodations for pas-\n\nsengers over the B. & O. 8. W. are so\n\ndifficult and bad that it is almost as\n\neasy-to reach New York or any ol\n\nthe small way stations between here\n\nand North Vernon. If one leaves\n\nhere in the morning it is Impossible\n\nto return the same day and to go to\n\nany way station two days have to be\n\nlost. The road seems to be devoting\n\nall its energy to through traffic.\n\ng BEN DOOLITTLE, •\n\n® ; SPRING STREET. ®\n\nTHE\n\nSpanish War\n\nHAS NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR\n\n$19.50 ‘KENTUCKY FAVORITE’\n\n1,500,000 in use.\n\nWe are also agents for the celebrated Domestic,\n\nHousehold, White, Wheeier & Wilson No. 9, New Home\n\nSewing machine supplies for all machines.\n\nJ.
