MasterTemp® High Performance Gas Heaters make extending your pool season more practical and affordable than ever. With their revolutionary air/gas pre-mix, you can enjoy lightning-fast pool or spa heat-up and superior energy efficiency while outperforming industry emission standards for clean operation.

UltraTemp® Heat Pumps save up to 80% in energy costs by transferring heat from the atmosphere to your pool or spa, delivering significantly higher efficiency than any other pool heating technology. With more standard features than any other heat pump, including a lifetime warranty on the titanium heater exchanger, you can get even more enjoyment out of every pool season.
