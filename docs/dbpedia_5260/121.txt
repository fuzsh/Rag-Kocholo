Pentair Water Features

MagicStream® Laminars create totally clear, uniform arcs of moving water that originate from either your pool deck or surrounding landscape. At night, these translucent streams are brilliantly colored with an LED light source. The result is a water effect that adds an elegant bit of entertainment to your poolscape.

Laminar water streams can reach up to 7 feet high and project outward up to 8 feet into your pool, spa, or other water feature.

Choose energy efficient LED lighting for a nearly endless array of color choices. Nighttime lighting effects include the ability to hold on a steady color or scroll through a range of available colors.

Installation is made flush to your deck or other surface; no unsightly or unsafe edges, just the magic of water erupting from a hidden source.

Pentair Filters

By removing impurities such as dirt, leaves, grass, hair, body oils, sunscreen, and even many bacteria from the water, our high-efficiency filters keep your pool water clean, clear and inviting. Choose from three different filter technologies—cartridge, D.E. or sand.
