        "text": "Variable Speed Pool Pumps Compared 2023\n\nYour pool pump is one of the most important components of any swimming pool system. It plays a critical role in circulating water through the pool’s filtration system to keep the water clean and clear. With advancements in technology, variable speed pool pumps have become mandatory in states like California and here in San Diego. These pumps offer numerous advantages over traditional single-speed pumps and can greatly enhance the overall performance and efficiency of your pool system.\n\nBenefits of Variable Speed Pool Pumps\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of variable speed pool pumps is their energy efficiency. Traditional single-speed pumps operate at full speed, consuming a significant amount of energy, even when running at partial load. Variable speed pumps, on the other hand, can be adjusted to run at a lower speed, and flow rate, reducing energy consumption and operating costs.\n\nQuiet Operation\n\nAnother major advantage of variable speed pool pumps is their quiet operation. Single-speed pumps can be quite loud when running at full speed, which can be a nuisance for homeowners and their neighbors. Variable speed pumps, on the other hand, can run at a lower speed, reducing noise levels and ensuring a more peaceful and quiet environment.\n\nImproved Water Filtration\n\nVariable speed pumps can also improve the overall water filtration of your pool. By allowing you to adjust the speed of the pump, you can control the flow rate of water through the filtration system, ensuring optimal performance and water clarity. For commercial pools in San Diego, the County Health Department requires the pool water to be filtered (turned-over) three times a day. For properly size commercial pools that is about six hours for one complete filtration. Commercial pool typically operate for 18 hours to 24 Hours. Your residential pool does not have the same amount of swimmers as a large apartment pool, but still should operate for six hours a day (6 hrs/ day) at a minimum.\n\nTop Variable Speed Pool Pump Brands\n\nPentair is the premier manufacturer of pool pumps and other pool equipment. Their IntelliFlo VSF variable speed pool pumps are designed to provide the perfect balance of performance and energy savings, allowing you to enjoy crystal-clear pool water while reducing your energy costs by up to 90%.\n\nWith its intelligent control panel and quiet operation, the Pentair Intelliflo VAF, variable speed pool pump ensures optimal pool circulation and filtration with minimal noise or maintenance. Pentair’s IntelliFlo VSF pump responds to changing hydro-conditions by adjusting to changes in flow rate to maintain its preprogrammed flow rate running optimally throughout the entire filtration cycle.\n\nThe IntelliFlo VSF series also has advanced features such as:\n\nModel SP2603VSP\n\nRating: 230 volt\n\nHorsepower: 3.0 HP\n\nMax flow rate: 148 GPM\n\nFlow rate at 40 ft head at 3110 RPM: 128 GPM\n\nMaking the IntelliFlo VSF series a premium, low-maintenance option that saves you both time and money over the life of the pump. Invest in a Pentair Intelliflo VSF variable speed pool pump and experience a hassle-free pool maintenance routine that saves you money. Signature Pools of San Diego uses the Pentair IntelliFlo Variable Speed Pump VS+ for all our commercial pool customers\n\nHayward is the competing brand to Pentair in the pool industry. Their variable speed and variable flow pool pumps are among the top-selling products on the market. The Hayward Super Pump VS and the Hayward TriStar VS are both top selling options for pool owners who are looking for energy-efficient and reliable pool pumps.\n\nThe Hayward Super Pump VS is a variable speed pool pump that can deliver up to 1.5 horsepower of power while using up to 80% less energy than a traditional single-speed pump. It features a large, easy-to-read display and a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily program and control the pump’s speed and operation.\n\nModel SP2603VSP\n\nRating: 230 volt\n\nHorsepower: 1.65 HP\n\nMax flow rate: 106 GPM\n\nFlow rate at 30 ft head at 3000 RPM: 60 GPM\n\nThe Hayward TriStar VS is a variable flow pool pump that can deliver up to 1.85 horsepower of power while using up to 90% less energy than a traditional single-speed pump. It features a permanent magnet motor that is designed for quiet operation and long-lasting performance. It also has an intuitive interface that allows you to easily program and control the pump’s flow and operation.\n\nModel W3SP3202VSP\n\nRating: 230 volt\n\nHorsepower: 2.7 HP\n\nMax flow rate: 189 GPM\n\nFlow rate at 30 ft head at 3450 RPM: 167 GPM\n\nJandy is a premium brand in the pool industry, offering high-end products and innovative technology.\n\nThe Jandy VS FloPro Series pump features a variable speed motor that can be adjusted to match the specific needs of your pool, allowing you to customize the pump’s speed and flow to achieve maximum efficiency.

Sta-Rite is an economy solution and is the lower cost, economy brand in the pool industry. For pool owners who want the cost savings of variable speed technology at a more affordable price, the SuperMax VS pump is a wise choice. SuperMax VS pump is engineered for easy installation, simple operation, and trouble-free service.

A larger pool will require a larger pump, while a smaller pool will require a smaller pump. With that being said, a standard size pool can be handled by any of the pumps described here.\n\nCalculate Pool Size in Gallons.\n\nRectangular Pool\n\nLength x Width x Average Depth x 7.5 = Pool Volume in Gallons\n\nExample:\n\nLength = 30 ft\n\nWidth = 15 ft\n\nDepth Avg = 4\n\n30 x 15 x 4 x 7.5 = 13,500 Gallons\n\nOval Pool\n\nLength x Width x Average Depth x 5.9 = Pool Volume in Gallons\n\nExample:\n\nLength = 30 ft\n\nWidth = 15 ft\n\nDepth Avg = 4\n\n30 x 15 x 4 x 5.9 = 10,620 Gallons\n\nFlow Rate\n\nThe flow rate of a pool pump is another important factor to consider. This is the rate at which water is pumped through the pool’s filtration system. A higher flow rate will ensure optimal water filtration, but it will also consume more energy. A minimum flow rate is required to achieve a turnover rate of six (6) hours per day. What this means is that all the water in the pool is run through the filter system at least once in six (6) hours.\n\nTurnover Rate\n\nPools in San Diego are required to have a turnover rate of six (6) hours. Commercial pools in San Diego County are required to have a turnover three (3) times a day. Which means the pump runs for 18 hours a day.\n\nTurnover Rate (hrs) = Pool Volume (gal) ÷ Flow Rate (gal/min) ÷ 60 (min/hr)\n\nExample:\n\nTurnover Rate (6 hrs) = Pool Volume (13,500) ÷ Flow Rate (37.5 gal/min) ÷ 60 (min/hr)\n\nTo meet the six (6) hour turnover requirement for a pool size of 13,500 gal. in San Diego, the VS Pool Pump is required to have a minimum Flow Rate of 37.5 Gal/min.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nEnergy efficiency is another important factor to consider when choosing a variable speed pool pump. Make sure to choose a pump that has a high energy efficiency rating, as this will help reduce your energy costs over time.\n\nName Energy Savings Motor Size (HP) Pentair IntelliFlo VS+SVRS VSP Pump 3HP 90% 3.0 HP Jandy VS FloPro Pump 90% 1.65 HP Hayward TriStar Variable Speed Pump 90% 2.7 HP Sta-Rite Intellipro VSP 90% 3.0 HP\n\nPool Pump Replacement\n\nA variable speed pool pump is a great investment for any pool owner, and in some states like California they are mandatory when installation a new pump.
