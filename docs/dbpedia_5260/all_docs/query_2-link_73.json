        "text": "Whether you need a submersible pump for emergency pumping, tank dewatering, aquaculture water aeration, or another use, Pentair AES has the equipment you need. We carry a wide range of submersible water pumps, including air lift pumps, magnetic drive pumps, centrifugal pumps, and others. While all of these are designed to be submerged pumps, some can also be used above the water.\n\nChoosing the best submersible pump for your needs really depends on your project. If you're looking for a submersible pond pump to be used for aquaculture purposes, for example, then a magnetic drive pump may be your best choice. Air lift pumps can circulate and aerate water in aquaculture systems, while positive displacement diaphragm pumps are ideal for pond aeration and other uses."
