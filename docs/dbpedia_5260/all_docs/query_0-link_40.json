        "text": "Miridon is one of the largest water treatment companies in Estonia. With a background in industrial water treatment plants, it recognised early the need for reliable domestic water treatment in a region associated with water high in iron and hardness. Residential water softening and water filtration became a target for the business. The company researched the valve market and quickly concluded that there was one stand-out contender for this new enterprise: Autotrol.\n\nWith many customers putting their pool to bed for winter, it’s time to reflect on another busy year at Pentair and look to exciting times ahead. Our long-held vision for smarter, more sustainable pools is vindicated as climate change and rising energy costs continue to control the narrative. We have seen legislation in parts of Europe to restrict pool water usage and a marked shift towards more cost- and energy-efficient equipment. Our product development strategy has long anticipated these trends and it will continue that journey.\n\nWe wrote recently about the Pentair strategic decision to establish a production line for WellMate, its flagship pressure boosting vessel, at its tank manufacturing plant in Herentals in Belgium. The relocation had many upsides for European customers. These included a considerably reduced lead time for orders, more stock availability, better alignment with European Directives for pressure equipment and ultimately a lower carbon footprint as local manufacturing considerably reduces the emissions generated by shipping containers of empty tanks across the Atlantic.\n\nHow do you choose a product? Quality, reliability, availability and, of course, price all score high in procurement surveys. Surprisingly few mention ‘regulatory compliance’. Possibly because it can be taken for granted – especially in the highly regulated water treatment industry in which we operate.\n\nAt Pentair, we recognize and celebrate the humanitarians around the world who strive to meet ever-growing global needs for the basic necessities of life – including access to clean, safe drinking water. At Pentair, we are driven by our purpose to create a better world for people and the planet through smart, sustainable water solutions. We also believe that access to clean, safe water is a fundamental human right and foundational to economic development and gender equity.\n\nHere we review the good progress being made towards achieving the Pentair social responsibility strategic targets and showcase how its European operations are playing their part. Pentair has a long history of innovation that has made a positive impact on people and the planet. The decisions we make, the products we create, the solutions we offer, and the partnerships we form, are opportunities to make the world better. We believe that making life better for people and the planet, through smart, sustainable, water solutions, is essential. Indeed, the belief in ‘Making Better Essential’ now guides our social responsibility efforts and programme.\n\nAt Pentair, we recognize that responsible energy consumption is a key component of making life better for people and the planet. We are committed to reducing our impact through energy efficiency in our operations and a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We have made notable progress to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our operations, having decreased our total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 29% in 2022, as compared to the 2019 baseline."
