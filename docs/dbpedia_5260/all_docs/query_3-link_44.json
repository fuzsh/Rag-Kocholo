        "text": "The pump is one of the most expensive components of the pool. And pool owners want to save as much as they can on their purchase. The pump has a critical function — it controls the entire pool water circulation system. And if you end up with a poor quality pump, high energy consumption, or sudden failure, the initial savings may not be worth it.\n\nTo determine which pump is best for your requirements and whether or not you can save money on the pump, we compared three popular brands:\n\nExpensive but well-proven brands like Hayward and Pentair\n\nAffordable brand — Harris\n\nAnd we are happy to share our results here.\n\nTop 3 pool pumps\n\nBased on an analysis of customer experience, we have determined which pump criteria are significant and how satisfied their owners are with these criteria.

Also, pumps from each brand are in the top three. But each of these brands is noticeably different from each other and position themselves differently. Further, we tell you more about each model’s winners and brand.\n\nReview of the best 3 pool pumps\n\nModels in the top 3 differ in characteristics, functionality, and even purpose. So we’ll compare them in more detail below.\n\n#1 Pentair 342001\n\nBuild and component quality\n\nThe Pentair 342001 was specially designed for a variety of in-ground pools. It is well suited for any pool, fountain, spa, or other water body. The pump has thick-walled body parts, a powerful TEFC motor, and innovative hydraulics that make it compact and durable.\n\nInstallation and warranty\n\nThe pump is quite easy-to-install. But it is not a coincidence that we have combined the installation and warranty in one partition. Pentair provides a 3-year warranty on its pumps, but only if you use a “qualified expert” — that is, a company that has expertise in the installation of pools, or an electrician with documents proving his qualification. Otherwise, you will only have a 60-day warranty.\n\nNoise level\n\nThe Pentair 342001 tells you a bit about itself when it’s running at full speed at 3450 RPM. But at 2000 RPM, it is as quiet as a cat.\n\nHandy to use\n\nThe Pentair 342001 has three-speed settings, a graphic display, a built-in timer, and the ability to lock. All this makes this pump the winner in the “usability” category.\n\nCapacity and power consumption\n\nThe Pentair 342001 has a variable speed option, which distinguishes it from many other cheaper models. However, this provides more flexibility in adjusting the speed and the running time of the motor. In turn, when the pump is running at the lowest speed necessary to maintain hygienic conditions, it significantly minimizes energy consumption.\n\n#2 Harris H1572730\n\nBuild and component quality\n\nHarris pumps have a noticeably lower price than Hayward and Pentair pumps, but despite this, they are made of good materials. The shaft of the Harris H1572730 motor is made of stainless steel, and mechanical seals are made of carborundum and graphite (which also provide silent operation). The company cut costs on the housing, which is made of reinforced thermoplastic and not stainless steel like the W3SP1580X15.\n\nInstallation and warranty\n\nIf you already have a pump that needs to be replaced, the installation can only take about 30 minutes. Harris provides customers with a warranty, regardless of how the pump is installed. But, unlike the 3-year warranty from Pentair, the Harris warranty is only valid for 1 year. The Harris company is relatively new on the market, so you may want to reinsure yourself with an extended warranty.\n\nNoise level\n\nThe H1572730 is very quiet in operation. Its owners claim that it is so quiet that they have to carefully listen to it to check if the pump is working.\n\nHandy to use\n\nThe pumps are not difficult to operate. But for added convenience, they can have a built-in switch and timer. This model, like its closest competitor — the W3SP1580X15, does not have such features. However, you can separately purchase a programmable timer switch for convenience.\n\nCapacity and power consumption\n\nIn contrast to the Pentair 342001, the H1572730 has no variable speed, it has only one speed (high). Owners note that it performs its job well and they do not see any noticeable increase in their electricity bills.\n\n#3 Hayward W3SP1580X15\n\nBuild and component quality\n\nThe Hayward W3SP1580X15 is designed for above/on-ground pools. It has a stainless steel housing, as opposed to the plastic housing of the H1572730, that performs well even in harsh environments.\n\nInstallation and warranty\n\nWe have good and bad news for you about this model. The good news is that it is very easy-to-install by yourself and the installation does not affect the duration of the warranty. The bad news is that the warranty period is only 90 days. Recall that Harris has a warranty of 1 year, and Pentair — 3 years. This is the case where an extended warranty is a very good idea.\n\nNoise level\n\nThis pump is noisier than the previous models, but it is not unpleasant and you will not notice it while you soak.\n\nHandy to use\n\nThe W3SP1580X15 is convenient to use, but like the H1572730, the pump has no built-in switch and timer. If these functions are important to you, you can separately purchase a programmable timer switch.\n\nCapacity and power consumption\n\nThe W3SP1580X15 is the winner in the “Powerful” category. The filtration system with Its efficient work allows you to spend less time cleaning your pool. It needs less running time due to its power and performance. It is not as energy-efficient as the Pentair 342001 with variable speed, but its uses aren’t so essential to your electricity bill.\n\nAbout companies\n\nPentair\n\nThe history of Pentair began in 1966. Initially, the founders planned to make high-altitude balloons, but this idea resulted in only the word “air” being used in the name of the company. Since then, the organization has been diversified, and only in 2004, with the acquisition of Wicor Industries, the company plunged into the water industry.\n\nPentair is declaring that it offers smarter technologies that can reduce water consumption, and allow water to be recovered and reused. Pentair even won the EPA’s “Energy Star Partner of the Year Award” for high-efficiency pool pumps.\n\nPentair produces everything for pools, from all kinds of pumps and filters to lighting systems.\n\nTop 3 Pentair Pool Pumps\n\n#1 Pentair 342001 1.5 HP In-ground #2 Pentair 340038 1 HP Above-Ground #3 Pentair 340039 1-1/2 HP In-ground\n\nThe Pentair result is interesting. Its pump Pentair 342001 was the winner, but its other models have quite mediocre results.\n\nThe pumps are not leading in their strength and durability. Besides, 2 out of 10 owners of pumps Pentair 340038 and Pentair 340039 noted that they make noticeable noise.\n\nBut research has also shown that the strength of these pumps is their ease of use and good performance.\n\nHarris\n\nHarris Pool Products trademark was registered only in 2017. The company does not have a long history and does not report any social projects. Harris positions itself as a company that makes high-quality pool products at a low price.\n\nHarris focuses solely on pool products but has only 4 types of products: pool pumps, pool filters, winter pool covers, and solar pool covers.\n\nTop 3 Harris Pool Pumps\n\n#1 Harris H1572730 1.5 HP Above-Ground #2 Harris H1572748 1 HP In-ground #3 Harris H1572729 1 HP Above-Ground\n\nThe Harris pumps were good competition for Pentair and Hayward pumps. In Harris H1572730 and Harris H1572748 pumps, their owners specifically noted their quiet operation.\n\nAlso, all three pumps showed good results in power.\n\nBut still, there are some remarks about durability. 1 out of 5 owners of the Harris H1572747 and the Harris H1572729 mentioned the emergence of certain problems after 1-1.5 years of usage.\n\nHayward\n\nHayward Industries was founded back in 1963. The company states its mission to get rid of the troubles caused by owning a pool so that the pool would only provide a pleasurable experience. Hayward positions its products as technologically advanced equipment for pools requiring only minimal maintenance.\n\n“Our goal is that at the end of the day, your only concern is to turn your equipment on and off” — declares the company.\n\nIn addition to swimming pool pumps, the company has a variety of products for pools: filters, heaters, cleaning systems, chlorine generators, and much more.\n\nTop 3 Hayward Pool Pumps\n\n#1 Hayward W3SP1580X15 1.5 HP Above-Ground #2 Hayward W3SP1580 1 HP Above-Ground #3 Hayward W3SP2610X15 1.5 HP In-ground\n\nHayward pumps have the best reviews for their performance quality and durability. In addition, Hayward stands out among Pentair and Harris for its good customer support. But by other criteria, the pumps of its competitors surpassed Hayward.\n\nSummary\n\nHayward, Pentair, and Harris are leading brands in the pool pump market. All three have a place in the market because they lead in different things.\n\nHayward focuses on quality and expertise in pool products.\n\nPentair focuses on social responsibility and reliability.\n\nHarris focuses on the advantageous combination of price and quality.\n\n#1 Pentair 342001\n\nBest for in-ground pools and energy saving\n\nPrice range: $$$$\n\n#2 Harris H1572730\n\nAffordable quality pump for above-ground pools\n\nPrice range: $\n\n#3 Hayward W3SP1580X15\n\nThe most powerful pump for above/on-ground pools\n\nPrice range: $$\n\nFAQs"
