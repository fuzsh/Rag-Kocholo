        "text": "At first I was livid that they kept pushing the new app only for it to completely take my system offline. For a few days we had no ability to use our spa. I finally went into our pool shed where the main box is housed and did it manually. That was still crappy but at least we could go in. I text my pool install guy but no response. Iâm assuming because everyone was messaging him. I emailed Pentair about the issue and they did respond in a timely manner. I had to close out the app completely and reload it. The system was live again and working!!! The new app is different but all the features I had on the last one I have now. Iâm happy everything is working now !\n\nI installed the intelliconnect last week and was able to get it set up fairly quickly. I have a solid WiFi signal, so had no issues with getting it connected to WiFi and the app. I made a mistake in the app in setting up my single speed pump up correctly that caused the it to not recognize it as the main filter pump so the heater would never turn on. I worked with the support group over a couple of calls to figure out what was wrong and they were eventually able to find my mistake. Appreciate their dedication to getting it up and running. As far as the app it seems stable and usability is good. Since the app collects the BTU info in the furnace it would be great to get some furnace run time and estimated usage details. Also I noticed whenever I click on the air temp it asks me to do an address update. Not sure why it keeps forgetting my address. This is the reason for 4 stars vs 5. Overall a good product.\n\nAlso please add Apple Watch support for just Intelliconnect - would be useful.\n\nNot sure how this app is rated so high. It essentially turns lights on and off. The app lags when you ask it to do something and this is especially annoying when something goes wrong.\n\nI own 2 Pentair IntelleBrite lights, 3 MagicStream Laminars and a Color Sync Controller. Simple, but really expensive where I live.\n\nAs part of the set up (weâve owned it two weeks) the pool company came out to make minor adjustments, turned the power off for whatever reason, and now the lights are out of sync. Also the Solenoid Thumper stays on for every program - and it is LOUD.\n\nHereâs the problem, the only way to fix these problems requires toggling the power off and on, in rapid succession, multiple times within 30 seconds. This is impossible to do because both the app and the controller lag when you try to turn the system off and on.\n\nWhy doesnât the app or controller take what you have into consideration and just have a Solenoid Thumper Off/On button?\n\nWhy doesnât the App have a Sync Lights button?\n\nI find it hard to understand why a simple light switch thatâs been around for decades or an old version of their own controller can solve these problems, but a brand new system - that was created by the same company, has no simple solution.\n\nWhen you set up the app, it asks you questions about your pool and your location. I now see this is done just to see you things in the future, not serve your needs. Super disappointing."
