        "text": "Every pool and spa requires a pool pump and water filtration system. We prefer variable speed pumps because they conserve energy, water and operate with less noise. At Precision Pool and Spa we only install pumps which are equipped with an integrated Safety Vacuum Release System (SVRS) which is a safety valve that automatically shuts the pump off if a blockage is detected. This safety valve complies with the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act.\n\nEvery Precision Pool and Spa includes a high-performance Pentair heating system known for their remarkable energy efficiency. These heating systems swiftly increase the temperature of your pool and spa water, giving you more opportunities to enjoy your pool. During the design phase, we will recommend the system that will best extend your swim season according to the size of your swimming pool and spa. All fuel types are available.\n\nIf you prefer to use less chlorine, a UV light water sanitizer system might be right for you. This optional system reduces the total chlorine residual needed to sanitize the pool. It also reduces bacteria, viruses, fungus, and algae without the use of additional chemicals. Many customers choose this type of sanitation system to reduce the use of chemicals, which is often more comfortable for friends and family with sensitive skin or those swimmers with fur. We proudly use Paramount UV light and chlorinators.\n\nThe Pentair IntelliCenter Pool Control System is available for your convenience. This system allows you to program, set-up and control your pool and spa equipment from anywhere. Simply use the wireless mobile app or desktop control panel on your computer to adjust the temperature settings, chemical feed, lights, pumps and so much more. This convenient system allows you to efficiently view the history of the system and make changes as necessary. Controlling your system from afar gives you more control and greater energy efficiency.\n\nParamount in-floor cleaning systems keep your pool swim-ready without spending too much time cleaning it! We install a cleaning system that is engineered specifically for your pool, taking into consideration your pool’s shape, steps, benches and spa. During the design phase, a drawing is created to determine the exact number and location of cleaning nozzles needed. Throughout the pool and spa, rotating nozzles work together to systematically sweep the pool to the main drain and filtration system. When the cleaning system is complete the nozzles automatically retract into the shell of the pool where they are hardly visible. Nozzles are available in several colors to match the plaster finish of your pool. There are no unsightly hoses associated with the cleaning system and you can enjoy your pool while the cleaning system is working. An added benefit of the in-floor cleaning system is its advanced water circulation. The increased water flow improves the efficiency of the heating system and reduces the use of chemicals.\n\nSet the mood by illuminating your pool with an LED light show! We use a Pentair color changing lighting systems on our pool and spa designs. You can set your pool to one of several color choices or you can create an ambiance by choosing one of the many synchronized light shows. It’s easy to set your LED light sequence according to your mood. Entertain your friends with a quickly changing color sequence to get the party started or capture a romantic evening with a soothing and relaxing color transition pattern.\n\nUsing automatic chemical feeders systems increase the efficiency of your pool systems and reduce chemical use. All of our pools and spas include a freestanding chlorine feeder. Our system is completely enclosed, to reduce chemical fumes and uses slow dissolving tablets. This convenient system reliably feeds the designated amount of chlorine to your pool. Maintaining proper chemical balance is essential. If you prefer you can schedule regular maintenance service appointments from our professional team.\n\nMaintaining the pool and spa water level is important. For your convenience we offer an automatic water filling and leveling system. This system prevents damage to your equipment by automatically increasing water level if it falls below the selected level and reducing the water level in the event that the pool water becomes too high.\n\nAll Precision Pool and Spa installations include a custom safety cover to protect your pool and spa through the winter months. Mid to late summer, our service team will measure your pool. We’ll take into account any special features such as waterfalls, rock walls, a raised spa, and planters to get an accurate measurement. At your pool closing appointment in the fall, we will install your fitted safety cover. It’s easy, accurate and custom-fitted. In the rare case that a pool cover is not available, we will discuss your options prior to installing your pool."
