        "text": "Titanium Metal Benefits\n\nTitanium is known for its excellent corrosion resistance, and it’s very strong while being lightweight. The heat exchanger’s job is to capture the heat produced by burning gas and transfer it to the water in your pool. The ETi 400 High-Efficiency Heater’s direct-fire heat exchanger is made of titanium because the many benefits of this metal make it suitable for a long-lasting life under extreme conditions.\n\nAdditional Features\n\nEnergy Conscious: The UltraTemp heat pump provides digital controls with dual thermostats to offer precise temperature controls for pool/spa combinations. This feature helps to avoid overheating and in turn, wasting energy.\n\nAutoset Temperature Control: This standard feature monitors water temperature and turns the pump on and off as needed – overriding the time clock to ensure the desired temperature is maintained. You’ll have ultimate convenience and hands-free comfort control.\n\nAutomation Compatible: The perfect companion to IntelliTouch and EasyTouch Control Systems. All heat pump instructions and displays can be transferred to a centralized control system that manages all of your pool and spa operations and poolscape features.\n\nEasy, Dependable Operation: Self-diagnostic software continuously monitors the system for peak performance. The heat pump’s ETL listing is your assurance of safer, dependable operation.\n\nEnergy Efficient\n\nIntelliBrite 5G color-changing LED lights use less than half the energy competing LED lights, providing vivid illumination. At Emerald Pools and Spas, we know that LED technology is the face of the future in energy efficiency, lifetime value, quality of light, and the ability to have control of it. With its custom reflector and innovative design, the IntelliBrite 5G light is the most efficient underwater LED light available.\n\nIntelliCenter® Smart Pool Control System\n\nPool Control From Anywhere\n\nAt Emerald Pools and Spas we strive to stay on top of the most innovative pool products, which is why we utilize Pentair’s IntelliCenter Control System. This system can truly do it all. Easily and intuitively manage the features of your pool and/or spa from anywhere in the world with IntelliCenter’s remote access and built-in connectivity.\n\nProvides real-time email alerts\n\nSimple to use with multiple controller options on an intuitive touch screen interface\n\nProvides an optional indoor control panel and wireless remote\n\nControls spa jets, lights and light shows, blower, and water features remotely\n\nInterfaces with iOS®, Android® mobile devices, Apple Watch®, Amazon Echo® and Google Home® smart speaker, enabling owners to check their pools status remotely"
