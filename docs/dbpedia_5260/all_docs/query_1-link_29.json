        "text": "Only The Best\n\nAs a permanent part of your home, building a pool requires quality construction, equipment and products. Presidential Pools & Spas uses only the best and most advanced products in building custom pools.\n\nSome products are standard, while others, such as Intellicenter, represent the latest innovations in swimming pool construction. Your design consultant will work with you to determine which products are essential for your project.\n\nBelow are sample products from some of the primary pool product categories. Additional product options may be available in-store.\n\nFinishings: PebbleTec\n\nFor those seeking a one-of-a-kind pool surface design, PebbleTec Interiors brightens your pool with a noticeable glow. With Pebble Sheen, the sunshine and moonbeams reflect beautifully against your pool bottom. Our most popular pool finish features a blend of slightly smaller pebbles for a more refined texture, while still retaining the natural beauty and inherent qualities of our PebbleTec® pool finish.\n\nOffered in 6 standard colors styles and 3 upgrade colors (Pebble Essence). In PebbleEssence, we offer our most-popular, textured PebbleSheen® finish, enhancing it with smooth glass beads for extra watercolor radiance.\n\nIn-Floor Cleaning Systems: Q360+\n\nPool vacuums distract from the beauty of your backyard, and have a tough time consistently cleaning the entire pool. This is why in-floor cleaning systems were created.\n\nThe Q360TM In-Floor Pool Cleaning System is the most efficient swimming pool cleaner on the market. With less moving parts overall and an aerospace engineered valve design which propels water more effectively through the system, the Q360TM produces cleaning results unmatched by any other pool cleaning method or automatic pool cleaner.\n\nThe advanced system has options to accommodate any pool design, including three nozzle sizes for varying depths and areas, and five color choices to best match your design.\n\nHeaters\n\nA pool water heater will enable you to get the maximum value out of your pool investment by allowing you to enjoy the most comfortable water temperatures possible. A heater allows you to start your swimming season earlier and extend it later into the year and can lengthen your swimming day. Finally, a heater is considered a good investment, increasing the value and cost efficiency of your pool year after year."
