        "text": "Pumps\n\nBurkett’s Pool Plastering’s Equipment Technicians have the most advanced Pentair pool pump training. The New IntelliFlo3 variable speed and flow pool pump with built in sensorless flow control and on-board drive will automatically adjust water flow to your pool’s conditions, saving up to 70-90% in pool energy annually. Control your pool pump with a variety of pool pump interface options. The Pentair Home App allows you to create schedules and control the flow and speed from any mobile device (ie. smartphone or tablet) anywhere, anytime.\n\nAlso available on the IntelliFlo3 is the added feature of relays that can control color lights and a sweep booster pump from the Home App.\n\nThe Pentair IntelliCenter offers Pool & Spa owners the ability to control all features including activating the spa, water features and solar right from your mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet and is available with or without a salt water chlorine generator, giving you the most advanced smart pool on the market.\n\nAutomation\n\nAt Burkett’s Pool Plastering we take pride in installing Pentair and Jandy equipment, the industry leaders in automation. Automation takes the work out of scheduling and operating your pool & spa filtering schedules, pump speed, run times and setting heater temperatures. With Pentair and Jandy automation you are able to pinpoint the equipment schedules to save money by running it during off-peak times. Additionally, pool & spa valves, heaters, water features and lights can all be controlled with an App from your smartphone.\n\nComplete automation for your pool & spa provides control of the temperature, filter pump, pool cleaner, turning on/off water features, and setting the mood with color changing lights and light shows giving you the ultimate convenience at your fingertips. You won’t have to go out to the pool equipment to turn the valves, run the pump or turn on the heater. Do it all from the App anywhere, anytime.\n\nBurkett’s Pool Plastering can upgrade your old existing automation with the Jandy IQ30-RS board upgrade kit or Pentair EasyTouch & IntelliTouch systems to an IntelliCenter with a board upgrade kit. The upgrade uses the existing panel and replaces the old board with a new version making the system compatible with variable speed pumps and color changing LED lights.\n\nChlorination\n\nSalt Chlorine Generators by Pentair & Jandy effectively & automatically produce chlorine as your pool needs it. Using electrolysis technology, salt is converted to chlorine. Salt water pool and spa owners enjoy the feel of soft silky water due to the salt levels of 3000 – 3500 parts per million. Traditional chlorine pools can produce high chloramines which occur when chlorine is combined with sweat or urine.\n\nChloramines smell bad and can irritate skin and eyes. Most salt water pool and spa owners report a much less harsh chlorine smell in the water and on the skin as well as having no red eyes. Salt cells automatically shut down when the water temperature drops below 60 degrees. Supplemental chlorine is required during the winter months to maintain adequate sanitation of the pool water.\n\nUltraviolet (UV) System technology can be used to disinfect the pool water. UV systems expose water to an ultraviolet light at a specific wavelength that alters the DNA or RNA of any organisms floating in the water. After the pool water passes through the filtration system, it then goes through the pool UV system. Where the water flows under UV light, where any bacteria, pathogens, or microorganism cells are attacked by the light, destroying their ability to reproduce or survive making them harmless. Algae can’t bloom and germs can’t make you sick.\n\nUV systems don’t completely replace chlorine, but it does drastically reduce chemical usage in pools. Since water is only treated when it passes through the filter and the UV vessel, a low level of chlorine is necessary to control any contamination from swimmers in between filtrations, as well as to prevent any algae growth in any filter “dead spots.”\n\nUltraviolet bulbs and the sleeves surrounding them need to be replaced per the manufacturer’s instructions (typically once every 2-3 years) or the disinfecting power will fade over time.\n\nFilters\n\nWhen it comes to maintaining a pool, crystal clear water is a top priority for most pool owners. That's where Jandy and Pentair filters come in. These filters not only deliver the sparkling water you desire, but they also offer unique features that make maintenance simple and effortless. No more spending hours trying to clean your pool; Jandy and Pentair filters are designed to make the process as easy and hassle-free as possible. So, sit back, relax, and let Jandy and Pentair filters do the work for you, while you enjoy your pool to the fullest.\n\nAt Burkett’s Pool Plastering, we offer a full line of Cartridge Filters, Sand Filters and DE Filters for Jandy & Pentair. Our experts are ready to help spec and size the correct filter for your pool’s filtration needs.\n\nHeaters\n\nInvesting in a heater or heat pump for your pool can bring a whole new level of comfort and enjoyment to your swimming experience. Whether you like to start your day with a morning lap session, take a dip after dark, or extend your swim season to earlier in the spring or later in the fall, a pool heater can make it all possible. With a heater, you can adjust the temperature to your liking and make your swim sessions more comfortable and enjoyable. Plus, it's a great way to get the most out of your pool all year round. Don't miss out on the benefits of a pool heater and start enjoying a warmer, more comfortable swimming experience today.\n\nSolar heating is a great alternative to gas and electric heating. It takes advantage of the hot sun’s heat while running your filter pump at the same time. Solar heating is the most cost-effective way to heat the water in your pool to a comfortable temperature in the spring, summer and fall. It harnesses the sun’s energy to extend your swimming season and costs nothing to operate. On days when you can relax comfortably at poolside, but the water is too cold for swimming, solar heating can heat your pool to a comfortable temperature. More swimming, sunning and splashing means you’ll realize the full benefit of the investment you made in your pool.\n\nPool Cleaners\n\nSay goodbye to the hassle of cleaning your pool and hello to one of these pool cleaners. Depending on the specific needs for your pool, one of these pool cleaners is made to do the job.\n\nThe Polaris TR28P: This dependable pool cleaner is designed to easily connect to a dedicated pressure line and is suitable for all in-ground pools. With its powerful double jets and separate booster pump, the Polaris TR28P sweeps, scrubs, and vacuums the bottom, walls, and steps of your pool leaving it sparkling clean. It even has a built-in filter bag that traps large debris like leaves and pebbles, making maintenance a breeze. Don't waste any more time cleaning your pool when you could be enjoying it. Invest in the Polaris TR28P and spend more time swimming and less time cleaning.\n\nThe Pentair Rebel cleaner packs amazing performance into a compact, easy-to-use package. Its preprogrammed steering and two-wheel design allows the Rebel cleaner to access hard-to-reach corners where debris often hides. Plus, the superior engineering of its turbine and roller skirt assures thorough, uninterrupted cleaning that other cleaners simply cannot match. The Rebel cleaner’s extra-efficient hydraulic design makes it ideal for use with variable-speed pumps at low speed. Installation is a snap—just set it and forget it.\n\nThe Pentair Prowler 930W Robotic Cleaner is easy… just drop-in-and-go.
