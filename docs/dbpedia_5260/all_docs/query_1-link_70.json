        "text": "Pumps and Pump Systems\n\nWe service and install many brands of pumps and pump motors. We recommend Pentair and Hayward in terms of reliability and durability. These state of the art pumps and motors are more powerful and robust, use less electricity, are automated, programmable, and safer than traditional pumps. Both Hayward and Pentair have many pump options based on your specific pool needs.\n\nPentair\n\nPentair offers a reliable, safe, and established line of pump and pump systems.\n\nThe INTELLIFLO® VS+SVRS Variable Speed Pumps are variable speed pumps that greatly reduce energy costs, up to 90%! These pumps are also fully compliant with the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool & Spa Act with a built in SVRS (Safety Vacuum Release System).\n\nThe INTELLIFLO® VS+SVRS pump uses an easily programmable keypad and has the “ability to program exact pump speeds for specific operations – filtering, heating, cleaning” Running on variable speeds allows you to save money. The idea for variable speed is you can ‘dial up’ your needs\n\nPlease accept marketing-cookies to watch this video.\n\nHayward"
