Along with this, the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 7.12% during the forecast period, i.e., 2024-30. The factors attributing to the surge in demand for pool equipment like pumps, automatic filtration systems, etc., are the growing awareness among individuals regarding pool sanitation, increasing development of luxury hotels & resorts, and rising pool recreational activities.\n\nReport Coverage Details Study Period Historical Data: 2019-22 Base Year: 2023 Forecast Period: 2024-30 CAGR (2024-2030) 7.12% Regions Covered North America: US, Canada, Mexico Europe: Germany, The UK, France, Spain, Italy, Rest of Europe Asia-Pacific: China, Japan, India, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, Rest of Asia-Pacific South America: Brazil, Rest of South America Middle East & Africa: UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Rest of MEA Key Companies Profiled Fluidra SA, Pentair Plc., WaterCo Ltd, Pool Corporation, Maytronics Ltd, Aqua Products Inc., Hayward Industries Inc., Zodiac Pool Systems Inc., Chemoform AG, Desjoyaux S.A., Emaux Water Technology Co. Ltd., FIJA Group, Guangdong Laswim Pool & Spa Equipment Co., Intex Recreation Corp., Neptune Swimming Pools, NextPool Group, Pleatco LLC, Others Market Value (2023) USD 19.78 Billion Market Value (2030) USD 31.14 Billion\n\nIn recent years, pool recreational activities, like volleyball games, musical water balloon toss, etc., have witnessed a surge due to the growing focus of individuals on socializing & enjoyment activities. Also, individuals prefer the swimming pools over the beaches since they are a more controlled environment and not shallow compared to the oceans & seas. Based on the consumer survey conducted by the Just Hoo It Organization, more than 60% of individuals prefer swimming pools over the seas. Owing to this growing inclination towards pools, major groups like aqua clubs, are opening the swimming pools. For instance, in 2024, the Aqua Club opened a swimming pool for public use in Mangalore, India, consequently supporting the requirement for the related equipment.\n\nMoreover, in several developing countries, such as India, residential as well as public pools are peculiar. As per the statistics by the Government of India, Delhi has only 182 authorized public swimming pools, i.e., one swimming pool for 0.12 million population. This limited availability causes overcrowding during the summer seasons and leads to the building up of hazardous bacteria in the pool. This, in turn, causes severe health problems like nasal infections and skin infections. Therefore, to eradicate the issues, the pool owners & operators are compelled to ensure regular maintenance & cleaning by using filtration systems and chemicals, supporting the market growth.\n\nAlong with this, the number of public pools in the UK also dipped due to the growing health concerns. Based on the statistics by the Environment Protection Agency, around 400 public swimming pools were closed in the country from 2010 to 2023. The major reason responsible for the closure was health-related issues. As a result, national governments across the globe laid standards that state that the pH level, calcium hardness, and alkalinity of the water must be within the set limit. Thus, the operators are using products like filters, cleaners, and chemicals, enlarging the Global Pool Equipment Market size.\n\nFurther, individuals are now eyeing swimming as an athletic & workout activity since it helps keep the heart rate normal and builds endurance and muscle strength. Additionally, several individuals are signing up for the swimming athletic competition. As a result, they are increasingly going to international standard-based swimming complexes, thereby, raising their demand. Thus, the sports authorities of various countries are focusing on constructing new pools to provide proper training to the individuals, which would continue to uplift the demand for the pool equipment in the forthcoming years.\n\nGlobal Pool Equipment Market Driver:\n\nIncreasing Establishment of Hotels & Resorts Globally – The tourism industry across the globe is witnessing substantial growth owing to rising consumer expenditure. As per the statistics by the World Tourism Organization, in 2023, more than 1,300 million international tourists traveled to different countries, like the UAE, France, Spain, etc. This, surge in international tourist arrival is accentuating the requirement for accommodation facilities. As a result, top companies, like ITC Grand, Radisson Blu, etc., are expanding their hotels & resorts. In 2024, JW Marriott announced the addition of more than 10 new hotels and properties, especially with luxury amenities, such as exquisite food, various room services, spa as well as swimming pools.\n\nMoreover, travelers nowadays book hotels based on the availability of pools & hot tubs. According to the survey conducted by Vivo Aquatics, more than 75% of the users prioritize the presence of pools while booking the hotels. Thus, the hotel groups are ensuring that their new properties have both private as well as common pool availability. This, in turn, is accentuating the demand for equipment such as pumps, filters & heaters, supporting the overall market growth.\n\nGlobal Pool Equipment Market Opportunity:\n\nEmerging Residential Pool Culture – In recent years, homeowners have made substantial investments to develop backyard swimming pools within their homes to create a staycation home. According to Energy Star, nearly 8.5 million residential pools are installed across the US, and around 200,000 new pools are built annually in the country. This resulted in increasing demand for pool equipment across the region.\n\nIn addition, the availability of the swimming pool increases the value of the housing property. As per the National Association of Realtors, in-ground fiberglass and concrete pools increase the value of homes by an average of 5%. As a result, several real estate developers & consumers are constructing backyard swimming pools in their houses, amplifying the demand for the pool equipment.\n\nMoreover, the regions, like North America, the Middle East & Africa, etc., are witnessing an increase in smart cities & smart house projects. These projects would comprise the swimming pools to provide consumers with luxury amenities, posing as an opportunity for the equipment manufacturers to supply their products and boost market growth.\n\nGlobal Pool Equipment Market Challenge:\n\nSupply Chain Disruptions & Product Shortages – Post-COVID-19, the entire industry is working through a serious supply shortage, in a wide range of critical materials, such as PVC, resin, etc., essential for manufacturing and installing pools. Moreover, the geo-political tensions among the countries, like Russia & Ukraine, Israel & Iran are directly impacting the trade and trading routes of the essential commodities. As a result, several countries are facing the unavailability of several products essentially required to maintain the pools.\n\nFurther, the companies are passing on their higher operational costs to the consumers by spiking the price of the products, such as pumps. As per the Indian Pump Manufacturers Association (IPMA), in 2024, the pump set producers announced to increase in the price by 5% to 7% owing to the surging cost of raw materials, especially pig iron & copper. This surge in the prices of the products is further refraining consumers from purchasing them, hindering the market growth.\n\nGlobal Pool Equipment Market Trend:\n\nIncreasing Focus on Energy-efficient Pool Pumps – In recent years, consumers have become more conscious about the energy-efficiency & sustainability. Based on the survey conducted by the company, more than 80% of the consumers are aware of the benefits related to energy conservation & plan to purchase solutions that help in power saving.\n\nWith the rising adoption of energy-efficient solutions to reduce operational costs associated with pool maintenance & cleaning, consumers have started utilizing energy-efficient pumps in pool equipment. According to the company the company certified in-ground pool pumps use up to 50% to 65% less energy as well as save a total cost of USD 450 per year. With the added ‘cost to ownership’ benefit and significantly reducing related energy costs, the demand for energy-efficient pumps across regions like North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific region would continue to grow in the forthcoming years as well.\n\nGlobal Pool Equipment Market (2024-30): Segmentation Analysis\n\nThe Global Pool Equipment Market study of MarkNtel Advisors evaluates & highlights the major trends & influencing factors in each segment & includes predictions for the period 2024-2030 at the global level.
