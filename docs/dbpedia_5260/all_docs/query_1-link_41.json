        "text": "Exclusively Pentair – and here is why.\n\nFor years, the discussion by pool techs and designers has been which brand of equipment has stood the test of time?\n\nBeing a Commercial Pool Service Tech and Pool Designer for over 20 years I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly! The hard to service, the poorly designed and the products that plainly do not last. So after 20 years, I fully recommend Pentair.\n\nAs your Designer, I will configure your plan callouts using right size methods for best fitment, user needs, size of pool and spa.\n\nPool Circulation Pump\n\nINTELLIFLO® 2 VST\n\nVariable Speed Pump\n\nINSTALLED IN MORE POOLS THAN ANY OTHER VARIABLE SPEED PUMP.\n\nThe variable speed pump that started an energy-savings revolution is back, and better than ever. With energy savings of up to 90%* versus conventional pumps, a new easy-to-read rotatable keypad and advanced programming capabilities, there’s even more to love about our latest IntelliFlo. And did we mention its unmatched field reliability? Now you know why it’s the top choice for pool pros and pool owners around the world.\n\nFEATURES\n\nENERGY STAR® Certified\n\nCost savings that average up to $1,500 annually. Up to 90% energy savings compared to previous-technology pumps\n\nNear-silent operation-as low as 45 decibels\n\nSeemlessly interfaces with IntelliTouch®, EasyTouch®, SunTouch® Pool and Spa Control Systems\n\nRotatable keypad with optional wall mount kit\n\n*Savings based on variable speed pump compared to a single-speed pump running 12 hours per day at an average of $0.16 per kWh in a 20,000-gallon pool.
