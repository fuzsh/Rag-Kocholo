        "text": "If you are currently shopping for a new pool, you've probably noticed that a lot goes into just choosing a pool model. Is it saltwater compatible or approved for semi inground installation? But once you do narrow it down, there are tons of options concerning the details of what makes up the pool kit itself.\n\nThis article addresses each section of our above ground pool kit builder line by line. When customizing your swimming pool kit, scroll down to each section and click the \"+\" symbol to expand each section.\n\nNOTE TO THE READER:\n\nWhile on the kit builder directly, each customizable item should have an \"i\" with a circle around it. Click that icon for more information on each specific item.\n\nLet's zoom in and tackle each section.\n\nTHE LINER AND ACCESSORIES SECTION\n\nLiners\n\nThere are a variety of different liners to choose from, so there are a few things to consider when purchasing a new or replacement pool liner. In most cases, appearance and budget play big parts here, but there are a few other things to keep in mind.\n\nWhen using our Above Ground kit builder, this section will look like the following. You'll be able to filter liners by three categories:\n\nType\n\nManufacturer\n\nThickness\n\nLINER TYPE\n\nThere are 3 main types of above ground pool liners including Overlap, Beaded, and Uni-Bead liners.\n\n1. Overlap Liners are typically the least expensive but are limited in the availability of heavier thicknesses. Overlap liners will drape over the top of the pool walls and hang down on the outside of the pool. The pool's top rails and ledges work with the water pressure to keep this liner type snug in place.\n\n2. Beaded Liners snap onto a required bead track that runs around the inside of the pool. This is what holds the liner in place. Beaded liners are much easier to install and replace than an overlap liner. This is because you do not have to remove top ledges or rails to replace a beaded liner. They just snap on and off as needed"
