        "text": "Environmentally Responsible Swimming Pool Equipment\n\nPentair’s Eco Select swimming pool equipment saves energy, conserves water, reduces noise, or otherwise contributes to a more environmentally responsible pool equipment system.\n\nVariable Speed Pumps\n\nStandard pool pumps can consume as much energy as all other home appliances combined—often costing more than $1,000 per year! IntelliFlo® pumps can typically cut energy use by 30% to 90%, generally saving $324 to $1,356 in utility costs annually—more where rates are higher than average.*\n\n*Savings based on comparison pump running between 3.6 and 12 hours per day at the national average of 15¢/kilowatt hour in a 20,000 gallon pool.\n\nAutomated Color-Changing Lights\n\nLED lights use the least amount of energy of all lighting options\n\nIntelliBrite® LED (Light Emitting Diode) color-changing pool and spa lights are the most energy-efficient color-changing pool and spa lighting option available. Plus, they can last 30,000 hours or more, minimizing replacement cost and disposal.\n\nAutomation\n\nPentair control systems can optimize energy use and equipment performance by automating and synchronizing equipment scheduling. They prevent problems and waste so you don’t have to rely on your memory or limited time clocks to operate or turn off equipment.\n\nHow the Systems Approach Delivers Even More\n\nAs you’ve seen, there is a compelling “green case” for these Eco Select products. Every one of these products can lay claim to saving energy, water, reducing noise, maintaining air quality, or delivering combinations of these environmental benefits.\n\nPerhaps most compelling of all is when these “best in breed” choices are linked into a single green system. Not only are the individual products more environmentally responsible than other choices, there can be synergistic effects as well.\n\nR.L.’s Swimming Pools will help you optimize your system for peak performance to minimize your energy and water use."
