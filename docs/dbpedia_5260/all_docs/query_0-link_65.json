My sense has been installed almost two years now. We also have a variable speed pentair motor running out pool and is on a daily schedule. For almost two years, I’ve been trying to get my pool identified. Every day I see it turn on and a huge spike in my power that is immediately added to the “other” category. I do however have the pool controller identified (turns on exactly at pool start time and off at pool off time), but it’s only 45w. No way in heck that’s the motor"
