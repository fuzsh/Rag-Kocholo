        "text": "Get the best possible pricing on high-performance pool equipment when you bundle & save. Building a new pool? Choose your own equipment to ensure a reliable, hi-spec pool system with maximum efficiency. Don't even know how old your pool equipment is and it never seems to be working right? Start fresh with modern technology so you don't have to worry about the water staying blue and clear.\n\nUpgrade to a modern salt chlorine generator to eliminate the need to constantly buy and add chlorine - say goodbye to chemical hassles and worrying about algae. Choose a variable speed pool pump to save up to 85%* on electricity usage; plus, you can typically hardly hear a VS pump running so that your backyard oasis stays peacefully quiet. Choose a cartridge filter with max capacity and fine micron filtration for that sparkling-clear water. Get the latest pool tech and add a cyclonic pre-filter for drastically less maintenance and even greater filtration capacity."
