        "text": "A pump is essential to the cleanliness and overall condition of your pool. It is the heart of the circulation system, clearing debris and mixing chemicals. Pumps were once considered a necessary evil of ongoing energy output and rising electricity bills. That is, until the Pentair Variable Speed Pool Pump was introduced. The idea of variable speed and power meant lower maintenance costs and more effective filtering.\n\nThe Industry Before\n\nBefore variable speed was introduced, single and dual speed were industry staples. But when turned on, they stayed on. At one speed with constant filtration and a continuous uptick in dollar signs. And once you turned them off, there wasn’t any more filtration.\n\nSingle speed options are enticing. They have low initial costs and can get the job done. However, you’re either all-in or all-out. This means continuous maintenance by turning it on and off all day long, and losing out on the side of energy cost savings when you’ve been forced to leave it running for 24 hours.\n\nThe introduction of dual speed attempted to fix the energy consumption its predecessor, but many pool owners would still run them on low all day long. Unfortunately, low speeds don’t produce as much water flow and water would be found almost as dirty as when you started.\n\nThe Introduction of the Pentair Variable Speed Pool Pump\n\nIntelliFlo Variable Speed technology was an innovation unlike any seen before in the industry. Pentair was able to introduce something with a long service life that was energy efficient and near-silent.\n\nMeeting strict energy efficiency criteria set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy – it is ENERGY STAR® Certified. Compared with traditional varieties, energy savings are estimated up to 90%. The Pentair Variable Speed Pool Pump also has built-in diagnostics to give it longer service life.\n\nThe ultra-efficient permanent magnet motor design reduces noise and vibration. The totally enclosed fan-cooled (TEFC) design makes IntelliFlo the quietest option available. To put this into perspective, a library has an average decibel output of 30 dB, while a moderate rainfall sits around 50 dB. The IntelliFlo pumps fall right in the middle at 45 dB. This is not only great for efficiency and longer service life, but it is also a favorite for anyone who prefers the calm and relaxation of a backyard pool.\n\nVariable Speed Pump Features\n\nPump Performance and Control\n\nThe size of your pool sets the standard for the level of performance needed from your pump. In order to filter the water and properly circulate chemicals, specific motor sizes and speeds are recommended.\n\nA motor size between 1.5 – 2.0 horsepower is recommended for the best possible performance in medium-sized pools. Larger sizes, on the other hand, typically require much higher horsepower to circulate large volumes of water through the variable pump. Pentair’s Variable Speed options have the proper settings to adjust the water flow for any size pool.\n\nTraditional single speed varieties operate at an unchangeable speed setting, but the Pentair Variable Speed Pumps have three to eight different adjustable speeds. Additionally, there is a built-in timer to ensure that everything runs at optimum speed and duration.\n\nOnce installed, IntelliFlo is fully compatible with IntelliTouch®, EasyTouch®, and SunTouch® Control Systems, providing a range of options from indoor control panels to wireless remotes to manage heating, lighting, spa jets, water features, and more. For even greater control, add an optional ScreenLogic® Interface to your automation system and access your control systems from practically anywhere and at anytime with your smartphone, computer, or mobile device.\n\nEnhanced Energy Efficiency and Cost Savings\n\nOne of the biggest reasons many owners switch to variable speed is the potential cost savings. Pentair can save you up to 90% on the energy output. Many pumps, even those considered to be “energy-efficient,” still use the traditional technology of an induction-style motor. The IntelliFlo uses an advanced permanent magnet motor, similar to what is in a hybrid car.\n\nBecause of the level of energy reduction received, estimated cost savings can be up to $1,500 per year as compared to single speed options. Yes, many Pentair Variable Speed Pool Pumps might seem costly on the front end, but you can rest assured that you are highly likely to see a return on that investment within the first year.\n\nWhat Sets Pentair Apart\n\nMany people already use dual speed pumps, as they have proven cost-efficient. So why would you change to variable speed when what you currently have is working fine?\n\nThe Pentair Variable Speed motors have made a significant impact on electricity savings based purely on the design of the motor. By utilizing the variable speed control, these energy savings have reached an extreme new limit. Also, the level of control over programmability is unseen in other products on the market. Speed can be automatically adjusted throughout the day given any unseen situation. And if you cut it in half, you can cut power consumption by 87%.\n\nAdjusting the speed does more than prove energy-efficient and good for your wallet. When water moves more slowly for longer periods of time, it helps reduce the occurrence of algae. Pumps that typically move water briskly and then are shut off for long periods of time, do not sift and filter out particles as well. This is also true for automatic chemical dispensers and chlorinators. Each works a bit better when water is kept moving.\n\nWhat to Consider When Choosing a Model\n\nChoosing the correct variable speed model shouldn’t be taken lightly as it is a substantial investment. It is essential to look at every feature, benefit, and detail associated with the Pentair Variable Speed Pump before making a final decision.\n\nThe benefits of an Intelliflo pump have proven to far outweigh any previously touted by old industry units. In fact, Pentair has the best possible solution to reduce algae build-up, improve filtering, and boost chlorinator performance while receiving energy and cost savings.\n\nA few things to consider beyond the aforementioned features:\n\nSize – Bigger doesn’t always mean better. A pump suited for the flow rate and turnover required for your pool is essential.\n\nIn or Above Ground – While many options are interchangeable, it is best to find one suited for what you have.\n\nInstallation – Installing a new variable speed pump requires more than just wiring and plumbing. It also includes optimizing the equipment and pool settings to get the best possible energy reduction. Don’t try to install without an expert.\n\nAt GPS, we carry three Pentair Variable Speed models. To determine which is best for you, keep reading.\n\nPentair Intelliflo 3HP 230V Pool Pump VSF Variable\n\nThe Pentair Intelliflo 3HP 230V Pool Pump has eight programmable speed settings with a built-in timer that assures the best possible speed and runtimes for maximum efficiency and savings. The enclosed fan-cooled design keeps the motor running quietly for a longer extended period.\n\nIt has a top-mounted field compartment that allows for easy access and connection and the different lip lengths add flare to the design. The Intelliflo pump also comes with a circuit protector two-pole 20 AMP device near the electrical panel; dimensions: 28.5″ L x 12.5″ W x 16.5″ H.\n\nIt is fully compatible with IntelliTouch®, EasyTouch®, and SunTouch® control systems. It improves filter and chlorinator performances and helps reduce algae build-up.
