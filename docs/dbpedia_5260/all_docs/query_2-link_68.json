        "text": "Pool Pump Repair\n\nSwimming pools and spas in San Diego are operated with pool pumps. These pumps circulate the water within the pool or spa through the filter, helping to clean the water. In addition homes, apartments, condominiums, hotels, and business complexes may feature water fountains, waterfalls or other unique water features. All of these features depend on a fully operational circulation pump. When any of these pumps fail a pool pump repair will be needed or in some cases replaced with a new pump.\n\nPool Pump Repair for San Diego Homeowners\n\nCommon problems with San Diego hot tubs and pool pumps.\n\nDuring the average lifespan of a swimming pool or spa pump, there will eventually be the need of a pool pump repair. There are many symptoms that indicate an existing pool pump may be in need of repair or replacement. Intermittent power failures, high pitched squealing or buzzing noises and low water flow are some typical signs that a pool pump may need to be serviced. When this occurs San Diego County pool owners should have ProTouch Pool Services determine what pump repair is needed.\n\nTroubleshooting your spa, swimming pool or water feature pump.\n\nProTouch offers expertise and experience to evaluate any spa or swimming pool pump problem. When pumps begin to make a loud grinding or whining sound, owners can call the ProTouch team. We will schedule a service call for a pool pump repair or new pump installation estimate. Since the pool pump controls the circulation of the pool water through the filtering system, it is important to take action right away. You want to avoid issues with the water clarity and safety. An initial visit allows our technician to determine the severity of the pump problem. Then we can provide the homeowner with pool pump repair options.\n\nKnowledgeable and expert pool pump repair, replacement and diagnosis.\n\nThe ProTouch Pool Services team has been expertly repairing and replacing pool pumps throughout the San Diego area since 1998. All staff members participate in regular training sessions that help them stay ahead of current trends in the pool industry. They have up to date knowledge of the new products offered by most manufacturers. Our technicians can repair the equipment of any pool or spa manufacturer. Some of the most popular brands of residential and commercial pool pumps include Pentair, Jandy, Sta-Rite, and Hayward.\n\nMost pool pump repair service calls only take about two hours or less to complete. The actual time will vary based on the type of pump being repaired and the extent of the damage. We are also available to answer any questions customers may have about the pool pump repair process. Routine pool service that includes regular maintenance, and regular filter cleans, will help extend the life of a pool pump. Weekly pool or hot tub service also allows us to notify owners of any potential problems that may be on the horizon.\n\nUpgrading Your San Diego Pool Pump\n\nOccasionally, a swimming pool or spa pump is so badly damaged that repairing the pump would cost about the same as installing a new pump. In these instances, ProTouch highly recommends replacing worn out pumps with an energy efficient, variable speed pool pump. Smart pumps create an energy efficient swimming pool experience and helps reduce the overall cost of electricity on the monthly utility bill.\n\nNot just a good idea, itâ€™s the law.\n\nTitle 20 requires every California pool circulation pump greater than 3/4 horsepower to be replaced with a two speed or variable speed pump. If there is already a pool equipment controller in place, a new high efficiency pump can usually be programmed to work with the existing controller.\n\nNot Just a San Diego Pool Pump Repair Company!\n\nWhether you are in need of weekly pool maintenance, experiencing a swimming pool problem or simply want to inquire about new pool equipment installation, contact ProTouch Pool Services today!\n\nAreas Of San Diego That We Provide Pool Pump Repair\n\nAlpine, Bay Park, Bonsall, Bonita, Cardiff By The Sea, Carmel Valley, Carlsbad, Chula Vista, Clairemont, Coronado, Del Cerro, Del Mar, El Cajon, Elfin Forest, Encinitas, Escondidio, Fallbrook, Fairbanks Ranch, Kensington, La Costa, La Jolla, Lakeside, La Mesa, Linda Vista, Mira Mesa, Mission Hills, Mission Village, North Park, Oceanside, Ocean Beach, Pacific Beach, Pauma Valley, Point Loma, Poway, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Penasquitos, Rancho San diego, Rancho Santa Fe, San Diego, San Marcos, Santaluz, Santee, San Carlos, Scripps Ranch, Sorrento Valley, Solana Beach, Spring Valley, Tierrasanta, University City, Valley Center, Vista, 4S Ranch"
