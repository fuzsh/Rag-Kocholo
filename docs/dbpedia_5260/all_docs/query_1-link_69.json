        "text": "Being a “licensed electrician” in the State of Texas is not enough to perform “licensed” electrical work. Individuals with a Journeyman, Wiremen, or Apprentice license must be employed by a Licensed Electrical Contractor. To perform any electrical work in the State of Texas requires a Texas Electrical Contractor License (TECL) issued by Texas Department of Licensing and Registration (TDLR).\n\nTexas Electrical Contractors must maintain minimum insurance requirements, have a licensed Master Electrician as a full time employee, employ electricians with current TDLR issued Journeyman, Wireman, or Apprentices licenses, and pay annual licensing and renewal fees to TDLR. Some insurance companies do not cover damage caused by work performed by unlicensed contractors or individuals. Always ask for the TECL number of any electrical contractor.\n\nLearn More"
