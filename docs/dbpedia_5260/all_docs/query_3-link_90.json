        "text": "General Manager (Industrial Flow)\n\nPentair\n\nPentair is one of the world's leading global producers of end-to-end Water Treatment, Water Filtration, and Water Sustainability solutions. Following its official start in 1966, Pentair's first few decades of history were decorated in ups and downs as the company entered and exited varying industries including research balloons, paper production, power tools (Delta/Porter Cable), enclosures, and electrical solutions, seemingly searching for its mainstay identity. This dynamic changed in 2004 when Pentair officially entered the Water Solutions space via a strategic acquisition of Wicor Industries. The next 20 years of Pentair's history have been earmarked by successes in growing into one of the most powerful Water Solutions companies across the globe. In 2018, the final non-water business of Pentair's was divested, leaving room for continued laser-focus and investment in growth across end-to-end Water Solutions across three primary business segments - Pool, Industrial Flow, and Commercial Water Solutions. Pentair's executive team is seeking the next General Manager who will have full accountability over a profitable category P&L within the Industrial Flow business segment, while leveraging the power of hundreds of employees and Pentair's enterprise resources to drive an expansion of this critical business. This GM will have the opportunity to drive product and commercial success across complex product lines and market segments. In addition, this role is a highly visible component of Pentair's executive succession ladder as the company looks to grow by identifying talented senior leaders from the outside, and providing continued career growth opportunities into senior executive leadership.\n\nA Day in the Life\n\nThe General Manager for a critical segment of Pentair's Industrial Flow business will lead a high-performance team that thrives on developing and launching impactful, leading products and services for customers. This individual will lead a growth-focused product portfolio within a business unit that is profitable and has the potential for continued growth with the current focus being on outperforming the market and delivering better results than competitors. The General Manager will develop and drive the overall growth and profitability strategy for the complex filtration product categories through a cross-functional direct report team of Product, Sales, and Service leaders as well as matrixed leaders from Operations, Technology, Finance and Marketing.\n\nAs the General Manager within the Pentair portfolio, this leader will work cross functionally across the matrixed leadership team driving business growth. This leader will oversee product, product strategy, and commercialization, with sales, and marketing oversight. The GM will have the opportunity to influence and work through all matrixes and functions to ultimately impact the $300 million P&L they own.\n\nThis GM will need to be highly execution focused, relational, innovative, and strategic as they are responsible for making Pentair's Industrial Flow growth goals a reality through excellent leadership over the product lines in their perview. This GM will report directly to the Group President and will be a critical component to Pentair's senior leadership team."
