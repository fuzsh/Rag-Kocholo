        "text": "A Clean Pool is Healthy and Inviting\n\nPool Equipment Makes All the Difference\n\nAt Hive Outdoor Living, #1 Tampa Pool Builder, we take pride in each and every pool and spa that we install for our customers.\n\nOne of the reasons we are the best at what we do is that we do not cut corners, especially when it comes to your pool equipment.\n\nIn order to have a sparkling clean pool and/or spa, it is necessary to install the absolute best pump, filter and automation equipment, with the result that your pool/spa stays clean and sanitized, day in and day out.\n\nThe pump is the heart of the system as its function is to circulate the water so it can be cleared of debris. We have been using the industry leader’s (Pentair) swimming pool and spa pumps for years. Aside from performing the job of water circulation flawlessly, their pumps earned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR® designation due to being between 30%-72% more energy-efficient than their competitors in the industry.\n\nThe purpose of the pool filter is to keep your pool water clear and clean. There are many types of filters on the market and the Pentair cartridge filter does an amazing job of removing airborne dirt and leaves, organic matter, bacteria and algae. The Clean & Clear RP Cartridge filter has a surface consistency to block and trap particles as small as 20 microns. On top of that, it is relatively easy and quick to remove and rinse clean.\n\nDespite the year-round warmer temperatures in Florida, most people opt for a heater to ensure they can enjoy their pool in total comfort. Of course, if you are getting a spa, this piece of equipment is a must. Pentair MasterTemp heaters are efficient, convenient and extremely reliable. With a user-friendly LCD display, these pool heaters are easy to operate as a home heating system and the MasterTemp Heater is Eco-friendly and is certified for low NOx emissions, outperforming pool industry standards\n\nOne of the keys to years of enjoyment is your pool’s water chemistry. There are pH and sanitizer levels at which your water must be maintained to prevent the growth of algae, as well as keeping water safe for your eyes. The liquid around the eyes is generally between 7.0 and 7.3, which is pH neutral. Any significant fluctuation from those readings will cause your eyes to sting, similar to when water dripping from your hair reaches your open eye, as the pH of hair and scalp oil is generally acidic, between 4.5 and 5.5, in order to prevent fungi and bacteria from growing. The Pentair IntelliChem® Water Chemistry Controller works to keep the pH and chlorine levels of your pool in balance.\n\nMany people enjoy swimming at night and, to ensure safety, the Pentax MicroBrite Color and White LED Lights provide exceptional brilliance, lighting uniformity and some amazing colors. To add some spice, there is the option of Pentair GloBrite lights. These high-performance LED lights utilize the most advanced technology with five brilliant fixed colors and offer seven dazzling pre-programmed light shows.\n\nAnother very useful device is the Pentair IntelliLevel™ Water Leveling Monitor, utilizing multi-sensory technology to ensure that your pool water level stays at a safe level for operational efficiency. When water levels are too high there can be overflow and a waste of water. When the level is too low there is a danger that not enough water reaches the pool pump and filtration system, which can cause equipment damage. It is simple to set up and use and has built-in safeguards to notify you in case of any failure to operate properly.\n\nAnd, of course, having a device clean and vacuum your pool is an added plus. The fully-programmable Pentair Prowler 920 Robotic Pool Cleaner is top of the line and provides high-caliber cleaning, scrubbing and vacuuming, to the tile line.\n\nOne last thing to mention is the installation of your equipment. When you select Hive Outdoor Living to build your pool, rest assured that your equipment not only functions properly, but that it flows perfectly. By that we mean that all pipes leading into and out of the equipment area follow a logical pattern for optimum efficiency and are clearly marked for ease of identification.\n\nThe above cover the basics of an ideal swimming pool equipment and device set up. Of course, there are many additional options to enhance your outdoor living area, such as enclosures and screens, outdoor kitchens, fire pits, fountains, waterfalls, grottos, caves, jet sprays, etc."
