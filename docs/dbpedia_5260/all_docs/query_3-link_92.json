        "text": "Hidro-Water, making a big splash in water treatment\n\nA market-leading business built on quality, service and partnerships\n\nFor over a quarter of a century, Hidro-Water has been synonymous with quality, reliability and service in the Spanish water treatment industry. The company celebrated 25 years of growth in 2021 and shows no sign of slowing up. Hibernón Nogueroles Giner, CEO of Hidro-Water talks about the evolution of the business, the secret of its success and the important part played by key partners like Pentair.\n\nWater treatment is big business. It spans a vast range of markets from residential softening to municipal desalination, from swimming pools to industrial cooling. What these markets share in common is they all require specialist skills, technology and experience. It is rare to find a business that can cover the full spectrum, however Valencia-based Hidro-Water can truly boast all-rounder status. Hibernón Nogueroles, CEO at Hidro-Water traced back the business from its roots selling water softeners to becoming an international distributor and manufacturer.\n\nSuccessful Pentair partnership built on mutual values\n\nToday Hidro-Water stands out as a leader in the Spanish market for water treatment components and it has grown its business through the customer loyalty earned by the quality of its services and products. Part of that quality guarantee comes from choosing its partners with care and Pentair has been in step with Hidro-Water along its journey.\n\n“We are only as good as the components we choose, and Pentair has never let us down,” continues Hibernón. “From the beginning we knew Pentair quality matched our exacting expectations and they in turn were looking for a partner they could trust in our region. You could say it is a perfect match.”\n\n“Today, Pentair supply us with components for virtually every part of our business, from pumps and valves, to filters and resins to tanks and heaters. Looking back, our partnership with them has always been more than just transactional … we share the same values. In recent years that relationship has become even more fluid and the growth of our two companies has allowed us both to find synergies leading to mutual benefits in the purest WIN2WIN style.”"
