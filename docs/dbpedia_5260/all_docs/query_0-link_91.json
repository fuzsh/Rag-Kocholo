WHY: I bought an IntelliFlow VS pump for my pool in 2007 and was surprised to learn that I had to get a Pentair Controller to use most of its advanced features. Granted, you can run it like a 'regular pump' by switching power ON/OFF and get the benefit of a variable speed pump that can regulate its flow, but you are stuck with a manual setting of the flow rate on the pump. Talking to Pentair, I was told out that the protocol on the RS485 bus is proprietary and therefore there is no documentation available to anybody. The most cost effective Pentair solution to this problem is the Pentair IntelliCom* controller, that will 'talk' to the pump in response to activation of one of 4 inputs if the pump is in the 'right' mode. It is still a $385 list solution with the only benefit being able to run 4 different 'Ext.Ctrl' programs on a VS or to select one of the 4 speeds of a 4x160. This is, at least in my book, not good enough to justify the investment, so I put this project on the shelf until I had some more\n\nThis file has been truncated. show original"
