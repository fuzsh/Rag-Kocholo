        "text": "Pool Equipment Market Valued at USD 19.78 Billion in 2023, Projected to Reach USD 31.14 Billion by 2030\n\nThe Global Pool Equipment Market size was valued at USD 19.78 billion in 2023 & is estimated to reach around USD 31.14 billion by 2030. Along with this, the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 7.12% during the forecast period, i.e., 2024-30, cites MarkNtel Advisors in the recent research report. The rising awareness about pool sanitation, the increasing inclination towards energy-efficient pool pumps, and the surge in the development of luxury residential units and hotels are some of the factors supporting the demand for pool equipment across the globe.\n\nIn recent years, the customers have gradually inclined towards the pool party culture and actively participated in the recreational pool activities. Along with this, several individuals prefer to swim in the pools rather than oceans and seas since the swimming pools are shallow. As a result, several swimming clubs are expanding their swimming centers, which is further amplifying the demand for pool equipment.\n\nMoreover, several countries have limited pools within the residential units due to the economic & space constraints. As a result, the consumers in these countries rely on the public swimming pools. However, during the peak season, the pools become overcrowded and the quality of water in the pool becomes hazardous, leading to skin infections. This increase in viral infections is necessitating pool operators to use advanced filtration systems and cleaning chemicals, accentuating the market growth. Also, the ministries of Health of several countries are also laying standards & policies to ensure that the pool water quality is suitable for swimming. Thus, compliance with the regulations regarding water pH & alkalinity levels is compelling the owners to use cleaners & chemicals regularly, enlarging market size.\n\nFurther, consumers nowadays are taking swimming as a fitness activity since it helps in providing relief from stress. Along with this, sports enthusiasts are also practicing swimming for global sports events. Therefore, governments across the globe are constructing swimming complexes to train individuals for upcoming sports events such as the Olympics, and the Common Wealth Games. This surge in the development of the pools would continue to raise the demand for the equipment, like pumps, filters, etc., in the forthcoming years as well, further states the research report, “Global Pool Equipment Market Analysis, 2024.”\n\nGlobal Pool Equipment Market Segment Analysis\n\nIn-Ground Pools to Dominate in Forthcoming Years\n\nBased on the pool type, the market is further bifurcated into, In-Ground, and Above Ground. Among them, in-ground holds a prominent market share due to the availability of these pools in various modern designs. These types of pools have long-lasting structures, owing to which, the real-estate developers and builders tend to construct them within the residential & commercial units. Along with this, the in-ground pools’ could be customized based on the customer’s preference, unlike above-ground pools which are only available in oval & round designs.\n\nFurther, these pools are relatively more durable and have the capability of enduring poor & harsh weather conditions. Thus, consumers residing in areas prone to natural calamities generally prefer to build in-ground pools in their backyard, enhancing market growth.\n\nNorth America to Hold More Then 70% of the Market Share\n\nGeographically, North America holds a dominant market share owing to the presence of a large number of residential as well as commercial pools and the rising number of pool equipment manufacturers. The net disposable income of the individuals residing in the North American nations is relatively higher than the other regions. Owing to this, the consumers in these countries tend to live luxuriously. Thus, the houses & apartments built in the region are equipped with luxurious amenities, like in-built gyms, pools & spas. Further, the presence of the top companies in the region makes the products more accessible to the consumers, supporting the market growth.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nWith strategic initiatives, such as mergers, collaborations, and acquisitions, the leading market players, including Fluidra SA, Pentair Plc, WaterCo Ltd, Maytronics Ltd, Aqua Products Inc., Hayward Industries Inc., Zodiac Pool Systems Inc., CF Group, Desjoyaux S.A., Emaux Water Technology Co.
