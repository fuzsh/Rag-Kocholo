        "text": "Doheny's Shipping & Delivery Services\n\nFree Shipping Details\n\nDoheny’s Pool Supplies Fast has Free Shipping on orders over $100! This not only covers our brand name chemicals, but also our most popular swimming pool supplies. We do have a shipping charge of only $9.99 for orders under $50.00. For certain products, a freight charge may be applied.\n\nNext Day Delivery Details\n\nDoheny’s is pleased to offer free next day delivery at no additional charge for orders over $100 to most of the US for all Doheny's brand chemicals and many of our most popular swimming pool supplies. Next Day Delivery Service does not mean Next Day Air, but simply that your qualifying products will be shipped from the warehouse closest to you resulting in delivery the next day. We do have a shipping charge of only $9.99 for orders under $100.00.\n\nSome details regarding this service:\n\nOther than for Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, not all products are stocked at all locations and therefore not available for next day delivery. Only those items with a Next Day Delivery designation on the product page can be expected to arrive the next day and orders must be placed by 3 PM local time (exceptions include our Texas warehouse by 2:30 PM).\n\nIf you reside in the next day delivery area served by our Pleasant Prairie facility, order in-stock products and place your order by 3 PM Local Time you should receive your order the next day (except Saturday or Sunday). This applies to products even if they do not have a Next Day Delivery designation.\n\nBecause next day delivery is not guaranteed for standard service and residential deliveries are made only Monday through Saturday though Saturday delivery is not guaranteed, there is a chance that our product will not arrive the next day. While we try our best, unexpected demand can cause products to occasionally be out of stock or create a warehouse backlog that also can prevent shipment the day of the order."
