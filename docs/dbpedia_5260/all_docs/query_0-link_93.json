        "text": "The instructions for wiring a Hayward Salt Chlorinator (SwimPure Extreme) show connecting the black and white wires to the load side of the pump timer. That makes sense and would be easy, except I don’t have a standalone timer. I have a Pentair WhisperFlo variable speed pump hard wired into a circuit breaker and the pump has it’s own timer built in. I understand the Hayward salt chlorinator should only be able to operate when the pump is on. I am looking for advice on how to wire this setup. I could hard wire it into the circuit breaker except it would then always be on and I don’t want that. I am not sure that I could wire it through the pump such that it would only have power based on the when the pump’s timer turned on. I could isntall a standalone timer and set it on the same time sequencing as the pump, but that doesn’t seem ideal either. Any thoughts? Thanks, Tyler"
