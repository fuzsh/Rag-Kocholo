        "text": "The importance of quality pool equipment cannot be emphasized enough. Just like anything else, the brand you use can make a huge difference. If you are hesitant to build a pool because you have heard horror stories about the maintenance troubles and costs of owning a swimming pool, it is likely those individuals were sold an inferior or inadequate equipment package. Pool Concepts only uses industry-leading Pentair pool equipment on every project we complete, whether it’s a new build, repair, or renovation.\n\nRead on to learn why Pentair is a pool industry leader and why it should be your first choice when investing in your swimming pool.\n\nPentair Has a Decades-Long Track Record of Quality\n\nPentair was founded in 1966 and quickly gained attention for its efficient, high-quality products. By 1989, the company crossed the $1 billion milestone and has since expanded into multiple industries.\n\nThat kind of success doesn’t happen without a commitment to quality, innovation, and customer satisfaction. Today, Pentair provides high-performance, highly efficient pool equipment, water quality equipment, water supply and disposal equipment, and more.\n\nThe company is on a mission to inspire people to improve and enjoy their water, so they can live happier, healthier lives.\n\nPentair Has Been Recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency for Product Efficiency\n\nIn 2013, Pentair won the EPA’s Energy Star Partner of the Year Award for its high-efficiency pool pumps. Although these pumps may be a bit pricier than other brands on the market, they’re more efficient, more durable, longer lasting, and better for the environment.\n\nOver the long term, choosing a high-quality, highly efficient pool pump will actually save you money on your pool’s operational costs because it will use less energy to run. What’s more, quality products are less likely to break down prematurely. Ultimately, you’ll save on both energy and repair costs over the product’s life.\n\nPentair Pool Products Are Whisper-Quiet\n\nNobody puts a custom pool in their backyard with the intention of listening to a loud, annoying hum each time they head out for a dip or some poolside sun. Pentair knows that, and that’s why their pool pumps are whisper-quiet.\n\nWhether you want to kick back and relax in the sun or splash around with the kids, you’ll never have to compete with obnoxiously loud pool equipment when you choose Pentair.\n\nPentair’s Automated Equipment Makes Pool Ownership Easy\n\nWhether you want to control water sanitization and pH, the temperature of your pool, or your pool, spa, or outdoor lighting, Pentair’s smart control products make it simple.\n\nYou can monitor and control your pool equipment from inside your home, the office, or even a hotel room halfway across the world. Control your pool with Alexa, smartwatch, or smartphone and enjoy peace of mind you can’t get anywhere else.\n\nPentair’s smart pool automation equipment is compatible with any pool, and the company offers a wide range of products, from no-frills models to systems with every possible bell and whistle.\n\nPentair’s Advanced Heating and Chilling Methods\n\nThe temperature of your pool or spa water should either be a soothing or a refreshing experience after a long day, and keeping it at optimal levels means choosing the right heating and/or chilling source.\n\nFunctionality and energy efficiency are Pentair’s primary objectives. From gas to electric options, Pentair can provide performance you can count on."
