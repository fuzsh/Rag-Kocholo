        "text": "Pentair Kreepy Krauly Legend LL505G requires a booster pump (not included). Includes all hoses and back up valve.\n\nPolaris , Hayward or Letro booster pumps will work.\n\nComplete with 28' of hose and bag.\n\nThe Pentair Kreepy Legend is the pressure side pool cleaner that thousands of industry professionals have been waiting for. It comes with improved design features not found on competitive models and at a much better price. The double jet vortex venturi system gives a more powerful vacuuming action that will pick up the toughest debris. The vortex venturi jets are housed in a larger intake throat that will not clog like other cleaners and allows for easier pick up of very large leaves. Above the throat sits a patented duck bill valve that will not allow debris to escape when the power is turned off. The Legend was built to replace all pressure side cleaners used in gunite, Pebble Tech, Vinyl and fiberglass pools.\n\nLegend in action\n\n1 year manufacture limited warranty."
