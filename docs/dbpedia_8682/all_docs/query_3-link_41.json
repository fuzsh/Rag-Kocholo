        "text": "Through a discussion of Agnès Varda’s career from 1954 to 2008 that focuses particularly on La Pointe Courte (1954), L’Opéra-Mouffe (1958) The Gleaners and I 2000), and The Beaches of Agnes (2008), this article considers the connections between Varda’s film-making and her femaleness. It proposes that two aspects of Varda’s cinema – her particularly perceptive portrayal of a set of geographical locations, and her visual and verbal emphasis on female embodiment – make a feminist existential-phenomenological approach to her films particularly fruitful. Drawing both directly on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and on some recent film- and feminist-theoretical texts that have employed his insights, it explores haptic imagery and feminist strategy in The Gleaners and I, the materialization of space characterizing Varda’s blurring of fiction and documentary, and the dialectical relationship of people with their environment often observed in her cinema. It concludes that both Varda’s female protagonists and the director herself may be said to perform feminist phenomenology in her films, in their actions, movement and relationship to space, and in the carnality of voice and vision with which Varda’s own subjectivity is registered within her film-texts.\n\nSensuous theory has enriched the way in which we now analyze the multisensory film image as well as the embodied experience of the film viewer. Questions about the corporeality and sensuousness of the director, however, are addressed much less frequently from this perspective. Yet it is precisely this aspect that strikes me as particularly interesting, as it allows us to revisit the issue of the creative strategies employed by women in the cinema, and to pose questions about the meaning and status of the sensuous involvement of the female director in the production of her film. Does her corporeality, her physiological and sensory experience affect how the character are created, how the world is depicted, or, more significantly, the very matter of the film image? Can this involvement also become a conscious tactic of resistance against the dominant narrative and visual structures of “male cinema”? Taking these questions as my point of departure, I focus on the film of Agnès Varda The...\n\nIn her long-lasting career spanning more than six decades, Agnès Varda has created myriad works varying from short to feature, documentary to fiction, even some of uncategorised. Despite mostly regarded as hybrid, they are unswervingly revolving around two contexts: women and their experience of everyday urban life. Positioning within the main scheme of gender and urban studies, in the first part of this review study, I will try to shed a general light on Varda's peculiar feminine universe reflecting upon her filmography with references to her personal life and her films. The eclectic style of hers that is highlighted with the themes of versatility and reflexivity will be the main trajectory. In the second part, the act of walking as well as the act of looking; that is, her nomadic cinema and how she subverts the male gaze will be explored. Overall, while the portrayal of women in the works of Agnès Varda will be on the main agenda, through the perspective of her women who are always on move, who always transgress the boundaries and subvert the patriarchal discourses; the representation of the body, the notion of gaze and experimenting with city spaces will also be analysed.\n\nLe Bonheur, perhaps Agnès Varda’s most beautiful film, is also her most perplexing. The film’s insistently idyllic surface qualities, overtly beautiful imagery, and psychologically impenetrable, improbably content characters mystify and confuse. Of late, feminist scholars have clarified the situation, noting Varda’s incorporation of advertising and pop cultural visual rhetoric to implicate the social forces framing the picture and those insistently “happy” people: more like advertising ciphers than dramatic characters. Varda herself referenced Impressionist painting as a source of the film’s aesthetics. The purposes of this vivid, chromatic intertextual and intermedial source, in relation to the rhetoric of commercial and popular culture, demand attention. Varda studied art history and connected the milieu of Le Bonheur, the Parisian exurbs, their petit-bourgeois and workingclass populace, and bucolic leisure, artisanal and industrial settings, to the modernity of 19th-century Impressionism. Le Bonheur uses an Impressionist picturesque dialectically, in relation to a pop contemporaneity, to observe and critique an ideological genealogy of capitalism and its oppression of women.\n\nIn the art of cinema, which fulfills the function of a “dream factory” with its male-dominated narrative structure, men are represented in active roles with their actions, while women in passive roles that do not or cannot interfere with the flow of events with their inactions. This perception, which dominates the cinema, showed a change with the reflection of intellectual context of the Second Wave Feminism to the films. In this sense, in the study, Fried Green Tomatoes, regarded as a feminist film example by movie critics and directed by Jon Avnet in 1991, was chosen as a sample. In the study, structuralist narrative codes that construct meaning in the film are analyzed in the context of feminist thought and film theory paradigms. In the film, the “strong female character representations,” which are placed in the center of narrative and positioned to advance the story, are subjected in the foreground; these characters also stand against the known stereotyped roles imposed on women..."
