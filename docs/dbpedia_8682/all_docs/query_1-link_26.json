        "text": "YOU’RE A\n\nRISE AND SHINER\n\nSomeone who seizes the day and goes for high-energy fun.\n\n6am-11am: Try a hike up the nearby trails in the Santa Rosa Mountains, a 6:30am stretch class or an early round of golf at one of our legendary courses.\n\n11am-2pm: Grab a racquet and challenge a friend to a tennis match before your al fresco lunch at Centre Court Cafe. Afternoon is the perfect time to swim laps in our secluded lap pool.\n\n2pm-5pm: Why not treat those tired muscles to a massage at Spa La Quinta & afterwards relax with a cocktail at Plunge pool?\n\n5pm-’til you drop: Margaritas at Adobe Grill with award-winning tamales and chips, friends and music.\n\nYOU’RE A perfect\n\nPOOL HOPPER/EXTREME CHILLER\n\nYou have a deep desire to experience every pool and hot tub, not to mention sample every signature cocktail our bartenders have invented.\n\n6am-11am: Sleep, glorious sleep.\n\n11am-2pm: Ahhh. Slow, sleepy brunch. A quick pick-me-up mimosa. Then it’s off to the spa for a massage and a lazy day at Plunge pool or the Main Pool under a cabana. Might shop for a new swimsuit at the Top of the Plaza.\n\n2pm-5pm: You’re no slouch after all. There’s tennis, golf, badminton and jeep rides through the desert. Just don’t expect top-notch sports performances okay?\n\n5pm-9pm: Back in your element – darkness descending. Happy Hour margs at Adobe are amazing. So is dinner. And the music. Might not ever leave.\n\n9pm-Midnight: Your own private casita hot tub under the stars. Oh yes.\n\nYOU’RE A\n\nFAMILY FUNSTER\n\nThis is your long-awaited family vacation and you plan to have a blast together. And you also plan to take some grown up-time along the way.\n\n6am-11am: Breakfast is served for the whole family on your casita’s private patio. Now this is a vacation.\n\n11am-2pm: Family bike ride through the property. Then the big kids take off for tennis or golf lessons, while the littles get to go to Kids Kamp. And you two? You get an amazing massage at Spa La Quinta. Late lunch at Centre Court Café.\n\n2pm-5pm: Pool time in the Main Pool. It’s like magic. Everyone’s happy and you really don’t have to do a thing, except have fun and relax.\n\n5pm-9pm: You all love TWENTY6, and it’s burgers, steaks and salads galore. After there’s a Dive-In movie back at the Main Pool.\n\n9pm-on: The kids are dreaming about tomorrow’s fun while you’re sitting in your private hot tub under the stars with a glass and wine and your honey. Mission accomplished.\n\nYOU’RE the\n\nGREAT INQUISITOR\n\nVacations are for adventuring and learning new things.You feed your soul, then you get down to a great meal.\n\n6am-10am: The early bird catches the, well you get it. For you, greeting the sun with a yoga class is the perfect way to start your day. Then a brisk walk through gardens and citrus trees en route to TWENTY6 for healthy breakfast.\n\n10am-2pm: You discover a guided history tour about La Quinta’s storied past being offered by the concierge. Fascinating! Then you curl up with a book by one of the quiet pools.\n\n2pm-5pm: Well, part of being an explorer is shopping for keepsakes and good deals atThe Plaza. There is a wealth of possibilities here.\n\n5pm-9pm: You have been looking forward to a vintage cocktail and an epicurean feast at Morgan’s in the desert all day. It may take all week to sample all the choices on the menu and that’s exactly what you intend to do.\n\n9pm-on: A romantic stroll back to your casita and a nightcap outside perfectly caps off your day.\n\nYOU’RE A\n\nGOLF AFICIONADO\n\nThat was easy. You know exactly what you came to La Quinta for – championship-style golf, relaxation and fine food.\n\n6am-11am: During the summer months, the best times to get your golf fix in are early morning and late afternoon. La Quinta Resort & PGA WEST is home to five legendary courses, so every day of your stay, you can choose to play a different one, followed by a great breakfast at either Wallaby’s West or Ernie’s.\n\n11am-4pm: This is your chill time – jump in Plunge, our adults-only pool and cool off, enjoy a cocktail and relax. Or, go get those tired muscles a good massage at Spa La Quinta.\n\n4pm-8pm: Special summer tee-times available for longer summer days. You could get in another 18 holes.\n\n8pm-11pm: A big juicy steak is waiting for you at Morgan’s in the desert or at TWENTY6. Or go for South of the Border flavors at Adobe and sample a new tequila. It’s all good."
