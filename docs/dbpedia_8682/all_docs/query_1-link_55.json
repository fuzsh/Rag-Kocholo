Since the raw material of the cinema is emotion, film people are temperamental people. A director must be able to deal with temperament in others – and must know how to exploit it himself. (Basil Dearden 1948: 65-6) You cannot afford to make a picture unless you are madly enthusiastic about it. (Michael Relph, quoted in Films and Filming, January 1958: 5) I believe . . . that the Cinema is genuinely a mass medium and that it has social and educative responsibilities as well as artistic ones. It has a place to fill in the national life which it cannot do unless it works within the commercial structure which can give the artist the best tools to work with and allow his work to reach the widest possible audience. I believe this the most courageous course to take and one which can result from time to time in films of the highest artistic merit and integrity which, nevertheless, have wide popular appeal and commercial success. (Michael Relph 1961: 24) The beginning, like almost everything else about me, went back to the war.

Among our work colleagues we would like to thank especially the following: Steve Chibnall, for making available rare documents and illustrations from his extensive collection; Robert Murphy for his typically shrewd, nononsense advice; Andrew Tolson, for acting as Head of Department during the latter part of 2008; Stephen Barnard, Natalie Martin and Tony Lahive for teaching cover in the same period; and for vital and impeccable assistance we are indebted to Steve Gamble and Jo Hobbs in the Faculty of Humanities, De Montfort University. We have benefited greatly from interviews with cinematographer Douglas Slocombe and Lord Richard Attenborough, both in their time distinguished contributors to the cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph. Screenwriter and executive Bryan Forbes also treated our enquiries generously. We would like to express our appreciation to them for sharing their experiences of the films of Dearden and Relph and their admiration for the filmmaking team. Our greatest debt of gratitude is due to James Dearden and Simon Relph; for their unstinting enthusiasm for the project from the outset, generously making available invaluable recollections, family documents and photographs, and not least the remarkable collection of Final Shooting Scripts belonging to their fathers, which have afforded a unique insight into their approach to filmmaking.\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd vii\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe distinguished scholar of Ealing Studios, Charles Barr, offered important encouragement and guidance, and most helpfully saw us through some tricky bibliographic issues. Jeffrey Richards, Julian Petley and Mark Jancovich supported the project in its early stages, as did Max Jones, Laurie Ede, Dave Rolinson, Karen Shearsmith, Colin Sell, Andrew Spicer, Charlotte Brunsdon, Sue Harper and Vincent Porter in later moments of its development. Half of what follows, and the research and writing time it entailed, would not have been possible without the vital support provided by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the award of research leave to Tim O’Sullivan, which was both a relief and a challenge. The preparation of this book has also been greatly assisted by the professionalism and patience of Sarah Edwards and Esmé Watson and their colleagues at Edinburgh University Press. Alan Burton and Tim O’Sullivan Pörtschach and Leicester, February 2009\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd viii\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nForeword\n\nIt is very satisfying that a reappraisal of the films of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph is now taking place, in my opinion (not surprisingly) one that is long overdue. Alan Burton and Tim O’Sullivan have researched their subject with a great deal of care and a gratifying appreciation of their subject. What they are absolutely correct in establishing is the fact that the relationship was very much a partnership, every bit as much as, say, the partnership of Powell and Pressburger. Indeed, when my father was offered the job of directing the film of Khartoum relatively late in his career (1965), and despite the fact that there was already an American producer attached (Julian Blaustein), Michael Relph came on board as Production Supervisor, and one imagines that Michael’s contribution was very much on a par with those cases when he was also the titular producer. Apart from relying on each other creatively, I think that they also offered each other a great deal of emotional support, something not to be underestimated during such a long and productive association. It is telling, I think, that I have a distinct memory of my father being extremely unhappy during the shooting of Khartoum, admittedly a very difficult production from the logistical point of view, but I am sure due also in no small part to being outside his ‘comfort zone’ in the sense that Michael was not at his side with the same authority as would have been the case when they were the producing partnership with no one else between them and the studio. I think it is also interesting that the authors have highlighted the fact that my father’s films with Michael at Ealing were not accorded the same respect both internally (from the other filmmakers at the studio) and externally (by the critics). It is ironic that they were on the whole more commercially successful\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd ix\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nx\n\nForeword\n\nand certainly generated more income for the studio in view of their much greater output. Perhaps it was a mistake on my father’s part that he adopted a much less rigorous approach to his choice of assignment, preferring to keep working at all times, in a sense far more like a Hollywood director, perhaps also a reflection of the fact that he had come up ‘from the ranks’, cutting his teeth on Will Hay vehicles at a time when some of the other directors were still completing their degrees at Oxbridge. It is certainly telling that the Relph–Dearden partnership carried on long after the more fêted Ealing directors had ceased to make movies at all, unable to raise money or even function outside the cosy protection of Ealing. But it is also perhaps due to a lingering sense of frustration at their comparative lack of recognition that they focused on the liberal-themed ‘problem’ movies of what I would term their middle career. Indeed, I remember that fairly early in the Bond cycle my father was offered the opportunity to direct one of them and turned it down – to my horror, as a young boy and diehard 007 fan! When I asked him why, he said that he wasn’t interested in taking on such an overtly commercial assignment, so clearly he still felt the need to protect his recent and hard-won reputation as a ‘serious’ filmmaker. With hindsight, and certainly from the perspective of today’s marketplace, it seems an unwise career move, to say the least! The offer was certainly acknowledgement of his reputation as the consummate technician, a quality which would have gained him far greater appreciation in today’s world. *** I do think it was their misfortune to be a very successful part of the filmmaking establishment at a time when society was going through profound changes and throwing up its own home-grown version of the New Wave in the shape of the working-class dramas of filmmakers like Lindsay Anderson and Tony Richardson. They were there, in a sense, to be knocked down, their very ‘middle-classness’ a burden from which it was impossible to escape. And yet, once again, it is noteworthy that long after supposedly being consigned to history, their films remain both watchable and watched, while the great bulk of the output of those 1960s and 1970s directors who tried to replace them is both unwatched and in some cases literally unwatchable: the cinematic equivalent of flared jeans and elongated sideburns. The fact that their work survives so well is above all testament to their ability as storytellers, a never to be underestimated requirement for success as a filmmaker. What is also sometimes overlooked is that my father was extremely good with actors, due in part to his early experience in the theatre and indeed as an actor himself (though, by his own admission, not a very good one).\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd x\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nForeword\n\nxi\n\nIt is also perhaps a mistake to overemphasise their apparent lack of appreciation. The Blue Lamp won the award for best British picture in 1950 and Sapphire in 1959; the equivalent of two BAFTAs over a ten-year period – not a bad haul by any standards. So thank you Alan, and thank you Tim, for hopefully redressing the current imbalance and positioning Basil and Michael where they belong in the canon of British filmmakers. James Dearden\n\n___________________\n\nI am truly grateful to Alan Burton and Tim O’Sullivan for this reappraisal of the films that my father and Basil Dearden made together. Curiously, I was at university with Charles Barr, one of their severest critics, and at school with the younger brother of the other – Victor Perkins. Adrian Perkins, Norrie Boulting, John Boulting’s son, and I ran the school Film Society. Later, I became a devotee of Movie magazine and its passion for Fuller, Ray and other Hollywood auteurs. I am sure that the films of Relph and Dearden represented the establishment that needed to be challenged and to some extent overturned. Before long Tony Richardson, Karel Reisz and Lindsay Anderson came along to do just that. I joined the industry in 1961 at the very end of the studio system here, and for a brief time was an employee of the Rank Organisation. By this time my father and Basil were established independent producers who had to sell each film to their principal financier/distributors. They were in the second phase of the three careers that Alan and Tim identify in their introduction, between being employees at Ealing and finally making International films with the Hollywood studios. I was lucky enough to see the partnership at first hand because I served as second assistant director on two films: A Place to Go (1963) and The Mindbenders (1963). I concur that there was indeed a lot of the producer in Basil and as much of the director in my father, who, as the authors suggest, made a huge creative contribution. Sadly, when they reversed roles things never worked as well. Basil was incredibly efficient in the way that he used his time on the set, but that simply meant that he got more juice out of the orange than some of his peers who were less so. He liked adventurous set-ups and technical challenges,\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd xi\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nxii\n\nForeword\n\nbut above all he wanted control when he moved to the cutting room – not to be left without choice because there simply hadn’t been enough time. My father would always be there when a scene was set up and rehearsed, and between them they would agree the approach, then Basil would be left to get on with it; but in development and pre-production they were one, and equally, they worked very closely together in post-production. For two such different people they made an exceptional team and I believe had huge trust in one another. In the Ealing days they are accused of being undiscerning in their choice of material, but the fact is that they loved to be in production and they came up with more ideas than others. Equally, I am sure there were occasions when they would have accepted a commission from Balcon that others wouldn’t, simply to get him to agree to make something else dear to their hearts that he was resisting. Certainly, they were pragmatic in this way. Both of them grew up in an industry, a manufacturing industry where the product was film and you were judged first and foremost by the audience’s reaction. What is remarkable is that they started to tell stories that were way off the tried and tested. Even when they made what might seem conventional thrillers like The Blue Lamp, they told those stories differently, filming a great deal of them on location, which was new and unconventional. They tackled subjects like race relations and homosexuality, both under the cover of thrillers, but no one else at the time was addressing those issues in cinema and certainly not in what were intended to be popular films. What is remarkable is that so many of their films are still being screened regularly and it is pleasing that an eminent critic like my friend and fellow ‘Kingsman’ Charles Barr has accepted that some of his early judgements may have been a little harsh. It is important surely to judge the films of Michael Relph and Basil Dearden not for what they weren’t – the David Thomson, Victor Perkins line – but for what they were: mostly highly entertaining, often thought-provoking and sometimes original productions. Simon Relph\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd xii\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nBiography and Career Notes\n\nBas il De ar d e n Basil Clive Dear was born on 1 January 1911 at St Drostane, Woodfield Road, Southend, Essex (his surname was later extended to avoid confusion with his employer, the theatrical impresario Basil Dean). His father, Charles, was an electrical engineer who died tragically at sea during the First World War. This was a traumatic event for the young Basil, and the family was plunged into destitution. His mother, Dorothy, was left to raise the six children and the unfortunate Basil was placed in an orphanage, apparently on account of an uncontrollable temper. The family income derived mainly from the success of a younger brother, Peter, an extremely photogenic child actor who toured the halls and was at one point the poster boy for Pear’s Soap.1 These difficult early years clearly marked Basil, who in later life showed a great reticence to talk about his childhood.2 In later life Basil, unusually in the film industry, showed a lack of self-esteem; apparent when, in a rare moment of candour, the director confessed his insecurities to the actress Shirley Anne Field; explaining the enforced discipline he insisted on having on the set, he revealed: ‘I shout and scream because I’m afraid of everybody else. My job is to be in charge and run everything like a military operation.’ Referring to his experience in the children’s home, he added: ‘That’s the way I was brought up’ (Field 1991: 120). James Dearden believes that attention to this aspect of his father’s character has been overemphasised: I think the problem was more that he ended up overcompensating and appeared domineering, when he was in fact really a very kind and empathetic man, which not everybody got to see. Perhaps the greatest\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd xiii\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nxiv\n\nBiography and Career Notes testament to this is that in my own career I have met many studio technicians, often quite lowly, who would come up to me and tell me how much they had liked and admired my father and what a fair ‘guvnor’ he had been.3\n\nBasil had a very patchy education and was essentially a ‘self-taught man’. He first entered a London insurance company as an office boy, but eventually followed three of his siblings into the theatre. His initial stage experience had been gained during holidays in walk-on parts with the Ben Greet Company, and his theatrical career properly began when he joined the Grand Theatre, Fulham, London, as an assistant stage manager. Back with the Ben Greet troupe he combined acting and administrative roles during its Shakespearean tour of the United States. In 1932, he became production manager for the various theatrical enterprises of impresario Basil Dean. Dearden’s creative energies switched to cinema in 1937 when he joined Dean at Ealing Studios, the senior man having founded Associated Talking Pictures at the West London location in 1929. However, a reference in The Times suggests that Dearden briefly kept some connection with the theatre, as he was credited with co-writing the thriller Under Suspicion with actor Leslie Harcourt (15 December 1938). He immediately proved his versatility at Ealing, making contributions as dialogue director, writer, assistant director and associate producer. Within a year he was working with Ealing’s top comedy star, George Formby, serving as assistant director on It’s in The Air (1938) and Come On, George (1939). Under new studio boss Michael Balcon, Dearden contributed to the scripts and acted as associate producer on Formby’s Let George Do It! (1940), Spare a Copper (1941) and Turned Out Nice Again (1941); while he was raised to co-director on the films of the Studio’s new comedy star, Will Hay, with The Black Sheep of Whitehall (1942), The Goose Steps Out (1942) and My Learned Friend (1943). While routine genre films, these were crucial commercial productions for the Studio and an excellent opportunity to learn the craft of filmmaking. Basil Dearden was the only significant creative artist from the Dean era who developed a career under the new regime of Michael Balcon at Ealing. The other young film directors were generally recruited from the editing room and had enjoyed a university education, and Dearden’s natural shyness and distinctive upbringing reinforced his outsider status among his peers at the Studio. Dearden’s first solo work as director was a celebration of the wartime Auxiliary Fire Service, The Bells Go Down (1943). In this production he worked for the first time with art director Michael Relph, with whom he later formed a significant filmmaking team at Ealing, and the pair would become\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd xiv\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nBiography and Career Notes\n\nxv\n\nvirtually inseparable throughout their career. Relph continued to supervise art direction on all of Dearden’s wartime films, and with Ealing’s first post-war feature, the prisoner-of-war drama The Captive Heart (1946), the duo’s characteristic separation of responsibilities emerged: Dearden worked as director and Relph as associate producer, sometimes additionally serving as production designer, with both occasionally contributing to scripts. Their characteristic thematic concerns evolved out of Ealing Studios’ commitment to promoting the ‘people’s war’, and were encompassed within a broadly liberal outlook. Commencing with his wartime films, there emerged a consistent faith in the organic notion of society, composed of shared values, traditions and experience. In addition, the narratives favoured the virtues of public service and civic responsibility, wherein a range of collective heroes struggled tirelessly on behalf of the fire service (The Bells Go Down), the police (The Blue Lamp, 1950), the probation service (I Believe in You, 1952), juvenile liaison agencies (Violent Playground, 1957) and modern air services (Out of the Clouds, 1955). Dearden and Relph worked at Ealing until its closure in 1955, making the last comedy film produced at the famous studio, the unsuccessful Who Done It!, released in 1956. They also contributed the tragic-comedy Davy (1957, directed by Relph and produced by Dearden), made during the brief period when production was continued under the Ealing banner at MGM, Borehamwood. Dearden and Relph were given responsibility for Ealing’s first Technicolor film, Saraband for Dead Lovers (1948); however, as a team they did not undertake any of the classic comedies for which Ealing Studios became so renowned, and Dearden’s association with the ‘low comedy’ of the Formby and Hay years unfortunately seemed to contribute to a critical downgrading of their filmmaking. Their most important work from the late 1940s to the early 1960s has generally been claimed to be a series of social problem films. These were works dealing with such issues as rapprochement with Germans (Frieda, 1947), law and order (The Blue Lamp), the criminal justice system (I Believe in You – Dearden’s personal favourite among his films), disaffected youth (Violent Playground), race (Sapphire, 1959), homosexuality (Victim, 1961) and religious tolerance (Life for Ruth, 1962). In the event, there has been an overemphasis on this cinema of social problems and in fact only five of the Dearden and Relph films unequivocally dealt with social problems that troubled Britain in the post-war period. Such an inclusive critical view has, however, tended to obscure the commendable versatility of the partnership which also worked successfully and effectively within the genres of comedy, melodrama, contemporary drama and the noir thriller. However, Dearden and Relph’s contribution to the social problem film cycle was seen as outstanding and reflected in British Film Academy awards for best picture of the year for both The Blue\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd xv\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd xvi\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nMichael Relph and Basil Dearden: another première. (Courtesy of Simon Relph)\n\nBiography and Career Notes\n\nxvii\n\nLamp and Sapphire. In the early 1950s, Basil Dearden’s standing in the industry was reflected in his election to the Council of The British Film Academy, representative of the ‘senior film-makers of Great Britain’ (The Times, 30 July 1951 and 4 February 1952). After the continuity and security of Ealing, Dearden and Relph proved themselves as independent filmmakers, at one point helping initiate the Allied Film Makers collective for which they produced four films in the early 1960s. Dearden also directed some episodes of the television series The Four Just Men (1959–60), produced by former Ealing collaborator Sidney Cole, and formed with Relph a company to make TV commercials (Kinematograph Weekly, 15 December 1960). In the mid- and late 1960s, Dearden and Relph secured generous production finance from Hollywood companies seeking to expand into the British market. Several big-budget and elegant films emerged, but these have attracted little critical attention in contrast to those films more representative of the ‘swinging’ decade. As the prospects for film work began to dry up following the withdrawal of American finance, Dearden took on some of the early episodes of the prestigious TV series The Persuaders! (1971–72). Their final feature film, The Man Who Haunted Himself (1970), was tragically prophetic in its tale of a man who dies in a road crash. On 23 March 1971, Basil Dearden suffered multiple injuries in an accident on the M4 motorway near Heathrow Airport while driving back from Pinewood Studios to Chester Square, his Belgravia home. He was declared dead at Hillingdon Hospital, Hillingdon. He was sixty years old and survived by his actress wife Melissa Stribling, who had appeared in four of his films, and their two sons, James, who later developed a career in films, and Torquil. A memorial service, held at St Paul’s, Covent Garden, was attended by many former colleagues from the Ealing days, and a moving address was given by his long-time partner and friend Michael Relph. M ichae l R e l p h Michael Leighton George Relph was born at Riffelberg, Broadstone, Dorset, on 16 February 1915 and educated at the progressive Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight. George Relph, his father, was a distinguished stage actor and would later work with Michael at Ealing; while his mother, Deborah, was an Australian beauty of good family – her father was Attorney General of Western Australia – who had lost her heart to the handsome actor. George Relph, then enjoying considerable success in America, returned to Britain during the First World War to take a commission. At the Second Battle of Arras he was hit in the face and had to endure eighteen months of pioneering plastic surgery; sadly, George lost his matinée idol good looks and the\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd xvii\n\n26/10/09 13:33:56\n\nxviii\n\nBiography and Career Notes\n\nnatural confidence that went with them. Michael later recalled ‘the agonies that I went through on his behalf as he struggled with the insecurities of his profession during the years between the wars’.4 George and Deborah divorced when Michael was seven and he was given in custody to his father. His mother remarried into the Harker family whose considerable wealth derived from the famous scene painting business in Walworth; the youngest son, Gordon, became a popular comedy actor, later starring in the West End production of Saloon Bar, designed by Michael, and appearing as the taxi driver in Dearden and Relph’s Out of the Clouds (1955). The time spent at the Hampstead home of the Harkers and its legendary soirées, also later at Gordon’s house in Belsize Park, and other related theatrical gatherings, introduced Michael to an attractive world of wit, humour and sophistication. At the age of sixteen, Michael accompanied his maternal grandmother on a visit to her native Australia. The family owned three million acres of ranch at Pinjarra and the idea was for Michael to spend six months in the rough conditions of the sheep station to ‘toughen him up’. On his return to England, he tried his hand at commercial art, and despite introductions arranged by his parents to influential patrons, nothing came of this venture. Michael had vaguely harboured an intention of becoming an architect, following in the footsteps of his paternal grandfather, but the period of training was long, expensive and correspondingly unattractive. Through family connections, Michael was put forward for the new apprenticeship scheme at the GaumontBritish Studios at Shepherd’s Bush. As he was later to recount prosaically: ‘On a blustery Spring day in 1932, I lined up with forty other young men in Lime Grove – about to begin life in the film business’ (In Search of Skyhooks: 16). Other than highly successful periods as a theatrical stage designer in the late 1930s and 1940s, Michael would devote himself to British cinema for over half a century as a distinguished art director and producer. The apprenticeship allowed for considerable hands-on experience and the opportunity to learn from great artists like Alfred Junge who headed the art department at Gaumont-British. In 1936, Relph joined Warner Bros’. British operations at its studio at Teddington, working prolifically on a range of low-budget ‘quota quickies’ and rapidly gaining experience. When the studio temporarily ceased production during the crisis that beset the film industry in 1938, Michael turned to the West End and for a number of years prospered as a stage designer. It has been claimed that at one point there were seven West End productions running simultaneously with Relph sets.5 Michael Relph was ineligible for war service due to a leg injury sustained in a road accident, and in 1942 was taken on at the art department at Ealing Studios. He quickly rose to head the section and establish himself as a leading\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd xviii\n\n26/10/09 13:33:57\n\nBiography and Career Notes\n\nxix\n\nart director in British film. He first worked with Basil Dearden on The Bells Go Down (1943), a tribute to the wartime Auxiliary Fire Service, and further collaborated on Dearden’s The Halfway House and They Came to a City (both 1944); although undertaking a supervisory role for art direction across the Studio’s productions, he only personally designed one film outside of his emerging partnership with Dearden, the lively tale of the Victorian music halls, Champagne Charlie (d. A. Cavalcanti, 1944). Perhaps his greatest achievement in this period were his designs for Dead of Night (1945), an acclaimed portmanteau collection of supernatural tales directed by the cream of the young directors at Ealing, including Dearden. In 1945, Relph began a long production association with Basil Dearden, when he was promoted to associate producer on Ealing’s The Captive Heart (1946), a popular and critical success. He produced all of Dearden’s films at Ealing until its closure in 1955, and the partnership was the most prolific filmmaking team at the Studio; Relph worked only once without Dearden, as associate producer on the classic Ealing comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets (d. R. Hamer, 1949). Periodically, Relph also designed the productions, most notably Saraband for Dead Lovers (1948), a sumptuous costume drama for which he received an Academy Award nomination. In the late 1950s, Relph turned his hand to directing, with Dearden acting as his producer on Davy (1957), Rockets Galore! (1958) and Desert Mice (1959). However, the experience only revealed a modest talent and he reverted to his former roles. Relph clearly played a crucial part in steering the partnership into successful independent production after the demise of Ealing. Initially, the team struck out with Rank, and in time would distribute through Allied Film Makers, Bryanston, United Artists and Paramount; marking an uninterrupted creative period of filmmaking untypical within British cinema. At the time of Dearden’s tragic death, the partnership had a number of projects in the pipeline; although the early 1970s was a period of great uncertainty in the British film industry, there was no reason to believe that their reputation and experience would not have taken their careers much further. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Michael Relph served diligently as an elder statesman of the British film industry. He became a governor of the British Film Institute in 1972, at the same time succeeding Michael Balcon as chairman of the Institute’s Film Production Board (The Times, 5 July 1972); while Relph also acted as Chairman of the Film Production Association of Great Britain and later the British Film and Television Producers’ Association, proving a highly vocal spokesman on the thorny issues of government support for an ailing national film industry and proper remuneration for cinema producers for films broadcast on television (The Times, 30 October 1973, 30 November 1973, 8 July 1981).\n\nM1930 - BURTON PRELIMS.indd xix\n\n26/10/09 13:33:57\n\nxx\n\nBiography and Career Notes\n\nMichael Relph with his father, George, on the set of Davy (1957) (Courtesy of Simon Relph)\n\nHe returned to production in the late 1970s, becoming involved with Don Boyd’s Company, Triarch Productions and Kendon Films, and such releases as Scum (1979), An Unsuitable Job for a Woman (1982), Heavenly Pursuits (1985) and Torrents of Spring (1989).

Dearden and Relph: Authorship and British Cinema\n\n[Dearden’s] films are decent, empty and plodding and his association with Michael Relph is a fair representative of the British preference for bureaucratic cinema. It stands for the underlining of obvious meanings, for the showy resort to ‘realism’, for the middle-brow ticking off of ‘serious’ subjects, for the lack of cinematic sensibility, for the acceptance of all the technical shortcomings of British productions, for the complacent description of problems and the resolute refusal to adopt critical intelligence for dealing with them. (David Thomson 1980: 137) Until we have a more detailed picture of the roles of direction within the collaborative and hierarchical interactions that constitute film production, the figure of the director, for all the critical value assigned to it, will remain something of an enigma. (Peter Hutchings 2000: 188) The films of Basil Dearden and his producing partner Michael Relph have for too long been treated as exemplars of a safe, unimaginative and essentially dull British cinema. So, while problem pictures like Frieda (1947) and Victim (1961) have been acknowledged for their worthy liberal statements, the stifling requirements of balance and fair play, coupled with a perceived cautious cinematic treatment, are seen to deaden and defeat any effectiveness such films might offer. In the early 1960s, when a new generation of thrusting young critics set out to proclaim a cinema of auteurs, it was largely on Hollywood that they set their sights, resolutely turning their backs on their own national film industry, which was dismissed out of hand as inept and completely lacking in any artistic sensibility or merit. The scorn of the Movie critics was levelled in particular at Basil Dearden, the filmmaker who most ‘typifies the\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 1\n\n26/10/09 13:34:26\n\n2\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph\n\ntraditional Good Director’: ‘in the schematic nature of his subjects; in the appalling performances he draws from good actors; and in his total lack of feeling for cinema’. The avowed polemical aim of the reviewers was to ‘shout loud the names of the hacks they despise’, and this was zealously pursued (Perkins [1962] 1972: 11).1 The following generation of writers on British cinema in the 1970s generally distanced themselves from out-and-out auteurism. Whereas previously Dearden had been placed in the spotlight – simply for critical demolition – he now receded into the background, merely the conduit for a style and narrative ideology determined by an industrial context. As such, Dearden didn’t evaporate, but was reconfigured as the archetypal ‘company man’, an essentially colourless, almost ‘robotic’ technician, valued only within a discourse of professionalism. In his seminal studies of Ealing Studios, Charles Barr marked Dearden as a central member of the ‘Team’, considering his work as ‘constituting an Ealing norm or baseline’ (1977: 72); such was his snug fit with the normative values of the Studio. Similarly, for Roy Armes, Dearden ‘formed the backbone of Balcon’s production’, the Studio’s most prolific filmmaker, one who bent amenably with the prevailing winds, and as a result was ultimately lacking in any ‘satisfying consistency’ (Armes 1978: 182–3). Late in the decade, a retrospective season of Dearden and Relph films was held at the National Film Theatre, but even here, in an act of critical celebration and reclamation, the conventional hallmarks of ‘professionalism’, ‘craftsmanship’ and ‘social awareness’ were reasserted and trotted out, and their cinema presented in that most damning of critical terms: ‘interesting’. Considering the entrenched disregard of film criticism for the national cinema, it was damning with faint praise to claim the films of Dearden and Relph as some of the most ‘truly English pictures of the post-war period’ (NFT Programme, February 1979: 18). In the 1980s, critical emphasis shifted once again, and the partnership’s social problem films became the focus of enquiries into ideology and representation. In their day, pictures such as I Believe in You (1952), Violent Playground (1958), Sapphire (1959) and Victim were seen as daring, even taboobreaking; but in a climate informed by a New Leftist rejection of the liberal dream that conflict can be resolved by good sense and reason, such wellmeaning sentiments were subjected to critical approbation. For John Hill, for instance, the problem pictures were ‘dramas of social control’, seeking only to contain the troubling excess of sex and violence that marked the post-war settlement through a ‘reduction of sensation’: ultimately working to fit aberrant individuals and groups into the social order (1986: 94). This was exemplified in the ‘hegemonic project’ of Victim, the film simply reproducing the ‘liberal heterosexual consensus’ towards homosexuality as embodied in the Wolfenden Report (1957) (Dyer [1977] 1993; Medhurst [1984] 1996).\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 2\n\n26/10/09 13:34:26\n\nIntroduction: ‘Two on a Tandem’?\n\n3\n\nThe only sustained dissenting view regarding the cinema of Dearden and Relph came from the maverick critic Raymond Durgnat, who charted a highly personal and idiosyncratic course through post-war British film. In a challenging, insightful and iconoclastic article published in Films and Filming, Durgnat characteristically went against the critical grain when he boldly asserted that the Dearden–Relph partnership ‘constitutes an auteur, in every sense as distinctive and interesting as many of the American directors currently enjoying rediscovery’ (1966: 26). He proposed the filmmakers as ‘moralists of the social relationship’, a kind of inverted Howard Hawks, and saw no reason to deny a Dearden and Relph cult as a moral balance to the one attached to the celebrated Hollywood director. A decidedly non-polemical critic, Durgnat was at least receptive to and in tune with the achievements and potential of the national cinema. While hardly finding their films faultless – he wearied of ‘the same heavy, solemn tone, and the same cautious refusal, so exasperating to many critics, to be radically more “progressive” than the middle-class public is’ – he could still claim that Sapphire, Victim and The Mind Benders, ‘loom among the best British films of the ’50s [sic]’ (26–7). Durgnat’s more sympathetic view of Dearden and Relph was developed and extended in the 1990s. Significantly, Charles Barr, adding some retrospective comments to the second edition of his Ealing Studios, now claimed that the partnership were ‘worth foregrounding as Ealing contributors’ on the same scale as writer T. E. B. Clarke, and directors Robert Hamer and Alexander Mackendrick (1993: 187). He now recognised the need to move beyond the polemic of Movie which posited Dearden as representative of everything that was worst about British cinema, as well as his own previously ‘patronising’ and ‘glib’ treatment of the director, and ‘affirm that the pair deserve more credit than the book gives them for knowing what they are doing, at two interconnected levels, those of ideas and of cinematic form’ (ibid.). Later in the decade, leading writers on British cinema were invited to review the cinema of Dearden and Relph, and the published anthology of work broke new ground in the treatment of the filmmakers: reassessing their work at Ealing; examining the comedy films of Basil Dearden and the art direction of Michael Relph; bringing a fresh view to their better-known films and introducing some of the marginal titles to critical attention; and mapping their cinema in terms of its portrayal of men and women (Burton, O’Sullivan and Wells 1997). And, more recently, Martin Hunt has challenged the established view that the documentary realism absorbed and perpetrated by Ealing ensured a ‘bland’, ‘flat’ and ‘drab’ visual style. On the contrary, he discerns a degree of ‘formal and stylistic adventure’ at Ealing, most notably in the cinema of Dearden and Relph, and finds in Frieda (1947), ‘the beginning of an experimentation with elements of content, form and style which Dearden and\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 3\n\n26/10/09 13:34:26\n\n4\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph\n\nproduction partner Michael Relph were to integrate with increasing success as the years and films progressed’ (Hurt 2002: 263–4).2 Despite the defensible criticism that the study of British cinema is not well served by the folly of auteurism,3 there has recently emerged a fairly robust interest in the figure of the director within what has been termed the ‘New British Film History’.4 In a series of commentaries on authorship and British cinema, Peter Hutchings has usefully set out a productive reconciliation of auteurist and industrial imperatives. He has claimed of this work: Ultimately, what I want to argue is that thinking about authorship and the role of the director has the potential to benefit our understanding both of British cinema and of the methods we use to make sense of it. (2001a: 30) Hutchings rejects the past excesses of auteurism, but warns that ‘ignoring or dodging round the issue of the director’s role and contribution can lead to the neglect of an important level of creative agency within the British film industry’; the aim should be to sketch in a way of thinking about a British film director where ideas of authorship are significant but do not wholly define or limit the sorts of questions we can ask of the material and where different ideas of authorship can emerge. (2000: 180) The view being promoted in these writings is that criticism should be sensitive to the precise industrial context within which the profession of directing is practised, and that a discussion and evaluation of a director’s films needs to be matched to precisely where the filmmaker was in the industry when directing them (2001b: 20–30). This more flexible, interactive approach to filmmakers offers a productive critical framework for this re-evaluation of the cinema of Dearden and Relph as they moved through different hierarchical, collaborative, historical and creative contexts. In contrast to a static and ‘elitist’ conception of authorship, an ‘industry-specific’ model allows us to see with greater clarity the achievements and progression of Dearden and Relph from their contributions as a director–producer team within the institutional context of Ealing, to the flexible responses demanded by independent production in the late 1950s, and finally accommodation with the new market conditions thrown up by the 1960s and the inflow of American capital into the British film industry. Hutchings has also rightly asserted that director studies should be sensitive to the different levels of ‘managerial control’ possessed by filmmakers. As he points out:\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 4\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\nIntroduction: ‘Two on a Tandem’?\n\n5\n\nDirectors can differ from each other not only on the basis of their ‘creative personalities’ (however one might define this) but in a more materialistic way in the range of responsibilities and activities which their jobs entail, with some directors having much more control than others over their films. (2001a: 35) This observation is especially pertinent to Dearden and Relph, who managed an enviable degree of production control across all three phases of their career: as a stable director–producer team at Ealing; as independent producers backed by leading distributors in the British film industry; and as independent filmmakers working in Britain, financed by powerful Hollywood companies. For some, the prospect of any real ‘managerial control’ for filmmakers at Ealing would seem unlikely, especially for Basil Dearden, who is usually configured as the archetypal ‘company man’, the director always at his happiest while working and most likely to pick up the projects avoided by more discerning filmmakers. However, with the formation of the director–producer partnership with Michael Relph on the highly successful The Captive Heart (1946), the team, by all accounts harmonious, mutually supportive and complementary, at least could present a united front to the executives and financiers who planned production and guided the Studio. Neither Dearden nor Relph harboured romantic notions about unfettered creative freedom for the film artist; in fact, they were essentially pragmatic in their approach to cinema and in these terms actively sought ways to reconcile the imperatives of industry and art.5 Significantly, the dispersal of talents within the team did not fall into a simple and typical director-artist and producer-manager division: producer Michael Relph was clearly the more artistically accomplished of the two, having headed up art direction at Ealing for several years; while director Basil Dearden held a lifelong respect for the operational side of filmmaking, in the process developing an unsurpassed reputation for professionalism and budgetary reliability – ironically, qualities that eventually harmed his critical reputation.6 Dearden provided a clear and eloquent appreciation of the dialectic between ‘economics’ and ‘aesthetics’ in an article published in 1948, where he encapsulated the creative tension inherent to film production in the provocative if oxymoronic formulation ‘organised inspiration’. He saw the film director as ‘the driving force behind the industrial machine’, engaged in a ‘struggle between material problems and matters of taste and intuition’, and was confident that ‘Inspiration can be disciplined and organised’. Such thinking was the direct result of pre-planning for efficiency on Saraband for Dead Lovers (1948), the most expensive film produced at Ealing at that time. The aim was to ‘harness inspiration to efficient production methods’ through the extensive use of ‘set-up\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 5\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\n6\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph\n\nsketches’, where the film’s action could be inexpensively rehearsed in drawings. Such a potentially restrictive procedure was embraced by Dearden, no doubt because he was secure in his relationship with his production designer and producer Michael Relph, and confident that they could work in a fully supportive and complementary manner. The director wrote in praise of ‘prefabrication’ and further revealed his appreciation of the commercial imperatives of cinema - but strictly employed without loss of ‘artistic value’: There is no doubt that more preparation which results in less shooting time on the floor will reduce costs. If a film can be made in two weeks less time, then the saving can be between twenty and thirty thousand pounds – the difference in some cases between profit and loss. Profit means further pictures in the future, loss – less pictures being made. (1948: 65–7) This is not the kind of toadying response that seems implicit in some of the standard critiques of Dearden, but rather a more considered and experienced reaction to the overall dynamics of filmmaking. It is also an indication of the measure of ‘managerial control’ that Dearden and Relph exercised at Ealing, for there is little evidence that the ‘system’ was imposed from above, but rather embraced and developed within the team of director, producer and sketch artist-co-scriptwriter Alexander Mackendrick, an approach that was responsive both to the commercial demands of production and, at the same time, sensitive to the creative imperatives of the drama.7 Michael Relph also trenchantly set out his thinking on the roles and responsibilities involved in filmmaking; his comments are revealing, in terms of how he understood both the producer–director relationship with Dearden and the wider relationship of his role as associate producer with the nominal producer at Ealing, head of production Michael Balcon. He invoked a military analogy to express the overall production situation, believing that the creation of a film ‘called for detailed strategic planning which yet allows scope for tactical improvisation’. In this scenario, ‘The director is the tactical commander in control of the army in the field – the actors and technicians on the studio floor’; whereas ‘The producer is the strategical commander in control of the conception as a whole. He must see that the director is serviced with the money, personnel and equipment he needs’. In the most original part of this formulation, he alludes to a role which perhaps had a particular bearing on the relationship he developed with Dearden: [The producer] is also, however, in strategical command of the film from an artistic viewpoint. It is easy for the director, confronted with practical difficulties of shooting, and working with the comparatively\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 6\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\nIntroduction: ‘Two on a Tandem’?\n\n7\n\nblunt instrument formed by a hundred or so actors and technicians, to lose sight of the artistic proportions of the film as a whole. These will have been previously determined by the producer, director and writer, and the producer must see that the director brings their joint conception to the screen. He must know the capabilities of his director, choosing a story that will exploit his talents and not expose his weaknesses. He must be constantly at hand to guide and advise, yet must avoid interference with the director’s creative freedom within the strategic concept. (1954) Within the larger framework of continuous production at Ealing, Relph equated the role of the Head of Studio to that of commander in chief, and acknowledged the ‘enormous artistic contribution’ they can make in addition to their primary executive function (The Times, 2 January 1954). Relph retained a respect for Balcon’s stewardship of the Studio, but like many associate producers at Ealing, bristled at the producer credit claimed by the Head of Studio on each film. His preferred label for the function that Balcon fulfilled was ‘impresario’, but in later years he acknowledged that associate producers and directors were greatly protected from the boardroom battles doggedly fought by Balcon and Peter Baker with such formidable opponents as John Davis of the Rank Organisation (Relph 1990).8 Relph firmly believed that the associate producer performed a creative role at Ealing, and that there were opportunities to subvert the ‘official’ view as sanctioned by the ‘front office’. He was convinced that Balcon ‘was often ignorant of the machinations of the film makers in persuading him to put the studio’s resources behind a particular project’ and that the canny ‘young creative team of film makers who cross-fertilised their ideas over a great many years’, ‘devised ways of getting round Balcon’s prejudices or became expert in producing ideas which catered for his restrictive preferences’.9 Of course, a central tenet of the auteur theory as it developed was the supposed creative tension that existed between the auteur and the system, the genuine auteur being in conflict with the production context and ultimately defined by a resistant transcendence of the debilitating commercial framework. However, such a simplistic polarisation of energies never reflected the real world of film production and certainly doesn’t explain the careers of Dearden and Relph at Ealing. For example, Balcon always had a preference for stories about men – his favourite productions were The Captive Heart, Scott of the Antarctic and The Cruel Sea – and this was echoed in the team he built around him, not least Dearden and Relph. Equally, the wartime period largely witnessed the filmmakers in close accord with the direction in which Balcon was taking the Studio in response to the emergency. But even here, we argue, films like The\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 7\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\n8\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph\n\nHalfway House (1944) and They Came to a City (1944) were highly distinctive articulations of Ealing’s wartime social message. The formal experimentation that emerged in these films was developed and extended in the team’s post-war cinema, and it is the series of melodramas that included Frieda (1947), Saraband for Dead Lovers and Cage of Gold (1950) that bear witness to the kind of subversion that Relph alludes to. The decline at Ealing in the 1950s witnessed fewer films of achievement and critical value, and probably the highest proportion of productions that Dearden and Relph took on to service the needs of the Studio. But even here, there is interest in films of modest ambition like The Rainbow Jacket (1954), Out of the Clouds (1955), Who Done It? (1956) and Davy (1957), especially in their points of intersection with the broader contours of the cinema of Dearden and Relph, such as post-war masculinity and comedy, that deserve recognition and comment.10 The post-Ealing period of filmmaking saw Dearden and Relph assume a much greater degree of ‘managerial control’ over their cinema as independent producers, although the realities of the marketplace always ensured degrees of compromise and containment.11 There were, for example, difficulties with the distributor, Rank, over the controversial race drama Sapphire (1959), and a number of abandoned projects that resisted the will of the filmmakers and their potential backers. In the uncertain conditions of late 1950s British cinema, Dearden and Relph sought actively to create and preserve space for intelligent British filmmaking and were on the board of the Bryanston collective of filmmakers, linked with the distributor British Lion; while the team was central to the collaborative Allied Film Makers Group, linked to Rank, and seeking a measure of protection for artistic integrity and continuity for production.12 As the prospects for production declined in Britain in the early1960s, Dearden and Relph were in the vanguard of filmmakers who sought deals with the major Hollywood companies. Rather than being swallowed up by American capital, the partnership secured remarkably generous and unrestrictive arrangements, whereby finance and distribution were guaranteed by United Artists and later Paramount. Dearden and Relph retained an impressive degree of ‘managerial control’ over these films, essentially acting as an independent production team, acquiring rights to properties, writing or contributing to scripts, and generally exercising autonomy over production as long as they remained within budget – a faculty over which they remained past masters. The degree of control exercised by Dearden and Relph over their filmmaking and their lengthy careers in British cinema allowed for a remarkable continuity of approach and the freedom, from time to time, to express long-standing interests and concerns. It also meant that the producers could engage favoured artists and technicians when available, and cinematographers Douglas Slocombe and Otto Heller, composer Philip Green, editor\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 8\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\nIntroduction: ‘Two on a Tandem’?\n\n9\n\nJohn D. Guthridge and actors Mervyn Johns, Dirk Bogarde, Bernard Lee, Bill Owen and Richard Attenborough made significant contributions to their films. Regardless of the critical reception of their films, the cinema of Dearden and Relph, as it traversed the volatile and shifting contours of film production in Britain, offers the historian significant and invaluable insights into the contexts of British filmmaking in the post-war decades. Viewed from a perspective within the British film industry, Basil Dearden eventually became a highly respected director, a thoroughly experienced professional, and daring, committed and courageous with the challenging problem pictures that he made in collaboration with Michael Relph in the 1950s and 1960s.13 For most of his time at Ealing he seems to have been treated with snobbish disdain, dismissed as a throwback from the Basil Dean era at the Studio, with an unfashionable background in theatre and lacking an Oxbridge education.14 Such a view was compounded by Dearden’s association with low forms of comedy on the George Formby and Will Hay films he made at Ealing in the early war years, something that was simplistically absorbed into the wider critical thinking about the filmmaker.15 Untypically, Relph also had a background in theatre and this gave him a strong affinity with the young director; it was at the urging of Cavalcanti that the two were paired as a team, the Brazilian having recognised during the production of The Halfway House that the designer had such a beneficial influence on his colleague.16 In turn, Relph was impressed by Dearden’s control of actors and the mechanics of scene construction; he believed the director to be ‘very cinematic in this respect’ and ‘technically . . . far in advance of all the other directors at Ealing’.17 However, he recognised that ‘His attitude to subjects was really that of a technician as opposed to a genuinely creative artist, and anything that he could see an interesting way to treat technically he was prepared to have a go at’ (1997: 243). Relph would supply the additional artistic credentials. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe regarded Dearden as the most ‘competent’ of all directors at Ealing; a filmmaker always immaculately prepared and invariably sure about how he was to proceed. Consequently, Dearden got through more set-ups per day, shot films much more quickly than other directors and always brought films in on schedule – and sometimes in advance of the deadline. The acclaimed cameraman retained great respect for the director and saw no reason why his professionalism should be equated with ‘dullness’ (2007). Actor Richard Attenborough readily declared himself ‘devoted’ to Dearden and fully endorsed the view of the director as the complete professional: a ‘really distinguished director’, a filmmaker always ‘meticulously prepared’, an object lesson for aspiring filmmakers. Attenborough was also impressed by Dearden’s handling of actors, believing he loved actors and the art of acting, although the\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 9\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\n10\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph\n\ndirector had little patience for unprofessionalism and performers who turned up late or forgot their lines.18 There was never such a thing as indecision on the set, Dearden exuding a reassuring (or intimidating) authority and the sense that he would get precisely what he was after (Attenborough 2008). William Pay, the London editor of Motion Picture Herald, observed Dearden at work on The Man Who Haunted Himself (1970) and largely confirmed the view of the director as diligent, organised, focused, if a little remote: Dearden brings a business-like approach to his film-making. At work on the set, he talks quietly but incisively, a man who has done his homework and knows exactly what he wants in this shot, the next shot, the one after that. Once committed to the making of a film, he thinks of little else. Intervals in shooting find him either discussing the next scene with his actors, or prowling endlessly into the far corners of the studio. Constantly aware of precious, expensive minutes ticking by, he finds the inevitable small hold-ups in production frustrating and says so as incisively as he gives instructions to his players. Shy, reserved once off the set, Dearden is sometimes thought to be remote. That may be a matter for individual speculation, but one thing there is no doubt – his dedication. (22 October 1969) The quality of commercial and industrial ‘professionalism’, and the dissipating tendency of ‘versatility’, have been invoked by critics to beat Basil Dearden; while conversely, elsewhere, they have also been central to the praise for his contribution to national film production. These two perspectives, the critical and the industrial, have traditionally been separated and opposed; however, it is possible, as Hutchings has suggested, that a reconciliation can be achieved and a clearer appreciation of the team’s filmmaking attained through attention to the significant matter of the ‘managerial control’ that the Dearden and Relph team exerted over their filmmaking. Dearden’s reliability and competence meant that Michael Balcon retained considerable faith in the filmmaker, the only survivor among the directors from the pre-war Dean era. The valuable service that Dearden performed for the Studio does not mean that he should simply be dismissed as a ‘yes man work-horse’; his talents and strong personality, allied to those of his dedicated producer, ensured that theirs was a significant creative presence at Ealing and beyond, responsible for a cinema that was commercially efficient, artistically accomplished and socially aware. In light of this, the following study takes a close look at the films of Dearden and Relph, sensitive to the particular contexts of production and criticism, yet alive to the artistic, cinematic and dramatic accomplishments of many of the films. In short, it seeks to investigate the fallout from the historical clash of ‘organisation’ with ‘inspiration’.\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 10\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\nIntroduction: ‘Two on a Tandem’?\n\n11\n\nThe book does not follow a simple chronological treatment of each production; rather, it groups films into discrete themes, allowing for a clearer focus on the main preoccupations and achievements in the cinema of Dearden and Relph. New attention is given to the importance of comedy in the career of Dearden, while emphasis is also placed on the art direction of Relph, providing a balance rare in the treatments of the team. Dearden and Relph first collaborated in the war years; a period that had a lasting impact on their filmmaking and during which they made a significant contribution to the developing ethos at Ealing. The war years established Dearden and Relph as important filmmakers and informed many of their responses to the post-war world in terms of masculinity and social adjustment. The wartime films are therefore crucial precursors to the mature cinema of Dearden and Relph and treated here in their formative nature. A considerable number of Dearden and Relph’s post-war films concern male characters forced to confront a painful adjustment to new circumstances and social norms. One strand of these ‘Dramas of Social Adjustment’ observes a tragic dimension as the male characters respond to significant post-war realignments in gender and the anxieties confronted by men in changed circumstances; while a second strand constructs an alternative trope for dealing with the central issue of post-war masculine adjustment, posing narratives of men in action, with the male characters asserting (or reasserting) their masculinity through professional physical action and usually in the male group. Masculine purpose and identity is reinvigorated or rediscovered through the reconstitution of wartime experience; and the crisis is transgressive, tempting the men towards crime in an attempt to rediscover excitement, re-establish male bonding and challenge the perceived feminisation of society after the war. Similarly, the team’s celebrated problem films are separated into two distinct types: five films that address genuine issues that were popularly accepted as contemporary social problems: race, delinquency and sexuality; and a further four films that are separated out from the social problem films by virtue of their attention to individual characters confronting acute ethical decisions rather than problems shared across society. Distinctively, they represent substantial emotional dramas concerning national identity, the politics of terrorism, religion and the abuses of modern psychology. Finally, the study brings a wholly new attention to Dearden and Relph’s films of ‘The International Years’ of the1960s. The films of the final decade are the most unconsidered of the team’s work and the study offers a valuable opportunity to assess these neglected productions. Produced for American companies, they demonstrate Dearden and Relph’s standing by the 1960s as commercial filmmakers and, while often being dismissed as bloated international puddings, further confirm the filmmakers’ professionalism, adaptation to new production contexts and ease with big-budget action films and international stars.\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 11\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\n12\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph note s\n\n1. Critics like Derek Hill, writing for Tribune and Films and Filming, were already deep into their crusade against British filmmakers; see Hill’s demolitions of Dearden and Relph’s Out of the Clouds (1955) and The Ship That Died of Shame (1955) (Films and Filming, April 1955 and June 1955). While the British Film Institute’s Monthly Film Bulletin could only rarely find a good word for a Dearden film throughout the 1950s and 1960s. 2. We shall argue that this experimentation can be traced earlier to The Halfway House (1944) and Dead of Night (1945). 3. See Vincent Porter’s thought-provoking review of our earlier Liberal Directions, where he states: ‘Commercial filmmaking is not an individual activity, and critics impose criteria of personal creativity on an industrial artform at their peril’ (Porter, 1999: 158). 4. Apparent in the British Film Makers series commissioned by Manchester University Press, which so far includes studies of Lance Comfort (1999), Jack Clayton (2000), J. Lee Thompson (2000), Launder and Gilliat (2002), Michael Reeves (2003), Terence Fisher (2001), Joseph Losey (2004), Roy Ward Baker (2004), Terence Davies (2004), Carol Reed (2005), Derek Jarman (2005), Anthony Asquith (2005), Sydney Box (2006), Karel Reisz (2007), Mike Leigh (2007) and Michael Winterbottom (2009). 5. Ealing employed a little over 400 staff, and as social democrats, Dearden and Relph felt a concern about continuity of production at the studio less as a service for capital and more in sympathy with the workforce. See the producer’s comments in Relph (1990; 1997: 244) and ‘Inside Ealing’, reprinted in the Appendix to this volume. 6. A hopelessly romantic David Thomson sees no virtue ‘in that a film was completed at 5.30 on the proper day with the due number of tea breaks. Dearden’s coming in on time is replete with the obedient, leaden dullness of British studios’ (1980: 137). 7. Significantly, for the argument being developed here, Saraband was one of the greatest artistic achievements of Dearden and Relph. Looking back on the role of the director in the production context at Ealing, Mackendrick revealingly recalled: ‘We weren’t paid much but we had the advantage of being very free’ (quoted in Ellis 1975: 92). 8. See Relph’s ‘appreciation’ of Balcon which appeared in Sight and Sound (Winter 1977/78). Here, Relph also revealingly places the Ealing operation ‘under the microscope’. For an interesting impressionistic look at production at Ealing, see Tynan (1955); while scholarly accounts of the production process at Ealing and their concomitant tensions are presented in Ellis (1975), Porter (1983) and Harper and Porter (2003). 9. The views are expressed in ‘Inside Ealing’, reprinted in the Appendix to this volume. 10. Taking one simple example of the accord between filmmaker and Studio, Dearden seemed to relish the freedom and technical challenge of shooting on\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 12\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\nIntroduction: ‘Two on a Tandem’?\n\n13\n\nlocation; while Ealing tended to promote this aspect of production due to the relative smallness of the stages at the studio. See Ellis (1975: 90). 11. Of this period of transition, Relph later recalled: Basil and I were lucky . . . because we did manage to go very quickly into the Rank set-up and I think we had kept a little more contact with the rest of the industry; but most of the others from Ealing were fairly ignorant of all that was going on outside. Our own policy of making a lot of films did pay off then, in a way. One was better equipped for the outside world than some of the other people who had led an excessively sheltered existence. (Brown 1981: 211)\n\n12. The formation of AFM was reported in the following terms: ‘The advantages to the members of Allied are two-fold – complete freedom in production and choice of subject members want to make (Rank has promised a no-interference policy) and, by personal distribution, a much larger slice of the profits . . . if the films are successful’ (Films and Filming, January 1960). 13. The status of Dearden and Relph was acknowledged in two Best British Film awards from the British Film Academy, for The Blue Lamp (1950) and Sapphire (1959). The partnership was also honoured at the 1959 Versailles Film Festival where their body of work was awarded the Golden Sun Award by the French Society of Cinema and TV Writers. 14. The other young directors at Ealing were largely university-educated with backgrounds in the wholly cinematic field of editing. 15. The ‘outsider’ status of Dearden seems to have also been reflected in the fact that he did not participate in the lengthy drinking sessions at the Red Lion pub opposite the studio, and lighting cameraman Douglas Slocombe remembers him as a bit of a ‘loner’ (2007). Relph, however, was a habitual member of the drinking fraternity (see ‘Inside Ealing’, reprinted in the Appendix to this volume). 16. In a later interview, Relph described the circumstances thus: Cavalcanti was very much aware I think of what I contributed as an art director to the pictures I did with Basil Dearden. He thought that Basil had certain strengths but that there were artistic qualities that could be supplied by me. That’s why he took me from being an art director and made me a producer to work with Basil. (Brown 1981: 201)\n\n17. Relph (1990) believed that the lack of experience with actors was a problem for most of the other directors; a situation confirmed by Douglas Slocombe (2007), who found that Dearden had a confidence and ease on the studio floor far in advance of the other directors at Ealing. 18. There are some lingering accounts of Dearden being a martinet or even a bully on the set, possibly perpetrated by those who fell foul of his demanding standards. See Derek Bond’s comments on filming The Captive Heart (1946), where he claimed the director tried to do a ‘Monty’ and nearly brought the extras drawn from the Black Watch regiment to mutiny (1990: 177). Shirley Anne Field also found the director intimidating; that is until in a rare moment he let his defences down and confessed his insecurity (1991: 117).\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 13\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\n1 Apprenticeship and Beyond: Comedy Traditions and Film Design Dearden–Relph and the Tradition of Film Comedy The Black Sheep of Whitehall (1941); The Goose Steps Out (1942); My Learned Friend (1943); Who Done It? (1956); The Smallest Show on Earth (1957); Rockets Galore! (1958) and Desert Mice (1959) The state of nations can best be judged by their ability to laugh at themselves. (Ian Johnson, Films and Filming, March 1963) Dearden and Relph, both separately and together, regularly worked in a comic vein. As well as making numerous outright comedy films, the filmmakers brought a measure of humour to several of their action films, thrillers and dramas, titles like The League of Gentlemen (1960), Man in the Moon (1960), Masquerade (1965), Only When I Larf (1968) and The Assassination Bureau (1969). This was a common commercial approach within British cinema in the period and was, moreover, a distinctive aspect of the films they made together. Michael Relph consistently praised Basil Dearden’s technical skill as a filmmaker, believing that this was nowhere more evident than in his handling of humorous material; he was, according to Relph, ‘very expert at directing comedy’ (Relph 1997: 246). Furthermore, this was acknowledged within the film community generally, demonstrated in the case of the successful producer–director team of Launder and Gilliat inviting Dearden to act as mentor to the novice director Robert Day on their production of the comedy The Green Man (1956). It is also significant that two of the three films directed by Relph, Rockets Galore! and Desert Mice, were comedies; while his own directorial debut, the tragic melodrama Davy (1956), featured much comic business. During his period of acting as assistant to Basil Dean at Associated Talking Pictures (ATP), Dearden gained his first substantial experience of film on the\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 14\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\nApprenticeship and Beyond\n\n15\n\nGeorge Formby comedies, acting as assistant director on It’s in the Air (1938) and Come On, George (1939) (Chatten 1997: 267). At this time, Formby was the most popular British star and his films the most commercially successful productions at ATP. Like many of the comedy series produced within British cinema, the Formby films were steered by a core creative filmmaking team: writer-director Anthony Kimmins, producer Jack Kitchen, cinematographer Ronald Neame and art director Wilfrid Shingleton. This was a comedy masterclass for Dearden to cut his teeth on and was undoubtedly a significant influence on him. The Monthly Film Bulletin praised Come On, George as ‘Formby fun at its best’, and there was much from which Dearden could learn and absorb (6: 61/72, 1939: 200).1 On at least one occasion, Dearden worked outside of Ealing, co-scripting the box-office success This Man is News (1938), produced by Anthony Havelock-Ellis at Pinewood and which aped the comedy-thriller style of MGM’s popular Thin Man series (1934–47). On the outbreak of war, Kimmins and Kitchens were lost to the services and the recently arrived studio boss Michael Balcon looked around to put together a new team for producing the crucial Formby films. He hired as director the highly experienced Marcel Varnel, who had worked at Gainsborough on the popular Will Hay and Crazy Gang comedies. Seeking a measure of continuity, Balcon promoted Dearden to a more creative role, allowing him to contribute to the scripts and act as associate producer on Let George Do It! (1940), Spare a Copper (1941, d. John Paddy Carstairs) and Turned Out Nice Again (1941), the final three films Formby made at Ealing before moving to Columbia.2 The measure of Balcon’s success can be gauged from a review appearing in The Times, which observed that ‘The structure of Mr George Formby’s films do not alter very much, and the same blue-print which has done serviceable work in the past was taken out of its drawer for the making of Spare a Copper (17 March 1941). It was relatively easy to fit the Formby films into the new demands thrown up by the war: whereas George had typically had to overcome rogues and villains in his 1930s films, these were now simply replaced by spies and saboteurs. This accommodation had already been rehearsed in It’s in the Air, which had the gormless character join the RAF in the period leading up to war. Let George Do It! involves the unwitting George thwarting Nazi agents in Norway; while Spare a Copper locates him on Merseyside as an eager war reserve policeman bringing a nest of saboteurs to book. However, audiences quickly tired of war-related stories, and Turned Out Nice Again reverted to the traditional formula of Formby trying to get on in an everyday world that conspired against him, this time as an overseer in a northern underwear factory, and the film is notable for its relentless extraction of the maximum innuendo offered by this subject.\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 15\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\n16\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph\n\nIn the early period of the war, the importance of humour slowly became recognised as crucial for maintaining morale and Mass Observation issued a number of reports suggesting the need to counter anxiety and depression through comic relief (Richards 1986). Let George Do It! was the first comedy produced at Ealing to deal directly with the war and it remains Formby’s best wartime film, a pleasing blend of comedy, thrills and music, becoming the box-office hit of August 1940. The film was the object of a special Mass Observation study, which revealed many fascinating details about the critical and public response, including the view that the press, traditionally hostile to low comedy, generally found this Formby’s best film to date (Richards and Sheridan 1987: 331–49). Let George Do It! was also a textbook example of the propaganda film that fell foul of rapidly changing circumstances, with its fantasy of the witless George dealing with Nazi spies in neutral Norway being overtaken by events as the Wehrmacht occupied the country with relative ease in the spring of 1940. This led some critics to view the production as tasteless and to question who would get most comfort from the film – the British or the Germans – especially as this was compounded by the notorious dream sequence that had George floating across to Germany in a balloon and administering a thrashing to that old ‘windbag’ Hitler (The Times, 15 July 1940).3 Overall, the Formby films made at Ealing remained escapist commercial successes and attracted respectable enough notices from critics, who would never accept them as demanding entertainment. The Monthly Film Bulletin, for example, found Spare a Copper a ‘good Formby film . . . with a better story than most’ (7: 73/84, 1940); while The Times was encouraged that Turned Out Nice Again lessened the emphasis on slapstick to reveal a ‘sound sense of straightforward comedy’ (30 June 1941). It had been easy to fit the Formby persona into the requirements of wartime propaganda as the character was essentially a consensus figure, and whether it was the Great Depression or the Second World War, George could be relied on to cheer up the nation and embody the fight of the common people (Richards 1984: 191–206). Balcon added to the studio’s roster of traditional comedians when he brought Will Hay to Ealing in 1940.4 Marcel Varnel was retained to direct The Ghost of St Michael’s (1941), which had Hay in his familiar role as the inept schoolmaster, this time exposing a nest of traitors while serving with a school evacuated to Scotland. Dearden was once again detailed to act as associate producer. While the film got some good notices, the Monthly Film Bulletin judging it a ‘good story, well-directed . . . and as admirable a cast as could be found’ (28 February 1941), the production appears rushed and stagey, borrowing heavily from that old warhorse of comedy theatre The Ghost Train, which Hay and his writers had previously plundered in the classic Oh, Mr Porter! (1937). In a significant move, and part of a wider strategy of promotion\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 16\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\nApprenticeship and Beyond\n\n17\n\nwithin the ranks of the Studio’s personnel, Balcon raised Dearden to director on three of the remaining Hay vehicles, The Black Sheep of Whitehall (1941), The Goose Steps Out (1942) and My Learned Friend (1943).5 Hay was credited as co-director on these features, but this was a professional courtesy extended to the star and it can be assumed that Dearden took overall responsibility for dealing with the creative technicians and staging the action.6 The Black Sheep of Whitehall is a distinct improvement on the previous Hay film, the direction and narration being both more dynamic and cinematic.7 The confined staging of The Ghost of St Michael’s is replaced by a fast-moving and freewheeling comedy ranging over a large number of sets and locations as Hay confronts a Nazi plot to derail a crucial trade agreement with South America.8 Many of the reviews commented on the admirable pace of the comedy: Kine Weekly declared it a ‘Riotous comedy extravaganza’ (20 November, 1941); while the Monthly Film Bulletin praised it as a ‘rollicking, fast moving film, full of amusing situations and good slapstick’ (30 November 1941). The writers were applauded for scripting an inventive and topical comedy, special praise being offered for the pointed satire made of government bureaucracy and the BBC; scenes in which Hay, a disreputable principal of a correspondence college, is mistaken for a distinguished professor of economics who is to oversee the treaty, and is called on to make a radio broadcast in which he reduces the complex interplay of trade between Portugal and Brazil to simply that of port and nuts – and Epsom salts.9 For Paul Wells, this first directorial outing reveals that ‘Dearden is especially drawn to the use of mistaken identity or disguise as a means of disrupting narrative orthodoxies and creating humour which has a plausible framework, yet implausible outcomes’. As such, he sees Dearden’s ‘special and overlooked skill’ as ‘his ability to stage and choreograph sequences in a way in which the premises of the plot quickly and efficiently serviced the creation of comic events’ (1997: 41–2). The Goose Steps Out similarly deploys Hay against Nazism, this time as a dissolute master of German in a minor English school, who, through his uncanny resemblance to a Nazi agent, is parachuted into the heart of enemy territory to masquerade as a trainer of spies while seeking to locate and pilfer a new bomb. While fanciful, even within the flexible terms of the genre, the film has much fun at the expense of German authoritarianism and the leadership cult of the Führer. The reviews were mixed. The Monthly Film Bulletin found the film ‘patchy’, but ‘reasonably good fast fun all the same’ (30 September 1942); while Kine Weekly was more critical, berating it for an overall lack of originality and for stooping to ‘cheap and obvious’ laughs. The trade paper did single out, though, the ‘glorious sequence’ in which Hay instructs his German pupils to give Hitler a vulgar version of the V for Victory sign (20 August 1942). Film Report applauded the execution of the slapstick scenes, especially\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 17\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\n18\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph\n\nthe thrilling climax aboard an aeroplane bound for England, which it found ‘brilliantly handled’ (21 August 1942). Clearly, though, critics were beginning to tire of comedians making easy fun of a dunderheaded enemy, an approach based on the ‘threadbare and insupportable supposition that the Nazis are easily gulled’. As the reviewer concluded, ‘Experience has, unhappily, proved that it takes more than an exuberant application of the ridiculous to kill Nazis’ (Kinematograph Weekly, 20 August 1942).10 One difficulty for the Studio was that it was problematic to mobilise the Hay persona for war work. Steven Allen has recently argued that, unlike Formby, Hay was not a figure of consensus; on the contrary, his character stood for dissension, exhibiting qualities of ineptitude, dishonesty and corruptibility. Hay’s classic 1930s comedies had\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 18\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\nApprenticeship and Beyond\n\n19\n\nheld up the Establishment to ridicule, and far from offering consensus, ‘the films intimated a nation riddled with division, disharmony and self-interest’ (2006: 255). Formby’s honest ambition could be wholly embraced within the struggle for national survival; whereas Hay’s ‘disreputable combination of Dickensian fruitiness and Greenian seediness’ (Durgnat 1970: 172) was an ill-fit, and could account for the comparative lack of critical interest in the comedian’s propaganda films for Ealing. Hay’s final film for Ealing abandoned the tired formula of war propaganda for a fresh and artful comedy of murder. My Learned Friend went into production towards the end of 1942, but suffered some delays due to the deteriorating health of the comedian. It finally wrapped in April 1943 and proved to be the star’s last film.11 Following the trade show in July 1943, Kine Weekly embraced the comedy as a ‘sparkling antidote to wartime worries’, expressing the general sentiment that comedies should distance themselves from the day-to-day concerns of the war (15 July 1943).12 Elsewhere, the comédienoire attracted mixed reviews, and there was little sense that this film was an improvement on its predecessors. Film Report thought the story was ‘novel’, but that it lapsed into ‘puerility’, with the humour becoming ‘feeble and laboured’ (30 July 1943); while Monthly Film Bulletin was enthusiastic about the film’s craziness and fun, praising it as ‘a farce in the best and most violent tradition’ (10: 109/120, 1943). In retrospect, My Learned Friend is the best of Hay’s Ealing films, displaying a more timeless appeal against the rather forced attempts to straitjacket comedy with propaganda in the previous productions. The visual texture of the film is much denser, courtesy of art director Michael Relph, who rises above the merely functional efforts of Wilfrid Shingleton and Tom Morahan on Hay’s other Ealing films.13 There is also a more fulfilling role for Claude Hulbert, who had been used fitfully in The Ghost of St Michael’s, but here, as usual, playing his archetypal silly-ass character, is deployed as a fitting sidekick for the mature comedian. The unusual subject of My Learned Friend, a comedy of serial killing, has meant that the film has attracted some subsequent critical attention. Murphy claims it the one film equal to Hay’s best work at Gainsborough; while Seaton and Martin admire its ‘ingeniously contrived screenplay and literary wit’ (1978: 172); and for some critics it now appears a precursor to the classic Ealing comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets (d. R. Hamer, 1949) (Everson 2003: 333–4).14 Dearden had played a significant role in nurturing traditional comedy at Ealing in the early war years, and with My Learned Friend had graduated to directing a recognised classic of the form, a fitting finale for a legendary British screen comedian. Curiously, Dearden would not be involved in any further outright comedy for over a decade, and the golden age of Ealing comedies, which saw the production of such classics as Passport to Pimlico (d. H. Cornelius,\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 19\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\n20\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph\n\n1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (d. C. Crichton, 1951) and The Ladykillers (d. A. Mackendrick, 1955), would pass the filmmaker by.15 In the winter of 1954, it was announced that T. E. B. Clarke had written a film especially for comedian Benny Hill (Kinematograph Weekly, 16 December 1954).16 Production\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 20\n\n26/10/09 13:34:27\n\nApprenticeship and Beyond\n\n21\n\ncommenced in August the following year on Who Done It? (1956), for which Dearden was assigned as director; a columnist at To-Day’s Cinema thought it a shame that the director had ‘delayed so long in once again bringing his talents to bear on comedy’ (10 October 1955). It was announced in October 1955 that Ealing Studios had been sold to the BBC, which would take vacant possession in the New Year. However, Who Done It? would be completed at the Studio and be among the last batch of films distributed under the longstanding arrangement with the Rank Organisation (The Times, 20 October 1955; Kinematograph Weekly, 9 February 1956). The film was released in the wake of a tremendous upsurge in popularity for British film comedy; the 1954 annual round-up of the trade paper Kinematograph Weekly listing Doctor in the House, Trouble in Store and The Belles of St. Trinian’s as the biggest box-office attractions of the year and each initiated a series (16 December 1954). Sadly, the last film comedy to come out of Ealing Studios failed to repeat the success of its rivals – ‘nearer run-of-the-mill Wisdom than vintage Ealing’ in Durgnat’s view (1966: 31). There had been considerable expectation for a comedy written by the distinguished Clarke and featuring the popular TV and variety comic Benny Hill.17 Accordingly, The Evening News predicted it to be one of the comedy successes of the year (15 March 1956); while the Manchester Guardian believed it ‘may well make a lot of money’ (17 March 1956). Some reviews felt the film to be an artful exercise in the absurd, that the filmmakers had ‘put on a fine demonstration of calculated chaos incorporating nearly all the traditional devices of slapstick, from banana skins onwards’ (Daily Mail, 16 March 1956). The Monthly Film Bulletin bemoaned the rather ‘desperate script’, but still found the film ‘considerably more amusing than any other recent vehicle for a new comedian’, with Clarke providing some ‘agreeable satire’ to punctuate the slapstick (March 1956). However, for many critics, it was another irredeemable example of low comedy. ‘For custard-pie-throwing addicts only’, warned the Sunday Dispatch (18 March 1956); ‘A sad bundle’, mulled The Sunday Times (16 March 1956); and ‘one of the last scrapings of the Ealing barrel before the studio was sold to the BBC’, cruelly interjected the Daily Worker (17 March 1956). Who Done It? has been virtually ignored by film historians and generally regarded as an unwelcome throwback to the film comedies of old. George Perry finds the film, along with several of the Studio’s late comedies, a ‘real embarrassment’ (1985: 125); while Geoff Brown curtly dismisses it as a ‘tepid farce’ (1984: 17). The style of the comedy, with its emphasis on slapstick, mistaken identities, silly disguises and the centrality of the comic’s performance, puts the film squarely in the former tradition of comedian comedy practised at Ealing and Gainsborough in the 1930s.18 The casting of old stagers like\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 21\n\n26/10/09 13:34:28\n\n22\n\nThe Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph\n\nGary Marsh and Charles Hawtrey, who had appeared in Formby and Hay films worked on by Dearden, seemed to confirm the anachronism of the film. Similarly, the plot of the film, which has Hill as a hapless private eye embroiled with foreign agents scheming to control the world by manipulating the weather, harked back to the cinema of the 1930s. Paul Wells has warned, though, that such a comedy style contextualised within the mid-1950s has a different import and meaning; noting that the traditional slapstick humour is contemporised and extended, and developed in line with a satirical treatment of new technologies and more self-conscious construction of character and performance. Such an approach to comic construction is distinguishable from the earlier style of pre-war comedy: The jokes need no longer reinforce an assumed consensus in the audience, but operate as mechanisms in their own right, seeking out multiple senses of humour. Such an approach recognises increased social fragmentation and disparateness in the postwar world; the individual had become a verifiable social phenomenon, while community was in a state of erosion. Dearden thus shows ‘Englishness’ in a process of change in the face of new social structures and their attendant humours. (1997: 50; emphases in the original) Dearden demonstrates a sure touch in constructing the comic business, especially impressive being the culminating chase sequence, which ranges across London’s streets, the National Radio Show at Earl’s Court and a stock car derby, which occupies a full twenty-four minutes of screen time; however, Clarke’s script lacks sparkle and originality, and Hill is unable to transfer his star power from the small to the large screen. There are some conventional digs at the new leisure rival of TV, but this is never developed into a serious satire; and one promising aspect, the physical superiority of the leading female character over the male hero (Belinda Lee, who makes her living with a strongwoman act), is totally effaced by her overwhelming desire for conventional romantic love and submission. In the uncertain period after Ealing had left the village green studio and joined forces with MGM at Borehamwood, Dearden and Relph tentatively embarked on independent production, striking a brief relationship with the producer–director team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat to work on two comedies at Shepperton Studios.19 In an unusual arrangement, Dearden supervised former camera operator Robert Day on his first directorial assignment, The Green Man (1956).20 As Frank Launder later recalled: Bob Day was too inexperienced to handle this type of comedy as a first effort, though he later became a capable director. So we brought in Basil\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 22\n\n26/10/09 13:34:28\n\nApprenticeship and Beyond\n\n23\n\nDearden, who although he did not receive a credit either supervised or personally directed a great deal of the film. (Brown 1977: 138)21 Day commented on the arrangement at the time, confessing that ‘it is impossible to have two directors handling every scene, so Basil is actually handling them and I contribute ideas and make suggestions’; adding, ‘Basil Dearden has taught me quite a lot, particularly about floor control’ (Kinematograph Weekly, 12 April 1956: 35, 41). The film was a solid popular success and was immediately followed by The Smallest Show on Earth (1957), which began production in August 1956 with Dearden directing and Relph producing. This production had much of the feeling of Ealing about it: the script, dealing with a young couple (Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna) who inherit an ancient flea-pit cinema, was provided by studio regulars William Rose and John Eldridge; the film was shot by ace Ealing cameraman Douglas Slocombe; and the story displayed the characteristic thematic contrasts of new versus old and small versus big.22 The film, therefore, has that curious distinction of being Dearden’s ‘Ealing comedy’.23 This conundrum has tended to confound critics who respond to it as a curio, somehow out of place and out of time. For instance, James Chapman comments on The Smallest Show on Earth as ‘insignificant, a mere trifle’, lacking Dearden and Relph’s ‘serious themes and contemporary relevance’, not seeming to ‘anticipate any future developments’ or reflecting ‘anything which Dearden and Relph had done before’. Such a view over-attends to the cinema of social problems associated with the filmmakers and ignores their long experience working in comedy. After all, this was Dearden’s third comedy in succession (including The Green Man), and Relph was about to embark on the tragic-comedy Davy, which he followed in quick succession with two more comedies. Viewed like this, The Smallest Show on Earth is anything but an aberration. The reviews were mixed, The Times admiring the film’s eccentricities, quaintness and humour (15 April 1957) and Kine Weekly enjoying a ‘good humoured parody’ on the film business (28 March 1957). But a typically sour Monthly Film Bulletin found the film a rather poor example of conventional British screen comedy, with stock characters and situations, and “straight” leads who don’t quite know whether to play it straight or comic; and are as much out of their depth either way. (April 1957) ‘Basil Dearden directs with a heavy touch’, complained Films and Filming, ‘No good joke (and there are one or two) is allowed to rest until it has been repeated, wrung out dry, then finally trodden underfoot’, although the\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 23\n\n26/10/09 13:34:28\n\nM1930 - BURTON TEXT.indd 24\n\n26/10/09 13:34:28\n\nBasil Dearden with the cast of The Smallest Show on Earth (1957) (Courtesy of Simon Relph)\n\nApprenticeship and Beyond\n\n25\n\nreviewer was forced to admit that the film ‘has a good heart’ (June 1957). There was widespread praise, though, for the performances of Peter Sellers, Bernard Miles and Margaret Rutherford as the decrepit staff of the Bijou Kinema, each having the gift of ‘making absurdity and pathos momentarily indistinguishable’ (Monthly Film Bulletin, April 1957). The Smallest Show on Earth was a considerable commercial success and is now a fondly remembered minor classic of British screen comedy, fascinatingly suggestive of the clash between nostalgia and modernity that characterised the post-war period. Dave Rolinson has recently suggested that the defining theme of 1950s British film comedies is ‘consensus and its breakdown through the alienating individualism of consumerism’; and the resultant tensions are evidenced in the film’s satirising of both cinema exhibition and Ealing whimsy (2003: 87). A similar inflection is offered by Wells, who stresses that ‘modernity had the effect of mobilising a middle-class nostalgia for sociable humour rooted in a working-class ethos’ and that Dearden’s 1950s comedies were an attempt ‘to look at humour in the ways in which it expressed contradiction’ (1997: 45–6). Christine Geraghty has suggested that 1950s British cinema offered a problematic representation of itself, usually in ambiguous and self-deprecatory ways. She stresses the recurrent image of the unruly audience in the Bijou, and for an industry in decline this was a version of cinema that was both unsustainable and undesirable. In this sense, it is telling that when the modern young couple get their hands on the money from the sale of the Kinema to the owner of the rival Grand cinema (through highly suspect means), they leave not only the exhibition industry but also the country (2000: 18–19).24 The distinctive style and themes of this comedy have led critics to seek p"
