        "text": "A History of ICAHD UK 2003-2019\n\nICAHD UK\n\nIn September 2003 explorations began with the idea of establishing a support group in the UK for the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, based in Jerusalem, and founded by Dr Jeff Halper and Dr Meir Margalit in 1997.\n\nICAHD was appreciated because it represented a unique voice of the Israeli “left” that not only worked on the issue of Israel’s demolition of Palestinian homes (a focus for activism) but which was also a “big picture” organisation that wanted to end the Occupation with a win/win solution for both Palestinians and Israelis, based on international law. It was felt that ICAHD’s familiarity with the realities on the ground gave it unmatched authority in its frequent contacts with diplomats, politicians, NGOs, the religious community and the international media.\n\nA bank account was opened in February 2004. Membership was offered for 6 years with a fee of £100. Soon there were 30 members which enabled ICAHD UK to to have enough money to plan an offical launch and Jeff Halper was brought to London for it to speak to politicians, academics and the general public.\n\nThe first official event was a fund-raising evening held on 21st June 2004, at Southside House, Wimbledon. Speakers included William Dalrymple, Ghada Karmi and Jeff Halper. The formal launch of ICAHD UK was on 22 June 2004 in Portcullis House, Houses of Parliament, at a reception hosted by Crispin Blunt (Conservative), Richard Burden (Labour), Menzies Campbell (Lib Dems), and Ernie Ross (SNP). The event attracted 150 attendees composed of MPs, Peers, researchers, NGO representatives and ICAHD UK members.\n\nAt the formal launch of ICAHD UK its aims were announced as follows:\n\nRaise funds in the UK to support ICAHD’s work in Palestine/Israe\n\nDisseminate information in the UK about the situation on the ground in Palestine\n\nLobby and influence the UK Government and the European Union on behalf of the Palestinian people\n\nBe a source and forum for new ideas on how to resolve the Palestinian/Israeli conflict\n\nFollowing the events in London, Jeff proceeded to Leeds and Birmingham where he was hosted by our members for public meetings.\n\nBy the end of 2004, ICAHD UK had attracted 80 members. It was given a small office in the premises of Medical Aid for Palestinians for a peppercorn rent. An ICAHD UK Chair was appointed and Rebecca D’Cunha (later to become Director of the Greenbelt Festival) volunteered a few hours a week to work as the administrator.\n\nICAHD UK’s Early Years\n\nFund-raising for ICAHD was facilitated through “house parties” following a model that had been created in the US. Hosts invited friends over for a meal (often serving Palestinian food) that was followed by showing the 27-minute ICAHD film Resisting Demolitions on the Ground. It included footage of ICAHD resisting a demolition and later ICAHD rebuilding the Palestinian home. Jeff Halper is interviewed and ICAHD maps explained. A few years later, the demolition statistics in the film were updated by ICAHD USA and the length reduced to 23 minutes. At the end of the evening a collection was taken for ICAHD. The film proved more successful in raising funds in the States compared to in the UK nevertheless it was a valuable resource. Other funds for ICAHD were raised during UK speaking tours arranged for ICAHD staff which were scheduled an average of twice a year. Sometimes Jeff was invited to participate in events in the UK sponsored by other organisations, so his visits were more frequent.\n\nDisseminating information happened through the preparation of hardcopy leaflets, flyers, post cards and posters specifically for use in the UK. In the main these were about Israel’s demolition of Palestinian homes in violation of international law. Resources prepared by ICAHD – booklets, maps, photographic exhibitions and Obstacles to Peace: A Re-Framing of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, written by Jeff Halper with maps by Michael Youkan and PalMap were also used. ICAHD UK also had additional salable resources made such as mugs, greeting cards and mouse mats to help raise awareness. Newsletters were prepared for our members and a website was created. When Jeff Halper was in the UK, meetings were also arranged for him with journalists and this often resulted in mention of ICAHD in the mainstream media.\n\nObstacles to Peace has been a core resource and has been updated several times over the years with the latest version printed in May 2018. The 2005 edition states that the publication grew out of tours of the Occupied Palestine Territory given by ICAHD for diplomats, journalists, study missions and activists. It presents a “grounded analysis” of the Occupation, the immediate source of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. It describes Israel’s complex “Matrix of Control”; it examines the ideological underpinnings and military logic of Israeli expansion; it addresses the issue of terrorism and resistance; it asks what will happen if the Occupation becomes irreversible; it suggests the outlines of a just peace; and it offers practical steps to mounting effective international campaigns. A primary goal of this publication is to “reframe” in a way that balances Israel’s concerns over security with its accountability as the Occupying Power. The Occupation presents a profound challenge to all of us who aspire to a world based on international law and universal human rights. This publication is intended to empower you to act together with us. Israelis and Palestinians seeking a just peace.\n\nLobbying has been an essential part of ICAHD UK’s work. It has been easy to gain access to members of Parliament and the Foreign Office because it represented a critical Israeli voice which parliamentarians, researchers, civil servants and diplomats were eager to hear. Until then most of the lobbyists were either Zionists or Palestinian voices. ICAHD UK sought to arrange meetings for other ICAHD staff in addition to Jeff Halper whenever they were in London so much lobbying happened during this period. ICAHD UK lobbied all political parties and, on several occasions, the All-Party Group on Palestine, chaired by Richard Burden MP, hosted the meetings.\n\nPresenting the bigger picture with the elements required for a just and sustainable solution was presented as much as possible. ICAHD rhetoric is not “pro-Palestinian” nor “pro-Israeli” but “pro-human rights” based on international law. In general, most other NGOs working on this issue are charities with a humanitarian focus. ICAHD UK has always wanted the freedom to be a political organisation with the ability to speak about ethnic cleansing, Israel’s growing apartheid policies over the Palestinian people, violations of international law, etc. Most of the Palestine support groups do not mention the Israeli population therefore ICAHD UK brought an added dimension to the various meetings and events in which it participated.\n\nICAHD UK’s core funding was obtained from membership subscriptions, donations from individuals, peace and justice organisations, Lush, a trade union, churches and other religious groups and the occasional grants. Comedians Ivor Dembina and Mark Thomas facilitated comedy events at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival to raise funds for ICAHD UK.\n\nICAHD UK was registered as a Limited Company in January 2007. Over the years the following have served as ICAHD UK patrons: Prof Avi Shlaim, Prof Ilan Pappe, Prof Colin Green, Rt Hon Clare Short, Baroness Jenny Tonge, John Pilger, Rev Dr Stephen Sizer, Prof Marc Ellis, filmmaker Uri Fruchtmann and Rev Dr Michael Langrish.\n\nAGM, Annual Conference & Member’s Dinner\n\nSince 2011, the Annual General Meeting, followed by the annual conference has taken place at Amnesty International Human Rights Centre, New Inn Yard, London. Venues before it included Somerstown Community Centre, Conway Hall, and All Hallows on the Wall."
