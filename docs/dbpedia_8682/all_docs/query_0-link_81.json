        "text": "Map Of North Africa\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo the UN Security Council\n\nExpand the mandate of MINURSO (UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) to include human rights monitoring and reporting in both Western Sahara and in the Polisario-administered camps in Algeria; or establish another mechanism by which the UN provides regular, on-the-ground human rights monitoring and reporting there.\n\nRecommendations to the Government of Morocco\n\nPermit on-the-ground monitoring of human rights conditions in Western Sahara by an appropriate UN mechanism such as MINURSO, should the UN expand its mandate.\n\nRevise or abolish articles of the Press Code, the Law on Associations, and other legislation that criminalize speech and political or associative activities deemed affronts to Morocco's \"territorial integrity\" and that are used to suppress nonviolent advocacy in favor of Sahrawi political rights.\n\nImplement and oversee thorough and independent investigations into allegations by civilians of human rights abuse by police; ensure that the search for the truth involves soliciting additional information from the persons who filed the complaints and, when potentially useful, their families; make public the results of such investigations as well as the administrative or disciplinary measures, if any, that are taken in response.\n\nWhere the evidence warrants, bring charges against public agents implicated in acts of torture, including those who give instructions to torture or those in position of authority who should have known about the torture and failed to take action to prevent it or punish those responsible.\n\nInvestigate, specifically, the conduct of three officers whom complainants have repeatedly cited as personally involved in abusing Sahrawis in El-Ayoun during the period 2005-2007: Ichi abou el-Hassan, Moustapha Kamouri, and Aziz Annouche; initiate disciplinary or judicial measures against them if the results of a diligent and impartial investigation show such measures to be warranted.\n\nEnsure that local administrative authorities comply with Morocco's Law on Associations by halting their practice of refusing to accept the founding papers submitted by independent associations that are following the procedures for obtaining legal status. More broadly, authorities should restrict the right of persons to form and act within associations only in accordance with the narrowly defined criteria specified in the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights.\n\nAllow the right of peaceful assembly to all persons, including advocates of Sahrawi self-determination, in accordance with Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Authorities should restrict the right of peaceful assembly only when there is credible evidence of a threat to \"national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others,\" and only then to the most limited restriction necessary, in both scope and time.\n\nTake steps to ensure that the courts reach verdicts in politically charged cases based on the examination and impartial weighing of all relevant evidence. Judges and prosecutors should act to curb immunity for police who mistreat suspects in custody or use improper coercion to extract incriminating statements. They should do so by, among other things, giving effect to suspects' right under Moroccan law to demand medical examinations to check for evidence of mistreatment and rejecting as evidence any statement that is established to have been made as a result of torture.\n\nContinue the positive steps Morocco has recently taken in lifting reservations to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, by ratifying the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. That protocol requires states parties to allow access to all places of detention to a national body \"for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,\" as well as to a subcommittee of the UN Committee against Torture. Under the terms of the protocol, both the UN subcommittee and the body established at the national level shall advise the government on steps \"to strengthen the protection of persons deprived of their liberty against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"\n\nRecommendations Regarding Human Rights in the Tindouf Camps\n\nThe Tindouf refugee camps represent an anomalous situation. The host state – Algeria – has in practice ceded stewardship of the camps, including responsibility for ensuring human rights, to a liberation movement, the Polisario Front. The camp population lives in harsh desert conditions as refugees from their homeland. Although the Polisario Front and many camp residents declare that their overriding goal is to achieve the right to self-determination, the Polisario– and the host state of Algeria – must ensure, on an ongoing basis, respect for all of the human rights of camp residents.\n\nGiven the allegations of human rights abuses that have arisen in Polisario-run camps over the past three decades, Human Rights Watch believes that the camps merit regular, on-the-ground scrutiny by human rights organizations and international bodies. Such scrutiny is not currently being conducted, either by the UN or others. The remote and isolated nature of the camps, and the abdication of responsibility by the host state of Algeria, heightens the importance of including the Tindouf camps in any international program of human rights monitoring for Western Sahara.\n\nTo the Polisario Front\n\nPermit an appropriate UN mechanism such as MINURSO – should the UN expand its mandate – to conduct on-the-ground monitoring of human rights conditions in the Tindouf refugee camps and in any part of Western Sahara that is under de facto Polisario control.\n\nGuarantee the rights of all camp residents to freedom of association, assembly, and expression, including by:\n\nEnsuring that camp residents are free to challenge peacefully the leadership of the Polisario Front and to advocate options for Western Sahara other than independence.\n\nReinforcing the right to freedom of expression by eliminating, or significantly restricting the scope of, the broadly worded Article 52bis of the SADR Penal Code, which provides prison terms for distributing publications that could \"damage the public interest.\"\n\nEnsuring that interpretations of the SADR's Penal Code articles relating to national security offenses are consistent with international human rights law.\n\nReinforcing the right of assembly by amending articles of the Penal Code that criminalize participating in an unarmed public assembly deemed likely to \"disturb the public order,\" a standard that is too broad and subject to a repressive interpretation.\n\nEnsure camp residents' unfettered right to freedom of movement and take pro-active measures so that all camp residents know that they are free to leave the camps, including, if they wish, to settle in Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara.\n\nRealize its pledge to eradicate all vestiges of slavery in the camps through educating the public and all civil servants, inviting and investigating complaints from the public, acting decisively to end any cases of slavery-like practices, and adopting necessary measures so that serious penalties may be imposed for infractions, including where qadi's (judges) refuse to perform marriages without the consent of an \"owner\".\n\nWith respect to confinement of women who have children born out-of-wedlock, amend the Penal Code to decriminalize consensual sex between adults, which infringes on the right to privacy, and cancel all penalties pending against persons convicted of this \"offense.\" To the extent that the Polisario confines women purportedly at risk of \"honor crimes\" because of their putative sexual activity, it must ensure that no woman is thus \"protectively\" confined against her will. It must also offer effective non-custodial forms of protection to women.\n\nTo the Government of Algeria\n\nPermit on-the-ground monitoring and human rights conditions in the Tindouf camps by an appropriate UN mechanism such as MINURSO, should the UN expand its mandate.\n\nChange its apparent posture of ceding to the Polisario Front responsibility for the protection of the human rights of the population of the Tindouf refugee camps; and publicly acknowledge its own responsibility for ensuring respect for the rights of all persons on Algerian territory. This includes intervening if and when human rights violations are taking place and ensuring that perpetrators are held responsible.\n\nTo Third-Party Governments and Regional Bodies\n\nThird-party governments engaged in seeking a solution to the Western Sahara conflict should:\n\nEnsure, pending a resolution of the conflict, that the Sahrawi people, whether under de facto Moroccan or Polisario administration, enjoy their full rights to freedom of association, assembly and expression; to that end, support an expansion of the mandate of MINURSO to include human rights monitoring and reporting in the Polisario-administered camps as well as in Western Sahara, or establish another mechanism by which the United Nations provides regular, on-the-ground human rights monitoring and reporting there.\n\nEncourage Algeria to acknowledge and assume its responsibility to ensure respect for the human rights of the Sahrawi refugees residing in Polisario-administered camps on Algerian territory.\n\nEnsure that any future resolution of the conflict, whatever form it takes, guarantees the rights of association, assembly, and expression of the Sahrawi people, as well as for all other persons who live in the same political entity.\n\nThe European Union, having recently upgraded the status of its relations with Morocco to \"advanced status,\" should ensure, pending a resolution of the conflict, that the Sahrawi people, whether living under de facto Moroccan or Polisario administration, enjoy their full rights to freedom of association, assembly and expression. To that end, the EU should not only continue to encourage the government of Morocco to widen the space generally for freedom of expression, association and assembly, but also specify, publicly, that such rights must extend to persons who peacefully advocate in favor of Sahrawi self-determination.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also urges the Arab League and the African Union, as regional bodies with a direct interest in the Western Sahara conflict, to implement the same recommendations made to the European Union.\n\nRecommendations to the US and France\n\nThe U.S. and France have voiced qualified support for Morocco's autonomy plan. These two countries, along with any other country that supports the autonomy plan or any other proposal for resolving the Western Sahara conflict, should explicitly condition that support on a commitment by the relevant authorities to fully respect the human rights of all citizens, including the right to speak and act nonviolently in favor of their preferred vision of the political future of Western Sahara.\n\nAs allies of both Morocco and Algeria, and as permanent members of the UN Security Council, France and the United States should lead the effort at the Council to expand the mandate of MINURSO to include human rights monitoring and reporting in both Western Sahara and in the Polisario-administered refugee camps, or to establish another mechanism by which the United Nations provides regular, on-the-ground human rights monitoring and reporting there.\n\nWith respect to the United States, we regret that in its monitoring of, and reporting on, human rights conditions worldwide, including in Western Sahara, it has paid scant attention to the Tindouf refugee camps. It should collect pertinent information both in the camps and, where appropriate, outside them, and speak publicly about human rights conditions there, including in the State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.\n\nMethodology\n\nHuman Rights Watch conducted research missions to El-Ayoun in Western Sahara in December 2005, November 2007, and March 2008. The 2007 trip also included a visit to the city of Smara. Human Rights Watch met with Moroccan officials, who also furnished answers in writing to questions we submitted. Their responses are quoted throughout this report and reproduced in large part as an appendix.\n\nIn El-Ayoun and Smara, Human Rights Watch interviewed tens of victims of human rights abuses, most of them referred to us by local human rights organizations. We also interviewed human rights activists and lawyers, civilians and policemen who were injured by protestors, and representatives of civil society, both Sahrawis and non-Sahrawis\n\nIn Human Rights Watch's three visits to Western Sahara during the past three years, Moroccan authorities placed no direct obstacles in the way of our work, our meetings or our movements.\n\nThere were, however, indirect pressures on our work. Our researchers observed men sitting in unmarked vehicles or motorcycles near the locations in El-Ayoun and Smara where we met with Sahrawi activists and alleged victims of abuse. These men, whom the activists credibly described as police agents, remained at a distance from our researchers; however, they created an intimidating atmosphere for ordinary citizens who sought to meet us. In addition, the commonplace harassment of Sahrawis who provide information about Moroccan abuses to visiting human rights delegations, as documented in this report, creates disincentives for them to do so. While we found many Sahrawis eager to testify about abuses they had allegedly suffered, we also encountered or heard about others who declined to provide us information, explaining that they feared reprisal by the authorities.\n\nWe did not formally request a visit to El-Ayoun civil prison; the treatment of prisoners there or elsewhere fell outside the scope of our planned work.\n\nA Human Rights Watch team of three researchers and an interpreter visited four refugee camps (Smara, El-Ayoun, February 27, and Rabouni) near Tindouf, Algeria, from November 10 – 13, 2007. We did not visit the Polisario-controlled portion of Western Sahara or interview Sahrawis who reside in this sparsely populated area.\n\nWe interviewed 28 refugees residing in the camps, six Polisario officials, four foreigners working for the UN agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that are present in the camps, as well as other foreigners residing in the camps. We selected the refugees for interviews through referrals by Sahrawis living in Western Sahara, foreign workers living in the camps, journalists who had visited the camps, and through referrals by camp residents themselves.\n\nOur interview subjects do not constitute a scientific sample of the camp population, although they did offer a range of views on the Polisario leadership. In addition, we compared their testimonies with information from interviews we conducted outside of the camps, both with Sahrawis and non-Sahrawis who had a direct and recent experience of life in the camps. These included Sahrawis living in Spain and France as well as more than 19 who had left the camps between 2006 and 2008 to live in Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara. We also interviewed a number of Sahrawis who had left the camps ten or more years ago about past Polisario abuses; this report, however, focuses on the present-day human rights situation.\n\nWhile in the Tindouf camps, Human Rights Watch set its own schedule and moved about freely. We did not conduct interviews with residents in the presence of Polisario officials. However, due to housing conditions, it was often impossible to conduct interviews in a private, one-on-one setting. We conducted interviews in Arabic, French, Spanish and English, using our own interpreter when necessary.\n\nSeveral of the persons Human Rights Watch interviewed for this report asked not to be named. In these cases we provide the date and location of the interview but not the interviewee's name.\n\nLegal Framework Applied in this Report\n\nHuman Rights Watch takes no position on independence for Western Sahara, or on Morocco's proposal for autonomy for the territory under its sovereignty.\n\nThe situation in Western Sahara is an occupation under the laws of armed conflict. However, our main framework is that of international human rights law. Our chief concerns include violations of the rights of expression, association and assembly – all human rights law violations, not a matter of occupation law. Human Rights Watch considers Morocco responsible for upholding international human rights in Western Sahara because it claims sovereignty over the territory and applies the same Moroccan laws to the roughly 85 percent of the territory it controls as it applies throughout the kingdom.\n\nThe UN classifies Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory and does not recognize Moroccan sovereignty over it. Nor does it recognize the SADR as a state or grant it an official status with the UN. The SADR is thus not a party to the core international human rights treaties. However, the Polisario, which exercises de facto governmental authority within the camps, has signed several regional human rights treaties as the SADR government and has formally declared its adherence as a liberation front to the Geneva Conventions and to a ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines. With regard to the human rights issues that this report addresses, the Polisario, as the government of the SADR, has undertaken, under the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, to respect and protect, \"without distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic group, color, sex … birth or other status\" (Article 2), the freedoms of movement (Article 12), expression (Article 9), and assembly (11); to prohibit all forms of exploitation, degradation, and cruel treatment (Article 5); and to ensure the elimination of discrimination against women \"and also ensure the protection of the rights of the woman and the child as stipulated in international declarations and conventions\" (Article 18.3).\n\nThe Algerian government has steadfastly backed the Polisario, assisting it financially and diplomatically and allowing it to administer a large Sahrawi refugee population on its territory for more than three decades. Algeria has said the Polisario is responsible for ensuring the human rights of Sahrawis in the Tindouf refugee camps. Such a position by a sovereign state does not conform to international law. As the 2006 OHCHR delegation noted, notwithstanding Algeria's delegation of authority to the Polisario, the Algerian government remains ultimately responsible, according to its international legal obligations, for the human rights of all persons in its territory, including in the refugee camps around Tindouf. As a matter of state responsibility, actions by the Polisario within Algeria that violate Algeria's human rights obligations are attributable to Algeria itself, regardless of whether Algeria empowered the Polisario to exercise authority. Accordingly, Algeria remains ultimately responsible for ensuring the rights of Sahrawi refugees on its territory, notwithstanding the Polisario's separate obligations in this regard.\n\nAs a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 protocol, Algeria is bound to respect the rights of refugees to freedom of movement within Algeria to the same degree as other aliens, and to issue travel documents to Sahrawi refugees for the purpose of travel outside Algeria – an obligation that it may limit only as \"require[d]\" by \"compelling reasons of national security or public order.\" Similarly, Algeria may not impose, for the protection of the national labor market, restrictive measures on the employment of Sahrawis who have been in Algeria for three years or more. Protections afforded by Algeria's human rights treaty obligations are complementary to its obligations under refugee law, in particular where human rights law provides for stronger protection than refugee law. Thus, Algeria is responsible for upholding, inter alia, the freedom of expression and assembly of Sahrawi refugees, as part of its obligations as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nBackground to the Western Sahara Conflict\n\nWestern Sahara covers 266,000 square kilometers of mostly arid land in north-western Africa. The territory stretches from Morocco's southern border south to Mauritania and reaches inland from its 1100-kilometer-long Atlantic coastline to the borders of Algeria and Mauritania. Its largest city, with roughly 200,000 residents, is El-Ayoun, near the Moroccan border. The native inhabitants of Western Sahara are the Sahrawi people, who speak Hassaniya, a dialect of Arabic that is also spoken in Mauritania.\n\nThe population of Western Sahara was estimated to be 393,831 as of July 2008, a majority of whom are Moroccans who moved to the region since the territory came under Moroccan control.\n\nSpain claimed the territory as a protectorate in 1884, and from a few outposts gradually extended its administrative control over the next 80 years. In 1974, under pressure at the UN to decolonize, Spain agreed to conduct a referendum that would present the territory's inhabitants with the option of independence. As a preliminary step, Spain completed a census of the territory's inhabitants in 1974 that put the number at 74,000.\n\nKing Hassan II of Morocco threatened to reject the referendum's results, asserting that the period of Spanish colonization had interrupted pre-existing Moroccan sovereignty over the territory, which would resume after Spain's withdrawal. Before Spain carried out the referendum, Morocco asked the UN General Assembly to refer the question to the International Court of Justice.\n\nThe Court's October 16, 1975 advisory opinion held that while Morocco (and Mauritania) had legal relations with the territory's inhabitants prior to the Spanish takeover, these did not amount to sovereignty and thus \"were not of such a nature as might affect the application of … the principle of self-determination through the free and genuine expression of the will of the peoples of the Territory.\"\n\nImmediately after the ruling, however, King Hassan II announced that the court had vindicated Morocco's claims. On November 6, 1975, he laid symbolic claim to the territory by launching a \"Green March\" of approximately 350,000 Moroccan civilians, some of whom walked southward from the Moroccan border into a 10-kilometer strip that Spanish soldiers had already vacated. The Moroccan army entered the territory soon thereafter, formally partitioning it in 1976 with Mauritania, which also had asserted historical ties with the region. (Morocco claimed the northern two-thirds of the Spanish Sahara.) On November 14, 1975, Spain signed a tripartite agreement transferring some of its powers and responsibilities over Western Sahara to Morocco and Mauritania. It formally pulled out of the territory on February 26, 1976.\n\nAs Moroccan forces arrived from the north and Mauritanian forces arrived from the south, they encountered resistance from the Sahrawi independence movement known as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (Polisario). The Polisario had sprung up in 1973 in opposition to Spanish rule. After Polisario strikes deep inside Mauritania forced that country to withdraw from the war in 1978, Moroccan troops, who had already seized control of the north of the territory, rapidly occupied the southern zone as well. Mauritania relinquished its claims to the territory in April 1979.\n\nBeginning in January 1976, large numbers of Sahrawi refugees began moving east toward the Algerian desert around Tindouf, fleeing the Moroccan army's advances in Western Sahara and the Moroccan air force's direct attacks. By October of that year, 50,000 Sahrawi refugees were living in eleven scattered camps in Algeria. Others fled south to Mauritania. Still other Sahrawis traveled from southern Morocco, northern Mauritania and western Algeria to join the refugees at the camps around Tindouf. Beyond the first wave of refugees fleeing military attacks, others would continue to flee in subsequent years in the context of Moroccan operations that terrorized Sahrawi civilians through such means as arbitrary arrests, secret detentions and \"disappearances.\"\n\nPolisario's leaders proclaimed the founding of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) on February 27, 1976. The Organization of African Unity admitted it as a member and dozens of countries recognized it. The UN does not recognize the SADR as a state. However, in 1975, the UN recognized the \"mass ... support\" of \"Saharans within the Territory\" for the Polisario Front, and has consistently addressedthe Polisario as a party to the conflict and involved it in negotiations.\n\nAccording to the SADR's constitution, the Polisario will remain the sole representative of the Sahrawi people until the achievement of national sovereignty over Western Sahara. Polisario officials say that the Polisario is not a political party, but a popular front fighting for self-determination, and that the system of government will change upon independence.\n\nIn 1991, a UN-brokered ceasefire agreement provided for a \"UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\" (known as MINURSO and established by Security Council resolution 690 of April 29, 1991 ). The mission was to monitor the ceasefire and organize a referendum that would allow eligible Sahrawis to choose between independence and integration with Morocco. In September of that year the Polisario and Morocco ceased active hostilities.\n\nThe agreement tasked MINURSO with deciding which persons would be eligible to vote on the future of Western Sahara, based on whether and for how long they had lived there. After vetting 198,000 applicants, MINURSO issued a list of some 86,000 eligible voters. The Moroccan government responded by collecting and submitting some 124,000 appeals, the vast majority of them on behalf of candidates deemed ineligible. This confronted the UN with \"the prospect of, in effect, having to begin the voter identification process all over again.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch observed in 1995 that \"Morocco, which is the stronger of the two parties both militarily and diplomatically, has regularly engaged in conduct that has obstructed and compromised the fairness of the referendum process. In addition, a lack of UN control over the process has seriously jeopardized its fairness.\"\n\nIn the face of these obstacles, the UN quietly backed away from the idea of a MINURSO-organized referendum, and none has taken place. Morocco, claiming the plan for establishing a voter list was impracticable, has since refused to accept any referendum in which independence is an option. Meanwhile, it has sought an internationally acceptable solution that would ratify its sovereignty over Western Sahara.\n\nSuccessive UN secretary-generals have assigned special envoys, including former US Secretary of State James Baker, to find a political solution to the Western Sahara conflict. However, none has been able to break the impasse. The Polisario continues to insist on a referendum that includes independence as an option. Morocco rejects this demand while proposing regional \"autonomy\" under its sovereignty.\n\nThe Polisario operates in two contiguous areas. In addition to the six refugee camps it governs in the Algerian desert, it controls the sparsely populated 15 percent of Western Sahara that lies east of the \"Berm.\" The latter is a series of Moroccan defensive earthworks and fortifications more than 1,500 kilometers long that splits the territory in two.\n\nInside the camps, Human Rights Watch did not observe an Algerian security presence; several informants said there was none. The Algerian military has a significant presence in the nearby city of Tindouf. As discussed above, Algeria insists that responsibility for human rights in the camps lies with the Polisario (see \"Legal Framework applied in this report\").\n\nThe population figure for the camps is disputed. The Polisario says it is 158,000. The World Food Program (WFP) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) currently estimate the total population of the camps to be around 125,000. Morocco alleges that these numbers are inflated and has urged the UN to conduct a new census.\n\nThe sprawling camps are administratively divided into districts and subdistricts. The Polisario, as the sole governing authority of the SADR, administers a justice system, with a system of courts and prisons; local qadi's (shari`a law judges) have jurisdiction over personal status and family law issues.\n\nSince 1976, Mohammed Abdelaziz has been the secretary general of the Polisario, having won reelection at each of the Polisario's general congresses. As secretary general, his position also comprises the roles of president of the SADR and commander-in-chief of the Saharawi People's Liberation Army (SPLA).\n\nThe United Nations recognizes its duty to uphold human rights standards in all its operations, including in Western Sahara. Because it considers Western Sahara to be a \"non-self-governing territory,\" the UN has a special obligation to protect the human rights of its residents. Yet, the UN's silence on human rights violations committed there, and the lack of on-the-ground UN agencies conducting human rights monitoring and reporting, contrast with the growing, if still limited, willingness of the organization and its Secretary-General to speak out for human rights. It also stands in contrast to the practice of integrating human rights monitoring into peacekeeping operations elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe UN maintains a permanent presence in the refugee camps in Tindouf and in Western Sahara. Yet the most prominent UN entity there, MINURSO, has no human rights mandate and conducts no ongoing human rights monitoring or reporting. Its mission has no formalized cooperation with the Geneva-based OHCHR.\n\nThe UNHCR has offices in both the Moroccan-controlled territory and the Tindouf refugee camps. The staff includes a number of protection officers who help MINURSO administer a program of visits between the two zones for families separated by the conflict. The UNHCR office in Tindouf also assists in the legal documentation of refugees, provides legal advice and training with regard to sexual and gender-based violence, and, in 2007, began training the Polisario police on international refugee law and human rights law.\n\nIn 2006, the OCHCR dispatched a delegation to investigate the human rights situation in Western Sahara and the Tindouf camps. Although the UN never officially published its report, it is available on the Internet. The delegation concluded, with respect to the Moroccan-ruled territory:\n\n[T]he Sahrawi people are not only denied their right to self-determination, but equally are severely restricted from exercising a series of other rights […] such as the right to express their views about the issue, to create associations defending their right to self-determination and to hold assemblies to make their views known.[44]\n\nThe delegation's visit to the Polisario-controlled camps around Tindouf was less conclusive:\n\n[D]espite the level of cooperation extended to the delegation during its visit to some of the camps, it was unable to obtain sufficient information to draw extensive and well-founded conclusions with regard to the de facto enjoyment of human rights by the refugees in the camps.\n\nThe report called for improved human rights monitoring in the camps.\n\nMINURSO is the obvious candidate to conduct human rights monitoring in the camps and in Western Sahara. Although its original and eponymous mandate – to organize a referendum – has been stymied since 2000, its sizable locally-based staff, resources and long experience may make it the entity best placed to perform this function. MINURSO maintained, as of September 30, 2008, a total of 495 military and non-military personnel in the Moroccan-controlled area and in the Tindouf camps, at a cost of some $48 million per year. In addition to monitoring cease-fire violations, MINURSO operates, together with UNHCR, the family visits program and other \"confidence-building measures.\" The Security Council extended its mandate on April 30, 2008 through April 30, 2009.\n\nThe OHCHR has lobbied within the UN to assign a human rights mandate to MINURSO, highlighting the fact that MINURSO is almost the only peacekeeping mission that lacks a human rights component, according to OHCHR sources who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nThe Security Council has regularly extended MINURSO's mandate, but some permanent members, such as France and Russia, have reportedly resisted proposals by some nonpermanent members, including Costa Rica, to expand the mandate to include reference to human rights.\n\nMorocco opposes giving MINURSO a human rights mandate, on the grounds that it would undermine \"Moroccan sovereignty\" over the area. The Polisario says it favors giving MINURSO such a mandate.\n\nPolisario officials told Human Rights Watch that despite the absence to date of regular, on-the-ground UN rights monitoring, the thousands of foreigners who visit the Tindouf camps every year would surely detect any pattern of serious Polisario abuses. This argument is true only up to a point. First, access to the camps is not easy: they are located in a remote and militarized part of Algeria; foreigners cannot simply arrive at will and unannounced. Westerners must obtain entry visas to Algeria, which the government does not readily grant unless the Polisario endorses the application. There are no foreign media based in the camps or in their vicinity. Few if any of the foreigners in the camps are there to conduct human rights monitoring; nor are they specialized in such work.\n\nKey Third Parties: The United States, France, and the European Union\n\nWhile they do not recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, two close and powerful allies and providers of aid, the United States and France, vocally support Morocco's autonomy plan as a basis for negotiations to resolve the conflict. However, neither country adequately uses the influence this gives them with Moroccan authorities to urge, including publicly when warranted, dramatic improvements in respect for human rights in Western Sahara. The EU, which recently upgraded its already good relations with Morocco, should also keep the situation in Western Sahara central to its human rights dialogue with its southern partner.\n\nThe United States\n\nThe U.S. State Department spokesperson said on May 1, 2008:\n\nAn independent Sahrawi state is not a realistic option. In our view, some form of autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only realistic way forward to resolve this longstanding conflict. We urge the parties to focus future discussions on a mutually-acceptable autonomy regime that is consistent with the aspirations of the people of Western Sahara …. Morocco has presented a proposal that we believe is serious and credible.[51]\n\nUS bilateral assistance, which had been averaging about US$30 million per year, increased dramatically when the government-backed Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) approved on August 31, 2007 a five-year US$697.5 million economic aid package to Morocco. The package, intended to fight poverty and promote economic growth, was the largest grant made by the MCC since its creation in January 2004.\n\nThe State Department, when presenting the request for U.S. military aid to Morocco in July 2007, argued:\n\nMorocco continues in its position on the front lines in the global war against terrorism and as one of our most reliable and closest allies in the region …. Funding is critical and will support public promises by high level U.S. visitors of increasing engagement with Morocco and help to maintain U.S. credibility, critical at a time when King Mohammed VI is providing significant support for the President's reform agenda. The country is a liberalizing, democratizing, and moderate Middle East nation undertaking broad political, social, and economic reforms.[52]\n\nIn 2004 President Bush designated Morocco as a \"major non-NATO ally,\" thereby easing restrictions on arms sales. The move was taken, a senior administration official said, \"in recognition of the close US-Morocco relationship, our appreciation for Morocco's steadfast support in the global war on terror, and for King Mohamed VI's role as a visionary leader in the Arab world.\" Morocco is one of nine nations that belong to the US-led Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership, which holds joint exercises in the Sahara desert.\n\nThe U.S. has at the same time actively monitored human rights in Western Sahara. It sends diplomats to the region who meet with human rights activists there, including those belonging to organizations that Morocco has not legally recognized. The State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights contains a separate chapter devoted to Western Sahara that is a useful reference on the subject.\n\nThe US also conditions a small amount of military aid to Morocco on respect for human rights in Western Sahara. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (H R 2764), which President George W.Bush signed into law on Dec. 26, 2007, provides Morocco with $3.655 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF). It states:\n\nAn additional $1,000,000 may be made available if the Secretary of State certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that the Government of Morocco is continuing to make progress on human rights, and is allowing all persons to advocate freely their views regarding the status and future of Western Sahara through the exercise of their rights to peaceful expression, association and assembly and to document violations of human rights in that territory without harassment.[55]\n\nTo date, the Secretary of State has not certified that these conditions have been met.\n\nFrance\n\nFrance also enjoys close relations with Morocco. It is the kingdom's leading trade partner and the leading source of public development aid and private investments. President Nicolas Sarkozy stated that France accounts for 60 percent of foreign investment in Morocco since 2000, and that 500 subsidiaries of French companies operate in Morocco, employing 180,000 people. The French government states:\n\nFrance is the leading provider of bilateral aid to Morocco, with 220 million euros given in 2006, totaling 53 percent of the total bilateral aid provided by countries belonging to the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]. France's total contribution, including money given via international organizations, is 270 million euros, that is, 40 percent of the total aid coming from the OECD.[57]\n\nFrance also backs the autonomy plan as a basis for negotiation. President Sarkozy stated before Morocco's parliament on October 23, 2007:\n\nMorocco proposed an autonomy plan, a plan that is serious, a plan that is credible as a basis for negotiation….In France's view, what will permit a resolution to this conflict that has gone on too long is a political solution, negotiated and agreed to by the two parties under UN auspices .… Morocco's autonomy plan exists; it is on the table and constitutes a new proposal after years of deadlock. I hope to see Morocco's autonomy plan serve as the basis of negotiation in the search for a reasonable resolution. France will be at your side.[58]\n\nFrench Prime Minister François Fillon stated in a speech he gave in Morocco on April 17, 2008, \"I wish to underscore just how much France supports Morocco's initiatives to resolve the painful issue of the Sahara, and just how much France does to explain Morocco's initiatives at the United Nations.\"\n\nFrance has rarely if ever publicly criticized Morocco on human rights grounds in recent years, not with respect to Western Sahara or any other issue. President Sarkozy has praised the kingdom's human rights progress, evoking on his first visit as head of state on October 23, 2007, the \"pluralism and openness\" that \"this democratic Morocco\" is \"experiencing today.\" And when Morocco summarily expelled a delegation representing French human rights and solidarity organizations in April 2008, French authorities declined to criticize the measure. In a letter dated May 14, 2008 and sent to Pierre-Alain Roussel, one of the four who were expelled, Nathalie Loiseau, director at the time of the North Africa desk at the Foreign Ministry, wrote, \"It appears that Moroccan authorities considered your presence to create a risk of disturbing the public order. Since this was the sovereign decision taken by a foreign power, France naturally has no business to comment on it.\"\n\nThe European Union\n\nThe EU enjoys good relations with Morocco and, on October 13, 2008, voted to upgrade the partnership by giving Morocco \"advanced status,\" placing it a notch above other members of the EU's \"neighborhood policy,\" such as Egypt and Israel. The upgraded status is intended to involve \"cooperation in political and security matters, the preparation of a comprehensive and deeper free trade agreement, the gradual integration of Morocco into a number of EU sectoral policies, and the development of people-to-people exchanges.\" These measures are, according to the EU, \"intended to provide material support for the modernisation and democratic transition process that Morocco has been engaged in for a number of years and for which Morocco is requesting more substantial backing from Europe.\"\n\nThe EU's Morocco \"strategy paper\" for 2007-2013 notes:\n\nThe EU is Morocco's most important export market, its leading public and private external investor and its most important tourist market. Morocco also contributes to the EU's energy security as a strategic transit country for Algerian gas and as an exporter of electricity to Spain. Human exchanges are constantly expanding: the EU is the main destination of Moroccan migrant workers and an increasing number of Europeans choose Morocco as a place for holidays or even residence.\n\nThe EU committed 1.3 billion euros in aid to Morocco through its MEDA 1 and MEDA 2 programs from 1996 to 2004. MEDA was, until its phasing out, the principal instrument of economic and financial cooperation under the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. Morocco is currently the biggest beneficiary of its successor program, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, with 654 million euros earmarked for 2007-2010.\n\nAn EU-Morocco association agreement has been in effect since 2000. The agreement, which provides for trade liberalization and a framework for political relations and cooperation in various sectors, underscores the importance of human rights in its preamble and in Article 2.\n\nThe EU-Morocco association agreement established a bilateral \"association council\" at which the two sides meet regularly at the ministerial level. That council has a Human Rights, Democratization, and Governance subcommittee that has met three times.\n\nFollowing the October 13, 2008 meeting of the Association Council, the EU issued a long statement announcing the upgrade in its relations with Morocco. While praising Morocco for progress in many areas of human rights, the EU also \"renew[ed] its appeal made during the previous session of the Association Council that Morocco ensure respect for freedom of expression and the protection of sources, and to reform again the Press Code and the Penal Code by decriminalizing offenses of opinion.\" The EU also invited Morocco \"to safeguard freedom of association and assembly, notably in the territory of Western Sahara,\" and called upon \"the forces of authority [sic] to show restraint in the recourse to force.\"\n\nHuman Rights in Western Sahara\n\nThis section examines violations by Moroccan authorities of the rights to speak, assemble and associate peacefully in favor of human rights for Sahrawis, including the right to self-determination. It examines unfair trials of Sahrawis in Moroccan courts; the involvement of the security forces in arbitrary arrests, violence and torture; the repression of Sahrawi demonstrations and associations; a system for handling citizen complaints of police abuse that delivers impunity rather than accountability; and restrictions on foreign journalists and observers.\n\nThis section also looks at Moroccan laws and how authorities apply them toward Sahrawi activism. These include, on the one hand, laws that are repressive in their essence and, on the other hand, laws that are not intrinsically repressive but that authorities either disregard or interpret in a repressive fashion.\n\nExamples of repressive laws include those that prohibit speech or associations deemed to undermine Morocco's \"territorial integrity.\" The laws governing public gatherings are not intrinsically repressive: they require prior authorization for most gatherings in public places, and give the wali – an official of the Interior Ministry – discretion to bar demonstrations that might disturb public order or public safety. But in the city of El-Ayoun in Western Sahara, authorities simply do not grant permits for demonstrations when they consider the organizers to be close to the \"separatist\" line.\n\nIn 2002, Morocco enacted a welcome reform to the Law on Associations, giving citizens the right to form an association simply by informing the authorities of its creation, and giving to the courts sole authority to prohibit an association. But authorities in El-Ayoun have disregarded this law in practice by preventing certain associations from fulfilling the formality of declaring themselves, leaving them in legal limbo.\n\nMost cases in this report occurred between 2006 and 2008, that is, in the years following a particularly tense 2005. In May of that year, police broke up a demonstration by Sahrawis in El-Ayoun protesting the transfer of a Sahrawi inmate from El-Ayoun prison. That confrontation launched a cycle of pro-independence demonstrations, sit-ins and clashes with the police that lasted through much of 2005 and that spread from El-Ayoun to other cities in Western Sahara and to Sahrawi students enrolled at Moroccan universities. In the three years since this period of sustained protest that is sometimes referred to as the Sahrawi \"intifada,\" clashes and public protests have been less frequent.\n\nThis report does not examine the extent to which persons in Western Sahara are free to speak, assemble or associate on issues other than Sahrawi human rights and the independence option for that region. It does not assess the rights enjoyed, for example, by trade unionists, or advocates on behalf of the unemployed, or Sahrawis who advocate in favor of, rather than against, Morocco's autonomy plan.\n\nSimilarly, the section below on trials concerns Sahrawi defendants with pro-independence sentiments. From this sample we are unable to say whether these trials are more or less fair than the trials of other types of defendants.\n\nThe Right to a Fair Trial\n\nMorocco's justice system fails to provide fair trials to Sahrawis accused of politically motivated offenses. The courts have regularly convicted persons on the basis of statements that they repudiated at trial, either on the grounds that the police tortured them into providing and then signing the statements, or on the ground that the police fabricated their contents. Many defendants report that the police coerced them to sign statements that the police prevented them even from reading. The courts make virtually no effort to investigate these claims by defendants; they also ignore requests by defendants for prompt medical examinations following the period of police interrogation to check for signs of abuse.\n\nThe evidence of unfair trials is ample partly because, to Morocco's credit, trials are in practice generally open to the public. Moroccan and foreign observers have attended many politically sensitive trials and reported on what they observed.\n\nThis section examines five trials as case studies:\n\ntwo involving relatively well-known Sahrawi activists accused of inciting, organizing, or participating in violent protests;\n\none involving a well-known activist accused of a common criminal offense;\n\none involving two little-known Sahrawi youths accused of acts of street violence in El-Ayoun;\n\none involving Sahrawi student activists accused of violence on the campus of their university in Rabat.\n\nHuman Rights Watch agrees that human rights work should not be a cover to pursue violent activities or activities that are recognizably criminal by international norms. In the trials that we studied, the defendants denied at trial all links to violence but expressed their pro-independence sympathies. Judging by the flimsy or dubious nature of the incriminating evidence, the prosecution of these activists seems part of a campaign by authorities not only to put them behind bars – even if these days Morocco locks them up more in rotation than en masse – but also to discredit their standing as human rights defenders.\n\nBy all accounts, a limited number of Sahrawis have engaged in politically motivated violence, sometimes during demonstrations, sometimes outside of demonstrations. They have thrown stones or, less frequently, Molotov cocktails, causing bodily harm and property damage. However, the courts frequently convict individuals of criminal acts such as these even though the evidence presented at their trial failed to demonstrate conclusively that they were guilty as charged.\n\nThe prison terms that Morocco has imposed since 2005 on Sahrawi political activists are shorter than those that the courts imposed in the 1980s and 1990s. In the earlier period, courts imposed ten and twenty-year sentences for politically motivated offenses instead of the sentences of three years or less that have been the norm more recently. Today, as in the past, royal pardons free many prisoners before the end of their term.\n\nTrials held in the court of El-Ayoun, by far the busiest in Western Sahara, give the impression of normalcy in several respects. First, lawyers say that they have regular access to their clients in prison and are able to plan their defense under normal conditions. Foreign observers attend many of the high-profile trials and generally encounter few obstacles when they do so. The judges generally do not cut off the defendants when they address the court on the facts of the case, including when accusing the police of mistreatment or repudiating their statements to the police. The judges also let lawyers denounce procedural violations that jeopardize their clients' right to a fair trial. They often do not stop defendants from shouting pro-independence or pro-Polisario slogans as they enter and exit the courtroom.\n\nThese factors do not diminish the inherent unfairness of their trials and of the verdicts and sentences that result. The common violations of due-process rights include:\n\nthe torture or mistreatment by police of defendants under interrogation to extract a statement incriminating themselves or others;\n\nthe improper coercion by police of defendants to sign a statement without permitting them to read it, the contents of which the defendants later repudiate;\n\nthe refusal by investigating and trial judges to grant defendant requests for a timely medical examination to check for signs of torture or other abuse;\n\nthe acceptance by judges into evidence of incriminating statements made to the police without investigating defendant claims that they were extracted through abusive and illegal means;\n\nthe common refusal by judges to grant defense motions to call exculpatory witnesses when their testimony might have probative value.\n\nDefense lawyer Bazaid Lahmad of El-Ayoun summed it up this way:\n\nJudges allow the defendants and their lawyers to have their say, to make their arguments. But when it comes to deciding on the verdict, it is the procès verbal [the defendant's statement as recorded by the police, the \"PV\"] that prevails. The written verdict always gives credence to the police PV, even when the court acknowledges that the defendant denied its contents before the investigating judge.[68]\n\nUnder Morocco's Code of Criminal Procedure, when the defendant stands charged with offenses that carry penalties of less than five years in prison (misdemeanors and infractions), the court is to deem a statement prepared by the judicial police as trustworthy unless the defendant can demonstrate it is not. Thus, the burden of proof to exclude from evidence a statement prepared by the police rests on the defendant. This contrasts to the rules of evidence when the charges involve crimes – a more serious category of offense – in which case the code considers a statement made to the police merely as one piece of evidence among others, and there is no presumption as to its truthfulness. In practice, the evidence rule for misdemeanors and infractions makes it easy for the public prosecution and the investigating judge to take the statements prepared by the police and to incorporate them into their own reports with few if any modifications. Trial judges frequently – and contrary to what Moroccan authorities claim – treat police statements as valid evidence without questioning the police agents who prepared them. The defense can ask the court to summon the police agents who prepared the statement to answer questions, but judges have and use the discretion not to do so.\n\nIn misdemeanor and infraction cases, the court's predilection for admitting statements that defendants have purportedly made to the police compromises the right of the accused to the presumption of innocence at each stage of the judicial process. It makes it more difficult for defendants to effectively challenge statements and confessions made under duress.\n\nTo protect the rights of the defendant, reports prepared by the judicial police during the investigative, pre-trial phase should remain inadmissible in trial court until the prosecution meets the burden of proving their veracity and their legal validity according to the Code of Criminal Procedure. There should be a strong presumption against the admissibility of any confessions made while the suspect is being held in prolonged incommunicado detention, as this is when torture and ill-treatment are most likely to occur. As a general rule, convictions based solely on confessions are highly suspect.\n\nThe information on the following trials comes from trial observation reports by various human rights organizations and independent observers, Human Rights Watch interviews with defense lawyers and trial observers, and\n\nour examination of case files.\n\n2007-2008 Trial of Naf'i as-Sah and Abdallah al-Boussati for \"Throwing Molotov Cocktails at a Police Car\"\n\nThe account of this trial is based primarily on the court's written judgment in the case and the trial observation reports prepared by Swiss jurist Patrick Herzig on behalf of the Swiss League for Human Rights.\n\nNaf'i as-Sah and Abdallah al-Boussati are both residents of El-Ayoun who were born in 1988. They were not involved in human rights organizations before their arrest. Rather, their case is one among many trials of Sahrawi youths who had participated in street demonstrations and who authorities charged with committing acts of violence.\n\nAs-Sah and al-Boussati faced charges under Article 580 of the Penal Code for throwing Molotov cocktails at a police car in El-Ayoun on June 30, 2007, damaging the vehicle and injuring three of the policemen inside. Article 580 provides a sole punishment – death – for persons who deliberately set fire to structures that are occupied by persons or that are intended for that purpose, or to vehicles that contain persons.\n\nThe police arrested As-Sah and al-Boussati several days after the incident. They remained in custody through their trial. The trial opened December 5, 2007 but the judge adjourned the case to January 9 and then to February 6, 2008, so that all of the witnesses could appear in court to testify.\n\nIn his \"confession\" to the police, as-Sah stated that Boussati had contacted him and proposed to pay him to recruit youths to throw Molotov cocktails at the police. Al-Boussati, in his police \"confession,\" describes a person who introduced himself as \"Bikam\" and who offered to provide al-Boussati with incendiary materials and pay him to use them against the police. Both defendants made these statements in the absence of a lawyer. Moroccan law does not grant suspects the right to a lawyer during garde à vue (pre-charge) detention.\n\nAl-Boussati repudiated this statement when he appeared before the investigating judge. As-Sah told the investigating judge, according to the court's written ruling, that \"everything he had said to the police was untrue, that he had not participated in the events, and that he had made up what he told the police so as not to undergo further torture.\"\n\nAt trial, the defendants again proclaimed their innocence and repudiated their \"confessions\" to the police. As-Sah testified again that the police had tortured his statement out of him. He and al-Boussati claimed that the police had pinned this case on them in retaliation for their peaceful, pro-independence views and activities. As they filed in and out of the court, they flashed the 'V' sign with their fingers (for \"victory\") and chanted slogans in favor of Sahrawi self-determination, according to observers Herzig and Italian magistrate Nicola Quatrano.\n\nAt the February 6 hearing, presiding judge Baha Khalifa called four witnesses: two of the policemen who were in the vehicle that was struck and two young boys who, in their police statements, said they had been playing in a nearby game room when they heard a commotion, looked up, and saw as-Sah fleeing the scene.\n\nThe policemen testified that they did not recognize the persons who had thrown Molotov cocktails at their vehicle. The two youth witnesses then testified in turn that they had not been near the scene when the crime occurred. One said that the police \"statement\" contains things he had not told the police, whereas the other said his statement reflects what he had told them, but that he had said things that were untrue because the police had used force on him, according to trial observer Herzig. The judge then questioned the father of the second boy, who stated that the police had held his son at a police station for questioning for an entire day while ordering the father to remain outside, Herzig reported.\n\nThe case file contained medical reports of the policemen's injuries and an estimate of the value of the damages caused to their vehicle. It also contains a report that the police had confiscated three Molotov cocktails at the scene. But the file contained no material evidence, such as fingerprints, linking the defendants to the Molotov cocktails, the defense argued. Moreover, the police did not apprehend them en flagrant délit but rather, several days later.\n\nThe court's ruling, handed down on February 6, 2008, is revealing. It dutifully notes the defendants' repudiation of their police statements and as-Sah's allegation of torture. The ruling acknowledges that none of the witnesses who appeared in court could identify the assailants, and that the two minors – the only non-police witnesses – told the court that they had not even been near the scene. The ruling makes clear that by the end of the trial, the only incriminating evidence remaining were the defendants' police statements.\n\nAt this point, it would seem logical for the court, if it wished to convict, to explain why it chose to accredit these \"police statements\" rather than the defendants' repudiation of the statements, and to note what steps the court had taken to determine the credibility of as-Sah's allegation that the police had tortured his statement from him.\n\nInstead, the court notes that when it comes to the commission of crimes [jinayat], the Code of Criminal Procedure treats statements recorded by the judicial police \"as mere documents and pieces of information that are not to be taken into account unless there is additional evidence corroborating them.\" On the other hand, the court notes, \"in cases involving misdemeanors [junah] and infractions[moukhalafat], police statements are deemed trustworthy until proven to be otherwise.\"\n\nLacking evidence in the file that would corroborate the defendants' \"confessions\" to the police, the court lowered the evidentiary threshold by downgrading the charge from a crime – an arson attack (Article 580) – to a misdemeanor assault on a public agent (Article 267). It then convicted them solely on the basis of their \"confessions.\" It did so without explaining why it deemed their police statements to be trustworthy.\n\nThe judge sentenced as-Sah and al-Boussati to one year in prison each. On appeal, the court reduced their prison terms to ten months and they were freed in May 2008.\n\nThe as-Sah–al-Boussati case exemplifies the scenario described above by lawyer Bazaid Lahmad. Their trial had the outward appearance of a fair trial. The judge allowed the defendants to speak and recorded their allegations of torture and their repudiation of their statements to the police. He complied with defense requests to hear witnesses who undermined the prosecution's case, and he conducted the proceedings in the presence of several foreign observers. Nevertheless, the guilty verdict seemed predetermined rather than the outcome of weighing the incriminatory and exculpatory evidence presented in court.\n\n2007 Trial of Mohamed Tahlil for \"Arson\"\n\nThe account of this trial is based on the court file, an interview with defense lawyer Bazaid Lahmad, and the trial observation report prepared by jurist Patrick Herzig on behalf of the Swiss League for Human Rights.\n\nMohamed Tahlil, born in 1981, is president of the section of the Sahrawi Association of Victims of Grave Violations Committed by the Moroccan State (ASVDH) in the city of Boujdour. He is a well-known activist who does not hide his support for Sahrawi self-determination; he chanted pro-independence slogans at his own trial.\n\nOn September 19, 2007 the El-Ayoun Court of First Instance convicted Tahlil for an arson attack on a car in Boujdour. El-Ayoun's Court of Appeals on December 4, 2007 upheld his conviction but cut the prison sentence from three to two and-a-half years.\n\nThe arson incident took place on March 9, 2007. According to the written report prepared by the prosecutor referring the case to trial, a policeman named Mohamed Fennouche arrived on the scene of the damaged car, chased a person through dark streets until he reached a well-lit area, where he said he recognized the person as Tahlil, before the fleeing suspect eluded him. According to the report, Tahlil is \"known to the security services in Boujdour as one of those who incite disturbances.\" Policeman Fennouche said he recognized Tahlil from his features and clothing. The report identifies no other witness linking the suspect to the attack.\n\nThe police did not arrest Tahlil on the day of the crime. Rather, he remained at liberty and left Morocco legally for Mauritania in May. The prosecutor's report states that the police arrested Tahlil on July 19, 2007 at a border checkpost and presented him to the prosecutor on July 21.\n\nHowever, Bazaid Lahmad, Tahlil's lawyer, says that the real arrest date was actually several days earlier than the one recorded by the police and the prosecutor. He maintains that his client had been kept in garde-à-vue detention for an entire week, well beyond the three-day limit allowed by the law. Hoping to prove this, Tahlil's defense team asked the trial judge to require the police to produce Tahlil's confiscated passport, arguing that the date of the Moroccan entry stamp in it would reflect the real date the authorities had taken him into custody. Demonstrating that his garde à vue detention had been illegally prolonged might cast doubt on Tahlil's \"confession\" to the police, which he was attempting to repudiate at his trial. It would also show that Tahlil had left Morocco legally since the incident, even though a policeman had supposedly identified him fleeing the scene of the crime.\n\nBut the court did not order the police to produce Tahlil's passport. Nor did it act on defense requests to summon for questioning the policeman who allegedly identified Tahlil fleeing the scene of the crime, even though he was the sole eyewitness linking Tahlil to it.\n\nThe main evidence against Tahlil was his own signed \"confession\" to the police. At his trial, Tahlil repudiated this statement, saying he had falsely confessed only because the police were torturing him. Tahlil denied any connection to the attack, but said he had been present in Boujdour on the day it occurred.\n\nThe report of the prosecutor notes that Tahlil, in his statement to the police, says that he had discussed burning a police car with Omar Boulsan, a Polisario figure based in the Canary Islands, who responded by promising Tahlil money and sending him, via Boulsan's sister, the sum of 1000 DH [about US$140]. This account, if true, would bolster official Moroccan efforts to portray Sahrawi human rights activists as violent and Polisario-directed.\n\nThe court convicted Tahlil, after accepting his statement to the police into evidence without investigating his claims of torture, declining defense requests to summon for questioning the sole eyewitness who had identified Tahlil, and declining to obtain from police his confiscated passport despite its potentially probative value.\n\n2007 Trial of Eight Sahrawi Students at the University of Rabat for an \"Armed Demonstration\"\n\nThe account of this trial is based primarily on an interview with defense lawyer Bazaid Lahmad, defendant Abdati edh-Dhaya, and another student involved in the demonstration, Yahdih el-Bouehi.\n\nThere being no institutions of higher education in Western Sahara, Sahrawis from that region attend university in cities such as Marrakesh, Rabat, and Agadir.\n\nMay is a busy month on the political calendar of Sahrawi activists, with demonstrations and activities commemorating the Polisario national holiday (May 10), the founding of the Polisario (May 20) and the beginning of the 2005 intifada in Western Sahara (May 21). Activists were particularly mobilized in May 2007, after clashes at the University of Agadir set off a series of solidarity protests among Sahrawis on other campuses.\n\nSahrawi activists at the Mohamed V University in Rabat requested permission from university officials to hold a demonstration on campus May 9, 2007 and were refused, Yahdih el-Bouehi, 23, one of the student activists, told Human Rights Watch. So they started a sit-in near the entrance to the Cité Souissi campus, displaying banners demanding Sahrawi self-determination and the release of Sahrawi students arrested in Agadir and Marrakesh, along with photos of Sahrawi students allegedly injured by the police and by counter-demonstrators in the other cities. Sit-in participants chanted slogans in favor of Sahrawi independence and the Polisario, and against Morocco's autonomy plan.\n\nAccording to el-Bouehi, who is from El-Ayoun and is studying law:\n\nFor nine days, we stayed there day and night. The police did not stop us or talk to us. Then on May 17, at 4 A.M., when we were sleeping, the police came and without asking us first to leave, broke up the sit-in with force and chased us away, arresting 17 of the participants. We were stunned.\n\nAt 8:30 or 9 A.M., el-Bouehi recalls, police again charged students who had gathered at the scene to protest the earlier arrests. Some protesters threw rocks at the police, and the police entered the dormitories and searched the rooms of Sahrawi students, he said. Police briefly detained an Associated Press reporter as he photographed the confrontations.\n\nPolice detained protesters, transporting nine of them by van to the Rabat central police station, and releasing the rest. The nine included eight students and one non-student, Khalifa Jinhaoui of El-Ayoun. According to one of those kept in custody, law student Abdati edh-Dhaya (born in 1982), the police beat the arrested students in the van. Edh-Dhaya said that at the station the police placed the nine suspects in basement cells, where they spent the night with no blankets. The next day, May 18, the police interrogated the students one by one, he said. Edh-Dhaya said that he appeared before his interrogators with his hands tied behind his back, sitting on his knees, barefoot and blindfolded. \"They asked us about their political opinions, on the monarchy, on self-determination, why we opposed the Moroccan autonomy plan, and the objectives of the student sit-in,\" he said.\n\nEdh-Dhaya estimates the police interrogated him for two and-a-half hours. Then they gave him a written statement, lifted up his blindfold and told him to sign it. \"I asked to read it first, but they told me I had no right to read it. When I tried to refuse, they slapped me on my neck. I signed.\"\n\nThe following day, edh-Dhaya appeared before the prosecutor. With defense lawyers present, he told the prosecutor that the police had beaten and insulted him and forced him to sign his statement. At no time, however, did any of the defendants receive a medical examination to check for evidence of mistreatment even though they had requested it, according to edh-Dhaya and lawyer Mohamed Benomanne, a member of the defense team.\n\nThe charges against Khalifa Jinhaoui and the students, Mohamed Ali Ndour, Sidi Moulay Ahmed Aylal, El-Ouali Ezzaz Bin Mohamed, Ibrahim el-Gharrabi, Mohamed En-Najem Esghaier, Mohamed Jinhaoui, Sidi Mohamed El-Alaoui, El-Houcine ed-Dali' and Abdati edh-Dhaya, included participation in an \"armed demonstration,\" destruction of public property (i.e., in the campus dormitories), and \"disturbing the public order.\" The basis for the first charge was their statements to the police, in which some of them \"confessed\" to preparing Molotov cocktails for use. There were no allegations that the students had thrown any incendiary devices.\n\nThe students remained in jail after the Rabat Court of First Instance rejected their bid for pre-trial release. At trial, the defendants denied the contents of their police statements, saying they had engaged in no violent activity and had no connection to the Molotov cocktails, according to defense lawyer Bazaid Lahmad. The case file included a report by a policeman who found a stockpile of Molotov cocktails on campus, but his report did not link it to the defendants, and the policeman did not testify at the trial. The director of campus dormitories testified at the trial to the discovery of Molotov cocktails on campus, but did not link them to the defendants.\n\nThe court on June 12, 2007 found the defendants guilty of disturbing the public order and staging an armed demonstration. The repudiated confessions to the police about Molotov cocktails formed the basis for this charge. The court sentenced all of the defendants to eight months in prison. The Appeals Court on July 10, 2007 upheld the verdict and the eight-month sentence for Jinhaoui and reduced the sentences to four months for the remaining eight, including edh-Dhaya.\n\n2008: Trial of Activist Naâma Asfari for \"Drunk Driving and Assault\"\n\nThe account of this trial is based primarily on extensive interviews with defendant Naâma Asfari and an interview with his lawyer Mustapha Errachdi of Marrakesh.\n\nAsfari, born in 1970, is a well-known Sahrawi human rights activist who lives in France but travels frequently to Morocco and Western Sahara. There, he says, plainclothes police frequently follow him and question those with whom he meets. Asfari is co-president of the Committee for the Respect of Freedoms and Human Rights in Western Sahara (Comité pour le respect des libertés et des droits humains au Sahara occidental, CORELSO). He graduated from the University of Marrakesh, where he studied law. Asfari's father, Abdi Asfari of Tantan, is an ex-\"disappeared,\" having been abducted by Moroccan agents and held without trial at a secret place of detention from 1976 to 1991.\n\nBefore Asfari's April 2008 arrest, Moroccan authorities had prosecuted Asfari once before, also on common criminal charges. The earlier prosecution stemmed from a January 5, 2007 incident at a checkpoint at the entry of the city of Smara in Western Sahara. There, a plainclothes police officer – not the usual uniformed officers who check the papers of drivers – told Asfari he could not enter the city. Asfari, who was traveling with his parents-in-laws from France, insisted that the agent provide a formal order for this refusal. The two men were facing one another inside the checkpost when, according to Asfari, the policeman started insulting him and shoved a desk in his direction, which Asfari pushed back toward the officer. The officer then slammed a chair at the desk, knocking things about. He then arrested Asfari.\n\nAuthorities held Asfari two days for investigation and another seven days in pretrial detention. He said he was not mistreated. He refused, however, to sign his police statement in the case file because it omitted parts of what he had told the police. At trial before the Smara Court of First Instance, he proclaimed his innocence on all charges. The court convicted Asfari on January 15, on the basis of statements made by police officers who had been at the checkpoint, on charges of disrespecting a public agent and destroying public property (a reference to furniture purportedly damaged during the incident). The court sentenced Asfari to two months in prison, suspended, and a fine.\n\nThe 2008 incident and ensuing trial took place in the city of Marrakesh, which is not part of Western Sahara. Police arrested Asfari on April 13, 2008, after a late-night traffic incident. Asfari recalls:\n\nI had spent the week at the University of Marrakesh, where I had been meeting with Sahrawi student groups. All weekend long, plainclothes police had been trailing me in unmarked cars. That night they were in a Renault Clio. At about 10:30pm, I ran a red light and nearly hit a driver who had the right of way. The driver started screaming at me from her car. I got out and apologized but also shouted that she should stop insulting me. But I never laid a hand on her or her car.\n\nAs I was stopped there, two of the three men got out of the Clio walked over to my car. They ordered me to give them my car key and to walk with them to their car. They had me get in and sit in the back. Then they blindfolded and handcuffed me and drove away.\n\nThe whole thing was suspicious because these were plainclothes policemen, not the uniformed traffic cops who ordinarily handle traffic incidents.\n\nWhile driving, the police didn't interrogate me. They just tried to humiliate me, saying things like, \"You came here to help these separatists. Why don't you just keep out of it?\" When I answered they punched me in the face. So I shut up.\n\nThey stopped the car and had me get out. I don't know where because I was still blindfolded. They took off my handcuffs, removed my jacket, shirt and shoes, and sat me in a chair. They put my hands behind me and around a tree trunk, and re-handcuffed them.\n\nThey asked me what I was doing in Marrakesh. I said I would not answer unless they put me in a normal situation. Someone kicked me in the stomach. Different persons tried to ask me about my links with the students. When I refused to answer they kicked me. Between the kicks and the cold from being bare-chested, I began screaming.\n\nAfter two, two and-a-half hours, they said, \"Let's try something else.\" While I was still seated, they lifted my feet onto a second chair in front of me and hit the soles of my feet with what felt like hard plastic batons, for two, three minutes. They paused, then started again. One of them burned me with cigarettes on my wrists. I heard people coming and going; they didn't ask me questions but occasionally one would insult or slap me. I began shivering violently.\n\nAfter that, the police transported Asfari to a hospital:\n\nAt the hospital, they X-rayed my feet. The doctor, a young woman, said there were no bones broken. She put ointment and bandages on the cigarette burns. I told the doctor it was the police who did these things to me and I wanted a medical certificate. She left the room. I wanted to wait for her to bring a certificate but the police said, \"Let's go, we'll get the certificate for you later.\" Of course they never did.\n\nFrom the hospital, the police transported Asfari, blindfolded again, to another building:\n\nSomeone said to me, \"We'll read you your statement. If you have a problem with it, you can tell the prosecutor. It says that you were intoxicated and assaulted the woman.\" I replied that I couldn't sign without reading it. Another man came in and said, \"We're not here to answer your questions. We have a pregnant woman in the hospital because you hit her. Either you sign the statement right now, or you will sign it by force.\" I told them I'd sign it just so they'd leave me alone, but that I would tell the prosecutor everything. They lifted my blindfold just so I could put my signature on each page.\n\nAfter I signed, they removed the blindfold and drove me to the central police station. It was now about 2:30 or 3 a.m. I asked if I could phone my family. They refused. I spent the rest of the night and the next day [April 14] in a jail cell at the police station. They gave me nothing to eat the whole time.\n\nOn Tuesday at 10 a.m., they brought me to the office of the royal prosecutor. I sat waiting in a small room until three or four o'clock in the afternoon, without anything to drink or eat. I did not have a lawyer yet. When they called me into his office, the prosecutor was looking down at a document and didn't ask me to sit down. He asked, \"Were you driving drunk?\" I asked, \"How am I supposed to respond? Look at what condition I'm in.\" My face was bruised, my wrists were bandaged, my clothes bloody. He replied, \"Just answer my questions. Were you driving drunk? Did you hit the woman?\" I said no to both. He said, \"OK, you can go now.\" The whole audience didn't last one minute.\n\n(At the trial, the prosecutor denied that any signs of abuse were visible on the defendant's body when he first appeared before him.) Asfari continued:\n\nNext they brought me to the Court of First Instance. The judge asked if I would like to have a lawyer. I told the judge about the police torture, but he told me to deal with that later. He set the trial for the 18th and refused to release me pending the trial. He sent me back to jail, where the next morning [April 16] I could finally contact my family by borrowing a cellphone from another prisoner.\n\nThe court charged Asfari with driving while intoxicated, assaulting a woman, possessing a knife without authorization, and destroying public property. The police report in the case file states that the police found a knife in Asfari's possession, and that he broke a window of the police vehicle, thus the charge of destroying property.\n\nThe prosecutor was to later claim, at the April 21 session of the trial, that he did not inform Asfari's relatives of his arrest because Asfari had refused to provide information about how to reach them. Asfari denied this assertion. Asfari's lawyers argued in court that the police log does not indicate that the police had tried to contact the family, as required by Article 67 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nIn own testimony at the April 21 session of his trial, Asfari denied the charges. He stated that the police had interrogated him mainly about his political activities rather than the traffic incident. Asfari opened his shirt and raised his feet to show the judge where the police had beat him. His lawyers asked the judge to order a medical examination, a request that the court never granted. Defense attorney Mustapha Errachdi said later that, at the trial, he could see bruises and other injuries on Asfari's body.\n\nAt the April 21 hearing, the alleged victim and a bystander who said he saw the incident testified. Both said Asfari had assaulted the woman although their testimonies differed on details. The judge adjourned the trial until April 28 and refused to release Asfari from pretrial detention.\n\nAsfari's wife, Claude Mangin, visited him on April 22 – a day after he had displayed his injuries to the trial judge – at Boulemharez prison. In a memo she wrote after the visit, Mangin said she had observed bruises under Asfari's eyes, marks on his wrists, traces of cigarette burns on his arms, grazed elbows, bruises on the inside of his thighs, and bruised and swollen feet. Two days later, Moroccan authorities summarily expelled Mangin from the country (see below, section entitled Treatment of Foreign Observers).\n\nWhen the trial resumed April 28, Asfari, during his testimony, again removed clothing to display his injuries and said the police had forced him to sign a statement whose contents were false. He asked the judge to order a medical examination; he also requested a medical report from his visit to the hospital on the night of his interrogation, to no avail. The defense pointed out that the case file contained no report of a test establishing Asfari's inebriation and no material evidence of the knife police had charged him with possessing. They also pointed out that Asfari's alleged victim testified that she had not seen a knife in Asfari's possession.\n\nThe court announced its verdict after the April 28 hearing. It dropped the weapons count but otherwise found Asfari guilty as charged and sentenced him to two months in prison and a fine of 3000 DH (US $420).\n\nAsfari served his full sentence in Boulemharez prison and went free on June 13. On June 16 an appeals court upheld the verdict and sentence. Several days before Asfari's release, prison guards confiscated a twenty-page argument he had written for submission to the Court of Appeals and a notebook containing his observations of prison conditions and things he had heard from other prisoners. They have not returned these documents to him, he said.\n\n2005 Trial of Seven Human Rights Activists in El-Ayoun\n\nFollowing the outbreak of almost-daily protests against the police in El-Ayoun in May 2005, police arrested seven of the leading Sahrawi political and human rights activists during June and July, both in El-Ayoun and in Casablanca. They charged them with inciting, organizing, and taking part in the sometimes-violent street protests. The seven are Aminatou Haidar, Hammad Hammad, Ali Salem Tamek, El-Houcine Lidri, Brahim Noumria, Larbi Messaoud, and Mohamed El-Moutaouakil. El-Moutaouakil, Lidri, Messaoud, and Noumria had belonged to the Forum for Truth and Justice – Sahara Section (Forum pour la Vérité et Justice, FVJ) a local branch of a nationwide organization advocating the rights of victims of past abuses. A court dissolved the branch in 2003 (see below, section entitled Freedom of Association for Human Rights Organizations). El-Moutaouakil is also a member of the executive bureau of the national FVJ, which enjoys legal recognition. Although less identified with particular organizations, Haidar, Tamek, and Hammad have all campaigned on behalf of Sahrawi political prisoners and \"disappeared\" persons.\n\nThe prosecution charged the seven with forming a criminal enterprise, willfully destroying public and private property, violence against public officials while in the performance of their duties, inciting others to commit violence, and inciting and participating in unauthorized demonstrations. They additionally charged some with membership in an unauthorized association, presumably a reference to their activities in human rights groups that had not received legal recognition from the authorities. They placed them on trial with seven less-known youths accused of being intifada activists.\n\nThe prosecution's case against the seven prominent activists rested on written statements that the defendants purportedly made to the police in which they implicated themselves and one another in planning, provoking and committing violent actions.\n\nPolice arrested Haidar on June 17, 2005, as she was leaving a hospital where she and two other activists, Fatma Ayyache and el-Houcine Lidri, had received stitches on their heads. The stitches were applied to treat injuries allegedly caused by the police clubbing them earlier that day as Haidar was arriving at a demonstration.\n\nLidri and Noumria allege that after their arrest on July 20, the police tortured them at a secret place of detention before delivering them to the El-Ayoun jail on July 22 (see below, Alleged Torture of El-Houcine Lidri in 2005).\n\nThe main trial session was an 18-hour-long hearing that began on December 13, 2005 and ended at 4 a.m. the following day. The defendants all declared their innocence of all charges related to planning, inciting, and carrying out violence, and repudiated the contents of their incriminating statements to the police – as they already had done before the investigating judge – saying the police had either extracted confessions from them by force or fabricated them. Their lawyers argued that the credibility of the defendants' statements to the police was undermined further by the similarity of the wording attributed to them.\n\nHaidar's written statement, which she says the police never showed her and which she did not sign, has her admitting that she incited the youth to demonstrate and naming Ahmed Sba'i as the provider of ingredients for making Molotov cocktails. (An El-Ayoun court convicted Sba'i seven months later in a separate case and sentenced him to two years in prison.) The court rebuffed defense requests to summon witnesses for cross-examination, including other activists who were in detention at the time of the trial.\n\nThe court convicted the seven activists of inciting and participating in violent demonstrations, on the basis of their statements to the police. It made no apparent effort to examine the validity of these statements despite their categorical repudiation by the defendants. The court acquitted them of the most serious charges, including forming a criminal enterprise. It handed them sentences of between six and ten months in prison, except for Hammad Hammad, who received two years.\n\nIn response to a letter from Human Rights Watch about the case, Morocco's Ministry of Justice wrote that the defendants had used their \"outward human rights activities as a cover to perpetrate acts of subversion or to incite others to perpetrate them.\" The defendants, said the ministry, \"benefited from the legal guarantees of a fair trial and the court rendered its verdicts according to the law.\" The ministry's letter acknowledged complaints filed by Noumria, Lidri, and Haidar about police violence against them and said that the investigating judge had opened an inquiry into their allegations. All of these investigations were still ongoing, according to the letter. Haidar said that, following her complaint, the prosecutor's office summoned her to testify about the police violence, but after she did so, she heard nothing further about the investigation. To the best of our knowledge, these investigations found no wrongdoing by security forces.\n\nAuthorities released Haidar in January 2006, after she had served seven months in prison; a royal pardon in March 2006 resulted in early releases for Hammad, Lidri, Noumria, Messaoud, and El-Moutaouakil. Tamek, the seventh defendant, remained in prison until April 2006.\n\nComplaints of Torture, Beatings, and Arbitrary Arrests of Sahrawi Activists\n\nMorocco ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 1993. In 2006 it took the positive step of lifting its reservation to Article 20 of that Convention, thereby recognizing the competence of the Committee against Torture to open an investigation when it \"receives reliable information which appears to it to contain well-founded indications that torture is being systematically practiced\" in its territory. Morocco recognized at the same time the competence of the Committee against Torture, under Article 22 of the Convention, to receive and consider communications from or on behalf of individuals who claim to be victims of a violation of the convention.\n\nAlso in 2006, Morocco promulgated amendments to its Penal Code prohibiting torture and bringing the code's definition of torture closer to the one found in the Convention against Torture. The code, as revised, refers to:\n\nany act that causes severe physical or mental pain or suffering intentionally inflicted by a public agent or upon his instigation or with his express or tacit consent, upon a person for the purpose of intimidating or pressuring him or for pressuring a third person, to obtain information or a confession, to punish him for an act that he or a third party committed or is suspected of having committed, or when such pain or suffering is inflicted for any other objective based on any form of discrimination.[125]\n\nDespite these legislative measures, torture persists in Morocco in part because of a lack of political will to eradicate it.\n\nThis report contains the testimony of ten Sahrawis whom Human Rights Watch interviewed directly and individually and who described acts of torture or sustained beatings that they experienced at the hands of the police. All ten individuals were in custody at the time of the mistreatment; their cases are distinct from those where the police may have used excessive force in the course of dispersing demonstrations.\n\nWith respect to impunity, Human Rights Watch's investigation into these ten and numerous other cases indicates that despite evidence of torture and serious mistreatment, including badly bruised detainees who ­appear before prosecutors and investigating judges and who demand a medical examination in vain, and the many detailed complaints submitted in writing by alleged victims to offices of the prosecutor, Moroccan officials do not fulfill their legal obligation to investigate this evidence and hold the perpetrators responsible.\n\nWhen asked about accountability for abuse, Moroccan authorities repeatedly cite the case of two police officers who served two years in prison for beating Hamdi Lembarki, a Sahrawi man, to death on an El-Ayoun street in October 2005. Outside of this case, we found no evidence that the many formal complaints lodged by Sahrawis of physical abuse by the police triggered a serious investigation, much less punishment of those found to be responsible. Justice Minister Abdelouahed Radi denied the existence of such evidence to a reporter:\n\nWe never received any complaints from the persons concerned. Regarding torture or illegal arrests, you have to have people who file a complaint. I don't wish to imply that there have never been any missteps, but these are isolated cases. We always react with strictness when the facts are proven. Those responsible for illegal acts have even received heavy sentences.[126]\n\nThe secretary general of the Justice Ministry, Mohamed Ledidi, said that Morocco's judiciary conducts serious and \"honest\" investigations in response to civilian complaints. When asked if the investigations included direct contact with the plaintiff, he responded that this depended on the case. \"There are instances where the written complaint contains all the information that is needed [from the plaintiff], and it is not necessary for the prosecutor's office to contact him.\" Ledidi added that the prosecutor's office informs the plaintiff of the outcome of the investigation.\n\nThe governor (wali) of El-Ayoun-Boujdour, M'hamed Drif, said in November 2007 that since he assumed that post a year earlier, he had heard of no cases of the police inflicting injuries on Sahrawis when they intervened in unauthorized demonstrations.\n\nThe evidence presented in this report contradicts the claims made by Minister Radi, Secretary-General Ledidi, and Governor Drif. In the city of El-Ayoun alone, 12 Sahrawis who alleged that they were victims of torture, physical abuse, arbitrary arrests, and police harassment between 2005 and 2007 showed us copies of the complaints they submitted to the office of the prosecutor, with the complaints stamped as having been received. Of the 12, only one, Hamoud Iguilid, reported that authorities had contacted him as part of an investigation triggered by his complaint, and two others, Brahim Al-Ansari and Dahha Rahmouni, reported that authorities contacted them only to tell them that they had closed their files for lack of evidence. As far as we are able to determine, not one of the other nine complaints led to a follow-up contact with the person making the complaint, much less a finding of police misconduct. In another case, the prosecutor summoned Aminatou Haidar to give testimony as part of an investigation into her complaint that the police beat her on June 17, 2005, but she stated that she was never informed of the outcome of that investigation (see above).\n\nMoroccan authorities informed Human Rights Watch of the disposition of seven complaints: they dismissed six for lack of evidence; the seventh, they said, was still pending. In four of the dismissed cases, they accused the complainants of deliberately spreading false information in order to undermine the ability of the police to carry out their duties (see Appendix 2 to this report).\n\nWhat constitutes a proper investigation in cases where the main available evidence is the word of the complainant against the word of the police? In such cases, a search for the truth should include summoning complainants for face-to-face interviews, to determine the credibility of their testimony and to invite them to provide other evidence that may corroborate their claims. Ordinary citizens who fill out and submit written complaints may have evidence at their disposal that, unbeknownst to them, is relevant to the investigation.\n\nThis report describes three prevalent types of violence committed by police against Sahrawi activists and suspected activists: violence that police inflict during the interrogation of suspects in custody, violence against persons in their custody as punishment for alleged participation in illegal street demonstrations, and excessive force used to disperse illegal demonstrations. Some of the cases meet the definition of torture under Moroccan and international law; others amount to inhumane and degrading treatment, also forbidden by the Convention against Torture. The cases are presented below, except for one case of alleged torture, that of Naâma Asfari, which is discussed above in the \"Right to a Fair Trial\" section.\n\nIn the city of El-Ayoun, the alleged victims of police abuse readily named individual policemen who, they said, took part in abusing them. They identified them in their testimonies to human rights organizations and in the written complaints they turned in to the office of the prosecutor. It appears that a small unit of officers is assigned to handle Sahrawi protest and unrest in the city of El-Ayoun and is personally involved in putting down street protests and carrying out arrests and interrogations. The names of officers cited most frequently in incidents of alleged abuse are: Ichi abou el-Hassan, Moustapha Kamouri, and Aziz Annouche \"et-Touheimeh\" (known by this nickname, which refers to a birthmark on his face). It is not known which, if any, of these names are pseudonyms.\n\nThe testimonies of Sahrawi residents of El-Ayoun who named these officers are sufficiently numerous and consistent to give credibility to the allegation that these individual policemen are chronic abusers. Since the incidents described in this report, authorities reportedly transferred abou al-Hassan to Benslimane and Kammouri to Tantan. Annouche reportedly continues to serve in El-Ayoun. We have no information suggesting that any of them was disciplined in connection with these complaints. When Human Rights Watch presented to Moroccan authorities a sample of citizen complaints naming these officers, the authorities dismissed these complaints in their entirety (see Appendix 2).\n\nCase Studies\n\nSeveral youths, both in El-Ayoun and in Smara, provided testimony about the police detaining them, driving them to an isolated location, and then beating them as a form of \"summary punishment\" for their suspected participation in street protests in favor of Sahrawi self-determination.\n\nEl-Mehdi Ez-Zai'ar\n\nEl-Mehdi ez-Zai'ar, a twenty year-old resident of Haï al-Qasm in El-Ayoun, describes what happened to him on January 22, 2007:\n\nAt about eight o'clock in the evening, I was walking in Haï Katalonia [the \"Catalonia\" neighborhood] with a friend. A large police van stopped and a policeman dressed in civilian clothes stopped me and asked my name. Then he and a group of policemen in plainclothes put us in a car and blindfolded and handcuffed us. He asked me who had given me [Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic] flags and pamphlets, even though I wasn't carrying any. I said I didn't have anything to do with anything like that, and they started beating me.\n\nThe police drove me to Oued es-Saguia [a wadi, or dry riverbed, in the desert outside the city]. They took off my clothes, poured cold water on my body, and hit me with clubs. They asked again where I had gotten flags and pamphlets. I said I had nothing to do with flags or pamphlets. They threatened to rape me with their batons. I tried to keep them off me but I was in handcuffs and could not keep them from poking me with their club. One of them took out a knife and threatened to cut off my genitals, saying, \"If you hand out any pamphlets, I will cut it off.\" One of them also took out a lighter and made as if he was going to burn the end of my penis. They also threatened to dig me a grave then and there.\n\nThen they said that if I worked for them they would give me money and a mobile phone. When I refused, they clubbed me again. This went on until about 11 p.m. Then one of them got a phone call, and when the call finished, they stopped beating me, had me get dressed again and transported me to the police station on November 24 Street. They photographed me and asked me more questions.\n\nI slept at the station that night. In the morning they questioned me some more: \"Where are you getting these flags and pamphlets? Is there anybody in your family from the Polisario?\" I told them, \"I don't have any relatives in the Polisario.\" They released me at about one in the afternoon.\n\nI recognized one of the ones who arrested me. He was tall and beefy, with a mustache, but I didn't know his name. During the interrogation, I recognized [officers] Behri and Aziz \"et-Touheimeh.\"\n\nEz-Zai'ar showed us the report of a medical examination conducted by a doctor at a state hospital on January 24, 2007, the day after his release from custody. It notes multiple bruises on the back of his shoulders and thighs and on his right wrist, swelling on the side of his neck and on the back of his head, and scratches all along both legs.\n\nEz-Zai'ar submitted a complaint to the prosecutor's office in El-Ayoun, detailing what happened to him and asking for an investigation. (The date of the complaint is illegible.) Assistant prosecutor Abdennasser Barzali told Human Rights Watch that they closed ez-Zai'ar's complaint on April 9, 2007 due to \"lack of evidence.\" Ez-Zai'ar told us that after submitting his complaint, authorities never contacted him about it, neither to solicit further testimony or other evidence, nor to inform him that they were closing the file.\n\nOmar Chtouki\n\nChtouki, a resident of"
