        "text": "Baz Luhrmann (born September 17, 1962, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) is an Australian filmmaker, writer, and producer known for his lavish productions, over-the-top techniques, and emphasis on heightened reality. Among his best-known films are Moulin Rouge! (2001) and The Great Gatsby (2013).\n\nLuhrmann grew up in the outback town of Herons Creek, New South Wales. There his parents ran several businesses, including a gas station and a movie theatre. There too he developed an interest in many of the activities that inform his films: dance (his mother was a ballroom dance instructor), theatre, and music of all sorts, including opera. When his parents’ marriage broke up, Luhrmann (12 years old) elected to stay with his father. Three years later, to escape his new stepmother, he moved to Sydney to live with his mother. Away from the influence of his father, who had insisted that his sons keep their hair very short, Luhrmann was free to make his own decisions about his appearance. It was during that phase of his life that he received the mocking nickname “Baz,” a reference to Basil Brush, a jokey bushy-tailed fox hand puppet with a popular show on BBC television. In 1979 Luhrmann embraced the nickname and adopted the first name Bazmark, thereby acknowledging, as he later put it, “the two sides of who I am.”\n\n(Read Martin Scorsese’s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nHis first attempt to gain entrance to Sydney’s National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, he won a role in the film Winter of Our Dreams (1981), featuring Judy Davis and Bryan Brown. During that period he also acted in four early episodes of the long-running television drama A Country Practice (1981–93). On his second attempt he was accepted by NIDA. While at school he worked with the Australian Opera company—resident at the Sydney Opera House—to help in their efforts to connect with a younger audience. He also was chosen to work with English producer-director Peter Brook on Brook’s 1985 theatrical production of The Mahabharata, based on the ancient Indian epic. Luhrmann graduated from NIDA in 1985 with a degree in acting.\n\nIn 1986 Luhrmann wrote and directed a play called Strictly Ballroom and, drawing on his experiences with the Australian Opera, worked on several opera productions and also wrote (1987; with composer Felix Meagher) the experimental opera Lake Lost. Among his many other activities, he created a much-touted production of La Bohème (1990, 1993, 1996), which he successfully took to the U.S. in 2002–03. His mockumentary film Strictly Ballroom (1992), based on his play of the same name, was the first of his films to win multiple awards. He followed with Romeo + Juliet (1996), a modern reinterpretation of Shakespeare’s play, set in Miami Beach, Florida; it starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. Moulin Rouge! (2001) is a musical set in Paris at the turn of the 20th century. Together those three films became known as Luhrmann’s Red Curtain trilogy, linked not by plot or subject but by a style that reflected the writer-director’s interest in stage conventions. In 1997 Luhrmann and his wife, Catherine Martin, established Bazmark Inq, a production company with several subsidiaries in various fields.\n\nLuhrmann’s next filmic effort was the multithemed Australia (2008), starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman; it unleashed a fierce national debate over its historical accuracy, though its director had not intended a documentary. Luhrmann’s following project was a series of eight short videos—featuring Judy Davis as fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, who died in 1973, and contemporary designer Miuccia Prada—made in conjunction with New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art 2012 exhibition “Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations.”\n\nIn 2013 Luhrmann released The Great Gatsby, his much-anticipated version of American icon F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel of the same name. The film starred DiCaprio as the title character. It had Luhrmann’s distinctive stamp, not only in its narrative twist—the novel’s narrator, Nick Carraway, is portrayed in the film as the author of the novel—but in its often vertiginous camera work, operatic scenes, anachronistic musical score, and general embrace of excess."
