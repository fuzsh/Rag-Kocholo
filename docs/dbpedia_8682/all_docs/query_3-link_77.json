        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn July 2012, a documentary entitled Ballplayer: Pelotero (âPeloteroâ) focused new attention on how Major League Baseball (âMLBâ) teams recruit players in the Dominican Republic.[1] The film caused controversy because of its critical portrayal of the MLB system. This controversy connects to long-running debates about MLBâs behavior in Latin American countriesâa debate that includes concerns that MLBâs operations in these countries adversely affect the human rights of children. This Insight describes Pelotero, locates it within the relationship between MLBâs Latin American activities and human rights norms, and analyzes MLBâs latest efforts at reforming its Latin American operations.\n\nBallplayer: PeloteroâThe New Documentary\n\nPelotero tells the stories of two sixteen-year old Dominican players, Miguel Angel SanÃ³ and Jean Carlos Batista, both of whom were determined to escape poverty through baseball. As the film notes early on, the Dominican Republic is the most important foreign source of talent for MLB, supplying twenty percent of all minor and major league players.[2] The film focuses on events from March-October 2009. The film begins with MLB teams identifying SanÃ³ and Batista as top prospects, meaning they might command significant signing bonuses. Unlike amateur players in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico, who are subject to the amateur draft, prospects in Latin America are free agents who can sign with the team that offers the most money. The film portrays SanÃ³ as one of the two best sixteen-year old prospects, with the potential to receive a record-breaking signing bonus of $5,000,000 or $6,000,000.[3]\n\nHowever, things fall apart for both players. Allegations emerge that SanÃ³ was lying about his identity and age, triggering an investigation by the MLB and an agonizing process that delays his signing for months and significantly reduces his signing bonus. SanÃ³, his family, and agent believe the allegations reflect collusion between a scout for a MLB team, who wanted to sign SanÃ³ for less money, and an MLB officials in the Dominican Republic, who wanted to limit signing-bonus escalation for top Dominican prospects. Batista rejects the first offer he receives but then is suspended for a year by the MLB for lying about his age. Batista eventually signed for a much-reduced bonus after the suspension expired.\n\nThrough these stories, the filmmakers expose a system rife with abuses. In the Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern observed that the film âdepicts a recruitment process that . . . [is] all about the dehumanizing power of money, and growing kids into superstars at bargain-basement prices[.]â[4] Neil Genzlinger of the New York Times stated that it âshows a shady business in which scouts and the teams they represent try to manipulate teenage players, and to some extent the players do some manipulating of their own.â[5] Kenneth Turan wrote in the Los Angeles Times that it is âa damning filmâ that exposes âa flawed, potentially exploitative system and how it is being gamed from all sides of the tableâthe story of the collision of youthful dreams and a cutthroat adult cartel.â[6]\n\nMLB criticized the film, asserting that it is inaccurate, contains misrepresentations, and does not reflect changes MLB made in the Dominican Republic after the events depicted.[7] In the film, the filmmakers note that no one at MLB agreed to be interviewed for it,[8] while acknowledging that MLB is changing how MLB teams recruit and sign Dominican prospects.[9] In response to MLBâs accusation of inaccuracy, the filmmakers observe that MLB did not specifically identify any particular inaccuracy in the film.[10]\n\nBuying and Selling Children: Pelotero and Controversies Concerning MLBâs Operations in Latin America\n\nPelotero highlights themes that have caused controversies concerning MLBâs activities in Latin America for over a decadeâthe system targets children living in poverty and fosters abuses by those involved in it. Pelotero illustrates how MLB emphasizes signing sixteen-year old players, stimulating efforts to begin developing prospects at even younger ages. The film estimates that over 100,000 boys train full time in baseball facilities across the Dominican Republic for the chance to sign a MLB contract.[11] The trainers, or buscones, for SanÃ³ and Batista acknowledge that the system involves buying and selling children as commodities,[12] echoing earlier critiques about MLBâs targeting of children.[13] By contrast, amateur players in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico are not eligible for the MLB draft until they complete high school,[14] typically at age eighteen.\n\nInternational human rights law recognizes that people under eighteen are children who require heightened care and protection, especially children living in poverty, who are more vulnerable to economic exploitation.[15] From a human rights perspective, the Dominican government and MLB are responsible for adequately regulating commercial activities that focus on children. The Dominican Republic is party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, recognizes eighteen as the age of majority and has obligations to protect children from potentially exploitative and abusive behavior by non-state actors operating in its territory. As the governance body of a transnational, multibillion dollar business, MLB has human rights responsibilities, including demonstrating awareness of human rights issues connected with the location of its operations (e.g., developing countries), understanding how its business activities might raise human rights concerns (e.g., targeting children as sources of labor), and taking responsibility to prevent and protect against human rights problems connected with such activities.[16]\n\nPelotero reveals neither the Dominican government nor MLB fulfilling their human rights duties. In the film, SanÃ³ and his family meet with the head of the Dominican Baseball Commission, a government agency, about the problems they are experiencing with the MLB investigation. The Commissioner tells them that MLB is âa monopolyâ that âgovern[s] the business, and make[s] the rules of the gameâ and that he can only provide advice[17] âa surprising statement for a government official to make about commercial activities affecting an estimated 100,000 children. The Commissioner explains that â[p]eople take advantage of poverty here. . . . This is happening [to SanÃ³] because heâs poor.â[18] This scene reinforces long-standing criticisms that the Dominican government has failed to regulate MLBâs activities adequately pursuant to its human rights obligations.\n\nAs for MLB, critics have argued for years that its system for recruiting, signing, and training young players in Latin American countries exploits and discriminates against children. When MLB teams began recruiting in Latin America, MLB had no rules regulating the process, contrasting with the structured and regulated process by which MLB teams scouted, signed, and trained minor league players from North America and (later) Puerto Rico.\n\nIn response to criticism and high-profile incidents of abuses, MLB began to apply some rules, starting in 1984 with the rule that established sixteen as the minimum signing age.[19] In 2000, MLB opened an office in the Dominican Republic to provide better oversight of its Latin American operations. Later, MLB adopted rules and guidelines to ensure the provision of Spanish-language versions of contracts and adequate living and playing conditions.\n\nHowever, Latin Americaâs importance as a source of talent continued to grow, causing increased signing bonuses for top prospects. In this environment, MLB struggled with new problems, such as abuse of performance-enhancing drugs, team abuse of tryouts to hide players from other clubs, age and identity fraud, corruption by team officials, and abuses by buscones. Pelotero touches upon rules adopted to address some of these problems, including drug testing and investigations into age and identity. However, MLBâs reactive, ad hoc approach to addressing problems constitutes âaborted and timid efforts . . . to address the exploitation of young baseball talent.â[20]\n\nIronically, MLB reached a similarly harsh judgment about its Dominican operations at the same time Pelotero was filmed. After yet more scandals, the MLB Commissioner appointed a committee in May 2009 chaired by Sandy Alderson to examine MLBâs Dominican operations and make recommendations for reform. The Alderson committee produced a report in September 2009âcontemporaneously with events depicted in Peloteroâreflecting the depth of the problems and the need for comprehensive reform.[21] As Alderson put it, âthe system as it currently exists canât continue;â it is time to âclean up the abusesâ[22] and put an end to âkids being manipulated and victimized.â[23]\n\nMLB Moves Toward Comprehensive Reform: From the Alderson Committee Report to the New Basic Agreement\n\nThe Alderson Committee Report\n\nThe Alderson committeeâs report was âan ambitious reform blueprintâ indicating that MLB might be âpoised to end its long history of exploiting Latin Americans[.]â[24] The report identified problems depicted in Pelotero, including questionable investigations by MLB and corruption involving MLB team officials.[25] The committee emphasized that MLB might need to institute an international draft to regulate how teams access Latin American talent.[26]\n\nAlthough the report was not a human rights assessment, it highlighted weaknesses in MLBâs governance of its Dominican operations and emphasized MLBâs responsibility to strengthen such governance through better rules, strategies, and investments in oversight capabilities. The behavior of the Dominican government, buscones, and prospects contributed to the problems, but the Alderson committee accepted that MLB bore heightened responsibility. As a MLB vice president put it, âwe recognize our responsibility . . . and that we have to constantly reevaluate the way we do business to make sure we are not creating perverse incentives to engage in behavior we know is wrong.â[27]\n\nThe New Basic Agreement\n\nThe deadline the Alderson committee set for its reformsâJuly 2, 2010âpassed without implementation. Aldersonâs departure to become General Manager of the New York Mets in October 2010 raised questions about future reform of MLBâs Latin American operations. However, even more radical reform appeared in the 2012-2016 Basic Agreement finalized at the end of 2011 in collective bargaining between MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (âMLBPAâ).[28]\n\nThe Basic Agreement creates a draft-like processâcalled the âSigning Bonus Poolâ mechanismââto regulate signing international amateur players,[29] the vast majority of which come from Latin America. Although MLB and MLBPA continue to discuss a formal international draft, the Basic Agreement functions like a draft in limiting signing bonuses and increasing competitive balance by giving teams with losing records in the prior season more opportunities to attract the best international prospects.[30]\n\nIn addition, the Basic Agreement created an International Talent Committee tasked with negotiating whether MLB adopts an international draft and addressing problems related to MLBâs Latin American operations.[31] For example, the International Talent Committee will discuss the minimum age for teams to sign international amateursâindicating potential willingness to depart from the pervasive but much-criticized âyounger is betterâ mentality, which Pelotero highlights.[32] The Basic Agreement also established an Education Committee, tasked with assisting âinternational players who are not drafted, or are released prior to reaching the Major Leagues, with their transition to educational/vocational programs or the workforce.â[33]\n\nThe first application of the âSigning Bonus Poolâ mechanism to Latin American prospects occurred in July 2012, and, as of this writing, little is publicly known about how it functioned. In addition, the mechanism contains features that raise questions about whether it will change how MLB teams recruit and sign Latin American prospects. For example, the Basic Agreement allows teams to sign an unlimited number of international amateurs for bonuses of $7,500 or less in the 2012-2013/2013-2014 seasons and $10,000 or less in the 2014-2015/2015-2016 seasons.[34] Thus, signing bonuses for most Latin American prospects are unlikely to exceed these exempted amounts during the life of the Basic Agreement. In other words, MLB has found another way to allow teams to sign many Latin American players cheaply. Peloteroâs focus on two top prospects did not illuminate problems the vast majority of Dominican prospects encounter, but, from a human rights perspective, these problems are equally important to address in reforms.\n\nCombined with the signing bonus limits for top prospects, the âLatin players on the cheapâ[35] strategy underscores that MLBâs primary interest is to lower costs for accessing Latin talent. In addition, the Basic Agreement does not address many problems the Alderson committee identified, other than to have the International Talent Committee discuss a limited number of them. Again, as of this writing, what the International Talent Committee has agreed, if anything, is not publicly known.[36]\n\nConclusion\n\nThe changes in the Basic Agreement constitute the most radical reforms MLB has ever made to its operations in Latin America, and the International Talent Committee might supplement these reforms with more changes, including potentially imposing regulations on buscones, increasing the age of signing eligibility, and adopting an international draft. Assessing whether these reforms move MLB away from what Pelotero depicts and closer to fulfilling its human rights responsibilities requires more information than is presently available.\n\nIn addition, MLB faces opposition in the Dominican Republic to these changes, especially the idea of an international draft. Those opposed include representatives of the Dominican government,[37]which potentially puts the two entities with human rights responsibilities in this context directly at oddsânot a scenario conducive to fulfilling these responsibilities under the increased scrutiny Pelotero has created.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nArturo J.
