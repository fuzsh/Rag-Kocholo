        "text": "Directors: Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones\n\nIt’s been announced recently that there will be a sequel series to Fawlty Towers, one of the finest sitcoms of all time. This news leaves me conflicted, as it’s always been the go-to example of how British shows are better at having shorter seasons and fewer episodes, ending on a high rather than milking the formula until the result becomes tasteless. It seems almost certain that Cleese will not be able to recapture the magic of the original series, unless there is some miracle.\n\nThis news, however, does inspire me to revisit the original classics of Cleese’s career. I was introduced to Monty Python at a tender age and essentially grew up with their comedy, buying the 45-episode DVD boxset when I found it at a store as a teenager. Holy Grail, in particular, was shown to me early on, and I remember hardly being able to breathe from laughing at the Knights of the Round Table song, which tickled me endlessly as a child; I remember specifically that a DVD extra was the same video rendered in Lego, making it even funnier somehow.\n\nOn today’s rewatch, the scene didn’t quite hold its rib-tickling power over me, but I was amazed by how well I remembered this film. Determined to be quite separate from any Hollywood-style comedy, the Pythons put the jokes first and foremost, with the story of the quest for the Holy Grail hardly making any sense whatsoever. As a result, it mirrors the troupe’s TV series, based on sketches alone.\n\nWhat surprised me most was that the funniest, most iconic scenes of the film were loaded at the front. These were the scenes I could quote the most easily: “moistened bint”, “watery tart”, “your mother was an ‘amster and your father smelled of elderberries”, “fetchez la vache” and “it’s just a flesh wound” are quotes that have lived in my memory since childhood. In particular, I’ve always loved the style of comedy that includes saying the same things over and over using synonyms for hilarious effect.\n\nDon’t get me wrong though, the level of humour is solid throughout, but there is a sense of waning energy as the film goes on. It feels almost as if the Python’s are finding their natural limit for how long they can keep the film at a high. Quite naturally, some scenes aren’t as big hitters as others, such as when Michael Palin encounters the castle full of scantily clad women, although there is a nice fourth-wall-breaking moment where the characters from upcoming scenes urge them to ‘get on with it!”\n\nWhen it comes to ranking the Python films, most people either list The Holy Grail or Life of Brian as their favourite – I was always the black sheep, as I personally preferred Meaning of Life, as it was the most outrageous, although it’s been a while since I have viewed all three films. Aptly, the first two also happen to be the ones featured on the list. As a child, I always felt the ending was a letdown; we neither get to see the battle, nor Arthur finally completing the quest for the Holy Grail. It brought the film’s value down, in my eyes.\n\nAs an adult, I now see that the Pythons saw an opening for a truly unexpected, non-sequitur ending – the type that I’m sure Hitchcock would have applauded – and took it. After all, the story really never mattered in the first place, this was a film about jokes. Nevertheless, it can’t help but feel like a slight poke in the eye to anyone who was even a little invested in the farcical tale. On this rewatch, I realised the ending feels all the more sudden because the film features a brief “Intermission” roughly ten minutes from the end of the film, which might confuse the audience into thinking there was a lot more to go. Even though I now ‘get’ the shock ending, I still don’t find it particularly satisfying or funny.\n\nNevertheless, the sour note does little to dampen this comedic triumph, which boosted recognition for the troupe internationally and introduced the American population en masse to this more surreal type of comedy. This was Gilliam’s first film as director, which he directed alongside Terry Jones. The two had a pretty steep learning curve, apparently, and it’s evident that the two were learning what to do on the job, as some scenes aren’t very slick at all, but that only adds to the humour.\n\n8/10"
