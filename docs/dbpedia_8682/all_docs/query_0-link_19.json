Despite its title, the book’s discussion of the “American experience” was largely confined to a narrative and analysis of General Joseph Stilwell’s tour of duty as the top U.S. commander in the China Burma India Theater during World War II. Stilwell also served as Chief of Staff to Chinese premier Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek, administrator of Lend -Lease and sometimes commanded Chinese troops as well.

However, they remain poorly understood, and there are no reference materials to help newcomers find their way through the conflicts' complexities. This project is creating a biographical index of people who lived during and participated in the violence, as well as a geographical index of the many obscure places where, for example, battles took place. So far, about 750 unique entries have been created. There is much more information to incorporate from diverse primary sources across several languages.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: 1. Seek out new information from English-language sources (digital and print) under Prof. Schluessel's direction. Sources include translated materials and mostly British intelligence documents. 2. Incorporate Prof. Schluessel's written notes into new biographical and geographical entries through Google Docs. You will be provided with many\n\nexamples to work from. (3. If the student has Russian or Chinese language skills, they may be asked to use documents in those languages. However, Russian or Chinese is not required.)\n\nNumber of openings: 1\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 3-5 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 2 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Schluessel ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Paula Alonso\n\nDepartment: History and International Affairs\n\nResearch Title: A Concise History of Argentina\n\nDescription: I am currently writing a book (under-contract) on the History of Argentina until the present day centered on the country's history of democracy (and its challenges).\n\nAt the moment I am working on the period between 1946 to 2000 that covers topics such as the rise of Juan Domingo and Eva Perón to power, military dictatorships (1955-1976); guerrilla organizations, State Terror, Human Rights violations and Transition to Democracy.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: Bibliographical searches; summary of readings on certain topics; and literature reviews. Most of the literature is in Spanish, so reading (not speaking) Spanish skills are required.\n\nNumber of openings: 1\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 6 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 1 credit\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Alonso ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Sharon Wolchik\n\nDepartment: PSC\n\nResearch Title: Women Under Communism\n\nDescription: Updating a MS on the status of women under communism.

The student would compile an annotated bibliography of works that have appeared since 2015 and assist in creating narrative summaries of life history narratives that I have recorded. Much of this material has been translated, but some knowledge of German is required. A second task would be to assist in organizing an exhibition about East German Literary Culture at GWU. This would involve various research-related as well as creative tasks and organizational responsibilities.\n\nNumber of openings: 1\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 3-5 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 1 credit\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Stein ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: William Youmans\n\nDepartment: SMPA\n\nResearch Title: Digitizing Arab-American TV\n\nDescription: Arab-American TV was a bilingual TV program that aired out of Los Angeles from 1980 to 2005. I am digitizing its video collection and creating a searchable catalog that lists the topics, who appears in the video and other data. The catalog and the videos will be made public for researchers, journalists and anyone else who may be interested to use. The collection is a contribution because it covers many important community events, and features newsmakers from the Arab world and beyond.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: The research assistant watches videos and analyzes them to cull data. They complete the fields that are in the catalog. There could also be simple video editing work if the RA is interested. The ideal RA understands Arabic, modern standard. This project will also expose RAs to colloquial Arabic as well.\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 5-7 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 3 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Youmans ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Eric Grynaviski\n\nDepartment: Political Science\n\nResearch Title: English Social Networks\n\nDescription: This project examines social networks in Anglo-Saxon England. We are in the process of developing a database of all social relations in Anglo-Saxon England in order to test theories of society and state formation. The benefit of this period is that there are accessible datasets and historical sources that summarize all social relations (real and imagined) during the period. This would be fun for students interested in political science or history, as well as students in data science or computer science.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: The hours are variable depending on student availability. To start with, students would compare a table against an online dataset to examine it for accuracy. This table was \"scrapped\" from the online dataset and the webscraping process introduced errors.\n\nFor student who are familiar with historical sources, they will use prosopographical sources to draw connections between historical figures and see how professional historians do this type of work. Students in computer science or data science are likely to learn something about complex webscraping operations. The emphasis will be different depending on the type\n\nof student.\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 3-5 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 2 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Grynaviski ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: David Shambaugh\n\nDepartment: Political Science/Elliott School\n\nResearch Title: The Unravelling: How America Turned Against China\n\nDescription: My book project investigates the seismic shift in American attitudes and policies towards China over the past decade--from cooperative \"engagement\" to one of disenchantment, antagonism, and comprehensive rivalry. The project investigates why and how this shift has occurred in the United States, its durability, and its implications for US foreign policy, US-China relations, and world order.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: I am looking for two RA's: one with native Chinese (PRC) language skills who is able to read, translate, and summarize Chinese media and reports (simplified characters) about the United States; and one student knowledgeable about American Politics. For the second RA, I prefer someone very knowledgeable about (a) Congressional legislation and voting concerning China, and (b) governors and state relations with China.\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 5-7 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 3 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Shambaugh ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Alexa Alice Joubin\n\nDepartment: English and Honors Program\n\nResearch Title: Shakespeare and Social Justice\n\nDescription: This project examines how our contemporary worldwide performances of Shakespeare adapt the plays for social justice causes. Through the lenses of critical race and gender theories, this project de-colonizes the ways in which people habitually interpret Shakespeare’s plays. The chapters focus on racialized bodies, performance of gender and sexuality, disability narratives, feminist interventions, class struggle, and intersectional identities.\n\nThe recent social justice turn in the arts has given contemporary relevance and purpose to the canon. Emotional investment in a story spurs people into action, and it is validating and encouraging for audiences to see themselves represented on screen.\n\nThe project produces two books, and the research assistant will have exciting and active roles to play in producing them. The first is a collection of essays on the lesser-known play Pericles. The second is a textbook version of the comedy Much Ado About Nothing. Both books take a global approach to the plays.\n\nThis books demonstrate the application of strategies for global inclusiveness to Shakespeare studies in the classroom and suggests that we can gain empathy by analyzing complex cultural texts such as Shakespeare in adaptation. Global perspectives can help us tackle the pervasive Whiteness of Shakespeare studies.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties:\n\nAssist in producing the index for one of the books.\n\nAssist in obtaining, electronically or in person, research materials from the library.\n\nCollate and summarize previous research on the topic.\n\nAssist in ensuring the manuscript's compliance with the MLA citation style.\n\nReceive substantive research related assignments\n\nCollect and download the reviews\n\nPrepare the index to the book\n\nTraining will be provided\n\nRegular meeting with faculty over Zoom or in person\n\nNumber of openings: 1\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 1-3 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 1 credit\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Joubin ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Deborah Boucoyannis\n\nDepartment: Political Science\n\nResearch Title: Comparison of Democracy Scores of Russia and Turkey in 1990s\n\nDescription: The task is quite simple but requires some familiarity with the major democracy scores, Polity, V-Dem, Boix and Rosato, and Svolik. You will simply record the main democracy score for Russia and Turkey between 1990 and 2000, as well as for 2010, 2015, and 2020.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: You want to enter the democracy scores in an Excel Sheet.\n\nNumber of openings: 1\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 1-3 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 0 - No credit option\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Boucoyannis ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Daisy Le\n\nDepartment: School of Nursing: Policy, Populations and Systems\n\nResearch Title: Community Health Advocacy, Resolutions, and Messaging (I-CHARM)\n\nDescription: The Innovations in Community Health Advocacy, Resolutions, and Messaging (I-CHARM) research lab, under the leadership of Dr. Le, seeks to enhance community health awareness, outreach, and advocacy efforts by (1) identifying barriers to healthcare access and (2) developing effective, sustainable, and respectful strategies for intervention development, implementation, and evaluation. Locally based in the DC area at George Washington University, the I-CHARM lab focuses on improving health behaviors and outcomes in underserved and vulnerable populations and has partnered with both government and community-based organizations to serve the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan (WBMA) community. Recent projects have focused on HPV self-sampling acceptability, vaping cessation strategies, HBV vaccination and testing, and the efficacy of digital/mobile technology in promoting healthy behaviors.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: The Student Research Assistant will work with a small research team and gain valuable experience in conducting community-engaged health disparities research and intervention study development, implementation, and evaluation.

I previously worked with an undergraduate student, pursuing a sustainability minor, to investigate and identify the need for publishing services at GW. We are looking for a research assistant examine this in more depth. Under the supervision of the Program Director, and a pair of MPS in Publishing graduate students, the student will research and document what departments, schools, and institutes at GW may be interested in having the GW Publishing program assist with publishing projects, such as journals, white papers, capstone projects, open educational resources (OERs) etc. We are using a publishing platform called Manifold (https://gwpress.manifoldapp.org/) that would allow us to help departments, schools, and institutes to publish these materials online. A research assistant could help by identifying needs, whether these services would or could be charged for, funding opportunities, and so forth.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: Research and document potential departments, schools, and institutes at GW who may be interested publishing projects, such as journals, white papers, capstone projects, open educational resources (OERs) etc., collaborating with the GW MPS in Publishing program. Identify needs, investigate whether these services would or could be charged for, identify potential funding opportunities.\n\nNumber of openings: 1\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 1-3 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 1 credit\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Warren ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Harris Mylonas\n\nDepartment: Political Science\n\nResearch Title: Enemies Within\n\nDescription: I am currently completing the production of an edited volume entitled Enemies Within: The Global Politics of Fifth Columns (co-edited with Scott Radnitz). For more info:\n\nhttps://global.oup.com/academic/product/enemies-within-9780197627945?cc=us&lang=en&#\n\nAt this stage we need help with final proof-reading and indexing.\n\n\"The invocation of fifth columns in the political arena -- whether contrived or based on real fears -- has recurred periodically throughout history and is experiencing an upsurge in our era of democratic erosion and geopolitical uncertainty. Fifth columns accusations can have baleful effects on governance and trust, as they call into question the loyalty and belonging of the targeted populations. They can cause human rights abuses, political repression, and even ethnic cleansing. Enemies Within is the first book to systematically investigate the roots and implications of the politics of fifth columns. In this volume, a multidisciplinary group of leading scholars address several related questions: When are actors likely to employ fifth-column claims and against whom? What accounts for changes in fifth-column framing over time? How do the claims and rhetoric of governments differ from those of societal groups? How do accusations against ethnically or ideologically defined groups differ? Finally, how do actors labeled as fifth columns respond? To answer these questions, the contributors apply a common theoretical framework and work within the tradition of qualitative social science to analyze cases from three continents, oftentimes challenging conventional wisdom. Enemies Within offers a unique perspective to better understand contemporary challenges including the rise of populism and authoritarianism, the return of chauvinistic nationalism, the weakening of democratic norms, and the persecution of ethnic or religious minorities and political dissidents.\"\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: Proof-reading chapters, looking into the references and solving queries, help with generating the index of the book.\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 1-3 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 1 credit\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Mylonas ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Leah Brooks\n\nDepartment: Trachtenberg School\n\nResearch Title: Democratic Governance and Citizen Participation: A Textual Analysis\n\nDescription: Since at least de Tocqueville, social thinkers have argued that citizen participation improves democratic governance. In our project, we ask whether, over the last century, the federal government has increased opportunity for public participation. We define participation to include pre-policy behavior such as voting, behavior near the policy decision such as lobbying, and ex-post behavior including litigation. We analyze the amount of participation using the text of all statutes passed in the United States since 1920. We use text analysis tools to measure the extent to which the government requires the executive branch to allow or encourage participation. We then evaluate whether this measure of participation correlates to indicia of realized participation including voting and litigation.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties:\n\nDuties:\n\nHelp us software to program the conversion of PDF files into a corpus of machine-readable text to be used for further analysis\n\nSkills: experience with Python, careful reading and analytical skills\n\nPreferred skills: history with natural language processing techniques, PDF parsing software\n\nSkills you may gain:\n\nHow to approach a research question\n\nHow to digitize large documents into an analyzable corpus\n\nHow to work in a high performance computing environment\n\nUnderstand how federal statutes are constructed\n\nNumber of openings: 1\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 5-7 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 3 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Brooks ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: W. Douglas Evans\n\nDepartment: Public Health, Prevention and Community Health\n\nResearch Title: Digital Media for Cancer Control: Randomized Controlled Trial and Dose Response Effects\n\nDescription: There is little published data on exposure to and evaluations of large-scale, online tobacco control campaigns. The project addresses this gap. Under two specific aims, we will identify the independent effects of varying levels of digital message exposure to promote anti-tobacco attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors among youth and young adults, first through a randomized experiment online, and second through a field-based evaluation. These studies will advance the science of digital health and have wide application to future campaigns.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: Research assistants will be expected to work with faculty and team members at GW, NYU, Truth Initiative*, and engage in the following research activities:\n\nWork on literature review\n\nAssist with survey development and data collection\n\nAttend meetings\n\nPossibly assist with data analysis and writing manuscripts for papers\n\n* Truth Initiative is America’s largest nonprofit public health organization committed to making tobacco use and nicotine addiction a thing in the past.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for those who are interested in public health research and disease prevention through digital media that can expand your experience and career.\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 3-5 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 2 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: Professor Evans ([email protected])\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Sarah Shomstein\n\nDepartment: Psychological and Brain Sciences\n\nResearch Title: Attentional priorities in natural scenes\n\nDescription: The project explores neural and psychological mechanisms responsible for attentional selection (our brain's ability to figure out which information to process and which to ignore)\n\nResearch Assistant Duties:\n\nAssist with day-to-day running of the cognitive neuroscience lab\n\nAssist with data collection assist with data analysis\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 7-9 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 3 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: [email protected]\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Janet Steele\n\nDepartment: SMPA\n\nResearch Title: Visual Misinformation in Global Perspective\n\nDescription: I am one of a team of researchers working on a project that utilizes survey experiments to test whether visual memes are more effective than text in leading users to recall factually inaccurate information, believe that information, and share it online. It also examines the role of different digital platforms (Facebook versus WhatsApp) in either helping or hindering the sharing of misinformation, as well as how particular institutional and social characteristics shape these phenomena. The project involves analysis of data from eight different countries on five continents, and I have agreed to do the analysis of Indonesia.\n\nWe have completed the initial phase, in which we identified specific memes involving misinformation that have spread on Facebook and WhatsApp, and developed survey questions and translated them into Indonesian. An international research company will conduct the survey experiment, and I will later be asked to analyze the results and write the narrative for the section on Indonesia.\n\nPlease note that applications for this position must be submitted by September 6.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: Please note: knowledge of Indonesian is NOT required for this project.\n\nI need someone who can help me find photos that illustrate our 8 different issues/topics. For each of the issues, four the images must be \"high arousal,\" and four must be \"low arousal,\" meaning that we will need a total of 64 images. Although this sounds simple, it is actually quite time-consuming, as there are a number of other requirements. For each of the 8 issues we identified the images need to be:\n\n1. Either copyright-free or published by a reputable news organization that credits the copyright owners so we can credit them again.\n\n2. The images do not have to come from Indonesia or from Indonesian news sources, as long as they are good illustrations of the misinformation we are showing participants.\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 4-6 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 2 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: [email protected]\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Ellen Yeung\n\nDepartment: Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences\n\nTitle: Investigation of the Relationship between Substance Use and Pain\n\nDescription: Approximately 1 in 5 Americans, suffer from severe and/or persistent pain. Substance use/misuse and chronic pain frequently co-occur. Multiple studies have revealed an association between them showing the onset of substance use/misuse precedes people’s reports of chronic pain in some populations, and vice versa in other populations. You may wonder why this is the case. Do current substance users or people with a history of substance use/misuse show higher pain sensitivity? Do they report a heightened analgesic effect that in turn leads to greater likelihood of self-medication with alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, or opioids? Would chronic pain patients who rate higher on certain personality traits and/or loneliness be more at risk of substance use disorders? Do these devastating health conditions manifest similar physiological dysregulation that has been implicated in the brain reward and stress pathways? If you are interested in seeking answers to these questions, please consider joining my scientific effort to help people manage their substance use and chronic pain. I am recruiting conscientious and motivated undergraduate students to work as research assistants in my lab.\n\nDuties: In this role, you will gain experience in recruiting and interviewing participants in the community, preparing and administering study materials, and managing electronic diary studies. Furthermore, during research assistant training, we will discuss theories of substance use disorders and chronic pain, as well as the research methodology and statistical techniques that allow us to address the research questions relevant to their co-occurrence. Together, we will review the literature, develop and organize a digital library, and code the research studies. In the future, when in person training is permitted, you will have the opportunity to get an insider's look at, and hands-on experience with, the process of assessing several physiological indices via state-of-the-art equipment and software. In short, you will gain important research skills highly valued in graduate and medical programs, while making a meaningful contribution to the accumulation of knowledge on substance use and chronic pain.\n\nTime commitment: 6-8 hours per week (average)\n\nCredit hour option*: 2\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nSubmit Cover Letter/Resume to: [email protected]\n\n*If credit is sought, all registration deadlines and requirements must be met.\n\nProfessor: Alessandra Fenizia\n\nDepartment: Economics\n\nTitle: Preventive Care in the Times of COVID\n\nDescription: The current pandemic has reshaped our lives in ways we did not anticipate and forced us to change our routines and plans. Most commentators have focused on the devastating effects of the virus and how to tackle the pandemic effectively. Less attention has been devoted how the epidemic has shifted attention and resources away from other realms of medicine. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many patients have skipped their routine checkups and avoided visiting the hospital or their primary physician unless it was truly necessary. What is the value of preventive care? What is the impact of skipping or postponing a routine checkup? How does this translate in short-term savings and long-term costs for the healthcare system?\n\nDuties: review of the literature on preventive care, proof editing preliminary drafts, collecting qualitative and quantitative data\n\nTime commitment: 4-6 hours per week (average)\n\nCredit hour option*: 2\n\nNumber of openings: 1\n\nSubmit Cover Letter/Resume to: [email protected]\n\n*If credit is sought, all registration deadlines and requirements must be met.\n\nProfessor: Harris Mylonas\n\nDepartment: Political Science\n\nTitle: Nationalism\n\nDescription: I’m writing a chapter for an Oxford University Press Handbook on Nation- and State-Building in Modern Greece.\n\nDuties: This project will involve reading articles and books and writing up memos summarizing findings, focusing in particular on the main institutional initiatives and events.

Defined as “a social change perspective rooted in Black women’s and other women of color’s everyday experiences and everyday methods of problem solving in everyday spaces, extended to the problem of ending all forms of oppression for all people, restoring the balance between people and the environment/nature and reconciling human life with the spiritual dimension,” (Marparyan, 2012; Phillips, 2006) Womanism is a transdisciplinary humanistic perspective, epistemology and methodology that has been employed throughout the world to address environmental issues, sexual violence and mental health, among other social issues. This project will map seminal African American literature onto the eight modalities characterizing Womanism, in an effort to explore the utility of a humanistic intervention during this political moment.\n\nThere are eight modalities characterizing Womanism: self-care healing and wellness practices, which are designed to rectify physical, emotional, mental and spiritual practices; harmonizing and coordinating, or disposition and activity to employ differential consciousness and move between divergent logics and conceptual schemes; dialogue and the power of the word, to express and establish connection and individuality as well as tension and connection; arbitration and mediation, where conflict is transformed into peace; spiritual activities, a socio-ecological transformational activity rooted in a spiritual belief system including religious participation to transmutation practices; hospitality, the transformative power of welcome that facilitates powerful encounters; mutual aid and self-help, or everyday collective grassroots methods garnered from life experience, wisdom, self-education and democratic knowledge; and motherhood, a social change methodology and social ecology that recognizes agency and interconnectivity with others.\n\nWomanism is both interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary in its theoretical framing, ontologies, epistemologies and methodologies. As a community psychologist and public health scientist, I engage in Womanism modalities in my work to disrupt cardiometabolic syndrome (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension) among Black communities. Central to this work is my curriculum of “writehealing” where I use writing to address self-care, harmonizing and coordinating and mutual aid and self-help. However, a major gap in this work is a database of relevant African American literature that can be utilized for intervention. This project offers a humanistic approach for applied impact. A database that allows the user to discover African American literature based on a Womanist modality, emotions and psychological outcomes bridges multiple disciplinary gaps.\n\nDuties:\n\nData mine, review, organize and characterize African American literature according to the Womanist modality and health behavior(s)\n\nParticipate in weekly project meetings\n\nContribute to online database management and manuscript development\n\nTime commitment: 7-9 hours per week (average)\n\nCredit hour option*: 3\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nSubmit Cover Letter/Resume to: [email protected]\n\n*If credit is sought, all registration deadlines and requirements must be met.\n\nProfessor: Sanjay Pandey\n\nDepartment: Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration\n\nTitle: Advancing anti-racism and anti-sexism through scholarship\n\nDescription: Like most RA listings, this is an unpaid assistantship.

For these reasons, cities are increasingly turning to green infrastructure as a way to address complex challenges like adapting to climate change. Dr. Keeley has developed a long-term research project examining maintenance, performance, and public perceptions of 40 bioretention systems across DC (5 in each of DC's 8 Wards). The goal of this research is to understand the performance, environmental impacts and public perceptions of this relatively novel technique as it is implemented across the city. I hope that results from this study can help improve bioretention system maintenance and design.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties:\n\nThis project requires two types of research assistants:\n\n1) DC-based:\n\nDC-based student research assistants will become IRB certified for human research methods.

He was a professor of Hebrew language and literature at the George Washington University and was a cornerstone of the university’s Judaic Studies Program for over 30 years. Ticktin was also involved in founding Hillel (prior to his work at GW), in the activities of the DCJCC, and was a central figure in the DC Fabrangen, an egalitarian and participatory Havurah (community) that was founded in 1971 and is still active to this day. All these made him a pillar of his community and a beloved instructor who inspired countless undergraduates and adult learners. But not less significant was his political activism: first, before joining DC, Rabbi Ticktin joined other clergy who stood up for women’s rights and helped women obtain information on abortions (a group known as the Clergy Consultation Service on Problem Pregnancies) and was arrested for his activities. Next, soon after the October 1973 War, Ticktin joined a small group of American-Jewish activists who founded \"Breira: A Project of Concern in Diaspora-Israel Relations\" - an organization founded calling for a two-state solution (long before it was fashionable) and who members met with leading members of the PLO. (Breira means “alternative” in Hebrew). Despite the fact it stirred a lovely controversy at the time, no historian wrote a proper study of the group Breira nor of Ticktin himself. The aim of the project is to address that gap. Significantly, Max Ticktin’s personal papers were donated by his family to GW’s Gelman Library Special Collections (Collection MS2403-UA see link) Prof. Arie Dubnov, who holds the Ticktin Chair for Israel Studies at GW, is looking for one or two Research Assistant (RAs) who will help him write an article about Ticktin’s life, learning and political activism, based on these materials.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties:\n\nThe Research Assistant (RA) will help Prof. Dubnov conduct research on the Max Ticktin Papers in preparation for a future academic publication. The main tasks will include:\n\n1. Assist Prof Dubnov in creating a chronological inventory of archival documents from the Ticktin Papers at the Gelman Library special collections.\n\n2. Research, find, and reproduce historical newspaper articles.\n\n3. Working with rare materials: conduct research, identify key documents, transcribe or order digital copies from the Library, and scan printed materials (including uncatalogued materials held privately by Prof. Dubnov)\n\n4. Identify key individuals Ticktin was in touch with and conduct a mini research about them.\n\n5. Conduct interviews with family members and former colleagues.\n\nRequired skills:\n\n• Good oral and written communication skills.\n\n• Familiarity with Excel, Dropbox, and Google Drive.\n\n• Ability to conduct online research in Historical Newspapers and similar historicales.\n\nKnowledge of Hebrew is preferable but not required.\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 3-5 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 3 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: [email protected]\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Kylie Quave\n\nDepartment: Anthropology and University Writing Program\n\nResearch Title: How Anthropologists Construct Disciplinary Norms in the Introductory Course\n\nDescription: This study documents the range of approaches to teaching archaeology and biological anthropology at different types of US universities. It is a phase of a larger project asking how the ways anthropology courses are taught may contribute to creating norms in the discipline and may contribute to inclusion and exclusion of certain kinds of students.\n\nThe study seeks submissions of syllabi from faculty at different higher education institutions for recently taught introductor courses. Those syllabi are analyzed for various attributes related to pedagogical areas of interest related to educational belonging and inclusion and related to anthropological knowledge production.\n\nStudent researchers will analyze the syllabi to gather data on inclusion of 1) content that emphasizes \"ways of knowing\" the human past, 2) texts and perspectives that emphasize multivocality and marginalized perspectives, 3) classroom activities that incorporate active learning strategies, and 4) Universal Design for Learning principles. We will record assigned texts, types of assignments, and tone of language used on syllabi that relate to student-centered learning.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties: The student will perform research tasks including: communicating with research subjects following IRB protocols, managing data entry, collecting data and coding variables for the study. The student will contribute to peer reviewed research and write research memos of findings, assist with presentations and reports, and analyze data. Other duties may be assigned as warranted and depending on the research progress.\n\nStudent should have familiarity with anthropology, preferably archaeology and/or biological anthropology, and be comfortable with using spreadsheets.\n\nNumber of openings: 2\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 1-3 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 1 credit\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: [email protected]\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Xiangyun Qiu\n\nDepartment: Physics\n\nResearch Title: Unraveling Virus Evolution through Monte Carlo Simulations and RNA-Protein Sequence Embeddings\n\nDescription: This project combines Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with RNA-protein sequence embeddings, derived from large language models (LLM), to dissect the intricate pathways of virus evolution.\n\nObjective: The primary objective is to develop a novel framework for studying virus evolution dynamics in silico. By employing MC simulations, we will simulate the stochastic processes that underlie genetic mutations, recombination events, and selection pressures acting on viral genomes. This approach will allow us to gain insights into the emergent properties and adaptive strategies of viruses.\n\nMethodology: Central to this project is the utilization of RNA-protein sequence embeddings generated by state-of-the-art large language models. These embeddings encapsulate high-dimensional representations of RNA and protein sequences, capturing their structural, functional, and evolutionary features. By integrating these embeddings with MC simulations, we aim to create an in-silico model that mimics the evolutionary dynamics of viruses.\n\nExpected Outcomes: This interdisciplinary approach holds promise in several key areas. Firstly, it will provide a deeper understanding of some of the key factors influencing virus evolution. Additionally, the project aims to unravel the complex interplay between viral genotypes (RNA) and phenotypes (protein), uncovering insights for vaccine development and therapeutic interventions.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties:\n\n1. Data Collection and Preparation:\n\n- Retrieve and compile relevant RNA sequence data from databases and sources.\n\n- Perform data quality checks and preprocess the data for further analysis.\n\n2. Embedding Generation:\n\n- Utilize large language models to generate RNA and protein sequence embeddings\n\n- Cluster embeddings and compute pairwise evolutionary distances between sequences.\n\n3. Monte Carlo Simulations:\n\n- Set up and execute Monte Carlo simulations to model virus evolution dynamics.\n\n- Monitor and troubleshoot simulations to ensure accurate and reliable results.\n\n4. Data Analysis and Visualization:\n\n- Analyze simulation outputs to extract meaningful insights regarding virus evolution.\n\n- Generate visualizations and plots to illustrate key findings.\n\n5.

Cities are increasingly prominent actors in national and international debates, but mayors and councilors are accountable to local constituents, not national or global ones. We study legislative behavior in Brazilian cities, and we evaluate a theory that the neighborhood scale of public service provision creates incentives for some voters to demand – and politicians to provide – narrow local representation. We have already web-scraped legislative actions (proposed bills, policies, and public service requests) of city councilors in municipalities that vary by region, population, and climate risk status. We need support with extracting relevant information from PDFs and using text/content analysis to categorize legislative actions.\n\nResearch Assistant Duties:\n\nThe skills requested are most applicable to a student with a background in computer science. We seek a research assistant with expert skills in Python and high attention to detail. Reading comprehension in Portuguese or Spanish is desired but not required. The research assistant will:\n\n1) Use Python and OCR to convert PDFs to text, including pre-processing the PDFs or images to improve the quality of the text extraction.\n\n2) Use Python to extract key elements of the legislative action from the text into a spreadsheet. This task may require knowledge of regular expressions and/or natural language processing.\n\n3) Use Python or R to categorize legislative actions based on the issue/service area and location of service request or constituent beneficiary group.\n\nNumber of openings: 1\n\nAverage weekly time commitment: 3-5 hours\n\nCredit hour option*: 2 credits\n\nSubmit Resume/Cover Letter to: [email protected]\n\n*If seeking academic credit, you must complete an Honors Contract.\n\nProfessor: Alexa Alice Joubin\n\nDepartment: Digitial Humanities Institute\n\nResearch Title: Research Assistant Position in AI\n\nDescription:\n\nTrustworthiness lies at the heart of current debates about generative artificial intelligence (AI).

Public health research, specifically environmental epidemiology, typically assesses these links by comparing presence of greenspace with indicators of health of the communities near them. However, because of barriers including accessibility, design, and public safety, living near a greenspace does not guarantee that all have access to it and its potential health benefits. For this research opportunity, we aim to bring together diverse datasets and develop a new approach for understanding the relationships between park access, greenness, and health outcomes.\n\nThis position offers a unique opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research at the intersection of environmental health, urban planning, and epidemiology. Interested students will receive mentoring, training, and guidance from a team with expertise in environmental epidemiology and health, environmental policy, and urban greening. Anticipated start date is Fall 2024.\n\nThis is a paid position posted on the GW Student Employment website.
