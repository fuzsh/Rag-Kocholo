        "text": "Western Sahara is an occupied territory on the northwest coast of Africa. A decades long independence struggle from Moroccan rule grips the country and shows little sign of resolution, with the state imposed crackdown against the indigenous population accelerating in recent years.\n\nLa Badil (No Other Choice), was filmed undercover in Western Sahara on the eve of the second anniversary of the 2010 uprisings that marked the start of the Arab Spring. Over 15,000 indigenous Sahrawis had formed a peaceful protest camp in the desert resisting Moroccan rule, but it failed to draw international media attention. When the camp was eventually broken up by Moroccan security forces, four civilians and eleven police officers were killed. Since then, Moroccan authorities have undertaken an intense campaign to quell rising independence sentiment and silence those that dare to speak out."
