La Badil (No Other Choice), was filmed undercover in the Moroccan controlled territories of Western Sahara, on the eve of the second anniversary of the 2010 uprisings at Gdeim Izik.

It sheds new light on the decades long conflict and the indigenous Sahrawi peoples struggle for self-determination.

Produced, directed & filmed by Dominic Brown (@zevion)
