A programme of development work has established a technique for inert gas cutting with the reliable, commercially available Ferranti MF 400 laser and equipment for laser cutting of sub-assemblies has been installed in the Irradiated Fuel Cave at P.F.R. Test cuts carried out with this equipment on un-irradiated wrapper sections have shown it to be easy to operate remotely, optically stable and reliable in operation.

The sector sub-assembly tools descried in this paper are main assembly tools to assemble vacuum vessel, thermal shield and toroidal filed coils into a complete 40 o sector. The 40 o sector sub-assembly tools are composed of sector sub-assembly tool, including radial beam, vacuum vessel supports and mid-plane brace tools. These tools shall have sufficient strength to transport and handle heavy weight of the ITER Tokamak machine reached several hundred tons. Therefore these tools should be designed and analyzed to confirm both the strength and structural stability even in the case of conservative assumptions. To verify structural stabilities of the sector sub-assembly tools in terms of strength and deflection, ANSYS code was used for linear static analysis. The results of the analysis show that these tools are designed with sufficient strength and stiffness. The conceptual designs of these tools are briefly described in this paper also.\n\nPreparation and near-infrared absorption of nano-SnO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} assemblies with doping and without doping\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHai Shujie [Faculty of Material Science and Chemical Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Lu Mo Road 388, Wuhan 430074 (China); Yan Chunjie, E-mail: chjyan2005@126.co [Engineering Research Center of Nano-Geomaterials, Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences, Lu Mo Road 388, Wuhan 430074 (China); Yu Hongjie; Xiao Guoqi; Wang Duo [Faculty of Material Science and Chemical Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Lu Mo Road 388, Wuhan 430074 (China)\n\n2009-11-20\n\nThe assemblies of nano-SnO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} and Sb- or Pd-doped nano-SnO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2}, in which the nano-SnO{sub 2} particles are located in the pores of mesoporous SiO{sub 2} dry gels, were synthesized. Only for the Sb-doped nano-SnO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} assemblies, a broad near-infrared absorption step occurs in the optical absorption spectrum of the wavelength range from 300 to 1500 nm. The near-infrared absorption phenomenon is attributed to electronic transitions from the ground states to the excitation states of the impurity energy levels, which are formed by Sb doping in SnO{sub 2}. With increasing the weight ratio of SnO{sub 2}:SiO{sub 2} or the annealing temperature, the near-infrared absorption step slope side exhibits 'red shift', which is caused by the quantum confinement effect weakening due to the increased SnO{sub 2} crystalline diameter.\n\nSub-assembly accident protection instrumentation systems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVaughan, G.J.; Lunt, A.R.W.; Evans, N.J.; Lawrence, L.A.J.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe possibility of an incident in a sub-assembly progressing to the stage at which the whole core may be at hazard has to be guarded against. It is proposed that for CDFR specific instrumentation will be provided to protect against this incident. Three such systems are described, these are: Acoustic Boiling Noise Detection, Burst Pin Detection and Individual Sub-Assembly Thermocouple (ISAT) monitoring. In the ISAT case, multiplexers and microprocessors are employed, using novel techniques to ensure failure-to-safety. The role of these systems and the implementation of them in the reactor design are also considered. It is concluded that sufficient protection can be provided for both core and breeder sub-assemblies\n\nOptics assembly for high power laser tools\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFraze, Jason D.; Faircloth, Brian O.; Zediker, Mark S.\n\n2016-06-07\n\nThere is provided a high power laser rotational optical assembly for use with, or in high power laser tools for performing high power laser operations.

The triangles were grown by a thermal evaporation-deposition process with pure antimony powders as precursor, and present a self assembled arrangement covering extended areas of the samples. CL spectra of the triangles show bands at 2-2.5 and 3.1 eV, the latter is not observed in the Sb{sub 2}O{sub 3} initial powder. PL excited by 325 nm laser shows a band at 2.4 eV with a shoulder at 2.75 eV, as well as resonance modes suggesting optical cavity behavior of the triangles. The separation between resonant peaks from different triangles has been correlated with the triangle side length and possible optical paths were obtained according to the Fabry-Perot relationship. These results along with the optical images suggest that not only Fabry-Perot cavity modes, but also whispering gallery modes may occur inside the micro- and nanotriangle structures.\n\nStatus of Conceptual Design Progress for ITER Sector Sub-assembly Tools\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNam, Kyoung O; Park, Hyun Ki; Kim, Dong Jin [National Fusion Research Institute, Daejeon (Korea, Republic of); Lee, Jae Hyuk; Kim, Kyung Kyu [SFA Engineering Corp., Changwon (Korea, Republic of); Im, Ki Hak; Robert, Shaw [ITER Organization, Paul lez Durance (France)\n\n2010-05-15\n\nThe ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) Tokamak assembly tools are purpose-built tools to complete the ITER Tokamak machine which includes the cryostat and the components contained therein. Based on the design description document prepared by the ITER organization, Korea has carried out the conceptual design of assembly tools. The 40 .deg. sector assemblies sub-assembled at assembly hall are transferred to Tokamak hall using the lifting tool operated by Tokamak main cranes. In-pit assembly tools are the purpose-built assembly tools for the completion of final sector assembly at Tokamak hall. The 40 .deg. sector sub-assembly tools are composed of the upending tool, the sector sub-assembly tool, the sector lifting tool and the vacuum vessel support and bracing tools. The process of the ITER sector sub-assembly at assembly hall and status of research and development are described in this paper. The ITER Tokamak device is composed of 9 vacuum vessel (VV)/toroidal field coils (TFCs)/vacuum vessel thermal shields (VVTS) 40 .deg. sectors. Each VV/TFCs/VVTS 40 .deg. sector is made up of one 40 .deg. VV, two 20 .deg. TFCs and associated VVTS segments. The 40 .deg. sectors are sub-assembled at assembly hall respectively and then 9 sectors which sub-assembled at assembly hall are finally assembled at Tokamak hall. As a basic assembly component, the assembly strategy and tools for the 40 .deg. sector sub-assembly and final assembly at inpit should be developed to satisfy the basic assembly requirements of the ITER Tokamak device. Accordingly, the purpose-built assembly tools should be designed and manufactured considering assembly plan, available space, safety, easy operation, efficient maintenance, and so on. The 40 .deg. sector assembly tools are classified into 2 groups. One group is the sub-assembly tools including upending tool, lifting tool, sub-assembly tool, VV supports and bracing tools used at assembly hall and the other group is the in\n\nAn optimized routing algorithm for the automated assembly of standard multimode ribbon fibers in a full-mesh optical backplane\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBasile, Vito; Guadagno, Gianluca; Ferrario, Maddalena; Fassi, Irene\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this paper a parametric, modular and scalable algorithm allowing a fully automated assembly of a backplane fiber-optic interconnection circuit is presented. This approach guarantees the optimization of the optical fiber routing inside the backplane with respect to specific criteria (i.e. bending power losses), addressing both transmission performance and overall costs issues. Graph theory has been exploited to simplify the complexity of the NxN full-mesh backplane interconnection topology, firstly, into N independent sub-circuits and then, recursively, into a limited number of loops easier to be generated. Afterwards, the proposed algorithm selects a set of geometrical and architectural parameters whose optimization allows to identify the optimal fiber optic routing for each sub-circuit of the backplane. The topological and numerical information provided by the algorithm are then exploited to control a robot which performs the automated assembly of the backplane sub-circuits. The proposed routing algorithm can be extended to any array architecture and number of connections thanks to its modularity and scalability. Finally, the algorithm has been exploited for the automated assembly of an 8x8 optical backplane realized with standard multimode (MM) 12-fiber ribbons.\n\nAssembly, alignment and test of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) optical assemblies\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBalonek, Gregory; Brown, Joshua J.; Andre, James E.; Chesbrough, Christian D.; Chrisp, Michael P.; Dalpiaz, Michael; Lennon, Joseph; Richards, B. C.; Clark, Kristin E.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will carry four visible waveband, seven-element, refractive F/1.4 lenses, each with a 34 degree diagonal field of view. This paper describes the methods used for the assembly, alignment and test of the four flight optical assemblies. Prior to commencing the build of the four flight optical assemblies, a Risk Reduction Unit (RRU) was successfully assembled and tested [1]. The lessons learned from the RRU were applied to the build of the flight assemblies. The main modifications to the flight assemblies include the inking of the third lens element stray light mitigation, tighter alignment tolerances, and diamond turning for critical mechanical surfaces. Each of the optical assemblies was tested interferometrically and measured with a low coherence distance measuring interferometer (DMI) to predict the optimal shim thickness between the lens assembly and detector before -75Â°C environmental testing. In addition to individual test data, environmental test results from prior assemblies allow for the exploration of marginal performance differences between each of the optical assemblies.\n\nToward high throughput optical metamaterial assemblies.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFontana, Jake; Ratna, Banahalli R\n\n2015-11-01\n\nOptical metamaterials have unique engineered optical properties. These properties arise from the careful organization of plasmonic elements. Transitioning these properties from laboratory experiments to functional materials may lead to disruptive technologies for controlling light. A significant issue impeding the realization of optical metamaterial devices is the need for robust and efficient assembly strategies to govern the order of the nanometer-sized elements while enabling macroscopic throughput. This mini-review critically highlights recent approaches and challenges in creating these artificial materials. As the ability to assemble optical metamaterials improves, new unforeseen opportunities may arise for revolutionary optical devices.\n\nFuel sub-assembly\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJolly, R.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nA fuel sub-assembly for a liquid metal cooled nuclear reactor is described in which the bundle of fuel pins are braced apart by a series of spaced grids.

With the rapid growth of ozone holes over the earth, the exploration of optical materials that can cut off harmful UV radiation is important. In this work, fusiform TiO{sub 2} nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal synthesis method. The thin films assembled with TiO{sub 2} nanoparticles and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes were fabricated via a layer-by-layer assembly method. The fabrication of poly(ethylene imine) (PEI)/TiO{sub 2} multilayer films was verified by ultravioletâvisible spectra measurements, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The as-prepared PEI/TiO{sub 2} multilayer films can effectively absorb harmful UVB light and filter off visible light. Most importantly, the PEI/TiO{sub 2} films can be deposited directly on various kinds of hydrophilic substrates such as quartz, glass, silicon and hydrophobic substrates such as polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene and polymethyl methacrylate when the hydrophilic substrates were modified to obtain a hydrophilic surface. - Highlights: â¢ PEI/TiO{sub 2} films were fabricated via a layer-by-layer self-assembly method. â¢ The films could effectively absorb harmful UVB light and filter off visible light. â¢ The films could deposit directly on either hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates.\n\nControlling material birefringence in sapphire via self-assembled, sub-wavelength defects\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSingh, Astha; Sharma, Geeta; Ranjan, Neeraj; Mittholiya, Kshitij; Bhatnagar, Anuj; Singh, B. P.; Mathur, Deepak; Vasa, Parinda\n\n2018-02-01\n\nBirefringence is the optical property of a material having a refractive index that depends on the polarization and propagation direction of light. Generally, this is an intrinsic optical property of a material and cannot be altered. Here, we report a novel techniqueâdirect laser writingâthat enables us to control the natural, material birefringence of sapphire over a broad range of wavelengths. The broadband form birefringence originating from self-assembled, periodic array of sub-wavelength (Ë 50-200 nm) defects created by laser writing, can enhance, suppress or maintain the material birefringence of sapphire without affecting its transparency range in visible or its surface quality.\n\nAutomated optical assembly\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBala, John L.\n\n1995-08-01\n\nAutomation and polymer science represent fundamental new technologies which can be directed toward realizing the goal of establishing a domestic, world-class, commercial optics business. Use of innovative optical designs using precision polymer optics will enable the US to play a vital role in the next generation of commercial optical products. The increased cost savings inherent in the utilization of optical-grade polymers outweighs almost every advantage of using glass for high volume situations. Optical designers must gain experience with combined refractive/diffractive designs and broaden their knowledge base regarding polymer technology beyond a cursory intellectual exercise. Implementation of a fully automated assembly system, combined with utilization of polymer optics, constitutes the type of integrated manufacturing process which will enable the US to successfully compete with the low-cost labor employed in the Far East, as well as to produce an equivalent product.\n\nThe Self-Assembly of Nanogold for Optical Metamaterials\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNidetz, Robert A.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nOptical metamaterials are an emerging field that enables manipulation of light like never before. Producing optical metamaterials requires sub-wavelength building blocks. The focus here was to develop methods to produce building blocks for metamaterials from nanogold. Electron-beam lithography was used to define an aminosilane patterned chemical template in order to electrostatically self-assemble citrate-capped gold nanoparticles. Equilibrium self-assembly was achieved in 20 minutes by immersing chemical templates into gold nanoparticle solutions. The number of nanoparticles that self-assembled on an aminosilane dot was controlled by manipulating the diameters of the dots and nanoparticles. Adding salt to the nanoparticle solution enabled the nanoparticles to self-assemble in greater numbers on the same sized dot. However, the preparation of the nanoparticle solution containing salt was sensitive to spikes in the salt concentration which led to aggregation of the nanoparticles and non-specific deposition. Gold nanorods were also electrostatically self-assembled. Polyelectrolyte-coated gold nanorods were patterned with limited success. A polyelectrolyte chemical template also patterned gold nanorods, but the gold nanorods preferred to pattern on the edges of the pattern. Ligand-exchanged gold nanorods displayed the best self-assembly, but suffered from slow kinetics. Self-assembled gold nanoparticles were cross-linked with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride). The poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) allowed additional nanoparticles to pattern on top of the already patterned nanoparticles. Cross-linked nanoparticles were lifted-off of the substrate by sonication in a sodium hydroxide solution. The presence of van der Waals forces and/or amine bonding prevent the nanogold from lifting-off without sonication. A good-solvent evaporation process was used to self-assemble poly(styrene) coated gold nanoparticles into spherical microbead assemblies. The use of larger\n\nNuclear reactor fuel sub-assemblies\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFord, J.; Bishop, J.F.W.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nAn improved fuel sub-assembly for liquid metal cooled fast breeder nuclear reactors is described which facilitates dismantling operations for reprocessing purposes.

Our approach aims at supporting micro-optics experts to effectively develop assisted or fully automated assembly solutions without detailed prior experience in programming while at the same time enabling them to easily implement their own libraries of expert schemes and algorithms for handling optical components. Virtual commissioning is enabled by a 3D simulation and visualization system in which the functionalities and properties of automated systems are modeled, simulated and controlled based on multi-agent systems. For process development, our approach supports event-, state- and time-based visual programming techniques for the agents and allows for their kinematic motion simulation in combination with looped-in simulation results for the optical components. First results have been achieved for simply switching the agents to command the real hardware setup after successful process implementation and validation in the virtual environment. We evaluated and adapted our system to meet the requirements set by industrial partners-- laser manufacturers as well as hardware suppliers of assembly platforms. The concept is applied to the automated assembly of optical components for optically pumped semiconductor lasers and positioning of optical components for beam-shaping\n\nOptical Filter Assembly for Interplanetary Optical Communications\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Yijiang; Hemmati, Hamid\n\n2013-01-01\n\nGround-based, narrow-band, high throughput optical filters are required for optical links from deep space.

In order to meet diffraction limited imaging performance over wide spectral bands across the UV and visible wavebands, new manufacturing approaches and tools must be developed if the optical systems will be produced consistently in volume production. This is especially applicable in the field of precision microscope objectives for life science, semiconductor inspection and laser material processing systems. We observe a rising need for the improvement in the optical imaging performance of objective lenses. The key challenge lies in the micron-level decentration and tilt of each lens element. One solution for the production of high quality lens systems is sub-cell assembly with alignment turning. This process relies on an automatic alignment chuck to align the optical axis of a mounted lens to the spindle axis of the machine. Subsequently, the mount is cut with diamond tools on a lathe with respect to the optical axis of the mount. Software controlled integrated measurement technology ensures highest precision. In addition to traditional production processes, further dimensions can be controlled in a very precise manner, e.g. the air gaps between the lenses. Using alignment turning simplifies further alignment steps and reduces the risk of errors. This paper describes new challenges in microscope objective design and manufacturing, and addresses difficulties with standard production processes. A new measurement and alignment technique is described, and strengths and limitations are outlined.\n\nPhysics analyses of an accelerator-driven sub-critical assembly\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNaberezhnev, Dmitry G.; Gohar, Yousry; Bailey, James; Belch, Henry\n\n2006-06-01\n\nPhysics analyses have been performed for an accelerator-driven sub-critical assembly as a part of the Argonne National Laboratory activity in preparation for a joint conceptual design with the Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology (KIPT) of Ukraine. KIPT has a plan to construct an accelerator-driven sub-critical assembly targeted towards the medical isotope production and the support of the Ukraine nuclear industry. The external neutron source is produced either through photonuclear reactions in tungsten or uranium targets, or deuteron reactions in a beryllium target. KIPT intends using the high-enriched uranium (HEU) for the fuel of the sub-critical assembly. The main objective of this paper is to study the possibility of utilizing low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel instead of HEU fuel without penalizing the sub-critical assembly performance, in particular the neutron flux level. In the course of this activity, several studies have been carried out to investigate the main choices for the system's parameters. The external neutron source has been characterized and a pre-conceptual target design has been developed. Several sub-critical configurations with different fuel enrichments and densities have been considered. Based on our analysis, it was shown that the performance of the LEU fuel is comparable with that of the HEU fuel. The LEU fuel sub-critical assembly with 200-MeV electron energy and 100-kW electron beam power has an average total flux of Ë2.50Ã10 13 n/s cm 2 in the irradiation channels. The corresponding total facility power is Ë204 kW divided into 91 and 113 kW deposited in the target and sub-critical assemblies, respectively.\n\nTunable optical assembly with vibration dampening\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAllison, Sidney G.

DNA tiles have been directly constructed from ssDNA and readily self-assembled into 2D lattices and 3D superstructures. However, for more complex lattice designs including algorithmic assemblies requiring larger tile sets, a more modular approach could prove useful. This paper reports a new DNA 'sub-tile' strategy to easily create whole families of programmable tiles. Here, we demonstrate the stability and flexibility of our sub-tile structures by constructing 3-, 4- and 6-arm DNA tiles that are subsequently assembled into 2D lattices and 3D nanotubes according to a hierarchical design. Assembly of sub-tiles, tiles, and superstructures was analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy. DNA tile self-assembly methods provide a bottom-up approach to create desired nanostructures; the sub-tile strategy adds a useful new layer to this technique.

Assembly technologies for beam-shaping subassemblies are subject to intense research and development activities and their technical feasibility has been proven in recent years while economic viability requires more efficient engineering tools for process planning and production ramp up of complex assembly tasks for micro-optical systems. The work presented in this paper aims for significant reduction of process development and production ramp up times for the automated assembly of micro-optical subassemblies for beam-collimation and beam-tilting. The approach proposed bridges the gap between the product development phase and the realization of automation control through integration of established software tools such as optics simulation and CAD modeling as well as through introduction of novel software tools and methods to efficiently describe active alignment strategies. The focus of the paper is put on the methodological approach regarding the engineering of assembly processes for beam-shaping micro-optics and the formal representation of assembly objectives similar to representation in mechanical assemblies. Main topic of the paper is the engineering methodology for active alignment processes based on the classification of optical functions for beam-shaping optics and corresponding standardized measurement setups including adaptable alignment algorithms. The concepts are applied to industrial use-cases: (1) integrated collimation module for fast- and slow-axis and (2) beam-tilting subassembly consisting of a fast-axis collimator and micro-lens array. The paper concludes with an overview of current limitations as well as an outlook on the next development steps considering adhesive bonding processes.\n\nProgrammable DNA tile self-assembly using a hierarchical sub-tile strategy\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShi, Xiaolong; Lu, Wei; Wang, Zhiyu; Pan, Linqiang; Cui, Guangzhao; Xu, Jin; LaBean, Thomas H\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDNA tile based self-assembly provides a bottom-up approach to construct desired nanostructures.

However due to the shutdown of many university research reactors , student laboratories must rely more heavily on use of sub-critical assemblies. Here a driven sub-critical is described that uses a cylindrical Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) device to provide a fusion neutron source. The small IEC neutron source would be inserted in a fuel element position, with its power input controlled externally at a control panel. This feature opens the way to use of the critical assembly for a number of transient experiments such as sub-critical pulsing and neutron wave propagation. That in turn adds important new insights and excitement for the student teaching laboratory\n\nNuclear fuel sub-assemblies\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDodd, J.A.; Butterfield, C.E.; Waite, E.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nA fast reactor fuel sub-assembly has honeycomb grids for laterally supporting the fuel pins.

Joe; Ott, Melanie N.; Chuska, Richard; Switzer, Robert; Onuma, Eleanya; Blair, Diana; Frese, Erich; Matyseck, Marc\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFiber optic assemblies have been used on spaceflight missions for many years as an enabling technology for routing, transmitting, and detecting optical signals. Due to the overwhelming success of NASA in implementing fiber optic assemblies on spaceflight science-based instruments, system scientists increasingly request fibers that perform in extreme environments while still maintaining very high optical transmission, stability, and reliability. Many new applications require fiber optic assemblies that will operate down to cryogenic temperatures as low as 20 Kelvin. In order for the fiber assemblies to operate with little loss in optical throughput at these extreme temperatures requires a system level approach all the way from how the fiber assembly is manufactured to how it is held, routed, and integrated. The NASA Goddard Code 562 Photonics Group has been designing, manufacturing, testing, and integrating fiber optics for spaceflight and other high reliability applications for nearly 20 years. Design techniques and lessons learned over the years are consistently applied to developing new fiber optic assemblies that meet these demanding environments. System level trades, fiber assembly design methods, manufacturing, testing, and integration will be discussed. Specific recent examples of ground support equipment for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST); the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2); and others will be included.\n\nOptical properties of the Na{sub 2}O-B{sub 2}O{sub 3}-Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3}-MoO{sub 3} glasses\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSaddeek, Yasser B.

It comprises a bundle of fuel pins enclosed by a tubular wrapper having a lower end journal for plugging into an upper aperture in a core supporting structure and a spike bar with an articulated bush for engaging a lower aperture in the core supporting structure. The articulated bush is retained on a spherical end portion of the spike bar by a pair of parallel retaining pins arranged transversely and disposed one each side of the spike bar. The pins are tubular and collapsible at a predetermined loading to enable the spherical end portion to pass between them. The articulated bush has an internal groove for engagement by a lifting grab, this groove being formed in a bore for receiving the spherical end portion of the spike bar. The construction lessens liability to rattling of the fuel element sub-assemblies and aids removal for replacement.

WO{sub 3} thin films (80ânm to 200ânm) have been deposited onto gold (Au) coated glass prism by sputtering technique. The structural, optical properties and surface morphology of the deposited WO{sub 3} thin films were studied using X-ray diffraction, UV-visible spectrophotometer, Raman spectroscopy, and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD analysis shows that all the deposited WO{sub 3} thin films are exhibiting preferred (020) orientation and Raman data indicates that the films possess single phase monoclinic structure. SEM images reveal the variation in grain size with increase in thickness. The SPR reflectance curves of the WO{sub 3}/Au/prism structure were utilized to estimate the dielectric properties of WO{sub 3} thin films at optical frequency (Î»â=â633 nm). As the thickness of WO{sub 3} thin film increases from 80ânm to 200ânm, the dielectric constant is seen to be decreasing from 5.76 to 3.42, while the dielectric loss reduces from 0.098 to 0.01. The estimated value of refractive index of WO{sub 3} film is in agreement to that obtained from UV-visible spectroscopy studies.

The surface plasmon modes in prism/Au/BiFeO{sub 3}/air structure have been excited in Kretschmann configuration at the interface of Au/BiFeO{sub 3} thin films.

SPR curves shows a continuous shift towards lower angles with increasing applied magnetic field, which indicate the promising application of ferromagnetic BiFeO{sub 3} film as a magnetic field sensor. Complex dielectric constant of deposited BiFeO{sub 3} film was determined by fitting the experimental SPR data with Fresnel's equations. The variation of complex dielectric constant and refractive index of BiFeO{sub 3} film was studied with increase in magnetic field, and the sensitivity of magnetic field sensor was found to be about 0.52 RIU/T.\n\nPhotoluminescence and optical absorption spectra of {gamma}{sub 1}-(Ga{sub x}In{sub 1-x}){sub 2}Se{sub 3} mixed crystals\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKranjcec, M.

The thin layers were deposited by thermal co-evaporation of As{sub 2}S{sub 3} and In{sub 2}S{sub 3}. The composition of the coatings was controlled by x-ray microanalysis; it was found to be close to the expected one. The refractive index n and optical band gap E{sub g}{sup opt} were calculated from the transmittance and reflectance spectra. The results showed that the refractive index of thin As-S films is not affected by the addition of 1 at% indium and it increases from 2.46 to 2.58 for thin film with 13 at% In. A decrease in the changes in the refractive index, {Delta}n, after exposure to light or annealing with addition of indium in arsenic sulfide is observed. To explain the influence of the indium on the photoinduced changes in the optical properties of thin As-S-In films, the glass structure was investigated by infrared spectroscopy.

A 3-DOF attitude measuring method using linear variable differential transformers (LVDT is designed to adjust the relation of position and attitude between the spherical mirror and the resonator. A micro vision feedback system is set up to extract the light beam and the diaphragm, which can achieve the coarse positioning of the spherical mirror in the optical assembly process. A rapid self-correlation method is presented to analyze the spectrum signal for the fine positioning. In order to prevent the damage of the optical components and realize sealing of the resonator, a hybrid force-position control is constructed to control the contact force of the optical components. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-sensor control strategy succeeds in accomplishing the precise assembly of the optical components, which consists of parallel adjustment, macro coarse adjustment, macro approach, micro fine adjustment, micro approach and optical contact. Therefore, the results validate the multi-sensor control strategy.\n\nSingle crystalline Co{sub 3}O{sub 4}: Synthesis and optical properties\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHosny, Nasser Mohammed, E-mail: Nasserh56@yahoo.com\n\n2014-04-01\n\nCrystals of Co{sub 3}O{sub 4} have been prepared from thermal decomposition of molecular precursors derived from salicylic acid and cobalt (II) acetate or chloride at 500Â Â°C.

The novel sensor system was for the first time demonstrated deployed in a deep well, detecting multiple CO<sub>2sub> releases, in real time, at varying depths. Early CO<sub>2sub> release detection, by means of a sensor cable integrating multiple sensor segments, was demonstrated, as was the capability of quantifying the leak. The novel fiber optic sensor system exhibits capabilities not achieved by any other monitoring technology. This project represents a breakthrough in monitoring capabilities for CCS applications.\n\nElectrostatic interactions for directed assembly of high performance nanostructured energetic materials of Al/Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nZhang, Tianfu; Ma, Zhuang; Li, Guoping; Wang, Zhen; Zhao, Benbo; Luo, Yunjun, E-mail: yjluo@bit.edu.cn\n\n2016-05-15\n\nElectrostatic self-assembly in organic solvent without intensively oxidative or corrosive environments, was adopted to prepare Al/Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}/MWCNT nanostructured energetic materials as an energy generating material. The negatively charged MWCNT was used as a glue-like agent to direct the self-assembly of the well dispersed positively charged Al (fuel) and Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} (oxide) nanoparticles. This spontaneous assembly method without any surfactant chemistry or other chemical and biological moieties decreased the aggregation of the same nanoparticles largely, moreover, the poor interfacial contact between the Al (fuel) and Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} (oxide) nanoparticles was improved significantly, which was the key characteristic of high performance nanostructured energetic materials. In addition, the assembly process was confirmed as Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. The assembled Al/Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}/MWCNT nanostructured energetic materials showed excellent performance with heat release of 2400 J/g, peak pressure of 0.42 MPa and pressurization rate of 105.71 MPa/s, superior to that in the control group Al/Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} nanostructured energetic materials prepared by sonication with heat release of 1326 J/g, peak pressure of 0.19 MPa and pressurization rate of 33.33 MPa/s. Therefore, the approach, which is facile, opens a promising route to the high performance nanostructured energetic materials. - Graphical abstract: The negatively charged MWCNT was used as a glue-like agent to direct the self-assembly of the well dispersed positively charged Al (fuel) and Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} (oxide) nanoparticles. - Highlights: â¢ A facile spontaneous electrostatic assembly strategy without surfactant was adopted. â¢ The fuels and oxidizers assembled into densely packed nanostructured composites. â¢ The assembled nanostructured energetic materials have excellent performance. â¢ This high performance energetic material can be scaled up for practical application. â¢ This\n\nChemically deposited Sb{sub 2}S{sub 3} thin films for optical recording\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nShaji, S; Arato, A; Castillo, G Alan; Palma, M I Mendivil; Roy, T K Das; Krishnan, B [Facultad de IngenierIa Mecanica y Electrica, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, San Nicolas de los Garza, Nuevo Leon, C.P- 66450 (Mexico); O' Brien, J J; Liu, J, E-mail: bkrishnan@fime.uanl.m [Center for Nanoscience and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Missouri-St. Louis, One Univ.

The nonlinear optical measurements show the films possess the same self-defocusing behavior but with different values of nonlinear refraction, and changed signs of nonlinear absorption. The difference of optical nonlinearity in CaCu{sub 3}Ti{sub 4}O{sub 12} films is ascribed to different lattice parameters and intermediate levels induced by structure.\n\nDesain Sistem Pendeteksi untuk Citra Base Sub-assembly dengan Algoritma Backpropagation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKasdianto Kasdianto\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Object identification technique using machine vision has been implemented in industrial of electronic manufacturers for years.

The development of methods for fabrication of these bacteria-based robots is a first crucial step towards the realization of functional miniature and autonomous moving robots. We present a novel scheme based on optical trapping to fabricate living micro-robots. By using holographic optical tweezers that allow three-dimensional manipulation in real time, we are able to arrange the building blocks that constitute the micro-robot in a defined way. We demonstrate exemplarily that our method enables the controlled assembly of living micro-robots consisting of a rod-shaped prokaryotic bacterium and a single elongated zeolite L crystal, which are used as model of the biological and abiotic components, respectively. We present different proof-of-principle approaches for the site-selective attachment of the bacteria on the particle surface.

This study proposes the growth mechanism of porous NiCo{sub 2}S{sub 4} composited with halloysite (HL) via a self-assembly method using halloysite as a template and component. Electrochemical tests showed that the NiCo{sub 2}S{sub 4}-HL exhibited an ultrahigh specific capacitance (Csp) (589C g{sup â1} at 1A g{sup â1}) and good cycle stability (Csp retention of 86% after 1000 cycles). The desirable capacitive performance of the NiCo{sub 2}S{sub 4}-HL can be attributed to the large specific surface area and short diffusion path for electrons and ions in the hierarchical porous structure. The superior electrochemical performances with the energy density of 35.48 W h kg{sup â1} at a power density of 199.9 W kg{sup â1} were achieved in an assembled aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device using NiCo{sub 2}S{sub 4}-HL as a positive electrode and N-doped graphene (NG) as a negative electrode. Moreover, the NiCo{sub 2}S{sub 4}-HL//NG asymmetric supercapacitor achieved outstanding cycle stability (also retained 83.2% after 1700 cycles). The high-performance of the ASC device will undoubtedly make the porous NiCo{sub 2}S{sub 4}-HL as potential electrode materials attractive in energy storage systems.\n\nMeasurement and correlation of optical and TEM twins in Y/sub 1/Ba/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7-Î´/\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChumbley, L.S.; Verhoeven, J.D.; Kim, M.R.; Cornelius, A.L.; Kramer, M.J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe spacing of the twins present in Y/sub 1/Ba/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7-Î´/ has been investigated using optical and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Studies have reported that the value of the average twin spacing obtained by optical measurements is much larger than that measured in thin foils prepared for TEM observation, and controversy exists as to the exact nature of the optical twins. Experiments have been conducted which show that the twins observed optically correspond to those seen using TEM and are not produced by an optical interference effect. Using electron channeling, equations have been formulated which allow optical determination of the true spacing of twins present in a selected grain as well as the orientation of that grain. The average twin spacing measured in TEM has been found to vary with sample preparation method, being smaller for crushed chip samples than for bulk samples prepared by ion milling or jet-polishing. A variation of the twin spacing with grain size has also been noted\n\nSelf-assembled NiFe{sub 2}O{sub 4}/carbon nanotubes sponge for enhanced glucose biosensing application\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLi, Yingchun; Zhao, Minggang, E-mail: zhaomg@ouc.edu.cn; Chen, Jing; Fan, Sisi; Liang, Jingjing; Ding, Longjiang; Chen, Shougang, E-mail: sgchen@ouc.edu.cn\n\n2016-01-30\n\nGraphical abstract: - Highlights: â¢ Self-assembled NiFe{sub 2}O{sub 4}/CNTs sponge was prepared by ice-templating method. â¢ The mechanism of NiFe{sub 2}O{sub 4} modified CNTs relied on Ï-Ï interactions and static cling. â¢ The porous structure made for GO{sub x} load, electrons transport and reactants diffusion. â¢ Double catalysis and enhanced glucose sensing were achieved with elements Ni and Fe. - Abstract: In this work, self-assembled NiFe{sub 2}O{sub 4}/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) sponge was prepared by ice-templating method.

Over the course of the project we have made significant progress in photonically driven nano-assembly including: (1) demonstrating the first direct optical tweezer based manipulation of proteins, (2) the ability to apply optical angular torques to microtubuals and other rod-shaped microparticles, (3) direct assembly of hybrid nanostructures comprising of polymeric nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes and, (4) the ability to drive biological reactions (specifically protein aggregation) that are thermodynamically unfavorable by applying localized optical work. These advancements are described in the list of papers provided in section 2.0 of the below. Summary details are provided in prior year annual reports. We have two additional papers which will be submitted shortly based on the work done under this award. An updated publication list will be provided to the program manager when those are accepted. In this report, we report on a new advancement made in the final project year, which uses the nanotweezer technology to perform direct measurements of particle-surface interactions. Briefly, these measurements are important for characterizing the stability and behavior of colloidal and nanoparticle suspensions and current techniques are limited in their ability to measure piconewton scale interaction forces on sub-micrometer particles due to signal detection limits and thermal noise. In this project year we developed a new technique called âNanophotonic Force Microscopyâ which uses the localized region of exponentially decaying, near-field, light to confine small particles close to a surface. From the statistical distribution of the light intensity scattered by the particle the technique maps out the potential well of the trap and directly quantify the repulsive force between the nanoparticle and the surface. The major advantage of the technique is that it can measure forces and energy wells below the thermal noise\n\nStudy of structural and optical properties of Cd{sub 1-x}Zn{sub x}Se thin films\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWahab, L.A., E-mail: aly_lo2003@yahoo.com [National Center for Radiation Research and Technology, Nasr City, Cairo (Egypt); Zayed, H.A.

The low values of formation energies indicate both Y-doped Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} models can be easily synthesized. Besides, the negative formation energies of Î±-Y{sub i}-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} demonstrate that interstitial Y-doped Î±-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} has an excellent stability. The energies of impurity levels are different resulting from the different chemical environment around Y atoms.

The hybridized S4 sample prepared with 4 wt.% GO possesses the highest photocatalytic activity with a constant rate of 0.039 min{sup â1} in the photocataytic degradation of Brilliant X-3B dye (X3B); this sample was enhanced more than three times when compared with pure TiO{sub 2} sample (0.012 min{sup â1}). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the rGO@TiO{sub 2}-NR hybrid was attributed to the strong interaction between TiO{sub 2} nanorods and rGO. The unique hierarchical structure of 1D nanorod assembly TiO{sub 2}ârGO flakes facilitates the injection and transfer of photo-generated electrons from TiO{sub 2} to graphene, thus retarding the recombination of electronâhole pairs and enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The enlarged BET surface areas, not only increasing the number of active sites, but also facilitating the adsorption of\n\nNonlinear optical characteristics of monolayer MoSe{sub 2}\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLe, Chinh Tam; Ullah, Farman; Senthilkumar, Velusamy; Kim, Yong Soo [Department of Physics and Energy Harvest Storage Research Center, University of Ulsan (Korea, Republic of); Clark, Daniel J.; Jang, Joon I.

Two-step growth involving the selenization of pulsed-laser-deposited MoO{sub 3} film was employed to yield the MoSe{sub 2} monolayer on a SiO{sub 2}/Si substrate. Raman scattering, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy verified the high optical quality of the monolayer. The second-order susceptibility Ï{sup (2)} was calculated to be â50 pm V{sup -1} at the second harmonic wavelength Î»{sub SHG} â810 nm, which is near the optical gap of the monolayer. Interestingly, our wavelength-dependent second harmonic scan can identify the bound excitonic states including negatively charged excitons much more efficiently, compared with the PL method at room temperature. Additionally, the MoSe{sub 2} monolayer exhibits a strong laser-induced damage threshold â16 GW cm{sup -2} under picosecond-pulse excitation{sub .} Our findings suggest that monolayer MoSe{sub 2} can be considered as a promising candidate for high-power, thin-film-based nonlinear optical devices and applications.

ITRC applies the poker chip assembly technology to the high numerical aperture objective lenses and lithography projection lenses because of its high efficiency assembly process. In order to achieve high precision lens cell for poker chip assembly, an alignment turning system (ATS) is developed. The ATS includes measurement, alignment and turning modules. The measurement module is equipped with a non-contact displacement sensor (NCDS) and an autocollimator (ACM). The NCDS and ACM are used to measure centration errors of the top and the bottom surface of a lens respectively; then the amount of adjustment of displacement and tilt with respect to the rotational axis of the turning machine for the alignment module can be determined. After measurement, alignment and turning processes on the ATS, the centration error of a lens cell with 200 mm in diameter can be controlled within 10 arcsec. Furthermore, a poker chip assembly lens cell with three sub-cells is demonstrated, each sub-cells are measured and accomplished with alignment and turning processes. The lens assembly test for five times by each three technicians; the average transmission centration error of assembly lens is 12.45 arcsec. The results show that ATS can achieve high assembly efficiency for precision optical systems.\n\nElectronic, bonding, linear and non-linear optical properties of novel Li{sub 2}Ga{sub 2}GeS{sub 6} compound\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKhan, Wilayat, E-mail: wkhan@ntc.zcu.cz [New Technologies â Research Center, University of West Bohemia, Univerzitni 8, Pilsen 306 14 (Czech Republic); Murtaza, G., E-mail: murtaza@icp.edu.pk [Department of Physics, Islamia College Peshawar, KPK (Pakistan); Ouahrani, T.
