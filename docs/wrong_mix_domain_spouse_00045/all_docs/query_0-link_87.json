It is made up of many diverse elements that are only single, unfulfilled notes by themselves, but form a complete composition when put together. USL's campus is like the base line of a piece of music. It is the strong, solid foundation upon which the school's activities are based the way a chord structure is built upon the foundation of a base note. A college is built of students just as a musical composition is built of chords. But music is built ON a foundation of base notes, just as USL is built on the foundation of a great campus. Students are the melody of the university. When someone listens to a song, it is the melody they listen to to decide whether they like the song or not just as people base their opinion of a university on its students. All the elements of the college work together to strengthen and enrich the students just as the harmony and in- struments combine to enrich the melody of a song. The activities that the students and faculty of a university engage in are like the harmony in a piece of music. The activities enrich the students and make them more rounded as human be- ings. They provide the spice to liven up the lives of people who could become dull and bored if all they did was study. The harmony makes the melody something unique that is always alive and changing the way the active students of a university are. Q r The university's faculty is like the rhythm section in music. The rhythm section isn't what you first hear, nor is it the primary element you listen for, like the melody. But it gives the whole piece a tem- po and order to follow so that everybody isn't playing at their own speed and all you have is noise instead of music. © The administration of a college is like a conductor directing the performance of a composition. He doesn't contribute to the ac- tual music, but he pulls all the players and in- struments together into one coherent piece of music that works. It is not a work of art until the conductor puts it all together. The administration of a college pulls the faculty and students and activities and campus of the university together so that they all work together and not separately. This way everything runs well and things can be accomplished. Without the conductor, the instruments would make noise separately, not music together. One of the best examples of a comracrar^^wno cair^pmr^ma] elements together to work as a completed unit, is Dr. James R. Oliver. USL was lucky enough to have this man among its administration from 1954 through this past spring, when he retired to become the Vicar for Ad- ministration, Research and Finances for the Diocese of Lafayette. We will miss him and his inspiration very much. Dr. Oliver is a man who can not only pull elements together into one cohesive unit, but can also make them feel proud of their part in big picture. He is always ready to brighten someone's day with a word or a smile, and always has time to help people with their little problems. ' ■ - * But little problems are not all Dr. Oliver deals with. He is extremely active in the community, especially where non-profit organizations are concerned. There are few, if any, underprivileged groups in this area who have not received benefits through or from him in one way or another. *^ Dr. Oliver's many memberships, titles and honors are too many to list here. But those at USL include: Associate Professor of Chemistry, 1954-59; Professor of Chemistry, 1959-69; Director of the Computing Center, 1960-70 and 1972; Dean of the Graduate School, 1961-73; Professor of Computer Science, 1969-81; Assistant State Superintendent of Education for Manage- ment, Research and Finance, 1972-73; Executive Director of the State Board o^ Education, 1973; Dean of Academic and Financial Planning, 1973; and Vice President for Administrative Affairs, 1973-81. He was appointed Commis-.*^! sioner on the Education Commission of the States. He taught General and Physical Chemistry, Nuclear and Radiochemistry, and undergraduate and graduate courses in Computer Theory and Computer Programming at USL. He initiated B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. curricula in Computer Science at USL. He serves as Public Address Announcer at USL's football and basketball garries, and officiates at track meets, including the Southwestern Relays. ^ USL cannot help but suffer from the loss of such a man. But likewise, it cannot help but benefit from the years that he spent here. And we know that he is never far away if we need him, and his memory will help to inspire others to be the best that they can possibly be. % Thank you. Dr. Oliver, for the years you've spent with us. Your gifts to USL will never be forgotten, and we hope that your memories /f us will always live as fresh andj^eautiful in your mind as ouf memories 3ur jpijici as our m of you live in ours. ^^d^ And with that thought in mind, we would like to g^sent this gift to you: the dedication of the 19824'A(;adien| The University of Southwestern Louisiana is an experience in itself. The despair of missing a class because of some unfortunate mishap (rain, over sleeping or immobilazation of your car). There is difficulty in trying to make the adjustment away from home where you were secure and sheltered from life. There is also difficulty in trying to find a Biology course when you scheduled Math. What building is my class in? Where is my class? Questions, questions and more questions seem to haunt the minds of many many students on any university campus. But after youVe settled down and have reached the point of \"HELL I QUIT,\" then you find that you've discovered a walk-way that gleams brightly and leads to a pathway of hope. Uncertain of where you're about to travel after you have fought the turmoils of this new world, you tap it lightly and jump back and then stumble and turn around and find that someone behind you or in front of you has stumbled also. That person is struggling to get up but finds it hard and enduring, so you reach out your hand and you help your new friend to stand up. And you attempt that challenge of this crazy, wonderful, mixed up world together. Together or alone you go out into the realities of the world to participate in your birth of your new life. There is a beat, a sound that guides our lives and so you must follow the song that you hear singing in your own heart and I in mine. If our paths were meant to cross then we shall meet again. /<J01^H\\% ' jf^TCJS/iDHrJtfi^rJ College Press Servce 'THE CAAAPUS IS M/OP/I 5L/)AJP^ BUT T^E TUITION^ CWEAPf Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head Si.

I wanted ler walk to convey acidity. She ed, but something wasn't ght. So I said, \"Walk as though ou've got a nail in your shoe.' \" Such were the instructions of r. Ronald C. Kern, head of SL's theater program as he isted an actress rehearsing for he production of \"Kennedy's hildren.\" Kern, who has directed over 5 plays, recently spoke of some f the techniques and methods d for preparing a play as well the crucial relationship bet- een actor and director. A play's preparation, among other things, requires time. For \"Kennedy's Children,\" a par- ticularly difficult and complex work, the cast was selected in May so that those chosen would have the entire summer to work on their character and do research on the period. During the middle of the summer, performers were If (videotaped so that they could see what they were doing with their characters, voice and I movement. Daily rehearsals then began a week before school opened. Much rehearsal time is spent with the cast members working on expressing character and emotion by way of gesture and movement.

As much a confidant as a human potential coach, she is molding a career out of assisting those in the public limelight to maximize the value and potential of their innate talents. Lybrand has gained the respect of a variety of celebrities including authors, lawyers, politicians, public speakers and musical entertainers, as well as college students and cor- porate executives across the nation.'' Her ability to say it like it is so simply and yet so totally in her own \"Texas-Talkin' Way'' makes her a joy to see and hear. Because of Jayne Lybrand's diverse ability to reach out to so many areas and professions, she has become one of the most in-demand speakers in American col- leges, business and conventions today! \"Jayne Lybrand has the professionalism and speaking ability of Bar- bara Jordan, the wit and humor of Erma Bombeck and the information and refreshing quick-to-the-point solution of Dr. Joyce Brothers all wrapped up in a sensual package that's a cross between Phyllis George and a Texas-Talking Dolly Parton.' \" Her speech September 22, in USL Union was sponsored by the Fashion Committee, and admission was 50 cents for USL students with I.D. and $1 for the general Public. The Texas native showed 12 ways to prepare for a job interview, 13 ways to appear devious and how to get over a broken heart. Her presen- tation also covered 28 ways to tell someone's lying, 22 ways to in- timidate a person, 18 ways to look sincere and honest, and 10 ways to dress successfully. Lybrand owns her own imagemaking company. She earned a bachelor's degree in speech communication and English from Texas Christian's University, a master's degree in speech communication and guidance from TCU, and currently is completing a Ph. D. in college ad- ministration at North Texas State University. Michael Iceberg Dominating the USL LJnion Ballroom stage was a seven-foot tall copper pyramid, housing seven syn- thesizers, a drum computer and other mechanical devices. Seated at the keyboards of the massive music machine was Juilliard-trained Michael Iceberg. Man and machine were featured in a 90-minute concert of rock, classical and original works. Iceberg intersperses his concert with asides on the development of his machine from its inception as a slightly-out-of-the-ordinary organ. Musician Magazine dubs his in- strument the \"most sensational musical machine of the century.\" Comments Contemporary Keyboard Magazine, \"producing such complex arrangements live sounds like it ought to require eight arms and legs. Iceberg is a virtuoso performer, and he is clearly having fun and communicating it to his audience.\" Since 1976, Iceberg has performed at Walt Disney World's Tomor- rowland Terrace. For a few weeks each year he also performs for col- lege audiences. The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming! ly TANYA SAPORITO Actually, they have already arrived! A visiting Soviet scientist is here at USL conducting research in the College of ■ngineering. Sergei Kolbikov is an assistant professor at the Moscow Petroleum Institute in the Soviet Union, and he will be studying under Dr. Belunt A. Ovunc in the civil engineeri.ng department for the next eight months. Kolbikov obtained his education at the Moscow Petroleum Institute and received his \"Candidate of Science\" degree, which is .equivalent to an American master of science degree, in 1979. His thesis was devoted to \"math modeling processes for the development of oil and gas fields,\" as he put it, and the research he will be conducting here is designed to further his education n that area of engineering. Ovunc, together with several professors from the petroleum engineering department, will lead Kolbikov in his research. Dvunc explained the type of research they would be doing with Kolbikov in the coming year, and how the civil and petroleum mgineering departments will combine their efforts: \"We are trying to develop an assimilation technique for gas recovery,\" he ;aid. \"First we collect data about underground gas reservoirs through geological surveying and then figure out how to exploit heir reservoir economically.\" Ovunc clarified this by explaining that they find out where to place gas wells, how much gas to Irill and various economical exploration techniques. Kolbikov is the second Soviet scientist to conduct research at USL; last year Boris Kuzovlev, a professor at the Moscow Geophysical Institute, completed research on heavy drilling machinery through the department of petroleum engineering under the supervi- sion of Dr. A. Hayatdavoudi, chairman of the department. Both Kolbikov and Kuzovlev came to the United States through an independent, privately-funded organization called the International Research and Exchange Board IREX). It was established in 1968 and operates to provide research exchange oppor- tunities between the Socialist countries and the United States. Kolbikov offered some in- formation on the present exchange through IREX: \"There are presently 26 Soviet scien- tists studying in the U.S., and the same number of American scientists have been spon- sored by the Soviet Union to conduct research in various Soviet institutes and univer- sities,\" he said. According to Kolbikov, each scientist has his choice of v/hich American university he would like to complete his research at. IREX provides the candidates with a list of available universities and the professors under whom the scientists would work. Kolbikov said that he requested to be placed at either the University of California at Los Angeles or at USL, but the professor under whom he would have done his research at UCLA is on sabbatical for one year, so he came to USL. \"I know of USL in Moscow because of its engineering department and its publicity through IREX, and also because jiBoris Kuzovlev studied here last year,\" he said. ' Kolbikov hopes to complete his project in eight months. He is eager to begin his research and to become acquainted with USL and America, and also to learn as much as he can about Americans and American universities, he said. \"I am very happy to be in the United States and to be studying at USL,\" he commented. He added that he likes Lafayette and feels as though his research will progress well in the coming year. 0 Festivals Acadiens is a collection of several different festivals, shows and even a conference that each September turn the whole city of Lafayette into one big acclamation of traditional and contemporary Cajun culture. According to Festivals Acadiens General Chairman William V. Jacob, the community spirit that goes into the creation of this annual festival is what gives it its special sparkle. \"One of the most successful aspects of Festival Acadiens is the fact that the whole Lafayette civic community, in all its rich diversity, comes together each year to put on a show that is big enough to be called the festival of festivals,\" Jacob says. The Lafayette Jaycees join forces with the University of Southwestern Louisiana's Center for Louisiana Studies to produce the Festival de Musique Acadienne portion of Festivals Acadiens, probably the most comprehensive Cajun music festival anywhere. Scheduled Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 19-20, in Lafayette's Girard Park, this music festival is open to the public free of charge. This year's music line-up included all-time Cajun classics Octa Clark, Dennis McGee and Dewey Balfa; Zydeco musicians Boi-Sec Ardoin and John Delafose; contemporary Cajun stars Mike Doucet and Zachary Richard, and many, many more. The Lafayette Natural History Museum Association teams up with the city ad- ministration of Lafayette to organize the Louisiana Native Crafts Festival in connection with Festivals Acadiens. Traditional and modern-day crafts are well-represented on the museum's grounds. A selective screening process assures the visitor that this is one of the finest crafts festivals anywhere. The Louisiana State Museum's traveling Aca- dian textile exhibit was on display at the Lafayette Natural History Museum during this year's Festivals Acadiens. The Bayou Food Festival, a taste treat of foods from all of Lafayette's ethnic cultures, was sponsored by the Lafayette Con- vention and Visitors Commission. Located in the Lafayette Municipal Auditorium from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sept 19-20, this food extravaganza was popular with both natives and visitors alike. The Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) draws senior citizen craftspeople from all over Acadiana who display their hand-made wares at Girard Park, in the vicinity of the music festival. The Acadian Village, one of Lafayette's foremost tourist attractions, is the scene of much activity during the Festivals Acadiens weekend as well. An old-fashioned county fair, the only one like it in Acadiana, will award blue ribbons to the best in the follow- ing categories: quilting, needlework, home canning, pies, cakes, and others. The Loui- siana Folk Puppet Theater delighted children, and there were French plays and pirogue races as in previous years. The Art Center for Southwestern Louisiana presents a full range of cultural activities during this special weekend, too. There was an exhibit of Japanese prints, while music, dance and drama performances took place at 2 p.m., 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on both days. The Deep South Writers Conference, sponsored by the University of Southwestern Louisiana English Department, draws literary artists from throughout the South during the two days preceding and the two days of Festivals Acadiens. This year's conference featured personal appearances by Ernest J. Gaines, the author of \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman;\" noted poet and novelist Wendell Berry; and Joel Oppenheimer, whose play \"The Great American Desert,\" was produced at 8 p.m. each evening of the conference. The Lafayette Jaycees sponsor the Acadiana Fair and Trade Show which began on the Thursday prior to Festivals Acadiens and continued through Sunday. More than 100 in- door exhibits from just about every type of business group are displayed insidt Lafayette's Blackham Coliseum, while food booths and carnival rides were availabh outside. Despite the large scope of the Lafayette Festivals Acadiens, parking and traffic remain minor concerns, thanks to a free parking /shuttle bus system operated by the Lafayette Jaycees. Headquartered at USL's Cajun Field on Congress Street, the system dispatches regular buses to all components of the festival. As with other popular festivals, a number of posters have been produced honoring Festivals Acadiens. Lafayette artists Robert Dafford and George Rodrigue have each designed a poster for this year's festival. Dafford's was produced for the Festival de Musique Acadienne, and Rodrique's for the festival as a whole. Also, an official commemorative silkscreen poster has been produced for the 1981 Festivals Acadiens. I LAGNIAPPE DAY offers a little ~^^^III3 something extra for those who work hard. The day of hanging loose and be- ing with friends. Forgetting the hustle and bustle, the seriousness of work and the pursuit of a particular goal — relax- ing and just being you. LAGNIAPPE DAY is held every Spring semester. It is like having your own private \"MARDI GRAS\" (\"FAT TUESDAY\"). School is of- ficially cancelled that day and Lagniappe Day is always on a Wednes- day. The only stipulation that this event has is that students are re- quired to attend classes the day before and the day after. AW! AW! BOO! HISS! Somehow that doesn't seem fair, but who are we to argue — we are only mere college students. The day is filled with face painting, games, that good ole Cajun music and zydeco and a very down-home feeling. The highlighted activity is the crawfish boil at Blackam Col- iseum. \"Hay-bear (Hebert), I tell you man it's finger lickin' good.\" to this strange environment, always attempt the most drastic — like swallowing swords and the usual stuff like that. So if you're ever in our neighborhood during the Spring semester, and you hear a lot of Hootin' and Hollerin', you'll know it's LAGNIAPPE DAY or the students have finally gone BANANAS!!!

In this production of \"West Side Story,\" directed by G. A. Beaman Griffin, several USL students made their debuts with the guild, as did several area performers. In the roles of the ill-fated lovers. Miss Claire Dugas as Maria, and David Delahoussaye as Tony sang v^ith the Opera Guild for the first time. Miss Dugas is a voice major at USL, and Mr. Delahoussaye works in Lafayette. Both are from New Iberia. The role of Anita was played by Mrs. Claire Shelby of Lafayette. Clay David of New Iberia played the role of Bernardo, her boyfriend and leader of the Sharks gang. Both appeared in major roles for the ifirst time with the Opera Guild. The role of j Riff, leader of the Jets, was played by Bob Pastor of Lafayette, also a newcomer to the ' guild.

Dr. Allan Dennis, newly ap pointed conductor of the USL orchestr program, conducted the performance. \"West Side Story\" opened at the Winte Garden Theater in New York in 1957 an^ ran for 981 performances. The story, a originally conceived by Jerome Robbins was to have retold the Romeo and Julit legend in terms of young Irish and Jewis lovers. However, Robbins and Leonar Bernstein decided the Irish-Jewish them had been run dry on Broadway, and ha little contemporary validity. But the influx of Puerto Ricans in Nei, York offered a group given to high passiO| and violence — the very meat ( Shakespeare's story. Their gang was su(: gested a likely substitute for family feuds.

By ANDRE J. DA V] Being a writer-in-residence in Acadiana does not present much of a cultural change for well-known author Ernest Gaines, since he was born on a sugarcane plantajtion in Pointe Coupee Parish and lived there for 15 years. In an interview with Charles Rowell that took piace in Batbn Rouge and was published in the May 1978 edition of 'Callaloo #3,' Gaines expressed his feelings to occasionally return to Louisiana as he does periodically \"to be with the land in different seasons, to travel the land, to go into the fields, to go into the small towns, to go into the bars, to eat the food, to listen to the language.\" Recently interviewed in his office on the University of Southwestern Louisiana campus, Gaines explain- ed some of the provocative elements that are rooted in his life and have affected his novels, particularly the one that is most widely known. The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. The greatest impact on his writing career, Gaines recalls, was his crippled aunt who raised him and his younger sisters and brothers at False River. When he was 15, Gaines moved to Vailejo, California to receive a better education. There, he lived with his parents, his mother and stepfather.^He frequented the public library and read as much as possible. He noticed the paucity of black writers and this fact, coupled with the loneliness of being away from Louisiana, inspired him to write. ^ ; Jk JMI At 16, Gaines burned*!^ first manuscript he hid ever written and sent to a NfewYork publisher. It had been returned to him with a rejection slip. Gaines admits the story was bad because he did not know how JU^tqjreate a plot or develop a character. ^iHlHii^ think the writer or painter or musician has to go through an apprenticeship,\" Gaines says, emphasiz- ing that he set his foundation of writing skills early with 10 years of training, from 1957 to 1967. During those years, Gaines attended San Francisco State College, where he received his bachelor's degree in English Literature. He originally intended to study creative writing, but at the time, the college had no curriculum in that discipline. rpHRWpost office clerk, to make CT> d J^eet,\" he recalls. toia University.

The baseballers earned around a 19-29-2 season in 1980 and recorded an astonishing 40-23 mark for 1981. Mel Didier's first year as head coach at USL was indeed astonishing. Five regulars ended the season batting over .300. EVERY pitcher on the squad finished the season with a winning record. The Cajun defense set a new double play record. With this kind of success, one would think that Mel Didier was a shoo-in for Coach of the Year honors in the Southland Conference, right? Right. Did he get it? No. Didier took it all in stride, though. In an understatement, he said, \"I think we surprised a lot of people this year.\" The Cajuns did indeed sur- prise a lot of people. Fans started coming to games in droves. Crowds of over 1,000 people ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^T'^^^'^^^^m m were commonplace for con- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^E ^^^I^B^ ference games, and fan support for night games helped create more interest for baseball than at any other time in modern listory. \"We laid a good founda- lon for the future this season,\" Didier said, \"And if we can get jome help in the right places I lave no doubts that we can be ?ver better in the next few reasons.\" And with a little sup- port from the right places, he :ould have a lock on Coach of he Year for the next few seasons. \\ Mel Didier — Coach of the Year in hearts of fans. 3 J 5A 1 1 INLj A R TJT 11 OR ZD 1R JD l-TP rlK TR 1 P bpct.

The Cajuns finished fourth after going into the meet as one of the favorites for the overall title. But, as Cole will readily admit, \"It sure beats last year's finish.\" And that it did. USL improved on its 1980 last place showing with strong performances from such athletes as Martin Lawson, Craig Lee, and Curtis Washington. All three were SLC champs: Washington in the 800 meters, Lee in the discus, and Lawson in the 400 meter hurdles. Lawson went on to make the NCAA semifinals in his event before being eliminated.

TENNIS TEAM WINS FOURTH TITLE IN FIVE YEARS The USL tennis team continued its winning ways by re-capturing the SLC championship that it had lost last year to the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs. The Bulldogs were providing the stiffest competition again this year by remaining even with the Cajuns going into the final days of play. On that final day, though, USL captured three singles titles and swept Louisiana Tech in three straight doubles matches to run away with the title. \"It was a fitting end to the season,\" head coach Jerry Simmons said. The Cajuns completed their record-breaking season with a 24-5 overall record, with all five losses coming to teams ranked in the na- tion's Top 20. The 24 dual match wins sets a school record for most wins in a single season and the .828 win- ning percentage is also a school record. USL will enter the 1982 spring season with another school record under their belts, that being a 15 match winning streak, with an excellent chance to extend that mark even further. All in all, the Cajuns qualified a total of seven individuals for All-Conference honors in the league tournament, a school as well as a conference record. Impressive, to say the least. HEAD COACH JERRY SIMMONS PATRICK HUGHESMAN \\BOVE: James Boustany overhead. iELOW: Jim Price rips a backhand. ABOVE RIGHT: Time for a break! BASKETBALL FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT If there is one word that sums up USL's basketball future, that word is \"bright.\" The 1980-81 Cajuns com- piled a 15-13 win-loss record against a tough schedule that included a total of ten teams that made the post- season playoffs. Next season could be even better, because the Cajuns are returning nine lettermen with five players who started in thirteen or more games. The players that USL will lose to graduation will hurt, though. They include honorable mention All-American Kevin Figaro (who was chosen by the Atlanta Hawks in the NBA draft), Wayne Julien, Craig Monroe, and Andrew Dorsey. Coach Bobby Paschal will enter his fourth year as head coach of the Cajuns, with an overall collegiate record of 52-33 (.612). He is particularly pleased with the play of three freshman recruits, Graylin Warner, Dion Brown, and Alonza Allen. These three, along with the play of junior college transfer Alford \"Pop\" Turner, sophomore stan- dout Dan Gay, the seniors men- tioned before, and the rest of the 1980-81 USL Ragin Cajun basketball team, gave fans a very exciting season, and the promise of many more to come.

Il LONG FOOTBALL SEASON FINALLY OVER First, the unpleasant facts. USL's football Ragin' Cajuns ended their 1981 season with a record of 1-9-1 )verall; 0-4-1 in conference play. The overall mark was the worst for a USL team since the 1973 squad put ogether an 0-10 record. There may be a bright side to to all of this, however. After all, seven of those ten lon-victories were decided in the final moments of play, and USL had the ball with a chance to score a ty- ng or winning touchdown in the final minute of play in six of .those games. Another bright spot in an )therwise dismal year was the play of several freshmen who were inserted into the starting lineup after a ew of the more established players violated curfew in the week after the homecoming loss to Texas- ^lington. Freshman quarterback Don Wallace, for one, showed Cajun fans that they have a lot more to ook forward to in the future than one-win seasons. But let's not forget about the 13 seniors who gave their all during their varsity careers. The list includes wide receiver Claude Charles, quarter- back Curt Caladarera, punter Larry Trussell, wide receiver Freddie Taylor, linebacker Mark Malkemus, cornerback Michael Dupre, linebacker Rob Falivene, tight end Brent Anderson, free safety David Pingston, offensive guard Keith Hall, defensive tackle Kent Head, and center James Hamilton. These Cajuns have been through a lot together, including a 7-4 record just one year ago and a second-place Southland Conference finish. Claude Charles was named the SLC's \"Player of the Week\" twice in 1981, and Michael Dupre received that honor once. The only non-senior to win the award was Don Wallace for his outstanding performance against Lamar. All things considered, Cajun fans have a lot to look for- ward to next season. . 7 1 . ^W* CURT CALDARERA USL (1-9-1) Tim 7 \\Ai cci cci T^r^i bt Louisiana 7 USL 0 NE Louisiana 20 USL 17 USL 34 North Texas State 11 Arkansas USL 3 State 14 East Carolina 35 USL 31 Southern Illinois 41 USL 17 USL 17 La.
