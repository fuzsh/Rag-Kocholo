        "text": "AC Milan bidoni.\n\nCouple of days ago, I saw an interesting discussion about the worst Juventus XI of all times on twitter. I liked the idea as it was fun ( I found out later that it’s equally depressing) . So I decided to do a little bit of research and assemble Milan’s worst squad of all time.\n\nAc Milan has a great history with talented players. Milan along Juventus with 6 Ballon D’Or winners ( 8 in total as Michel Platini and Marco Van Basten both won the award three times) are the most-joint winners of this award. Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi , Rui Costa , Zlatan Ibrahimovic and other incredibly talented players also played for Milan without winning the prestigious award.\n\nPredictably though , just like every other club , Milan has also had bad experiences with players who were simply not good enough for such a big club (or for any other football club if you allow me to say) . So after a some research I finally assembled a full squad consisting the worst players who have played for Milan. It was tricky as a lot of criteria had to be considered. I decided that talent (well the lack of it here) was the most important criteria, then the transfer fee payed for the player and at the end the amount of time that the player actually played for the club. I chose 4-3-3 as the starting XI formation as it was the formation which suited our untalented players the most in my opinion.\n\nSo without any further ado here is my worst Milan squad of all time:\n\nGoalkeeper :\n\nZeljko Kalac : It had to be him. It was between him and Jens Lehmann,and despite Lehmann’s awful spell at Milan,his successful career after leaving Milan made me go with Kalac. 6 ft 8 long he was probably one of the most awkward player to have ever played for AC Milan. In all fairness he joined Milan for free after Perugia suffered two consecutive relegations ( the last one because of financial troubles) , but still it doesn’t hide the fact that even as a 2nd goalkeeper he wasn’t good enough for Milan. One of the biggest mysteries is why Marco Storari was the 3rd choice behind Kalac. While I still believe a normal goalkeeper would have saved Cesc’s goal against Milan in 2007-2008’s CL round of 16, many will remember him for his hilarious performance against Chelsea in a summer friendly game which I firmly believe is one of the worst goalkeeping performance in the last decade where he concede 5 goals . He made 38 appearances in 4 years before leaving Milan in the summer of 2009 .\n\nDefenders:\n\nRoque Junior : Probably the most difficult position as Milan has had great right backs through the years. Maoro Tassotti , Christian Panucci , Thomas Helveg and Cafu were all great players. Even though Roque Junior spent all his career as a central defender but I had no choice but to use him as a right back. After 5 impressive years at Palmeiras the Brazilian joined Milan in 2000. A slow and error prone defender who somehow managed to play 44 games for Milan .To tell the truth I will always be grateful of him after he played for almost an hour through pain in 2003 champions league final against Juventus without making a mistake ( which was very rare of him ) . He was even in the Brazil squad that won the world cup in 2002. Leeds united fans also have horrible memories of Roque Junior as he had an horrendous spell there after leaving Milan.\n\nDigao : It’s very simple : Digao would have never become a footballer (let alone a Milan player ) if he wasn’t Kaka’s brother . Probably one of the worst foreign players ever to play in Italy or any other country for that matter. He made only 1 appearance with Milan then had 5 unsuccessful loan spells in various clubs such as Remini, Standard Liege and Penafiel ( A relatively unknown Portuguese club who played in the third division when Digao joined them.\n\nPhilippe Senderos : I have many questions to ask Galliani if I meet him one day , and the first one would be about the signing of Senderos. While he had some good performances with Arsenal,he was always known to be a shaky defender. Towards the end of his Arsenal career he was simply an awful defender and had fell out of favor with Arsène Wenger , then out of nowhere Galliani decided to sign Senderos on a season loan deal with an option to make the move permanent (thank god it didn’t happen) . After making 14 forgettable performances and lots of injuries and despite his will to make his move permanent the management obviously were not impressed and decided to send him back to Arsenal. His next adventure with Everton was equally unimpressive. He now plays for Fulham.\n\nDjamel Mesbah: Where to start…. After the introduction of Financial Fair Play and the ill economical situation of Milan, Galliani chose the low cost transfer strategy. Milan signed many free agent or low cost players. Some turned out to be good additions while others were simply not good enough. After Maldini, Serginho and Jankolovski Milan struggled a lot to find a steadt left back. Antonini, Didac Vila and more recently Kévin Constant and De Sciglio were all tested out but the worst was Mesbah. Bad crosser, with no sense of positioning he was a torture to watch. His performance away at home against Arsenal was a disaster . oxlade chamberlain and Walcott enjoyed so much freedom on Milan’s left flank and two of their 3 goals came from that side . Fortunately it wasn’t enough to eliminate Milan ,it certainly was enough to realize that Mesbah wasn’t Milan material.\n\nMidfield :\n\nDiego De Ascentis: After 3 relatively successful seasons with Bari he joined Milan in the summer of 99. He was just one of those players who wasn’t good enough for a big club like Ac Milan, just a plain destroyer of the game and unlike other great destroyers like Gattuso he didn’t posses a great passing ability. He made 19 appearances but failed to convince and left the club the following summer and joined Torino. He retired in 2010 and is now a CrossFitter.\n\n“I have always been a very physical ” De Ascentis quoted after changing his career.\n\nChedric Seedorf: Another player who would have never become a footballer if he didn’t have a genius relative. Just like his brother Clarence he is a ajax academy product but unlike many superstars who started their career at Ajax he had no talent whatsoever. He then joined Real Madrid and Inter’s youth academies until 2001. After some loan spells in Serie C and in Serie B he miraculously ( not really as Clarence played for Milan then) joined Ac Milan in the summer of 2008. Without making a single appearance he left the club and is now a free agent.\n\nEmerson : It was a difficult choice. There were many candidates who had a very less successful career than Emerson such as Orlandini, Maini, Blomqvist or even Pablo Garcia. Emerson was a great midfielder at Roma where he helped them win a scudetto before joining Juventus for 12 million + Matteo Brighi who was one of the hottest talents of that time. After a relatively successful spell at Turin he jumped the ship after the Calciopoli saga and joined Real Madrid with Capello. The two didn’t get along as good as before and after criticizing the club’s president he was forced to leave Real and joined Milan for a fee around 6 million euros. This is where everything started. Emerson had lost his legs and after many injuries and forgettable performances he terminated his contract in april of 2009. He made 27 appearances for Milan in two seasons.\n\nAttack:\n\nAmantino Mancini: Once one of the most exciting players in Serie A at Roma,he inexplicably became a true bidone at Inter and then of course at Milan. After shining with Roma under Capello and then Spalletti for 5 seasons he joined Inter in the summer of 2008 for €13 M but failed to reproduce the same kind of performances consistently. After 2 uninspiring seasons at Inter he joined their rivals Ac Milan in January 2010 on a loan deal with an option for the Rossoneri to acquire half of the player’s rights at the end of the loan spell. He made his debut for Milan against Bologna and made 6 other performances which were simply awful. He is one of the worst Brazilians that has played for Milan in the last decade. He was found guilty of rape and assault in 2011 and was sentenced to two years and eight months in jail to complete the disaster.\n\nJavi Moreno : There is a myth that Spanish strikers can’t be successful in Serie A and it’s actually based on facts. Jose Mari and Javi Moreno are two prime examples of Spanish players who were relatively successful in La Liga but had a disastrous time in Serie A. In Javi Moreno’s case the management should equally take the blame as after just one good season they inexplicably decided to spend €14M on him and overlook his past seasons. He made 16 appearances for Milan scoring only 2 goals in 2001-2002 season and failed to impress. He was sent back to Spain the following season. His spells at Atletico Madrid, Bolton and Zaragoza were all unsuccessful and he finally hang his boots in 2010. What a waste of money.\n\nRicardo Oliveira : Ac Milan has had exceptional players through the years who wore the number 7 shirt. Shevchenko being one of them. He was probably my favorite striker of all time and one of the best players to have worn the Milan shirt in the past 15 years. He was sold to chelsea in the summer of 2006 which broke many of our hearts. But we were told not to worry as Ricardo Oliveira joined Milan right after to replace Sheva with a deal of cash plus Johaan Vogel moving to the opposite direction which in total was reportedly worth around €17M .He took the number 7 and frankly after two impressive seasons at Betis I and surely many other fans expected great things from the Brazilian. He even had an exciting start to his Milan career as he scored in his debut at San Siro against Lazio where Milan won 2-1. But that was it, he only scored 2 more goals in his 2 years at Milan and made a total of 26 appearances for the Rossoneri. One of the most disappointing transfers of Milan’s history. He is currently playing Al Jazira and is having a small success in Abu Dhabi.\n\nSubstitutions : Lehmann , Onyewu , Bogarde , Ba , Vogel , Blomqvist , Jose Mari.\n\nHead Coach : OSCAR TABAREZ\n\nSporting director and transfer guru : Ariedo Braida , the man who always travels but no one knows what he does. He reportedly wasn’t impressed by Witsel when he played for Standard Liege. Witsel is today one of the best young midfielders in Europe and recently joined Zenit Saint Petersbourgh for 40 million euros.\n\nStandard"
