        "text": "I've heard some say that he's of Calabrese descent, but a look at gens.labo.net shows that the name Maradona doesn't come up.\n\nI've also seen posters here say that he's of Italian descent, but I found nothing to confirm that.\n\nHe doesn't quite look Italian, and his parents look more like native South Americans than Italians.\n\nJust a curiosity, nothing more...would be interested in knowing.\n\nIt should come up since his son Maradona Jr. lives in Italy!\n\nbut yeah I think he has some Italian descent on his mother's side. I read his autobiography but he didn't mention anything.\n\nI have no idea how common that was for Italians emigrating to Argentina but it was very common here.\n\nI didn't know what his grandfather was called, just heard that he was from Croatia. I take it hes quarter Dalmatian Italian then.\n\nAt the end of the day I don't think it really matters since he will only ever be seen as \"Argentinian\" by the entire world since he won the World Cup with them. Rather than the other parts of his ethnicity such as Spanish, Italian, etc. The azzurri has the legacy of Roby Baggio anyway... and Omar Sivori (well Argentina has him too).\n\nMaybe if Maradona was a couple of decades earlier he would have played for Argentina then later Spain or Italy too, when that was allowed.\n\nWell, I believe about 70% of Argentina's population have at least some degree of Italian descent. For example, Claudio Caniggia clearly is of Italian descent. So I wouldn't be surprised at all if Maradona has indeed some degree of Italian descent. He's a mix of a lot of things and I think Italian descent is probably one of them.\n\nBy the way, interesting theory about the \"letters lost.\" As it was mentioned, that happened quite a lot in the USA. So it's not impossible that Maradona actually comes from Maradonna. But isn't Maradona also a possible Italian last name as well? It sounds Italian to me, but I'm not an expert on this.\n\nAnd people from Italian descent are not very rare anyway. I'm from The Netherlands and even I have also some degree of Italian descent (and my last name is Carli)."
