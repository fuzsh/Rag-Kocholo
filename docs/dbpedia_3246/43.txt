Alberto Gilardino scored twice for Milan against a team which has earned just two points in four matches and looked a shadow of the side that finished fourth last season.

Champions Juventus bounced back in style after losing their 100 per cent record last week when they were beaten 3-1 by Milan.

Livorno's resistance finally cracked on the hour. Patrick Vieira hoisted a long ball into the area and Zlatan Ibrahimovic conjured up a spectacular lob-volley. A minute later David Trezeguet grabbed Juve's second, his fifth goal in four matches, with a header.

Having lost control of the game, Livorno's players began to lose their discipline and Diego De Ascentis was red-carded for kicking out at Adrian Mutu before Alessandro Del Piero scored Juve's third in stoppage time.

Luca Toni consolidated his position as Serie A's top scorer by scoring his 13th goal in 11 matches as third-placed Fiorentina beat Ascoli 2-0.
