SERIE A

Having won the Scudetto in the previous season, the Rossoneri began the 1999/2000 season with one of the most significant transfers of recent history: Andriy Shevchenko. Alongside the Ukrainian, Gennaro Gattuso, Diego De Ascentis, José Antonio Chamot, José Mari and Serginho all joined AC Milan. The first objective of the season was the Supercoppa Italiana Final against Parma, which the Gialloblù won with a 92nd minute winner from Boghossian. The league campaign was of a high standard again, but the Rossoneri weren't involved in the two-horse Scudetto race between Juventus and Lazio, in which the Biancocelesti were the eventual winners after the disappointment of the previous year. The Rossoneri ended the season in third, eleven points from first-placed Lazio, qualifying for the Champions League for the second season running. Shevchenko enjoyed a brilliant debut season for the Rossoneri, winning top scorer with 24 goals. Valuable proof of his abilities. The Coppa Italia journey ended in the quarter-finals after two legs against Inter.
