The newly promoted side now have just two points from five outings so far this season, but Cairo's job is safe for the time being.

"I have a quite long plan and Zaccheroni is the right man," Cairo said.

Torino invested heavily over the summer, bringing in several players with Serie A experience, including Simone Barone, Diego De Ascentis and Stefano Fiore.

Zaccheroni himself was recruited by the Granata just three days prior to the start of the season following the shock sacking of Gianni De Biasi, giving the coach a limited amount of time to prepare the team in the way he would have liked.

In particular, the Torino defence has yet to gel and have conceded ten times already, a statistic defender Gianluca Comotto is all too aware of.

"We need to work and to work a lot," he said. "We need to get to know each other better.

"Zaccheroni arrived right at the last minute and with midweek matches we haven't had time for anything but studying our opponents."
