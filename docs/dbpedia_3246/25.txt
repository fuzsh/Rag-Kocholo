Marko Livaja is supposed to have very good potential but it's very hard to get a work permit for him

sry for not posting screenshots to this one. I am rather a noob whit that

anyway

name: walter García

position: central defend

Age: 26

Nationality: Argentina/spain

wage: He ask for around 8000 ukp/week but can go as low as 7250/week

Really decent Defensive stats. Rather weak Technical.

Seems good enough to lower/mid best league or top second best league. got him to both atalanta and Le havre so far.
