        "text": "Glacierized coastal catchments of the Gulf of Alaska are undergoing rapid hydrologic fluctuations in response to climate change. These catchments deliver dissolved and suspended inorganic and organic matter to nearshore marine environments, however, these glacierized coastal catchments are relatively understudied and little is known about total solute and particulate fluxes to the ocean. We present hydrologic, physical, and geochemical data collected during April-October 2019-2021 from 10 streams along gradients of glacial fed to non-glacial (i.e., precipitation) fed, in one Southcentral and one Southeast Alaska region. Hydrologic data reveal that glaciers drive the seasonal runoff patterns. The ẟ18O signature and specific conductance show distinctive seasonal variations in stream water sources between the study regions apparently due to the large amounts of rain in Southeast Alaska. Total dissolved solids concentrations and yields were elevated in the Southcentral region, due to lithologic influence on dissolved loads, however, the hydroclimate is the primary driver of the timing of dissolved and suspended yields. We show the yields of dissolved organic carbon is higher and that the δ13CPOC is enriched in the Southeast streams illustrating contrasts in organic carbon export across the Gulf of Alaska. Finally, we illustrate how future yields of solutes and sediments to the Gulf of Alaska may change as watersheds evolve from glacial influenced to precipitation dominated. This integrated analysis provides insights into how watershed characteristics beyond glacier coverage control properties of freshwater inputs to the Gulf of Alaska and the importance of expanding study regions to multiple hydroclimate regimes.\n\nJordan Jenckes\n\n·\n\nSebastian Muñoz\n\n·\n\nDaniel Enrique Ibarra\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nLee Ann Munk\n\nHigh latitude regions across the globe are undergoing severe modifications due to changing climate. A high latitude region of concern is the Gulf of Alaska (GoA), where these changes in hydroclimate undoubtedly affect the hydrogeochemistry of freshwater discharging to the nearshore ecosystems of the region. To fill the knowledge gap of our understanding of freshwater stream geochemistry with the GoA, we compile stream water chemistry data from 162 stream sites across the region. With an inverse model, we estimate fractional contributions to solute fluxes from weathering of silicate, carbonate, and sulfide minerals, and precipitation. We assess weathering rates across the region and compare them against global river yields. The median fractional contribution of carbonate weathering to total weathering products is 78% across all stream sites; however, there are several streams where silicate weathering is a dominant source of solutes. Weathering by sulfuric acid is elevated in glacierized watersheds. Finally, cation weathering rates are lower in GoA streams compared to the world's largest rivers; however, weathering rates are similar when compared to a global dataset of glacier fed streams. We suggest that hydrologic changes driven by glacier ice loss and increased precipitation will alter river water quality and chemical weathering regimes such that silicate weathering may become a more important source of solutes and sulfide oxidation may decrease. This contribution provides a platform to build from for future investigations into changes to stream water chemistry in the region and other high latitude watersheds.\n\nView\n\nAeon Russo\n\n·\n\nD. F. Boutt\n\n·\n\nLee Ann Munk\n\n·\n\nJordan Jenckes\n\nHigh latitude mountain environments are experiencing disproportionately adverse effects from climate change. The Gulf of Alaska (GoA) region is an embodiment of this change, particularly concerning a shifting hydrologic balance. Even so, the magnitude and contribution of fresh submarine groundwater discharge (fresh SGD) remains virtually unexplored within the region, though it has gained increasing attention globally due to its chemical significance and influence on coastal ecosystems. Here we provide the first regional estimates of fresh SGD to the GoA using two established water balance approaches. This is an effective way to distinguish the contribution of terrestrially derived fresh SGD, rather than the more commonly quantified total SGD which includes discharge that is driven by marine forces such as sea‐level oscillations and density gradients. We compare the approaches and assess their capabilities in computing the magnitude of fresh SGD over a large regional scale. Mean annual fresh SGD flux ranges between 26.5 and 86.8 km³ yr⁻¹ to the GoA, equivalent to 3.5%–11.4% of the total freshwater discharge. Contributions are highest in the Southeastern panhandle and lowest in the Cook Inlet basin, with the highest area normalized contribution occurring in the Prince William Sound. Fresh SGD exhibits high spatial and temporal variability throughout the region. Although freshwater discharge to the GoA is investigated considerably, the importance of fresh SGD has, thus far, been overlooked.\n\nView"
