An exploratory study was conducted through qualitative content analysis. Three focus groups were conducted with 25 primary school teachers (14 women and 11 men) working in 14 public and 7 private schools in the city of Alicante. Participants were asked about the health activities carried on in their schools. Teachers distinguished between health education activities promoted by the school and those included in external programmes promoted by public and private institutions. External programmes were considered as impositions, lacking continuity and chosen according to passing fads. Although teachers demonstrated a more positive attitude towards activities arising from their own initiative, they identified health education as a secondary task. Teachers considered that improving their own health education training and promoting the involvement of parents, health professionals and public institutions were the most appropriate ways to promote health education in the school. Teachers showed a more positive opinion and greater commitment towards health activities that complement and facilitate their teaching tasks. Their didactic programme and opinion should be taken into account to maximise the efficiency of the health promotion and education activities promoted by external organisations.

This paper investigates water use in 450 households in 10 municipalities of drought-prone Alicante (Spain). We aim to increase knowledge about existing domestic water behaviors and therefore help to improve the design and implementation of future water awareness campaigns and even to consolidate reductions in water use after drought periods. The survey suggests that awareness campaigns should revise their scope and their channels of diffusion on a regular basis. In a more specific way, for the Alicante case we propose policy-oriented recommendations on the scope of action for further reductions.\n\nAssessing domestic water use habits for more effective water awareness campaigns during drought periods: a case study in Alicante, Eastern Spain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarch, H.; HernÃ¡ndez, M.; SaurÃ­, D.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe design of water awareness campaigns could benefit from knowledge on the specific characteristics of domestic water use and of the factors that may influence certain water consumption habits. This paper investigates water use in 450 households of 10 municipalities of drought prone Alicante (Spain) with the objective of increasing knowledge about existing domestic water behavior and therefore help to improve the design and implementation of future water awareness campaigns. The survey results indicate that users already follow many of the conservation practices mentioned in messages. Moreover, campaigns need to take into account the differences in water use and habits derived from differences in urban models (concentrated or disperse).\n\nIncrease in the exposition to floods in the Alicante coast (Valencia region, Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOlcina, J.; Rico, A. M.; Hernandez, M.; MartÃ­nez, E.\n\n2009-09-01\n\nDuring the last two decades, Flood episodes along the Alicante coastline have caused important material losses and general disruptions of everyday life in the municipalities affected. We can speak of an increase in the vulnerability to floods chiefly as a result of an increase in exposition. In turn this increase is fundamentally linked to the nature of the recent urbanization process in this area and the corresponding occupation of flood prone land. The province of Alicante occupies one of the first positions in Europe regarding flood risk (ESPON 2006). Even counting with legislation that regulates land uses, processes leading to the occupation of flood risk areas have proven very difficult to manage. In this sense, the Valencia region has enacted legislation such as the Land Use Planning Law of 1989, the Law on Urban Growth Regulations of 1994, and the Planning Regulations of 1998. All these legal pieces attempted to prohibit development in flood prone land declaring this land as \"non.urban\". New laws such as the Law on Land Use Planning and Landscape protection of 2004, the Law on New Urban Land (2004), and the Decree on Landscape (2006) also consider the need to include the flood hazard in planning activities. Furthermore in 1997, the so-called \"Cartography of the flood hazard at the regional level\" was elaborated. This mapping exercise was the base for the \"Territorial Plan for the Reduction of Flood Risks (PATRICOVA) approved in 2003 and currently the main planning tool for flood management in Valencia. On the other hand, the European Directive 60/2007 pointed towards the need to take into consideration the social perception of Flood risks in order to develop integrated actions of risk management. Accordingly we have undertaken 285 interviews in the coastal communities of Alicante, Calpe and Campello (95 interviews each). We have chosen these municipalities for two reasons: first their significance in population and economic activity terms, and second, their\n\nEvaluation of coastal management: Study case in the province of Alicante, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nPalazÃ³n, A; AragonÃ©s, L; LÃ³pez, I\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe beaches are complex systems that can be studied from different points of view and meet more than a mission to protect the coast. Their management consists of assigning solutions to problems and for this to be correct all factors involved have to be taken into account. In order to understand how management is done on the coast of the province of Alicante, surveys have been conducted among the managers of the 19 coastal municipalities of Alicante coast, covering the 91 beaches. The aim of the surveys is to try to know the problems and situations relating to the management, depending on different factors such as the level of urbanization and type of sediment. In addition, it has been investigated whether this management is aimed to protect the coastline, maintain the flora and fauna or is just a recreational management since the main economic activity is tourism. The beaches are conceived of as products offered to the user, which is what most concerns its economic importance in an area where the sun and beach tourism has a special share of the GDP. The ignorance as to the major problems regarding their physical functioning and the inability to solve them is due to a complex administrative system with which the coastal system is regulated inefficiently. The integral approach is essential for a complete and effective management of the coastal environment. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A retrospective observational study was made of individuals between 15-65 years of age who died in the period 2006-2014 in Elche University General Hospital (Alicante, Spain). A univariate analysis and binary logistic regression predictive model were performed to discriminate factors related to donation contraindication. Identification of patients with donation contraindication. Of the 1510 patients who died in the mentioned period, 1048 were excluded due to the application of exclusion criteria; 86 due to evolution towards brain death; and 20 due to losses. A total of 356 patients were analyzed, divided into two groups: 288 in non-heart beating donation II and 68 in non-heart beating donation III. Seventy patients were found to be potential non-heart beating donation II and 10 were found to be potential non-heart beating donation III, which could increase donation activity by 8-9 donors a year. The patients died in the ICU, Resuscitation, Emergency Care, Internal Medicine, Digestive Diseases and Neurology. The following protective factors against organ donation contraindication were identified: death in Emergency Care, cardiorespiratory arrest before or during admission, and heart, respiratory and neurological disease as the cause of admission. Death in Internal Medicine was associated to an increased risk of donation contraindication. Implementing a non-heart beating donation protocol in our hospital could increase the donation potential by 8-9 donors a year. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U. y SEMICYUC.

To date, few studies of the skin diseases of immigrants to Spain have been done. To determine the frequency of visits by immigrants to our dermatology clinic, to describe their skin complaints, and to compare them to those of the autochthonous Spanish population. Prospective, descriptive, analytic study, with an observational substudy of cases and controls from a cross-section of the population. We included all immigrant patients seen at the dermatology clinic between February 2005 and February 2006. Visits by immigrants to the dermatology clinic accounted for 4.1% of the caseload. Their most frequent complaints were eczematous dermatitis (18.4%), viral warts (6.4%), and acne (6.3%). Comparison between the immigrant and autochthonous patient populations showed that eczematous dermatitis, alopecia, melasma, ringworm, scabies, Herpes simplex infection, keratosis pilaris, and xerosis were significantly more frequent among immigrant patients, whereas viral warts, actinic keratosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, lupus, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma were significantly less frequent (P < .05). The immigrant population consults the dermatologist about skin conditions that are already well represented in our routine practice. As the infectious skin diseases of immigrants are also common in our environment, these patients are unlikely to transmit serious tropical skin diseases to the local population.

Some authors suggest that there is a relationship between adolescents with overweight or obesity and lower self-esteem. In addition, sports participation has been associated with a higher self-esteem. To analyses the relationships between BMI, gender, acceptance for physical education classes and self-esteem in a representative sample of 14-16 years students of the Alicante city. Research was conducted with a representative sample of 1,150 students (15.1 Â± 0.8 years) of the Alicante city. Data included their socio-demographic background, anthropometric measurements, self-esteem and acceptance for physical education classes. There is a positive correlation between acceptance for physical education classes and self-esteem (r= .319) and there is a negative correlation between this acceptance and gender (r= -.289), lower scores were shown in a female group. There is a negative correlation between self-esteem and BMI (r= -.083) and gender (r= -.308), lower self-esteem were shown in a female group. It is necessary to plan actions aimed as reinforcing and increasing self-esteem during the adolescent period, focusing on the group of girls and the group of young adults with overweight and obesity problems and especially in the girl group.

There is no doubt that their health has become a relevant subject from the point of view of public healthcare. Our study aimed to describe hospital admission rates, diagnoses at hospital discharge, and mortality during hospital admissions in FCs from high-income countries (FCHICs), FCs from low-income countries (FCLICs), and autochthonous citizens (ACs). Methods A cross-sectional study was performed at two public hospitals in the city of Alicante (Spain) and its surrounding area. Utilization rates were estimated. Multivariate analysis adjusting for age and sex was performed on hospital admission rates, diagnoses at hospital discharge, service of admission, and mortality during hospital admission in FCHICs and FCLICs compared with ACs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] with 95% confidence intervals [CI]). Results 42,839 patients â¥15 years were discharged from the hospitals. The utilization rate was lower in FCs than ACs, whose crude rate ratio was 0.676 (95% CI: 0.656-0.696). FCHICs had more risk of being diagnosed at discharge in the categories of the circulatory system (AOR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.35-1.77), neoplasms (AOR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03-1.42), and injury and poisoning (AOR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.11-1.58). FCLICs had more risk of being diagnosed in the categories of pregnancy, childbirth & puerperium (AOR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.29-1.59), and injury and poisoning (AOR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03-1.36), and less risk in the mental disorder category (AOR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.22-0.45). The length of hospitalization (in days) was lower in FCLICs (median: 3; IQR: 2â6) than both ACs (median: 4; IQR: 2â8) and FCHICs (median: 4; IQR: 2â8) (p < 0.001). The mortality rates on admission of ACs, FCHICs, and FCLICs were 4.2%, 3.3%, and 1.3%, respectively, but after adjusting for age and sex, the mortality rate risks were similar in FCHICs and FCLICs. Conclusion First, FCs utilized hospitalization less when\n\n[Head masters' perception of school-based hostility in Alicante, Spain: a qualitative study].\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez FernÃ¡ndez, Carmen; HernÃ¡ndez-Aguado, Ildefonso; Torres Cantero, Alberto M\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThere is growing social concern about school violence but little is known about how this situation is experienced in the schools. The objective of this study was to know the perception that School's head masters have of the school-based hostility, on their causes, how they value current preventive strategies, and their recommendations to develop future preventive interventions. We conducted an exploratory study with 14 semistructured interviews of School's head masters. Interviews were conducted at the Schools between May and June 2003 in 1 independent school, 9 state comprehensive schools, and 4 other comprehensive schools within the city of Alicante. The perception of the head masters is that the prevalence of violence is low, more verbal than physical and within gender. They identify lack of punctuality, absenteeism and lack of interest as forms of hostility. As causes they identified age, family problems, school environment, society, media (TV and video-games) and poor language skills. Preventive methods in use were, on one hand, extra-lessons and transversal contents foreseen in the Education Law and common to all schools, and, on the other hand, ideological and pedagogical contents which were specific of some centres. Recommendations focused in demands for increased economic support and skilled human resources. School-based violence is not perceived as an alarming school issue, nor by its magnitude neither by the immediate causes and students' characteristics to which it is associated. A heavier emphasis is placed on external and environmental causes perceived as much more difficult to confront.\n\nThe use of webcam images to determine tourist-climate aptitude: favourable weather types for sun and beach tourism on the Alicante coast (Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIbarra, Emilio MartÃ­nez\n\n2011-05-01\n\nClimate has an obvious influence on tourism as a resource and as a location factor for tourist activities. Consequently, the tourist phenomenon in general is heavily controlled by meteorological conditionsâin short, by the climate. In this article, the author proposes a set of weather types with which to establish the climate aptitude for sun and beach tourism. To determine these types, the density of use of one of the beaches with the lowest seasonality in continental Europe, the Levante Beach in Benidorm (Alicante, Spain), was analysed. Beach attendance was monitored using a webcam installed by the \"Agencia Valenciana de Turismo\". The relationship between the density of use of the lower and upper beach areas on the one hand, and meteorological variables on the other, allowed comfort (physiological equivalent temperature) and enjoyment (fractions of solar radiation) thresholds to be established. The appropriate hydric comfort values were obtained by comparing the ranges proposed by Besancenot in 1989 [Besancenot (1989) Clima et turismes. Massom, ParÃ­s] with numbers of visitors to the beach. The wind velocity and precipitation thresholds were selected following consultation with the literature and considering the climatic characteristics of the environment under analysis. Based on a combination of these thresholds, weather types suitable for this specific tourist activity are defined. Thus, this article presents a method for assessing the extent to which a day on the beach can be enjoyed. This has a number of applications, for planners, the tourism business and consumers alike. The use of this (filter) method in climate databases and meteorological forecasts could help determine the tourist season, the suitability of setting up a business associated with sun and beach tourism, as well as help plan holidays and program a day's leisure activities.

The accidents were characterised by studying 5 variables in order to know the day of the week in which the accident occurred, the hour of the day of the accident, type of accident, the region of Spain in which the accident happened, and the resulting injury. The data characterising the accidents were submitted to a descriptive multiple-correspondence analysis. The incidence of accidents in the greenhouse-construction industry presented a high mean value of 15133.7 per 100,000 workers per year. The days with the greatest incidence of accidents were Thursday and Monday, while the period of greatest number of accidents occurred in the first 4h of the workday. No significant correspondence was found between the day of the week, the hour of the day, or any of the other 3 variables studied. The types of accidents with most frequency were: cuts, punctures, contact with hard or rough material, overexertion, and falls from one level to another. The most affected parts of the anatomy were the eyes, thorax, back, sides, lower legs, and feet. The most common types of injury were bone fractures, twists and sprains, distended muscles, contusions, and being crushed. The study calls attention to the high number of accidents at work, which needs to be corrected by fulfilment of safety regulations at work, on the part of the company. Finally, recommendations are made to correct this situation of high number of accidents at work. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Gymnasts were analyzed several weights rooms of Alicante (urban area of southeastern Spain), where the measurements were 141 males aged between 18-45 years, aiming to enhance their muscle mass. We had in mind the calculation of BMI (kg/m2), the somatotype (endomorphy, mesomorphy and ectomorphy) and have been classified potential cases of muscle dysmorphia, using the Muscle appareance satisfaction escale. The sample was composed of 68 normoweight; 66 overweight and 7 obese, classified as MD in a 25.0% the normoweight, 33.3% overweight and 85.7% of the obese (p=0.004 ). On the somatotype, the only component that presents differences between non-MD and MD is mesomorphy (p=0.024). Muscle dysmorphia is a concept clearly difficult psychological diagnosable using anthropometric measures. Mesomorphy is the only measure that is increased in the MD, and may be a parameter to aid in the diagnosis and follow-up to the MD. In addition, the risk of developing MD is increase with the degree of obesity. Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014. Published by AULA MEDICA.

The present study examined the proportion of underachieving students using the Rasch measurement model. A sample of 643 first-year high school students (mean age = 12.09; SD = 0.47) from 8 schools in the province of Alicante (Spain) completed the Battery of Differential and General Skills (Badyg), and these students' General Points Average (GPAs) were recovered by teachers. Dichotomous and Partial credit Rasch models were performed. After adjusting the measurement instruments, the individual underachievement index provided a total sample of 181 underachieving students, or 28.14% of the total sample across the ability levels. This study confirms that the Rasch measurement model can accurately estimate the construct validity of both the intelligence test and the academic grades for the calculation of underachieving students. Furthermore, the present study constitutes a pioneer framework for the estimation of the prevalence of underachievement in Spain. PMID:26973586\n\nEmplacement of the Cabezo MarÃ­a lamproite volcano (Miocene, SE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGernon, Thomas M.; Spence, Samuel; Trueman, Clive N.; Taylor, Rex N.; Rohling, Eelco; J. Hatter, Stuart; Harding, Ian C.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nLamproite volcanoes are uncommon in the geological record but are exceptionally well preserved in the Betic Cordilleras of SE Spain, where they erupted during the Late Miocene (Tortonian to Messinian stages). The parent melts are thought to have been channelled through major lithospheric faults to erupt at or near the faulted margins of Neogene sedimentary basins. Lamproite magmas are thought to be relatively CO2-poor (<1 wt %) and are typically characterised by an effusive eruption style and the development of lava lakes and scoria cones. Cabezo MarÃ­a is a relatively small (Ë550 m diameter) lamproite volcano that was emplaced within the shallow-water marine-influenced Vera Basin. The lamproites are compositionally similar to those of the Roman Province and generally less potassic (K2O<5 wt%) than other (ultra-) potassic rocks in SE Spain (e.g. Cancarix, Fortuna). The initial eruption stages were dominated by explosive magma-water interactions and the formation of peperites. These are characterised by angular fragments of glassy lamproite lavas (and isolated lobes) incorporated in sediments, locally showing the effects of thermal metamorphism. Further, elutriation pipes and `jigsaw-fit' textures are observed in the peperites. The lavas and peperites are overlain by outward-dipping well-stratified scoria deposits defining part of a cinder cone, which is inferred to have emerged above sea level. Steep internal contacts with inward-dipping, structureless breccias likely represent the inner wall deposits of a central conduit. The deposits are cross-cut by late-stage dykes, which supplied fissure eruptions of geochemically similar lavas capping the scoria cone. The transition from explosive to effusive behaviour may reflect the decreased availability of water, possibly due to downward migration of the feeder conduit below the level of water-saturated sediments.\n\nReconstruction of past climate variability in SE Spain between 14 and 8 ka\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBudsky, Alexander; Scholz, Denis; Mertz-Kraus, Regina; Christoph, SpÃ¶tl; Gibert, Luis; Jochum, Klaus Peter; Andreae, Meinrat O.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nIn comparison to the large climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene, Holocene climate only underwent minor changes. Nevertheless, cyclic climate changes also occurred during the Holocene. The Bond events, represented by the presence of cold, ice-bearing waters from the north of Iceland as far south as the latitude of Britain, occurred at a cyclicity of about 1500 a and were particularly pronounced during the Early Holocene. However, their climatic impact on the terrestrial realm was not consistent over Europe, in particular with respect to changes in precipitation. Here we present a precisely dated high-resolution flowstone record from Cueva Victoria, SE Spain, a site well suited to study the competing influence of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea on the southern Iberian Peninsula. We sampled several flowstones with a thickness of up to 60 cm. 230Th/U-dating has shown that these deposits mainly formed during relatively warm climate intervals of the Middle and Late Pleistocene, i.e. interglacials and interstadials (Budsky et al., 2015; Gibert et al., 2016). Here we focus on a short (11 cm) flowstone sequence from the Holocene with a high temporal resolution (centennial for stable isotopes and annual for trace elements). The flowstone grew between 14 and ca. 8 ka b2k. The decreasing trend of the Î´18O and Î´13C values as well as of several trace elements between 12 and 11 ka b2k reflects an increase in temperature and precipitation at the beginning of the Holocene. In particular, Sr and Mg show a trend towards low and stable values. Subsequently, from 10.5 to 8 ka b2k, the Î´13C values show a high variability (-11 to -4), whereas the Î´18O values are rather stable (between -6 and -7). Maxima in Î´13C are interpreted as drier conditions in response to Bond events. These events possibly led to a change of the atmospheric circulation, affecting the vegetation in SE Spain, which evolved towards an open C3 vegetation at ca. 8 ka b2k concomitant with drier conditions\n\nHealthcare professionals' views of the experiences of individuals living with Crohn's Disease in Spain. A qualitative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-SanjuÃ¡n, SofÃ­a; Lillo-Crespo, Manuel; Richart-MartÃ­nez, Miguel; SanjuÃ¡n-Quiles, Ãngela\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCrohn's Disease (CD) in Spain lacks of a unified National Clinical Pathway and not even any early detection program and professional follow-up outpatient attention once it has been diagnosed. Little is known about the Spanish health professionals' views of the experiences of individuals living with Crohn's Disease nationwide and also about how the Spanish Health System faces this situation. A qualitative research method was conducted to explore this topic through in-depth interviews with eleven healthcare professionals, who represented different clinics treating people with CD from the province of Alicante (Spain). Three topics and seven sub-topics were derived from the analysis of the content emerging from the interviews.

Little is known about the Spanish health professionalsâ views of the experiences of individuals living with Crohnâs Disease nationwide and also about how the Spanish Health System faces this situation. A qualitative research method was conducted to explore this topic through in-depth interviews with eleven healthcare professionals, who represented different clinics treating people with CD from the province of Alicante (Spain). Three topics and seven sub-topics were derived from the analysis of the content emerging from the interviews. The three main topics were: the healthcare system as a hindrance for ongoing treatment of CD, the impact of the disease, support networks.

A cross-sectional, descriptive study was carried out in 1,025 children aged between 8 and 12 years old, recruited from seven randomly-selected schools in the province of Alicante. Of the total sample, 861 children had married parents and 164 had divorced parents. The children completed the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition and those with divorced parents also provided information on the current relationship between their parents. Quality of life was higher in children with married parents than in those with divorced parents, with higher scores in all dimensions. Children who reported conflict between their parents after the divorce had worse quality of life. These results confirm significant differences in quality of life according to family structure and revealed the relationship between children's self-perceived health and interparental conflict after divorce. We emphasize the importance of health professionals in providing guidance to divorced parents on preventing their children's health problems and facilitating adaptation to the new family situation.

Wastewater use in agriculture is not a new practice, all over the world this reuse has been common practice for a long time, but the concept is of greater importance currently because of the global water crisis. Replacement of freshwater by treated wastewater is seen as an important conservation strategy contributing to agricultural production, substantial benefits can derive from using this nutrient-rich waste water but there can also be a negative impact. For this reason it is necessary to know precisely the composition of water before applying it to the soil in order to guarantee minimal impact in terms of contamination and salinization. In this work we have been studying, for more than three years, different parameters in calcareous soils irrigated with treated wastewater in an agricultural Mediterranean area located at Biar (Alicante, SE Spain), with a crop of grape (Vitis labrusca). Three types of waters were used for the irrigation of the soil: fresh water (control) (TC), and treated wastewater from secondary (T2) and tertiary treatment (T3). Three different doses of irrigation have been applied to fit the efficiency of the irrigation to the crop and soil type during the study period. A soil sampling was carried out every four months. We show the results of the evolution of basal soil respiration (BSR), and its relationship with other parameters. We observed a similar pattern of behavior for BSR between treatments, a decrease at the first eighteen months of irrigation and an increase at the end of study. In our study case, the variations of BSR obtained for all the treatments seem to be closely related to the dose and frequency of irrigation and the related soil wetting and drying cycles. However, the results showed a negative correlation between BSR and\n\n75 FR 69666 - Formations of, Acquisitions by, and Mergers of Bank Holding Companies\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-11-15\n\n...

Currently the species has been collected in the coastal provinces of Girona, Barcelona, Tarragona, CastellÃ³n, Alicante and Murcia. The high synanthropism of the species, together with its anthropophilic behaviour and vectorial capacity to transmit several arboviruses, have led to the return of active transmission cycles of common diseases in the past such as Dengue virus and even the appearance of new tropical viruses as Chikungunya in southern Europe. This manuscript discusses the public health implications of the expected expansion of Ae. albopictus for much of the Iberian Peninsula, in the context of current climatic and sociodemographic situation. Moreover, several issues related with the control of the species in urban and suburban environments are exposed. Finally the preliminary data about other invasive aedines recently collected in the European continent are presented.\n\nInternational Conference on Chemistry and Physics of Electrified Interfaces Solid/Electrolyte and Biological Systems: Extended Abstracts and Programme Held in Bologna, Italy on 29 August - 2 September 1988\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1988-09-01\n\nConsiglio del Kiistri (propasta IRS!)

Discrimination can be approached as a health risk factor within the immigrant population's working environment, especially for those immigrants at greater risk from social exclusion and marginalisation. The aim of this study is to research perceptions of discrimination and the specific relationship between discrimination in the workplace and health among Spain's immigrant population. A qualitative study was performed by means of 84 interviews and 12 focus groups held with immigrant workers in five cities in Spain receiving a large influx of immigrants (Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante and Huelva), covering representative immigrant communities in Spain (Romanians, Moroccans, Ecuadorians, Colombians and Sub-Saharan Africans). Discourse narrative content analysis was performed using pre-established categories and gradually incorporating other emerging categories from the immigrant interviewees themselves. The participants reported instances of discrimination in their community and working life, characterised by experiences of racism, mistreatment and precarious working conditions in comparison to the Spanish-born population. They also talked about limitations in terms of accessible occupations (mainly construction, the hotel and restaurant trade, domestic service and agriculture), and described major difficulties accessing other types of work (for example public administration). They also identified political and legal structural barriers related with social institutions. Experiences of discrimination can affect their mental health and are decisive factors regarding access to healthcare services. Our results suggest the need to adopt integration policies in both the countries of origin and the host country, to acknowledge labour and social rights, and to conduct further research into individual\n\nImmigration experience of Latin American working women in Alicante, Spain: an ethnographic study 1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-JuÃ¡rez, Liliana; NoreÃ±a-PeÃ±a, Ana LucÃ­a\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: to describe the experience of Latin American working women regarding immigration, taking into account the expectations and conditions in which this process takes place. METHOD: ethnographic qualitative study. Data collection was performed by means of semi-structured interviews with 24 Latin American immigrant women in Spain. The information collected was triangulated through two focal groups. RESULTS: the expectations of migrant women focus on improving family living conditions. Social support is essential for their settling and to perform daily life activities. They declare they have adapted to the settlement country, although they live with stress. They perceive they have greater sexual freedom and power with their partners but keep greater responsibility in childcare, combining that with the role of working woman. CONCLUSIONS: migrant women play a key role in the survival of households, they build and create new meanings about being a woman, their understanding of life, their social and couple relationships. Such importance is shaped by their expectations and the conditions in which the migration process takes place, as well as their work integration.

A qualitative study based on 29 in-depth personal interviews and four group interviews with a total of 43 professionals working in public services (social and health-care services, women's refuges, the police force, the judiciary) and NGOs in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Alicante (Spain) in 2011. Current IPV services in Spain partially fail in their coverage of abused immigrant women due to barriers of (i) availability, such as the inexistence of culturally appropriate services; (ii) accessibility, as having a residence permit is a prerequisite for women's access to different services and rights; (iii) acceptability, such as women's lack of confidence in the effectiveness of services; and (iv) effectiveness, for example, lack of specific training among professionals on the issues of IPV and immigration. However, interviewees also identified facilitators, such as the enabling environment promoted by the Spanish Law on Gender-Based Violence (1/2004), and the impetus it has provided for the development of other specific legislative tools to address IPV in immigrant populations in Spain (availability, accessibility and effectiveness). Whilst not dismissing cultural barriers, aspects related to service structure are identified by providers as the main barriers and facilitators to immigrant women use of IPV services. Despite noteworthy achievements, improvements are still required in terms of mainstreaming assistance tailored to immigrant women's needs in IPV policies and services.

Data were obtained from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica, INE). The crude mortality rates were age-adjusted using the indirect method and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. National CC age-adjusted mortality rates have increasing slightly, varying from 3.09 deaths/100000 women in 1989 to 3.42 in 1996. The highest age-adjusted mortality rates corresponded to Seville, Palencia and Orense, with 4.13, 4.06 and 3.98 cases/100000 women, respectively. The lowest mortality rates were found in Las Palmas, Cantabria and Alicante with 2.63, 2.77 and 2.80 deaths/100000 women, respectively. A relative risk (RR) of 1.14 (95%CI: 0.98-1.32) ( P=0.048) was observed between the provinces with the lowest SES and highest mortality rate, and those with the highest SES and lowest mortality rate. The results of our study show a slight increasing trend in CC mortality rates in Spain during the period 1989-1997, and suggest that the variations among provinces and Autonomous Communities could be due to CC risk factors (SES related to human papillomavirus, parity, diet, etc.) and differences in early diagnosis.\n\nCarbon Balance in an Olive Orchard of SE Spain: Influence of Weed Cover\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSanchez-Canete, E. P.; Chamizo, S.; Serrano-Ortiz, P.; Lopez-Ballesteros, A.; Vicente-Vicente, J. L.; Kowalski, A. S.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAgriculture is largely responsible for greenhouse gas emissions due to deforestation, land use changes and inadequate practices. High carbon (C) losses in agricultural lands caused by inadequate soil management entail a reduction of their C sequestration capacity and make agriculture more vulnerable to climate change impact. However, this trend can be potentially reversed if adequate agricultural practices are applied. Olive trees are one of the most widespread crops in the Mediterranean region, especially in Spain. Due to climate characteristics of the Mediterranean region and soils characterized by poor structure and low organic matter content, these crops are subject to environmental problems including erosion, soil compaction, and the loss of soil fertility that, indeed, can be aggravated by conventional practices such as intensive tillage. No-till agriculture and maintenance of the spontaneous resident vegetation cover (hereinafter, \"weeds\") have been applied in olive orchards in order to reduce erosion and increase soil organic C content. However, the role of these conservation practices in C balance at ecosystem scale has not been assessed so far. In this study, we analyzed the influence of weeds against weed removal via herbicide application on the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in an olive orchard in JaÃ©n (SE Spain), by using two eddy covariance towers during the hydrological year 2014-2015. We found that the presence of weeds increased net C uptake during winter and early spring. However, after weeds were mowed in April and kept on the soil, net C uptake decreased in this treatment due to an increase in soil respiration. Despite the lower net C uptake observed during late spring, the presence of weeds increased C fixation at annual scale. During the year of study, the weed removal practice decreased C uptake by 50% compared to the olive orchard where weeds were kept. We conclude that maintenance of weeds in olive groves has a positive effect on CO2\n\nSinfonevada: Dataset of Floristic diversity inÂ SierraÂ Nevada forests (SE Spain)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPÃ©rez-Luque, Antonio JesÃºs; Bonet, Francisco Javier; PÃ©rez-PÃ©rez, RamÃ³n; RutÂ Aspizua; Lorite, Juan; Zamora, Regino\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract The Sinfonevada database is a forest inventory that contains information on the forest ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada mountains (SE Spain). The Sinfonevada dataset contains more than 7,500 occurrence records belonging to 270 taxa (24 of these threatened) from floristic inventories of the Sinfonevada Forest inventory. Expert field workers collected the information. The whole dataset underwent a quality control by botanists with broad expertise in Sierra Nevada flora. This floristic inventory was created to gather useful information for the proper management of Pinus plantations in Sierra Nevada. This is the only dataset that shows a comprehensive view of the forest flora in Sierra Nevada. This is the reason why it is being used to assess the biodiversity in the very dense pine plantations on this massif. With this dataset, managers have improved their ability to decide where to apply forest treatments in order to avoid biodiversity loss. The dataset forms part of the Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory (OBSNEV), a long-term research project designed to compile socio-ecological information on the major ecosystem types in order to identify the impacts of global change in this area.

To describe characteristics of dementia patients in the province of Alicante, as well as the profiles and roles of caregivers who assist them. Multi-centre prospective study carried out in 4 neurology departments in Alicante (June 2009 to January 2010). Dementia patients' relatives/caregivers were included in sequential order. The following variables were analysed: a) Demographic information pertaining to the patient and caregivers (age, sex, marital and employment status, educational level, relationship to patient); b) patient's family unit; c) motivating factor for primary caregiver (PC); d) secondary caregiver (SC) roles; e) country of citizenship of formal caregiver (FC) and source of remuneration (private/public); f) caregivers' knowledge of dementia. Most of our patients live at home (74.8%), and are female (69%) with Alzheimer's disease (78.4%) in a moderately severe stage (GDS level 4-5, 71.6%). PCs and SCs are mainly women (72.1% and 60.5% respectively), middle-aged and directly related to the patient (sons/daughters account for 64.3% of the PCs and 54.4% of the SCs); most are homemakers with a low educational level. Caregivers in the first category (PC) provide care due to moral obligation (75%), while those in the second (SC) involve patients in leisure or other stimulating activities (82.3%). Absent caregivers tend to be males (73.3%) residing long distances from the relative (52.4%). The FC tends to be female (91.7%), Spanish (81.8%) and privately remunerated. Women dominate the network of caregivers for dementia patients, whether as principal caregivers, supporting caregivers or formal caregivers (in all cases, they have only limited training in dementia management). Males are largely absent. Better knowledge of the care structure supporting dementia patients may be helpful in the overall management of these patients.

The Low Andarax River valley is located in an active seismic region, with the higher seismic hazard values in Spain. The landform is composed mainly by sedimentary materials which increase its seismic hazard due to the amplification of the seismic inputs and spectral resonances. We study seismic local effects in the Low Andarax River by analyzing the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) of ambient noise records. The noise data were recorded during two field campaigns in 2012 and 2013. There have been a total of 374 noise measurements with 15 and 30 minutes duration. The acquisition was performed with a Digital Broadband Seismometer Guralp CMG-6TD. The distance between measurements was about 200 meters, covering an area around 40 km2. There have been 6 significant peak frequencies between 0.3 Hz and 5 Hz. It was possible to find interesting areas with similar spectral peaks that coincide with zones with similar microgravimetric anomalies at the alluvial valley. It is also observed a decrease in the frequency peaks from West to East suggesting increased sediment layer. We also compute the soil models at those sites where geotechnical information is available, assuming that the seismic noise is diffuse. We invert the HVSR for these places using horizontally layered models and in the imaginary part the Green functions at the source. It is observed that the S wave velocity inverted models are consistent with the known geotechnical information obtained from drilled boreholes. We identify the elastodynamic properties of the limestone-dolomite materials with a formation of phyllites and quartzite that form the basement of the depression, and those properties of the Miocene and Pliocene detrital deposits (marls, sandy silts, sands and conglomerates) that fill the valley. These results together with the observed resonant frequencies along the Andarax\n\nHigh pressure breakdown of antigorite to spinifex-textured olivine and orthopyroxene, SE Spain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTrommsdorff, V.; SÃ¡nchez-VizcaÃ­no, V. LÃ³pez; GÃ³mez-Pugnaire, M. T.; MÃ¼ntener, O.\n\nThe prograde, high pressure, transition from antigorite serpentinite to enstatite-olivine rock occurs along a tectonically undisturbed profile at Cerro del Almirez, SE Spain. The reactant assemblage is antigorite + olivine with tremolite rimming precursor diopside. The product assemblage of tremolite + chlorite + enstatite + olivine has a spinifex-like texture with arborescent or radiating olivine elongated parallel to [001] and with radially grown enstatite. Product enstatite is very poor in Al2O3. Due to numerous oriented submicroscopic inclusions of chromian magnetite, product olivine has a brownish pleochroism and a bulk chromium content similar to precursor antigorite. Titanian clinohumite with a fluorine content of 0.45-0.50 wt% persisted beyond the breakdown of antigorite. The partitioning of iron and magnesium amongst the silicate phases is almost identical to that at lower pressures. Average Kd values Mn/Mg and Ni/Mg are 0.17 and 0.70 for antigorite-olivine pairs and 1.83 and 0.22 for orthopyroxene-olivine pairs, respectively. These data are useful in discriminating generations of olivine grown on each other. From the field data a phase diagram topology for a portion of the system CaO-MgO-SiO2-H2O is derived. This topology forms the basis for extrapolations into inaccessible P-T regions.\n\nSeismic microzonation and velocity models of El Ejido area (SE Spain) from the diffuse-field H/V method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcÃ­a-Jerez, Antonio; Seivane, Helena; Navarro, Manuel; PiÃ±a-Flores, JosÃ©; LuzÃ³n, Francisco; Vidal, Francisco; Posadas, Antonio M.; Aranda, Carolina\n\n2016-04-01\n\nEl Ejido town is located in the Campo de DalÃ­as coastal plain (AlmerÃ­a province, SE Spain), emplaced in one of the most seismically active regions of Spain. The municipality has 84000 inhabitants and presented a high growth rate during the last twenty years. The most recent intense seismic activity occurred close to this town was in 1993 and 1994, with events of Mb = 4.9 and Mb = 5.0, respectively. To provide a basis for site-specific hazard analysis, we first carried out a seismic microzonation of this town in terms of predominant periods and geotechnical properties. The predominant periods map was obtained from ambient noise observations on a grid of 250 x 250 m in the main urban area, and sparser measurements on the outskirts. These broad-band records, of about 20 minutes long each, were analyzed by using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique (H/V). Dispersion curves obtained from two array measurements of ambient noise and borehole data provided additional geophysical information. All the surveyed points in the town were found to have relatively long predominant periods ranging from 0.8 to 2.3 s and growing towards the SE. Secondary high-frequency (> 2Hz) peaks were found at about the 10% of the points only. On the other hand, Vs30 values of 550 - 650 m/s were estimated from the array records, corresponding to cemented sediments and medium-hard rocks. The local S-wave velocity structure has been inverted from the H/V curves for a subset of the measurement sites. We used an innovative full-wavefield method based on the diffuse-wavefield approximation (SÃ¡nchez-Sesma et al., 2011) combined with the simulated annealing algorithm. Shallow seismic velocities and deep boreholes data were used as constraints. The results show that the low-frequency resonances are related with the impedance contrast between several hundred meters of medium-hard sedimentary rocks (marls and calcarenites) with the stiffer basement of the basin, which dips to the SE.

In this work, we show for the first time, the continuing tectonic activity of the CFZ and quantify its geodetic slip-rates using continuous and campaign GPS observations conducted during the last decade. We find that the left-lateral motion dominates the kinematics of the CFZ, with a strike-slip rate of 1.3 Â± 0.2 mm/yr along the N48Â° direction. The shortening component is significantly lower and poorly constrained. Recent onshore and offshore paleoseismic and geomorphic results across the CFZ suggest a minimum Late Pleistocene to present-day strike-slip rate of 1.1 mm/yr. Considering the similarity of the geologic and geodetic slip rates measured at different points along the fault, the northern segment of the CFZ must have been slipping approximately at a constant rate during the Quaternary. Regarding the eastern Alpujarras fault zone corridor (AFZ), located to the north of the CFZ, our GPS measurements corroborate that this zone is active and exhibits a right-lateral motion. These opposite type strike-slip motion across the AFZ and CFZ is a result of a push-type force due to Nubia and Eurasia plate convergence, which, in turn, causes the westward escape of the block bounded by these two fault zones.\n\nTemporal effects of post-fire check dam construction on soil functionality in SE Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-Romero, J; Lucas-Borja, M E; Plaza-Ãlvarez, P A; Sagra, J; Moya, D; De Las Heras, J\n\n2018-06-09\n\nWildfire has historically been an alteration factor in Mediterranean basins. Despite Mediterranean ecosystems' high resilience, wildfire accelerates erosion and degradation processes, and also affects soil functionality by affecting nutrient cycles and soil structure. In semi-arid Mediterranean basins, check dams are usually built in gullies and channels after fire as a measure against soil erosion. Although check dams have proven efficient action to reduce erosion rates, studies about how they affect soil functionality are lacking. Our approach focuses on how soil functionality, defined as a combination of physico-chemical and biological indicators, is locally affected by check dam construction and the evolution of this effect over time. Soils were sampled in eight check dams in two semi-arid areas at SE Spain, which were affected by wildfire in 2012 and 2016. The study findings reveal that by altering sediments cycle and transport, check dams influence soil's main physico-chemical and biochemical characteristics. Significant differences were found between check dam-affected zones and the control ones for many indicators such as organic matter content, electrical conductivity or enzymatic activity. According to the ANOVA results, interaction between check dams influence and time after fire, was a crucial factor. PCA results clearly showed check-dams influence on soil functionality.

The Quaternary sedimentary deposits of this basin are mainly endoreic lacustrine carbonate and alluvial deposits, developed in a semi-arid climate (Pleistocene-present). The basin is a NW-SE-elongated graben bounded by a major right-lateral oblique-fault, the Pozohondo Fault. This fault trends NW-SE, with an approximate trace of 55 km, and is composed of various segments which are identified by fault scarps. In order to establish the slip-rate of the most active segment of the Pozohondo Fault, called the Cordovilla segment, we carried out a detailed study of the affected Quaternary lacustrine deposits. We found that the lacustrine facies could be related to episodic moderate paleoearthquakes. The slip-rate is calculated to be 0.05 and 0.09 mm/yr, using radiometric dating for the vertical offsets of the lacustrine facies. A trenching study at the northern part of the Cordovilla segment revealed two events caused by paleoearthquakes, with the most recent expressed as an oblique-fault off-setting a poorly-developed soil. The magnitude of the last event was greater than 6, using various empirical relationships for the fault displacement and the surface-length rupture. We estimate episodic activity across the Cordovilla segment, to be characterized by moderate-sized paleoearthquakes (M6), which is in agreement with the tectonic context of an intraplate zone of the Iberian plate. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.\n\nAcoustic Detection, Behavior, and Habitat Use of Deep-Diving Odontocetes\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2011-09-22\n\nde Estudios de Biologia Marina.

Mar Menor coastal lagoon is one of the largest lagoons of the Mediterranean Sea, placed in SE Spain and subjected to major human impacts, in particular the mining of metal sulphides. As a consequence, metal concentration in water column and sediments of this ecosystem is usually higher than in other areas. For monitoring ecosystem health, the present study has assessed the ability of Cotylorhiza tuberculata for bioaccumulating metals from sea water. Up to 65 individuals were sampled at 8 different sampling stations during the summer of 2012. Although the concentration values for different elements considered were moderate (Pb: 0.04-29.50 ppm, Zn: 2.27-93.44 ppm, Cd: 0-0.67 ppm, As: 0.56-130.31 ppm) by dry weight of the jellyfish tissues (bell and oral arms combined), bioconcentration levels in relation to seawater metal concentration were extremely high. In any case, the use or disposal of these organisms should consider their metal content because of their potential environmental and health implications.\n\nBiophysical and socioeconomic impacts of soil and water conservation measures. An evaluation of Sustainable Land Management in SE Spain.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Vente, J.; SolÃ©-Benet, A.; LÃ³pez, J.; Boix-Fayos, C.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIn close collaboration with stakeholders promising soil and water conservation measures were selected as part of the EU funded DESIRE project. These measures were monitored for nearly three years at an experimental farm in the upper Guadalentin (SE-Spain). Four Sustainable Land Management (SLM) measures were implemented on rainfed almonds: a) reduced tillage, b) green manure, c) straw mulch, d) traditional water harvesting. A fifth measure (e) reduced tillage of cereals, was compared to conventional mouldboard tillage. Here, we present monitoring results according to biophysical and socioeconomic criteria. SLM measures a, b and e, aim to reduce soil and water loss through runoff. Therefore, for each measure three replica erosion-runoff plots and a control plot were installed to monitor soil and water loss and soil moisture content at two depths. SLM measures c and d aim to increase soil water content by preventing soil evaporation and adding additional water by water harvesting respectively. In these fields, the volume of harvested water was registered and soil water content was monitored. In all experiments, farm operation costs and crop harvest were monitored as well. In the almond fields, green manure and reduced tillage significantly reduced soil and water loss as compared to the control plot with normal tillage operations. Also for the cereal field, results show lower erosion rates under reduced tillage as compared to traditional tillage operation. In two successive years, the highest almond harvest was found in the field with water harvesting (d), followed by the green manure field (b), though no significant differences were found in soil water content with their control plots. Mulching did not show a significant effect on soil water content or harvest. Four of the selected SLM options showed a positive effect on the protection of soil and water resources, and were beneficial for crop yield. Whereas, reduced tillage also results in lower production costs, the\n\n2nd Iberian Nuclear Astrophysics Meeting on Compact Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPerez-Garcia, M.

This volume contains most of the presentations delivered at this international workshop. This meeting was the second in the series following the previous I Encuentro IbÃ©rico de Compstar, held at the University of Coimbra, Portugal in 2010. The main purpose of this meeting was to strengthen the scientific collaboration between the participants of the Iberian and the rest of the southern European branches of the European Nuclear Astrophysics network, formerly, COMPSTAR. This ESF (European Science Foundation) supported network has been crucial in helping to make a broader audience for the the most interesting and relevant research lines being developed currently in Nuclear Astrophysics, especially related to the physics of neutron stars. It is indeed important to emphasize the need for a collaborative approach to the rest of the scientific communities so that we can reach possible new members in this interdisciplinary area and as outreach for the general public. The program of the meeting was tailored to theoretical descriptions of the physics of neutron stars although some input from experimental observers and other condensed matter and optics areas of interest was also included. The main scientific topics included: Magnetic fields in compact stars Nuclear structure and in-medium effects in nuclear interaction Equation of state: from nuclear matter to quarks Importance of crust in the evolution of neutron stars Computational simulations of collapsing dense objects Observational phenomenology In particular, leading\n\nFlowstones from SE Spain document a close relationship between North Atlantic temperature and precipitation in the Western Mediterranean between 7 and 112 ka\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBudsky, Alexander; Scholz, Denis; Mertz-Kraus, Regina; SpÃ¶tl, Christoph; Gibert, Luis; Jochum, Klaus Peter\n\n2017-04-01\n\nHere we present three flowstone records from Cueva Victoria, SE Spain, covering the period between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 and MIS 3, the Late Glacial and the Holocene. The flowstones were precisely dated by the MC-ICPMS 230Th/U-method. In addition, stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios as well as trace element concentrations were determined at high resolution (centennial to decadal scale). Present-day climate of SE Spain is classified as semi-arid with dry summer months (<10 mm/month precipitation) and sparsely developed vegetation. A large dataset of 230Th/U ages on several flowstones from Cueva Victoria indicates preferential flowstone growth during warm phases (i.e., interglacials as well as warm interstadials), whereas flowstone growth is interrupted during glacial phases (Budsky et al., 2015). One of the drill cores shows more or less continuous flowstone growth between the Last Interglacial (MIS 5) and MIS 3 (112 - 46 ka). A flowstone from another part of the cave only records the time span from 86 to 50 ka including several growth interruptions. However, both flowstones cover the transition from MIS 4 to 3 including D/O events 17 to 13 at high resolution. Each D/O event is reflected by a remarkable decrease in both Î´18O and Î´13C values (both up to 3â° ) accompanied by decreasing concentrations of Mg and Sr. In particular, longer D/O events, lasting several thousands of years (e.g., D/O 14, 19, 20 and 21), are well represented in the Î´18O and Î´13C records. The timing is in good agreement with the NGRIP ice core and sea-surface temperatures from the Iberian margin. Î´18O values are around -3.5 â° and decrease to -5 to -6 â° during D/O events, while Î´13C values are around -9 â° and decrease to -10 to -11 â° ) during D/O events. We interpret these changes as more humid conditions during D/O events, with elevated sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea leading to increased moisture transport and precipitation on\n\nLand Use Change and Land Degradation in Southeastern Mediterranean Spain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSymeonakis, Elias; Calvo-Cases, Adolfo; Arnau-Rosalen, Eva\n\n2007-07-01\n\nThe magnitude of the environmental and social consequences of soil erosion and land degradation in semiarid areas of the Mediterranean region has long been recognized and studied. This paper investigates the interrelationship between land use/cover (LULC) changes and land degradation using remotely sensed and ancillary data for southeastern Spain. The area of study, the XalÃ³ River catchment situated in the north of the Alicante Province, has been subjected to a number of LULC changes during the second half of the 20th century such as agricultural abandonment, forest fires, and tourist development. Aerial photographs dating back to 1956 were used for the delineation of historic LULC types; Landsat ETM+ data were used for the analysis and mapping of current conditions. Two important indicators of land degradation, namely, susceptibility to surface runoff and soil erosion, were estimated for the two dates using easily parametrizable models. The comparison of 1956 to 2000 conditions shows an overall ârecuperatingâ trend over the catchment and increased susceptibility to soil erosion only in 3% of the catchment area. The results also identify potential degradation hot-spots where mitigation measures should be taken to prevent further degradation. The readily implemented methodology, based on modest data requirements demonstrated by this study, is a useful tool for catchment to regional scale land use change and land degradation studies and strategic planning for environmental management.\n\nLand use change and land degradation in southeastern Mediterranean Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nSymeonakis, Elias; Calvo-Cases, Adolfo; Arnau-Rosalen, Eva\n\n2007-07-01\n\nThe magnitude of the environmental and social consequences of soil erosion and land degradation in semiarid areas of the Mediterranean region has long been recognized and studied.

Incidencia de las explotaciones de las desaladoras de alicante I Y II Y medidas correctoras\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nManteca, Ivan Alhama\n\nThe Agua Amarga coastal aquifer, located in the south of Alicante province, has been subjected to successive anthropogenic actions: salt works activity (1925-1975) and water withdrawal to supply the Alicante I and II desalination plants (since 2003). These interventions have influenced the salinity and the flow regime. Due to the existence of a salt marsh of ecological interest linked to the aquifer, the 'Mancomunidad de los Canales del Taibilla' (agency responsible for the desalination plants) designed a piezometric network for monitoring piezometry and electrical conductivity (in operation since May 2008). Soil humidity and piezometrics levels have been recovered by means of a seawater pouring programme over the salt marsh (since December 2009),which represents the third anthropic intervention. In this memoria, we investigate the Agua Amarga coastal aquifer to develop a physical conceptual model. Firstly, the study area is characterized in relation to climatology, geology, geomorphology and hydrogeology, using published information, describing, in addition, the desalination plants catchment system. Next, based on hydrogeological studies prior to the start up of the desalination plants, the aquifer is characterized: type, lithology, hydraulic parameters, thickness, surface extension, etc. Water quantity relating to rainfall, water withdrawal and pourings over the salt marsh, have been integrated in conjunction with data from monthly piezometric campaigns. In adittion, in order to gain insight into the groundwater mixing processes, chemical and isotope analyses were carried out on meteoric water and groundwater samples taken at different locations. The results were used to elaborate a conceptual physical model and a water budget. As an extension tool to understand processes and assess aquifer management, a 3-D fluid-flow and solute-transport model is designed with SEAWAT. Also, the 2-D physical characterization of scenarios with seawater intrusion and salt flats is\n\nInfluence of local and regional Mediterranean meteorology on SOâ ground-level concentrations in SE Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantacatalina, Milagros; CarratalÃ¡, AdoraciÃ³n; Mantilla, Enrique\n\n2011-06-01\n\nThis work presents the results of a 4-year study on sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) ground-level concentrations in an area of southeastern Spain, the L'AlacantÃ­ region, where the cement industry is important and coke use extends to other industries as well. The main source of SO(2) emissions in the area was found to be a the Lepold cement plant (one of the two cement plants in the area). The high levels of SO(2) probably extend back to 1920 when this plant began operations. Both local and Mediterranean-scale meteorological processes influence the SO(2) ground-level concentration and together explain the dispersion dynamics of this pollutant. The location and topography of the study zone result in NW Atlantic advections and E-SE sea breezes being the dominant atmospheric circulation patterns in the area. Under stable meteorological conditions, minor local circulations are also relevant to the SO(2) concentration levels. The high frequency of local circulations determines a concentration pattern that changes during the day, with impacts occurring preferentially in a W-NW direction from the source at midday (sea breeze and strong thermal mixture), and in a SE direction at night. This causes the SO(2) concentrations to present well-defined diurnal cycles with well-differentiated shapes depending on the location of the sampling station relative to the source. The dependence of SO(2) 10 min levels on the wind origin and speed throughout the day has been evaluated by studying statistical parameters including P95, P50 and arithmetic mean. Exceedances occur under specific dispersion conditions at distances less than 1 km from the source. However, the source is traceable at larger distances and the levels are higher than typical urban ones. P95 was used as an estimator of the occurrence of larger levels or impacts. Leeward of NW winds and the source, at night and in early morning, P95 levels are comprised between 30 and 55 Âµg m(-3). In contrast, with SE winds and at midday, P95\n\nZn mobility and geochemistry in surface sulfide mining soils from SE Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcia, G; PeÃ±as, J M; Manteca, J I\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThe extraction of metallic minerals and the mineral dressing operations in concentrators produced a high impact in soils and sediments. Heavy metals in soils constitute a high risk of pollution, not only for mining areas, but also for agriculture and villages placed in subsidiary areas. This research has been focused on the assessment of the real environmental and health hazards of Zn in relation to geochemistry and metal mobility in surface soils from a mining area in SE Spain, under semiarid weather conditions. Mineralogy of the studied soils revealed major presence of quartz, but also of other silicates, sulfates, carbonates, and sulfides. Regarding Zn minerals, the presence of sphalerite as the main Zn sulfide, and of goslarite as Zn sulfate, and of smithsonite as Zn carbonate should be highlighted. Soil pH ranged between 4.4 and 4.9 and the electrical conductivity between 55 and 85 microS/cm. By using the sequential extraction procedure, the achieved results show that zinc is not only mainly associated to primary but also to secondary sulfides. Total concentration of the non-available fractions rises up to 98.45% of total Zn in the studied soils. On the other hand, available Zn fraction did not exceed more than 1.55% in percentage and less than 2000 ppm in absolute terms, and when referred to more easily available fraction (water-soluble and exchangeable fractions), these values are not more than 0.44% and then 800 ppm. Therefore, although there is a significant pollution level in this area, immediate hazard for the environment can be assessed as moderate. Finally it should be highlighted that these surface soils have undergone concentration processes of sphalerite, whose mechanisms should be related to the ascending flow of capillary water and the dragging of sphalerite crystals and Zn salts by electrokinetic and colloidal processes These processes seem to occur based on environmental pollution by wind and water erosion, and therefore directly associated to\n\nPrincipals' Metaphors as a Lens to Understand How They Perceive Leadership\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHernÃ¡ndez-AmorÃ³s, MarÃ­a J.; MartÃ­nez Ruiz, MarÃ­a A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA prolific number of researchers have chosen to study metaphorical narratives, confirming their usefulness in educational research.

From early to late Messinian (at least between 6.8 and 5.7 Ma), the Fortuna basin records the sedimentation of alluvial-palustrine deposits over a confined shallow basin. Changing environmental conditions in the latest Messinian are illustrated by the retreat of palustrine facies. A rapid progradation of the marginal clastic wedges and the initiation of an efficient basin drainage at Ë5.8 Ma (lower part of chron C3r) most likely represents the onshore response to the drastic drop of base level taking place during the Messinian salinity crisis. This study further provides improved age estimates for the late Turolian land mammal events in southern Spain. The oldest MN 13 locality in the studied sections is correlated to chron C3Ar at an age of 6.8 Ma. The entry of camels and the murid Paraethomys in southern Spain occurs in chron C3An.1n at 6.1 Ma, and gives further support for land mammal exchange between Africa and the Iberian peninsula prior to the salinity crisis, in good agreement with results from northern Africa [M. Benammi, M. Calvo, M. PrÃ©vot, J.J. Jaeger, Magnetostratigraphy and paleontology of AÄ±Ìt Kandoula basin (High Atlas, Morocco) and the African-European late Miocene terrestrial fauna exchanges, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 145 (1996) 15-29]. The age of the studied sequences provides important constraints on the understanding of the sedimentary evolution of the eastern Betic margin, and shows that previous interpretations of the evaporitic-diatomitic sequences of the Fortuna basin, as being coeval to the late Messinian salinity crisis in the Mediterranean, are not correct. The confinement leading to the emergence of the Fortuna basin occurred in the late Tortonian to earliest Messinian, similar to other intramontane basins in the Betics.

Moreover, the characterization of these environments from ecological, biochemical and microbiological perspectives has become a key focus for many research groups all over the world over the last 20 years. In countries such as Spain, there are several examples of coastal solar salterns (mainly on the Mediterranean coast) and inland solar salterns, from which sodium chloride is obtained for human consumption. However, studies focused on the characterization of inland solar salterns are scarce and both the archaeal diversity and the plant communities inhabiting these environments remain poorly described. Results Two of the inland solar salterns (termed Redonda and Penalva), located in the Alto VinalopÃ³ Valley (Alicante, Spain), were characterized regarding their geological and physico-chemical characteristics and their archaeal and botanical biodiversity. A preliminary eukaryotic diversity survey was also performed using saline water. The chemical characterization of the brine has revealed that the salted groundwater extracted to fill these inland solar salterns is thalassohaline. The plant communities living in this environment are dominated by Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) A.J. Scott, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (Moris) K. Koch, Suaeda vera Forsk. ex Gmelin (Amaranthaceae) and several species of Limonium (Mill) and Tamarix (L). Archaeal diversity was analyzed and compared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular phylogenetic techniques. Most of the sequences recovered from environmental DNA samples are affiliated with haloarchaeal genera such as Haloarcula, Halorubrum, Haloquadratum and Halobacterium, and with an unclassified member of the Halobacteriaceae. The eukaryote Dunaliella was also present in the samples. Conclusions To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first analysis centered on inland solar salterns located in the\n\nEffect of post-fire salvage logging treatments on micobiological properties of two different soils in the Povince of Alicante.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArcenegui, Victoria\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIt is well known that the natural wildfire regime in Mediterranean forests is greatly disturbed by human activities. Fire can induce temporal or permanent changes in the soil (see Certini, 2005) and can retard or compromise the recovery of the ecosystem afterwards. Changes in soil properties and the impact on soil functions depend mainly on the severity of the fires (Neary et al., 1999) and type of soil and weather during and after burning (Robichaud & Hungerford, 2000). Post-fire management can have an additional impact on the ecosystem; in some cases, even more severe than the fire. Post-fire salvage logging treatments are very frequently but its ecological impact is uncertain. Mainly because there are so many variables at play. A research has been done in \"Sierra de Mariola Natural Park\" in Alcoi (M) and ''Cabo de San Antonio'' in Javea (J), both in the Province of Alicante (E Spain). A big forest fire (>500 has) occurred in July 2012 and in September 2014 respectively. After fire, salvage logging (SL) treatment were done. In the first area (M), with a soil classified as Typic Xerorthent, extraction of the burned wood using heavy machinery was applied. In contrast, in the second area (J), a Rhodoxeralf soil, not heavy machinery was used. Plots for monitoring this effect were installed in both areas and in a similar nearby area where no treatment was done, and then used as control (C) for comparison. Soil samplings were done immediately after treatment and 4 years and two years in M site and J site respectively. We examined the effect of salvage logging on basal soil respiration (BSR), and microbial biomass carbon (Cmic). Our results showed that in site M four years after the treatment, the plots without treatment showed a much better improvement for the properties monitored. And not differences were found in site J after two years of monitoring. The impact of salvage logging was different depending on the soil type and the way to do the treatment.\n\nClimate change adaptation via targeted ecosystem service provision: a sustainable land management strategy for the Segura catchment (SE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZagaria, Cecilia; de Vente, Joris; Perez-Cutillas, Pedro\n\n2014-05-01\n\nTopical research investigating climate, land-use and management scenarios in the Segura catchment (SE Spain), depicts a landscape at high-risk of, quite literally, deserting agriculture. Land degradation in the semi-arid region of SE Spain is characterized by water shortage, high erosion rates and salinization, increasingly exacerbated by climatic changes, scarce vegetation cover and detrimental farming practices. Future climate scenarios predict increases in aridity, variability and intensity of rainfall events, leading to increasing pressure on scarce soil and water resources. This study conceptualized the impending crisis of agro-ecological systems of the Segura basin (18800 km2) as a crisis of ecosystem service deterioration. In light of existing land degradation drivers and future climate scenarios, the potential of Sustainable Land Management (SLM) strategies was evaluated to target three priority ecosystem services (water provision, sediment retention and carbon sequestration) as a means to achieve climate change adaptation and mitigation. A preceding thorough process of stakeholder engagement (as part of the EU funded DESIRE project) indicated five SLM technologies for potential implementation, all with a focus upon reducing soil erosion, increasing soil water holding capacity and soil organic matter content. These technologies have been tested for over four years in local experimental field plots, and have provided results on the local effects upon individual environmental parameters. Despite the growing emphasis witnessed in literature upon the context-specificity which characterizes adaptation solutions, the frequent analysis at the field scale is limited in both scope and utility. There is a need to investigate the effects of adaptive SLM solutions at wider, regional scales. Thus, this study modeled the cumulative effect of each of the five selected SLM technologies with InVEST, a spatial analyst tool designed for ecosystem service quantification and\n\nAn interview with Angela Nieto.

The majority of plants used in songbird breeding have medicinal properties in traditional human medicine (48 different uses); thus, another main goal was to show their relationships with human medical uses. We compiled a list of 97 plant species from 31 botanical families that are used to attract finches and identified 11 different use categories for these plants in finch keeping. The most common uses were for trapping birds and as a source of food for birds in captivity. Cannabis sativa has the greatest cultural importance index (CI = 1.158), and Phalaris canariensis (annual canary grass or alpist) was the most common species used to attract Fringillidae and was used by all informants (n = 158). Most of the 97 species are wild plants and mainly belong to the families Compositae, Gramineae, Cruciferae, and Rosaceae and also have medicinal properties for humans. In the study area, the intensification of agriculture and abandonment of traditional management practices have caused the population of many songbirds to decline, as well as the loss of popular ethnographic knowledge.

We applied these techniques to study microbial recovery in post-fire forest soils. The recovery of forest ecosystems following severe fire is influenced by post-fire management. The removal of burnt tree stumps (salvage logging) is a common practice in Spain following fire. In some cases, the use of heavy machinery in addition to the vulnerability of soils to erosion and degradation make this management potentially damaging to soil, and therefore to the ecosystem. We hypothesized that tree removal slows down the recovery of soil biological communities including microbial and plant communities and contributes to soil degradation in the burnt affected area. The study area is located in \"Sierra de Mariola Natural Park\" in Alcoi, Alicante (E Spain). A big forest fire (>500 has) occurred in July 2012. The forest is composed mainly of Pinus halepensis trees with an understory of typical Mediterranean shrubs species such as Quercus coccifera, Rosmarinus officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, Brachypodium retusum, etc. Soil is classified as a Typic Xerorthent (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) developed over marls. In February 2013, salvage logging (SL) treatment, with a complete extraction of the burned wood using heavy machinery, was applied to a part of the affected forest. Plots for monitoring the effects of SL were installed in this area and in a similar nearby control (C) area, where no SL treatment was done. The recovery of soil bacterial and fungal communities post-fire with and without tree removal was analysed by using Next-Generation sequencing and the abundance of functional genes, related to nitrogen cycling, in the soil was estimated using quantitative PCR (qPCR).
