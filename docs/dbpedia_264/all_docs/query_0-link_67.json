The sources of this imprecision, using flavonoids as an example, include the variability of bioactive compounds in foods due to differences in growing conditions and processing, the challenges in laboratory quantification of flavonoids in foods, the incompleteness of flavonoid food composition tables, and the lack of adequate dietary assessment instruments. Steps to improve databases of bioactive compounds and to increase the accuracy and precision of the estimation of bioactive compound intakes in studies of health benefits and outcomes are suggested.\n\nKeywords: chemical analysis, databases, dietary assessment, dietary intakes, dietary supplements, flavonoids, food composition, food processing, phytochemicals, proanthocyanidins\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFlavonoids are bioactive, polyphenolic, non-nutrients in plants1,2 that are ubiquitous in diets.3–5 shows the major classes of flavonoids commonly found in plant foods. lists some common food sources of the various flavonoid classes and references figures illustrating some of these ( and Figures S1–S3, which are available in the Supporting Information for this article online).6–11 Although there are thousands of flavonoids found in nature, only several dozen are common in foods. Emerging science from some observational and metabolic studies suggests that flavonoid-rich diets may lower the risk of some diet-related chronic degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers,12–16 but a few clinical and laboratory reports indicate that very high doses of certain flavonoids may have adverse effects, such as interference with common medications and, for some green tea extracts, liver toxicity.17–24 Therefore, it is important to accurately assess flavonoid intakes from the perspectives of both disease prevention and safety.25–29 Adverse effects and safety issues, however, are beyond the scope of this article.\n\nTable 1\n\nFlavonoid class (compounds)Common plant sources (botanical families)Anthocyanidins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, petunidin)Blueberries (Ericaceae), red wine (Vitaceae), strawberries (Rosaceae).

It explores some possible sources of flavonoid intake misestimation in these studies, including the variability of flavonoids in foods due to differences in growing conditions and processing, the challenges in laboratory quantification of flavonoids in foods, the incompleteness of flavonoid food composition tables, and the lack of adequate dietary assessment tools. It concludes with steps scientists can take to improve databases, reduce methodological misestimations, and increase the accuracy and precision of studies assessing the associations between flavonoids and health outcomes. This article does not address reporting requirements for studies of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids or the many pitfalls that must be avoided in experimental and clinical studies. These issues are covered in a recent article30 documenting reporting requirements by the International Life Sciences Institute Bioactive Committee31 using the CONSORT framework developed32–33 and endorsed by leading researchers here and abroad.\n\nFLAVONOID INTAKES IN EUROPEAN AND US COHORTS\n\n3,4,34–58 reports flavonoid intakes based on means and medians from recent US, European, and Australian cohort and population-based studies of adults. Only studies that measured intakes of proanthocyanidins6,59 (condensed tannins, ) and at least 4 monomeric flavonoid classes were included (indicating that more complete flavonoid data were used). As seen in , intake estimates varied greatly across cohorts by country. Since flavonoid intake distributions are usually skewed to the right, mean intakes tended to be higher than median intakes. When proanthocyanidins, particularly the thearubigins60 (derived tannins; see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information for this article available online), were not measured, total flavonoid intakes were usually lower by at least a third. Note that, in , values in boldface indicate thearubigins were included; in the remaining studies, these compounds were excluded.\n\nTable 2\n\nCountryYearCohortSexNo.Diet methodDatabases usedaTotal flavonoidsb (mg per day)Monomeric flavonoidsb (mg per day)ReferenceMeansAustralia2013CIFOARESF1063FFQf2007 i2008, PE775560Ivey et al.

Despite these variable approaches to measuring diet and assessing flavonoid intakes, some generalizations are possible. First, the range of mean total flavonoid intakes between and within these Australian, European, and US adult populations was wide, from 209 to 1017 mg/d (mean 435 mg/d). The highest mean intake (1017 mg/d) was reported in studies by Knaze et al.39 and Zamora-Ros et al.46–49 for a British cohort, and the lowest mean intake (209 mg/d) reported was for the National Findiet cohort.41 Both of these studies used a single 24-hour recall, which may be too short in duration to reflect usual diets and may have captured unrepresentative (outlier) days that do not reflect usual diets.61 Four studies35,40,44,45 provided means and medians for many of the flavonoid classes, and 3 of these provided mean and median total flavonoid intakes. The median total intakes in these 3 studies were 44 mg/d, 57 mg/d, and 66 mg/d, lower than the means reported, illustrating that estimates tend to be skewed to the right (Table S1).\n\nSecond, the flavonoids consumed in the greatest amounts in these studies were the polymeric proanthocyanidins (ranging from 48 to 706 mg/d, with a mean of 242 mg/d). Proanthocyanidins were rarely included in studies before 2004,62 when a provisional database on the proanthocyanidin content of foods first became available.58,59,63–65 In these recent studies, the mean total intake of the monomeric flavonoid classes was 193 mg/d (range, 83–560 mg/d). Intakes of the monomeric flavonoids in these studies were as follows: flavan-3-ols, 102 mg/d (range, 12–431 mg/d); flavanones, 34 mg/d (range, 13–53 mg/d); anthocyanidins, 27 mg/d (range, 3–59 mg/d); flavonols, 27 mg/d (range, 5–52 mg/d); flavones, 5 mg/d (range, 0.2–34 mg/d); and isoflavones 1 mg/day (range, 0.1–5 mg/d) (Table S1).\n\nThird, it should be noted that mean isoflavone intakes of individuals in these European and US cohorts (<2 mg/d) differed strikingly from intakes reported in studies of Asian populations (≈26 mg/d).66–69 Mean intakes of other classes of flavonoids appear to be more similar among European,35,36,38,39,41,42,44,46–49 US,3,4,34,40,43 and possibly Asian populations.70–74 However, very few Asian studies70–74 have measured intakes of the other flavonoid classes, and none appear to have included proanthocyanidins. It is not known whether intakes from other classes of flavonoids differ between Asian and Western populations.13,75\n\nFourth, even the highest flavonoid intake levels for individual compounds or classes in these cohorts were typically lower than those in intervention studies that have achieved clinical effects.76 For example the dose used in most intervention studies exceeded the usual intakes from diets by ≈3- to 15-fold.77–83 In the recent FLAVURS intervention study, doses ranging from 20 to 70 mg flavonoids over baseline flavonoid intake levels (that were stated to be low but not reported) showed some effects on microvascular reactivity.84\n\nPOSSIBLE REASONS FOR ACROSS-STUDY VARIATIONS IN ESTIMATED FLAVONOID INTAKE\n\nFlavonoid intakes vary greatly within and between populations, owing not only to real differences in intakes85 but also to other causes of variability. These variations may lead to inconsistent associations with health outcomes.12,86–95 Sources of variability include the variability of plants themselves, the methods of processing plant foods for consumption, the chemical analyses used to measure the flavonoids present, and the completeness of flavonoid databases. In addition, inadequate dietary assessment tools can cause variability between studies. Each source of misestimation is discussed in greater detail below.\n\nInherent variability of flavonoid content in plants\n\nA plant’s capacity to produce flavonoids varies intrinsically by its genus, species, family, and even within subspecies and cultivars or varieties.96–101 Most plants contain more than one class of flavonoids. shows some particularly rich sources (e.g., total flavonoids ≥50 mg/serving) common in US diets,102 including apples, blueberries, dark chocolate, grapefruit juice, grapes, oranges, pears, red wine, strawberries, and tea (black, black decaffeinated, and green). Variability in flavonoid content, even within the same family, genus, and species, occurs because flavonoids are secondary metabolites produced in varying amounts in response to stressors such as invading microorganisms, insects, plant diseases, season, climate, geography, or other environmental influences.103–110\n\nTable 3\n\nFoodServingTotal flavonoids (mg per serving)Total flavonoids (mg per 100 g)Anthocyanins (mg per 100 g)Flavonols (mg per 100 g)Flavones (mg per 100 g)Isoflavones (mg per 100 g)Flavanones (mg per 100 g)Flavan-3-ols (mg per 100 g)Proanthocyanidins (mg per 100 g)GenusSpeciesBotanical familyBeverages Tea, blackb1 c (8 fl oz)31513340028101CamelliasinensisTheaceae Tea, decaffeinated blackb1 c (8 fl oz)1375850350CamelliasinensisTheaceae Tea, greenb1 c (8 fl oz)3391435001327CamelliasinensisTheaceae Wine, red5 fl oz serving141961920.20.0121162VitisviniferaVitaceaeFruit Apples1 medium218120240.1009105MalusdomesticaRosaceae Blueberries1 c fresh529357163110.2007176VacciniumaugustifoliumEricaceae Grapefruit juice1 c54220.40021CitrusX paradisiRutaceae GrapefruitWhite, 0.5 medium2822000.17220CitrusX paradisiRutaceae GrapesRed, 1 c fresh14411448110262VitisviniferaVitaceae Orange juice1 c371500.300.1114CitrussinensisRutaceae Oranges1 medium574310.204300CitrussinensisRutaceae Pears1 medium664021000532PyruscommunisRosaceae Raisins1 sm box, 1.5 oz0.410.050.30.010.1010VitisviniferaVitaceae Strawberries1 c fresh halves258175272000.265142Fragaria× ananassaRosaceaeCandy, nuts, soy Dark chocolate0.5 bar (1.75 oz)14428753234TheobromacacaoMalvaceae Milk chocolate0.5 bar (1.75 oz)8416715152TheobromacacaoMalvaceae Peanuts1 c halves & whole121600000116ArachishypogaeaFabaceae Walnuts0.5 c pieces or chips42703000.030067JuglansregiaJuglandaceae Soy milk1 c241010GlycinemaxFabaceae Soy tofu0.5 c tofu firm40321031GlycinemaxFabaceaeVegetables Broccoli0.5 c chopped, cooked91201110000Brassicaoleracea var. italicaBrassicaceae Celery1 c chopped, raw550140000Apiumgraveolens var. dulceApiaceae Garlic clove1 clove0.1440.1AlliumsativumAmaryllidaceae Garlic powder1 tsp powder0.3880.2AlliumsativumAmaryllidaceae Onion as garnish1 medium slice426260.03000Alliumcepa var cepaAmaryllidaceae Onion as vegetable0.5 c raw2126260.03000Alliumcepa var cepaAmaryllidaceae Pepper, green1 medium87025000CapsicumannuumSolanaceae Spinach, raw1 c raw31111100SpinaciaoleraceaChenopodiaceaeSquash0.5 c mashed, cooked11100CucurbitamaximaCucurbitaceae Tomato sauce0.5 c111LycopersiconesculentumSolanaceae Tomato1 medium fresh210100100LycopersiconesculentumSolanaceae\n\nAnimals do not synthesize flavonoids. The few flavonoids present in animal foods are usually due to the animal’s diet (e.g., isoflavones in milk due to alfalfa, clover, other Fabaceae plants, and soy meal eaten by cows)111 or to processing.11\n\nFlavonoids in foods are often conjugated with gallates, glycosides, or methoxy groups (Figures S4–S6 available in the Supporting Information online), which may affect bioavailability.112–116 Although plant genera and species differ in the specific aglycones, sugars, and the amount of compounds that are present (which are affected in turn by the degree of ripeness and other environmental factors),9,117–122 each genus and species is fairly consistent in the type and amount of one or more “signature” flavonoid classes it contains. For example, blueberries101 are rich in anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins, dark chocolate123,124 is rich in flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins, and citrus125,126 is rich in flavanones. This considerable variability in food flavonoid content, even within specific species and varieties, cannot be entirely eliminated. For example, in the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) databases, the mean (weighted by number of data points), number of data points, standard error of the mean, minimum value from data points, maximum value from data points, and confidence estimate for the quality of the data, along with sources of data, are all provided for each item and compound. As databases grow to include more and better flavonoid analyses, the variability of estimated values should decrease, improving precision in measuring intakes.\n\nProcessing of foods\n\nFlavonoid content is also affected by food processing. Ignoring processing losses leads to overestimates of food flavonoid content. Processing losses depend on the individual flavonoid and its chemical properties, the food and its matrix, and the processing method used.127–144 Milling (particularly for grains) often removes flavonoids.145–147 Boiling may leach flavonoids into water that is discarded, decreasing the flavonoid content.127,148 Microwaving, freezing, and frying appear to have less effect on flavonoid content.127,131,149–152 Juicing may increase the citrus flavonoid content, if the processing techniques that are used extract flavonoids from the peel and deposit them into the juice.144,153,154\n\nDatabases sometimes provide data only on the raw food item because that is what was analyzed. Now, the USDA’s Nutrient Data Laboratory and the Food Composition and Methods Development Laboratory155 and scientists compiling Phenol-Explorer156 are providing flavonoid “retention factors” that account for common processing techniques for foods and flavonoids so that food tables in the future will contain improved food flavonoid composition estimates for both raw and cooked items by type of cooking method.\n\nAlthough a detailed discussion of the influence of food preparation and processing methods on flavonoid values is outside the scope of this article, it is important to mention that the lack of quantitative data on non-nutrient bioactive compounds such as flavonoids in processed foods potentially lessens the ability to detect associations between flavonoid intakes and health outcomes.8 Dekker and Verkirk157 investigated the data on bioactive glucosinolates from the broccoli family (Brassicaceae). With the data and computer modeling, they estimated that, if information about home preparation of foods was quantified, the statistical power of a study could at least be doubled.157 If all variation of the food production chain could be accounted for, a study’s statistical power could be increased by a factor of 5.\n\nFor the flavonoids, values are needed for processed foods such as cereals, breads, and crackers. This might improve the estimated relative risks observed in studies of flavonoids and health.\n\nVarying precision of chemical analyses used to determine flavonoid content\n\nUntil recently, the gaps that existed in food composition data were major impediments to accurate estimation of flavonoid intake. Today, better chemical analytic methods are available and databases are more complete, with duplicate analyses of more compounds and a wider variety of foods, including cooked and processed items.\n\nThe laboratory methods used to determine flavonoid content affect the precision and accuracy of the values in and the quality of databases.158 The analytical methods for measuring flavonoids involve extraction, separation, characterization (i.e., detection and identification), and quantification. Newer extraction methods reduce the amount of solvent used as well as flavonoid losses due to degradation. Although solvent extraction systems are effective, no single extraction or separation system is suitable for all the flavonoid compounds in any one class or group of classes because of differences in polarity among individual compounds.1,159,160\n\nAcid hydrolysis is used for reliable identification of aglycones because mass spectroscopy fragmentation may not identify some similar flavonoids. It also separates the O-glycosides (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information online), which are easily hydrolyzed from C-glycosides (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information online), which are not hydrolyzed.161 Alkaline (basic) hydrolysis is used to determine where an acyl group (acetyl, malonyl, p-coumaryl, etc.) is attached to a sugar (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information online).1,160,162–166 High-performance liquid chromatography is the most robust method for separation and quantification, and better separation is now available using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography. Ultraviolet detection, fluorimetry (for flavonoids with natural fluorescence), and mass spectroscopy are used for characterization and quantification.\n\nMass spectroscopy can determine the following: 1) molecular mass (and, if high-resolution mass spectroscopy is used,162 even more accurate identification of a compound’s molecular formula and structure is possible); 2) structure of the aglycone (pattern of hydroxylation, attachment of ring B to ring C [see ]); 3) information about acylation of sugar hydroxyl groups and possible methylation or sulfation of aglycone hydroxyl(s); and 4) the number and the configuration of sugars and, sometimes, the glycosidic bond positions. However, mass spectroscopy does not provide information about the stereochemistry of the glycosidic linkage or distinguish between diastereomeric sugar units, even though such characteristics may be important for biological activity.167 Mass spectroscopy can be used to quantify monomeric flavonoids in foods but not polymeric proanthocyanidins because the number and similarity of all their isomers, both structurally and in mass spectroscopy fragmentation, is so great.160,168–171\n\n1,125,146,159–162,165–220 summarizes some of the preferred analytical methods used today. Particular analytical challenges remain for each flavonoid class,216,217,221–223 including the lack of standards for many individual flavonoid compounds in foods and the cost of developing and using standards. The quantification difficulties involving flavonoids are being resolved with the use of one standard for several similar compounds,173,217,219 mass spectroscopy extractable chromatogram methods,216 and ultraviolet molar relative response factors.160,169 When evaluating the chemical data on foods and plants in the literature for inclusion in databases, database developers must determine if the analytical methods used were appropriate.\n\nTable 4\n\nFlavonoid classExtractionHydrolysisSeparationIdentificationQuantificationCommentsAnthocyanidins146,162,165,170,171,173,177,179,202,217–219Acidic alcoholic such as methanol/water/acetic acid 85:15:0.5 v/vSugars present, but hydrolysis not usually done due to rearrangement and degradationRP-HPLC: Binary elution usually either 1) aqueous 5% formic acid and methanol or 2) water-formic acid, 9:1 (v/v), and acetonitrile formic acid 9:1 (v/v)UV maxima 265–275 and 465–560 nm.

C-glycosides are not appreciably acid hydrolyzed, and no glycosidase is yet known to hydrolyze carbon-carbon linked sugarsRP-HPLC: Binary eluant usually water with 1% formic acid, 0.01% trifluoracetic acid, or 10% acetic acid and acetonitrile with the same acid and percentageUV maxima 240–280 and 300–380 nm. Fluorimetry (more sensitive) used for some flavonols.

The major drawback of acid hydrolysis is isomerization of unsymmetrically substituted flavones (e.g., vitexin and isovitexin, Figure S6).

Fluorimetry only for daidzein, formononetin, and coumestrol. MS usually removes sugars from the isoflavone glycoside. In other words the isoflavone aglycones tend to remain intact when subjected to MS.Individual standards for aglycones common. Standard curves for most isoflavones show high linearity when standard concentration is plotted as function of peak area from HPLC analysis. Internal standards commonly usedLegume-containing foods (such as lentil soup and baked beans) are rarely analyzed for their isoflavone content or for other flavonoidsFlavanones1,125,160,165,169,178,179,181,194,198,201,202Methanol, ethanol, acetone, water, ethyl acetate (to a lesser extent, propanol, dimethylformamide) solvent combinations frequently used for extraction. Using methanol–water (e.g., 60:40, v/v), extraction efficiencies for glycosylated flavanones in orange peel were <80%Sugars present, but hydrolysis not usually done. Acid hydrolysis destroys flavanone aglycones nearly as fast as the flavanone glycosides are hydrolyzed. Alkaline hydrolysis can cause the formation of chalcones (Figure S7)RP-HPLC: Binary eluant usually acetonitrile and water, both with acid (0.1–1% acetic, formic, or trifluoroacetic acid)UV maxima 270–295 and a weak peak or shoulder at 300–360 nm.

Rutinosides (Figure S5) tend to fragment easier than neohesperidosidesIndividual standards for most glycosides readily availablePresence of sugars needed for stability during analysis. Analyses are usually limited to certain glycosides, so aglycones may be underestimated. Flavanones have diastereoisomers that require chiral columns to separateFlavan-3-ols169,171,174,176,182,183,192,200,201,206,208Commonly, methanol–water or acetone/water/acetic acid (e.g., 70:28:2 v/v/v). 90% aqueous methanol most efficient compared with 90% ethanol, 90% acetone, or water-saturated ethyl acetateNot done; sugars not present but can be gallated. If flavan-3-ols are present in an extract exposed to acidic hydrolysis, destruction and/or rearrangement can occurRP-HPLC: Binary eluant usually acetonitrile (and/or methanol) and water, both with acid (0.05–2% acetic, formic, or trifluoroacetic acid)UV detection at 210, 240–280 nm.

Use of acidified aqueous acetone increases extraction of procyanidins by weakening hydrogen bonds between procyanidins and polar fibrous matrixesNot done intentionally. Acid degradation can occur due to organic acids present in separation and extractionNP-HPLC: Ternary eluant most common, usually dichloromethane, methanol, and acetic acid/water (e.g., 1:1 v/v); separates proanthocyanidins according to degree of polymerization up to decamers.UV maxima at 200–220 nm, 240–280 nm, and 300–380 nm. UV detection commonly done at 280 nm and is not specific in presence of other polyphenols. Fluorimetry also used. MS – fragments are formed by loss of monomeric residues, and only low-molecular-mass procyanidins are quantified. The positive mode is successful in detecting procyanidin oligomers through pentamers. MS does not distinguish different stereoisomersFor NP-HPLC, quantification is based on area under the curves using cocoa standards and does not use individual compound standards. Area summation of peak grouping is used to include contributions from all isomers within an oligomeric class. Peak breadth of certain oligomers is due to number of isomers. For RP-HPLC, each compound is separated and quantifiedIndividual compounds are not separated and quantified in NP-HPLC; monomers may be free flavan-3-ols or cleaved from oligomers and polymers during analysis (extraction and/or isolation). Neither NP-HPLC nor MS separates isomersRP-HPLC: For lower-molecular-weight proanthocyanidins, order of elution not related to degree of polymerization. Binary eluant is acetonitrile (or methanol) and water, both with acid (acetic, formic, or trifluoroacetic acid)\n\nCompleteness of flavonoid databases\n\nThe primary, or core, flavonoid databases provide extensive and precise data on the compounds in many foods, with a great deal of detail on variability, preparation, and processing. compares the three primary flavonoid databases currently available: the USDA databases203,224,225 for flavonoids,55 isoflavones,54 and proanthocyanidins58 and the Phenol-Explorer56,114,156,226–228 and EuroFIR-eBASIS229–234 databases. The values in these USDA and European databases are generally similar because they are based largely on a common group of analytical data for food flavonoids in the literature. The most recently updated databases contain the greatest number of foods and the greatest amount of flavonoid analytical data points for each food.\n\nTable 5\n\nUSDA database54,55,58,224Phenol Explorer56,114,156,226–228EuroFIR ePlantLIBRA and eBasisa 229–234CoverageFlavonoids, isoflavones, proanthocyanidinsAll phenolsAll major bioactive compounds in food plants and supplementsSpecific classes includedAnthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavanones, flavones, flavonols, proanthocyanidins; isoflavones, and 1 coumestanAnthocyanins; chalcones; dihydrochalcones; flavan-3-ols; flavanones; flavones; flavonols; isoflavonoids; phenolic acids, lignans, stilbenes, other polyphenols (curcuminoids, furanocoumarins, tyrosols, etc.)30 classes, including: flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, biogenic amines, carotenoids, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates, oligosaccharides, oxalates, phytosterols, and other polyphenolsTotal no. of compounds included26 individual flavonoids; 3 major and 2 minor isoflavones and the coumestan coumestrol; proanthocyanidins grouped by degree of polymerization monomers, dimers, trimers, 4–6 mers, 7–10 mers, and >10 mers; >24 132 original data pointsb518 polyphenols (282 flavonoids) in 6 classes and 31 subclasses, >37 636 original data points; >20 347 data points for flavonoids>25 000 data points covering 240 plants, and >500 distinct compounds in 30 classesDate releasedFlavonoids: March 2003; latest version (3.1) May 2014, with glycoside data in MS Access2009EuroFIR eBASIS started in 2005, ePlantLIBRA started in 2010Isoflavones: April 1999; latest version (2.0) September 2008Proanthocyanidins: August 2004Total no. of foods includedFlavonoids: 506 food items>455 foodsDatabase includes 370 plants and plant food supplement ingredients commonly consumed in EuropeIsoflavones: 557 foodsProanthocyanidins 205 foodsAvailable asFree pdf or MS Access databaseFree, by Internet in MySQL or MS Access database, reports exported in Excel spreadsheetsBy subscription, reports exported in Excel spreadsheetsDatabase data sourcesCALS, FSTAArticle citations, FSTA, Web of KnowledgeCAS SciFinder, Embase, PubMed, WoSSourcesFlavonoids: 307 articles, 1 industry source>636 articles in peer-reviewed journalsComposition data extracted from primary research in peer-reviewed journalsIsoflavones: 102 articles, 2 unpublished academic dataProanthocyanidins: 30 articlesAcceptable chemical methodsFlavonoids: HPLC, CC, capillary zone electrophoresis, micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatographyHPLC, GC, capillary electrophoresis; Folin assay, pH differential method for anthocyanins.

All compounds are linked to other chemical databases (CAS, ChEBI, PubMed). All mean values are linked to original publications. Original data used to calculate mean values are available. Of the 3 databases, it is the richestThis database contains information on beneficial and adverse bioeffects. It includes data on plant food supplements as well as plant foods. It also lists the individual compounds found in each plantURLhttps://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=24953http://phenol-explorer.eu/http://eplantlibra.eurofir.org/http://ebasis.eurofir.org/\n\nFor example, the first USDA release in 2003 had 225 food items, the release in 2007, 385 food items, and the release in 2011, 500 food items for 26 predominant flavonoids. The 2013 update includes 506 foods. Using blueberries as an example, in 2003 the USDA release had 2 items, in 2007 it had 4 items, in 2011 it had 5 items, and in 2013 it had 5 items but more data points. As a result, the total anthocyanidin value of raw blueberries (USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference #09050) has varied: 113 mg/100 g in 2003, 164 mg/100 g in 2007, 131 mg/100 g in 2011, and 163 mg/100 g in 2013. shows some common foods, which vary both in their flavonoid content and in the frequency with which they are consumed. Flavonoid intake estimates using updated databases tend to be higher than older estimates. Omissions of certain foods very rich in flavonoids, such as tea, cocoa, and berries, and also foods that are lower in flavonoid content but are eaten frequently in large amounts, such as tomatoes and potatoes, may lead to underestimates of flavonoid intakes.227,228\n\nFlavonoid-rich dietary supplements are often not included in dietary assessment instruments or, if they are included, only a generic question on supplement use is asked (e.g., use of vitamin-mineral or botanical supplements). Detailed information on form and dose is needed when individuals report the use of flavonoid-containing dietary supplements.10\n\nFlavonoid-rich supplements include black cohosh, blueberry extracts, chaste tree, citrus extracts, dong quai, evening primrose, Gingko biloba, green tea extracts, kava, lemon balm, licorice root, red clover, St. John’s wort, saw palmetto, soy, and valerian. Although single-ingredient flavonoid products (such as chrysin, daidzein, diosmin, genistein, hesperidin, quercetin, and rutin) are sold over the counter, most supplements, including soy, green tea, citrus, or bioflavonoids, are blends, extracts, or mixtures containing several flavonoids (often in more than one class). Regulations do not require the precise composition of blends to be validated by chemical analysis and stated on labels. Supplement products are reformulated often, making it difficult to know what is actually present. A dietary supplement label database that provides information on labeled ingredients for many products sold in the United States is now available.235 At present, survey data are insufficient to estimate the prevalence of the use of flavonoid-rich dietary supplements, but if it is high in certain groups236,237 such as postmenopausal women,26,238–240 this would be an incentive to include specific questions in surveys of such groups.\n\nInadequacy of dietary assessment tools\n\nDietary assessment of flavonoid intakes is unique because there are so many flavonoids in foods and the food composition tables upon which assessment depends are still quite incomplete, particularly for flavones and proanthocyanidins. Inadequate dietary assessment tools also contribute to misestimation in exposure assessment.61,95,241–249\n\nIn most epidemiologic studies, very large numbers of participants (often tens of thousands) report their usual diets using semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires that maximize information while reducing both participant burden and the costs of coding and analysis. Even so, food frequency questionnaires are particularly challenging for the assessment of flavonoid intakes. Most food lists for food frequency questionnaires used in US cohort studies were constructed on the basis of contributions to energy intakes or other key micro- or macronutrients of foods and beverages consumed by the study population or a sample of the entire US population (e.g., National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES]) without consideration of bioactive compounds. Since analytical data on flavonoids were not available during the construction of the original lists used in most food frequency questionnaires, older questionnaires still in use today may not be optimal to reflect the variability in dietary flavonoid intake in a population. This is primarily due to the paucity of information that would have allowed earlier researchers to identify key contributors of different flavonoids in the diet and place them in food frequency questionnaire food lists. Moreover, early food frequency questionnaires were designed to provide a rank order of usual intakes and not to provide quantitative estimates of absolute amounts of flavonoid intakes. Data from food frequency questionnaires developed in this way were often later used for studies of the association between flavonoids and health outcomes.250–252\n\nThus, the content of food frequency questionnaires is important. Some major flavonoid sources have been added to updated food frequency questionnaires as scientific interest in them has grown (e.g., tofu, tea, soy milk, blueberries). Some investigators have developed questions that focus on foods or dietary supplements that are known to be high in the bioactive compounds of particular interest, such as isoflavones in soy products (tofu and soy milk), or that contribute high amounts of flavonoids because they are consumed very frequently (e.g., potatoes, which are low in flavonoid content but are eaten very frequently in large amounts).252–254 Some questionnaires now include questions on seasonally available fruits (apricots, blueberries, cherries, nectarines, strawberries). The appropriateness of questions on seasonality will depend upon the food availability in the populations studied.\n\nA common problem in food frequency questionnaires is the combination of multiple foods with varying flavonoid content in the same line item. On some generic food frequency questionnaires designed to assess the intakes of many nutrients and not specifically the intakes of flavonoids, the criteria for combining certain foods in one line item were based on similar content for other nutrients (carotenoids, vitamin C, etc.) rather than for flavonoids. Such food groupings for composite items may not be appropriate for the precise assessment of flavonoid intake. For example, one early food frequency questionnaire grouped melons with berries, which would lead to underestimates of anthocyanidins, flavonols, and proanthocyanidins.255 Similarly, composites such as “citrus fruits” and “wines” may vary greatly in their flavonoid values. Another issue with composite items is that the weights given to the different items may vary from questionnaire to questionnaire (based on underlying intake in the study), so researchers should be careful to apply appropriate weights when deriving flavonoid values.\n\nillustrates how descriptions of some composite items (weighted equally for illustrative purposes) differ on existing food frequency questionnaires. For example, depending on which fruits are included, values for total flavonoids may vary from 113 mg/100 g (for peaches, apricots, and plums) to 60 mg/100 g (for peaches and nectarines) to 48 mg/100 g (for peaches, apricots, and nectarines). The differences are also notable for composites of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), ranging from 61 mg/100 g for kale, chard (actually in the beet or Chenopodiaceae family), and mustard greens, to 45 mg/100 g for kale, collards, mustard, and turnip greens, to 29 mg/100 g for collards, mustard, and turnip greens. For squashes and other vegetables, the values for the composites ranged from 29 mg/100 g (summer squash, eggplant, zucchini) to 10 mg/100 g (summer squash, okra, green pepper) down to 1 mg/100 g (summer squash, yellow squash, zucchini). Protocols for weighting the foods in a composite item vary and may increase the differences between values on food frequency questionnaires for individual foods and composite items. Standardization would facilitate comparisons across studies.246\n\nTable 6\n\nComposite items and questionnaire sourceAll items in one botanical family?CommentsHarvard (Willett) food frequency questionnaireaTotal flavonoids, mg/100 gBlock food frequency questionnaire, 1998bTotal flavonoids, mg/100 gNational Cancer InstitutecTotal flavonoids, mg/100 gFresh apples or pears80dApples or pears80Raw apples or pears80YesSame botanical family (Rosaceae)Orange juice15Real 100% orange juice or grapefruit juice, including fresh, frozen, or bottled18Fresh or frozen orange or grapefruit juice18YesSame botanical family (Rutaceae) but very different flavanone content, both in aglycones and in sugarsPeaches, apricots, or plumse113Raw peaches, apricots, or nectarines, while in season48Fresh peaches or nectarines, in season60YesSame botanical family (Rosaceae)Kale, mustard, or chard greens61Mustard greens, turnip greens, collards29Collards, mustard or turnip greens, or kale45NoAll belong to Brassicaceae family except chard (spinach family, Chenopodiaceae)Eggplant, zucchini, or other summer squash29Any other vegetable, like okra, squash, or cooked green peppers10Zucchini, yellow, or summer squash in season1NoAll belong to Cucurbitaceae family except eggplant and green peppers (Solanaceae) and okra (Malvaceae)\n\nSeveral investigators have developed food frequency questionnaires to assess isoflavone intakes more specifically.256–263 In the United States, the Block phytoestrogen questionnaire260,264,265 has been used in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation,252 the Women’s Health Initiative (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center),257 the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii,266 and the Adventist Health Study261 to measure isoflavonoid intakes. Some specialized questionnaires with a few flavonoid classes and compounds have been developed and used in some studies,254,267–271 and other more complete flavonoid questionnaires272–274 are being developed. Recently, the USDA released flavonoid data from the NHANES surveys for foods reported in 24-hour recalls, starting with the 2007–2008 survey years,275,276 simplifying the task of identifying foods that are important contributors of flavonoids in the US diet.4,43,277 Similar data are, or soon will be, available for populations in European countries, Australia, and elsewhere.85,278,279 This information is critical for identifying important sources of flavonoids to modify food frequency questionnaires and to develop food lists for targeted interviews. More work is needed in food frequency questionnaire development to capture important sources of additional flavonoids in US and other Western diets.\n\nThe alternative to food frequency questionnaires is the use of multiple food recalls and records to gather reports of all foods and beverages consumed. Multiple dietary recalls or records have the advantage that all foods and dietary supplements eaten are reported and quantified in 1-day time periods in replicate. Such data provide an estimate of intraindividual variation of intakes. Depending on the size of the study, however, this type of dietary assessment may not always be feasible, as daily recalls and records can be expensive and time intensive. Newer online technologies may make the use of multiple dietary recalls more acceptable.280,281 A few studies, such as the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition–Norfolk61,269 and the Women's Health Initiative,282 have collected both multiple food recalls and food frequency questionnaires. This use of dual assessments is helpful for capturing infrequently consumed flavonoid-rich foods and for developing even more complete food frequency questionnaires in the future.\n\nOTHER ISSUES UNRELATED TO DATABASES: BIOAVAILABILITY AND BIOMARKERS OF INTAKE\n\nOther sources of variation in exposure include the unknown bioavailability of flavonoid compounds.283 The bioavailability of flavonoids is thought to differ depending on the flavonoid, the food matrix, and the influence of intestinal bacteria in biotransforming the compounds in the gut, all of which contribute to intra- and interindividual variability of biological flavonoid exposure.284–294 The gallate, methoxy, or sugar groups (Figures S4–S6) as well as the structure of the aglycone are important in determining flavonoid bioavailability.112–115,295 The Phenol-Explorer database provides pharmacokinetic data from animal and human studies of various compounds.114\n\nThe lack of biomarkers of flavonoid intake is another problem. Although work is continuing and consensus is developing on the best candidates, at present there are no agreed upon biomarkers of intake for all the various flavonoid classes, owing in part to the interindividual variation in the metabolism of flavonoid compounds.95,249,296,297\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING ESTIMATES OF FLAVONOID EXPOSURE\n\nIt is clear that the estimated flavonoid intakes in US and European cohorts vary greatly, owing in part to databases that vary in their completeness and to the use of different dietary assessment tools that were not designed to estimate flavonoid intakes precisely. In addition, there are difficult-to-quantify influences of cultivar, cooking method, degree of fruit or plant maturity at consumption, etc. These methodological limitations may obscure true differences in intakes, limit the ability to observe associations between flavonoid intakes and chronic degenerative diseases, and contribute to inconclusive findings in published studies.\n\nMany of the shortcomings of flavonoid food and dietary supplement composition tables are remediable. For example, the development of improved chemical analyses and more complete flavonoid food and supplement databases is advised. Dietary assessment can be improved by adding flavonoid foods and supplements to food frequency questionnaires and using checklists to probe dietary recall and record responses to make sure all flavonoid-rich sources were mentioned and sources of variability ascertained (e.g., cooking method). The recommendations in provide cross-disciplinary suggestions to advance the knowledge of food flavonoids,298–301 starting with suggestions to improve methods of analyzing the flavonoid content of foods and supplements. In addition, standardization across laboratory methods is recommended. More complete data on the flavonoid content of foods and dietary supplements should be included in the available databases, and researchers should use these up-to-date flavonoid databases. Major food and supplement sources of flavonoids included in dietary assessment instruments should be based on population-based studies (such as NHANES) and reflect the consumption patterns of the study population.\n\nTable 7\n\nInvestigatorsRecommended actionCommentAnalytical chemistsUse up-to-date and appropriate chemical analyses of flavonoidsFor flavonoids, HPLC is currently the most robust method for separation and quantification. Analyses that include the C-glycosides and methoxylated flavonoids as well as the O-glycosides are needed. More data on flavonoid glycosides are now becoming availableUtilize standard reference materials (when available) for quality controlReference materials for flavonoids are usually developed in-house. Some external standard reference materials are now being provided through the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other agenciesFood composition database developersFill existing gaps on commonly eaten foods that contribute to total flavonoid intakesInclude the most popular varieties of each food item (e.g., Delicious, Granny Smith, McIntosh varieties of apples) due to variability by cultivar and varietyEnsure that all appropriate foods are included in flavonoid databasesAll food items and recipe constituents must be identified botanically. Some foods with the same name not only are different plants but are often in different botanical families, depending on the community. For example, “spinach” is usually Spinacea oleracea (Chenopodiaceae) in the United States, Rumex patientia (Polygonaceae) in Europe, and Ipomea aquatica (Convolvulaceae) in AsiaUse an up-to-date primary database that is relatively complete and based on current analytical methods. Teas and other foods vary in their flavonoid content, depending on their preparation; values should be included for commonly used varieties and variantsNutritional epidemiologistsEnsure that dietary assessment tools are appropriate for obtaining estimates of flavonoid intakesWhen serial 24-h recalls or diet records are available and representative groups queried, use the data to construct purpose-built FFQ food lists if those foods are consumed at least weekly in the population. 24-h recalls and food records are most useful if they are obtained randomly on numerous occasions so that factors such as seasonality are taken into account. However, this may not always be feasibleCheck the scientific literature for flavonoid content of foods not listed in primary databases. A food’s absence from a primary database does not mean it does not contain flavonoids. In some cases, flavonoid data for a specific food can be imputed from another botanically related foodFocus on greater precision of estimated intakes. If possible, standardize FFQs across studies to optimize pooled analyses and replication. Develop new and better purpose-built FFQs that focus on flavonoid-rich or commonly eaten foods. Commonly consumed flavonoid-rich foods or supplements that capture variation across the population are particularly important and should be added to FFQs whenever possible. See and for sources of flavonoid-rich foodsCertain details such as cultivar, herbs, and spices may be less feasible to assess using a FFQ except with a flavonoid-focused survey. In this case, significant sources of flavonoid intake (foods, supplements, and medicines), including recipes and composite items, may be queried (see and for some key food sources)Validate estimates of flavonoid intakes with biomarkers when possibleWhenever available, biomarkers of flavonoid intakes should be used to validate intake estimates. Continue to identify new and improved biomarkers of flavonoid intakeUse additional statistical techniques in assessing the relationship between flavonoid exposures and health outcomesAvoid multiple statistical testing of dozens or even hundreds of individual flavonoid compounds, as this increases the likelihood of false-positive findings, particularly if adjustments such as the Bonferroni correction are not doneBecause associations of risk for flavonoids and other nutrients or non-nutrients may not be linear, consider statistical techniques (e.g., restricted cubic splines) to evaluate the shape of the association and to evaluate the linearity assumptionExplore the gains to be made by controlling misestimations in flavonoid exposure estimatesEstimate the effects of improving flavonoid exposure estimates on relative risks and health outcomes in epidemiologic studies. It would be useful to carry out simulations to determine how much effect sizes and risk estimates improve by doing soConduct both observational and intervention studies of flavonoids and disease riskObservational studies are useful for examining associations between relative flavonoid consumption and chronic disease outcomes that require years to develop. Randomized double-blinded clinical trials of foods or components rich in flavonoids will be needed to prove causality but may not be feasible for studying chronic disease outcomes. Intervention studies are more feasible for studying shorter-term, modifiable biomarkers such as blood lipids, intermediate markers of disease such as blood pressure, and markers of glucose homeostasis and inflammation. Intervention research requires careful consideration of exposure form, dose, and length of interventionDevise flavonoid-rich dietary patterns associated with decreased health risksRecently, health recommendations from the American Institute of Cancer Research,298 the USDA,299 the American Cancer Society,300 and other organizations have focused on food patterns or groupings rather than specific nutrients in order to simplify communications and to deal with the issue of intercorrelated nutrients.301 With computer programs that permit categorization of food intakes by family, genus, and species, it may be possible to better identify flavonoid-rich dietary intake patterns that are most beneficial for health\n\nIdeally, future work would provide estimates of the impact of food form, processing, and preparation on flavonoid values (as is provided by Phenol-Explorer). Randomized intervention studies should also examine the doses and forms of compounds consumed in a flavonoid-rich diet, along with their impact on blood biomarkers. Food frequency questionnaire line items with more than one food should consider flavonoid content whenever possible and be appropriately weighted for the study population. Clearly, decisions in the development of dietary assessment instruments will be difficult because researchers must balance the need to assess multiple dietary factors with keeping the instrument relatively brief so as not to tire or overwhelm participants.\n\nThe harmonization of dietary assessment instruments across studies will facilitate future pooling of data, improve statistical power, and enable examination of rarer outcomes and disease phenotypes. Prespecification of hypotheses, the judicious use of statistical tests, and corrections for multiple testing are also recommended because of the multiple compounds involved and the many exposures of interest in flavonoid research. Finally, researchers should include more complete descriptions of the methodology used in assessing and analyzing flavonoid data, including the procedures used in estimating and categorizing flavonoid and proanthocyanidin classes and individual compounds.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBetter food composition tables can strengthen studies of the links between intakes of bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids, and health outcomes. However, to determine whether flavonoid intakes (or intakes of other bioactive compounds) lower the risk of chronic degenerative diseases, the aggregate evidence from many types of data must be examined. These data include in vitro, animal, clinical, and observational data and, when feasible, the results of randomized intervention studies. Complete food and supplement composition databases for flavonoids and appropriate dietary assessment methods are vital to any food-based research on flavonoids. The recently available flavonoid data from NHANES 24-hour recalls and other such studies highlight flavonoid-rich food and supplement sources for epidemiologic research. If these methodological issues are addressed, more precise estimates of flavonoid consumption can be evaluated in relation to health outcomes, and recommendations on optimal intakes for health can proceed more rapidly from speculative to evidence-based advice.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAny opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the view of the US Department of Agriculture.

Betalains are indole alkaloids and found predominantly in the Chenopodiaceae family (amaranth, beet, spinach family). Lycopene, a tetraterpene or carotenoid, is present in watermelon (Cucurbitaceae, squash family where many carotenoids are found), tomato (Solanaceae, potato family where anthocyanins are found in eggplant), and pink and red grapefruit (Rutaceae, citrus family where anthocyanins are found in blood oranges).\n\nFigure S2 Coumestrol, a coumestan. Coumestans are found predominantly in Fabaceae, the soy family, particularly clover. Coumestrol is often included in the chemical analyses of isoflavones.\n\nFigure S3 Proanthocyanidin pentamer and possible partial thearubigin structure. Proanthocyanidins, condensed tannins, are oligomers and polymers of flavan-3-ols. Thearubigins, derived tannins, are polymers or oligomers of flavan-3-ols formed during the fermentation of tea. Thearubigin structures are not known but may differ from proanthocyanidins due to flavan-3-ol gallates (Figure S4) and theaflavins ( ) present in tea. Above is just a possible partial structure for thearubigins (Scaled down 33% from other chemical structures).\n\nFigure S4 Examples of gallated and methoxylated flavonoids. Gallated flavan-3-ols are predominant in black, green, and oolong tea (Theaceae). Polymethoxylated flavones are found in citrus (Rutaceae) and peppermint (Lamiaceae).\n\nFigure S5 Flavanone O-glycosides. The only difference between these two flavanones is the attachment of the second sugar to the first sugar. The neohesperidose confers a bitter taste to the flavanone whereas the rutinose makes the flavanone tasteless.\n\nFigure S6 Flavone C-glycosides, isovitexin and vitexin, and an isoflavone acylated O-glycoside. Note that in daidzin 6\"-O-acetate the sugar is acylated not the aglycone.\n\nFigure S7 A chalcone and a dihydrochalcone. Some chalcones can easily cyclyze to form flavanones. Some dihydrochalcones are artificial sweeteners.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Corradini E, Foglia P, Giansanti P, et al.
