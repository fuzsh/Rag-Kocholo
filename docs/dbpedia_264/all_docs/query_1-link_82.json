        "text": "Spotted Seatrout Harvest Closed February\n\nSource: myfwc.com\n\nReminder: Spotted seatrout harvest is closed in the Western Panhandle Management Zone the entire month of February.\n\nNew regulations were put into place last year reducing bag limits and closing harvest during February in the Western Panhandle Management Zone. For more details see my previous post on the subject.When Spotted Seatrout season is open (months other than February) in the Western Panhandle Management Zone the daily bag limit is 3 per harvester. Harvested Spotted Seatrout must be more than 15 inches long and less than 19 inches long. One fish, per vessel, over 19 inches my be included in the bag limit.\n\nSee myfwc.com for complete information on all game and fish regulations in Florida.\n\nNew Spotted Seatrout Rules & 2020 Gulf Red Snapper Season Dates\n\nRecently FWC (Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission) announced rule changes relating to spotted seatrout.\n\nThe text was taken directly from FWC press releases; details not pertinent to NW Florida were removed.\n\nSeveral rule changes for spotted seatrout [went] into effect Feb. 1, including a closure to spotted seatrout harvest in the new Western Panhandle management zone. Spotted seatrout are one of Florida’s most popular inshore fisheries. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) made these changes after reviewing the results of a recent stock assessment and gathering input from anglers. These changes were made to benefit spotted seatrout populations while continuing to provide quality fishing opportunities.\n\nThe following rules [went] into effect Feb. 1, 2020:\n\nCreating two new zones by splitting the Northwest spotted seatrout management zone into the: (See maps below.)\n\nWestern Panhandle (Escambia County through the portions of Gulf County west of longitude 85 degrees, 13.76 minutes but NOT including Indian Pass/Indian Lagoon).\n\nBig Bend (remaining portion of Gulf County plus Indian Lagoon, and Franklin County through Fred Howard Park Causeway in Pinellas County).\n\nReducing bag limits\n\nWestern Panhandle: three fish (was five).\n\nBig Bend: five fish (no change).\n\nModifying the recreational slot size limit from 15-to-20 inches to 15-to-19 inches total length.\n\nAllowing one seatrout over 19 inches per vessel (currently per harvester).\n\nProhibiting captain and crew from keeping a bag limit on a for-hire trip.\n\nRe-establishing the February recreational closure in the Western Panhandle zone.\n\nLearn more about spotted seatrout by visiting MyFWC.com/Marine and clicking on “Recreational Regulations” and “Spotted Seatrout.”\n\nEarlier this week Governor DeSantis announced the dates for the 2020 Gulf Red Snapper Season – June 11 through July 25.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis Announces 2020 Gulf Red Snapper Season\n\nTallahassee, Fla. – Today, Governor Ron DeSantis announced the popular 2020 Gulf red snapper recreational season is set to open June 11 through July 25, with a possible fall reopening if quota is available. This season will apply to those fishing from private recreational vessels in Gulf state and federal waters, and to charter vessels that do not have a federal reef fish permit and are limited to fishing in state waters only.\n\nEarlier this month, Florida was delegated authority to manage recreational red snapper harvest from private vessels in Gulf federal waters.\n\n“I’m pleased to announce that our state’s good conservation practices are allowing us to have a 45-day Gulf red snapper season this year,” said Governor DeSantis. “Gulf red snapper season is always an exciting time for anglers and is just another reason why Florida remains the Fishing Capital of the World.”\n\n“Gulf red snapper is a conservation and management success story for Florida anglers,” said Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) chairman Robert Spottswood. “Just a few years ago, a 45-day season for red snapper in both state and federal waters was out of reach. Thank you to all the stakeholders and anglers who helped make this season possible by providing input and sharing information about their fishing trips.”\n\n“FWC is proud to be able to work with our stakeholders to balance conservation with fishing opportunities for Gulf red snapper and we are excited to see what the future holds as FWC takes the unprecedented step of managing this resource in both state and federal waters of the Gulf,” said Spottswood.\n\nFor more on recreational snapper regulations, visit MyFWC.com/Marine and click on “Recreational Regulations” and “Snapper” under the “Reef Fish” tab.\n\nFollow the link for more information on Snapper fishing in Florida – FWC Snappers\n\nCold weather and fish kills: What you need to know!\n\nWith the ongoing cold weather across the Panhandle, fish kills are being reported in many areas.\n\nIn the Panhandle, average water temperatures have dropped down to the 50s (degrees Fahrenheit) in many waterbodies. This is about ten degrees cooler than in normal years. Fish have a tolerance to temperature but when air and water temperatures decrease rapidly, fish kills may occur.\n\nFish kills due to cold weather are naturally occurring phenomena. In some cases there may be an ecological benefit. Exotic fish species that have adapted to Florida’s subtropical climate may not be able to withstand these colder temperatures and large numbers of the populations may be eliminated. The decrease in the population of exotic species may allow for an increase in native populations.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s (FWC) Fish Kill Hotline provides maps of fish kills throughout the state on a monthly basis. If you see a fish kill you can report it by phone: 1-800-636-0511 or online.\n\nThe FWC Fish Kill Website also allows the user to report fish kills and search the current database for fish kills by dates, county and possible causes of fish kills.

Estimate how many 10’ x 10’ areas would fit into the total area, and multiply that number by the number of fish in the original 10’ x 10’ area. This will give you an estimate of the total number of fish.\n\nMake a note of the weather conditions the past few days, air temperature, rainfall, cloud cover, wind strength and directions. Talk to your neighbors to determine if they have noticed anything unusual about the waterbody in the last few days.\n\nFor more information on understanding and reporting fish kills check out this publication from the University of Florida IFAS Extension:"
