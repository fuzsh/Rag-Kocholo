(Book 1)\n\nACcording to the Me∣thod of Anatomy, this belly or cavity comes in the first place, and is first of all dissected that the Guts and Ex∣crements may be the sooner removed, and the Body preserved from putrifaction.\n\nIt is all that, which is distinguished, within, from the Chest by the Midrif; it is circumscribed by the sword-like Gristle, the Share bones, Hip-bones, Os Sacrum, the Vertebra's of the Loynes, and the ba∣stard Ribs on either side.\n\nThe former part thereof is called Epi∣gastrium, which compasses the stomach and guts next unto it. The Arabians call it Mirath, which generally is used for the Belly, but in a particular sence it is taken for those wrinkles of the belly, which remain after child-bearing, and for the skin gathered together upon the belly, as Giggejus informs us.\n\nAnd the upper part hereof is termed Hypochondrium, neighbouring upon the lower gristles of the Ribs, and it is right or left: some term them Phrenes and Praecor∣dia.\n\nThe middle Region is termed Regio umbilicalis, whose lateral parts Aristotle calls Lagonas by reason of their Laxity, and Galen, Cenen••nas from their empty∣ness.\n\nThe lower part which reaches from the Navil to the Share, is termed Hypogastrium, by Hypocrates, Galen, Ruffus, Pollux; the Latins term it Imus venter and A∣qualiculus. The lateral parts thereof, are termed Ilia, and in the bending of the thigh by the Share Inguina the Groyns; and that part next over the Privities, which is covered with Down or Hair, is called P••bes the Share.\n\nThe hinder part of the lower Belly, is either the up∣per, which makes the Loynes; or the lower, which makes the Buttocks.\n\nMoreover this Belly consists of parts covering and covered, that is to say External and Internal.\n\nThe covering or Containing parts (which they pro∣perly call Abdomen) are either common, as the Scarf∣skin, the Skin, the Fat with its Membrane, the fleshy Pannicle, and the Coat proper to every Muscle; or proper, and they are the Muscles of the Abdomen, 〈…〉〈…〉 the Peritonaeum.\n\nThe inner or contained parts, do serve either for Nutrition or Procreation.\n\nFor Nutrition or making of Chyle, are subservient more or less, the Stomach, the Caul, the Sweet-bread, the Guts with the Mesentery: to the making of Blood, are sub∣servient more or less, the Meseraick Veins, the Venae portae with their Roots, the Cava with its Roots, the Liver, the Gall-bladder, the Gall-passage, the Spleen with the Vas breve, and the Haemorrhoides, the Arteria Caeliaca the Kidneys, the Capsulae Atrabiliariae or black choler boxes, the Ureters and the Piss bladder.\n\nThose which serve for Generation, are either Mas∣culine or Female: the Masculine are, the Spermatick Vessels, the Corpora Varicosa or Parastatae, the Stones, the carrying Vessels, the Prostratae, the Seminary blad∣ders, the Yard, &c. The Female are, the Spermatick Vessels, the Corpus Varicosum, the Testicles, the Ejacu∣latory Vessels, the Womb with its parts, &c.\n\nBut when a Man is in the Womb, there are yet o∣ther things considerable, as the Navil-vessels, the coats which infold the Child, &c. of which in their place.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Scarf-Skin.\n\nTHe Cuticula or Scarf-skin, in Greek Epidormis, is by some called the highest or last skin, also the cream of the skin, the cover of the skin, &c. It is a thin skin void of life and sense, close∣compacted, bloodless; bred of Oyly, sleek and clammy vapors thickned by the external cold, that it might be a cover to the skin.\n\nThe Matter of which the Scarf-skin is made, is not seed. For 1. It is no part of the Body. 2. It is not nourished. 3 A Spermatical part taken away breeds not again; but the scarf-skin is easily lost by rubbing and wearing, or being raised into blisters, by burning with Fire or scalding Water, &c.\n\nNor is the matter thereof Blood, For 1. All Veins do end at or within the skin. 2. It hath no spermatical Fibres, whi•••• ••asis of all sanguine parts. 3. In long ••a••tin\n\ndescription Page 2\n\nand Consumptions, it many times grows thick. 4. Be∣ing cut or torne, it sends forth no Blood. 5. It is not of a red color, &c.\n\nNor are the Excrements of any Dige∣stion, the matter thereof. Not the Excrements of the first or second dige∣stion; for how should it be made of Dung, Urin or Gall? Nor the Excre∣ments of the third, For the third Digestion or Con∣coction hath a threefold Excrement. 1. Vaporous and thin which Expires. 2. Thin, but more solid then the former, of a waterish substance, such as are Ichors and Wheyish humors, which by their sharpness and Acrimony, would sooner hinder the Generation of the Scarf-skin, or corrode the same after it is generated. 3. Thick, Clammy, and sticking fast, which Archangelus and Laurentius, do suppose to be dried and turned into the Scarf-skin, and they demonstrate the same from the filth which is, in bathing, scraped from the foles of the Feet. And if their opinion were true, the Scarf-skin would come off in Baths.\n\nAnd therefore the matter thereof is another Excrement, viz. an Oyly, Thick, Clammy, and moist vapor (for of dry Exhalations the Hair is made) proceeding from the Skin and Members under the same. So we see in a Skillet of Water-gruel, a Skin grows over the top of the Gruel, being mad, of the vapors thereout ascending, con∣densed by cold.\n\nNow the Scarf-skin is bred, partly in the womb with the Skin, and partly without the Womb. Within, For 1. So there are the rudiments and beginnings of Hair, Teeth, Nails in the Child in the Womb, 2. Without the Scarf-skin, the skin would be moist, and the Humor would sweat out with pain, as in gal∣lings and where Phoenigmi are applied. 3. Experience shews, that the Scarf-skin is somewhat apparent in an Abortion, and may be separated by some fretting Hu∣midity. But whiles the Child is in the Womb, it is exceeding tender, soft, and but as yet begun to be made: because there is not in the Womb so much cold, only a small degree springing from the serous humor which surrounds the Child. But it receives its Com∣plement and perfection without the Womb, from the coldness of the Air, which doth more condense and dry, which is the Cause that the skin of all New-born In∣fants looks red.\n\nWherefore the remote and internal Efficient thereof is in the inward heat of the Body, thrusting forth a vapor into the surface thereof, as Exhalations are made by the suns heat. The next and external, is the coldness of somebody, as the Air, &c. compact∣ing, and thickning. So Gruel, Hot milk, and other hot dishes of meat, have a skin growing over them: sometimes also the dryness of the Ambient Air, consu∣ming the external humor, and compacting the remain∣ders of the matter. Now by how much the said vapor is more Earthy and Clammy, by so much more solid is that which is bred thereof.\n\nThe Vse thereof is to defend the Skin. And therefore 'tis somwhat hard, howbeit exceeding thin and yet transparent, like the transparent skins of Onions; least if it were thicker, the skin should not feel 〈…〉〈…〉 it is somtimes bard and brauny, in the Hands 〈…〉〈…〉 by reason 〈…〉〈…〉 of Labor and Travel.\n\n〈…〉〈…〉 ••••d more compact than 〈…〉〈…〉 And therefore it is that watery pustules pass through the Skin but not the Scarf-skin. Yet not over close and compact, least it should hinder the bodies transpiration And it is close wrought, not only to defend the parts under it but that also too great an efflux of Vapor, Blood, Spirit and heat might not happen. For it is the cover of the Mouths and extremities of the Vessels. And therefore those cannot live in good health that are born without a Scarf-skin; as was seen in Lewes the King of Bohemia and Hungaria, who became gray hair'd while he was but a Boy.\n\nIt is of a white color, and therefore of a cold and dry temper and quite void of Blood, For being torn or cut, it sends forth no Blood. Nor is it nourished by Blood, as Lauremberg and Sperlinger would have it; for it is not intrinfically nourished by attraction of its proper Ali∣ment; but by addition of parts▪ the vapor growing into the like nature of the Scarf-skin, as Casserus rightly disputes, The Scarf-skin is black in Blackmores, but not the skin beneath it.\n\nAs for number: there is but one Scarf∣skin; only there was once two found by Aquapendent: the one being strongly fastned in the pores of the skin, and inseperable: the other seperable without offence to the skin. Which happens in some only, not in all parts of the Body. Also Laurembergius, in applying Vesicatories, found the Scarf-skin double; but that is a rare case, for that Vesicatories do peitce unto the skin is apparent from the humor dropping out, and the pain. In brawny Callosities, indeed there are many little skins, as it were the skins of Onyons; but they are besides nature, whose Generation and cure is delivered by Fallopius.\n\nIn point of Connexion, it sticks so close to the Skin of a man, while he is alive, as if it were one continued body therewith. Yet many times it is cast off as snakes and serpents cast their skins, which Felix Platerus tells us did happen to him∣self; and which happens in burning Feavers and the small Pox. Salmuth observed as much in some Gouty persons, in an Ague, and some other cases. In dead persons 'tis separated by a Candle, or scalding Water: in living Bodies with Phoenigmi. In the Nut of the Yard, it sticks not to the skin, but to the flesh.\n\nCHAP. II. Of the Skin.\n\nCVtis, the skin, is in Greek cal'd Derma, as it were Desma a band; it is the com∣mon covering of the Body; or a Tempe∣rate Membrane bred of the seed by a proper faculty, to be the Instrument of feeling, and to defend the parts beneath it.\n\nIt is called a Membrane, which must not be under∣stood simply, but so as to be a Membrane of a peculiar nature and proper temperament. And therefore Piccolhomineus was mistaken when he would have the skin to be simply a Membrane; for the skin is thicker, hath a substance proper to it self, and is tem∣perate.\n\nBut the opinion of others is, that the matter hereof is Seed and Blood well mixed together, so that the skin hath a middle nature between Flesh 〈…〉〈…〉 Nerves. And therefore Galen 〈…〉〈…〉 that it is as it 〈…〉〈…〉 a Nerve\n\ndescription Page 3\n\nendued with blood: he sayes not simply, but as it were. For he also likens it to a Membrane, because in some parts it may be extended, feels exquisitely, and is white.\n\nAristotle would have the skin to consist of flesh dried and grown old as it were. But the skin is easily flaid from the parts under it, and between the flesh and skin there is fat, a Membrane, &c. to which Opinion Fernelius in∣clined, when he said that the skin of the Face was a certain more dry portion of the flesh beneath it. Where∣in he also is to be blamed, Because 1. It may be sepa∣rated from the flesh. 2. It will admit of Scars as the skin in other places.\n\nOthers say it is made of the Extremi∣ties of the Vessels widened, because it every where lives and feels, and the ex∣tremities of the Vessels end thereinto: but this may be said of all the parts of the Body.\n\nOthers, of the softer Nerves spread out in the surface of the Body, an addition of blood concurring: but this Opinion is of no more force then the formet.\n\nThe skin therefore is made of Seed taken in a moderate quantity: and for its enlargement, it had a moderate quantity of blood; but seed seems to hold the greater proportion. For the skin is naturally whi••ish; though it varies according to the plenty of humors and Bodies beneath it. For such as the Hu∣mor is, such will be the color of the skin. So Sanguine persons have it ruddy; those that are Jaundized, have it yellow or black. Examples whereof see in Marcel∣lus Donatus and others. If flesh lie beneath it, the red∣der it is, if fat the whiter.\n\nIt is in respect to the seed, that Au∣thors say, the skin grows not together again after it is wounded. In respect of the blood, there is somewhat like the skin produced, viz. a Scar: Which consists as it were of burnt and dried flesh. Howbeit in Children, by reason of the moisture of their skin, as also the aboun∣dance of glutinous humors, a wound hath been obser∣ved to be closed up with true skin; Witness Spige∣lius.\n\nWherefore the skin being made as it were of a Mem∣branous, cold and dry, and of a fleshy, hot and moist substance; becomes temperate in all the first and se∣cond qualities, that it may rightly judg of all.\n\nThe Efficient Cause of the skin, is the Skin-generating faculty; as in a bone the Bone-generating faculty, in a Nerve the Nerve-forming power or faculty, &c. which faculty frames a part differing from all other similar parts. But how doth the faculty make of the same Seminal matter Nerves, Bones, &c. by an hidden and divine power as it were.\n\nThe publick Action of the skin, and which is necessary for the whole Living-Creature is, to be the primary Instrument of the sense of feeling, for every Mem∣brane is the Adaequate Organ, as may be seen in the Bones, Nerves, Stomach, &c. For though all the Or∣gans of the senses are dissimilar parts, yet one similar part is the primary cause of the action, which is to be performed by the whole Organ. For examples sake, the hand is indeed the Organ of feeling, and especially that part of the skin, which covers the hollow of the Hands and Feet, as being of all other most temperate. And because the skin is temperate in the first qualities; it is therefore also temperate in the second, as 〈…〉〈…〉 hardness, thickness, thinness, & 〈…〉〈…〉.\n\nThe first use of the Skin is, to be a Covering for the Body, and therefore it hath received a Figure so round, long, &c. as the subject parts requi∣red; and therefore also it is seared without the Body, and because it was to be as it were the Emunctory of the Body. The professors of Physiognomy commend unto us another use of the skin, as it is streaked with lines; who are wont to tell mens Fortunes from the Lines and Hillocks in their Hands, and from the Pla∣netary and Adventitious Lines in their Foreheads. A third use is Medicinal, being good for Anodin•• Empla∣sters. Being dried, it helps women in Labor; Epi∣leptick Convulsions, according to the experience of Hildanus and Beckerus; Wounds of the Scul, according to Poppius. The fourth is more illustrious, that it might give way to Excrements, and exclude insensible soo∣ty Fumes by way of insensible Transpiration, by which we are more disburthened then by all our sensible Eva∣cuations put together. By this, Sanctorius through the statick Art, in the experience of thirty years, did learn that many persons in the space of one natural day, do void more by transpiration, then in fifteen dayes toge∣ther by stool. The fift is to attract. 1. Air in tran∣spiration, in Apople••tick and Hysterical fits, and in such as dive deep and bide long under the Water. 2. Juyce, in long fasting, from plasters applied, if we credit the Observations of Zacutus Lufitanus; and the force of purgative and other external Medicaments. And for this cause.\n\n'Tis bored through in divers places, for the ingress and egress of things necessary. Now its holes are some of them visible, as the Mouth, the Ears, the Nostrils, &c. others invisible and insensible, as the pores. Those pores of the Body, being otherwise not Conspicuous, are seen in the winter, when the Body is suddenly ba∣red; for then the Scarf-skin looks like a Gooses skin when the feathers are pul'd of. By reason (it seems) of these pores it was, that a certain Persian King made use of the skins of Men for windowes, if we may credit Orabasi••s.\n\nThe Skin is thick, six fold thicker then the Scarf∣skin, but thinner then it is in other Animals, nor must any one judg of the thickness of the Skin after it is made into Leather, for by Tanning it is much con∣tracted and thickned, And it seems to be made ligh∣ter, for a Mans skin Tanned according to the Obser∣vation of Loselius, weighs four pounds and an half.\n\nIt is soft and exquisitely sensible, but softer and thin∣ner in the Face, Yard, and Cods; harder in the Neck, Thighs, soles of the Feet, Back; of a midling con∣stitution between hardness and softness, in the tops of the Fingers. So, some part of the skin is extream thick as in the Head, according to Aristotle, falsly cited by Columbus. Some is thick, as in the Neck; some thin as in the sides, whence proceeds tickling; some yet thinner as in the Palms of the Hands, some thin∣nest of all, as in the Lips. In Children 'tis more thin and porous then in grown persons, in women then in men; in an hot Countrey, then in a cold. Also the Skin is more rare and open in the Summer then in the Winter; and therefore it is that the skins of Animals flaid off in the Summer do more hardly retain their hair, then such as are flaid off in the winter. Also it varies very much according to the diversity of the suo∣ject; so that in some it hath been of an admirable den∣sity and thickness, if we beleive Petrus Ser•…•… who tels of two Negro women, that could without hurt take up▪ carry, hold, and almost extinguish burning oles with their bare Hands. Fallopius saw the skin of 〈…〉〈…〉 so 〈…〉〈…〉 that he lost his feeling 〈…〉〈…〉 ••easo•…•… of the Nerves\n\ndescription Page 4\n\nAs to its Connexion: some skin is easily separated from the parts under it; as in the lower and middle Belly, in the Arms and Thighs. From others with more diffi∣culty by reason of the thick Membrane to which it is fastned by the Fibres, and by means of the Vessels. In the soles of the Feet and Palms of the Hands, it is hard∣ly separated, to which parts it grows that they might lay the faster hold. Also hardly from the flesh of the Forehead and of the whole Face, especially of the Ears and Lips, by reason of tendons and Muscles mixed therewith, especially the Muscle Latus so called, ming∣led therewith. So, in the Forehead it is moveable, and in the hinder part of the Head of some People by reason of peculiar Muscles; but it is not so in the rest of the Body.\n\nThe skin hath received common Ves∣sels, for Nourishment, Life and Sense. It hath received two cutany Veins, through the Head and Neck, from the Jugulars; two through the Arms, Breast and Back, from the Axillaries; two through the lower Belly, Loyns and Legs, from the Groyns, which are Conspicuous in women after hard Labor, and in such as have the Varices in many bran∣ches. It hath few Art ••••ng. And those very small, in the temples and Forehead, Fingers, Cod and Yard. It hath no Nerves creeping in it, but it hath many en∣ding in it, as Galen conceived: though Iohannes Veslin∣gus the prime Anatomist of Padua sayes there are very small branches of Nerves running through the skin; and that rightly, for their presence was necessary to cause the sense of Feeling.\n\nCHAP. III. Of FAT.\n\nFAt is a similary Body void of Life, growing together out of Oyly blood, by reason of the coldness of the Membranes, for the safegard of the whole Body. That it is void of Life, appears in that it is cut without pain, and Consump∣tions thereof shew as much. Therefore Pliny writes that living sowes are gnawn by Mice; and Aelian re∣ports that the Tyrant Dionysius was so Fat, that when he was a sleep, the pricking of Needles could not awake him. Also in Greenland they cut fat out of living Whales which they never feel nor perceive.\n\nPinguedo fat, which the Greeks term Pimele, is by Gaza ill translated Adeps: for Pinguedo is an Aiery hot and moist substance of the moister sorts of Ani∣mals, and is more easily melted with heat, and will scarce ever become hard again, nor can it be broken, and it is soft, laxe and rare: but under∣stand the contrary in Suet, which easily grows hard and stiff, but is hardly dissolved, &c.\n\nNow fat to speak properly, is not a part, but rather an humor, unless haply it be considered together with the Membrane, as many times it is by Galen.\n\nThe 〈…〉〈…〉 of our order is this; because fat in a man is between the skin and the fleshy Membrane, in •…•…s under the Membrane which moves the\n\nThose parts are void of fat, which could receive no profit thereby but hindrance by resisting convenient Complication and Distension, as the Brain, Eyelids, Yard, Cod, and Membranes of the Testicles. Now it is chiefly in those parts which are more strongly moved then the rest, hard like Suet, and interwoven between the Fibres and little Veins, as in the Palm of the Hand, the inner sides of the Fingers (for there are many tendons, Nerves and Vessels, which ought to be moistened) in the sole of the Foot, especi∣ally the Heel. It is softer in sundry parts, of which in their place.\n\nCaecilius Folius hath larely written that the matter whereof fat is made, is the milky juyce, or fatter portion of the Chylus, and that therewith the Bones are nourish∣ed. To which opinion I oppose. 1. That such as eat fat meats, do not presently grow fat. 2. That the Chylus is too crude to nourish the parts. 3. That Children should presently become fat as we see it hap∣pen in Children new born, who have been nourished only with their Mothers Blood. 4. That the Chylus is necessarily changed before it come unto the Parts. 5. There is no passage from the Mesentery to the ex∣tream parts of the body; for it is neither suckt through the Membranes, as some learned men suppose, nor is it carried through the Glandules. Not the former. 1. Because they are thicker, then to suck and draw as threads. 2. They would appear swoln, and would in Anatomy discover some Oyly moisture in them. Nor the latter, 1. Because the Kernels are not continued with the fat parts. 2. Nor do they receive any profit∣able humor, but Excrements, yea they abound with a white, flegmatick, but not a fat humor. 3. We ob∣serve that many creatures grow fat which have no Ker∣nels. Now the fatter part of the Chyle is the material cause of fatness, but it is only the remote cause, and therefore in deed and truth,\n\nThe Matter thereof is Unanimously concluded to be Blood, whence Aristotle sayes, that such Creatures as have no Blood, have nei∣ther Fat nor Suet: but it must be blood Purified and Absolutely concocted, nor yet all such blood, but that which is thin, Aiery and Oyly. It resem∣bles the buttery substance of Milk, and the Oyly substance of Seed; and there∣fore Aristotle did well deny Fat to be moist; with a watery moisture, his meaning was, not with an Aiery. Against whom Fernelius and Columbus have written. And when fat is made of Oyly Blood, much of the heat is lost. Whence Aristotle sayes; Such things as are condensed by cold, out of them much heat is for∣ced and squeezed. And in another place: Natural matters are such, as the place is wherein they are.\n\nTherefore the nature of Fat is colder then that of blood, yet is it moderately hot; For 1. Outwardly applyed, it Digests, Resolves, Discusses. 2. It is the thinner and more Oyly part of the blood. 3. It easily takes fire. 4. It encreases the heat within, as the Caul assists the Stomachs Conco∣ction, &c.\n\nSome will have it to be cold, because Aristotle sayes, whatever things grow together by cold, and are mel∣ted by Heat, are cold. But Fat is congealed by cold. I answer: Fat is cold in respect of the Heat which be∣fore it had, while it was blood. But we must learn 〈…〉〈…〉 the same Aristotle, that such things as having been 〈…〉〈…〉 cold, are melted with an easie Heat, have\n\ndescription Page 5\n\n[illustration]\n\nIn this TABLE are expressed the common Coverings of the Belly separated, and on one side the Fat besprinkled with its Vessels, and on the other side certain Muscles Detected▪\n\nThe II.

The cause Efficient of its growing together, is the coldness of the Membranes (from whence it gains its white color) not simple but respective; yet sufficient to coagulate the oylie part of the blood sweating forth, even as melted Lead grows congea∣led, when it is poured out into a place hot enough, yet colder then the fire. And Fat grows together by cold, in a certain degree as it were (for every thing is not made of every thing) and therefore Fat is not bred in any part. Now that Fatness proceeds from Coldness Galen and other Learned men have determi∣ned, so that the Fat, light, and thin Part of the Blood, while in hotter Bodies it turns to Nutriment, in colder it is reserved (and therefore hot and dry Animals are hardly eyer fat) and when the Veins send it out of themselves, it lights upon the Membranes, and grows together.\n\nFor 1. Even the Blood, when it is out of the Ves∣sels, does after this manner grow together, by meeting with the cold Air, though its internal Coldness do also, help forward the mutation.\n\n2. Aristotle saies, among such things as melt, those that are melted by heat, are congealed by cold, as Oyl.\n\n3. The colder Creatures are the fatter, as Gueldings, Foemales; also such as lie long hid in the Earth with∣out Exercise: So in the Winter, all Creatures are fat∣ter.\n\n4. Fat is only bred in cold places, as in the Membranes: So we see the Call is fat, by reason of its membranous Substance, also in respect of its place, being far from the hot Bowels, for it 〈…〉〈…〉 upon the Guts, under the Peritonaeum, and beca•…•… stored with abundance of Veins and Arteries, i•…•…uch\n\ndescription Page 6\n\nFat; so about the Heart Fat is collected, for there is the Peri∣cardium, a cold and thick Mem∣brane; also the wheyish Humor contained therein: be∣low it there is the Midriff as a Fan, on either fide the Lungs like Bellows, the Mediasti∣num &c. So about the the Kid∣neys Fat is gathered, because they abound with a wheyish Excrement, lie near the Back∣bone, and are covered by the Guts.\n\n5. A Cover hanging over boyling Water, coagu∣lates the Vapors which arise unto it, and turns them in∣to water by its Coldness. For make the Air round a∣bout exceeding hot, and then the Vapors striking a∣gainst the cover, will not be condensed.\n\nAnother Opinion is, that Fat is made by an hot Cause, because the matter thereof is hot, and because Fat easily flames; al∣so because all things are made in the bo∣dy, by Coction, and Heat. But the an∣swer is clear from what hath been said before. And we do not mean meer Coldness, the Cause of Crudity, but a weak Heat.\n\nSome say that Fat attains its consi∣stency from the compactness of the Membranes, for that which is itself compact makes other things so. I answer. That cold things condense, and Condensation proceeds from Cold, nor can that which is condensed condense, unless it were a first Quality, or should take the assistance of Cold, for otherwise the thinness of the Membrane would make the fat thin. And why does not the den∣sity or compactness of the Vessels make the matter contained to be condensed and compact?\n\n2. In like manner they object: By a thick cover though very hot, the Vapor arising from boyling Wa∣ter, when it meets therewith, is turned into Water, or in a Distillation by an Alembick, the Exhalations ari∣sing from the subject matter, meeting with the thick glass are stopped, and by reflection turned into a thick∣ned Substance. But the Answer, is clear from what hath been said; moreover, the Vapors which are raised up by boyling, if they are by the Vessel so shut in, that there is no place to breath out, new Vapors continual∣ly arising, that there may not be a Penetration of Bo∣dies, it is necessary, that they reassume their former con∣sistency: But if they find egress, they turn to Water, by reason of the cold Air surrounding the glassie Cover. And therefore it is that, to make the Liquor issue more aboundantly, Distillers ever and anon cool the same with cold Water. So when the Air abroad is cold, hot Vapors within do turn to Water upon the glass Win∣dows; which does not happen when the Air is hot a∣broad.\n\n3. They say, that there are many cold Parts, as the Brain and its coats, &c. which have no Fat about them. I answer, those Parts also are dense. Nor would Na∣ture have Fat in those Parts, for it would be both un∣profitable and hurtful: And a moderate Heat is there provided for, by the thickness of the Skin, the Hair and the Skull.\n\nFabius Pacius makes the cause to be also Dryness, by reason of the Fi∣bers of Fat. To which is repugnant 1 That Fat is not dry, but moist. 2 •…•…le Fibers, as the Blood hath. Touch∣•…•…e Anatomical Contradictions of my Fa∣〈◊〉〈◊〉\n\nOther late Writers are pleased with a new conceit, that Fat is made, by a pe∣culiar fat-making form, as a bone is made by a bone-making form. Who doubtless are mi∣stakens because 1 Fat doth not live. 2 It hath no certain Dimension. And 3 The blood turns into the marrow of the bones, without the help of such a form.\n\nThe Form of Fat as long as it is in the Vessels, is not congealed, but liquid and melted, by reason of the Heat which as yet remains in the Vessels. It hath been voided liquid by Urin, as Helmo••t hath observed, and in an healthy Woman by stool, in the Observation of Hildanus. Folius conceives it is liquid in the Vessels, by reason of likeness of Nature, but that it is congea∣led without, because of the different Nature of the Fi∣bres. But no man can easily observe the dissimilitude of the fibres, either within the body, or without.\n\nThe Fat of the Belly hath three Veins, the external Mammillary descending from above the Vena Epigastrica, arising from be∣neath out of the crural Vein, through the Groins, and very many Veins coming out of the Loins, accompa∣nied with Arteries. And through these, and the Vessels of the Skin, Cupping-glasses and Scarifications draw Humors out of the inner Parts, as far as I can con∣ceive.\n\nIt hath a very great aboundance of Ker∣nels, which receive Excrements out of the Body into themselves. In sickly persons, and such as abound with excrementitious Moisture, they are more plentiful.\n\nThe Use of Fat is 1 To keep warm like a Garment, to cherish Natural Heat, by its Clammyness, hindring the going forth thereof, and by its thickness, stopping the Passages, least Cold should enter; and in Summer, they keep out the Heat.\n\n2. In a special manner to help the Concoction of the Stomach. And therefore the cutting out of the Call breeds Winds and Belchings, and to cause good Dige∣stion, it is necessary to provide some other covering for the Stomach.\n\n3. To daub and moisten hot and dry parts, such as is the Heart.\n\n4. To facilitate Motion, provided it be moderate, for abundance of Fat hinders Motion and all other A∣ctions, and to keep the Parts from being over dried, distended, or broken. Hence it defends the ends of Gristles, the Joyntings of the greater Bones; and it is placed on the outside of certain Ligaments, also about the Vessels carried to the Skin. For this very cause, there is store of Fat in the Socket of the Eye, least by reason of continual Motion, it should become dry and withered as it were. And the Vena Coronalis of the Heart, is fenced with much Fat, to accommodate the great Motion and Heat of the Heart.\n\n5. It serves as a Pillow and Bulwark against Blows, Bruises, and Compressions. And therefore it is that Nature hath furnisht the Buttocks, and the Hollow of the Hands and Feet with plenty of Fat.\n\n6. In times of Famine, it is turned into nourishment, for we are nourish∣ed with that which is sweet and fat, as being familiar to us and our Nature, if we will beleive Galen and other Authors. Whose Intention Rondeletius interprets to be, that the Fat doth only releive famished persons, and hold the parts •••• the Body in play, till they attain their proper Nou∣••shment.\n\n7. It fills up the empty spaces between the Muscles,\n\ndescription Page 7\n\nVessels, and Skin, and consequently renders the Body smooth, white, soft, fair, and beautiful. And there∣fore persons in a Consumption and decrepit old Wo∣men are deformed, for want of Fat.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of Membranes in General, of the fleshy Membrane, and the Membrane which is proper to the Muscles.\n\nUNder the fat in a Man, the Mem∣brana carnosa, or fleshy Mem∣brane lies, which in Apes, Dogs, and Sheep lies next the Skin. Before we treat thereof, some things are to be known concerning the Nature of a Membrane in general.\n\nThe Ancients called the Membranes Hymenas, and sometimes Chitona's Coats, also Meningas; and other∣whiles Operimenta, and Tegumenta Coverings; and with Galen and other Anatomists, speaking in a large Sense, a Coat and a Membrane, are one and the same thing. But when they speak in a strickt and proper Sense.\n\nThat is a Membrane which com∣passes some bulkie Part, as the Pe∣ritonaeum, the Pleura, the Periosti∣um, the Pericardium, and the pecu∣liar Membranes of the Muscles.\n\nBut the term Tunica or Coat in a strickt sense, is attributed properly to the Vessels, as Veins, Arteries, Ureters, the Womb, the Gall-blad∣der, and the Piss-bladder, the Gullet, the Stomach, the Guts, the Stones.\n\nThe term Meninx is properly given and peculiarly to the Membranes of the Brain.\n\nNow a Membrane is a simi∣lar part broad, plane, white, and which may be stretched, made by a proper Membrane-making faculty, of clam∣my and watery Seed, to the end that it might by cloa∣thing defend the Parts.\n\nThe Form thereof is the equality of its Surface, Thinness, and Lightness (least it should burden) com∣pactness and strength that it might be widened and stretched.\n\nIts Use is 1. To cloath and defend the Parts by reason of its hardness and com∣pactness; and to be the Instrument of feeling: For the Parts feel by help of the Membranes. And so great is the necessity of Membranes, that Na∣ture hath covered every Part with a Membrane. 2. To strengthen the parts. 3. To defend the parts from the injury of the Cold, and to keep the Natural Heat from exhaling. 4. To joyn parts with parts. So the Me∣sentery knits the Guts to the Back. 5. To shut the mouths of the Vessels, least the Humors should flow out, or flow back: As in the Bladder, where the Ure∣ters are implanted, in the Ventricles of the Heart, by the Valves.\n\nNow a Membrane is thicker or thin∣ner.\n\nThe thin Membrane differs in thin∣ness. For the Periostium of the Ribs is thinner then the Pleura, the Periostium of the Head, is thinner then the Pericraneum; the pia mater is thin∣ner then the dura mater.\n\nThe thick Membrane is the Membrana carnosa, which is not every where alike thick; for it is thicker in the Neck then other places. And now let us speak of the Membrana carnosa, or fleshy Membrane.\n\nThe Panniculus carnosus or Mem∣brana carnosa is by some termed a membranous Muscle, by others a Nervie Coat, a fattie Coat, &c. It is termed fleshy, because in some places, as about the Forehead, the compass of the Neck, and the Ears, it turns to a musculous flesh, and in such Creatures as by the help hereof can move their whole Skin, it seems to be a Muscle: It is endued with such fleshy Fibers, es∣pecially in their Necks, by the motion whereof they drive away flies. But in Man, save in his Forehead, it is immoveable; only Vesalius and Valverda report that there were some men who could move the Skin on their Chest and Back, and in other parts, just as oxen do. In whom doubtless this Membrane was made of the same constitution, which it hath in Brutes. More∣over in new-born Children, it resembles flesh, by rea∣son of plenty of blood; in grown persons it is like a Membrane, by reason of continually being dried. In a Mans Body, if exact Separation be made, it will ap∣pear to consist of four distinct Membranes. Spigelius and others do take those membranous Fibers, which are every where interwoven among the Fat, to be Pan∣niculus carnosus, or Membrana carnosa.\n\nIts Use is 1. To defend the neighbor∣ing Parts, yea, and to cover and defend the whole Body, and therefore it is situate all over the bo∣dy.\n\n2. To keep in the Fat, that it flow not out, or melt by reason of the continual motion of the Muscles.\n\n3. To support those Vessels which are carried into the Skin (which go between the Skin and this Membrane) for it is knit unto the Skin by very many Veins, some fewer Ar∣teries, branches of Nerves, and membranous Fibers; and to the Membranes under the Muscles, by the smal∣ler Fibers. It is therefore false, that when the Fat is consumed by fasting, the Skin sticks to the Muscles no otherwise, then a Ball to a peice of cloth wherewith it is covered. It sticks most firmly to the Back, in fashion of a Mem∣brane, and therefore it is said to arise from thence. In the former part of a Mans Neck and his Forehead, it can hardly be separated from the Skin and the Muscu∣lus latus; it sticks so close, and is thought to constitute the Musculus latus.\n\nThe Surface thereof is slippery, there where it tou∣ches the Muscles, by reason of that clammy Humor, which is wont to be daubed upon the Membranes, least the motion of the Muscles should be hindred. It is of exquisite sense; and therefore if it be twitched by a sharp Humor, it causes shivering and shaking, as by Choler in Agues.\n\nThe proper Membrane of the Muscles, which some will have to spring from the Pericranium or Periostium, others from the nervous Fibers of the Mus∣cles, is thin, and is knit unto the Muscle, by most thin filaments.\n\nIts Use is 1. To cloath the Muscle and separate them one from anothe•• 2. To impart unto them the Sense of 〈…〉〈…〉\n\ndescription Page 8\n\nCHAP. V. Of the Muscles in General.\n\nA Muscle is termed in Greek Mus a Mouse, because it resembles a flaid Mouse; and the Latins cal it Lacertus a Lizard, from its similitude with that Crea∣ture: Howbeit we cannot allot one certain figure to the Muscles, by reason of their variety.\n\nA Muscle is an Organical Part, the Instrument of voluntary motion. For only this part can receive the Iuflux of the motive faculty. Helmont allowes the muscles a life peculiar to themselves, which conti∣nues for a while, even after death, as the convulsive motion in the Falling-sickness which continues invo∣luntarily. Which nevertheless does more truly arise, from the retraction and driness of the Nerves, and de∣fect of Spirits. Also the same man is in an error in conceiving that new fibres do arise in the muscles, and cause the Palsie. No man ever saw them, nor can they be bred anew, because they are Spermatick parts. The Palsie ought rather to be referred to a defect of some fi∣bres.\n\nA muscle is an Organical part, be∣cause it consists 1. Of flesh. 2. Of a tendinous part (and these are the two parts of a muscle, which perform the Action) 3. Of Veins to carry back the Nutri∣ment. 4. Of Arteries preserving the inbred Heat, and bringing the Nourishment to the part. 5. Of Nerves, which contribute sense and especially motion. For the Brain sends the motive faculty through the Nerves into the Muscles. 6. Of Membranes which encompass and keep the muscles together. 7. Of Fat which moistens them, and hinders them from being dried by over much motion.\n\nThe Muscles of the whole Body are most straitly conjoyned one with another: Yet sometimes they gape, and are at some distance, when Wind, wheyish Humor, or some other mat∣ter gets between them; as in the ba∣stard Pleurisie, and concerning a Soldier whipt by the Turks. Veslingus told me that his muscles were so wi∣dened and separated, that if he bent his body but a lit∣tle, every muscle would bear it self out from its Natural situation, bunching out as it were, and swelling.\n\nWe divide the Muscles into two parts, a fleshy part, and a tendinous part.\n\nAgain, we make the tendinous part to be either united, or disgregated, and severed.\n\nUnited, where the whole tendinous part appears, white and hard, either in the beginning, end, or middle; or in all these parts.\n\nContrariwise it is disgregated or severed, where it is divided into many small fibres, scarce discernable to the sight, being compassed about with flesh▪ which ten∣dinous fibers may notwithstanding be discerned a∣mong the fleshy ones, in boyled Hogs-flesh, and in the flesh of a Turkey-cock, &c. So in some Muscles, es∣pecially 〈…〉〈…〉 of the Thighs of a Turkey-cock, the ten∣dinous 〈…〉〈…〉 appear whole and united from the begin∣ning to 〈…〉〈…〉. So in a man, somtimes the Tendon descends 〈…〉〈…〉 after its Original, mixe•• with flesh. Somtimes the tendinous part appears, united in the end, and severed in the beginning, as in the mus∣cle Deltoides; somtimes it is tendinous in the middle, and somtimes not at all.\n\nWith Aquapendent we define a Tendon to be a Body continued from the beginning to the end of a Muscle, and that it is a body of a peculiar Nature, cold and dry, made of Seed, as the principle of its Ge∣neration: But the beginning of its dispensation is a bone, for it springs from a bone, and is inserted or im∣planted into a bone. Yet some Muscles arise from Gristles, and some from Tendons, and are implanted into them. And it is rightly termed Tendo, from stretching, because it is bent and stretched like the string of a bow.\n\nA Muscle is otherwise divided into the Head, middle, and End.\n\nThe Reginning and Head of a Muscle, when it is tendinous, is by Galen and other Anatomists, called Ligamentum, which they say is void of Sense, and that it is less then a Tendon, or the end of a Muscle.\n\nNow the beginning in a great part of Muscles, is tendinous, sel∣dom fleshy. And to speak the ve∣ry truth, the beginning may as well be termed a Tendon, as the end; seeing for the most part, such as is the Beginning, such is the End, in Substance, in Thinness, Lightsomness, Whiteness, &c.\n\nNow every Muscle is said to move towards its beginning, and every Muscle hath a Nerve, which is inserted either into the Head, or about the middle (and in some through the Surface of the muscle, in others through the Substance) so that where the Nerve is im∣planted, there is the Head of the Muscle: Which Galen laies down as a sure Rule, and saith; that if the Nerve be implanted into the Tayl, there is the Head of the muscle. But Johannes Walaeus an excellent learn∣ed Physitian, likes not this Rule, and conceives that it is all one, whether the Nerve be in∣serted into the beginning, the middle, or the end. 1. Because that Rule renders the motions of many mus∣cles obscure. 2. Because it holds not true in the Pe∣ctoral muscle, nor somtimes in other muscles of the Chest and Belly. 3. Because that Rule is not found∣ed upon any reason, for whether the Nerve be inserted into the beginning of the muscle, or into any other part thereof, the Spirits flowing in by the Nerve, may equally move the muscle: As we see in Wind-Instru∣ments, the Air is let in somtimes above, somtimes be∣neath, one way as conveniently as another. 4. And whereas that Rule is oftentimes found true, it happens by accident, because mostmuscles are moved upward, & because the Nerves descend from above, and therefore could not be more safely implanted any where, then in the upper part of the muscles. And that which Riolanus objects against Walaeus, touching the Contorsion or Wreathing of the recurrent Nerve, is nothing. For the Nerves run back, to avoid confusion, otherwise, if Nature chiefly inten∣ded the Insertion into the Heads of Muscles, she might\n\ndescription Page 9\n\nhave carried them right out into the Larynx, as she doth other Nerves of the sixt Pair. Some Muscles receive two branches of Nerves, as the Midrif; some five, as the temporal Muscle.\n\nThe Middle of the Muscle, which they call the belly or body, doth for the most part swell, and is fleshy; some few have a tendon in the middle, as the Musculus Digastricus which opens the nether Jaw, and the second Pair belonging to the Os Hyoïdes.\n\nThe end or taile of a Muscle, is by some called Tendo▪ by others Chorda, and Apo∣neurosis. And the end is somtimes round, somtimes broad, somtimes long, other whiles short; somtimes one, other∣whiles more then one. Now this end, or tendon, is commonly conceived to be made up of a Concourse of Fibres, Ligaments, and very smal Nerves, which by little and little grow into one Body. For they will have a Nerve, when it comes to the place of a Muscle to be divided into divers slips, which are met by a Ligament, cleft after the same manner. Consequently they De∣termine.\n\n1. That the Tendon hath the sense of Feeling, but not the Head, which they account void of sense and Motion. But this is false; because the tendinous head of a Muscle, when it is prickt, breeds Convulsions and cruel Symptomes, just as if the Head of the Mus∣cle were prickt. Moreover, the beginning of a Muscle hath motion, and therefore sense. It hath motion, because a Muscle, even in its Head, is contracted and expanded, espe∣cially when it is fleshy.\n\n2. They say also that the End is thicker then the Head: which not∣withstanding is somtimes true and somtimes false, as in the Musculous Biceps, and others.\n\n3. They will have the Tendon to be softer then the Ligament (as they call it) or the beginning of the Muscle, namely so much softer, as it is harder then a Nerve, But the contrary is true, viz. that the Tendon is harder then the beginning, because it many times changes into a boney and gristley substance, as in the feet of feathered fowle; but the beginning doth not so. Moreover, I deny that Nerves enter into the Tendon. For Aquapen∣dent and Riolanus have observed, by fre∣quent dissections, that when they are entred into the flesh of the Muscle, they are spread out into many little branches, which go in∣to a certain Membranous flexure, and so vanish or end, before they come to the tendon. Moreover, a Nerve is soft, how therefore can it be mingled with an hard body? Neither is the end less destitute of sense, then the Head, seeing there come no more Nerves to it then the other: for the Nerve being implanted, tends downwards, and not upwards.\n\nThe Action of a Muscle is voluntary Motion.\n\nThe Motion of a Muscle, is three∣fold, 1. A Muscle is contracted within it self, towards the Head; and when this is done the opposite Muscle is relaxed and loos∣ned. 2. Being contracted, it continues so. And these two motions are primary, per se and not acciden∣tal. 3. After contraction it is relaxed▪ which motion is accidental, and proceeds from another. And there∣fore Muscles are alwaies set one against another, as Antagonists.\n\nNow the work of this Motion or Action, which is seen in the parts▪ whereinto the Muscles are planted, doth vary according to the Variety of Parts. For in the throat it is swallowing; in the Arme bending and stretching forth, &c. Yea and somtimes one follows upon another. For the Muscles of the Chest, when they act, do diversly widen or contract the same, they draw in Air, or expel Fuliginous sooty vapors, and cause Respiration.\n\nThis Motion of the Muscles, is somtimes called Voluntary, somtimes Animal, to distinguish it from the natural, in Brutes Spontaneous. For we can hasten, or slacken, or stop this motion as we please. And in this motion, the will of a Man or the Appetite of Brutes, is like an Horse∣man guiding and putting his Horse forward; the Nerves resemble the Reins of the Bridle, and the Mus∣cles are like the Horse. There are some singular Mus∣cles, as of the inside of the Eare, the Midrif, the Muscles of the Chest, and Eye-lids, whose motion is partly voluntary and partly natural, because they ma∣ny times perform their actions, when we have no thought nor will thereto.\n\nThe use of all the Parts of the Muscle, is after the same manner, as in every perfect Organ. For 1. There is that by which the action is primarily and of it self performed, and it is the Fibrous flesh; [but especially according to the Fibres, for the flesh being wounded according to the length of the Fibres, the motion remains unhurt, but it is not so▪ when the fibres are wounded] for the most part the belly of the Muscle▪ which is most of all contracted. Hence it is that if you cut a Muscle of in the beginning end or middle, in a living person, or in one that is dead it purses it self round and draws it self into it self like a ball: as also it doth, being cast into the water. Riola∣nus counts the principal part to be the tendon, upon which the Action depends, because it hath a peculiar substance of its own, such as is no where to be seen out of a Muscle. But this is rather true of fibrous flesh, which is in all Muscles, where as in some there is no tendon. 2. That without which it cannot be perfor∣med as the Nerve: For if the Nerves be hurt the Muscle looses its motion. 3. That by which it is more strongly and better performed, as the tendons and tendinous fibres. Wherefore those Muscles only, which perform conti∣nual and strong motions, have recei∣ved united and Conspicuous tendons. For the Muscles do either move them∣selves only, as those of the Fundament and Bladder; or they move also the skin, as in the Lips, forehead and face: and in these there is no tendon to be seen▪ or they move a bone, and these for the most part evi∣dently end in tendons, because the strong motion of an heavy member did require as much: or they move some other light thing, as the Muscles of the tongue and Larynx (some of which have tendons and some not) of the Eyes, Stones and Yard. 4. Such parts as conserve and guard the action, as the Veins and Arte∣ries, the Membranes and fat.\n\ndescription Page 10\n\nCHAP. VI. Of the Muscles of the Belly, or Abdomen.\n\nTHose which are called Musculi Abdominis, the Belly-muscles, do cover the lower Belly, and Galen reckons as many, as there are positions of fibres; right, transverse, oblique, and these either upwards or downwards. So that according to Galen there are eight, four on each side; two oblique descendents, or external oblique ones, two oblique ascendents or in∣ternal ones, two right and two transverse: But Massa found out two others, and after him Fallopius, which they term Pyramidal Muscles, others Fallopian Mus∣cles, and Sylvius calls them Succenturiatos. And so hither Anatomists have made these muscles ten in num∣ber. Casserius accounts the right Muscles to be many, and that rightly; seeing there are for the most part four of them on each side; and so for the most part.\n\n[illustration]\n\nThis TABLE represents the Oblique Descendent Muscle of the Belly out of its place, and the rest of the Muscles in their proper places.\n\nThe III.

Fon∣tanus found them all, folded and wrapped up in an Embryo or imper∣fect birth.\n\nThe first Pair obliquely descendent, [or the external] so called by reason of the Fibres, which descend obliquely from the upper to the lower part; covers all the Abdomen, on its own side, seeing it is very great and broad.\n\nIts original is in the breast, from the lower part of the sixt, seventh and eight Ribs, before they end in Gristles; and it arises from sundry triangular begin∣nings, or spires, [near the great saw∣shap'd Muscle of the Brest] which after∣ward grow into one. And to every triangular spire, from the spaces between its Ribs, and Nerve is carry∣ed. Moreover, it arises also [a smal space being inter∣posed] from the point of the transverse processes of the Vertebra's of the Loyns. So largly is the begin∣ning thereof spread out, namely from the sixt Rib to the lowest Vertebra of the Loyns.\n\nIt ends in the middle of the Abdomen, where a white line appears, and it ends into a large Tendon, an infinite company of ob∣lique Fibres running together in that place.\n\nNow the white Line, which is somtimes fringed with fat, is the meeting together of the Tendons of the Muscles of the Belly, saving those of the right muscles. For the Tendons of the oblique muscles are united. and do so meet form both parts, that they form as it were a coat which covers the Belly, or as if it were but one Ten∣don.\n\nIt is white, because void of flesh, proceeding from the Mucronata Cartilago or pointed Gristle which is sea∣ted at the Sharebone: and it is narrower below the Navil then above.\n\nThe two muscles obliquely descendent are bored through. 1. At the Navil. 2. At the Groyn in men, that the seed Vessels may pass through; in Women, to give passage to the two round and Nervy Ligaments of the Womb, which are terminated in the Privity near the Nymphes.\n\ndescription Page 12\n\nNow as touching the Original of the obliquely-descending mus∣cle, Aquapendant did long since hatch a contrary Opinion, which Laurentius did afterwards pro∣pound as new, and of his own In∣vention, reprehending all other Anatomists, who were the said miserably deceived. Now this contrary Opinion will have these muscles to be rather termed external Ascendents, so that their O∣riginal should be from the upper part of the Os pubis, Os Ilij, and from the transverse Processes of the Loins: And the end. in the Ribs. They prove it thus:\n\n1. Because a muscle ought to arise from some quiet and immoveable part, such as is the Share-bone com∣pared to the Ribs. I answer, the Ribs are quiet and still, being compared to the white Line.\n\n2. They say a muscle draws towards its beginning, and because the oblique∣descendent serves for Respiration, it draws the Ribs towards the Share. I answer, this muscle doth not primarily serve for Respiration, as I shall shew hereafter.\n\nNow our Opinion, which is Galens, is proved. 1. By the Ingress of Nerves, which is about the beginning. 2. By the carriage of Fibres, which go here from the beginning to the white Line. 3. All confess that there is a Concourse of Tendons, yea of those which obliquely descend, in∣to the white Line. Therefore the End is there. 4. It\n\n[illustration]\n\nThis TABLE presents the Obliquely-ascendent Muscle of the Belly, loosned from its Originals; the Transverse Muscle, and the she one straight Mus∣cle in its Situation, and the other with its Pyramidals removed from its place.\n\nThe V.

But we daily observe the Belly to be moved, in single per∣sons that are chast, nor doth Nature frame Parts to sup∣ply unexpected defects of muscles, but for Natural and Ordinary Actions. Spigelius suspects, that from the same moveable beginning, that same bone is drawn obliquely upward, and enclined toward the Chest, by the help of the muscles.\n\nThe second pare is the OBLIQUELY ASCENDENT [or internal] having Fibres contrarily situated: It is situ∣ated next the former, and hath a triangular Figure.\n\nIts Original is fleshy, from the Rib of Os Ilij: but membranous, both from the transverse Processes of the Vertebra's of the Loins, from which it receives Nerves, and from the sharp points of Os sacrum.\n\nIt grows a little by a fleshy End, to each of the bastard Ribs, and to some of the true Ribs, but the rest its End turns by little and little into a Tendon, which is double: The one part goes upon the right muscles, the other beneath, so that the right doth rest as it were in a sheath, but near the white Line it is reunited, and inserted thereinto. Which Riolanus hath observed to happen only above the Navil, and not beneath.\n\nThe third pare of the right Muscles, by reason of the right fibres. This pare is commonly reckoned to be but one.\n\nGalen doth rightly make the be∣ginning to be fleshy, arising from the Breast-bone, on each side of the Sword-fashion'd Gristle, and from the Gristles of the four bastard Ribs. It ends in a Tendon at the Os Pubis. Others contrari∣wise, will have the beginning to be here in the Share∣bone, and the End above. But I answer. 1. That the right Muscles receive their Nerves in the upper part, viz. one branch of those Nerves, which were inserted into the oblique descending Muscle, and o∣thers also from the last of the Back, and from the first pare of the Loins. 2. A Muscle uses not to have a tendinous beginning, and a fleshy End. Other late Anatomists will have the right Muscles to have two beginnings and two ends; one beginning and one end in the Breast, and another in the Share-bones. Who are for this Conceit of theirs, beholden to that new o∣pinion touching the moveableness of the Share-bone, of which I shall speak hereafter.\n\nThe Musculus rectus or straight mus∣cle, hath for the most part three. In∣scriptions in Persons of a middle sta∣ture, and somtimes four in tall people, whose Belly is long. But according to Carpus and Casserius, we say that suitable to the mul∣titude of Inscriptions, there are more muscles, because 1. To every Joynting there comes a Nerve. 2. If it were but one, being contracted into itself, it could not equally compress all parts. 3. There should be no such muscle in the whole body, wherein nevertheless there are many long ones, without such a number of Inscriptions.\n\nIn the internal Surface of the right muscles, there are two Veins conjoyned, with as many Arteries.\n\nThe upper called Mammaria, arise from the Vena cava, lying beneath the Claves, the more remarkeable branch whereof reaches unto the Duggs, and runs out under the right Muscle, as far as to the Region of the Navil, where it is terminated.\n\nThis is met by the other termed Epigastrica, which in Women springs from the Womb, in men the Vena cava goes upwards towards the upper Vein, which be∣fore it touches, it is for the most part obliterated. Yet these two Veins are somtimes joyned together by ma∣nifest Anastomosis, touching one another, at their ends. Hence the Consent is supposed to arise between the Duggs and the Womb, the Belly and the Nostrils. For when the Nose bleeds, we fix Cupping-glasses to the belly, and the Duggs of Women being handled, it in cites them to Venery.\n\nThe Musculi recti receive Arteries from the Epigastrica Artery, and Nerves which proceed from the last Vertebra's of the Chest.\n\nThe proper use of these Muscles according to Riola∣nus, is to move the Share-bone forward in Generati∣on, which hath been already confuted. Spigelius will have them to draw the Breast to the Ossa pubis or share∣bones, and the Share-bones to the Breast, in a straight motion, and so to bend the Chest; whence it is, that in Dogs and Apes, they reach as far as to the Jugulum, because their Chest did require very much bowing. But these contrary motions, unless they be holpen, with those incisions of the right muscles, do involve a difficulty. Helmont suspects that they are stretched in going up hill, and that from thence shortness of breath proceeds. Flud saith, that by a general use, they make the Belly round, and compress it centrally, or towards the middle point thereof.\n\nThe fourth pare called the Pyramidal Muscles, do rest upon the lower Ten∣dons of the Musculi recti. Nor are they parts of the right Muscles, as Vesalius and Colum∣bus think; but distinct muscles, as Fallopius proves with reasons, which are partly convincing, partly vain. But that they are peculiar muscles is hence apparent. 1 Because they are cloathed with a peculiar membrane. 2. Their Fibres are different from those of the Musculi recti.\n\nThey rise with a fleshy beginning, not very broad, from the external Share-bone, where also the Nerves do enter; and the farther they go upwards, the narrower they grow, till they terminate with a sharp point, into the Tendon of the transverse Muscle. And from this place I have ob∣served more then once, a small and round Tendon pro∣duced, as far as to the Navil.\n\nRiolanus hath observed the left Pyramidal Muscle to be lesser then the right, and when there is but one, it is oftner left then right.\n\nThe Use of the Pyramidal Muscles, is to assist the right muscles, in compres∣sing the Parts beneath. Hereupon according as the Tendons of the right muscles are more or less strong. so, sometimes the Pyramidal muscles are wanting (though rarely) somtimes they are strong, otherwhi∣les weak, and somtimes there is but one. Bauhine saith▪ If they are absent, then either the flesh joyned to the Heads of the right ones [which I have often observed] or the Fat performs their Office. And others will have them to be as it were certain Coverings of the right muscles.\n\nFallopius will have the Pyramidal 〈…〉〈…〉 to com∣press and squeez the Bladder, when •…•…e Water, that the Urin may be forced out. Con•…•…wise Aqua∣pendent will have it, that they raise and lift themselves up, and together with them the Abdomen and Perito∣naeum,\n\ndescription Page 14\n\nthat the parts beneath them, may not be too much burthened. Now Columbus charges Fallopius, that he would have these muscles serve to erect the Yard, whereas that is Massa his Opinion [whose O∣pinion is followed by Flud, because of the situation of these Muscles] but they cannot serve for that intent, be∣cause they reach not the foresaid part, and because they are found likewise in Women.\n\nThe fifth pare called the Transverse Muscles, being lowest in situation, do arise from a certain Ligament which springs out of the Os sacrum, and co∣vers the Musculus sacrolumbus, also from the lowest Rib, and the Os Ilij. They end by a membranous Tendon, into the white Line, and do stick extream fast to the Peritonaeum, every where save about the Share. The proper Use of these Muscles, is to compress the Gut Colon.\n\nThe Action of all the Muscles of the Belly, is as it were twofold. 〈◊〉〈◊〉 An e∣quable Retension and Compression of the Parts in the Belly: For •…•…y all act together, the Midriff assisti•…•…em, and this is the reason why the Fibres of all th•…•…s, do meet together in one and the same C•…•…ing as they are thus described by Robert E•…•….\n\n2. The Second Action 〈…〉〈…〉 vs up∣on the former, viz. the •…•…dance of Excrements. And because the num∣ber of parts to be compressed is great, as the Guts, Womb, Bladder; one Muscle could not suffice, but there was need of divers, acting in divers places, according to divers Angels: Right, transverse, oblique. Every part indeed hath an expulsive Po∣wer; but those parts which are hol∣low, and often, and much burthened, do need the help of these muscles; as in the Expulsion of Excrements, of Worms, of Urin, of a Child, of a Mole, &c.\n\nThese are their true Actions, which are apparent from their Fabrick. But Nature somtimes abuses the muscles, to move the Chest, when there is need of a great and violent Expiration, as in Out∣cries, Coughs, and the like. For then they do not a little compress the Chest.\n\nTheir Use. They are of an hot and moist Tempe∣rament. because flesh is prevalent in them: And there∣fore they cherish Heat and Concoction: They are mode∣rately thick; and therefore they defend the Parts, and are a Safeguard to them, even when they rest: Also they conduce to the Comlyness of the Body: And therefore extream Fat, dropsied Persons, such as are very lean, &c. are deformed.\n\nCHAP. VII. Touching the Peritonaeum.\n\nALl the Muscles of the Abdomen being removed, the Peritonaeum comes in sight, being spread over the Guts, and having its Name a circumtendendo, from stretchin•…•…ading about, because it is drawn o∣ver all 〈…〉〈…〉, which are between the Midriff and the Thighs.\n\nNow the Peritonaeum is a membrane which doth cloath the Bowels of the lo∣wer Belly.\n\nIt is a membrane, and that sufficiently thin and soft, that it may not be burthensom; but strong and compact, that it may be loosned and distended. It is thicker in Women, from the Navil to the Share, that it may stretch the more, when they are with Child; in men that are great Feeders especially, it is thicker from the Mucro∣nata Cartilago, to the Navil, Laurentius conceives for the Stomachs sake, which notwithstanding is hardly probable: for it was fit the lower part should be thic∣ker, least while we stand, it should become slackned and loosned by the weight of the Bowels.\n\nSome will have the Peritonaeum to be made of a li∣gamentous and nervous Substance; others of Nerves only; others only of Ligaments; others of the Coats of the Brain.\n\nThe Shape of the Peritonaeum is oval: For it is like a Bladder, or a long-fashio∣ned Egg. For it compasses all the lo∣•••••• Belly, and therefore it is answerable •…•…unto in Longitude and Latitude.\n\nIts Surface is inwardly smooth, and 〈…〉〈…〉 were daubed with moisture, by rea∣son of the Guts which it toucheth; without it is fibrous, and a little rough, that it may be fastned with the mus∣•…•….\n\nIts Original is at the Back-bone, at the first and third Vertebraes of the Loins, where the Peritonaeum is thicker; so that it cannot in that place be separated without breaking.\n\nIt is knit also above most closely to the Diaphragma (and therefore when it is inflamed, the Hypochondria are drawn upwards) beneath to the Share-bone and the Os Ilij; before, to the white Line and the Tendons of the transverse mus∣cles.\n\nNow it is in al places double (and Lau∣rentius with Cabrolius make al Membranes double, even the pia Mater it self) which notwithstand∣ing is most apparent upon the Back-bone, above the Navil it sticks so close, that its doubleness cannot be ••••seerned: But from the Navil to the Share, it is mani∣festly divided into two Coats, so distant, that in their capacious doubleing the Bladder is contained, which hath been observed by few: And that was so ordered. 1. That the membrane might be stronger there, where it is burthened. 2. That the umbelical Vessels, which run out there, may be carried more safely: For they pass through the Doublings of the Peritonaeum. There∣fore also.\n\nThe Peritonaeum is boared through before in a Child which is in the Womb: Also above it hath holes, where it grows to the Diaphragma, for the pas∣sage of the Vessels. Fernelius hath therefore done ill to contradict Galen, in denying that the Peritonaeum hath Holes. They are three; The first where Vena cava passes through; The second where the Stomach passes; The third where the great Artery and the Sixt pare of the Nerves do pass through the Midriff. Beneath about the Fundament, the Neck of the Bladder and Womb, and the Vessels which pass through the Peritonaeum to the Thighs, the Muscles of the Abdomen and the Skin.\n\nIt hath two oblong Processes or Pro∣ductions, like Pipes and wide Chan∣nels, descending in men, into the Cod, by the Holes of the Tendo••s of the oblique and transverse muscles, in which productions (call'd by the Ancients Didymi) the Seminary Vessels descend and run back, and near the Stone▪ These productions are more widened and become the Coats of the Testicles.\n\ndescription Page 15\n\nWhereof, if the outer Coat be wide∣ned, and the inner (which sticks most exactly, save by the Share-bone, where it is separated) broken, a Rupture is made, according as the Gut or Call, or both, slip down.\n\nIt receives Vessels from the neighbor∣ing Diaphragmatick, Mammary, and Epigastrick Vessels, and somtimes from the Seminary. It receives small Nerves, from those which are carried to the muscles of the Abdomen. And therefore the Peritonaeum hath the Sense of Feeling, contrary to what others have thought before Vesalius, against whom Experience also bears witness.\n\nThe USE of the Peritonaeum, is the same with that of membranes in general. 1. To contain the parts, and to send Connexi∣ons here and there. This the Perito∣naenm doth most of all: for it covers all the Bowels of the lower Belly, and makes them more firm; lengthens out, and bestows a Coat upon all of them, to some a thinner, as need requires, and to o∣thers a thicker, as to the Stomach, Guts, Bladder, and\n\n[illustration]\n\nThe Peritonaeum is here expressed, with its processes, under which the most of the Bowels of the Lower Belly discover themselves.\n\nThe VI.

This also, is an Office of the Peritonaeum, that Vessels which are to be carried a great way, do run along between the two Coats there∣of.\n\n2. To shut the Orifices of the Veins. Hence the Liver, if it were not covered with a membrane, the mouths of its Veins would come into veiw. Hence also those parts in which there are more Arteries, have received a thicker Membrane, as the Spleen. 3. To further the actions of the Muscles of the Belly; out of Galen.\n\nChap. VIII. Of the Call.\n\nUNder the Peritonaeum is the Call as it were a Covering, others name it Zirbus, Rete or Reticulum, by reason of the stragling course of the Vessels; the Greeks term it Epiploon the Top-swimmer, because it floates and swims as it were upon the Guts. For in all Living-Creatures it is.\n\nIt is situate at the Liver, Spleen, and Bottom of the Stomach, and from thence spred upon the Guts, whose turnings it involves and enters into. In some it ceases at the Navil, in others it reaches below the Navil, and somtimes to the Os Pubis where it is inferted: [Somtimes it is joyned to the Womb with a strait Connexion, as the rarely learned Mar∣cus Aurelius Severinus found at Naples in a Shee-Fool; and in another it was knit to the bottom of the Womb▪ in Venice when I was there] and when it comes be∣tween the bottome of the Bladder and of the Womb, the mouth of the Womb is thought to be compressed, and Women thereby made barren. In men an Epiplocele is caused, when it descends into the Cod. And because it is extended rather unto the left then the right side, therefore an Epiplocele of the left side is more fre∣quent. Epiplocele is a Rupture in which the Call falls into the God.\n\nMany times the Guts being left na∣ked, the Call lies lurking under the Li∣ver, which happens not from strangula∣tion,\n\n[illustration]\n\nThis TABLE expresses to the Life the Situation of the Guts and Call and the Navil Vessels.\n\nThe VII.

In Hydropical persons I have found it quite putrified. C. Stephanus unjustly de∣nies it to hunters.\n\nInfants, if we believe Rio∣lanus are distitute of a Call over their Guts, which as they grow is spread out downwards, and in declining 〈…〉〈…〉 it is again diminished. •…•…t hath two distinct Ori∣ginals from the Peritonaeum and is as it were a doubled Peritonaeum. 1. It arises at the stomach, viz. the bottome thereof. 2. At the Back and Gut Colon; and no beginning cleaves to another. Hence it hath two Walls or two Membranes, thin and light (that they may not be troublesome with their weight)\n\ndescription Page 17\n\nwhich lie one upon another: the external or former, which is tied to the outer membrane of the stomach at the bottom, and to the bunching part of the Spleen. The inner and latter, which is tied to the Gut Colon, and arises from the Peritonaeum, under the Midriff, just at the Back. And between these Walls, it hath a remarkeable Cavity: in which some very foolishly conceive the Natural spirit is contained. Riolanus will have it propagated from a production of the Mesentery, because if you separate the Membranes of the Me∣sentery, you may proceed as far as the Gut Colon; which he proves in another place, out of Hippocrates. But in vain, seeing the Mesentery it self, springs from the Peritonaeum, and he confesses the fourth part only of the Call to be Mesenterical.\n\nThe Figure thereof resembles that of a Falconders pouch, for the upper Orifice thereof is Orbicular, and the lower part of the Call is round after a sort, and somtimes un∣equal.\n\nThe magnitude thereof varies: for it pas∣ses in some men to the Navil, in others it goes further, as was said before. Natur∣ally it hardly exceeds the weight of half a pound, Riolanus observes. Howbeit Vesalius saw a Call of five pounds weight.\n\nThe Call hath this property above o∣other membranes, that through the sub∣stance thereof, very many Veins and Arteries are sprink∣led, from the Caeliacal and Mesenterical branches; and smal Nerves from a double branch of the sixt Pair. And by reason of the many Veins, there is much Fat in the Call: and between the same innumerable Kernels are interposed, which suck in and feed upon the dreggy humors. Which Fat I have often observed to have been molten in such as have been sick of Consumptive Feavers.\n\n[illustration]\n\nThis Demonstrates the Lower Membrane of the Call. Also the Mesentery with the Guts and Kernels adjoyned thereto.\n\nThe VIII. TABLE.\n\nThe Explication of the FIGURE.\n\nAAA. The lower Membrane of the Call, on which the Colon is suspended.\n\naaa.

By rea∣son of the plenty of its Fat it helps and che∣rishes the heat of the stomach, namely of the bottom thereof; for the upper part of the stomach is cherished by the Liver, resting upon it; also it cherishes the heat of the Guts, as being mem∣branous and blood-less parts. And therefore, that same Fencer whose Call was taken away by\n\ndescription Page 18\n\nGalen, was easily hurt by cold, and therefore he alwaies covered his Belly with Wool. The Call therefore is as it were a Pillow to the Stomach, and furthers Dige∣stion. For that is a rare case which Forestus relates of a young man, and Riolanus of others who lived well e∣nough, after their Calls were taken away: Peradven∣ture their Stomachs were some other way strengthened, or might be Naturally more strong then ordinary. O∣therwise ordinarily, by defect of the Call, Catarrhs, Loosnesses, Lienteries, Consumptions do arise.\n\n2. The Membranes afford this Use, that they prop up the Branches of a Vein and an Artery, which go unto the Stomach, Duodenum, and Colon Guts so called, and to the Spleen; also the Fat grows by bene∣fit of the Membranes.\n\n3. Walaeus supposes that Branches of Arteries and Veins are attributed in greater quantity unto the Call, then is requisite to breed Fat, and nourish the Call, and that they are there placed, being Branches of Venapor∣ta, that the greater quantity of Blood might return to the Heart.\n\nChap. IX. Of the Stomach.\n\nTHe Stomach called Ventriculus, that is a little Belly, is an Orga∣nical part seated in the lower Belly, just under the Midriff, being the In∣strument that makes Chyle. Paraeus observes that it hath through a Wound in the Midriff ascended into the Chest, and gone downwards by reason of the en∣crease of the Call. But Naturally;\n\nIt is seated in the Epigastrium, a place encompassed with no Bones, that it might stretch more easily, just under the Midriff, as it were in the middle of the Body, and it rests upon the Back-bone: Now its left side which is the greater and rounder in the bottom, lies in the left Hypochondrium, to give way to the Liver which lies on the right side, and that so the Body may be equally as it were poised, and ballanced▪ or trimmed, as the Watermen speak of their boats: Towards the right hand it grows small by little and little, that the meat may be gradually thrust thither. Whence we gather that it is better for such as lie down to sleep, to lie first upon their left side till the Digestion be finished, and af∣terwards upon their right, otherwise then is common∣ly imagined. But in the left side there is the bottom, where the meat ought to tarry, for being rowled to the right side, it is nearer passing out. Howbeit in this case, much must be allowed to Custom.\n\n'Tis only one in Number in man, and such live Creatures as have teeth in both their Jaws. Riolanus bath twice obser∣ved a double Stomach in a man, conti∣nued, but distinguished by a narrow pas∣sage out of one into another. Sperlinge∣rus saw the same in a Woman of Wittemberg▪ and Hel∣montius saw a bag full of stones which grew to the Sto∣mach. Yea, and that it hath been double in one that chewed the Cud, as Salmuth relates and others, is not to be doubted. In some Fowls there are two Sto∣machs, the one membranous, which the Latins term Ingluvies the Crap, which only receives the meat, that from thence being lightly digested, they may cast it in∣to the mouths of their young ones, whereas otherwise young Birds could not be nourished. The other is very fleshy and hotter, having within a hard Mem∣brane, wherein hard meat is received. Petrus Castellus a rare man, adds a third, which is in like manner fleshy. In Beasts that chew the Cud, and have Hornes, and teeth only in one Jaw there are four; The first Venter, the Re∣ticulum, the Omasus, and the Abomasus; of which Aristotle speaks. The Venter and the Reticu∣lum which is a part thereof, are ordained to hold the crude meat; The Omasus receives the Food immedi∣ately from the mouth, if it be thin, if thick, it is first chewed, and from hence after a short stay, it slips into the Abomasus. Now chewing the Cud, is a second chewing of the meat in the mouth, for the more perfect Digestion thereof, whence the Aliment proves excel∣lent, and for that cause among the Jews, such as chew∣ed the Cud were counted clean Beasts. Chewing the Cud is caused, not as some think, because the meat in the first Stomach gains such a quality, that it provokes the Stomach to cast it up; for so in every sharp biting of the Stomach, and in all Animals chewing the Cud, would happen against their Wills: but it depends up∣on the voluntary Action of the Stomach, which by a singular membrane, expels what it pleases, and when it pleases; as that some Tosspot of Malta, whom I have seen, would as he pleased cast up what ever he had drunk; and others will swallow down the Smoak of Tobacco, and turn it out again. In great Sea-fishes I have observed a threefold Stomach, as in a Porpice and others; but it grew so together, that there was ra∣ther three distinct Cavities with passages from one to another, three perfect Stomachs.\n\nIt hath two Orifices, and both of them in the upper Region of the sto∣mach.\n\nThe left is commonly called the upper Orifice, and somtimes singly the mouth of the Stomach, and som∣times tis termed the Stomach, because of its largeness; the Ancients did cal it Cor the Heart, because the Diseases thereof caused fain∣ting Fits▪ and other Symptoms like those which hap∣pen to such as are troubled with Passions of the Heart; also because of its most exquisite sense, and because the Heart doth sympathize therewith, both in regard of its nearness, and they have Nerves proceeding from the same Branch. This Orifice is greater, thicker, and larger, so that it may admit hard or half chewed meat. Tis situate at the eleventh Vertebra of the Chest: It hath circular fleshy Fibres, that it may by Natural Instinct shut up the mouth of the Stomach, after the meat is re∣ceived in, least fumes should arise, and go into the Brain, and breed Diseases; and that so Digestion may be more perfectly accomplished. So we cover it as we do our Seething-pots with a potlid, to keep in the Fumes, and to hinder the meat from falling back into our mouths, when we lie in bed, and tumble this way and that way. Through this Orifice, meats and drinks are received in. And it is but in the Epigastrick Regi∣on, and it is more near the Back-bone, then the sword∣fashion'd Gristle or Cartilago Ensiformis: And therefore when it is diseased, we apply Epithems rather behind then before. Helmont places the seat of the Soul, and the Principle of life in the Stomach, as it were in its cen∣tral point, so that it governes and rules over the Head and principal Faculties. If you aske him more particularly where it is placed, he will answer you that it is there after an exorbitant manner, centrally in a point, and as it were in the middle of an Atome of the thickness of one Membrane. But the Stomach cannot be\n\ndescription Page 19\n\nthe Seat of the Soul, because. 1. It is alwaies full of impure meats. 2. No Faculties flow to us from thence. 3. Great Feeders and persons of large Appe∣tite, should have more Soul then other people. 4. The Soul is not fixed to any Centre. 5. When the Sto∣mach is hurt, death doth not presently follow, as ap∣pears in him that swallowed the knife. And any dam∣mage happen, it is by reason of the Nearness of the Heart, and Community of Nerves, and consequently by accident. For the Soul sticks not in the Nerves primarily; but there rather from whence the Nerves have their Original▪ and it is a common Membrane. Yet in a large sense, it may be called the Principle of Life, because there is the Seat of Appetite, and the first Reception and Digestion of Aliments, whose fault in the following Concoctions, is never amended. Now it rules over the Head, by reason of the Consent of the Membranes, and the most undoubted arising of Va∣pors.\n\nThe right Orifice, commonly called the lower, is as far from the bottom, well near, as the left: It is narrower, and abides shut until the Digestion of the meat be finished, that is to say un∣til the meat be turned into a liquid Cream, or Posset as irwere. How∣beit Walaeus hath observed, that it may and doth let out the more liquid meats, and such as are of easie Digesti∣on, by peicemeal before the rest, which may easily be done by opening it self a little way, so that the thicker and undigested meats cannot pass through, as Riolanus objects, seeing they cannot pass through a narrow chink: This Walaeus I say observed in his Dissertion of Living Creatures. Helmont affirms that in Vomiting, it is shut upwards to∣wards the Pylorus, because it is incon∣venient to Health, that the faculent matter of Vomits should pass down∣wards. Yet he grants that it is some∣times opened between the first and other Vomits, when somwhat ascends out of the Guts. And the truth is, that it is also open to noxious Humors, Lienteries doth witness, and other fluxes of the Belly, Miserere mei, and other Diseases, which pass and repass through the Py∣lorus. The same Person beleives that it remains shut after Death, which doth, I conceive no otherwise happen, then as other parts are then stiff with Cold. It is a lit∣tle\n\n[illustration]\n\nThe Stomach-Nerves so called are Expressed.\n\nThe IX. TABLE.\n\nThe Explication of the FIGURE.\n\nA. The Stomach.\n\nB. The Gullet or Oesophagus.\n\nC.

But the Chylus by a Natural propension, affects to go downwards, nor doth it go the other way, unless com∣pelled] It is called the Pylorus or Porter, because it lets out the Chyle: It may be excee∣dingly dilated, even as also the left. Hence it is that ma∣ny examples testifie,\n\ndescription Page 20\n\nhow that very great things have been swallowed down, and voided out by Vomit, and by Stool; as Gold∣rings, Nut-shels, small Knives, Pebble-stones, peices of Iron, Frogs, Lizards, Serpents, whole Eels, Pipes, Coins, &c. The Pylorus rules o∣ver all the inferior parts, according to the Opinion of Helmont, being Moderator of Digestion: From the Indignation whereof, he fetches the cause of the Palsie, and Swimming Dizziness of the Head; and saith that a Flint having stopped the same, Want of Appetite, and Death it self followed. Salmuth saw Death caused by the Gnawing and Scirrhous Tumor thereof, which Evils depend up∣on viriated Concoction, or Digestion hindered.\n\nThe stomach hath three sorts of Fibres: straight, oblique, & transverse; which are conceived to serve for Attraction, Reten∣tion, and Expulsion. But some do per∣adventure more rightly determine, that the Fibres conduce to firmness and strength, as when we would have a peice of Cloath strong, we cause more threeds to be woven into it: Especially seeing many other parts, without these kind of Fibres do at∣tract, retain, and expel; as the Liver, Spleen, Brain, Stones, Lungs, Duggs. And other parts, as Bones and Gristles, though they have Fibres, yet do they not attract or expel any thing.\n\nThe Number of Fibres in the Mem∣branes is uncertain, through the vari∣ance of Authors. That the first or outmost Coat hath more right Fibres, and the second more transverse, is generally agreed upon by most A∣natomists. The doubt is touching the third or inner Coat. Galen, Abensina, Mundinus, Sylvus, and Aqua∣pendens, do allow it only right or straight Fibres. Ve∣salius saies it hath right Fibres towards the Cavity, and oblique in the outward part. Costaeus allows it only oblique. I with Fallopius and Laurentius, being led by Experience and Reason, do admit al kinds of Fibres in this Membrane.\n\nThe Surface is smooth without, plain and whiteish within, when the stomach doth purse it self, it appears wrinkled and somwhat reddish.\n\nIt hath a triple Membrane: The first common and external, springing from the Peritonaeum, and the thickest of all that have their Original from the Peritonaeum, though otherwise thin enough; which Petrus Castellus con∣ceives doth chiefly concurre in Vomiting. The se∣cond more fleshy, which is the middlemost, and hath fleshy Fibres to further Concoction. The third is lo∣west and nervous, into which the Vessels are termina∣ted, and it is continued with the Coat of the Oesopha∣gus, Mouth, and Lipps, that nothing may be received in, which •• ungrateful to the Stomach, and because the meat is prepared in the mouth. Hence it is, that when Choler is in the Stomach, the Tongue is bitter and yel∣low: And contrariwise the Diseases of the Mouth and Tongue are communicated to the Oesophagus and Sromach. This Coat is wrinkled, that it may be the bet∣ter dilated. And it hath its Wrinkles from a fleshy Crustiness sticking thereunto, the better to defend it from hard meats. This Crust is thought to arise from the Excrements of the third Concoction of the Stomach: and it is spungy, and hath passages like short Fibres, from the inner Surface to the outward; that the thinner Chylus may be the better detained till the End of Digestion.\n\nThe Substance therefore of the Stomach being mem∣branous and cold, is holpen by the Heat of the Neigh∣boring Parts. For the Liver lies over the right side, and middle part thereof; for it lies under the Heart-pit: At the left side lies the Spleen; it is covered by the fat Call: Under it lies the Pancreas or Sweet-bread; al∣so near it lie the Midriff, Colon-gut, the Trunk of Vena cava, and of the Aorta.\n\nThe Stomach is knit in the left part to the Midriff (not to the Back-bone) by its Orifice; therefore when it is over full, by hin∣dring the motion of the Midriff, it causes shortness of breath: On the right side it is joyned to the Gut Duo∣denum, by its other Orifice or the Pylorus.\n\nAt the Stomach, in the left side, under the Midriff, is formed a remarkeable Cavity enclosod with Mem∣branes, partly from the Stomach, partly from the Mid∣riff, and partly from the Call. Tonching this Cavity, that place of Hippocrates is to be understood in the 54 Aphorism of the 7. Section. Those who have Flegm shut up between the Septum transversum and the Stomach, which causes pain, and can find no passage into either of the Bellies, when the Flegm passes through the Veins into the Bladder, their Disease is cured.\n\nThe Shape of the Stomach is round and oblong, like ā Bag-pipe, especially if you consider it together with the Duodenum and Oesopha∣gus. In the Fore-part is is equally gibbous or bunch∣ing forth; in the Hinder-part, while it lies enclosed in the Body, it hath two▪ bunchings, that on the right hand being the less, and that on the left hand the grea∣ter, between which lie the Vertebra's of the Back, and the descending Trunk of the Vena cava and the Artery.\n\nIts Magnitude varies; commonly tis less in Women then in Men, that place may be made for the Womb when it swells. For Women are for the most part les∣ser then men, and yet not more gluttonous then Men, as Aristotle beleives, viz. being of the same size and equally healthy; yea, and they are inferior to men in Heat to digest and concoct. Also in gluttonous per∣sons and great Drinkers, it is greater then ordinary, so that when it swells, it may be felt as it were naked. For it is exceedingly dilated, and therefore it is thinner in Drinkers, in whom it is somtimes so attenuated, that it can no more wrinkle it self, whence follows long weak∣ness. Which Walaeus in Diffection hath observed to happen chiefly to those old men, whose Stomachs in time of Concoction do breed Wind; which often∣times also in gluttonous persons, takes up more room then their meat. Columbus will have it, when it is stretched, to reach as low as the Navil, and Archange∣lus will have it to reach further, when it is over stretch∣ed; but being contracted and wrinkled in such as live soberly, it is thick, and lies hid under the Liver. Now the Largeness of the Stomach is known. 1. By the Greatness of the Mouth, for those that have large Mouths, are great Eaters, but withal bold and magna∣nimous. 2. If from the Cartilago Ensiformis to the Na∣vil, the space is greater, then that of the Face or Breast.\n\nThe weight of the Stomach being dryed with the Oesophagus, according to the Observation of Loselius is two ounces and two drams; wherein notwithstan∣ding I have found a variety, according to the diversity of subjects.\n\nIt receives very many Vessels. Veins, as from the Spleen Vas breve, which is inferted, not into the mouth but into the bottom there∣of, and there insinuating it self into the tunicles, it\n\ndescription Page 21\n\ncreeps upwards between them, towards the Orifice: but before it reaches the same, it is obliterated; in some it is not visible, because of its smalness, in some it is quite absent [and therefore peradventure those persons have no good Concoction, or Nature Recompences that defect with other Arteries] in others I have seen it flourishing, with manyfold branches. And because it is implanted into the bottom of the stomach, and blood emptied there, cannot provoke Appetite, as many imagine. Others will have it that a Melancholick Excrement which could not be changed in the Spleen, is by this Vessel brought into the sto∣mach, that by its harsh and acid facul∣ty, it might further the stomachs Con∣coction, and make the meats abide therein, a convenient season. But Concoction should rather be hindred, by the casting in of a strange Excre∣mentitious Humor. If we shall interpret it touching an acid fermenting juyce, the Opinion will be truer, which kind of juyce, can come from no other place but the Spleen. For according to the Observation of Walaeus, the Spleen, especially of a Sow, being boy∣led and eaten, as coming nearest that of a man, doth wont to help the heavyness and dullness of the Sto∣mach. Hence sharp things are pleasing to the Spleen, and Hippocrates gives Vinegar to Spleenetick persons, and Celsus makes a Cataplasm for the Spleen tempered with the sharpest Vinegar. Moreover Riolanus hath found the left side of the inner part of the Stomach blacker then the right. Others suppose that nothing is carried into the stomach by the Vas breve, but that som∣what is carried out of the stomach into the Spleen; whether it be the thinner part of the Chyle, as Conrin∣gius, Horstius, and Regius prove, or Blood as Hogeland conceives; they being informed by Ligature in dis∣sections of live Creatures: of which hereafter.\n\nMoreover the stomach receives Veins from Vena Portae, viz. the Pyloric, Gastric, and Gastroepiploic branches left and right.\n\nThere is one notable Vein called Gastrica, which creeps a long the bottom of the stomach, but doth not quite touch it least the stomach being very much stret∣ched, it should be in danger to be broken; but it spreds many branches to the stomach: which Picolhomineus and Aquapendent will have to suck out the more thin and subtile part of the Chyle, before it passes out of the stomach to the Liver. And this Opinion seems prob∣able. 1. Because otherwise no reason can be given▪ of so sudden a passage, seeing they who have drunk much, do presently Piss it out plentifully. 2. Otherwise the stomach would be ready to burst, when it is overchar∣ged. 3. Thence it comes, that strength is so soon re∣paired by fragrant Wine, broaths, and other comfort∣able things.\n\nIn some Men a part of the Choler passage, is inser∣ted into the bottom of the stomach, by which our Country-men Petrus Severinus, would have choler to be carried into the stomach. But this is an Error of Nature, and therefore such persons are apt to vomit Choler, for they are exceeding Cholerick, such as Galen, Vesalius, Fernelius, and Casserius have observed. Such persons are said to be Picrocholoi ano, vomiters of Choler.\n\nThe stomach receives Arteries from me Caeliaca Arte∣ria, which accompany the Veins, not only for lifes sake, but that blood may be supplied from the Heart, for nourishment, for that the stomach should be nou∣rished with Chyle, is a false opinion and n"
