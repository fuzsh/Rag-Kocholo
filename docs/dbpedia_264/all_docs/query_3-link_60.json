Certaine Fashions of the Head, affe∣cted and contrived, by the Pragma∣ticall invention and Artificiall en∣deavours of many Nations.\n\nHIppocrates observes, that the Naturall mould or figure of the Head hath bin tampered with, and altered by Art. Sen∣nertus also, where he writes, De morbis Figurae, reckons a∣mongst other causes of the ill Conformation of Mens Heads, that they are now and then induced af∣ter\n\ndescription Page 2\n\nthe Birth, whilest the tender Heads of In∣fants, are by Midwives and Nurses formed af∣ter a divers manner, while they are involved in Head-bands, and moulded with their hands ac∣cording to their irregular and varying Phansies.\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nThe first Ce∣phalique Fashion∣mongers we read of, who offered this affront unto Nature, were the Macrones of Pon∣tus, so called, be∣cause there were found many Ma∣crocephali, that is, such Long Heads, as no other Nation had the like: A∣mong whom (of old) it grew into a Custome, that they were e∣steemed for the best Gentlemen, who had the lon∣gest Heads; Wherefore as soon as their New-borne Infants were entred into the World, they had a speciall care, presently, while their Heads were yet tender and soft, to presse them together with their hands, and fitting them to their minds, enforce them to increase in length: and lest that shoud not doe the feat, they bound them up with Head-bands and other apt Instruments; which by connecting and gathering in their ten∣der Heads, prohibited the roundnesse of their\n\ndescription Page 3\n\nHeads, and was a means to constraine them to grow and increase in length; whence, when they were come to mans Estate, they had all very Long Heads, so that at length it grew Naturall unto them: For, Nature finding her selfe justly agrieved at the Fantasticall restraint they impo∣sed on her, began to conspire with Custome, and so left them to their own vain invention, that there was no need of any Artificiall compulsion. But let us heare what Hippocrates recounteth of these sort of Men which he cals 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. The Scy∣thians (saith he) who inhabit Phasis, to be diffe∣rent from the vulgar, chose for a token of their Nobility to have a Head like a sugar-loaf. And to shape this Figure by Art, when the Child was Borne, the Midwives tooke care to bind their Heads with Swath-bands untill they were Fa∣shioned unto that forme; and this Artificialnesse grew to such force, as it was converted into Na∣ture: For, in processe of time all the Children that were Borne of Nobilitie, had their Head sharpe from their Mothers Wombe; so from thenceforth, the Art and diligence of the Mid∣wives therein became superfluous: but so soon as they left Nature to her Liberty and her own ordering, without oppressing her any longer with Art, she turned by little and little to reco∣ver againe the Figure which shee had before: So true is that, Naturam expellas furca, licet us{que} recurret.\n\nThe Cilician, Atticke, and Argive Women were noted of old, as the Phoxi were to have high turbinated Heads. The Women in Peru, al∣though\n\ndescription Page 4\n\nthey are gracious by their faire Faces, yet for the most part the tops of their Heads are ab∣surdly acuminated, and run into an acute Cus∣pis. Strabo makes mention of some Indians, who he cals 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, Capita cunei formia habentes, that is, having such Piked and Wedg∣like Heads. This Figure of the Head is in Fashion and Request at this day with some Na∣tions, being indeavoured with as much Art, as it was of old by the Macrones of Pontus. For, the Genuensians (for the most part) have high and copp-crown'd Heads, Pine-Apple forme, after the condition of a sharp upright Pillar, in such manner that the neather part is bigg and round, but the upper part sharp. And indeed, it is con∣cluded, that the Midwives with their Head-bands and other devises, are the cause of their Sugar-loafe-like Heads. This affected forme of the Head being common, and Nationall unto them, is re∣puted so Fashionable, that it is held a Note of Gentility and a Gallant Spirit among them.\n\nHippocrates notes, that an acute Head is alwaies naught, and verily, this compulsive force of Art is many times very Injurious to Nature and her opera∣tions, but not alwaies: for the Genuensians who delight much in this Figure of the Head, and are noted for the most part to have acuminated Heads, have at least such an acumen of Wit, as makes them excellent for an Active Life; and in the opinion of Claramontius, the form of the thing gives a suffrage unto it; for, such a kind of turbinated Figure repre∣sents a certaine parvity, and therefore the Heat of the Heart is lesse broken by it, whereupon Man is\n\ndescription Page 5\n\nrendered more Active. And therefore in this place we must admit what Hofman gives us to know: That so long as the Actions of the Braine are not hurt, it is only a Naturall or Artificiall fault or imperfection, no disease, but when they are hurt, then it is a dis∣ease as it was in Thersites, who was 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, and withall a Foole, and so sick of this Fashion.\n\nFor the truth is, as to the signes Diagnostick, a vitious Figure of the Head is known by sight, which although it doe chiefly declare the Conformation of the skull, yet it is likely and agreeable, that the Braine which is concluded in the skull, should Participate of the same Figure, but the discovery of it is made also by certaine effects; and it is easie to know the innate folly bred in some Men, by the vitious Figure of the Head. Yet Scaliger gives another Character of these Genuensians, which Imports that they pay for their Affectation: The Genuensians saith he, ha∣ving received from the Mauritanians their Proge∣nitors this Custome, to compresse the Temples of their Infants as soon as they are Borne, now, without that Compression, are Borne with a Thersiticall Head and Heart.\n\nWe read in the Chronicles of the Prodigious Ostents, that Nature hath many times mocked Art in produ∣cing this Figure of the Head. For, Licosthenes writes that in Ploa a Towne of Voitland, there was a Monstrous Infant Borne, with such an acumina∣ted Head, like a Cap that the Kings of Persia, and the Priests in the old Law used, or like a Tiara or Tur∣kish Tuffe: and in Saxonie in the Month of Febru∣ary 1545, there was another Infant borne with a Long Head, notably marked as it were with a Tur∣kish\n\ndescription Page 6\n\nCap. The Samaritans also (as I am Informed by a Learned and Observing Traveller) have such Sugar-Loafe-like Heads; There being a Colledge of Samaritan Secular Priests in Rome founded by Pope Gregory the thirteenth, who have all such Heads, and this Figure of the Head, it seems, is so Gentilitiall to a Samaritan, that they are apt there to suspect those Collegiates not to be true Samaritans, whose Heads are not so exactly moulded to this Figure: Nor is this as a private and particular Observation, bounded with in the Wals of this Colledge; For I have had great discourse with some Merchants that have been great Travellers, who told me, they have a kind of Physiognomy to discerne of all Nations by the figure of their Heads, which Observation is raised upon this ground; that whereas every Nation have diffe∣rences of manners by which they are easily discerned one from another, insomuch as you may know of what discent from any Nation any one is, either by his Voice, Speech, Discourse, Policy, Conversation, Diet, Affaires, Love, Hatred, Anger, and man∣ner of Warfare and such like Exercises: so every Na∣tion, whether Civill or Barbarian, hath not only Peculiar Customes and Rites, but also Peculiar Affecta∣tions of Forme or Shape of their Bodies, which will be Abundantly discovered by a world of strange Artifices and Pragmaticall endeavours Practised in this History, even from the Head to Foot, all tending to Accomodate their Affectations with the Pride and Vanity of such unnaturall distinctions.\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\nThe Women of\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nSiginnus a City of Egypt, are reported to have great care that they may seeme to have most Long Heads,\n\nThe Low-Coun∣try-Men or Dutch of Belgia, have some what Long Heads; which with them is the most Fashiona∣ble Figure, this their Mothers cause, being carefull to bring them to it, laying them when they are Infants, and wrapt in swadling Cloaths in their Cradles, suffering them to sleep most upon their sides and Tem∣ples.\n\nThe Portugals have generally long Heads, which happen by the same Artifice of the Mid∣wives; for as God makes, so the Midwife shapes; and shee is directed by the Mother and Women present at her Labour and lying in, who all will be sure to put the Midwife in mind of moulding the Childes Head to the Fashion most in request. Some also by an affected or an enforced thin Di∣et have attained unto the same badg of Gentility; For, that will doe it as Hippocrates affirmes, for thereby the Temporall Muscles being dryed up, the Temples become thereupon hollow; And so their Heads seem longer, the proportionate\n\ndescription Page 8\n\nLatitude of the Head being thereby diminished.\n\nThis affectation of Nurses in divers Regions and Families, practised upon a supposition of conferring Beauty upon Children, and their streight binding their Heads to force them to the Formis; Sennertus and Hildanus both take Notice of and condemne. For by the compression of the Skull, and that thus exten∣ding of it in length, the Braine, together with its Ventricles are compressed, whence, the Spirits not sufficiently prepared and well wrought, the Head is weakened, and made obnoxious unto Cathars; and if such Children grow up to Adolescency (which yet happens very rarely) they prove to be of a slower and duller Wit, that old saying being manifestly verified in them, Malas artes Inventoribus malè cedere.\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nThe Germans have short Heads for the most part, such Heads being in repute among them; which they attaine unto by their Mothers or Nurses care, who lay them in their Cradles when they are Infants, so that they alwayes sleep upon their Backs, their Hands for the most part left out unswathed, being tied on both sides on the Cradle.\n\nThe Men of Brasil have flat Heads, the hinder part not round but flat, which may very well\n\ndescription Page 9\n\nbe imagined to proceed from some Affectation or Fancie, that they have of such a forme of the Head.\n\nThe inconveniences that many times attend this affected Fashion of the Head, when the Nape with a little bunchines remaineth not, but the Nodock is made flat are, that the Brain is not so Figured as is requisite for Wit and Hability; For, the depression of this posterior prominency of the Head, weakens the Habilitie to Action, as Galen shewes; the reason is, because Voluntary motion depends upon the Nerves, whose princi∣ple the Cerebellum is: Since therefore the Origi∣nall and chiefe Instrument of Voluntary motion, resides in the hinder part of the Head, Men are by this depraving the Figure of their Heads, made more cold and indisposed unto motion, and so likewise unto recordation, the After-Braine, the seat of Memory being thus perverted. Which effect was observed (as Benivenius reports) in the dissection of one James a Famous Thiefe, the hinder part of whose Head, where the seat of Memory is, was found so short, that it contained but a very little portion of Braine; for which cause, when he could least of all remember the Bani∣shments, Imprisonments and Torments he had suf∣fered for his former Villanies, falling like an im∣pudent Dog to his Vomit, was at last Hanged, which put an end to his Life and Theft to∣gether.\n\ndescription Page 10\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nThe Greeks of old were noted to Love and affect a round Head, as sutable and best agreeing with those that spake ore rotundo; and it was so Fashionable a Fi∣gure with them of old, and so nouri∣shed by Art, that Pericles the Atheni∣an (who as Plu∣tarch writes) had a long Head in Fashion of a Mallet, which is the most exact and Naturall forme, was de∣rided for it by the Comedians of his Time, and the Attick Poets call'd him Cynocephalum, that is, Dogs-head. The Attick Poets call him Schinocephalos, as much as to say, as Hea∣ded like an Onyon; for those of Attica doe sometimes name that which is called in the Vulgar Tongue Scilla, that is to say, an Oni∣on of Barbarie, or the Sea Onion, Schinos. Phylocles the Comick Poet cals him Oxycepha∣lum, scoffing at his coppid crown'd Head, which appeared like the head of a Lapwing. Among the rest of the Attick Poets, Cratinus hath never done playing upon Pericles for this deformity, Comically jesting, at his Monstrous joulting Pate, sir-naming him joult-Head, and Onions-Head, or as we would say, Squil-Head, and it was held so great a reproach unto him,\n\ndescription Page 11\n\nthat the Statuaries that made his Statute, to hide this supposed deformitie, or rather want of con∣formitie, alwaies made him with a Helmet upon his Head: Whereby you may see how ridiculous a thing it is to have a Head out of Fashion.\n\nAt this Day the Grecians and Turks have round Heads much resembling a Globe, which they af∣fect and nourish by Art in their Children, as holding it the most commodious forme to fit their Turbants and Shashes which they weare on their Heads.\n\nThe Antuerpiensians have also round Heads, which is a Comely Fashion as they think, and in good repute among them.\n\nThe Virgins of Bruxels, likewise for the most part are round-Heads, but only that they have a sharper Chin. The French are observed to have their Heads somewhat Orbicular, to which their disposition and Naturall temper is Analogicall. And the unnaturalnesse of the Figure leads us to suspect the Artifice of the Nurses hand to con∣curr to their conformation, therefore the French Haberdashers being furnished onely with Hats proportionable for such Heads, have much adoe to fit an English Mans Head with a Hat, inso∣much as when they fall upon this difficulty, they are wont to tell him, that his Head is not A-la-mode.\n\nAll that they gaine, who thus Trespasse against the Justice of Nature, enforcing their Heads to a Sphericall form, or, through roundnesse, is, a quick moving, unstablenesse, forgetfullnesse, small discre∣tion and little Wit. For the Motion of the Spirit\n\ndescription Page 12\n\nnever ceaseth nor resteth, as in many French Men and Spaniards, and the like in certaine Germans, hath been observed and noted. For when the forme of the Head is through round, then is the middle Ventricle large, and the Spirits working in the same so large, untill these finde a large place, which in the meane time are not sufficiently united: and in such wise is the vertue Estimative weakened, by that the Spirits are carried round about the bounds of the same; insomuch that such Men having the like for∣med Heads are ill reported of for their proper qua∣lities and conditions in Physiognomie. Albertus Magnus (indeed) commends a round-Head, and would have Boyes loved that have round Heads, be∣cause that is the most Noble Figure: Therefore, Nur∣ses saith he are wont to compresse and endeavour to make Boyes Heads round, which hence seems to have been accustomed either in Padua or Ratisbone.\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nThe Muscovites, who are for the most part of a square proportion, broad, short and thick, have broad Heads, which is in Fashion with them at this Day. And when they are young Infants, and in their tender Age apt to be drawn and bent to any shape, their Faces are explained and flatted by Art, and\n\ndescription Page 13\n\nso directed to grow into this Gentilitian forme.\n\nThe Apichiqui, Pichunsti, Sava, People of the Indies, affect the same mad Gallantry of a broad Head and platter Face; to bring their Children to which Affected deformity, they lay one board on the Forehead and another on the Neck, so keeping them in press from Day to Day untill they be foure or five Yeares old.\n\nThe Women of\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nCumana affect a ve∣ry long Head and Face, as accoun∣ting it the most comely and Beau∣tifull Figure of the Head. A long Face and thin Cheekes being their chiefe Beauty. To attain unto which desi∣red Deformity, they gently com∣presse the Heads of their Infants between two lit∣tle Pillowes to extend them. Such contradicti∣ons there is in the Phantasies and opinions of Men and clashings in point of Elegancy in the Figure of the Head, that we may well cry out with Pliny, that there is no thing so vaine and so Proud as Man.\n\ndescription Page 14\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nIn the Province of Old Port in the West-Indies there are men that have a square-Head, so made by Art. For they to bring their Childrens Heads to this Fashion (no doubt) in great re∣quest with them, put them between Boards when they are new Borne, which being tender & yong, are enforced to grow after the Forme of that square wooden Box that encloseth them on every side. And this Art passeth at length into a kind of Nature, by long succession.\n\nThe Geometricall pates of our Square-headed and Platter-faced Gallants, is a new Contrivance: For, these Fashions of the Head were not knowne and discovered in the time of Galen, nor the violation of this Artifice practised; Galen reckoning up the foure unnaturall Figures of the Head, the first, where the Anterior eminency is lost, the Posterior remai∣ning in good case; the second, when the hinder Emi∣nency or out-shoot is wanting, the Frontall Jettie safe; the third, when both of them are missing; the Fourth when the Temples are Eminent, the Occiput and Sinciput depressed, saies for this last Figure, it may be imagined, but not possibly be found, against which Vesalius opposeth himselfe, alledging both Autho∣rity and Experience; the Authority is of Hippocrates,\n\ndescription Page 15\n\nwho (as he saies) writes, that the Head sometimes doth more remarkably protuberat at the Eares then either forward or backward. His Experience is taken from Three, Whereof the First he saies he saw at Venice, another at Bononia, a Third at Genua; Against him againe Fallopius opposeth him∣selfe, and as for Hippocrates he saith, that for this cause he had read Hippocrates through twice, and could never finde any such thing, and for the Expe∣rience, he had seen the Venetian Boy, who had not this Fourth Figure. To Hofman it seems that this ought not to be accounted among the unnaturall or unvaletudinarie Figures; For, not insisting upon these Occidentall Indian square-Heads, above pre∣sented, he findes Conciliator to write, that he had seen two, nay measured their Heads, and to have found a greater distance from one Temple to the other, then from the Occiput to the Sinciput. Hugo Senensis also had seen this Figure, as Th. Veiga testifies: and Petrus Martyr saies, he saw such a Boy at Mi∣lane. At last, Hofman agrees with Galen, that such are Monstrous, rare and invitall.\n\nAnd verily these square-Headed Gallants must needs suffer some dammage in their intellectuals by this affectation; for Physiognomers affirme, that a Head that hath Angles argues an impediment of Judgment and ratiocination. For even as an Eccho is lesse op∣positely formed in Angular Buildings, then in an Arch or winding Rounds; So the Vigour of Judg∣ment is more flourishing in a Skull, Naturally round, then in Heads knotty and Angular. And therefore Man Naturally hath a great Advantage over o∣ther Creatures in the roundnesse of his Head; for al∣though\n\ndescription Page 16\n\nin the Fabrick, all Creatures seem to an∣swer one generall Rule, although they are of divers species and use, yet by the wonderfull Device or In∣vention of God (as Lactantius speaks) there is one Similitude of frame in all, for, one disposition and one Habit produceth an innumerable varietie of Li∣ving Creatures; For in all Creatures, that Breath, for the most part, there is the same Series and order of Members, nor do the members onely observe and keep their Tenor and Scituation, but also the parts of the Members; for in one and the same Head, the Eares, the Eies, the nostrils, the Mouth also, and in the Mouth, the Teeth and Tongue, possesse a certain place, which being the same in all living Creatures, yet there is Infinite and Manifold diversity of Figures, for that they are either more produced or contracted, or compri∣sed in lineaments variously differing. As for Ex∣ample; the Head in other Creatures is formed after a Triangular manner, and whereas it ought to be round in Man, these Nations distending the orbicularity of their Heads, change it into an Angular Body, thereby, to the great affront of Nature and abasement of the Humane Forme, maintaining a greater Analo∣gie between them and bruits then ever she intended. If any accidentall depravation of the Head resem∣bling this affected Irregularity, threaten prejudice to the operation of the intellect, the mischiefe may be prevented in Infants, by the Physicall Corrector or Cosmetique Chirurgion, whose Office it is to preserve what is according to Nature, and in case of misprision to reduce unto the Naturall state, the endeavour of which, Art hath succceeded happily to many. Dr. Ga∣renciers told me he knew a Child that through the\n\ndescription Page 17\n\ndifficulty of Birth and the usuall accidents of hard Labour, his Head was so compressed and driven into a kinde of Angularity, that they much suspected some detriment would thereby accrew unto his understan∣ding; yet by the Midwives and Nurses care, who indeed have the onely opportunity to officiate in this businesse (I would they had as much judgment and a∣bility for the place) the Childes Head recovered the Naturall shape, and it proved to have a very good Wit and understanding.\n\nMany have held\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nOpinion, that Me∣gasthenes, Pliny and Aulus Gellius were loud liars, when they wrote and published that there lived a certaine kinde of People in Scythia which had Doggs Heads; and, verily although Pliny hath been by some in∣credulous and Igno∣rant Men Pater Mendaciorum, and an impudent lyar; yet I have somewhat of his to shew not onely for his truth but also for his Modesty: for when he comes to write of the strange and wondrous Shapes of sundry Nations, he doth advertise the Readers of his History, that he will not Pawne his credit for many things that he therin delivers, nor binde them to believe all he writes as touch∣ing strange & Forrain Nations, refer them rather\n\ndescription Page 18\n\nhe doth to his Authors, whom in all points (more doubtfull then the rest) he cites and alledges, whom they may believe if they list, onely he would not have them think much to follow the Greek writers, who from time to time in this be∣halfe have been more diligent in penning, and more curious in searching after Antiquities.\n\nAnd although the Author of the Treasurie of Times, indeed holds this for a Fable, because all those Countries have been discovered, and doe declare no deformity on the Peoples Bodies: yet the relation is confirmed by some of the or∣der of Predicants sent as Legats from the Apo∣stolique State unto the Tartars, who assure us that there are a certaine Nation in Tartary who have a Dogs-Face; the same Authors adding withall, that although the Men have such a re∣semblance of a Dogs-Head as beforesaid, yet the Women have a Humane Visage as other Women in the World have. Therefore there is such a Nation, the Authors being many and considerable who affirme it, and Kornmannus assents thereto, conceiving the relation to be true, insomuch as it were a shame for any Man to be refractorie in point of beliefe, and not to afford Credit to so Evident a truth. For although this Nation of Men hath been accounted by ma∣ny among the Types and Fabulous Narrations of the Ancients, yet in these latter Times we have received credible Intelligence of such kind of Nations newly found. Johannes de Plancarpio and Ʋincentius Burgundius make relations of Nations lately discovered having such Dog-like-Heads.\n\ndescription Page 19\n\nOdericus Poster affirmes, that in Nicoverra a City of India there are men that have Dogs-Heads, in the Isle called Macumeran, which is a great Isle and a faire, the Men and Women, who are rea∣sonable, have Heads like Hounds.\n\nMarcus Paulus the Venetian assures us, that there is an Island named Daganian, (Kornmannus cals it Anganian) the Inhabitants whereof have Heads like unto Dogs, and live by feeding on Humane Flesh; and Pausanias delivers unto us a relation of one Euphemus by descent a Carian, who saw such People in the Islands of the Oceans, when he was driven thither by a Tempest as he was sailing into Italy.\n\nThat testification also that Aristotle gives of Pig∣mies, is much reverenced by Johannes Camers, Hector Pintus, and (of the Ancients) by Isidore, as affording good ground of probabilitie, of the being of a Nation of Cynocephali, or Men with Dogs-Heads, and they are reported to be Negroes inhabiting a Mountaine neere the River Indus, and so numerous, that there are an hundred and Twenty Thousand of them, being called by the Indians Calistrios, which the Greeks would call Cynocephalos, id est, Canicipites. Indeed the Histo∣ricall truth is much embased by many vain ap∣pendices, as that they bark and howl like Dogs, and so understand one another, having no other Lan∣guage, that they have Teeth greater then Dogs Clawes, but longer and rounder; that although they cannot speake, they make signes with their Hands and Fingers, as Deaf and Dumb men use to doe, that both the Men and Women have\n\ndescription Page 20\n\nTailes at their Rumps like to Dogs; but that they are greater and thicker of haires, that they en∣gender with Women more Canino, accounting any other way of Copulation shamefull; all which Additaments are more advantagiously read then believed.\n\nBy what meanes these Natives might come to be thus monstrously deformed, and the shape of their Heads to degenerate into the similitude of a Dogs-Head, shall be sufficiently declared in our succeeding Face-moulders Scene, where wee shall present the Cynopro∣sopi or Men having a Dogs Face. The Artifice used being as I probably conjecture, the same in both.\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nAncient Writers have spoken of Ace∣phali, or a headlesse Nation. Mela writes that the Blemii are Headlesse, and have all the parts of their countenance in their Breast. Solinus deli∣vers the same thing: there are saith he who want their Necks, and have their Eyes in the Shoulders. And before these Authors, many have written the very same thing; whom Aulus Gellius reckons up. Pliny in open words doth frequently assert the same, for he delivers that their Heads are wanting, their Mouth and their Eyes affixed in their Breasts, and not far from the Troglodytes\n\ndescription Page 21\n\nthere are certaine Men that have no Neck, having their Eyes in their Shoulders.\n\nSr. John Mandevil reports, that in one of the Iles belonging to the great and mighty King of the Iland Dodyn, there are Men that have no Heads, and their Eyes are in their Shoulders, and their Mouth is on their Breast. He gives their originall, Cham (saith he) took the best part East∣ward that is called Asia, being the mightiest and Richest of his Brethren, and of him are come the Pannim folke, and divers manners of Men of those Iles, some headlesse, and the other Men disfi∣gured. And because some things spoken by him might seem strange and scarce Credible, there∣fore he thought good to make known to all that will see more proofe hereof in his Book called Mappa Mundi, there they shall finde the most part of the same ratified and confirmed.\n\nSt. Augustine makes commemoration of such a Nation, and although he there doth not im∣pose a necessity of believing the Relations that are made of such kinds of Men; so he seems to grant that it is not incredible; Nay, he testifies, that he had seen them himselfe, for he assures us in these words: I was now Bishop of Hippo, and with certain servants of Christ, I Travelled to Aethiopia to preach the Gospell of Christ unto them, and we saw there many Men and Women, having no Heads, but grosse Eyes fixed in their Breast, their other Members like unto ours; which place of August. Fulgosus cites to the same purpose.\n\nBut let us heare, Sr. Walter Rawleigh his rela∣tion of this kind of transformed Nation; the Ewai∣panomi\n\ndescription Page 22\n\nsaith he are a strange headlesse Nation, for on the Banks of the River Caora are a Nation of People, whose Heads appeare not above their Shoulders, which though it may be thought a meere Fable, yet for my own part I am resolved it is true; because every Child in the Province of Arromaia and Comurs affirme all the same: they are call'd Ewaipanomi, & are reported to have their Eyes in their Shoulders, and their Mouths in the Middle of their Breasts, and that a long traine of haire groweth backward between the Shoulders. The Son of Tomawari, which I brought with me into England, told me, that they were the most mighty Men of all the Land, and use Bowes, Arrowes, and Clubs, thrice as bigg as any of Guiana, or of the Oronoqueponi, and that one of the Iwarawakeri, tooke a Prisoner of them the Yeare before our arrivall there, and brought him into the Borders of Aromaia his Fathers Coun∣try. And further when I seemed to doubt of it, he told me that it was no wonder among them, but that they were as great a Nation, and as common as any other in all the Provinces, and had of late Years slain many hundreds of his Fathers People, and of other Nations their Neighbours; but it was not my chance to heare of them, till I was come away, and if I had but spoken one word of it while I was there, I might have brought one of them with me, to put the matter out of doubt. Such a Nation was written of by Mandevill, whose reports were held for Fables many Years; and yet since the East-Indies were discovered, we find his relation true of such things as heretofore\n\ndescription Page 23\n\nwee held incredible; whether it be true or no, the matter is not great, neither can there be any profit in the imagination; for my own part, I saw them not, but I am resolved that so many People did not all combine, or fore-think to make the report. The Translator of the History of Congo written by Pigafetta hopes, that in time, some good Guianean will make good proofe to our Eng∣land, that there are this day headlesse Men. And if any make Conscience to joyne Faith to these things upon these relations, yet they ought not to think this wonder impossible, especially being certified by such Authors as are here alledged.\n\nFor these strange Histories of Monstrous Na∣tions, which in Pliny and other Ancient Authors I have heretofore counted vain, do now require and deserve some Credit: since in these times there is a new Nature revealed, new miracles, a new World, full of strange varieties and sin∣cere novelties. Dr. Franasus Hernandus, who by the Command of Philip the second, sailed to the new World to discover the condition thereof, whose manuscripts are kept in the Kings Libra∣ry of St. Laurence in the Escuriall, and other Ma∣nuscripts sent to the King of Spaine about the af∣faires of India; by the Advantage of which, Euse∣bius Neirembergensis was inabled to write his new History of Nature, doe justifie these and stranger relations of divers kind of men among the Indi∣ans, in stature, disposition, forme, and deformity, as Monstrous as these Acephali or headlesse Nati∣on. Avicen was so bold to affirme, that after the immense inundations of the World, not only\n\ndescription Page 24\n\nmankind, but all other Creatures were produced from the tabid Carcasses by the Celestiall influx without seed; which is a thing no wise man can be brought to believe, that so Noble a Crea∣ture should arise out of a putrid matter, about whose Creation the whole Godhead was em∣ployed, wherefore so great and Beautifull a worke that was worthy of the Divine Labour, could not spontaneously proceed, it being most unlikely that Man being Compos mentis, which is a particle of Divinitie, should result from so vile an originall. St. Augustin, where he speaks of these Acephali and other Monstrous Nations, somwhat better resolves the doubt of their Ori∣ginall; It is demanded (saith he) whether Noahs sonnes, or rather Adams (of whom all Mankind came) begot any of those Monstrous Men; and he concludes, that whatsoever he begot that is Man, that is, a Mortall reasonable Creature, be his forme, Voyce, or whatever, never so different from any ordinarie mans, no Faithfull Person ought to doubt that he is of Adams Progeny: yet is the Power of Nature shewn and strangely shewn in such. God made all, and when or how he would forme this or that he knowes best, ha∣ving the perfect skill how to Beautifie the Uni∣verse by opposition and diversity of parts; but he that cannot contemplate the Beauty of the whole, stumbles at the deformity of the part, and not knowing the Congruence that it hath with the whole. Yet God forbid that any one should be so besotted, as to think the Maker erred in these Mens Fabrick, though we know not why he\n\ndescription Page 25\n\nmade them thus, be the diversity never so great, he knowes what he doth and none must repre∣hend him; therefore what Nations so e're have shapes differing from that which is in most Men, and seem to be exorbitant from the Common forme, if they be definable to be reasonable Creatures and Mortall, they must bee ac∣knowleged for Adams Issue. But St. Austin here speaks more like a Divine then a Philoso∣pher; for although the supreame efficient and supernaturall cause of Monsters is God, and that when Nature seems to deflect from the common Law established, shee is rapt by a Divine force, and there is aliquid Divini in the peculiar cause of these transfigurations of the Humane forme, and that the finall cause of these prodigious appa∣ritions may be the anger of God, who is no way bound to the Law of Nature, and who in revenge for some crime committed, may transforme a Man as he did Nebuchadnezzar, or give over a self-deformed Nation, to the vanitie of their own inventions; yet it sounds very harsh to the princi∣ples of our Philosophie, that the God of Nature should be so glorified by such strange apparances, that evill and imperfect Creatures should con∣curre to the perfection of the universe, since they have no reference to the Beauty of the World: because the Beauty of the universe consists in things perfect and permanent, and Monsters, (qua∣tenus Monsters) being nothing but defects and pri∣vations, can contribute no perfection, and so consequently appertaine not to the Beauty of the\n\ndescription Page 26\n\nuniverse; if they did conferr any ornament, they should for the most part be produced, because the great decorum of the World is sustained by frequent effects, but Monsters happen rarely, and therefore they ought to be segregated from the Ornaments of the World; and if they had come to light to adorne the World, they had from the beginning of the World appeared, which we read of no where.\n\nHow this Monstrous alienation from the Hu∣mane Form was first introduced and continued is not so easie to conjecture. St Augustine thinks that the same reason may be given for these deformed Nations, as there is for those Monstrous productions of Men which sometimes happen among us, of which kind of prodigious productions there are many records where∣in Nature seems to have upbraided Mans invention, and to retaliate his affectations.\n\nAnno Dom. 1525, at Wittenberg an Infant was borne without a Head.\n\nAnno 1554, In Misnia an Infant was born with∣out a Head, the Effigies of Eyes expressed in his Breast.\n\nAnno Domini 1562, in the Calends of Novem∣ber at Villafranc in Vasconia a Monster was borne, a Female Acephalon; the Pourtraiture of which headlesse Monster, Fontanus who religiously affirmed that he had seen it, having communica∣ted to Johannes Altinus the Physitian, he pre∣sented it to Paraeus when he was writing his Commentarie of Monsters.\n\nAnd reason may perswade us that it is not im∣possible,\n\ndescription Page 27\n\nfor it may happen by the constitution of the Climate, that the Neck may not be allowed to be eminently advanced above the Shoulders, and yet the instruments of Nature may performe their Office in a nearer approach of the Neck unto the Body, which is the opinion of Kornman∣nus. But for my own part I much suspect some villanous Artifice and affectation to have been concurrent causes of this non-appearance of the Head, and some fantasticall dislike of the Natu∣rall distance between the Head and the Body by the interposition of the Neck, which hath been the humour of some other Nations, who have in a manner no Neck, as appears in this Scene, and in the fifteen and sixteenth of this our practicall Me∣tamorphosis, where you shall find this very Na∣tion described as if they affected to have their Shoulders higher then their Heads; And Sr Wal∣ter Rawleigh saith, their Heads appeare not above their Shoulders. And I conceive that they are not so much headlesse, as that their Heads by some Violent and constant Artifice are pressed down between their Shoulders, and affecting to have their Shoulders higher then their Heads, the Scapula's by the constant endeavour of their Le∣vators grown to a habit, hath drowned the Head in the Breast, the Head being crowded too close to the Shoulders, and as it were growing to them, the Neck is quite lost and the Eies seem planted as upon the Shoulders, and the Mouth in the Breast, a shadow of which resemblance we may sometimes see in very croked short neck'd Men. And consequently all the uses of the Neck in point of\n\ndescription Page 28\n\ncircumspection are quite lost by this Artifice, and the Donation of Nature therein is made void, for they cannot with ease turne their Head about to and fro, every way to looke about them, the Spondyles or tur∣ning round Bones tied and fastened one unto another by joynts and knots, cannot possible in this posture accomplish their Motions.\n\nBut this charge and evidence I give in only against them by way of presumption: you Gen∣tlemen Readers of the Jury may give up your Verdict according to your judgments, and either find Billa Vera, or returne Ignoramus.\n\nBeyond the Land of Cathay there is a Wilder∣nesse, wherein are many wild Men with Hornes on their Heads very hideous, and speake not, but rout as Swine.\n\nThat men should be so cornuted, or have horns grow on their Heads, is a thing neither impossible nor incredible, for many have been Borne cor∣nuted.\n\nAmatus Lusitanus speaks of a Boy Borne with a little horne on his Head.\n\nAnn. 1233, In Rathstade a Town in the Norican Alpes, which the Inhabitants call Taurus, there was an Infant Borne cornuted.\n\nAnno 1551, in a Village of Marchias call'd Dammenuvald neer Whitstock, a Country Mans Wife brought forth a Monster with such a hor∣ned Head.\n\nAmong the Subalpians in Quierus, a little Town ten Miles distant from Taurin (Teurin) Anno Dom. 1578, the seventeenth of January about 8 of the clock at Night, an honest Matron brought\n\ndescription Page 29\n\nforth a Child having five hornes one against ano∣ther on his Head like unto Rams hornes.\n\nLanfraneus saw a man who came unto him for his advice, who had seven Eminencies in his Head, one greater then another, and in divers pla∣ces, whereof one was so great and acute like the horne of a young Goat, or an Inch long.\n\nIngrassias saith, that together with that prudent Chirurgian Iacobus à Sorius, he saw at Panhorn a certaine Noble Virgin, who had many crooked hornes, sharpe at the end, representing the Effi∣gies of the hornes of a young Steere, which ren∣dred her so deformed, that she rather look'd like a Devill then a Woman.\n\nOne Margaret, about sixty years, the Widow of David Owen a Welsh Man, had growing in her Forehead a horn much like unto the horns of a Lamb, as I finde in a private marginall note to Schenckius observations, written by some Physi∣cian or Chirurgion that owned the Book.\n\nIt is reported of a certaine Sect of the Bannian Priests, that they have as it were a little horne standing out upon their Heads.\n\nI remember I have read in Camerarius or some other, a Story of a certaine King, who being jealous of his Queen, and supposing himselfe to be a Cuckold, dreamt one night that he was cor∣nuted indeed, and that he had reall hornes bud∣ding out of his Forehead, and he found his dream true when he waked; which the Author there descanting upon, conceives to be possible, by Vertue of Imagination, transferring matter thither fit for such a production.\n\ndescription Page 30\n\nThat hornes may be engrafted upon the Head appeares possible by the report too we have read of some Nations, who are wont to cut off the spurs from the heeles of Cocks new gelt, and to ensert them so cut off into their own Foreheads, which afterwards encrease there and grow in a wonderfull manner.\n\nNow whether this cornuted Nation was the offspring of any horned Monsters, sufferd to propogate themselves, and so to become nationall, or whether they at first affecting such a badge of Beastiall strength, engrafted them and so it be∣came Naturall unto them, I leave to my Masters of the Jury to find out upon a Melius inquiren∣dum.\n\nAmong other contrivances of Mans cruell in∣vention I shall annex a strange Histoy out of Fabricius Hildanus.\n\nIn the Yeare 1593, at Paris there was an Infant about 15 or 18 Months old, who had the skin of its Head so extended that it exceeded the mag∣nitude of the Head of any Infant Hydrocephalos that was ever seen. This Childs Parents did carry it about from Town to Town to shew, and thereby exceedingly enriched themselves.\n\nAt length there being a great concourse of Peo∣ple, and the Parisian Magistrate being a very discreet Man, suspecting it to be some base de∣ceit, did cast the Parents into Prison; And ha∣ving examined, they confessed their Barbarous and impious crime, saying that they had cut the skin of the Infants Head by making a little hole about the Crown to the very Muscles, and by\n\ndescription Page 31\n\nthat very hole (put∣ting in a Reed be∣tween\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nthe skin and the Muscles) had blowne into it, and by degrees, with∣in some moneths, (by continuall puf∣fing into it) the skin of the Infants Head was exten∣ded to that alti∣tude, and that they did expose it to all here and about France to get money thereby. They had made the hole so neatly, that drawing out the reed, with wax or some such ma∣teriall they could easily close the same; When they had fully found out this horrid savage in∣humanity for certaine, they put both the Parents to death. This History Hildanus affirmes to have received from Ocular witnesses and persons of Credit.\n\nAmong other Monstrous formes and prodigi∣ous apparitions of the Head, we shall here pre∣sent Bicipites or Men with two Heads. I saw (saith Hali) a Man that was Borne having two Heads, one seperated from the other.\n\nCoelius Rhodiginus is reported to have seen two Monsters in Italy, one a man the other a Woman, their Bodies in all parts well and neately compo∣sed, but that they had two Heads, of which the Woman lived five and Twentie Yeares.\n\ndescription Page 32\n\nAnno 1538 there was one Borne who grew up to the perfect Stature of a Man, with his Head and Shoulders only double, so that one Head was backwardly opposite unto the other wonder∣full like one another, their Beards and Eyes ve∣ry much resembling each the other, they had both the same appetite to meat, both sensible of one hunger, their voyce alike, the same desire of one Wife, which they had, and of enjoying her was to both Heads, he was above 30 Yeares of age when my Author chanced to see him. The like Monster Lycosthenes saw in Bavaria Anno 1541, shee was a Woman of about Twenty six Yeares old with two Heads, whereof one was sufficiently deformed.\n\nI confesse I have not in all my inquisition dis∣covered a Nation of such Men, although there may possibly be such a Nation in the World, since there have been such of both Sexes, and wee by these relations, see they may live to the Age of generation, although it be against the com∣mon condition of Monsters, who for the most part are very short lived: for as they are borne against Nature so they live, moreover they are very irksome to themselves because they are moc∣king-stocks to other Mortals, therefore they judge their life displeasing to them, but the number of those that have been Borne with two Heads are very many.\n\nIn Vientum there was a Boy Borne with two Heads.\n\nAt Frusinon, a maid brought forth a Son with two Heads.\n\ndescription Page 33\n\nAnno Domini 601 there was a Boy Borne that was double Headed.\n\nAnno 1552 in Hassia three dayes after the Feast of the three Kings or Twelfth-Tide there was a Masculine Infant borne with two Heads, a dou∣ble Neck, and with a Body very well compact and agreeing with the other members.\n\nAnno 554 in the Village of Senas, there was a Monstrous Boy Borne with two Heads, which Valeriola reports from the Testimonie of Men of Credit who were Spectators and Eye witnesses of this Prodigie.\n\nCicero speaks of a Girle Borne with two Heads. About the Yeare of our Lord 1413. On the 9th of the Calends of Aprill, there was a Girle Borne in Sanders-Droff with two Heads.\n\nAnno 1544 in the Month of January there was a Female Childe Borne with two Heads, in all other things representing one Body.\n\nAnno 1487 at Patavia there was an Infant Borne, in whom besides this Capitall luxurie there was nothing uncomely to behold.\n\nAnno 1536 at Lovane there was an Infant Borne with two Heads.\n\nAnd in the memory of Peucerus there was a Child seen in Hassia, the fift of the Ides of January Anno 440 with two Heads re∣flected towards the Back, whose Faces be∣ing obverse beheld one another with a frow∣ning countenance.\n\nAnno 1553 in a certaine village of Misnia, called Zichest, not far from Pirnauu, there was an Infant Borne with two Heads, being abso∣lute\n\ndescription Page 34\n\nin all the other Members.\n\nThe apparition of these Monstrous Men was ever held prodigious: Porphirius saith that over the Land of Sicilie there happened a great E∣clipse, and that Yeare the VVomen of that Region brought forth deformed Sonns having two Heads.\n\nAnno Domini 1104 there were monstrous Births brought forth, Cattell and Men Borne with two Heads. After Clement the third was driven out of the City, among other prodi∣gies there were also Monstrous Births, Men Borne with two Heads.\n\nBut wee must know above all things, that these apparitions that be contrarie to Nature, happen not without the providence of Almighty God, but for the punishing and admonishing of Men, these things by his just judgment are often permitted, not but that Man hath a great hand in these mon∣strosities: for, inordinate Lust is drawn in as a Cause of these Events, whereby the seed of Man is made weak and unperfect, whence the productions there∣of must necessarily prove weake and imperfect; for from a precedent defect in the seed, it is a conseqence that the issue must be defective, and on the contrarie, if the seed be superfluous, out of a superfluous a su∣perfluous is begot, as any one may easily collect.\n\nNow to vindicate the regular beauty and ho∣nesty of Nature from the depravations of Art, we say that the Head, when free from any irregu∣larity of Nature or mischievous endeavours of Art, it obtaines its Naturall Figure; by the testi∣mony of Galen it resembles a Spheare, but ob∣long,\n\ndescription Page 35\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nlong, the parts a∣bout the Temples a little depressed on both sides; and when it observ's its ligitimate magni∣tude, it answers with its length, which is from the end of the Chin to the Crowne of the Head, the sixth part of the whole Body: That the parts also should agree among themselves, it requires foure equall lines; the first is that which they call the line of the Face, and reacheth from the bottom of the Chin to the top of the Fore∣head; the other is that which wee call the occi∣pitiall line, and it is drawn from the top of the Head to the first Vertebre of the Neck; the third is of the Forehead, running out from one Temple to the other; Lastly, the fourth led on from the bottom of the Eare (in which place the mammillary processe is) to the highest part of the Synciput: These foure lines if they be re∣ciprocally equall, the Head is called proportio∣nate; but if they have declined to any inequa∣lity, they are said to recede so much from their just and naturall constitution, as they draw nearer to that. For of these lines, if that of the Face be longer, the Head is called long, but if shor∣ter it shall be called short, If the line of the\n\ndescription Page 36\n\nForehead exceed the rest in length, it makes a broad Head; if that of the Occipitium transgresse its bounds, the Head is acuminate; if all be e∣quall; the Head proves round and Naturall, If they be all unequall, or some or more, from thence ariseth that forme of the Head, which with Hippocrates and Galen is called 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉; So that there are some Heads long, some broad, some acuminate, and some round, and others 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. So Spigelius. All commonly fashioned by the pragmaticall endeavours of the Midwives and Nurses in every Region: but because many Phy∣sitians and Anatomists have questioned the pro∣prietie that our Sugar-loafe-like headed Gal∣lants have in the word 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, wee will doe them that just favour as to set forth their Title. Aristo∣tle cals such who have Capita acuta, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, quasi pro∣acuminata capita habentes, vel ex fastigiatione quam vocant 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, or from the form of fire, wch is cal∣led 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. But Anatomists are of opinion that 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 signifies onely a deformed or depraved Head and not this acute, since Galen reckons an exact round and Sphericall Head amongst the species of 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, and therefore they think that Siculus and Regius have done ill to render it acutum.\n\nAmongst the rest (Sennertus) speaking of the vitious Figures of the Head, thinks that all Heads which recede from the Naturall Figure are by Galen generally called 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, and so they are not onely 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 which have capita fastigiata, copt-crown'd, or acuminate Heads; but also those in whom either the fore, or hinder, or both the emminencies are wanting, or jet out more then\n\ndescription Page 37\n\nis meet: so that Heads onely backward, or for∣ward, or upward, may appeare sharp towards the top. For, either the Synciput or anterior part of the skull is more emminent then it should be, the hinder part of the Head on the other side, as it were vanishing away and not extuberant, or else the hinder part of the Head is prominent and neither the Anterior nor Posterior emi∣nency protuberates; and if it be not depressed on the sides, it exhibits as it were a perfect Spheare; and if it be depressed in the Temples, the Head may run out in the top or crown and be acumi∣nate.\n\nHofman saith, that 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 with the Greeks are those who want the fore and hinder eminency of the Head, called in Dutch Spitzkoepf, the same also are 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, & 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, he knows not how to call them in Latine, yet he will des∣cribe them, Qui acuminato sunt capite. And there∣fore though Fallopius will have all those who have a preternaturall Figure of the Head to be called 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 of Galen, and that therefore it ought not to be rendered acutum or acuminatum, but depravatum, that it might be rightly opposed unto the Natu∣rall: Yet Hofmannus is for the first version; for since 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 by the confession of Fallopius himself is opposed to 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, (the word which Galen u∣seth to expresse the very Naturall Figure of the Head) who sees not (saith he) that the Head ceaseth to be 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 oblongum, and thereby to be made acute or acuminate when either or both the Eminencies perish? and if Galen extend the word more largely to those who have the Emi∣nencies\n\ndescription Page 38\n\nprotuberating beyond the Naturall pro∣portion, that ought not to evert the proper sig∣nification received of all Authors; therefore 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 is properly he who hath an acuminate Head, such a one as he thinks the Latines call Chilo∣nem, and which Bauhinus accounts for a fifth Fi∣gure of the Head contrived by Art.\n\nBut it appears plainly, that 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, to wit, sphera oblonga, not prolonga, as some interpret it, (which Galen seems to point to as it were with the Finger, where he cals it spheram quasi compressam) which you must conceive about the Eares and the Temples) is the onely Naturall Figure of the Head, which when Columbus denies, affirming all Figures of the Head to be equally Naturall, he doth nothing; for, this is Naturall which is for the most part; which also is most commodious to the Actions of Nature; But such is the Fi∣gure which Galen, out of Hippocrates, sayes does constitute the Naturall Figure, a spheare not every where equall, but such a one as hath ca∣vities and Eminencies. For, the best Figure of the Head which is Naturall is assimilated to a spheare gently compressed on each side, and which is in the Temples after a manner plaine, but in the fore-part and hinder part is more pro∣minent then in a Spheare; yet it more protute∣rates in this, then that, in the Crown it observes the convexity of a Spheare: they therefore who chance to have such a Head with a decent mag∣nitude, they enjoy a vigorous alacritie of senses, and are endowed with a good strength of Body. But why this laterall compression should be the\n\ndescription Page 39\n\nmost proper and Naturall Figure of the Head, that the fore-part and hinder parts thereby are made more gibbous, and the finall cause thereof ought to be enquired.\n\nAvicens opinion is, that although the skull be round, yet it is oblong made in length, because the originall of the Nerves are disposed from the Brain in longitude, and therefore it was fit they should not be streightned, and it hath two Emi∣nencies, one before and another behinde, that the Nerves might descend, which descend to the front and the Nucha.\n\nZonardus well notes that the Head hath such a Globous roundnesse, which on both sides is som∣what plaine, in the Anterior part it is somewhat acute and elevated, and that to retaine the Ven∣tricle of the Braine in the fore-deck of the Head, out of which the Nerves which cause the five Senses proceed, and after the same manner, it is a little elevated in the hinder part for the reception of the Ventricle in the sterne or hinder deck, from whence the spondible Marrow and the Nerves which procure voluntary motion arise.\n\nHugo Senensis saith, this manner of compression was contrived for the better distinguishing of the places from whence it was opportune the Nerves should arise, which would not have been well distinguished if the Head had been exactly round. Secondly, because the former and hinder Ventri∣cle ought to have a greater cavity then the mid∣dle, and because the middle Ventricle ought to be a way from one to the rest; therefore it was necessary, that the Anterior and Posterior parts\n\ndescription Page 40\n\nshould have an Eminency. Archangelus Picholo∣menus thinks, the Braine is lightly depressed on each side, and a little exporrected in length for the foremost Ventricles sake, made hollow in it, which appeares to be oblong, to whose hinder part the third Ventricle adheares, and to the third the fourth: wherefore a Brain not perfectly Glo∣bous, but gently compressed on each side and lightly protended in length, was convenient for the Ventricles.\n\nAntonius Ʋlmus to these true opinions of the Ancients hath thought of another end of this Fi∣gure of the Head, which is confirmed by the testimony of sence, who is of opinion that the Head was laterally compressed for the Eies-sake, to wit, the better to promote the action of the Eie, whose action is then better when it exists more free. Now the Head compressed, the Eie is enlarged to the seeing of things backward to the right and left hand; and although not simply to the universall space of a circular vision, yet at least to some portion of the same. Men may know the truth of this if they first try it in the Cephalicall compression, standing with a stiff Neck, and turning one Eie to the outward Angle, let them endeavour untill they perceive where the visory Rayes doe come, in which experiment they had need have the place marked with some note; Afterwards, remaining fixt in the same place, and standing just as in the same experiment, he would have them by some device to have their Heads rotunded or rounded, that they may ob∣tain a perfect sphericity, then let them turne the\n\ndescription Page 41\n\nsame Eie to the outward Angle, and try to finde whereabout or how farr the Visory Rayes reach the place formerly seen, and marking it with some note; that done, let them consult with Sence, what portion of the place is hid from the very Eye by rotunditie of the Head; for, Sence will apparently teach, that in this Cephalicall compression to the sides, the Eyes more freely expatiate to the back parts; the gaining of which advantage he thinks to be the cause of such com∣pression.\n\nHaving thus presented the artificiall contrivan∣ces of Mans Invention, practised on the Head, upon imaginary conceits of Beauty and genero∣sity, and discovered the inconveniences of such foolish and phantasticall devices, how deroga∣torie they are to the honour and Majestie of Na∣ture and prejudiciall to her operations; and ha∣ving set down the Canon of Nature, for the true and proper Figure of the Head, with the uses and finall cause of such a shape, which is the on∣ly true and naturall forme of the Head; and ha∣ving condemned them of the crime Laesa Majesta∣tis, who have forced Art (the usuall Imitator of Nature) to turne Praevaricator in humanity, wee cannot but commend those Nations who have been tender in this point of offering violence to Nature, namely the Lacedemonians, whose Nur∣ses had a certain manner of bringing up their Children without having any Crosse-cloaths, or any thing to left the Naturall growth of the Head, but left nature free to her own course, which made their Heads better shap'd. The like\n\ndescription Page 42\n\nmodest acquiescence in the wisdome of Nature, I suppose to be the reason why the Switzers Heads for the most part are so conformable to the Canon and intention of Nature.\n\nI knew a Gentleman had divers sonns, and the Midwives and Nurses had with head-bands and strokings so altered the Naturall mould of their Heads, that they proved Children of a very weak understanding; his last Sonn only, upon ad∣vice given him, had no restraint imposed upon the Naturall growth of his Head, but was left free from the coercive power of head-bands and other Artificiall violence, whose Head although it were bigger, yet he had more Wit and under∣standing then them all.\n\nHitherto of those Nations who have tampered with the Figure of their Heads, and have labou∣red to introduce a change and alteration in the most Noble part of the Humane Fabrick. There be other Nations fit to be brought on this Stage, who use Art to alter the substance and temper of their Heads; For Blockheads and Logger∣heads are in request in Brasil, and Helmets are of little use, every one having an Artificialized Naturall Morian of his Head: for, the Brasilians Heads, some of them, are as hard as the wood that growes in their Country, for they cannot be bro∣ken, and they have them so hard, that ours in comparison of theirs are like a Pompion, and when they will injure any white Man, they call him soft Head, so that hard-head and block∣head, termes of reproach with us, attributed to them, would be taken for termes of Honour and\n\ndescription Page 43\n\nGentleman-like qualifications. This property they purchased by Art, with going bare headed, which is a certaine way to attaine unto the qua∣lity of a Brasilian Chevalier, and to harden the tender Head of any Priscian, beyond the feare of breaking or needing the impertinent plaister of predantick Mountebanks.\n\nThe Indians of Hispaniola, the skuls of their Heads are so hard and thick, that the Spaniards agreed, that the Head of an Indian, although bare, was not to be struck for feare of breaking their Swords, which I suppose to happen through the same Artifice.\n\nThe Aegyptians also are hard Heads; for, their Heads are so hard, that a Stone can hardly break the skin; which they attaine unto by having their haire shaved from their childhood; so that the futures of their skuls grow firme and hard with the heat.\n\nHence wee read, that in the Battailes that passed between the Aegyptians and Persians, Herodotus and divers others tooke speciall notice, that of such as lay slaine on the ground, the Aegyptians skuls were without comparison much harder then the Persians, by reason these goe covered with Coyfes and Turbants, and those from their Infancy ever shaved and bare∣headed. King Massinissa, the Emperour Severus, Caesar, and Hanniball, in all weathers were wont to goe bare-headed; and Plato for the better health and preservation of the Body, doth earnestly perswade, that no Man should ever give the Head other cover then Nature had allotted it; And Varro is of opi∣nion, that when we were appointed to stand bare-head\n\ndescription Page 44\n\nbefore the gods, or in the presence of the Ma∣gistrates, it was rather done for our health, and to in∣ure and harden us against the injuries of the wea∣ther, then in respect of reverence.\n\nAnd I suppose wee in this Kingdome incurr some inconveniences by keeping our Heads so warme as generally we doe, neither (I believe) doe the Brasili∣ans or Aegyptians escape the affliction of Head-aches; for by this their Artifice, the sutures grow together and be obliterated in them, as they are found to be many times in those who have suffered incurable Head-aches, strangling Cathars, Apoplexes and other Maladies, for no other cause then that their sutures began to close, and their skuls to grow solid, the skull growing dry many times in young Men, even as it is wont to doe by reason of Age. A thing usuall in hot Countries, as Celsus notes, and Paraeus affirmes, that the Ethiopians, and Moores, and those that in∣habit the hot Regions, about the Meridian and E∣quinoctiall, have their skuls harder, and parted with none or few sutures; by which temper of their cli∣mates and their concurring Artifice, they obtaine in∣deed a notable defence against outward injuries, more then the ordinary provision of Nature doth affoord, but thereby they become more obnoxious to in∣ternall injuries, to wit, to those diseases, which arise from the retention of fuliginous vapours, and their thick skuls may render them more indocile and oblivious, as the Indians of Hispancola are noted to be. Celsus therefore is mistaken, where he affirmes their Heads to become thereby more firme and safe from pain; but he more derogates from the justice and Wisdome of Nature, when he affirmes that the fewer\n\ndescription Page 45\n\nsutures there be, the health of the Head is more there∣by accommodated, both which opinions of Celsus, Fallopius very moderately expounds by way of distin∣ction, saying, that his opinion is partly true and part∣ly false; for if you understand him of those affections that have pain from an internall cause, then it is so farr that their Heads should not ake, that they ra∣ther ake, since there are found many affections which arise from vapours and smoak retained: but if we un∣derstand it of those griefs which may arise from long abode under the Sun, or from the coldnesse of the ambient Aire, his opinion is most true, because since there are no sutures, there can be no transpiration of externall aire hot or cold; therefore he must be un∣derstood of paines which proceed from an extrinsique cause. But the other part of his opinion is not to be endured of those, who tender the reputation and ho∣nour of Nature; For, Columbus from many most certaine arguments drawn from experience, and dis∣sections made upon the skuls of many men, (and which is more strange and scarce credible) some Women who have died of incurable Head-aches, have been assu∣red (finding in their skuls small sutures, and those conjoyned close together) that their paines have been occasioned from that too close composition of bones; and hath hence tooke a just occasion to right Nature by this honourable conclusion, That the sutures of the Head doe not only conferre to the defence of the Bodies health, but do conferr more unto it by how much the greater and looser they shall be.\n\nWherefore (saith he) I could never approve of the opinion of Cornelius Celsus, asserting that Heads without sutures are not only most strong and firme,\n\ndescription Page 46\n\nbut also free from all manner of griefs, such as are to be found in hot and scorching Regions; for he only takes notice of causes hurting the Head from without; sure if the saying of Celsus were true, those Heads should be weaker and more apt to suffer, which had remarkable sutures, then those which had small or no sutures at all. But since it is otherwise, and the Braine is more apt to be damnified by internall fuliginous re∣crements, then outward injuries, we must conclude that those Heads which have more ample sutures, are far safer from paine, then those that are desti∣tute of them, or are intersected with small and very close ones.\n\ndescription Page 47\n\nSCENE II. Certaine Fashions of Haire affected by divers Nations, and their opinions and practise about Haire-rites, most derogatory to the Honour of Nature.\n\nTHe Arymphaei who dwell near the Ryphaean Mountaines, esteem Haire upon the Head to be a very great shame and reproach, and therefore they affect bald∣nesse, and are so from their nativity, both men & women.\n\nThe Arnupheae (as Pliny reports) be all shorne and shaven, for both Men and Women count it a shame to have haire on their Heads.\n\nThe Argippaei, that live under the roots of the high mountains in Scythia, are bald from their Nativity both Men and Women.\n\nThe Miconii also are borne without Haire, and baldnesse is lovely and Nationall to them, where∣fore\n\ndescription Page 49\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nthey are wont to call bald Men Myconians. And it is likely that this which now is na∣turall unto them, proceeded at first from some affecta∣tion & endevour of Art, which in time, through the indig∣nation of Nature, made the Heads of their off-springs Naturally barren of Haire, which is not very im∣probable, considering the strange conclusions that have been tried, to crosse and turne the ordinary course of Nature into the channell of Mens fantasticall inventions.\n\nThe Japonians account it for a great Beauty to have no Haire, whch with great care they do pluck out, only have a bunch of Haire on the Crown of their Heads, which they tye together.\n\nAnother saith, some of them pull away their Haire before, and others behind, and the pea∣sants and meaner sort of People, have halfe the Head bald: the Nobility and Gentry have few Haires behind; and if any one touch them that are left, they hold it for a great offence.\n\nIn the Land of Lombe wher groweth good Wine, and Women drinke Wine, and Men none, the Women shave their Heads, and not Men.\n\nNot only in the Province of Baske, but in other\n\ndescription Page 48\n\nplaces, Women\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nare accounted fai∣rest, when their Heads are shaven, & which is strange in some of the nor∣therly frozen coun∣tries, as Plinie affir∣meth,\n\nThat the Haire should be, as these Nations conceive, a most abject excre∣ment, an unprofita∣ble burthen, and a most unnecessary and uncomely co∣vering, and that Nature did never intend that ex∣crement for an Ornament, is a piece of Ignorance, or rather malicious impiety against Nature.\n\nHow great an Ornament the Haire is to the Head, appears by the deformity is introduced by baldnesse: If the Haire were an excrement, it should be shut quite out of the Body, but this remaines in, and they have many different accidents, of which they ought to give a finall cause, and not to tie them to the ne∣cessity of matter, which is supposed one end of their production. Neither doe they proceed from the fuligi∣nous excrements of the Braine, as some are pleased to think, but rather as Spigelius well notes, of Blood attracted by the root of the Haire unto the rest of the Plant and Trunck, which may be procured from those things, which in other Creatures hold analogy with the Haires of Man. And therefore when the Braine is consumed, baldnesse ensues; the allowed\n\ndescription Page 50\n\nplenty of blood exhausted, to wit, that from whence Haires, and wherewith the Braine and the circum∣stant parts are nourished. The prime end therefore of the Haire of the Head is to defend the skin, the second use is to defend the Braine from injuries from without, or from within. From without there may happen to fall upon it Aire, Raine, Haile; from within, Va∣pours, exhaling from the inferior parts, may prove troublesome. The Aire may hurt the Head many waies, by coldnesse constipating the Pores of the skin, whence the regresse of Vapours is exhibited; by heat, whence the Spirits are dissipated and the Braine as it were sod; by moistnesse, relaxing the internall parts; by drinesse, astringing all, and consuming the innate hu∣miditie: against all these inconveniences (which the foolish malice of these Men bring upon their Heads) the Haire by covering the Head doth very aptly bring reliefe. Raine moistens, Haile smites on it; the density of the Haire keeps off one, the other the ductus or course of the Haire turns away; for the thicknesse of the Haire admits not easily of Raine, and the turnings of the Haire doe straightway cast off the Haile that fals upon the Head. In like manner they abate the force of internall Contingencies, for they affoord a passage to Va∣pours, elevated from the inferior parts, and ascending to the top of the Head, granting a free and open way unto them. And since the Braine is severed so farr from the Fountaine of heat, and confining so neer the Bones, and under them fenced with no fat, these Haires protect and warme it. They therefore that cut them wholly away, doe not only bring a deformitie up∣on Nature, but affoord an occasion to defluxions. Wee must avert (then) from Nature these calumnies of\n\ndescription Page 51\n\nthe opinions and practices of Men: That no Haire is ne∣cessary or comely in Man; That Haires are a purga∣ment of the Body altogether unprofitable, growing on∣ly that they may be shaved, being made by Nature to doe nothing: and recommend those Cosmetiques as laudable, which preserve Haire for the use and inten∣tion of Nature, condemning all those wayes of decal∣vation practised by the Ancients to the prejudice of Nature, nothing but the rigid law of inexorable ne∣cessity, in case of diseases, being able to excuse Man for introducing upon himselfe a voluntary baldnesse, sha∣ving (generally speaking) being servile, ridiculous, and proper to Fooles and Knaves, an infamous blot of effeminacy, an index of ignominy, calamitie and dam∣mage, uncomely, because allied unto depiled baldnesse, being in sooth a voluntary, spontaneous, and wilfull bald∣nesse; shaving off the Head unto the quick, being from all antiquity appropriated unto Fooles, being proper in them to signifie the utter deprivation of Wit and un∣derstanding, and at first began in mockery and to move laughter; not to mention how repugnant it is to divine writ, it is apparently a shame and a disgrace put upon Nature, and the reproach, as anindeleble Character of infamy, cleaves unto the memory of him who beares the Name of Corses, for being the first who suffered the Haire of his Head to be shaved. His wit (therefore) was affected with a shamefull and impious Itch, who scratcht his Head for such a Paradox as praised bald∣nesse; Sinesius by Name, who therein shewed more Wit then Honesty; for because Dion had justly commended a bush of Haire, he forsooth on the contrary, would take upon him to commend baldnesse. That the Haire is a Naturall Ornament, all Allegoricall Authors\n\ndescription Page 53\n\nhave significantly maintained, and that the depra∣vation and voluntary absence thereof is a blemish and introduceth an aspect of humiliation: most Nations have by their practice asserted, and therein given their suffrage to the Naturall comelinesse thereof. Amongst the Indians the King causeth the Haire of the greatest Malefactors to be cut, thinking that to be the greatest reproach and punishment.\n\nThe Persians and the Canaryns Women, cut their Haire at the Funerall of their Friends.\n\nThe People of Brasil and Southerne parts of A∣merica, although when they are angry they let their Haire grow long, when they mourne they cut it.\n\nIn Pegu, Men and Women that be neer akin, shave their Heads in signe of mourning.\n\nAnd baldnesse, and a shaved Head, were practicall tokens of mourning among the Jews.\n\nThe Aegyptians onely who have many strange customs contrary to Nature, whereas most mor∣tals in Funerals shave their Heads and let their Beards grow long, they on the contrary let their Haire grow long and shave their Beards.\n\ndescription Page 52\n\nThe Abantes or\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nEuboensians (as the Brasilians do now to the Crown) were wont to shave the forepart of their Heads, and were the first that used this kind of barbing; which was also used by the off-spring of Theseus; the Cure∣tes (that is to say, clipped) of the Greek word Cou∣ra, which signifies clipping, and the Aetolians did the like; they of the Region Quicuri, and other West-Indians do the like. The ancient Gauls, saith Sydon. Apol. weare their Haire long before, and all the hinder part of the Head shaven. A Fashion which our wanton Youths, and effeminate Gal∣lants (saith Montaigne) have lately renewed, and in this new fangled fond doting age brought up againe, with wearing of long dangling Locks before. Eare-locks being also a pestilent cu∣some,\n\ndescription Page 54\n\nas Petrus Martyr observes, in the Province of Duharo in the West-Indies.\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nThe Maxies weare their Haire long on the right side of their Head, and shave the left side.\n\nThey of the Cape of Good Hope, some shave one side of their Heads, and leave the other curled and long.\n\nThe inhabitants of S. Croix of the Mount, their Heads are shaven bare on either side, having a tuft of Haire in the midst: some shave but one halfe, ei∣ther on the right side or on the left, and most of them round about, suf∣fering the Haire to grow in the midst, they say they received this custome from one Pai∣cume.\n\nThe Sasquesahanoughs, a Giant-like People of Virginia, weare their Haire on the one side long,\n\ndescription Page 55\n\nthe other short and close, with a ridge over their Crownes like a Cocks combe.\n\nThe Tartarians commonly shave the back part of their Heads, and let the other grow long, which they tie be∣hinde\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\ntheir Eares: not onely the Tar∣tarians are shaven after this manner, but also such as goe to remaine in their Coun-try.\n\nThe Dacians shave the crowne of their Head, suffering the Haire to grow in the middle, clipping it here and there in orbe.\n\nAlthough these Men deprive themselves in a man∣ner of halfe the benefit intended them by Nature, yet some of them did it not out of any malice to Nature: for whereas they had before-time much Haire upon their Fore-heads, and the Enemy taking occasion thereby to lay hold on them the more easily, they shaved themselves before, and kept their Haire long behind. But the ancient Gaules had no such colourable ex∣cuse, but they remained as they use to paint oppor∣tunity.\n\nFronte capillata, post est occasio calva.\n\nAnd if the Maxies and the inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope offer no affront to Nature in shaving one halfe of their Heads, and letting the\n\ndescription Page 56\n\nother grow, David was very impertinently angry with Hanun for serving his Ambassadors after that manner, and they needed not to have staid at Jeri∣cho untill their Haire was grown. And Demosthe∣nes might have walked abroad without reproach, when he had thus shaved his Head, that for shame of being seen in so deforming a Garb of Haire, he might keep the closer unto his study. Neither are your Catch-Poles thus shaved at the Inns of Court, any way ill intreated.\n\nThey of the Region Quicuri, in the West Indies; the Women use to cut their Haire, but the Men let it grow behinde, which they binde up with fillets and winde it in sundry rols, as our Maides are accustomed to doe.\n\nThe Women the Naturall Inhabitants of Vir∣ginia are cut in many Fashions agreeable to their Yeares, but ever some part remaineth long.\n\nIn New England among the Native Inhabi∣tants, when a Maid is Married, shee cutteth her Haire and keeps her Head covered, untill it be growne again.\n\nThe Chicoranes nourish their black Haire down to their Girdles, and the Women in longer traces round about them, both Sexes tie up their Hair.\n\nIn China the Men as well as the Women doe weare long Haire, rolling it up upon the top of their Heads, which they fasten with a silver pin.\n\nIn Peru the Men weare long Haire which they binde up with fillets.\n\nThe Bramenes never cut their Haire, but weare it long, and turned up as the Women doe.\n\nThe Quieteves Haire-Fashion is in hornes, moc∣king\n\ndescription Page 57\n\nthem, that want them as Women; for as the Males have hornes, which the Female Beasts want, so these salvage Beasts also. The Quieteves have a Fashion none may imitate, four hornes, one of a span long on the mould of the Head like a Unicorne, and three of halfe a span, one on the Neck, at each Eare another, all upright to the top.\n\nThe Cyguanians\n\n[illustration] depiction of artificially-altered human\n\nhave their long Haire wreathed and rolled after a Thousand Fashi∣ons.\n\nIn Savoy, Dau∣phine, and Langue∣dock, about the Alpes, both Men and Women wear long Haire; where∣upon a part of France was called Comata.\n\nD. Junius the reverend Pastor of Delph, doth witnesse, that in an Island called the Beautifull I∣sland, the Men wore their Haire as long as Wo∣men, which they had much adoe to make them leave off. Whereby you may see it is true what Plinie affirmes, that Men by the Donation of Na∣ture, have as long Haire on their Head as Wo∣men, if they let it grow and ne're cut it.\n\nThe Haire in a more speciall manner was given Woman for a covering. In all kind of Creatures, and\n\ndescription Page 58\n\nin every sexe Nature hath placed some note of diffe∣rence, and the judgment of Nature is no way ambi∣guous, where she hath granted by a peculiar indulgence, as an Ornament and beauty, the increase of long Haire, even down unto the Feet: Nature having allowed them in recompence of their smoothnesse and want of a Beard, prolixe Haire, which use hath rol∣led up, a custome some seeme too strictly to urge, who will not allow Women to have Haire hanging downe by their Cheeks, but all to be bound up and hid. Certainely such a dependant part by it selfe, of its own Nature, is not contrary to the Law of Nature, or unlawfull, neither is it intrinsically evill, so that it can never be honest; for, positis ponendis, it may stand with the honesty of Nature, and the modesty of a Christian Woman. But for a Woman to be shorne, is cleerly against the intention of Nature: in suf∣frage to which truth, the Germans and ancient Gaules thought there could no greater punishment be inflicted upon a Woman for adultery, then to cut her Haire, and to turne her so disgracefully out of doors (deprived of the peculiar Ornament of her sex.) It is noted also, that that Consult of the Senate of Athens, upon occasion of their Army which perished in Aegi∣na, was against the Law of Nature; which comman∣ded Men to nourish their Haire, and the Women to cut theirs. And no lesse despight against Nature, shewed Aristodemus the Tyrant of Cumana, when he commanded all the Virgins to be trimm'd round.\n\nFor Men to nourish long Haire is quite contrary to the intention of Nature, even by the judgment of St. Paul. Doth not Nature (saith he) teach you, that long Haire in a Man is a shame? 'Tis true, our\n\ndescription Page 59\n\ncommon parent nature hath planted the Head, the tow∣er of Reason and the Senses, and the principle Sanctu∣ary of the faculty of the Soul, with a fruitfull grove of Haire, partly that they should imbibe the afflux of subrepent humours, partly that this covering might be usefull against the injuries of Aire, and the stings of insects; yet she would not as it were by an irrefragable Edict, establish asempiternall and unrestrained per∣mission, to the luxurie of Haire, but made it lawfull for us to cut it according to our arbitrement, and to revoke that superfluous and recrementitious off∣spring of Haire to a just moderation: and as we prune luxurious Vines, so wee may take away and freely coerce that improficuous matter of Haire; nourishing of extraordinarie long Haire, having been ever infamous to Men in all ages, and Tonsure comely, necessary to the trimming of the Body, pro∣per, healthfull, and honorifique, an argument of virility to a free and politique Creature as Man is; for to what use or purpose should that superfluous crop of Haire serve? or what emolument it can bring none can see, unlesse it be to breed Lice and Dandro, after the manner of your Irish; who as they are a Nation estran∣ged from any humane excellency, scarce acknowledge any other use of their Haire then to wipe their hands, from the fat and dirt of their meales, and any other filth, for which cause they nourish long fealt locks, hanging down to their Shoulders, which they are wont to use in stead of Napkins to wipe their greasie Fingers. The Getae also and Barb'rous Indians, are condemned for never cutting nor regulating their Haire, as suffering themselves to enter into a nearer alliance with Beasts then ever Nature intended, who\n\ndescription Page 60\n\nhath made Man more smooth and nothing so hairy as they are. For Man therefore to weare Haire so long as it may serve for a covering, as Womans Haire is, was never intended to be allowed by Nature: since such Haire may somewhat hinder the actions of com∣mon life, which the Nazarites, who cut not their Haire, seeing and knowing by sense, they not only converted their Haire unto the sides, but turned them behind their Ears, and to the hinder parts of the Head, by that meanes sparing their Haire, and mee∣ting with the inconvenience which may happen to the action of the Eye and Organ of the Eare, if they be covered with Haire. Which parting of the Haire occasioned that discerning Organ, seam or Middle way, which appears so commonly in Women, being not a Naturall, but an artificiall line of distinction, because made by Art, although for a Naturall end, such as are the Actions of the said Eyes and Eares. And in troth, if wee examine the matter more fully, to what end, should wee either mingle or change the custome, or the sequestring variance of virile Nature with Feminine, that one Sex cannot be known or distinguished from another? for, wee that wee may be no lesse differing in our trimming and Ornament, then we are in Sex, doe cut our Haire, neither is there any more Reason that we should counterfeit Women then they Men; None can deny but that both have been accounted a shame∣full reproach. Diogenes, to one with curled long Haire, asking a question, denied to answer, untill he was ascertained whether he was a Man or a Wo∣man; But the maine Quaere is, what long Haire it is that is repugnant to Nature, against her Law, and against, above, or beside the Naturall use, and\n\ndescription Page 61\n\nagainst the order of Nature, which very Beasts ob∣serve, and which turnes to the Dammage of the user, which is nothing else, then to be strange from the end for which Haire was given to Man; whether the Haire of Man ought to be any longer, then barely to cover the skul, or whether they should be allowed, which touch not the Cranium and are not in the Head, but notably descend below the skul, and can bring no reliefe to the Head, and whether such Haire can be ei∣ther honest, comely, or full of Majesty? Some think that God hath delineated the bounds of the Haire about the Forehead, and that since the bounds are so Graphi∣cally struck out as it were with a paire of Compasses, therefore it is not lawfull to transgresse these bounds: Which doth not follow; for by the same rule, Women are to be shorne, since they have (originally) those de∣termined bounds of the Haire, which are called by our Barbers the Normal Angles; Because the Bones are delineated where they arise, therfore should they run out no further? Nature hath determined the place whence the Nerves arise, ought they not therefore to spread over the Body, but be cut off there where they arise? It is no good argument from the bound of a things ri∣sing, to the bound of its progresse. And the Haire was not only intended to cover and warm the skul, for it may cover the Temples and the Neck, because there are most thin Bones; This is the principle of the Nerves which spread themselves over the whole Body, and are cold by Nature, therefore by the Counsell of the best Physitians, these parts are to be covered with the Haire; They therefore who would have us believe that the Haire should descend no lower then the Eares, and which transcend those limits, should contumeliously de∣spight\n\ndescription Page 62\n\nNature, as having so much intrinsique malice in it as cannot stand with innocencie, had need prove that Adam had scissers, and cut his Haire in Para∣dise. They are yet more severe, who would have it against the Law of Nature, to weare Haire below the skul; for there is some difference between Nature and the law of Nature: The Law of Nature is that, which by reason of Rationall Nature is common to all Men among themselves, which is written in the Hearts of all Men, according to which they accuse or excuse themselves. They are not of the Law of Nature which many Nations never had, nor have notice of, it must be known to all Men; Some think this Law is writ∣ten in all Mens Hearts, explicitely as to some things, implicitely as to others, and we shall not charge all Nations of Malice or wilfull transgression against the law of Nature, who nourish Haire besides the in∣tention of Nature, since there are many conclusions which are of the law of Nature, which are not known to all Men. To conclude, Haire long or short, thick or thin, more or lesse, is a matter of indifferency; wherein there is a variety incident according to the diversity of complexions, ages, seasons of the Yeare, Climates or places of habitation, diseases or health: the prolixity or brevity whereof wee cannot positively determine. Upon pretence of their hot Climate, the Turks call such as weare long Haire on their Heads, slovens, and account them Salvage Beasts, for they themselves weare no Haire at all upon their Heads. We in colder climates are bound by a principle of Na∣turall practise and conveniency, to reduce our Tonsure to a just moderation and decency; wherein some re∣gard must be had to custome, which is the rule of de∣corum\n\ndescription Page 63\n\nfor he doth that which is ridiculous, and lesse honest and convenient, who offends against Custome, which is the Rule of Decency, who being singular, is Poled and closely cut among those who weare a bush, or bushie among those who are Poled.\n\nThe Maldives, esteem black Haire a great Beauty, and make it come so by Art, by conti∣nuall shaving, keeping their Heads shaven untill eight or nine years, they shave them from 8 dayes to 8 dayes, which makes the Haire very black.\n\nThe Turks have a black powder made of a Mi∣nerall called Alcohole, with which tincture they use to colour the Haire of their Heads and Beards black; And divers with us that are grown gray, and yet would appeare young, finde meanes to make their Haires black by combing it (as they say) with a leaden combe, or the like.\n\nVerily the Art Cosmetique refuseth to ac∣commodate any in this businesse, it being not to be attempted by Art, since Naturall, white∣nesse of aged Haires is rather an Ornament then a shame unto the Head; and therefore since gray∣nesse, as it cannot be amended, so it ought not to be palliated with any Fucus, and he that assaies to doe it is justly derided, of whom Martial.\n\nMentiris juvenem tinctis, Lentine, capillis, Tam subito corvus qui modo cygnus eras. Non omnes fallis, scit te Proserpina canum, Personam capiti detrahet illa tuo. Cana est barba, tibi nigra est coma, tingere barbam, Non potes, haec causa est, sed potes Ole comam.\n\ndescription Page 64\n\nThe Turkish Women also practise this Art, of blacking their Haire, as a foyle that maketh the white seem whiter, and more becomming their other perfections.\n\nThe Ciguanians (if Nature deny it them) make their Haire black by Art.\n\nThe Water of the River Busentus, would serve these People for a curious Cosmetique, which is reported to have a propertie to die the Haire black. The like would another River (as that in Booetia) which makes the fleeces black of those Sheep that are dipt in it.\n\nIn Japan, contrarie to the opinion of most Na∣tions, who think it a goodly sight to see Men with white and yellow Haire, esteeme it the filthiest thing in the World, and they seek by all meanes they can, to make the Haire black, for that the white causeth their griefe, and the black maketh them glad; And therefore they mourn in white.\n\nIn Germanie the Noble Virgins, that they may seeme to have somewhat exotique and peregrine Haire, or that they may differ from the Plebean Maides, to whom the yellow or Golden colour is gratefull, affect to have their Haire black.\n\nSic suum cuique pulchrum; be it their own by tra∣duction or artificiall purchase. These Virgins seeme to themselves to doe as that Aethiope, who lived in the Court of a certaine Germane Prince, who often when he saw in the nursery a faire Virgin, and withall a little black whelp, he said unto the Virgin, you are not faire, but this Dog is faire and beautifull; Gaudet sic concolor atro, as Julius Scaliger saith: And I\n\ndescription Page 65\n\nhave known some Women among us, who rejecting their own Haire for its Naturall rednesse, have worn black curled locks; which although it falsified their complexions, and therein was a trespasse against Na∣ture, yet they seem to agree with their cleer skins, as the Naturall doe, with the black Women that are cleere skin'd.\n\nThis tincture of Haire, is but a foolish and ridicu∣lous affectation, and many times proves a sinfull vani∣ty: Galen therefore, a Famous Mr. in Cosmetiques, would never communicate to any loose and wanton Wo∣man, any medicament to make their Haire black, because he knew they would abuse it: but to Matrons who lived honestly, he willingly afforded this accommodation.\n\nThe Women of old time, did most love yellow Haire, and it is found that they introduced this colour by Safron, and by long sitting daily in the Sun, who instead of Safron sometimes used medicated Sulphur. This Art of changing their Haire with Safron, was called Crocuphantea. Tertullian observing this artifice, tels them that they are ashamed of their country, and would be Gaulise Women, or Germanie Women, so much did they dis∣guise themselves, whereby is known how much red Haires were esteemed in the old time, which to seeke out by Art, St. Cyprian and St. Jerome with Tertullian, doe say, that the same doe prasage the fire of Hel.\n\nGalen affirmes that in his time most Women were dead with the Head-ache, neither could there be any remedie applied to this Evill, because they stood a long while bare-headed in the Sun, to render their Haires yellow, and he reports that for the same cause, some of\n\ndescription Page 66\n\nthem lost their Haire and became bald, and were re∣duced to Ovids remedy, for that defect, either to bor∣row other Womens Haire, or to ransack the Graves of the Dead, for a dishonest supply.\n\nTertullian speaking of this thing, saith, that Wo∣men were punished for this their lasciviousnesse, for that by reason of their daily long abode in the Sun, their Heads were often most grievously hurt with the Head∣ache, and it seems when this folly was grown habituall unto them, it degenerated into Dotage; for Lucian very lepidly derides an old Woman, who notwithstan∣ding shee was seventy Yeares of age, yet shee would have her Haire of a yellow tincture, and exhorts the old Mother to desist from her folly; for although shee could colour her silver Haires, yet shee could not recall her age. The Venetian Women at this day, and the Paduan, and those of Verona, and other parts of Ita∣ly, practise the same vanitie, and receive the same re∣compence for their affectation, there being in all these Cities, open and manifest examples, of those who have undergone a kinde of Martyrdome, to render their Haire yellow. Schenckius relates unto us the History of a certaine Noble Gentlewoman, about sixteen or seven∣teen yeares of age, that would expose her bare Head to the fervent heat of the Sun daily for some houres, that shee might purchase yellow and long Haire, by anoin∣ting them with a certaine unguent; and although she obtained the effect of her desires, yet withall, shee pro∣cured to her selfe a violent Head ach, and bled almost every day abundantly through the Nose: and on a time being desirous to stop the Blood by the pressing of her Nostrils, not farr from her right Eye toward her Temple, through a pore, as it were by a hole made with a\n\ndescription Page 67\n\nneedles point, the Blood burst out abundantly, and ta∣king away her fingers, againe caused it to run through her Nose; and at that very time shee was diseased by the obstruction of her courses.\n\nAnother Maid also by using this same Art, be∣came almost blind with sore Eyes.\n\nHad these Women known the secrets of the art Cos∣metique invented to this effect, especially that harme∣lesse and unknown rarity of Lusitanus, they might have gone a better way to worke, or had they known the tincture which the Aegyptian Women use to colour their Hands and Feet into a Golden hue, they (as Prosper. Alpinus speaks) could have nothing which they might more securely use to guild their Haire, nei∣ther should they need to burne themselves in the Sun beams, and diverse wayes offend their Heads; nei∣ther by reason of this depraved tincture of their Haires, would they, as some Virgins have been, affected with such perilous and wonderfull symptomes; Vpon observa∣tion of which exemplary punishments, Johannes Fran∣cus the Physitian thus speakes: So they who are studious to augment their Beauty, oftentimes deforme themselves.\n\nWhat a curious accommodation to these People had some Fountaine been, that had a harmelesse property to colour their Haire according to their mindes, such a one as the River Crathis mentioned by Plinie, whose Nature was to make Haire yellow, which efficacy O∣vid attributes to another.\n\nCrathis & hinc Sybaris, nostris conterminus oris,\n\nElectro similes faciunt Auroque Capillos.\n\nMontanus taking notice of this erroneous practise\n\ndescription Page 79\n\nof Women in his time in Verona, and other parts of Italy, very rationally and Learnedly observes, that this endeavour for ornament, cast them into a greater mischiefe, for although they obtained their end in colouring their haires, yet afterwards thereupon they become shorter, hard and harsh, whereas commonly Women have long and soft Haire. But these Women, choosing ever that which is worst, use strong Waters which are dryers; for although they think their Haire is coloured by them, yet they rather burne them and make them short, they destroy moreover their sub∣stance, and which is worse, they destroy life it selfe. A caution to be considered of by our Gallants.\n\nThe European Galatians although they have yellow Haire by Nature, yet they use great di∣ligence to increase the Native colour, making their Haires thicker by Art, that they differ no∣thing from Horse maines.\n\nIn the low Countryes, the Iewish Women who are all black Hair'd by Nature, wear great yellow Periwigs, which, I suppose, is either out of foolish dislike of their owne complexions, or else a desire to conforme themselves, to the generall hue of their Hair among whom they live; or both.\n\nThe Savages of Nova Francia, although their vanity stretch not so far as to the curling of Haire, yet it doth to the colouring of them; for as much as when they are merry, and paint their Faces be it with blew or with redd, they paint also their Haires with the same colours. And indeed painting the Haire of the Head, hath been anci∣ently noted in the Indians by many Poets, who tooke occasion to describe them.\n\ndescription Page 68\n\nHis coma, liventes imitatur crine hyacinthos, At{que} gerunt similes Hyacintho fronte capillos, Et qui tingentes croceo medicamine crines.\n\nTincture of Haire is most shamefull and detestable in Men; so in that impotent creature and untamed Animal, Woman (to the more honourable sort of whom Ornamentall dresses of Haire are permitted) the indulgency is to be moderated, and their licence herein granted them by Nature to be restrained with∣in certaine bounds, that it neither extend to too much curiosity or any fucus, since all fucusses in the very endeavour of Beauty are ugly and dishonoura∣ble to Nature.\n\nOne thing (saith Kornmannus) is strange and most singularly remarkable out of Gulielmus Pari∣siensis, upon the saying of St. Paul 1 Corinth. 11. A woman ought to have her Head covered, because of the the Angels, This some have understood of the evill Angels, whose lust they thought was vehemently provoked and inflamed by the Beauty of Womens Hair: and hence the Incubi are more troublesome and prone to vex Women, who have a faire head of Haire; which happens throug••h the just permission of God, for the vanity, pomp, and idle complacency of such Women, who spend too much time in trimming, and colouring their Haire, insolently glorying in that improved Orna∣ment, and oftentimes by their Beauty, inflaming others to lust: and so perchance for terrour, the pro∣vidence of Divine goodnesse, permits them to suffer this tentation from evill spirits, that they might de∣sist from such vaine care, fearing to ensnare Men with their Hair, to lust after them, since they seem to in∣stigate and provoke to lust the very Divels themselves.\n\ndescription Page 70\n\nWhich may serve for a caveat to the frizeled and over powdered Gallants of our times, lest they pro∣voke some succubus, to give them an unlookt for vi∣sitation.\n\nThe Abassines let their Haire grow, which serves them for an hat and Head tire, and for finer bravery they curle and anoint their Haire with butter, which shewes in the Sun like grasse in the morning dew; lest their locks and curles should be disordered, when they goe to Bed, each one pitcheth a forke or cratch, a foot high in the ground, "
