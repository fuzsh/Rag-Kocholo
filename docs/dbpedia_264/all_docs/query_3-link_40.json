        "text": "Honored to be included in this exhibition curated by Catherine Haggarty with talented NYC Crit Club friends!\n\nONE TO THE NEXT\n\nHEATHER DRAYZEN\n\nCATE HOLT\n\nRAYMOND HWANG\n\nKYONG KIM\n\nJUDY RIOLA\n\nKAREN ROSENKRANTZ\n\nKATE SHERMAN\n\nZELLA VANIE\n\nJUNE 20 - JULY 22, 2023\n\nMEET THE ARTISTS & RECEPTION | Friday, June 23: 6 - 8 PM | Talk at 7 PM\n\nPentimenti Gallery is pleased to introduce the curatorial talents of Catherine Haggarty in this summer exhibition titled One to the Next. This group exhibition demonstrates a deep understanding of the interconnection between nature, materiality, form, storytelling, people, and culture.\n\n“Since 2017 I have had the great pleasure of co-founding and directing The New York City Crit Club. At first, it began with two young women teaching a class collaboratively. This one class turned to 4 then to 6 and then to 15. Seven years later after a global pandemic turned us all inward - our world opened up creating the possibility to connect with artists all over the globe. When I was asked to curate this show and consider some memorable and important NYC Crit Club Artists to select for this show: One to the Next, it caused a pause simply because of the incredible amount of artists I’ve been inspired to work with.\n\nMy selection of Heather Drayzen, Zella Vanié, Raymond Hwang, Karen Rosenkrantz, Kate Sherman, Judy Riola, Cate Holt, and Kyong Kim came to be for their voices and endurance shining through time and obstacles. All these artists have been showing up for their work and their peer group in tremendous ways. Navigating all the decisions and trials that artists must do to find a personal language in their materiality and process.\n\nZella Vanié’s figurative work inspires us to see humans more clearly. Vanié paints with confidence and joy - their figures are staring back at us, aware of us but also self-satisfied as if to help us feel the same way. Karen Rosenkrantz’s drawings confuse space and time with fractured vantage points and complex mark making creating movement and challenging traditional pictorial logic. Kate Sherman’s idiosyncratic abstraction builds a psychological landscape conjured only through work that seems both knowing and automatic. Sherman’s work speaks to how abstract language really is - there is no one way to read this work, and that seems to be the point. In conversation with this openness is the ceramic wall relief work of Kyong Kim. Hanging from the wall - Kim’s work feels like a short story in form referencing symbols that feel functional but then just as soon - push back against the utilitarian.\n\nHeather Drayzen’s work seems effortless as she portrays portraits of people she loves on ad hoc materials with refined materials with confidence and attention. In conversation with Bonnard and many great artists, Drayzen paints what she loves, sees, lives with and the work seems to tell us to pay attention, slow down and love more deeply.\n\nRaymond Hwang’s abstraction refers to animals, divinity, power, fire, and play - most importantly, Raymond’s work suspends time. In another kind of painting language, Cate Holt does the same and makes us all consider hierarchies, materials, and rhythm in her assemblages. In addition to this contemplative state Holt’s work is also clearly full of joy which confronts the viewer immediately. In conversation with Raymond and Cate - are the paintings of Judy Riola. Judy’s work presents to us impossible relationships that only a brave imagination, a quick hand, and a love of painting can do. Patterns repeat, break down, eyes float around the picture plane, and the landscape is turned upside down - Riola’s work is absurd and future tense.\n\nTraversing mark making as form, bodies as vessels, nature as sublime these 8 artists answer the call of ‘what matters most’ in their truest form. The outcome of these many processes may result in assemblage paintings, ceramic relief sculptures, drawings on paper or board, and pigment on canvas. The pluralistic nature of the outcomes reflects the potential of art today. Not interested in telling one story, all these artists are tapping into their landscape, their home, their culture, and their person. This results in incredibly specific yet open work asking us to understand one artist at a time… and then to the next.”\n\n- Catherine Haggarty (Curator)\n\nHeather Drayzen earned her BFA from the School of Visual Arts, New York, NY, and her MAT from Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, RI.

The exhibition opens on June 15th, with a reception from 6-8pm, and will run through July 14, 2023. Borrowing its title from Mariah Williams' painting of the same name, the exhibition explores the multifaceted term 'Departure.'\n\nAt its core, the word 'Departure' signifies a physical journey, the act of embarking on a voyage from one place to another. It encapsulates the excitement, trepidation, and uncertainty that accompany the leaving behind of familiar landscapes, routines, and relationships. For some, this physical departure serves as a catalyst for change, allowing them to encounter new experiences, engage with other cultures, and broaden their perspectives.\n\nBeyond its literal connotations, 'Departure' delves into metaphorical realms, capturing the essence of transformation, evolution, and growth. 'Departure' represents a break from the norm, an embrace of the unconventional, and a willingness to challenge societal expectations.\n\nIn painting, a new generation of artists often represent a departure from the previous art canon, rejecting the conventions of older methods in favor of exploring a new direction. It is through departures from traditional narrative structures, experimental forms, and unconventional techniques that artists challenge existing paradigms and forge new paths.\n\nIn the paintings on view, 'Departure' also carries a poignant emotional weight, capturing the melancholy, nostalgia, and longing that accompanies separation and farewell. It encapsulates the bittersweet essence of missing loved ones, places, and moments from the past. Through portraiture and figuration, the artists in the show bring to mind the essence of departure by capturing moments in time, and allowing the viewer to reflect on the transient nature of human connections.\n\nLorenzo Amos (b. 2002, New York, NY), currently lives and works in, New York, NY.
