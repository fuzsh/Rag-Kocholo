To know the data hour by hour, click on the day that interests you. If you have a solar panel system, these data will be useful to predict the energy it will produce.\n\nThe unit of measurement for solar radiation is expressed in W/m2 (Watts per square meter).\n\nSolar radiation\n\nRelated content"
