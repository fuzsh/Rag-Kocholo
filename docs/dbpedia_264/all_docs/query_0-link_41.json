        "text": "*** Travel Hack *** Being a member of a club can have its benefits. I've been a member of The Cambridge Club for more than 12 years and it's not only nice to have a place to work out, but there is also a social area in the club where one can meet peers and clients. Actually, I'm sort of there for the social aspect and there happens to be a gym in the back that has a shower etc. that I use when I fly in from somewhere at 6am and start my meetings at 8am at the club. The travel hack is not only having this spot to refresh after a flight, but to use the facilities at various reciprocal clubs around the world. Last week I was in NYC and hosted a group at The Cornell Club-New York for breakfast. It was unlike being packed in a restaurant - very posh and one is able to have a discreet meeting amid very good service at a decent price (for the part of town you're in). I've also met folks at The St.James's Club in London. Again, excellent service and the rarefied ambiance of a private club vs bustling bistro. I'm all for all kinds of meeting places, but to have these options available at no additional cost is amazing. (For the record, my club membership is not extravagant, either, so it's a great deal all around.) To use a reciprocal, I review the page on the club's site (https://lnkd.in/gdV4rxZm) totalling 120+ clubs in 11 countries and email the front desk for a letter of introduction stating the dates that I'd like to use their services. Some might have additional costs, but I've not had any (other than the cost of food). More tips each Saturday!\n\nAbout today CAASA - Canadian Association of Alternative Strategies & Assets is my longest-term employer. My first job was at RBC Dominion Securities for about 5 years and the April 2011 - December 2017 for AIMA Canada. We started CAASA on Feb 5, 2018 and now it’s been about the same amount of time as at AIMA. I used to be jealous of folks who could be at a shop for many years but the diversity of roles I’ve had has enabled me to step into any panel or topic that we cover at CAASA, which is pretty much anything. You never know how your past will affect your future and how your dreams will affect your present.\n\nThanks to Kristina and Dustin Chervenka for the cool hat - how did you know that trucker hat is my sporit animal? My Beef today is folks who might be walk up to someone they met once and start speaking as if that person knows them on sight. This doesn’t/shouldn’t apply to “revenue calls” (but can happen as those who meet dozens or scores of new people every week can run out of RAM memory). This is especially important for job-seekers or students (I meet literally hundreds every year) - a quick update on where you met and what you’re up to is a super way to make everyone feel at ease. The worst case scenario is either: “Oh ya, where was that again that we met?” or “Of course! I remember meeting you for sure!” Actually not that dire a scenario. People are human; they forget. CAASA - Canadian Association of Alternative Strategies & Assets Tips for alts and all things\n\nDuring my trip to London in mid-Sept I'll also head up to the midlands/Yorkshire - thanks to the CAIA London executive committee and their organizing an event up there during my stay (total coincidence). If you're in London, it will be one of the last opportunities (before he steps down as CEO of the CAIA Association to connect with William J. Kelly, CAIA who will be at the event as well! More info & reg for the event: https://lnkd.in/gGe672Cv I'll be heading up there that afternoon and back on an early LNER train on the 17th. CAASA - Canadian Association of Alternative Strategies & Assets Going the distance to talk alts with everyone\n\n*** Book your seat *** It's been great working with CAIA for the last 16 years - first as a volunteer for various committees and also as Chapter Executive for the Toronto events for 3 or so years. We were high-output, organizing 10 events in 2010 but, sadly, that came to an end when I started at AIMA Canada (to be fair, the CAIA gig was pro-bono and I had a mortgage, hehe). Join us for the latest in the Rise of the Total Portfolio Approach series on Sept 11 (I'll be there...if that is any sort of a draw). Info & reg: https://lnkd.in/gS3W8PaB Download the paper here: https://lnkd.in/gkE3DnYH FREE for CAIA members, $15 for everyone else. You'll love it! CAASA - Canadian Association of Alternative Strategies & Assets Bringing the best in alts to everyone\n\nHello from NYC! My Beef today is sales people who think that they can sell complicated products to people over the phone or Zoom. Of course it is possible to lay some groundwork. Of course it is possible to lay the groundwork or do follow up that way but nothing really beats being in front of someone in real life. Also, it’s not just a 30 or 60-minute two dimensional conversation. Many times we might spend at least an hour or sometimes two or three hours with someone and really get to know them and see how they’re reacting with all of their body language.
