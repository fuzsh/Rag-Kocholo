        "text": "Alan Rogers Review of La Ferme Riola\n\nLa Ferme Riola is a very small site with just 50 pitches for touring and six gîtes attractively dispersed amongst olive trees around the four-hectare terrain. Areas for touring units are spread all around the site, mostly situated on the terraces. Pitches are large and generally well shaded. All are equipped with electrical connections. Leisure facilities include a swimming pool, a volleyball court and a children’s playground. This is a working farm and fresh produce including olives, olive oil and fresh eggs, is available at the site’s small shop.\n\nThe Gambiez family are proud of their site which they describe as an arboretum with over 120 Mediterranean species in evidence. Access is via an uphill road with many sharp bends but the journey is well worth the effort. The village of Sclos de Contes is 1 km. away and has a number of shops and cafés. Contes is a larger village, 6 km. away, with a broader selection of shops and restaurants. A regular train service (le Train des Merveilles) runs from Nice to Cuneo and stops at L’Escarène, just 5 km. from the site."
