The following sketch of the fortified station of Boonesborough will give the reader as an idea of the general character of \"stations\" for the protection of the surrounding settlements during Indian hostilities. It is taken from Judge Hall's \"Sketches of the West.\"\n\niii\n\nPreface.\n\nThe records of the first European colonies in the Valley of the Mississippi are distributed sparsely through the archives of foreign governments, and are to be found published only in fragments and hasty sketches, interspersed through miscellaneous works and periodicals, so that a connected and concise account of their rise and progress is not accessible to those who desire to trace their history. In like manner, the early records of the Anglo-American settlements west of the Alleghany Mountains, and their extension over the Valley of the Mississippi, are concealed chiefly among the archives of the several states and territories, or among the voluminous documents of the Federal government, thus placing any connected account of these infant colonies equally beyond the reach of common research. Other fragments, pertaining to the early history of the western settlements, are enveloped in private memoirs, narratives of individual observers loosely compiled, and meriting but slender claims to the confidence of the discerning reader.\n\nHence that portion of the reading public who are desirous of tracing the true history of past events in the rise and progress of the new states in the Valley of the Mississippi, free from the glosses and episodes of visionary writers, are excluded from any concise and connected history of the whole West, which discloses correctly the progressive changes, and notes the order in the chain of events, in their advance from isolated, feeble frontier colonies, to populous, wealthy, and enlightened states.\n\nTo supply this desideratum, and to present a concise and comprehensive detail, a complete but condensed narrative of American colonization west of the Alleghanies is the object of the present work. In this undertaking, the author has endeavored to connect the history of the French and Spanish colonies, which have had their important agency in the destiny of the American Republic, with those of the Anglo-Americans in their advance upon the tributaries of the Ohio River.\n\niv\n\nThe blending of these three great branches of European emigration in North America has resulted in the formation of a great and powerful Republic, the wonder, if not the admiration, of the civilized world, teeming with an enterprising and ever-active population, proud of their origin from the three great nations that have successively held dominion in the Western World.\n\nThe advance of the Anglo-American population into the Valley of the Mississippi, its union with Gallic and Spanish colonies, the concurrent extension of Republican government over the subjects of absolute monarchies, and its benign influence upon the moral character and enlightened enterprise of mankind, afford a subject worthy the profound attention of the philosopher and the statesman. They present a new phenomenon in the science of human government, as to the development of human capabilities, when untrammeled by arbitrary power, and left free to the exercise of its own energies, under the fostering care of a free and liberal system of government. They exhibit the speedy and progressive conversion of a savage wilderness into a populous and highly-civilized country, inhabited by a people who have made all nature tributary to their aggrandizement as a nation, and in the promotion of domestic independence and social wealth, by the extension of navigation and commerce, and by the perfection of arts and sciences throughout the magnificent regions of central North America.\n\nSuch a result, heretofore, has been the work of many ages; and hence the early records of the rise and progress of most nations known to history have been lost in the uncertain mazes of tradition, until arms and commerce, arts and sciences, after the lapse of centuries, had given them renown and history. It has been left to the West to furnish the history of a new Republic, to present to the world the novel spectacle of a great nation formed by people coming from various portions of the globe, differing in manners, language, politics, and religion, and settling down quietly together, forming governments, constitutions, and laws, without bloodshed, violence, conquest, or invasion, and coalescing into one uniform, harmonious, and prosperous people. Never was there an experiment of greater moral grandeur, a more sublime spectacle of the harmonious development of the moral and political energies of a people\n\nv\n\nleft free to the unrestrained operation of enlightened public opinion, the great regulator of their forms of government, laws, and religion.\n\nThe history of the early pioneers of the West is full of thrilling interest and incident connected with their struggles for the occupancy of this great and fertile region, which they have left as a rich inheritance to their posterity. The only requital they ask at our hands is the gratitude with which their names and their virtues are cherished by their posterity, and the fidelity with which they are transmitted, as models of enterprise and perseverance, to future ages.\n\nThe last participants in the great drama of western civilization will soon have passed from the stage of action; and the only voice heard in their praise, the only tribute of gratitude and admiration for their merits, will be the impartial records of history, which should embalm their deeds of valor, their patient endurance, and their active virtues in the grateful remembrance of posterity.\n\nThe general tenor of this history is to trace the gradual and steady advance of the European colonies and settlements by their various routes into the central part of North America, and the progressive extension of the Anglo-American population and Republican government throughout the great Valley of the Mississippi and the southwest; to illustrate the progressive changes, and the rapid advance of population and civil government, from the rude and half-civilized pioneer up to flourishing cities and powerful states, extending over regions which a few years previously had been savage solitudes.\n\nThe plan of the work is simple, and grows out of the order in which the different colonies advanced in the occupation of the regions now comprised in the United States.\n\nThe Spaniards were the first exploring pioneers in the Valley of the Mississippi, and their early explorations and settlements furnish the subject of the First Book, or \"Early Spanish Explorations.\"\n\nThe French were the first peaceful explorers and permanent colonists who occupied and settled the banks of the Mississippi River, subsequent to the hostile explorations of the Spaniards. The French colonies and explorations therefore furnish the subject of the Second Book, or \"France in the Valley of the Mississippi.\"\n\nvi\n\nGreat Britain, the jealous rival of France, next extended her colonies into the western country, encroaching upon the discoveries and possessions of France, until finally, by force of arms, she expelled the French power from Canada and the Mississippi, and appropriated to her own use the whole eastern half of the valley, including the Floridas.\n\nThe progress of her colonies west of the Alleghanies, her fierce contests with the French and their savage allies, and her subsequent occupancy of the country, furnish the subjects of the Third Book, or \"Great Britain in the Valley.\"\n\nAt the dismemberment of Louisiana in 1763, while Great Britain had secured the eastern portion of the province, except the Island of New Orleans, Spain had acquired all the western portion, including that island. Thus was Louisiana divided between Spain and Great Britain. Spain held dominion over the western portion of Louisiana and the Island of New Orleans, together with the Floridas, subsequent to 1781, until the close of the year 1803, when the Spanish dominion ceased in Louisiana. The acquisition, the occupancy, and the exercise of Spanish authority over this extensive province, until the final termination of the Spanish dominion on the Mississippi, furnish the subjects of the Fourth Book, or \"Spain in the Valley.\"\n\nMeantime, the \"United States\" on the Atlantic coast having declared their independence, which was recognized by Great Britain at the close of the Revolutionary war, succeeded to the territory claimed by Great Britain east of the Mississippi, as far south as the proper limits of Florida. The United States claimed dominion, and continued to extend civil jurisdiction in the formation of new states west of the Alleghany Mountains, gradually displacing the native savages from the country east of the Mississippi, and finally, by treaty negotiations, annexed all the Spanish provinces east and west of the Mississippi, as far as the Rio del Norté of Mexico.\n\nThe extension of settlements, the establishment of civil government, the increase of population, the wars and treaties with the native tribes, the acquisition of territory and the extension of dominion, the progress of agriculture, manufactures, trade, and commerce, aided by the potent influence of steam power, constitute the subjects comprised in the Fifth Book, or, \"The United States in the Valley of the Mississippi.\"\n\nSuch is the general outline of the work which is now\n\nvii\n\npresented to the American public. For its completion and perfection, so far as the nature and extent of the plan will admit, and its faithful adherence to truth and accuracy, the author has spared neither labor nor expense, and he throws himself upon the generous approbation of the American people for the first systematic arrangement of this portion of the history of the United States.\n\n1\n\nChapter I. — First Spanish Discoveries in Florida. — A.D. 1512 to 1538.\n\nArgument. — The former undefined Extent of Florida. — Spirit of Enterprise and Discovery awakened in Europe by Spanish Conquests in the West Indies, Mexico, and Peru. — The romantic and unfortunate Expedition of Ponce de Leon into East Florida. — The Expedition and Disasters of Vasquez de Ayllon; his Avarice, Cruelty, and Death. — The disastrous Expedition of Pamphilo de Narvaez. — Preparations for the great and chivalrous Expedition, under Hernando de Soto, for the Conquest of Florida. — The Nature and Extent of this Enterprise. — De Soto's commanding Person and Influence. — The Expedition sails from Spain for the West Indies. — Other Arrangements and Preparations completed. — The Expedition sails from Havana, and arrives at the Bay of Espiritu Santo late in May, 1539, A.D. — A Synopsis of the Marches, Disasters, and Fate of the Expedition.\n\n[A.D. 1512.] In the first explorations of North America, Florida, as originally claimed by Spain, comprised all that portion of the present territory of the United States which lies south of the state of New York. At a later period, until the French discovered Canada, and the pilgrims settled in New England, it comprised all that portion of the United States south of the present state of Virginia, or south of the parallel of latitude 36° 30' north, and extending westward to the Spanish possessions of Mexico. These limits were successively restricted by other European powers, until Florida, early in the eighteenth century, comprised only a narrow strip of sea-coast on the northeast side of the Gulf of Mexico, chiefly south of\n\n2\n\nlatitude 31° north, and east of the Perdido River and Bay, and including the peninsula of East Florida. Within thirty years after the first discovery of America by Columbus, nearly all the great West India Islands, as well as the isthmus between North and South America, known as the Spanish Main, were explored and conquered by the Spaniards; yet, in that part of the Continent north of the Gulf of Mexico, few and imperfect discoveries had been made. During the early part of the sixteenth century, or between the years 1510 and 1540, numerous attempts had been made to explore, and some expeditions had been fitted out to conquer, the country lying east and north of the Mexican Gulf; but they had been disastrous and fruitless.\n\nThese expeditions generally set sail from Cuba, Hispaniola, or some of the larger islands, and, proceeding in a northward direction, touched upon the Bahama Isles, and upon the eastern coast of what is now East Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. The islands were populous and wealthy, while the country north of the Mexican Gulf was an immense wilderness, inhabited only by a few scattering and hostile savages. Yet the belief obtained among the Spaniards that in the interior of this vast region there existed great and powerful empires, far more wealthy than those of Mexico and Peru. Those who had shared in the plunder of the latter countries, sighed for the still richer plunder which they believed to exist in Florida. This belief was confirmed by the most incredible stories, told by navigators who, at different times, had touched upon those shores. Every disaster on that coast, and every failure of a new expedition, only served to inflame their avarice, and stimulate their spirit for adventure and wild enterprise. In Spain the enthusiasm of all classes for discovery and conquest was unbounded. In the beautiful language of Theodore Irving, \"Never was the spirit of wild adventure more universally diffused than at the dawn of the sixteenth century. The wondrous\n\n3\n\ndiscoveries of Columbus and his hardy companions and followers, the descriptions of beautiful summer isles of the west, and the tales of unexplored regions of wealth, locked up in an unbounded wilderness, had an effect upon the imaginations of the young and adventurous, not unlike the preaching of the chivalric crusades for the recovery of the Holy Sepulcher. The gallant knight, the servile retainer, the soldier of fortune, the hooded friar, the pains-taking mechanic, the toilful husbandman, the loose profligate, and the hardy mariner, all were touched with the pervading passion; all left home, country, friends, wives, children, lovers, to seek some imaginary El dorado, confidently expecting to return with countless treasure.\"\n\nFired with this enthusiasm, Spain and Portugal sent forth a continued succession of fleets and armies, led on by the proudest soldiers of the age. Every island in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Caribbean Sea, as well as Mexico, Peru, and Guatimala, were speedily explored, overrun, and plundered by their warlike and avaricious soldiers. The natives were consigned to every species of extortion, suffering, and cruel deaths, or to an ignominious slavery, worse to them than death itself. The immense riches accumulated by those who led on these conquests were such as to constrain belief in the most incredible tales of other lands. This state of mind prepared those of ardent and enthusiastic temperaments to receive as true the most extravagant tales of the unbounded wealth of the interior of Florida; while the dangers of the coast, and the terrible hostility of the natives, only served to confirm them in the belief of the immense wealth of that country, which was so strongly guarded by nature and so resolutely defended by man. The fortunate adventurer who had amassed unbounded wealth in Mexico and Peru, sighed for the transcendent riches of Florida. This delusion was not cured by twenty-five years of subsequent disaster and disappointment. The conquerors of Mexico and Peru vainly dreamed of new laurels to be gained in the wilds of Florida. Such was the state of feeling, and such the enthusiasm, which led to the disastrous attempts to explore and conquer a country which, until near the middle of the nineteenth century, was still in the possession of the indomitable savages.\n\n4\n\nThe following are some of the principal expeditions prepared and sent to these ill-fated shores in the first half of the sixteenth century.\n\n1. The Expedition of Ponce De Leon. — The first adventurer who discovered the coast of Florida was Ponce de Leon, formerly a companion of Columbus, ex-governor of Porto Rico, and a gallant soldier of fortune. He sailed from Porto Rico on the 3d of March, 1512, upon a chimerical cruise, in search of the Fountain of Youth, whose waters, it was said, possessed the property of perpetuating youth beyond the power of time and disease. The Indian tradition placed this fountain in one of the Bahama Islands. After a long cruise in search of the island which contained the healing waters, he at length came upon the coast of a country of vast and unknown extent, which he supposed to be a large island. Land was seen on Palm Sunday (Pascha Florida), the 27th of March. From this circumstance, as well as the appearance of the forest, which was in full bloom, and brilliant with flowers, he called it Florida. The coast was dangerous and the weather tempestuous, and for many days he was compelled to avoid the shore. At length he effected a landing, which proved to be the east coast of Florida, a few miles north of the present site of St. Augustine. Having explored the dangerous and unknown shore and channels in the vicinity, and southward among the Bahama Islands, he returned to Porto Rico. Here he still burned with the desire of exploring and conquering his newly discovered country. After a lapse of several years, and various delays, he received authority from the Emperor Charles V. to sail to Florida as the governor thereof, with the task of colonizing it, as the reward for his discovery, and other former services.\n\nAt length, in the year 1512, he set sail for Florida with two ships, to select a site for his new colony, and for the seat of his government. Where he landed is not known, but most probably somewhere in the vicinity of St. Augustine. Here he was soon attacked by the natives with the most implacable fury. Many of the Spaniards were killed; the remainder were driven to their vessels for safety. Among the latter was Ponce de\n\n5\n\nLeon, mortally wounded by an Indian arrow. He returned with the wreck of his expedition to Cuba, where he shortly afterward died. As the eloquent Bancroft remarks, \"So ended the adventurer who had coveted immeasurable wealth, and had hoped for perpetual youth. The discoverer of Florida had desired immortality on earth, and gained only its shadow.\"\n\n[A.D. 1520.] 2. Expedition of Vasquez de Ayllon. — While the conquest of the islands and Mexico was progressing, the rich mines discovered required numerous able hands to bring forth the precious metals. For this purpose, it was proposed to capture as many of the hardy natives of the islands and of Florida as might be requisite to supply the demand of the mines with slaves. For this purpose, some wealthy miners fitted out a fleet of two vessels under Vasquez de Ayllon, in the year 1520, to cruise among the islands in quest of Indian slaves. This expedition reached the eastern coast of Florida, a little north of the first landing of Ponce de Leon, where the vessels were anchored in a river, in latitude 32° north, in a country called by the natives Chicorea. The river was called Jordan, and is probably the same now called the Savannah, or, as some think, the Combahee, in South Carolina. At this place Europeans were unknown to the natives, who admired the fair skins, the long beards, the splendid clothing, and the brilliant armor, no less than the huge vessels in which they came. But they fled in terror to their forests. The Spaniards soon dispelled their fears, and enticed them on board the vessels, where they traded beads and trinkets for marten skins, pearl, and some gold and silver. While on board, the unsuspecting Indians thronged the decks, gazing with admiration on every thing around them. As soon as a sufficient number had been enticed below the decks, the perfidious Spaniards closed the hatches, and made all sail for St. Domingo. Husbands were torn from their wives, parents from their children. Storms arose on the voyage; they were overtaken by disasters, and one vessel, with all on board, was lost: the other arrived safe. But the Indians on board remained sullen and gloomy; and, refusing all food, most of them died of famine and melancholy.\n\nThis enterprise only stimulated the cupidity of Vasquez de Ayllon to further outrages. He repaired to Spain, and sought from the emperor the government of Chicorea, with authority\n\n6\n\nto subdue it by conquest. He obtained his request, and wasted his whole fortune in the preparation of his fleet and troops. [A.D. 1525.] He arrived in the mouth of the Jordan, with his fleet, in the year 1525, but soon his largest ship was stranded and lost. The natives, fired with revenge for former wrongs, meditated the entire destruction of their invaders. They dissembled their resentment, and, by acts of hospitality and friendship, gained the confidence of the Spaniards, who hoped former wrongs were forgotten. Vasquez was completely deceived, and believed the country already subdued to his sway. The natives invited the Spaniards to visit their village, nine miles distant, for festive entertainment. They accepted the invitation, and Vasquez permitted two hundred of his men to visit the village, while he remained with a small force to guard the ships. The natives entertained their guests with feasting and mirth for three days, until they were placed completely off their guard. That night the Indians arose upon them and massacred every soul. At daybreak they repaired to the harbor, and surprised Vasquez and his handful of guards. Only a few of them escaped to the ships, wounded and dismayed, and with all speed hastened back to St. Domingo. According to some accounts, Vasquez remained among the slain; according to others, he returned among the wounded to St. Domingo, where mortified pride, and the ruin of his fortune, hurried him, broken-hearted, to his grave. Thus signally were the natives of Chicorea avenged upon their cruel and perfidious enemies.\n\n[A.D. 1528.] 3. Expedition of Pamphilo de Narvaez. — Disasters from heaven, and hostility from men, were insufficient to deter the Spaniards from attempting the conquest of Florida. They still believed the interior was far more wealthy than Mexico. The next important expedition was conducted by Pamphilo de Narvaez, a man of no great prudence or reputation for virtue. He was authorized to subdue the country, over which he was appointed governor, with the title of adelantado, or commander-in-chief. His authority extended over all the country of Florida, from Cape Sable as far as the River of Palms, probably the Colorado in the west of Texas. He at length equipped his fleet of four ships, and a strong military force of four hundred foot and eighty horse: with this complement he set sail from Cuba in March, and on the 12th of\n\n7\n\nApril he anchored in an open bay in East Florida, called the Bay of Espiritu Santo, the modern Tampa Bay. Having lost some of his men by desertion among the islands, and some of his horses in a storm, he landed his forces for the conquest of the country, amounting to three hundred men and forty-five horses. He then formally took possession of the country in the name of his imperial master, and explored the region in the vicinity. Having found it barren, and but thinly inhabited, he determined to penetrate northwardly into the interior, in quest of some populous and wealthy empire like Mexico or Peru. The fleet was directed to seek some safe harbor and await his return, or to proceed to Havana and bring new supplies for the army. With these arrangements he plunged into the depths of an unknown and savage wilderness, blinded against the danger by the delusive hope of conquest and riches. At first he passed through an inhabited country, with fields of maize; afterward, for many days, they journeyed through desert solitudes, and often suffered the extremes of hunger, of exposure, and of despair. They crossed rapid rivers, on rafts and by swimming, exposed to frequent attacks from hordes of lurking savages. Their extreme cruelty to the Indians who fell into their hands secured to them the most implacable hostility. Some of their captives were compelled to act as guides; but they led the invaders through swamps and forests, through matted thickets and fallen trees, until their souls sickened at the idea of proceeding further. They were thus led on for many days by their treacherous and vindictive guides, who sought to bewilder them, and lead them beyond their own territory. Yet they were urged on by the hope of reaching the rich country, which, the guides declared, was still far ahead. This was the Appalachee country, which lay, probably, west of the head streams of the Suwanee River, in Georgia, between the Alapahaw and the Withlacoochy Rivers, and east of Flint River. This country was represented by the Indians as abounding in gold, and toward this the weary Spaniards bent their eager way. At length they arrived at the long-sought country, and in sight of the chief town; but, instead of a great city like Mexico, Narvaez was chagrined to find only a village of two hundred and forty huts and sheds. The natives fled at their approach, and with them, for a time, fled the delusion of gold. The Spaniards remained twenty-five days in the village,\n\n8\n\nand were compelled to forage and plunder the country for subsistence; but they were harassed day and night, and numbers were cut off by the warlike natives, until despair began to brood over them. They now became more anxious for food than for gold; and the captives directed them southward, to the village of Auté, near the sea, where they represented the country as abounding in corn, vegetables, and fish, and the natives as peaceable and kind. This was distant nine days' march, and thither they turned their weary course. They were led through dismal swamps with deep lagoons, with the water often up to their breasts, the passage frequently obstructed by fallen timber, and beset with hordes of hostile and fierce savages. These were armed with bows of an enormous size, and hung continually upon their flanks and rear. At length, after incredible difficulties, they reached the village of Auté, which was deserted and burned by the natives at their approach. Some corn, however, remained, and this was more acceptable than gold. They were now within a day's march of the sea, probably in the vicinity of the present site of St. Mark's; their numbers were greatly reduced by disease, by privation, and by the savages. Only two thirds of their original number survived, and many of those were now ill, and disease was daily spreading among them. They had now traveled eight hundred miles of dismal wilderness from the point of their disembarkation, and knew not the part of the gulf upon which they had now arrived. Their hopes of conquest and wealth were at an end, and to retrace their steps in search of their ships would only be to hazard the lives of all the survivors. Having discovered an inlet one day's march from Auté, they determined to encamp there until they could construct a few rude barques, in which they might coast around in search of their ships. Desperation drove them to invention. A rude bellows and forge were constructed, and all the iron implements of every kind, even to their stirrups and spurs, were converted into nails, hatchets, and saws. Their shirts were made into sails, and cordage was made from palm bark and horse hair. They made pitch of pine rosin, and oakum of palm bark. Every man able to work joined in building the frail vessels; a horse was killed every three days for the laborers and the sick.\n\nAt length, after great exertion, they completed five vessels\n\n9\n\nand embarked on the 22d of September, 1528, crowding their gunwales almost to the water's edge. They coasted along the unexplored shore for many days, suffering both with hunger and sickness. They were driven by storms on the water, and assailed by savages when they approached land, until they became wild and desperate. A storm sprung up in the night, and three vessels were dispersed and wrecked: only two remained. In one of these was Narvaez himself. After coasting the shore round for many, days in the most forlorn condition, he landed, and sent all his men ashore in search of provisions, retaining with him only one sailor and a sick page. While they were on shore a severe gale sprang up from the north, and his vessel, without food or water, was driven out to sea, and never heard of afterward. Thus this ill-fated man reaped only suffering and privation, poverty and death, where he expected wealth, conquest, and glory; while the country of Florida, which he was to subdue and colonize, remained as inhospitable and unknown as before.\n\nOut of the whole number who landed at the Bay of Espiritu Santo for this expedition, only five escaped, Alvar Nunez Cabexa de Vaca, and four of his companions. They were in the other barque that remained after the night storm, and were afterward cast upon the inhospitable shore; and, as Mr. Irving observes, \"After the most singular and unparalleled hardships, they traversed the northern parts of Florida, crossed the Mississippi, the desert mountainous regions on the confines of Texas and the Rocky Mountains, passing from tribe to tribe of Indians, and often as slaves, until, at the end of several years, they succeeded in reaching the Spanish settlement of Compostella. From thence Alvar Nunez proceeded to Mexico, and ultimately arrived at Lisbon in 1537, nearly ten years after his embarkation with Pamphilo de Narvaez.\" The remainder of the crew, left on shore when Narvaez's barque was blown out to sea, were never heard of, and, in all probability, perished with hunger and by savage vengeance.\n\nStrange as it may appear, Alvar Nunez and his companions, after their forlorn wanderings and privations, and return to Europe, persisted in declaring Florida the richest country in the world; and their romantic narrations had the effect of still keeping alive the spirit of adventure for the conquest of\n\n10\n\na country so much richer than Mexico. Encouraged by these declarations, a new and more extensive expedition was set on foot, during the following year, under Hernando de Soto, one of the most distinguished and wealthy cavaliers of that age. De Soto had been a companion of Pizarro in the conquest of Peru, where he had amassed an immense fortune, and had won the most distinguished honors in the field of battle for his valor and his heroic achievements. Descended of noble blood, he maintained all the pomp and retinue of a Spanish nobleman of that day; his fame in the conquest of Peru had gained him a favorable standing with the Emperor Charles V., and he appeared at court with great pomp and splendor.\n\nFired with the enthusiasm which he had contributed to inspire, Alvar Nunez determined to join the contemplated expedition, and again to enter upon the conquest of Florida. A few months sufficed to light up all Spain with the enthusiasm of the enterprise.\n\nThe history of this expedition contains so much of romance and adventure, that it can hardly be believed by some as serious matter of fact. Yet this expedition for gold and conquest was unquestionably made; and it affords a sad proof of the proneness of human nature, under certain circumstances, to be carried away by the enthusiasm of the times, as if in expectation that the laws of nature, in the physical as well as the moral world, would be changed or subverted to subserve the imaginary wants of man.\n\nOf all the enterprises undertaken in the spirit of wild adventure, none has surpassed, for hardihood and variety of incident, that of the renowned Hernando de Soto and his band of cavaliers. As Mr. Irving observes, \"It was poetry put into action; it was the knight-errantry of the Old World carried into the depths of the American wilderness. The personal adventures, the feats of individual prowess, the picturesque descriptions of steel-clad cavaliers with lance and helm, and prancing steed, glittering through the wildernesses of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the prairies of the Far West, would seem to us mere fictions of romance, did they not come to us in the matter-of-fact narratives of those who were eye-witnesses, and who recorded minute memoranda of every day's incidents.\"\n\nThe sixteenth century was an age of adventure, and all\n\n11\n\nEurope was fired with the enthusiasm of American discovery and conquest. The populous islands of the West Indies, and the powerful and wealthy empires of Mexico and Peru, were early subdued and plundered of their immense riches by small but gallant bands of Spaniards. The whole of Europe resounded with the fame of Cortez and Pizarro, and those who had followed their standards had amassed riches and honors without number. The ambition of the young and chivalrous was inflamed to deeds of daring.\n\n[A.D. 1538.] De Soto burned with ambition to signalize himself equally with Cortez and Pizarro, to whose fame his was only inferior. The only field for his enterprise was the rich and powerful countries supposed to exist in the interior of Florida, north of the Mexican Gulf. This country was still believed to abound in silver and gold, and to be extremely fertile in all the products of agriculture. Several expeditions had formerly failed to subdue its inhabitants and to possess its wealth: but chivalric adventurers were still ready to enter a crusade again into these regions for the sake of gaining wealth and honors, and to stake their lives and fortunes on the issue. A man suitable to lead and command such an expedition was all they required. De Soto was in every way qualified. In fame he almost equalled the conquerors of Mexico and Peru themselves; in courage and perseverance he was not less. He was in the prime of manhood, and only waited some fit opportunity to signalize himself, and hand down his fame to posterity equally brilliant with that of Cortez and Pizarro. About this time Alvar Nunez returned to Spain, with the tidings of the unfortunate fate of Pamphilo Narvaez and his followers. All the vague reports of the immense riches and fertility of Florida, which had been greedily received and accredited, were confirmed in glowing colors by Alvar Nunez. In his miraculous wanderings through the country for many years, he had explored the whole region, had become acquainted with the language, customs, and resources of the natives. He therefore would be the most valuable acquisition to the contemplated expedition.\n\nThe imagination and enthusiasm of De Soto took fire at the glowing representations of Alvar Nunez, and he determined to lead an expedition which should eclipse the fame of the great captains who had preceded him, and yield the immense\n\n12\n\nriches which he so much coveted. The fate of all former expeditions to that inhospitable land only served to stimulate his ambition. He conceived that he possessed the energy and firmness to overcome all the obstacles and dangers which had caused the failure and destruction of former expeditions. He believed, too, that the barren coast, and the fierce hostility of the native tribes, were only so many obstacles placed by nature to protect and conceal the immense riches of the interior.\n\nDe Soto accordingly obtained permission and authority from the Emperor Charles to undertake the conquest of Florida at his own risk and expense. The emperor conferred upon him the title and office of governor and captain-general for life of Cuba and Florida. In the country of Florida which he should conquer he was appointed adelantado, an office comprising the whole civil and military authority, with a marquesite, and an estate in the country of thirty leagues in length and fifteen in breadth. A more splendid field of action, and a brighter prospect, presented to those who should engage in this expedition than any yet undertaken on the Continent. De Soto himself was transported with enthusiasm in the cause, and his enthusiasm and ardor were infused into all about him. So soon as it was announced that Hernando de Soto, one of the conquerors of Peru, was about to undertake the conquest of Florida, men of rank and wealth were foremost in offering the aid, not only of their personal services, but also of their money and fortunes. Soldiers of fortune, who had served with distinction in the wars against the Moors as well as in distant portions of the globe, were eager to join his standard in so splendid an undertaking. Young nobles, ambitious of distinction and wealth, cavaliers of experience, men of fortune, all volunteered in the intended conquest: some sold their whole estates to invest the proceeds in equipments for the expedition. None were more liberal in their contributions than De Soto himself, who exhausted his whole means in equipping the fleet, and in other requisites for the invasion. A troop of Portuguese cavaliers were among the volunteers for the enterprise; the whole of Spain was anxiously looking on the preparations for the expedition, and all was a brilliant display of arms and wealth. The number who presented themselves for the enterprise was far greater than could be received. From all the applicants De Soto selected the choicest spirits for his companions.\n\n13\n\nMany of the aspirants for fame and wealth, even those who had sacrificed their estates in preparing the expedition, were compelled to remain.\n\nAfter nearly fourteen months spent in preparation for this enterprise, De Soto set sail from Spain on the 6th of April, 1538. His expedition consisted of nine hundred and fifty chosen Spaniards and Portuguese. A more gallant band had never been seen; scarcely one with gray hairs was among them. All were young and vigorous, and well fitted for the toils, hardships, and dangers of so adventurous an undertaking. In the enterprise, also, were enlisted twelve priests, eight clergymen of inferior rank, and four monks, most of them being relatives of the superior officers. This magnificent armament sailed from Spain in ten vessels, and in company with a fleet of twenty-six sail, bound for Mexico. They left the port amid the sounds of music, the blasts of trumpets, and the roar of artillery.\n\nAfter a prosperous voyage of near seven weeks, the expedition arrived at St. Jago de Cuba about the last of May. Their arrival spread general joy and rejoicing throughout the island, and for several days it was one scene of balls, masquerades, tilting-matches, bull-fights, contests of skill in horsemanship, and other chivalrous amusements. These being over, De Soto spent three months in a tour around the island, visiting the principal towns, and appointing officers of justice to rule in his absence. Most of the wealthy cavaliers were likewise furnishing themselves with the choicest horses and the most splendid trappings. The enthusiasm which prevailed in Spain spread likewise in Cuba, and many more of the wealthy and ambitious joined the expedition, and aided in furnishing every thing necessary for conquest and comfort. Late in August, the governor, De Soto, arrived at Havana, where he was joined by his family and all his troops. He continued here, engaged in the duties of his station as governor, for several months. In the mean time, he had sent a brigantine, manned with picked sailors and a trusty commander, to the coast of Florida, in search of a safe and commodious harbor, to which the expedition might sail direct on leaving Cuba. The object of this mission being accomplished, the brigantine returned, bringing four of the natives of Florida, who were detained to\n\n14\n\nlearn the Spanish language, for the purpose of being employed as guides and interpreters. During this time the preparations for the expedition had been progressing with great diligence, and the number of additional volunteers had increased the whole force to one thousand men, including three hundred and fifty horsemen, besides the crews of the ships; the fleet consisted of eight large and three small vessels.\n\nEvery thing was provided that could possibly be necessary for conquest or for planting colonies. Artisans in wood and iron; iron in abundance, and a complete set of forging tools; men and apparatus for assaying gold and silver; a whip-saw and various tools for working in wood; live stock of different kinds, including three hundred head of swine for their colony, as well as food on their march, in case of emergency. Besides these, they provided every thing which the experience of former expeditions could suggest, or avarice and cruelty could dictate. Not only priests and learned men, but chemists and miners to procure and assay the precious metals. Chains and fetters for the captives, and even blood-hounds to assist in drawing them from their hiding-places, were among the articles provided for the conquest, while cards were supplied to amuse their leisure hours or to gratify their love of gaming. The fighting men were completely clad in steel armor glittering with gold; coats of mail, helmets, breast-plates, and shields for defense; and lances, broad-swords, and cimeters for offensive warfare. A few were armed with cross-bows, and eighteen with arquebuses; and one piece of ordnance was taken. Fire-arms were not then in general use; such as were used were imperfect, compared with those of modern times.\n\nThus provided and equipped, the expedition set sail from Havana on the 12th of May, 1539, as gayly as if it had been an excursion of a bridal party. Little did they dream of the dangers and hardships which they were about to encounter. In a fortnight the fleet arrived in the Bay of Espiritu Santo, which had been selected before. Here they cast anchor and prepared to disembark.\n\nThe whole was a roving band of gallant freebooters in quest of plunder and of fortune; an army rendered cruel and ferocious by avarice, and ready to march to any point with slaughter where they might suppose an Indian village was stored with\n\n15\n\ngold or other riches. Stimulated by the love of fame, and still more by the love of gold, they plunged into the savage wilds of East Florida, and thence northward into the southwest section of Georgia, through the country of the Seminoles, who were as warlike and ferocious then as at the present time. They marched and wandered for the first year in East Florida and in Georgia, east of Flint River, continually harassed and cut off by the natives. The Indians captured for guides led them through dismal forests and impassable swamps until they reached the Appalachee country, where they spent the first winter, about one hundred and thirty miles north of St. Mark's. The next year they traversed the State of Georgia northeastward, and north of the Altamaha River; thence they were led northwestward, in search of gold, to the barren regions of the Cherokees; thence down the valley of the Coosa River; and thence southwestward, down the Alabama Valley toward its junction with the Tombigby, where they met with the most terrible disaster from a desperate attack by an immense Indian host, in which many were killed, and nearly all their baggage was destroyed by fire. From this they marched northward, or, rather, northwestward, in the midst of winter, and spent the remainder of their second winter in the upper part of the State of Mississippi, near the Yalobusha, or Tallahatchy River. During the winter they were attacked by a large body of Indians in the Chickasâ country, and again burned out. In this attack many were killed, and nearly every thing in the way of clothing and armor was destroyed by fire. Many of their horses likewise were killed or burned to death. The hostile savages harassed them incessantly in all their marches and encampments, and every day diminished the numbers of this gallant band. They next bent their course north of west, until they struck the Mississippi River. They crossed it, and extended their march with the wreck of their army in a northwestern direction to the mountainous region north of the Arkansas, where they spent their third winter. Thence they returned to the Mississippi, where De Soto died from disease brought on by constant hardships, fatigue, and disappointed ambition. The remnant of the army again set out westward in hopes of reaching Mexico; and their fourth summer was spent in traversing the regions north of Red River. They finally returned to the Mississippi, near the mouth of the\n\n16\n\nArkansas River, where the remnant of three hundred and fifty men, worn down with privations, hardships, and savage warfare in body, and depressed in mind by anxiety, disappointments, and despair, finally constructed rude vessels, and, pursued by hostile Indians, floated down the Mississippi to the gulf; and thence coasting around toward Mexico, only two hundred and fifty men finally reached the Spanish settlements. During the whole of nearly four years, while they were in quest of gold east and west of the Mississippi, their sufferings were indescribable. They encountered one continued and successive scene of privations, toils, dangers, disasters, and despair. I have not enumerated sickness and death among their sufferings, for these were the only comforts to their spirits, which sickened at the very thoughts of life.\n\nChapter II. — Invasion of Florida by Hernando De Soto. — A.D. 1539 to 1540.\n\nArgument. — The Spanish Expedition at the Bay of Espiritu Santo. — Disasters commence. — De Soto invades the Territory of Hirihigua. — Invades the Territories of Acuera; of Ocali; of Vitachuco. — Invades Osachile; the Cacique's Castle upon a fortified Mound. — Invasion of Appalache. — The Expedition winters in Appalache. — Various incidents while here. — The expedition marches in the Spring toward Western Georgia. — Invasion of the Territories of Copafi. — Capture of the Cacique. — His person and character. — His miraculous Escape. — Invasion of the territory of Cofachiqui. — De Soto's Disappointment at the Poverty of the Natives. — Captures a Queen Regent. — Detains her as a Hostage, and carries her Westward in his March. — She effects her Escape near the eastern Limits of the Cherokee Country. — The Expedition upon the Sources of the Chattahoochy River. — Arrives on the head Waters of the Coosa River.\n\n[A.D. 1539.] De Soto in East Florida. — The splendid expedition under De Soto arrived in the bay of Espiritu Santo on the 25th of May. As the fleet approached the coast, the Spaniards beheld the shore lighted up with alarm fires of the natives, who had perceived their approach; but as it entered the bay the Indians disappeared, and not one was seen for several days. These circumstances excited suspicion in the mind of De Soto, and caused him to be extremely cautious in his movements. After four days of delay and observation, he landed a body of three hundred men, most probably on the shore\n\n17\n\nof that portion of the Bay of Espiritu Santo known as Hillsborough Bay. Here, with great pomp, he formally took possession of the country in the name of his imperial master, Charles V.; after which the detachment, in the joyful expectation of conquest and riches, encamped for the night in a state of careless security. Next morning, just before the dawn of day, the Indians, who had been secretly observing all their movements, assaulted the camp in vast numbers and with terrific yells. Unacquainted with such warfare, the whole detachment, panic-stricken, fled in great confusion toward the shipping. Many were wounded by arrows, and some were killed before they could reach the vessels. The Indians having dispersed, De Soto soon afterward disembarked the whole of his troops, and began his march into the interior by slow and cautious advances. The army had not proceeded more than six miles, when they came in sight of an Indian village governed by a chief named Hirihigua, who entertained for the Spaniards the most implacable hostility; the Indians fled at their approach; and the Spaniards, finding the town deserted, entered and plundered it of all that was left. Here De Soto remained with his army until he had somewhat explored the country, and completed his arrangements for advancing into the interior.\n\nDuring the stay of the Spaniards at this post, Hirihigua and his warriors lost no opportunity of harassing them by day and by night. The savages burned with revenge against their invaders; yet they dreaded the terrible arms and horses of their enemies. De Soto, as a measure of policy, used every exertion and entreaty to appease the wrath of the vindictive chief, but all in vain. He endeavored by his interpreters, and by prisoners, discharged loaded with presents and favors, to gain his confidence and friendship. But to all their entreaties he answered scornfully, and upbraided his warriors for their intercession. His indignant reply in all cases was, \"I want none of their speeches and promises; bring me their heads, and I will receive them joyfully.\" Ten years before, this chief had been treated with great cruelty and treachery by Pamphilo de Narvaez, after having shown great kindness to him and his army. Among other outrages, Narvaez had caused the mother of Hirihigua to be torn to pieces before his eyes by bloodhounds; after which he caused his own nose to be cut off or otherwise mutilated. The remembrance of these wrongs and\n\n18\n\ncruelties was fresh in his mind. De Soto and his army were countrymen of Narvaez, and he held them answerable for the treachery of their predecessors.\n\nBefore advancing further into the country, De Soto determined to provide himself with guides and interpreters who were acquainted with the country. Having learned that a Spaniard by the name of Juan Ortiz, who had been left by the fleet of Narvaez nearly eleven years before, remained a prisoner and slave in a neighboring tribe, he determined to obtain possession of him; for he would understand both the Spanish and Indian languages; besides, he would be able to give much valuable information relative to the country, the number, and the customs of the Indians. After a hazardous enterprise by some of his bravest troopers, he obtained possession of this individual, and soon afterward took up his line of march toward the northeast, having left a garrison to hold the post of Hirihigua.\n\nDuring their stay at the latter place, they had succeeded in capturing a number of Indians, who were chained and made to serve as guides, and porters of the baggage.\n\nThe army pursued an Indian trace, which traversed the low, marshy region south and east of the Hillsborough River, toward the northeast. Their guides led them through thick woods, with tangled vines and undergrowth, through swamps, marshes, and deep morasses, almost impassable for man or horse. Sometimes they passed over small quaking prairies, with a thick vegetable soil, and with water beneath. At first it would bear the horses, and then, yielding, leave them in a suffocating bog. When the woods were thick, and the path intricate, they were beset by hordes of savages lurking in ambush, who poured showers of arrows upon them, where neither cavalry nor foot could follow to attack. After several days of severe toil, and great perplexity in threading their way through almost impassable swamps and bogs, they at length came to a deep river, which was out of its banks from recent rains. On each side of the stream, for a mile and a half in width, was a low swamp, which was excessively boggy when not completely covered with water. Three days were spent in continued and fruitless attempts to find a firm crossing-place. During the whole of this time, they were sorely harassed by continued\n\n19\n\nassaults from hostile Indians, with terrific yells. They became impatient, and, in despair, suspecting their Indian guides of treachery, caused four of them to be torn to death by bloodhounds. The guides atoned with their lives for the errors of their enemies, and for the impassable nature of the country. Yet no obstacles could turn their course; other guides were selected, who finally led them across, where the bottom of the swamp was firm, but covered with water up to the knees, and often to the armpits. Still they pressed on, and at length reached the channel of the river, which was swarming with Indians in their canoes, darting through the inundated swamp and trees, and sending forth showers of arrows upon them. A rude Indian bridge, made by a tree felled in from each bank, and joined by a floating raft, enabled them to cross, while the horses were obliged to swim.\n\nThey were now, in all probability, on the Withlacoochy River, which has been made memorable in modern times by the disasters of the bravest troops of the United States. They were probably in the region of the Wahoo Swamp, and, pursuing their route, they crossed from the south to the north side, and continued their march toward the north.\n\nAfter almost incredible difficulties and perplexities, and after having lost several of their brave companions, the army arrived at the village of Acuera, a hostile and warlike cacique. This village was about thirty miles north of the Withlacoochy, or Amaxura River, situated in a beautiful and fertile bottom, environed by extensive fields of corn, and by gardens abounding in pumpkins, squashes, and other vines; besides beautiful copses of fruit-trees close at hand.\n\nThe Cacique Acuera and all his people fled to the forests, and would hold no intercourse with De Soto, who, by interpreters and captured Indians, with every token of peace and friendship, endeavored to gain a friendly interview. But the implacable chieftain returned only the most haughty and vaunting reproaches for the cruelty and treachery of his countrymen, Pamphilo de Narvaez and De Ayllon, in former times.\n\nNear the village of Acuera, De Soto remained for twenty days, to recruit his men and horses after their perilous marches.\n\n20\n\nThey found abundance of corn and other culinary vegetables in the adjoining fields, which were numerous and extensive. The camp was securely fortified, so as to prevent sudden surprise; yet the Indians ceased not, day or night, to harass them in every form of savage warfare. Small parties dared not leave the camp; for whoever loitered a hundred yards from it was picked off by the arrows of the Indians, concealed in the adjoining thickets. Those who were thus killed were beheaded, and their heads presented to their chief; and next morning the Spaniards would find the bodies quartered and hung upon trees, or stuck upon stakes in sight of their camp. Fourteen Spaniards thus lost their lives while encamped at Acuera; yet the Indians were so wary, that they were seldom taken or killed; the whole loss of the savages in twenty days did not exceed fifty warriors.\n\nThe Spaniards were now about seventy or eighty miles distant from Hillsborough Bay, in a due north direction, and about twelve miles southwest from Orange Lake. Having explored the country for many miles around, by detachments and foraging parties, De Soto determined to march for the country of Ocali, about forty miles further north. In the first thirty miles they passed over a thin, barren region, and some pine forests, probably northwest of the present site of Fort Micanopy, before they entered the fertile region of Ocali. For twenty miles further, they passed through a fruitful valley, thickly inhabited, and abounding in fields. At length they arrived at the chief town, called, after the country, Ocali. This was one of the most extensive towns in Florida, and contained six hundred houses. It was situated upon the south side of a river, in all probability the Suwanee, or the Santa Fé branch.\n\nHere the Spaniards remained several days, finding plenty of corn, fruits, and other vegetables. The Indians were less hostile than most of those they had seen; but living in a fertile and open country, where the cavalry could act, the Spaniards had nothing to fear from their hostility, had they been otherwise. Having constructed a bridge across the river, and having captured about thirty Indians to serve as guides, De Soto set out northward with his army for the great country of Vitachuco, about forty miles distant, and called in the Portuguese narrative the Province of Palache.\n\n21\n\nThe country of Vitachuco was a large territory, one hundred and fifty miles across, under the government of three brothers, but called after the eldest, who was cacique, or king. This country, no doubt, extended from the tribe last named to what is now the southern limit of Hamilton county, Florida. After three days' march through a more open country than that formerly traversed, they arrived at the frontier settlements of Vitachuco, and approached the first town, which was that of Ochile, one of the younger brothers. This town De Soto surprised at daybreak, and secured the chief and some of his principal warriors and attendants as prisoners. These were treated with every kindness and attention, for the purpose of securing, through them, a peaceable passage through the country of the other two brothers. This village was strongly fortified, and contained about fifty large houses.\n\nAfter some days of delay they marched to the town of the second brother, and, through the messages and influence of the first, De Soto obtained a friendly reception. After this they marched toward the town of the cacique, or oldest brother, interpreters and messengers having been sent in advance. Vitachuco, however, was displeased with the kind reception given to the Spaniards by the younger brothers; he detained the messengers, and returned no answer. This haughty chieftain, during eight days, would receive no messenger nor compromise from the Spanish governor, but returned the most insulting and menacing messages. He warned him against the danger of violating his territory, and upbraided them with the treachery and cruelty of Narvaez. Finally, after great hostility and menaces, he appeared to have become reconciled to the Spaniards, and professed great friendship. He appeared anxious to atone for his former hostility by acts of kindness, in supplying their necessities, and accompanied them with professions of friendship, and unqualified submission to the wishes of De Soto. The latter, however, began to suspect a plot of treachery; and his suspicions, whether just or unfounded, terminated in the most dreadful slaughter of the natives.\n\nAmong the demonstrations of friendship and esteem toward De Soto, the cacique proposed, probably in the spirit of generous rivalry, to make a display before him of his power, and the number of warriors under his command, as well as the excellence of his tactics and evolutions, in a grand review. On a\n\n22\n\ngiven day the whole of his warriors were assembled, to the number of several thousands, including nearly all his tribe. During the parade, De Soto desired that his warriors too should display; the chief assented, and the Spaniards marched out with glittering arms and flying banners to the sound of martial music. They marched before the Indians, the infantry and cavalry duly arranged, when, upon a signal given by a blast of trumpets, they fell, sword in hand, upon the terrified and unsuspecting Indians. In three hours not less than five hundred of the warriors were numbered with the dead, and nine hundred were secured as prisoners and slaves. The remainder escaped to the woods, thickets, and a lake, which was near the town. Among the prisoners was Vitachuco himself, and many of his choicest warriors.\n\nThe town of Vitachuco was situated upon a lake, probably about twelve miles southeast of Suwanee River, where it forms the southern limit of Hamilton county. In this massacre the Indians defended themselves with great courage against the superior arms of the Spaniards and the terrible charges of their cavalry; but flight was their only safety.\n\nA few days afterward, the captive Indians rose upon their treacherous invaders, preferring death to an ignominious slavery. This gave the Spaniards a pretext for putting to death, in cold blood, the whole of their prisoners. Some were tied to stakes and shot with arrows; others were cut to pieces, or torn with dogs.\n\nWhether De Soto was justifiable in this atrocious act, must ever remain unknown. He justified himself by a belief that the chief intended to play the same treachery upon him, and that he saved the lives of his men only by anticipating him in his cruel purpose. In favor of the Indian, it may be said, that his conduct in this case was only a specimen of the policy and conduct of the Spaniards in the conquest of Mexico and Peru, where De Soto learned his Indian morality. Pretexts were not wanting in other instances, when he wished to gratify his desire of pomp and power, or, it may be, to give his troops an easy revenge for all the toils, hardships, and conflicts they had encountered since their disembarkation. In favor of the Indians, it may be asked, if they came there prepared to exterminate their invaders, why were they unable to defend themselves against their attack? The Indian princes were always anxious\n\n23\n\nto impress Europeans with their strength and power; and if, in this case, the cacique designed treachery, his designs have been forever concealed by the known and terrible designs of his antagonist.\n\nFive days after the massacre of Vitachuco, the Spaniards resumed their march northward, to a country called Osachile, after the name of its chief town, which was situated thirty miles north of Vitachuco. The fame of their treachery and cruelty, however, had preceded them, and had roused the savages to the most determined resistance. They had not marched more than twelve miles before they came to a large and deep river, which formed the boundary between the two countries. Here the Indians contested the passage; but the country being open, so that the cavalry could move, the savages were soon dispersed, and the army crossed at their leisure upon rafts constructed for the occasion. They marched partly through an open country, and at length arrived at the village of Osachile, containing about two hundred houses. The river crossed in this march was doubtless the Suwanee River. The Indians of this village having heard of the approach of the Spaniards, and knowing the terror of their arms, and the still greater terror of their warlike animals, had fled, and left the town, as usual, an easy capture. This village resembled most of those in Florida in the manner of its construction. The house of the chief was built upon a high artificial mound, or eminence, in a level country. The mound was large enough to contain on its level summit from five to ten houses for the chief and his family, with their attendants. Around the base of this eminence were the houses of the other chiefs and warriors of most distinction, and others successively in the order of their respective rank. The margin of the mound was fortified by pickets and other wooden barriers. The ascent was an avenue about fifteen feet wide, inclosed on each side by strong pickets made of trunks of trees, set deep into the ground. Within this passage were rude steps made of logs laid transversely, and partly buried in the ground. The other sides of the mound were steep, and inaccessible below the pickets on the margin.\n\nDe Soto remained in this town only two days, as it was now getting late in the season, and he wished to reach the country\n\n24\n\nof Appalaché before winter. He learned at Osachile that a few days' march would bring him to that country, of which he had heard so much during his whole march. The natives always referred to it as the most fertile and populous of all countries, and as inhabited by the most warlike nation on the Continent. Besides, it was supposed to be near the gold region, where they were to reap the wealth for which they had undertaken their adventurous campaign. Only forty miles now intervened between the two countries; but nearly the whole of the intervening region was uninhabited. On the fourth day they arrived at the \"Great Morass.\" This was a wide swamp, covered with lofty trees, with a dense undergrowth of thorns, brambles, and vines, so interwoven as to form a perfect barrier to man or horse. In the center, or lowest part of this morass, was a large shallow lake, or sheet of water, more than a mile in width, and several miles in length. The trace led through this dismal region, scarcely wide enough for two to pass abreast, between two walls of matted vines and thorns nearly a hundred feet high. The advanced guard, in single file, penetrated but a small distance into this forest, when they were met by a band of hostile Indians. These defended the pass every step to the central lake, although only two or three of the front rank on each side could engage at one time. When they reached the lake, both parties having room to spread and form for action, the contest became general. The governor sent forward a re-enforcement, and attended it in person; for he was always in the hottest part of a battle. Still the Indians made a bold stand; and they also having received a strong reenforcement, made the battle long and bloody. Both parties gradually spread out into the lake, and fought with great courage, nearly up to their waists in water. The lake abounded with a vast quantity of roots, cypress knees, bushes, briers, and fallen trees, over which they were liable to stumble at every step. It was the design of the Indians to check the progress of the Spaniards at this point, and prevent their further march into their country. The path led through the water to the opposite side of the lake, and here they might be embarrassed, and made to lose their way. But the courage of De Soto and his perseverance were equal to any obstacle that could be opposed, and he finally succeeded in driving off the Indians and passing the morass, which was altogether more\n\n25\n\nthan five miles across, being about two miles on each side of the lake. About forty yards in the middle of the lake was too deep to be forded without swimming. The Indians still met them in the narrow trace, or defile, on the other side of the lake, and resolutely defended every inch of the path until they emerged into more open and higher ground. Here likewise they made an obstinate resistance. Fearing the action of the cavalry, which would have more room for operating, they had obstructed the woods with fallen trees, and by vines and branches tied from one tree to another; and sheltering themselves among the trees, they plied the Spaniards with showers of arrows. The Indians, concealed among thickets, would spring forth as the enemy advanced, and rapidly discharge six or seven arrows each while a Spaniard could fire and re-load his arquebuse once. For six long miles were the Spaniards compelled here to toil and fight their way, without a possibility of taking vengeance until they should reach the open country. Two days were occupied in this perilous passage; but so soon as they did reach the open country they gave loose reins to their vengeance, pursued the Indians wherever they could be seen, cutting them down, or lancing them to death.\n\nIn this same morass Narvaez, in his expedition, was defeated by the Indians, and compelled to retreat toward the sea with the wreck of his army. Many of De Soto's brave men lost their lives here too, and many of them were severely wounded.\n\nDe Soto continued his march, and passed through many miles of inhabited country with numerous fields; at length he came to a deep river bordered by dense forests, which was the boundary between Osachile and Appalaché. This was, in all probability, the Oscilla River of the present day. This was the last difficult barrier against their advance; the Indians had assembled in large numbers to dispute the passage of the river. They strongly barricaded the road and banks of the river with palisades to prevent the passage of the cavalry, and here they fought with the fury of desperation; but at length were defeated by the intrepid Spaniards, who entered Palaché, or the Appalaché country, victoriously.\n\nHaving crossed the river, they pursued their march, with but little interruption, for nearly twelve miles, through alternate level lands and fertile fields, until they reached the chief town, Anhayca, which they found deserted. As usual, the Spaniards\n\n26\n\ntook possession, De Soto himself occupying the house of the cacique as his headquarters.\n\nHaving found the province of Appalaché fruitful, and abounding with the most necessary articles for the sustenance and comfort of man and beast, De Soto determined to remain encamped at Anhayca until the severity of winter should be over. His army, accordingly, went into winter-quarters about the last of November.\n\nThe province of Palaché, or Appalaché, was extensive, and probably embraced a confederacy of tribes. According to the best authorities, it extended from the Appalachicola River around the north and northwest of Appalaché Bay; but as to its precise limits on the north and east, there is much uncertainty. In all their marches the Spaniards had no other mode of ascertaining the distances traveled over than by rough estimate; and often the difficulties of the route may have caused the distance to appear much greater than it was in reality. Besides, in passing over an unknown wilderness, inhabited by savages in open hostility, it is not likely that they could ascertain the boundaries and extent of any country or tribe, or even get the exact pronunciation of the names, where all were harsh, guttural sounds to them. That part of the province in which the town of Anhayca was situated is, by general assent, placed from about one hundred to one hundred and thirty miles north of the present site of St. Mark's. As to the immediate site of this town, nothing definite can be ascertained; but it was probably in the vicinity of some of the tributaries of the Suwanee River, or nearer the Flint. The Spaniards, pursuing their circuitous marches, considered it nine days' march from the sea, and near one hundred leagues north from the Bay of Espiritu Santo.\n\nThe province was populous, and had numerous villages and extensive fields. There was no gold in the country, and this was a sore disappointment to the Spaniards; but the former accounts continually given them of its fertility, and the extreme hostility and fierceness of the natives, were not exaggerated. Indeed, they were without doubt the most fierce and implacable of all the tribes they had yet seen. During their whole stay in this town, which was nearly four months, they were harassed with constant attacks, by day and by\n\n27\n\nnight, in the open woods, and in thick ambuscades. The Indians here, too, were in the habit of taking the scalps of those they killed, a custom not observed among the tribes in the latitude of Tampa Bay at that time. They ambuscaded foraging parties, harassed the encampment with nightly attacks and terrific yells, and also lay in wait continually to seize or shoot down with arrows any that ventured from the camp. The chief, whose name was Capafi, remained concealed in some strong-hold or fastness, from which he directed his plans against the Spaniards; but no intelligence of him could be obtained, nor would he receive any friendly overtures made to him.\n\nWhile in winter-quarters at Anhayca, De Soto repeatedly sent out strong detachments through the surrounding country, to the distance of forty or fifty miles, to explore the country and inquire for the gold region. Some of these detachments were out as long as a week or ten days, and returned and reported the country on the north fertile, populous, and free from marshes. At length one of the most intrepid and persevering captains was dispatched southward with a strong detachment of horse and foot to reach the sea, which they had not seen since they left the Bay of Espiritu Santo. This detachment, after incredible difficulties and perplexities in deep swamps, marshes, &c., came to the village of Auté, and thence to the sea, at the place where Pamphilo de Narvaez made his last encampment, while building his rude brigantines to tempt the watery deep.\n\nHere they were shown by the Indian guides the remains of his camp, of the forge, the troughs hewed out of trees for feeding their horses, the skeletons of the horses that died or were killed for food, and also the spot where ten of his men had been surprised and killed, besides many other melancholy mementoes.\n\n[A.D. 1540.] De Soto being highly pleased at having found a harbor so convenient, sent the same intrepid Captain Juan de Anasco, with a detachment of thirty lancers, on the perilous route by land, back to the post of Hirihigua, to order on the garrison to headquarters, and the ships around to the Bay of Auté. All this was effected with much better success than might have been expected, considering the great distance, the impassable nature of the route, and the fierce hostility of the savages. The ships also arrived at the newly-discovered bay in safety.\n\n28\n\nSoon after the vessels arrived at this bay, De Soto dispatched an able officer with some of the smaller vessels to explore the coast westward for another convenient harbor, to which supplies and re-enforcements might be brought from Havana in the fall, when he would be further westward. This officer accomplished his mission by exploring the coast around for more than two hundred miles to the Bay of Achusi, which afforded a spacious, deep, and secure harbor. This bay is now known as Pensacola Bay. Here the fleet was directed to await his arrival in the fall, after having brought supplies from Havana.\n\nWhile wintering at Anhayca, De Soto, being harassed by continual attacks from the fierce natives by day and by night, determined that the most effectual way to restrain their hostilities, and secure the lives of his men and horses, which were daily diminished, was to obtain possession of the person of their cacique, through whom he might control their hostile operations. It was the policy of the Spaniards — fully tested in Mexico — to obtain possession of the person of the king, or cacique, as a hostage, through whose authority they could restrain the Indians and effect other objects. De Soto was well aware of this fact, and in most cases, his first object in entering the territory of any tribe was to secure the chief, on account of the profound obedience and respect paid to him. Hence this was always a matter of first importance, whether accomplished by force, or by artifice and treachery. In most tribes through which they had yet passed, the terror of their cruelty had preceded them, and the chiefs and all their people fled from their villages to avoid Spanish treachery; for, although the sole object of the Spaniards was conquest and plunder, they were not averse to obtaining these upon as easy terms as possible; hence De Soto had made every effort and inquiry to discover where the chief, Capafi, concealed himself. At length he ascertained that the place of his retreat was in a dense and almost inaccessible forest, about twenty miles distant. De Soto, placing himself at the head of a strong detachment of horse and foot, set out to surprise and capture the cacique in his strong-hold. This was an enterprise of peculiar peril: the road lay through tangled thickets and treacherous morasses, which rendered it almost impassable to cavalry. At the end of three days, and after great difficulties, they reached this formidable retreat of the savage king. It consisted of a cleared space, in the midst\n\n29\n\nof the almost impervious forest, which they had prepared for their camp. All around this space it was fortified in the strongest Indian manner. The only avenue to it was by one narrow path cut through the forest, and lined on both sides with dense thickets of vines, thorns, and undergrowth. About every hundred yards this path was strongly barricaded by trees, palisades, and vines, and at each barricade was posted a guard of the bravest warriors. Beyond these sat Capafi, strongly ensconced in the midst of his devoted warriors.\n\nDe Soto commenced the attack; and, after acts of the most daring intrepidity by himself and his troop, they forced the narrow passage, and gained one barrier after another, amid the most galling showers of arrows from every quarter. Many of the Spaniards were severely wounded; but at length they gained the open space of the fort, where the cacique and his chief warriors were assembled. Here was the severest fight and the greatest havoc. The Indians seemed to offer themselves a willing sacrifice to the Spanish sabres for the protection of their chief; but at length, being overpowered by the superiority of the Spanish arms, they were mostly killed, and the remainder were taken prisoners. Among the latter was the cacique himself.\n\nThis chief, one of the most powerful of all the native princes, was an object of great curiosity to the Spaniards. He was so remarkably fat and unwieldy that he could not walk, but was carried by his attendants upon a litter wherever he desired to go. This was, however, probably more a matter of form than necessity; for, after several days of captivity, he effected his escape from the midst of his guards, as they alleged, by crawling off on his hands and knees while they were asleep. His devoted warriors, being concealed around the camp, soon carried him to a place of safety. The guards had undergone severe fatigue, and, overcome with sleep, had given way to slumber, believing it impossible for their unwieldy prisoner to escape; but when they awoke he was gone, and never seen again by them. To appease the anger of De Soto, and to excuse their own negligence, they invented and told some marvelous tales of his having been spirited away by magic.\n\nDe Soto in Georgia. — Early in March, 1540, De Soto broke up his winter-quarters, and set out for the northeast in search\n\n30\n\nof the province of Cofachiqui, which was supposed, from Indian accounts, to be the rich country for which he was in search. He had been informed by the guides and other Indians that it lay a long distance off, toward the northeast, and that it abounded in gold, silver, and pearls. The expectation of these anticipated riches buoyed up the spirits of his troops, and led them cheerfully onward. They passed alternately through fertile fields and barren forests; through inhabited regions and deep wildernesses; through open, high woods, and deep, gloomy swamps; and often were in danger of starvation in remote and desolate forests. In their route, after the first few days, they found the tribes through which they passed friendly, hospitable, and confiding. The natives of these remote regions were unacquainted with the former cruelties and treachery of Pamphilo de Narvaez; hence they were less suspicious of the strange warriors. From Anhayca they passed northward, probably crossing the Flint River, and pursuing their march in the valley on the west side for nearly twenty days, until they reached the southern part of the Cherokee country, called Achalaque. Then they directed their route to the northeast, crossing, in the course of the next twenty days' march, two large rivers, in all probability the Ocmulgee and Oconee Rivers, not far from the vicinity of Macon and Milledgeville, in Georgia. As they passed up on the west side of the Flint River, De Soto had been informed by some Indian chief of a great and rich country to the west, called Cosa; but he determined to pursue his march to the northeast, in search of the province of Cofachiqui. In the remainder of this march he received every kindness and hospitality from the Indians that could be expected from unsophisticated human nature. The Spaniards, too, had learned, by their first year in Florida, that every encounter with the savages only increased the difficulties of their march, and reduced the number of their men and horses; hence they were careful to give as little offense to the natives as possible, and to commit fewer depredations upon their property.\n\nAt length, after an entire march and sojourn of more than two months, the Spanish army arrived in the province of Cofachiqui about the middle of May. This province was situated on the head waters of the Savannah River, and the chief town, probably, in the peninsula at the junction of the Broad and Savannah Rivers. They had, in their march, encountered many severe\n\n31\n\ndifficulties and hardships; and, having missed their way, they were lost three days in a desolate, uninhabited region, their guides bewildered, their provisions exhausted, and starvation staring them in the face. But they had now reached the termination of their perilous march. They found the country ruled by a beautiful Indian queen, or female cacique. She entertained the Spanish governor and his army with great ceremony, kindness, and even generosity. But the proud spirit of De Soto could not brook the mortification of finding the country inhabited by savages, and they destitute of gems and precious metals. He brooded over his disappointment, but concealed it from his troops; yet it was discernible in his morose conduct, and in his increased sternness to his men. Among the latter the disappointment was equally great, and showed itself in murmurs and acts of marauding upon the kind and hospitable Indians. They plundered their sacred depositories for the bones of their ancestors, and especially of the \"illustrious dead.\" In the latter were deposited the most costly riches they possessed, which were numerous valuable pearls. These sacred relics were plundered for the jewels found, and for others which they hoped to find. These were the only riches to be found, and, although many and valuable, were to be obtained in large quantities only by plundering the vaults of the dead. The Indians abhorred the sacrilege, but were unable to punish the perpetrators. They began, however, to withhold the usual supplies of food and corn. The troops began to find new difficulties, and became more dissatisfied; they found, among the spoils of the cemetery of the chiefs, several old coats of mail and a dagger, which they learned had been obtained from the expedition of the cruel and unfortunate De Ayllon. They also learned that the sea-coast where he had landed was only ten or twelve days' journey distant, and that they were then upon the head streams of a river which was probably the Jordan, which entered the sea not far from Point St. Helena, the place selected by that unfortunate man for his colony. They therefore desired to form a colony here, and here to end their toils and their wars. But \"De Soto was a man of few words and stern,\" and he determined to march toward the northwest, along the base of the mountain ranges, and thence proceed toward the Bay of Achusi, where he expected to meet his fleet with supplies.\n\n32\n\nHaving refreshed his army and horses by a sojourn of a few weeks, he determined to set out for the northwest about the latter part of May. A difficulty having occurred between some of the soldiers and the Indians while he remained in this country, and the Indians having become distrustful and unfriendly, De Soto determined to adopt the policy found so successful in the conquest of Mexico and Peru, which was to obtain possession of the sovereign, and insure the friendship or forbearance of the subjects. He therefore obtained possession of the queen, and carried her upon his march through her dominions, as a hostage for the security of his men against any hostile designs of the Indians. All due respect and ceremony were extended to her, and she was surrounded by a numerous guard to prevent her escape or capture by her people. Through this means the Spaniards procured a safe march through the territory of Cofachiqui to the country of the Cherokees, called the province of Chalaque. Near the borders of this country the young queen effected her escape from the Spaniards, and returned to her own people. The Spaniards passed through the country of the Cherokees, and found them peaceable, domestic, and hospitable, and inhabiting rather a sterile region.\n\nAt first they feared and fled from the Spaniards; but, finding them friendly, they came forward and supplied them with every thing in their power for food. But they knew nothing of gold and silver. Passing westward over the head branches of the Chattahoochy River, after a march of about twenty-two days, the Spaniards arrived, about the 25th of June, at a village called Ichiaha, situated on the Etowee branch of the Coosa River, probably in that part of Georgia now designated as Floyd county. While here, the usual inquiries for gold and silver were made, and, having learned that yellow metal was found in a region forty or fifty miles to the north, De Soto remained here, and sent couriers in quest of the region supposed by Indian accounts to yield gold. At the end of ten days they returned without any intelligence of gold, and with no other booty than a buffalo rug. Having secured the friendship of this tribe, De Soto continued his march toward the southwest along the valley, and on the north side of the Coosa River nearly fifty miles, within the limits of the present state of Alabama.\n\n33\n\nChapter III. — The Spanish Expedition East of the Mississippi. — A.D. 1540 to 1541.\n\nArgument. — De Soto marches down the Coosa River. — The King, or Cacique, of Cosa. — De Soto enters the Territory of Tuscalaza. — Noble Person and lofty Bearing of Tuscaluza. — He is inveigled into De Soto's Train. — The Army marches through the Dominions of Tuscaluza. — The captive King is impatient and indignant at his Detention. — Resolves to secure his Liberty or die. — Reaches Mauvile with the Army. — De Soto apprehends Danger from the Native Warriors. — The severe and disastrous Battle of Mauvile. — Indian Courage and Desperation. — Deplorable Condition of the Spanish Army after the Battle. — De Soto resolves to advance to the Northwest. — Crosses the Tombigby River in the Face of an Indian Army. — Passes the Head Waters of Pearl River. — Enters the Chickasa Country. — Takes Possession of a large Indian Town for his Winter-quarters. — The great Battle and Conflagration of Chicasa. — Great Losses of the Spaniards. — The Army marches Westward to Chicacilla, where they spend the remainder of the Winter. — They march Northwest to Alibamo. — Severe Battle of Alibamo. — They approach the Mississippi, or Rio Grande. — Preparations for crossing the great River. — Indian Hostilities and Opposition to their crossing. — The Army at length reach the western Side of the Rio Grande. — The probable Crossing-place.\n\n[A.D. 1540.] De Soto in Alabama. — The Spanish army now crossed to the south side of the river, and pursued their march toward the province of Cosa. After easy marches for twenty-four days through the fertile regions and fields of this extensive province, they came, about the first of August, to the chief town, named Cosa, which, as well as the province, was called by the Spaniards after the Cacique Cosa. This town was delightfully situated upon a noble river, supposed to be the Coosa. It contained five hundred dwellings, some of which were spacious. The cacique, a noble-looking young Indian, borne upon a kind of litter by four attendants, and attended by one thousand warriors, came out to meet De Soto. The chief and his retinue, all adorned with lofty plumes, with mantles of marten-skins over their shoulders, and preceded by a band of music, presented a splendid and imposing appearance. The chief received De Soto with marks of great respect and with much ceremony; gave him a residence in a part of his own house, and quartered his soldiers in the town. Great kindness and friendship were shown by the Indians, and the whole army were abundantly supplied with every thing requisite for\n\n34\n\ncomfort and convenience. The fields in the vicinity were numerous and extensive, and the Spaniards spent several weeks in the neighborhood. Late in August, De Soto set out on his march southward. He was attended by a large number of the Cosa Indians, for the purpose of carrying the baggage, and accompanied by the cacique, who was taken, attended by a Spanish guard, under the guise of special honor, but, in fact, as a guarantee for the safety of the Spaniards against any treachery or hostile attack from the Indians. As usual, every attention was paid to the chief; a splendid mantle and a horse were allowed him; but still he was, in fact, a prisoner. The Indians, perceiving that their king was not at liberty to depart from his escort if he desired, had seriously meditated his release by the massacre of his detainers. Several acts indicative of hostile intentions had been committed by some of the Indians, who had been punished by De Soto, and put in chains. At the intercession of Cosa, they had been released, and a state of amicable feeling and confidence was restored. At the extreme of Cosa's dominions, De Soto dismissed the cacique with much profession of friendship and with presents.\n\nProceeding southward, he reached the confines of the territory of Tuscaluza, one of the most potent, proud, and warlike chieftains of the South. His sway, probably, extended over a large portion of South Alabama and Mississippi. \"Tuscaluza had heard with solicitude of the approach of the Spaniards to his territories, and probably feared some hostility on their part, in combination with his rival, the Cacique of Cosa. He sent, therefore, his son, a youth eighteen years old, attended by a train of warriors, on an embassy to De Soto, proffering his friendship and services, and inviting him to his residence, which was only forty miles from the frontiers of Cosa.\" De Soto gladly accepted the offer. When he had advanced within five or six miles of the town where Tuscaluza was, he halted the army, and proceeded, in company with his staff, toward the town, where he found Tuscaluza prepared to receive him in great state. Posted upon the crest of a hill, which commanded a view of a rich and beautiful valley, he was seated on a kind of throne, or wooden stool, used by the caciques of the country. Around him stood one hundred of his principal men, dressed in rich mantles and plumes. Beside him was his standard-bearer, who bore, on the end of a lance, a dressed\n\n35\n\ndeer-skin, stretched out to the size of a buckler. It was of a yellow color, traversed by blue stripes. This was the great banner of this warrior chieftain, and the only military standard that the Spaniards met with throughout the whole expedition.\n\nThis celebrated chieftain, who has given his name to a noble river, as well as the capital of Alabama, may claim a few words more. He was of extraordinary stature, being a foot taller than any of his attendants; he was about forty years of age; \"his countenance was handsome, though severe, showing the loftiness and ferocity of his spirit, for which he was celebrated throughout all the country; he was broad across the shoulders, and small at the waist, and so admirably formed that the Spaniards declared him altogether the finest-looking Indian they had yet beheld.\"\n\nWhen De Soto approached, Tuscaluza rose and advanced twenty paces to receive him, although he took not the least notice of the officers and cavaliers who preceded him. The chieftain extended great kindness and friendship to De Soto and his troops. De Soto, as usual, suspected treachery from the cacique, and got possession of his person under the guise of honor and respect. He surrounded him with a guard; clothed him in a splendid scarlet robe, glittering with gold. After a few days, the Spaniards continued their march toward the Bay of Achusi. They desired Tuscaluza to accompany them through his dominions, for which purpose he was furnished with a horse to ride. Only one horse in the troop was found large enough for his use, and when seated upon this one his feet almost touched the ground. Proceeding southward, at the end of three days they arrived at the town of Tuscaluza, about forty miles from the point of his first interview. There the march assumed a northwestern direction, and crossed to the west side of the Alabama River. A few days afterward De Soto took up his line of march toward the southeast, until he arrived at the town of Mauvile, in company with the distinguished chief and his attendants.\n\nThe indignant savage, perceiving that he was detained a prisoner under the guise of friendship and pompous ceremony, burned with secret revenge; yet, like his European rival,\n\n36\n\nassembling the greatest solicitude for the welfare of the Spaniards, Tuscaluza dispatched some of his attendants in advance to Mauvile, above the junction of the Alabama and Tombigby Rivers, under the pretext of ordering supplies and attendants for his Spanish friends; but instead of ordering supplies for the invaders, he summoned his warriors to rally to his rescue, for the expulsion or destruction of their enemies.\n\nDe Soto continued his march, and at length arrived in the vicinity of Mauvile, which was found to be a strongly-fortified town, on an extensive plain, and swarming with Indian warriors. From various incidents on the way, De Soto began seriously to suspect danger, and accordingly kept the cacique well guarded with twenty soldiers; yet the soldiers had seen so little danger from Indians for several months, that they could not be made to apprehend any then. The town of Mauvile, from which the modern name Mobile is derived, is situated on the north side of the Alabama River, in a fine plain, surrounded by a bend of the river, not a great distance above the junction of the Tombigby. This was the principal town in the dominions of Tuscaluza, and was strongly fortified. Here he and his chief warriors resided. The town contained eighty large houses, which were different from those of other towns. They were large sheds of reeds and straw, set upon posts, and covering a large surface of ground, inclosed by pickets; and some of them were large enough to accommodate from five hundred to a thousand persons. The whole was surrounded by a strong wall, made of a double row of large pickets, deeply set in the ground, bound together by ties, vines, and reeds, and cemented with mud and moss, and plastered over, so as to be impervious to arrows or darts, except at the port-holes left at proper distances. Every fifty yards around the wall was a kind of wooden tower, capable of containing six or seven warriors; there were only two gates or entrances, one on the east and one on the west extremity. Many of the pickets had taken root, and were growing with a profusion of branches and foliage. Such was the ancient town of Mauvile, or Mobile, where De Soto met his severest disaster, and where was fought the hardest Indian battle on record.\n\nThe Disastrous Battle of Mauvile. — During more than four weeks, while De Soto had been leisurely marching through the\n\n37\n\ndominions of Tuscaluza, the latter was secretly maturing the plan which, as it appeared, he had previously conceived, for the entire destruction of the Spanish army. The van-guard, consisting of about half the cavalry and near two hundred infantry, under De Soto in person, reached the strong post of Mauvile at eight o'clock on the morning of the eighteenth of October, having left the main body of the army following slowly a few miles behind, under Luis de Moscoso. At the town, De Soto was met by a large body of warriors, painted, and splendidly dressed and equipped, preceded by a band of young females, with music, songs, and dancing. The governor and the cacique entered on horseback, side by side, and were received with great parade and respect. So soon as De Soto and his chief officers were provided with rooms, and the baggage was stowed away, Tuscaluza informed the governor that he wished to retire a short time to see his people, and make further arrangement for the remainder of the army. De Soto began to apprehend treachery, but was unable to detain the cacique. After an absence of an hour, De Soto sent a messenger to invite him to breakfast, as they had been in the habit of eating together. This finesse, used to obtain possession of the chief, was without success. Circumstances became more suspicious; some of De Soto's spies, who had been sent before him, came to him and informed him that there were a great many choice warriors concealed, perfectly armed, in large houses in remote parts of the town; and that the women were concealed in other large houses, remote from these. De Soto, certain that mischief was brewing, sent a messenger back to Luis de Moscoso, ordering him to advance rapidly with the main body of the army. At length, several messages having been sent to Tuscaluza without his notice, the messenger, who was not permitted to enter the house where he was, called out aloud from the door for the cacique. This was deemed disrespectful by his attendants, and was resented accordingly. Weapons were drawn by some of the Spaniards, and an Indian chief gave the war-whoop, which rang through the village. The warriors poured out from every house and from the plain around the town. In a short time the Spaniards and Indians were engaged in one general and deathly melee through the principal streets. The Spaniards fought with great courage and vigor against overpowering numbers. At length, finding\n\n38\n\nthemselves greatly annoyed by missiles of every kind from the house-tops, as well as from behind the houses, they fell back, disputing every inch of ground, until they reached the plain outside of the walls, where the cavalry, also, could act with more effect. So soon as they left the town the Indians plundered the baggage, and, releasing and unchaining the captives brought from Appalaché, furnished them with arms to assist in destroying their oppressors.\n\nSwarms of warriors pressed upon the Spaniards in the plain with the utmost fury, discharging showers of arrows pointed with flint with great execution, notwithstanding their defensive armor. The battle raged with great fury backward and forward from the walls to the plain for several hours, when many of the Indians were disposed to shelter themselves from the furious charges of the cavalry by retreating within the walls. De Soto determined to break down the gates, and secure admission to his cavalry; this was soon done with axes, and the cavalry charged through, followed by a part of the infantry. The battle now raged fiercely within the walls, and the Spaniards set fire to the combustible houses covered with reeds and straw. These were soon wrapped in flames, and the town presented a scene of horrid carnage, smoke, and flame. The wind drove the flames and smoke furiously along the narrow streets, where hundreds were blinded or suffocated by the smoke, and burned to death. The fire spread to one large building in which were a thousand females, most of whom were consumed with it.\n\nThe battle still raged with great fury through the burning town and in the surrounding plain. The Indians disdained to yield or ask for quarter, although slaughtered in hundreds by the keen sabres of the Spaniards. Repeatedly repulsed, they as often renewed the attack, although certain to die in the charge.\n\nThis terrible strife and carnage had continued for near five hours. The gallant band of Spaniards were diminished in number, and those remaining were almost exhausted with fatigue, heat, and thirst. Scarcely able to attack, they collected together to stand and resist only the attacks of the numerous host of savages still swarming around them. At length they were relieved by the approach o"
