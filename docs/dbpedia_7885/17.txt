Charlize Theron has entered final negotiations for A Million Ways to Die in the West.

She is in line to take the lead female role in director and co-writer Seth MacFarlane's Western comedy, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The film centres around a meek farmer who falls for the wife of an outlaw, who offers to teach him how to shoot.

Theron will play the woman, who the hero begins to fall for just as her husband reappears on the scene.

MacFarlane is planning to star in the film, although it remains unclear which role he will take.

The writer/director has reunited with Ted screenwriters Alex Sulkin and Wellesley Wild to work on the script.

Theron was most recently seen in Snow White and the Huntsman and Prometheus.

A Million Ways to Die in the West is scheduled to start production in May.
