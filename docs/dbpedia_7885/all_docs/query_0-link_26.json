        "text": "Review: 'A Million Ways to Die in the West,' 2 stars\n\nCritic%27s review%3A 2 stars\n\nThe idea%2C that the Old West was a miserable%2C brutal place%2C is good%2C but the movie is not.\n\nMacFarlane%27s comedy is not funny enough to justify its offensiveness.\n\nHe assembles an outstanding%2C willing cast%2C but wastes it.\n\nHumor forgives a lot. But it has to be, you know, funny.\n\nSeth MacFarlane, in \"A Million Ways to Die in the West,\" would have done well to remember that. He takes a genuinely interesting premise and a first-rate cast and does what he always does: Make rude jokes. Offensive jokes. Stupid jokes. And every now and then, a funny joke.\n\nBut it isn't enough. Offensive humor can be really funny. But if you're going to be really offensive, you have to be really funny, and \"A Million Ways to Die\" just isn't.\n\nMacFarlane directs, stars in and helped write the film, so if you're going to blame someone, well ...\n\nThe idea is actually pretty brilliant. We've seen a ton of Westerns in which the West is portrayed as a pristine, pure antidote to the evils of the big city. Even \"All the King's Men,\" Robert Penn Warren's seminal novel, buys into the theory: \"It is just where you go.\"\n\nMacFarlane turns this notion on its ear. The film is set in Arizona in the 19th century, and Albert (MacFarlane), a wimpy sheep farmer, constantly bemoans what a miserable place it is. There is disease, poverty, rampant alcoholism, senseless violence, wild animals, the threat of Indian attack and more. Albert is determined to prove the veracity of the film's title.\n\nThat could make for a really funny movie.\n\nThis isn't it.\n\nAlbert spends much of his time complaining to his friend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and Edward's girlfriend, Ruth (Sarah Silverman), a prostitute. (The running joke is that she has sex 10 times on a slow day, but never with Edward, because they're Christians.) The only thing Albert has going for him is his girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried) — until she dumps him for Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), who runs a mustache store. (Yes. Just go with it.)\n\nThen one day, Anna (Charlize Theron) rides into town. She's beautiful and mysterious and, after Albert saves her from a bar fight, she determines to help him become more manly, maybe even a hero. The downside of all this is that, unbeknownst to everyone in town, she's actually the wife of Clinch (Liam Neeson), the baddest bad guy in the territory.\n\nAt this point, you perhaps have noticed the pile of talented actors MacFarlane has assembled here. What's more, they're willing to do anything for laughs, Theron in particular. But too often, they seem involved in a fruitless search for those laughs. Or maybe watching Harris suffer explosive diarrhea in a hat is your idea of hilarious.\n\nAs with any Western worth its spurs, there's a showdown brewing. It takes awhile to get there — at almost two hours, the movie is too long — and it's not all that satisfying once it arrives. But that's OK. MacFarlane isn't trying to make a traditional Western. He's trying to parody one. He can hide behind that while rolling out some of the truly offensive bits, a couple of which seem like booby traps to goad the politically correct into complaining. (Guilty as charged.) A cameo at the tail end of the movie is inspired, funny and almost forgives one of these. Almost.\n\nSo, yes, this is a complaint that MacFarlane's film is too broad, too dumb, too offensive to justify the meager laughs it generates. In related news, the sun rises in the east tomorrow. Some things you can count on, and the vapid nature of \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" is one of them.\n\nReview: 'A Million Ways to Die in the West,' 2 stars\n\nDirector: Seth MacFarlane.\n\nCast: Seth MacFarlane, Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson.\n\nRating: R for strong crude and sexual content, language throughout, some violence and drug material."
