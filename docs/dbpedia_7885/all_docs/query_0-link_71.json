        "text": "Charlize Theron is obviously one of the world's most in-demand screen presences, let alone one of its most desired women, so it comes as something of a surprise to hear her say slowly, \"Sometimes acting can make you feel very alone.\"\n\nCharlize is in London for the UK release of her period Wild West caper, 'A Million Ways to Die in the West', where she co-stars with Seth McFarlane and Liam Neeson. Another recent project for the Oscar-winning actress is the even more otherwordly 'Mad Max' reboot, which paired her with Tom Hardy, an actor known for his tireless commitment to a role, and I'm wondering about the different demands made by different types of co-stars.\n\nCharlize agrees there's no one-size-fits-all-approach...\n\n\"You have to be so flexible, because for every one who's been taught the art of Method acting, there's someone else who hasn't,\" she explains, gripping her hands in front of her to make the point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"So you might find yourself acting in a certain way and getting nothing back. Sometimes when you're acting, you can actually feel very aloneâ€¦\"\n\nCharlize Theron with Seth McFarlane in 'A Million Ways to Die in the West'\n\n'A Million Ways To Die' is an irreverent caper, with some neat post-modern touches from writer and director Seth McFarlane, for example, with the pair of them stopping mid-fight in a saloon bar to discuss all the different ways you can perish in the 19th-century mid-West.\n\nComedy isn't normally associated with Charlize Theron, who won her Oscar playing a serial killer in 'Monster', but she doesn't seem too worried...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I don't think you can walk onto a set thinking you've got to make people laugh,\" she smiles. \"That would just be death.\n\n\"It's all the same job, really, just sticking to the story and staying as true as you can.\"\n\nCharlize does Dior\n\nThe film sees Charlize as appealing as ever, but - dressed in gingham cloth, old boots and a chewed old straw hat, she's many miles from the enduring billboard of her Dior golden glory. I wonder which image she feels reflects the real her?\n\n\"They all mean something,\" she smiles. \"They all resonate with me.\n\n\"I don't think women ever have to be just one thing. They can be glamorous, smart, sassy, vulnerable. I know women who are all those things in one person. I never want to feel limited.\""
