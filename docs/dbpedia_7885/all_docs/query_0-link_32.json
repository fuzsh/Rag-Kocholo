        "text": "A Million Ways to Die in the West, a comedic western by Seth MacFarlane — who rose to fame for his 2012 comedy Ted — may not sound like a box office winner. But the film, which is set in Arizona in 1882 and stars Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, and Amanda Seyfried, promises to be this summer’s hit comedy. What’s more, MacFarlane — who wrote, directed, and stars in the film — has an enviable track record. Ted has grossed more than $500 million worldwide since its 2012 release and his hit TV show Family Guy just wrapped its 12th season.\n\nThe movie opens in theaters on May 30, but if you want a sneak peak, here’s what Theron, Neeson and MacFarlane have to say about the storyline and filming process."
