        "text": "Last year, Seth MacFarlane made his feature film directorial debut with Ted, a fucking awesome movie. It even got nominated for an Oscar. But MacFarlane isn’t going to just accept that, sit back, and rake in the money. He’s going to do all of that and work on his next movie, a Blazing Saddles-type western called Million Ways to Die in the West. He’s already gotten himself a leading lady.\n\nCharlize Theron, who recently starred in Prometheus and Snow White and the Huntsman, is in final negotiations to star opposite MacFarlane in his next project, which is scheduled to start production this May. No word has been given about who she will be playing, though, as there are two possibilities.\n\nThe film is about a sheep farmer who chickens out of a duel, causing his girlfriend to leave him. Somewhere down the line he meets the wife of an outlaw who teaches him how to shoot so he can win his lady back. But he finds himself falling in love with the outlaw wife. Shit gets real when the outlaw, who I guess was missing or presumed dead or something, comes back to get his wife. Possibly offensive hilarity will be sure to ensue.\n\nIf I had to guess, Theron will probably be playing the outlaw’s wife. Seems like it would be more her thing."
