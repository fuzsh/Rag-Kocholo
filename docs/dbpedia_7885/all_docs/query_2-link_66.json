        "text": "A Million Ways to Die in the West – Film Review\n\nThis is cheeky chap Seth MacFarlane’s second major movie, following his first comedy Ted which came out in 2012. I watched A Million Ways to Die in the West over the weekend (whilst the rest of the world was watching a little known movie by Chris Nolan?) and though I had no major preconceptions – I assumed it would be a light hearted romp with some cheeky chap Seth MacFarlane style jokes – there really is hardly anything to say other than, yeah – it was alright.\n\nUnfortunately the mediocre term ‘alright’ is really the best way to describe this movie which is in no way horrible but at the same time, continually misses the mark for gut wrenching laughter. Ted was better. Trust me. And it’s not exactly like Ted was the best comedy movie ever. Wow I sound like a bitch. But it’s still true!\n\nSo the story follows Albert (Seth MacFarlane) who is a nice, amicable and occasionally witty guy – if whingey at times, as he tries to win back ex-girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) by most popular western method – a gun dual. Friends, acquaintances, bandits, flirting, sheep and other hysterical shenanigans make up the rest of the TWO HOUR film.\n\nIt’s a nice enough premise and the characters are on the whole quite likable. There’s a decent and large array of actors and actresses to hold the show together though must be said not the greatest assembly of ‘comedy actors’. Charlize Theron is beautiful and talented and all that but she’s not funny in the slightest. And I’m saying that after seeing her on the Graham Norton show. Gee whizz, no wonder she dated Sean Penn.\n\nAnyway. Neil Patrick Harris was pretty funny, even if my boyfriend did think he was ‘that bloke off Pointless’ – actually far funnier than anything that happened in the movie. Still have fond memories of him saying that. And there are some amusing references to other movies, celebrity cameos to spot (Ryan Reynolds obvs) and luckily, hardly any musical numbers at all.\n\nBut whilst a lot of negativity has been put on the quality of jokes – which many viewers found too immature or, rather surprisingly, too racist (huh?) – I just thought they weren’t that funny.\n\nObviously it was immature in places, this is Seth MacFarlane we’re talking about – haven’t you seen Family Guy? But not ALL the laughs were borne from toilet humour type gags and much of the script was trying to be witty and deadpan. I certainly didn’t find any of the jokes racist either.\n\nTo be honest the whole thing was just a little sketchy and the kind of movie you’re willing to finish sooner rather than later. A Million Ways to Die in the West? One of them could be boredom. I like Seth McFarlane, I like what he’s about. But I think he’s better doing Family Guy and American Dad.\n\nNow THIS…..this is funny."
