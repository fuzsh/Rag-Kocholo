        "text": "Q. Were you surprised, Charlize, at how easily you fit into the world of this film that Seth directed, co-wrote and co-starred in?\n\nSETH MACFARLANE I think that’s more due to Charlize’s versatility. For me, as a relatively inexperienced actor, I could not have had a better partner, who found the Goldilocks zone for both of us.\n\nCHARLIZE THERON Don’t you ever call me Goldilocks again.\n\nCharlize, are you a fan of Seth’s style of humor?\n\nTHERON He was looking at “Reindeer Games,” O.K.?\n\nMACFARLANE All of my research came from “The Astronaut’s Wife.” It was the same process I used for “Ted”: It was important that this be somebody who was able to bring a sincerity to the character, and the jokes carry themselves if you have that.\n\nThis is a period comedy set in the Wild West, and Charlize, you’re a female gunslinger?\n\nTHERON She married into that world at a young age and got stuck in a life that really wasn’t her own. Through circumstances, she finds herself outside of that life for a split second and gets to really see the potential of something different and better, and tries to go after that.\n\nAnd Seth, your character is a coward who needs Charlize’s help?\n\nMACFARLANE That wasn’t much of a stretch for me. I won’t even get on the freeway without my navigator. There was a parallel between my personal experience on the movie, for my virgin effort at being on camera, and the story itself. As we went along, Charlize was the one person I could quietly turn to, and say, “Hey, did that seem good to you, or was it too James Brolin?” I don’t know why I just said that. He’s never done anything to me. Sorry, James Brolin, I think you’re great.\n\nCharlize, did you feel you were doing Seth a favor by shoring up his untested acting skills?\n\nTHERON God, no. When I read this [the script], I washed my hair and got ready for the meeting. And back then I didn’t have any hair, but I still washed it.\n\nMACFARLANE I said, “I’m very sorry, Mr. Diesel, I’m supposed to be meeting with Charlize Theron.”\n\nWhat did you learn about each other from this film?\n\nMACFARLANE Third nipple?\n\nTHERON I’d gone through like a two-year period where I wasn’t really enjoying making movies anymore. And this movie really just shook me and made me realize how much I love it. I owe a lot of that to Seth.\n\nEven after he included you in his opening number at the Oscars?\n\nTHERON Don’t talk [trash] about him, O.K.? [laughter] I’ve given you an answer. Take that and don’t talk [trash]."
