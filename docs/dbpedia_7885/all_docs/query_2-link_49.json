        "text": "The Box Office:\n\nUniversal (a division of Comcast Corporation) continues its \"year of no tent-poles\" with Seth McFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West. The picture is produced by Media Rights Capital, Fuzzy Door Productions, and Bluegrass Films while Universal distributes. This is clearly Universal's \"thank you\" for Ted or a down payment on Ted 2. The talking teddy bear comedy became the biggest-grossing R-rated original comedy of all-time two summers ago with $549 million worldwide. This $40m western comedy isn't going to come any where near that figure, nor should it be expected to approach the $49m debut of Neighbors four weekends ago.\n\nIf Ted was a simple concept \"Mark Wahlberg's childhood teddy bear comes to life,\", then this new entry is a bit more complicated. It's a wild-west comedy, filled with movie stars (or at least known entities) yet belonging in a genre not exactly known for commercial success. Oh sure you occasionally have a Django Unchained or a True Grit, but the only thing more rare than a mainstream western is a smash hit mainstream western. Having said that, MacFarlane clearly has a fan base, and Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson surely qualify as \"added value elements.\" The unofficial tracking for the picture is at around $25 million for opening weekend, which sounds about right.\n\nThere really isn't much at stake for this one. MacFarlane continues to make money and play around with his animated empire, and he even used his money and influence to get Fox to create a new Neil deGrasse Tyson-hosted version of Cosmos. For better or worse, Universal has Ted 2 on track for next summer, so even if A Million Ways to Die in the West flops it will merely count as a \"one for me\" project from the comic filmmaker. If it breaks out, of course MacFarlane has that much more influence to do something father outside of his safety zone next time out.\n\nIt's cheap enough that it doesn't have to be a blockbuster in order to make money, and it's unconventional enough that it probably won't be a blockbuster. Once again, when your film doesn't cost $150-$250 million and is expected to start or be part of a franchise, you can just judge the film on its own financial merits. I hope it succeeds mostly because MacFarlane deserves kudos for trying something a bit unconventional and I hope he strays further from the safe zone next time. The film doesn't quite work, but all involved parties deserve kudos for trying and I hope they are rewarded for it.\n\nThe Review:\n\nSeth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West is the most frustrating kind of (somewhat) bad film. It is clearly individualistic in construction, with an amusing point of view to boot. It is filled with notable actors who mostly enjoy the opportunity to cut loose. But if the picture was clearly a passion project, it is also just as clearly from a filmmaker in a place with few people seemingly on hand to rein him in and let him know what ideas are worth keeping and which are worth discarding. Moreover, by casting himself in the lead, the writer/director creates the very definition of a vanity project, one where he is the only one who knows the score and where he eventually develops into the prototypical perfect person. It's not as funny as it needs to be either.\n\nThe picture's central conceit is that, as you might guess from the title, the wild west is a horrible time and place to live in. The title comes from the copious bizarre ways to perish violently. As someone who appreciates comic violence, I got a kick out of the some of the more cartoonish carnage. But much of the film is basically MacFarlane's lowly sheepherder, despondent after his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried, with absolutely nothing to do) dumps him, waxing poetic about how horrible the west is. It's terrific in the first extended monologue, but the notion never builds toward a larger theme or concept and quickly wears thin.\n\nSince MacFarlane doesn't remotely look or act like someone who would be living in the west, the film is a walking-talking anachronism, with the superior-to-all lead espousing wise-beyond-his century opinions and platitudes. Had the filmmaker cast someone who actually looked like they belonged in the time period, the film would have been that much more authentic. Had he cast pretty much anyone else in the lead, he would have lost the whole vanity issue. But as it is, much of the film, especially its first half, feels like a real comic western with a sketch comedy character taking the lead.\n\nThe plot eventually involves a slow-building romance between said sheep herder and a new-to-town gunfighter played by Charlize Theron. Theron is terrific in a rare opportunity to play a relatively normal human being. Theron and MacFarlane has surprisingly robust chemistry, and their relationship genuinely sparks to the point where you start to wonder if the Family Guy creator didn't want to tell more of a straight western romance but felt the need to appeal to his stereotypical fan base. There are plenty of vulgar jokes and gross-out gags, almost none of which really work and most of which feel like distractions or digressions to the story at hand. The romantic material during the middle hour teases what could have been.\n\nAlso tonally jarring is Liam Neeson, as Theron's husband who is also a legendary outlaw. There is plenty of comic violence, but also scenes of a deadly serious Neeson (being allowed to not remotely hide his accent for once) and his cohorts brutally murdering innocent people with the kind of drawn out violence that would befit a Antoine Fuqua picture. The whole subplot feels extraneous, as it amounts to an extended climax after the film's primary arc has actually concluded. MacFarlane shoots the film like a traditional western, with some gorgeous wide shots, but you'll desperately wish he had decided to shoot on old-school 35mm film. The digital video lessens the intended visual impact.\n\nMoreover the copious whining about the west, while arguably accurate, doesn't really build to a grander point. The film is long in the tooth, arguably paced like a conventional western, and yet few of the characters beyond its hero and heroine get much to do other than listen to the all-knowing sheepherder offer his accurate assessment of the time period. Neil Patrick Harris gets a great musical number as Seyfried's new beau, while Sarah Silverman amuses as a sex worker who wants to wait until marriage before sleeping with her boyfriend (Giovanni Ribisi). The cameos amuse and the core romance is surprisingly engaging, but the film overall doesn't quite work. The overall arc, mostly about our sheep-herding hero learning that he really is a great guy while also proving himself above the conventions of his era, just isn't very engaging.\n\nI admire the filmmaker for using his copious capital to do something off the beaten path. A bawdy western comedy, even one packed with movie stars, isn't exactly going the safe route even if you've already agreed to Ted 2. Speaking of Ted, it's interesting to note that the previous film, which I found to be an unexpectedly brilliant commentary on generational nostalgia and arrested development, involved the MacFarlane stand-ins (Mark Wahlberg and his talking bear) being the ones to have to grow up and become better people, while this time around MacFarlane himself starts out as the inherently superior creature among his cast. It's a different and frankly less compelling dynamic. There is plenty to amuse in A Million Ways to Die in the West, but it's not a very good movie. And it's just ambitious enough for that to be genuinely disappointing."
