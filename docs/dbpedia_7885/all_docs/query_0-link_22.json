She is also tapped to star in the upcoming sequel to Ted.\n\nGiovanni Ribisi\n\nGiovanni Ribisi plays MacFarlane's best friend, Edward, a simple cobbler who encourages Seth's sheep-farmer character to jump back into the dating pool. The role was reportedly first offered to Jonah Hill, and Ribisi signed on when he passed on it.\n\nSarah Silverman\n\nIn a white dress and blue heels, comedian Sarah Silverman looked far more angelic than her prostitute character."
