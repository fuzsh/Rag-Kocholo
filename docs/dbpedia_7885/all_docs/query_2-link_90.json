        "text": "\"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" and \"Million Dollar Arm\" might have similar titles, but they couldn't be more different as far as target audience goes. Both movies land on home-video today (Oct. 7), and they also top this week's listing of notable new home-video offerings.\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West (3 stars, out of 5; R; 2014) \"Family Guy\" and \"Ted\" creator Seth McFarlane straps on his six-shooter for a gleefully crude and very R-rated comic Western about a mild-mannered farmer whose affection for a mysterious newcomer to town (Charlize Theron) sets him up for a showdown with a ruthless gunslinger. Those familiar with, and appreciative of, MacFarlane's R-rated humor will find a lot to giggle about here, in a movie that is silly and stupid and over-the-top all at once. Likewise, those who aren't necessarily fans of MacFarlane's -- who wrote and directed, in addition to starring -- will find just as much to be offended by, as he goes out of his way to cross lines and insult pretty much every race, creed and culture. Granted, the whole thing gets off to a slow start and goes on perhaps a bit too long, but as vanity projects go, \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" at least generates its share of laughs -- even if it never quite makes you forget that you probably shouldn't be laughing. Lagniappe: Read a full \"Million Ways to Die in the West\" review here. Feature running time: 1 hour 56 minutes. Rotten Tomatoes score: 33 percent. Metacritic score: 44/100.\n\nMillion Dollar Arm (3 stars, out of 5; PG; 2014) Jon Hamm stars in a feel-good sports drama from Disney, telling the true story of an American sports agent who packed his bags for cricket-crazy India in the hopes of finding the world's next great arm -- and professional baseball's first Indian players. Director Craig Gillespie sticks close to genre convention for his film, dutifully touching all the bases on its way around the sports-drama formula. Still, with the congenial Hamm on board -- not to mention the uplifting nature of what really is a remarkable story -- it makes itself an impossible-to-hate film, one that boasts loads of both humor and heart. The result is a movie that feels like a mashup between \"The Blind Side,\" \"American Idol\" and \"Slumdog Millionaire\" -- and one that easily overcomes its flaws to become an enjoyable bit of escapism. Lagniappe: Read a full \"Million Dollar Arm\" review here. Feature running time: 2 hours 4 minutes. Rotten Tomatoes score: 61 percent. Metacritic score: 56/100."
