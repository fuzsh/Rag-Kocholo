With a mischievous grin on his face, Bohr is depicted blowing orbiting electrons out of his pipe, adding an element of whimsy to this historical illustration. Niels Henrik David Bohr was a distinguished scientist who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922. His groundbreaking work focused on developing the quantum theory of electron orbitals, which revolutionized our understanding of atomic structure. According to Bohr's model, electrons could only occupy specific regions around an atomic nucleus. The artist behind this clever sketch ingeniously captured both the scientific significance and playful nature of Niels Bohr's contributions. Against a clean white background, this monochrome artwork exudes charm and nostalgia from the 19th century. With its attention-grabbing composition and intricate details, this print serves as a delightful homage to one of history's most influential physicists. It beautifully combines elements of comedy with scientific brilliance while showcasing Niels Bohr's unique personality through his iconic pipe smoking habit. Whether you're an admirer of science or simply appreciate artistic pastiches that celebrate great minds like Niels Bohr, this print is sure to be a fascinating addition to any collection or display related to the history of science.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
