They have been awarded prizes in the fields of physics and chemistry, respectively, for their groundbreaking work with superfast lasers used to investigate electrons (Ferenc) and for the development of quantum dots (Moungi), which can be found in TVs today and may contribute to faster electronics in the future. I hope we'll have the opportunity to geek out a bit and discuss exciting science, both up here and on Earth.\n\nFor this call, I'm bringing along a Nobel Prize awarded to the Danish physicist Niels Bohr 101 years ago for his work on the structure of the atom. It's a great honor to be able to have it on my Huginn mission, and I would like to thank the Museum of National History in Denmark for making it possible for me to bring a piece of history into space."
