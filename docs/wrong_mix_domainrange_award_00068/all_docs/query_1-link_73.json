        "text": "The University building is divided into two separate buildings, connected by a tunnel and a skywalk three storeys above ground level, and accommodates approx. 3’000 – 4’000 students and 800 researchers with teaching duties.\n\nThe distinctive, prism-shaped façade gives the building a very particular identity featuring a special design concept by connecting sequences of balconies with filtered daylight. A completely unique composition with exceptional views both from inside and outside the building.\n\nEvery element within the bathroom design matches perfectly with the building’s aesthetics. Our products underline the striking architecture of the building with their exceptional design and quality, as the Laufen Pro toilets and the thin-walled Val washbasins, latter made of the innovative material SaphirKeramik."
