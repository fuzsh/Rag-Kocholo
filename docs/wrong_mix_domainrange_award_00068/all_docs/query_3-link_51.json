        "text": "Born Copenhagen, Denmark, 7 October 1885\n\nDied Copenhagen, Denmark, 18 November 1962\n\nDanish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr provided the first quantum mechanical description of atomic structure that was able to account reasonably well for the observed wavelengths of features emitted and absorbed by atoms in the laboratory and in stars. He received the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.\n\nBohr was born to Christian and Ellen Adler Bohr. He had an older sister, Jenny, and younger brother, Harald, a successful mathematician and Niels's closest friend throughout his life. Christian Bohr was a university professor and physiologist. Just after Niels's birth, Christian was appointed a professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen, replacing Peter Panum, and the Bohrs took up residence in Panum's professorial house.
