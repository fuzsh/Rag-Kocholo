        "text": "Bohr Atomic Model\n\nIn 1912 Bohr went to England to work with British scientist Ernest Rutherford. The year before, Rutherford had developed a model of the atom. In Rutherford’s model, very light, negatively charged electrons circled around a heavy, positively charged nucleus. Bohr combined Rutherford’s idea with some ideas of physicists Max Planck and Albert Einstein.\n\nBohr made his own model of the atom. He claimed that electrons could only occupy particular orbits around the nucleus. He also explained that when an electron jumped from an outer orbit to an inner orbit, energy would be given off. An electron would absorb energy if it jumped from an inner orbit to an outer orbit.\n\nIn 1916 Bohr returned to the University of Copenhagen to work as a professor. There he became director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1920. He won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1922.\n\nA Refuge for Jewish Scientists\n\nWhen Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party took power in Germany in 1933, many Jewish scientists were no longer allowed to work in their German homeland. Bohr used his connections in Denmark to help scientists get out of Germany and to work at his institute at Copenhagen University. From there, scientists would obtain permanent appointment elsewhere, most often in the United States.\n\nThe Atomic Bomb"
