        "text": "Photos courtesy of:\n\nKen Huisjen\n\nWayland is located in northeastern Allegan County on the Rabbit River, approximately a mile east of US-131. This town was first settled back in 1836 when a Colonel Isaac Barnes built a sawmill here. One of his sons, George, eventually became a state representative to the area as well as the first postmaster in 1844. Like many towns in Michigan, Wayland was named after a town by the same name in New York, where many of Michiganï¿½s settlers came from. It became a station on what was then known as the Kalamazoo & Grand Rapids Plank Road , which helped assure its permanence as a lasting community, being incorporating as a village in 1858.\n\nToday, Wayland has grown into a moderate sized suburban community adjacent to the Grand Rapids area. It has several small to mid-sized factories and manufacturing facilities, in addition to its local small businesses and stores.\n\nIf you have any comments or suggestions, please take a minute to write using our contact form.\n\nBack to Main Page.\n\nSee Our RATES For Listing\n\nInfoMI.com is not affiliated with external sites and is not responsible for their content.\n\nCopyright © InfoMI.com 2003"
