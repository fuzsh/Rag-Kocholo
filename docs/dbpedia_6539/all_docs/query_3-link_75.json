        "text": "Wayland Township\n\nThis township, situated on the eastern border of Allegan County, north of the centre, embraces territory designated in the field-notes of the original survey as township number 3 north, of range number 11 west. It was formed from Martin in 1843, and began a separate existence, April 1, 1844.\n\nThe adjoining townships are Leighton on the north, Hopkins on the west, Martin on the south, and Yankee Springs, in Barry County, on the cast. Its surface, generally rolling, was cumbered originally with a heavy growth of timber, the deciduous varieties common to this region predominating. In the vicinity of the present village of Wayland, also in the northeastern and southeastern parts of the township, extensive pine-groves once existed. These beautiful and valuable monarchs of the forest, however, with the exception of Balch's tract, fell early victims to the rapacity of the all-pervading \" shingle-weavers\" of the pioneer period; many of them, indeed, before the laud came into market, or while assessed as non-resident.\n\nWayland soil affords no exception to that which characterizes Michigan lands generally, - i.e. alternating belts or strips of clay and sandy loam, with here and there, in the lower portions, alluvial deposits. Intelligently cultivated, it is productive, and yields generously of fruit, grain, etc. The people are chiefly engaged in agricultural pursuits, wheat, live-stock, and lumber, being the principal articles of shipment.\n\nThe water-courses are unimportant, the principal one being Rabbit River, or the outlet of Mud Lake, which flows to the northwest. Several lakes dot the surface, and together embrace an area of about 900 acres, the largest among them being known as Selkrig's, Boot, Geneva, and Mud Lakes. Gun Lake, the largest body of water in this vicinity, includes within its limits the extreme southeast corner of the township.\n\nEVENTS PRECEDING SETTLEMENT\n\nThe history of Wayland properly begins with the year 1826, when Deputy Lucius Lyon ran its boundaries. A period of over four years then elapsed, when the denizens of its forests were again disturbed by a second surveying- party. This party was headed by Sylvester Sibley, also a deputy United States surveyor, who had contracted to run out the sectional lines of this and many other townships in this part of the State. His work in this township was completed during the month of March, 1831.\n\nAlthough this small portion of the public domain was soon after placed in market, it was not until Jan. 9, 1835, that the first individual purchase of land was made in the present township of Wayland.\n\nOn the date last mentioned Col. Isaac Barnes, who had become the first settler of Richland, Kalamazoo Co., Mich., in 1830, purchased a portion of section 9. Three other tracts only were purchased during the remainder of the year 1835, to wit: part of section 29, Azor Forsyth and Alanson Beals, Washtenaw Co., Mich., Sept. 10, 1835; part of section 6, Isaac and George W. Barnes, Kalamazoo Co., Mich., Dec. 25, 1835; part of section 10, Isaac and George W. Barnes, Kalamazoo Co., Mich., Dec. 25, 1835.

Isaac Barnes, of Gull Prairie, and his son, George W. Barnes, purchased large tracts of government land in the counties of Allegan, Barry, Eaton, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren. In this township they owned lands on sections 2, 3, 6, 9, and 10. On Rabbit River, in the southwest part of section 2, was a mill-site. Surrounding it, and on other lands owned by them in the immediate vicinity, were extensive forests of pine.\n\nThe mill-site was purchased in January, 1836, and during the winter of 1836-37 the Messrs. Barnes built a log house on the site of P. F. Wait's present residence. Upon its completion this house was occupied by Daniel Jackson and wife, from Gull Prairie, Jackson having been hired to come here, keep the house, and board the men then engaged in lumbering and the construction of a saw-mill. The Jacksons remained but about four months, Mrs. Jackson becoming so lonely and homesick in the wild woods that life here was no longer endurable.\n\nIt was necessary, however, that some one should attend to household duties in caring for the wants of the workmen, and, as the owners intended to make this place their permanent residence, Lucius A. Barnes - son of Isaac - was induced to remove from Gull Prairie and occupy the house just vacated by Mr. Jackson. With his young wife he first began housekeeping here in the month of September, 1837. Thus began the first settlement in the present township of Wayland, or Lumberton, as it was then called, - a name adopted by Col. Barnes and family, and by which it was known until its separate organization, in 1844.\n\nThe saw-mill was completed during the winter of 1837- 38, and for several years lumbering was carried on quite extensively. The early products of this mill were hauled - by L. A. Barnes, principally - to Marshall, Battle Creek, and Kalamazoo. For five or six years the water-supply was abundant, the flow in Rabbit River being about four times its present volume. In 1850 the mill became the property of William B. Hill, and thereafter power was derived from steam.\n\nGeorge W. Barnes never married. He represented this district in the State legislature in 1839, and upon the organization of Martin, the same year, he suggested its name, in honor of President Van Buren. He served as the second supervisor of Martin in 1840, and was prominent in other official capacities. About 1838 or 1839 he became the first postmaster of the \"Wayland\" office, and continued as such for a number of years.\n\nJoel Batchelor, of Plainfield, had the contract for carrying the mails, and Wat Wait, mounted on horseback, was the carrier. The route through this township led over the old diagonal road, which extended from the southwest corner of the township, and David Bradley's residence, to Barnes' Mill. In later years Rathbun A. Pratt ran stages over the same route, and they were succeeded by Lucius A. Barnes. The Bradley post-office was established subsequent to that of Wayland.\n\nIn 1844 he was elected the first supervisor of Wayland, and until his death, which occurred in 1853, he was one of the most prominent men in the eastern part of Allegan County.\n\nCol. Isaac Barnes, who was an early government surveyor and the first settler on Gull Prairie in 1830, and who projected the first improvements in Wayland, died here Feb. 22, 1848. His wife followed him but three days later.\n\nLucius A. Barnes, still a resident of this township, is entitled to prominence as one of the earliest pioneers of Southern Michigan. In 1830 he carried the first mail west from Jackson, (then a hamlet called Jacksonburg) the route extending from the latter place to Gull Prairie. The dwelling of Rev. Mr. Fassett, who lived some six miles west from Sandstone, was then the only one between the two points mentioned. Trips were made on horseback. The following year, with horse- team and wagon, he carried the mail from Marshall, and Battle Creek and Gull Prairie, to Schoolcraft. He also claims to have driven the first horse-team from Gull Prairie to White Pigeon and Niles, to have entered at the White Pigeon land-office, for Louis Campau, the lands now occupied by the city of Grand Rapids, and to have driven the first sleigh into Grand Rapids when its only white inhabitants were Louis Campau, the French trader, and Rev. Leonard Slater, the Indian missionary. Since his first settlement in this town, in 1837, Mr. L. A. Barnes has resided in Ohio and at Green Lake, in Leighton, where he kept hotel for some years in the old building erected by Louis Campau in 1833 or 1834. He again became a citizen of Wayland in 1854.\n\nOrrin Orton, who settled in the present township of Gun Plain in 1835, purchased portions of sections 25 and 36, in this township, in the spring of 1837, and became one of the earliest settlers in Wayland by locating upon the northeast quarter of section 36 during the fall of the latter year. Timothy Gregg, of Hector, Tompkins Co. (now Schuyler Co.), N. Y., bought lauds on sections 27 and 28 in December, 1836. Joseph M., his eldest son, was then a resident of Kalamazoo, Mich. During the spring of 1837, Timothy Gregg, accompanied by his son William H. H., Gregg came to Michigan and occupied a rented place on Grand Prairie, Kalamazoo Co. One year later the father and sons removed to this township and began the improvement of land purchased in 1836. The family first occupied a shanty which stood near Shelby Station. During the summer a road was cut to Barnes' saw-mill, where plank was obtained, when a dwelling, composed of that material, was built upon the premises now owned by William H. H. Gregg. This family were assisted in their labor by George Haywood, who ultimately married Mr. Gregg's daughter and became one of the well-known pioneers of the township. The Greggs raised a crop of corn on John H. Adams' land the first year, and excellent potatoes upon their own, four or five Hills of which would fill a bushel-measure. They also cleared and sowed to wheat some nine acres. Members of this family affirm that their settlement was made prior to that of Orrin Orton, while there are others who assert that Orton was the second settler in the township.\n\nNelson Chambers, the first settler in the northwest quarter of the township, came in with a sleigh during the winter of 1838-39. In June, 1839, he was assessed as owning 80 acres on section 5, valued at $240, and one yoke of oxen, valued at $70. He was very needy at the time of making his beginning here, but by dint of great industry, perseverance, and shrewd management he ultimately amassed -a handsome competency.\n\nAmong others who settled during the year 1839 were Oziel H. Rounds on section 27; Joel Brownson on section 20; his son Apollos P., who early settled upon section 5; Rev. James Selkrig at the mission; and Nelson M. Pollard, who first worked for Mr. Selkrig, but afterwards purchased land on sections 23 and 29.\n\nSELKRIG AND THE INDIAN MISSION\n\nRev. James Selkrig was born in the town of Claverack, Columbia Co., N. Y. His father, Jeremiah Selkrig, gained distinction during the war of the Revolution as one of Washington's aids. Quite early James sought the dangers and excitement of a seafaring life, and served under both the French and American flags. He finally became a resident of Pompey, Onondaga Co., N. Y., a convert and preacher of the Methodist Episcopal faith, and for some years preached at various places in that region. He then adopted the tenets of the Episcopal Church, and was ordained by Bishop Onderdonk, of New York.\n\nIn 1836 he moved from Onondaga Co., N. Y. to the village of Niles, Mich., where he soon after built the first Episcopal -church edifice in that portion of the State. Desirous of having music to aid him in the services, with his own hands he constructed an organ, and presented it to the church. He remained at Niles two years.\n\nAt about this time the scattered bands of Indians still remaining among the settled districts of Michigan attracted the attention of the general government, and a plan was devised of bringing them together under various religious denominations by appropriating certain sums of money to the churches then in existence here, for mission purposes, in lieu of granting yearly annuities to the Indians themselves.\n\nDesiring to improve this opportunity, Bishop McCoskry, then the Episcopal head of this diocese, began looking about him for subjects upon which to bestow the blessings of civilization and the protection afforded by his church. His search was rewarded by the discovery of Chief Sagamaw's band of Ottawa* and a few Pottawattamies, - about 150 in number, - who were dwelling on u peninsula jutting into Gun Lake. These destitute savages, once, with their fellows, the proud and undisputed owners of a large portion of the State, had been gradually forced back from their ancient hunting-grounds, until they knew not where to lay their heads.\n\nIn 1838, Rev. James Selkrig was deputed by the bishop to visit this Indian encampment and to offer those assembled there the benefits of a mission home. Securing the personal aid of Rev. Leonard Slater, an Indian missionary of the Baptist denomination, an audience was had with Sagamaw at his encampment. The chief requested more time for thought upon the matter, and a second meeting was appointed to be held on the north bank of the beautiful sheet of water now known as Selkrig Lake. The bishop was present at this meeting, and at its close the Indians consented to settle on lands to be located near the lake lust mentioned. Thereupon there was purchased for mission purposes, from the government, 160 acres situated on section 20, (The southeast-quarter, which was entered by Samuel A. McCoskry, of Wayne Co., Mich., June 23, 1839. The mission-lands lying on section 23 were entered in the name of Sarah M. Weaver, of Kalamazoo Co., Mich., Jan. 14, 1837.) and from Lawrence Vandewalker, of Kalamazoo, 200 acres, situated upon section 28.\n\nDuring the summer of 1839, Mr. Selkrig and family removed from Niles to the mission. His family consisted of himself, his wife, and three children, named James E., Jeremiah, and Charles F. He settled upon the southeast quarter of the northwest quarter of section 28. His first house was of peculiar construction. The walls consisted of hewn timbers tended at both ends, which were set upright, and secured to both sills and plates by entering a continuous mortise.\n\nThe Indians were established upon the same 40 acres during the summer of 1839, and their first work under the supervision of Mr. Selkrig was the building of their wigwams and a large arbor or bower-house, where religious services were held. Mr. Selkrig's sermons were delivered in English and interpreted by Adoniram Judson, (several years later found frozen to death on the Sager farm) an educated Ottawa, who, during his time, was considered one of the best interpreters in the State.\n\nThese meetings were also regularly attended by many of the early pioneers of the township. A few years after his settlement Mr. Selkrig built the dwelling now occupied by his widow and family, and the old building was then used as the chapel. Until his death, which occurred Oct. 5, 1878, he continued active in the discharge of his labors and if he did not succeed in educating his proteges up to a higher degree of excellence than they have attained elsewhere, most certainly he was afforded the gratification of seeing them become self supporting as agriculturists, and as a class generally law-abiding. Their first chief on these grounds, Sagamaw, was killed by his son-in-law, in 1845 during a drunken quarrel. Pen-ah-sec, or \"Bird,\" then became their chieftain, and upon his death was succeeded by Moses Foster or She-pe-quonk, meaning \"Big Thunder\" who is their present chief. There still remain upon the mission-lands 14 families of those people, or about 75 persons all told. They are Indians still, however, and after more than forty years of daily contact and intercourse with their white neighbors, they retain all the prominent characteristics of their race in features and habits, and as a result their cabins are squalid in appearance, while their style of farming cannot be commended.\n\nSamuel E. Lincoln, a native of the State of New York, with his parents, moved to Ohio at an early day. In 1837 he came to Kalamazoo and worked at his trade as a house carpenter. During the spring of 1840, accompanied by his brother Horatio, he came to the present town of Wayland, and built for Timothy Gregg the first framed barn in the township. This was a large structure 32 by 44 feet ground plan, with posts 16 feet in length, and required to raise it the presence of all the able-bodied men (Wm. H. H. Gregg rode two days to invite these men to the raising) of the territory comprised in the present towns of Wayland, Martin, Hopkins, and Leighton, and several from Gun Plains and Yankee Springs. This barn is still standing.\n\nIn his recollections of events of that time, and of the pioneers who preceded him here, Mr. Lincoln recalls the names of all those already mentioned. He believes that the principals in the first marriage were Richard S. Sage, of Kalamazoo County, and Eveline, daughter of Joel Brownson, and that the ceremony was performed during the winter of 1841 and 1842. The second marriage was that of himself to Miss Brown, Oct. 12, 1843, and the third, Hiram Loomis to Miss Julia Heydenberk, about 1844.\n\nThe first birth occurred in January, 1840, being that of Eliza A. Rounds, daughter of Oziel H. Rounds. Marion Elkins, son of Solomon Elkins, was born the same year. An early death was that of Mary Hamblin, a granddaughter of Abijah Brown. Orrin Orton erected the second framed barn, and George W. Barnes the first framed dwelling, - the building now occupied by F. F. Wait. Mr. Lincoln was also a pioneer in the township of Leighton. He now resides in the village of Wayland.\n\nIn years prior to 1842 among the additional settlers of Wayland were Joseph Heydenberk, on section 7; Solomon Filkins, on section 3; Abijah Brown, sections 27 and 28; John Frantz, section 24; John A. Brown, Hiram Loomis, Thomas Loomis, Calvin Lewis, Joseph and Abel Angel; and before the organization of the township we find here Stephen S. Germond, Luther Martin, John Haywood, and Dr. David Bradley. Dr. Bradley came from Tompkins Co., N. Y., and was an early postmaster; also the first physician, merchant, and tavern-keeper in the township. His place was on the old stage-route, section 28. He removed to Martin Corners in 1854. Twenty-four voters were present at the first township-meeting in 1844, and 28 persons were assessed as resident tax-payers the same year. Their names, location, and acres owned by each will be shown on another page.\n\nOther well-known pioneers (This list includes some Leighton people, the latter township having been attached to Wayland until 1848) who settled in Wayland before the year 1850 were Humphrey Gardner, who came in 1846 John Woodward, Justus Taylor, Myron Briggs, Levi Musher, Amasa Eldred, Cooper Eldred, Levi D. Taylor, Ralph Pratt, William Buchanan, Ambrose Mosher, Alfred Mann, Rev. Samuel Newberry, David Brown, E. F. Waldo, Harlow J. Dean, Tyler Johnson, and George W.

That of 1874 (the latest) returned a total population of 1761 inhabitants. An approximate estimate of the present population places it at about 2400.\n\nCIVIL HISTORY\n\nThis township, originally forming part of Plainfield, was set off as part of Martin in 1839. By an act of the State Legislature, approved March 9,1843, with Leighton, it was organized as Wayland.\n\nFIRST TOWNSHIP ELECTION, Etc.\n\nIt seems that the first township-meeting was not held, however, until the spring of 1844, for we find, by referring to the township records, that the legal voters assembled at the house of Isaac Barnes, April 1, 1844, for the purpose of holding their \"first township-meeting,\" and organized by choosing Isaac Barnes moderator, Joel Bronson, George W. Barnes, and Joseph Heydenberk inspectors, and Luther Martin clerk pro tem. Twenty-four voters were present, and the election resulted in the choice of the following township officers: George W. Barnes, Supervisor; Luther Martin, Township Clerk; Oziel H. Rounds, Treasurer; Stephen S. Germond, Solomon Filkins, Assessors; Isaac Barnes, George W. Barnes, School Inspectors; Nelson Chambers, Joseph Heydenberk, Directors of the Poor; Isaac Barnes, Oziel H. Rounds, Nelson Chambers, Highway Commissioners; George W. Barnes, Stephen S. Germond, Oziel H. Rounds, Nelson Chambers, Justices of the Peace; Calvin Lewis, Nelson M. Pollard, Constables. Joel Bronson was elected overseer of highways in the west district; Samuel K. Lincoln, overseer in the southeast district; Solomon Filkins, overseer in the northeast district; and William S. Hooker, overseer for the district comprising township 4. At the same meeting it was voted -\n\n\"That the bounty on wolves should be $6.00.\n\n\"To raise $150 for township purposes.\n\n\"That the township clerk be authorized to purchase books for record, and ballot-boxes.\n\n\"That the next township-meeting be held at the house of Luther Martin.\"\n\nOn the 19th of June, 1844, the authorities of Martin and Wayland met for the purpose of making an equitable division of township moneys, Wayland receiving $162.85, represented by the following securities:\n\nIn county orders.................,....................... $19.00\n\nTwo notes against George W.

Kelley, 1875; S. S. Fox, 1876-80.\n\nEDUCATIONAL\n\nWe have not learned that any school or schools were taught in the township prior to its separation from Martin, and it is very probable that there were none.\n\nAt the first township election in Wayland, held April 1, 1844, Isaac and G. W. Barnes were elected school inspectors.\n\nOn the 4th of May, 1844, the Messrs. Barnes, acting in an official capacity, organized three school districts, describing their boundaries as follows:\n\n\"District No. 1 will contain sections 34, 35, 36, in township four north, of range eleven west, and sections 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, and 12 in township three north, of the same range.\n\n\"District No. 2 will comprise sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19, and 20, in township three north, of range eleven west.\n\n\"District No. 3 will comprise sections 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, and 35, in township three north, of range eleven west.\"\n\nOn the same day, Appollos P. Brownson, as moderator of district No. 2, took his oath of office, and on the 15th day of May the inspectors were notified that all the districts were duly organized.\n\nMiss Belinda Eldred, daughter of the first settler of Martin, received a certificate to teach in district No. 2 (the Chambers neighborhood) June 25, 1844, and upon assuming control of the twelve little barefoots intrusted to her supervision, became the first teacher in the township. The house, a small log structure which had formerly done duty as Chambers' shingle shanty, was situated in the village of Wayland, and among the principal patrons were Nelson Chambers. Joseph Heydenberk, and John Parsons. The following winter Miss Eldred taught in the Gregg neighborhood. In later years she became the wife of Ebenezer Wilder, of Martin, where both reside at present writing. In the spring of 1845 the electors of Wayland voted that the sum of $25 be appropriated for township library. Twenty-five volumes for library purposes were purchased soon after, and the township clerk appointed librarian. Among the rules established by the inspectors for his guidance were the following:\n\nFor tearing out a leaf, or obliterating so as to destroy the sense, the fine shall be the price of the book. For breaking a cover, half the price of the book; for turning down a leaf, five cents; for every grease spot, five cents. And all other damages not herein specified shall be at the discretion of the Librarian.\"\n\nMiss Alsina Rose received a certificate to teach in district No. 3, Nov. 15, 1845, and Miss Julia Brownson succeeded her in the same district on the 15th of May, 1846. James Davis, the first male teacher, was the only one receiving a certificate during the year 1847 (November 6th). During the summer of 1848 Euretta Dexter and Mary Jane Forbes received certificates.\n\nOctober 1, 1848, district No. 2 reported 16 scholars; district No. 3, 46 scholars. No report received from district No. 1. Other early teachers are mentioned by years, as follows:\n\n1849. - John Parsons, Myron Driggs, Sarah M. Standish.\n\n1850. - Huldah C. Kimball, Lodaska Karl, Ann Hillyard.\n\n1851. - Mary Jane Forbes, Eliza A. Hoskinson, Eliza L. Sprague.\n\n1852. - Nancy Brownson, Lucy J. Eldred, Ellen M. Lane, Alfred Brownson, Anna E. Hollon, Horace Hana.\n\n1853. - Amanda J. Chambers, Douglass J. Williams, Sylvah Brown, Adam Carpenter, C. C. Ingerson.\n\n1854. - Mary Jane Sedgwick, Eliza A. Hoskinson, Fanny E. Miles, Myra Bloom, Lucy J. Eldred, Albert Sayre.\n\n1855. - Minerva Brown, Sopbronia Gamwold, Margaret Mosher. Prior to 1862, Charles Parsons, Henry Selkrig, Jane Nickerson, Sarah Nickerson, Matilda Rogers, Augusta K. Harrison, Eliza A. Rounds, Vina Stephens, Ellen Utley, Surah Fisk, Mr. Cobb, Sylvia Brown, Julia Eager, Amanda Colby, Henrietta Burdick, Helen M. Magown, John I. Cutler, Dr. Stone, Eliza Sterns, Eliza M. Ives, Florence Gardner, Henrietta Page, Ellen A. Houston, Emma Pinney, Charlotte Bassett. Addis McMartin, Matilda Stanley, Mary E. Seaver and Sarah A. Clark taught in the various districts.\n\nVILLAGE OF WAYLAND\n\nThis is an incorporated village of some 700 inhabitants, situated in the northwest corner of the township of Wayland. It is a station on the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, distant twenty-seven miles north of Kalamazoo, twenty-one miles south from Grand Rapids, twenty miles northeast of Allegan, the county-seat, one hundred and seventy-two miles from Detroit, and one hundred and sixty- eight from Chicago.\n\nThe first settler on its site was Nelson Chambers, who came here in the winter of 1838-39, and began an improvement on the west half of the southwest quarter of section 5. His earliest work seems to have been that of a shingle-maker, and the products of his labors were hauled with ox-team to the distant markets of Battle Creek and Kalamazoo. About the year 1840, Apollos P. Brownson settled north of him, on section 5, Joseph Heydenberk to the southwest, on section 7, and John Parsons on the west, in the extreme northeast corner of the present township of Hopkins.\n\nThese were the first families to settle in the neighborhood for many years known as \"Chambers' Corners.\" In 1844 a school was established here, but nothing indicated this point as the site of a village until the projection of the Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids Plank-Road in 1852. This road was completed in 1854.\n\nNelson Chambers then opened the Wayland House. The Wayland post-office was removed from Barnes' Mill to the Corners, and Norton Briggs became postmaster, and tollgate-keeper. In 1857 and '58, Eli F. Clark, Isaac N. Hoyt, William V. Hoyt, and Edwin E. Hoyt settled here. Oliver Edwards sold the first goods in 1800, and was followed in the mercantile business by Theo. D. Van Valkenburg. William E. White, J. M. Berry, and Clark & Henika.\n\nIn 1861, Israel Kellogg, who owned an extensive tract of pine in this immediate vicinity, also saw-mills and a tanuery one-half mile north of the Corners, placed on record a village plat known as \"Lomax City.\"\n\n(The original plat was dated Aug. 10,1861. Additions have since been wade by Norton Briggs, Aug. 15, 1862; by Albert E. Sawyer, May 2, 1866; by Franklin M. Miles, Dec. 31, 1866; and by Israel Kellogg, Oct. 8, 1870.)\n\nIn 1865 the business of the village was conducted chiefly by William Seaver, hotel-keeper; Nelson Chambers, William E. White & Sons, and J. M. Berry, general merchants; T. D. Van Valkonburg, drugs and groceries; George Henika, furniture-store; William E. White & Co., pailfactory and planing-mill; Jonathan Sessions, shoemaker; H. T. Stringham and David Stockdale, blacksmiths; Dan. Slade, restaurant and grocer. The physicians were Drs. Graves, Palmer, Clark, and Ball; C. E. Davison, surgeon- dentist; and the total population numbered about 175 inhabitants.\n\nAfter the close of the war, and during the excitement produced by the building of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, many families settled, and to 1869, at the time the village was incorporated, there were quite as many here as the village can boast to-day.\n\nThe Lake-Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad was first completed, and, as its roadbed at Hilliard's Station was but four miles distant west from Wayland, there were many here who did not believe the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Company would run their line through that village. Consequently, an exodus (though a small one) took place. The latter road, however, was completed in the summer of 1870, since which time not many important changes have occurred, except at the station where are situated William E. White's grist-mill, a saw-mill, and a large unoccupied building erected for the purpose of manufacturing chairs. In the village proper the most recent acquisition is a commodious brick school building, which was completed in 1879 at a cost of $4500, including site, etc.\n\nWAYLAND POST-OFFICE.\n\nTheo. D. Van Valkenburg succeeded Norton Briggs as postmaster, under Lincoln's administration, and was in turn succeeded by John Chappie, the present incumbent, who was appointed by President Johnson.\n\nVILLAGE CORPORATE HISTORY\n\nAt the fall meeting of the Allegan County board of supervisors, held in the year 1868, the village of Wayland was duly incorporated, and section 6 and the west half of section 5 designated as its limits. By this act inspectors of election were appointed, and the electors directed to assemble on the first Monday in December, 1868, for holding their first charter election.\n\nIn accordance with the power vested in them, the electors of the territory so incorporated assembled at White's Hall, on Monday, Dec. 7, 1868, for the purpose of choosing their first board of village officers. As directed in the act, William E. White, Edward M. Fitch, and Henry C. Garrett performed the duties of election inspectors. One hundred and twenty-one votes were polled for candidates for the office of president, of which number Edward M. Fitch received one hundred and four. Other officers elected were William E. White, Alfred H. Bostwick, George W. Pease, Isaac Buskirk, James F. Halbert, Robert B. Deuel, Trustees; Norton Briggs, Treasurer; Henry C. Garrett, Clerk; Edwin E. Hoyt, Marshal; Dan. G. Slade, Poundmaster.\n\nThe first meeting of the village council was held Dec. 8, 1868, there being present the president and full board of trustees. This meeting and other early ones were held in William E. White's office, for which he received fifty cents per night. On the 26th of December, 1868, a petition signed by twenty-six citizens was presented to the common council, praying that gaming-tables \"may not be suppressed.\" This enlightened sentiment did not prevail, however.\n\nBy an act of the State Legislature, approved March 30, 1869, the village charter was revised, and the boundaries enlarged so as to include the following-described territory: The west one-half of section 5, the whole of section 6, the north one-half of north one-half of section 7, the north one-half of northwest quarter-section 8, in Wayland, and the south one-half of section 31, and the southwest quarter of section 32, in Leighton.\n\nMay 13, 1869, Joseph W. Hicks, county surveyor, established a point between sections 5 and 6,160 rods north of the south Hue of said sections, as the place from which to predicate and describe the commencement of village streets.\n\nIn February, 1873, Nelson Chambers and others petitioned the State Legislature, praying that the village incorporation be vacated. They did not succeed, as counter-remonstrants claimed that taxation was not more burdensome here than to people outside of the village, and that corporation property to the amount of $2500 would revert to the county of Allegan in case of vacation. During the same year, however, that portion of the village territory belonging to Leighton was excluded from the corporate limits.\n\nAnother ineffectual effort was made in May, 1874, to annul and vacate incorporation. This petition was signed by Nelson Chambers and forty-six others.\n\nThe elective officers of the village are a president, six trustees, a recorder, a treasurer, an assessor, and a marshal, all of whom are elected annually, except trustees, who serve two years, three of their number only being elected annually. Street commissioners, fire-wardens, and poundmastcrs are appointed.\n\nVILLAGE OFFICERS\n\nThe following is a list of the village officers elected annually for the years from 1809 to 1880, inclusive: 1869. - Edward M.

Total number of votes polled, 139.\n\nFIRE DEPARTMENT AND WATER-SUPPLY\n\nAt a regular meeting of the village common council, held Jan. 30, 1869, the first action was taken for the protection of property against fire, and by a majority vote hooks, ladders, fire-buckets, etc., were ordered to be procured and placed under the orders of Fire-Warden William H. White. Ladders and pike-poles were supplied in April, 1869, and 100 buckets in November of the same year. It was voted at the charter election in March, 1873, by a vote of 52 to 39, to obtain a supply of water by hydraulic power. But this scheme went no farther than making a preliminary survey, submitting reports, etc. During the year 1875 the hooks and ladders were mounted on a truck. A cistern, costing $130, was completed, and Fire Engine No. 119, of the city of Grand Rapids, together with 200 feet of hose, couplings, etc., was purchased at a cost of $400.\n\nOn the 23d of March, 1876, the following persons were accepted by the council as firemen of the village: E. E. Hoyt, T. B. Garrett, Frank Henika, J. H. D. Snell, N. H. Sherwood, W. H. White, H. C. Garrett, A. H. Garrett, William L. Heazlit, Frank Carr, M. Kellogg, and A. B. Blanott for the engine company, and Frank Hoyt, Fred. Quinlan, W. H. Schuh, Frank Sooy, L. D. Chappie, Carl Snell, Gus Sooy, Jonathan Sessions, Otto Gleason, W. Olds, Chauncey Halbert, and Myron Carpenter for the hose company. Two hundred foot of additional hose was purchased in 1877. The fire apparatus of the present consists of the engine, hose-cart, hook and-ladder truck, etc., already mentioned.\n\nPROFESSIONAL MEN\n\nPhysicians. - The first physician to practice in the village was Dr. Remington. The country was sparsely set- bled, his patients few in number, and when not professionally employed he worked in Hoyt's shingle-mill. Dr. Mack, an eclectic, succeeded him. Neither of these remained here long.\n\nDr. John Graves, a graduate of the Cleveland (Ohio) Homoeopathic College, came to Wayland from Warrensville, Cuyahoga Co., Ohio, in April, 1862, and is still here.\n\nDr. James Ball was born in Cortland Co., N. Y., and graduated at the Fairfield Medical College, Herkimer Co., N. Y. He practiced his profession in Cortland Co., N. Y., until 1842, when he removed to Homer, Calhoun Co., Mich. Ten years later he became a resident of the State of Iowa, and remained there eleven years, all this time continuing the practice of medicine. During the years 1864-65, as surgeon, he served with Gen. Sully's command against the Indians in the Northwest. He was mustered out of the United States service at Sioux City, Iowa, and arrived in Wayland in December, 1865, where he still continues his practice. The physicians here at the time of his arrival were Drs. Graves, Palmer, and Clark.\n\nAmong other physicians who have practiced at various periods since, but are not here now, have been Drs. Pease, Porter, Way, and Stone. The village physicians of the present are Drs. John Graves, Horace J. Turner, Andrews, and Ryne.\n\nDr. C. E. Davison, surgeon-dentist, formerly of Northampton, Mass., removed to the village of Wayland in May, 1865, and opened an office for the practice of his profession.\n\nHe has been very successful. Drs. Piper, of Allegan, and Coats, of Otsego, were then the only practicing dentists in the county. Both have since died, leaving Dr. Davison the pioneer dentist of Allegan County. He has also always taken an active part in the advancement of the religious and educational interests of the village of Wayland.\n\nAttorneys. - Hiram Averill, who settled here in 1866, was the first resident expounder of Blackstone in the village. He is now a citizen of Dorr township. L. Chase Goodwin, now of Grand Rapids, came a year or so later.\n\nCol. Edward M. Fitch, who served during the Mexican war as lieutenant-colonel of the Third Ohio Cavalry, also settled in the village at about this time. He became the first president of the village in 1869, and has since filled most worthily many other positions.\n\nAlbert H. Fenn, now of Allegan, became a resident about 1870.\n\nThe present attorneys of the village are Edward M. Fitch and David Stockdale, the latter the supervisor of the township since the spring of 1876.\n\nSECRET BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATIONS\n\nWAYLAND LODGE, No. 129, I. 0. 0. F. This lodge was instituted Feb. 24,1869, by Grand Master J. S. Curtis, of East Saginaw. The officers first installed were Edward M. Fitch, N. G.; Titus Doan, V. G.; John Graham, Sec.; Norton Briggs, Treas. The remaining charter members were J. Simkins, B. L. Lee, E. W. Powers, P. H. Schuh, William Seaver, and James Armstrong. Five new members were initiated the same evening, viz., W. W. Briggs, William V. Hoyt, C. H. Daugherty, O. D. Rowe, and G. L. Doan. The first meetings were held in White's Hall, and continued there until November, 1873, when the lodge occupied its present rooms over John Chappie's store. About 8300 have been expended for furnishing the hall, etc.\n\nThe presiding officers of the lodge since the first installation have been as follows: For the last half of 1869, Titus Doan; 1870, James Armstrong, John Graham; 1871, Charles H. Daugherty, Paul H. Schuh ; 1872, William V. Hoyt, William Seaver; 1873, Josiah Simkins, William W. Briggs; 1874, Norton Briggs, Josiah Simkins; 1875, John Chappie, Edward M. Fitch; 1876, Ephraim S.

Other officers of the present are Frank S. Sigler, V. G.; Edward M. Fitch, Sec.; Paul H. Schuh, Per. Sec.; John Chappie, Treas.\n\nIncluding charter members, initiations, and admissions on card, the lodge has had a total membership of 180. There are now 82 dormant, and 53 active members. Regular meetings are held Tuesday evening of each week.\n\nJAMES FENTON LODGE, No. 224, F. AND A. M.\n\nThis lodge began work under a dispensation dated Feb. 1, 1867, and the first meeting was held in the village of Wayland, February 4th of the same month. There were 8 original members, and the first officers installed were George W. Pease, W. M.; Robert Deuel, S. W.j Ansel G. Smith, J. W.; J. H. D. Snell, Sec.; Seth Shattuck, Treas.; D. R. Latham, S. D.; William Brown, J. D.; and A. N. Worden, Tyler. Their charter bears date Jan. 9, 1868. The lodge is in a flourishing condition, and numbers 64 members. The present board of officers are- I. N. Hoyt, W. M.; V. P. Falls, S. W.; F. G. Chamberlain, J. W.; Eli F. Clark, Sec.; Geo. B. Chambers, Treas.; E. Sigler, S. D.; A. Wallbricht, J. D.; Milo Carpenter, Tyler.\n\nRELIGIOUS.\n\nFIRST METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH OF WAYLAND\n\nThis church is by several years the oldest religious organization in the township. For about ten years previous to 1856 a class had been formed, and religious services held in the \"old red school-house\" by preachers from the Gun Plain and Otsego Circuits. Joseph Heydenberk,J Elizabeth Heydenberk, H. Lester and wife. J Abram Buskirk and wife,J William Buskirk, David M. Griswold; Mrs. Eldred,J Mathew Van Duzen, Lydia Van Duzcn, Stephen S. Germond, Mary Germond, Darius Starr, Mary Suirr,J Abijah and Elizabeth}; Brown were among the first members of this class.\n\nThe pastoral labors of Rev. Amos Wakefield, in the fall of 1856, resulted in a large addition of members, and in response to a petition from this class the session of the Michigan Annual Conference held at Coldwater, Mich., in October, 1856, established the Wayland Circuit, also appointing Rev. Porter Williams to its pastorate.\n\nAt the first Quarterly Conference, held in Wayland, Dec. 6, 1856, the following was ordered placed on record : \"Be it remembered that the Wayland Circuit of the Methodist Episcopal Church was organized by Bishop S. A. Morris at the annual session of the Michigan Conference, held at Coldwater Oct. 1,1856.\" From the minutes of this Quarterly Conference it also appears that the estimating committee recommended the paying to Brother Williams a salary of 8100 per year. The people, however, were more liberal than the committee, and paid him $180.86, for which increase Brother Williams was undoubtedly grateful. The pastors who have followed Mr. Williams on this circuit have been Revs. Amos C. Beach, in 1857; L. M. Bennett, 1858; N. Cleveland, 1859; James Billings, 1860 -6l ; W. B. Blowers, 1862-03; Charles H. Fisher, 1864 -65; J. R. Latham, 1866; Ira R. A. Wightman, 1867; James E. White, 1868-70; Gilbert A. Phillips, 1871-73; George E. Hollister, 1874; Linus Bothwick, 1875-76; J. P. Force, 1877; T. J. Spencer, 1878; W. J. Hathaway, 1879.\n\nDuring the pastorate of Mr. Blowers, in 1862, measures were entered into for the erection of a church edifice. Before completing the work, however, he entered the army as chaplain, where he died.\n\nIn 1864, during the pastorate of Rev. Charles H. Fisher, a neat and commodious building, with a seating capacity for 200 persons, was erected at a cost of $2750, on the corner of Church and Maple Streets; but it was not completed and dedicated until the following year, - August 10th, - when Rev. George B. Joslyn, late president of Albion College, conducted the dedicatory services. The Wayland\" Boys in Blue\" ornamented the pulpit with a magnificent Bible, while the trustees adorned the building with a $600 mortgage. The latter was finally removed in 1870, through the exertions of Rev. James E. White.\n\nPrevious to October, 1866, a union Sabbath-school had been conducted jointly by the Congregational and Methodist Episcopal Churches; but, this union school having outgrown the seating capacity of either church edifice, the Methodist Episcopal Sabbath-school was organized with H. S. Warren as its first superintendent, and $100 was raised for a new Sunday-school library.\n\nIn 1869, Rev. James E. White (by subscriptions from the citizens generally) procured and caused to be placed in the church tower one of the finest-toned bells in Western Michigan. During 1873 there was purchased for parsonage purposes a house on Maple Street, fronting the public square. The present members of this church are GO in number. A flourishing Sabbath-school, of which C. E. Davison is superintendent, numbers 80.\n\nCHURCH OF CHRIST\n\nThis society was organized April 2, 1877, the original members being H. T. Stringham, I. B. Smith, P. Smith, M. Blowers, E. Blowers, H. D. Spaulding, E. Spaulding, E. S. Linsley, T. Ide, J. Gleason, R E. Woodard, L. McKean, I. Judson, S. Nelson, and D. Allen.\n\nTheir first pastor was Rev. D. N. Severance. He has been succeeded by Revs. M. B. Rawson and E. C. Faunce. A handsome church edifice, costing $2000, was dedicated March 7, 1879. It has sittings for 325 persons. This church is in a prosperous condition, and at the present time numbers 181 members.\n\nOTHER WAYLAND CHURCHES\n\nA Congregational society was organized in January, 1800, and a church edifice erected the same year. The original members were 17 in number, - Rev. A. McKay their first pastor. Official members of this church were requested to furnish data concerning the history of their organization, but failed to do so, owing doubtless to the animosity shown his enterprise by their present preacher.\n\nAt the village of Bradley is a Methodist Episcopal society of some 75 members. Their meetings are held in a hall. They propose, however, to erect a commodious church edifice at a time not far distant.\n\nVILLAGE OF BRADLEY\n\nBradley is a station on the line of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, three miles directly south of Wayland. It contains a store of general merchandise, drug-store, hotel, several small mechanical shops, and about 100 inhabitants. Its name is derived from David Bradley, who was the first postmaster of an office of the same name, situated on section 28, on the old mail-route in use prior to the building of the plank-road.\n\nJoel Brownson, Esq., was the first settler in the vicinity of the present village of Bradley. On the completion of the plank-road, in 1854, several other families settled here, and proposed the establishment of a village. The postoffice was removed from its original location to this point, a hotel built, and other interests projected. Shortly after, Uriah Gregory, who had a steam saw-mill, store, etc., on section 10, through political influence got the post-office transferred to his place of business, and himself appointed postmaster. Another turn of the political wheel, however, established a new office at Bradley, and Joel Brownson became postmaster. Among the earliest merchants were Jarvis J. Joy and Josiah E. Harding.\n\n[Source: \"History of Allegan and Barry counties, Michigan\", 1880]"
