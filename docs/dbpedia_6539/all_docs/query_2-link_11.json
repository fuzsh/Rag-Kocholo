        "text": "An eastern Kentucky community is making use of a building that is nearly 90 years old and is now getting state money to make more improvements.\n\nThe Wayland gymnasium is getting $750,000 for a facility that officials believe will make it a regional attraction.\n\nThe money is from Kentucky’s Community Development Block Grant and Wayland is one of 12 projects in the state receiving a share of the $8.5 million fund.\n\n“When we invest in our communities that investment helps improve the lives of our families and supports economic growth and new jobs,” Gov. Andy Beshear said.\n\nThat's what Wayland city leaders are hoping will happen with the $750,000 in state funds\n\n“It will give us starting monies to do a new two story addition to the back of the gymnasium,” Wayland Mayor Jerry Fultz said.\n\nFultz said the addition will have public restrooms, a walking track and an elevator. He also said there will be additional display areas to showcase sports memorabilia from the region, highlighting the accomplishments of area athletes which he expects the Mountain Sports Hall of Fame will be a draw for visitors.\n\n“That facility then becomes something that we could possibly do gun shows and tool shows,” he said. “We’ve had those contacts asking about coming, but without the bathrooms and space in the back makes it very difficult.”\n\nThe building is being used on a limited basis but mayor Fultz says it's possible for the building to be a regional draw, citing an example from 2017.\n\n“We hosted a Smithsonian exhibit for five weeks. We had over 5,000 people come through Wayland,” he said.\n\nCity leaders continue to apply for grant funding because the $750,000 is only half the money needed to finish the planned addition to the gym."
