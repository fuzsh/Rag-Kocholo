        "text": "Urgent care is a healthcare service focused on providing immediate, non-life-threatening medical attention. Urgent care centers treat conditions such as sprains, cuts, burns, and common illnesses and offer a range of services, including diagnostic and preventive care like immunizations and physicals. With an estimated 15,000 clinics in the U.S., urgent care centers operate beyond traditional primary care office hours, offering a convenient and lower cost alternative to emergency rooms for urgent but minor health issues.\n\nA walk-in clinic is a type of healthcare facility that provides medical care to patients without the need for an appointment. These clinics cover a range of services such as urgent care, occupational medicine, and primary care with walk-in availability. They cater to non-emergent health issues, offering a convenient option for accessible medical attention. Walk-in clinics vary from free services provided by government, charity, or foundation-operated facilities to private clinics with affordable rates, serving as a practical alternative for minor illnesses and injuries outside of traditional doctor's offices and emergency rooms.\n\nHistorically, urgent care centers were strictly an on-demand, walk-in healthcare service. More recently, as consumer behaviors and expectations have evolved, many urgent care clinics have begun offering book ahead visits, allowing consumers to select a same-day or next-day time that works best for their schedule. Use Solv to find a Wayland urgent care center that offers advanced bookings (or appointments) and book online.\n\nYes. Most primary care doctor offices are open during routine work hours, Monday thru Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Conversely, most of the urgent care centers in Wayland are available after hours, on weekends, and many holidays. Typical urgent care hours are 8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily, although location-specific hours may vary.\n\nThe cost of a visit to an urgent care in Wayland varies, with cash prices for the base visit generally ranging from $100 to $175. Additional treatments, such as lab tests, X-rays, or immunizations, can increase costs, typically between $50-150 each. If you're using insurance, expect a co-pay between $20 and $50, depending on your plan and whether the clinic is in-network. Prices differ based on location, so it's best to check directly with the urgent care center and your insurance provider for accurate cost estimates.\n\nHow to Treat Bed Bug Bites: 5 At-home Treatments\n\nBed bugs are tiny insects that are notoriously difficult to get rid of.
