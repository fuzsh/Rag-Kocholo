        "text": "The Wayland Area Chamber of Commerce would like to extend a warm welcome to all who come to our beautiful city. Whether you reside here, are employed here, are looking to relocate here, or are simply here on a visit- Welcome!\n\nWayland is located on the east side of beautiful Allegan County, halfway between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo. Many people are drawn to Wayland due to the rural environment yet easy access to US-131. The City of Wayland is located off of U.S. 131 at exit 64 in the northeastern corner of Allegan County, Michigan. This growing community is approximately 30 minutes south of the City of Grand Rapids, 40 minutes north of the City of Kalamazoo and 45 minutes east of Lake Michigan. The close proximity to major highways makes living in Wayland ideal for those working anywhere in West Michigan and beyond.\n\nRecently chosen as a “Michigan Main Street Community,” Wayland is proud of the generous volunteers who worked diligently to achieve this designation. The hard work and dedication will continue in the future to accomplish the mission of the program – the revitalization of our terrific downtown. If you are interested in volunteering or would like more information on the program, please visit their website at www.downtownwayland.com.\n\nWayland offers a multitude of events year-round to keep all ages entertained, including the famous community business expo, golf outings, parades, concerts in the park, car shows, outdoor movies on “Main Street,” folk festivals, 5K runs, Kiwanis Kids Day, Main Street Summer Celebration, Fall Festival, Art Hop, Christmas festivities and much more! With our beautiful parks for playing or picnicking, and close proximity to lakes and rivers, Wayland is known for our perfect location.\n\nWayland was established in 1868 and was largely a farming and lumber community. Approximately 4079 people currently reside in the City of Wayland. Wayland is a wonderful community to raise a family in as well as for anyone who wants a sense of community. Year-round, residents can be found enjoying the parks, parades, summer outdoor movie nights, summer concerts in the park, downtown events, fire department breakfasts, car shows, VFW fish fry’s, summer running clubs, Kiwanis kids events, and so much more! Wayland – a great place to Live, Work, Play, and Do Business!\n\nThe chamber encourages you to support your local businesses by shopping locally first.
