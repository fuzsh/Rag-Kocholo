        "text": "On Thursday, a potential vice presidential candidate took the stage at an Oklahoma Democratic Party fundraiser.\n\nParty officials said Gov. Andy Beshear (D-Ky.) is on the shortlist for the nod.\n\nThe \"veepstakes\" are heating up ahead of current Vice President Kamala Harris's expected running mate announcement next week.\n\nGov. Beshear spoke about his own experience winning as a Democrat in red Kentuckyâ€”and hinted at getting a promotion.\n\n\"Yes, while I run as a proud Democrat, the moment I win I take that hat off and I serve every single citizen of Kentucky... And maybe, just maybe, every citizen of the United States of America,\" he noted.\n\nRepublican nominee and former President Donald Trump announced his vice presidential pick during his party's convention in July.\n\nHe tapped Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) for the number two job.\n\nGov. Beshear took shots at Trump but spent even more time talking about the author and first-term senator.\n\nHe asserted, \"J.D. Vance ain't from Kentucky, he ain't from Appalachia, and he ain't gonna be your vice president.\"\n\nOklahoma will send delegates to the Democratic National Convention set to begin Aug. 19 in Chicago. The virtual roll call to officially nominate Harris as the party's presidential nominee began on Thursday.\n\nFox News reported that other potential picks include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nReports vary on whether North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is still under consideration, but some have said he's removed himself from the process.\n\nHarris will be holding a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday where she is expected to announce her vice presidential pick.\n\nWhile Gov. Beshear didn't say outright how his chances were looking, his remarks implied he was still in the running."
