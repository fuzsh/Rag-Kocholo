        "text": "I recently rode the Dawkins Line Rail Trail, starting from the Jane Beshear trailhead to the Hager Hill section, and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The gates along the trail are quite narrow, posing a challenge for cyclists maintaining any significant speed. However, they are now clearly visible, thanks to fresh coats of paint. Adding historical or informational markers along the trail would indeed enhance the overall experience. I had a wonderful time and look forward to returning soon to explore a different portion of the trail.\n\nWe had an extremely pleasant bike ride today from Swamp Branch to the Licking River (just past Jane Bashear parking area), and only saw one other being on the trail — a riderless horse! He seemed extremely trail savvy and just grunted and moved out of our way. The weather was perfect with on and off pop up showers. The pavement was nice. The Griffith Family farm at Swamp Branch supplied our picnic (and more!) and they had more kind of potato chips than I’ve ever seen.\n\nRode June 2024 on Tuesday, Wed. Saw very few people on trail. Did not see unrestrained dogs. Signage to call sheriff if see unrestrained dogs. The trail is paved and bridges are beautiful. Only 26 miles of trail are open because the second tunnel closed for repair. The only place on trail to purchase food and drink is Griffith Family Farm Store, but they are closed on Sunday. Jenny Wiley State Park is nearby and wonderful place to kayak, hike, and chill out at lodge, cabins, or camping.\n\nA very nice trail. Rode this in mid September on a Friday afternoon, on my way to see Sara Evans in the tiny little town of Clay, WV. (I know this has absolutely nothing to do with the Dawkins trail, but it is the reason I found myself in this part of the country).\n\nI started my ride at the Jenny's Creek Trailhead, and ventured all the way to the shuttered Tip Top tunnel. The trail \"ends\" about 1/2 mile before the tunnel, but you can keep going to check it out. It is worth it....\n\nThe ride was pretty nice, with a great surface, and very empty. In the 45 miles or so I covered, I only encountered a few other riders.\n\nAs several others have stated, the gates are a huge problem. Not only are there too many, they are very difficult to notice. If you are accustomed to riding at a faster pace, be very careful as sometimes you can be right on top of these. The paint is faded on most of these gates, and they blend into the scenery. A couple of times I had to really stop quickly. These are in desperate need of high-visibility paint. Other than these dangerous gates, the trail is worthy of a visit.\n\nOne of the best trail ride experiences I’ve ever had! The people were exceptionally friendly. We unknowingly went on golf cart Saturday & were a little confused as to why golf carts were allowed on the trail. The Mayor stopped us to introduce himself and inquire about us and our trikes. They allow golf carts every 3rd Saturday from 10 a - 3 p to make the trail available to everyone! The Dairy Bar was awesome, and we even got a little history lesson from the owner! Will definitely be back because it became an instant favorite! What a gem!"
