        "text": "Editorial note: We're hitting the road to tell high school basketball stories throughout Kentucky, uncovering the gems of the gyms in all 16 regions. This is the eighth installment of veteran high school sports reporter Jason Frakes' tour of the commonwealth.\n\nWAYLAND – Jerry Fultz moved to this tiny southeastern Kentucky mountain town with his family in 1955 and 55 years later became mayor.\n\nHe remembers leaving for college in Louisiana in 1967, coming back to the area in 1980 when his mother got ill and being sickened by what had happened during the 13 years in between.\n\n“I was in disbelief about what I found,” Fultz said. “I was so disgusted with the kids and the way the place looked. It was run down. It was horrible. &mldr;\n\n“Something happened inside. I decided, ‘You can run, or you can stay and try to make a difference.’”\n\nThere’s not much to see in this town of about 400 people. Fultz said many of his former classmates at Wayland High School “want to come back home,” but the town has insufficient housing. Fultz said 90% of the homes in the town “are old coal-camp houses that aren’t even insulated.”\n\nThe Wayland Historical Community Center is the town meeting place and features a 1950s-style “fountain room” with a soda stand and jukebox. The center’s Denver Collier Room includes artifacts and equipment used at the Elk Horn Coal Corporation mines that closed in 1954.\n\nBut there’s one building left in town that gives Fultz hope for the town’s future. Up on the hill to the left as visitors enter town on Route 7 stands a white building where “the greatest high school player who ever lived” – Adolph Rupp’s words – once played.\n\nAlso: What to know about basketball in the 15th Region, including top rivalry, place to eat\n\nThis is the home of “King” Kelly Coleman – the highway into town is named for him - and Fultz believes the gymnasium where the former basketball star once played can become the heartbeat of the community once again.\n\nPeople from around Kentucky and the entire nation still come to Wayland, just to see the gym where Coleman once played.\n\n“People lost hope for a long time, kind of wandered through the wilderness,” Fultz said of Wayland’s residents. “Now there’s a spark of hope because they see some things happening. &mldr;\n\n“I believe with all my heart that there is something special happening. I don’t know what it is, but there’s something happening. I think we’re building a foundation for something special in this area.”\n\nA scoring machine\n\nColeman, who died at the age of 80 last June after battling cancer, is the all-time leading scorer in Kentucky boys basketball history, tallying 4,337 points before graduating in 1956. He was Kentucky’s first official Mr. Basketball winner, though Lafayette’s Vernon Hatton (1954) and Male’s Kenny Kuhn (1955) were later honored with the award after their playing days.\n\nColeman led Wayland to a third-place finish in the 1956 Sweet 16 and still holds state tournament records for points in a game (68 against Bell County in the third-place game), rebounds in a game (28 against Carr Creek in the semifinals) and points in a single tournament (185, 46.3 points per game).\n\nMore: Sixty-four years since Sweet 16 title, Carr Creek's legacy lives on Kentucky mountains\n\nPrior to that tournament, an airplane dropped leaflets over the city of Lexington, proclaiming, “Wayland’s King Kelly Coleman Is In Town” J.R. VanHoose, the 1998 Kentucky Mr. Basketball from Paintsville and a friend of Coleman’s, said Coleman never got over being booed by some fans who were disappointed that he scored “only” 28 points in the semifinal loss to Carr Creek.\n\n“You can tell it had a huge impact on him personally,” VanHoose said.\n\nAfter brief stints at Marshall and Eastern Kentucky University, Coleman ended up at Kentucky Wesleyan, where he scored 2,077 career points and was a two-time All-American. Gary West, author of “King Kelly Coleman: Kentucky’s Greatest Basketball Legend,” said Coleman quit the team before playing in the third-place game of the 1960 NCAA College Division Basketball Tournament.\n\n“He was totally unpredictable,” West said. “He was that way as a high school player and that way in college. &mldr; He said he didn’t want to play in some consolation game, but it ended up costing him a chance at the Olympic Trials.”\n\nColeman was the No. 11 pick in the 1960 NBA draft by the New York Knicks, but he was waived by the team six months later.\n\nHe later played for the Baltimore Bullets of the Eastern Professional Basketball League and the Chicago Majors of the American Basketball League. When the ABL folded in 1963, Coleman joined the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nColeman was elected to the Kentucky High School Athletic Association Hall of Fame in 1989 but declined the honor. Coleman had not been elected to the hall’s first class in 1988, which included 26 members.\n\n“He’d always say, ‘I might not have been No. 1. But I sure wasn’t 27th,’” VanHoose said with a laugh.\n\nBefore his death, Coleman gave orders to those closest to him that he was not to be added to the hall posthumously.\n\n“He should have been in that first class,” Fultz said.\n\nRestoring the gymnasium\n\nWayland High School closed in 1972, merging with Garrett, Martin and Maytown to form Allen Central High School. In 2017, Allen Central and South Floyd merged to form Floyd Central High School.\n\nWhen Fultz became mayor in 2010, he set out to buy the old Wayland school building and gymnasium from a local businessman who lived on the property and also ran a liquor store. Visitors could pay $30 to play basketball for two hours in the old gym.\n\nThe businessman finally sold the property to the city for $225,000.\n\nYou may like: 'The whole town just loves this team': Undefeated Tomcats bringing pride back to Ashland\n\n“I probably would have paid a million for it,” Fultz said with a laugh.\n\nFultz said the community lost its meeting place and identity when the school closed, but he’s using grant money to restore the gymnasium. He hopes to install a walking track around the top of the bleachers and turn it into a community center. The nearby Mountain Sports Hall of Fame also is being developed, and a statue of Coleman also is in the plans.\n\n“The ultimate goal is to establish the heartbeat out there again,” Fultz said. “That sports piece is a thread that runs so true across the state of Kentucky, especially in these little mountain coal camps.”\n\nVisitors also might notice a trailer that sits next to the old school. For the last 18 months or so of his life, it’s where Coleman lived, though not many people knew it.\n\nVanHoose, for one, did know but kept it a secret for the most part.\n\n“There’s somebody up there on the hill, but we’re not going to tell you he’s up there,” VanHoose would think when he’d give visitors a tour of the Wayland gym. “The man you’re looking for is up there. He’s probably watching you.\n\n“Some of our close friends who would come to see the gym. We’d let them show up and be like, ‘We’re going to take you somewhere else. Hey, this is King Kelly’s house.’”\n\nAnd forever King Kelly’s town.\n\nMore gems: How a 'folk hero' from Hanson, Kentucky, set a basketball record that still stands\n\nJason Frakes: 502-582-4046; jfrakes@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @kyhighs.
