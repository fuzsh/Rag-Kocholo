        "text": "The community of Wayland held a public hearing on August 3 at the Wayland Community Center to discuss Abandoned Mine Lands issues. Wayland residents have dealt with water running and standing under their homes since 1999. This water has caused significant damage to houses and has also caused the community to have various health issues relating to mold and mildew. The Abandoned Mine Lands division conducted research in 2005 and admitted that their division needed to fix this problem. Despite the promises of the AML nothing ever happened and the residents are still plagued with the problems.\n\nThe community began organizing around the issue about 4 months ago and on August 3 they had a public hearing that included guests from sKentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo's office, Congressman Hal Rogers office and Senator Johnny Ray Turner, as well as local officials Floyd County Judge-Executive Doc Marshall, Magistrate Jackie Owens and others.\n\nThe community gave statements about how the water had affects their quality of life in Wayland and how that they are tired of being put on the back burner with AML. The representatives listened with open ears, making the community promises that they would do everything in their power to try to help get the problem solved.\n\nWayland police officer Johnny Lane gave a statement about how the citizens safety is at risk by the water that pours onto the streets and freezes in the winter time to a solid sheet of ice. \" It has the potential to destroy many homes and leave several families homeless if it burst,â€ said Officer Layne. KFTC member Susie Mills facilitated the meeting and read a personal statement about how the water had affected her life and the health of her family. She explained to the panel what it was like rushing her daughter to the emergency room and having to constantly give her shots and breathing treatments. Susie also read a statement from her daughter's physician that cited the water under her home as a constant source that harbors bacteria and molds.\n\nSusie and other members of the Wayland community have worked day in and day out getting petitions signed and making packets for the guests to take with them after the hearing. The packets included pictures , petitions and various statements from community members. Susie and other members of the community were glad to see that folks from other KFTC chapters in the area came to support the community on such an important day. Truman Hurt, Mckinley Sumner and Russell Oliver were there from Perry County asking questions to the panel as well. \" I was asked to come and support folks in this community, I ask that you take action and get started today or tomorrowâ€ said Russell Oliver, urging the panel to help the community of Wayland.\n\nIt was a great day for the community however it is just one of many days to come in working for the justice that they so rightfully deserve. The community is hopeful that the politicians will keep their promises and they are excited to see what will happen in the coming weeks."
