        "text": "Kentucky Frontier Gas is a new utility assembled from several older, more familiar Eastern Kentucky gas companies. Under Kentucky rules, every gas pipeline must offer gas service to any residence within .5 mile. This rule resulted in a lot of folks getting gas service from many different pipelines and small utility networks.\n\nEach gas utility has to follow pipeline safety rules from US DOT and the financial and tariff rules of the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Each utility has a billing and accounting system, managers and office staff, field workers, a 24-hour emergency response center, and written standards of service.\n\nThis isn’t an easy undertaking for smaller companies with 20 or 200 customers; Frontier has now merged into one entity with ten other utility companies:\n\nAuxier Road Gas serves the communities of Auxier, Cliff, and the northern outskirts of Prestonsburg.\n\nBelfry Gas serves the communities of Belfry, Forest Hills, Goody, Hardy, Huddy, Jerry Bottom, Leckieville, Murphys Bottom, and Price.\n\nBlaine Gas is a former municipal gas system that serves homes, businesses, and the school around Blaine in Lawrence County.\n\nBTU Gas serves customers on the west side of Salyersville, Elk Creek, Lickburg, Wheelersburg, Flat Fork, Jellicoe, Mine Fork, Maggard, Coon Creek, Buffalo Creek, Lakeville, Sublett, Royalton, Oakley, Swampton, and Half Mountain.\n\nBTU Gas\n\nCow Creek Gas serves rural customers east of Prestonsburg on Cow Creek and around Endicott.\n\nCow Creek also serves former customers of Salyersville Gas and Sigma Gas in the communities of Salyersville, Mashfork, Falcon, Oil Springs, Royalton, Marshallville, Ivyton, Burning Fork, and along Abbott Creek.\n\nDema Gas serves the community of Dema.\n\nFloyd County Gas or East Kentucky Utilities serves the communities of Allen, Dwale, Estill, Garrett, Hueysville, Lackey, Middle Creek, Minnie, and Wayland.\n\nMike Little Gas serves the communities of Bevinsville, Bypro, Melvin, Weeksbury, Langley, and Goble Roberts.\n\nPeoples Gas was once part of Mike Little Gas and serves the Phelps community.\n\nPublic Gas serves the communities in and around Jackson, Campton, Hazel Green, and other communities near the Mountain Parkway.\n\nQuality Natural Gas and Alert Oil & Gas and KLC and Interstate Gas had farm tap customers in Floyd, Johnson, Knott, Lawrence, Lee, Leslie, Letcher, Magoffin, Martin, Morgan, Perry, and Pike counties.\n\nWe’re here to stay, we’re here to grow in Eastern Kentucky."
