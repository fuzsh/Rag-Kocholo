        "text": "Wayland High School was the home of the Wasps and in operation from 1941 until the spring of 1972. The school was then closed and the last graduating class left and the high school was merged with Garrett, Martin and Maytown High School to form Allen Central High School, a school that is now faced with school consolidation with neighboring South Floyd High School. I’ll have More on those schools later on.\n\nAfter Wayland High School was closed, this building served as Wayland Grade School from 1973 until 1990 when the building was closed for good.\n\nThis school once had an additional building on that sat where the store thats been built in front of the original building is now. That additional building must have housed the elementary school and was apparently demolished in the 90s after the elementary school at Wayland closed. That building can be seen by clicking HERE.\n\nAn interesting piece of trivia about Wayland High School: This school was home to the first Kentucky Mr. Basketball, Kelly Coleman, all the way back in 1956.\n\nThe Wayland Gymnasium still sits in the parking lot of the main school building.\n\nInside the main school building is in rough shape and you can tell no upkeep has been performed in many years.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nMost of the windows are busted out,\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nthe doors are unsecure and the ceilings are beginning to give way.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"
