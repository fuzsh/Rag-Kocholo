        "text": "It’s been nearly two years since flood waters left a path of destruction across Eastern Kentucky, but the move to get families out of flood-prone areas was the cause of celebration Tuesday.\n\nThere are currently seven high ground communities under construction in Eastern Kentucky that will eventually be home to 560 houses.\n\nOne of those is in Wayland, Ky., where 11 homes are nearly finished, providing some residents the ability to remain in the town but live without the fear of flooding.\n\n“It’s just wonderful to have a place and you can call it your home,” Jackie Bradley said. “You can do with it what you want.”\n\nThe project is a breath of fresh air for local residents and officials, and something that could mean a lot for the future of the town.\n\n“Today is hope,” Wayland Mayor Jerry Fultz said. “I see 11 new houses. I see the opportunity for 11 families to stay in Wayland.”\n\nAppalachian Service Project of Tennessee is building the homes. Each house received $100,000 from the Team Eastern Kentucky Flood Relief Fund.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear was on hand Tuesday to celebrate the project.\n\n“What was a tragedy that first brought me here just days after the flood up at the gym trying to help people, families and kids – seeing the cleanup firsthand today, we are talking triumph,” he said.\n\nThe new homes are expected to be finished sometime this summer."
