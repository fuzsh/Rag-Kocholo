        "text": "Wayland is a suburban town with a bit of a rural New England feel. Many large lots, most people own their own homes, but the cost of housing is extremely high. If you want all the amenities at your fingertips or a walkable community, this is not for you. We are sorely lacking in good coffee shops. The restaurants are decent, but nothing exciting. You can drive to bigger centers with more amenities but plan on it taking you fifteen to twenty minutes at a minimum to get to your destination. To get into central Boston takes about half an hour when the traffic is good. If the traffic is bad it can take 1.5 hours. The schools are excellent, but playgrounds are limited, and there are no splash pads. Most families seem to drive into surrounding towns for things like kids programs. This area is growing in young families, but does not have a particularly youthful feel to it. Almost every household is double income, and so most kids attend daycare, preschool, or school."
