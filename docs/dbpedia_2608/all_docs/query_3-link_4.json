        "text": "Joe O’Donnell, who took some of the first disturbing pictures after the nuclear bombing of Japan and also captured lastingly famous scenes as a longtime White House photographer, died last Thursday in Nashville, where he made his home. He was 85.\n\nThe cause was complications of a stroke, said his wife, Kimiko Sakai. She said that he had had more than 50 operations, among them surgery on his colon and his heart, and that he had attributed his poor health to radiation exposure resulting from his visits to Nagasaki and Hiroshima.\n\nAs a presidential photographer, Mr. O’Donnell caught images of Harry S. Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur shaking hands at their meeting on Wake Island during the Korean War; Vice President Richard M. Nixon in his “kitchen debate” with the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev; and President John F. Kennedy deciding whether to go ahead with the Bay of Pigs invasion.\n\nBecause he was on the government payroll, Mr. O’Donnell got no personal credit for those photos, although he signed and sold copies of them after his retirement from the White House in 1968.\n\nMr. O’Donnell was a 23-year-old Marine sergeant when he was assigned to document the effects of bombing, and spent seven months photographing devastation in Japan. His first subject was Nagasaki, much of which had been destroyed by an atomic bomb on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after Hiroshima was similarly hit.\n\nThe photos proved striking. One was of a boy carrying his dead brother to a crematorium. Another showed a classroom of children sitting at their desks, all burned to cinders. In others, faces were ripped away.\n\nMr. O’Donnell also ventured to Hiroshima and to cities bombed with conventional weapons. He carried two cameras. With one, he took pictures for the military. With the other, he took pictures for himself. When he returned home after the war, he put the negatives of his own photos in a trunk and locked it, emotionally unable to look at them.\n\nWhen he finally could, nearly a half-century later, he was so repulsed that he threw himself into protesting nuclear arms. In 1995, he published in Japan a book of many of those photos, and, a decade later, another in the United States. He lectured and exhibited in both countries.\n\nMr. O’Donnell’s work was caught up in controversy in 1995, before the National Air and Space Museum exhibited the Enola Gay, the B-29 that had bombed Hiroshima. His images were supposed to demonstrate the bombs’ horrific effects, but veterans objected that the photos and the words others had written to accompany them gave an unbalanced view that neglected both Japan’s aggression and the bombs’ role in ending the war and saving American lives.\n\nThe photographs were stricken from curators’ plans, as were other features that offended veterans. In an interview that year with National Public Radio, Mr. O’Donnell contended that, given what he had seen immediately after the war, Japan could have been defeated with conventional arms, and without the hundreds of thousands of American casualties that an invasion of the Japanese home islands had been expected to entail.\n\nJoseph Roger O’Donnell was born on May 7, 1922, in Johnstown, Pa. After high school, he joined the Marines, who sent him to photography school. On Aug. 28, 1945, his unit became among the first to enter Japan. It was sent to a position about 10 miles from Nagasaki, he said in an article he wrote for American Heritage magazine in 2005.\n\nAccess to the bombed cities was limited, so Mr. O’Donnell walked to Nagasaki to take pictures that a superior had ordered. He noticed the putrid smell, then the absence of things: “no bird, no wind blowing, nothing to make you think there had once been a real city here.”\n\nOnce in Nagasaki, he bartered 20 packs of cigarettes for a horse he named Boy. He lived in an abandoned house with the horse, which he used to navigate the rubble, and gave chocolate to children who posed for him.\n\nMany years afterward, in the late 1980s, he attended a religious retreat in Kentucky where he saw a nun’s sculpture of a flame-scarred Christ on the cross, a work meant to evoke Hiroshima. He bought the statue, opened his long-locked trunk and began protesting.\n\nAfter the war, Mr. O’Donnell moved to Washington and briefly ran his own photography studio. He became White House photographer, his wife said, through family connections. In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Roger, of Florida; Richard, of West Virginia; and Tyge, of Las Vegas; and a daughter, Jennifer, of Nashville.\n\nOne of Mr. O’Donnell’s pleasures as White House photographer was the moments of intimacy that he got to share with presidents.\n\nIn the National Public Radio interview 12 years ago, he told of having summoned his courage to ask Truman, while walking on a Wake Island beach in 1950, if he had ever had second thoughts before the atomic-bombing of Japan.\n\n“Hell, yes!” he recalled Truman responding. “And I’ve had a lot of misgivings afterwards.”\n\nMr. O’Donnell was too shy to ask for clarification.\n\n“I don’t know what he meant,” he said.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nSept. 5, 2007\n\n:\n\nTwo pictures on Aug. 14 with an obituary about the news photographer Joe O’Donnell carried erroneous credits, and the obituary also included one of the incorrect credits. The photograph of a saluting John F. Kennedy Jr. during the funeral for his father in 1963 was taken by Stan Stearns for United Press International, not by Mr. O’Donnell. The photographer who took the second picture, showing Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill during a wartime meeting in Tehran in 1943, is not known, although Mr. O’Donnell claimed credit for it and the Kennedy picture. Mr. O’Donnell is not known to have been in Tehran at the time.\n\nA Nashville gallery that handled Mr. O’Donnell’s work supplied the incorrect information. The Times is researching other claims by Mr. O’Donnell reported in the obituary.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nSept. 15, 2007\n\n:\n\nAn obituary on Aug. 14 about the photographer Joe O’Donnell, who learned the craft with the Marine Corps during World War II, described well-known pictures of four presidents that he claimed to have taken. A correction in this space on Sept. 5 described two erroneous credits to him on photographs which ran with the obituary — one, also mentioned in the obituary, of John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his father’s funeral caisson in 1963, which was actually taken by Stan Stearns for United Press International; and one of Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill meeting in Tehran in 1943, by an unknown photographer.\n\nIn addition, the obituary also erroneously attributed a photograph of Vice President Richard M. Nixon during his “kitchen debate” in Moscow with Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1959; it was taken by Elliott Erwitt, not by Mr. O’Donnell.\n\nAn article describing how Mr. O’Donnell came to make these and other erroneous claims appears today on Page A1."
