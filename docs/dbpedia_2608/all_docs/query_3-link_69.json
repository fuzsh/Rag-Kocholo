Just as the title says, this compilation includes a rich assortment of studio rarities (many previously unreleased, those not covered before in bold text), including alternate versions, remixes, outtakes and numerous bits and pieces released or made between albums for various artists soundtracks and compilations, several of them covers (that in itself intriguing, given that The Cure only recorded one cover on their regular studio albums, and on their very first), and some more solo Smith than Cure. With four CDs totalling almost five hours, unlike arguably even the Standing on a Beach cassette, this isn't intended as something to be listened to in its entirety; whereas Standing on a Beach is the audio equivalent of a delicious and exotic three course meal at someone else's home, Join the Dots is more akin to a vast buffet served on a special occasion for a big gathering, from which you can pick any song, group of songs, era, or disc you so desire, and likely equally come away more than satisfied, despite a few questionable choices starting as early as Disc Two. And while somewhat expensive today in new condition on both amazon.co.uk and amazon.com, it's worth every penny/cent, despite its inevitable unevenness later on.\n\nMoving back to happier times for The Cure in 1987 (as every other song in previous years has been discussed), we start with what was the last song on the bonus disc of the limited UK orange vinyl edition of Kiss Me, which included all the five B-sides of Why Can't I Be You, Catch and Just Like Heaven. As the name suggests it's a remix rather than a remake or alternate take, so there's little actual new material; the string hook in the outro, only vaguely hinted at before by the saxophone in the long intro is given more prominence, and there's a stronger bass line with more interesting saxophone playing, but on the minus side the ice cream van coda is missing. All in all, it's a pretty superfluous addition as an only slightly different version of what, while good, wasn't among the highlights on Kiss Me to begin with, and like its album counterpart, feels more like a demo than a fully fleshed out song. As for this version of How Beautiful You Are, well what can you possibly do with the best song on Kiss Me, and one of the top ten of the Cure's career? This feels more like a rougher, less fully realized earlier take than a remix, and while still very nice, again adds little to this collection. Once again, the fact that these were included alongside remixes ranging from uninspired to just plain awful, like Hey You!!!, Just Like Heaven and This is a Lie, to name but a few, at the expense of the Primary Red Mix, the Milk Mix of Let's Go to Bed and the Feels Good Mix of The 13th is simply baffling.\n\nBut this six-minute radical reinterpretation of Hello, I Love You is something special altogether, and quite unlike the far more routine version that appeared on the first disc of Rubáiyát (probably due to the limitations of the CD, with the playing time totalling just over 74 minutes) is The Cure's finest cover. Like their rendition of Purple Haze, this has little in common with the original apart from the lyrics and in part the melody, and much for the better; this is a Doors song totally recast to sound as if The Cure had written it, and you can easily tell it's the same Cure who'd produced their magnum opus Disintegration the previous year. Like most of the tracks on that album, it has an epic breadth and reverberant production that far transcends the song's simple if catchy pop origins, being considerably slowed down, far more melancholy and spectral with much altered minor key harmonies, its hypnotic interplay of gently pounded tribal drums, eery alternately tuned guitars and symphonic sweep of synthesizers contributing to its moody and thoroughly mesmerizing atmosphere, with Smith even adding a bit of anger in the line \"Do you hope to make her see, you fool?\". The funky guest trumpet solo near the end is an inspired touch indeed. More so than Young Americans, this is a pretty unlikely song for The Cure to cover and make it their own, but they do it amazingly well.\n\nThe Cure\n\nReleased 29 June 2004\n\nRecorded 2003-04 at Olympic Studios, London\n\nLength: 59:19\n\nLabel: Geffen\n\nProducers: Ross Robinson, Robert Smith\n\nLyrics by Robert Smith, all music by The Cure (Smith/Gallup/Bamonte/Cooper/O'Donnell)\n\n1.

Well, quite apart from the audacity of even implying that this disgraceful offering comes anywhere near close in quality to an album, that for all its flaws, still had that classic Cure sound and abundant imagination, to suggest that this is remotely close to sounding like The Cure as we previously knew and loved them is giving it a disproportionate amount of credit (however unintentionally so). For this is not The Cure as we thought we knew them, Xerox of or otherwise; this is The Cure sounding like all their members (sans Smith) had been kidnapped during the time of the recording sessions, putting in their place four members randomly selected from the numerous nu-metal and post-grunge bands of dubious quality whose music Ross Robinson had produced over his decade-long career. Four whole years in the waiting, after The Cure's finest release for over a decade, and they come up with THIS?! And we thought the decline from Wish to Wild Mood Swings was drastic...\n\nFor The Cure's first self-titled release as their first album for American record label Geffen after Fiction had been taken over by Universal, with the title supposedly symbolizing a new beginning (but for entirely the wrong reasons as it turned out), Smith made the somewhat controversial decision to hire one of Geffen's regular producers, who he'd met during a music festival in Switzerland and happened to be a lifelong fan of The Cure - a decision that for many (and not undeservedly so) confirmed that Smith and co had well and truly lost the plot. In employing the services of a producer whose artistically not so creditable (if lucrative) career had yielded arguably only one great album, At the Drive-In's Relationship of Command, and a slew of mediocre to downright awful releases, including some from some of the most despised commercially successful acts among more discerning music fans (Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Vanilla Ice), this must have been the final nail in the coffin for The Cure as a band still capable of producing great or even good music and one act of betrayal too many for much of their long-term loyal and suffering fanbase. And it's clear that such a choice to co-produce their next album didn't find too much favour with the rest of the band, if Gallup's somewhat pointed criticisms about the man and his recording methods are anything to go by: \"I personally don't like Ross. I find him trite...I've met enough genuine people and honest people, and I personally don't think Ross was one of them. I thought he tried to do things so everybody thought he was eccentric where true eccentrics don't try to create a persona around them. He would just do, to my mind, things that were unnecessary. He'd say, 'Oh, I'm trying to get a sound like, so it sounds like...' for example, he would pick up my bass, and I'd say, 'Hey, what are you doing?' and he'd say, 'I'm just trying to get the sound so it sounds like your bass,' and I said, 'Well, I know how to get that sound.' There's more convoluted ways of doing it than trying to create a sound, why not just ask the person who's playing it?\" It's clear that all was not well behind the scenes, and the results reflect this unhappy working atmosphere, ranging from uninspired at best to at worst just plain horrible, with the exception of some rare brighter moments.\n\nSo, on to the music itself, what's exactly wrong with this album? Well, quite apart from the simple fact that it contains only one track (that, alas, is one of the shortest) that comes close to sounding like vintage Cure both in sound and emotional impact, it has to be the worst recorded and most ugly sounding studio album of The Cure's history by some considerable distance. Most of the tracks seem to have been recorded purely for the intention of sounding \"LOUD\", with very little dynamic shading or range, and a complete dearth of subtlety - despite Smith (or likely Robinson) publicizing it as something to \"turn down the lights & turn up the sounds for your optimum listening pleasure\", it's certainly not something you can crank up to get the full measure of a rich and deeply enveloping sonic experience a la Disintegration; more like something to turn down so as not to give yourself a headache (that's if you can even be bothered to listen to it for its full and largely painful hour-long duration). That could be partially (if not entirely) forgiven if the musical material came up to scratch (as it does in Sleater-Kinney's The Woods, an album that's come up for a fair amount of criticism for its excessive loudness) but it doesn't. The songs for the most part are dull, uninspired, melodically commonplace and generic with a capital G, reeking of that undesirable stadium rock atmosphere that The Cure had largely avoided (and supposedly was anathematic to Smith, at least up until the end of the 1980s). The live-in-the-studio process merely succeeds in producing an album that is raw and under-produced but not in the least bit in an emotionally compelling and honest manner, but just ugly and charmless; a Cure stripped of all its sonic and emotional layers is a sad thing to behold indeed. And with a keyboard player being listed in the credits, The Cure are just a few songs short of being prosecuted under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968; there's barely, if any keyboards to be heard in most of the songs, and when they do appear, O'Donnell's contribution is mostly minimal, buried deep in the din, or both. Smith's vocals show a marked decline from any previous album, even Wild Mood Swings included, sounding mostly flat, raucous and frequently going out of tune, utterly devoid of the charm, subtlety and resonance of The Cure of old and without the redeeming musical qualities of previous songs that were intended to convey a spirit of bitterness and emotional numbness (like The Top or It Used to Be Me) to compensate. Finally, the lyrics, in keeping with the quality of the music, are largely banal, repetitive and lazily written, being more of the tired love-induced angst recycled from earlier and better stuff - you can change the label and producer, but you can't change the record where The Cure and Robert Smith is concerned it seems.\n\nAnd the album announces its badness in crushing fashion with the horrendous Lost, by far the worst opener on any Cure album (to the extent it makes the Concert version of Shake Dog Shake sound positively like Fascination Street in comparison) and probably the worst song the Cure had recorded up to this point (although there's pretty close competition with The Promise on the same album). All of the album's worst points are concentrated in this four minute debacle; the loud and ugly production, the headache-inducing and mechanically pounded guitar riff, total absence of keyboards, the tuneless vocals, with Smith sounding like an unfunny Stephen Malkmus parody, rising in an increasingly intolerable crescendo to the extent that you wish, like in The Promise he would just STFU (and when you feel such a thing about a Cure song, you know you've got problems). And the next three songs warrant little description, being built on more or less the same dubious principles but with slightly decreasing degrees of badness, though with some semblance of melody and warmth and a smidgeon of harmonic interest creeping in. The fact that The End of the World is one of the more popular and acclaimed songs (at #25 being one of two top 40 UK singles, the other one being the scarcely better Taking Off at #39) is only further proof of how low The Cure had sunk - yes at least it's recognisably melodic and more memorable than the previous three with The Cure bothering to include a singalong bridge, but it's still standard radio-friendly arena rock fodder that any third-rate alt rock band at the time could have written.\n\nBut now with the middle four songs, we get to the strongest (or the least unsatisfactory, if we're inclined to be particularly uncharitable) part of the album. Anniversary, the second best on the album (but sadly also one of the least known if the absence of a YouTube video is anything to go by), at least has some of the old Cure magic, with its sound and mood harking back to the more introspective numbers of the Wish era, conjuring a spooky and psychedelic atmosphere through a hypnotic repeated keyboard riff, ethereal long synthesizer lines, gentle harmonic dissonances and softly intoned and mysterious vocals to provide some much needed tranquil respite. Us and Them is The Cure's first angry political diatribe and it's quite fun in a way, even if one can't help wonder whether it was simply the latest from a long succession of anti-George Bush bandwagon jumping from British writers and musicians alike during a period when the 43rd US president's reputation was at an all time low (George Michael having produced the similarly themed single Shoot the Dog not long before) rather than sincerely meant. But at least Smith and the rest of the band sound convincingly energetic for once rather than merely tiresome, with again The Cure sounding more like their old selves with the ringing flanged 6-string bass and driving bass line providing sufficient impetus, and there's a certain perverse enjoyment to be enjoyed from hearing Smith's empathic enunciations of the F-word, even if the song is clearly in the line of better similarly ranting numbers like Give Me It, not to mention The Kiss.\n\nalt.end is another song that falls in the category of \"above average for this album, OK at best by any other standards\" - it at least has more heart and warmth than The End of the World through adding soaring strings in the chorus, but it's still essentially another anthemic and clichéd crowd-pleaser. I Don't Know What's Going On has some potential with some of Smith's best and most expressive vocals which show during the \"To me at all\" that he hasn't lost his range, and could have been something special with a little more care and development (at 2:58 it's sadly the shortest), or at least if it were still the 1980s it could. Taking Off shows a welcome return to the interacting keyboard and guitar layers of the old Cure, with an attractive floating piano line, but similar to alt.end is let down by yet another commonplace and repetitive melody in the \"Tonight\" chorus - yep, we're back in the arena again. But then there's far worse to come, with the album returning to the ugliness of the start, reaching its second nadir in the monstrosity that is The Promise, lacking just about everything that made Watching me Fall so good. Before that, we have Never, which while not as offensively bad as Lost or its successor, is still very dull and unmemorable, except for Smith's once again overwrought vocals (another case where he doth protest too much) and faux-dramatic climaxes, lacking anything distinguished in the way of a good melody, interesting riffs, chord changes or attractive production. And as for The Promise - goodness gracious, talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas, this takes padding to a whole new inglorious level, the biggest waste of ten minutes to be found listening to any of The Cure's music. It's Cut Pt III, the longest and by far the worst of the trilogy and that's about all the description it deserves beyond all that's been hinted above about its atrocities - having already wasted ten valuable minutes of my life I'll never get back at least once, why should this piece of crap warrant any more of my attention? Finally, if you can be bothered to make it that far, the best is left till last with the touching and melancholy Going Nowhere, with its beautiful interplay between expressive flanged bass and its lovely slightly jazzy piano part and Smith sounding like for once his heart's in it, without mistaking loudness for genuine emotional anguish. But it just ends too abruptly, as if Smith seemed embarrassed at having entered a rare spell of inspiration and didn't quite know what to do about it - what a waste.\n\nSo, the Cure's notoriously mixed quality post-Disintegration continues, but needless to say reaching a whole new low here. Naturally Cure ultra-fanatics will want to snap this up if they haven't already, purely for completionist purposes; for anyone else, avoid. A generous 2/5\n\nAnd now the B-sides - mercifully just four of them this time, and no remixes:\n\n1. The End of the World – 3:34\n\n2. This Morning – 7:16\n\n3. Fake – 4:43\n\nThe low quality of The Cure is scarcely addressed in This Morning, another tediously overlong song that drones on and on without much point or the kind of empathy that previous Cure songs in this vein (musically and lyrically) would have offered. In fairness, there's nothing offensively bad about it (although it threatens to be the case at the start with Smith and the band sounding as dull and flat as anywhere on the album), and the strings in the \"Nothing left to feel\" are quite pleasant, but it's just a pale hybrid of Cold and The Top without having the fresh and strong musical ideas of either. The Charlotte Sometimes-esque Fake (inexplicably only on the vinyl and Japanese CD editions) is much more like it though, with an attractive combination of resonant and melodic flanged bass and sweeping synth strings, anchored by a dancing bass that keeps things dynamic and engaging - though not breaking any new ground, at least it sounds like the real deal as a rare reminder of how good The Cure sound when they use keyboards as we know they can, with well-timed and poignant chord changes, especially during the final verse.\n\n1. Taking Off – 3:20\n\n2. Why Can't I Be Me – 4:16\n\n3. Your God is Fear – 5:08\n\nWhy Can't I Be Me, as the title suggests a sequel to the almost identically named song from Kiss Me (ending with the same \"Simply elegant\") is otherwise a polar opposite in mood, and it's also one of the better songs of this era. Its conveys the desperation quite convincingly of the protagonist who just wants to be his self, and not someone else to please his girlfriend all the time, through Smith's often despairing vocals, especially in the more strangulated chorus, which adds an anguished wah-wah guitar improvisation, a pretty novel idea for The Cure. It's unusually bass heavy for them, but in a way that gives its emotional drive and in an inspired and melodic manner, not in the ugly fashion of much of the self-titled. There are no keyboards on it, but the guitars are arranged and used far more attractively than on any of the non-keyboards songs on The Cure, to the extent that they almost sound like keyboards in places.\n\nYour God is Fear is better still, and is actually the best song of 2004 - it should have replaced Going Nowhere as the closer. Expressing Smith's well-known atheistic beliefs, it has a similar kind of slow tempo, melancholy feel and steady emotional build-up to Bloodflowers, with Smith turning up the heat during the second half with convincing passion, showing none of the decline in vocal power that so much of The Cure suggests. It has easily the most beautiful set of guitar textures to be found anywhere in 2004, combining electric guitar and a ringing circular chorused flanged bass riff, with the booming bass drum depicting the omnipotence of God, adding a gorgeous synthesizer layer in the final minute. Sadly, good though it is, unlike with Wild Mood Swings, there just enough aren't enough quality songs from 2004 to make an album that's more than just acceptable (if that). On to another leap year of The Cure's career, and hope for better things...\n\nNext up: 4:13 Dream (2008)"
