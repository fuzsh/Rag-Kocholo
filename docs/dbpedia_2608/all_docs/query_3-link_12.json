The Cure performs in the music video \"Fascination Street\" from the album \"Disintegration\" recorded for Elektra Records. The band plays in soft light on a darkened stage. Robert Smith sings as clips of the band playing their instruments fade into and superimpose onto the video.",

        "text": "A powerful song from the spectacular \"Disintegration\", the video for \"Fascination Street\" moves in mysterious dark ways, like many of the produced videos to promote the album. A routine performance from the group with a dominating static, reduced camera movements and Robert Smith is featured prominintely in close-up shots, singing the song. Controled used of lights in the small set that makes us imagine the song title as there are signs and a phone booth in the background. Nothing wrong about it, except that we don't have some artistic presentation or something that sticks in your mind like many previous Cure clips. But that bassline kills me everytime. 7/10."
