        "text": "Schneider was born in Pankow, East Berlin, East Germany. He has one sister, who is two years younger than him. Schneider left high school at age 16 and went to work as a telecommunications assistant. In 1984, he served his national service with the East German Army; He is the only one who has served in the army out of all the Rammstein members Schneider's parents wanted him to learn an instrument, so they sent him to a special school connected to a pioneering Socialist orchestra, where he was offered the choice between trumpet, clarinet and trombone, out of which he chose the first because it was the easiest to play. He describes himself as very talented at playing the trumpet, and after a year He got into the orchestra and played concerts. It was here he became interested in playing the drums: he was impressed by the equipment and kept looking over his shoulder at the drum set while playing. He told his parents he wanted to learn to play the drums, but they weren't supportive of the idea because \"they were both from the classical world\". He would go home and practice with sticks and built his own drum set with tin cans and buckets. He bought his first drum kit at age 14, after which is parents had to accept it and let him rehearse and take lessons.\n\nSchneider values his privacy, so little is known about his private life. He is married to Regina Gizatulina from Russia. The nickname \"Doom\" comes from the video game of the same name. Schneider needed a name for the German copyright agency, but found there were too many Christoph Schneiders already. Paul Landers suggested the name \"Doom\" because they liked the game. Schneider has said that if he knew that name would be on every record he played on he would have chosen a different one\n\nTuomas Holopainen was born in Kitee, Finland and is the youngest in his family. His musicality and skill in text expression showed early in school, especially when he took piano lessons at age seven and studied jazz and classical music styles for over 10 years at a music college. Holopainen joined his first bands in 1993. He played in several bands, including recording keyboards for three albums with black metal band Darkwoods My Betrothed and playing with Dismal Silence, Nattvindens Gråt and Sethian. In July 1996, Holopainen began thinking of starting a band of his own, for which he would write the music and play keyboards. This was the birth of Nightwish, around a camp fire. He asked Emppu Vuorinen (guitar) and classmate Tarja Turunen (vocals) to join what was then an acoustic project. After hearing Turunen's strong voice, and because of the metal influences of Vuorinen and drummer Jukka Nevalainen, Tuomas decided to turn Nightwish into a metal act. He and Nightwish didn't break through until they released their second album, Oceanborn. During the Century Child era, Holopainen decided to make music changes and added orchestral music to his work, from Century Child, Once and Dark Passion Play. Once became the ultimate breakthrough in the USA. In 2005, the lead singer, Tarja Turunen was fired after the last concert at the Hartwell Arena in Finland by a letter written by Tuomas and signed by the band. In 2006, Holopainen went through a dark period filled with anxiety and depression, made worse by rumors about himself and Nightwish in the tabloids every day. These events also inspired him in the writing of Dark Passion Play, Nightwish's latest album, which may be considered their darkest album yet. In 2007, the new vocalist, Anette Olzon was announced. In the late August in 2007, Dark Passion Play was released, which makes Nightwish's most successful album yet.\n\nMarilyn Manson was born Brian Hugh Warner on January 5, 1969 in Canton, Ohio, to Barbara Jo (Wyer) and Hugh Angus Warner. He has German and English ancestry. During his childhood, one of his neighbors molested him several times until the young Brian broke down one day and told his mother what happened. As an only child, he would often get into mischievous activities such as adventure through his grandfather Jack Warner's sex toys, shoot his BB gun with his cousin Chad, and create sex magazines to sell to his classmates. His parents raised him as an Episcopalian, and he attended the religious private Heritage Christian School. It was there that he became fueled with hate towards Christanity. During his tenth grade year, he convinced his parents to let him attend a public school.\n\nAfter he graduated from high school, he and his parents moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida because his father got a better job there. He studied journalism and theater at the local community college called Broward, and being some place new and feeling lonely, he wrote poems and short stories. After being fired from his last job at a record store, he became entertainment journalist for a local magazine. He interviewed several famous musicians including Trent Reznor from the band \"Nine Inch Nails\". Along with his job and writing, he would also frequently go to rock clubs. He soon decided to create his own band.\n\nWith musical influences from Ozzy Osbourne and KISS, he recruited other musicians with the same interests and started the band called \"Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids\". He got the name Marilyn Manson as a combination from the names of the movie star Marilyn Monroe and the psycho killer Charles Manson. The band's name would later officially change to just Marilyn Manson, and most of the original band members would leave and be replaced, too. Manson reunited with Trent Reznor and had his band tour with \"Nine Inch Nails\". Reznor would also produce Marilyn Manson's first three albums (Portrait of an American Family, AntiChrist Superstar, and Mechanical Animals) and an E.P. (Smells like Children). \"Mechanical Animals\" is Marilyn Manson's most successful album to date.

His scores for \"Dead Silence\", \"Death Sentence\", \"The Stepfather\", \"Resident Evil:Extinction\", \"The Collection\" and other films expanded upon these ideas and produced dozens of memorable themes, terrifying ambiences, and tension-filled rhythmic climaxes.\n\nWith over two hundred hours of television underscore to his credit, Charlie's scores to the CBS series \"Numb3rs\" and the NBC series \"Las Vegas\" spanned a wide range of styles, from ticking-clock hostage dramas and high-energy car chases to comedic casino capers and delicate heartbreak.

Aside from \"Slumdog Millionaire\", he also scored the music for Hollywood productions, \"Elizabeth - The Golden Age\", \"Couples Retreat\", \"127 Hours\", \"People Like Us\", \"Warriors of Heaven & Earth\", \"The 100 Foot Journey\", \"Million Dollar Arm\" and \"Pele\".\n\nRahman has been conferred with honorary doctorates from the Trinity College of Music, Aligarh Muslim University, Anna University, Middlesex University and Berklee College of Music. In 2009, he was featured in Time Magazine's \"Time100: The Most Influential People.\"\n\nIn 2011, Rahman joined a super band, SuperHeavy, comprised of Mick Jagger, Joss Stone, Damian Marley and Dave Stewart. Rahman has collaborated with several other international artists including Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Michael Jackson, Michael Bolton, MIA, Vanessa Mae, the Pussycat Dolls, Sarah Brightman, Dido, Hossam Ramzy, Hans Zimmer and Akon.\n\nRahman remains one of the few mainstream artists whose works have been performed live by the likes of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, Babelsberg Film Orchestra and the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.\n\nRahman has expanded his focus to newer horizons including the establishment of the A. R. Rahman Foundation to help poor and underprivileged children. Rahman has also announced initiatives to establish a tradition in western classical music in India and has embarked on an ambitious venture to set up the KM Music Conservatory and the KM Music Symphony Orchestra based out of Chennai, India.\n\nUnlike many musicians who started to learn music while still in their childhood, Maurice Jarre was already late in his teens when he discovered music and decided to make a career in that field. Against his father's will, he enrolled at Conservatoire de Paris where he studied percussions, composition and harmonies. He also met and studied under Joseph Martenot, inventor of the Martenot Waves, an electronic keyboard that prefigured the modern synthesizer.\n\nAfter leaving the Conservatoire, Jarre played percussion and Martenot Waves for a while at Jean-Louis Barrault's theater. In 1950, another actor-director, Jean Vilar , asked Jarre to score his production of Kleist's 'The Princess of Homburg', the first score Jarre wrote. Shortly after, Vilar created the 'Théâtre National Populaire' and hired Jarre as permanent composer, an association that lasted 12 years.\n\nIn 1951, filmmaker Georges Franju asked him to write the music of his 23 minutes documentary Der Invalidendom (1952), Jarre's first composition for the movie screen. His first full-length feature, again directed by Georges Franju, was Mit dem Kopf gegen die Wände (1959) followed by Franju's best known film, Augen ohne Gesicht (1960).\n\nJarre's career took a spectacular turn in 1961 when producer Sam Spiegel asked him to work on David Lean's Lawrence von Arabien (1962). Initially, three composers were supposed to write the score, but for various reasons, Jarre ended up writing all the music himself and won his first Oscar. His second collaboration with David Lean on Doktor Schiwago (1965) earned him another Oscar and obtained a level of success rarely achieved by a film score. He collaborated with Lean again on Ryans Tochter (1970) and Reise nach Indien (1984) for which he received a third Academy Award. He was set to score Lean's next movie, 'Nostromo', but the director became ill and died before the film could ever get made.\n\nHe also worked for directors as diverse as William Wyler (Der Fänger (1965)); John Huston (three films); Franco Zeffirelli (Jesus von Nazareth (1977)); Volker Schlöndorff (Die Blechtrommel (1979) [The Tin Drum] and Die Fälschung (1981) [Circle of Deceit]); Peter Weir (four films); Michael Apted (Gorillas im Nebel (1988)) and Alfonso Arau (Dem Himmel so nah (1995)).\n\nMainly perceived as a symphonist and known for his prominent use of percussions, Jarre often integrated ethnic instruments in his orchestrations like cithara on 'Lawrence of Arabia' or fujara (an old Slovak flute) on 'The Tin Drum'. During the eighties, he incorporated synthetic sounds in his music, writing his first entirely electronic score for Ein Jahr in der Hölle (1982). His son Jean-Michel Jarre is a well-known popular musician.\n\nBorn in Milan in 1911 into a family of musicians, Nino Rota was first a student of Orefice and Pizzetti. Then, still a child, he moved to Rome where he completed his studies at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1929 with Alfredo Casella. In the meantime, he had become an 'enfant prodige', famous both as a composer and as an orchestra conductor. His first oratorio, \"L'infanzia di San Giovanni Battista,\" was performed in Milan and Paris as early as 1923 and his lyrical comedy, \"Il Principe Porcaro,\" was composed in 1926. From 1930 to 1932, Nino Rota lived in the USA. He won a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Philadelphia where he attended classes in composition taught by Rosario Scalero and classes in orchestra taught by Fritz Reiner. He returned to Italy and earned a degree in literature from the University of Milan. In 1937, he began a teaching career that led to the directorship of the Bari Conservatory, a title he held from 1950 until his death in 1979. After his \"childhood\" compositions, Nino Rota wrote the following operas: Ariodante (Parma 1942), Torquemada (1943), Il cappello di paglia di Firenze (Palermo 1955), I due timidi (RAI 1950, London 1953), La notte di un neurastenico (Premio Italia 1959, La Scala 1960), Lo scoiattolo in gamba (Venezia 1959), Aladino e la lampada magica (Naples 1968), La visita meravigliosa (Palermo 1970), Napoli milionaria (Spoleto Festival 1977). He also wrote the following ballets: La rappresentazione di Adamo ed Eva (Perugia 1957), La Strada (La Scala 1965), Aci e Galatea (Rome 1971), Le Molière imaginaire (Paris and Brussels 1976) and Amor di poeta (Brussels 1978) for Maurice Béjart. In addition, there are countless works for orchestra that have been performed since before World War II and are still performed by orchestras in every part of the world. His work in film dates back to the early forties. His filmography includes the names of virtually all of the noted directors of his time. First among these is Federico Fellini. He wrote all of the movie scores for Fellini's films from Der weiße Scheich (1952) in 1952 to Orchesterprobe (1978) in 1978. Other directors include Renato Castellani, Luchino Visconti, Franco Zeffirelli, Mario Monicelli, Francis Ford Coppola (Oscar for best original score for Der Pate 2 (1974)), King Vidor, René Clément, Edward Dmytryk, and 'Eduardo de Filippo'. He also composed the music for many theatre productions by Visconti, Zefirelli, and de Filippo. In February of 1995, the Nino Rota Foundation was established at Fondazione Cini of Venice, Italy. Cini specializes in the works of 20th century Italian composers and includes the estate of Casella.\n\nComposer and conductor Alexandre Desplat, Oscar winner and seven-time Academy Award nominated, for his prolific filmography and his collaborations with Stephen Frears, Terrence Malick, Ang Lee, Kathryn Bigelow, Jacques Audiard, Wes Anderson, Roman Polanski, George Clooney or Matteo Garrone is one of the most worthy heirs of the French masters of film music.\n\nBrought up in a cultural and musical mix thanks to his Greek mother and his French father who studied and got married in California, he grew up listening to French symphonists, Ravel or Debussy , world music and jazz.\n\nHe studied piano and trumpet before choosing the flute as the main instrument. As a free auditor in Claude Ballif's analysis class at the CNSM, he enriches his classical musical education by studying Brazilian and African music. He will record later with Carlinhos Brown or Ray Lema.\n\nPassionate about film music, it's as much his musical sensitivity as his intimate approach to cinematographic language that will allow his privileged relationship with filmmakers. Inspired by the scores of Maurice Jarre, Bernard Herrmann, Nino Rota or Georges Delerue, it is after hearing the score of John Williams for Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977) that he decides to compose exclusively for the big screen.\n\nDuring the recording of his first feature film he meets violinist Dominique Lemonnier. This is the beginning of an exceptional artistic exchange as she becomes her favorite soloist, artistic director and wife. With his strong sense of interpretation, his creative spirit and his singular violin playing, Solré inspired Alexandre's compositions, influencing his music in depth, initiating a new way of writing for the strings in the cinema.\n\nCollaborator of Jacques Audiard since his first film, he creates for his works strong and singular compositions and he won in 2005 for Der wilde Schlag meines Herzens (2005) the Silver Bear of the Berlinale, and his first Caesar. He works in France with Philippe de Broca and Francis Girod but Das Mädchen mit dem Perlenohrring (2003) of Peter Webber, his 50th score for the film, he gets a first Golden Globe nomination and BAFTA and began his rise in Hollywood. Leading American career and European collaborations and remaining faithful to his directors, he composes among others Syriana (2005)'s scores of Stephen Gaghan, Birth (2004) of Jonathan Glazer, Coco Chanel: Der Beginn einer Leidenschaft (2009) by Anne Fontaine, L'armée du crime (2009) by Robert Guédiguian, Largo Winch (2008) by Jérôme Salle, Der Feind in den eigenen Reihen - Intimate Enemies (2007) or Hostage - Entführt (2005) by Florent-Emilio Siri.\n\nPrizes and collaborations with the greatest directors follow one another. In 2007, he received his first Oscar nomination for Stephen Frears's Die Queen (2006) and won his first European Film Award. The same year, he won the Golden Globe, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, and the World Soundtrack Award for John Curran's score Der bunte Schleier (2006), performed by pianist Láng Lang. He composed in 2008 for Gefahr und Begierde (2007) by Ang Lee and Der seltsame Fall des Benjamin Button (2008) by David Fincher which will earn him a second Oscar nomination and a fourth Golden Globes and BAFTA nomination.\n\nWith his score for Der Ghostwriter (2010) by Roman Polanski, he won in 2010 a second César and a second European Film Award. The same year he wrote the music of New Moon - Biss zur Mittagsstunde (2009) by Chris Weitz, whose album was a platinum record, and Tom Hooper's The King's Speech - Die Rede des Königs (2010) for which he won the BAFTA, the Grammy Award, and was nominated for the fourth time at the Oscars and for the fifth time at the Golden Globes.\n\nIn 2010-2011 he wrote the music of Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 1 (2010) and Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 2 (2011) which became the third greatest success of all time. He composed in 2011 nine partitions, The Tree of Life (2011) of Terrence Malick, Der Gott des Gemetzels (2011) by Roman Polanski, Der fantastische Mr. Fox (2009) by George Clooney , which earned him another Oscar nomination, La fille du puisatier (2011) by Daniel Auteuil and The Ides of March - Tage des Verrats (2011) by George Clooney.\n\nIn 2012 he worked with Kathryn Bigelow for Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Matteo Garrone for Reality (2012), Gilles Bourdos for Renoir (2012), Jérôme Salle for Zulu - Blutiges Erbe (2013), George Clooney for Moonrise Kingdom (2012) and Jacques Audiard for Der Geschmack von Rost und Knochen (2012) for which he won a third Cesar. For his score of Argo (2012) of Ben Affleck, Oscar for Best Picture, it is named for the sixth time BAFTA, and for the fifth time at the Golden Globes and the Oscars.\n\nHe signed in 2013 the partition Monuments Men: Ungewöhnliche Helden (2014) from George Clooney, Venus im Pelz (2013) of Roman Polanski, and was appointed to the BAFTAs and the Oscars for Philomena: Eine Mutter sucht ihren Sohn (2013) of Stephen Frears.\n\nIn 2014 he composed the music Godzilla (2014) of Gareth Edwards, and receives exceptional fact, two Oscar nominations for The Imitation Game - Ein streng geheimes Leben (2014) of Morten Tyldum and Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by George Clooney, for which he won a BAFTA, Grammy and Oscar.\n\nMember of the jury of the Cannes Film Festival in 2012, he became in 2014 the first composer President of the jury of the Venice Film Festival.
