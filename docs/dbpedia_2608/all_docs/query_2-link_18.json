        "text": "Post by slowcure on\n\nAs mentioned on Roger O' Donnell Discography FB that page above is from the biography about The Mission UK 'At War With The Gods', a book by Mission fan Alex Daniele. I've bought it as well, it's an impressive work.\n\nThere's some more mentioning of The Cure in that book. The Mission supported The Cure on three weekend dates of the Prayer Tour (Heerenveen, Loreley and Konstanz on 6, 13 and 20 May). During the weeks they were recording 'Carved in Sand' in London. Mission member Craig Adams has good memories of this time.\n\n\"When we were doing 'Carved in Sand' we were going away at weekends and doing festivals with The Cure. I think we played quite a few, we'd finish recording on Friday night and then Saturday morning we'd go to the airport, play on Saturday night somewhere in Europe and then fly home on Sunday night to start recording again on Monday. I can't quite remember, I know we did a couple with The Cure but we did other ones as well; it was really good, the way it broke making the album up (...)\"\n\nAnd a bit further on that same page (72): \"With the onset of summer, after supporting The Cure in the Netherlands and Germany in May (concerts both Craig Adams and Simon Hinkler remember as among the best the band ever did) the settings of the recording work changed again (...)\"\n\nI saw them in Heerenveen, it was a great gig indeed:\n\nPost by Pipperoo on\n\nRoger in Russia\n\nren.tv/novosti/2015-12-16/zvezdy-teatrov-iz-raznyh-stran-priehali-v-moskvu-na-rozhdestvenskiy-koncert\n\ntranslated\n\nThe brightest stars of theaters from different countries came to Moscow on a Christmas concert. At one stage, and will be the world famous classic games, and immediately held several premieres. Special guest of the program - the legendary British musician band The Cure Roger O'Donnell. Write the music for the ballet \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" was inspired by his love for the dancer from Russia.\n\nGather in Moscow, the famous dancers from all over the world at the height of the ballet season, when the stars of the world stage graphics painted on the clock, even for Andris Liepa, a virtuoso on the organization of large-scale celebratory gala concert - a Christmas miracle.\n\nThe star of American Ballet Daniil Simkin brought to Russia to work together with the European choreographer Alexander Ekman. The artist embodied in dance own biography - the way the student to the top.\n\nDivide the audience with a standing ovation Prima Bolshoi, Mariinsky and Mikhailovsky theater artists come from Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands. Behind the scenes, the star joked to dance in such a structure - is like to be an athlete at the Olympics.\n\nOn Christmas traditions make generous gifts - money from the concert in the Kremlin, the artists will give to charity. They promised to transfer the funds collected orphanage in Yaroslavl region."
