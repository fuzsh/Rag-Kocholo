As in the pedigrees of the Hy-Many race, it has been thought advisable to place all the principal lines in one view, on a single sheet, that it might be afterwards referred to in the account which will be given of each line separately.\n\n1. Eochaidh Muighmheadhoin (pronounced Eochy Moyvane), King of Connaught, was proclaimed monarch of Ireland in the year 358, and, after a reign of eight years, died at Tara. He married Mongfinn, daughter of Fidach, of the royal family of Munster, and sister of Crimhthann Mor Mac Fidaigh, who succeeded Eochaidh as monarch of Ireland, according to the Four Masters, in the year 366.  (See Battle of Magh Rath, Additional Notes I.) By Mongfinn this monarch had four sons, namely, 1, Brian, the ancestor of the Hy-Briuin tribes, of whom the O'Conors of Connaught were the most distinguished; 2, Fiachra, the ancestor of the Hy-Fiachrach tribes, of whom the O'Dowds, O'Heynes, and O'Shaughnessys were, at least in later ages, by far the most distinguished families; 3, Fergus; and, 4, Oilioll, from whom Tir Oiliolla, now the barony of Tirerill, in the county of Sligo, received its name Queen Mongfinn, like the Empress Agrippina, actuated by motives of ambition, for the aggrandizement of her offspring, poisoned her brother, the monarch Crimthann, on Inis Dornglas, a small island in the river Moy, in the hope that her eldest son, Brian, might be immediately seated on the throne of Ireland; and in order the more effectually to deceive her brother as to the contents of the proffered cup, she drank of it herself first,\n\np.344\n\nand died of the poison soon after; her brother, on his way home to Munster, died at a place in the south of the present county of Clare, which, from that memorable event, received the appellation of Sliabh Oighidh an righ, or the mountain of the death of the king. It has been, however, remarked by ancient and modern Irish writers that this execrable act of Mongfinn had not the desired effect, for that neither her son Brian, nor any of her posterity, was ever monarch of Ireland, except Turlogh O'Conor and his son Roderic. According to all our ancient authorities King Eochaidh had a second wife, Carinna, who is said to have been of old Saxon descent, and who was the mother of the youngest, though by far the most celebrated, of his sons, namely, Niall of the Nine Hostages, the ancestor of O'Neill of Ulster, and all the other families of the Hy-Niall race. It is stated in the Book of Ballymote, fol. 145, b, a, that the poisoning of her brother Crimthann was of no avail to Queen Mongfinn, for that Niall of the Nine Hostages, the son of King Eochaidh by his second wife, and who had been the general of King Crimthann's forces, succeeded as monarch of Ireland immediately after the poisoning of Crimthann. This clearly shows either that Carinna was Eochaidh's first wife, or that he had the two together, for Mongfinn survived him thirteen years, and Niall of the Nine Hostages, the son, as we are told, of the second wife, was of age to succeed as monarch immediately after Mongfinn had poisoned her brother and herself. However this may have been, we read that in the life-time of Niall of the Nine Hostages, Brian, his brother of the half blood, became King of Connaught, and his second eldest brother of the half blood, Fiachra, the ancestor of the O'Dowds and of all the Hy-Fiachrach tribes, became chief of the district extending from Carn Fearadhaigh, near Limerick, to Magh Mucroimhe, near Athenry. But dissensions soon arose between Brian and his brother Fiachra, and the result was that a battle was fought between them, in which the latter was defeated, captured, and delivered as a hostage into the hands of his half brother, Niall of the Nine Hostages. After this, however, Dathi, the son of Fiachra, a very warlike youth, waged war on his uncle Brian, and challenged him to a pitched battle, at a place called Damh-chluain, situated not far from Knockmaa hill, near Tuam, in the now county of Galway. In this battle, in which Dathi was assisted by Crimthann, son of Enna Cennselach, King of Leinster, Brian and his forces were routed, and pursued from the field of battle to Tulcha Domhnaill, where he was overtaken and slain by Crimthann, son of Enna Cennselach.\n\nThe body of Brian was buried at the place where he fell, but after a long lapse of years St Beo Aedli, or Aidus vivax, of Roscam, near Galway, removed his bones from that place, and buried them at Roscam; and the writer of the tract on the battle of Damh-cluain, preserved in the Book of Ballymote, adds, the burial-place of Brian is to be seen there at this day.\n\np.345\n\n2. Fiachra Foltsnathach, i. e. of the flowing hair, son of King Eochaidh.  After the fall of Brian, the eldest son of King Eochaidh, as before recited, Fiachra, the second son, was set at liberty, and installed King of Connaught, and enjoyed that dignity for twelve years, during which period he was general of the forces of his brother Niall. His death happened in the following manner, according to the Lecan records:  He went on one occasion with the king's forces to raise tribute in Munster, but the inhabitants of that province, who detested him and his race, on account of the conduct of his mother in having poisoned the preceding monarch, who was of their own province and blood, refused to pay the tributes to King Niall, and defied him to battle. They met the king's forces in the territory of Caenraighe, now the barony of Kenry, situated in the county of Limerick, on the south side of the Shannon, where they were defeated, and obliged to give up hostages for their future allegiance. In this battle, however, Fiachra was severely wounded by Maighe Mescora, one of the warlike tribe of the Ernaans of Munster, and he set out in triumph for Tara; but when they had arrived in the territory of Hy-Mac Uais, in Meath, the Munster hostages found Brian unprotected and in a very feeble state from his wounds, and being suddenly actuated by motives of revenge, they seized upon his person and buried him alive in the earth! Thus fell Fiachra a victim to his own incautiousness, according to the Lecan records, which do not tell us a word about what his own chieftains were doing, when he was left thus barbarously unprotected. According to the Book of Lecan this Fiachra had five sons, and if we can rely upon the order in which they are mentioned we should feel inclined to think that the monarch Dathi was the youngest. They are mentioned in the following order:  1., Earc Culbhuidhe, i. e. of the yellow hair, so called because his hair was of the colour of pure gold, who was the ancestor of the men of Ceara; 2., Breasal, whose race became extinct; 3, Conaire, from whom a St Sechnall is said to have sprung; 4, Amhalgaidh, or Awley, King of Connaught (and ancestor of several ancient families in Tirawley and Erris, in the county of Mayo), who died in the year 449; for some account of whom the reader is referred back to pp. 513 of this volume. The seven sons of this Amhalgaidh, together with twelve thousand men, are said to have been baptized in one day by St Patrick, at Forrach Mac n-Amhalgaidh, near Killala  (See Jocelin's Life of St. Patrick, c. 59, and Colgan, Trias Thaum. p. 141, col. 2); and, 5, Dathi, the youngest, but most illustrious, of the sons of Fiachra, and the ancestor of all the chiefs of the Hy-Fiachrach race.\n\n3. Dathi, son of Fiachra Foltsnathach.  On the death of his father, Fiachra, this warlike chieftain became King of Connaught, and on the death of his uncle, Niall of the Nine Hostages, in the year 405 or 406, he became monarch of Ireland, leaving the government of Connaught to his less warlike brother Amhalgaidh, or Awley, who\n\np.346\n\nlived to receive the doctrines of Christianity from the lips of the Irish apostle, Patrick, and who is set down in all the lists of the kings of Connaught, as the first Christian king of that province. King Dathi, following the example of his predecessor, Niall, not only ventured to invade the coasts of Gaul, but forced his way to the very foot of the Alps, where he was killed, it is said, by a flash of lightning, leaving the throne of Ireland to be filled by a line of Christian kings. His body was carried home by his son Amhalgaidh, who took the command of the Irish forces after the death of his father, and by his four servants of trust, Dungal, Flanngus, Tuathal, and Tomaltach, who carried it to the royal cemetery at Cruachan, called Reilig na Riogh, where it was interred, and where, to this day, the spot is marked by a red pillar stone.  Vide supra, p. 24, note 97.\n\nAfter the death of King Dathi, Laoghaire, or Leary, the son of Niall of the Nine Hostages, became monarch of Ireland, and enjoyed that dignity, as the Book of Lecan states, for thirty years after the arrival of St. Patrick.\n\nThe monarch Dathi married three wives, but the Irish authorities differ much about their order; the fact therefore probably was that he had the three together; be this, however, as it may, the Book of Lecan states that he married Ruadh, or Rufina, the daughter of Airti Uichtleathan, by whom he had Oilioll Molt, monarch of Ireland, and Fiachra Ealgach, the ancestor of O'Dowd; he married, secondly, Fia, the daughter of Eochaidh, by whom he had Eochaidh Breac, the ancestor of O'Heyne and O'Shaughnessy; and, thirdly, Eithne, the daughter of Orach, or Conrach Cas, who, according to some authorities, was the mother of his son King Oilioll Molt. But as it would be now idle to speculate on which of Dathi's sons were youngest or eldest, the Editor will here follow the authority of the Book of Lecan, which states that Dathi had twenty-four sons, of whom, however, only twenty are given by name, and set down in the following order:  1, Oilioll Molt: he succeeded as king of Connaught in the year 449, and after the death of the monarch Laoghaire, in 463, became monarch of all Ireland, and reigned twenty years. His two grandsons, Eoghan Bel and Oilioll Inbanna, became Kings of Connaught, but his race became extinct in his great grandsons; 2, Fiachra Ealgach, the ancestor of O'Dowd, and several other families; 3, Eochaidh Breac, i. e. Eochy the Freckled, the ancestor of O'Heyne, O'Shaughnessy, and many other families; 4, Eochaidh Meann; 5, Fiachra, who is said to have been detained as a hostage in the hands of King Niall of the Nine Hostages, and who is said to have left a family called Hy-Fiachrach, at a place called Cuil Fabhair, in Meath; 6, Earc; 7, Corc; 8, Onbecc; 9, Beccon; 10, Mac Uais; 11, Aengus the Longhanded; 12, Cathal; 13, Faelchu, from whom are descended the tribe of Hy-Faelchon; 14, Dunghal; 15, Conrach; 16, Neara; 17, Amhalgaidh, the\n\np.347\n\nson of Rufina, the daughter of Airtigh Uichtleathan, who was born on Inis Awley, in Lough Conn (Lib. Lec. fol. 247), from whom descended the tribe called Cinel Becon, in Meath, and the Mac Firbises of Lecan; 18, Blachadh; 19, Cugamhna, from whom descended the family called Mac Congamhna, who were located in Cinel Fechin, in the south of the now county of Galway: and, 20, Aedh, the ancestor of the Hy-Aedha, who were seated in Burren, in Thomond.\n\nIf the sons of Dathi be here set down according to their ages it will follow that Fiachra Ealgach was his second son, and that upon the failure of issue in the line of Oilioll Molt, the representative of Dathi is to be sought for in the line of Fiachra Ealgach. O'Flaherty, however, though he had the Book of Lecan before him, says that Eochaidh Breac, the ancestor of the Hy-Fiachrach Aidhne, was the eldest son of Dathi, that Oilioll Molt, monarch of Ireland, was the second, and Fiachra Ealgach, the ancestor of the Hy-Fiachrach of the Moy, the third son. But, as already observed, it would be now idle to conjecture which is right, and the Editor has followed the Book of Lecan, which, as being the local authority, is more likely to be correct in the genealogy of this race than any other manuscript.\n\n4. Fiachra Ealgach, son of Dathi.  The Irish annals have preserved no memorial of this Fiachra, as the descendants of the monarch Oilioll Molt, the eldest son of Dathi, were dominant in Connaught in his reign, but the Lecan genealogical books inform us that he was detained as a hostage in the hands of the monarch Niall of the Nine Hostages,  which however is scarcely credible,  and that the territory of Tir Fiachrach Muaidhe, now the barony of Tireragh, on the east side of the river Moy, took its name from him. He had, according to these records, two sons, namely, 1, Amhalgaidh, or Awley, from whom descended several families formerly seated in the barony of Tirawley, among whom, according to some authorities, are to be reckoned the family of Mac Firbis, but this is very uncertain, as is every thing connected with the early history of that family. By this Amhalgaidh was erected the celebrated Carn Amhalgaidh, on which the chiefs of the northern Hy-Fiachrach were afterwards for ages inaugurated, concerning which see more in the article on the inauguration of the O'Dowds. Fiachra had, 2, Maoldubh, or Maolduin, the ancestor of the subsequent chiefs.\n\n5. Maoldubh, or Maolduin, son of Fiachra Ealgach.  No memorial of this personage is preserved in the authentic Irish annals, nor in the genealogical books of the Mac Firbises, except that he is said to have given name to a fort called Dun Maolduibh, near the River Easkey, where he was born and fostered.\n\n6. Tiobraide.  He was chief of Hy-Fiachrach in the time of St. Columbkille, to whom he granted a tract of land around the hill of Cnoc na Maili, now the Red Hill\n\np.348\n\nof Skreen, and on which the church of Skreen was afterwards erected by St Adamnan. He was the father of\n\n7. Donnchadh Muirsce, i. e. Donogh of Muirisc, a district in the territory of Tir Fiachrach of the Moy. He was King of Connaught for four years, and was slain, according to the Four Masters, in the battle of Corann, in the year 681. A. D. 681. Donnchadh Muirsce [son of Tiobraide], son of Maoldubh, King of Connaught, was slain in the battle of Corann, in which were also slain Colga, the son of Blathmac, and Fergus, the son of Maolduin, chief of the Cinel Cairbre.\n\nIn this entry the Four Masters state that Donnchadh Muirsce was the son of Maoldubh, but we know from the most ancient and authentic lists of the Kings of Connaught, that he was the grandson of Maolduin, and the son of Tiobraide. He had two sons, Innreachtach, King of Connaught for two years, who had a son Oilioll, King of Connaught for eight years, who had a son Cathal mac Oiliolla, who became chief of Hy-Fiachrach, and died in the year 812, but of whose race no further account is preserved. The second son of Donnchadh Muirsce was Oilioll, the ancestor of O'Dowd, through whom the line of chiefs was continued.\n\n8. Oilioll son of Donnchadh Muirsce.  No memorial of him is preserved in any of our records except the mere statement that he was the son of Donnchadh Muirsce, King of Connaught, and the brother of Innreachtach, King of Connaught, who was slain in the year 718.\n\n9. Cathal, son of Oilioll.  No account of him is found in history, except that he is mentioned as the grandson of a King of Connaught, and the father of another, namely, of\n\n10. Donncatha Mac Cathail.  In the authentic lists of the Kings of Connaught this Donncatha, who is called son of Cathal, son of Oilioll, son of Donnchadh Muirsce, is said to have governed Connaught for eighteen years; and his death is entered in the Annals of the Four Masters, at the year 768.\n\n11. Connmhach.  In the time of this Connmhach the government of the kingdom of Connaught was transferred to the race of Guaire Aidhne, who resided in the south of the province, and soon after wholly to the Hy-Briuin, of whom the O'Conors of Connaught were the principal family; so that Connmhach did not figure among the conspicuous characters of his age, and the Irish annalists have therefore preserved no notice of him. The genealogical books of the Mac Firbises, however, inform us that he was the ancestor of all the succeeding chiefs of the Northern Hy-Fiachrach race, whose country, before the Anglo-Norman invasion, extended from the River Robe to the River Cowney, at Drumcliff, and from the coasts of Erris, eastwards, to the boundary of O'Rourke's country. He had two sons, Caomhan, the ancestor of the\n\np.349\n\nO'Caomhan family, who sunk into obscurity in the fifteenth century, and Dubhda, or Dowda, the ancestor of the O'Dowd, or O'Dowda family.\n\nThe genealogical books of the Mac Firbises contain some amusing stories, purporting to give a reason why the race of Caomhan, the eldest son of Connmhach, was set aside and the race of Dubhda put in their place as chiefs of the Northern Hy-Fiachrach, but as these have been already given from the text of Duald Mac Firbis, it is only necessary to remark here that whatever truth there may be in the seniority of Caomhan, his race was considered in later times the senior branch of the descendants of the monarch Dathi, and therefore their chief enjoyed many privileges which no other family of the race were entitled to; such as to take the first place at the banquet, to be the chief man at the inauguration of the O'Dowd, and to give out their first arms, or military weapons, to the youth of Hy-Fiachrach. How they first lost the chieftainship of the Hy-Fiachrach it would be now useless to inquire, but it may be remarked that they are not the only senior branch of a great race in Ireland who have been laid aside by more powerful junior rivals, and we cannot now admit any reason for O'Dowd's superiority to them than that his tribe became more numerous and more warlike, and compelled them to surrender all claims to the chieftainship of the Northern Hy-Fiachrach by force of arms.\n\n12. Dubhda, the second son of Connmhach. He is the ancestor after whom the family of O'Dubhda, anglice O'Dowda, or O'Dowd, have taken their surname. The name Dubhda signifies a black complexioned or black-haired man, and the prefix O' denotes grandson, and, in a wider sense, a descendant in any degree, and is translated nepos by Adamnan in his Life of St. Columbkille; so that O'Dubhda signifies nepos Doudai, or descendant of Dubhda, or Dowda, and the O' should be prefixed, not only to the name of the chieftain of the race, but also to that of each individual of the family, as well in all the collateral branches as in the direct line. The exact period at which this Dubhda, or Dowda lived, cannot now be satisfactorily ascertained, as the Irish annals preserve no memorial of him, but we have two periods fixed by the authentic annalists, between which he must have flourished, namely, that of his grandfather Donncatha, King of Connaught, who died in 768, and that of his own grandson Aodh, King of North Connaught, who died in the year 983, and by striking a mean between these two dates we shall have the year 876, which may therefore be considered the year about which this Dowda died. The genealogical books of the Mac Firbises do not give us the name of his wife, and the sum of what they have handed down respecting him is, that he had one son, namely,\n\n13. Ceallach Mac Dubhda, of whom nothing is recorded, except that he was the father of\n\np.350\n\n14. Aodh, or Hugh O'Dubhda, or O'Dowda, King of Lower Connaught, who died in the year 983, according to the Annals of Lecan, as quoted by Duald Mac Firbis. This Aodh, or Hugh, was the first who could have added the prefix O' to his surname, as being the O', nepos, or grandson of Dubhda, for his father would have been called Mac Dubhda. He seems also to have been the first who obtained sway over the descendants of Caomhan, his grandfather's eldest brother; for the Lecan records inform us that he granted to Aodh, or Hugh, the grandson of Caomhan, the district extending from Tuaim Da Bhodhar to Gleoir, and also the tract of land in Carra, called Tuath Ruisen, which till then had been in the possession of a sept of the Firbolgs, besides other tracts in the principality of Hy-Fiachrach, in consideration of Aodh, the grandson of Caomhan, having resigned to him and his race all claims to the chieftainship of the Hy-Fiachrach. The genealogical books of the Mac Firbises give him but one son, Maolruanaidh, the ancestor of all the branches of the O'Dowd family; but we learn from the Annals of the Four Masters that he had another son, Gebhennach, who died in 1005.\n\n15. Maolruanaidh, or Mulrony, son of Aodh, or Hugh O'Dubhda.  According to Duald Mac Firbis this Mulrony, who was chief of Hy-Fiachrach Muirisce, died in the year 1005, and the Four Masters have the following notice of his death under the same year:  A. D. 1005. Maolruanaidh, son of Aodh O'Dubhda, lord of Hy-Fiachrach Muirisce, and his son Maolseachlainn, and his brother Gebhennach Mac Aodha, died.\n\nThis Maolruanaidh, or Mulrony, had, according to the Mac Firbises, two sons, namely, 1, Maoileachlainn, or Maolseachlainn, the ancestor of the greater number of the succeeding chieftains, and, 2, Domhnall, or Donnell, the ancestor of a celebrated sept of the O'Dowds, called the Clann Domhnaill, or Clandonnell of Lough Conn, of whom were many distinguished warriors, chiefs of Tirawley, and among others Cosnamhach Mor, anglice Cosney More, who, according to the Mac Firbises, was the last of the Irish race who was called the fighter of an hundred men, but who was killed in his own house at Inishcoe, on Lough Conn, by O'Gloinin, one of his own sub-chieftains, in 1162.\n\n16. Maoilseachlainn, i. e. Melaghlin, or Malachy O'Dubhda.  He died in 1005, the same year in which his father and uncle also died. The Mac Firbises mention but one of his sons, namely, Niall\n\n17. Niall, son of Maoilseachlainn O'Dubhda.  He had three sons; 1, Niall, ancestor of the Clann Neill O'Dowd, who made strong efforts to wrest their little territory from the family of O'Caomhain, but without success; 2, Taithleach, the ancestor of nearly all the subsequent chiefs, and 3, Aodh, the ancestor of several septs, but whose pedigrees are not carried down.\n\n18. Taithleach, son of Niall O'Dubhda.  He had two sons, namely, 1, Ruaidhri Mear,\n\np.351\n\nor Rory the Swift O'Dubhda, who was lord of the country extending from the river Robe to Drumcliff, and who was murdered by Domhnall, or Donnell O'Quin, chief of Clan Cuain, whose daughter he had violated, and who renounced his allegiance to O'Dowd, and placed himself under the protection of Mac Dermot, chief of Moylurg. This must have occurred early in the twelfth century. He had, 2, Aodh, or Hugh O'Dowd, the ancestor of the subsequent chiefs.\n\n19. Aodh, or Hugh, son of Taithleach O'Dubhda, father of\n\n20. Muircheartach O'Dubhda, who was the father of\n\n21. Aodh, or Hugh O'Dubhda.  He had three sons; 1, Taithleach, ancestor of the subsequent chiefs; 2, Brian Dearg, from whom the Clann Taithligh Oig [Clantahilly Og] O'Dowd are descended; and, 3, Muircheartach. He was probably the Aodh, son of Muircheartach O'Dubdha, lord of Tireragh and Tirawley, who died in 1143.\n\n22. Taithleach, or Tahilly, son of Aodh, or Hugh O'Dubhda.  He seems to be the Taithleach O'Dubdha, lord of Tirawley and Tireragh, who was killed by his own two wicked grandsons in the year 1192. He had one son.\n\n23. Aodh, or Hugh, son of Taithleach, who was father of the celebrated\n\n24. Donnchadh Mor, or Donogh More O'Dubhda.  He appears first in the Irish annals at the year 1207, under which he is called by the Four Masters lord of Tirawley and Tireragh. In this year he joined Diarmaid, son of Maghnus O'Conor, Cormac Mac Dermot, and O'Hara, lord of Leyny, to oppose Cathal Carrach O'Conor, who had invaded and plundered Mac Dermott's country. A battle ensued between them, in which Cathal Carrach was defeated, taken prisoner, and deprived of his eyes, in order that by being maimed, he might have no further pretensions to chieftainship.\n\nIn the year 1213 he hired a fleet of fifty-six ships at the Hebrides, which he joined with his own, and sailed into the bay of Cuan Modh, now Clew Bay, where he landed on Inis Raithin, and compelled Cathal Croibhdhearg, or Charles the Redhanded O'Conor, King of Connaught, to give up to him his territory, extending from the river Robe to Drumcliff, free of tribute.\n\nHaving now carried the pedigree of this family down to a period at which their history becomes very certain, and pregnant with facts, the Editor will next glance back at the line of descent, to show that the genealogical books of the Mac Firbises have not preserved to us all the branches that sprang from the main trunk of the genealogical tree of this great race. This will be sufficiently obvious from the following passages in the Annals of the Four Masters:\n\nA. D. 899. Joseph of Loch Con, abbot of Clonmacnoise, died. He was of the sept of the northern Hy-Fiachrach.\n\np.352\n\nA. D. 905. Aodh, son of Maolpatraig, lord of Hy-Fiachrach, was slain by Niall, son of Aodh.\n\nA. D. 1059.

The son of Domhnall O'Dubhda, lord of Hy-Amhalgaidh, was slain.\n\nIn 1139 Mathghamhain, or Mahon O'Dubhda, chief of the race of Flaithbheartach, is mentioned, but he was of the O'Dubhdas or Duddies of Ulster. See p. 112, note q recte p. 111, note g, corresponding to 278 in the CELT edition.\n\nA. D. 1143. Aodh, son of Muircheartach O'Dubhda, lord of the northern Hy-Fiachrach and Hy-Amhalgaidh, died. This Aodh may have been Aodh, No. 21, in the above pedigree, but this is far from certain, as the number of generations from him to Maoileachlainn, No. 16, who died in 1005, would be too many.\n\nA D. 1153. Brian O'Dubhda, lord of the northern Hy-Fiachrach, was slain in the battle of Craebh tinne.\n\nA. D. 1154. A fleet was sent out by King Toirdhealbhach, or Turlogh O'Conor, to coast Ireland towards the north, consisting of the fleets of Dun Gaillmhe [Galway fort], Connmhaicne mara [now Connamara], Hy-Amhalgaidh, and Hy-Fiachrach, over all which Cosnamhach O'Dubhda was placed as chief commander. These plundered Tirconnell and Inishowen. The Cinel Eoghain, with their chief Muircheartach, son of Niall, observing their designs, went over the sea to hire the fleets of the Gall-Gadelians of Arann, Cantire, the Isle of Mann, and of other parts of Scotland, over all which Mac Scellig was chosen as commander. When they came near Inishowen the Connacian fleet met them, and a fierce and obstinate sea fight ensued between them which continued from morning till evening, during which many of the Connacians were slain by the strangers, and among the rest their chief commander Cosnamhach O'Dubhda.\n\np.353\n\nThe strangers were however defeated and slaughtered, and deprived of their ships, and Mac Scellig, their leader, lost his teeth.\n\nA. D. 1162. Cosnamhach O'Dubhda, lord of Tirawley, was slain by his own tribe. This was the celebrated Cosnamhach (son of Aodh, son of Cathbharr, son of Domhnall, son of Maolruanaidh), who was killed by O'Gloinin at Inishcoe. He had a son Cosnamhach, who was slain in 1181.\n\nA. D. 1182. Murchadh, the son of Taithleach O'Dubhda, was slain by Maolseachlainn O'Mulrony.\n\nBy a comparison of these entries in the Annals with the line of the pedigree of the O'Dowds as preserved by the Mac Firbises, and as fully displayed in the large Genealogical Table, it will be seen that there were several distinguished members of the family whose names have not been entered in the pedigree. The truth evidently is, that the Mac Firbises have preserved no more than the direct line of this pedigree, from the progenitor Dubhda, or Dowda, down to Donnchadh Mor, No. 24, excepting the names of a few of the senior or junior branches, such as they knew had become the founders of distinct septs. To return to the pedigree, Donnchadh Mor, No. 24, supra, had four sons, namely, Brian Dearg O'Dubhda, lord of Tireragh, Tirawley, and Erris, who, according to the Annals of the Four Masters, was killed on the road while on his pilgrimage to the abbey of Boyle; 2, Maolruanaidh, the ancestor of the subsequent chiefs; 3, Muircheartach, or Murtogh, ancestor of the Clann Conchobhair, who, on the death of his brother, Brian Dearg, in 1242, became chief of Hy-Fiachrach, and was, during his short career, a powerful chieftain, and at constant strife with the O'Conors. In the year 1246 he slew Maelseachlainn, the son of Conchobhar Ruadh, who was son of Muircheartach Muimhneach, or Murtogh, the Momonian O'Conor, for which he was banished over sea; but in the year following, 1247, he returned, accompanied by his friend O'Boyle, with a fleet, and made a descent upon the coast of Carbury, to be revenged on the O'Conors by plundering that territory, but on this occasion the crew of one of his ships, who were under the command of Maghnus O'Boyle, were drowned at the island of Inis Tuathrass, on the coast of Carbury. But his career of glory was short; he was slain in the year 1248 by the son of Felim O'Conor, as thus recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters:  A. D. 1248. Muircheartach O'Dubhda, surnamed the Aithchleireach, lord of that tract of country extending from Cill Dairbhile [now Termon Dervilla], in Erris, to the Strand [i. e. the strand of Traigh Eothuile], was slain by the son of Felim O'Conor. The fourth son of Donnchadh Mor was Taithleach, who was the father of Conchobhar, or Conor Conallach O'Dubhda, who became chief of Tireragh and was drowned in the Shannon in the year 1291, but his race seems to have become extinct in a few generations. Donnchadh\n\np.354\n\nMor had a daughter Mor, who became the wife of O'Boyle, the chief of the opposite coast, and who died in the year 1249.\n\nOne of the sons of this Donnchadh Mor O'Dubhda is charged with a very atrocious crime by the Irish annalists, who fortunately do not afford us the clue to discover which of the sons to brand with it. The Four Masters speak of it as follows in their Annals:  A. D. 1244. Maoliosa Mac an Easpuig O'Maoilfoghmhair [Malisa Macanespie O'Mulfover], parson of Tireragh and Tirawley, who, from his wisdom, was intended for the episcopal dignity, was killed by the son of Donnchadh O'Dubhda, a deed strange to his family, for none of the O'Dubhdas had ever before that time killed an ecclesiastic.\n\n25. Maolruanaidh, or Mulrony, son of Donnchadh Mor O'Dubhda.  Though this Mulroney was the progenitor of the subsequent chiefs he does not appear to have ever been chief himself, for, in the record of his death given in the Annals of the Four Masters at the year 1238, he is styled Maolruanaidh, son of Donnchadh O'Dubhda:  A.D. 1238. Maolruanaidh, the son of Donnchadh O'Dubhda, was slain by Maoilseachlainn, son of Conchobhar Ruadh, who was the son of Muircheartach Muimhneach O'Conor, assisted by the son of Tighearnan, who was the son of Cathal Mac Arnain O'Conor.\n\nAccording to a modern account of the descendants of this Mulrony O'Dubhda, inserted in a modern hand in the Book of Lecan, and which shall be given in these Addenda, he had three sons, viz., Taithleach, Muaidhe, Donnchadh Mor, ancestor of the Clann Donogh O'Dubhda, formerly seated in the district of Coolcarney, and Cosnamhach, archbishop of Tuam; but that this genealogy is spurious is obvious from the fact that it totally differs from the original text of the Book of Lecan, as well as from the account given by Duald Mac Firbis; and that it appears from the Irish annals that Donnchadh Mor O'Dubhda, the ancestor of the Clann Donogh, could not have been the son of Mulrony who was slain in 1238, for Donnchadh died Tanist of Hy-Fiachrach in the year 1337, that is, ninety-nine years after the death of his supposed father. But the truth clearly is, that Donnchadh Mor was, as the original text of the Book of Lecan makes him, the grandson of Maolruanaidh, or Mulroney, and the son, not the brother, of Taithleach Muaidhe, who was slain in 1282. According to the Book of Lecan and Duald Mac Firbis this Maolruanaidh, or Mulroney, had two sons, namely, Taithleach Muaidhe, or Tahilly of the Moy, of whom presently, and Cosnamhach, archdeacon [not archbishop] of Tuam, and a daughter Dervorgilla, who was the mother of Tomalltach O'Conor, archbishop of Tuam, and died in 1265.\n\n26. Taithleach Muaidhe, or Tahilly of the Moy, son of Mulrony O'Dubhda.  This warlike chieftain, in order to be revenged of William Mor Barrett, who had wrested\n\np.355\n\nfrom him the entire of the territory of Tirawley, joined Adam Cusack,  who was then making strong efforts to conquer this part of Connaught,  against the Barretts, and a fierce battle was fought between them at Moyne, near Killala (where a great monastery was a long time after erected). In this battle, wherein O'Dubhda was assisted by bis neighbour O'Boyle, William Mor Barrett was defeated, mortally wounded, and taken prisoner. But Adam Cusack, notwithstanding the assistance received from O'Dubhda in this battle, turned his arms against him the year following, and slew him at a place called, from that circumstance, Bel Atha Tailtigh, i. e. the mouth of Tahilly's ford, situated near the margin of Traigh Eothuile, on the lands of Coillte Luighne, near Ballysadare. These facts are stated by the Four Masters in their Annals, and are also given in the Annals of Clonmacnoise, as we learn from the following quaint translation of the two passages by Connell Mageoghegan:\n\nA. D. 1281. There was a feild fought between the Barretts of the one side and the Cusackes of the other side, where the Barretts were vanquished; William Barrett and Adam Fflemyng, with many others, were slain. There were two Irishmen of Cusack's side that surpassed the companys of both sides for prowes, manhood, dexteritie of handling of arms, hardiness, and all other parts of activity, named Taihleagh O'Dowdie and Taihleagh O'Boyle.\n\nA. D. 1282. Taihleagh mac Moyleronie O'Dowdie (before spoken of), prince of the contrey of Offiaghrach Moye, one of great prowes and bounty, and of great and continuall dissention with the English, and all foreigners, in defence of his contry, was killed by Adam Cusack at Beerhaven.\n\nHere Mageoghegan renders Traigh Eothuile by Beerhaven, an error equalled only by that of Haliday, who, in his translation of the first part of Keating's History of Ireland, renders it Youghal, and evidently takes it to be the strand of Youghal, in the south-east of the county of Cork.\n\nThis Adam Cusack was defeated by Maghnus O'Conor at Ballysadare in the year 1285, on which occasion Collin Cusack, his brother, and many others, were slain. He died in the year 1287, after which we hear of no more triumphs of the Cusacks in Connaught, and the Barretts appear to have recovered all their possessions in Tirawley, of which he seems for a time to have deprived them.\n\nTaithleach Muaidhe O'Dubhda had three sons, viz., Sen Bhrian, of whom presently, Donnchadh Mor, ancestor of the Clann Donogh O'Dubhda, who died in 1337, and Maoileachlainn Carrach, who was slain in 1316. There were many distinguished men among this sept of the family, as William, Bishop of Killala, who died in 1350; Muircheartach Cleireach, chief of the Clann Donogh, who died in 1402, but they disappear from history about the middle of the fifteenth century.\n\np.356\n\n27. Sen Bhrian, or old Brian, the son of Taithleach Muaidhe O'Dubhda.  Duald Mac Firbis states in his short annals of this family, that this Brian was eighty-four years chief of his name; but we must conclude from the authentic Irish annals that he could not have reigned so long, and we may well believe that fifty-four years, as given in a more modern hand in the Book of Lecan, was the true period. The first notice of this chieftain to be found in the Annals of the Four Masters is at the year 1278, in which he and Art na g-Capall [of the horses] O'Hara, lord of Leyny, gave battle to the Berminghams, and defeated them, killing the two sons of Meyler Mor, Conor Roe Bermingham and others. This was in the life-time of his father, and still he does not appear to have succeeded his father, for the Annals record the death, by drowning, of Conchobhar, or Conor Conallach O'Dubhda, lord of Tir Fiachrach, in the year 1291. In the year 1308, as we learn from the Annals of Clonmacnoise, he joined the English of Leyny and Tireragh to plunder the O'Conors of Carbury. But in 1316 he joined Felim O'Conor and the Irish in the memorable battle of Athenry, where the English had mustered the best appointed and most formidable army that they had ever before sent against the native Irish. In this battle, in which the English were well armed, and drawn up in regular military array, and the Irish without armour1016, eleven thousand of the Irish were slain, and tradition says that the O'Conors were so completely defeated that throughout all Connaught not one man of the name, Felim's brother excepted, could be found who was able to bear arms.\n\nAccording to the Annals of the Four Masters Brian O'Dubhda, lord of Tireragh, commanded his people in this battle, and lost therein his brother Maoileachlainn Carrach and two of the principal men of his name. The following account of this battle is given in the Annals of Clonmacnoise as translated, in the year 1627, by Connell Mageoghegan:\n\nA. D. 1316. Felym O'Connor [after having slain Rory O'Connor, who had usurped the throne of Connaught] took all the preys and spoyles of all that belonged to Rowry O'Connor, or that partaked with him before, and took himself the government and name of King of Connought, as before he had, which extends from Easroe, in Ulster, to Eaghtge; took hostages, for the preservation of allegeance, of the Breniemen, and constituted Ualargge O'Roirke as their king; alsoe he took the hostages of the\n\np.357\n\nO'Kellys, O'Maddens, O'Dermodaes, O'Haras, O'Dowdies; and after setting himself [up] he prepared an army with whom he went to banish the English out of Connaught; immediately burnt the town of Athleathan, killed Stephen D'Exeter therein, Miles Cogan, William Prendergrass, and John Stanton, Knights, and also William Lawless, with a great slaughter of their people. He burnt all the contrey from the place called Castle Corran to Roba, took all their preys and spoyles; returned to his house with a ritch booty of his enemies, and a fortunate success in his affairs.\n\nKing Felym having thus returned to his house made no long stay, but went to Milick to meet with those of Munster and Leathmoye, where he burnt and fell down the castle at first. Mortagh O'Bryen, prince of Thomond, came to his house, and all the families of the O'Briens face to face, with whom he returned to Roscomon to fall the Castle thereof to the Earth.\n\nFelym O'Conor hearing of the returne of William Burke to Connought from Scotland, he proclaimed that all his people from all parts where they were, with such as wou'd joyn with them, wou'd gather together to banish William Burke from out of Connought, at whose command all the Irishrie of Connought from Easroe to Eghtge were obedient and came to that place of meeting. Donnogh O'Bryen, prince of Thomond, O'Melaughlyn, king of Meath, O'Royrck of the Breffine, O'Ferall, chieftain of the Analie, called the Convackne, Teig O'Kelly, king of Imaine, with many others of the nobilitie of Ireland, came to this assembly, and marched towards Athenrie to meet with William Burke, the Lord Bremyngham and others, the English of the province of Connought, where they met and gave battle in a place neer the said towne, the Irishmen in which battle were discomfitted and quite overthrowen.\n\nFelym O'Connor, King of Connaught, was therein killed, also Teig O'Kelly, King of Imaine, and eight and twenty of the chiefest of that family. Magnus mac Dermott O'Connor, Tanist of all Connaught, Art O'Hara, prince of Lwyne; Melaghlyn Carragh O'Dowdie; Connor Oge O'Dowdie; Mortagh mac Connor O'Dowdie; Dermott Mac Dermott, Tanist of Moylorge; Mortagh mac Taithleagh Mac Dermoda; Mortagh mac Dermoda O'Fferall; Mullronie Oge Mac Magnosa; John mac Morrogh O'Madden; Donnell O'Boylle; Donnogh O'Molloye of Fearkeal, with his people; the son of Murrogh Mac Mahon with a hundred of his people; Neal Ffox, prince of Teaffie-men, with his people; Ferrall mac John Gallda O'Ferall; William mac Hugh Oge O'Feralle; Thomas Mac Awley O'Fferall; Tomaltagh, Morragh, Connor, Mortagh, and Melaughlyn Mac Donnough; John Mackeigan, O'Connor's chief Judge; Connor and Gillernew, the sons of Dalredocker O'Dovelen, the man called Fear imchar na h-onchon [i e. O'Connor's standard bearer], Thomas O'Connolan of the king's guard; all which persons, with many others of Munster, Meath, and Connaught (which were\n\np.358\n\ntedious to recite) were slain in that battle, as a certain Irish poet pitifully in an Irish verse said: \n\nMór mac rígh nach abraim ainm\n\nDo marbhadh is an mór-mhaidhm,\n\nDo shluagh Midhe is Mumhan,\n\nTruagh lem chrídhi in cathughadh.1017\n\nThis battle was given [fought] upon the day of St. Lawrence the Martyre. Felym then being but of the age of twenty-three years, in the fifth year of whose reign Rowrye mac Cahall Roe O'Connor (before mentioned) deposed him for one half year, who being killed, as before is described, Felym succeeded for another half year, untill he was slain at Athenrie aforesaid.\n\nRowry, surnamed Rowry na ffidh, mac Donnogh, mac Owen, mac Rowrie, succeeded next as King of Connaught.\n\nSir Richard Cox states ( Hist. of Ireland, p. 97) that after this battle the Berminghams took a prey of two thousand cows from the O'Conors, and that eight thousand of the Irish were slain; and that the King of England, on receiving the news of this victory, granted to Sir Richard De Bermingham the title of Baron of Athenree, which his descendants have enjoyed ever since.\n\nThis Brian O'Dubhda died, according to the Irish annals, in the year 1354, when he must have been at least a century old, for he was in active service in the field as early as 1278. Duald Mac Firbis says that he recovered a great portion of the original territory, particularly Tireragh, from the English, and divided it among his own sons, grandsons, and great grandsons. He married Una, the daughter of Felim, who was the son of Cathal Croibhdhearg O'Conor, King of Connaught, and had by her eight sons, viz., Domhnall Cleireach, his successor, of whom presently; 2, Maolruanaidh, or Mulroney, who died in 1362; 3, Maghnus Cleireach, who died in 1359; 4, Diarmaid; 5, Aodh, the father of Brian Cam, and Edmond, chiefs of Tireragh; 6, Cosnamhach; 7, Niall; 8, Brian Og, who was slain by the Barretts in 1373.\n\n28. Domhnall Cleireach, or Donnell the Citric, son of Old Brian O'Dubhda.  He succeeded his father in 1354, and died in 1380. In his time the English made strong efforts to get possession of his territory of Tireragh, which was all that remained with the O'Dowds at this period, though they still laid claim to Tirawley; but in the year\n\np.359\n\n1371 he drove the English out of his territory and took possession of the castles of Ardnarea and Castleconor, in which they had strengthened themselves, and then divided the lands among his brothers and followers. The Four Masters have the following notice of his death:  A. D. 1380. Domhnall, the son of Brian O'Dubhda, lord of Tireragh and Tirawley, defender of his principality against his English and Irish enemies, died at his own mansion seat [Dun Neill] on the third of May, and his son Ruaidhri assumed his place.\n\nAccording to a list of the chiefs of the O'Dubhda family, inserted in a modern hand in the Book of Lecan, he was chief for forty-nine years and a half, but, according to Duald Mac Firbis, he reigned but thirty-six years, and if we date the commencement of his reign in 1354, when his father died, we cannot allow him a longer period than twenty-six years, but it is highly probable that his father had resigned the chieftainship to him several years before his death.\n\nDomhnall Cleireach O'Dubhda married the daughter of O'Malley, chief of Umhall, and had by her ten sons, viz., 1, Ruaidhri, his successor, of whom presently; 2, Maghnus, who, in 1461, according to Ware, slew Connor O'Connell, Bishop of Killala; 3, Maoileachlainn; 4, Tadhg Riabhach, or Teige Reagh, who succeeded as chief of Tireragh in 1417, and died in 1432. It was in the time of this Teige Reagh that the abbey of Ardnarea, the ruins of which still remain in good preservation, was founded for monks of the order of St. Augustin, A. D. 1427.  See De Burgo Hibernia Dominicana and Archdall's Monasticon. It was in his time also the Book of Lecan was compiled by Giolla Iosa Mor Mac Firbis, who, in 1417, addressed to him the topographical poem, published in this volume: though it would appear from a memorandum at the bottom of folio 40, that the work had been commenced in the time of his brother Ruaidhri, who died in that year. This Teige Reagh was the ancestor of several chiefs of Tireragh, and of the famous family of the Dowds of Dublin, but the Editor being of opinion that this family is now extinct, deems it unnecessary to give their pedigree in this place, as it has been already given, though without dates, in the text of Duald Mac Firbis. But should the Dowds of Dublin be extant they will see the line of their descent, traced for thirty-four generations, in the large Genealogical Table hereunto prefixed. Domhnall Cleireach had, 5, John; 6, Domhnall Og; 7, Donnchadh; 8, Diarmaid, who died in 1439; 9, Aodh; and, 10, Eoghan, who was living in 1420.\n\n29. Ruaidhri, Rory, or Roger, son of Domhnall Cleireach O'Dubhda.  He succeeded his father in the year 1380, and died in the year 1417, under which the Four Masters have the following notice of his death: A. D. 1417. O'Dubhda (Ruaidhri, son of Domhnall, who was son of Brian, son of Taithleach), fountain of the prosperity and\n\np.360\n\nwealth of Tireragh, died at his own mansion seat [Dun Neill] after the festival of St. Bridget, and his brother Tadhg Riabhach assumed his place.\n\nThis Ruaidhri married the daughter of Mac Costello, and had by her, 1, Maolruanaidh, his successor, of whom presently; 2, Conchobhar, or Conor; 3, Maghnus Cleireach; 4, Muircheartach; 5, Eoghan Caoch; 6, William, who died in 1438.\n\n30. Maolruanaidh, or Mulrony, son of Ruaidhri O'Dubhda. He was elected chief of his name in 1432, according to Duald Mac Firbis, and died at Liathmhuine, now Leafony, in 1447. He married the daughter of Mac Wattin Barrett, and had, 1, Diarmaid; 2, Domhnall Ballach, who was chief of the name for one year, and who was the father of William, chief of his name, who died in 1496; 3, Maoileachlainn; 4, Muircheartach Caoch.\n\n31. Diarmaid, son of Maolruanaidh O'Dubhda. He never attained to the chieftainship, though he was the senior of the race, and the ancestor of almost all the subsequent heads of the family. The name of his wife is not given, but it is stated that he had two sons, namely, 1, Conchobhar, or Conor O'Dubhda, of whom presently; 2, Brian.\n\n32. Conchobhar, or Conor, son of Diarmaid O'Dubhda. He succeeded Felim, the son of Tadhg Buidhe, or Teige Boy O'Dubhda, in the year 1508, and died in the abbey of Moyne about the year 1538, after having been thirty years chief of his name. In the year 1527 he took Mac Donogh prisoner. In 1532 his sons took the castle of Ardnarea from the sons of John Burke, in consequence of which great dissensions arose between them and the descendants of Richard Burke, and many depredations and slaughters were committed on both sides, and in the next year the Burkes got possession of Ardnarea, since which the O'Dubhdas, or O'Dowds, never recovered it. He married Margaret, daughter of Thomas Roe Burke, and had by her, 1, Eoghan, his successor, of whom presently; 2, Fearadhach; 3, Ruaidhri; 4, Cormac, a friar; 5, Cathal Dubh, who became chief of his name, and consented to pay tribute to the Lower Mac William Burke; 6, Dathi; 7, John Glas; and, 8, Brian.\n\n33. Eoghan, or Owen, son of Conchobhar O'Dubhda. He succeeded his father about the year 1538, and was chief of his name for seven years. He married Sabia (the daughter of Walter, son of Richard) Burke, who was taken prisoner by O'Donnell in 1536. He was himself taken prisoner by Mac William of Clanrickard in 1542, as we are informed by the Four Masters, but we know no more of his history, except that he and his wife were interred in the same tomb in the abbey of Moyne. He had four sons, viz., 1, Tadhg Riabhach, or Teige Reagh, his successor; 2, Edmond; 3, Ceallach; and, 4, Conchobhar, or Conor.\n\n34. Tadhg, or Teige Reagh, son of Eoghan O'Dubhda. He seems to have succeeded his father about the year 1545, and we learn from the Four Masters that he died in\n\np.361\n\nthe year 1580. A.D. 1580. Tadhg Riabhach, son of Eoghan, son of Conchobhar O'Dowd, died. The name of his wife is not given by Mac Firbis, who informs us that he had seven sons: 1, Dathi, of whom presently; 2, Tadhg Buidhe, or Teige Boy, who was made O'Dubhda by O'Donnell in 1595; 3, Fearadhach; 4, Domhnall, or Donnell, the father of Teige Reagh, mentioned in the settlement of 1656, to be presently given; 5, Maolruanaidh; 6, Eoghan; 7, John Og.\n\n35. Dathi or David, son of Tadhg Riabhach O'Dubhda. He was slain in the year 1594, under which he is styled chief of his name by the Four Masters. A. D. 1544. O'Dubhda of Tireragh (Dathi, son of Tadhg Riabhach, son of Eoghan) was slain by one of the queen's soldiers in one of his own castles in Tireragh of the Moy.\n\nHe married Miss Ellenor Lyens, afterwards Lady Ellenor Ghest, by whom he had two sons, viz., Dathi, or David O'Dubhda, his heir, and William O'Dubhda. This appears from an inquisition taken at Sligo on the third of April, 1623, preserved in the Rolls Office, Dublin, which finds that David O'Dowde, late of Castleconnor, Esq., deceased, was seised of that castle and several other lands; that he died, leaving David O'Dowde, junior, his son and heir; that Ellenor Lyens, alias Dowde (now Lady Ellenor Ghest), was the lawful wife of the said David O'Dowde, senior, and that she is dowable of the one-third of all his lands; that after the death of the said David O'Dowde she married three several husbands, viz., Sir Lionell Ghest, Knight, who died; then William May, Esq., who also died; and after his death, and in the reign of our present sovereign Lord [Charles I.] she married Gerald Fitz-Morrice Fitzgerald, who is now [1633] living.\n\n36. Dathi, or David, junior, son of David, O'Dubhda. On the third Patent Roll of the first year of the reign of King James I., there is enrolled A Grant to Lionel Geste, or Ghest, of the wardship of David O'Dowde, son and heir of David O'Dowde, late of Killinglass, in the county of Sligo, Gent., deceased, for the fine of ten pounds Irish, and an annual rent of seven pounds, retaining five pounds thereof for his (the ward's) maintenance and education in the English religion and habits, and in Trinity College, Dublin, from the twelfth to the eighteenth year of his age. Dated 1st Nov., 1603.\n\nIt appears that when this David, junior, came of age, in 1612, he entered upon and took possession of his father's lands without suing out livery of seisin from His Majesty, which the law then required to make his title good; upon which William Chapman of Rossleagh made a discovery of same unto His Majesty, upon which His Majesty, in consideration of such service, as was then the custom, by his letters patent under the great seal of England, dated the first day of December, in the eleventh year of his reign, granted unto the said William Chapman the benefitt and profitt of three\n\np.362\n\nfourth partes of all Intrusions, fynes for alienations, mesne profitts, and other emoluments and profitts whatsoever due unto His Majestie by reason of any warship and primer seisin, ousterlermayne, or any cause whatsoever uppon any mannors, castles, lands, and tenements of David O'Dowde of Killglasse, in the coontee of Sligo, Gent, by reason of the death of his ffather, or any other of his ancestors, or of any lands that is found by office that David O'Dowde, father unto the said David, died seised of.\n\nThe original letters patent to William Chapman, Esq., are now in very good preservation, and in the possession of the O'Dowda of Bunnyconnellan. On the third day of December, 1613, this William Chapman sold his right to these fines to William May, of Castleconnor, Esq., who was young David O'Dowda's step-father, being, as appears from the inquisition already quoted, the third husband of his mother, Lady Ellenor Ghest.\n\nFrom an original deed in the possession of the present O'Dowda, it appears that this David O'Dowda, of Castleconnor, Esq., was married to Joan Burke, by whom be had,\n\n37. James O'Dowda. He married on the 23rd [effaced] 1632, Evelyn Burke, daughter of Walter Burke, of Turlough, Esq., as appears by his marriage settlement, now in very bad preservation, in the possession of the present O'Dowda. This James died many years before his father. He was living in 1639, as appears by a deed in the possession of the present O'Dowda, dated 10th April, 1639, in which he is called James Dowde, of Castleconnor, Gentleman; but he was dead in 1641, as appears by another deed, dated last day of October, 1641, whereby his father, David O'Dowda, of Castleconnor, Esq., enfeoffs unto Fearil O'Garae of Moyh [Moy O'Gara, in Coolavin] and Walter Burke of Ardagh, in the county of Mayo, Gentleman, of the castle of Castleconnor, and three quarters of land thereunto adjoining, viz., the quarter of Slievnamesgiry, the quarter of Cloonalangy, and the quarter of Ballinaleynagh, in the barony of Tireragh, to the use of said David and Jewane Burke, his wife, during their lives, and after the death of the said David, the heirs or assigns of James O'Dowda (son and heir of the said David,) shall pass an assurance unto the said Jewane of lands to the clear yearly value of forty pounds of good, fine, pure silver, every year during her life.\n\nBy this Evelyn Burke, James O'Dowda had one son, namely,\n\n38. Dathi Og, or David, junior, O'Dowda. He is the last generation given by Duald Mac Firbis, who states in his smaller genealogical compilation that he was living in the year 1666, and we shall see presently that they were acquaintances. He married in 1656 Dorothy, daughter of Teige Reagh O'Dowda (son of Donnell, son of Teige Reagh, No. 34, supra), by whom he got a considerable fortune, though he had lost all his estate during the civil wars. His marriage articles, which are signed by the Irish\n\np.363\n\nantiquary Duald Mac Firbis, are dated the 17th of April, 1656, and as they throw a curious light upon the history of the times, they are given here word for word.\n\nIndented Articles of Agreement concluded, covenanted, and agreed upon this seventeenth Day of April, Anno Domini One Thousand Six Hundred Fifty and Six, by and between David Dowda the younger, of Castleconnor, in the County of Sligo, Gentleman, of the one part, and Teig Reagh O'Dowd of Castletown, of the said County, Gentleman, of the other parte, for and concerning a Marriage to be had and solemnized between the said David and Dorothy Dowda, Daughter to the said Teig.\n\nFirst, it is agreed, covenanted, and graunted by and between the said parties that the said David shall, at or before the last day of May next ensuing the date hereof, wedd, marry, and take to wife the said Dorothy, according to the rites, laws, and customs of the Holy Catholic Church, and that the said Dorothy shall accordingly wedd, marry, and take to husband the said David.\n\nItem, it is covenanted and agreed upon by and between the said parties that the said Teige shall, in consideration of the said marriage, give and satisfie unto the said David, as marriage portion to and with the said Dorothy, the number of cows, sheep, cattle following, viz., fourty great cows, to be milch cows next summer, fifteen heifers of two years old, fifteen yearling heflfers, one hundred sheep, one horse, and one plough.

JAMES FERBISSY.\n\nDANIEL DOWDE.\n\nThis Dorothy, who became the wife of this Dathi, was the daughter of Teige O'Dowd by Margery Bermingham, daughter of John, a younger son of the Lord Baron of Athenry, and this Margery being an heiress, the O'Dowds became, as would appear from the family papers, entitled to quarter the Bermingham or Athenry arms with their own, but this they have not done.\n\nIt appears from the foregoing marriage articles that David Dowda, junior, was left without any estate, but that he had a strong expectation of being soon restored, and in this he was not disappointed, for the Commissioners appointed for the setting out of Lands to the Irish in Connaught and the County of Clare, restored him in August, 1656, to a small estate in the parish of Kilgarvan, barony of Gallen, and county of Mayo, the ancient patrimony of the Clann Donogh O'Dubhda. This appears from the original grant in the possession of the present O'Dowda, which is as follows:\n\nBy the Commissioners for setting out lands to the Irish in the province of Connaught and county of Clare.\n\nIn consequence of the Decree of the Commissioners for adjudication of the Claimes and qualifications of the Irish, graunted on behalfe of David O'Dowda, of Leafonye, in the county of Sligoe, whereby hee is adjudged to have two third partes of his estates by virtue of the right qualification wherein he is compressed, sett out to him in the province of Connaght, or county of Clare; it is ordered and heerby impowered to enter\n\np.366\n\ninto, and take possession of one thousand five hundred and forty-six acres in the land hereafter specified, viz., in the two quarters of Carowcrum and Carcacrum, one hundred and thirty-two acres; in the two quarters of Boneconelan two hundred and seventy-six acres; Carrowlaban, one quarter, one hundred and fifty-three acres; Carrowreagh, one quarter, one hundred and twenty-nine acres; Kilnegarvan one hundred and fifty acres; Raredane, two quarters, two hundred and ninety-seven acres; Carrownegloontagh, one quarter, one hundred and fifteen acres; Carrownecarra, one quarter, one hundred and ninety-nine acres; and in Carrownegloch, one quarter, ninety-five acres; all lying in the parish of Kilnegarvan, barony of Galleng, and county of Mayo, to have and to hould all and singular the said lands, with all the houses, buildings, mills, fishing weyres, water courses, and other improvements and appurtenances, to him, the said David O'Dowda, his heyres and assignes for ever, in full satisfaction of his estate, according to the tenor of the said Decree; and the High Sheriff of the said county, or his Deputye, is hereby required and authorized to put him in full and quiet possession of the premises, takinge for his paynes five shillings, and no more.

See Will of 1731, next page.\n\nIn 1705, this David and his fourth son, Dominic, then the only surviving son, sold several denominations of land to a Mr. Wingfield, as appears from the original deed of sale, in the possession of the present O'Dowda.\n\n39. Dominic O'Dowda, fourth son of David.  He married, in 1703, Ellice Dillon, daughter of Theobald Dillon, Esq., whose brother was a colonel in the service of James II., and died in 1737, leaving by her David O'Dowda, his eldest son (see Lodge's Peerage by Archdall, vol. ii. p. 182), who married Letitia Browne, daughter of James\n\np.367\n\nBrowne of Kilticolla, afterwards Brownehall, in the county of Mayo, Esq., and died without issue. This is the David mentioned by the venerable Charles O'Conor, in his Dissertations on the History of Ireland, in 1753, as the head of the O'Dowds. On the 6th of August, 1776, he and his wife Letitia O'Dowda, otherwise Browne, obtained a decree in Chancery against George Fitzgerald, Esq., of Turlough, in the county of Mayo; 2, James, an officer in the French service, who died without issue; and, 3, Thady O'Dowda, a colonel in the army of the Emperor Joseph.\n\nHis Will is dated 18th September, 1731, and is as follows:\n\nIn nomine Dei.

Our old Annals pay a large Tribute of Praise to this family, and it is represented at present by a Gentleman of the strictest Probity, David, or properly Dathy O'Dowda, of Ballycollanan [rectius Bunnyconnellan], in the County of Mayo, Esquire.\n\n40. Thady, Teige, or Thaddaeus O'Dowda, third son of Dominic O'Dowda. Sir Richard Musgrave states, in his Memoirs of the different Rebellions in Ireland, that this Thady being a younger brother, and having neither property nor employment at home, went out a volunteer to Germany at the age of twenty-five years, and in the course of time was promoted, in the Hungarian service, to the rank of captain [recte colonel], having previously married a German lady, sister to the Baron Wipler [recte Vippler], of whom James O'Doude was the issue.\n\nAccording to the tradition in the family this Thaddaeus O'Dowda, who was called at home Tadhg Riabhach O'Dubhda, went out to Germany and entered the Austrian service, accompanied by Manus O'Donnell, who was promoted to the rank of general, and also by George Fitzgerald of Turlough, the father of the celebrated George Robert Fitzgerald. That he was promoted to the rank of colonel, and was one of the largest and bravest men in Germany, and that Antonia Vippler, the sister of Baron Vippler, residing in Silesia, fell in love with him, to whom, after much opposition on the part of her family, who threw many difficulties in his way, and even procured his imprisonment,\n\np.369\n\nhe was finally married, and through whom he was introduced to the highest circles in Germany. By her he had issue James O'Dowda, who was commonly called the Baron O'Dowda, of whom presently, and another son, who died young in Germany.\n\n41. Captain James O'Dowda, commonly called Baron O'Dowda. Sir Richard Musgrave states, in his Memoirs of the different Rebellions in Ireland, that this James O'Dowda was born and educated in the Hungarian service, and that he had only arrived at the rank of lieutenant, in which station, he adds, he served, when the death of his uncle, David O'Doude, who possessed the family estate, and died without issue, was announced to him. In consequence of this event, adds this historian, he left the army, came to Ireland, and took possession of the paternal property, which proved to be worth about £500 a year, and which he applied himself to the cultivation of with great attention.\n\nIt appears from the family papers, and particularly from a letter in the handwriting of his uncle, the Baron Vippler, that this James returned to Ireland shortly before the year 1788. In the will of Letitia Browne, alias O'Dowda, the widow of his uncle David O'Dowda, dated 10th February, 1798, she states that her late husband, David O'Dowda, lived in the Isle of Man, and she orders that all the papers and the deeds of mortgage respecting Mac Donnell of Elaghmore shall be given to Captain O'Dowda, whose property it is, together with the copy of the map of his estate, and all other papers belonging to him. Her nephew, James Browne, of Browne Hall, Esq., administered to this will.\n\nIn the statistical account of the parish of Kilmactige, in the diocese of Achonry, and county of Sligo, written by the Rev. James Nelligan, Rector and Vicar, and published in Mason's Parochial Survey, vol. ii. pp. 349398, the following curious account is given of the improvements made by this Captain James O'Dowda:\n\nA valuable improvement was made in this place about twenty years ago, through the exertions of a Captain O'Dowdd [a misprint for O'Dowda], who possessed an estate of many thousand acres of these mountains, which were without inhabitants, except those ferae naturae, and which were nearly impassable to the active and barefooted native. The immense rocks, steep hills, and deep caverns, which everywhere presented themselves, formed as many insuperable difficulties as the passage of the Alps did in former days; but this Hannibal by labour and perseverance overcame them all, and has now formed a road, where a coach passes six times a week, conveying passengers to and from Ballina and Castlerea, and has shortened the line from Ballina to Banada from twenty to twelve miles.\n\nThis Captain James O'Dowda, who is said to have been the godchild of the Emperor Joseph, was implicated in the rebellion of 1798, and executed at Killala in September,\n\np.370\n\n1798. A very curious sketch of his character is given by Sir Richard Musgrave, in his Memoirs of the different Rebellions in Ireland, vol. ii. pp. 622, 623, 624, where he says that considering himself the head of the Clan or family, he despised taking a Christian name, and always subscribed himself O'Doude, Captain, and latterly he had the vanity to assume the title of Baron, perhaps from his uncle Baron Wipler in Germany. Sir Richard says that this family counted twenty-five castles on their extensive estate, many of which are still in existence, and that they have a burying place appropriated to them in the abbey of Moyne, where may be seen the gigantick bones of some of them, who have been very remarkable for their great stature, as one of them exceeded seven feet in height. Vol. ii. p. 624.\n\nThis Captain James O'Dowda, who was popularly called the Baron O'Dowda, married Temperance Fitz Gerald, daughter of Robert Fitz Gerald, Esq., of Mount Tallant. This marriage took place in the year 1788 or early in 1789, when he was very young, as appears from a German letter in the handwriting of his uncle, the Baron Vippler, dated Wigstädt, the 21st November, 1788, of which the following translation, made for the Editor by that accomplished scholar, George Downes, Esq., author of Letters from Continental Countries, &c. &c., is worth preserving:\n\nMY DEAR NEPHEW,\n\nI was infinitely delighted to hear that of six letters written to you one had come to hand, and no less that you will be so kind as to admit the sincerity of my letter: you may now quite confidently believe that no one can have more sincere intentions towards you than I. You are then already quite determined to marry? To tell the truth, I would witness it with more pleasure if it were to happen a couple of years later; however, you are not to be checked; and I therefore wish you much joy. May you propitiously take this so great step, which is truly of the last importance! for every thing which is eternal ought to be undertaken with caution; and you, my good nephew, have not yet had the opportunity of acquiring sufficient experience of the world. Your future lot will therefore so much the more depend on fortune. And, dear O'Dowda, only keep religion and God constantly before your eyes; for such must be always kept in view by an honourable man. That you have become so good a manager, I am infinitely delighted to hear. God grant that you may continue in this course, and believe that the best enjoyment is one's own approbation! You can take myself as an example. How much have good friends cost me, and how little has been purchased!\n\nThat you have received no letter from my brother must not surprise you: you know already with what reluctance he writes. Now concerning your money. To speak\n\np.371\n\ncandidly, it is better for you not to be informed. If you did not get the money [...] and then you must [appear] at our court about permission.\n\nMac Kernan is gone on an expedition against the Turks: it is about two months since he left me, but I have not yet received a letter from him. Do not forget to assure your worthy aunt of the very devoted respect I entertain for her. I am delighted that you ride indefatigably: but be on your guard to avoid meeting with an accident.\n\nTo conclude,\n\nYour sincere uncle,\n\nYours from his heart,\n\nWM. VIPPLER\n\nThis letter proves beyond a question the connexion of Captain O'Dowda with the family of Vippler; but nothing has been yet discovered to prove that he became the heir of that family, or that he had any right to the title of Baron. The following letter, written by the Honourable Thomas Dillon to him, on the 17th of January, 1795, shows that a relative in Germany had left him a handsome sum of money. This relative was probably his uncle, the Baron Vippler:\n\nMy Dear Friend,\n\nIt gives me very great Pleasure to inform you that I had a Letter last Post from Lord Dillon, desiring I would send to you to give you the pleasing Intelligence of the following matter, which I give you down in his Lordship's Words. Inform O'Dowda directly that there is a handsome Sum of Money left to him by a Relation in Germany; tell him to write immediately to Baron Reiyensfield, Secretary to the Imperial Minister, No. 6, Bryanton-street, Portman-square, London, or to Count Starhemberg, the Imperial Minister, Portland-place, London; but if he will take my Advice he will set out directly for London. Let him call upon me; I will give him a letter to Count Starhemberg, and that will shorten all proceedings; he may otherwise meet with great delay.\n\nWishing you every prosperity, I remain, My Dear O'Dowda,\n\nYour very affectionate\n\nHumble Servant,\n\nTHOS.

Since the period alluded to they have been much praised, not only by the Irish bards, but by the more respectable writers of the country, and they had undoubtedly\n\np.373\n\nheld high rank in Connaught, and have intermarried with the best families of English descent, as the Burkes, Berminghams, Butlers, &c. It appears from a by-law of the Corporation of Galway, passed in 1648, that Lieutenant Colonel William O'Shaugnessie (in consideration of his alliance in bloode to the whole towne, and for good nature and affection that he and his whole family doe bear to it) and his posterity, shall be hereafter freemen of this corporation. History of Galway, p. 216. From their celebrity, high bearing, and character for integrity and honour in Ireland, De Burgo was induced, in his Hibernia Dominicana, to write of this family, cujus nobilitatem, antiquitatem, et integritatem qui non novit, Hiberniam non novit. Notwithstanding all these testimonies, however, the truth of history obliges us to state that the O'Shaughnessys are but rarely mentioned in ancient Irish history, and that no person of the name ever became full chief of Aidhne or the south Hy-Fiachrach, the O'Heynes, O'Clerys, or Mac Gillikellys being in turn the chiefs of that territory; but upon the decay of the family of O'Cathail, or O'Cahill, shortly after the period of the English invasion, the O'Shaughnessys became chiefs of the territory of Cinel Aodha, or Kinelea, which comprised the south-eastern half of the territory of Aidhne, and this was the highest rank they ever attained to.\n\nIn a Description of the Province of Connaught, dated in the month of January, 1612, published in the twenty-seventh volume of the Archaeologia, it is stated that the O'Heynes were then utterly banished; but that the O'Shaughnesses retnayned a rich and hable family. p. 126.\n\n4. Eochaidh Breac. He was the third son of the monarch Dathi, according to the Book of Lecan, but we are told no more about him, except that he was the ancestor of the southern Hy-Fiachrach, or the Hy-Fiachrach Aidhne, and of the tribe called Hy-Eathach of the Moy, seated to the west of that river, in the barony of Tirawley, in the county of Mayo, and that he was the father of,\n\n5. Eoghan Aidhne, i. e. Owen, or Eugenius of the territory of Aidhne, now comprised in the diocese of Kilmacduagh, in the south-west of the county of Galway; he was so called from his having been fostered in that territory by a tribe called Oga Beathra, who afterwards adopted him as their chief. Vide supra, p. 53. He had four sons, namely, 1, Conall; 2, Cormac; 3, Sedna; 4, Seanach Ceanngamhna, from whom sprung a sept called Cinel Cinngamhna, of whom the O'Duibhghiollas were the chiefs after the establishment of surnames in the eleventh century.\n\n6. Conall, son of Eoghan Aidhne. We are told nothing about him, except that he had one son, namely,\n\n7. Goibhnenn. He was chief of Hy-Fiachrach Aidhne, and in the year 531 fought the battle of Claonloch, in the territory of Kinelea, in which was slain Maine, son of Cerbhall,\n\np.374\n\nCerbhall, while defending the hostages of the Hy-Maine of Connaught. ( Annals of the Four Masters) He had one son,\n\n8. Cobhthach. He had three sons, namely, 1, Aodh, the ancestor of the tribe called Cinel Aodha na h-Echtghe, of whom the O'Cahills and O'Shaughnessys were the chiefs after the establishment of surnames; 2, Colman, the father of the celebrated Guaire Aidhne, King of Connaught, and ancestor of the families of O'Clery, O'Heyne, Mac Giolla Cheallaigh, now Kilkelly, and others; 3, Conall, the great grandfather of St. Colman, patron saint of Kilmacduagh, whose crozier and belt, ornamented with gold and gems, was in the possession of the O'Shaughnessy family in Colgan's time (1645).\n\n9. Aodh, son of Cobhthach. Of the generations from this Aodh down to Gealbhuide (No. 27 in the Genealogical Table) our annalists have preserved no notice.\n\nThe first notice of this family which occurs in the Irish annals is at the year 1159, in which it is recorded that Gealbhuidhe, the son of Seachnasach, was slain in the memorable battle of Ardee, fought between Muircheartach Mac Loughlin. head of the northern Hy-Niall, and Roderic O'Conor, King of Connaught. The following are all the notices of the O'Shaughnessys, O'Cahills, and their territory of Cinel Aodha, or Kinelea, preserved in the Annals of the Four Masters and Clonmacnoise, down to the year 1408.\n\nA. D. 1154. Toirdhealbhach O'Conor [King of Ireland] set out on a predatory excursion into Meath, but returned without a single cow, his son Maelseachlainn and Donnchadh O'Cathail [Donogh O'Cahill], lord of Cinel Aodha na h-Echtghe [Kinelea of Slieve Aughty], being killed. Four Masters.\n\nA.

John Cam O'Shaughnessy was slain by the son of O'Loughlin, in a game on the green of Clonrode. Four Masters.\n\nSeeing from these extracts (and we have no more), that it is now impossible to add dates to the pedigree of O'Shaughnessy given in the Genealogical Table, from Aodh, the ancestor of the Cinel Aodha, down to Sir Dermot, who was knighted in 1533 (No. 36 in the Genealogical Table), we must be content with illustrating this pedigree from this Sir Dermot down to the last acknowledged representative of the name, and adding a few observations to identify the present senior of the name.\n\n36. Sir Dermot O'Shaughnessy was the son of William, who was the son of John Buidhe, son of Eoghan, son of William, son of Giolla na naomh, son of Ruaidhri, son of Giolla na naomh Crom, lord of the western half of Kinelea, who died in 1224, son of Raghnall, or Randal, son of Gealbhuidhe, who was slain at the battle of Ardee in 1159, son of Seachnasach, the progenitor after whom this family took the name of Ui Seachnasaigh, i. e. descendants of Seachnasach, now generally anglicised O'Shaughnessy, and pronounced in the original territory O'Shannessy, and by some corruptly anglicised Sandys.\n\nThe first notice of this chieftain is found on Patent Roll, 3335, Henry VIII., from which it appears that the king, on the 9th of July, 1533, wrote to the Lord Deputy and Council of Ireland, saying, We have made the Lord of Upper Ossory, McNemarrowe, O'Shaftnes, Denys Grady and   Wise, Knyghtes; and woll that by virtue and warraunt hereof youe shall make out unto McNemarrowe, O'Shaftnes and Denys Grady, several patentes of all soche lands as they nowe have.\n\nBy Letters Patent, dated 3rd December, 35 Henry VIII., A. D. 1543, the king granted to Sir Dermot Sheaghyn [Sheaghynes], knight, captain of his nation, in consideration\n\np.376\n\nof his submission, and pursuant to the king's letter, dated the 9th of June preceding, All the manors, lordshipps, towns and town-lands of Gortynchegory, Dromneyll, Dellyncallan, Ballyhide, Monynean, Ardgossan, Ballyegyn, Kapparell, Clonehaghe, Tollenegan, Lycknegarishe, Crege, Karrynges, Tirrelagh, Rathvilledowne, Ardmylowan, one-third part of Droneskenan and Rath; the moiety of Flyngeston, Ardvillegoghe, Dromleballehue, Cowle, and Beke, which lands, it is recited, the said Sir Dermot and his ancestors had unjustly possessed against the Crown, to hold to him and his heirs male in capite, by the service of one Knight's fee, with a clause of forfeiture in case of confederacy against, or disturbance to the Crown. Inrolled on the Patent Roll of the thirty-fifth year of Henry VIII. Dorso.\n\nThis Sir Dermot married Mor Pheacach, i. e. More the Gaudy, O'Brien, who died in 1569, at an advanced age. Her death is thus recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters: A. D. 1569. Mor Pheacach (daughter of Brian, son of Tadhg, son of Toirdhealbhach, son of Brian of the Battle of Nenagh O'Brian) and wife of O'Shaughnessy (Diarmaid, son of William, son of John Buidhe), a woman celebrated for her beauty and munificence, died. By Mor Pheacach he had two sons, namely, Sir Roger, his successor, and Diarmaid, or Dermot Reagh, who went to England in his youth, and became servant or companion to the Earl of Leicester, as will presently be made appear from original documents.\n\n37. Sir Roger, son of Sir Dermot. This Sir Roger was generally called Giolla dubh, anglice Gilduff, or Gilliduff, i. e. juvenis niger, by the Irish, from his black complexion and the colour of his hair. He married the Lady Honora (daughter of Murrogh, first Earl of Thomond) who had been a professed nun and an abbess, by whom he had four sons, namely, 1, John, born four or five years before marriage, as were also two daughters, Joan and Margaret; and, 2, William; 3, Fergananim; and, 4, Dermot, who were all born in marriage. Sir Roger, who was called by the Irish Giolla dubh, died in the year 1569, as we learn from the Annals of the Four Masters, in which the following notice of his death is given: A. D. 1569. O'Shaughnessy (Giolla dubh, son of Diarmaid, who was son of William, who was son of John Buidhe), pillar of support to the English and Irish who had sought his assistance, and a man who, though not skilled in Latin or English, had been greatly valued and esteemed by the English, died. His son John assumed his place.\n\nAfter the death of Sir Roger, his brother, Diarmaid Riabhach, anglice Dermot Reagh, or Darby the Swarthy, O'Shaughnessy, who had been servant or companion to the Earl of Leicester, returned to Ireland, having first procured a letter from Queen Elizabeth to her Deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, of which the following is a faithful copy although, by some unaccountable mistake, he is in it called the son of William.\n\np.377\n\nBy the Queene.\n\nElizabeth R.\n\nRight trusty and welbeloved we grete you well.\n\nWher one Derby O'Shaghnes the youngest sonne, as he saith, of William O'Shaghnes, Lord of Kynally, in that our Realme of Ireland, hath by the meanes of his Lord and Master, our Coosen, the Erle of Leicester, humbly required us not onely to geve him leave to returne into his contry, but also to recomend his peticion unto yow for some order to be taken with hym upon the death of his brother named Roger O'Shaghnes as being next heire unto him, we being duely inforemed of his honest demeaner here and of his earnest desire to Serve us, have been content to accompt him to our Service, and do require yow to have favorable consideracion of his sute, and as you shall fynd it mete to place and settle him in the foresaid Contry, so the rather to incurrage him to persever in his fidelitie, to shewe him as muche favor as may accord with the good goverment of the same Contry.\n\nGiven under our Signet at our Mannor of Otelands,\n\nthe xxiiird of June, 1570, in the xiith yere of our Reigne.\n\nTo our right trusty and welbeloved Sir Henry Sidney,\n\nKnight, of our order of the Garter, and Deputy of\n\nour Realme of Irland.\n\nIt is very extraordinary, that in this letter Dermot Reagh is supposed to have been the son of William O'Shaughnessy, which he most unquestionably was not, for we have the testimony of the Irish Annals, and of his cotemporaries, that he was the brother of Sir Roger, as he states himself, and as such he was not the son but the grandson of a William O'Shaughnessy, for Sir Roger was the son of Sir Dermot, and grandson of William. It would appear from the following entry in the Annals of the Four Masters that this Derby or Dermot was made chief of his name in 1571:\n\nA. D. 1571. John, son of Gilla dubh, who was son of Diarmaid O'Shaughnessy, who had been the O'Shaughnessy from the time of the death of his father until this year, was deprived of that title, and also of Gort Insi Guaire, by his paternal uncle Diarmaid Riabhach, the son of Diarmaid, for he was virtually the senior.\n\nThis Dermot Riabhach, or Reagh, as we are informed by the Four Masters, continued to be the chief of the O'Shaughnessys until the year 1573, when he and Ulick, the son of Richard Burke, slew Morogh O'Brien (the son of Dermot, who was son of Morogh), in revenge for which John Burke deprived O'Shaughnessy of Gort Inse Guaire. But he held considerable sway in the territory till the year 1579, when he laid a snare for his nephew William, the second son of Sir Roger, near Ard Maoldubhain, on which occasion a fierce combat took place between them, in which he slew his nephew, but though\n\np.378\n\nhe did, he received such deep wounds himself that he died of them in less than an hour afterwards.\n\nAfter the death of Dermot Reagh, John O'Shaughnessy, the eldest son of Sir Roger, but who had been born before marriage, was again set up as the O'Shaughnessy, but his brother Dermot, who having been himself born in marriage, looked upon John as a bastard, made strong efforts to depose him; and John finding that the laws of England were in favour of Dermot, fortified himself against him by conveying all the lands in O'Shaughnessy's country to Sir Geffrie Fenton, for the sole consideration of Sir Geffrie maintaining his title against Dermot, who continually disturbed him in his possession. Both appeared at the parliament convened at Dublin in the year 1585, after which we have no more of John, or any of his descendants; but Sir Dermot appears to have been chief of his name till his death in 1606.\n\nThe following abstract of Depositions will throw much light upon the genealogy and rank of the O'Shaughnessy family at this period:\n\nAbstract of Depositions in a cause in the Chancery of Ireland, wherein Fulk Comerford was Plaintiff, and Roger O'Shaghnes of Gort-Inchigorye, in Galway Co., Defendant, touching the town and lands of Cappafennell, or Capperell, in that Co. A. D. 1615.\n\nDonnell O'Holloran of Gilloconry, in Galway County, husbandman, deposed that Sir Roger O'Shaghnes was son and heir of Sir Dermott that Sir Roger was married to Honora ny Brien, by whom he had four sons: 1, John, born about four or five years before marriage, as were also two daughters, Joan and Margaret; and, 2, William; 3, Fergananym; and, 4, Dermott, born in marriage that William was married, but died without male issue, and Fergananym died unmarried that John O'Shaghnes conveyed all the lands in O'Shaghnes' Country to Sir Geffrie Fenton, for the sole consideration of Sir Geffrie maintaining the title of John against Dermott that John was continually disturbed in his possession by Dermott, the Defendant's father that Dermott, after the death of his two brothers, and in the life-time of John, enjoyed the greatest part of the lands of which Sir Roger had died seised, and that John was always reputed to be a bastard that Sir Roger, the Defendant's grandfather, enjoyed these lands (viz. Cappafennell) and had tillage there, having had at one time fourteen score of reapers in harvest cutting, of whom Deponent was one.\n\nDepositions to the same effect were made by the following persons, viz.:\n\nKnougher Crone O'Hyne of Ledygane, gent., 100 years old and upwards.\n\nRichard Bourke of Rahaly, in Galway county, 64 years old or thereabouts, who\n\np.379\n\nadded, that he had seen an order of Council made by Sir Henry Sydney between Dermott and William, brother and son of Sir Roger, ordering that William should enjoy O'Shaghnes' lands to him and his heirs male, remainder to Dermott, Sir Roger's brother.\n\nMargaret Countess Dowager of Clanrickard, 80 years old and upwards, sister to Honora, wife of Sir Roger, who added that they were married by a dispensation from Rome.\n\nManus Ward Dean of Kilmackoweth [Kilmacduagh], 80 years old or thereabouts, who added that he knew of the controversy between Dermott and William O'Shaghnes, as above mentioned, wherein Dermott endeavoured to prove Sir Roger'"
