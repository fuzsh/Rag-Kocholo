        "text": "by Best Classic Bands Staff\n\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of Robert Smith getting serious about starting a band – and we’re certainly glad he did. The post-punk musician was part of many British school bands in the mid-70s, but just a few name changes and shifts in line-ups later, The Cure as we know it was officially born. To celebrate, the band will be playing 27 shows next year as part of an extensive North American tour, making their first appearances in some cities in nearly a decade.\n\nIn addition to Smith, Simon Gallup will be playing bass, Jason Cooper will man drums, Roger O’Donnell will play keys, and Reeves Gabrels will be on guitar, performing multiple decades’ worth of material, from hits to rarities and previously unreleased tracks. Critically acclaimed Scottish shoegaze band The Twilight Sad will be opening.\n\nTickets are available here.\n\nThe Cure 2016 North American Tour Dates:\n\n05/10 – New Orleans, LA – UNO Lakefront Arena\n\n05/11 – New Orleans, LA – UNO Lakefront Arena\n\n05/13 – Austin, TX @ Frank Erwin Center *\n\n05/14 – Houston, TX @ Toyota Center *\n\n05/15 – Dallas, TX @ American Airlines Center *\n\n05/17 – El Paso, TX @ Don Haskins Center *\n\n05/19 – Las Vegas, NV @ The Chelsea Theater at the Cosmopolitan *\n\n05/20 – Chula Vista, CA @ Sleep Train Amphitheater *\n\n05/22 – Los Angeles, CA @ Hollywood Bowl *\n\n05/23 – Los Angeles, CA @ Hollywood Bowl *\n\n05/24 – Los Angeles, CA @ Hollywood Bowl *\n\n05/26 – Mountain View, CA @ Shoreline Amphitheatre *\n\n05/28 – Ridgefield, WA @ Sunlight Supply Amphitheater\n\n05/29 – George, WA @ Sasquatch Music Festival\n\n05/31 – Burnaby, BC @ Festival Lawn at Deer Lake Park *\n\n06/02 – Boise, ID @ Century Link Arena\n\n06/03 – Salt Lake City, UT @ Maverik Center *\n\n06/05 – Denver, CO @ Fiddler’s Green Amphitheatre *\n\n06/07 – Mpls-St Paul, MN\n\n06/08 – Kansas City, MO @ Starlight Theatre *\n\n06/10 – Chicago, IL @ UIC Pavilion *\n\n06/11 – Chicago, IL @ UIC Pavilion *\n\n06/12 – Toronto, ON @ Bestival\n\n06/14 – Montreal, QC @ Bell Centre *\n\n06/16 – Boston, MA @ Boston University *\n\n06/18 – New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden *\n\n06/19 – New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden *\n\n06/20 – New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden *\n\n06/22 – Columbia, MD @ Merriweather Post Pavilion *\n\n06/24 – Atlanta, GA @ Aaron’s Amphitheater Lakewood *\n\n06/26 – Miami, FL @ Bayfront Park Amphitheater *\n\n06/27 – Miami, FL @ Bayfront Park Amphitheater *\n\n07/16 – Honolulu, HI @ Neal S Blaisdell Arena\n\n07/17 – Honolulu, HI @ Neal S Blaisdell Arena\n\n* = w/ The Twilight Sad"
