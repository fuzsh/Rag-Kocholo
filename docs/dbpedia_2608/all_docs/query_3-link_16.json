The O'Donnell clan originated from the Pagan High Kings of Ireland. (O'Domhnaill). Going back as far as 990 AD I have traced our origins through Niall of the Nine Hostages. and still investigating. I use the spelling of O'DONEL until 2nd Baronet Neal changes it to O'DONNELL when renouncing Catholism for expediency converting to Protestantism....On record are various spellings O'DONEL. O'DONNELL and the ancient O'DOMHNAILL. (Gaelic) Dill may be originally McDill and Scots??. or Dyll Germanic or Dutch for floorboard maker... The Scots/Irish held a strong Calvinistic work ethic and deep belief in Protestantism which was a democratically constructed church. Free Presbyterians would not kneel to the Catholic, Pope or hierarchy. As they were involved in the siege of Derry they must have immigrated prior to 1688. ... SPRINGFIELD RAMNEY FANAD, PARISH OF CLONDEVADDOCK, COUNTY DONEGAL (Both O'DONELS AND DILL GAMBLES FROM DONEGAL) but Gamble is a Scandinavian name originally and family stronghold in Ayrshire Scotland. Other versions are Gamel, Gemmell and all mean the original or old ones. NB: Extensive virtual video of renovated Springfield Property online as it is up for sale as at 10 February 2022. John ANDERSON DILL and brother Marcus ANDERSON DILL descendant from Rebecca ANDERSON and Francis DILL, had spawned a prominent family on the Springfield Estate consisting of some 300 acres, part of a land holding of over 1000 acres originally held by the Patton and Thompson families from Scotland. Mr Patton had determined to leave the district and offered the manor house and land at a moderate rent. Brothers John and Marcus ANDERSON DILL took up the lands in 1791 after rather younger Marcus had considered a life in the West Indies where cousin Caleb was determined to make his fortune but decadent way of life there did not ultimately appeal to a man brought up with his religious convictions. Together with their wives Susanna and Mary MCCLURE, sisters, daughters of a prominent local man Richard MCCLURE, the sturdy spacious Springfield Manor was converted into two apartments to accommodate their respective families. They were known as the Catholic Lands at that time. The Estate overlooked Lough Swilly, Mulroy Sound and the Atlantic from which a panoramic view was afforded from the steep hill behind the manor. Springfield was a botanist's delight with flowers and all kinds of flora adorning every nook and cranny. All manner of fruit and produce abounded on the fertile limestone and a long winding avenue lead up to the house and forming an arcade were elm trees intertwined all the way. Some of these trees remain today. see photo. Some outbuildings also remain as seen in video.... and a house built where the old stables used to be was occupied when the brothers DILL from USA journeyed back to the land of their forebears in the 1970's. See photos on this website. The estate consisted of a flax mill, several cottages, corn kilns. All that remains of the original house are some foundations and the kitchen well, after the walls were demolished in 1968. At the time of the American Dill brothers visit, the resident elderly Mrs Kerr was able to relate stories of when the manor house had been occupied by various tenants over a period of 300 years. Beginning with the Paton family and lately the Dill Family.. '5 children born to Anna Scott DILL and Mr William Errol GAMBLE, a Protestant Minister... One of who was my great grandfather Alexander DILL GAMBLE who travelled to Australia as a young man to Victoria, firstly to the goldfields, perhaps. Thence to the Warialda district. eventually as an overseer on several properties and eventually took possession of land in the Gullengutta, Ottley Creek area. He had cousins by the name of Dill Macky in the area.... Brothers Robert, William (see William Dill Gamble) travelled to USA as ministers and another brother John had died at sea at some point. A sister Anne Martha had become a missionary in Japan. Nothing more is known of her. Their mother (Anna Scott DILL) had died in Ireland around 1840. The children apparently then went to their grandfather John DILL, at Oakbank Ramelton. A delightful spot on Lough Swilly with tall oaks all around. The beautiful river Lanyan flowing in front. The house built from stones remaining from an old castle in Ramelton just an hour away from Springfield property. Alexander DILL GAMBLE named his property \"Oakbank\" on the Ottley River, Warialda district. Later known as Girraween. Annie SCOTT DILL MAUNDER nee RUSSELL A prominent Irish astronomer and from whom a moon's crater is named Maunder. She was 4th cousin of Anna Scott Dill who married William Errol Gamble, my great x 3 grandfather.. see source and photo. Alexander DILL GAMBLE trained in the ministry but did not take up that vocation, nevertheless read Bible daily to his children. The children were tutored by a Julius SPeers son of a German immigrant Alfred Speers, who later married Clara Gamble. my great aunt... Julius's senior University examinations published in newspapers in 1893. AMERICAN BRANCH DILL GAMBLE FAMILY Alexander', mu great grandfather's brother William DILL GAMBLE III born in 1830 in Ramelton County Donegal. He went to New York at 19 but did not succeed there. He married a Seraphina MILLER daughter of Reverend Samuel Miller and they lived for a time in Paris France where Seraphina studied art. William Thomas and Anna were born there in 1875 and 1877 respectively. Wanting the children to be educated in the US. they eventually settled in York area Pennsylvania in 1881, where Seraphina was born... THey bought a substantial property at 58 Cottage Street York. {see photo.} Another brother Samuel, had died at 28, as a result of exposure to toxins whilst working as a druggist and apothecary... see also ANNA DILL GAMBLE. ANNA DILL (MILLER) GAMBLE remained single all her life. Converted to Catholicism in her forties along with her mother Seraphina (Phenie) . She wrote a book called \"Road to Rome.\" about her conversion... A prominent womens rights activist, world peace ambassador and author,. . Spent her last years in the family mansion on cnr South Duke and Cottage Street, York Pennsylvania which had become a care home for the elderly single women. Anna was a leading authority of her time with her activism, campaigning for world peace. Her garden scheme which was to produce food for the military. She was the author of many books and articles and an articulate persuasive speaker. Both she and her mother were members of the Daughters of the Revolution. A scholarship scheme which is active today for young female students, was set up by her and a colleague. see photos. She also left $5000 to the Catholic Church. What a turnaround having come from a long line of Protestants.. WILLIAM DILL GAMBLE 111 In 1858 Reverend William Dill GAMBLE travelled to China as a missionary in Ningbo and later to Shanghai and had invented the \"Gamble Character\" a Chinese language symbol with his printing press. With his invention and innovation he was able to translate from English to Chinese many writings on Mathematics, Medicine, Astronomy, Botany and Scriptures. He produced the first Chinese bibles with paper and silk. However he worked to produce copies of the Bible very cheaply for anyone to have access. sold at 15 cents and in a condensed version. He remained in China until 1870 and then travelled to Japan to teach the skills he had learned in China. He died of pulmonary disease as a result of his time in Japan, May 18th 1876. His obituary was published in the York Daily a few days later. In 1938 his son Rev William Thomas (MILLER) GAMBLE along with his sister Anna donated the Gamble print collection to The Washington Library of Congress where they reside in the Asian section to this day. Collection consisting of Chinese and English volumes, translations on the abovementioned subjects. Their father Reverend William DILL GAMBLE had become a printer of American Presbyterian Mission Press as mentioned above and an innovator of the Chinese character printing press which unlike our 26 letter alphabet, 10 numerals and few punctuation marks, using a basic 900 separate characters, rather like hieroglyphs. see photos. AUSTRALIAN DILL GAMBLE FAMILY The name Gamble has variations such as Gambell, Gammel and Gamel and is of Danish Norwegian origins. The meaning being \"the old or original ones\" .....However our more recent Gamble family emanated from Scotland, \"Saltcoats\" in Ayrshire and were free Presbyterians. There being a large enclave there. At some point fleeing to Rathmelton (Ramelton) in Donegal in the north of Ireland where they may have been offered land to cultivate. Alexander DILL GAMBLE came from Oak Bank in Ramelton County Donegal Ireland. The name of Oak Bank no longer exists in Ramelton except as a hospital. In later years, Alexander \"Alick\" was superintendent on \"Petrea\" part of the Ottley Creek group of properties. He was dummy bidder for G H Gordon but had snaffled some property for himself causing enmity but needs must in those precarious days. Fanny COLLINS O'DONNELL and Alexander DILL GAMBLE's family included 13 children, the youngest of which was my grandmother Rachael, who lost her mother shortly after due to childbirth complications April 25 1884. Alexander Dill Gamble's cousin by the name of Dill Macky had been preaching in Tamworth, Julius Steinheimer SPEERS, son of ALFRED SPEERS had converted and later married Clara Gamble, my great aunt. He had been for a time tutor to the Gamble children. Clara and Rachael being the only daughters to have married and have children out of six daughters. Anne Fanny \"Fan\" and Catherine \"Kit\" remained unmarried, Fan had lost her fiance due to a horse accident on way to a dance, whilst Caroline \"Dollie\" died with severe mental disability and blindness was committed to an asylum.. Matilda \"Jessie\" had died of burns complications at Warialda Hospital, unmarried at 17. Jessie had given birth to son Eber out of wedlock at 14. Who was the father?????? Eber died of croup as an infant. Alexander (Alick) DILL GAMBLE died in 1908 at \"Bonny Doon\" 43 Urabatta Street, Inverell NSW after a stroke which had left him semi paralysed. He, having far outlived his wife Fanny had never remarried. In the first years of marriage the family lived in tents but Alexander Dill Gamble died his thirty thousand pound estate was divided up between his surviving children. Two of his children had met untimely deaths due to accidents on the property including Rowland who was kicked by a horse when brandishing a stick, at 9 years old. The eldest Anne Fanny \"Fan\" inherited 50% of the total estate when land and assets were sold off to liquidate for probate including Oakbank property, lately called Girrawheen on Ottley Creek near Warialda. She had become the head matriarch of the household after her mother died. The three sisters, \"Fan\" and \"Kit\" along with Rachael \"Rae\" owned both houses in Urabatta Street Inverell, \"Oakbank on the corner and \"Bonny Doon\" next door.. Rachel ahd died there where her four children including my mother Doris Valmai \"Val\" ,had been born and raised. In January 1930 she succumbed to cancer at age 45... Her husband, my grandfather Ernest George Perfrement Denshire, never remarried. RACHEL DENSHIRE NEE GAMBLE Rachael the youngest, had attended NEGGS in Armidale from 12-17 years, the only child to receive a formal education and was a founding member of that school. Rachael had no doubt helped nurse her father at Bonny Doon when he became incapacitated with a stroke and eventually died in 1908. In 1912 she married Ernest Perfrement Denshire and they lived at Bonny Doon. Rachael was a prominent and popular member of her community and was sadly missed when she died of breast cancer complications in January 1930.. A founding member of the CWA in Warialda and other organisations, she and her husband Ernest Perfrement DENSHIRE were well known and he the Mayor of Inverell at one time and ran a stock and station agency. He was a keen arborist and gardener and had planted trees along the road and in the park area. O'DONEL O'DONNELL OF NEWPORT HOUSE COUNTY MAYO BARONETCY Rory (Roger) O'Donnell of Lifford Castle 7 x great grandfather was first to be transplanted to Claggan Ballycroy in Mayo 1654 from Ulster in Donegal. Not welcome amongst the locals, had a strong northern dialect. Known as Claggan O'Donnell. The family subsequently intermarried amongst themselves. Said to be bad tempered but hospitable, intelligent and resourceful.. Rory had helped transport 2000 people from Donegal down to Mayo when the Irish lost the battle against Cromwell outside Letterkenny. They also settled on Achill Island which the family owned and had large houses in Melcombe area. Rory was cousin to famous Red Hugh O'Donel. and descended from the pagan Irish kings... see pic. His son Magnus \"Maney\" O'Donnell 6 x great grandfather born 1600-1646 was a colonel in the Williamite army. His third son Hugh Mor built Newport House now a luxury hotel. see pic...Had a farm at Melcombe Newport after the family moved to Newport in County Mayo in 1760. They had owned Achill Island and neighbouring small island as well as large land holdings. HIs son Hugh Mor O'Donnell 5 x great grandfather. built Newport House in County Mayo. Son of Hugh Mor O'Donnell 5 x great grandfather 1sT BARONET NEALE BROWN O'DONNELL see image 4 x great grandfather 1750 -1811 with grandchildren Bought huge tracts of land in the Abbey of Cong 1780 for 20,000 pounds. Barony of Erris, 30,000 acres, the Manor of Burrishoole from the Medlycotts 1781 for 30,000 pounds. This is equivalent to over 8 million pounds today. By 1785 became the main landowner in Mayo. Had converted to Protestantism to pave the way for his future when his income was at least eight thousand pounds a year. Fosterage was a way of life in the west and he was brought up in a lowly house in Ballycroy as were his sons. Sir Neale was a keen horse owner and bought the stud of the Earl of Altmont. All his horses paid for themselves within the 1st year with winning of the \"Plates\". His main source of income was the smuggling of wine and tobacco from Cadiz Spain. One of his ships being the \"Paddy Wheack\", a cutter used to bring the contraband up his Newport River on which the property was built.... His customers were sold only the best of clarets and brandies. Revenue officials had stormed his property and seized hogsheads of wine in 1790. Neale retaliated by suing the Crown for trespass, damage and won his case, being awarded 1500 pounds in damages plus costs!! By 1800 his estimated annual income was above 8000 pounds. For 200 years Newport country estate with vast lands was home to the branch of the O'Donel family. They had extensive holdings around Mayo and several residences in Dublin. Seen as the Anglo/Irish aristocracy of the area. Descended from the fighting earls of Tyr Connell. Cousins of the famous Red Hugh of Irish legend. They were transplanted from Ulster to Mayo in Connacht by Oliver Cromwell. Wholesale clearances of the population had occurred at the defeat near Letterkenny in 1650. They first moved to Ballycroy, Achill Island and then to Newport in County Mayo Connaught Province, A linen industry was established originally by Quakers who found the territory difficult to exist in and moved out. A large contingent of French Huguenots were weavers of the flax. Neale Browne O'Donel was sympathetic to the Catholic cause and would shelter priests in time of need. He had died in 1763 and third son Neal Coane O'Donel, converted to the Church of Ireland before he became 1ST baronet of Newport 22nd December 1780. He amassed great wealth in some measure through smuggling activities to and from Spain. Documents mentioning wine and tobacco coming in and prosecution threatened. He may have had contacts through distant cousins of Red Hugh O'Donnell who died in Spain after the flight of the earls to Spain because of religious persecution. He donated a free site for the Catholic Church at Newport so held no prejudice even though he was now \"Protestant\" . Just lip service and expediency in the conversion. The name was changed from O'Donel to O'Donnell around 1780 within the first baronetcy in Newport County Mayo when Church of Ireland (Protestant) embraced. NEAL (NIALL ) (BEAG) COANE O'DONNELL l 2nd baronet and died in 1827. my 4 x greatgrandfather. Father of NEAL CONNELL or CONNELL NEAL ANNESLEY O'DONNELL Hugh James Moore Annesley O'Donnell 3RD BARONET who died in a shooting accident at home at 22 in 1828, leaving a wife Anabella Blake pregnant with his daughter. So no male heir there.... Younger brother, next in line, Richard Annesley O'Donnell became the 4th baronet and died in 1878 in England where his mother also died, Dorset UK. They may have had some property holdings there...They were Anglo/Irish. Richard's son George Clendinning O'Donnell died without male heir and thus ended the 5th baronetcy. His younger son Richard also died without issue.. End of that branch of the family line there as well as early death of Hugh Moore. Richard's older brother. This meant that potentially my great grandfather Neal was in line to inherit. Contrary to some supposition, the name Neal or Neil is from the old Irish \"Niall\" and not short for Cornelius. Tthe family had enormous holdings all over north of Ireland including Achill Island, some 57 square miles. Along with Innisbiggin island nearby. Estates in Cong Kilmaine, Erris and Tarmon. Newport lands in Burrishoole were 70.000 acres. The land at Newport County Mayo was mostly arable but suitable for potatoes and linen. Also lands in Tipperary, Kilkenny and Waterford were held. The original O'Donel, Hugh Mor had come to Mayo after Cromwell defeated the Irish outside Letterkenny in 1690 came first to Craggan Ballycroy, and Achill Island and thence to Newport County Mayo (Province of Connaught). He constructed Newport House in Mayo, now a luxury hotel. see pic. The change in fortunes over time due to decline in agricultural prices following the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Decline of the linen industry made tenant farmers fall behind with rental monies. The decrease in income further complicated by increased debts due to annuities and marriage settlements. Including 5 widows and 2 daughters of deceased O'Donel heirs. The great famine of 1845-7 which ended with sales of large tracts of land. Sir Richard Annesley O'Donnell, 4th baronet and older brother to our Neal, gave two acres of land rent free for a Catholic school in 1852. He also placed the Catharch relic in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin. Richard sold off 7,770 acres of the Cong estate to Sir Benjamin Guinness in 1856. in 1876 it was recorded that Richard and son George still held 7,500 acres of land. Achill Island land was largely bought by the Achill Mission in 1850 due financial stresses. AUSTRALIAN LEAF OF THE SHAMROCK NEAL CONNELL or CONNELL NEAL ANNESLEY O'DONNELL 2 X GREAT GRANDFATHER HIGHWAY ROBBER TRANSPORTED TO NEW SOUTH WALES The third son of 10 children including 7 sisters,??? Maria, Mary, Kitty, Margaret, Isabella?? Bridget?? in 1833 stole monies, 10 pounds, , an umbrella which was givn back, a silver watch from an Englishman he waylaid on a bridge in Dublin, along with two cohorts, using pistols. Some say that he stole rent monies collected from his family properties in Dublin.????,It was known they owned at townhouse at 7 Ely Place, Dublin. see pic. .His brother and then heir, Richard had cut off his allowance declaring him a wastrel and a gambler. Neal was attending Trinity Law School in Dublin and was under the tutelage of Reverend A Bullock where he attained a BA in 1832 according to Rae Black, great x 4 granddaughter .of Neil Neal O'Donnell and Caroline Collins... Why did he not gain employment with a law firm of some sort? Instead he was living on the streets, in cheap lodgings, of Dublin... Neal, along with two others, Little and McGhee, was subsequently tried in a Dublin court after a 10 pound note was used to purchase clothing by John McGhee for a shawl for his daughter. When change was sought elsewhere for the 10 shillings he spent,it was stopped. Perhaps an alert had been made of the robbery in the local area and the number on the ten pound note, circulated??. John McGhee came out with Neil/ Neal on the Royal Sovereign to the colonies. Richard O'Donnell, his brother, and heir to the estate was a sheriff in the county at the time Neal was sent to the colonies, marked as a highway robber with a sentence commuted from death to life in NSW where he was sent to Port Macquarie as a sawyer.. He later was in Armidale hospital and died there as a result of an accident at 43 after being warned by his wife not to do what it was that caused his demise..... .. He had married Caroline Collins who came out as companion to a family and was daughter of John Collins, a merchant at Spitalfields in London. After gaining a ticket of leave early due to magistrate hearing his story and was sympathetic Neil married Caroline Collins.... They had 9 children. William who died as an infant, and twin Sarah, Elizabeth, Fanny, my great grandmother, Neil, Anna Maria and others. Neal had been transported on the \"Royal Sovereign\" late 1833, along with his cohorts, John McGhee, arrived January 1834 to go to Port Macquarie. Richard Annesley O'Donnell, 3rd baronet from back in Ireland had apparently kept tabs on the family in New South Wales mainly to make sure Neil was never in line for the inheritance at family property at Newport County Mayo..... It was said of Richard by Neal, that \"he would spend sixpence to hang me, but not a penny to save me\" when Neal's wife Caroline exhorted him to stay in touch with the family back in Ireland. Whether he was in touch with any of his sisters is not known. Neal remained largely itinerant with no ownership of land or house as mentioned... He went to work with the Nivisons at Walcha and moved from property to property under the service of the of the government as a sawyer before receiving the full pardon with the aid of a friend Phillip Ditman of \"Clairvaulx\". His twin boy William died as an infant and sister Sarah survived to later make attempt for claim on the estate in Ireland. Little did she know the estate was bankrupt and only a millstone around the neck of anyone in possession. His admission, treatment and death records page had been torn from the hospital records apparently by someone in the pay of Richard O'Donnell back in Ireland or his contacts???. There is some information stating it may have been an orderly at the hospital under instruction. Richard had kept tabs on Neal in the colonies it was stated and no doubt to make sure he had no chance of inheriting the family estates s there were no survivng male heirs of Richard and hence Neal would have been in line to inherit... Ironic as the estate was in huge debt and could not have been maintained by him in any event... CLAIM TO THE ESTATE Connell \"Neal\" Annesley O'DONNELL's surviving son Neil Collins O'Donnell, at the behest of his sister Sarah Catherine Hamilton who with sister Elizabeth (Bessie) looked up Burkes Peerage and subsequently had decided to make claim to the estate back in Ireland. Mentioned in the Illustrated Sydney News that they were to sail to Ireland to make claim on the Newport Estate after the last and 5th baronet George Clendinning O'Donnell had died without male issue. This came about because Sarah Catherine Hamilton nee O'Donnell sold newspapers in Melbourne and came across a paragraph in a news journal pertaining to the Newport House County Mayo estate. A death certificate for Neal could not be secured to prove that his son Neil was last potential heir of Newport House Estate and the claim was not successful and the trip to Ireland I doubt even eventuated.. The case strongly defended by Milicent Agnes O'Donnell, granddaughter of Sir Richard Annesley O'Donnell. She inherited nothing but debts. Neil Collins O'Donnell waiting for word about his claim to the baronetcy whilst he was odd jobbing in Walcha and joking in the local bars about being \"Sir\" Neil but of unstable mind due to alcoholism and the prospect of a fortune come so late in his life, must have further unhinged him. He was more than once arrested and detained for being of \"unsound mind\". He died at 54 not married and with no progeny. So ended that branch of the Irish tree and an offshoot continues now in Spain. Richard Annesley O'Donnell as it happens far outlived younger exiled brother Neal. He had two sons Richard and George Clendinning O'Donnell by Mary Clendinning. George, the elder, inherited the last baronetcy which became dormant at his death with no male issue. The estate was in the main bankrupt with huge debts by that time and only a few acres remain with Newport House now a luxury hotel in County Mayo, Connaught. AUSTRALIAN LEAF OF THE SHAMROCK Caroline Collins, arrived aboard \"Amelia Thompson.\" as a ladies' companion. Caroline's parents Catherine Adair, a milliner and John Collins from Spitalfields area London where he worked as a feather/leather merchant. Spitalfields a very large horticultural wholesale market north of the river where fruit, flowers and vegetables were sold. Caroline O'Donnell nee Collins widowed from Neal's untimely death at 45 and with 8 surviving children, remarried to John O'BRIEN in 1857, a baker at Glen Innes and Armidale. Having a further 4 children. Altogether a mother of 13 children. She lived to a ripe old age... THE DUKES OF TETUAN SPAIN Leopoldo O'Donnell Y Yorris Prime Minister of Spain during Isabella's reign 1856-1866 three times. Grandee of Spain, count of Lucena, Viscount of Buckfast. Spanish general and stateman descendant from Calvagh my 15 x great grandfather through Carlos O'Donnell y Anethan and Josefa Yorris y Casaviella. Born in Tenerife Canary Islands. THE CATHARCH SEE PICS Latin version of Hebrew Psalms of Old Testament. Earliest example of Irish writing in existence. Oldest ecclesiastical Irish manuscript. St Colum Cille copied it from original belonging to St Finnian who objected to the translation and wanted it. A case of copyright dispute of a sort. The judgement of the High King of Ireland in favour of Finnian caused anger and Colum Cille rallied his northern forces again the King in County Sligo. in AD 561. The Catharch remained in Donegal guarded by the O'Donels, Colum Cille's kinsmen. ANCIENT IRELAND Clann Dalaigh O'Donel The surname ODomnaill later to be O'Donnell, O'Donel, has been in use for over 1000 years from some time after surnames were being used in Ireland. Cathbarr O'Domnaill was one of the first to use a surname in Donegal. In looking for a surname to use the Irish looked to an ancestor held in high regard. If it was their father then \"Mac\" was used and if someone from a previous generation then \"Üa\" meaning grandson, or \"Ö\"\". \"Fitz\" came to mean illegitimate. Cathbarr took the name of his grandfather Domnaill a king of Cenel Conaill. His father was Dalach and the name Clann Dalaigh or Sil Dalaigh often used to describe the O''Donnells, derives from him. Whilst the O'Donnells are a leading family in the history of Donegal they controlled Tir Chonaill, (Tyrconnell) for only four centuries. From 1201-1500's. The first O'Donel chief was inaugurated in 1200. the first of 25 chieftains. The last being Niall Garbh in 1603 from whom I directly descend. A notable chieftain had built a castle in Ballyshannon to secure his southern borders. IN the early 1470's Hugh ODomnaill (O'Donel) built both Donegal Castle and Donegal Abbey, the latter for the Franciscan order. see pics. NIALL GARBH O'DONNELL 24th successor and ancestor of the Newport O'Donnells was inaugurated in 1603 at Kilmacrennan where huge areas were owned. One such property was Castle Fin in Donegal. The sons always took a prominent role in leading their clans in battle. So Niall and his two brothers are frequently mentioned in the annals of The Four Masters from 1395-to 1422. Four of Niall's sons settled in County Meath and four held sway over territories in Ulster. The greatest number of Irish kings wer descended from these two terrorities. His descendants ruled for six hundred years and he united much of Northern Ireland. Married to his cousin Nuala McDonnell O'Donnell. Her brother was Rory (Rudraigh) (Roderick) and Red Hugh, of the Flight of the Earls fame. RED HUGH O'DONNELL (Prince of Donegal legend) from whose life the Disney film was made. Sent as a boy by mother Finola McDonald, (Ineen dubh) a Hebridean Scot. to the McSWeeneys at Doe Castle to learn arts, literature, swordsmanship, and all manner of education befitting a Prince of his station. Perhaps the most famous of the O'Donnells he was inaugurated in 1592 the last attempt by the clan to preserve the Gaelic order in the north west of Ireland. The rebellion against the English ended in defeat at the Battle of Kinsale in 1601. Previously he was kidnapped in 1587 along with three companions from Sweeney and Gallagher families. They were out riding near Rathmullan and were enticed aboard a ship pretending to be Spanish, along with the other boys, plied with white wine and in the captain's cabin and with English soldiers appearing, clapped in irons and taken as hostages to Dublin Castle. The kidnapping carried out to ensure that the O'Donnells would comply with English rule. Badly treated and lanquishing for six years but A ransom of 300,000 euros today, was offered by the O'Donnells and mother of Red Hugh had offered up 25 spaniards she had been harbouring which was accepted but the hapless Spaniards were beheaded and the deal was not honoured. Red Hugh made good his escape at the second attempt in 1592 and with the aid of his ally Hugh O'Neill and his cohorts the two O'Neill boys sought refuge with an ally along the way but in the dead of winter on the Wicklow Mountains the O'Neill boys die of exposure and after Red Hugh made his way to his father's castle, at Ballyshannon, where he had several toes amputated because of frost bite. The escape was made through a sewer system with allies from the outside. His hatred of the English for his treatment in prison never abated and they paid dearly in the coming years. In Ulster in 1592 he was inaugurated at a ceremony at the Rock of Doone. In 1595 he killed all those not speaking Irish and above 15 years of age. He had died in Simancas Castle Vallodolid in Spain a year later. It is stated that he may well have been poisoned by the English double agent, Blake, after the flight to Catholic Europe under the auspices of Philip 3rd of Spain with whom they had a strong alliance. His brother Rory became Earl of Tyr Connell (Tir Connaill) who had left Ireland with the Flight of the Earls in 1607 along with other family members including brother Cathbarr and Nuala ODonnell. Bringing an end to the O'Donnell rule in Donegal. They had been dispossessed by the English and their Irish Allies but had planned to regroup and make challenge to the situation again back in Ireland. This didnt happen due to illness, disease and deprivation in Europe. NIALL NORDIALLACH (of the Nine Hostages) Great grandfather of St Columba, one of the Apostles of Ireland with whom the ancient relic the Catharch is connected. See pic. On the Green of Tara (Temair) site of the ancient kings of Ireland, see pic. Caireen or Karen brought forth a son after hard labour that her jealous rival Mong Fionn had subjected her to, in the hopes she would miscarry. Caireen had left her babe exposed to the elements to perish such was her fear of Mong Fion. Caireen was the concubine and slave of Echoid Mugmedon, a captured daughter of an English King of Munster. The poet Torna had rescued the babe named Niall and as a young man went to Tara to save his mother from enslavement and to don the purple raiment of kingship. Mong Fionn was to decide who would be the successor to the throne of Tara and all five sons of Echoid were given a task to perform to prove his mettle. Niall had triumphed it seemed and he was to seize sway of Erin and Alba. He had a hostage from each province throughout the land and four from Alba. Four of his sons settled in County Meath and four others had territories in Ulster. The greatest number of Irish kings were from these two areas. Niall, son of Echoid and Cairenn had made forays into Britain and France and controlled much of the Roman Britain. His descendants ruled for 600 years and he united much of Northern Ireland. Niall received the district from Swilly to Dore as his patrimony. His son Leary McNiall Mugmedon succeed him in 428 and during that five year reign St Patrick had come to Ireland on a mission. He died the second time he invaded Leinster in 463. Niall's nephew Dathi ODonnell, succeeded him and during a foray was killed by flash lightning in the Alps. He was conveyed home and his gravestone still stands. Niall Nordiallach's descendants lived in Rathmelton or Ramelton, co-incidentally where Alexander Dill Gamble was born. Later on Kilmacrenna was chosen as their place of inauguration. O'DONNELL (ODOMNAILL) CLANN DALAIGH The O'Donnells of Newport descended from Conal Bulban, one of the sons of Niall Nordiallach Mugmedon, of the Nine Hostages. A prominent ruthless king of Ireland from whom at least three million men are descended, around the globe, according to DNA evidence. Along with his two brothers, Eoin and Eanna, Conal divided the area of the county amongst themselves. South and west went to Conal which became Connaill. They had brought Christianity to the region and were acquainted with St Patrick. ODomnaill later to be anglocised to O'Donnell meant \"Mighty in the world\" or indomitable.
