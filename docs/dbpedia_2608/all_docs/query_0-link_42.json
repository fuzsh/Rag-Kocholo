        "text": "The Cure emerged in the late 1970s with frontman Robert Smith (vocals, guitar), Michael Dempsey (bass), and Laurence \"Lol\" Tolhurst (drums) - originally calling themselves 'Easy Cure.' Only Smith has made it as a Cure member into the 1990s. Yet, through all the band configurations, the music has remained impressive and the Cure have made alternative history. Since the conception of the Cure, many bands have come and gone claiming to be the best representative of modern rock music. Only the Cure have maintained a consistent edge, never forgetting their alternative roots or their title, \"godfathers of goth.\" But Smith says the band isn't goth: \"The goth scene has never been a part of the Cure. There are no photos of the Cure as a goth group, with crucifixes and face paint. It's a media myth, and if you ask anybody in the goth scene, they'll tell you we're not a goth band. It's pure laziness on the media's part to lump us in with other bands that have that look\" (1997). Today, the Cure consists of Robert Smith on vocals, guitars and keyboards, Simon Gallup on bass, Perry Bamonte on guitars and keyboards, Jason Cooper on drums, and Roger O'Donnell on keyboards.\n\nRobert Smith began his musical journey in the early 70s when he received a guitar for Christmas and began playing cover tunes with his friends, Lawrence Tolhurst and Michael Dempsey. The trio originally called themselves the Obelisks and then Malice after a few years.\n\nThe name Easy Cure was used and Smith shortened the name to the Cure because the original name sounded too \"hippyish and American west coast.\"\n\nThe band fit \"the look\" for the post-punk alternative scene, and the band became known for their lyrics of despair and bantering riffs. The Cure signed with Fiction Records after recording a demo for \"Killing An Arab.\"\n\nThe Cure recorded their first LP in two days and had their first success in England with the release of their debut LP, Three Imaginary Boys (similar to Boys Don't Cry).\n\nThe Cure toured with Siouxsie & The Banshees. Smith filled in as guitarist for numerous shows when a few band members left the Banshees.\n\nAs bands came and went away during the 1980s, The Cure continued their success, seldom venturing far from what their fans demanded in their music. Michael Dempsey left the band because of musical differences, was replaced with Simon Gallup.\n\nBoys Don't Cry was released - a re-sequenced US version of Three Imaginary Boys.\n\nMatthieu Hartley (keyboards) joined the group and the band released, Seventeen Seconds. Hartley later left the group after touring.\n\nFaith was released and the singles \"Primary\" and \"Charlotte Sometimes\" hit the radio airwaves.\n\nThe Cure's fourth LP, Pornography was released and Simon Gallup quit the band. \"Let's Go To Bed\" and \"The Walk\" were both hits in native England.\n\nSmith returned to playing with Siouxsie & The Banshees for a bit, but soon re-focused on the efforts of the Cure again.\n\nA side project called \"The Glove\" was developed involving Smith, a member of the Banshees, and a female vocalist, and an LP called \"Blue Sunshine\" was released.\n\nJapanese Whispers was released and by 1983 the Cure consisted of Smith, Tolhurst, Andy Anderson (drummer) and Phil Thornalley (bassist).\n\nThe Top was released.\n\nA live LP, Concert: Live 1984 was released.\n\nThe Cure's configuration continued to change and by '85, Anderson was fired due to alcohol problems and temperament, and Thornalley left the band. Gallup returned to the band, and Boris Williams (drummer) and Porl Thompson (guitarist) were added.\n\nThe band released The Head On The Door. The LP began to reveal more success in the U.S. than previous LPs, and singles such as \"Close To Me\" and \"In Between Days\" began to find success on college radio stations.\n\nA compilation of the Cure's work was released - Staring At The Sea - The Singles.\n\nStaring At The Sea - The Singles went gold and eventually 2x platinum, and established the band as a major alternative act in the U.S.\n\n# 138 Singles Artist of the Year\n\nThe Cure released their double LP, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me and the band began to have airplay on alternative, rock, and even pop stations, as well as MTV coverage. The LP contained the hits \"Why Can't I Have You\" and \"Hot Hot Hot\" as well as their first Top 40 hit \"Just Like Heaven.\"\n\n# 33 Singles Artist of the Year\n\nThe Cure released their eighth LP, Disintegration and had their first Top 10 pop hit: \"Love Song.\" Additional hits included \"Lullaby,\" \"Pictures Of You,\" and \"Fascination Street.\" Smith said of Disintegration: \"Disintegration will probably always be my favorite Cure album, because of the way it's made and especially what it means to me. I think there's only a couple of times ever in an artist's career where you reach a point where you think, 'That's perfect. I couldn't do that any better.' Disintegration is one of those albums.\"\n\nThe Cure embarked on a world tour to support the LP and later released live performances of the tour with Entreat in England.\n\nThe Cure hit the Top 40 with \"Fascination Street.\"\n\nThe Cure hit the Top 40 with \"Love Song.\"\n\nThe Cure was nominated for a MTV Video Music Award for Best Post Modern Video (\"Fascination Street\").\n\nThe Cure hit the Top 10 with \"Love Song.\"\n\nTolhurst was fired from the band and replaced with former Psychedelic Furs keyboardist Roger O'Donnell. Tolhurst was removed from the band because of alcohol problems and lack of contribution (a suit by Tolhurst against the Cure was later lost in court).\n\nThe Cure released an LP of remixes, Mixed Up.\n\n# 45 Singles Artist of the Year\n\nO'Donnell left the group and was replaced by Perry Bamonte.\n\nThe Cure released The Top 5 LP, Wish and had their second Top 10 pop hit, \"Friday I'm In Love.\" The LP was hailed as possibly the best Cure LP yet and included the hits \"High\" and \"A Letter To Elise.\"\n\nThe Cure hit the Top 40 with \"High.\"\n\nThe Cure topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for 4 weeks with \"High.\"\n\nThe Cure hit the Top 40 with \"Friday I'm In Love.\"\n\nThe Cure topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for 4 weeks with \"Friday I'm In Love.\"\n\nThe Cure were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance (Wish).\n\nThe Cure released the live LP Show and the EP Side Show - recorded live in Detroit, Michigan.

Royalties from the LPs went to the International Red Cross Fund.\n\nThe Cure covered Jimi Hendrix's \"Purple Haze\" for a compilation tribute LP, Stone Free: A Tribute To Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThe same year Thompson left the band and O'Donnell returned.

He recently stated \" I decided in 1983 that walking into the millennium I should be doing something new. I don't want to drag it out any longer than that. For me, The Cure means something special, it means ... well, it means something anyway. I'd like to leave it at that.\"\n\nTwo members of the Cure (Robert Smith, Jason Cooper) along with Reeves Gabrels (from Tin Machine) joined forces as COGASM for a song \"A Sign From God\" that appeared on the soundtrack Orgazmo.\n\nThe Cure could be heard on the Depeche Mode tribute LP, For The Masses, with their version of \"World In My Eyes\" and on the soundtrack for X-Files: The Album with \"More Than This.\"\n\nA Cure fan was awarded $75,000 for an autograph-seeking 1996 incident that resulted in his injuries and a subsequent lawsuit. The band failed to respond to the lawsuit resulting in a default judgement for the fan.\n\nThe Cure was in stores with new material with the LP, Bloodflowers and also recorded a segment of Hard Rock Live for VH1. The band did some touring in Europe and the U.S.\n\nRobert Smith was still questioning whether or not their latest LP Bloodflowers will be the band's last LP. (\"Maybe Someday\" is) the only song on the album that's really about the end of the band... people are interpreting a lot of the songs on the record as being about that, but they're not.\"\n\nA remix of the track \"Watching Me Fall\" appeared on the soundtrack to American Psycho.\n\nThe Cure began touring starting in Georgia with the \"Dream Tour 2000.\" Rumors that The Cure will break up after their 'Dream Tour 2000' began to circulate again, this time fueled by reports that frontman Robert Smith is working on a solo LP (\"It's not the kind of album that'll be played a lot on radio\"). Smith also said after the solo LP is released he'll take some time off instead of touring. Smith also talked about the track \"Maybe Someday\" as being an indication of the band's breakup: \"That's the 1 song on the album abut ending the Cure. As soon as the others heard that one, their faces dropped. This is our swan song.\"\n\nThe Cure cancelled their performance at Denmark's Roskilde Festival out of respect for the 9 who died earlier in the festival.\n\nThe Cure were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance (Bloodflowers).\n\nGalore was certified gold.\n\nThe Cure released another hits compilation - Greatest Hits (with 2 new tracks).\n\nRolling Stone: The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: # 326: Disintegration, # 442: Boys Don't Cry.\n\nThe Cure released the box set Join The Dots: B-Sides And Rarities, 1978-2001 (The Fiction Years) - a 4-CD set with b-sides, rarities, and soundtrack music.\n\nThe Cure released a new LP The Cure with the first single \"The End Of The World.\"\n\nDisintegration was certified 2x platinum.\n\nThe Cure could be heard on the soundtrack for Resident Evil: Apocalypse with \"Us Or Them.\"\n\n# 251 on the Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years chart.\n\nRoger O'Donnell and Pery Bamonte left the Cure.\n\nOn July 2nd, The Cure performed in Paris, as part of the worldwide Live 8 concerts.
