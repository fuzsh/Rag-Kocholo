First Cure Concert;

the kiss, torture, all i want, a japanese dream, catch, just like heaven, hot hot hot, if only tonight we could sleep, like cockatoos, the walk, inbetween days, how beautiful you are, the perfect girl, the snakepit, a forest, fight,

E1: close to me, let's go to bed,

E2: one more time, charlotte sometimes, shiver and shake,

E3: three imaginary boys, primary, boys don't cry, why can't i be you?
