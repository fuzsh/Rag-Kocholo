        "text": "On Sunday (14th April), unknown gunmen killed Amir Sarfaraz alias Tamba in Lahore Pakistan. Amir Sarfaraz alias Tamba was the man responsible for killing Indian national Sarabjit Singh in the Kot Lakhpat jail of Pakistan in 2013. Two unknown assailants shot Amir Sarfaraz dead in Lahore, as per reports. He was convicted in Sarabjit Singh’s murder. Later, a Lahore court set him free in December 2018.\n\nAccording to a report by Samaa TV of Pakistan quoting police, the shooting took place in the Ganga Street area of Islampura where two suspects on a motorcycle entered underworld don Tamba’s house and opened fire on him. Police said he was hit by four bullets, shot twice in the chest and twice in the legs.\n\nAmir Sarfaraz’s brother Junaid Sarfaraz said that Tamba was present in the upper storey of the house where he was shot. “One attacker was wearing a helmet and the other was wearing a mask,” he mentioned in the FIR filed.\n\nHe was immediately taken to a nearby hospital in an ambulance, but he died in the hospital during the treatment. Hospital sources said he died due to excessive bleeding, confirming that he was hit by four bullets. The death of Aamir Sarfaraz alias Tamba was later confirmed by his family sources.\n\nThe family also claimed he had been receiving threats for some time, adding that two unidentified motorcyclists entered the house and opened fire on him.\n\nPolice reached the house and cordoned off the area in search of the assailants. A case in the assassination has been registered in Islampura police station on the complaint of his brother Junaid Sarfaraz.\n\nNotably, several terrorists waging war against India have been killed in Pakistan in the last few months in Pakistan. Several criminals and terrorists have been killed by unknown gunmen in Pakistan, creating speculations about the involvement of Indian intelligence agencies. A recent report by the Guardian claimed that the killings were executed on the orders of the Indian govt. However, the govt of India has denied the allegations.\n\nSarabjit Singh was an Indian national jailed in Pakistan. He was arrested as a suspected Indian spy in Pakistan. Charges of terrorism and snooping were levelled against him. Sarabjit Singh was incarcerated in the Kot Lakhpat jail of Pakistan He was killed in a fight inside this jail in 2013.\n\nSarabjit Singh was arrested by Pakistani authorities in 1990 on fake charges of carrying out bombings in Lahore and Faisalabad. He was accused of being a spy for India’s intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). However, Singh maintained his innocence throughout the trial and asserted that he was wrongly implicated.\n\nHis case went through several legal proceedings over the years, with appeals made by his family and supporters for his release or clemency. There were also claims and counter-claims about his identity, with some suggesting that he was mistaken for another person with a similar name who was involved in the bombings.\n\nDespite international appeals for clemency, including from the Indian government and human rights organisations, Sarabjit Singh was sentenced to death by a Pakistani court in 1991. However, his execution was repeatedly postponed, and his case continued to be a point of contention between India and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2013, Sarabjit Singh died in a Pakistani hospital after being attacked by fellow inmates in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat prison. His death sparked outrage in India, with many believing that he was targeted because of his Indian nationality and the contentious relationship between India and Pakistan. Now, unknown gunmen have killed his killer."
