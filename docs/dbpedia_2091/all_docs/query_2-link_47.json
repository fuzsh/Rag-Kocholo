        "text": "NBIS supports end-to-end personnel vetting process, from initiation and application to investigation, adjudication, subject management, and monitoring.\n\nOne Consolidated System\n\nNBIS will replace a suite of legacy background investigation and case management IT systems from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), including Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), Secure Web Fingerprint Transmission (SWFT), Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), Defense Information Security System (DISS), Position Designation Tool (PDT), Personnel Investigations Processing System (PIPS), and more. With one consolidated system, security managers, investigators, and adjudicators will be able to access case status throughout the lifecycle of a background investigation, enhancing capacity and creating synergies from easier data validation.\n\nThe Future of Personnel Vetting\n\nNBIS is the foundation for future technology and policy requirements. As the federal government looks to reform and modernize its personnel vetting processes with Trusted Workforce 2.0 policy changes, NBIS will play an integral part. The system will leverage technology to improve delivery and capabilities. Notably, it will functionalize innovations, such as Continuous Vetting, as DCSA moves from periodic reinvestigations to real-time automated record checks, immediately alerting investigators to real-time concerns.\n\nHeightened Security\n\nNBIS will use cutting-edge technologies to safeguard the system, employing the same security controls used to protect warfighter communication systems. End-to-end data encryption and multiple layers of security will better segment data so that — in the event of an adversary attack or data spill — it will contain the spill and limit the impact.\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\nNBIS is leveraging proven Agile and DevSecOps pipeline approaches to software development. By facilitating fast, collaborative, incremental technology releases, these proven methodologies alleviate the need for broad system overhauls and will speed delivery, improve functionality, deliver customizable solutions, and enhance security. In this approach, NBIS users will be able to provide feedback to inform requirement generation and lead to continuous implementation and improvement.\n\nIncreasing Speed and Efficiency\n\nNew features such as e-Adjudication (automatically adjudicating background investigations with no substantive information of concern) and mass initiation (allowing users to request investigations for multiple similar subjects at once) will greatly expedite the investigation process. Security managers will also be able to tag cases and develop refined metrics to meet reporting needs. Thirty-two agencies are now using e-Adjudication.\n\nExpanding Transparency and User Experience\n\nThe new subject portal, e-App, will allow subjects to track their individual case status. The application itself will be easier to use and provide better information for vetting professionals. Subjects will have the ability to save their application more easily."
