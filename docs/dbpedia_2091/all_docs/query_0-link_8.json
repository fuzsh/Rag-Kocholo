        "text": "Founding leader of Babbar Khalsa\n\nJathedar Sukhdev Singh Babbar (9 August 1955 − 9 August 1992) was the militant and co-leader of Babbar Khalsa (BK),[1][2][3] a Sikh militant organisation involved in the pursuit of creating a Sikh nation named as \"Khalistan\"[4][5][6] and generally believed responsible for the 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182, although Sukhdev was never named as being involved. BK was founded by Talwinder Singh Parmar, himself, and Amarjit Kaur. He commanded BK continuously for 14 years until he was killed in 1992.[7] He was a member of the AKJ.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nSukhdev Singh Dasuwal was born on 9 August 1955 to Jind Singh and Harnam Kaur in a Sandhu Jatt sikh family of the village Dassuwal, Patti, Tarn Taran, Punjab, India. He studied up to the middle school level.[8] He had three brothers. His elder brother, Mehal Singh \"Babbar\" is also an active leader of the Babbar Khalsa International.[9] The older brother of all three, Angrej Singh, is blind. His family owned 18 acres (73,000 m2) of land in the village of Dassuwal. The wives of Sukhdev Singh Babbar and Mehal Singh Babbar are sisters who belonged to the adjoining village of Ghariala.[8] He took Amrit and became a Khalsa in 1977.[10]\n\nParticipation in the Khalistan movement\n\n[edit]\n\nBeginning\n\n[edit]\n\nAs per The Tribune,[11] the day of the Sikh–Nirankari clashes (13 April 1978) was also the day when his marriage was fixed. On this day, he took the pledge to take revenge on the Nirankaris.[8] He founded the organisation [1][2][3]Babbar Khalsa along with Talwinder Singh Parmar with the objective to secede from India and form the state of Khalistan for Sikhs. Babbar Khalsa's first goals were to kill the Nirankari head and the Nirankari seven stars who were the Sant Nirankari version of the Panj Pyare.[12]\n\nSukhdev Singh Babbar was the president of the Babbar Khalsa International. It was considered as the best armed and funded among the Khalistani militant groups in Punjab State[13] with an objective to create an independent state for Sikhs, known as Khalistan.[7] During the Khalistan movement, Sukhdev Singh Babbar was a militant chief of Babbar Khalsa International.[8]\n\nAttacks on Nirankaris\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of Babbar Khalsa's earliest activities was the killing of Nirankari Shaadi Lal by Sukhdev Singh Babbar and Kulwant Singh Nagoke.[14]\n\nBabbar Khalsa claimed responsibly for killing the Nirankari head Gurbachan Singh on April 24, 1980.[15]\n\nIn 1981 Babbar Khalsa split between members in foreign nations under Tawlinder Singh and members in India under Sukhdev Singh Babbar who was made overall head. Sukhdev said no unlawful activity will be done outside of India.[14] The first unit of Babbar Khalsa International was founded in Canada in 1981. This organisation has a presence in the United States, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Belgium, Norway, Switzerland and Pakistan.[16] Babbar Khalsa International became a major participant in Khalistan movement under his guidance and participated in hundreds of operations against Indian security forces and remained active in several Indian states.[16] One of Babbar Khalsa's earliest activities was the killing of Nirankari Shaadi Lal by Sukhdev Singh Babbar and Kulwant Singh Nagoke.[14] He was the President of Anandpur Sahib Municipality and one of the Nirankari seven stars.[17]\n\nOn September 9, 1981, Lala Jagat Narain was assassinated. Jagat was a former Punjab Legislative Assembly member and a former Member of Parliament. He was also the founder of Hind Samachar. Jagat was an outspoken critic of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and of the Khalistan movement. Jagat also had portrayed the Sikh gurus as \"lovers of wine and women\".[18][19][20] Babbar Khalsa claimed responsibility.[21][22][23]\n\nOn October 16, 1981, Sukhdev and fellow Babbar Khalsa members attacked Niranjan Singh who was a Nirankari and Indian Administrative Service officer. He was the Deputy Commissioner of Gurdaspur.[24] He was a key accused in the 1978 Sikh-Nirankari clash.[25] Niranjan managed to survive the attack in an injured state, but his brother was killed.[26][27]\n\nOn October 23, 1981, Babbar's killed the Sarpanch of Pannchata Mohinder Pal.[28][29]\n\nOn November 16, 1981, 2 Babbar Khalsa members on motorcycles under Sukhdev Singh Babbar killed Parhal Chand the Nirankari head of Kapurathala district. He was one of the seven Nirankari stars. In the killing, Chand's father was killed and his brother was injured.[30][31][32]\n\nOn May 22, 1982, Babbar Khalsa members opened fire directed at Nirankari's in Patti killing 4 and injuring many more.[33][34]\n\nOn October 27, 1982, Surinder Singh Sodhi, Babbar Khalsa members and Labh Singh killed Resham Singh. Resham was the Sant Nirankari head of Hoshiarpur District and 1 of the 7 stars. Babbars, Sodhi and Labh Singh had disguised themselves as police. They had approached Resham posing as officers who just wanted to chat. As Resham was talking about Bhindranwale, supposedly negatively, Babbars, Labh Singh and Sodhi pulled out stenguns and opened fire killing him instantly. It is said that Babbars, Sodhi and Labh Singh fled on a Royal Enfield Bullet and fired victory shots.[35][36][37][38]\n\nOn September 10, 1983, Babbar's killed Kulwant Singh the Nirankari head of Faridkot.[39][40][41]\n\nIn 1984 Sukhdev Singh Babbar claimed responsibility for the killing of 76 Nirankaris.[42]\n\nVarious assassinations and attacks\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 1986 Babbar Khalsa members killed DSP (Deputy Superintendent of Police) Harpal Singh. He was killed along with his father.[43][44]\n\nOn 19 January 1987, Babbar Khalsa members under Sukhdev killed Joginder Pal Pandey in Ludhiana. He was the general secretary of the Indian National Congress Party in Punjab and a member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly. In the attack Pandey's security guard Sohan Lal was killed. Three Babbars in a vehicle had opened fire when Pandey's car was stopped at a gas station. This incident led to a curfew in Ludhiana.[45][46]\n\nBabbar Khalsa launched an attack in September 1987 with Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala. The target was S.H.O. (Station house officer) Sub-Inspector Mith Singh. Mith Singh had been hand-picked by then chief of Punjab Police Julio F. Riberio. He was picked to deal with Budhsinghwala. Mith Singh had been accused of police brutality and targeting Budhsinghwala's family. Mith Singh had dragged Budhsinghwala's father by his hair in a public humiliation.[47] Budhsinghwala began plotting to kill Mith Singh in revenge for his actions with Husan Singh and Babbar Khalsa members. The attack was carried out by Budshinghwala and fellow Sikh militants on 15 September 1987 at around 9am. Mith Singh was shot while he was walking along with his guard, a police constable. Both of their guns were taken by Budhsinghwala. In the crossfire a schoolboy was also killed and five others were injured. The killing is said to have greatly alarmed Punjab Chief of Police Riberio. Mith Singh was one of his best and most loyal officers.[48][49]\n\nCommandant Gobind Ram was killed on January 10, 1990. Gobind Ram was killed in a bomb blast at the headquarters of the 75th battalion of the Punjab Armed Police in Jalandhar. He was commandant of the 75th battalion. According to an informant Gobind Ram's body had to be swept off the floor. The planning of the killing was done by Toofan Singh and Babbars. The bomb was planted in the cooler of his office. In the blast, three others, including Sub Inspector Prem Kumar, were killed and at least four were critically wounded. The blast also caused major damage to the building.

Sikh militants had been studying Harjit's travel routes for some time. A remote-controlled bomb had been placed on a road Harjit usually drove by to go to the doctor. When Harjit's lead security vehicles drove by and it was just his vehicle over the bomb it was detonated. In the explosion three of his security guards were killed and his vehicle was destroyed. Harjit's limbs were found over 100 meters away from the location of the explosion. A permanent curfew was put on the town after. A saying about the incident is, “He had a security vehicle in front of him and behind him, so he would be safe from all sides. But he didn’t count on his death coming from below”.

KLF, KCF, Babbar Khalsa, SSF, and BTFK (S) members held a meeting afterward pledging to kill Harjit within 31 days of Sangha's death. Major Singh of KCF was given the lead role in the killing. A famous kavishri ballad about this incident says, “24th November at exactly 9, for Sangha’s revenge Major Singh and his allies have arrived. Without wasting any time Kharkus have come to kill him… The 5 jathebandis [Groups] had said we would hit him hard… To become SSP he had done many misdeeds… Watch how with a computer system [remote-controlled bomb] Kharkus blow him up.

At the time, he was India's most wanted Khalistani extremist.[85]\n\nIt is reported that India used the cat system (Special Forces personnel disguised as militant), to trap Babbar. He was captured with the help of a former Babbar member turned police-cat, who informed on him in exchange for a reward of ₹ 10,00,000. This former member helped trap Babbar by arranging a meeting of top Babbar militants, ostensibly to work out future strategy. For helping neutralise the chief of the most powerful group of militants in the state, the turned member also received a full third of the reward on Singh.[86]\n\nAftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the death of Babbar, his followers killed policemen in retaliation.[13][86]\n\nAfter his death, Punjab Police DGP Kanwar Pal Singh Gill accused Babbar of living a \"king-like\" lifestyle. In his book, \"Punjab: The Knights of Falsehoods\", he accused Babbar of living a lavish lifestyle contradictory to the ideals of his organisation, and claimed that he owned multiple lavish bungalows. He further accused Babbar of living with Jawahar Kaur, a member of a popular singing group \"Nabhe Wallian Bibian Da Jatha\", and fathering an illegitimate child.[87]\n\nAfter his death his family members left their home and moved abroad. A major portion of his ancestral house of the Babbar Khalsa chief now stands demolished and the remaining dilapidated two-room set is locked.[8]"
