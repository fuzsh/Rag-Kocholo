        "text": "🌾 New Publication Alert! 🌾 I am excited to share my latest research article, \"Performance Evaluation of Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) in Andhra Pradesh,\" published in the International Journal of Agriculture Extension and Social Development. 🔍 Abstract: The study evaluates Rythu Bharosa Kendras's (RBKs) performance in Andhra Pradesh using multi-stage random sampling to represent the whole study area. 400 respondents were selected from state for three consecutive years: 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to construct performance indicators. Key Findings: Predominantly young and male workforce with a strong educational background in agricultural sciences. RBKs cover various villages and manage diverse land areas, indicating a flexible operational scale. Significant improvements in infrastructure development, particularly in digital technologies and agricultural testing equipment. High availability of key services such as Rythu Bharosa, e-crop booking, and crop insurance, with steady enhancements in marketing and registration services. A positive trajectory in the overall performance index, reflecting comprehensive service delivery and infrastructure growth, thereby supporting sustainable agricultural practices and rural development. 📈 Policy Recommendations: Continued investment in infrastructure and training. Enhancement of digital literacy and market support. Coordinated efforts to improve RBKs' effectiveness in promoting agricultural development and improving farmers' livelihoods in Andhra Pradesh. This research underscores the critical role of RBKs in fostering sustainable agriculture and rural development. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this vital area of study and look forward to seeing the positive impact of these recommendations on the farming community in Andhra Pradesh. 📄 Read the full article https://lnkd.in/gAFW3wac #Research #Agriculture #SustainableDevelopment #RBKs #AndhraPradesh #Farmers #DigitalAgriculture #PolicyRecommendations #AnalyticalHierarchyProcess #AHP)#RBK\n\nDay 2: Roots of Expertise 🌱📚 Greetings, LinkedIn fam! On this second day of our 21-Day CEO branding Consistency Challenge with @KwasiYork Let's get a bit into the roots of my expertise and the educational journey that has shaped my agricultural path. 🎓 Educational Foundation: I started my academic journey at Pugu Secondary School in Dar-es-Salaam, where my passion for science subjects ignited. 🧪 Later, at Old Moshi High School, I delved deeper into understanding the intricacies of agriculture. 🌾 Sokoine University of Agriculture: The pivotal turning point came at Sokoine University of Agriculture, where I earned a BSc in Animal Science (2010) and an MSc in Agricultural Extension and Education (2014). 🎓 These years were instrumental in honing my skills and deepening my understanding of the agricultural landscape. Continuous Learning: My commitment to learning didn't stop there. I recently completed the Tony Elumelu Online Course, enhancing my entrepreneurial skills to further contribute to the agricultural sector. Why Education Matters in Agriculture: Education is the bedrock of sustainable agriculture. It empowers farmers, drives innovation, and ensures a thriving future for the sector. In the comments, share your thoughts on the role of education in agriculture! Looking forward to connecting with fellow advocates of continuous learning in agriculture. Stay tuned for more insights on Day 3! 🌿 #CeobrandingConsistencyChallenge #AgricultureEducation #Day2RootsOfExpertise\n\nMy name is Owolabi Elizabeth Olanike, I hail from kwara state but based in many states 😂, you are like how possible is that anyways you can find out that later😉😉I studied food science and technology in my Nd days and studied Agricultural economics and extension for my B.tech, Agriculture has never been my thing right from primary school, in fact I hate agriculture but I find myself passing the exam even without reading, fast forward, one way or the other I find myself in agriculture, we had a small farm at the back of our house then that we plants series of crop but you will not see me in the farm with my family because I don’t like it, as God will have it my parent decided to venture into poultry gbam I have no choice than to take care of that chicken but Kai it wasn’t my thing, as time flies they started rearing sheep and goat I was like maka why now, mine was just to give them food, I do not pay attention to their nutrition, there medications and the likes, when God will finally catch me Futminna gave me Agricultural economics and extension, did I tell you that I hate economics as well but I still find myself doing it, fast forward I was managing to understand what agricultural economics and extension was about and I found someone who explained and I fall in love with the course because it has to do with providing solutions but somehow I realized that they splitted us and I fall into agricultural economics and farm management, toor I have no choice than to enjoy the course. Regrets If I had known that I will fall into agriculture, I would have taken it serious since secondary school and even put eyes when I had the opportunity maybe per adventure I would have gone far than this, nobody can tell… Lesson learnt In any opportunity try and grab it, don’t let it go without making use of the opportunity, now I am now interested in agriculture and that’s why I will be taking you all on a journey for few days about my adventure in agriculture, do well to follow me, like and share and you all will gonna learn… do have a wonderful night rest #EYIAICON# #EYIAONE#\n\nHave you ever turned a dislike into a passion? During high school, I disliked agricultural science. Although, it was the first textbook my mom always bought for me as though she prepared me for what was coming. When I was admitted to the faculty of agriculture, I wasn't happy as I had wanted to study medicine. But my mom was excited and showed it by packing 3-4 bags of foodstuffs for me before I started. However, during my second year, the quantity of my food items dropped drastically from three bags to one owing to shortage of food supply & price inflation. This caused many underprivileged students to starve, with some even becoming beggars. Through this experience, I developed deep passion for sustainable agriculture. I want to help find ways to make food production resilient to external shocks via research. My undergraduate studies laid a foundation in agriculture, and now I’m expanding my knowledge in sustainable agriculture and rural development. In the near future, I plan to pursue graduate studies to explore technology and innovation for a sustainable food system. What experiences have shaped your future aspirations? PS: Let’s connect if you share a passion for zero hunger and sustainable agriculture! #Elevateyourprofessionalpresencewith_Amaka #Day_12 Amaka Ifeduba\n\n🌿The Crawford Fund - 2024 Student Awards🌿 Now Open. Close 13 May 2024. University students undertaking a degree in agriculture, animal production, fisheries, forestry, natural resource management or any area broadly related to food and nutrition security, but not traditionally ‘agriculture’, this award is available to open a whole new world of experience and career opportunities. As part of the Crawford Fund’s NextGen program, each State and Territory Committees support the awards to enable students to gain valuable experience and expertise by bringing an international component to their studies and research. This usually involves travel and immersion in a research project, country and culture. Students can come from a broad range of degrees – social sciences, gender, health, communication, business, finance…. One of the great things about international agricultural research is that skills are required far beyond the usual traditional studies in agriculture! If unsure about how to connect to a project or organisation on which to focus a project application on, advice is, in the first instance, identify staff at the university who are already involved in international agriculture for development associated with the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) or any of the international agricultural research centres in the CGIAR or AIRCA: Association of International Research and Development Centres for Agriculture. Another strategy is to search on the ACIAR website for projects associated with an area of interest, or for projects in which the university is engaged. The Crawford Fund recognises the importance of fostering the interest and enthusiasm of students in agricultural research for development. The Crawford Funds work with the RAID Network and combined, offer conference scholarships, overseas experiences, and research and mentoring opportunities As part of the Crawford Fund network, the opportunities, friendships and support gained to develop experience and expertise in international agriculture for development are limitless.

However, I was perplexed to see that current agricultural students in tertiary institutions still experience the same misconceptions I faced years ago.Last week, I was privileged to attend the AXACE Conference of the Agricultural Extension and Rural Development Department of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. So many misconceptions and myths exist regarding studying agriculture, the greatest being becoming a farmer (which is not outrightly bad since we all depend on farmers for food). However, it is important to identify these misconceptions and straighten out the solutions. As a year one student, I shied away from telling people I was a student of agriculture because it was not deemed a ‘professional’ course and because I was told there were no significant career opportunities there. It is more baffling that individuals with non-agricultural background enter the agricultural sector and thrive really well. In the next few weeks, I will explore various baffling misconceptions about studying agriculture. These misconceptions have not only dwindled interest but also caused many undergraduates and graduates to leave so much value on the table. As an agricultural graduate, expert or undergraduate what misconceptions have you identified in this field? #Agstrides #AgCareer #Agriculture #Careergrowth"
