Dhillon\n\nISBN-10: 1895603021 or ISBN-13: 978-1895603026\n\nJat Clan Names and Population Distribution\n\nThere are hundreds of clan names unique to Jats, irrespective of their religious beliefs: Hinduism, Islam, or Sikhism. In fact Rose, [1] puts it very well, \"Broadly speaking (with respect to British Punjab), the Jat is a Musalman in the Western Districts, a Sikh in the Centre and a Hindu in the South-East, but there are many exceptions to this rule\". Many clan names are common to Hindu, Muslim and Sikh Jats. For example, some of the clan names common to Sikh and Muslim Jats are Chimma, Randhawa, Toor, Bajwa, and Bhatti. Similarly, some of the common clan names shared by Hindu and Sikh Jats are, Mann, Dhillon, Bhatti, Chahil, Sandhu, Narwal, Dhaliwal and Atwal.\n\nFurthermore, some Jat clan names are not unique to the Jats but are identical to that of Rajput (\"son of the king\"), and Gujar peoples related to the Jats, irrespective of their religious beliefs. For example, Doad, Dahiya, Chhokar, Bagri and Bhatti [2,3] clan names are common to both Jats and Rajputs. Similarly, Dahiya, Chhokar, Rawat, Bhatti, Bagri, etc., clan names are identical for both Jats and Gujars . [2,3]\n\nHowever, Dahiya [3] said, \"It should be noted that the Mann, Dhillon, Virk, Kang, Her, Mor, Johal, Pauniya, etc, are not found in the Rajputs. The reason is simple-none of them were formally converted to the orthodox Brahmanism (Hinduism)\".\n\nAccording to Rose [1] many Jat clans still claim royal ancestry: Gill (king of Garh Mithila), Mann (king Banipal), Sidhu (Rajput king Jaissal and the founder of the famous city of Jaisalmer, Rajasthan), Doad (king and Hindu God Krishna, hence are Chanderbansis), Dhillon (king Karna), and Aulakh (King Lui Lak), Sandhu (solar Rajputs or a Sandhu king and also according to Rose [1] Sandhus somehow have extremely hard feelings toward certain priests, for example, Rose [1] wrote on page 425 of his handbook, \"If looks towards my tomb cut him off, he and I are enemies as is a draught to a lamp\".), Bains (belongs to one of the 36 royal families of Rajputs), Bajwa (king Shalip), Chahal (king Agarsen Surajbansi), Chattha (Prithi Rai, the Chauhan king of Delhi), Deol (king Jagdeo), Ghumman (king Dalip of Delhi), Goraya (king Guraya), Pannun (a Solar Rajput King), Sohi (King Kang), and Grewal (king Rick and according to Major Bastow [5] on page 106, \"Grewal families of villages Kila Raipur, Gujarwal, and Naurangwal of Ludhiana district (Punjab) still had a sort of local authority at the close of the 18th century\").\n\nHistory and study of the Jats End of Page 119\n\n10.1 Jat Clan Names\n\nHindu, Muslim, and Sikh Jats have numerous clan names and most of them are discussed by Rose [1,4] in his Handbook.

Therefore, this section (basically based on these documents) presents various Jat clans and their respective population. With respect to population, I have used Major Barstow's data taken from the 1911 census and have multiplied it with a factor of 3 as, India's population has increased approximately three folds since those days. The objective here is to provide some idea of the Jat population, division as per clan, in the selected districts rather than to present an absolutely correct picture. Furthermore, some shifting may have occurred since 1911 due to factors such as divisions of British India in 1947, emigration to foreign countries and within India, and district reorganization. Also, some of the clans with a very small population may have been left out. Jat clans and their approximate population in some of the Punjab districts are as follows [1,4,5-7] (the figure in parentheses represents each Jat clan's approximate strength and where the terms such as \"hold\" and \"own\" are used they basically mean the clan in question own almost all of the village land):\n\n10.2.1. Ludhiana\n\nGrewal (45,336): This clan basically belongs to the Ludhiana district where it has about 75 villages.\n\nGill (28,101): It appears that this clan settled in the Ludhiana district about 350 years ago during the reign of Shah Jahan, the Mughal Emperor of India, and claims its ancestor was a king in the southern area of \"Gharmela\" [5]. The \"Gills\" own about 50 villages mostly around the area of Jagraon.\n\nSidhu (24,741): It is believed that this clan originally came from the Faridkot area of Punjab about 350 years ago and own a good many villages around the town of Jagraon.\n\nDhaliwal (32,454): This clan holds many villages around the towns of Pakhowal and Jagraon and claim their ancestor was a Rajput (son of king) from Jaisalmir, Rajasthan province to the south of modern Punjab.\n\nBhander (?): This clan of the Jats owns upwards of 20 villages.\n\nDhillon (9,858): This clan is scattered all over the district and claims coming from the west of the Sutlej river.\n\nChimma (8,916),\n\nMann (10,563),\n\nSandhu (9,729),\n\nMangat (6,663),\n\nSaroi (6,108),\n\nChahil (13,614),\n\nBhullar (5,310),\n\nDhinsa (4,533),\n\nBoparai (4,431),\n\nBhangu (3,432),\n\nBal (3,783),\n\nHer (3,603),\n\nMain (2,643),\n\nAulak (2,055),\n\nDeol (l,902),\n\nKang, (897),\n\nBains (741),\n\nHara (700+). This clan is largely concentrated around Sahnewal area and owns land in the village Nandpur and surrounding areas\n\nOther Jat clans to be found in the district are Sekhon, Rathi, Gandhu and so on.\n\nHistory and study of the Jats End of Page 123\n\n10.2.2. Amritsar\n\nSandhu (67,158): This is probably the strongest clan of the district and holds 121 villages [7]. Their strongest concentration is in the south-west corner of Tarn-Taran area, here, Sandhus hold 32 villages [5].\n\nGill (48,210): This clan holds 142 villages [7] in total and specifically its large concentration is in the Tarn Taran area where it holds about 25 villages.\n\nDhillon (44,202): This clan as per Captain Falcon [7] holds 140 villages in the district. Some of the Dhillons' villages are Kasel, Dhand, Chabal, Kairon, Padri, Gaggobua, Panjwar, Lijan, and Gandiwind.\n\nRandhawa (42,480): This clan owns 116 villages [7] and its main strength is in along the Batala border and around Mahta village in the area close to the Amritsar city.\n\nAulak (17,841): It is mostly to be found in the area around the town of Ajnala and around the village of Shabazpur in Tarn-Tarn sub-district where the clan owns a cluster of 9 villages.\n\nSidhu (26,739): This clan around Atari and Bhakna villages holds 14 villages.\n\nChahil (13,527): This clan owns 16 villages near the Sheron Bagha village.\n\nBal (17,934): This clan holds a total of 23 villages, for example, Bal Khurad, Bal Kalan, Bal Serai and Jodhe.\n\nPannun (14,196): This clan appears to have spread from the Doaba area of the modern Punjab and owns 7 large villages including Naushera and Chaudriwala.\n\nBhangu (3,978): This clan holds the large village of Khiala (Khurd and Kalan). The Legendry Mehtab Singh of the Sikhs and I think, General Shubeg Singh of the recent times belonged to this very clan.\n\nKang (6,159): This clan holds a cluster of villages in the Tarn-Taran area including Kang, Mal Chak and Kalla.\n\nBhullar (7,113),\n\nDhaun (22,710),\n\nMahil (7,020),\n\nSadal (7,515),\n\nMann (5,577),\n\nSarai (5,574),\n\nKara, (5,355),\n\nChhina (5,838),\n\nBhat (4,698),\n\nBoparae (3,651),\n\nSakuni (3,816),\n\nOpal (3,044),\n\nKaler (4,632),\n\nHinjra (4,689),\n\nJohal (4,593),\n\nHer (3,441),\n\nChimma (3,207),\n\nDhanoa (3,360),\n\nSohal (3,864),\n\nValia (2,868),\n\nSoi (2,697),\n\nBajwa (2,874),\n\nAthwal (2,067),\n\nBandar (2,316),\n\nBhatti (1,509),\n\nBatth (1,653),\n\nBhoi (1,545),\n\nDes (1,239),\n\nDhariwal (2,640),\n\nGhumman (372),\n\nGaraia (1,203),\n\nHundal (963),\n\nJawara (1,953),\n\nKhara (2,025),\n\nKhera (1,698),\n\nNijjar (2,223),\n\nOjla (2,583),\n\nRai (2,364),\n\nSagwan (1,503),\n\nSansi (2,046),\n\nSumra (1,038),\n\nVirk (2,037), and\n\nVaraich (2,070).\n\nHistory and study of the Jats End of Page 124\n\n10.2.3. Patiala (state during the British period)\n\nIn 1911, 30 per cent of the Patiala state population was made of the Jats. Major Barstow [5], on page 110 wrote, \"Patiala Jats mostly claim Rajput origin and appear to have migrated from Jaisalmer (in modern Indian state of Rajasthan south of Punjab) around the middle of the 16th century\".\n\nSidhu (138,000): This is the largest clan and the Royal family of the former Patiala state belonged to this very clan.\n\nChahil (64,500): This clan owns many villages around the town of Bhikkhi as well as it holds several scattered villages in the sub-districts of Fategarh, Narwana, Bhawanigarh, Amargarh.\n\nDhaliwal (54,000): It appears that this clan has settled in this area around 12th or 13th century A.D. from Jaisalmer (in the modern Indian state of Rajasthan) and claims Rajput origin [5]. Dhaliwals are mainly to be found in the sub-districts of Bhatinda and Bhikhi and their important septs are Mani, Rureka, Ramana, Udi, and Dina.\n\nMann (48,000): This clan has given their name to many villages for example, Manwala, Man Khera, and Man-sa.\n\nDhillon (31,500): This clan claim its descent from \"king Karn\" and the Dhillons are mainly to be found in the sub-district of Govindgarh as well as in scattered villages of sub-districts Bhikhi and Fatehgarh.\n\nGill (45,900): This clan is quite numerous in the sub-districts of Bhikhi and Rajpura and its sept \"Jhala\" holds 11 villages in the subdistrict called Sahibgarh.\n\nDhindsa (7,950): This clan also claims its descent from \"King Karn\" and during the Mughal period in India, the Dhindsas migrated from the Sirsa area of the modern Indian Province of Haryana bordering Punjab.

This simple and short study demonstrates, the closeness of many South Asian Jat clan names to their Western counterparts. In most cases, these names are identical. Obviously, the most likely reason could be the migration of the Central Asian people (Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans, etc.) into Europe, centuries earlier and their simultaneous movement into Punjab. The above study gives rise to a very strong possibility that even after the full assimilation of these nomad people into the Western society, many of their clan names have still survived to date. However, the Jats who went into Punjab and the surrounding areas, somehow, failed to fully integrate into the local societies. That is why they are still identifiable as a distinct society, irrespective of their religious beliefs: Sikhism, Islam, or Hinduism. Therefore, it is probably safe to say that the South Asian Jat characteristics are the closest to that of their forefathers in Central Asia than any other groups of the Jats.\n\nHistory and study of the Jats End of Page 129\n\n10.4 References: Chapter 10 -Jat Clan Names and Population Distribution\n\n[1].
