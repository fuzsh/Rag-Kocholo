        "text": "Reversing priorities -not a Rocket Science\n\n“Insanity is doing same thing again and again and expecting same results.”, is a quote which is used by 1000s of people, who talk about HOW TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL or HOW TO PURSUE A GOOD HABIT or HOW TO MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE. If you are looking for something like that then please read other blog, because this page is not about changing life by reading a blog but, its about doing a life long or life changing experiment. Now, one more thing, I have never done this experiment successfully, but have failed 1000s of time and realised how to do this experiment.\n\nNow, past 21 years of my birth went in believing that “THINGS JUST HAPPEN, YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT”, but, after lots of setbacks I realized “THINGS JUST HAPPEN, YOU HAVE WORK FOR IT”. Yes, instead of “AIT” its “ORK”. So, I think with this realization the name of experiment should be “ROCKET”. Because, these experiment takes lifetime or are life changing and have slight mistakes like that of ork/ait, which gets settled after many decades.\n\nIn order get my priorities right, I have to set my priorities right. That is – health, food, education and others.\n\nSo, before starting this journey, I should make a rough time table.\n\n4:30am to 5:30 am – remind yourself about your dream and purpose and what it is like being hurrying and be grateful and smile, wash face, Drink lots of water, freshen up, brush teeth, revise history notes and fold the bed, soak clothes for washing.\n\n5:30 to 6:30 am – jogging, eat sprouts and clean the room and do self talking and put hair medicine and face cream or sleep a bit, fill up water bottle.\n\n6:30 to 7am – revise notes.\n\n7am to 7:30 am – Bath and wash clothes and drink cold milk and eat fruits.\n\n7:30 to 8am – Read Newspaper or vajiram booklet, talk to parents\n\n8am to 10:30 am – Go to class or solve vajiram portal question or CSAT.\n\n10:30 to 11am – Get fruits or talk to friends and fill water bottle or go to Xerox shop.\n\n11 am to 12pm – Revise class notes, or do shopping or talk to friends or teachers\n\n12 to 12:30 pm eat lunch,\n\n12:30pm 7:15pm solve question papers.\n\n7:15pm to 8pm Celebrate with shouting, dancing and take dinner.\n\n8pm to 9:30pm. I will read newspaper or search about filing RTI or solve previous years question papers and fill water bottle.\n\nI will write a blog every evening at 9:30pm to 10pm.\n\n10pm – 10:30pm talk to parents, note down what you did whole day (ticks in your daily diary)and then do sudharshan Kriya and will sleep with remembering about my dream story.\n\nAlways take a nap of 10-15min in afternoon.\n\nTake medicines everyday.\n\nSmile and be grateful of what you have.\n\nKeep on motivating yourself to do more adventure. “What next?”\n\nWhat am I grateful of- I am lucky to get bureaucratic parents, who know the tricks to handle a rebellious kid. I am lucky to have brother, who never fears of learning new things and challenges this world. I am lucky to have friends who are competitive and supportive and wiser than me – I learn a lot from them. I am lucky to complete my credits in just 3 years. Also, I got to learn machine learning and published paper in cloud computing. I am lucky for getting an internship at IIT Bombay and IIIT Delhi. I am lucky for choosing to prepare for civil services at the age of 21. I am lucky to have flat mates, who are cool and supportive. I am lucky to have a double bed room for myself. I am lucky to have great teachers at vajiram. I am lucky to have a strong body, an amazing smile and a will to keep doing things differently. I am lucky for doing mistakes, and learning new lessons out of them. I am grateful for being lucky.\n\nI will keep on updating this list, as and when needed.\n\nA comment on our education system\n\nIndia is a country, where teaching is a sacred act. We put our “Gurus” before “God”. Our tradition has given teaching profession a sacred act.\n\nIn 21st century, teaching is not an “ART” but a “JOB”. It is a way to earn money. In Golden period, teachers were the most knowledgeable humans. They did it for free. Gurus created enlightenment in their disciples, stopped social evils and took nothing in return.\n\nIn 21st century, education is a way of earning money. Our results are more important than what character we dwell into. We are taught, so that we, are able to go into college, where, we are prepared to go for placements. We are taught, how to become a better servant, how sell a shitty product, how to make family contacts a way to improve business, how to smile artificially. All in the name of better salaries, higher living standards and what not. But, in old times, we were taught about finding our “higher purpose”. Where, schools were a place to learn discipline, build our character and make a better society. The colleges were for self exploration, research and debates.\n\nToday, teachers sell fear. “If you don’t study, you will not survive”, or “if you don’t study from that teacher in tuition class, you will not get good grades”. They have made education a business. Teachers love bullying students. Today, students enter college, with a dream of creating their own “Google”, but, in their final year, they fear even to apply for “an internship in Google”. But Gurus never sold fear, but, exchanged knowledge. They made students fearless, prepared them for any kind of situations with a spirit of “Never Give Up”.\n\nOur education system has a simple problem, “They don’t recruit best teachers, but show children dream of becoming Albert Einstein”. My friends don’t do research, because it affects their grades. They are the best in their fields, but don’t want the risk of creating something new. “They ask students to do innovations, but neither they talk about innovative ideas in class, nor have gradings”. Hence, they only want students to pass a course, and do not care about how they will apply it. “Teachers teach multiple subjects and many a times they themselves have no clue, of what are they teaching”. They are not even allowed to change syllabus, as per the demands of cutting edge technology, which happens in all great colleges. Also, students are allowed to take any kind of courses of any branch, so that, they can develop a better profile.\n\nIts true, that CEOs of tech giants are Indians, not because, they did what 99% of kids did i.e., “Fear of future, teacher and good grades”, but because they “Learnt from great teachers and never feared”.\n\nIn my 14 years of school life, with 8 periods each day, i.e., round to 20,000 periods, not even a single sentence, was about encouragement, enlightenment or higher purpose. Even moral science was a class to study a lesson. I always auditioned for roles in various activities, but, never got a chance because, “Famous Few” had their teachers ready to back them. Also, what is ridiculous is, in a schools of 2000 kids, only 100 participated and all of them were same kids again and again . We talk about creating each and every child a leader, but never apply that.\n\nBut, with the growing population and reduced number of reputed schools, education is just a business. When I studied, my school fees was 17,000Rs and today it 70,000 INR. They give scholarships over this!! Half of the parents can’t afford these schools. How is this education for all.\n\nI don’t think, with the modernization of Indian culture, our Gurus would have allowed education as a business. They would have used various resources over internet, to get their knowledge reached to everyone. “Knowledge is power”. You can’t deny education to anyone.\n\nOur constitution has “Bills and legislations” which are as old as Pentium D, but, we want to run ” 2 TB Hard Drive or 55 million kids population” over it. Our constitution protects rights of kids, but doesn’t teach its people how to make use of it. Its like, “You know the truth, but you never told it to anyone” and so, people or kids see only injustice and have to live with it.\n\nSame syllabus for decades, and we are the country who respects knowledge. We expect all 30 students in a class to learn at same pace. We conduct same kind of exam to test sports skills and academic skills. In Physical Education class their is a physical test and written exam, but, for a Science course, there is only written exam. In the name of knowledge students cram up books, find shortcuts, cheat, bribe and many do sucide. I think, we crave knowledge, because we don’t have one. So, good kids go abroad to fill that empty part and to stop their craving. How, do you expect innovation without great teachers? Who will push kids to the edge? Certainly, not today’s teachers.\n\nIt is not that great teachers do not exist in our country. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, “The Missile Man of India” became a teacher in Anna University, after retiring from ISRO and even after his Presidency he continued there. In a regular teacher’s class students show up only to get their 75% attendance, or, to get marks. But, in Kalam’s class 200% students sat. Students bunked there own classes, just to attend his sessions. There was an energy in the University. Students discussed ideas and not placements. They learnt with interest and stopped cramming.\n\nThe lesson is, we need teachers with knowledge and great content delivery. Even in my college, seats of those teachers fill first, who have great knowledge. But, the number of such teachers is low and student demand is high.\n\nThis has to be changed, or the teachers like Abdul Kalam will never born in India.\n\nNeed for change\n\nIndia has around 70% of people involved in agriculture. Hence, the distribution of geography,soil,castes, gender wealth and literacy differs to a large extent. Hence, agriculture is a very risky business, as we don’t know who is growing what and hence, who will compete who.\n\nSo, a level playing field doesn’t exist, which resulted in an increasing gap between rich and poor farmers resulting in suicides and shifting from agriculture to jobs. This is the reason why, government is concerned about agriculture. If no farmers and no farmlands there will be no one to grow crops leading to a different problem for developing and populated country like India.\n\nHence, to make farmers interested in agriculture business, government is introducing insurance schemes in agriculture. Insurance is an amount of money which one gets when the person has loss on the commodity on which it bet on. So, it reduces the risks of going bankruptcy. The banks get there fare share if no loss occurs, else, have to pay required amount.\n\nThe government has decided to involve people from agriculture department, farmers, insurance- main-company, banks, state and center. Hence, it is one of its kind of scheme.\n\nThe agriculture department makes notifications, builds plans, cut deals with banks, does selection process, finds frauds, organizes workshops and etc. Thus forming the culture of the whole team which is involved and hence, the working of this scheme.\n\nThe banks have to deal with farmers. If farmer takes loans a compulsory insurance is done. But, if farmer is non-loanee, it’s the farmer’s wish to consider taking an insurance. Also, bankers are the closest ones who will face the farmers. Now, banks collect all the forms and convert the data digitally and sends them to the insurance- main-company.\n\nInsurance- main-company then handles the major parts cross calculations and summarizing the data to patwar and girdhawar level. Finally they send the data to agriculture department, which then cross checks all farmers data and appeals revenue department,state and center for money.\n\nThe state and center govt then makes funds accordingly.\n\nThe revenue department checks for frauds and other matters either by banks or by farmers and finally distributes money to the banks.\n\nBanks then distribute money to famers whose claims are to be settled and issues a card in name of the farmer saying he/she received their money.\n\nFarmers help in crop cutting experiment and proper establishment of whether stations.\n\nSo, this is an innovative scheme, where Government and private sector comes together in order to benefit the food givers of our nation.\n\nFFCS teaches karma\n\n13bce2… uhuh!! 13bce0208\n\nPaswo.o.o.o..rd- (randomly type)\n\nEnter\n\nYeah!! Logged in(“more than happy “)oh!! Still buffering.\n\nThe moment you hit enter, you know it. This is your day. Within 10 min.- within 10 mins you will get all 7 subjects,..27 credits. All morning slots. You pledge, I will wake up early(“do like you woke up”), will then have the breakfast (“sit and eating”) and will reach classes on time. While (“smile eye brow up “)others will be rushing, skipping their meals and still will be late for their lectures.In evening I will complete all my assignments. will even publish a paper, 1hr will prepare for speeches and finally will go to gym, and… (“Like your wish came true”).(2-3 seconds gaze in )\n\nIts still buffering.(“make a round come back to the laptop. See the audience and the lappy..”)\n\nHOH..(“Fully frustated”)\n\nGood evening fellow VITians, FFCS ,FFCS is Fully Fluctuated and complicated system. It is an online slot booking system. It was made by the management. They say, they say(higher tone) its about giving equal opportunity, like a democracy. Well (smiling) its not democracy , its managementocracy . As democracy is of the people, by the people and for the people. Managementocracy is of the management, by the management and for the management. FFCS is that technology, which management knows its good, our parents are told, its good, FFCS itself knows its good, but on the D-day its no better than south africa in the cricket field. (“hands like flying catch”)\n\nStill buffering\n\nYou Wake up late, skip breakfast . You run on the tracks of VIT to reach class “act- huh huh ” “Excuse me.. may I come-in “.”You look at faculty -faculty looks at you You look at faculty -faculty looks at you ” . You know, you are stuck in that stare game If you win Thou shall enter the class, if not Thou can sneak into the class. These teachers are so particular about time, that it reminds me of “shri shri”touch ears” kapilachari “move round” krishnamurari “mala” gopalachari Pandey (“belt”)dvitiya a.k.a baba kris a.k.a baba swag ‘ fold your legs and yo sign ‘ ” who declares Thou shall be manglik(“hitler’s heil hitler signature”) a minute later well you are just another addition to 120crore plus Indian population.\n\nStill buffering\n\nAnother addition to this FFCS frenzy Project Based Lear…ning(“hehehe”). Yes, you got it right the mighty PBL . First day of a typical PBL class “Students, you can’t learn much without doing a project, so, the management has decided to go with PBL.”\n\nMe- Sir 50 marks project.\n\nSir- No, 15 marks mid term, one in CAT1 and other in CAT2,CAT3,CAT4,CAT100,CAT200, CAT210 and then their avg will be considered (“pause”), a quiz 5marks, seminar 5marks and a project 25marks(“stress on this”), which will be further divided into reviews.. Review0,1,2,3,4 each of 5 marks, which will be further divided into sections of 1 marks each, with each word having a weightage more than your existential importance in VIT . And , obviously huh you can convert the project into a paper.\n\nStill buffering\n\nSo, toastmasters, last time I did my FFCS at home, at cybercafé, at neighbor’s house, at party, while dancing ,eating, in the toilet and even while sleeping .\n\nBuffering…\n\nNow, let your FFCS login timing be 2-4pm. With a month’s training, and previous 4 semester’s attempts you are prepared for the battle. At exactly 2, you logged in. By 2.15 you got 15 credits. (“Show gestures etc.” “slow down your volume”)And suddenly the page stops responding. That’s a crucial moment, like rain came and decision went to 3rd umpire. After proper analysis you found that, you forgot to recharge your data card. You lost a match because of “duck worth louis rule” (crying.)\n\nYou, go to the shop which is closed, because they are having lunch.\n\nThen, you call your best friend-Abhinav– who always gets all the credits within 10 minutes. He owes you, as you told him all the teachers and slots.\n\n(“Act”)So, you ask him to do your ffcs.\n\nHe says yes.you message him userid and password.\n\nIn the evening you found out, Jumbled slots,all toppers in the class. Aiyoo. Then, you remembered, you helped your best friend –all the strict teachers and ….\n\nNow you, you are totally confused, . In such situations I got baba swag”Yo sign” and he says “FFCS is life within life, you have to deal with it son”(heil hitler)\n\nSession logged out\n\nThank you.\n\nIn recent years what changes have happened in vit\n\nGood Evening Agua\n\nI am Pranav Chaturvedi\n\nWhat I feel is, there are three major areas where VIT has changed —\n\nIn the number of intakes, then college life and finally recruitments.\n\nNow, VIT is ranked no. 8th, which luckily gave VIT a “CHANCE to GROW” and also lost its respect in the eyes of its own students. The students intake per branch is like, has crossed “THE VAGHA BORDERS”.\n\nIn term of facilities its really-really awesome, but-but-but…. Considering VIT’s latest intake status this facility is gone out of VIT’s dictionary. Overcrowded messes, unhygienic food . Even hostel in time has been reduced to 10 when it was 11:30 !!. For our seniors. Introducing projects in various courses is an appreciable step, but, making courses 5 credit, having CATS and QUIZES has only increased burden on my fellow juniors.\n\nNow, recruitments; VIT is not making any records, its making “LIMCA BOOK OF RECORDS”. The management\n\nIs really having great impact on these mass recruiters. But, it makes me thinking, they don’t have engineers in that management team.\n\nAs an engineer, we are supposed to be working on our ideas, building models for future, ironically we are giving tests and according to some standards we are becoming engineers which we never indented to be.
