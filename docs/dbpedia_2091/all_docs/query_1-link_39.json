        "text": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is recognized as an information and knowledge-base organization. FAO's activities comprise four main areas which are closely related to various aspects of information and knowledge: capture and analyze, disseminate and share, localize and provide. The goal of developing and maintaining tools for information and knowledge management is attributed to the Office of Knowledge Exchange, Research and Extension (OEK) of FAO. One of the most important resources for covering the terminology of all subject fields in agriculture domain is the AGROVOC thesaurus, which evolved into a semantic system in order to provide ontology services. This newly reengineered system is called the \" AGROVOC Concept Server Workbench (ACSW) \". This article analyzes the different knowledge productions modes for the traditional AGROVOC and the new ACSW system: mode I assimilate to the traditional AGROVOC Thesaurus management and mode II to the ACSW system.\n\nThe tendency of representing information in a form that could be better elaborated by computers (the so called “machine readable format”) (Berners-Lee 1998) initiated years ago, expanded to many domains, among which agriculture. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, The Kasetsart University and the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur are pioneers in the representation of information and knowledge related to this domain using modern techniques such as ontology languages. This paper analyzes a couple of projects developed by these organizations, aiming to make use of a concept-oriented approach while describing agricultural topics. It is organized in two chapters each referred to each project, describing in particular the innovative aspects, the benefits, and the technology used. 1: The AGROVOC Concept Server AGROVOC is a multilingual thesaurus for agriculture developed in the early 1980s by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the European Commission. It...\n\nThe use of widely-used metadata standards is essential to guarantee the visibility and retrieval of documents stored in open repositories. Attention should be paid to the creation and exchange of meaningful metadata to enhance interoperability amongst repositories and provide value added services. Since 2005 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) provides the agricultural information management community with standards, services and tools to assist open repositories in benefiting from the advantages offered by Semantic Web publishing. This paper presents the work that FAO carries out in recommending standards for the encoding and exchange of metadata while also reviewing techniques to help navigate within open repositories and services. It talks about how to improve the visibility of repository content and explains the benefits of integrating subject vocabulary tools expressed in SKOS. It concludes with a presentation of use cases integrating these recommendations into DSpace and Drupal customizations.\n\nTo be faced with a document collection and not to be able to find the information you know exists somewhere within it is a problem as old as the existence of document collections. Information architecture is the discipline dealing with the modern version of this problem: how to organize web sites so that users can actually find what they are looking for. Information architects have so far applied known and well-tried tools from library science to solve this problem, and now topic maps are sailing up as another potential tool for information architects. This raises the question of how topic maps compare with the traditional solutions, and that is the question this paper attempts to address. The paper argues that topic maps go beyond the traditional solutions in the sense that they provide a framework within which they can be represented as they are, but also extended in ways which significantly improve information retrieval.\n\nThe rapid increase in the publication of knowledge bases as Linked Open Data (LOD) warrants serious consideration from all concerned, as this phenomenon will potentially scale exponentially. This paper will briefly describe the evolution of the LOD, the emerging World-Wide Semantic Web (WWSW), and explore the scalability and performance features of the Service Oriented Architecture that forms the foundation of the Semantic Technology Platform developed at MIMOS Bhd., for addressing the challenges posed by the Intelligent Future Internet.\n\nAGROVOC is the multilingual thesaurus managed and published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Its content is available in more than 40 languages and covers all the FAO’s areas of interest. The structural basis is a resource description framework (RDF) and simple knowledge organization system (SKOS). More than 39,000 concepts identified by a uniform resource identifier (URI) and 800,000 terms are related through a hierarchical system and aligned to knowledge organization systems. This paper aims to illustrate the recent developments in the context of AGROVOC and to present use cases where it has contributed to enhancing the interoperability of data shared by different information systems."
