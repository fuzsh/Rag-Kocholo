        "text": "Sikh Khalistani organisation\n\nThe Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) is a Sikh Khalistani militant organisation operating in the state of Punjab, India with prominent members based in Canada, United Kingdom and Pakistan.[2][3][4] Its objective is the creation of a Sikh independent state of Khalistan through armed struggle. KCF is also responsible for many assassinations in India, including the 1995 assassination of Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh.[5][6] It is designated as a Terrorist Organisation by the Government of India.[1]\n\nObjective\n\n[edit]\n\nThe creation of a Sikh independent state of Khalistan through armed struggle is their primary goal. KCF primarily targeted Indian security forces including CRPF, BSF and other police forces. It targeted Hindus who were against the Khalistan movement. The primary source of funding of KCF is looting, bank robbery and extortion. It is also involved in large scale smuggling of weapons from Pakistan to India across the International border.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKhalistan Commando Force was founded by the Sarbat Khalsa and Panthic Committee. It was the official army of Khalistan.[8] Manbir Singh Chaheru was made the leader in February 1986.[9][10][11]\n\nOn 8 August 1986, Punjab Police arrested Manbir Singh Chaheru (\"Hari Singh\"), and he was eventually killed[12][13] or disappeared[14] while in police custody. After Chaheru was arrested, former police officer Sukhdev Singh, also known as Sukha Sipahi, took command of the KCF. Sukhdev Singh changed his name to Labh Singh and assumed the title of \"General\".\n\nAfter his death the KCF was headed by Kanwarjit Singh Sultanwind[15][16] On 18 October 1989, Kanwarjit Singh Sultanwind,[17] and another two KCF members were arrested by police near Jalandhar. While one member managed to escape, Kanwarjit Singh Sultanwind, then 23 years old, swallowed a cyanide capsule to avoid giving information about the group.[17]\n\nDecline\n\n[edit]\n\nOperation Black Thunder against the Sikh militants in Golden Temple greatly degraded the capability of KCF to conduct attacks.[7] Police killed Labh Singh on 12 July 1988.[18] His loss damaged the organisation. After his death, the Khalistan Commando Force split into factions including those led by Wassan Singh Zaffarwal, Paramjit Singh Panjwar and Gurjant Singh Rajasthani.[19]\n\nAnother result of Labh Singh's death was the failure of the Khalistan Commando Force - Babbar Khalsa alliance, as the relationship established by Labh Singh and Sukhdev Singh Babbar was lost.[20]\n\nThe group broke into multiple factions.[21]\n\nThis organization eventually rendered unable to operate after all of its chiefs, local commanders, militants were killed or captured by Indian security forces by late 1990s.[22]\n\nActivities\n\n[edit]\n\n1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 6 March 1986, according to police Manbir Singh's planned attack on Kabul Singh, acting president of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), was carried out in Kapurthala. The attack killed 7 and injured 13. It was carried out by KCF members. According to police 6 men in a jeep opened fire on the escort of Kabul Singh and a police men. Kabul Singh managed to survive, but was seriously wounded.[23][24][25] According to othee sources the real target was Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Jarnail Singh Brar and that Kabul Singh was caught in the crossfire. The KCF members used stenguns. This attack was condemned by the Panthic Committee and the All India Sikh Student Federation(AISSF).[26]\n\nOn 7 March 1986, Manbir Singh and co burned the home of Jaskirit Singh in Kassochal.[26]\n\nOn March 26, 1986, KCF members killed Arjan Singh Mastana an MLA and leader of Communist Party of India.[27][28][29][30]\n\nOn March 29, 1986, Manbir Singh and co were allegedly responsible (According to Surjit Singh Barnala) for an attack in Nakodar killing 12. They shot at a brick kiln and a nearby barber shop.[31][23]\n\n6 officers were killed, and more injured, in a violent attack on the District court in Jalandhar, Punjab, India by KCF.[32][33][34][35][36][37] Accounts of the attack, reported on 6 April 1986 in the US, differed.[38] According to an unidentified source in Mahmood's \"Fighting for Faith and Nation: Dialogues with Sikh Militants\", the attack was made by KCF leader Manbir Singh Chaheru and his associates.[39] \"The Courier\" of Arizona, US, carried a story attributed to UPI stating that 3 \"Sikh terrorists\" killed 3 police officers who were taking 3 prisoners to a bathroom, while \"16 armed court guards cowered in fear\". The report stated that 2 police holding a 4th prisoner were also gunned down, and that \"Three other officers, a lawyer, and a bystander were wounded as the Sikhs sprayed the area for 15 minutes.\" Police said that the guards were too frightened to return fire. This fourth suspect remained in custody. Finally, the Courier article reported that the Sikhs looted \"three rifles and a submachine gun\" from the dead bodies, and that a 6th officer later succumbed to wounds from the attack.[40] The \"Wilmington Morning Star\" carried an AP story, and related that 3 \"Sikh extremists\" killed 4 police officers inside the District Court complex, killed two officers who \"were shot at the courtyard gate as the attackers fled\", and wounded 4 other individuals, including a lawyer. The Star identified the freed suspects as Labh Singh, Gurinder Singh, and Swaranjit Singh, who were to appear in court on charges of slaying Ramesh Chander, a Hindu newspaper editor. The Star reported that District Magistrate S.C. Aggarwal said 4 attackers fired over a compound wall from a lane. It further reported that others witnessed the attackers open fire from close range as police led the prisoners to the toilet. The report concluded with District Police Chief Baljit Singh Sandhu's statement that the attackers hard \"fired at least 50 rounds\" in the attack.[38] The \"Eugene Register-Guardian\" reported that District Magistrate S.C. Aggarwal said in a telephone interview that 3 or more attackers opened fire as 4 defendants accused of the May 1984 slaying of Ramesh Chander, were being led into the compound, and that the attackers took 3 rifles from the slain police.[37] This single incident became a basis of Roberio's \"Bullet for bullet\" policy.[41]\n\nAccording to Harjinder Singh Jinda after Labh Singh was free they both met each other in Jalandhar along with Chaheru. Chaheru had told them that they were in urgent need of money. Labh Singh and Jinda told Chaheru that they would get the cash in a week. They began to scout banks in Jalandhar and selected one to rob. 3 days later at 11 in the morning Labh Singh, Jinda, and others robbed the bank of 1,250,000 rupees. (US$250,000)[42][43]\n\nTarsem Singh Kohar, the main hit man of KCF, along with Sukhdev Singh hijacked a train on 10 April which resulted in the death of 5 police officers.[44]\n\nOn 15 July 1986 Manbir Singh organised an attack on Karpurthala Jail to rescue 2 Sikh militants. The militants were Balwinder Singh and Jagjit a Singh Gill. Both of whom were “dreaded” militants. In the jailbreak 2 guards were killed and their weapons were taken.[45][46][47][48]\n\nThe organisation battled Indian military forces, especially in revenge for Operation Blue Star, the government's 1984 military operation in the Harimandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar.[citation needed]\n\nManbir Singh was arrested on 8 August 1986. Manbir Singh would later be executed in an extrajudicial killing by police. Manbir was the first head of KCF and had broken Labh Singh out of prison. Sarbjit Singh Ropar who was responsible for Manbir Singh's arrest and the acting chairperson for a faction of All India Sikh Student Federation was kidnapped by KCF on 28 August. He was interrogated by Labh Singh and revealed his hand in the arrest and his fathers who was a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP). He also revealed his hand in the arrests of Tarsem Singh Kohar and Waryam Singh. He was soon executed by Labh Singh along with Hardeep Sahota, and Hans Raj Ghuman. Hardeep and Hans were also involved in the arrest of multiple militants and Manbir Singh.[49][50]\n\nIn 1984, General Arun Vaidya had planned and supervised[51] Operation Blue Star – a controversial military operation ordered by Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India,[52] On 10 August 1986, General Arun Vaidya was shot to death by Jinda and Sukha while he was driving his car home from the market.[53] According to the police, the assailants pulled up next to his car on motor scooters and fired eight or nine shots into the car.[54] Vaidya reportedly died instantly of head and neck wounds. His wife, who was also in the car, was wounded by four bullets in her back and thighs.[55] According to Indian intelligence sources, Vaidya had been the number four assassination target on lists by Sikh militants and he was one of several people killed in retaliation for Operation Blue Star.[56][57] Following the assassination, the Khalistan Commando Force issued a statement declaring that Vaidya had been killed in retaliation for the Operation Blue Star.[56]\n\nOn 1 September 1986 Labh Singh (Head of KCF)[58] assassinated Additional District and Sessions Judge R.P. Gaind. He was shot 4 times dead in a store while on the phone. His wife and daughter watched the killing. This shooting put secure forces on high alert across Punjab. He had been receiving death threats over his verdict on a case prating to Sodhal Mandir in Jalandhar. A room of it was used by Sikh for worship. Sikh demanded the room that was used for Sikh worship become a Gurdwara.[59][60][61]\n\nIn September 1986 KCF members under Labh Singh robbed a bank in Talwara. the bank manager was killed and 29,000 rupees (386,000 rupees in 2023. US$4,700 in 2023) was stolen.[62]\n\nIn September 1986 KCF, whose leader was Labh Singh, killed Darshan Singh Canadian an MLA and party leader of the Communist Party of India.[63] Darshan Singh opposed Sikh militants and Khalistan supporting NRI Sikhs. He actively campaigned against both.[64]\n\nIn September 1986 KCF members under Labh Singh also killed Baldev Singh Mann. He was a left-wing activist of the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) New Democracy. He was a state level leader of Kirti Kisan Union and the editor of Hirawal Dasta[65][66] Baldev was gunned down by 4 men in his home village near Amritsar. He was walking with his brother who escaped unhurt.[67][63]\n\nOn September 29 of 1986 KCF members under Labh Singh robbed a bank in Tar tarn Sahib. The bank manager was killed.[68]\n\nOn Octobor 3rd 1986 men identified in the press as Sikh militants in police uniforms attacked Director-General Punjab Police Julio Francis Ribeiro inside his headquarters in the city of Jalandhar, Punjab, India, with automatic weapons.[69] One guard was killed, and Ribeiro, his wife, and four other officers were injured. Ribeiro's wound was minor, but his wife was hospitalised.[70][71][72][73] KCF later claimed responsibility for this attack.[74]\n\nIn a phone call to news organisations Labh Singh, head of KCF, claimed responsibility for the killing of 4 members of a police patrol near Amritsar.[75]\n\nIn October 1986 Labh Singh personally led a bank robbery in Talwara at the State Bank of India. According to police 4 Sikhs robbed the bank and 2 people were killed and another 2 wounded. The robbery occurred in broad daylight. US$176,000 was stolen.

US$130,000 in 2023) from the Millar Ganj branch of the Punjab National Bank, Ludhiana.[8]\n\nIn December 1986 a few months after Manbir Singh's arrest a police informent who caused Manbir's arrest was supposedly killed by the KCF. He was killed along with his wife and 2 of his children. A third child was wounded.[79]\n\nIn November 1986 Jinda and fellow KCF members killed Congress leader Doctor Kalicharan Sharma in Ludhiana. He was a major leader of Hindus.

After killing him they stole his stengun. The DSP had been accused of harassing Sikhs and families of militants.[82]\n\nOn 11 January 1987 Harjinder Singh Jinda and another militant of the Khalistan Commando Force assassinated Inspector General of Punjab Prisons Trilok Chand Katoch. Katoch was killed in 3 shoots near his home in Chandigarh. Jinda and another fled on a scooter. Katoch was the highest ranking police official to be killed up to that point.

The code was largely followed. Sikh women began wearing traditional clothing and many meat, alcohol, and tobacco shops closed. Many restaurants brought in vegetarian items to the menu. Some did not follow the decree which put them in danger. Those who did not follow were forced to either pay off Sikhs or get security. Sikh leaders generally supported the decree. The enforcement of the decree in its first 2 months resulted in at least 6 killed, 60 shops burned, and complete or partial closure of 1,500 businesses.[94][93] One survey found that there were no meat or cigarette shops between Amritsar and Phagwara. Famous restaurants that served meat had removed it from their menu and denied ever serving it.[93] According to Assistant Deputy Inspector General of Police in Jalandhar A.S. Siddiqui the moral code was popular among Sikhs especially those living in rural areas. He said, “Women seem to be pleased with it and there is also the fact that the AISSF has been on a massive recruitment drive through their amrit prachar (preaching of Sikh baptism) meetings. There is one meeting a day in the state, and after every meeting an estimated 200 youths pledge themselves to the service of the panth.\"[93] Militants justified the moral code by saying, \"No avatars, Hindu or Sikh, ever did these things. To eat meat is the job of rakshasas (demons) and we don't want people to become rakshasas.\"[93]\n\nOn 27 April 1987 KCF members attacked a court in Amritsar and freed 3 KCF members, Ranjit Singh Rana, Kanwarjit Singh, and Rajbinder Singh.
