        "text": "Dhillon (ढिल्लों)[1] Dhillan (ढिल्लन)[2] Dhillvan (ढिल्लवां) Dhallu (ढल्लू)[3] Dhillu (ढिल्लू)[4] [5] Dhilan (ढिलान)[6] Dhil (ढिल)[7] [8] Dhalan (ढलान) Dehlan (डहलान) Dhall (ढल्ल) Dhillwan (ढिल्लवां)[9] Dhilla (ढिल्ल) [10] is Gotra of Jats in India and Pakistan. [11] Dhillons are mainly found among Jat Sikh Gotras but Jat Hindus also exist in Hissar, Jind, Sirsa & Kurukshetra districts. Dhillon Jats, who are Muslim, also exist in West Punjab (now Pakistan). Delhi, the capital of India was founded by Dhillon gotra Jats.\n\nOrigin\n\nFerozepur tradition avers that Saroia, Jat, had five sons, Sangha, Mallhi, Dhindsa, Dhillon and Dusanj, eponyms of as many gots. [12]\n\nHistory\n\nRam Swarup Joon[13] writes that about Dhillon, Chitralia, Dhilla, Aharyar: Dhillons are called the descendants of King Karna. There was a King Karna in the Bhin-baroliya gotra too. According to Radhe Lal, who quotes 'Waqiate-panch Hazarsala, 800 years before Christ, 13 rulers of Dhillon gotra - ruled for about 450 years. Their names are Birmaha, Mahaval, Sarupval, or Suryaval, Birsan, Sanghamia or Manipal, Singhpal or Kalik, Tejpal or Jitmal, Kamsen, or Kamdhan, Shatrumardhan, Jiwan Siagh, Hari Rao or Bir Bhujann, Birsen II, Udai Bhutt or Drutyaketu . It is after the name of Dhillon that we have the word Dhilli or Delhi. The Dhillon Sikhs belongs to the Bragyan and Karoriya Misls. According to the census of 1911 people belonging to the Dhillon gotra were 5200 only in Amritsar, and 40000 in the whole of the Punjab. They are also found in UP and Haryana. Bhariyar gotra is a branch of the Dhillon gotra.\n\nSometimes known as the \"Raja Jats\" (King Jats), this mainly due to the large number of Kings, royalty and warriors that have come from this tribe throughout history. It is considered to be one of the oldest Jat tribes with history dating back over 4000 years [14].\n\nThe Dhillons are called the descendants of Karna [15], the famed royal warrior mentioned in the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata and he was also the eldest son of Queen Kunti. There was a King Karna in the Bhin-baroliya gotra too. Most Dhillons today trace their history back to Prince Dhillon[16], the first Dhillon, the grandson of Karna and great grandson of Queen Kunti.\n\nAccording to the family tree of Dhillons of Amritsar, Prince Dhillon was the grandson of Mahabharat famed Karna and son of Loh Sen [17]. Karna the famed warrior mentioned in the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata. Karna was killed at Kurukshetra. After Karna was killed at the Battle of Kurukshetra, his descendants first went to Rajasthan and then to Bhatinda in present-day Punjab. Even now, Dhillons are settled in large numbers in the areas of Bhatinda. They are also settled in the area of Moga, Sangrur, Ropar, Patiala and abroad.\n\nIn addition, Dhillons are linked to the royal house of the Pandavas. Yudhishtra, ruler of Hastinapur and Indraprastha, later known as Delhi. The third ruling Jat dynasty in this line was Dhillon whose descendants are the present Jat gotras. Dhillon, Dhilwal and Dhill. Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, has in his book \"Satyarth Prakash\" (\"The Light of Truth\"), quoted from the famous book \"Chadrika Pushtika\" that from Yudhishtra to Harsha Vardhan, 124 rulers ruled for 4257 years 9 months and 14 Days [18]. Six dynasties ruled during this period. The first three dynasties had their capitals in Hastinapur, Indraprastha and Kausambi. During the reign of the fourth generation, the capital was changed to Magadha. It is also mentioned that during the reign of the fourth generation of Yudhisthra, Hastinapur was destroyed due to changes in the course of the River Ganga.\n\nThe Dhillon Dynasty founded Delhi[19] and ruled there from 800 BC to 283 BC (about 450 years). It is from the name of Dhillon that we have the word Dhilli or Delhi. A ruler of the Dhillon dynasty, Raja Dhilu (King Dihlu) founded Delhi and the dynasty ruled from there from 800 BC to 283 BC. According to Radhe Lal, who quotes 'Waqiate-panch Hazarsala, 800 years before Christ, 13 rulers of Dhillon gotra - ruled for about 450 years. Some of their names are:\n\nRaja VirMaha (817 BC - 800 BC)\n\nMahabal or Swarupbal (800 BC - 744 BC)\n\nSarvdutt or Swarupdatt (744 BC - 708 BC)\n\nVirsen (708 BC - 668 BC)\n\nSingdaman or Mahipal (668BC - 624 BC)\n\nKalink or Sanghraj (624 BC - 595 BC)\n\nJitmal or Tejpal (595 BC - 515 BC)\n\nKaldahan or Kamsen (515 BC - 506 BC)\n\nShtrumardan (506 BC - 481 BC)\n\nRaja Jiwan (481 BC - 455 BC)\n\nVirbhujang or Hari Rao (455 BC - 424 BC)\n\nVirsen II (424 BC - 389 BC)\n\nUdaybhat or Adityaketu (389 BC - 372 BC)\n\nThis book[20] describes the Dhillon Jat rule from 800 BC to 350 BC. Dhillon is a big Jat gotra and is not found in any other community. A major part of this gotra adopted the Sikh faith.\n\nDhillon Jats ruled Delhi again in the 8th century. They are from among the Saroa Rajputs. In 8th century, Tomara/Toors had seized the throne and power of Delhi from Dhillons and their kinsman Sanghas, Malhis, Dosanjhs and Dhindsas who were descendants of Shah Saroa. Leaving Delhi, they moved towards Rajasthan. After some time they migrated to the Bangar areas of Sirsa in Haryana and Bhatinda. Some of them went beyond to Ludhiana and Ferozepur. Most of the Dhillons from Ferozepur went into Majha. Dhillons from Ludhiana went further into Doaba. Some of the Dhillons went as far as Gujjranwala.\n\nThe Dhillon Sikh Dynasty and their clan founded the Bhangi Army (Misl), who ruled and governed in the 18th century over most of the major cities of Punjab, including Amritsar, Lahore, Multan, Chiniot, Jhang, Bhera, Rawalpindi, Hasan Abdal, Sialkot, Gujarat and large areas of central and western Panjab[21].\n\nB S Dahiya[22] writes: Dhillon is an important clan of ancient history. The fact that they are also found in the European population (Dillon) shows that they must have been older than the Christian era.\n\nAccording to historian Qanungo, the city of Delhi is named after them and it was later on taken by the Chauhans. According to Farishta after the death of Kidar, Jaichand took the throne of Kannauj, to be succeeded by his brother, Dhill or Dahla, who founded the city of Delhi.[23] This happened in the fourth century B.C., i.e., before Porus's and Alexander's times. Its old name was Dhillika as is recorded in the inscription of Somesvara Chauhan, in V.S., 1226 (1169 A.D.).[24] Later on the suffix 'ka' was deleted and the city was named Dhilli. The inscriptions of V.S. 1337 found at Boher (Rohtak) reveal that the country of Haryāṇaka (Haryana) was first ruled by the Tomars and then by the Chauhans and then by the Ghori Sultans.[25] Gurdial Singh Dhillon, ex-Speaker of the Indian Lok Sabha is a scion of this clan. S. Prakash Singh Badal, Chief Minister of Punjab is also a Dhillon-the affix Badal, being the name of his ancestral village.\n\nThe Dhillon appear to have several Jatheras, Gaggowahna being mentioned in addition to those described on p. 238 supra. No particulars of these are forthcoming. But the fact that Dhillon was Raja Karn's grandson is commemorated in the following tale : — Karn used to give away 30 sers of gold every day after his bath but before his food. After his death the deity rewarded him with gold, but allowed him no food, so he begged to be allowed to return to the world where he set aside 15 days in each year for the feeding of Brahmans. He was then allowed to return to the celestial regions and given food.[26]\n\nReligion\n\nDhillons are mostly Sikhs or Muslims. Dhillon Sikhs founded the Bhangi Army Misl. In Punjab (India) and Haryana, Dhillons are mostly Sikh. In Punjab (Pakistan), they are mostly Muslim.In Jammu (Samba and R.s.Pura) they are mostly Hindus.Majority of the Dhillons in Sirsa, Hisar, Ambala and Karnal areas of Haryana are Sikhs. Majority of the Dhillons in Sialkot, Lahore and Gujranwala have converted to Islam.\n\nSecondary Dhillon Jat Surnames\n\nDue to the age and size of the ancient royal Dhillon clan, it has some small number of derivative secondary family names that keep Dhillon as their main surname but have minor family name before main Dhillon surname. But in present time different parts of India, Dhillon Jats use surnames like Dhindsa, Chitralia, Malhi, Kairon. The Sikh Dhillon Jats of the village of Kairon take on the name of the village and keep the main royal Dhillon name as their fourth name. The most famous Dhillon 'Kairon' is probably Pratap Singh Kairon Dhillon.\n\nDistribution in Haryana\n\nहरियाणवी ढिल्लो गांव सूची (100+) नहला, ज़िला फतेहाबाद डाहौला, ज़िला जींद पाबड़ा, ज़िला हिसार डेरोली जाट, ज़िला महेंदरगढ़ बनीपुर, ज़िला रेवाड़ी बाबरोली, ज़िला रेवाड़ी रामपुरा ढिल्लो, ज़िला सरसा डालनवास, ज़िला महेंदरगढ़ सेहर, ज़िला भिवानी हथीरा, ज़िला कुरुक्षेत्र बिदावास, ज़िला रेवाड़ी रूपावास, ज़िला सरसा बलियावाला, ज़िला फतेहाबाद शामदो, ज़िला जींद कनोह, ज़िला हिसार मटडाडू, ज़िला सरसा ताजिया खेड़ा, ज़िला सरसा कटाली, ज़िला सरसा मेवली, ज़िला रेवाड़ी जोधपुरिया, ज़िला सरसा रामवास, ज़िला चरखी दादरी खरकाड़ी, ज़िला भिवानी सुटाणा, ज़िला रेवाड़ी सुटानी, ज़िला रेवाड़ी जुई, ज़िला भिवानी सूचन, ज़िला सरसा रूढ़ियावास, जिला झज्जर रूढ़, ज़िला रेवाड़ी खानपुर खुर्द, ज़िला सोनीपत अटेला नया, ज़िला चरखी दादरी बसरी की ढाणी, ज़िला महेंदरगढ़ नथवा, ज़िला फतेहाबाद बूढ़ेड़ी, ज़िला भिवानी धनौरी, ज़िला कैथल कलायत, ज़िला कैथल बस्सी, ज़िला करनाल बर्दू पूरण, जिला चरखी दादरी गोपालवास, जिला चरखी दादरी झिगावन, ज़िला महेंदरगढ़ जाटावास, ज़िला महेंदरगढ़ मोहनपुर, ज़िला महेंदरगढ़ शीला खेड़ा, ज़िला कैथल नरवाणा, ज़िला जींद सुरजेवाला, ज़िला जींद धौलरा, ज़िला यमुनानगर अम्बरसर, ज़िला जींद सधोड़ा, ज़िला यमुनानगर पिंजूपुरा, ज़िला कैथल टिटाणी, ज़िला भिवानी नंगल जमालपुर, ज़िला रेवाड़ी ढाणी मनसुख, ज़िला भिवानी जुगलान, ज़िला हिसार\n\nSource - Facebook, 14.08.2024\n\nDhillon's with origin in the following villages in Haryana State.\n\nVillages in Mahendergarh district\n\nDeroli Jat, Mohanpur, Jatwas, Gehli, Jhigawan,\n\nVillages in Hisar district\n\nPabra[27], Kanoh, Kanwari, Kharia Hisar, Nehla, Shavite,\n\nVillages in Rewari district\n\nBanipur, Rudh,\n\nVillages in Jind district\n\nShamdo (Jind) Dhola (Jind) Pabra, Kanoh, Balak, Faridpur and Kanwari (one family), Naguran, Dauhla[28]\n\nVillages in Panchkula district\n\nBagwala ,\n\nVillages in Karnal district\n\nIn Karnal there are several villages of Dhillon's\n\nVillages in Yamunanagar district\n\nPabni Kalan[29]\n\nVillages in Sirsa district\n\nRampura Dhilon, Rupawas[30]\n\nVillages in Gurgaon district\n\nLokri,\n\nDistribution in Punjab\n\nPopulation of Dhillons in Patiala was 31,500.
