        "text": "Sikh militant group\n\nThe Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) is a Khalistani militant organisation operating in the Punjab with prominent members based in Canada, United Kingdom and Pakistan. Its objective is the creation of a sovereign Sikh nation‐state of Khalistan through armed struggle. It is responsible for numerous assassinations, abductions, and military engagements with the Indian Armed Forces during the Insurgency in Punjab. The KLF is also listed as a designated terrorist group by India.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe KLF was responsible for several bombings of military targets in India during the 1980s and 1990s, sometimes in conjunction with Kashmir separatists.[3][4][5]\n\nKLF was among the Sikh groups that claimed responsibility for the 1991 abduction of the Romanian chargé d'affaires in New Delhi, Liviu Radu. This appeared to be retaliation for Romanian arrests of KLF members suspected of the attempted assassination of Julio Francis Ribeiro, 62, the Indian ambassador to Romania, in Bucharest.[6] Radu was released unharmed after Sikh politicians criticized the action.[7]\n\nIn the year 1991, Khalistan Liberation Force along with Bhindranwale Tiger Force of Khalistan and Dr. Sohan Singh (Head of Panthic Committee) etc. participated in the secret peace negotiations with India in the city of Ludhiana. These meetings were initiated by Union Minister of State for Home Subodh Kant Sahay on the orders of the (then) Prime Minister of India Chandra Shekhar. It is said that this peace effort was sabotaged by Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence.[8] Former Indian Intelligence Bureau Joint Director, Maloy Krishna Dhar stated in a press report published by The Hindu[9] that \"Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her ISI advisers were determined not to let peace succeed. Pakistan's covert war in Jammu and Kashmir had exploded in 1990, and its establishment understood that the Punjab conflict tied down our troops, and threatened our logistical lines into Jammu and Kashmir.\" The KLF was listed in 1995 one of the 4 \"major militant groups\" in the Khalistan movement.[10]\n\nIndia, in the 1995 era, alleged that Pakistan provided Sikh militants with shelter and support.[5] The separatist movement was largely crushed in the mid-1990s.[3][11]\n\nIn 1999 it was reported that former KLF operative Manjinder Singh Issi, who took part in the Radu kidnapping, became disillusioned with KLF when he realized that its Pakistani supporters were more interested in disruptive violence in Punjab than Sikh autonomy.[12]\n\nArrests still occur as of 2023.[13]\n\nThe KLF was the primary fighting force of Khalistan movement in the 1980s and 1990s. It was responsible for assassinations, abductions and military engagements with the Indian Forces.\n\nPresence\n\n[edit]\n\nBased on the information acquired from the interrogation of three pro-Khalistan militants arrested on 4 August 2014 revealed that Funding of the organisation comes from United Kingdom, Malaysia, Spain and Canada.[1]\n\nFactions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Khalistan Liberation Army (KLA) is reputed to have been a wing of, or possibly associated with, or possibly a breakaway group from, the KLF.[14]\n\nBan\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 26 December 2018 the Ministry of Home Affairs of Government of India, issued to notification to proscribe the Khalistan Liberation Force as a banned organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).[15][16]\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nThe KLF organisation (Jathebandi) was founded by Aroor Singh and Sukhvinder Singh Babbar in 1986.[17] Other KLF leaders who headed KLF after Aroor Singh were Avtar Singh Brahma[18] (killed by Punjab police 22 July 1988),[17] Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala (Killed by Indian security forces on 29 July 1992),[19] Navroop Singh (killed by Punjab police on 4 August 1992),[20] and Navneet Singh Khadian (killed 25 Feb 1994).[17] After Navneet Singh Kadian's death, command of the KLF passed to Dr. Pritam Singh Sekhon.[21]\n\nFollowing Sekhon's death in 1999, the organization remained a leaderless group, presumed dead, though small activities occurred under its name, heading into the 21st century. This organization was regrouped in 2008 under the leadership of Harminder Singh Nihang after the occurrence of many \"Anti-Sikh\" incidents in the Punjab state by Dera Sacha Sauda.[22] Harminder Singh Nihang remained as the leader until his death in April 2018 at Patiala jail due to heart attack.[23] Harmeet Singh PHD became acting Jathedar in 2014 after Harminder Singh was arrested and became the official Jathedar. He succeeded Harminder Singh until his murder in the beginning of 2020.[24] After Harmeet Singh’s murder Avtar Singh Khanda a UK resident took over KLF. His father was a slain KLF member. Khanda would go by the name Ranjodh Singh. Khanda would die of a suspected poisoning on 14 June 2023.[25][26]\n\nS.

The encounters were described as long bloody, and fierce. The Kharkus killed multiple CRPF men and blew up multiple vehicle and then escaped. One of Brahma's targets in the attack, a police Inspector who had killed Dalbir Singh Billa Vapral a Kharku, was killed by Brahma's group along with 7 other officers. Following this the Kharkus led by Brahma killed multiple CRPF soldiers in other attacks throughout the day.[27]\n\nOn 15 January 1987, Avtar Singh Brahma’s planned assassination of Lieutenant Colonel Sant Singh Bhullar was conducted. Bhullar attacked a Gurdwara in Sri Muktsar Sahib as part of Operation Blue Star. 10 KLF members had broken into Bhullar’s home and killed him in a burst fire. Three others were injured. They left behind a note from Avtar Singh Brahma claiming responsibility.[28]\n\nIn January 1987 Avtar Singh Brahma and fellow militants fired at CRPF and challenged them to capture him for 20 minutes at Brahampura. The CRPF did not attempt to capture him and waited for reinforcements. Once reinforcements arrived an hour later they smashed and searched many homes in the village. They were also accused of committing other atrocities and faced heavy criticism from many leaders.[29]\n\nAvtar Singh Brahma claimed responsibility for killing Pahar Singh and his wife. Pahar was a KLF Lieutenant General. Brahma claimed that they had broken KLF’s rules and began to kill innocents as well as extorting people.[30]\n\nKLF launched an attack in September 1987. The target was S.H.O. (Station house officer) Sub-Inspector Mith Singh. Mith Singh had been hand-picked by then chief of Punjab Police Julio F. Riberio. He was picked to deal with Budhsinghwala. Mith Singh had been accused of police brutality and targeting. The attack was carried out by Budhsinghwala and fellow Sikh militants on 15 September 1987 at around 9 in the morning. Mith Singh was shot while he was walking along with his guard, a police constable. Both of their guns were taken by Budhsinghwala. In the crossfire a schoolboy was also killed and 5 others were injured. The killing is said to have greatly alarmed Punjab Chief of Police Riberio. Mith Singh was one of his best and most loyal officers.[31]\n\nOn 1 November 1987, Avtar Singh Brahma claimed responsibility for the killing of 2 CRPF jawans in an ambush the day before near Kabirpur.[32]\n\nOn 6 November 1987, KLF killed D.S.P (Deputy Superintendent of Police) Tara Chand. Chand was killed in the Jagraon area.[33]\n\nOn 12 December 1987, KLF attacked and killed 9 police personnel in Punjab.[34]\n\nOn February 12 1987, KLF conducted Punjab's biggest robbery ever with cooperation with All India Sikh Student Federation and Babar Khalsa International.[35]\n\nOne of Budhsinghwala's most major actions was the killing of Senior Superintendent of Police Avinder Singh Brar and Senior Superintendent of Police KRS Gill on 14 December 1987.[36][37] SSP Brar and his junior, SSP KRS Gill, were both killed while jogging at Patiala's National Institute of Sports. Both of them had little security. Two men in tracksuits approached them at 7 a.m. They signaled to a third person who pulled out an AK-47. Brar was killed instantly by a bullet hitting his temple, \"sending his skull flying\".[37] Gill attempted to flee to a police jeep, but was injured with bullets in his head and back. He would die while fleeing and fell on the ground face first. The three killers fled on a motorcycle.[38] Brar and Gill were top officers. There killing was described as the biggest killing since that of AS Atwal in Punjab. It was also described as a big killer of police morale.[37] Brar had been held as the best police officer. Brar had cleaned the Babbar Khalsa out of Patiala.[39] According to Chief of Punjab Police at the time J.F Ribeiro Brar would have become the chief of police had he not been killed.[40]\n\nIn 1988 Avtar Singh Brahma and fellow militants attacked and destroyed CRPF bases in retaliation for CRPF actions at Brahampur.[41]\n\nOn 22 January 1988 BJP Punjab Vice-President Khushi Ram Sharma was shot dead with 4 bullets in Ludhiana by 2 Sikh on scooters. Budhsinghwala claimed responsibility in a letter on behalf of KLF.[42]\n\nOn the same day 6 KLF members armed with AK-47s shot dead 12 people in a park in Barnala. 5 others were injured. One of them was a Shiv Sena worker. Budhsinghwala claimed responsibility in a letter on behalf of KLF.[42]\n\nIn April 1988 KLF led an attack on Gurcharan Singh Tohra and Professor Darshan Singh. Tohra was president of SGPC and Darshan was the SGPC appointed Jathedar of Akal Takht.[43][44] The attack was led by Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala. At a SGPC meeting at Ludhiana University KLF members under Budhsinghwala snuck their way in using fake ids. They attacked and fought Tohra and Darshan’s security. 5 police officers and 8 members of Tohra and Darshan’s party were killed. No KLF member was killed but Tohra and Darshan managed to escape unhurt.[45][46][47] A motive for attacks on Tohra could be the belief of militants that Tohra was involved in Operation Blue Star.[48]\n\nAt Sri Hargobindpur Toofan Singh and 5 others attacked a police party on 1 November 1988. In the attack 1 Sergeant was wounded, and 1 Constable was also wounded.[49]\n\nIn December 1988, near Sri Hargobindpur, Toofan Singh and others attack SHO (Station House Officer) Swaran Singh and officers with him. No one was hurt in the attack.[49]\n\nOn 19 June 1988 under Budhsinghwala’s reign as Lieutenant-General of KLF a senior KLF leader with other members gunned down the head of the Punjab Shiv Sena, Ramkat Jalota. He was killed along with his gunmen and another.[50][51][52] The Shiv Sena had used violence against Sikhs which made them targets of Sikh militants.[53]\n\nAvtar Singh Brahma was killed on 22 July 1988. He was killed in an encounter near the Pakistan border. One source has described his death as happening in, \"mysterious circumstances...\"[54] Another says that before Avtar Singh's death he, \"scamper[ed] through the verdant fields of Punjab's border district on horseback.\"[55] His death caused outrage among rural Sikh as he was quite popular amongst them.[56] Avtar Singh had become known as a Robin Hood figure. He is said to have commanded respect until the end.[57] Avtar Singh was succeeded by Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala[58] one of Avtar Singh's lieutenant generals.[59]\n\nIn March 1989 under Budhsibghwala KLF members killed Thanedar (Assistant Sub-Inspector) Pargat Singh. Pargat had been accused of targeting the family and of militants. He was killed while having tea near a police station. Another officer was injured.[60][61]\n\nOn 25 June 1989, Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala, head of KLF, along with Kulwant Singh and other KLF members attacked a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) meeting at Nehru Park in Moga. 21 RSS members were killed with a police officer, a paramilitary home guard and a couple dying of a bomb blast after the shooting leaving a total of 25 dead and 31-35 injured. It has since been renamed to Shahidi Park meaning Martyr Park. According to police Sikhs opened fire with automatic weapons from a van killing 21 and injuring many more before fleeing. Soon after a powerful bomb blast occurred which killed 4, injured more, and caused damage. A second bomb also blew up after, but it caused no damage or injuries. A curfew was announced immediately following the incident.[62][63][64][65][66][67] Home Minister Buta Singh described the incident as, \"a very serious attempt on the part of terrorists to whip up tension along communal lines.\"[63]\n\nBudhsinghwala claimed responsibility for an attack on 2 CRPF jeeps near Sher Chowk on 25 July 1989. The government claimed 1 CRPF jawan was killed and 4 injured. Budhsinghwala claimed more were killed in the attack. Budhsinghwala also warned that more attacks would ensue if police did not stop committing fake encounters.[68]\n\nOn 3 August 1989, under Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala Kulwant Singh, a senior KLF member, and another killed Charan Das. Das was the head of a heterodox Dalit religious group. He had been accused of blasphemy of Guru Granth Sahib. He was chopped into pieces by the KLF members.[64][69]\n\nOn 13 September 1989, S.S.P Gobind Ram's son was killed in an attempted attack on Gobind Ram by Budhsinghwala and other KLF members.[70]\n\nOn 16 September 1989, Manish Kumar, son of S.P Des Raj, would be kidnapped by Budhsinghwala. His reasoning was that he wanted police officers to go through the pain of losing a child as so many Sikh had in fake encounters. Though the real reason was for the release of Khalistan Liberation Force members. Manish was let go in exchange for the release of Budhsinghwala’s allies. Manish was treated well while he was captured. He said that he was given sweets and was told stories of the Sikh Gurus. On the day of his release he was dressed in new clothes and was given 11 rupees.[70]\n\nOn 19 October 1989, Babbar Khalsa, KLF, and SSF collectively claimed responsibility for killing 1 Black Cat(NSG) near Manihal in Punjab.[71]\n\nOn 19 October 1989, Babbar Khalsa, KLF, and SSF collectively claimed responsibility for killing 1 Black Cat(NSG) near Barwal.[71]\n\nOn 19 October 1989, Babbar Khalsa, KLF, and SSF collectively claimed responsibility for killing a CID constable named Buta Singh.[71]\n\nOn 19 October 1989, Babbar Khalsa, KLF, and SSF collectively claimed responsibility for a shop owner named Moti Lal, near Bhakhiwind, for unprovoked fire on Sikh militants.[71]\n\nOn 16 November 1989, Toofan Singh, Sukhdev Singh Babbar, and other Kharkus of BKI and KLF claimed responsibility for killing a Congress Politician's gunman, a police sergeant, near Batala for killing Babbar Khalsa member Gurnam Singh in a false encounter.[72]\n\nOn 16 November 1989, Toofan Singh, Sukhdev Singh Babbar, and other Kharkus of BKI and KLF claimed responsibility for attacking two police stations near Jhanda.[72]\n\nMajor Singh Johal, Anar Singh Para, and other KLF members attacked with grenades and captured a Home Guard headquarters in Lakhna Kalan.
