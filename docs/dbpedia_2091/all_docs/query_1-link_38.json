        "text": "Haaziriin-i-maHfil, aadaab 'arz.\n\nThese days janaab-i-Afzal Sahib has been posting on the subject of\n\ntranslations of poetry from English to Urdu and Urdu to English. In\n\nthe latest post, there is an interesting discussion in progress\n\nconcerning the meaning behind Faiz's nazm, \"Raqeeb se\". It appears\n\nthat there are divergent views held by Urdu knowing ALUPers. It\n\ntherefore stands to reason that if the 3-4 participants taking part\n\nwere to translate the poem into another language, each one would most\n\nprobably come out with a version that does not wholly convey the same\n\nmeaning. This should not surprise any of us. Whatt this does show is\n\nthat the reader is receiving a version of events but not necessarily\n\nthe \"correct\" version or the \"complete\" version.\n\nA translation can not be expected to match the original in terms of\n\nmeaning, rhythm, the musicality of the language and all the other\n\nnuinaces of the \"parent\" language. But this does not mean that one\n\nshould not venture into the field of translation. After all, how else\n\ncould one know about the literature of other languages if one does not\n\nknow that language? Through translation of course.\n\nLiterary translation is not as easy as non-literary disciplines. It\n\nhas been said that a translation of literature can be compared to the\n\n\"wrong side\" of the carpet; the original being the top of the carpet.\n\nThis may sound rather harsh for one does come across some fine\n\nexamples of literary translation. But I wonder, whether it is fair to\n\ncall such works as translations or are they \"transformations\" or\n\n\"transcreations\" or some such word? As an aside, if Faiz or Iqbal\n\n(both English knowing poets) were to translate a piece of their own\n\nwork into English, one would expect it to be of the highest quality.\n\nBut, no, this is definitely not the case! I don't have actual examples\n\nat hand, but I do believe both these poets have ventured into little\n\nbit of translation of their own poetry. Translation, therefore is an\n\nart in itself.\n\nA while back ( nine years to be exact), Zafar Sahib started thread\n\ncalled \"Ghalib Punjabi MeN\". Here is a link to that thread.\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/alt.language.urdu.poetry/browse_frm/thread/afb250d68d39cd59/4be770458f12943a?lnk=gst&q=transcreation#4be770458f12943a\n\nA gentleman named Aseer has translated a selection of Ghalib's Urdu\n\npoetry and to my mind he has done a grand job. Of course non-Punjabis\n\ncan not be expected to appreciate his attempt at conveying quite\n\naccurately and beautifully Ghalib's verse. There are no doubt others\n\nwho have been quite successful in translation Urdu poetry. One name\n\nthat comes to mind immediately is Victor.G. Kiernan who has translated\n\nboth Faiz and Iqbal.\n\nWhile on the subject of translations, one can not and must not\n\noverlook Edward Fitzgerald. His \"translation\" of Khayyam's Ruba'iyaat\n\nis world renowned. But the problem is that most of the time one can\n\nnot easily match his translation with the original quatrain; sometimes\n\nnot at all.\n\nHere is one where we can trace to the original.\n\nziiN pesh nishaan-i-buudanii-haa buudast\n\npaivastah qalam zi nek-o-bad naasuudast\n\ndar roz-i-azal haraaNchih baayist bi-daad\n\nGham Khurdan-o-Koshiidan-i-maa behuudst\n\nLiteral translation\n\nBefore (all) this, all that was to be was put in place\n\nThe pen has not rested at all from (writing) good and bad\n\nOn the first day He gave whatever that was necessary\n\nOur grieving and endeavors are of no use (at all)\n\nFitzgerald's translation\n\nThe Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\n\nMoves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit\n\nShall lure it back to cancel half a line\n\nNor all your Tears wash out a word of it\n\nMost of you will be familiar with Hafiz Shirazi's famous Ghazal whose\n\nmatla' is..\n\nagar aaN Turk-i-Shiiraazii ba-dast aarad dil-i-maaraa\n\nba-Khaal-i-Hinduash baKhsham Samarqand-o-BuKhaaraa raa\n\nLiteral translation.\n\nIf that Shiraazii Turk were to take my heart in his* hand\n\nFor his* black mole (on his cheek) I will give away Samarqand and\n\nBuKhaaraa\n\n* There is no gender differentiation in Persian.\n\n**Sir William Jones' translation\n\nSweet maid, if thou would'st charm my sight,\n\nAnd bid these arms thy neck enfold;\n\nThat rosy cheek, that lily hand\n\nWould give thy poet more delight\n\nThan all Bocara's vaunted gold,\n\nThan all the gems of Samarcand\n\n** Renowned Sanskrit and Persian Scholar and Philologist and founder\n\nof the Asiatic Society of Bengal at Calcutta.\n\nNow, I would go for this creative translation any time, but, as a\n\nperson who has an interest in language matters, I always tend to look\n\nout for tenses etc and how accurately the translation is\n\nlinguistically. What should we look out for in a good translation?\n\nWhat would you consider as good examples of Urdu to another language\n\nand another language to Urdu translations?\n\nNaseer\n\n\n\n\n\nNaseer Saheb,\n\nI think all of us are aware of the difficulties and pitfalls\n\ninvolved in poetic translations. I am using the word \"poetic\"\n\non purpose. Because translations of prose into prose do not\n\nrepresent the same level of difficulty.\n\nI think the essential features of a good translation can be summed\n\nup as follows :\n\n(a) It should adequately convey the broad sense and (if possible)\n\nthe subtle nuances of the original piece.\n\n(b) It should be sufficiently \"poetic\".\n\n(c) It should conform to the correct idiom and phraseology of the\n\nlanguage in which the original is translated.\n\nAs has been said, this is indeed a tall order. You have already\n\ncited the example of Fitzgerald. Over the years, many have said\n\nthat \"what is being read is in fact Fitzgerald himself, and not\n\nOmar Khaiyyaam\".\n\nHere are some more examples (selected at random) from Ralph\n\nRussell's attempts at \"translating\" Ghalib {the original\n\nverse is also quoted after each such attempt }:\n\n1. I will not cry for more if I may only look at you\n\nBut there among the houris let me look upon your face\n\nTaskeeN ko hum na royeN jo zauq-e-nazar mile\n\nHooraan-e-KHuld men tiri soorat magar mile\n\n2.

And\n\nyet someone once derided the National Anthem of that country since\n\n\"it contained just one Urdu word -- 'ka'\" ! The point I am\n\nmaking here is in the context of this issue of translation. Even\n\nthough the entire Anthem may consist of Faarsi (and even Arabic)\n\nwords, yet literate people in both countries do readily understand\n\nwhat the Anthem means.\n\nSome years back, on a visit to India, I had come across a book\n\nwhich contained poetic translations of some ghazals of Haafiz.\n\nI had jotted down a few ghazals at the time. And here is one of\n\nthem. The Faarsi original's matla' is as under :\n\nHar k(e) oo yak sar-e-moo paNd-e-m'ra gosh kunad\n\nHum'choo man halqa-e-gesoo-e-tu dar~gosh kunad\n\n{Transcription errors to be excused}\n\nUrdu Translation :\n\nGar naseehat pe miree apna koi gosh kare\n\nHalqa-e-gesoo-e-mushkeen ko dar~gosh kare\n\nJa ke maiKHaane men dekhe dehane-saaqi ko\n\nMai piye aur lab-e-sheereeN ki shakar nosh kare\n\nTu gul-o-nargis-o-sosan ki taraf jaaye agar\n\nHusn tera har ik aawaaz ko KHaamosh kare\n\nIs sabab pech-o-KHam-o-taab mile kaakul ko\n\nTaa'k(e) woh qaid dil-e-'aashiq-e-mad'hosh kare\n\nShikwe Haafiz ko haiN furqat ke bahut, par dekhe\n\nJab tiri ek jhalak, sab woh faraamosh kare\n\nIt can be seen how convenient it is, relatively speaking, to\n\nrender Faarsi into Urdu.\n\nAfzal\n\njanaab-i-Afzal Sahib, aadaab 'arz hai.\n\nThe delay in my response has been to provide sufficient time to other\n\nfriends (and foes!:-) ) to offer their views. One friend has been long\n\nmissing but his sudden appearance has brought renewed life to my\n\naching bones after going through a few days of flu! Welcome back UVR\n\nSahib!

What they have done is created \"tazmiins\" and how wonderful\n\nthese new creations are. I say \"tazmiins\" because, the essential idea\n\nof the poets is there in their handiwork but the rest is of their own\n\nimagination. In short they have added material to their \"translations\"\n\nwhich is no where to be found in the original. I believe a certain\n\namount of honesty and integrity is required for this process. The\n\ntranslator ought to declare, quite openly, in the preface of his book\n\nthat he/she has taken certain liberties. I know translating a piece of\n\npoetry is not the same as religious texts but let me provide you with\n\nan example of the translation of the Qur'aan which makes me very\n\nangry.From Surah FaatiHa ( I have transcribed the verses as best as I\n\ncan with the keyboard at my disposal, along with the literal\n\ntranslation). The verses form part of a Muslim's daily prayers.\n\nihdina_ssiraata_lmustaqiim.\n\nGuide us to the straight path.\n\nsiraata_llaaziina 'an'amta 'alaihim Ghairi_lmaGhduubi 'alaihim wa\n\nla_ddwaaliin.\n\nThe path of those you have bestowed your favours*; not of those who\n\nhave earned your wrath. Nor of those who have gone astray**.\n\nOne translation I came across has the following additions, in\n\nbrackets.\n\n* ( such as the Jews)\n\n** (such as the Christians)\n\nNow, one normally reads something in translation because one does not\n\nknow the original language. Most people would believe that these\n\nadditional items are part of the Qur'aan itself when they are not.\n\nThis kind of translation is absolutely despicable.\n\nAbove is an exteme example of course. Jones talking about \"Bocara's\n\nvaunted gold \" and \"all the gems of Samarcand\" is not causing anybody\n\nany harm. In essence he is not wrong in conveying the poet's view.\n\nAfterall, Samarqand and Bukhara were glorious in their heydays.\n\nNevertheless there is no mention of gold and gems and sweet maid and\n\nthe rest in Hafiz's couplet.\n\nI think, if at all possible, the translator should provide a literal\n\ntranslation along with the \"poetic\" or \"literary\" translation. But,\n\nthe latter still should not make unnnecessary additions to the\n\noriginal.\n\nYou have provided a number of examples from Ralph Russel's\n\ntranslations. I personally have never been keen on his translations.\n\nAs far as Farsi to Urdu translation is concerned, the reason why it\n\nseems relatively straight forward is because the two language's tense\n\nsystem essentially mirrors one another. There is a shared vocabulary\n\nand a person who understands both languages and poetry does not have\n\ntoo many problems translating the Farsi material. Even then, passing\n\nyour \"kasauTii\" would not be an easy matter!\n\nNaseer\n\n\n\n> http://groups.google.com/group/alt.language.urdu.poetry/browse_frm/th...\n\n\n\nNaseer sahib, aadaab-o-tasliimaat!\n\nI have been meaning to respond to this thread (an important topic in\n\nmy opinion) but just haven't had the time till now. I have a long pre-\n\namble, so I ask for ALUPers indulgence:-)\n\nLydia Davis's 'definitive' translation of Madam Bovary has just come\n\nout to much acclaim, but she has already been critiqued by Julian\n\nBarnes (somewhat of an authority on Flaubert and the author of\n\nFlaubert's Parrot). All previous translations have been deemed below\n\npar by Flaubertians for either being too literal, too flowery or too\n\ninterpretive. Madam Bovary is written in what one may call rustic\n\nFrench and it just doesn't translate that easily into English. Davis\n\nhas apparently gone to extraordinary lengths to create a suitable\n\nEnglish idiom to parallel the time and culture of Bovary. But it still\n\ndoesn't satisfy Barnes. (But he adds that people who are as picky as\n\nhe, will likely have read it in the original.)\n\nI have just finished reading Thousand Autumns of Jaocb de Zoet, a\n\nmasterpiece by David Mitchell. He has a unique style of writing,\n\ncreating the idiom of the time or culture about which he writes. There\n\nis many a passage in the book where the eponymous Dutch character\n\ninteracts with Japanese interpreters in English of late 19th century.\n\nHe then have English and Irish characters speaking in their idiom of\n\nthat era. He displays similar language 'tricks' in his other book\n\nCould Atlas which spans 3-4 centuries and the language changes\n\ndepending upon which chapter one is reading. I wonder how anyone can\n\never translate these subtleties of language into another language.\n\nThe earlier translations of War and Peace (by Maudes and Garnett etc.)\n\nhave all had their distractors, for either missing out some passages\n\ncompletely, omitting French passages, or rather than reproducing them\n\nverbatim, translating them. One earlier edition even had a translation\n\nof War and Peace from a French translation!! The problem now seems to\n\nhave been solved by Peaver & Volokhonsky, a husband and wife team. He\n\na master of English language and a poet to boot, and she, a native of\n\nUSSR but quite fluent in English. Now they are receiving something\n\nclose to respectful reviews as she is able to convey all the cultural\n\nand idiomatic nuances of the language and he then converts those into\n\nsimilar English phrases.\n\nThere is still lack of satisfaction about the title of Camus's\n\nL'tranger in English. Should it be The stranger, The Foreigner, or the\n\ncommonly used Outsider. Or how to translate the word 'maman' from the\n\nopening line. In French it is something between 'mother' and 'mum'.\n\nOne surely wouldn't write it as 'mum died today', but 'mother died to-\n\nday', the common translation, doesn't quite capture 'maman' of\n\n'Aujourd'hui, maman est morte'.\n\n(If Camus wanted 'mother', he would have said 'ma mere')\n\nPages have been written about whether Gregor Samsa of Kafka's\n\nMetamorphosis finds himself transformed into 'a beetle', 'a huge\n\ninsect' 'a giant bug' or a 'cockroach'? There just isn't a word in\n\nEnglish to capture the German original. Or what to call his other book\n\n'Der Prozess', literally the process, but more of a judicial process.\n\nSo most have settled on The Trial, not quite exact but 2nd best.\n\nI have opened with quite a few examples and if you are still reading,\n\nyou know where I am going. These are difficulties of translating prose\n\nfrom one language to another. Now multiply that 100 times and we are\n\ngetting somewhere closer to the difficulty of translating poetry. And\n\nwhen we have something as beautiful and unique as Urdu poetry, with\n\nits characteristic grammar, izaafaats and the structure of ghazal, I\n\nwill mostly be dissatisfied with English translations that endeavor to\n\ncapture it literally. How does one capture words like 'naseh'. 'vaiz',\n\n'saaqi', 'bulbul' etc. with all that they mean to an Urdu reader?\n\nForget about 'rahiin-e-sitam-haae-rozgaar' or 'turrah-e-pur-pech-o-\n\nKham ka pech-o-Kham'. Ralph Russel's example proves my point quite\n\nably. Now having said this, those who take the essence of the meaning\n\nof a couplet or the whole poem, and then render it into English, with\n\nthe sensibilities of English language, as Fitzgerald has done to Omar\n\nKhayyam's Farsi poetry, it becomes a little more acceptable, as one\n\ncan enjoy it as English poetry. 'The moving finger writes....' is a\n\nvery good example; it works well as English poetry and the fact that\n\nit is 'derived' from 'Khayyam', only adds to the charm!\n\nThe matter may be somewhat different when it comes to languages of\n\nIndo-Pak because of the shared roots and origins of so many words. I\n\nhave mentioned this example before but Mustafa Tabassum's rendering of\n\nGhalib's persian ghazal into Punjabi is particularly endearing, even\n\nthough he had to lengthen the meter to accommodate the full meaning. I\n\ndon't know Farsi but I have a book that translate this ghazal into\n\nEnglish and Urdu, so I am fairly conversant with the meaning. Mustafa\n\nTabbasum has done a wonderful job in that the ghazal stands on its own\n\nas much as a translation of Ghalib.\n\nI think I have said enough for the time being.\n\nBest regards,\n\nVijay\n\n\n\nNaseer sahib, I still haven't hit home, but once I am back,\n\ncomfortably ensconced, I promise to post the Ghalib ghazal as well as\n\nthe Khushwant Singh's Iqbal translation that I promised a while back.\n\nBut now that I am here, I would like to share an interesting anecdote.\n\nWhen I was young, around 10, my father used to recite a short Punjabi\n\npoem to inspire us kids to study at night. It was penned by a close\n\nacquaintance of his, I believe someone called Master Tara Singh*. The\n\npoem goes thus:\n\njo ucchtaaiiaaN vaDDiaan purshaaN hain jagat te paaiiaaN\n\nikko chhaal achanak laaiaaN, oh naahiiN hatth aaiiaaN\n\noh, jad ki unhaaN de saathii maar ghuraaRe sauNde\n\nvaDDii vaDDii raat tak sann karde rehan kamaaiian!!\n\nNow it wasn't until my early twenties that I came across the HW\n\nLongfellow 'version'. I remember getting a deja vu feeling when I\n\nfirst saw it, and it took me a minute or two to realize that Master\n\nTara Singh had actually translated the Longfellow piece. Here is the\n\noriginal (from memory, so may be a word wrong here or there):\n\nHeights that great men reached and kept\n\nWere not attained in a single flight\n\nBut they, when their companions slept\n\nWere toiling upward into the night!!\n\nPretty good translation I thought. So to add to my post above and\n\nstate the obvious, poems with simpler text can be translated with\n\nrelative ease whereas those requiring deeper, philosophical or\n\npsychologically complex thought or expressing ethno- or culture\n\nsensitive ideas will prove that much more difficult. (it is relatively\n\neasy to find a word for 'naseh' in English, say, preacher but\n\ndifficult to imbue it with the necessary condescension that Urdu\n\npoetry requires).\n\nBest,\n\nVijay\n\n* Here is a bonus, another one of Master Tara Singh (which I believe\n\nis an original and not a translation:-)).\n\nghain ghaaflii aaqilii lafz ikko\n\nwazn nuqtiaaN vicch na farq koii\n\nphir bhii nuqtiaaN de her pher kaaran\n\nsauaaN kohaaN dii ma'aniaaN vitth hoii\n\naiveN tatt te iNdrii aNgg saare\n\nsabbhe purshiaaN de ikko hain joii\n\naipar saNgat de thaaOn kuthaaOn sadqa\n\ntara singh hoiaa uuch niich soii\n\nVijay Sahib, aadaab 'arz hai\n\nOn Jan 21, 9:40 pm, Vijay <guz...@hotmail.com> wrote:\n\n> On Jan 21, 1:13 pm, Naseer <qures...@googlemail.com> wrote:\n\n>\n\n> > Vijay Sahib, aadaab 'arz hai.\n\n>\n\n> > I read your detailed post with a great amount of interest.

Very nice. In the fourth line...\n\nsauaaN kohaaN *de* ma'niyaaN vitth hoiii ?\n\nI am thinking on the lines of linking \"de\" with \"ma'niyaaN\" rather\n\nthan \"dii\" with \"vitthii\"\n\nNaseer\n\n\n\n\n\nNaseer Saheb,\n\nI think there is another alternate word (for \"kalaaN\") that is\n\nused in India. And it is \"Buzurg\". It is fairly evident that\n\nthe two words \"kalaaN\" and \"KHurd\" are used to differentiate\n\nbetween two similarly named small towns or villages, with refe-\n\nrence to their size. \"KHurd\" is used with both \"kalaaN\" and\n\n\"Buzurg\". There is no alternate for this word, AFAIK.\n\nAnd while talking about Telugu and Tamil, we seem to be forget-\n\nting Marathi. In the Maharashtra region, there are several\n\nsmall places where the word \"Budruk\" (as a Marathi variant of\n\n\"Buzurg\") is added to the actual name of that place. And,\n\n\"Budruk\" is not a typo. It really is spelt, in the D-script as\n\n\"Budruk\".\n\nFaarsi does seem to have left a deep impress on Marathi. This,\n\nin all probability, is due to the fact that this vast region was\n\nunder Mughal or Muslim control for a long time. Shivaji himself\n\nwas part of Emperor Aurangzeb's court (as a seh~hazaari courtier)\n\nfor some time. Later, he used to carry on his correspondence\n\nwith the Emperor in Faarsi. And his letters would carry the\n\nnormal honorific titles for the Emperor, as was the custom at\n\nthe time. I am not saying that Shivaji himself knew Faarsi quite\n\nwell, though it could have been the case. Probably, his entour-\n\nage or inner circle had people who were well-versed in Faarsi.\n\nEven today, Marathi language contains words that seem to be\n\nderived from Faarsi. But, I will not be able to give a list or\n\nexamples.\n\nAfzal\n\nOn Feb 12, 10:18 am, Naseer <qures...@googlemail.com> wrote:\n\n> Vijay Sahib, Good Morning!\n\nAadaab Naseer sahib:\n\nYou can enter the name in Google earth and zoom right in to Vazidke\n\nKhurd and kalaaN, but for some reason Google has spelt it Bazidke.\n\nSouth of it and slightly to the West is Barnala, my ancestral city,\n\nthe name of which also has Persian roots.

It was missing all\n\nthe z, sh, q, f, Kh sounds that were added much later by adding a\n\nnuqta underneath the equivalent letters; J with a nuqta underneath,\n\nfor example, became 'z'. For hundreds of years, however, trade\n\nbetween Persia and Panjab continued and Persian words and sounds were\n\nsimply converted to available Gurmukhi sounds. So Qismat was Kismat,\n\nbarfi, barphii etc. There were generations of Panjabis reared on\n\nGurmukhi script whose vocal chords just weren't equipped to pronounce\n\nthese sounds and they would always say saaki, jauk etc. After the\n\nadded letters, a slow change started to occur but to-date, people (me\n\nincluded) often over correct and can still call kaaba, qaaba; darjah,\n\ndarzah, for instance. So, yes, I agree, that these 'enthusiastic'\n\novercorrections are still all to common.\n\nRegards,\n\nVijay"
