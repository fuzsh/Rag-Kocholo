        "text": "Leader of Khalistan Commando Force\n\nFor the athlete, see Labh Singh (athlete).\n\nSukhdev Singh Dhillon (1952 – 12 July 1988), best known as General Labh Singh and also known as Sukha Sipahi and just Labh Singh, was a former Punjab police officer turned militant[1] who took command of the Khalistan Commando Force after its first leader, Manbir Singh Chaheru, was arrested in 1986.[2][3]\n\nHe was an associate of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who did many actions with Surinder Singh Sodhi and fought against the Indian Army during Operation Blue Star.[4] He was involved in the assassination of retired Chief of Army Staff Arun Vaidya and the attack on the Director-General of the Punjab Police, Julio Francis Ribeiro. He was involved in multiple assassinations of police, and government officials as well as targeted attacks on Communists. He allegedly masterminded[5] what was then India's largest bank robbery,[6] taking almost Rs. 60 million (About 1.023 billion rupees in 2023. About $12.5 million USD in 2023) from the Punjab National Bank, Miller Gunj branch, Ludhiana, as well as many other robberies[6][7][8] which enabled the Khalistan Commando Force to buy weapons.[9]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLabh Singh's original name was Sukhdev Singh Dhillon He was also known as Sukha Sipahi.[10] He lived in the village of Panjwar, in Tehsil (sub-district) Patti in district Tarn Taran[11][12][13] and owned 9 acres (36,000 m2) of land.[11][14] He married Davinder Kaur.[15]\n\nPunjab Police service\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter finishing his education at Baba Buddha Sahib College,[16] Labh Singh joined the Punjab Police force[17] in 1971[18] and served the force until he left his job in 1982.[18][19] According to other sources he left his job in 1983.[20]\n\nActions under Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale\n\n[edit]\n\nInfluenced by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, Labh Singh left the Punjab police in 1982 or 1983,[18][19] and joined the Sikh militant movement.[17]\n\nKilling Nirankari Star Resham Singh\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 27 October 1982, Labh Singh and Surinder Singh Sodhi killed Resham Singh. Resham was the Sant Nirankari head of Hoshiarpur District and 1 of the 7 Sant Nirankari stars which were the Sant Nirankari version of the Panj Pyare. Following the 1978 Sikh–Nirankari clash, which saw 13 Sikh killed and 150 injured,[21] Nirankari were expelled by the Akal Takht out of the Sikh fold and became a target of attacks.[22][23][24]\n\nSodhi and Labh Singh had disguised themselves as police. They had approached Resham posing as officers who just wanted to chat. As Resham was talking about Bhindranwale, supposedly negatively, Labh Singh and Sodhi pulled out stenguns and opened fire killing him instantly. It is said that Sodhi and Labh Singh fled on a Royal Enfield Bullet and fired victory shots.[25][26][24][27]\n\nKilling Deputy Inspector General A.S. Atwal\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 25 April 1983, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) A.S. Atwal was killed while leaving the Golden Temple. In the killing 2 others were critically injured.[28][29] Labh Singh was involved in the killing.[30] After Atwal was killed his driver and bodyguards quickly escaped. Other units stationed nearby also fled instead of taking any action. His death was celebrated by the other militants in the Temple who fired victory shots.[31] His corpse remained there for hours. Only after Punjab Chief Minister Darbara Singh phone Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and got his permission was Atwal’s body recovered.[29] A possible reason why Labh Singh killed Atwal was because he had killed 1 of Jarnail Singh’s men and injured 3 other men.[32] Another possible reason could be that Atwal was accused by Bhindranwale of stripping a Sikh women and parading her while one of Atwal’s men held her by the breast.[33]\n\nVarious attacks and assassinations\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 1 May 1983, Labh Singh and 2 other militants were accused of throwing a grenade at Inspector Harjit Singh’s home while driving by on a motorcycle. Harjit survived the explosion, but it caused great damage to the surrounding area.[34] Bhindranwale had accused Harjit of being involved in multiple extrajudicial executions of Sikhs and a “drinker of Sikh blood”.[33]\n\nOn 30 May 1983, Surinder Singh Sodhi along with Major Singh Nagoke and Labh Singh killed Inspector Bhagwan Singh Karianwala. He was gunned down in Sultanpur Lodhi in a busy market while patrolling. Bhagwan was killed along with his gunmen, a police constable. Sodhi, Labh and Nagoke grabbed the guns of the killed policemen, those being a Sten gun and revolver. Bhagwan had been accused by Bhindranwale as being one of the leading officers in the torture of Sikhs.[35][36][37][38][39][40]\n\nOn 15 August 1983, at around 1:15 PM Surinder Singh Sodhi, Major Singh Nagoke, and Labh Singh, from a motorcycle, opened fire on and killed Inspector Gurcharan Singh Sansi who was also on a motorcycle. Sansi was killed in Muktsar. Labh Singh had been targeting Sansi for some time. On August 15 he saw Sansi. Labh Singh and fellow militants had driven beside Sansi. Sodhi drove the motorcycle while Nagoke, and Labh Singh shot Sasi. His gunmen a police constable was shot, but managed to survive in an injured state. Both of their weapons were taken by Sodhi. Sodhi, Nagoke, and Labh Singh who drove away shouting \"Bole so Nihal; Sat Sri Akal\". Sansi had been accused of killing and \"drinking the blood\" of Sikhs by Bhindranwale. He was accused of being the leading officer in the torture of Sikhs.[41][42][43][44][45] A lyric from a famous dhadi ballad about this translates to, \"Three Singhs of the Guru came like a horse; At the opportunity they came to Mukhtsar and brought freedom; A new flag has been flown by the motorcyclewale. (Literally those who ride motorcycles; referring to Kharkus) Sansi was put on the car of death by motorcyclewale; Sansi was put on the train of death by the motorcyclewale.\"[46]\n\nOn 26 September 1983, Makhan Singh, a Sergeant of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Surjit Singh, was killed in Putlighar area of Amritsar outside of a hotel by Surinder Singh Sodhi and Labh Singh. Makhan had made his way to a hotel where Labh Singh and Sodhi were in disguise. Labh Singh and Sodhi had been hunting Makhan for some time. Sodhi upon recognising Makhan shouted, ”Makhan, run if you can, we have come to finish you off.” Makhan was shot in the shoulder by Labh Singh. He ran out of the hotel and attempted to flee, but failed to do so and was killed outside with a spray of bullets in his head and chest. Sodhi and Labh Singh made a quick getaway. Police conducted multiple searches to find them, but they proved futile. Makhan had been on hit list of militants for much time. Makhan had been named by Sant Jarnail Singh as someone who was an enemy of Sikhs. He was also accused of being part of the torture and extrajudicial execution of Kulwant Singh Nagoke. Jarnail Singh accused him of 13 extrajudicial killings.[47][48][33][49][26][27][50][51][52][53] A famous lyric from a Kavishari song about this incident translates to, “Makhan was doing great sins regularly; his death came beautifully.”[26][54]\n\nOn 29 October 1983, Surinder Singh Sodhi with Makhan Singh Babbar and Labh Singh attacked retired DSP (Deputy Superintendent of Police) Gurbachan Singh also known as Bachan Singh. Gurbachan was at a shop owned by his son.[55][56]Sodhi and the others first disguised themselves as police officers. They then made their way to Gurbachan.[55] Sodhi, Makhan, and Labh attacked Gurbachan and his security with Sten guns. The attack turned into a 30 minute shootout with a constable and salesmen being killed. A head constable, Karnail Singh, would later die of his wounds. Gurbachan lived by taking cover and playing dead.[57][58][59] Surinder Singh Sodhi was injured in the attack. Makhan Singh was also injured in the attack and would receive blood from Manbir Singh Chaheru to live.[59] Gurbachan Singh had tortured Amrik Singh[60]He also had tortured Kulwant Singh Nagoke and after killed him in an extrajudicial execution.[61] He was also involved in other extrajudicial executions. He had been named by Jarnail Singh as an enemy of the Panth and someone who, \"..drank Sikh blood\".[62]\n\nOn 9 March 1984 Labh Singh along with Surinder Singh Sodhi, and Gurmit Singh alias Sukha attacked the motorcade of Deputy Speaker of the Haryana Legislative Assembly Ved Pal. Ved Pal was attacked when he was going from Delhi to Karnal. MLA Shanti Devi was along with Ved Pal at the time of the attack. Labh Singh and his associates opened fire from a motorcycle with Sten guns. The driver was killed, and a gunman seriously injured. Others escaped with minor injuries.[63][64]\n\nKilling BJP MLA Harbans Lal Khanna\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 2 April 1984, Surinder Singh Sodhi[65] along with Labh Singh[30] killed former MLA Harbans Lal Khanna in his shop in Amritsar. Khanna was the BJP district president at the time. His bodyguard and 1 or 2 customers of his shop were also killed. Sodhi and Labh Singh also burned down a police jeep by Khanna’s shop.[66][67] Sodhi and Labh Singh had posed as police officers. Sodhi waited outside on a motorcycle as Labh Singh entered the shop. Labh Singh opened fire with a stengun killing Khann’s bodyguard and others, all of whom wete sitting. Khanna shouted frantically. Labh Singh said, “Dhoti, topi (hat), at Yamuna. Long live Khalistan.” He then killed Khanna.[26][68][69][70]\n\nKhanna had raised slogans translating to, “We are not going to let any second or third group exist, we are not going to let a turban remain on any head; the kacchera, the kara, the kirpan, send these to Pakistan\".[66][71][72] In February 1984 he led a mob that destroyed a replica of the Golden Temple at Amristar railway station and put feces and lit cigarettes on a painting of Guru Ram Das which had been on display for many years.[66] All of this had made him a prime target for Sikhs.[67]\n\nThe killing of Khanna led to a 48 hour curfew in Amritsar and paramilitary and army deployment to the city. Soon rioting also broke out.[73] The riots left at least 7 dead.[74]\n\nA famous lyric from a Kavishari song about this incident translates to, “Jago (Referring to Sikh revolution) made Harbans Lal Khanna spill red. Don’t go against the words of Singhs. Those who did have been “taught”(killed). Kara, kachera, will remain here; Your (Harbnas Lal Khanna) evening has been brought. Jago has arrived; From where did it come; From Bhindranwale Sant; The motorcyclewale have moved it forward”.[26][54]\n\nPursuing CM Bhajan Lal\n\n[edit]\n\nLabh Singh and Sodhi were given the duty of killing Bhajan Lal the Chief Minister of Haryana by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Bhajan Lal had started the construction of SYL which was opposed by Sikh. Bhajan Lal as head of the Haryana government in November 1982 had Sikh indiscriminately stopped, searched, and humiliated who planned to hold a protest at the Delhi Asia Games.[75][76] Bhindranwale blamed Bhajan Lal for rioting against Sikh in Haryana during early 1984. The rioting saw the burning of 24 saroops of Guru Granth Sahib, 6 Gurdwaras, shaving 125 Sikh, and stripping 3 Sikh girls. All of this made Bhajan Lal a key target.[77][78][79] Once Sodhi, and Labh were in range of shooting Bhajan Lal, but had been ordered to chop off Bhajan Lal's head by Bhindranwale. Because of there devotion to honour Bhindranwale's words they left Bhajan Lal.[80] Before being able to assassinate Bhajan Lal Sodhi would he killed. Bhindranwale would later claim that Bhajan Lal would be killed if Sodhi lived 15 days more.[78]\n\nRevenge for Surinder Singh Sodhi\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 14 April 1984 Surinder Singh Sodhi, one of Labh Singh’s closest friends and the “right-arm” of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, was killed while drinking tea in a shop in Amritsar.[81][82] Sodhi was killed by a men and a women. The women, Baljit Kaur, would go to the Golden Temple after the killing and confessed to the murder.[83] Baljit Kaur was interrogated by Bhidnranwale. She admitted to the other killer being her boyfriend Surinder Singh Shinda, and to being paid by Gurcharan Singh, the general secretary of Akali Dal, to do the killing. She also implicated others.[81] Bhindranwale vowed to avenge the killing.[84] With this Labh Singh and fellow militants made their way to punish those who they deemed to be the culprits. Labh Singh and others killed Surinder Singh Shinda. He was chopped into 7 pieces for shooting Sodhi 7 times. He was killed within 24 hours of Bhindranwale vowing vengeance.[81][85][26][86][87]\n\nAmritsar bank robbery\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 23 April 1984, Labh Singh and fellow militants robbed 44,583 rupees (About 12,000 USD) from Punjab and Sind bank in Amritsar. It was described as a “clean-operation” while also being described as “spontaneous”.[88][89][90]\n\nKilling of Deputy Superintendent of Police Gurbachan Singh\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 30 April 1984, retired Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Gurbachan Singh, also known as Bachan Singh, was killed along with his wife, daughter, and a gunman in Amritsar.[91][92] The killers were Labh Singh and Major Singh Nagoke.[30][93] Gurbachan Singh had survived 4 previous attacks on his life and was a prime target of Sikhs.[94] Gurbachan Singh had tortured Amrik Singh[95] He also had tortured Kulwant Singh Nagoke and after killed him in a extrajudicial execution.[96] He was also involved in other extrajudicial executions. He had been named by Jarnail Singh as an enemy of the Panth and someone who, “..drank Sikh blood”.[97]\n\nA famous lyric from a kavishari ballad about this translates to, “The sinner DSP Gurbachan became the target of Jago; (Sikh revolution) The sinner DSP Gurbachan became the target of Jago; The sinner was bound to die; That saala (Inbreeder) was bound to die he sat with his family; The sinner was going to die; he sat with his family; Jago has cleaned the world of the wife, niece, son.”[54]\n\nAttempted assassination of former CM Darbara Singh\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to an alleged confession by a militant in May, 1984, Labh Singh and fellow militants led by Amarjeet Singh Chawla plotted to assassinate former Chief Minister of Punjab Darbara Singh.

The report stated that 2 police holding a 4th prisoner were also gunned down, and that \"Three other officers, a lawyer, and a bystander were wounded as the Sikhs sprayed the area for 15 minutes.\" Police said that the guards were too frightened to return fire. This fourth suspect remained in custody. Finally, the Courier article reported that the Sikhs looted \"three rifles and a submachine gun\" from the dead bodies, and that a 6th officer later succumbed to wounds from the attack.[113]\n\nThe \"Wilmington Morning Star\" carried an AP story, and related that 3 \"Sikh extremists\" killed 4 police officers inside the District Court complex, killed two officers who \"were shot at the courtyard gate as the attackers fled\", and wounded 4 other individuals, including a lawyer.

The DSP had been accused of harassing Sikhs and families of militants.[152]\n\nAssassination of Inspector General Trilok Chand Katoch\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 11, 1987, Jinda and a fellow militant of the Khalistan Commando Force assassinated Inspector General Trilok Chand Katoch. A note was left stamped by Labh Singh taking responsibility and warning other officers.[153] Katoch was killed in 3 shoots near his home in Chandigarh. Jinda and another fled on a scooter. Katoch was the highest ranking police official to be killed up to that point.[154] Katoch was one in charge of Punjab Prisons until late 1986 when he was put in charge of “overseeing internal discipline and enforcing administrative rules”. KCF claimed responsibility in a phone call and threatened to strike again.[155] Jinda reavled the reasons why Katoch was assassinated in his letters. According to him Katoch had tortured Sikhs and falsely imprisoned them. Most notably he tortured Nachitar Singh Rode, the assassin of Lala Jagat Narain.[151]\n\nIndia's biggest bank robbery\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 1987 Labh Singh allegedly masterminded[5] what was at that time the largest bank robbery in Indian history, netting almost 60 million (58 million rupees About 1.023 billion rupees in 2023. – US $4.5 million About US $12.5 million in 2023) from the Millar Ganj branch of the Punjab National Bank, Ludhiana;[5] a part of this stolen money belonged to the Reserve Bank of India, India's central bank.[6][7] It was documented as the \"Biggest Bank Robbery\" under \"Curiosities and wonders\" in the Limca Book of Records.[156] The loot enabled the Khalistan Commando Force to buy sophisticated weapons[157] and AK-47 rifles.[9] Sikh militants often used bank robberies to finance their campaign against the Indian government.[6]\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reported that \"12 to 15 Sikhs dressed as policemen and armed with submachine guns and rifles escaped with nearly $4.5 million in the biggest bank robbery in Indian history.\" \"No one was injured.\" A Police spokesman described it as \"a neat and clean operation\".[7]\n\nKhalistan Commando Force members who allegedly participated in the robbery included Harjinder Singh Jinda, Mathra Singh,[158] Paramjit Singh Panjwar,[159] Satnam Singh Bawa,[160] Gurnam Singh Bundala,[161] Sukhdev Singh Sukha, Daljit Singh Bittu,[162][163][164] Gursharan Singh Gamma[162][163] and Pritpal Singh.[165]\n\nFreeing Harjinder Singh Jinda\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 30, 1987 Harjinder Singh Jinda, who had assassinated Lalit Maken, Arjun Dass, General Vaidya, and others, was being transported by police. 15 KCF members, who were armed with submachine guns and pistols, surrounded a rouge police van and blocked the front and back with two vehicles. They demanded Jinda be released or they would open fire. Jinda was released and the militants fled.[166][167]\n\nSikh moral code\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late March 1987 KCF issued a 13 policy Sikh moral code which all were to adhere to. The polices were to end dancing at weddings, end music at weddings, end to the wearing of non-traditional clothing, no tweezing of eyebrows for girls, no snipping of beards for boys, no baraats that include more than 11 people, no participation in Hindu jagratas or all-night prayers, no associating with Radhasoami Sikhs, no school uniforms that are not saffron black, and white and the end of the sale and consumption of meat, alcohol and tobacco.[168][169]\n\nThose who did not respect the law were warned that they would be burnt alive. The code was largely followed. Sikh women began wearing traditional clothing and many meat, alcohol, and tobacco shops closed. Many restaurants brought in vegetarian items to the menu. Some did not follow the decree which put them in danger. Those who did not follow were forced to either pay off Sikhs or get security. Sikh leaders generally supported the decree. The enforcement of the decree in its first 2 months resulted in at least 6 killed, 60 shops burned, and complete or partial closure of 1,500 businesses.[169][168]\n\nOne survey found that there were no meat or cigarette shops between Amritsar and Phagwara. Famous restaurants that served meat had removed it from their menu and denied ever serving it.[168]\n\nAccording to Assistant Deputy Inspector General of Police in Jalandhar A.S. Siddiqui the moral code had great popular among Sikhs especially those living in the rural area. He said, “Women seem to be pleased with it and there is also the fact that the AISSF has been on a massive recruitment drive through their amrit prachar (preaching of Sikh baptism) meetings. There is one meeting a day in the state, and after every meeting an estimated 200 youths pledge themselves to the service of the panth.\"[168]\n\nMilitants justified the moral code by saying, \"No avatars, Hindu or Sikh, ever did these things. To eat meat is the job of rakshasas (demons) and we don't want people to become rakshasas.\"[168]\n\nCourt Attack\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 27, 1987 KCF members attacked a court in Amritsar and freed 3 KCF members, Ranjit Singh Rana, Kanwarjit Singh, and Rajbinder Singh. KCF members drove two vans into the guarded court complex and opened fire on officers transporting prisoners. The attack lasted 3 minutes with the KCF members spraying the police with bullets.

Darshan, before retiring, was the bodyguard of DSP Gurbachan who Labh Singh had killed. Darshan had also been accused by Bhindranwale of killing innocent Sikhs.[174][175]\n\nOn September 21, 1987 Sulakhan Singh revealed that he had been attacked and left for dead.

He suffered many wounds, but none were life threatening. Sulakhan denied being a police informant. Sulakhan also had police security.[176]\n\nKilling police informants\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 12, 1987 KCF claimed responsibility for the killing of Mohinder Kaur, her two daughters, and a house worker for being police informants.[177]\n\nOn March 30, 1988, KCF killed Naranjan Singh in Dilwan for being a police informant.[178]\n\nKilling of Communists\n\n[edit]\n\nCommunists were targeted by many Sikh militant organizations and leaders. They were especially targeted by Labh Singh. Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale called them the \"arch enemies of the panth,\"[179]\n\nIn September 1986 KCF, whose leader was Labh Singh, killed Darshan Singh Canadian an MLA and party leader of the Communist Party of India.[180] Darshan Singh opposed Sikh militants and Khalistan supporting NRI Sikhs. He actively campaigned against both.[181]\n\nIn September 1986 KCF members under Labh Singh also killed Baldev Singh Mann. He was a left-wing activist of the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) New Democracy. He was a state level leader of Kirti Kisan Union and the editor of Hirawal Dasta[182][183] Baldev was gunned down by 4 men in his home village near Amritsar. He was walking with his brother who escaped unhurt.[184][180]\n\nOn February 16, 1987, Harjinder Singh Jinda killed Communist Party of India (Marxist) veteran leader and MLA Chanan Singh near Hoshiarpur. In a letter to the media Jinda said that Dhoot committed blasphemy and spoke out against Sikhs.[185][186]\n\nOn May 19, 1987 Gurdeep Singh Deepa and other KCF members under Labh Singh killed Deepak Dhawan who was the State Committee member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Dhawan was riding his scooter near Sanghe. KCF members approached him and told him to try and run. He tried to run, but they shot him as he tried.[187][188][189][190][191]\n\nOn July 22, 1987 KCF members under Labh Singh entered the farmhouse of Swaran Singh an official and vice president of the Amritsar district of the Communist Party of India. They went to where he slept with his family and opened fire. Swaran Singh, his wife. his mother, and his daughter were all killed in the fire. Swaran Singh's two other daughters were wounded, but his 5 year old son was unhurt. They also opened fire at the porch killing a worker, and injuring two others. A note was left claiming responsibility and saying it was over Swaran Singh's protests against the Sikh militants and Khalistan.[192][193]\n\nUnder Labh Singh in 1987 KCF members on motorcycles shot dead Communist Party of India (Marxist) member Dr. Gurdial Singh.[194][195]\n\nOn March 13, 1988 at Kalchian, 25 kilometres from Amritsar, 4 KCF members stormed the homes of Communist Party of India members. The 2 party members were taken by them and were forced to disclose the location of the village head. After reaching the home of the village leader the 2 party members were killed along with the village leader. The village leader was killed for his support of Rajiv Gandhi and participation in anti Khalistan rallies organised by Gandhi.[196]\n\nOn March 17, 1988 Jaimal Singh Padha was assassinated by KCF members under Labh Singh. He was a leader of the Kirti Kisan Union, a Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation front. Jaimal had written against religious communalism which angered Sikh militants. In one of his essays, he also spoke against Khalistan.[197]\n\nOn March 23, 1988 Pash, whose real name was Avtar Singh Sandhu, was killed by KCF members under Labh Singh. Pash was a supporter of the \"ultra leftist Naxalite movement\". He would write in support of communism and was a vocal critic of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Labh Singh is said to have regretted this killing in his diary.[198][199][200]\n\nDeath and aftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 1988, the Panthic committee appointed Labh Singh a high priest,[105] but on 12 July 1988 he was killed[201][202] in an encounter with police near Tanda, Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India.[105][203][204][205] He had a bounty of 100,000 rupees at the time. (Around 1,120,000 rupees in 2023. Around 14,000 USD in 2023)[30]\n\nAt that time, he was wanted in relation to the murder of a dozen policemen, newspaper editor Ramesh Chander, and an attempt on the former Punjab Police Chief Julio Francis Ribeiro.[105] Amritsar Police Superintendent Suresh Arora said \"We have broken the back of the KCF. Sukhdev Singh was the most dreaded of the terrorists.\"[105]\n\nA 8 page note found on the dead body of Labh Singh had said that militants need to target politicians and officers and not innocent civilians. The not also said, “Achieving Khalistan will be no joke. It will not be a short period simple affair… \"We should restrict our targets to political leaders, police officers and their informers and to those staunchly opposed to Khalistan.”[206]\n\nThe Tribune of India carried a report of a neighbor's statement that, after his death, many of his family emigrated to Canada, though his father-in-law stayed on in Labh Singh's house. The neighbor further stated that the father-in-law committed suicide after police beat him \"mercilessly\", and that the house then remained deserted for several years, but that finally it has been taken over by his relatives.[17]\n\nUpon news of Labh Singh's death Gurbachan Singh Manochahal and Wassam Singh Zaffarwal issued statements saying,\" In the struggle begun by Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale to liberate the Sikh nation, General Bhai Labh Singh sacrificed his life. The bhog ceremony and Akhand Path will take place in his native village Panjwar, near Jhabal, on the 21st. We appeal to all sangats to attend the bhog ceremony in large numbers.\"[207]\n\nAvtar Singh Brahma and Sukhdev Singh Babbar issued statements saying, \"'One who dies in the battlefield is great. One who runs away takes birth again and again.' General Bhai Labh Singh acted on the words 'In the end one has to sacrifice one's life in the battlefield when all other means have failed.' The bhog ceremony and Akhand path will take place in his native village of Panjwar 21 July 1988. We appeal to the Sarbat Khalsa to attend the last Ardas of this brave soldier.\"[207]\n\nAfter Labh Singh’s death many Ardas and bhogs were done across the globe by Sikh diaspora.[208]\n\nKanwaljit Singh Sultanwind succeeded Labh Singh as leader of the KCF.[13]\n\nFollowing Labh Singh’s death Gian Surjit Singh, a well known dhadi, wrote and composed a tribute to Labh Singh which sold very well. It was sung in Gurdwaras and Sikh camps for youth all across England.[209] The main verse of the song translated to, “In place of 7 bullets we will blow up 100 bombs. By getting revenge for Labh Singh we will show them.”[209]\n\nThe Tribune India reported in July 2006 that a Bhog (Sikh religious ceremony) for Labh Singh was held \"in the past few months\".[210]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nKhalistan Movement\n\nList of actions attributed to KCF\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nMahmood, Cynthia Keppley (1997).
