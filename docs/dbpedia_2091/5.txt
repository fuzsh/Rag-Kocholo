1. Use of Semantic Wiki Tool to Build a Repository of Reusable Information Objects in Agricultural Education and Extension : results from a preliminary study Pritpal Kaur, Shelly Patwar, Gerard Sylvester, V Balaji * * [email_address]

2. Scenario Today : a twin challenge Agricultural content is often dispersed and there is no unified view to integrate the resources. Unified view is badly needed. Multiple challenges in localization, customization and delivery to extension workers and educators.

3. Towards a Solution….. Semantic Tools provide for Knowledge Representation & Sharing Unified knowledge/resource organization model feasible– can provide integrated view Specialized and enhanced navigation Can provide for rapid information aggregation from reusable information objects

4. ICRISAT experiment : objective Better, more efficient extraction from, and aggregation of, agricultural information resources , along with Better Content Navigation Better Content Organization

5. Tools and methods Content Organization ( Semantic Mediawiki (primary) & Topic Map (secondary)) Content Packaging ( eXe Editor ) Content Navigation (Topic Maps & Semantic Mediawiki)

6. Sources of Content: Wikipedia and VASAT Web site Virtual Academy for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( VASAT ) is a strategic alliance of National and International partners aimed at combating drought in the Semi-Arid Tropics. Generates literacy-style content online (www.icrisat.org/vasat/learning_resources)

7. Semantic VASAT Wiki Ingredients + + = FAO’s AGROVOC provides the Ontology to link information objects in the Wiki facilitated by OntoWorld’s Semantic Tool Semantic Tool MediaWiki S/w FAO’s AGROVOC Semantic VASAT Wiki http://vasatwiki.icrisat.org

8. Process with Semantic MediaWiki + Ontology Uploaded agricultural content onto VASAT wiki from Wikipedia Uploaded learning modules from VASAT Learning Objects Repository Categorized content according to AGROVOC Manually divided available articles into information objects Created semantic relationships

9. Process Workflow Curation Semantic VASAT Wiki Version Staging Agriculture article Extract Agricultural Articles Wiki + Semantic tool + Ontology Community Review http://vasatwiki.icrisat.org/ Information objects VASAT LO Repository AGROVOC Ontologies, categorization

10. Information Objects on VASAT Wiki Wikipedia Article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peanut VASAT Wiki Article http://vasatwiki.icrisat.org/index.php/Groundnut Article extracted and Semantic links established manually 1 2 3 4

11. Topic Map for VASAT’s Learning Objects VASAT LO repository AGROVOC Content Ontology ICRISAT’s Crop Topic Map Available at: http://test2.icrisat.org/

12. Aggregate Resources Content aggregated from VASAT Wiki Content from external Website Integrate content from various sources Content aggregated thus could also be exported to various formats

13. Wiki Article External Website Aggregate Content Content Aggregation from different sources using eXe Export Content 1 2 3 4

14. Content Repurposing Content repackaging and repurposing for export to many formats ( compatible with SCORM, IMS-global for LMS and as HTML and to i-POD )
