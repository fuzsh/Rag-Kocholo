        "text": "On this day in 1486, the original Tudor king, Henry VII, took a Yorkist bride - uniting the two conflicting families of the Wars of the Roses - the Yorkists and the Lancastrians. This was a wise move, considering the years of fighting the two families had just been through. Between the conflicting suitors of the English throne, Richard III (the king at the time) and Henry Tudor, it was a long and bloody journey to the end of the Plantagenet dynasty and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. Once Henry Tudor was crowned on the Battle of Bosworth battlefield and became King Henry VII, he had to think about taking a wife and starting a dynasty. His choice was smart - Elizabeth of York was from the other family, but she was beautiful, young, and descended from a very fertile family of women, including her grandmother Jacquetta of Luxembourg (who had fourteen children) and her mother Elizabeth Woodville (who had twelve children). Henry recognized the importance of taking a Yorkist bride, in order to strengthen his claim to the throne and to weaken any other Yorkist's claim.\n\nHowever, Henry Tudor had no intention of sharing power on the English throne - no matter who his wife was. He may marry Elizabeth, but she would not be a joint monarch. So, he organized his coronation for 30 October 1485, before his wedding. A papal dispensation was required, because Henry did not want Elizabeth's own legitimacy for the crown called into question. He named Edward V as his predecessor and the two were married on 18 January 1486. Elizabeth immediately proved to be a successful Tudor wife, because nine months later, the married couple's first child was born - Arthur Tudor, the Prince of Wales. On 25 November 1487, Elizabeth was crowned queen consort.\n\nElizabeth \"was one of the beauties of her age,\" with classic English Rose looks - blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair skin - the quintessential English beauty of the time period. She was also apparently quite attractive in her character. Henry was reportedly tall, slim, dark haired, and handsome in the prime of his life. At the time of their marriage, they were probably thought to be the perfect couple. They were young, beautiful, and seemingly pure of heart. They were the founders of a new soon-to-be powerful English dynasty, and they were immediately a success. During the course of their marriage, Elizabeth would give birth to eight children - four of whom would live. Arthur, Margaret, Henry, and Mary would be those lucky four and would all make impressive marriages - though Arthur would not live long enough to take over the impressive dynasty that his parents had created. Instead, it would be the younger son, Henry, who would become the next Tudor monarch - the notorious Henry VIII.\n\nThere are virtually no details that I can easily find about the wedding ceremony between these two important figures, but from what I've read, the ceremony was happy and grand - as would be expected of a brand new monarch and his bride. There are many more details about these two after their wedding - with their children and their seemingly perfect marriage. Of course, in this time period, no marriage was perfect, but this one seems to be a pretty good model for future Tudor marriages."
