IPA [ɐ'fõsu]; rare English alternatives: Alphonzo or Alphonse), or Affonso (Archaic Portuguese), Alfonso or Alphonso (Portuguese-Galician) or Alphonsus (Latin), the Bolognian (Port. o Bolonhês) or the Brave (Port. o Bravo), the fifth King of Portugal (May 5, 1210 in Coimbra – February 16, 1279 in Alcobaça, Coimbra or Lisbon) and the first to use the title King of Portugal and the Algarve, since 1249. He was the second son of King Afonso II of Portugal and his wife, Urraca, princess of Castile; he succeeded his brother, King Sancho II of Portugal on January 4, 1248.\n\nAs the second son of King Afonso II of Portugal, Afonso was not expected to inherit the throne, which was destined to go to his elder brother Sancho. He lived mostly in France, where he married Matilda, the heiress of Boulogne, in 1238, thereby becoming Count of Boulogne. In 1246, conflicts between his brother, the king, and the Catholic church became unbearable. Pope Innocent IV then ordered Sancho II to be removed from the throne and be replaced by the Count of Boulogne. Afonso, of course, did not refuse the papal order and left Boulogne for Portugal. Since Sancho was not a popular king, the order was not hard to enforce; he was exiled to Castile and Afonso III became king in 1248 after his brother's death. To ascend the throne, he abdicated from his office as Count of Boulogne and later (1253) divorced Matilda.\n\nPortuguese Royalty\n\nHouse of Burgundy Afonso Henriques (Afonso I)\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Mafalda\n\nInfanta Urraca, Queen of Léon\n\nInfante Sancho (future Sancho I)\n\nInfanta Teresa, Countess of Flanders and Duchess of Burgundy\n\nSancho I\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Teresa, Queen of Castile\n\nInfanta Sancha, Lady of Alenquer\n\nInfanta Constança\n\nInfante Afonso (future Afonso II)\n\nInfante Pedro, Count of Urgell\n\nInfante Fernando, Count of Flanders\n\nInfanta Branca, Lady of Guadalajara\n\nInfanta Berengária, Queen of Denmark\n\nInfanta Mafalda, Queen of Castile\n\nAfonso II\n\nChildren include\n\nInfante Sancho (future Sancho II)\n\nInfante Afonso, Count of Boulogne (future Afonso III)\n\nInfanta Leonor, Queen of Denmark\n\nInfante Fernando, Lord of Serpa\n\nSancho II Afonso III\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Branca, Viscountess of Huelgas\n\nInfante Dinis (future Denis I)\n\nInfante Afonso, Lord of Portalegre\n\nInfanta Maria\n\nInfanta Sancha\n\nDenis\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Constança, Queen of Castile\n\nInfante Afonso (future Afonso IV)\n\nAfonso IV\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Maria, Queen of Castile\n\nInfante Pedro (future Peter I)\n\nInfanta Leonor, Queen of Aragon\n\nPeter I\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Maria, Marchioness of Tortosa\n\nInfante Fernando (future Ferdinand I)\n\nInfanta Beatriz, Countess of Alburquerque\n\nInfante João, Duke of Valencia de Campos\n\nInfante Dinis, Lord of Cifuentes\n\nJohn, Grand Master of the Order of Aviz (future John I) (natural son)\n\nFerdinand I\n\nChildren include\n\nInfanta Beatrice, Queen of Castile and Leon (future Beatrice I of Portugal)\n\nBeatrice (disputed queen)\n\nChildren include\n\nInfante Miguel of Castile and Portugal\n\nDetermined not to commit the same mistakes as his brother, Afonso III paid special attention to what the middle class, composed of merchants and small land owners, had to say. In 1254, in the city of Leiria, he held the first session of the Cortes, a general assembly comprising the nobility, the middle class and representatives of all municipalities. He enacted laws intended to restrain the upper classes from abusing the least favored part of the population. Remembered as a noteworthy administrator, Afonso III founded several towns, granted the title of city to many others and reorganized public administration throughout his kingdom.\n\nReconquest\n\nSecure on the throne, Afonso III then proceeded to make war with the Moor communities that still thrived on the southern Iberian Peninsula. In his reign the Algarve became part of the kingdom, following the capture of Faro. Portugal thus became the first Iberian kingdom to complete its Reconquista.\n\nFollowing his success against the Moors, Afonso III had to deal with the political situation and border dispute with Castile. The neighboring kingdom considered the newly acquired lands of the Algarve should be Castilian, not Portuguese, which led to a series of wars between the two kingdoms. Finally, in 1267, a treaty was signed in Badajoz, which determined that the southern border between Castile and Portugal should be the River Guadiana.\n\nMarriages and descendants\n\nAfonso's first wife was Matilda II of Boulogne, daughter of Renaud, Count of Dammartin, and Ida of Boulogne. She had two sons (Roberto and an unnamed one), but both died young. He divorced Matilda in 1253 and, in the same year, married Beatrix of Castile, illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X, King of Castile, and Maria de Guzman.\n\nName Birth Death Notes By Matilda II of Boulogne (c. 1202-1262; married in 1216) Infante Roberto (Robert) 1239 1239 By Beatrix of Castile (1242-1303; married in 1253) Infanta Branca (Blanche) February 25, 1259 April 17 1321 Abbess of the Convent of Huelgas Infante Fernando (Ferdinand) 1260 1262 Infante Dinis (Denis) October 9, 1261 January 7, 1325 Succeeded him as Denis, 6th King of Portugal.

He is best remembered for completing the reconquest of the West of the Iberian peninsula, that is, of Portugal, and for the style of his government. At a time when many kings saw themselves as ruling more or less by divine right, Afonso III was prepared to share responsibility for governing Portugal. He convened the first ever meeting of a Portuguese Parliament, the Cortes, in which common citizens as well as aristocrats took part. Afonso III appears to have had a genuine concern for the welfare of his most vulnerable subjects, recognizing that they had human rights. Those who helped Alfonso III regain political control of the whole of the Algarve, the southernmost portion of Portugal and helped in the reconquest now felt that they too deserved recognition, despite their not being members of the social elite. Afonso III's contribution to the development of more participatory, egalitarian governance was modest although remarkable for his era. His consideration of his peoples sowed seeds that bore fruit of democracy in Portugal's later history.\n\nHouse of Burgundy\n\nCadet Branch of the Capetian dynasty\n\nBorn: 5 May 1210; Died: 16 February 1279 Preceded by:\n\nSancho II King of Portugal\n\n1248 – 1279 Succeeded by: Denis Preceded by:\n\nMoorish rulers King of the Algarves\n\n1249 – 1279\n\nReferences\n\nISBN links support NWE through referral fees"
