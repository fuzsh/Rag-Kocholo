Once widowed, in 1197 she left the court and retired with her daughter Doña Dulce to the Monastery of Santa Maria di Sijena, which she had founded in 1188, where she took her vows and assumed the cross of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem which she wore until hear death. For this reason she is revered in Aragon as the Holy Queen. For the Catholic Church she is a Servant of God and her liturgical memorial is November 9th."
