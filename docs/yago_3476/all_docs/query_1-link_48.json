        "text": "EARLY CONQUESTS\n\n136 AD The Romans conquer the Iberian Peninsula after the native population, Luzitans, have already been occupied by Celts, Greeks and Carthaginians. They call the territory of present day Portugal Lusitania.\n\n482 CE The only documented record of Jewish settlement although the Jews were in the Iberian Peninsula as traders etc. along with the Greeks, Carthaginians and certainly with the Romans.\n\n5th century After the fall of Rome tribes of Swabians and Visigoths occupy the Peninsula.\n\nJews are persecuted by the Visigoths and other Christian rulers.\n\n711 Moors from North Africa conquer the peninsula.\n\nThe Moorish invasion is seen by many of the Jewish population as liberation and it is marked as the beginning of the Golden Age of Jewish culture even though under Muslim rule Jews, as well as Christians, were considered Dhimmi and had to pay a special tax.\n\nCHRISTIAN RETURN\n\n718 The Christian war of Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula begins.\n\nThe Jews are used by the Christians both as spies and diplomats in the campaign that takes centuries. While subject to prejudice, they are respected.\n\nBy 9th century The region of Portucale, north of Mondego is liberated.\n\n1087 King of Castille and Leon, Alfonso VI, asks French knights to help him reconquer Castile and La Mancha. After defeating the Moors he marries his daughter Tareja to the French kingâs nephew, Henry of Burgundy who becomes the first Count of Portugal. After Henryâs death Tareja reigns, to be overthrown by her son Alfonso Henriques.\n\n1139 Alfonso Henriques breaks the bonds of vassalage to Castille, proclaiming himself King Alfonso I of Portugal.\n\nAlfonso I appoints Yahia Ben Yahi III as supervisor of tax collection and nominates him Chief Rabbi of Portugal. Alfonsoâs son Sancho I of Portugal will make the grandson of Yahia Ben Yahi High Steward of the realm.\n\nPORTUGUESE INDEPENDENCE\n\n1143 Castille agrees to Portugalâs independence.\n\n1174 the Crown of Aragon recognised independence of Portugal\n\n1279-1325 King Dinis I founds the University of Coimbra. While the monarch is protective towards the Jews, after the Fourth Lateran Council, the clergy starts to exert pressure on them. He also establishes what will become Lisbon's Large Jewish Quarter.\n\n1373 First Treaty of Alliance with England is signed in London.\n\n1383 King Ferdinand I marries his only daughter Beatriz to the King of Castile Juan I.\n\nTHE ERA OF DISCOVERY\n\n1383 After Ferdinand Iâs death his son-in-law, Juan of Castile, claims the succession but his bastard brother is proclaimed King of Portugal under the name Joao I by the Cortes in Coimbra and defeats Juan in battle. Joao marries Philippa of Lancaster which seals the alliance with England.\n\nUp to the 15th century some Jews achieve prominence in Portuguese political and economic life. Isaac Abarbanel is treasurer to King Alfonso V. Many are important in Portuguese cultural life and are recognised as skilled diplomats and merchants. By this time Lisbon and Evora have important Jewish communities.\n\n1415 Joao I captures the port of Ceuta in Morocco. Battling it out in Morocco, his sons put an end to the attacks of the Barbary pirates on the Portuguese coast, marking the beginning of Portuguese expansion.\n\n1420-44 The Portuguese acquire Madeira and Azores islands.\n\n1481-95 King Joao II promotes maritime exploration. In 1488 Bartolommeo Dias sails around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n1492 The Spanish Inquisition, in conjunction with Kings of Castile and Aragon, expels the Jewish population. Tens of thousands of Spanish Jews flee to Portugal where King Joao II grants them asylum in return for payment but after eight months the Portuguese government decrees the enslavement of all Jews who have not left the country.\n\n1493 King Joao II deports several hundred Jewish children to the newly established colony of Sao Tome on the African coast where many perish.\n\n1494- 95 Joaoâs successor Manuel I restores freedom to the Jews. The treaty of Torrdesillas is signed dividing the New World in two spheres: the Portuguese and the Castilian.\n\nFORCED CONVERSION, EXPULSION AND MASSACRE\n\n1497 Manuel II marries Isabella, the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain and under pressure from the Church, the Spanish rulers and some of his subjects decrees that Jews convert to Christianity or leave the country, without their children.\n\n1498 Vasco da Gama discovers the sea route to India. Among the investors in his voyage are Marran Goncalo Mendes, a brother of Francisco (The Grand Marran) and Diogo Mendes of the famous Benveniste family.\n\n1500 Pedro Altars Cabral lands in Brazil.\n\n1506 2,000 + Jews are massacred in Lisbon and many more deported to SaoTome (where there is still a Jewish presence).\n\n1519-22 Magellanâs expedition is first to circumnavigate the world.\n\n1536 The Portuguese Inquisition is established, making life harder for Jews converted to Christianity, known as Marranos, Conversos or the New Christians.\n\n1540 The Inquisition holds its first Auto da Fe in Portugal and extends its activity to all the Portuguese Empire. Like the Spanish Inquisition, it concentrates on rooting out converts from other faiths, mostly Judaism, who do not adhere to the strictures of Catholic orthodoxy.\n\n1540-1794 Tribunals in Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and Evora are recorded as burning1175 persons, 633 in effigy and 29,590 had to make penance, an underestimation as documentation for at least 15 Auto da Fe disappeared. Nevertheless many converted Jews remain practicing Judaism in secret, although always under surveillance of the Inquisition and its spies. Others, like the family of Baruch Spinoza, leave to embrace Judaism openly in communities in Amsterdam, London or Livorno. Very few, like the Belmonte Jews, practise their faith in strictly secret isolated communities. They marry within the community and have hardly any cultural contact with the outside world.\n\n1578 A subsequent dynastic struggle enables Spanish King Philip II to invade the country and win the throne of Portugal. Spanish domination lasts 60 years.\n\nWARS AGAINS SPAIN AND FRANCE\n\n1640 After a successful uprising against Spanish supremacy, Duke Joao de BraganÒ«a becomes King Joao IV of Portugal. The BraganÒ«a family remain the ruling dynasty until 1910.\n\n1668 Spain recognised Portuguese independence.\n\n1703 Pedro II signs the Methuen Treaty with England to facilitate the trade and shipping of port to England\n\n1706-50 The reign of Joao V, the Magnanimous, sees incredible magnificence sustained by riches arriving from Brazil.\n\n1755 An earthquake followed by a tsunami and a fire leaves Lisbon completely destroyed.\n\n1750-77 Jose I reigns together with the minister Marquis of Pombal. His rule is a model of enlightened despotism.\n\n1790 After the French Revolution Portugal joins the first continental coalition against France while in 1796 Spain leaves the Coalition and joins France.\n\n1801 Portugal refuses to renounce its alliance with England and Spain and France invade. Napoleon is repelled with support of the British troops who force the French out of the entire Peninsula. Portugal suffers badly from both armies with long-lasting effects on its economic and political development. Gibraltarian Jews are invited back to Portugal.\n\nABSOLUTISM v LIBERALISM\n\n1808 While King Joao VI rules the country from Brazil, English general William Carr nominates Viscount Beresford as regent but Beresford is forced to leave the country by liberal forces who also force King Joao to accept a liberal constitution.\n\n1821 The Portuguese inquisition is abolished by the General Extraordinary and Constituent Court of the Portuguese Nation. Some affluent families of Sephardic Jewish Portuguese origin return, mainly from Morocco and Gibraltar.\n\n1822 Brazil proclaims its independence and King Joao again rules from Lisbon. His older son becomes King Pedro I of Brazil.\n\n1826 Joao VI dies and Pedro abdicates the throne of Portugal in favour of his 7-year-old daughter Maria. There follows a struggle for ascendency between Pedro who promotes constitutional reform and his brother Miguel who supports the absolutist Church and landowners.\n\n1828-34 Civil Wars between liberals and absolutists end with the Evoramonte Convention and Pedro reinstates his daughter as Maria II.\n\n1855-90 There is political restlessness during the reigns of three kings. Establishment of the third Portuguese Empire: Angola and Mozambique.\n\n1904 In Lisbon the Shaare Tikva, first synagogue to be built in Portugal since 15th century is inaugurated.\n\n1908 King Carlos I and the Crown Prince are assassinated in Lisbon.
