She was the fourth of five surviving children, and had a twin sister, who was stillborn.[1] Her sister was Catherine of Aragon, wife of Henry VIII of England and mother of Mary I of England. Another sister, Joanna, married Philip, Duke of Burgundy and was mother of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nMaria did not inherit the insanity that ran in the royal family, and had thus affected her sister, Joanna, who was known as Joanna the Mad.[2]\n\n[edit] Marriage\n\nAs a princess of Spain, her hand in marriage was very important in European politics; before her marriage to Manuel I of Portugal, her parents entertained the idea of marrying her off to King James IV of Scotland. This was at a time when her younger sister Catherine's marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales, was being planned. Ferdinand and Isabella thought if Maria was Queen of Scotland, the two sisters could keep the peace between their husbands. These plans, however, came to nothing. Her eldest sister Isabella, Princess of Asturias, was the first wife of Manuel I, but her death in 1498 created a necessity for Manuel to remarry; Maria became the next bride of the Portuguese king, reaffirming dynastical links with the future Spain. Manuel and Maria were married in Alcazar de Sal on 30 October 1500, and together they had 10 children; eight of whom reached adulthood, including King John III of Portugal, Isabella, Holy Roman Empress, and Beatrice, Duchess of Savoy.\n\nIn 1580, the dynastical links from the marriage led to a dynastical crisis in Portugal that made Philip II of Spain king of Portugal as Philip I (See: Struggle for the throne of Portugal and Iberian Union).\n\n[edit] Appearance\n\nMaria was of a very fair complexion, had blue eyes, and her hair colour was of a shade between reddish-blonde and auburn; these were typical features in members of the Trastámara family who were descendants of Peter I of Castile.\n\n[edit] Death\n\nMaria died in Lisbon on 7 March 1517, and was buried at Belem Monastery of Sao Geronimo.\n\nChildren\n\nHer marriage with Manuel produced the following children:\n\nCastilian and Leonese royalty\n\nHouse of Trastámara\n\nEscudo Corona de Castilla.png\n\nHenry II\n\nChildren include\n\nJohn I\n\nEleanor, Queen of Navarre\n\nJohn I\n\nChildren include\n\nHenry III\n\nFerdinand I of Aragon, Valencia and Sicily\n\nHenry III and II of Leon\n\nChildren include\n\nJohn II\n\nMaria, Queen of Aragon, Valencia, Sicily and Naples\n\nJohn II\n\nChildren include\n\nHenry IV\n\nIsabella I\n\nAlfonso, Prince of Asturias\n\nHenry IV and III of Leon\n\nChildren\n\nJoan, Queen of Portugal\n\nIsabella I with Ferdinand V\n\nChildren\n\nIsabella, Queen of Portugal\n\nJohn, Prince of Asturias\n\nJoanna the Mad\n\nMaria, Queen of Portugal\n\nCatherine, Queen of England\n\nJoanna\n\nName Birth Death Notes\n\nJohn III 6 June 1502 11 June 1557 succeeded Manuel as 15th King of Portugal.\n\nInfanta Isabella 24 October 1503 1 May 1539 married Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nInfanta Beatrice 31 December 1504 8 January 1538 married Charles III, Duke of Savoy.\n\nLouis, Duke of Beja 3 March 1506 27 November 1555 Unmarried but had illegitimate descendants, one of them being Anthony, Prior of Crato, a claimant of the throne of Portugal in 1580 (See: Struggle for the throne of Portugal).\n\nFerdinand, Duke of Guarda 5 June 1507 7 November 1534 Married Guiomar (Guyomare) Coutinho, Countess of Marialva (?-1534).\n\nInfante Afonso 23 April 1509 21 April 1540 Cardinal of the Kingdom.\n\nInfanta Maria 1511 1513\n\nInfante Henry 31 January 1512 31 January 1580 Cardinal of the Kingdom who succeeded his grandnephew King Sebastian (Manuel's great-grandson) as 17th King of Portugal.
