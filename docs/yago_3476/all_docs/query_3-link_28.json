        "text": "Marriage is not easy. It's more than vows and promises, more than love and loyalty. and the six women of our story know that very well. The story of these six women whom by dumb luck, twists of fate or just by chance befriend each other, struggle and face the reality of their day to day life with their partners to find if true love really does exist is nothing more but the story of everyday women in everyday life. Antonia Palacios is a woman who has it all. The perfect man, Patricio, a beautiful daughter, and a nice job. But on her anniversary she realizes that maybe her life's not as perfect as she thought. Her dream job has turned into a slaving labor that consumes every single minute of her time taking away the moment dedicated to her family, and her boss into the oppressive executioner. As she's aware of this she decides to quit her job and start all over by herself initiating her own real estate agency with the objective of making it an all woman project. Here, in MAS Real Estate Agency, Antonia among Barbara, an apparently happy woman abused by her husband; Maite, one of Antonia's ex-client blinded by her greed and hysteria; Yorley, a humble young mother with an unemployed slacker husband; Valeria, a trophy wife who feels useless and is commonly regarded as a shame to her son; and Rosaura, a mature woman usually distracted and clumsy, will find the strength and courage to help themselves to go through all sorts of obstacles with the hope of loving again.\n\nClemente Soriano is a vacuous man who is very powerful and wealthy. He has everything in life: he's a millionaire and has three daughters who all happen to be very beautiful, and has recently married Karina, his attractive young secretary. However, his past holds a dark secret; all of his happiness might soon be destroyed by his old enemy, architect Octavio Uriate, whose family hates Clemente Soriano because they blame him for his brother's death--Clemente had ruined him and stolen his wife. Clemente's eldest daughter Isabela Soriano is a strong young woman who adores her father but can't forgive him for marrying Karina, whom she doesn't like at all. One day, Isabela almost runs a man over with her car: Victor Izaquiree, the new veterinarian of Clemente's ranch. Isabela falls in love with Victor although she is engaged to horse-trainer Cesar. When Isabela finds out that Victor and Karina understand each other, jealousy becomes her enemy and she will suffer a great pain of love. Her sister Diana is very unsure of herself and whether she really wants to be an architect. Mauricio, an old school friend, is in love with her and courts her. One day he presents her to their former college professor for whom he works now: Octavio Uriate. Despite the hatred between the two families, Octavio and Diana fall in love and Clemente tries to destroy it. His youngest daughter Carolina has recently returned from the U.S., where she has been studying. To please her father, she lets Rafael court her; this young man has nothing and is only with her because of her last name and her father's money. Her heart betrays her when she falls in love with her childhood friend Pablo, one of Clemente's employees. When Clemente finds out that Carolina and Pablo are in love, he invents a big deceitful lie that they are actually half-siblings; believing this, Carolina marries Rafael. Clemente goes to Pablo's mother, his faithful servant Paz, and tells her to go along with this; Pablo will suffer the consequences if she doesn't. Because of this great lie, Carolina's life with Rafael is miserable as she pines for Pablo. At this point. all three sisters lose happiness and fight to regain it. But first they must face their father and uncover the mask he holds."
