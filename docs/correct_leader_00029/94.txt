Profession: 17th Prime Minister of Canada

Biography: John Turner was a Canadian politician who served as the 17th Prime Minister of Canada, holding office for a brief period in 1984. Turner's tenure as Prime Minister was notably short, but his career in Canadian politics spanned several decades and included significant roles in the cabinets of Prime Ministers Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau.

Born in England, Turner emigrated to Canada with his Canadian-born mother after the death of his father. He excelled academically and athletically, attending the University of British Columbia and later studying at Oxford and the Sorbonne. Before entering politics, Turner worked as a lawyer.

Turner first entered politics in 1962, winning a seat in the House of Commons. Under Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, he served as a cabinet minister, and later, under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, he held prominent positions, including Minister of Justice and Minister of Finance. As Justice Minister, Turner played a key role in the decriminalization of homosexuality and the legalization of abortion in 1969.

In 1984, after Pierre Trudeau's retirement, Turner won the leadership of the Liberal Party and thus became Prime Minister. His time in office, however, was brief. He called an election shortly after assuming leadership, during which the Progressive Conservative Party, led by Brian Mulroney, won a landslide victory.

Despite this defeat, Turner continued to lead the Liberal Party and was leader of the Opposition for six years before resigning from the leadership in 1990.
