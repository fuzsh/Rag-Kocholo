John Napier Wyndham Turner (7 June 1929 – 19 September 2020) was a Canadian politician and lawyer who served as the 17th Prime Minister of Canada from June 30 to September 17, 1984.

After serving in the cabinet of Lester B. Pearson as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, Turner ran in the Liberal Party Leadership Convention of 1968. After losing to Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Turner served in Trudeau's cabinet as Minister of Justice and Minister of Finance, resigning after Trudeau changed his mind about implementing wage and price controls.

After Trudeau's retirement in 1984, Turner beat fellow cabinet minister Jean Chrétien for the leadership of the party, but lost the general election to Brian Mulroney and the Progressive Conservatives. Having held the office for two months and 17 days, Turner had the second shortest tenure of the office, ahead of Sir Charles Tupper.

Turner served as Leader of the Opposition, fighting against the proposed Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in the 1988 general election. Turner stepped down from the leadership in 1990, and was followed by Chrétien, who beat out Paul Martin.
