        "text": "Nov 08, 2023\n\nRetired dentist Dr John Turner recently revisited the mill wheel and dam site in Sydenham. In the mid-1970’s, Dr Turner purchased the site of the former Anglin Mill, planning to build a home on the south slope facing Sydenham (Millhaven) Creek. Discovering that the property included a disintegrating dam, Turner negotiated a transfer of dam and water rights to the Cataraqui Conservation Authority. The new dam raised the lake level several feet, turning the former Eel Creek and tiny Eel Lake (North of the iron railway bridges) into Eel Bay.\n\nDr Turner and his wife Isobel decided to remain in the former Kingston Township where Isobel was Reeve, and the mill site was transferred to the Township, to become parkland."
