        "text": "It's no secret that being the president of the United States is one of the most stressful jobs a person can have. So it's not surprising many presidents develop gray hairs and wrinkles after just a few years in office. Want proof? We rounded up photos of 21 former U.S. presidents, from the 1800s to now, to compare how they looked before and after their terms.\n\nSome turned to exercise and other hobbies to manage the stress of the job. Barack Obama shared on social media that he de-stressed by taking a short walk outside between the Oval Office and the residence. John Quincy Adams was known to start every day with either a two-mile walk or swim in the Potomac River. Dwight D. Eisenhower regularly found time in his schedule to paint as a form of relaxation. Presidents: They're just like us! But whether this approach helped eliminate gray hairs is up for discussion."
