        "text": "Born and raised in Concord, North Carolina, Dr. John W. Turner graduated from Concord High School before attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Turner spent four years in commercial real estate before deciding to pursue a career in dentistry and graduated Magna Cum Laude while receiving his Doctorate of Dental Medicine (DMD) from Boston University School of Dental Medicine.\n\nFollowing dental school, he received his Certificate in Orthodontics and a Masters of Science in Dentistry from the University of Kentucky. After graduating, he worked for several years at a large pediatric dental and orthodontic practice in Charlotte, North Carolina. Dr. Turner has written research articles, been published in several dental journals, and presented at many national dental meetings, including the American Dental Association, the International Association of Dental Research, and the American Association of Orthodontics.\n\nDr. Turner maintains memberships in many professional organizations to keep up-to-date on the latest dental techniques and technology. He is a member of the American Association of Orthodontists, the North Carolina Association of Orthodontists, the American Dental Association, and the North Carolina Dental Association.\n\n“Having started my career at a large group practice in Charlotte, I determined that for me personally, bigger is not better when it comes to many aspects of patient care. I decided to take a risk, move back to my hometown, and open my own practice. I make decisions every day based on two guiding principles: quality over quantity and treating patients like family. These principles have never steered me wrong and have helped me ensure my patients are always happy with the treatment and care they receive.”\n\nDr. Turner and his wife Kate love spending time with their families. They are huge animal lovers and proud supporters of many local non-profit organizations including the Humane Society of Concord & Greater Cabarrus County and the Boys and Girls Club of Cabarrus County. They have fostered many dogs and adopted a few along the way. Banks and Moose currently run the show at the Turner House. Dr. Turner enjoys fishing, playing golf, and the outdoors. He also loves playing the guitar and is a member of the local band The Cabin Dwellers."
