        "text": "The power of the Executive Branch is vested in the President of the United States, who also acts as head of state and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The President is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written by Congress and, to that end, appoints the heads of the Federal agencies, including the Cabinet. The Vice President is also part of the Executive Branch, ready to assume the Presidency should the need arise.\n\nThe Cabinet and independent Federal agencies are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement and administration of Federal laws. These departments and agencies have missions and responsibilities as widely divergent as those of the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIncluding members of the armed forces, the Executive Branch employs more than 4 million Americans.\n\nThe President\n\nThe President is both the head of state and head of government of the United States of America, as well as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.\n\nUnder Article II of the Constitution, the President is responsible for the execution and enforcement of laws created by Congress. Fifteen executive departments—each led by an appointed member of the President’s Cabinet—carry out the day-to-day administration of the Federal Government. They are joined in this responsibility by other executive agencies such as the CIA and Environmental Protection Agency, the leaders of which are under the full authority of the President. The President also appoints the heads of more than 50 independent Federal commissions, such as the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as Federal judges, ambassadors, and other Federal officials. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) consists of the immediate staff to the President, along with entities such as the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\nThe President has the power either to sign legislation into law or to veto bills passed by Congress, although Congress may override a veto with a two-thirds vote of both houses. The Executive Branch conducts diplomacy with other nations, and the President has the power to negotiate and sign treaties, which must be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate. The President can issue executive orders, which direct executive officers or clarify and help implement existing laws. The President also has unlimited power to extend pardons and clemencies for federal crimes, except in cases of impeachment.\n\nWith these powers come several responsibilities, among them a constitutional requirement to “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” Although the President may fulfill this requirement in any way he or she chooses, Presidents have traditionally given a State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress each January (except in inaugural years), outlining their agenda for the coming year.\n\nThe Constitution lists only three qualifications for the Presidency: The President must be 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen, and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. While millions of Americans vote in a presidential election every four years, the President is not, in fact, directly elected by the people. Instead, in November of every fourth year, the people elect the members of the Electoral College. Apportioned by population to the 50 states—one for each member of their congressional delegation, with the District of Columbia receiving 3 votes—these Electors then cast the votes for President. There are currently 538 electors in the Electoral College.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump is the 45th President of the United States. He is, however, only the 44th person to serve as President; President Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms, and thus is recognized as both the 22nd and the 24th President. Today, the President is limited to two four-year terms, but until the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1951, a President could serve an unlimited number of terms. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected President four times, serving from 1932 until he died in 1945; he is the only President ever to have served more than two terms.\n\nBy tradition, the President and the First Family live in the White House in Washington, D.C., also the location of the President’s Oval Office and the offices of his senior staff. When the President travels by plane, his aircraft is designated Air Force One; he may also use a Marine Corps helicopter, known as Marine One when the President is on board. For ground travel, the President uses an armored Presidential vehicle.\n\nThe Vice President\n\nThe primary responsibility of the Vice President of the United States is to be ready at a moment’s notice to assume the Presidency if the President is unable to perform his duties. This can be caused by the President’s death, resignation, or temporary incapacitation, or if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet judge that the President is no longer able to discharge the duties of the presidency.\n\nThe Vice President is elected along with the President by the Electoral College — each elector casts one vote for President and another for Vice President. Before the ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804, electors only voted for President, and the person who received the second greatest number of votes became Vice President.\n\nThe Vice President also serves as the President of the United States Senate, where he or she casts the deciding vote in the case of a tie. Except in the case of tiebreaking votes, the Vice President rarely actually presides over the Senate. Instead, the Senate selects one of their own members, usually junior members of the majority party, to preside over the Senate each day.\n\nMichael R. Pence is the 48th Vice President of the United States. Of the 47 previous Vice Presidents, nine have succeeded to the Presidency, and four have been elected to the Presidency in their own right. The duties of the Vice President, outside of those enumerated in the Constitution, are at the discretion of the current President. Each Vice President approaches the role differently—some take on a specific policy portfolio, others serve simply as a top adviser to the President.\n\nThe Vice President has an office in the West Wing of the White House, as well as in the nearby Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Like the President, he also maintains an official residence; the Vice President’s home is at the United States Naval Observatory in Northwest Washington, D.C. This peaceful mansion has been the official home of the Vice President since 1974—previously, Vice Presidents had lived in their own private residences. The Vice President also has his own vehicle, operated by the United States Secret Service, and flies on the same aircraft the President uses. When the Vice President is aboard, these craft are referred to as Air Force Two and Marine Two.\n\nExecutive Office of the President\n\nTo provide the President with the support that he or she needs to govern effectively, the Executive Office of the President (EOP) was created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The EOP has responsibility for tasks ranging from communicating the President’s message to the American people to promoting our trade interests abroad.\n\nThe EOP, overseen by the White House Chief of Staff, has traditionally been home to many of the President’s closest advisers. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisers, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full Presidential discretion. The individual offices that these advisors oversee have grown in size and number since the EOP was created. Some were formed by Congress, and others were added as the President has needed them.\n\nPerhaps the most visible parts of the EOP are the White House Communications Office and Press Secretary’s Office. The Press Secretary provides briefings for the media on the President’s activities and agenda. Less visible to most Americans is the National Security Council, which advises the President on foreign policy, intelligence, and national security.\n\nThere are also several offices responsible for the practicalities of maintaining the White House and providing logistical support for the President. These include the White House Military Office, which is responsible for services ranging from Air Force One to the dining facilities, and the Office of Presidential Advance, which prepares sites remote from the White House for the President’s arrival.\n\nMany senior advisors in the EOP work near the President in the West Wing of the White House. However, the majority of the staff is housed in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, just a few steps away and part of the White House compound.\n\nThe Cabinet\n\nThe Cabinet is an advisory body made up of the heads of the 15 executive departments. Appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the members of the Cabinet are often the President’s closest confidants. In addition to running major federal agencies, they play an important role in the Presidential line of succession—after the Vice President, Speaker of the House, and Senate President pro tempore, the line of succession continues with the Cabinet offices in the order in which the departments were created. All members of the Cabinet take the title of Secretary, except the head of the Justice Department, who is called Attorney General.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) develops and executes policy on farming, agriculture, and food. Its aims include meeting the needs of farmers and ranchers, promoting agricultural trade and production, assuring food safety, protecting natural resources, fostering rural communities, and ending hunger in America and abroad.\n\nThe USDA consists of 29 agencies, including the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Food and Nutrition Service, and the Forest Service. The bulk of the department’s budget goes towards mandatory programs that provide services required by law, such as crop insurance, nutrition assistance programs, farm commodity and trade programs, and several conservation programs.\n\nThe USDA also plays an important role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries.\n\nDepartment of Commerce\n\nThe Department of Commerce is the government agency tasked with job creation and economic growth and opportunity.\n\nThe department supports U.S. business and industry through a number of services, including gathering economic and demographic data, issuing patents and trademarks, improving understanding of the environment and oceanic life, and ensuring the effective use of scientific and technical resources. The agency also formulates telecommunications and technology policy and promotes U.S. exports by assisting and enforcing international trade agreements.\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nThe mission of the Department of Defense (DOD) is to provide the military forces needed to deter war and protect the security of our country. The department’s headquarters is at the Pentagon.\n\nThe DOD consists of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force, as well as many agencies, offices, and commands including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe Department of Defense is the largest government agency and includes those serving on active duty, civilian personnel, and those who serve in the National Guard and Reserve forces. Together, the military and civilian arms of DOD protect our national interests through war-fighting, humanitarian aid, and peacekeeping and disaster relief services.\n\nDepartment of Education\n\nThe mission of the Department of Education is to promote student achievement and preparation for competition in a global economy by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access to educational opportunity.\n\nThe Department administers Federal financial aid for education, collects data on America’s schools to guide improvements in education quality, and works to complement the efforts of state and local governments, parents, and students.\n\nDepartment of Energy\n\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) promotes America’s economic and national security by encouraging the development of reliable, clean, and affordable energy. It administers Federal funding for scientific research to advance discovery and innovation, ensuring American economic competitiveness and improving the quality of life for our citizens. The DOE is also tasked with ensuring America’s nuclear security and protecting the environment by providing a responsible resolution to the legacy of nuclear weapons production.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government’s principal agency for protecting the health and well-being of all Americans. It provides essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. The agencies of HHS conduct health and social science research, work to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks, assure food and drug safety, and provide health care benefits to the elderly as well as the financially vulnerable.\n\nIn addition to administering Medicare and Medicaid, which together provide health coverage to one in three Americans, HHS also oversees the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\nThe missions of the Department of Homeland Security are to prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks; protect the American people, our critical infrastructure, and key resources; and respond to and recover from any incidents that do occur.\n\nDHS was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, largely in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The new department consolidated 22 executive branch agencies, including the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe men and women of DHS help to patrol our borders, protect travelers and transportation infrastructure, enforce immigration laws, respond to disasters and emergencies, and promote preparedness and emergency prevention across the country.\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the Federal agency responsible for national policies and programs that address America’s housing needs, improve and develop the Nation’s communities, and enforce fair housing laws. The Department also plays a major role in supporting homeownership for lower- and middle-income families through its mortgage insurance and rent subsidy programs.\n\nOffices within HUD include the Federal Housing Administration, which provides mortgage and loan insurance; the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, which ensures all Americans have equal access to the housing of their choice; and the Community Development Block Grant Program, which helps communities with economic development, job opportunities, and housing rehabilitation. HUD also administers public housing and homeless assistance.\n\nDepartment of the Interior\n\nThe Department of the Interior (DOI) conserves and manages our Nation’s natural resources, wildlife, and cultural heritage across 500 million acres of land—or about one-fifth of the land in the United States. DOI offers countless recreation opportunities for Americans’ enjoyment, serves as the largest supplier and manager of water in 17 western states, and honors the Nation’s trust responsibilities to American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and island communities.\n\nThe agency also conducts mapping, geological, hydrological, and biological scientific research. DOI annually collects and disburses billions in revenue from energy, mineral, grazing, and timber leases, as well as recreational permits and land sales.\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nThe mission of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is to enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide Federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.\n\nThe DOJ is comprised of 42 separate components, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Marshals, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Attorney General is the head of the DOJ and chief law enforcement officer of the Federal Government. The Attorney General represents the United States in legal matters, advises both the President and the heads of executive departments in the government, and occasionally appears in person before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe DOJ is the world’s largest law office and the central agency for the enforcement of Federal laws.\n\nDepartment of Labor\n\nThe Department of Labor oversees Federal programs for ensuring a strong American workforce. These programs address job training, safe working conditions, minimum hourly wage and overtime pay, employment discrimination, and unemployment insurance.\n\nThe Department of Labor’s mission is to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the job seekers, wage earners, and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights.\n\nOffices within the Department of Labor include the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Government’s principal statistics agency for labor economics, and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, which promotes the safety and health of America’s working men and women.\n\nDepartment of State\n\nThe Department of State plays the lead role in developing and implementing the President’s foreign policy. Major responsibilities include United States representation abroad, U.S. citizen services both domestic and overseas, foreign assistance, foreign military training programs, efforts to counter international crime, and facilitation for foreign nationals seeking entrance to the United States.\n\nAmerica maintains diplomatic relations with approximately 190 countries—each posted by civilian U.S. Foreign Service employees—as well as with international organizations.\n\nDepartment of Transportation\n\nThe mission of the Department of Transportation (DOT) is to ensure a fast, safe, efficient, accessible, and convenient transportation system that meets our vital national interests and enhances the quality of life of the American people.\n\nOrganizations within the DOT include the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Maritime Administration.\n\nDepartment of the Treasury\n\nThe Treasury is responsible for promoting economic prosperity and ensuring the soundness and security of the U.S. and international financial systems.\n\nThe Department operates and maintains systems critical to the Nation’s financial infrastructure, such as the production of coin and currency, the disbursement of payments to the American public, the collection of taxes, and the borrowing of funds necessary to run the Federal Government. The Department works with other Federal agencies, foreign governments, and international financial institutions to encourage global economic growth, raise standards of living, and, to the extent possible, predict and prevent economic and financial crises. The Treasury Department also performs a critical and far-reaching role in enhancing national security by improving the safeguards of our financial systems, implementing economic sanctions against foreign threats to the U.S., and identifying and targeting the financial support networks of national security threats.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is responsible for administering benefit programs for veterans, their families, and their survivors. These benefits include pension, education, disability compensation, home loans, life insurance, vocational rehabilitation, survivor support, medical care, and burial benefits. Veterans Affairs became a cabinet-level department in 1989.\n\nOf the estimated 19.5 million veterans alive in 2020, nearly four of every five (15.2M) served during a war or an official period of hostility. About one of every eight people in the Nation’s population—roughly 40 million people—are veterans, family members living with a veteran, or a veteran’s survivor beneficiary."
