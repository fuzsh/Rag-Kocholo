Served as Research Advisor for 5 Ph.D., 16 M.S. students, 20 medical students in research and as thesis committee member for 29 graduate students who have successfully completed their graduate degrees.\n\nMAJOR RESEARCH INTERESTS:Â\n\nMy investigations focus in two areas: Reproductive Physiology and Stress Physiology. Specific endeavors include:1. Development of contraception for selected species of captive and free-roaming wildlife, which addresses an urgent issue of wild animal overpopulation on limited preserves and in zoos.2. The relationship between environmental stress and reproductive function in captive and free-roaming wild species.3. The measurement of fecal steroids for remote (hands-off) stress monitoring and pregnancy detection in free-roaming wildlife.4. Studies of the psychophysiology of stress and relaxation in humans, with specific interest in Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy (REST) as a mediator of the relaxation response and its application to treatment of stress-related disorders.\n\nWhen I and my colleague (Dr. J. Kirkpatrick, ZooMontana) became aware of wild horse overpopulations in 1973, we investigated possible use of steroid hormones as contraceptives in wild horses. This work led us to the use of timed-release antifertility steroids delivered remotely by darting, a cost-effective and humane methodology. However, the issue of steroid behavioral side effects moved us toward an alternative antifertility approach - immunocontraception. This approach has included an additional collaboration with Dr. I. Liu at University of California, Davis in 1986. Since 1987 we have successfully immunocontracepted >100 wild or captive-exotic species, with field emphasis on free-roaming wild equids, cervids, and elephants. Our current research focuses on the development of a remotely-delivered, single-injection of porcine zona pellucida contraceptive vaccine which provides multiple-year effectiveness and complete reversibility. This research is presently funded by the US Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management, and I have been serving as principal investigator for the research team on this project since 1992. As part of the \"hands off\" contraception research program, we successfully developed methodology for pregnancy detection in wild horses via measurement of pregnancy-specific sex steroids in feces. We have applied this technology in various other species since 1991.\n\nIn a separate research program begun in 1979 (with Thomas Fine, MUO Psychiatry Department) I have addressed the topic of stress in humans, focusing on the psychophysiological effects of deep relaxation associated alternative medicine therapies. We have studied physiological changes associated with stress reduction and application of stress-reduction therapy to clinical disorders including essential hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and pain.\n\nSince 1996, I have combined my expertise in wildlife monitoring, fecal steroid analysis and stress physiology in studies which monitor glucocorticoid hormones in feces as an indicator of environmental stress to various wildlife species. To date we have been studying free-roaming and captive wild horses, captive rhinoceros and coral reef fish. We are exploring the possible use of such monitoring to gauge environmental quality.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY:\n\nJournals:\n\n1. Turner JW, Jr and SL Leonard.
