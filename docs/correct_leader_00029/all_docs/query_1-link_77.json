        "text": "Driving better business outcomes in the US\n\nThe US has abundant natural resources, is the largest producer of oil and natural gas, and is the world’s second-largest manufacturer. Of the 500 largest companies in the world, over a quarter are headquartered here.\n\nFor nearly 40 years, we have been supporting the US’s largest and most iconic projects, from major metro transit authority programmes to corporate campuses, helping our clients achieve their business outcomes.\n\nAs pressures mount from a growing population, global competition, a need to modernise aging infrastructure and a return of growing advanced manufacturing, steady market growth will continue. With this growth comes reframed priorities around investments and federal stimulus funds, spatial diversity, architecture, technology, sustainability and social impact. Our understanding of the fast-evolving US market is ensuring our clients remain positioned for success.\n\nExpanding our reach in the US\n\nWith 1,600 employees working across our US offices, we provide an essential combination of local knowledge, industry expertise and global best practices. Our core expertise lies in providing independent cost and commercial, programme, project and risk management oversight to protect our clients’ best interests in successfully delivering construction-related projects. We add value to those engagements by understanding the particular needs of our sectors, through our sustainability and net-zero initiatives, and by offering meaningful insight through technology and data.\n\nIn 2023 we expanded our reach by welcoming two new groups into our US business. Turner & Townsend Heery works with public sector partners, including local and federal government, aviation, healthcare and education providers, and cultural and sporting institutions.\n\nWe also added CBRE’s healthcare project management team, bringing project management expertise for major hospitals, healthcare organisations, and universities with teaching medical clinics. By combining our capabilities, we have the scale and capacity to support complex projects, whatever and wherever they may be."
