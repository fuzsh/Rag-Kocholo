        "text": "For John Turner, politics has always been a family affair.\n\nHe grew up going to meet and greets at county fairs, listening to returns on the radio on election nights and riding on floats in town parades with the message: “Make a note to vote for Jim Turner.”\n\nJim Turner, John’s father, served his East Texas constituents as mayor of Crockett, as a state representative, a state senator and a congressman during a 24-year political career. His mother, Ginny, was president of the local school board.\n\n“Some of that excitement did rub off on me,” said Turner, who is now in his second term as a state representative for House District 114 in northern Dallas. “It put in my mind that I’d enjoy being in politics if the opportunity ever arose.”\n\nLike his father, who co-chaired the congressional Blue Dogs, Turner is a centrist Democrat in a Republican-leaning district. But in today’s hyper-charged partisan political atmosphere, is there space for centrists in politics?\n\nHis father, who remains a mentor and advisor, says Turner has the chops to do the job well.\n\n“Every time I ran there were Republicans running for office. People stayed with centrist Democrats for a long time and I think John has that same kind of district where he has to work all the time,” he said. “There’s only two ways to run: unopposed or scared. I always tried to run scared.”\n\nEarly interest in politics\n\nA good student and avid reader, the wonky side of politics came naturally to John Turner. His favorite subjects were history and government, and he developed an appetite for books on U.S. presidents from an early age.\n\nAt Crockett High School, he served as student council president and showed ambition beyond his small hometown by signing up for a language immersion program in Japan one summer. He took two more years of Japanese through satellite lessons, then another year in college.\n\nEven then, he seemed a natural fit for politics because of his book smarts and earnest demeanor, said his younger sister Susan T. Nold, who is the director of the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n“I don’t remember John getting in trouble except one time when my parents asked him to turn his light on to read and he got in trouble for that — not turning on his light,” she laughed. “Most memories were of him setting me straight when I got in trouble.”\n\nTurner spent one high school vacation in the Texas Senate gallery watching his father and fellow lawmakers deliberate over legislation, often using humor to make their points.\n\n“As a kid who was maybe more interested in policy, watching the Senate in action and following my dad around brought home the personal aspect of politics,” he said. “It’s not just about ideas and policy, but also about connecting with people.”\n\nHis interest in politics peaked at Harvard, where he was involved in the Institute of Politics, which brings undergraduate students together with politicians, academics and policymakers.\n\nAfter Harvard, Turner studied law at Yale, where he met his future wife, Jenia Iontcheva. He then moved back to Texas and focused on his career. But public service was never far from his mind. He joined local Democratic clubs and jumped on lawsuits he thought benefited the public interest, such as a push by Texas cities to fight plans for new coal-fired power plants in the mid-2000s.\n\nIn 2011, he was one of the attorneys who represented a coalition of 88 property-wealthy school districts that sued the state arguing that Texas was inadequately funding public schools after the Legislature implemented new standards while simultaneously cutting education funding by billions of dollars.\n\n“He was always the last one to leave the war room at night. He never left early,” said Mark Trachtenberg, his co-counsel on the case. “He was never going to let himself be out-prepared by opposing counsel.”\n\nA state district judge sided with the more than 600 plaintiff school districts, finding that the system was unconstitutional and was not providing adequate funding for schools to do their jobs. The Texas Supreme Court ultimately reversed that ruling in 2016 and found that the system met the minimal requirements for adequate funding. But the case laid the foundation for education reforms that would come in subsequent years.\n\nA few months later, the election of Donald Trump finally pushed Turner to run for office.\n\n‘I had to speak out’\n\nTo Turner, Trump’s style of politics was the antithesis of his family’s approach and was leading the country down a more adversarial and possibly dangerous road.\n\n“I had to speak out,” he said. “I viewed that as consistent with my dad’s style and what he brought to politics. He always worked to maintain a level of decency and upholding the rule of law and the Constitution.”\n\nIn 2018, he ran as a Democrat for a Dallas state House district that was traditionally Republican. His top two priorities were better support for public education and a renewal of civic values.\n\nJim Turner drove to Dallas to help John put up political signs, as his father had done for him on his first campaign. His mother helped revive another family tradition: the recipe book turned political pamphlet.\n\nWhen the elder Turner ran for office in the 1980s, the homes of his district were hit with copies of “Mrs. Jim Turner’s Favorite Recipes.” John Turner ordered up a condensed version of the recipe book — with some of the same recipes — for his campaign.\n\n“I’m glad he picked that tradition up,” Jim Turner said. “It certainly is a conversation opener — nobody ever throws a recipe book away.”\n\nTo the chagrin of his opponents, Turner also got much-needed financial help from his dad’s dormant campaign account, which still holds hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nBut he also hit the campaign trail, earning the endorsement of groups like the Dallas police and firefighters associations and the bipartisan support of all four Dallas ISD members whose districts overlapped with his.\n\nNold, who had worked for former state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, said she was initially concerned about her brother’s run because she’d seen how uncivil politics could be.\n\n“[But] as a Texan, I was thrilled and happy,” she said. “John is the exact kind of person we need more of in Texas politics because he’s very honest and very civil and he takes being in politics very seriously.”\n\nFacing Lisa Luby Ryan, a conservative firebrand who bumped a moderate incumbent in the GOP primary, Turner won over moderate voters on his way to a surprise victory.\n\nIn his first term, Turner served on the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee and passed laws to help families of first responders who died on the job or had post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nTurner supports strong Democratic causes like a push to expand Medicaid and keeping abortion legal. But he also opens the door for conversation on other issues, such as charter schools and the energy sector’s importance to the state — he does not support bans on fracking or drilling.\n\nThat has allowed him to work with Republican lawmakers on issues of shared interest. Rep. Morgan Meyer, a Republican from a neighboring district, said he worked with Turner on an effort last session to keep children enrolled in prekindergarten programs.\n\n“Rep. Turner and I have worked together on many issues for the good of Dallas, and our state,” he said. “He’s shown a true willingness to reach across the aisle to get things done.”\n\nFormer state Rep. Jason Villalba, Turner’s immediate predecessor, said Turner is a “genuine public servant.”\n\n“He’s always more focused on the issues that impact all Texans rather than the rancor of partisan politics,” said Villalba, a Republican.\n\nDuring Turner’s first term, the Legislature also passed a major public school finance bill that addressed many of the problems he had argued over when he represented school districts in a fight with the state.\n\n“It had a little bit of a feeling of coming full circle,” he said.\n\nRedistricting\n\nComing off a tough re-election battle against Luisa del Rosal, his well-funded moderate Republican challenger, John Turner said he’s focused this session on passing bills to increase health literacy and provide better mental health services to youth.\n\nBut he’ll also have to deal with the first redistricting cycle of his political career. It’s one important area in which he hopes his political career will be different from his father’s.\n\nIn 2004, Jim Turner opted not to seek re-election after his congressional district was redrawn during the Tom Delay-led mid-decade redistricting process, leaving him with only 4% of his previous voters.\n\nJohn Turner has won consecutive elections in a previously Republican district. That could draw the attention of GOP leaders interested in making more Dallas-area seats winnable for Republicans.\n\nWhile Turner knows his district may be redrawn, he said he’s focused on what he can do for his constituents, not what other lawmakers can do to his district.\n\n“I’ve seen what happened to my dad and when his district was destroyed. It happened to him years ago, it can happen again,” he said. “I maintain hope that we can stay away from the most partisan power plays. All I can do is influence what I can.”"
