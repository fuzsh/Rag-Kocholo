        "text": "Tracking Efforts to Remove Trump From the 2024 Ballot\n\nFormal challenges to Donald J. Trump’s presidential candidacy have been filed in at least 36 states, according to a New York Times review of court records and other documents.\n\nMr. Trump has been disqualified from the primary ballots in Colorado, Illinois and Maine, and has appealed those decisions. Because of those appeals, he is still likely to appear on primary ballots in those states, at least for now. The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Colorado appeal on Feb. 8 in a case that could determine Mr. Trump's eligibility for the ballot nationally. Justices across the ideological spectrum appeared skeptical of the reasoning used to disqualify Mr. Trump. It is not clear when they will issue a ruling.\n\nThe ballot challenges focus on whether Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat make him ineligible to hold the presidency again. Those cases are based on a largely untested clause of a constitutional amendment enacted after the Civil War that disqualifies government officials who “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” from holding office.\n\nOf the 36 states where challenges have been filed, President Biden carried 22 in 2020 and Mr. Trump carried 14. Mr. Trump also won a single electoral vote in Maine, which splits its votes by congressional district.\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court and Maine’s secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, each found Mr. Trump ineligible under that provision. Mr. Trump, who is leading in Republican primary polls, has appealed those decisions, and his campaign has described the attempts to remove him from the ballot as unconstitutional and antidemocratic.\n\nA judge in Maine stayed Mr. Trump’s disqualification and ordered Ms. Bellows, a Democrat, to revisit the issue after the U.S. Supreme Court rules in the Colorado case. Ms. Bellows appealed the judge’s order, but her appeal was dismissed.\n\nSeveral judges have dismissed cases at the request of Mr. Trump or the request of the person who filed the challenge. The Michigan and Minnesota Supreme Courts have each said Mr. Trump is eligible to appear on the primary ballot in those states."
