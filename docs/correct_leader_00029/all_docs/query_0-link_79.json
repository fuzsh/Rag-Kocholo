We discuss Turner’s career, legacy, and what we can learn about modern politics from studying Canada’s 17th Prime Minister.\n\nOur discussion comes out of Steve’s new biography John Turner: An Intimate Biography of Canada’s 17th Prime Minister.\n\nHistorical Headline of the Week:\n\n“John Turner Maps his Future” – Maclean’s, September 17, 1984\n\nSean Graham is a media historian, Adjunct Professor at Carleton University, and a contributing editor with Activehistory.ca"
