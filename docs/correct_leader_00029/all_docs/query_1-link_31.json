        "text": "Former prime minister John Turner was eulogized at a state funeral on Tuesday as a gifted politician with a strong social conscience and profound love for the environment who spent decades serving his fellow Canadians.\n\nAn invited list of 170 mourners – among them the current Prime Minister and Mr. Turner’s closest family – were on hand at St. Michael’s Cathedral Basilica for the televised service ahead of a private interment.\n\nThe Britain-born Mr. Turner, Canada’s 17th prime minister, died peacefully at home on Sept. 19, his family said. He was 91.\n\nOne of the mourners, Sean Conacher, called Mr. Turner a “great Canadian” and a politician worth emulating.\n\n“I’m here to honour him,” said Mr. Conacher, a long-time family friend. “In light of what’s happening now in politics, he hearkened to a past that I think we need more of, where public service is important.”\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, who since childhood had known Mr. Turner, echoed that sentiment in an address to mourners.\n\n“Today, more than ever, we need more people like John,” Mr. Trudeau said. “His legacy calls on us not to wait for change to happen, but to stand up and build a better country for everyone.”\n\nWhile the recently renovated cathedral has a capacity for 1,600 people, concerns over the spread of COVID-19 prompted organizers to limit the guest list. Many in attendance wore black face masks and were spaced out among the pews to maintain physical distance. There was also no communal singing.\n\nAs sunlight filtered through the stained-glass windows, Mr. Turner’s daughter Elizabeth Turner praised her father as a dedicated politician and public servant who, despite the demands of public life, never failed to make time for his family and friends.\n\n“John Turner believed in taking the high road,” she said. “He handled himself with great grace and dignity and he always maintained his sense of humour.”\n\nOnce dubbed “Canada’s Kennedy” when he first arrived in Ottawa in the 1960s, the athletic Mr. Turner ultimately represented three provinces as a Liberal member of Parliament. He served as solicitor-general and as justice and finance ministers in various cabinets before his brief, 79-day stint as prime minister in 1984.\n\nOthers at the state funeral spoke of Mr. Turner’s unbridled love for the outdoors and travels to Canada’s Far North. When anyone complained about the weather, he would gently chide them with: “Are you a Canadian or a tourist?” his daughter said.\n\nBorn in 1929 in England, John Napier Wyndham Turner moved to Canada in 1932 after the early death of his father. An Olympic-calibre track star, he would go on to study law.\n\nMr. Turner first entered politics in 1962, when he won a seat in the Quebec riding of St-Laurent-St-Georges.\n\n“Democracy does not happen by accident,” his family later cited him as saying repeatedly.\n\nIn 1965, then-prime minister Lester Pearson named Mr. Turner to cabinet two years before Mr. Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau, and fellow prime minister-to-be Jean Chrétien landed cabinet posts.\n\nMr. Turner ran to succeed Mr. Pearson in 1968, but lost to Pierre Trudeau, who appointed him as justice minister, a post he used to help create Federal Court and a national legal aid system.\n\nHe defended the decriminalization of homosexuality and abortion in the 1960s, but also martial law and the suspension of civil liberties during the October Crisis of 1970.\n\nHe once saved then-opposition leader John Diefenbaker from drowning during a vacation in Barbados.\n\nMr. Turner married his wife, Geills McCrae Kilgour, great-niece of Colonel John McCrae, who wrote In Flanders Fields, in 1963. Besides his daughter Elizabeth, the couple had three sons: Michael, David and Andrew.\n\nAfter leaving politics in 1976, he spent nearly a decade as a corporate lawyer on Bay Street before returning to politics after Pierre Trudeau resigned. Mr. Turner won the 1984 Liberal leadership race over Mr. Chrétien in a bitterly divided contest.\n\nMr. Turner, who opposed free trade with the United States, called an election nine days after he was sworn into office as prime minister. The poorly prepared and divided party proved no match for Brian Mulroney and his Progressive Conservatives.\n\nMr. Turner resigned as party leader in 1990 and left politics three years later, joining a Toronto law firm.\n\nDespite declining health, he was a mainstay at many Liberal events. He gave speeches reminding the party of its golden years, sprinkled with wild stories about life on the political trail.\n\nWith files from John Chidley-Hill."
