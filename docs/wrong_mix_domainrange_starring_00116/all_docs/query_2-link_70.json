        "text": "I don't need a reason to write about how great Toni Collette is — but, if you must know, I rewatched both \"About a Boy\" and \"Little Miss Sunshine\" over Christmas and was reminded that she is one of the finest actors of our time. I now feel compelled to share those films, and more of Collette's best performances, with those of you who may not have seen them.\n\nFrom a '70s glam-rock mystery to an unsettling psychological thriller, these are a few of Toni Collette's must-watch movies (and a TV show, too).\n\n'About a Boy' (2002)\n\n\"About a Boy\" tells the story of self-absorbed bachelor Will (Hugh Grant) and troubled, lonely, strange little twelve-year-old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), and how their unconventional relationship makes both of their lives happier and more meaningful. Toni Collette, however, shines as Fiona, the eccentric and deeply depressed single mother of Marcus — whom poor Marcus is desperate to prevent from attempting suicide again.\n\nThis film is equal parts funny and heartwarming, and is a lot better than the weird, narrated trailers online would have you think.\n\n'Velvet Goldmine' (1998)\n\nThis star-studded musical drama — featuring Collette, Ewan McGregor, Christian Bale, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and others — is set in the UK's '70s glam-rock era, and follows a young journalist as he tries to unravel the death hoax and subsequent disappearance of fictional, Bowie-esque pop icon Brian Slade.\n\nCollette plays Mandy, Slade's wife, in this glittering, glamorous and very camp film that deserves more recognition than it seems to get.\n\n'Little Miss Sunshine' (2006)\n\n\"Little Miss Sunshine,\" perhaps my favorite film of all time, sees Collette in yet another great mom role. This time, she's mother to Olive (Abigail Breslin), an adorably cheerful, chubby little girl and Dwayne (Paul Dano), a glum, Nietzsche-reading teen who's taken a vow of silence.\n\nAlso starring Steve Carell, Greg Kinnear and Alan Arkin, the movie follows the Hoover family on their two-day minibus journey to a beauty pageant Olive is desperate to compete in. It's a brilliantly cast, very funny and deeply touching film — and the final scene is one of the best things you'll ever watch.\n\n'Wanderlust' (2018)\n\nIn this British TV series, Collette plays Joy, a therapist who has recently been in a traffic accident. As she recovers from her injuries, Joy reckons with other sources of pain in her life: a stagnant marriage (which she attempts to fix by opening up the relationship), guilt about a former patient and unacknowledged grief over a dead parent.\n\nThe show touches on serious issues, but there's levity too, with Collette and Steven Mackintosh (who plays Joy's husband) providing more than enough comic relief to stop us feeling bogged down by their troubles.\n\n'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' (2020)\n\n\"I'm Thinking of Ending Things\" is a deeply unsettling psychological thriller in which a young woman travels to meet the parents of her boyfriend, whom she's thinking of breaking up with. It'd be near impossible to summarize the very fragmented events of the film here — so you'll have to watch it yourself — but Collette's performance as the boyfriend's mom is excellent, contributing significantly to some of the movie's most claustrophobic, nightmarish scenes.\n\n'Hereditary' (2018)\n\nI'm sure most people reading this will have seen \"Hereditary,\" but Collette’s performance as the troubled and utterly terrifying mother in this A24 horror is so mind-blowingly good that I'd be remiss not to include it, just in case."
