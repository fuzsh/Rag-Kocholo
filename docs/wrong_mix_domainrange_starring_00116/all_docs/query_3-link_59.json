        "text": "This article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at UCLA chapter.\n\nWhen you wish upon a star… You get a streaming service that has pretty much every Disney title ever.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company’s streaming service, Disney+, is launching Nov. 12, and I could not be more excited. On Oct. 14, the Disney+ Twitter account created the mother of all Twitter threads and revealed nearly all of the content that is coming to their service. They are going to have TV series and movies from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic and 20th Century Fox. There will be old favorites as well as original content that can only be found on Disney+. The pricing is $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year, and all of the content will be ad-free and downloadable on your preferred devices.\n\nI am so excited for Disney+ , and here are just some of the TV shows and movies that I cannot wait to have on my screen:\n\nHalloweentown\n\nI know, by the time Disney+ is available, Halloween will be over, but you can still continue celebrating the autumn season with it. Also, there is no denying that this is one of the best Disney Channel original movies of all time. When I was a kid, I remember thinking it was not Halloween until I watched this movie because I was so enchanted by all of the magic and fantasy. It was a tradition for me, and even if I will be watching it after Oct. 31, I am so excited to fulfill that Halloween tradition once again.\n\nThe Princess Diaries\n\nThis was definitely another favorite of mine. I always thought Mia Thermopolis looked uber cool in her Doc Martens, and the makeover scene seemed so fun!\n\nThe Lizzie McGuire Movie\n\n“This Is What Dreams Are Made Of” was one the best songs from a Disney Channel original movie, and no one can convince me otherwise. Of course I am going to rewatch this!\n\nThe Suite Life of Zack and Cody\n\nAs a child, I would watch this show religiously after school. This was only of the only shows that my siblings and I could agree on, and I remember us watching it all together. One of my favorite episodes was the Halloween special called “The Ghost in Suite 613.” Again, I know Halloween will be over, but I am probably going to re-watch that one first.\n\nCamp Rock\n\nI just went to the Jonas Brothers concert last week, and it was one of the best concerts that I have ever been to! They sang “Gotta Find You” from Camp Rock there, and since seeing that performance, I have been wanting to watch this movie all over again.\n\nHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series\n\nHigh School Musical was iconic. Sharpay was chasing her dreams and Troy and Gabriella’s love was everything to me. I am super interested in seeing what they do this series and if it will stir up any nostalgia for me.\n\nNoelle\n\nI get it, I am jumping from Halloween to Christmas very quickly, but I love holidays. I am a sucker for a good, heartwarming Christmas movie, even if it is a little cheesy. This movie has Anna Kendrick, someone I have been a fan of since Pitch Perfect, and the ever-so-wonderful Bill Hader. He is one of the most endearing actors out there, and I really appreciate how raw and honest he is about his mental health. I am so thrilled to see these two paired up in a film together, and I cannot wait to get into the festive spirit with it!"
