        "text": "It’s been a while since HBO Max became just Max, and it still doesn’t make any sense, and we’re still not used to it. It only makes sense because OF COURSE the same geniuses who innovated the practice of removing exclusive content from streamers would also want to distance that streamer from the most prestigious name in TV. We wouldn’t want anybody thinking Max was classy, would we? So dump the HBO from the name, focus more of the promotion on the bottom-feeding “reality” shows Discovery is known for, and, yes, try to charge even more for it after all of that. Let’s see how that goes. But hey: at least it still has a lot of great comedies to stream. And yes, that’s what this entire post is about: the best comedies on Max.\n\nDespite all the turmoil and nonsensical corporate decisions, Max still has the best, deepest, and most varied selection of comedies of any streamer at the moment. Good luck finding this many classics or pre-’90s comedies on the other services. Max today feels like Netflix did a decade ago, before the streaming world splintered into a dozen different walled off rivals. That’s a good thing.\n\nAlso, my standard disclaimer for these comedy lists: I’m not judging these exclusively on their cinematic qualities. Acting, storytelling, and technique are all apart of the equation, but the most important single facet is how much it makes me laugh.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s get to it. Here are the best comedies on Max today.\n\n1. The Great Dictator\n\nYear: 1940\n\nDirector: Charles Chaplin\n\nStars: Charles Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie, Reginald Gardiner\n\nRating: G\n\nWatch on Max\n\nCharlie Chaplin’s first “talkie” was a biting satire that he wrote, directed, produced, scored, and starred in-as both of the lead roles, a fascist despot who bears a rather marked resemblance to Adolf Hitler and a persecuted Jewish barber. Good satire can be powerful, and this film was: Released while the United States was still formally at peace with Germany, it stirred greater public attention and condemnation of the Nazis and Mussolini, anti-Semitism and fascism. (That said, Chaplin later recounted that he could never have made the satirical film even a year or two later, as the extent of the horrors in German concentration camps became clearer.) The choice to play both the tyrant and the oppressed man was an inspired one, underscoring the frightening but inescapable truth that we all contain a little bit of both characters. This is a strikingly pertinent film for our particular moment in history, and well worth dusting off and queueing up not only for its incredible craft but for its resonance as a study in projection. —Amy Glynn\n\n2. Singin’ in the Rain\n\nYear: 1952\n\nDirectors: Stanley Donen, Gene Kelly\n\nStars: Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O’Connor, Jean Hagen, Rita Moreno\n\nRating: G\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThe most legendary of Hollywood musicals, Singin’ in the Rain is a warm, beautiful, feather-light look at Hollywood on the cusp of the talkie revolution, with timeless performances from Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O’Connor. Musicals can be an acquired taste in the year 2020, but this is one of those legit classics that pretty much anybody interested in the movies should see at some point in their life. It’s a charming, romantic trifle that’s made with perfect precision, and one of the best comedies on Max.—Garrett Martin\n\n3. A Shot in the DarkYear: 1964\n\nDirector: Blake Edwards\n\nStars: Peter Sellers, Elke Sommer, George Sanders, Herbert Lom\n\nRating: PG\n\nWatch on Max\n\nAmazing to think that when the first film in the Pink Panther series was made, it was intended as a vehicle for its top-billed star David Niven. Wisely, director Blake Edwards realized the true star of the show was the bumbling French policeman Inspector Clouseau, as embodied by the brilliant Peter Sellers. So, they rushed another film into production (it was released in the States a mere three months after The Pink Panther) and comedy greatness was born. Ever the sport, Sellers quite literally threw himself into the part, crashing and stumbling through his investigation of murder and mangling the English language each step of the way. Try as they might to recapture the fire of this first sequel, nothing quite matched the freewheeling spirit of A Shot in the Dark. —Robert Ham\n\n4. The Naked GunYear: 1988\n\nDirector: David Zucker\n\nStars: Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla Presley, Ricardo Montalban, George Kennedy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThe final hoorah from the comedy trio David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker—ZAZ for short—The Naked Gun is so stupid it’s hilarious. This, of course, was ZAZ’s secret weapon in films like Airplane!, and in Leslie Nielsen’s stone-faced imbecility they found their muse. A former dramatic actor, Nielsen rejuvenated his career by playing Frank Drebin, a hapless L.A. police detective trying to prevent the assassination of Queen Elizabeth. (And in his courting of possible femme fatale Priscilla Presley, he taught us the importance of wearing full-body condoms.) A wonder of slapstick and deadpan silliness, The Naked Gun makes jokes about terrorists, gay panic, boobs, even “The Star-Spangled Banner.” There’s a character named Pahpshmir. Good lord, it’s all so gloriously idiotic. —Tim Grierson\n\n5. Modern Times\n\nYear: 1936\n\nDirector: Charles Chaplin\n\nStars: Charles Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman\n\nRating: G\n\nWatch on Max\n\nIf time is a flat circle, then Modern Times is like a flat sprocket—the travails of the Little Tramp navigating a mechanical world being so incessant and repetitive that elements like luck and hope only serve to spur along Chaplin’s farce even though they hold little grip on his characters’ futures. Not much changes for the Little Tramp throughout: He tries to survive, and yet the institutional system craps him back out to where he started, desperately hungry and penniless, left with nothing to do but try again. This was also Chaplin’s last go as the Tramp, and it’s easy to imagine that, throughout the film’s many misadventures—joined by equally good-natured partner in crime, the gamin (Paulette Goddard)—as he gets sucked up and sublimated into the modern industrial machine, this “disappearance” was kind of by design. It’s a weird way for Chaplin’s beloved character to go out, but so are the many ways in which Chaplin shows how the modern industrial machine becomes part of the Tramp, too. He may get squeezed through a giant, sprocket-speckled apparatus, becoming one with its schematics, but so too does the assembly line—with all that twisting, wrenching, and spinning—impress itself onto the Tramp, leaving him unable after a long shift to do anything but waggle his arms about as if he’s still on the assembly line. It’s no wonder, then, that the President of Modern Times’ factory setting bears a striking resemblance to Henry Ford: Chaplin, who toured the world following the success of City Lights, witnessed the conditions of automobile lines in Detroit, how the drudgery of our modern times weighed on young workers. The Great Depression, Chaplin seems to be saying, was the first sign of just how thoroughly technology can kill our spirits, not so much discarding us as absorbing our individuality. Modern Times, then, is a film with a conscious far beyond its time, a kind of seamless blending of special effects, sanguine silent film methods and radical fury.—Dom Sinacola\n\n6. Lady BirdYear: 2017\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\n\nStars: Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges, Beanie Feldstein, Timothee Chalamet\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nBefore Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson (Saoirse Ronan)—Lady Bird is her given name, as in “[she] gave it to [her]self”—auditions for the school musical, she watches a young man belting the final notes to “Being Alive” from Stephen Sondheim’s Company. A few moments before, while in a car with her mother, she lays her head on the window wistfully and says with a sigh, “I wish I could just live through something.” Stuck in Sacramento, where she thinks there’s nothing to be offered her while paying acute attention to everything her home does have to offer, Lady Bird—and the film, written and directed by Greta Gerwig, that shares her name—has ambivalence running through her veins. What a perfect match: Stephen Sondheim and Greta Gerwig. Few filmmakers are able to capture the same kind of ambiguity and mixed feelings that involve the refusal to make up one’s mind: look to 35-year-old Bobby impulsively wanting to marry a friend, but never committing to any of his girlfriends, in Company; the “hemming and hawing” of Cinderella on the, ahem, steps of the palace; or Mrs. Lovett’s cause for pause in telling Sweeney her real motives. Lady Bird isn’t as high-concept as many of Sondheim’s works, but there’s a piercing truthfulness to the film, and arguably Gerwig’s work in general, that makes its anxieties and tenderness reverberate in the viewer’s heart with equal frequency. —Kyle Turner\n\n7. Safety Last!\n\nYear: 1923\n\nDirectors: Fred C. Newmeyer, Sam Taylor\n\nStars: Harold Lloyd, Mildred Davis, Bill Strother\n\nRating: NR\n\nWatch on Max\n\n“I shouldn’t have bothered scoring the last 15 minutes,” Rodney Sauer of the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra told me after accompanying Safety Last! at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival. He said he and his ensemble couldn’t even hear themselves over the uproarious laughter in the Castro Theatre during Harold Lloyd’s famous building-scaling sequence. The scene, with its iconic clock-hanging finale—is such a perfect mix of suspense and comedy that it doesn’t much matter that the rest of the film seems to exist merely as a lead-up. Ultimately it’s one of the best comedies on Max. —Jeremy Mathews\n\n8. Problemista\n\nDirector: Julio Torres\n\nStars: Julio Torres, Tilda Swinton, RZA, Catalina Saavedra, James Scully, Greta Lee, Larry Owens\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nAnyone familiar with Saturday Night Live writer and Los Espookys co-creator Julio Torres’ idiosyncratic, fanciful sense of humor won’t be surprised to learn that his feature film debut, Problemista, is a delightfully erratic and wild ride. Problemista follows Alejandro (Torres), a young man who moves from El Salvador to Bushwick in the hopes of realizing his dreams as a toy maker. Getting the sponsorship he needs to remain in the United States proves to be a headache of epic proportions, but he sees a potential light at the end of the tunnel in the form of Elizabeth (Tilda Swinton): An eccentric, volatile and hostile art critic who spends her days picking fights with waiters and Apple Support technicians. Elizabeth solicits Alejandro to help get her cryogenically frozen husband Bobby’s (RZA) paintings into an art show, vowing to sponsor the young man should everything go to plan. But, we all know that everything tends not to go as planned in these sorts of situations. Getting sponsored turns out to be a wholly Kafkaesque experience for Alejandro—an experience replete with a healthy dosage of ludicrousness that Torres highlights with magnificent maze-like sets that recall the wacky, dystopian office spaces of Jacques Tati’s Playtime. These spectacular sets are a staggering showcase of Torres’ command over his unique aesthetic sensibilities and provide shrewd commentary on immigration and classism in a wholly inventive way. Despite the strength of Problemista’s fantasy, Torres doesn’t fall victim to leaning too heavily on the unreal. Using fast-paced cuts, editors Jacob Secher Schulsinger and Sara Shaw seamlessly weave the real and imagined worlds together until they become almost indistinguishable, expertly walking the delicate tightrope of believability, relatability and otherworldliness. This fearless, authentic debut showcases immense command of a unique and inventive form of humor, while touching on a very real issue with heart and candor.–Aurora Amidon\n\n9. A Serious ManYear: 2009\n\nDirectors: Joel and Ethan Coen\n\nStars: Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Kind, Fred Melamed, Amy Landecker, Adam Arkin\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nWorking with few recognizable stars, the Coens have made a funny but odd and inquisitive film about guilt. It’s also their most Jewish film to date, a film about physics professor Larry Gopnik and the Jewish subculture of a medium-sized late-’60s American town. Larry’s life begins to fall apart when his wife says she wants a divorce, and in the great unraveling that follows, the Coens have made Kafka’s implications explicit. The K word is often slapped onto any old symbolic nightmare, but Kafka’s own work was actually very funny, even though he could slip into gray areas without much warning. The Coens can, too. A Serious Man is one of the most fascinating, maybe even heartfelt, renderings of a Kafkaesque sensibility that I’ve seen. —Robert Davis\n\n10. House\n\nYear: 1977\n\nDirector: Nobuhiko Obayashi\n\nStars: Kimiko Ikegami, Miki Jinbo, Kumiko Ohba\n\nGenre: Comedy, Horror\n\nRating: NR\n\nWatch on Max\n\nMovies are rarely, if ever, as whirringly rich and strange as House. The 1977 fairy-tale-as-fever-dream from Japanese director Nobuhiko Obayashi was the debut of a guy who was known mostly for his TV commercials. Given a shot at making his first feature by a struggling studio that had nothing to lose, Obayashi did what any aspiring auteur would do: He went to his 11-year-old daughter Chigumi for ideas. What they came up with is a tragi-comic festival of the uncanny about a posse of seven Japanese schoolgirls, a maiden aunt with heartbreaking secret, her freaky-ass white cat named Snowflake and the house of the title, an ooky-spooky hallucination out of gothic myth and Japanese folklore, jazzed by an animated, ADD-afflicted spirit like something from the minds of Tex Avery and Busby Berkeley on crack. Though: No summary really does House justice, and every little thing about it demands attention, from the schoolgirls themselves—precocious archetypes who go by the nicknames Gorgeous, Melody, Fantasy, Prof, Sweet, Mac and Kung Fu—to the anything-goes flourishes of gimmick and technique, which evoke everything from silent film to children’s shows, classic surrealist cinema to Italian giallo. Obayashi crams every frame with a surplus of mad ideas, as if his background in 30-second spots demanded he never let the screen remain calm for an instant. House suggests that the nitrous-oxide hyperdrive of Japanese pop culture—as vivid now as ever—is a brilliantly imagined, if not in fact transcendental brand of therapy. —Steve Dollar\n\n11. Metropolitan\n\nYear: 1990\n\nDirector: Whit Stillman\n\nStars: Carolyn Farina, Edward Clements, Chris Eigeman, Taylor Nichols, Allison Parisi, Dylan Hundley\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThere have been nearly as many “next Woody Allens” in film as there have been “next Michael Jordans” in basketball or “next Bob Dylans” in music, but sometimes the moniker fits. In Whit Stillman’s debut, he staked his claim as the Woody of the upper-class WASPy NYC set and won a whole army of loyal followers. For good reason, too—seldom has any director, regardless of experience, so deftly juggled dialogue that could so easily have delved into too-clever-by-half-isms, or trained such a sympathetic eye on a sometimes questionable nostalgia for the end of an age. Most of all, though, seeing Metropolitan just makes you feel smart and witty and somehow elevated. Not bad for the price of a movie ticket.—Michael Dunaway\n\n12. Barbie\n\nYear: 2023\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\n\nStars: Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera, Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Simu Liu, Will Ferrell\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWatch on Max\n\nBursting with big ideas on the complexities surrounding womanhood, patriarchy and the legacy of its eponymous subject, Barbie scores a hat trick for its magnificent balance of comedy, emotional intelligence and cultural relevance. The picture begins with a playful homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey’s Dawn of Man sequence. Except, in Gerwig’s prelude, the apes are young girls and the wondrous discovery they make is not a monolith, but a 100-foot tall bathing-suit-wearing Barbie (Margot Robbie), who is there to put an end to Planet Earth’s sexism with her mere aspirationalism. Life is idyllic until Robbie’s Barbie, who refers to herself as Stereotypical Barbie, begins to experience an unprecedented existential crisis. These uncharacteristic anxieties, coupled with the fact that her once-permanently-tippy-toed feet have fallen flat, lead Barbie on a quest to the Real World in hopes of returning back to her normal, carefree self. When her adoring Ken (Ryan Gosling) joins her in her cross-realm voyage, ideologies are swapped, havoc is wreaked and major changes are brought upon Barbie Land. Gerwig is grappling with these heavy ideas of patriarchy and gender, but Barbie always maintains a delightful sense of play and lightheartedness. This is largely due to the pink, campy, absurd and absolutely bewitching set work created by Barbie’s production designer, Sarah Greenwood, and set decorator, Katie Spencer. The incredible sets that we see in the film are real, tangible places whose presence create a nostalgic desire to feel, grab and touch. The believability of the sets—“this is a real Barbie Dream House and Robbie is a real life Barbie doll,” we think—makes for an interesting meta layer for the film. This sense of self-awareness touches almost every aspect of Barbie, from the set design to the campy performances and even its handling of its source material. Writers Gerwig and Noah Baumbach obviously have a soft spot for Robbie’s character, and the beauty of humans in general, but they don’t allow their work with a large corporation like Mattel to prevent them from exploring Barbie’s complicated legacy throughout the film. Like its protagonist, Barbie is all the things all at once. Funny. Sentimental. Entertaining. Confrontational. Celebratory. Heartfelt. Heartbreaking. Kooky. Emotional. And, maybe most interestingly of all, a damn good time capsule for what was exciting and frightening in mainstream culture at this particular societal moment.—Kathy Michelle Chacón\n\n13/14. Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure / Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey\n\nYear: 1989 / 1991\n\nDirector: Stephen Herek / Pete Hewett\n\nStars: Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, George Carlin, Bernie Casey, Amy Stock-Poynton; William Sadler, Joss Ackland, Pam Grier\n\nRating: PG\n\nRating: PG\n\nWatch Excellent Adventure on Max\n\nWatch Bogus Journey on Max\n\nIn the end we just can’t pick between these two. Both movies are classics, but for different reasons. Both movies are part celebration and part knowing parody of the California party dude stereotype that was so popular in the ’80s, and although Excellent Adventure might be the more beloved movie today because of its historical set pieces and the simple fact that it came first, Bogus Journey is the stronger, smarter, and, yes, more challenging movie. It’s a surreal trip through the afterlife that at times feels like Tim Burton with more edge, succeeding at both low brow, crowd-pleasing humor and slightly deeper, more philosophical material. (Yeah, today’s pretentious Rick & Morty Redditors probably love this movie.) Both are far better than they need to be, two hilarious bookends that prove that sequels can be great, actually.–Garrett Martin\n\n15. Stranger Than Paradise\n\nYear: 1984\n\nDirector: Jim Jarmusch\n\nStars: John Lurie, Eszter Balint, Richard Edson\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nJarmusch has fashioned a wildly idiosyncratic, stylish and coherent body of work. In the early ’80s, right out of film school, Jarmusch inadvertently helped define the American independent movement when his second feature, Stranger Than Paradise, found an audience of people who enjoyed its hip-but-relaxed pace, deadpan humor and apparent awareness of world cinema. The film is stylistically simple, with even fewer shots than the film he made during school, Permanent Vacation, and it seemed to satisfy a hunger for movies that eschew Hollywood formula. That hunger didn’t go unnoticed by the industry, which has since created specialized subsidiaries of major studios, festivals like Sundance and cable channels that champion “independent” filmmakers.—Robert Davis\n\n16. A Hard Day’s Night\n\nYear: 1964\n\nDirector: Richard Lester\n\nStars: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Wilfrid Brambell\n\nRating: G\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThat opening chord of “A Hard Day’s Night” is iconic on its own, but when it’s paired with scenes of the Fab Four gleefully outrunning a crowd of screaming fans? Forget about it. The first Beatles movie—a mockumentary filmed at the height of Beatlemania—also happens to be their best; it’s funny, silly, weirdly melancholy at times (it’s hard not to see the foreshadowing when Ringo temporarily quits the band after feeling unappreciated) and full of some fantastic early performances. It manages to poke fun at the fame machine from the inside, and we always get the sense that no one found it funnier than John, Paul, George and Ringo.—Bonnie Stiernberg\n\n17. Sleepless in SeattleYear: 1993\n\nDirector: Nora Ephron\n\nStars Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Bill Pullman\n\nRating: PG\n\nWatch on Max\n\nSleepless in Seattle is essentially one giant love letter to 1957’s An Affair to Remember from writer/director Nora Ephron. Rita Wilson gives a memorable teary summary of the movie, and Annie (Meg Ryan) watches it before writing to Sam (Tom Hanks) inviting him to meet her at the top of the Empire State Building—the way Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr attempt to in their movie—on Valentine’s Day. When they finally meet on the observation deck, the theme from An Affair to Remember swells, setting the mood for anyone with an appreciation for good rom-coms. —Bonnie Stiernberg\n\n18. City Lights\n\nYear: 1931\n\nDirector: Charles Chaplin\n\nStars: Charles Chaplin, Virginia Cherrill, Harry Myers, Florence Lee\n\nRating: G\n\nWatch on Max\n\nIn his later years, Charlie Chaplin was known for bringing pathos into his comedy whenever he had the opportunity. City Lights is the movie where he earns every bit of it. While its structure resembles Chaplin’s usual picaresque format, there’s more of a deliberate purpose as the tramp tries to help a poor, blind flower girl, played adorably by Virginia Cherrill. Harry Myers also deserves a mention for his performance as the millionaire who’s generous when he’s drunk and can’t remember his good deeds when he’s sober. —Jeremy Mathews\n\n19. Time Bandits\n\nYear: 1981\n\nDirector: Terry Gilliam\n\nStars: John Cleese, Sean Connery, Shelley Duvall, Michael Palin, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm\n\nRating: PG\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThe first in Terry Gilliam’s “Trilogy of Imagination,” Time Bandits breathes with the unfettered glee of cinematic magic. Told through the eyes of Kevin, a neglected 11 year-old (Craig Warnock), the film details a literal battle between Good and Evil, between God (Ralph Richardson) and the Devil (David Warner)—though they’re never explicitly referred to as such. What Gilliam accomplishes, as Kevin meets such luminaries as Robin Hood (John Cleese), Napoleon (Ian Holm) and an irrepressibly charming King Agamemnon (Sean Connery, of course), is the perfect ode to imagination, wherein a kid’s bedroom musings gain the seriousness and weight of world-shaking war. Like a much weirder step-cousin to Bill & Ted, Time Bandits employs nostalgia and pseudo-history in equal measure to capture, with boundless invention, what it feels like be 11 again.\n\n20. The Gold Rush\n\nYear: 1925\n\nDirector: Charlie Chaplin\n\nStars: Charlie Chaplin, Mack Swain, Tom Murray, Georgia Hale\n\nRating: NR\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThe Klondike gold rush made the perfect setting for Charles Chaplin’s tramp to run wild. Chaplin took all the motifs he could find from adventure novels, melodramas and other stories of the northern frontier, tossed them in a blender and served up a collection of what would become his most famous scenes. He finds humor in peril—with a suspenseful teetering cabin scene, as well as starvation (when he famously makes a meal of his boot) and of course finds time to show off with his dancing roll scene. However, no one has succeeded in finding any humor in the atrocious voiceover Chaplin added to the 1942 rerelease. Be sure to watch the original version. For a more serious take on the Klondike hardships, see Clarence Brown’s The Trail of ’98 (1928).\n\n21. Legally Blonde\n\nYear: 2001\n\nDirector: Robert Luketic\n\nStars: Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Jennifer Coolidge, Victor Garber, Matthew Davis, Holland Taylor\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWatch on Max\n\nIf you like the color pink and are currently between the ages of 25 and 45, there’s a good chance you’ve practiced the “Bend-and-Snap” at home at least once in your life. Legally Blonde, starring Reese Witherspoon as the lovable blonde-sorority-girl-turned-law-student who proves to her doubtful ex-boyfriend and all the other Harvard kids to be actually, like, really smart, is a perfect example of all of the girl power Rom-Coms released in the early 2000s. It’s smart, it’s quotable, and the outfits are downright iconic. There’s nothing high brow about it, it’s just pure, unadulterated fun. Just like the “Bend-and-Snap,” the film Legally Blonde works every time.–Annie Black\n\n22. Major League\n\nYear: 1989\n\nDirector: David S. Ward\n\nStars: Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Corbin Bernsen, Margaret Whitton, James Gammon, Rene Russo, Wesley Snipes, Dennis Haysbert\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nMany can laugh at this crazy cast of oddballs, but only a select few can look back and laugh. Because for those in Cleveland and northeastern Ohio, it’s all too real. Not until the second film’s release did the Cleveland Indians finally break out of their 30-year slump. Some will say it was the new stadium. Others, the even more superstitious ones (most baseball fans), may point to the dominance and swagger of Rick “Wild Thing” Vaughn, as portrayed by Charlie Sheen. (Fun fact: Sheen was actually a star pitcher in high school.) Whatever the case, the really bad times are in the past, and let’s hope, for the sake of another one of these movies popping up, they stay there. —Joe Shearer\n\n23. Down By Law\n\nYear: 1986\n\nDirector: Jim Jarmusch\n\nStars: Tom Waits, John Lurie, Roberto Benigni, Ellen Barkin\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nWhat makes Down By Law the quintessential Jarmusch film is in the deliberate exclusion of a sequence most other directors would have turned into their calling card. Two innocent inmates (John Lurie and Tom Waits) are joined by a third prisoner (Roberto Benigni), who is guilty but has a pretty airtight argument for self-defense. While playing cards, they discuss various exciting prison break scenes in film history, which motivates Benigni’s character to mention that he has a foolproof plan of escape. After a scene that references such cinematic moments, Jarmusch directly cuts to the prisoners already running away from prison, having cut the escape sequence all together. Jarmusch succinctly demonstrates that he isn’t interested in action but is far more fascinated by the individual quirks and mannerisms of his characters, while the dialogue that references such other prison break films expresses how deeply American mainstream pop culture has defined a big part of his personality.—Oktay Ege Kozak\n\n24. American Splendor\n\nYear: 2003\n\nDirectors: Robert Pulcini, Shari Springer Berman\n\nStars: Paul Giamatti, Hope Davis, Judah Friedlander, James Urbaniak\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nHarvey Pekar’s “American Splendor” books are fascinating: Pekar believed that even the most mundane and seemingly uncomplicated lives were worth documenting. American Splendor showcases this theory by combining real footage of Pekar, fictionalized versions of characters from his life—maintaining both stylized caricatures and naturalistic drama—and even animated segments pulled from the comics to create a cohesive whole that presents an ordinary life as a fascinating experience. —Ross Bonaime\n\n25. Dream Scenario\n\nYear: 2023\n\nDirector: Kristoffer Borgli\n\nStars: Nicolas Cage, Julianne Nicholson, Michael Cera\n\nRating: NR\n\nWatch on Max\n\nNorwegian-born, L.A.-based director Kristoffer Borgli has built his filmmaking career satirizing the way brands capitalize on the narcissistic impulses of young people. DRIB (2017) told the story of Borgli’s real life friend Amir, an absurdist performance artist who nearly scammed his way into becoming the face of a major energy drink. Borgli broke out earlier this year with Sick of Myself, a black comedy about a young woman so desperate for brand attention that she makes herself deathly ill. Dream Scenario marks Borgli’s first full English-language film, as well as his most ambitious film to date, in terms of budget, content and genre. Borgli has expanded past straightforward black comedy and into surrealist horror-comedy. Not only are narcissism and corporate shallowness in Borgli’s crosshairs, but he has also added “cancel culture” to the list. Nicolas Cage stars as Paul Matthews, a balding, tenured university biology professor so unremarkable that it’s almost impressive. His younger daughter Sophie (Lily Bird) has a strange dream where mysterious objects fall from the sky, she begins to levitate and her father just stands there, watching. Inexplicably, everyone around him, including his students and even strangers, starts having a similar version of Sophie’s dream; some kind of disaster is taking place, and Paul stands there, doing nothing. Since this is a Borgli picture, where there’s viral fame, there’s a brand deal. Unlike Borgli’s previous films, Dream Scenario is less about the art of the brand deal, and more about the swift loss of the brand deal, once Paul’s “dream scenario” shifts from a bizarre, but ultimately harmless phenomenon to a terrifying nightmare. Soon, Paul isn’t just a passive bystander in people’s dreams—he’s the perpetrator of unspeakable violence in their nightmares. Thanks to Mandy cinematographer Benjamin Loeb’s harrowing photography in the nightmare sequences, the idea that Paul could be plausibly “canceled” is successful. Less singular in its vision than Sick of Myself, Dream Scenario may be a hilariously scary ride, but by the final 30 minutes, Borgli has lost sight of his original aims. Yes, taking cheap shots at influencers is amusing, but it’s not as original as it may have been a few years ago, and it’s not worth derailing the entire plot for. That said, the bittersweet last frame of Dream Scenario brings to mind Charlie Kaufman’s acerbic writing and Michel Gondry’s darkly whimsical direction on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: A man enters his lover’s dream with the aim of winning her back.—Katarina Docalovich\n\n26. The Player\n\nYear: 1992\n\nDirector: Robert Altman\n\nStars: Tim Robbins, Greta Scaachi, Fred Ward, Whoopi Goldberg\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nRobert Altman’s cameo-heavy Hollywood satire was rapturously received in 1992, and along with the next year’s Short Cuts it represents his late-career peak. Structured a bit like a film noir, albeit in the shallow, pampered world of movie executives, The Player’s mockery of the business gradually grows warmer until it seems to embrace the schmaltz and insincerity of Hollywood. It’s smart satire with a wicked bite and a couple of great performances from Robbins and Goldberg, and a bonus Burt Reynolds cameo for all you Gator fans.—Garrett Martin\n\n27. I, Tonya\n\nYear: 2017\n\nDirector: Craig Gillespie\n\nStars: Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, Caitlin Carver, Bobby Cannavale, Paul Walter Hauser\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThe triple axel was Tonya Harding’s greatest trick—and making an audience think that it’s a comedy of some sort is I, Tonya’s. Craig Gillespie’s infuriating and entrancingly brilliant biopic gives its subject control, and with fury, glibness, regret and a smirk, Tonya (Margot Robbie) and the many others in her life spin her story, detailing the ways that trauma (and class marginality) has affected and shaped her. Scenes of abuse—in which Tonya is often pummeled by both her mom (Allison Janney) and her husband, Jeff (Sebastian Stan)—are bracingly uncomfortable but cut with snark, and the film then has the gall to ask why you could possibly be laughing at such a horrible thing. I, Tonya dares to embody a camp aesthetic and immediately rebuke it, making sure that everything about it, from its skating scenes—dizzingly filmed as if her skill should be admired, but without actually detailing the technical aspects of what she’s doing, as if to mimic white queer men and how they talk about character actresses—to its genre packaging (part wannabe gangster film, part confessional documentary), smears the ironic quotation marks of its framework with blood, sweat and tears: a roar and a snarl and a declaration of defiance. —Kyle Turner\n\n28. Four Weddings and a Funeral\n\nYear: 1994\n\nDirector: Mike Newell\n\nStars: Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, Kristin Scott Thomas, Simon Callow, Rowan Atkinson, James Fleet\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThe first of several Richard Curtis-penned rom-coms starring Hugh Grant, Four Weddings and a Funeral follows our favorite bumbling Englishman as he repeatedly runs into the love of his life at—you guessed it—four weddings and a funeral. While much of the movie is lighthearted and some of it borders on cheesy (see Andie MacDowell’s infamous “Is it still raining? I hadn’t noticed” line in its finale), its graver moments, like Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) dealing with unrequited feelings or the titular funeral, remind us that love may be goofy and complicated and wonderful, but finding that one true match is serious business. The Academy agreed, nominating the film for Best Picture in a stacked year that included Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption. —Bonnie Stiernberg\n\n29. SpaceballsYear: 1987\n\nDirector: Mel Brooks\n\nStars: John Candy, Rick Moranis, Bill Pullman, Joan Rivers, Mel Brooks, Daphne Zuniga\n\nGenre: Comedy, Science Fiction & Fantasy\n\nRating: PG\n\nWatch on Max\n\nOriginally perceived as one of writer/director Mel Brooks’ lesser works, this loving send-up of the sci-fi/fantasy genre (specifically, Star Wars) has, over the years, wormed its way into the hearts of a new generation of fans catching it for the first time at home. “May the Schwartz be with you,” “Ludicrous Speed,” “Mawg”—if these are all terms that mean nothing to you then it’s high-time you checked this movie out and see what all the fuss is about. —Mark Rozeman\n\n30. Dear White People\n\nYear: 2014\n\nDirector: Justin Simien\n\nStars: Tyler James Williams, Tessa Thompson, Kyle Gallner, Teyonah Parris, Brandon P. Bell, Malcolm Barrett\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nWhile Dear White People anchors its perspective in the struggles of its black leads, it argues that racism is a universal issue—or that, at least, dealing with the implications of racism, rooting it out at its source, is a personal task for every single human being to undertake. Who hasn’t, at one point or another, felt like they didn’t fit in with their peers? Who doesn’t feel the tug of social pressure when they’re in school? These aren’t questions about racism, but they do inch us collectively closer to targeting the very deep-seated core of what it is that still makes racism so prevalent today. Simien stumbles in the third act thanks to an amalgam of plot complications (a stroke of simplicity could have smoothed over _Dear White People_’s landing), but maybe a diluted ending would have glossed over the truth at the film’s core: that race politics are more complex than pretty much any one of us realizes.—Andy Crump\n\n31. Forgetting Sarah Marshall\n\nYear: 2008\n\nDirector: Nicholas Stoller\n\nStars: Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nFollowing one of the standard romantic comedy tropes, a man (in this case played by Jason Segel) is tempted to chase the wrong girl (Kristen Bell), ignoring the soulmate (Mila Kunis) right in front him. But while we’d seen the set-up before, we’d seen nothing like Segal’s character Peter getting dumped while naked, Russell Brand as the lead singer for Infant Sorrow or Peter’s A Taste For Love Dracula-themed puppet-comedy-rock-opera. Everyone you’d expect (Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader) co-stars.—Josh Jackson\n\n32. Scott Pilgrim vs. the WorldYear: 2010\n\nDirector: Edgar Wright\n\nStars: Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Brie Larson, Chris Evans, Alison Pill, Aubrey Plaza, Jason Schwartzman, Kieran Culkin\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWatch on Max\n\nIn many ways, all of Edgar Wright’s films have been romantic comedies in some fashion. Shaun of the Dead just happens to have zombies and Hot Fuzz just happens to have two males as its romantic leads. In this way, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is perhaps Wright’s most clear-cut attempt at a rom-com. The story deals in a situation that is all too familiar in the relationship world—that of dealing with your romantic partner’s past romantic baggage. However, to paraphrase Scott Pilgrim’s own words, this emotional baggage (i.e., his girlfriend’s evil ex-boyfriends) is actively trying to kill him every 30 seconds. Just as in a musical, where characters start singing when emotions run too high, Scott Pilgrim dishes out videogame-style duels whenever emotional conflict comes into play. As heightened as Scott Pilgrim may seem at times, its undertones are all too relatable. —Mark Rozeman\n\n33. The Ruling Class\n\nYear: 1972\n\nDirector: Peter Medak\n\nStars: Pete O’Toole\n\nRating: PG\n\nWatch on Max\n\nPeter O’Toole is electrifying in this bitter satire of British social status and the treatment of mental health. The Ruling Class frequently switches tones with no warning—this the kind of movie where characters will occasionally break out into absurd songs despite not being a musical, but that also ends with a bleak final passage that is way more of a horror film than anything else. It’s not particularly subtle in its critique of capitalism and class structure, but satire doesn’t have to be subtle to be effective. O’Toole was nominated for an Oscar for this one, and it’s obvious why when you watch it.—Garrett Martin\n\n34. Trainwreck\n\nYear: 2015\n\nDirector: Judd Apatow\n\nStars: Amy Schumer, Bill Hader, Brie Larson, Colin Quinn, John Cena, Vanessa Bayer, Tilda Swinton, LeBron James, Mike Birbiglia\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThink of Trainwreck as Amy Schumer’s comedy fed through Judd Apatow’s directorial dehydrator: It’s 124 minutes of everything we love about Schumer deprived of just enough bite and flavor to keep us tantalized, and not enough to make the experience special. To the credit of both Apatow and Schumer, who wrote the whole damn thing, they’ve made a funny film—and in fairness, “funny” is all that Trainwreck needs to be. When the picture clicks, you’ll be too busy bearing down and expelling laughter to catch any air or worry about politics. Schumer and her colossal supporting cast easily prove that all anyone needs to cut together a solid comedy is good old-fashioned chemistry, sharp delivery, and a surfeit of killer punchlines. —Andy Crump\n\n35. Man Bites Dog\n\nYear: 1992\n\nDirectors: Rémy Belvaux, André Bonzel, Benoît Poelvoorde\n\nStars: Rémy Belvaux, Benoît Poelvoorde, Andre Bonzel\n\nRating: NC-17\n\nWatch on Max\n\nAn undeniable forebear to Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, Man Bites Dog won the International Critics’ Prize at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, only to receive an NC-17 rating upon its US release, banned in Sweden altogether. One can understand the squeamishness: Man Bites Dog unflinchingly portrays serial murder in its graphic banality, victims ranging from children to the elderly to a gang-raped woman whose corpse is later photographed with her entrails spilling all over the table on which she was violated, the perpetrators lying in drunken post-revelry, heaped on the floor. Filmed as a mockumentary, Man Bites Dog goes to distressing lengths to portray the exigencies of murder as basely as possible, incorporating the reluctance of the crew filming such horrors to offer the audience a reflection of the ways they were probably reacting. The fascinated sorrow expressed by the documentary film’s director (Rémy Belvaux) as he realizes what making a documentary film about a serial killer actually means, becoming more and more complicit with the killings as the film goes on, explicitly points to our willingness as bystanders to stomach the horrors displayed. Still, we react viscerally while the film explores conceptual themes of true crime as pop culture commodity and reality TV as detrimental mitigation of truth, ultimately indicting viewers apt to enjoy this movie while simultaneously catering to them. Benoit (Benoît Poelvoorde), the subject of the faux film, is of course an incredibly intelligent societal outcast beset by xenophobia and misogyny, offering up countless neuroses to explore behind his psychopathy and serial murder, which he treats as a legitimate job. But Man Bites Dog is more about the ways in which we consume a movie like Man Bites Dog, concerned less about the flagrant killing it indulges for laughs than it is the laughs themselves, implying that the real blame for such well-known horror falls at our feet, in which each day we take big, basic steps to normalize the violence and hate that constantly surrounds us. —Dom Sinacola\n\n36. Sisters\n\nYear: 2015\n\nDirector: Jason Moore\n\nStars: Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Ike Barinholtz, James Brolin, John Cena, John Leguizamo, Dianne Wiest, Madison Davenport\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThere’s an emotional subtext to the blowout party that’s Sisters’ centerpiece—a farewell to the siblings’ youth and the home in which they grew up—but [the film] struggles to balance the sentimental and the raucous. For the most part, the raucous wins: Dick jokes and other outrageous gags dominate the film, and the success rate is just barely north of 50 percent. What’s funny is that, despite being veteran comics, Fey and Poehler have never really made their name through lowbrow humor. Embedded in the culture’s imagination first as the witty, snarky hosts of SNL’s Weekend Update, they went on to steer two of NBC’s finest recent sitcoms, Fey with the savvy 30 Rock and Poehler with the touching Parks and Recreation. Therefore, it’s not surprising that while Sisters’ jokes range from sophisticated to gleefully sophomoric, neither performer feels particularly well-suited to the film’s propensity of crass, dopey bits.\n\nSo if Sisters doesn’t have the heart or punch of these women’s sitcoms, it falls on their shoulders to enliven middle-of-the-road material. They do so with sufficient pizzazz. Truth be told, Fey draws the short straw, playing a hopeless screw-up who isn’t particularly charming or hilarious. For better or worse, Fey may be permanently intertwined with her 30 Rock alter ego Liz Lemon, the impossibly flawed but lovable and intelligent career woman who transcended Mary Tyler Moore Show clichés. She can’t pull off the trashy, boozy Kate, but she does throw a lot of energy and good cheer into her attempt. Meanwhile, Poehler has an easier assignment as the heartfelt, responsible, easily flustered Maura, who’s not that far removed from Parks & Rec’s Leslie Knope—or, for that matter, Inside Out’s equally sunny and overconfident Joy. Poehler brings her bubbly personality to Sisters, and her character’s nervous courtship with a kindly neighbor (Ike Barinholtz) is the movie’s most dependably entertaining subplot.–Tim Grierson\n\n37. Observe and Report\n\nYear: 2009\n\nDirector: Jody Hill\n\nStars: Seth Rogen, Ray Liotta, Michael Peña, Anna Faris, Jesse Plemons, Colette Wolfe\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nIn 2009 comedy fans bought tickets for Observe and Report expecting Seth Rogen’s lovable stoner man-child schtick. Instead they had to confront the ugly, violent dark comedy that director Jody Hill perfected with his HBO shows Eastbound & Down and Vice Principals. Rogen is surprisingly good in a role that seems written for Danny McBride, a seething cocktail of confusion, depression, arrogance and anger. Anna Faris, Aziz Ansari, Michael Pena and a young Jesse Plemons round out a strong cast.–Garrett Martin\n\n38. The Other GuysYear: 2010\n\nDirector: Adam McKay\n\nStars: Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Eva Mendes, Michael Keaton, Steve Coogan, Dwayne Johnson, Samuel L. Jackson\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWatch on Max\n\nThe Other Guys might be the least heralded collaboration between Adam McKay and Will Ferrell, but it foreshadowed McKay’s shift into politics with an animated closing credits sequence that digs into the then-ongoing economic crisis in great detail. That might be what it’s best remembered for, and it might not have the absurd brilliance of Step Brothers or Talladega Nights, but Other Guys shouldn’t be overlooked. Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are a great clash of personalities, and Steve Coogan, Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson are all hilarious in smaller roles.–Garrett Martin\n\n39. Baby Mama\n\nYear: 2008\n\nDirector: Michael McCullers\n\nStars: Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Greg Kinnear, Dax Shepard, Sigourney Weaver\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWatch on Max\n\nBaby Mama is not great. If you can get past the disappointment felt in the wake of high expectations for Tina Fey and Amy Poehler’s first big screen team-up, though, you’ll find a piece of Hollywood product that’s just charming enough to be worth your time. Fey and Poehler help elevate hit and miss material, and Steve Martin revives some of his early career absurdity in a great supporting role. It’s still not what we were hoping it would be back in 2008, but it’s far from a disaster.–Garrett Martin\n\n40. Kingpin\n\nYear: 1996\n\nDirectors: Bobby and Peter Farrelly\n\nStars: Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, Vanessa Angel, Bill Murray\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWatch on Max\n\nKingpin is probably the best movie ever made about bowling, which is kind of sad, since it’s basically making fun of bowling. Okay, it doesn’t completely disrespect the sport that Dick Weber and Earl Anthony made famous, but we’re clearly supposed to find the milieu of competitive bowling (both professional and underground) inherently hilarious. This isn’t the strongest script for a Farrelly movie (it’s one of two live-action films they directed where they don’t get a writing credit) but it might be funniest thanks to great performances by Bill Murray, Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid. Murray’s as amazing as ever, but it’s Woody’s movie, and one of his best film roles.—Garrett Martin\n\n41. Semi-Pro\n\nYear: 2008\n\nDirectors: Kent Alterman\n\nStars: Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson, André Benjamin, Will Arnett, Andrew Daly\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max\n\nSemi-Pro awkwardly welds two distinct comedies together–the first a serious, gritty sports comedy in the vein of Slap Shot starring Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney, and the second one of Will Ferrell’s live action cartoons. They don’t quite gel together, but both hit high notes on their own. A fantastic supporting cast buoys this narratively listless film, including Andy Daly, Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Andy Richter, and Jason Sudeikis, making sure it’s funny even when it’s not necessarily good.–Garrett Martin\n\n42. Schizopolis\n\nYear: 1996\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nStars: Steven Soderbergh, Dave Jensen, Betsy Brantley, Eddie Jemison\n\nRating: R\n\nWatch on Max"
