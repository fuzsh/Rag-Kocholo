        "text": "Randall Park did yeoman's work in smaller, character parts in film and television before finding his way into leading roles. The son of Korean immigrants, he was born in Los Angeles, where he attended UCLA. After college, he began appearing in a series of small roles on television shows like \"Alias\" (ABC, 2001-06), \"ER\" (NBC, 1994-2009), and \"House\" (Fox, 2004-12). He took roles in all manner of programs, including the sketch comedy show \"MadTV\" (Fox, 1995-2016), the soap opera \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" (CBS, 1987- ), and the teen comedy \"iCarly\" (Nickelodeon, 2007-12). On the big screen, he has supporting roles in \"Dinner for Schmucks\" (2010), \"Larry Crowne\" (2011), and \"The Five-Year Engagement\" (2012). His plethora of TV guest roles included memorably funny turns on \"The Office\" (NBC, 2005-13) and \"Community\" (NBC, 2009-15), and a recurring role on the Julia Louis-Dreyfus political comedy \"Veep\" (HBO, 2012-19) as Governor Danny Chung. His breakthrough finally came when he was cast as North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un opposite Seth Rogen and James Franco in \"The Interview\" (2014). While the film wasn't successful, it raised Park's profile significantly. He appeared alongside Amy Schumer and Bill Hader in \"Trainwreck\" (2015) and was part of the cast, along with Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper, and Amy Poehler in \"Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp\" (Netflix, 2015). He received his first true lead role when he was cast as Louis Huang, the father of celebrity chef Eddie Huang, in the sitcom \"Fresh Off the Boat\" (ABC, 2015- ). Teaming with Constance Wu, who played his wife, Park used his nice guy persona to great effect throughout the show's run. Outside of the show, the actor continued making films, including funny turns in the Christmas comedies \"The Night Before\" (2015), with Rogen, and \"Office Christmas Party\" (2016). He appeared with his other \"The Interview\" costar in Franco's \"The Disaster Artist\" (2017). He stepped into the comic book film genre, carving a niche in both the Marvel and DC cinematic universes. He teamed with Rudd again, playing FBI agent Jimmy Woo, in \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" (2018). He then appeared opposite Jason Momoa as Dr. Stephen Shin in \"Aquaman\" (2018). Park then wrote and starred in the romantic comedy \"Always Be My Maybe\" (Netflix, 2019) with comedian Ali Wong."
