        "text": "Disney and Pixar’s Inside Out 2 has dropped another teaser trailer with three new animated characters voiced by Paul Walter Hauser, Ayo Edebiri and Adèle Exarchopoulos sharing main character Riley’s (Kensington Tallman) now-teenage mind.\n\nJoining Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness and Lewis Black as Anger are Maya Hawke as Anxiety; Edebiri’s new and perpetually jealous animated character Envy; Exarchopoulos’ bored and eye-rolling Ennui emotion; and Hauser voicing his burly, yet red-faced, character of Embarrassment.\n\nThe sequel also features new voices for fear and disgust, with Tony Hale replacing Bill Hader and Liza Lapira replacing Mindy Kaling, respectively.\n\n“You got a real sweaty palm there, buddy,” Riley, about to begin high school, tells a cowering Embarrassment after they shake hands. The trailer has other emotions in the head of the newly minted teenager in predictable turmoil as Lilimar Hernandez voices Valentina “Val” Ortiz, a high school hockey player everyone, including Riley and her friends, looks up to.\n\nDiane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan return to voice Riley’s mom and dad; Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green and Grace Lu provide the voices for Riley’s besties; and Yvette Nicole Brown voices Coach Roberts, who heads up a summer hockey camp.\n\nThe voice cast also includes Sarayu Blue, Flea, Ron Funches, Dave Goelz, James Austin Johnson, Bobby Moynihan, Frank Oz, Paula Pell, Paula Poundstone, John Ratzenberger, Kendall Coyne Schofield, June Squibb, Kirk Thatcher and Yong Yea.\n\nInside Out is considered a high-water mark for Pixar, whose original crowd-pleasing film in the franchise earned $857.6 million globally and featured a then-11-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) as she moved across the country with her family.\n\nDirected by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, Inside Out 2 will hit theaters June 14."
