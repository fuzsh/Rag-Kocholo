        "text": "Altered Carbon This series is based on the 2002 cyberpunk sci-fi novel by Richard K. Morgan. The concept is rich: In the future, technology can digitize consciousness and place it in new bodies. Buh-bye, death as we know it. There’s an uprising, some murder, and the double scoop of excellence that is James Purefoy and Joel Kinnaman. Feb. 2, Netflix\n\nHERE AND NOW Nope, not a TV adaptation of the NPR series. Alan Ball, creator of “Six Feet Under” and “True Blood,” returns with this look at a multi-ethnic family in Portland, Ore. Tim Robbins and Holly Hunter star as a philosophy professor and a lawyer, respectively, who are the parents of adopted children from Vietnam, Liberia, and Colombia, as well as one biological child. One of the kids starts seeing things, which triggers the story line. I’m hoping the “seeing things” thing has more to do with psychiatry than a sixth sense. Feb. 11, HBO\n\nOur Cartoon President We see it every day in the news; now we’ll get to see it in animation. This 10-episode series, executive produced by Stephen Colbert, skewers the Trump administration, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, daughter Ivanka Trump, and sons Eric and Don Jr. “I think Michael Wolff must have stolen all 10 of our episodes to write ‘Fire and Fury,’” Colbert said at the TCA press tour this year, “because there is nothing in that book that isn’t in our show.” Feb. 11, Showtime\n\nThe Looming Tower This miniseries, based on the 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Lawrence Wright, looks at the history of Al-Qaeda, its terrorist attacks, and the events that led to 9/11. Did the rivalry between the FBI and the CIA set the path for tragedy? The cast includes Bill Camp as Robert Chesney, Jeff Daniels as John O’Neill, Michael Stuhlbarg as Richard Clarke, Peter Sarsgaard as Martin Schmidt, and, in a guest role, Alec Baldwin as George Tenet. Feb. 28, Hulu\n\nHEATHERS The movie “Heathers” came out in 1988. Things have changed since then, and this reboot, set in the present day, tries to incorporate them. Twist: This time, the vicious group is made up of plus-sized fashionista Heather (Melanie Field), a gender-queer Heather (Brendan Scannell), and a black Heather (Jasmine Mathews). Original “Heathers” cast member Shannen Doherty will guest star, and Selma Blair and Casey Wilson are in the regular cast of olds. March 7, Paramount Network\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRISE All I need to hear is “from Jason Katims” — the writer and executive producer of “Friday Night Lights” and “Parenthood” — and I’m in. This new musical drama, based on a true story, follows a dedicated high school teacher and family man (played by Josh Radnor of “How I Met Your Mother”) who takes over the school’s theater department and tries to bring together the faculty, the students, and the entire working-class town. Sounds like “Glee,” but Katims’s style couldn’t be more different from Ryan Murphy’s. Also in the cast: Rosie Perez and Shannon Purser, a.k.a. Barb. March 13, NBC\n\nTRUST This dynastic saga goes deep on the Gettys, beginning in 1973 with the kidnapping of teenager John Paul Getty III, an heir to the family fortune. Oil tycoon J. Paul Getty Sr., played by Donald Sutherland, is an enigma who lives in the English countryside with a harem of mistresses and a pet lion. The kid’s mother, Gail Getty (Hilary Swank), has to negotiate with the desperate kidnappers, but she’s broke. The series is created by Simon Beaufoy, who wrote “Slumdog Millionaire,” “Battle of the Sexes,” and “127 Hours,” and it is executive produced by Danny Boyle. March 25, FX\n\nBARRY Bill Hader co-created this comedy with Alec Berg (“Seinfeld,” “Silicon Valley”), and he stars as a depressed hit man from the Midwest. Lonely and unhappy, he winds up going to Los Angeles to shoot someone and stays there. He takes an acting class and gets involved with a community of would-be actors in the theater scene. Can he balance both worlds? Henry Winkler also stars. March 25, HBO\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert Wisely, NBC is stocking the cast of this version of the famous rock opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice with musicians. To be helmed by British theater director David Leveaux, the Easter Sunday event will feature John Legend as Jesus, Sara Bareilles as Mary Magdalene, and Alice Cooper as King Herod. The production will air in front of a live audience at the Marcy Armory in Brooklyn. April 1, NBC\n\nHowards End The 1992 film adaptation of E.M. Forster’s novel, with Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter, was perfection. Let’s see how Starz does with the Edwardian story of sisters, class distinction, love, and idealism. The four-hour version is written by Kenneth Lonergan (“Manchester by the Sea”) and directed by Hettie Macdonald (“Beautiful Thing”), and the stars include Hayley Atwell, Philippa Coulthard, Matthew Macfadyen, Julia Ormond, and Tracey Ullman. April 8, Starz\n\nMatthew Gilbert can be reached at gilbert@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @MatthewGilbert."
